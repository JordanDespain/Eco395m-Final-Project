Lopez cabrera sabor y Tradicion,1,The best breakfast tacos and sweetest people. My favorite  I ve been to multiple trucks but nothing compares to her tacos. Delishhhhh
Lopez cabrera sabor y Tradicion,2,Let the 4 day weekend food binge begin  ...Dang good breakfast Taco coming from a super friendly lady in a tiny food trailer  ...Bacon  egg and cheese...and Chorizo  egg and cheese...both sauces were great...orange was  spicy...very addictive 
Taqueria Mejia,1,Welp  another amazeballs taco experience in Austin.  Mejia is very good  for sure 5-star category. I had my usual test tacos  2 bistek  amp  1 pastor.  Fillings  The bistek was charred perfectly  soft  juicy and flavorful.  The pastor was spiced perfectly  soft and also juicy.  Pineapple was very flavorful.  Tortillas  nice and earthy corn and structurally perfect while still being soft.  The lime was one of the juiciest limes I ve ever had at a taco wagon.  What they do differently  You get a fresh  amazing  large  grilled jalepe o and they grill their onions instead of just chopped uncooked as is the norm.  Overall very very good and I like the fact that they switch it up a little.
Taqueria Mejia,2,I just tried this gem today  part of my continuing quest to find the best trailer food in town. I was seeking a mid-afternoon snack and was pleased to find they serve breakfast tacos all day long.  It s never a bad time for breakfast tacos  am I right   Two egg and cheese on flour tortillas   2 taco. The flour tortillas did not appear to be made in house  but they were soft and tasted fresh. The eggs were crisped around the edges  yum    the cheese all melty  and when I added green sauce to my tacos  I was in heaven   The owner    said the red sauce was hotter so I stuck with the green  plenty hot for me.  Picnic tables sit under large oak trees and make eating outside the trailer very pleasant. My breakfast tacos were simple and delicious  and I ll definitely be back to try other offerings.
Taco 'N Mama,1,This taco place is located inside the subway and is now called  Un Taco Mas . We stumbled upon it while waiting to pick some friends up. The tacos were SO good. So good in fact that on several road trips from Houston to Austin we have stopped here to eat. Quick  well priced and delicious. Would recommend and will obviously be back.
Taco 'N Mama,2,Staying at the Hilton next to the Austin airport. Went for a walk around the hotel and just happened to see this place. It s located inside the subway.  I ordered Carne Asada burrito. They didn t have any ready  so they immediately cooked up fresh meat. From there I was able to complete my burrito with whatever toppings I wanted.  I must say  local ingredients and fresh food  A great surprise and beats hotel food.
Taco 'N Mama,3,I usually time out my airports runs perfectly to not need to stop in the cell phone lot but today   I did have an extra 10 minutes to stop in someplace and I was STARVING.    Austin Java was closed because its the day before Thanksgiving  lazy hippies     and I was hungry but not hungry enough to eat at Subway  thus Taco n  Mama to the rescue.   It s a nice menu and you can t beat paying less than  5 for a taco in this taco anymore.  My jimica agua fresca was good  just the right amount of tart and sweet.     My cochinita taco was very wet and not well flavored and even their extensive salsa bar can t fix a lack of salt in the cooking process.  But the meat was high quality and very lean  might also explain lack of flavor   no funny stuff in it.  I will come back if I ever need to kill a few minutes and grab a bite in the cell phone lot.   Editor s Note  reviewer is herself a hippie at heart and is mostly jealous the AJ staff got today off as a holiday.
Taco 'N Mama,4,Found this hidden gem  completely by accident. I am glad I did  because the food was amazing. My daughter randomly chose to come in to this place and we will definitely be back.
Jack in the Box,1,Great experience. Staff was very friendly and seemed to care about the work. Better than the absolute travesties that are happening across the street at both McDonald s and whataburger.
Jack in the Box,2,The worst jack in the box in Texas. Want food after 9 pm  Good luck  Says it s open but the employees don t want to do anything. Laughable to say the least. CLOSES AT 9   
Jack in the Box,3,I go to the drive thru and they answer and then when I order they said O  sorry we closed now we won t open till 6am  you can come back then.  I pull around and there are a few employees just hanging out. This isn t the first time this has happened at this location.
Jack in the Box,4,03 27 22   2 43am...   Waited in line for 5-10 minutes  placed the order respectfully and efficiently just to be given bad customer service and bad quality food. I checked my food before I left the line  told the window attendant and whoever the shorter older Hispanic woman was  behind her  my supreme croissant only had ham. The older lady poked her head around and told me directly  the supreme only came with ham. I knew she was wrong but to keep my attitude in check  I asked my fianc  to pull to the side so I could check the online menu and the location menu.. both employees at the window were rude and didn t give a damn. Ugly attitudes  talking shit in Spanish   I understand and speak the language   and didn t care at all. I will definitely be taking this up with upper management. Choose your employees wisely cause someone else would have acted a fool given this horrible service. I wish I could give 0 stars  no hate intended but they gave this spot a bad ass look.
Jack in the Box,5,Ordered the  16 got the wrong order. On top of that I ordered a Large curly fries and got it filled half way . I think I ll go to McDonald s next time lol  Update  I m still mad about the fries but I ended up really liking the sandwich they accidentally gave me   So I change my 1 star  to 3
Jack in the Box,6,This place is ridiculous    We came there on Wednesday at 8 10pm and they said they were close. What the F    Not even 9pm in this big city   Website says they are open till 10pm. I guess just bunch of lazy people work there  The manager should pay attention to this.
Jack in the Box,7,Took forever to greet and they got my order wrong  I was the only car in the drive through and didn t even order a big order. Wish I left after not being greeted in a timely manner.   I gave them more then enough patience  
Jack in the Box,8,I usually come to this location when I have to work extra shifts late at night and pick up food during my shift overnight. How is a restaurant that claims to be open 24hrs closed at 1 30am  Nobody answering the drive thru  nobody at the drive thru window  nobody even walking around in that pos. This location got the laziest  most  incompetent employees in Austin. Never again
Jack in the Box,9,Alright  honestly I never thought I would go out of my way to write a review for a fast food joint  but I feel like these guys deserve it. I m actually really surprised at the low reviews on here  so let me start off by saying I only come here between 1 am to 4 am so perhaps my experience is different.  I work nights and this place had become a bit of a godsend for me in having consistently good  late night food. It s probably the best Jack in the Box I ve had and the two guys they have working there at night  might be 3  not sure if there s one guy in the back or not  are always super friendly and more importantly  professional. Yes sir  no sir  they hustle to get you your food  and are quick to apologize and work fast to remedy if there are any errors in the order.  They tell you they always make the food fresh and personally I believe them. It s FRESH fresh. Now sometimes it can be a wait depending on how much you order  which is totally fine  but let me tell you  Jack in the Box corp easily could come down and take a picture of the food they serve and use it as an advertisement because it looks exactly like the food you see on the ads and I think we all know that just doesn t happen.  Anyway  just wanted to say keep up the work night crew. I always appreciate ya.
Jack in the Box,10,Went to jack in the box at 9 20 I went inside and they told me that they are no longer taking orders  When they close at 10pm. Last time I knew restaurants take orders til the time their closed. Lazy unprofessional don t waste your time here 
Jack in the Box,11,One star reviews nationwide until you stop emailing me I m almost finished with the city hope this is long enough to not be a tip and remaining review one star reviews all day
Jack in the Box,12,Don t waste your time going to this crap hole. Lazy employees on the morning shift will allow customers pull up in the drive they  decide on what food sounds good then tell you  we are updating our systems and are shut down for an hour  they usually will say that if you have exact dollar amount to the penny for your order  that they will get off of their lazy arses and actually  do their job. This morning I tested this scenario  bringing exact payment to the penny for the cost of my order. Low and behold  to no surprise at all  the worthless employee proved herself as not only being lazy  she took the crown for Lazy Liar.  To top it off their were crack heads on cycles harassing and very aggressively demanding money from  myself and the other patrons in the two vehicles sandwiched in the drive thru without a quick escape  other than nearly backing over them before they moved out of the way. I guess they picked up on the scent of potential Jack Box patrons having money they cNt spend on an order on them. This is dangerous and it won t surprise me if I see a report of a robbery or car jacking on the news one day.   Putting your customers thru the torment of being harassed and at potential risk of being assaulted  vehicle damaged  etc. is something that needs to be addressed immediately before someone gets hurt. Even a lazy employee can do their due diligence by turning  off the welcoming  open  signs  when you clearly are on break and closed to the public on a consistent basis during these morning hours.   Hope this helps save someone from this inevitable experience you will receive from this crappy Jack Box  I won t be going back ever again.   Thank you for reading.
Jack in the Box,13,So I came here to celebrate National Hamburger Day  today  and it s 8pm but when I walked in the girl at the front counter said  We re closed ... How in the WORLD is this 24 hour location CLOSED at 8pm on NATIONAL HAMBURGER DAY     Clearly it was the staff who ain t wanna work because there was other people in the drive thru and walked in too  turned away  for NO REASON... She gave no explanation as to why and when we drove off she and her friends were sitting at the front looking at videos on their cell phones... Girl bye just say you ain t wanna come to work TO WORK... She lucky I wasn t in a hurry or on my lunch break... Taco Bell got my money tonight
Jack in the Box,14,I ve come here multiple times and it is very slow. Or they get your order wrong.... then the guy at the window says that only his manager knows how to make certain foods so they take forever getting stuff out.
Jack in the Box,15,Wow Jack s burger are getting small. Looks like the same size as McDonald s.  Pay so much for small double meat burgers. Oh that s not all whoever s in charge they had  no CO2. Not so good for business.
Jack in the Box,16,Horrible customer service      I decided to take the drive through route and never again will I come to this jack in the box ... the woman taking orders was very rude her name is Celeste. I was so kind to ask for two separate orders and as I was giving my food order  she rudely cut me off saying  anything else  anything else ..  now keep in mind I was not done ordering and I was still on my first order. Again  she asked  anything else   rudely and I said  no I still have order  2  okay so I have her my order. I pull up to the window and she gave me my 1st order and at that did not say thank you or anything but kept giving me the stank eye  I kindly said  I still need order  2  she smacked her lips and gave me my order  when I had given her the money I left out a dollar  instead of asking me nicely  she demanded I give her the rest of the money. Celeste   You didn t give me enough  I said  oh I m sorry I thought I gave you .75c   Celeste  no u didn t u gave me  7  all in all  I believe that if you can t be nice then you shouldn t be in the food or retail industry.
Jack in the Box,17,The service here is shit  took them 20 minutes to get to my order and I was the only car in the drive thru  
Jack in the Box,18,This is the location of I m sorry we are out of that and sorry your order won t come with that.  I ordered the deli trio sandwich as always and they were out of pickles and the bread.  Ok well I guess I will get something else but  oh sorry we don t have fries right now      What   I will have a coke to drink.  Oh what  you are out of coke      Geez tell me what you do have left because I am batting 1 000 here.  Unbelievable and I would try another location because this is the second time I have gone through this here 
Jack in the Box,19,I have been to this place 3x within the past month and I have received excellent customer service   There is one outstanding cashier she greets everyone w great smile and thanks as we drive off or leaving restaurant. I believe her name is Fatima. She and and gentleman Raymond are very good cashiers. I ve seen both work really hard and try best to get orders out in timely manner. Yes there is little problems w the cleanliness but have also noticed that one hispanic lady Fatima and Raymond clean. I appreciate it and their great customer service    Thank you guys 
Jack in the Box,20,So I liked the food here the multiple times I ve been to this location late at night whenever there s nothing else open. I did have a bad experience at a drive through one time though about a year ago. The cashier looked at me with a very stern countenance  plus he was just dangling my food waiting for me to get my change together for my food. Not sure why Jack in the Box would hire such a seemingly rude person  but overall I enjoyed the food there. Good for every once in awhile since the food here is obviously unhealthy for you  plus every other time I ve been here the employees were not egregious.
Jack in the Box,21,I have been a loyal customer to Jack -in-The-Box since one of the first if not the first one opened in Rice Village on Kirby Drive and Rice Blvd when I was a child. I have loved their tacos for a very long time. For the first time ever  last night I had to eat my tacos with no taco sauce or sour cream for which we were charged extra for and did not receive along with the requested taco sauce  a spoon  curly fries  a straw for my shake which was thick with some kind of vanilla powder you could not use the one thin straw I received for my soda which was a blessing because the vanilla shake was nasty. This is the first time ever I have had a complaint about Jack in the Box and I am 60 years old. The lady who took our order  Sylvia  was too busy talking to her Male friend posted up on the counter who was more important than customers. We are new to this area and were excited cuze the Jack in Cedar Park closed years ago on Bell. I do not appreciate getting charged for items which were not put in the bag by an uninterested worker. I hope this review does not fall on deaf ears. The Jack was located on Airport and Oak Springs. Customer service is at such a higher level now  so this kind of indifference will cost this business. We went to WhataBurger down the street and the order was perfect.
Jack in the Box,22,Saw a male and female employees hiding behind a door and neither came out to help me even though the drive thru is supposed to be open 24 hours. Absolutely ridiculous.
Jack in the Box,23,Man  This place rule I got a lot of snacks here. First I got good practice at ordering bc they let me say the order three times. No taco sauce bc I guess they didn t want my mouth get burn. Then food was all cold bc again they didn t want my mouth get burn  I like eat here bc it feels like a baby cooked the food for u 
Jack in the Box,24,Jack in the Box curly fries are the best hangover cure ever   Hands down.  Another awesome perk of Jack in the Box  all day breakfast   This place has really got me as a hangover haven. This east Austin location has never been busy when I have gone there and I have never gotten the wrong order  a minor miracle at a fast food drive through . The cheeseburgers are good too according to my carnivorous roommate  and don t forget the milkshake    Don t leave off the curly fries though  they are crunchy greasy delicious.  I often make the trip just for them.
Jack in the Box,25,They have always gotten my order incorrect the 3 times I have been here. I just ordered 4 tacos  fry  and drink. I only received 2 of the tacos I ordered. I will not be back to this location.
Jack in the Box,26,stuffed jalape os dry and taste like cardboard.
Jack in the Box,27,it is what is its.  If you ever been to a Jack in the Crack then you know what to expect.  This location does have some very nice staff and that is why this place gets 3 stars
Jack in the Box,28,Sucks everthing sucks food cold all suck giant balls just because it s night time doesn t give you the right to fuck People s orders up
Taco Luna,1,Located on the property of EZ Stop  Tacos Luna is a great Austin owned small business to support   The gentleman making the tacos is the Michelangelo of taco making.   Since it is a small truck  the options for variety are limited  but he makes up for that with the how delicious he makes the tacos   Tacos are about  2 and well portioned  Be sure to tip your taco man so he can stay in business and support his family   Definitely recommend  and will be back for the quality of the food and to update for photos 
Taco Luna,2,Unassuming taco truck. Good breakfast tacos and VERY hot red sauce  so be careful of that. Bacon egg was good with flour tortillas but bacon was sparsely chopped up  I prefer whole pieces.  Potato egg was good  nice real potato chunks.  Everything made to order.  Has a phone number on truck to call ahead for orders.  Has lunch tacos  fajitas  offered too.
Taco Luna,3,Very yummy tacos in an unassuming food truck. Cash or credit. Friendly and quick service.
taco wey,1,This trailer is in the parking lot of the car wash.  I m focusing on the al pastor tacos in this review.   I LOVE them. I try pastor all over town and these are in my top 5. I was introduced to this trailer by the bartender next door at Donn s Depot. She specifically recommended the pastor. She was right  I ve been back several times since then and they re always delicious
taco wey,2,Got the worst food poisoning ever from the location on West 6th. Would not wish the experience on anyone.
taco wey,3,These tacos are really good and I should know because i have had many a taco in my time. The Al Pastor was particularly scrumptious. I think you have to ask for pineapple which is a little strange because pineapple is usually on them already. But I have to say they were really really good and will be going back soon.
taco wey,4,This is hands down the Best taco truck in Austin  I live in leander and make the drive for the AL Pastor. Great flavor  not crazy greasy like other tacos. Everything is delicious. You won t be disappointed.
Queen's Tacos,1,Run  don t walk   There are many mediocre food options around UT  and even chain locations around the drag are always lacking compared to other locations. This place is above and beyond. The breakfast tacos are huge  made to order  and the salsa is A . This was one of the best meals I have had while on the UT campus in a really long time.
Queen's Tacos,2,Ordered a chicken fajita plate with corn tortillas. The plate came with a generous amount of chicken  grilled green peppers and onions  rice  beans  pico  avocado  lettuce  homemade tortillas  and two variations of salsa. Chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The rice and beans were great as well. All of the side ingredients were fresh. The best part  I think  was the salsa.   Both the green and red salsa were great  but the red salsa took the dish to a different level. It was a perfect balance of spice and flavor that added a new and vibrant dimension to the experience of the dish itself.   5 5  Will return regularly.
Jack in the Box,1,Its Jack in the Box. I dont know why  but I keep coming back. At this location  the employees arent quite as stupid as the other locations. The tall black guy cashier is actually pretty good at his job. Im sure he kind find a better job elsewhere. Also  it has three outlets so you can charge your phones. Most of the food here is cheap. And its conveniently located in the Hancock center so parking is not an issue.   But like most Jack in the Box locations  the food is mostly crappy  the bathrooms are disgusting  and most of the employees are retarded.
Jack in the Box,2,I was about to order until i went into the restroom and saw toilets clogged  no toilet paper and roaches on the ground. I don t even want to imagine what their kitchen is like.
Jack in the Box,3,I d really like to just give this location zero stars but at least the curly fries were cooked decently. The sourdough jack they produced was an abomination. I know fast food establishments are hurting at the moment but it s shouldn t be this difficult to execute a burger. The girl working the drive thru also clearly hated her life. Avoid this location at all costs.
Jack in the Box,4,As of right now 1 Star. I ve never been to a Jack in the Box before and it is not off to a good start. They are out of mozzarella sticks. Ridiculous. I will be back soon with an update. UPDATE   I got tacos and curtly fries. The fires were small for the price and not very good. The tacos were only ok but my second taco got stuck in the bag and ripped. The only good part of the jack in the box is my man.
Jack in the Box,5,THIS LOCATION is terrible. THEY DONT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR. The overnight staff refuse to take orders. They will pretend to not have any of the food you want because they don t want to make anything at night. I deliver for Uber from time to time and tonight I received at least 5 orders from this location  at separate times . Each time I arrived with a new order  they told me that they did not have any of them. I wouldn t order from here because of how lazy the employees are  they will do the bare minimum.
Jack in the Box,6,Should always acknowledge your customers even during a shift change. Instead of letting sit in the drive thru without saying a thing. You should still be able to service during a shift change.
Jack in the Box,7,Two employees laughed about pissing in my water during covid-19. A new manager named Cecil and a female who refused to tell me who she was no uniform name tag. Said none of my business. Called police officers for saying they contaminated my food during covid-19 also took video of them both handing me a water telling me it had piss in it. All because I asked for a free large water or agreed to pay for the large cup. Argued they could only give me a medium free. When I asked for two medium free cups if they will not let me pay for a large cup 1.00 then they laughed here is your free large water with piss. Tried to charge me  4.00 for water.... then said he is a large. Contaminating a persons food not a funny joke police were called.
Jack in the Box,8,I ve been here a few times  and it s usually on late nights. Food is typical fast food stuff. Menu has a wide variety of things you can try. Service is decent. The wait can be a tad long  but it s never been anything crazy. My personal experiences here have been more positive than not  and I know this depends on the time and service. Another standard fast food location - average rating overall.
Jack in the Box,9,I don t usually write reviews even for places that aren t great but this was beyond the pale. Went through the drive through 9 pm with no other cars. Ordered a chicken fajita pita and large curly fries and it took over 10 minutes.  I haven t been to a jack in the box in years but I don t remember it being this bad. Tiny  barely filled pita with a few scraps of chicken and the large curly fries was small  smaller than the medium fries at places like chic fil a. For the 10 dollars it cost me  I could have gotten more and better food literally anywhere else in a one mile radius. Never going to a jack in the box again.
Jack in the Box,10,Don t see why so many bad reviews.  Just a normal Jack.  Love that they have breakfast 24hrs.  If you happen to like Whataburger s BOB sandwiches  then I recommend their  27.  It is very much like it and but has 2 sausages. Can t go wrong with that and the fact that you can get them at anytime of the day makes that much better.  This location is walking distance to my place  which is dangerous  but so far I have managed to refrain from frequenting too much. At least too much in my opinion.  Have yet to try most of the other items here since I tend to just have my regular when I decide to be bad.  The drive-thru here has always been pretty quick.    Credit card accepted at drive-thru. Friendly staff.
Jack in the Box,11,Not just bad...truly horrific. Service is unimaginably bad at times  there s a good chance you ll encounter a vagrant in the restroom  and you ll likely struggle  to find a clean table inside.
Jack in the Box,12,I use the drive thru to order a small sized French fries. The guy misunderstood us and give us a sprite instead. I were surprised that they give free drinks for ordering only a fries  but later realized they missed our order. The guy was update before I can him for correcting the mistake.   Bad experience. Will not recommend if you just want to save time and order a quick meal.
Jack in the Box,13,I was in the Drive Thru line this morning for 30 minutes in the same spot   I could not move because there was no way out and I really thought about driving off when I finally got to the window but still tried to give them the benefit of the doubt...well I was wrong  I finally get to the window and the lady confirms my order of just a  Sausage Croissant  and I tell her yes. She gives me my food and I was so mad and in a hurry that I just drove off. When I arrived at work I opened the box and there was no sausage at all  Really   How is it called a Sausage Croissant without Sausage   Must have asked for too much...
Jack in the Box,14,One of my favorite Jack in the Boxes. Nice employees  always there and the food is always done well. Shame I don t visit this place as much as I did in Q4 2016 to Q1 2018.
Jack in the Box,15,Always slow. The person s  working can never seem to understand you. The wait is ridiculous. I waited almost an hour to order in the drive through  I was boxed in . I ended up changing my mind and had to get out of my car to ask the one person in front of me to move since they can t seem to manage that part right either. Avoid it if possible this jack in the crack is terrible. Go to another one.
Jack in the Box,16,I drop by here every once in awhile n the late night hours to get me an oreo shake n every time i go their machine is working n i get my shake. Wait times can be epic but for sure they have shakes. I don t know why other jacks dont keep their machine up all night.
Jack in the Box,17,Omg..I know you shouldn t expect nothing less than crappy rude customer service when it comes to fast food...but this place...the ungrateful employee working the drive through obviously has more important things to do than provide customer service. She was rude..ungrateful for her employment and towards her employer. Shame shame on her...it wouldn t surprise me if that was an ungrateful manager
Jack in the Box,18,Don t come here. Even if your desperate for something late at night. I went to this location and went through the drive thru. I order a croissant sandwich with bacon. The person taking orders couldn t wrap her head around it that I wanted bacon instead of sausage. The same person who took my order. I paid at the window. I had to correct her again at the window and I gave her a 20 and she didn t give me the correct change back. She thought I paid with a 10. She didn t remember what she did or gave me. I had to help her out. It took 20 minutes to get my food and I top of that I go food poisoning. STAY AWAY. NOT WORTH IT.
Jack in the Box,19,I know  it s a Jack in the Box  what do you expect  The lady working drive thru could at least do one thing right like split the price of the entire order in half among the two cards I handed her. Nope  all under one card and when asked if it was split up  she lied. Orders were messed up and they took forever. Never going to this one again and recommend anyone else thinking about it to go to a different one.
Jack in the Box,20,While this location offers my lovely 100 drink option soda machine...what a beautiful thing... The location itself is small  dingy  a little dirty. The staff  were less than pleased to be working there. One actually gave me a disapproving look when I ordered just a drink. Hey chick all I want is the drink  JIB foods aren t allowed for me right. Deal with it       This is completely different than my experiences at the JIBs in Buda abs Kyle. Much nicer people and atmosphere there.
Jack in the Box,21,Horrible place to eat and an even worst place to work. I only worked there for a few weeks because the store manager Dede was very rude  unprofessional and loud all the time. It wasn t worth the  9 per hour I was getting paid. Very easy job though. No complaints at all about that.
Jack in the Box,22,As I ve done in the past  on rushed mornings I ll come through this drive through for a coke and call it breakfast.  The drive-through Line looked lengthy and in the past  they e not given me the right order  so I just parked and walked inside.  Standing in line were a man  behind him a mother and daughter  and me.  A lady behind the counter said  I ll be with you in a min.   She was busy taking drive through orders.  The man left.  I played with my phone  finally the woman and daughter left.  I stood there a bit longer and the lady said again  I ll be with you in a min.   I glanced at my phone and realized that in 10 mins  I d still not placed an order and simply walked out.  The scene in the kitchen was complete chaos.  There was one cook who desperately kept glancing at the screen and was literally slamming things together.  The woman taking drive through orders would come out and put things in the fryer or microwave.  Trying to multi task she would take orders and then when she walked back to the window try to remember them as she entered them...  Also refusing to make eye contact with anyone behind the counter which had now grown to me and another man who was a bit disgruntled because he waited forever to get his quick  fast  food  and the order was wrong.  I can t speak for customer service at any other time of day than before 8am.  If you re in a rush  this location isn t worth waiting for.
Jack in the Box,23,So  I come here almost every morning because their iced hazelnut coffee is like crack. I can t get enough even though it isn t made on the premises  yeah  it comes in a bag which they pour into a pitcher. Don t judge . On a typical day  the people here are pretty fast  though you get the occasional stoner who will ask random questions like  do you want jelly  when you order a breakfast taco.   My favorite things to order here are the hash browns and curly fries. So I love potatoes  bite me. Their tacos are also little envelopes of greasy goodness after a night out. Oh and -1 star for Helga or whatever her name is for not wanting to top off my iced coffee with regular coffee. When I asked her why  she said  because we don t want you to get sick . What even.
Jack in the Box,24,This place messes up often. The latest and most likely the last time I went  I went to drive through for breakfast.  I ordered the sausage egg and cheese biscuit. Got my order shortly. Drove down the street where I took a bite in my sandwich.  It was VERY CRUNCHY.  I kept chewing until I realized it was way to much crunch and spit it out. There were egg shells in the food that I had spit into the napkin and some remained inside sandwhich. Took it back and all the lady said was sorry. I looked at her puzzled for a sec and preceded to ask for my money back. I was pretty pissed.  Horrible customer service and food.
Jack in the Box,25,I was dying of thirst stopped in and lo and behold a fancy  shamzy Coke dispenser wow .as a SXSW  out of towner taking pictures with the Coke machine  hmm so I just had to ask where you from   he replied  Chicago and we don t have this type of Coke machine. 
Jack in the Box,26,Are you aware Austin that the posted prices are NOT the correct price you are charged for. The other morning I went to get a breakfast deal  two crescents for  3.00 as advertised. But they had no sausage that morning  What  its only 9am and they are out of sausage  Whatever... so I decided to get the combo for  3.59 they asked what I would like for a drink and I said a juice  when the total was rang up it came to  3.99 I noticed that I was not billed the  3.59 for the combo but  3.69 that s ten cents over when I asked why the employee said the drink is extra  He then pointed out to the top of the menu board in small print the  combos  do not include drinks  I just think this is miss-leading the public and we are being nickled and dimed to death  Think about it if this is happening here its happening all over the country and people are not aware of it and jack in the Box is making extra out of our ignorants.   Just thought you should know 
Jack in the Box,27,my fried egg sandwich was condensed to the point that it was oozing grease  and the egg was literally MOLDY. disgusting.
Ta-co. Mex,1,Such sweet ladies with DELICIOUS food. My boyfriend and I stopped by for a mini lunch as we were traveling. The asada was sold out when we got there so it MUST be good. We snagged the last pastor and barbacoa  and man oh man it was delicious. Can t wait to stop by again 
Ta-co. Mex,2,I go here on my lunch break it s a great place. Priced fairly  amp  everything on the menu is good  love their burritos.
Delicious Tamales,1,Heard about these tamales in December. Apparently they are famous San Antonio tamales for 40 years  and they just recently opened an Austin location. The person that recommended them has been a patron of the San Antonio location for years  and she was so excited they were expanding to Austin.   Stopped by there today  and had a great visit. The shop is super clean and organized  The gentleman behind the counter was extremely pleasant and helpful. I didn t want to get too crazy  so I picked up a 1 2 dozen of chicken tamales. My friend had the original tamale  pork . The price is AMAZING 1 2 a dozen under  10  That s fantastic almost unheard of  We were both instantly in love with Delicious Tamales  Will definitely return  and try some of the other selections. Thank You for bringing some delicious tamales to Austin 
Delicious Tamales,2,I had a dozen delivered for my first time ever trying this place and I was very disappointed  the masa was soggy because of too much grease and condensation  and the pork filling was minimal. This was an overall small  soggy  greasy tamale. The pork also didn t taste very fresh. The store didn t even bother to add a small salsa cup which is customary in Mexican tex-mex cuisine. This could easily be a 1 star review because the tamales are that bad.
Delicious Tamales,3,I really want to like this place. The guy at the counter was kind. The tamales just dont quite do it for me. They re small  barely have any filling in them  and on the pricey side. The flavor is good but I ve had much better for much cheaper.
Delicious Tamales,4,It was okay they are small the masa was a little dry it s not much meat inside to me HEB makes better ones
Delicious Tamales,5,Fast  friendly and oh so good.  The best tamales this side of Nuevo Laredo.  Tried the pork and jalapeno.  With over 6 million sold storewide they must be doing something right.  To paraphrase Arnold   I ll be back .
Delicious Tamales,6,First time there- had heard alot about the san Antonio location. Just like the name says     The guy behind the counter rolled a few up for me that had just gotten done and he was very personable.. All around great experience.
Jack in the Box,1,They must have had the same gal at the drive-thru window that the guy in 2012 experience.  Friendly and cheerful  but not over the top - she go me jsut what I needed and even recommended a condiment that was perfect.
Jack in the Box,2,By far one of the worst Jack in the Box nationwide. They re open  24 7   however  you go on a weekday after midnight and good luck finding anyone working. If you do manage to get someone to work there after midnight all they serve is burgers only. No fries  no ice with my drink NOTHING. Not even breakfast..... WHAT    The chick said all they had available is burgers.   I settled on getting a burger and they still couldn t even get that right. I asked for a plain jr Jumbo Jack and received the works with everything on it. Unbelievable 
Jack in the Box,3,Open till when   I took a video of them walking around looking completely stoned and pretending to be busy. No response from the box or the window. I m gonna gonna go in there and have my food sabotaged. Check this off the list people.
Jack in the Box,4,Waited 20 min just to get to the voice box and another 10 trying to get someone say anything at all in response. No luck. So I just pulled ford without speaking to any one  like the couple cars before me. And the was not. Long line  only about 4 ahead of me. Looks like another 20min before I can even try placing an order.
Jack in the Box,5,No way this place is open for business to feed people. We went last night and spent 45 mins in the drive thru which by the way we did not really mind. I mean if there only one person working no problem they can take their time. But even after 45 minutes the orders were wrong  mine had bacon in it and I m Muslim and never had pork in my life until last night. No curly fries  ok I can live with that but no cup holders  I had to put two drinks in my lap which kept spilling while I drove. I just don t know how could this places go any lower. So can you please for the love of god shut it down  get some new employees  train them well  pay them well  and then open again. Because what s happening there is borderline criminal.
Jack in the Box,6,This jack in the box has given me the worst fast food experiences of my life. Every time I go there it s a disappointment  the employees are always rude and unpleasant. No matter how nice you are to them they always have a nasty attitude. Just left this location at 2 11am and had no luck  waited 15 minutes at the voice box and nobody ever took my order  I was on my way out when an employee walked outside and yelled at me that the restaurant was closed and that his manager was in the back  Um jack in the box is covered in signs advertising that they are 24 hours  So it s obvious they don t want to work and just want to chill on the clock and get paid for free.
Jack in the Box,7,Ridiculous my order was wrong came back twice and the kid said she was training the lady deep frying tacos has a sports bra on the phone and laughing. She closex the window refused to get my order ready and stated there was no manager to help with my refund because she was not trained on it. Very bad customer service.
Jack in the Box,8,First off the outside appearance is tragic. One of the drive thru menus is completely torn apart with its menu scattered across the parking lot.. definitely not keeping Austin green. The drive thru menu directly behind the speaker was fully intact so I pulled up to place my Togo order to never hear anyone respond on the other side  and after patiently waiting and looking around for posted signs for guidance from staff and seeing none  I pulled up to the pick up window where I was greeted immediately by an employee who quickly opened the window and looked at me like I was crazy. After an awkward silence I started to place my order and was then I was told I would have to come inside. I asked if the drive through was closed to hear that it was at the moment... Lol so y all wouldn t think to put a sign up    Smh I definitely did not go inside after that and decided I probably would regret eating food from there anyways.
Jack in the Box,9,Rude loud people. No customer service at all.  The cashier was rude. This place is the worse
Jack in the Box,10,No stars if I could  the food isn t the issue it s the service  ...........................................................
Jack in the Box,11,Kiya or kia  either way she was very sweet  amp  basically carried those orders in her own  she gave me fresh food like i asked  amp  was just over all down to earth  I love that 
Jack in the Box,12,They re drive thru was open and I never got assisted when inside worker had no name shirt tail out and his first words to me was  what s up  and continually kept saying what s up instead hey how s it going welcome to Jack and box. They didn t even have enough change to break a  5 meal I wouldn t recommend this location to anyone
Jack in the Box,13,DO NOT COME HERE  the people that work here are rude  loud  will purposely mess up your order and not give you the food that you ve payed for   they will make you pay for it but they won t give it to you   Seriously don t spend your money here  it s horrible.
Jack in the Box,14,I come here all the time during my lunch break  but today s interaction left a sour taste in my mouth.   The person taking my order came off as really rude  smelled like smoke  and didn t offer any kind of customer service. When she double charged me for an item she simply stated that a manager wasn t available and couldn t refund me. When I asked if she could text or call her manager she just said  no  I can t.   So when I state that being overcharged for an item is kind of a crappy experience  and that I really would  please  like a refund she just kinda stared off in the distance. In the end a coworker working the drive noticed the situation and promptly refunded me.... and she wasn t the manager.   When she brought my food out it was in a bag  she tossed it on the counter and said  here .   It takes a lot for me to post a review  the whole thing left me in a huge mood   
Jack in the Box,15,Literally everything was out the drinks the fries the staff  Got the opposite size of everything I ordered and the wait was 15 minutes per person seriously wasted 20 dollars for 10 dollars of stuff. Bs. Thanks Austin
Jack in the Box,16,I work down the street and around 1 00 am 1 10 2020 my wife went and orders 3 eggs rolls that were warm not hot. A  3 large curly fries and a  7 large curly fries. The burger meat was like it have been sitting up a lap or.somethinf. I was dry and not tasteful at all. I asked for sour dough and got a regular bun instead with condiments just slapped on. My wife s burger was dry and hard  The fries weren t fresh they had been sitting and looked and tasted like they were redunked on grease. I even asked for no ice and guess what  I got ice. No one was in front of us and no one was behind us. So if a customer ask for fresh   make it as such. Don t just give me whatever. I m paying my money I work hard for just to be given 2 bad orders. Not cool man. Yall need w people to work at this time if it can t be done right. I call no answers and the VM is full. Y all have make this right. Not
Jack in the Box,17,Love Jack in the box normally  but the past two times of come to this location at night they say they don t have a cook and can t take any orders. What a waste of time.  Just hide in the back and turn off the lights if you are going to slack for the night.
Jack in the Box,18,This place is disgusting. We had a drink from here HI - C small and Jesus gave it to us. I drank some from the cup without the straw because there was no straw. Then my boyfriend asks what s in the cup when he was going to drink it and in between the ice is a small flying insect. I will not eat here again
Jack in the Box,19,They are open  but they really shouldn t be. The past three times I ve been here they have messed up my order in some way  but tonight was the worst. I ordered an Oreo shake and those bacon loaded curly fries. Here s what I got  a chocolate shake and cheese fries. The receipt got my order right but the food was way off. This is getting annoying and I know it s just Jack In the Box so no big deal  but when it s 2am and you re craving something greasy  you gotta do what you gotta do. But this place is not worth it at all.
Jack in the Box,20,Never again  Ordered a Jumbo Jack w  cheese combo  extra pickles and egg rolls. What did I get  A Jumbo Jack w  possibly cheese   but I couldn t tell cause it had already melted into the bun  extra onions  not extra pickles  my egg rolls and NO FRIES.  Tried to call the store and surprise surprise no one answers the phone and the mailbox is full.  No wonder people call Jack in the Box Jack in the Crack  because this store must be snorting it to be so stupid.
Jack in the Box,21,CAN ONLY COOK FRIED THINGS TONIGHT  We waited in the drive thru for 25 minutes for them to tell us this after we left the other  CLOSED  location on burnet   ....then ordered 2 number 6  ultimate cheeseburgers  with large fries they said they can do the fries or chicken but the grill guy didn t show up   So no one knows how to cook on a grill  Do you cook at home   If not that s sad  if so  then you should know how to cook a burger patty          So not happy   After leaving another Jack in the Box  are you the next McDonald s that never has anything working      What is going on         I AM NOT HAPPY GET IT TOGETHER
Jack in the Box,22,THIS RESTAURANT IS NOT CLOSED    They are under staffed and have extremely DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE   I was told to wait an hour for the cook to get there   Ridiculous. The lady  working  at the microphone had an attitude about responding to inquiries about management and how many were usually on staff   DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE   I have eaten at this specific location and the staff is just horrible  they seem to hate their job s  as much as they hate your service.
Jack in the Box,23,Do not bother coming here AT ALL   Not only can they not give you anything that you order  not even a soft drink or a milkshake  but they also can not provide you with a manager to speak with. How the hell do you have an establishment open that NEVER has a manager   Clearly they aren t doing well. I haven t been able to order anything here for 4 months now.
Jack in the Box,24,U guys are always cool. But I paid for a bunch of stuff and the jumbo jack and gravy fell through the cracks.
Jack in the Box,25,Very unprofessional staff. Was not greeted  then saw staff not wearing a mask and the girl at the cash register was talking on her cellphone while I was waiting at the counter. She did not hang up the phone  instead she put it on speaker while she got the foot ready. Meaning  after she put on gloves  she was touching her phone and the food. Would not recommend this location as that all leads me to believe they are unsanitary.
Jack in the Box,26,The staff dont work not working 24 7 the are just listing the honk and ignoring totally wreck less and dis respectful and they are not 24 they workers just work when ever they want  and the guy was having sex in the shop ans ignoring customers
Jack in the Box,27,My God  the buns are glossed and crisp. The pop is carbonated to perfection. The curly fries are the only ones that should exist. The management is insanely good at their job and I m pretty sure they have 5-star chefs preparing the food. Service is great. Oh yeah  and anyone who says this place is trash  is probably trash to begin with.
Jack in the Box,28,This was the first time I have been to this jack in the box and may be my last time to this location. Since all jack in the box have the same food  its better I think to mention that this one was BUSY during lunch  the line to order was to the door and the line to get the food wound around the lobby. Other than that it was clean  easy to get into  although depending on what way you need to turn leaving the parking lot it could be a hassle  but that would apply to all the other businesses in that complex.  I remember about 11 years ago  making late night runs to jack in the box  and ordering ten or more items off the menu just to go home and not eat them all. As I have grown I go to jack in the box less and less and some how this growing I have done is really shrinking in the waist.  If you must eat at jack in the box  do so in moderation  because although you can order 10 tacos for 5   you probably don t want to.
Jack in the Box,29,Man  should have went to a different location. Came here on a Saturday evening   7pm  . Barely any customers  but took awhile for the good to come out. When food came out  everything was good. What prompts a 2  rating is the lack of attention given to the dining area. Walked around looking for a clean table. Was lucky to find one out of the whole dinning area   20    tables  Plus  employees would disappear outside after delivering order. Have been here in the past and this place wasn t as bad as it is as of this review. May be just the timing  hour  or crew....who knows
Jack in the Box,30,Listed as 24 hours. Arrived at 3am after a long day of driving only to see cars in parking spots with the lights off in the restaurant and no service at the drive-thru. Figure it out.
Jack in the Box,31,Going here reminds me why I never go to jack in the box.  Gross food and worse staff.
Jack in the Box,32,This Jack was out of all burgers and soda.... haha what  If you re gonna stay open 24 hours  have your stuff together. Absolutely ridiculous
Jack in the Box,33,Barfffff      Only thing open around midnight close to where I was.Everything I ordered went straight into the trash.   Total waste of money.
Jack in the Box,34,This Jack is the best.  They were on point   I just wanted five pc nuggets and they gave me two bbq sauce.  What   That s right.  Two   And I got napkins   For realz.  This is the best Jack I ve been to 
Jack in the Box,35,Fair on service they were noticeably not happy by the lack of smiles. Food was what to be expected but it was served lukewarm. Overall experience 2stars at best
Jack in the Box,36,Let me start by saying that I d eat razor blades if I had to work fast food another day in my life. I don t expect the employees  Have you been back there  Terrible conditions   to be pleasant  so I was more than shocked when I rolled down the line and the girl at the window turned out to be nice  and smiley  I don t ever expect the employees to smile. I don t ever really expect the food to be good  or hot  or even have the right order in my bag when I pull away. I m mainly just happy to have some combination of meet  cheese and bread that costs under  10 and will satisfy me until my next feeding. Jack In the Box  you have raised my expectations tonight. Can you keep up  Probably not  so I m writing to remember this night forever... The girl working the drive through was nice as can be. She smiled  she giggled  she must have been new. When I got my order  it was correct  Two Ultimate Breakfast Sandwiches for only  6 and some change  Can t make a fat kid happier than that  They were hot  yummy  and tasted fresh. It didn t seem like they had been sitting under a warmer for years. So  friendly staff  good food  good price....why not five stars  I m still getting over all of the other visits that were botched. It takes time to heal  Jack.
Jack in the Box,37,My food was delicious  but my father didn t like his. Drinks are horrible  and the ice machine doesn t work. Fries weren t very good. I think this is the last time I m coming here.
Jack in the Box,38,Cleanest bathroom I ve seen at a fast food place in years 
Jack in the Box,39,make sure you double check your bag. i got all my food but no ketchup  no ranch  no salt  no napkins  nothing. and they even asked me if i wanted that stuff and i said yes. thanks for the dry lunch
Pelonchas Tacos,1,Highly Recommend this FOOD TRUCK. Insanely crazy kick ss tacos. The house-made tortillas has l veled it sky high. Must try.   Cheff David
Pelonchas Tacos,2,Updating my review after trying this homemade corn tortillas because omg they are truly the best I ve ever had. Wow  Must try 
Taqueria Tuzantla,1,Drove by this Taco Trailer and noticed the name Tuzantla which sounded very Indigenous Mexico to me. Went there today and it was Excellent  Fresh made Corn Tortillas  lots of well cooked meat stuffed in Tortillas  Spicy Fiery Salsa  Friendly Staff  amp  Covered Table where U can Dine Al Fresco on Ohlen Road. Refried Bean Crispy Thick Bacon  Flavorful Carnitas  amp  Tender Chicarron Tacos pictured. Yall know I will be back for more  Open 6am to 11pm  Ohlen   Peyton Gin intersection Dr Wiley Coyote SFO...
Taqueria Tuzantla,2,Found this place by accident on my Austin Taco Tour and OMG this place is delicious and authentic   The corn tortillas are PERFECTION and they dress the Gordita s up so well with beans  avocado  lettuce  and tomato s with cotija. The meats were also delicious we had pollo fajita tacos and the pollo was so flavorful  The barbacoa meat is A MUST HAVE  it literally melts in your mouth and it isn t chewy   10 10 
Jazmin’s Cafe,1,los mejores tacos de atx  Me gustan muchooooo. Mi novio y yo siempre vamos para la cena. me encanta como las salsas y cebollas y cilantro estan afuera de food truck  cerce de las sillas para los clientes. buenos precios tambien
Jazmin’s Cafe,2,This is a new food truck that opened last week  first week of August  and it is so delicious  I tried it today for the first time and the two women were so nice and helpful. My friend and I ordered tacos  tacos de pastor  tacos de pollo y tacos de carnitas . All of them were so delicious and authentic  I would highly recommend   Te verdad la comida es autentico. Mi gusto mucho  los tacos y los vasos de fruta con chile h lim n. Voy a regresar a tratar m s de la comida ah .
Jazmin’s Cafe,3,I did not like the attention and they take a long time to serve you apart from q they also take up to 15 minutes to prepare your food.  The tacos are not quibalentes at what they cost  the roasted sebollitas are only pure leaves without seeds  the fresh water is hot and pure water.  I do not recommend this place.
El Rey Del Taco,1,quite literally the best tasting breakfast tacos i have ever had. this place is a MUST for me each time i come to visit austin. definitely recommend  
El Rey Del Taco,2,Holy freakin moses. Most authentic  best tasting tacos in Austin. 2 bucks  really unbeatable 
Mama'S Tacos,1,Delicious.  Spent the weekend in Austin and had Mama s Tacos every morning  Some of the best breakfast tacos I ve had and they had plenty of options to pick from everyday.   I highly recommend trying the papaya water on a nice warm day  so refreshing. They also make their own horchata  if you have a sweet tooth its worth a try but be warned you get a BIG size.
Mama'S Tacos,2,Great place to bring the kids the area is gated and safe. The food is delucious and Im coming back. today is menudo day.
Jack in the Box,1,There chicken nuggets are always crispy and my girl loves their breakfast jacks   So bomb
Jack in the Box,2,Just had the most disgusting burger I ve ever had in my life. That new cheddar bun burger was TERRIBLE. Old dry bland gross  the quality of jack in the box beef is soooo bad. Terrible. The lady who works the drive thru is highly unpleasant and always has an attitude and knows no manners.
Jack in the Box,3,Never open and they always refuse service. Says open 24 7 but they don t answer at the order window after 9pm...it s ridiculous honestly. They don t even tell you that they re closed when you pull in because they re not ACTUALLY closed. They need a serious inspection. The one time I did get service the guy at the window asked me if I wanted to buy a dog    So random and so weird. Close this location or rehire. DON T WASTE YOUR TIME.
Jack in the Box,4,Horrible horrible horrible  Every time we go the order is wrong. I had surgery today and asked my husband for something I didn t have to cook. They screwed it up and forgot his whole food order so I drove back myself and they wouldn t fix the order. No manager there to speak with  and there was a language barrier. When you look in the back  the cook looks so dirty  so it is best just to never eat here again  so I drove off.
Jack in the Box,5,So let s start with the bad. The food is terrible. Like legitimately inedible terrible. Like everything I got was horrendous. The combo fries were cold and disgusting. The tacos were impressively bad. Like realize they are frozen and microwaved but they had to be frozen for a couple of years and nuked several times over that period to be this bad. And the chicken tater crap sandwich was doused in gross cheese. I definitely maximized the amount of cheese I could buy. The ratio of cheese to price was astronomical. The resale value of that cheese had to be more than the  6 I paid for the meal. Even the soda sucked. What trash.   But then I thought  is it fair to give this place one star when the service was solid and prompt and well  it s a Jack-in-the-Box. What do you expect  Is it really fair to give it one star  And then I had a daydream nightmare about that cheese encapsulating my poor heart and smashing it to death. And the garbage aftertaste I had that tasted the same as the garbage taste of when I ate it to begin with. I wasn t capable of taking more than two bites of anything and considering the stuff I ve choked down in my life  that s impressive. What a piece of crap place.   Feel free to come and enjoy the cuisine. All I can say is that you won t see me there when you stop by.
Jack in the Box,6,Would be fantastic if you knew when they were open  Half the time you come to the drive thru at 1030pm and you get no response  Even the pot heads next door at Taco Bell can highly give you some food  Tonight  it s 9 45 and I pull up and am told the place is closed. What the fuck  Are you guys trying to be Burger King in the 2000 s  If so  you got this in the bag  I can  only  fathom what kind of general manager runs this area of town to even think things like this is acceptable. Get it together Jack  or don t come back.
Jack in the Box,7,I was there 2 minutes ago and same was told they weren t accepting orders for some reason I live down the street from this location and there is always something going wrong. On top of that they are rude when announcing their excuse as to why they aren t taking orders.
Jack in the Box,8,This place needs new management ASAP. Garbage night employees basically getting paid to smoke in their car all night and tell people that the 24 7 drive thru is  closed .
Jack in the Box,9,Went at 10PM  amp  they said they were closed  I m quite confused. Is this a Covid thing  Maybe. Never had a 24 hour place closed at this hour before for prep...
Jack in the Box,10,Once again won t stop emailing me so I m doing this on nationwide all stores they won t stop emailing me even from a block list so here s one star onto the next
Jack in the Box,11,The cashier talks over you the entire time you re trying to order. Tells you information you don t even need to hear about and acts like she couldn t be bothered with your order. Please hire someone else that actually knows how to listen and not talk over you and that actually has a personality aside from just trying to hurry you along when there aren t even any other cars in the line or people inside. This isn t my first interaction with this woman. I get it  it s fast food  but be a decent human  you work in the hospitality industry  customer service is key    
Jack in the Box,12,Went at 5PM. Waited at the speaker for someone to answer. No one did. Drove to the window. No one was inside. Some women shuffled in looked like they were starting their shifts. They didn t say anything to us while  we waited at the window to place an order. Finally a maintenance guy working on something made a cut throat signal at me to let us know that they were closed. I understand that maybe they weren t able to take any orders  But I don t see why we couldn t have been notified instead of sitting there waiting to place an order.
Jack in the Box,13,This merchant is smily but sooo much slow . If its drive thru that means u must be quick but one order cannot take 30 minutes . Respect your job and do it well or stop it .
Jack in the Box,14,If you want your food consistently burned  amp  really rude drive through employees  than this is the place for you. I can t see this location staying open.
Jack in the Box,15,This place is terrible  I live near by this location. The staff is absolutely awful in the evening and rude. They don t listen to your order correctly through the intercom. They have a conversation with someone else in the background while taking your ORDER   I don t know if cell phones are allowed while a customer is present or if a customer or other people are in the building after 11pm -12am. BUT  It is just rude   Especially when you have to repeat your order more than three times. I REALIZED I didn t want to give this company my money. If the service was this terrible  I can just imagine my FOOD   My advice  don t go to this location ever  Go to whataburger or p.terrys   Also  this is the SECOND TIME I ve had this type of service at this location.
Jack in the Box,16,Wasted a lot of money coming here over and over again to recieve soggy burgers and fries and watery shakes
Jack in the Box,17,It s on my way to work  so despite my annoyance  I ve been there dozens of times in the past few years  and it s a minor miracle when then everything is actually working and the order is accurate. Some of the issues I ve encountered  broken speaker at the drive thru  not having any shakes  not having any napkins  not having any ketchup  I don t think they know how to order enough supplies for weekends   and when I order anything with bacon  there s a 50-50 chance it will have sausage on it instead. If you don t enjoy the pure comedy of  How will they mess it up this time   Take the next turnaround and hit up Whataburger on the other side of the highway instead.
Jack in the Box,18,The plant in front of the the store. When you come out of the drive thru the plant is blocking to view you have to pull out blind into very busy traffic. Cut the plant back.
Jack in the Box,19,Set at the drive-through menu for like 10 minutes with no greeting or request to give them a second to complete their only other order in the drive through. I said hello then a very rude hardly English-speaking person told me to  hold on .   she made it not worth my business    Fast food  bullshit
Jack in the Box,20,Where do I start. When I first pulled up to the drive through I asked the lady to give us a moment to look at the menu. While we still looking  she kept saying  let me know when you re ready  like every 30 seconds  rushing us. When we finally order she was being really rude  I m like  what is wrong with her     I was being as polite as possible so I m tryna figure out why she s being rude. Anyways  my mom got the buttery jack and there was no veggies on it. She didn t even give us the receipt so we can t even go back up there to get it fixed. Worst  25 ever spent.
Jack in the Box,21,Worst place to get food there service is really bad with rude employees working not only that the speaker on the drive thru is very low were you can barely even hear someone talk from it  but on the bright side their food at least comes out hot
Jack in the Box,22,I went to this Jack in the Box to order food just now and try to use a coupon code. Times are hard and all I had was the amount on the coupon which was five dollars. The coupon code wasn t working and I was sitting in the drive-through I tried another code which still didn t work and so I had to say sorry I don t have enough to pay the full price just cancel my order I apologize. Well at first the really awesome employee just said here you canTake your drink so you have something to sip on I said oh my gosh thank you so much and her manager it looked like was standing behind her and they told me to just keep my order since it was already made. The employees name was Celeste not sure if I spelled that right but this was one of the nicest things anyone has ever done and the fact that I am going through a hard time right now even makes it even brighter that they actually had a heart. I was literally about to drive away because I had five dollar bill in my hand and that was all I. They both really just made my afternoon and they should definitely get it A nice shout out. So Celeste and your manager or maybe just your employee friend you guys are the bomb I hope your management reads this
Jack in the Box,23,Went here for a few and realized again how discussing this place is. Guy laughed at me in the window because he couldn t or salmon I was saying and I received the wrong order.  You think they would do something about this by now....
Jack in the Box,24,Don t try to get a shake or ice cream after 10pm. They  run out of mix  or  the machine is broken  because they don t want to refill or clean the machine. Poor customer service from lazy employees.
Jack in the Box,25,This place is a joke. First the sign says we dont make it til you order. Then why were my curly fries cold znd old  I ordered a no.2 and it tasted likeits name. No wonder I didnt get a reciept to call the 1800 number. They put lettuce on it  thats it. No onions  jo pickles  no tomato. This plave owes me 7.99. Its no wonder the wendys across the street had 10 people in the drive thru and there was only 2 people at this place. Close this place down or fire the employees and find people worht the miney. This place isnt worth wasting another cent on  ever.
Jack in the Box,26,It s sad cause my mechanic always eat from here but today was just sad so my mechanic go get breakfast for the whole shop and when he comes back this what we see like serious and then when I go back up there to discuss with the manager a guy tells me the manager quit and that he doesn t have a manager and that for me to talk to some one I have to call corporate then he choose not to give me the money now I remind you I am a manager my self but this guy wasn t professional at all like short open all the way baggy pants and just straight ghetto with an attituted so freaking sad    
Jack in the Box,27,I admit  the marketing campaign is one of the big reasons I like Jack. I have often found myself rolling through the drive thru late night picking up one of the pot head happy meals. I dig the sourdough sandwiches. Feel free to judge. I don t junk food often  but when I do...I am happy to Jack things up.
Jack in the Box,28,So apparently when I ordered the jumbo breakfast platter and waited over 15 mins  only one car in front of us  what I really asked for was left over crunchy egg scraped off the grill syrup with no mini pancakes and cold meats and beacause you made me late for work I can t go grab anything else good job Jack this is crap
Jack in the Box,29,The service here is fast and friendly. For breakfast  I usually get the  3 Jumbo Breakfast Platter. It s a lot of food for three bucks and the mini pancakes are really good.
Jack in the Box,30,Keep moving down the road. This place is disgusting. The AC lines leak from the ceiling  no ice  nothing clean.
Jack in the Box,31,Not sure why I ended up here  but it was probably good that I did. Too many beers I suppose...food was cheap and good. First time having tacos from what I thought was a burger place  kind of a weird combination all together. Burger  fries  tacos  and jalape o poppers. All good though. Very satisfied. Tough to decide between here  taco cabana  taco bell  and whataburger after drinking all night. I think I made the right choice though....
Jack in the Box,32,If I could give zero stars I would. The customer service here sucks. They have young kids that could care less. I will travel out of my way to go somewhere else. This store needs help.
Jack in the Box,33,I don t even want to give them any stars but I did because the the food was hot at the least  but other than that they seriously messed up my order. I ordered 25 dollars worth of food and everything was wrong  We ordered a ultimate burger combo  two large teas  an extra curly fry  and a chicken strip combo. The tea was stale  I received a steak sandwich instead of a burger  the coke taste like peppermint  all the sides where small instead of large   extra ketchup   was four packets  and their idea of sweet and sour sauce was sour cream. I basically wasted close to 30 bucks and ended up in a sour mood for the rest of the night  keep driving  not worth your time or money 
Jack in the Box,34,Although closely located to where I live  I wave the white flag and just give up.  For the last 3 months I have stopped almost weekly to order a Chocolate Shake and each week I am told the machine is broken.  I asked an employee this week if they plan on ever getting it fixed  He replied he did not know.  Points for honesty  but please either take the shake off the menu or fix the machine.
La Marea Restaurant & Seafood,1,I only had the menudo  but it was HUGE and delicious   And they were very generous with the amount of tripe  My bf had the chile relleno  and he loved it so much he cleaned the plate. Service was above and beyond  and we were in a group of 9  so we weren t the easiest table to handle. Would come again just for the menudo and to try other dishes 
La Marea Restaurant & Seafood,2,I m so curious to see what this place is like at night or on a weekend because for lunch it s kind of a drag. Loving the bright colors throughout  but there was no music playing so you had to eat in silence and take in the natural ambiance which is just as awkward as you d imagine.  So  atmosphere  meh... food... well  it did the job. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and the chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely  Beans were fine as well as the rice. I don t think I d be running back anytime soon  but it does it s job if you re just looking for some basic Mexican food to go down.
La Marea Restaurant & Seafood,3,Extra dry fried tilapia. All veggies and fries from Sam s.  Large vuelve a la vida cocktail mostly shrimp and few octopus  3 oysters at bottom of cocktail tasteless. Order made to go. Must throw away half of the food or more. Rancid crackers . By the way. We order to go because the crying  drunk singers wannabe  they have a loud karaoke.  Ripped seats  dirty windows    Always thrilled to try new places. If I love it  I become a regular. If they fail I never set a foot again.  Love sea food  just not this one
La Marea Restaurant & Seafood,4,Amazing service and food was great. Perfect music volume  hot fresh foods with great flavors  Definitely recommend for couples and families. Variety of different menu options and alcohol beverages  Won t be the last time for my family and I     
Hacienda Jalisco,1,D e l i c i o s o   The waft of sizzling food hits you as soon you open the door  and you know you re in the right spot  First time being here  so I went for the basics... Chilaquiles and a  Barbacoa taco. PERFECTOS   Rojos are chipotle based and green tomatillo based. Epic refried beans  notice the flecks of guajillo chiles to add that red hue   Barbacoa taco has so much meat you can make two tacos  Great music and atmosphere. Barbacoa
Hacienda Jalisco,2,Closed Down due to health inspection- 6 4 2022  Sign posted on front door - dont come until further notice
Hacienda Jalisco,3,Another poster noted they were closed by health inspectors 6 4 22. Had terrible service. Frozen margaritas taste awful and we re not frozen. Also they are terribly strong as if they have everclear in them. Felt unsafe to drink  and both of us felt ill--my friend had 1 3 of a large frozen and had a hangover the next day. He never has hangovers. I had chills and flu-like symptoms overnight. Chips were incredibly stale. He was nice enough to bring me more stale chips. I orders a plate of something that didn t come with rice and beans and when I asked what meat was in it I couldn t understand him because he spoke so low. It was goat. Not crazy about goat meat. Oh  and there was a huge bone in it. Not recommended    I won t ever be back 
Hacienda Jalisco,4,I didn t get a warm fuzzy feeling there.   Their cheese with chili was not too bad.  The Barbacoa and Chorizo was pretty good. My vision is not that great anymore and my wife forgot her glasses  so it took time fumbling with the menu.  I had to use my iphone camera so I could zoom in on the menu to see.  From now on  if the menu is an eye reading test  I will move along. I will continue looking for a decent Jalisco style restaurant in the Austin area.
Hacienda Jalisco,5,Terrible service. Had to find a waitress to order after 15 minutes and only 4 other tables.  Cheese enchiladas were not good either unless you love velvet ya and sauce that tastes like spaghetti-os. Never offered chips and salsa or came by so I could order it. got my order wrong and took forever to bring my food after people that got here after me were served. Won t be back.  4 people ignored me while waiting at to go counter to pay since waitress never came back once food was dropped off.  I rarely write a negative review  but save your time and your money 
Hacienda Jalisco,6,The atmosphere is really fun  I like the chairs and booths. Recently priced food. I got the steak ranchers  Love the red sauce 
Hacienda Jalisco,7,First time here and it was really good  I had a chorizo and potato taco and a bean and cheese. The beans and tortillas were delicious  They use white cheese on the bean an cheese taco. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and the coffee was on point. The restaurant was clean and they had a cute little theme going on.
Hacienda Jalisco,8,Great place with awesome lunch specials. Enchiladas  flautas  and pork rib plate all  5.99. Very clean. Not crowded. Open long hours. I d highly recommend
Hacienda Jalisco,9,This place was a horrible experience ... chips were alright and then never was asked for a refill once until my food came out 20 min later for a lunch special.   Then to top this all off .. The lady who was serving us was outside dumping trash into the trash can and then came back inside started sweeping and then served me my food.   Horrible place I give it a 1 star and will never come back here again.
Hacienda Jalisco,10,One of the waiters has really bad attitude and does not know how to talk to the customers with respect . But the food good it s just always that one girl who has attitude
Hacienda Jalisco,11,Everytime I come in the facility is nice clean the staff I d always up to par.. I ll be back every morning the breakfast tacos are great and service is fast keep up the good work...
Hacienda Jalisco,12,I came here for dinner. Service was ok. Food was alright. But they should have more control over the drunk men during karaoke.
Hacienda Jalisco,13,My first two visits to this restaurant we re very nice. I pass by their sign fixated on 183 everyday. One their sign it advertises 3 breakfast tacos for 3.70. I called and made an order. When I arrived they said the price was  7.15. I said how  Asked her about the sign outside that I referred to when I made the call in order  She said she didn t know what I was talking about  but pointed out that on the menu it says 1.79 ...  Which isn t 7.15 when multiplied by 3 ...I left and came back with a picture of the sign and the lady went to the back... Talked to some dude then she came back and said...  Ok the tacos are free and don t come back ...I m here to report the facts lol
Hacienda Jalisco,14,they have the worst customer service ever  not everybody speaks Spanish  they should have someone speaking English at all times.i have been hung up on 3 times  only to ask when their boost mobile store opens inside their store worst service ever.
Jack in the Box,1,I went once during the day and it was fine. I didn t get sick and the food was normal. This location gets 2 stars and not 1 because of this.   I wanted to leave one star because I just waited 15 min on a munchie meal. I chose the Chicken Tater Melt and what I received wasn t what I ordered. They used the cheap  1 chicken patty first and then didn t use the correct bread. It was like the person who made it just didn t care or wasn t trained. It appeared to be guess work. I don t know what it is about these places. The job can be stressful at times but why can t you just do it correctly  Is it hard to use the pictures above the grill to make sure that you have the ingredients right  Do you hate your manger because they re a jerk and you ve given up  I could see either being right but I d really like to know. I hope I get a response. It would probably explain why every fast food place in Austin has the same lazy and poor service. The worst thing is that overworked and underpaid people are usually the ones eating fast food and fast food workers fall into that category. So really you re just screwing over your own people by thinking that you re sticking it to the man. The man don t eat Jack in the Box. He s far too pretentious for that.
Jack in the Box,2,I work at one of the warehouses down the street and I used to go every night. Now I m very disappointed. First of all y all got these dumbass f  king cashiers working the drive thru with these nasty ass attitudes. Y all don t like it  Shit get another job or make an OF.   2nd  OpEn 24 HoUrS  my ass  Every time I drive by  y all shut down  The hell is the point in opening all night if y all gonna close down  Maybe f  king update the time and shit   And finally on my last visit I ALWAYS MAKE MOBILE ORDERS. Yet when I get there they tell me that they won t help me or that y all close. And on top of that I don t get fucking refund. Which I STILL DIDNT GET     No wonder people are going to the Wendys across the street. At least they somewhat have people skills. Dumbasses I swear
Jack in the Box,3,I pull in in a giant first responder vehicle and they told me drive-through only and they were extremely rude about it  screw this place  an the fat lady thats rude as hell in the gray shirt 
Jack in the Box,4,Simply the worst  most rudest drive thru lady at the window. I was getting off work and was craving some curly fries and was immediately hit with attitude. If you don t want to work then just QUIT 
Jack in the Box,5,The 71 Airport locaction on Friday night at around 8 45 pm was dark outside  but was open. When we got to drive thru  they were open... but they could not take cards and only exact change. We had exact change  but... The burgers were loaded in ketchup and mustard. The fries were cold. The employees seem to be all play and not wrking...    I was totally disappointed    It isn t always like that  but I will not be going back soon.
Jack in the Box,6,To me  the only thing you should expect at a fast food place is convenience. Quality  customer service  etc is understandably a give and take. You get what you pay for. But unfortunately  this location strikes out in every aspect of the fast food  and dining  experience. Consistently poor experience. The drive through line takes about an average of 25-30 minutes to get through no matter how many cars are in front of you. Items are consistently left out of your bag or your order is often mixed up with other cars. They re often understaffed and outright refuse to cook certain items because of how stretched thin they are -- which I understand can happen especially right now  but you don t know this until you ve waited 10-15 minutes to get to the menu board and then another 5-7 minutes be greeted by an employee. Last time I visited  they were only making burgers and fries -- nothing else -- and the story as to why changed between me and the car in front of me. You re better off driving west on Ben White to the other Jack in the Box down the road -- trust me.
Jack in the Box,7,Stopped by at 12 at midnight and they were only serving food to Uber Eats and Door Dash according to the drive thru employee  while the other jacks that I frequent to serve to everyone at that time.
Jack in the Box,8,Worst service     Kids run the place first of. Second we show up to drive thru  amp  we waited LITERALLY 45 min to be told  it s just me we re closed now I can t serve u  wth     So confused people waited in a long line behind us too    Worst service ever  if ur not 24 hours change ur  open times OR COMMUNICATE TO CUSTOMERS THAT UR CLOSED     
Jack in the Box,9,So if you ve followed my reviews then you know  I don t expect anything from fast food joints other than my food being fast but what really grinds my gears is a rude MF. Biiiiiiiiiiitch it s wayyyy to early to have a damn attitude. I  myself am NOT a morning person  but I m respectful. If you ain t a morning person than you need to work the evening  shift.
Jack in the Box,10,Cheeddar Peppers  Egg Rolls  Teriyaki Bowl Compbo  Jumback Jack w Cheese... Curly Fries  Cheddar Wedges... Come the heck on  You know you like jack in the box.   I cant think of how any could possible not like the food here. Its fried its greasy its fabulous. The employees at this particular location are super nice. I suspect its because its all out of the way in the middle of no where on the way to the airport.  I feel like the speak in the drive through here only half works. Its the only thing keeping them from getting five stars in my book. It distorts the employees voices too much and I have to yell at it. Skip the drive through and just park and walk in.
Jack in the Box,11,everytime i come here their shakes machine never works  every single day   Im sorry the machine is not working.  If not please fix it cause it s summer  amp  people want shakes Icecream  
Jack in the Box,12,Unorganized. There was a little Oreo shake in my moms strawberry shake and I normally wouldn t care but when my mom tried the Oreo part..... it wasn t Oreo.
Jack in the Box,13,This place is disgusting. Trash every where. No one cleans up after guests leave. Chairs all over restaurant. Guy at register looked at me for a long time before helping. Then gave me my food without my drink. Had to then wait to get his attention. Pathetic.
Jack in the Box,14,Best JIB in the area. I used to work nearby  amp  the service has always been quick  amp  never got my order wrong. They usually do a pretty good job of keeping the parking lot clean  amp  well-lit.
Jack in the Box,15,Always polite and I ve always gotten my order correct. Yes there is a line sometimes but never anything to deal with long.
Jack in the Box,16,Thanks for the complimentary ant in my chicken sandwich and not answering your business  phone to discuss this.
Jack in the Box,17,Been to this location several times and always got great service. Food is standard fast food fare.
Jack in the Box,18,Worst DRIVE THRU EVER  Waited literally more then a half an hour this is ridiculous never going back again neither should anyone that s trying to get there food in go 
Jack in the Box,19,Food was fast  amp  fresh as it should be.. gentleman at the counter greeted with a smile and was polite later walked by and asked us how our food was in a easy going manner.. if this place was worse before it s definitely better now.. 4 stars simply because could have been a bit cleaner  Overall impressed for a fast food restaurant
Jack in the Box,20,There s a young man who works the drive through who likes to use a clown voice then once you pull up to the window he changes to solemn and annoyed. Idk if it s suppose to be ironic or what but he should pick one and stick with it for the whole exchange. Every time i go I hope to god that it isn t him because it s very uncomfortable and annoying. If you have to go to this jack then I urge you to go inside. They re normal there.
Jack in the Box,21,Not only did the chick at the window have massive hickeys but they left out 1 2 our order. I tried calling the number and nobody picked up. If they could hire adequate employees maybe this wouldn t be an issue.
Jack in the Box,22,Got to jack in the box at 1045  a bit of a line in the drive through. I wait  1052 it s my turn. Wait at speaker box till about 1104 and said  um excuse me   And now I get greeted. I placed my order. By this time the whole line cleared out in front of me so I go straight to the window. I asked the young lady at the window if the sensor was broken because I was there for over 10 mins before I was greeted. I thought maybe they didn t know I was there because of a malfunction. Nope she said that they were short handed and only had 4 ppl working and they were running out of stuff. Okay I understand. I ordered the spicy chicken munchie meal. I received my order and knew to check. Only had curly fries  I asked why I didn t have a mix of curly and regular fries  Her response was we are out.... lol I was like okay  So you weren t going to tell me  She apologized so now I know I need to check my sandwich. I open my sandwich and it has 1 single onion ring on it. I told they young lady I d like to return my food because it s not what I ordered. Manager comes and I told her the same thing. I was polite and simply wanted my money back  no telling what other corners were cut in the preparation of my meal and I didn t want to risk it. She asks if I wanted her to make another  I responded no thank you. I know y all are short and running low on supplies  y all didn t tell me about the Fries situation and my order is not of the quality I m used to from jack in the box. With an attitude she shuts the window and starts getting my money returned after I gave her back my order. Then she was speaking in Spanish to the original female employee and told her to get my drink back as well.  Petty . I thought y all should know about this situation and hope that manager could receive the proper training in interpersonal communication skills and to know that being honest with a customer goes a long way. But to try to sneak by with low quality product being deceitful and not telling the customer they are out of product is not a good idea. The picture on the menu shows multiple onion rings and mines simply had 1 it also shows a mix of fries and that s not what I received. I just know how upset I would have been if I would driven all the way back home with out checking. And knowing that the manager and staff were okay with putting people in the situation unbeknownst to them makes me sick.
Jack in the Box,23,This location is absolutely horrible  one of the worst experiences I ve ever had in hundreds of restaurants across the city  although I understand it might be hard to find good employees there s a constant revolving door of people working every  time  I go there.  This means the owner probably doesn t pay enough big surprise from a corporate store and this was the manager who refuse my order because I made a slight change the window and in reality I only corrected this manager about my order and she told me to leave and threaten to call the police without any hostility her energy was angry and rushed and inpatient.  I don t think I ll ever go to Jack-in-the-Box again  back when I would eat meat I loved the ultimate cheeseburger and I can t find that anywhere else and the curly fries are good  better than anywhere else I could fine which is why am going to miss those very much  so Mr. owner if you re reading this I hope you re not offended but the proof is in the puddin and The puddin at your location is about as bad as I ve ever seen.I never thought I would have to leave a place of business that I wanted to give money to worried about the cops trying to find me for trying to correct a fast food or I am personally offended and I ll make sure to not allow anyone I care about to ever go to Jack-in-the-Box anywhere because of my experience at Montopolis and Ben White in Austin Texas
Jack in the Box,24,Staff respectful  food was disgusting.  8 for a   2  that tasted like it had sat out for 2 days.
Jack in the Box,25,This place is horrible  waited at the register while they all looked at me and just kept moving.noone said anything and it was not busy at all.if I was the owner I would fire everyone  now I will boycott all jack in the box restaurants.
Jack in the Box,26,Love Jack in the Box  this location like many others  depends entirely on the staff that are there at the time  and possibly their mood.
Jack in the Box,27,Stop here for a quick breakfast  went into the lobby but there was about three of us standing there. The guy behind the counter said the girl hadn t showed up for work yet  so he couldn t take our order we had to go through drive-through. The woman in front of me asked why he couldn t just go ring it up on the drive-through register  He said he was too busy for that then looked at me and said the lobby was closed for 20 more minutes and but the sign on the door says that the lobby is open 24 hours. He was very rude to her  this guy does not need to be working there
Jack in the Box,28,the dichotomy of service.  i went through the drive thru. ordered a medium diet coke. i paid the cashier. then she says   ooops. sir we dont have medium cups  but i will give you a large cup instead no extra charge.   that is good service. but my damn car i had at the time had a rinky dink cup holder. and jack in the cracks  large cups are like super duper big gulps from 7-11. so i had to drive and hold on to my cup. i just couldnt do it anymore. i dumped my diet coke out my window when i was at a red light.  the end.  p.s. i actually ended up spending more money  for another diet coke but this time at wendy s.
Jack in the Box,29,This is the worst Jack in the Box in town. I went there one night and ordered a burger and fries. The burger and fries were flat out cold. I take the food back inside and ask for a refund. The Mexican guy I supposed was the manager just went to the register opened it up for the cashier and walked off. Didn t apologize or anything. At least say I am sorry sir or something. I have not been back since  nor will I ever go back in this lifetime. I recommend going to another Jack in the box if you want a better experience because this one sucks   
Jack in the Box,30,Shitty service   I ve been to this store once in my life a couple years ago over the OU Texas game during half time.  We sat in the drive thru for no less than 20 minutes   Get to the window and the girl had the nerve to ask me if I wanted me food or not and then flat out turned away from me and said that she wouldn t assist me.  Her manager was equally as rude.  Needless to say  I emailed Jack in the Box and never heard back.  I haven t been to a Jack in the Box since.  They lost my business forever.
Jack in the Box,31,Thank you jack in the box for getting mine and my boyfriend s orders correct  We were very very specific and particular with our order last night and the order was exactly how we asked. Thank you for this  It is truly amazing how often an order is incorrect. Thank you again    
Taqueria el Limon,1,I have a bean bacon cheese taco in my left hand  from this place. They don t have a sign  and the window says  yes open  in shoepolish marker  so we call it  YesOpen Tacos . It s a young couple cooking old style taqueria where you can see the whole process. As mentioned above  they actually refry the beans on the grill  and they pick-up the flavor of  chorizo and spices from grill surface. Yes  The name is actually Taqueria  al  Limon. They re in the big white unmarked trailer. YESOPENTACOS.
Taqueria el Limon,2,This is a new little taco trailer at the gas station at 45th and Burnet Rd.  He made my potato and bean taco right there in front of me on the griddle.  Even the beans were mashed and refried in front of me   So it tasted super fresh.  It was quite tasty  and the salsas  two kinds -- one red  one green  were spicy and delicious.  Even better -- the tacos were just  1 each     I m vegetarian  and their beans are veggie-friendly.  No lard.  But they do offer plenty of meaty  authentic tacos for the carnivores.
Taqueria Chapala #5,1,Trying all the local spots near our apartment and this one is got to be a favorite  Very quick service  delicious food  and taking cleanliness seriously. We will definitely be back 
Taqueria Chapala #5,2,With all the COVID-19 stuff making places to actually sit much more problematic  only one place were able to find....after about driving around for 10 minutes that allowed us to sit inside and eat.large portions and cooked like abuelita would make.
Taqueria Chapala #5,3,First time here  food I have to return in order to complete what it was missing according to the Menu  the waitress was pretty good   with customer skills. Could be better if did not need to return the food.
Taqueria La Sabrosita,1,Sabrosita indeed. Get the corn tortilla. Homemade and you can tell. Soft thin and fluffy. Wow.
Taqueria La Sabrosita,2,This is a new taco truck that recently opened in the Gaston Food mart parking lot  that was previously home to another food truck. Still finding their feet is what I would say  since the pastor and asada tacos I ordered were flavorful  but could use improvement  both in their marination and the char that is achieved on the flatop. I hope over time they move onto a trompo  but that is a rarity in these parts.   The salsas were on point  the deriguer taste and spice levels for a truck of this kind  but what completely blew me away was the quality of the corn tortillas the taco were served on. As you can see in the pictures  there are the perfect craters of crispy goodness pockmarked all over the tacos  and the tacos themselves boasted a tremendous masa flavor  and a perfect bite and chew  and I would go here again and again just to have the meat on those tortillas.   For now 3 stars  till they up their carne game. Nice little find  far away from the usual Austin taco scene  but near enough to be accessible
Taqueria La Sabrosita,3,Their breakfast Tacos are awesome and you can get it whole day  you should try them.   This is very much local type.   If you like spicy  you should ask for verde sauce  my favorite
La Traila,1,They had a shrimp cocktail special. I was skeptical of shrimp cocktail served from a gas station food truck  but they produced an enormous container filled with  no exaggeration  the best c ctel I ve had in my life. I eagerly drank all the broth. It was super fresh and absolutely laden with shrimp  there must have been over 20 in there. We returned last week and had equally successful results.   Best part  It s  8.75   For an enormous portion. That s really  really cheap. And it s so good  I ve had my fair share of shrimp cocktail and I gotta say you need to try this one.  Also tried the gringa which is a hell of a deal for three dollars. Salsas are spicy. This place is great.
La Traila,2,Food was nice and reminded me of so-cal Mexican food. Had the Carne Asada Taco with avocado. 3.5 stars. Had the Anderson  two eggs  cheese  bacon  salsa  and avocado. Quite filling - 4 stars. Also had a Carnitas Taco with cilantro and onions and salsa and avocado. The Carnitas was tender  juicy  flavorful - my favorite. Next time I go back I will venture into the Tortas.
Texican Tacos,1,As an Austinite I go to many of taco trucks  this one takes the cake   No only is the guy super friendly but he s fast and makes some of the best god damn tacos I ve ever had. Thanks for the great food 
Texican Tacos,2,So I payed with my chime card and it said error so I used a different card and when I get home with my tacos which By the way I got brisket tacos I do not recommend they were Soaked in grease and Terrible  But I got charged twice so being that I live close by I went back and showed him the charges and he literally laughed and said I get no refund   In the end he became very rude   what and asshole   Fuck texican tacos  .
Texican Tacos,3,My family is addiiiiicted to this place.  I m embarrassed to say that we settled on the potato  egg  and cheese breakfast tacos almost every Saturday morning like 3 or 4 years ago  so I can t really speak to anything else  but the potato  egg  and cheese breakfast tacos are the BEST in Austin and at a great price   Texican Tacos  potatoes are hand-diced  seasoned  soft potatoes.  The eggs are cracked on the griddle per order  seasoned  and maybe a liiiiittle greasy.  The cheese is always a deliciously gooey melt  the flour tortillas are always pillowy  and the individually-wrapped tacos stay HOT all the way back to your house  no matter how far away you live.  Oh  and each order comes with a side of delicious frijoles as well.  Like I said  my family is addicted...I m a fan of their red salsa  my wife prefers the green  and my daughter eats them without any sauce at all.  I have neighbors that frequent Texican for the brisket tacos in the afternoon and the chorizo  egg  and cheese tacos for breakfast.  That s it  give it a shot  hope you like it 
Texican Tacos,4,I love eating at random hole in the wall places. And I really wanted to like this place. We past by it all the time. My hopes were shattered today. The al pastor taco was okay but the barbacoa taco was just pure fat and no seasoning. The corn tortillas were super thick.  The quesadilla was okay  not as much cheese  but more veggies  Ugh this was such a let down
Texican Tacos,5,My whole family loves Texican Tacos. Their portions are HUGE and the prices are great. I have not had a bad meal from them yet.
Jack in the Box,1,Ordered burger with no cheese that has cheese on it. Location had no ice. Soda is warm and flat. Drive-thru was not busy but slow beyond reason. Perhaps worst Jack-in-the-box  customer experience ever.
Jack in the Box,2,The lady here is genuinely one of the rudest and grouchiest people I ve ever met. She s clearly overworked and it takes 30 minutes sometimes to go through a drive through. She literally just told the car behind me that the store is closed because the cashier was gone... but she was the cashier... 
Jack in the Box,3,I worked at this restaurant and it has no air conditioner and the manager didn t care about the employees being hot. We had to listen to the customers complain about the lobby being hot but we had to leave it open . If I could leave no star I would .
Jack in the Box,4,Horrible service   Had to repeat everything like 4 times in drive thru  amp  she had horrible attitude did not ask us what type of fries did not ask us if we wanted any ketchup nothing . Lady working drive thru does not seem like she wants to be working there   We ended up leaving somewhere else . If I could give it less stars I would  
Jack in the Box,5,The restaurant claims is iWork 24 hrs yet they close at ten. No one on sight    I don t get it why they don t just change the business hours
Jack in the Box,6,Don t come here   They never have tacos Jack in the box is known for. They never have egg rolls  and the service is also missing. Unbelievable 
Jack in the Box,7,Worst restaurant  business  and place of all time  The workers close the drive through whenever they don t want to work  or they ll tell you that they re  out of everything  so they can go back to sleep. Have been in this drive through for 45 minutes on several occasions. Check your order before you leave because I guarantee  you it s wrong 
Jack in the Box,8,Overall horrible.if I could give no stars I would.not my first time coming here and they always mess up.This jack in the box is a waste of space.You re better off building another gas station here.I ve been sitting in the same spot in line for the past 30 minutes...no one is moving...there s not that much food in the damn world
Jack in the Box,9,Their order box is broken. Got stuck in line and waited for an hour. The WORST experience I have ever had with fast food. I find it hard to believe that their speaker box isn t working. When I worked in fast food  it would be repaired immediately. This is unacceptable. Do better. No one should wait in line for an hour.
Jack in the Box,10,Really hate doing bad reviews but Worst jack in the box ever. Been months and they don t have soda and each time they are also out of most of their menu. Save time and go somewhere else.
Jack in the Box,11,If there was a zero star  I would put that down. I get off at 3 30AM-4AM and their excuse is  Shift change.  Are the workers lazy  Jack in the Box is 24 7. Never heard of a  Shift change  before. Go somewhere else before making a drive.
Jack in the Box,12,And the worst jack in the box award goes to... THIS ONE.  Went on 5 16 at 9pm the drive thru had a chair blocking it with a handwritten sign saying  inside only  we were annoyed but parked and started to go in. Then we tried the door and it was locked with crew inside cleaning up. We gave up and decided to come the next day  today  and the drive thru is open so we were happy  until the hard to hear speaker informed us they were not making tacos today  what we have been craving  so we said nevermind and waited in line to leave and noticed the car in front of us also didn t get anything.   Absolutely terrible.
Jack in the Box,13,Ya ll are absolutely garbage. Absolute worst Jack in the Box I have ever been to in any state. 35 minute wait for walk in order. Then two months later I go back to the drive thru  last week  ignoring the car 4 cars ahead. Waited 15 mins in one spot not ever moving. 3rd car ahead of me had to honk and shout several times. All 6 of us in the drive thru reversed and lift that c    restaurant. Never go here. The employees don t care and if they even do  they re extremely slow or don t care  who knows.
Jack in the Box,14,Every visit here is a complete disappointment.  They re always out of items on the menu or mess up the most simplest order.  There s always something wrong or missing.
Jack in the Box,15,This Jack in the Box used to be good 12 years ago but now it s gone downhill. I should have stopped going there when I got sick from eating something at this establishment but because of coupons that were sent in the mail  I decided to try them again.   Walking inside the lobby I was immediately disgusted by the smell. It s a  sour and unfresh  smell. I ordered a chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger with sodas and fries. Fries were mediocre  soda tasted unclean and the sandwiches were overloaded with mayo and we re not good. Chicken tasted raw. Cheeseburger was loaded with mustard mayonnaise and ketchup. We didn t finish the burgers and didn t get refills on the  dirty  tasting soda.  The Freestyle machine was out of most of the flavors and appeared to be leaking water on to the floor  on which there were four yellow  caution  signs around the area.  We struggled to find a clean table in this restaurant and we were the only ones in the restaurant. All the tables were sticky  including the front counter where we ordered our food. The booth seat was sticking to my leg as if it had not been cleaned in years and the drink area was flooded with water on the floor and several drinks of different colors had spilled onto the counter and dried. There was no telling how long they had been there. Needless to say I will not be back to this restaurant and I will be calling or contacting corporate regarding this issue. See photos.
Jack in the Box,16,Everything is out   order wrong   can t get combo with drink but to get the  fries u pay full price for combo. Spend almost 30 bucks to have it screwed up super happy
Jack in the Box,17,Worst service ever         Waited in line for 10 minutes.  My Churros were stale and the jalape o poppers looked like they had hot glue coated around them.  Disgusting   Save your money  amp  don t waste your time in the line.
Jack in the Box,18,Piss poor a   customer service. You go through the drive-thru and they ask you to come inside to place your order  That defeats the purpose of the dang on drive thru
Jack in the Box,19,My husband and I along with our 2 children stopped for a quick snack. We went through the drive thru. We ordered 2 small curly fries  a medium curly fry and a chicken nuggets..5 piece. Jonathan  young guy with braces  asked us thru the speaker if we wanted any sauce...we said bbq and ketchup. We wait for 10 min for this little bit of food. He finally opens the window and asks us again if we wanted sauce...we told him again. He gives us the bag and its got the fries but no nuggets. He gave us egg rolls instead  No ketchup. Like  seriously   Wont be back to this location ever. Our order was so simple and small and we ended up with something we don t even eat. My kids were disappointed and we didn t have time go go back and wait 10 more minutes. SO not ok.
Jack in the Box,20,Just a couple of weeks ago I stopped at the Jack in the box on parmer and Dessau  got the sliders  yuck  bottom buns were hard  food tasted like it had been sitting for a while  just terrible food   on the bright side  I did find somebody who spoke English though.
Jack in the Box,21,Went for a late night food  mainly cause it s open 24 hours  but come to find out that when me and my roommate pulled up to menu  no one answered for 3 mins so we pulled up to window and saw two workers in the back just hanging out and ignoring the fact that they have paying customers at the window  so we circled back around to menu speaker  and the guy on duty told us they had an update happening and won t be up and running until 430 am. Makes no sense when y all are 24 hours.
Jack in the Box,22,Haven t been mistreated ordering food in a while. I would give 0 stars if possible. Only accepting cash  wrong order and bad service. I directly asked for my condiments and the lady at the window pretty much through me my bag with no condiments in it. I tried to call with no answer. Time of this incident was 11PM on 1 12 20
Jack in the Box,23,Horrible customer service  Who knew getting a simple breakfast combo would take 35 min to get     Not coming back here again. What a waste of time and energy.
Jack in the Box,24,I d give 0 stars if I could. Worst customer service ever. Dirty kitchen. Rude employees.
Jack in the Box,25,Had to repeat my order for timescoma when I finally got to the window to receive my order I had to repeat my order again when I asked for a receipt they did not give me one and half of my meal was missing and when I asked for the rest they told me I needed a receipt for it and when I told them that they did not give me one but here is the transaction that you took off of my card they just asked me to pull up into the parking lot and they would bring me the rest of my meal and I waited there for over 40 minutes and never received anything
Jack in the Box,26,We live in the area. The surrounding fast food options are trash - long waits  missing items  etc. There was no one in line. Got hot food. Waiting for fresh chicken tenders so they gave us desserts on them.
Jack in the Box,27,I used to love this place. Always good food  always good service  usually pretty fast. Until today. We waited for over 45 minutes in the drive thru line and they finally told us  Sorry  we shut down due to no employees.   Like... what 
Jack in the Box,28,Worst service I have ever had at a fast food restaurant    Took 45 minutes to get my order and it was still wrong.  Pulled into the drive through and After 5 min they take my order The guy hands me a drink and says my order should be ready anytime now.  he asks me to take a lap around the drive through  and my food will be ready when I get back around.  Now there are 2 cars waiting in the drive through  and it takes 20 min to make it back to the window.    The guy now has no idea what I ordered and hands me a bag with one sandwich  which isn t what I ordered.  He argues with the lady making the food in Spanish  and asks me to park and wait.  20 min later I back out and look in the window.  They see me and bring out the bag.  I told the guy I have been here for 45 min and he says  my bad.  It was 3 15am when I arrived and 4am when I left.  Those 2 individuals should not have a j  Came in tonight and waited 0 minutes in the drive through before driving up to the window.  Spent a couple of minutes there before realizing there was nobody inside.  This location has apparently given up  don t waste you re time
Jack in the Box,29,Rivals Taco Bell for the slowest drive-thru around here. With 3 cars in front of me took about 20 minutes of sitting around dinner time. Bit excessive if you ask me. Seems to be an issue based on other reviews. Food was alright  it was fast food. I may give it another try someday.
Jack in the Box,30,None of the employees  or managers rare wearing masks or gloves at this location. I called 311 and reported them. I also refused my order because they are not in compliance with Covid-19 safety requirements. Not to mention service is terrible.
Jack in the Box,31,Another reviewer wrote  Every visit here is a complete disappointment ... I concur   Saturday night  arrived at 10 45.  Six cars in line ahead of me.  It took 31 minutes to get to the speaker.  My friend wanted the combo grab...guy said they didn t have any tacos  but it would still be the same price.  Then I asked for a side salad...he said they didn t have any.  Then he accused my friend of yelling at him when he decided on one of the burgers.  We pulled forward  then saw the two cars ahead of us both leave with NO FOOD   These each took over 10 minutes at the speaker to allegedly order...then drove off with nothing   We did the same.  Tony was the    hole at the window  who acted like he had no idea there was any problem  yet he was the one in charge of the order taking.  This is my third and last time I visit this location.
Jack in the Box,32,I gave Natasha my debit card in the Drive-Thru to pay for my order. She disappeared for it for at least 5 minutes. This is never happened to me before. I felt very uncomfortable. My card should have been swiped then returned to me immediately. I m keeping a close eye on my debit card charges. Also  they did not give me the ranch dressing that I asked for. We re never going there again.
Jack in the Box,33,I wish I could give this trash place less than 1 Star. The lady at the drive in ordered me to backup in the drive through after the guy wasn t at the first window. If there s no one there  why don t you take my money at the second window   Then I pull up  after an unapologetic guy takes my money back at the first window  and she tells me to drive around to the other side of the building. What    Presumably this is to move me out of the way of the customer behind me but why am I told to shove off  Can t the other guy just wait  Terrible customer service  I ll never go back.
Jack in the Box,34,This is my second time visiting this location and the quality is sub par. First visit was disappointing as the food was cold and hard. I tried a second visit  giving it another chance  and I should have passed it by. I ordered a sourdough  jack and was told at the window  after ordering and waiting  that they were all out of sour dough buns. Had I been told at time of order then I would have driven off to visit a different location nearby. I suggest bypassing and visiting the location up the road. Better quality with every visit.
Jack in the Box,35,Still the most unorganized location in Jack in the Box history. Went through the drive-thru line earlier tonight  and they finally had enough staff to cook a complete meal. Unfortunately  even after asking the drive-through person twice  I came home with two sweet teas instead of two unsweet teas. I don t understand why this location is even open anymore  I had given them a month-long break hoping that maybe their corporate would come up with some better solution for the staff at this location but to no avail they still cannot complete one single order correctly. It is absolutely mind-boggling that a company can allow a location to continue running with a incompetent staff. I m guessing at this point  Jack in the Box is just not the right fit for me. I expect better service from a fast food company like Jack in the Box.
Jack in the Box,36,Always takes FOREVER. And it s so hard watching the workers just stand around while u have already been waiting 10 min for ur food and still no drinks. Then once the food is ready they scurry to hurry and do the drinks. U had all that time  Why do u do this every time 
Jack in the Box,37,Slowest service ever. Either they need more staff or get new ones that will actually get the job done.
Jack in the Box,38,Ordered a  cheesy potato burrito  and clarified that  there s no meat right   because I m a vegetarian. Imagine my delight when I bit into my burrito and got a mouthful of chicken 
Jack in the Box,39,The worst drive thru I ve ever had before.. not worth it DONT  Go over there i went there twice the first time she asked me to roll back my car and she said that she will let me know when my order is ready and after that i can park next to the window and take my order   Next time the messed up my order and I ve missing 2 things of my order tried to call them for refund no one answer im f ing hate you guys
Jack in the Box,40,Lots of changes this place has made  GREAT   Anything you ask and these people give you want you ask along with the new promotion deals it s just awesome
Jack in the Box,41,Worst experience at a Jack in the Box ever    The line was only two cars in front of us but we waited for 30 minutes. The person was rude taking our order and seemed like we were annoying her by being there. The person taking our order also did not listen to us and once we got up front they didn t even have sweet and sour sauce. When we said that we didn t want egg rolls without the sauce she said that she couldn t take it off the order. It required a manager to resolve the situations. I didn t come here to wait steak house hours  find new management or employees and turn this place around asap.
Jack in the Box,42,Thank you to Ms. Aurora  She went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure I was satisfied. All with a smile  Thank you.
Jack in the Box,43,If I could give zero stars I would. Got home after ordering almost  20 in food and had a sandwich and fries. Completely wrong order. I guess that s what I get for ordering fast food  Went back up with food and asked for my money back and never once did the stag apologize. This place is terrible. Never coming back again.
Jack in the Box,44,I came in today and Dylan took care of our order  we took food thru drive thru  I just want to thank him because usually we don t get a good costumer service  he was polite and didn t take long like always   even tho he was by himself taking care of costumers inside and drive thru.
Jack in the Box,45,Huge  5-6 ft by 1 2   water soda spill leak in front of soda machine. Very dangerous despite  wet floor  signs. Blocked half the counter. ALL the tables in the place were very dirty. When I asked the manager  When do you think ya ll are going to clean this mess up   she said  What mess   Then when she came around and saw  she instructed someone to clean it up but he only mopped a little bit and cleaned off one table. It s like this every time I go to any Jack in the Box. I only go at the request of my aging father.....who I had to protect from falling on this giant spill.
Jack in the Box,46,Before I would have given this place 5 stars but the service and waiting time are ridiculous  I was asked by three different employees if I had received my order while waiting in the drive thru  they lack communication and responsibility.
Jack in the Box,47,Poor service     Always short staff and them known for their curly fries and don t have any and takes at least 30 mins to get ur food ... staff up and order enough product   
Jack in the Box,48,Went by at 2 due to limited options.  Lights were on  but whoever was supposed to be there decided to either leave or go to sleep.  Tried to use the corporate site to give feedback and of course that doesn t work.  Was never stellar service  but kind of my last straw.  Won t be patroning them in the future.
Jack in the Box,49,The food is fine it s the drive through time that is terrible. Waited about 35 40 minutes in the drive through the other night. I don t blame the staff completely though  there was about 7 cars in line but who schedules only two people at a time especially in that area. Y all can get pretty busy so why not schedule your staff accordingly  The staff is always nice it s just that it takes forever to get the food out. Also  why not take the payment and then hand the card back immediately  One time the lady walked off with my card and when I asked her why she took my card she said because she had to go swipe up front. Uhmmm     Last time someone did that I had a charge on my card I didn t make..  not related to Jack in the box  The next time the lady swiped my card and put it down by the register and then came back to hand me my card. I don t understand why you guys can t just hand it back after the transaction.
Jack in the Box,50,Worst drive thru experience ever. Be prepared to wait like 30 or 40 min just in the drive thru. I am stuck with people in front and behind me. It feels like a horror movie. Stay away from this one 
Jack in the Box,51,It was okay  drive thru took too long. Employee misunderstood order several times. Forgot curly fries and straws  But the poor employee was all by herself.
Jack in the Box,52,NO  JUST NO. Visited during late night rush on a weekend. Tacos were not deep fried long enough so the cheese slices on them were not even melted. Burger patty on my big texas cheeseburger was dry and not fresh at all. Bun tasted like a paper towel and had similar texture to paper too. I paid in exact change and did not get a receipt in my bag  At least they were fast but I could barely eat the damn food. Night management is not doing their job on quality control but the employees were doing an OK job of keeping the drive through line moving  albeit by undercooking the food so not sure if that really counts as a good thing. I would recommend trying the nearby location on Braker Lane just east of 35. While the Braker location is slower to serve food they cook it properly and are very friendly.
Jack in the Box,53,This must be the worst Jack in the Box of all. The service is horrible took 10mins to be acknowledged and if not for me needing to be elsewhere I would have left.  The Manager here must be getting a free paycheck because this place sure does lack management.
Jack in the Box,54,First off  this was my go to place before and after work. I would go to this jack in the box  at 3 am just to get a breakfast sandwich. But on February 10  they saw me for the last time.  I have been on a diet for two months now  and really did like the salads they offered. Well  on this night  I asked for one of the three options and they were out. Okay  we ll  I asked for the second option  they were out of that too. Well  since I was in a eight car line  I selected the last of the three. Finally  something was available. Well  since I wasn t sure if I would like that salad  I ordered the dinner bowl. The lady taking the order said that because of my difficulties  there would be a discount on the order. When I reached the window  I looked at the bill and it was full price. I asked the lady at the window about the discount and she said she had not idea what I was talking about and walked off. 7 minutes later another women came back and handed me my order  then walked off. As I said before  this was my toto place and the one star is for the taste of the food and it s value but customer service means so much more to me. I still have not gone to a jack in the box and will not go to this one.
Jack in the Box,55,i waited inside to order my food for 15mins. the employees were so busy and kept saying they would be right with me. yet i never even placed an order. the drive thru was way more important. take my business elsewhere for today.
Tacos Dolores Hidalgo,1,So far I ve been here twice and both times the quality of the barbacoa de chivo and the borrego have been excellent. You can have these meats in a taco as well as to-go btw. The corn tortillas on my second visit got cold fast but that s most likely due to the cold  windy weather.   The horchata tastes like it was made from scratch so I def recommend it  coming from an horchata expert and very critical of synthetic horchatas.   I m putting this place on yelp bc it s a crime that it s not on here.
Tacos Dolores Hidalgo,2,Food here is mos delicious I m a regular customer  I recommend this place to those who like real Mexican barbacoa and menudo.
Tacos Dolores Hidalgo,3,This was my first  time  I eat at this food trailer I bought 13 tacos all made from chivo meat different parts of the animal we also bought consome and with all my experience in eating  chivo tacos I found this ones to be to gamey.they were not the  kind of chivo meat prepared the way that I m use to the consome was ok the hot sauce that they served was not the best and the tortillas didn t taste home made they tasted more like process tortillas.i think they need to work more on the flavor of the chivo.
Antojitos La Huastequita,1,This food trailer is honestly a hidden gem. The quality of food coupled with the price-point has kept me coming back numerous times each week.   I am surprised they haven t received more praise.   Politeness  friendly conversation  great recommendations  are just a few examples of what these employees have to offer.
Antojitos La Huastequita,2,Good food for the price. A little greasy for my taste. Need more napkins  Friendly and quick service.
Tomgro Grocery,1,This place has been here longer than ive been alive has great history and was very involved in the community.  That has changed quite a bit but staff is great and fairly organized.
Tomgro Grocery,2,This place is incredibly run down-- there s a small tent city forming in the parking lot-- and the staff was incredibly rude. The photos are misleading as to the condition of the storefront.    The prices are inflated and feel exploitative for a local market.   There s no signs posted out front concerning dogs  but when I went in to ask  I couldn t get a word out.
Tomgro Grocery,3,Used to love this place years ago but my experience in the last 2 weeks has put me off FOREVER. I decided to treat my family to some of their summer sausage and longhorn cheese for old times sake over Christmas. I dropped in on a Thursday after getting off work at 3 to pick some up. They told me the deli closes at 3. OK I ll come back tomorrow. I go in Friday and I m told the deli closed at 1. OK  figured they closed early on Fridays. Monday I went into work early so that I could get there before 3. Just to cover my bases I called in my order of 1LB summer sausage and 1LB longhorn cheese. Got there a little after 2. Was told the guys in the store part had the order. Cool. Grabbed my stuff for about  13 and was out. Had the summer sausage tray for everyone and it was a hit...GREAT  But  because I didn t get much i decided I d get some more after Christmas just for myself. I got into work the friday after christmas. I call them before 2 to put in my order for pickup. But I m good the deli is already closed. Oooooook. I decided that because I have to be out Saturday  today  that I got on over and picked some up. I run the errands I have to then as I m leaving the last store around 10 30 I call Tomgro to see if the deli is open and if I can place an order for pickup. I m told the deli is open. They re open until 3. But only orders for tacos and things like that can be placed. You can t place a pickup order for sausage and cheese. Alrighty  even though I did it LITERALLY  a few days ago. So...I drive...FROM SOUTH FIRST AND SLAUGHTER TO RIVERSIDE AND MONTOPOLIS FOR THIS FUCKING SNACK...only to be told by the lady in the deli that they don t sell summer sausage by the pound only by the roll which is  8. FUCKING WHAT   Less than a week ago I bought 2 pounds total of their shit and now...    FUCK THEM  They have delicious summer sausage but its not worth the time and energy of playing their bullshit game of  do I wanna serve you today or not . I won t go back there. But the good that came from this is that I reconnected with a lot of my old marketas and some new delis while on the search for summer sausage  Lol So  in a spit on your croch kind of way they did me a favor. Thanks for nothin Tomgro  
Tomgro Grocery,4,Your favorite urban small grocery  stocked with large varieties of your favorite grab n go items. They have clothing and swag apparel for a clean look as well as several varieties of beer. I come here for a good selection of beverages for the most part  but they also have hot food  such as pizza  nachos  and sandwiches  but no liquor and no seating. So even though it s a great part of this neighborhood  it would be really cool to sit with some people of the neighborhood over a plate of nachos and enjoy the sunset.
Tomgro Grocery,5,Small grocery store with simple yet delicious tacos available at their lunch counter.  They offer a rotating menu of tacos that include standard things like barbacoa and carne guisada  as well as harder to find items such as cabrito and tripas  so some of their items may be considered  adventurous  by some standards.  I think everything I ve tried has been good-to-great.
Tomgro Grocery,6,If you are looking for a grocery that is local  authentic  east-side  genuine Austin-community with real-people-real-life food and groceries  this is the place.  Tomgro reminds me of my local grocery store from when I was young and growing up.  It takes me back to that time.
Jack in the Box,1,I have to be honest..I ve ONLY ever come to this Jack in the Box AFTER a night of late night fun that of course involves dancing  amp  drinking so of course the tacos  amp  egg rolls  amp  not to forget french fries taste like I m eating a big juicy steak  -        So this 5-star review is based on me munching while being a lil tipsy  - . If I ever get around to eating here during the daytime of course I will make sure to update my review.  So THANK YOU Jack in the Box for staying open super late  amp  for the awesome service in the wee late night hour 
Jack in the Box,2,They told me they were closed for 20-30 minutes when I showed up... only after I had to wait until someone answered me at the window... stayed by the mic for 10 min  drove up to the window and was then told about the wait of 20-30min from a guy saying he was just a fry cook
Jack in the Box,3,Everything about my experience today was wonderful at my visit to this location   Tony the man who took my order was very kind and his attitude was definitely out of this world   Made sure my food was fresh also made sure my order was correct     I will be coming back to this location thank you Tony for the exceptional customer service  somebody give this man a raise 
Jack in the Box,4,Always slow  but now that are only accepting cash when it s late  amp  it just seems even more sketchy. I hope somebody actually monitors these reviews bc damn
Jack in the Box,5,before today I ve never had an argument with somebody at a drive-through window last I heard customers always write. I feel like I m a victim of racial profiling having been denied a replacement for the order that was messed up. pick your battles lady it s none of my business that  a 17 year old   didn t hear my order correctly.  all I wanted what I paid  27 for. without being upcharged. There s several other things wrong with the meal. I am completely unsatisfied and I feel personally attacked by the woman who felt it was her business to make it personal  that was a different race than me   This is the first review I ve ever written.  I don t care how old this guy is. I had job at  15 and had to defend myself at a drive-through window  Because I wanted what I paid for  and that s probably cause I m white  The reverse racism I experienced tonight made me lose my appetite entirely.I ll never go there again.  Pick your battles you know 
Jack in the Box,6,The service sucks while we where supposed to be getting our food and even gave the employe our money to pay he was taking an other order through the head set we stood at the window for more then 15 minutes and yet there was way more people behind us the Chick-fil-A line goes way faster and they have way more customers get better employees or train them better smh never again
Jack in the Box,7,I waited in line for 20 min behind one person and got the window closed in my face. This jitb sucks
Jack in the Box,8,The employees here are idiots. Fucked up my order at drive through manager needs to teach them the difference between an Ultimate Cheeseburger and a Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger. These idiots will probably be working at Taco Bell next week.
Jack in the Box,9,No wonder only 2 stars.  Sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes.  One time i sat there  nobody took my order so i drove to the window. Nobody inside. This time i walked up  dude was rude as hell. Good luck to ya. Or do a better job of hiring.
Jack in the Box,10,On my way back to Dallas  I stopped here for a simple salad and eggrolls .....man the dude in the front register had issues or something he would get mad for the simplest things he even got mad when I told him I m missing my condiments for my salad and this dude went to the back dropped my croutons and picked it back up like no sir I m not accepting that please throw that away and dispose of them gloves how u gonna pick something up from the floor and give it to the customer  the taco guy in the back threw him another one playing around like wth  I really had to get my money back after waiting for almost 20min for my food I lost my appetite and yess this is my first review  
Jack in the Box,11,Okay I get it s 2am and you have a bunch of drunks to deal with ... but come on you can get the orders right and move it. Waiting 22 min for fries and watching two customers walk up  back up  to window is crazy .... just get it together.
Jack in the Box,12,This place is the worst. Writing this waiting because I have plenty of time. This place consistently takes 20 minutes. I think I m gong on 30. They are always understaffed. Employee was cool. Not their fault.
Jack in the Box,13,Anytime I need to receive mediocre-terrible food from a staff that has truly grasped the subtleties of deeply loathing everything about a hamburger and the customers who order them  this is the establishment for me  If one does manage to speak to a manager  they will not find a manager. They will only find an actual walking-talking trash bag in a red shirt  who will not only look like they ve just been woken from a nap  but also  they may very well still be asleep  While it is true that Jack In The Box is known  America wide  as the worst  fast   food   restaurant   each word is in quotations  as all JitB locations will make you question each aspect individually   this location is most certainly an award winning worst 
Jack in the Box,14,Wow... rolled up To the window that s open 24 hours and whoever is at the drive thru says they are not taking orders right now... No explanation or anything. Shouldn t they turn off their lights     
Jack in the Box,15,Despite two cars at the drive-thru window  we waited at the drive-thru board for several minutes without being acknowledged. Finally said  Hello   out of confusion as to whether they were actually open or not. No response until we start to drive away. Pulled around to see two cars STILL at the window essentially blocking our exit. Needless to say  reversed out of there without ordering food.    Did you know that when you pull up to a drive-thru menu the headset of the attendant beeps until it s manually dismissed   This means the attendant was aware there were people waiting and actively chose to ignore it.   If you try calling the establishment  it goes to voicemail.
Jack in the Box,16,I pulled up and was the only customer. The girl working the window took my order  2 croissant breakfast sandwiches  and I pulled up to the window and paid for my food. She closed the window and I waited. I pulled out my phone and checked FB. Still waiting. I got my receipt back out and looked at the time. I paid at 7 06am and it was now 7 15.  I was beginning to think she had forgot about me. I am a patient person but when it comes to  fast  food  you d think it would be well...fast. I was the only person there  It was now 7 18. I leaned forward to look into the window  she was fiddling with the coffee maker. At this time  I see another car behind me. She walks up to the register and enters what I assume is someone s order. I stare her down. She doesn t even look at me. I see yet another car pulling around to wait behind the car behind me. It is now 7 20.  If I didn t think that she would mess with my food  I would have laid on the horn. But I try my best not to be  that person  At 7 22  she opens the window and without saying a word  she hands me my bag and quickly shuts the window.   TL DR - I was the only customer  for about 6 minutes  and it took nearly 20 minutes to get my 2 breakfast sandwiches. The girl didn t even speak to me when she handed the food to me.
Jack in the Box,17,I ve been waiting for 15 mins in drive thru. Long enough to pull up this app and write this review. I m still waiting for a milkshake....
Jack in the Box,18,This place is in such a neighborhood that they close before the door says at 10 pm.  I walked from several blocks away and even though I knocked on the door and it was before 10pm.  No one offered to let me spend my money.  I originally thought this says something about the neighborhood.  But I honestly believe that it is a lack of leadership from the store and regional management that employees would even consider locking the doors early.  I just hope someone takes notice before we loose another JNB to poor decision making.
Jack in the Box,19,Went there this morning after work. Went to the drive thru and order 2 number 26 with no ham.  So I had to wait 22 minutes for my food. And they still got my order wrong and tried to to give my order to the car in front of me. By the time the car in front of me got there order  mine was cold.  Never again will I go back. And it look like they unwrapped it and put it back to gather
Jack in the Box,20,I strolled in 10 minutes after they closed the dining room. The door was WIDE open and someone was standing at the front counter. Immediately he said they were closed. I told him  You re door is open... Are you saying you won t serve me   Someone else walked up and said  We stop serving the dining room at ten  sir .   I was hungry and had cash in my pocket  their door was open  and they refused to serve me.  Personally  I think that s bullshit. I work customer service also and I ve went out of my way to keep the doors open for customers after hours if they need it. Not to mention  they re turning down money.  IF YOU RE GOING TO REFUSE WALK-INS AFTER A CERTAIN TIME.... LOCK THE DOOR.  Bullshit.  Edit   As far as fast food goes  I like Jack in the Box. Usually  Jack s got my back  In fact  I d been to this one a hand full of times with no complaints... But this experience was particularly annoying... and their refusal of service  I think  was unnecessary given the circumstances.
Jack in the Box,21,Not fast at all  They had me wait to order for 10 min    Then another 10 for the food  Along with an attitude. Oh did I mention I was the only one in the drive-through  Don t bother 
Jack in the Box,22,Sad experience tonight. Young lady greeted me with confusion and the previous car s order. Once she finally understood that I was a new vehicle order  she told me to proceed when ready. Great  I already know what I want. Nope  now she isn t ready. Okay  I ll wait. Finally give her my order. Things are looking good. Get to the window and receive my drinks and food. No receipt was given. Get home to find my plain burger now has added items I didn t request. I call to speak with a manager. Guess what  Not a manager  team leader  nor shift supervisor to be found. Spoke with the same confused lady who told me she confused my order with another vehicle. I asked her to take my name and number for management. I even spelled it for her. She hung up on me half way through. I call back for 30 miniutes. She refuses to answer the phone. When she finally answers  she passes me off to a man who barely speaks English. He tells me all team members are busy and call back when they are not busy. Sure  because I can tell you are busy or slow all the way from inside my home five miles away. I said no thank you  I will just speak with her manager about her hanging up on a customer and her general lack of concern for the company mission.
Jack in the Box,23,My son and I have been here 3 times so far. so far we have never been disappointed still loving the tacos my son still loves getting his bacon ultimate cheeseburger and I still enjoy having my jumbo Jack with cheese. so far drive through experience has been pleasant. we expressly enjoy the convenience of not having to get out of the car number one and the number to that they are open when my son gets off of work after midnight.
Jack in the Box,24,Extremely slow service in the drive thru. Employee acted like inconvenience asking what the flavor of drinks. Waited 20 plus minutes for food.
Jack in the Box,25,Honestly it s jack in the box   You can t expect much but they have a great value options compared to whataburger across the street  They must need a new speaker because he couldn t hear anything I said   Slow service but food is decent  
Jack in the Box,26,BURGER REVIEW  I m trying to avoid putting fast-food burgers on my burger list  but I have to give an A-OK to the  Hot Mess . It was hot and it was messy  alright  and I tried to eat it while driving  and THAT was a hot mess. But it honestly was not bad a burger.  On the grilled  sourdough  bun  jury s still out on that one  and covered with a hot messy sauce  jalapenos  onion rings  and pepper jack cheese--this burger was worth three stars  and inclusion on my burger list  for sure. I would ve geeked-out like I usually do  and snap a pic  but I was weaving in and out of traffic on the I-35  while juggling burger in one hand  and napkin in the other. Cellphone photography at that point seemed a dangerous impossibility. Peeling the burger-paper back without getting Hot Mess sauce all over my face  and avoiding collisions were the two main challenges. I pulled through--no collisions  and only a fleck or two of Hot Mess sauce on my face. I d call it a victory. I ordered iced tea and curly fries  and they were  well... two-star. But this kinda tasty burger bumped it up a star  and got it a seat on my burger list. So  well done  Jack. You still creep me out  but your food is A-OK.
Jack in the Box,27,When I first moved to Austin I would go here in the morning as it was the easiest place to get to on my way to work. There was this older gentleman that was always working and had some of the best customer service I ever experienced. Well he is no longer there in the mornings and this place has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every time I go here  which is very rarely now  my order is always messed up. This morning was the last straw  I ordered an Extreme Sausage and it only had 1 piece of sausage and 2 eggs on it. Thanks for reminding me why I stopped coming here.
Sabor Veracruz,1,Great place to dine in    Everything is looks delicious  I would recommend for a casual day  i
Sabor Veracruz,2,Very inviting environment  Bilingual staff -  friendly and helpful. The menu is varied  but the main focus is seafood prepared in a Mexican  jarocho  style from Veracruz. Food is excellent  Fresh and well presented.  We live close by and have been watching and waiting for them to open. This is our first visit  but it will definitely be a regular favorite. Homemade corn tortillas are so good 
Sabor Veracruz,3,Seafood and fajitas in the Tech Ridge area. The location is convenient  food is excellent  and very clean eatablishment  They have a bar if drinks are your thing. Love the charros 
Sabor Veracruz,4,Absolutely not.  The wings were horribly undercooked and the ribs were disgusting.  I will never ever come back.  And the pricing is high for shitty food 
Sabor Veracruz,5,Food was delicious  Drinks were Amazing  and the customer service was excellent    Would 100   recommend for authentic Mexican seafood plates. Will definitely be coming back
Have A Taco,1,We were at the picnic  amp  tried 3 different trucks.  The taco we had from have a taco was awesome     We had the Chicken taco and was soooo yummy   Highly recommend this truck.
Have A Taco,2,Why did I order before checking yelp   Not worth the money.   7 for brisket  barely any meat and tons of onions  5 for pastor okay flavor but not worth the price.  These are  3 tacos at its best. I got more tortilla than anything.
Have A Taco,3,I ordered 14 tacos   2 of them were suppose to be for kids . I didn t ask for the hot sauce on top   so when I went and asked if I could get them with out the hot sauce  but the person up front had an attitude. She told me I would have to buy them again because I didn t tell her they were for kids. Second of all   the hot sauce is suppose to be on the side   you can t just add it on for your customers without asking.And they re not Mexican tacos for them to be saying it s Al pastor.
Have A Taco,4,Pretty rare for me to have an experience worthy of one star  but I honestly can t think of any redeeming qualities worthy of upping my rating.   For a truck to have  5 as the cheapest taco  you would expect them to be fairly sizable and of at least reasonable quality  but Have a Taco managed to limbo well under both of those bars.   I went for the red taco and shrimp taco and feel like I would have needed 2-3 more to come close to being full.   All the ingredients felt store bought in the worst way  particularly the tortillas tasted like I was getting the last ones from a slightly old package in the back of your cuppboard. The meat quality fit the stereotype of low quality  low flavor  that I used to have for truck food back when I lived in New York.   Overall  I highly recommend going for one of the many alternatives available in this food truck park
Have A Taco,5,I visited Have a Taco because I toured a group around Austin  Tx. There was several options of food trucks to choose from so we walked to each truck to view their menus  of course we wanted to use our free food and drink coupon wisely.
Have A Taco,6,Not a happy customer I want my  21.65 back. The place on Barton Springs Rd is Horrible place to eat. Customer Service is Horrible  I DO NOT want to ever ORDER FOOD FROM you all. Very  Very Bad Experience today November 10   2022
Have A Taco,7,We ordered 2 brisket nachos and they were absolutely horrible. It hardly had any meat or cheese and it was cold. When my husband explained it to the cashier cook she shrugged him off like she didn t care. It was so overpriced 12.00 for brisket nachos. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Please do not go here
Have A Taco,8,Like other people  I really wish I had seen reviews of this place  before  I ate there. I tried finding the location on Yelp before we ate based on where it was on the map but that didn t work presumably because they ve changed locations once or twice and Yelp has their old location.  Anyway  I ll echo all of the other reviews. This place is terrible. Hands down the worst tacos I ve had in Austin and it s not even close. Do not waste your time here.  Also worth noting that it looks like most  if not all  of the trailers at the 620 location  Four Points  are owned by the same company  Cook a Concept  and based on what we were seeing  the experience you d probably have with all of the other trailers will end up being the same as Have a Taco. We stopped by three of the Cook a Concept trailers and all of them were out of the majority of what they had on the menu. I should have taken this as a sign and bolted.  Went up to the Have a Taco trailer and no one was there. Called a few times and eventually  the guy working there comes out of the vape shop next door  wtf  and serves us. That should have been enough of a warning sign for us. We were in a pinch and needed something quick so we just ran with it. We won t be back to these trailers  let alone Have a Taco.  Gross.
Have A Taco,9,Very fast and efficient. We needed a place to get our kids a snack and this hit the spot. The tortillas were crisped on the flattop so they didn t fall apart. The kids enjoyed them.  The shrimp were those really tiny ones  but for a quick kid snack  it was good.
Have A Taco,10,We ordered  Shrimp taco- the shrimp tasted raw. Steak taco- did not taste fresh at all we ended up giving to our puppy. Brisket taco- it was ok  chips and salsa-  they messed up the order and gave us chips and queso and insisted it was salsa.  It wasn t good and we didn t finish it.   27 dollars and we could only finish 1 of the 4 tacos
Have A Taco,11,I paid  12 for a COLD quesadilla. I understand that ACL is stressful and hard to make the food as ordered but the quesadilla was trash. Never again.
Have A Taco,12,Wish I could give less than 1 star you should avoid this place like the plague. I informed them of a food allergy and discussed with the cashier what I should get. They then accidentally put a sauce on my tacos I couldn t eat. All of this would have been an understandable mistake - but then they were BELIGERANTE when I informed them of the mistake. They refused to do anything to remedy the issue  yelled at me  and closed up the shop so they wouldn t have to deal with us.   Also  several other people in my group did get tacos here and said they were basic and flavorless  and that was before I had issues with my order   We finally got them to refund the tacos but overall a HORRIBLE experience  do not eat here. Period.
Have A Taco,13,Street corn NOT roasted. Out of a bag or something. Yuck. And  meh  service. Wish I d read the reviews first. Waste of money.
Have A Taco,14,Just had Have a Taco for the second time. I ve eaten at the one on Barton Springs  today hit the one on 620 in the food trailer court. Everything was super fresh and delicious  steak tacos on flour my favorite among my favorites here  top notch  quick service 
Have A Taco,15,They have two menus on the truck and the one you can see has toppings on everything. The other is plan taco with sauce that s super hot. No cheese no nothing. The meat is nasty. I asked for a refund
Have A Taco,16,If you re reading this it s not too late for you. Please please make another decision. Worst tacos of my life.
Have A Taco,17,Heeeeeeeeeeck no. This place is disgusting     Got the steak taco for my kid he gagged and spit it out. I then looked and the meat was literally white. Stay afar away    What a rip off and when I show them what their food looks like they don t even respond. Just a blank stare like a brainless zombie. Absolute garbage  have no idea how this place is operational.
Have A Taco,18,I don t ever write reviews but it s the nicest thing I can do right now. Worst tacos of my life. Don t go. Especially for all the great food in Austin. Disappointed
Have A Taco,19,Worst place ever. Overpriced. Flavor is absent  miserable ingredients. I paid  20 and ended up in McDonald s to deal with hunger afterwards. Sour cream and pico de gallo were frozen  with ice crystals. No in-house salsas - they offer bottle sauces. For that price tag you get the worst possible food.
Have A Taco,20,Legitimately the worst food I ve had in Austin. Very much regret and wish I looked at reviews before 
Have A Taco,21,Should of read the reviews before  buying food from here. Went to the one by 620 FM and right off the bat tacos are highly price  but as anything the items seem to justify the price  and assuming the tacos are a good big size for it to be that price.     Wrong  see the guy handing the tacos to a family  and wow just your normal small looking taco ever. Even the kids were saying are  these the tacos   taken back on how small they were.  So avoided the tacos  and despite my gut saying just leave I ordered the brisket  quesadilla. Welp bamboozled once i saw the plain quesadilla  with the portions meats being small  heck taco bell steak chalupa had bigger meat portions and its only 3-4  their pica de gallo look like it was cut with a knife with no blade  it didn t have no flavor whatsoever  just all bland overall.   The point  they are overpricing 2  or 1  worth tacos by alot and yeah definitely don t recommend going here.
Have A Taco,22,Have A Nasty Taco  Well below average flavor. Well above average price. Very quick service for very horrible food.
Have A Taco,23,The quality of the taco is worse than Taco Bell. Corn tortillas were a soggy mess. Pastor was mediocre. As for the Red taco I could not even swallow it. Do not recommend.
Have A Taco,24,This place is overpriced. The meat portion is very small I would compare It to when you re seasoning your meat and you grab a small bunch of salt  that is the portion they put in your taco. The one thing I tried that was good was the corn and even that wasn t worth the  5 price. Do what you want but I would seriously steer away from this place. Street tacos with a  1 price per taco have more meat and more flavor than this place. This is the worst  25 I ve ever spent.
Have A Taco,25,Loved my tacos and the street corn is so good    The service was great.  There was a little wait but only because it was the busiest food truck there.
Have A Taco,26,The nastiest tacos I ve ever had in my life. Threw up 5 mins after eating the pastor. And  6 each a taco. The meat looked like hot Cheetos. Not to mention the guy working was not friendly at all and kind of rude.
Taqueria Ceibas,1,If you re willing to risk a bit of safety in the morning  this truck is worth the risk. I went before 7 30am and no transients were around. The woman who runs the show is incredibly kind and speaks zero English so get your Spanish ordering skills ready. I ordered two bacon  egg  and bacon tacos and they came with salsa verde and salsa roja. I am not a red salsa person but wow  this smoky and spicy salsa is incredible. The bacon quality is poor but it does the job. I ordered 2 tacos and gave her  6 for convenience  this is close to my place of work . I didn t wait more than 6 minutes  amp  was really happy I stopped by.
Taqueria Ceibas,2,A great taco truck find  tucked away behind a Chevron station at the SW corner of the E. Rundberg and IH-35 intersection. It s kind of hard to see  but they ve got good  fresh cooking going on  so it s worth the effort to track it down amongst all the nearby trucks up and down this stretch of road. Unlike it s neighbors  it s open all day and evening  thank goodness  so hungry people like us that need a taco fix after 3pm have a good place to go.   My S.O. ordered the Carne Asada  Beef Fajita  Tacos   2.50 each  on flour tortillas that were soft and warmed on the griddle. They are normally topped with cilantro and onion with lime on the side which would have been perfect  but my S.O. is waaay Gringo and apparently thinks that it s against his religion or something  so he had his topped with melted white cheese. The meat was tender and tasted like fajitas off the barbecue. Delicious. They of course also offer corn tortillas  but I m sorry to say that I neglected to ask if they made any of their own.  I opted for the crispy Chicken Flautas   8 for an order of 5   stuffed full of shredded chicken and topped with lettuce  tomato  avocado and crema. All that was missing from this plate was a bit of salt.  I would definitely order either plate again.   They offer most TexMex favorites  and for Menudo  Chivo  or Pozole lovers  they cook up those soups on Saturdays and Sundays.  The ladies who run the trailer are very friendly and helpful to those of us not fluent in Spanish. They have picnic tables for eating al fresco  or they ll package up your food in almost-spill-proof containers complete with plastic ware and both red and green sauces.  Both sauces pack some heat  but neither sauce needs dousing out until you ve had a few bites--but then they tend to sneak up on you later with even greater heat  I admit that I ate all of them despite the heat --I think my mouth is still a bit on fire. It s a good thing that they offer various fruity paletas and aquas frescas to put the fire out 
Taqueria Ceibas,3,Solid birria but behind La Tunita 512 and Sabor Tapatio by a bunch.  We tasted the birria at this little joint  hard to find - just behind the Chevron gas station on N Lamar  as well as birria from La Tunita and Sabor Tapatio.  Price point is good but the chiva was just average.  The consomme was good but not as flavorful as Tunita nor Sabor.  We rated Tunita the best  followed by Tapatio and Ceibas last among the three we tried this week.
Food Fight Cafe,1,These guys were a pleasant surprise Saturday when I stopped by Hi Sign for a pint after a bit of hiking. Their Airstream will catch your eye and lure you in. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. They took plenty of time to talk to me about the great food they turned out.   So  I didn t try the whole menu but what I had was truly special. I had the pulled pork green chili burrito. This is what Chipotle wishes it was.  The pork had a perfect bark and their house-made green chili sauce was the star of the show. I m already looking forward to my return visit.
Food Fight Cafe,2,Suuuuper friendly staff  which is always a plus   The fries were yummy and the veggie taquitos were unique  but the veggies kinda fell out.. . The fish tacos were just ok- tortilla was just corn tortilla out of the bag- not toasted etc.  wish they would ve had flour   I think everything just needed a bit more flavor 
El Mana,1,Loved it.  Everything was made fresh and there were a lot of choices on the menu   I grabbed the Saldia Rellena and it was on point   Next time I m planning on getting some mini tacos with asada.
El Mana,2,I grew up in the 60s in San Antonio where tamales for Christmas was a required ritual.  El Mana makes a superb tamal and I am damn picky about them - I prefer pork and these were awesome- tasty masa that wasn t dry and plenty of seasoned pork shoulder meat as the filler.  Do you only going to keep them for me and perfect and said they were a bit pricey at  15 per dozen.
The Calimex Cafe,1,I grew up in San Diego. I miss the food so much. I ordered a burrito and rolled taquitos it was very good. So thrilled to find Mexican food that s not Texmex 
The Calimex Cafe,2,Delicious Mexican Delivered quickly from Doordash  Thanks you so much for bringing California Mexican Food the Austin TX
The Calimex Cafe,3,Ordered off the website and had it Delivered. I am originally from San Diego and have terribly missed the Carne Asada burritos from Roberto s and the rest of the menu. This place is so far from that. We ordered  tacos   3.75. We thought we were getting a couple of tacos for that. We got 1 taco for  3.75 and one  4.25 and they were the size of an empanada disk. We also ordered the Carne Asada burrito of course. Absolutely terrible. Too much lime or something. It cost  11 and it was basically a bad guacamole burrito. I knew as soon as I picked it up  it wasn t going to be like the MUCH CHEAPER burrito you get in San Diego. I never in my life thought I would eat a taco and burrito and say I was still hungry. We spent  58 after tipping the driver and I absolutely regret it. The on positive thing I will say was the taco was great tasting  what tiny bit of it there was. Won t ever be returning.
The Calimex Cafe,4,What the trash  Really CALImex  Lmao this is NOT Cali mex. You apparently are unaware that a California burrito comes with guacamole and sour cream  not just french fries and where did you get these tortillas  taco bell  This is insulting and false advertising. If this is CALImex then taco bell is authentic Mexican food
Queen and King Cafe,1,I honestly didn t know what to expect from this place since it didn t have any reviews BUT I really enjoyed the food and drinks here  I ordered the American Snack which was absolute gas. It typically comes with cucumber  pickles  and mangos but the mangos were substituted with pineapples - not entirely sure why and would ve been nice to have been informed but the pineapples were at least still super sweet and yummy. I definitely recommend if you enjoy fruit with chamoy. My friend ordered The Kimura drink which was surprisingly very refreshing. It only had a slight carbonation to it  so it was very easy to drink down. I also appreciate how late they stay open.
Makenka Hot Truck,1,The owner is very friendly and engaging. we ordered the Chicken quesadilla with jalape os....absolutely incredible. They played music for us while we ate....make America HOT HOT    Would recommend 100  for authentic san Antonio street food.
Makenka Hot Truck,2,Really friendly owner  very passionate about making America hot   I got some chicken tacos in the afternoon - pretty basic flour tortillas with grilled chicken  fresh pico  and shredded cheese. They re bigger than a typical street taco and have a more American flavor profile  with the cheese and hot sauce. This food would go well with a beer or two.
Jack in the Box,1,I ve seen the horrible reviews for this location  but decided to come anyway since it s close to my house. Yes  the location isn t in a fabulous area. Every time I visit  it s late night and the whole night crew consists of the most awesome people on the planet and the best graveyard manager ever. They are hilarious  kind  and appreciative of their good customers. They don t tolerate when people act like idiots or are rude to staff  which is so refreshing. I hate how most companies allow their employees to get berated and abused by unreasonably anger customers. That being said  if you have an issue and are polite about it  they ll give you some of the best customer service you will ever experience.   Lack of star is only for the physical location.
Jack in the Box,2,Person in drive thru is clueless.  Tried to order a small hamburger with secret sauce. Asked to hold the ketchup and mustard. Was told they don t have it. This is bizarre because most restaurants still have it available. So I said ok  let s put the ketchup and mustard back on. She didn t understand.  I tried again.  She finally put the mustard back on and closed my order. WRONG  I had to get her back and asked her to cancel it and start over. She canceled it and ignored me. Don t go here 
Jack in the Box,3,Dining room locked at 11 00am.  Drive through guy rude and near impossible to hear.  We told the drive through guy two combos. He said  6 something.  Got to the window and of course it was just one.   Girl at the window said the door was jammed 
Jack in the Box,4,This is the place that goes the extra mile  that gives you three sauces instead of two  that puts napkins in your bag  that asks you what size instead of assuming a medium. And when this usually happens it s from that one skinny black dude at the drive thru window. Dude you deserve a raise   I will always appreciate you and that third bbq sauce. As for the rest of the staff that just gives me two when I order biggest meal of chicken strip with largest fries  insert explicit here 
Jack in the Box,5,Out of all jack in the box I ve been to this one is the best  Every time I stimulate my mind and I get the hunger I live literally 10mins away from there ... I order food up to  40 and EVERY TIME I get my food it s HOT I love it   By the time I get home still hot   and during this COVID-19 the workers did great masks on at all times  Great place to go eat on munching time 
Jack in the Box,6,Today at lunch I needed a quickie so my choice was Mickey D s or Jack in the Box.  So I drove thru the Jack in the Box drive thru and ordered the Jumbo Jack or the Rodney Allen Rippy burger as I call it.  The burger was its standard good as were the fries and drink  it didn t take too long to drive thru.  My perception is that the Rodney Allen Rippy burger is a lot smaller than when he was advertising them. For that matter who remembers Rodney anyway   Do you think they are smaller   Would I go back   Yes  next time I need a Rippy fix   BTW    Sometimes I go to Jack in the Box and they have a great burger special of some kind then the next time I go I can t get that burger any more  it drives me crazy.  BTW 2  Jack I find your commercials really funny most of the time 
Jack in the Box,7,Not good at all. Food tasted weird. Wasn t offered any condiments. Ordered a sprite and it was brown. Have no clue what was in it.
Jack in the Box,8,Kept getting sick Everytime I ate here  I wish the health department would do something about this place
Jack in the Box,9,If I could give no stars I would. I ordered 4 Havarti Ribeye burgers  cost nearly  25. Drove all the way home only to find out that the burgers had NO havarti sauce. I drove all the way back to let them no they gave me the All American and exchange them for the correct ones. The man stated that he made the burgers and made them right. They refused to remake the burgers and they refused a refund. Unless you are looking to raise your blood pressure DO NOT go to this Jack in the Box....worst place to eat ever    
Jack in the Box,10,I am not one to leave bad reviews  but this jack in the box location is absolutely worthless.  At least 75  of the time  something is broken. Either their fryer  milkshake machine  or order system is down. They run out of items  and sometimes don t even answer when you pull up. They re supposedly a 24 hour location.  To top it off  their phone number doesn t work so you can t even call ahead to make sure all is well.  Avoid this JIB  and just go to Bill Millers next door.
Jack in the Box,11,Service  was very bad  no one greeted us at the drive thru  than i had to repeat my order 3 times tk the lady  Finally we i go to pay i ask her if everything  is in the bag she says yes. I get home my burger wasn t  made the way i asked her to and it looked  like they slopped it together fries were old. I will never go to this jack in the  box again.  Beware people of the jack in the box.
Jack in the Box,12,I go to this jack almost everyday during my lunch break and I love it  I order my food and it takes about 5 top 8 minutes but that s when they have a lot of customers to attend of course  other then that I get my order super quick. The employees are super nice always greet me  smile and ask me  how are you . I have to Jack in the box near my house and even tho this one is like 5 minutes further I go to this one. My go to you can say all the times I have gone I ve never had a problem they always get my order correct and the one time they did they gave me extra fries and apologized  keep it up Jack.
Jack in the Box,13,I can think of many other places I d so rather eat a burger at  but when I m craving something after a long evening I like to pick up their tacos also helps that they carry my fave Rootbeer  Barqs  nothing but the best 
Jack in the Box,14,Oh. My. Gosh. I am SO mad at  fast food restaurant I could scream. I can only eat TWO items on their entire menu. Ordered them yesterday and didn t get them in the bag. Called and manager said to come back today. Today they say they are OUT of all salads     To top it off  I am in a lunch line of ten cars and can not get out     I m beyond upset.
Jack in the Box,15,This is the worst jack in the box in the history of jack in the box.first time here and will never go back just happened to be passing by headed to a softball game.the  child at the drive thru couldn t get the order down on a number 11 with a dr pepper and asked my wife 5 times if not more what she wanted .and messed the whole order up .avoid this place
Jack in the Box,16,Omg really 15 min in a drive through I m stuck in between cars. One way in can t get out ou back up cars behind u.  service is so slow  I just want my two things I ordered.
Variedades Marquez,1,I ve eaten there several times and love it.Pollo con tajadas baleadas and quesadillas are great.Cash only.
Envie,1,Cajun forward flavors on Mexican fare. Got the special of the night  Serrano hush puppies  which were accompanied with a remoulade that was a bit too acidic but worked well dipping the puppies in it. Got the fritas and added carne asada and Monterrey cheese  scrumptious combo  but I wish I had more of the sauce it came with. Got the Cajun elote which was very much so like a traditional Mexican corn in a cup with the Cajun remoulade  devoured it.   Got the fruit w ice cream and peach beignets and were freaking delightful.   5 out of 5.
Envie,2,Bland greasy food with spicy sauces  that was served cold by the time it got to me. If they want sauces that complement and rescue the food  there should be some bright  acidic options rather than mostly heavy dairy-based dips. I want to cheer on new business but they re not cutting it to wow me.
Torres Taqueria #2,1,Been going to this place for years now... no idea why it took so long for the food truck to finally appear on yelp. Anyways I adore this place. The owner makes her tacos really warm cuz she cooks them  does it at a lightning fast speed  and she has amazing salsa you can squirt onto your tacos for free. The tacos are very very cheap costing 2-2.5 dollars a taco. Burritos and quasadillos are very cheap as well. Really I consider this place to be the best taco truck in Austin  but it s located inside of a bar called Local Pub  amp  Patio so not many will hear about it. I recommend it highly  support her business.
Torres Taqueria #2,2,Great taco.  My order seemed to be produced with cartoonish speed  and it was piping hot.  I got the pastor and the bistec tacos.  The kid in the window asked if I wanted them  with everything   which seemed to mean with cilantro  onion  avocado  lettuce     and shredded cheese.  Both tacos were just very tasty bites and I would recommend this taco to anyone.  The price is very reasonable as well and the atmosphere is very casual.  I would say the only thing that could improve it would be to grill toast the tortillas.
Casa Jaliscienses,1,Green sauce is HAWT   Just so ya know  It was a creamier kind of consistency  but it was good. Salsa didn t pack as much heat  so for me  I preferred it. Chips came out nice and warm  so my 1st impression was definitely a good one.   I ordered the  50- which was the Mexican. 3 enchiladas  one covered with white sauce  one with green sauce and one with red sauce. For me  perfect   I hate having to pick only one sauce on my enchiladas. Re-fried beans were good- thick  but light in color. Rice  I never care for Spanish rice  but I did eat theirs. Maybe that s because all the cheese and sauces stuck to my rice  and well  you cant go wrong there  lol I was happy with my dish.   My boys both ordered the cheese  amp  chicken quesidillas  which came with beans and rice too. Very big servings for  3.99  Quesidilla was pretty damn good too    The teenager girls ordered crispy beef tacos  and a fajita chicken flour taco. All said they tasted good  BUT  the beef was drowning in grease.   Great service yesterday afternoon. Fast and hot food. Id definitely return to try other items  Huge menu  and very reasonably priced.
Casa Jaliscienses,2,Found a COCKROACH in to go food at the house in Round Rock and threw away immediately.  Returned to get a refund and was denied until I brought back trash  a trip that would take a good hour going back and forth.   No se que hacer. Yo muy contento de probar una rica sopa de tortilla y un caldito de mariscos por primera ves k hasta compre otro para llevarle a la mama.  Ya en camino a casa yo muy contento de dejarles una rica cena me manda una foto de su comida con una CUCARACHA haogada.  Bueno  ya entiendo accidentes passan pero al pedir un rembolso me dicen que soy peor que una mujer y se niegaron hasta que no regreseara a round rock y recolectar los caldos de l basura porque el mio que regrese estaba  limpio .  Restaurante Casa Jalicisiences  Due o Cocinero Don Roberto Marquez
Casa Jaliscienses,3,They need to improve their standards. The burritos are tasteless and the chicken is often too dry. Step up your game  put some love in your cooking and you ll have way more customers.
Casa Jaliscienses,4,Plus  Good chips - bonus points for having that delicious creamy green salsa  Restaurant is clean with an old school feel  well worn tables and chairs .   Minus  A la carte burrito is  3.99. Taquerias on the north side are about a dollar cheaper.  The chicken fajita burrito I ordered arrived sitting on top of a small glob of sour cream  which is not really ok for me. I don t like sour cream on my mexi food. Also - the ingredients on the menu didn t list sour cream  so I wonder if the people there are just wicked crazy with the creama for some reason   The burrito was a C . The beans were kinda runny and overall flavor was a bit bland. The sour cream didn t help  but the creamy green salsa did manage to save the day and spice things up a bit.
Casa Jaliscienses,5,I enjoy the food  but the service is a bit slow. A few friends and I popped in during a moped rally. We had about 45 minutes  which we figured was plenty of time to kick back and eat. By the time our food arrived  we barely had time to wolf it down and hustle out of the restaurant.  I ve eaten Mexican all over the country  and Mexico  and never had to wait that long.
Casa Jaliscienses,6,Salsa wasn t bad  chips were okay... but the hamburger in the burrito had a taste that turned me off completely. Stopped before even getting half way through it. Don t think the staff spoke English  which was only a small issue since I pointed to things on the menu.  - 
Casa Jaliscienses,7,Horrible. The one word that describes my experience here at this restaurant. Went there for lunch with me and my co-workers. As we arrived  sat down ordered out drinks and 3 or 4 other parties  8-10 ppl tops  showed. Those others parties had their food orders ready before ours. After waiting 40-45 mins for our food we ha no choice but to get up and leave before our food showed up bc we only had a hr. lunch. As we were paying the cashier informed us our food was ready if we wanted it to go and apologized because some one on their staff got the ticket orders...well out of order. Smh. We paid for our drinks  2.75 and left w o our food and went back to wk with an empty stomach. Yay 
Casa Jaliscienses,8,So after scouring Yelp to find a delicious  non-tex mex Mexican food restaurant  we ended up here by mistake. That is what happens when you forget to write down the name and address of the place at which you initially intend to eat.  The restaurant looks promising  it s cute  clean  the menu looks good  and the salsa is great.  The food  however... not so great. I ordered a mixed plate and received a beef enchilada  beef tostada  and beef flauta. That is a lot of beef  and unfortunately  the beef was kind of terrible. It had some weird seasoning that made it spicy but undelicious. Also  my plate came with two ice-cream-sized scoops of sour cream  which is  in my opinion  the signature of a tex-mex restaurant rather than a Mexican restaurant.  My husband ordered steak fajitas  which were fatty  and were served with an unidentifiable meat. The menu said bacon  but he is pretty sure it was a type of sausage.  I am definitely no snob when it comes to Mexican food. Some of the best food that I ve ever had has come from questionable  dodgy taco trucks on the side of the road in Guaymas. Good Mexican food should be three things  cheap  unpretentious  and delicious. This place was unpretentious... and that s all.   Both of us went home with stomachaches  and a longing for delicious Sonoran-style Mexican food.
Casa Jaliscienses,9,I love this place. I usually eat here on the way to or from the airport. The folks at the restaurant recognize me and are very friendly. I ve even been for  0.99 breakfast tacos in the morning. Those are great too. I typically get iced tea and a tostada with no sour cream.  I ve had several different things on the menu. The portions are healthy and the quality of the food is good. I think the biggest value is the chicken and tortilla soup. You get 1 4 or more chicken in a huge bowl of soup with some vegetables sliced into it. I highly recommend this East Cesar Chavez restaurant.
Tasty Abe's,1,If you want authentic Mexican food  then Tasty Abe s will be your favorite spot  The tacos are absolutely fantastic. The pastor taco was my favorite  but I had one of each  and I could have totally eaten a bunch more. Everything here is seriously delicious and they use authentic Mexican spices  homemade salsas  and of course  queso fresco. You really can t go wrong with the taste  quality  and price of Tasty Abe s 
La Terraza,1,Does anyone like Mariachi   Well  every Friday night starting at about 7 30 La Terraza has live Mariachi music.  The band last night was great  and they played for hours.  Just know when you eat here on a Friday evening  it s not going to be a quiet night.  Alright  now the food.  Recently La Terraza outted as one the places that received a very low food and safety rating  but according to a local news station  they have since cleaned up their act.  I was still a little skeptical when I first arrived and ordered  but was soon pleasantly surprised by the fresh taste and the delicious food that was served.  Plus  even though I ate too much  I didn t get a queasy stomach which sometimes happens after I eat greasy Mexican.  I didn t visit the kitchen  because that would be weird   so I don t know what went on there.  And out of weariness of their previous food and safety rating  I took away one star.   Sound fair 
La Terraza,2,I think I would have had the same experience at a Taco Bell.  Everything was  meh .  This is very  americanized  tex mex -not nasty  but nothing spectacular either.    The Crispy Taco Dinner was ordered which comes with your standard rice and beans.  I wish I could tell these tex mex places that when you make a taco...drain as much moisture off the meat as possible.  Dont just put the meat in there soaking wet...the bottoms fell out of each one of my shells and I was pretty dissapointed.   The Fiesta Mexican Dinner was also ordered.  Two beef enchiladas topped with chile con carne  one crispy taco  chile con queso  quacamole and your standard refired beans and rice.  This one also gets a  meh .  The queso that we ordered tasted like the queso that comes out of jar from the grocery store.  I think it may have been made with that canned sysco cheese.   I used a  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Frestaurant.com amp s c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  restaurant.com  a  coupon and our whole bill came out to  9.00.  I am glad too because I dont think it was worth any more than that.
La Terraza,3,In February  I went to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and  more importantly  to spend a week with a man I was madly in love with. We had a stupid fight on Lundi Gras and I ended up spending my Mardi Gras afternoon driving back to Texas. I could not get home fast enough -- made an 8-hour drive in about 6 1 2 hours. And when I got back  since I needed to really FEEL like I was in Texas again  La Terraza is the first place I went.  Granted  I have not been to every Mexican restaurant in the known universe  but La Terraza s food is among the best I have ever had -- everything from the steak tampiquena to the old standbys like cheese enchiladas is absolutely brilliant. The atmosphere is wonderful -- it s a spacious place and very clean -- and the service is always prompt and attentive. Parking can be a little tricky  but it s worth driving around the lot a couple of times just to sit in an authentic Mexican restaurant and eat some tasty authentic Mexican food.
La Terraza,4,This place is out of business... There is much better available around the corner from this place.  Oh  and it was located in 78741  not 78704.  Someone obviously does not know their zip codes.
Jack in the Box,1,Let me begin with the fact that  Yes  I am writing a review of a Jack In The Box. Why I feel I have to put myself through this is an exercise between my id and a suitable psychological diagnostician  but I digress.  A little over two years ago my family and I stopped in to JItB  another location entirely  as we were new to the area and never eaten at one before- the food was of institutional quality and the place didn t look to have had a solid cleaning in months. I won t be much further on that one as it s been a while and things might ve changed drastically since then... but it left an impression.  As fate would have it  today my boss and I were working nearby and we completely blew through normal lunch hours but feeling the need for some food before blood sugar issues arose and we began spouting Monty Python quotes at each other  we drove to the area and with limited time he spotted this particular establishment and chose it as our destination.  I was reticent  due to the quality of the previous experience  but a  Well  it HAD been a long time  b  we were on a pressed schedule  and c  the boss said  go here. We went inside.  Good points  the staff was friendly enough. Good marks. The food was  as expected.  It arrived within a reasonable period of time.  Bad marks  hence the necessity for this review at all  Is there some sort of corporate policy against cleaning for this franchise  How about building maintenance   The floors were dirty and hadn t seen a mop in who knows how long. Spilled drinks on unoccupied tables  a men s room whose  out off  sic  order  sign looks to have been reposted enough times to warrant several stickers to keep the sign in place  something seemed to be growing from a suspended ceiling design element over the cashier queue  grease-adhered dust on everything in the kitchen area that wasn t within easy reach of most employees.  Here s a question  how does an ice machine suspended six feet up and higher over the drinks machine get encrusted with fingerprints  Was there an NBA team using it for high-touch contests in it s recent past  I m not sure.  There was what seemed to be a climate control box mounting on the wall behind my table  the sad fate of the box itself is a mystery that will never be solved. The blank wire terminal connections sticking sadly out of the plate at about shoulder height post only a danger to snagged clothes as  thank God  those sort of controls are not generally high voltage.  The condition of the paint on the walls was a cry for help  and one could tell that the benches along the center wall had never been moved in recent geological time as several definable strata of dirt had accumulated behind the legs  in easy view of all. A broom hadn t been of practical use when someone s inate fears of having to move a bench during cleaning was Simply Too Much and I Can t Even for the cleaning crew.  I fear that my Two Strikes and I m Out rule will have to apply for Jack In The Box  my only misgiving is that the people were nice.
Jack in the Box,2,Why y all be hiring crack heads and wanna be gangster kids cause they be messing up people order  equality
Jack in the Box,3,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO JUST DRIVE A LITTLE FURTHER TO ANOTHER JACK IN THE BOX OR TO ANOTHER PLACE ALL TOGETHER   hORRIBLE ANY TIME OF THE DAY    Every time I come here it has been the worst experience ever... you try to call and the phone number doesn t work.. there has been 2 times where I have gotten the complete wrong order... I came in there after I called a different jack in the box letting them know what happened and they said I should be able to bring in my receipt and let them know what happened. Well a day later I brought in the receipt. The manager was I m sorry for my language but a real bitch... she said that their phones don t work and she didn t care what another jack in the box said.. I asked what she was going to do about me not getting my order and receiving someone else meal.. she said she couldn t do anything about it since I wasn t able to call.. are you serious   It s right by my hotel and the only fast food place around so of course I went there again tonight thinking it d be any better since it was way later in the day with different workers.. nope worse service actually.. this time they weren t taking my order. So I had to yell a couple times saying hello   Some lady got on and said who is this.. wow.. I then starting ordering and she kept saying  is that it. Is that it  is that it..  with and attitude. I go to pull up and apparently they told the guy in front of me to reverse back a little so it didn t mess up their time.. No that s not the way this works. If you are so worried about your time than maybe you should fix that instead of cheating the system.. nothing but bad experiences every time.  Oh yea I didn t even mention about the fries or curly fries I haven t gotten have been soggy and disgusting every time. I ordered fries the first two times and they were soggy so the next couple times I ordered curly fries and they were the same..   If you don t like your job get a new one or don t take it out on your customers..   This location should be shut down or fire the employees that are currently working here...  Something needs to be done about this..
Jack in the Box,4,While running errands for me  my son went through the drive thru on the  E Rundberg location. After he placed the order using my debit card. He didn t get it back. When noticed he didn t have it  he immediately went back up there. The employee was outside was the one in drive-thru said  you forgot your card   I ll go get it. She came back claiming she doesn t know what happened to it. After waiting  he contacted me  and tried calling  of course no answer. I then contacted APD  amp  ask for them to meet me up there. I went inside  requested the mgr. after telling her what happened  amp  APD was on their way  amp  it would be best to look for it.  Mgr. said it had nothing to do with her. After heated debate  amp  mgr. accusing my son of either having in car or he lost it and should just cancel my card. The girl went to go look for it and guess what card appeared out of the blue. I asked the mgr to apologize. Her comment it had nothing to do with me They had 6 or 7 other customers cards. Now I will still have to cancel my card  cause most likely they took a picture. These are well known scams done in Houston. Do not visit this location  if you choose too  word to all pay cash   keep your receipt   amp  count your change. Better find another location. I don t do business at this location at all. My son was just in that area  but never again 
Jack in the Box,5,After 10pm are y all really closed because hours online are ambiguous and when I go through the drive thru  a dude answers that either the systems are down or that they are not taking orders at the moment  or just complete silence. Then I spin around the building and there s a mans twiddling on his phone. Is this what the franchisees paying for  Asking for a friend.
Jack in the Box,6,I went there yesterday to pick up some tacos for my son the guy behind the counter was very rude when ordering I asked for six tacos no sauce picked up my order looked at it it had sauce on it went inside told the guy hey we do my order I said no sauce he tells me to we don t need your kind here and tells me to leave will never eat there again also they look like they were on drugs to Hispanic guys their eyes the way they were acting will never eat there again
Jack in the Box,7,We were looking for a place to stop in for a restroom visit. This location is right off the I-35. They require a code to enter the bathrooms  separate code for men and women  and offer it only to customers. I was happy to buy a loaded breakfast sandwich in exchange for the secret code  The sandwich was good despite being a little too salty for my taste.  Our server Enelidad was friendly and great.
Jack in the Box,8,This is one of the worst jack in the box I have ever visited. Very dirty and unclean store  amp  restroom. Flies around. Horrible customer service with attitude. Felt very sad the way it is been maintained and the employee customer service.
Jack in the Box,9,Good service   staff is friendly. Food is good. But they take FOREVER to give you the food   no kidding   they took about 20mins.
Jack in the Box,10,so is this location open 24hrs  by drive through  if not please change your time. don t advertise something that is false.
Jack in the Box,11,I ve given this JitB 5 chances. Each time it has been extremely crappy service. No one will acknowledge that you are standing at the counter  that is inexcusably poor customer service. If I walk up to your counter  say  Hello . If you are crazy busy the least you can do is say  be right with you  do not pretend not to see your customers. I m going to Fran s 
Jack in the Box,12,Food was average  service was friendly  dinning room was clean  overall a typical jack in the box. 4stars because dinning room was suppose to be open at 5 but they didn t open it until 6ish and their breakfast burrito was smaller than other jack in the box and it was sloppy looking. But since it is fast food I still think they deserve four stars because it s to be expected.
Jack in the Box,13,Would give this place 0 5 if I could. Driving through on our way back home and had an emergency and had to use the bathroom. Guy literally wouldn t give us the bathroom code because we did not want to buy anything. RUDE RUDE RUDE service and attitude. Don t come to this location.
Jack in the Box,14,Very expensive for mediocre food. I ordered 2 tacos that were inedible. Fortunately my husband gave me his curly fries or I would have been going hungry. His meal was decent. My daughter had a kids meal which was ok. This location is not in a good area. I felt tense the whole time.
Jack in the Box,15,This jack in the box had improved a lot over the years  amp  impressed me a lot I live about a minute away driving so it s pretty close  amp  has good quality  amp  service  but the drive thru could be a little fast ohh  amp  them churros though omg they re delicious  
Jack in the Box,16,This place is so lacking  There is only one good worker and I think she is a manager she has lite brown hair with blondish highlights  she always remembers my order for coffee  she gets 5 stars . Unfortunately she was not there this morning and the other woman was there she SUCKS  She never listens to request  I always ask for a spoon to mix my coffee I don t want a wimpy plastic stick... didn t get it. She never fills up the cup of coffee even when I tell her to  I can understand leaving 1 2 for spill factor but 3 fingers short is too much  She has the process where you hand her your card and she gives your order and then stands there for a second and you have to ask her... Can I get my card back  She says Yes and gives it back with your receipt. Which I can t stand because I have left before with out my card and had to drive back to get it. She is just not the sharpest tool in the shed. So my 2 stars are for and her listening skills 
El Kioskito Cakes,1,Grabbed some breakfast tacos here this morning. Pretty good. The green salsa had a nice kick. The tortilla was delicious. The guy was super nice and spoke Spanish and English. They take card.
El Kioskito Cakes,2,Food truck in parking lot of Valero on Kramer Lamar intersection. Stopped in for some breakfast tacos  good prices  around  1.75 each and all were tasty and had plenty of egg and fillings.  I had the egg and bacon  really good   cactus  amp  egg  again really good  and a potato and egg  nice potato chunks    We had the green and red salsa.  The green salsa was pretty spicy  use carefully and the red salsa was a bit smoky  but not by much. The tortillas were thin and made a quick visit to the grill before being filled. Each taco was consistent in size  just the right amount of filling so that things aren t flying out and hitting the plate but enough to satisfy your taste buds.  This food truck has a small covered area with picnic tables  but we opted to take home.  Friendly cook and speaks english well. Worthy of repeat visits for sure  4 5 .
Delicios Luvianos,1,This was my first visit to this truck  parked next to a produce stand and another truck selling aquas frescas  about 1 2 block west of IH35 on the south side of Rundberg. I came in search of breakfast tacos at nearly 11am  which is sometimes hard to find in trucks that switch over to lunch at that time. Upon arrival I saw 2 young mothers with toddlers walk by with a plate of milanesa and another that looked like enchiladas perhaps. Both plates screamed YUM   But I continued on with my trek for breakfast.  I ordered 2 tacos with egg  bacon and cheese  adding pico de gallo to one  and boy was I glad I did   Both tacos were on handmade flour tortillas which were thin  yet pliable and strong enough to hold a generous amount of filling. These tacos aren t the little type rolled into foil packets of 3  these were hearty tacos served on a foil-coveted plate  with a thoughtful slice of lime. The pico was fragrant  fresh and crunchy  and they added pieces of avocado to it.  Soooo delicious  and it made for a juicy taco. I will most definitely order their pico de gallo again. The bacon was obviously fresh-made as well--no fake bits found here--and generously added as well. The green salsa was the creamy type that we all love  with mild spice. The red sauce was not a salsa  but a blended sort that would take me awhile to discern its elements. It had medium heat. Not that I didn t like the red  but I personally preferred the green.  I will definitely be back to check out their Flautas  one of my favorites  as well as their Tacos al Pastor  for which I am on a constant hunt for the perfect rendition. Oh  and although the owners are natural Spanish speakers  the lady at the window could communicate well with English. They DO accept credit cards  but I believe there is a 3.  discount for cash transactions.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,1,Driving around this past Tuesday looking for a trailer not mobbed with Out Of Towner SXSW-ers  we found this.  An old fashioned  throw back taco trailer necx to a convenience store.  Picnic tables under an awning  The menu looked promising  lots of old taco trailer faves with some added twists.  Taqueria spelled with a  k  and a  k  subbed in any word normally containing and  qu . Anyway.  Ordered a bistek tako  and champakan tako  which was actually homemade chorizo  and a torta with an incredibly long name.  Ten bucks.  What we got  Two tacos with meat that  was seasoned impeccably  each atop two tiny  thick homemade tortillas and the BIGGEST damn torta ya ever did see filled with   are you ready       refritos and mayo on the bottom bun  good white Mexi cheese broiled till bubbly and brown on the top bun.  In between was tomato  avocado  pickled jalapenos  onion  ham  milanesa and an egg scrambled with sliced hotdogs.  yes folks  hot dogs. Did I mention it was the size of a small space ship   The guy brought out a squirt bottle of green sauce  which I typically hate but devoured  and a squirt bottle of dark  smokey red sauce.  Oh My Gosh   This  torta was stupid good  Tthe staff is super friendly.  When I told one of the guys I was gonna Yelp em he said  Cool  but just come back and see us again  . I definitely will  with many many friends.
Tortas Tampico 512 ATX,1,Behind the Valero on Parkfield at Rutland you ll find a trio of food trucks that share picnic table seating. One truck Honduran  one Mexican  and then this Torta truck  serving Tampico-style Mexican items. Their portions are  huge  one Torta would probably take me 3 meals to finish  but I witnessed a man wrangle the monstrous sandwich in his huge hands  finished it  ordered another  finished it  then went to the order window again   This man needs to enter a contest or something   But it attests to the delicious of the Torta  I m sure. All the ingredients looked very fresh. I  on the other hand  ordered off-menu   large pork tamales  wrapped in banana leaves  mild in flavor  not spicy   served with a yummy black bean dipping sauce and salsa verde with cilantro and onion. Both salsas were mild. I also got a creamy salsa verde which was a bit thinner in consistency than what we might get at other Austin trucks  but nonetheless yummy. One of these tamales would probably be at least the equivalent of 2 Tex-Mex style  so the price of  3.50 each was reasonable.  If I had any criticisms  I would prefer a ratio of more filling to the masa on the tamales  and I found that although the filling was juicy  the masa was crumbly  but  if you hand-hold the whole thing  it would probably work out better than using a fork. The masa went well with the bean sauce  which was a tad salty  but made for a delicious combo.
Birrieria Lopez Cabrera,1,BEST BIRRIA TACOS EVER  I m absolutely in love. IT s everything I thought it would be and more  So much meat and cheese. I got the 3 quesobirria tacos and consume  10 10   HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Cant wait to come back and get the birria pizza to share with my friends- a better bang for your buck  And I could finish the 3 I got because they were big  I could only eat 1 1 2 a serving.
Birrieria Lopez Cabrera,2,I m a recent convert to Birria Tacos  so when I spotted this food truck  I pulled over. I had just finished lunch  so I ordered one to go.   The service was fast and friendly  and my taco was neatly packaged for the trip. There s a nice covered seating area for those who are eating there. The menu has plenty of options  from my single taco to full meal specials  burritos  Fortas  pambazos  and sopes.   My taco was excellent when I reheated it many hours later. Can t wait to try one fresh 
Tres Monarcas,1,This is a pretty great little taco truck.  Prices are super reasonable  portions are ample  and the food is really good.   I ve been several times for breakfast tacos and had a great experience every time.  The tortillas are nicely toasted  the meats are of good quality  and the eggs have great texture.  They also have burgers  but I haven t tried them.  Recommended 
Taqueria Jazmin’s Cafe,1,The best taqueria taco truck in Austin love this place tacos de bistec are so delicious Will definitely come back it s an amazing place so clean and great service the salsas are the best
Traila Jalicienses,1,The food is great and fresh  wish I would ve taken pictures before devouring it all. When I m back here  which is a guarantee  I ll make sure to take pictures of my next meal. Quality and quantity are on par  the service is great and the workers are extremely nice and social. Highly recommend you order the tacos de adobada with cheese and avocado  But surely anything that you get off of their menu is guaranteed to make you want to come back
Taqueria La Guadalupana,1,This is amazing food  fresh  bright  and hearty. The lengua is my favorite  Gorditas and queso fresco with some red chili.....who can ask for more    
Zapata Taqueria,1,This is a really nice small Taco joint right next to Austin Cornerstone Church. They re open Friday  Saturday and Sunday 7 PM to 3 30  AM. I really like the fajita tacos and al pastor tacos. Definitely worth a try 
Tacos Morelos,1,Nice  spicy salsa roja.  Tasty corn tortillas.  Amazing tacos al pastor.  Friendly woman working and good prices.  Go there now 
Tacos Morelos,2,Tacos Morelos serves up some good authentic tacos out of a trailer in the parking lot of a Shell gas station at the corner of Ben White  amp  S Congress. Not sure of their hours but they are open early serving breakfast tacos and open till at least 5PM.   I had only had their breakfast tacos until this past week when I stopped by for lunch and tried Chicharrone for the first time. Fried pork rind tacos must be an acquired taste that I am not willing to work on. However the Al Pastor was delicious and I love their Ham and Egg breakfast tacos. Breakfast tacos are 1.50 or 10 for 10.00. The other tacos are 2.00 and they also serve Tortas  Burritos  Quesadillas and Gorditas for 4.00.
