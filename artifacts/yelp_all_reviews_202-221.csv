La Montaña Tacos,1,I did it. I came back when I visited Austin again. Damn was it worth it  The tacos were just as good as I remember  though the prices have  reasonably  increased a bit. Still very affordable though  especially when compared to larger  less-delicious  gentrified tacos you can find at places that rhyme with  Porchy s Pacos.  The pastor tacos remain the undefeated champ  but the carnitas and tinga tacos also earned their spots in the winners  circle.
La Montaña Tacos,2,I ve been looking around for the best breakfast tacos in this area and landed on La Monta a. Homemade tortillas with a perfect flavor stuffed with bacon  egg  cheese and grilled jalape os is what gets me moving in the morning. Highly recommended this place.   Don t let the appearance full you. This place slams.   Note to owner... If you painted your sign  you d get more business. Keep up the amazing cooking because you ve now become my favorite Mexican restaurant in town 
La Montaña Tacos,3,Best. Street. Tacos. In. Town. Period. Well priced food items. And next door is the juice store if you feel like going all in. People are very nice.
La Montaña Tacos,4,Ever come across a place and wondered how come I missed this while browsing....I had to go to the first review and its been open since 2017...after our Breakfast Taco outing  I though about how much I have missed out. These Tacos are excellent  ....Scratch made flour tortilla all day....We both had the same....Chorizo  Egg and Cheese and a Bacon  Egg and Cheese...You dont expect much on presentation when getting BT to go  but this place is different. Served flat on a tray and covered with foil...Looking at it made them all that much better. Permanent Book mark for this place.
La Montaña Tacos,5,Note  This review is for their new north location  on Pond Springs  After a lovely Sunday of buying awesome Mexican Metal yard art with which to adorn our fences and deck  the hubs and I were craving some serious Mexican eats  We found La Montana here on Yelp  and away we went    First  I just have to pay homage to that INCREDIBLE  and strong   frozen margarita that we had  I opted for a large  and it was. Hubby and I shared it  and we both felt like we were whisked straight back to Cancun  Seriously delightful  and not too sweet   Equally delightful were the chips and salsa  The chips there are reminiscent of Houston s legendary Ninfa s on Navigation  if you re familiar with that yummy place  Thin and crispy  And that salsa  Beyond fresh and bright  y all  We could have easily polished off two or three baskets with a vat of salsa    On to the meal   My husband had the Tinga  the Asada  and the Trompo tacos  just to get a feel for the place  and he was BLOWN away by the deliciousness and the authenticity of each of them  He said that he could easily imagine himself buying them from a street vendor in Mexico  which is the highest compliment  What makes them even more special is the gorgeous and warm handmade corn tortillas that they arrived in. Topping them with a bit of that aforementioned salsa made them just that much more dreamy for him    If you thought that my husband was losing his mind over the tacos  it was officially BLOWN by La Montana s Caldo de Res  Suffice it to say that HE LOVED IT  Caldo is his jam  and this one was simply the best that he s ever had. He called it stupidly crave-worthy and absolutely perfect. Full stop. You can trust him on that  if you re the caldo sort  Go grab some ASAP    As for me  after that enormous rita and all of those chips and salsa  I opted for just one Beef Fajita Taco with a side of crema  and it was AWESOME  I could totally see what hubs was talking about with his taco love  It was legit    Speaking of legit  this is authentic Mexican food  which is definitely what we were looking for  If you re looking for that oozy  gooey  cheesy Tex Mex-style Mexican food  you might want to hit up Matt s  but  if you re down to take a stroll through Mexico proper  gastronomically-speaking  hit up La Montana  You ll love it  The price is right  too  No downsides  Only ups    They re relatively new at this location  so they could definitely use your patronage  particularly during these times  Go grab a margarita  and say hi to our adorable server  Leniel  while you re there  Cheers  y all 
La Montaña Tacos,6,I honestly can not say much about the food  given that I haven t tried everything they offer. What I have gotten was the carnitas  beef fajitas tacos  rotisserie chicken  and chicken sopes.  Carnitas are very hit or missed  they could be better especially if the consumer had the option to have it with all they mix with the carnitas or WITHOUT  just plain carnitas.  Beef fajitas tacos are good  mainly because the corn tortilla is hand made   Love the rotisserie chicken   Sopes are good.  The problem is the rudeness of the employees  Worst part owner is there most of the time and doesn t do nor say anything to them.  Over the phone orders are a nightmare  Make sure  no matter how busy they are  to have them repeat your order to you and make sure you check your order when you receive it before leaving 
La Montaña Tacos,7,I go here in the morning for the breakfast tacos and I think they are one of the top spots of Austin. They move really quick and are consistent every morning.
La Montaña Tacos,8,I ve been looking for a breakfast taco spot for soooo long  These are authentic Mexican tacos and the prices aren t bad either. The service was  also quick  This place is easy to miss but def worth stopping by and trying.
La Montaña Tacos,9,Love their menudo  amp  ceviche  They have really good food but those are my go to. But my absolute favorite is their ceviche   
La Montaña Tacos,10,Excellent  quality  inexpensive tacos and mexican food. This is a local small business primarily frequented by the spanish speaking community  and as as result I consider it authentic tacos and flavors. It s not comparable to the  taco delis  and other chain stores.   Some of the tacos come with a slice of lime so you can add that perfect touch of tangy  citrus flavor right before you enjoy them with  or without  some of the house sauce  it s spicy more than flavorful .  My go-tos meats on tacos and quesadilla   asada   beef fajita and tinga  chicken . You can do 1 2 half on the large quesadilla or try a mini one depending on your hunger level. The mexican rice is some of the best I ve had and it s a nice side  even if you just stick to the tacos.  Call in to place a pick-up order  as they make everything fresh and you may have to wait otherwise. If you have time  check out the small juice place nextdoor. They only speak spanish  but don t let that stop you... It s fantastic freshly squeezed juice that s made to order   cheap   -- my personal favorite is the OJ.
La Montaña Tacos,11,Real mexican tacos. Im glad I could find the real taste of Mexico in the Austin area 
La Montaña Tacos,12,This review is for the Pond Springs location.  I ordered take out.  The menudo was hands down the best I ve ever had.   My son wanted the chicken enchiladas and ate the entire plate which was more than enough for 2 adults and he s 8   I had the lingua and barbacoa tacos and wish I had ordered more.  They serve goat on Sundays and I can t wait to go   Don t skip this gem.  The staff are amazing and you can tell they love what they do.
La Montaña Tacos,13,Note  Pond Springs location review- Went back during dinner for more yumminess... it was still good  but ... when we walked in we were told we can sit where we want by a young lady who had her kids in a stroller... I guess she is the hostess  amp  didn t have any child care that night  During our visit she strolled around the restaurant multiple times with the kids. The salsa wasn t as fresh... it was different than our first visit... it was fresh  just not the same recipe  so that was disappointing  as I love my chips n salsa.  It didn t have that Bang- i just made this salsa taste.  The flautas were still good... just still wishing for some crunchy grilled tacos.
La Montaña Tacos,14,We totally took a chance...it s a little hole in the wall a bit out of the way but the food was so yummy. I am a hard sell and I was thrilled. I highly recommend this place. If I lived here  I would go back again. Reasonable prices 
La Montaña Tacos,15,Authentic  hole in the wall  delicious Mexican food  Tacos and soup were all tasty  Will be coming back.
La Montaña Tacos,16,Loved it. I got the eggs and ham plate . My son got two mini chicken quesadillas. And my boyfriend got some tacos. Unfortunately he doesn t remember what kind. But he said he would totally eat there again   Definitely recommend.
La Montaña Tacos,17,This place exceeded expectations    The tacos were delicious the staff was friendly and willing to help with the menu.  The only down side is the dining area is a bit small  so be prepared to wait for a table  but the food makes the wait worth it.  Only reason why i didn t give it five starts is due to the trompo pastor tacos were dry.
La Montaña Tacos,18,Be still  my taco-loving heart  for we have found the promised land. Lo  and behold  it s located in a mucky-looking shopping strip at the corner of Middle Fiskville and Braker. The interior  however  is as spotless as any good Mexican abuela would have it.  I melted when I saw the taco lady pinching off rounds of dough for the made-to-order tortillas  pausing only to give a stir to the giant cauldron of refried beans with a wooden spoon as tall as her. I knew right then that my taco dreams had come true.  4 tacos with three items each came out to a mere  6.50. Apologies for not being able to pause for a photo before devouring my prize. I did  however  snap a photo of the most LEGIT salsas I ve had this side of the Rio Grande  excuse the dirty plate .   They don t have much seating so if you go at a busy time it s probably best to take it to-go  which is probably better lest you make onlookers uncomfortable whilst inadvertently recreating THAT scene from  When Harry Met Sally.  It s that good  y all     4 stars for now since I ve only been once. I have no doubt I ll be updating this with a fifth star.
La Montaña Tacos,19,Terrific tacos. Like. Terrific.  Seating is hard to come by  and every time I go  there s a line. The line moves quickly  but the food isn t super fast. Tortillas are hand-made and delicious.
La Montaña Tacos,20,Just Fantastic the tortillas are homemade the people are friendly. All the tacos are good I didn t find one that I didn t like.
La Montaña Tacos,21,The best tacos I ve had hands down. Coming from Colorado  there is an abundance of Authentic Mexican food  however nothing in Colorado quite hit the mark like how La Monta a Tacos did. I got the Al Pastor  Asada  cow head  and tongue. All were equally delicious and had tons of meat in each taco  they did not go skimpy at all  The tortillas were also homemade which really added to the taco. The salsas there were very spicy but to me tolerable. This place is definitely a go to if you re wanting authentic Mexican tacos. So good 
La Montaña Tacos,22,If you re looking for authentic tacos  this is the place to go. I shamefully prefer more Americanized tacos a la OneTaco  but I d definitely be down to come back.  Pros  - Excellent service. I dropped my tacos outside and they replaced my order free of charge and cleaned up the mess before I got to pick it up. - Customizable. I don t like vegetables and they accommodated. You can also ask for guac  different types of salsas  and limes. - Affordable. I got 2 asadas and 1 chorizo  total was  6.50 for imo good portions. I usually get 2 tacos and OneTaco and got 3 here  so they re on the smaller side  but I felt quite full on 3. Note I tend to have a smaller stomach than most.  Cons  - Lack of vegetarian variety. I went with a vegetarian and he said there was only potato and cucumber tacos. Both were good according to him but both are cooked on the same flat top as meat  so if this bothers you  take note. - Small and hot. We went during lunch hour and there wasn t enough indoor seating. There s outdoor seating and today it felt equally hot inside and out.  Edit  I added a photo of my tacos but it doesn t appear to be linked to the review.
La Montaña Tacos,23,I m not going to say these are the best tacos I have ever eaten  but they are the best tacos I have ever eaten in an air conditioned room.  Their tortillas  corn at least  are made in house and are deliccious.  They have a trompo and the al pastor tacos are delicious. The Cabeza tacos were amazing as were the chicarron  and the tripas.  My wife had the flautas  not a dish I have been a fan of before.  I usually find them too dry to be edible.  But here I finished half her plate.  As my neighborhood gentrifies these are the types of amazing places we need to support 
La Montaña Tacos,24,Tasty and authentic mexican tacos  Fresh tortillas with plenty of fillings. I loved them. I recommend the carnitas and tinga tacos. I saw that they were serving flauta plates and they looked yummy. I will order next time I go. Super easy to order. Also they have a variety of mexican drinks to pick. I went with a mango Boing. I will definitely return for more.
La Montaña Tacos,25,Try their new location on Pond Springs Road  Full-size  sit down restaurant with full  large  bar. More than tacos  too  Not Tex Mex  but authentic  Everything is awesome   Just opened 
La Montaña Tacos,26,Gave this place a try because it had great reviews  but I was left feeling very disappointed.  My wait for 6 tacos was very long. While waiting for my order  I received a lot of stares like I did not belong there  I am not hispanic   and that alone made me feel very uncomfortable.  Once I made it home  I realized they got my order wrong  and the tacos that I did receive were greasy  and the meat was full of fat. The tacos and service grossed me out  and I will never go there again.
La Montaña Tacos,27,I got cheese enchiladas and my friend got beef enchiladas. I have never had enchiladas this way and they were cold. The refried beans were white. The server said they were Korean beans. LOL The beans tasted good and so did the chips and salsa. I will not order enchiladas here again for sure I like my enchiladas with melted cheese and hot. The beef enchiladas has some tough steak meat in them. The rice was not hot either.
La Montaña Tacos,28,Absolutely amazing  I would pay  5 per taco all day every day for these authentic  Mexican tacos   it they were only 2 each. I want to emphasize that they re made with fresh corn tortillas-- yes you read correctly  The lady is literally making them by hand right in front of you. The salsa is in a real molcajete and you can see the heavenly spinning trompo when you walk in. These  my friends  are real tacos. I had an azada taco and an al pastor taco  both enough to fill me up. For my spicy lovers  ask for a Chile toreado if you re up for it.
La Montaña Tacos,29,Amazing tacos   Quality food and inexpensive.  Tip  they so deserve it.
La Montaña Tacos,30,First time there yesterday based on a recommendation. There s a walk up window so ordering was a breeze. Service was good. Ordered Asada  pastor  tripe and barbacoa tacos. They were tacos. Pretty average but decent. Salsas we re good. The pastor tacos were a big miss  however.  They were dry and lacked flavor. I d probably give it another shot.
La Montaña Tacos,31,So I went here because my fianc  brags about their tacos. We ordered had my 2 yr old son so we were right out by the front door. I then went inside and waited for our order. After waiting inside for 10-15 min the girl taking orders called out order numbers after mine. I continued waiting until I waited long enough. I asked if my order was ready and the girl said she had already called my number   Yo if you see me waiting and my food is literally on the counter  ready next to you  it would be nice for you to simply say your food is ready. Please work on customer service. I will deff not be returning... PS bistek tacos were average  nothing to brag about.
La Montaña Tacos,32,We love this place  We eat here every week and they have never disappointed us. The corn tortillas are the best in Austin  amp  honestly since discovering this place we can t eat any other tacos. Dare I say I think it s better than Rosita s al pastor.. Every item on the menu is worth trying and the homemade corn tortillas are so much better. There s usually a wait on the weekends  amp  not a lot of tables  but it s well worth it.
La Montaña Tacos,33,So  I am a Flauta lover. I try them everywhere I go. Most are just ok. Up until today  Chuys made my favorite flautas. Not anymore   Today  I ordered them at this little place and they are my new favorite   4 freshly fried flautas covered with cabagge  cotillo     cheese  pico de gallo and several slices of fresh avocado  I requested no crema . Rice n beans on the side of course   Wish I had taken a picture  but I dove in too fast. If you love flautas like I do  you gotta give this place a try  
La Montaña Tacos,34,You want Authentic  This is the right taco stop to go  Awesome service  tacos were delicious and HANDMADE Tortillas  Definitely coming back.
La Montaña Tacos,35,Thank goodness my coworker told me about this place because I was dreading not having access to great tacos moving to Austin from the Rio Grande Valley. This place is totally legit  I had a fajita taco and a tripa taco. The fajita was tender and tasty and cut into bite sized strips. The tripa  I asked for crispy  had a perfect crunch and were seasoned deliciously. Their salsa was bomb and they sell legit Mexican cokes. I ll have to try their menudo soon.   They lose 1 star simply because of the lack of space to sit and enjoy your meal. This is more of a pick up joint or eat in your car because there are maybe about 4 tables in there and some seating along the walls but they were completely full at about 3 30.   Still  the place is awesome and I foresee many lunches there in my future 
La Montaña Tacos,36,Not being from Texas it s hard finding a good place for original street tacos that doesn t have a texmex twist. This place makes fresh corn tortillas for its tacos which I can appreciate. I had the adobado tacos which were amazing.  Not too greasy and carne asada was good too. Place is a bit small and crowded but a great place for street tacos non the less.
La Montaña Tacos,37,OMG  this was good  I had two chorizo and egg in flour with a good dose of spicy sauce from the counter. Eyes watering and lips burning just the right amount. This place is small but totally authentic and awesome tacos.
La Montaña Tacos,38,If you want to watch your tortilla get made  go here    Their corn tortillas are very bendy  not dry. Super perfect   The very best on the quadrant of Braker Lane and I-35    Tacos on N. Lamar are good  but if you miss out on this tiny dive on Braker Lane you ve missed out. Everyone that works here is super friendly. I go normally go for breakfast tacos on weekdays and it is so so busy  On weekends they have a gigantic pot of menudo and this place is crazy busy. Don t miss this one. Solid great authentic Mexican.
La Montaña Tacos,39,Great Mexican tacos  authentic taste. Don t eat so often of these out there. Owner and staff after Friendly
La Montaña Tacos,40,These tacos were amazing. Makes me wish I lived in Austin so I could buy them everyday. Would highly recommend 
La Montaña Tacos,41,Very best place in town for authentic tacos.  The corn tortillas are amazing. . I always get the chorizo  egg and cheese.  The Barbaco is so good here  or even the caldo de Rez.
La Montaña Tacos,42,Not Tex-Mex. This will be your new secret spot for Mexican food. They have great tacos  and handmade tortillas  that taste like you re in the D. F.  but they have even more amazing rotating daily specials served on authentic mexican pottery... like mole verde  Who s ever eaten mole verde  I bet very few people you know have eaten it. Menudo is on the menu everyday. They also serve a great spicy chilaquiles and have fresh roasted salsa in a giant molcajete for you to serve yourself. The shopping center it is in is really run down and the parking situation is scary but the restaurant is very clean and cheerful. Brush up on your Spanish beforehand. Seriously.
La Montaña Tacos,43,The food was hot  amp  fresh when it came out. Our server was very polite. She kept checking on us and we didnt have to ask for refills. We would definitely come back again.
La Montaña Tacos,44,Love this place best home made tortillas in Austin the food it s amazin love ording from them
La Montaña Tacos,45,I decided to try this place because they have good reviews. I m not sure why because my experience was not good at all. I asked for something that was on the menu only to be told with in a negative way that they didn t have that item. I ordered tacos and when I got them they were as dry as cardboard the limes I got with them were also very dry and I was barely able to squeeze any onto my taco.
La Montaña Tacos,46,Best street tacos I ve ever had in my life. I ve had thousands of tacos in my life growing up in SoCal and they come nowhere close to this. Get the steak one.
La Montaña Tacos,47,I love the food here. It s such authentic Mexican food  You cant go wrong with la Monta a.
La Montaña Tacos,48,This place is amazing their tacos are the best tacos in Texas and in the Austin area I truly recommend this place to any visitors that are in Austin their tacos aren t too greasy or too dry their just right their meat is always good and they always have fresh handmade tortillas all types of tacos are good it will not disappoint the only thing is that the place is small if it s a busy day it will be crowded and it s better not to eat there and just take them to go that s the only thing stopping the 5 stars but the tacos amazing you will not regret it
La Montaña Tacos,49,Food was awesome. Staff was very friendly. Tiny little hole in the wall and limited seating but well worth it. Highly recommend
Freebirds World Burrito,1,Went to this location during lunch. My experience was good. Service was good. Greeted right away. Food was delicious. Prices were reasonable. Overall  not a bad place to go for a bite to eat.
Freebirds World Burrito,2,I know inflation is driving cost up  and I expect that.   But for costs to go up and then get a serving this size is frustrating.  I got hit with inflation and shrinkflation at the same time.   I told the server when she started the order that I was only going to get rice  chicken  and sour cream  but this is still the portion she gave me.   Won t be back because I was still hungry after I got done eating this 1 3 of a bowl.
Freebirds World Burrito,3,I had a really good experience here  in large part because the service was so friendly. I was having an off day  and they were so nice and made me feel better. The food  as always  was really good. It is a bit on the pricey side  though. I paid almost  11 for a burrito and drink - with a 30  off coupon  Oof.
Freebirds World Burrito,4,South Lamar  location  Use to be a fav go to when we were in a hurry. Last night we went service has slumped. The food serving trays were down to the bottom -almost empty and employees were just standing around. The young woman who served us acted like we were imposing on her when we asked to add  chips to our order   The tables were not clean. Idk what s going on here but it s not work  cleaning or good customer service.
Freebirds World Burrito,5,I go to this store doordash about once every two weeks and every time I go in the employees are always so kind and seem like they enjoy working there    today I ordered on the app and apparently the doordasher who picked it up ate my burrito lmao  but customer service was very helpful and gave me some rewards for the inconvenience even though they were at the airport. My burritos are also very good most of the time  only comment I have is that sometimes when the steak is towards the bottom of the batch it has a bit of a rougher texture and taste but nothing terrible at all. Overall a good store with very good people 
Freebirds World Burrito,6,This freebirds is alright  but much worse than the other freebirds in Austin. Cold meat  slow service  average food.
Freebirds World Burrito,7,I don t get it. I tried to give them another chance and but yet again they fail. I don t understand inconsistent way they are doing things here but I guess I tried to give the a chance.
Freebirds World Burrito,8,Free birds food is always good  No complaints there- but this is more of a customer service  hygiene complaint   Whether you have short hair  long hair  red hair  or blue hair is totally up to you. BUT For those of us with long hair  I think the point of wearing a ponytail when you work in the food industry is so that your hair doesn t hang down over the food. So  when your hair is in a  side pony  inches away dangling above my food you are preparing... cmon now.   I m paying  15.00 for a meal and still tip  so it would just be courteous to not have to worry about hair being in my food. That s all   Hopefully this is an easy to resolve issue with this location.
Freebirds World Burrito,9, I will never come back here  is what I ve said each of the three times I ve been desperate for a quick meal and visited this location. Each occurrence was months apart  and each were consistent in that it was a dumpster fire of poor service and incorrect orders. The food isn t near good enough to bother.
Freebirds World Burrito,10,It had been a while since I ate  here  so we decided to go have some burritos. The burrito was over filled with rice and not not enough protein. The service was good.
Freebirds World Burrito,11,Some of the best  made-to-order  burritos in Austin.  It s kinda sad it lost its  specialiness  since being took over by a corporation.  Half the fun was going to see who was working behind the counter.  Anyway  the burritos are awesome and the staff is super-friendly.  I love that they have a habanero sauce to add to your order.  The serving sizes are always ginormous and very filling.  They have added a bunch of new items  including a  meat-free  chirizo option.  No other burrito place compares to the variety and taste I get from Freebirds.
Freebirds World Burrito,12,Supposedly this is a super monster burrito. Just another good restaurant ruined by greedy corporations. You cant charge 30  for a super monster brisket burrito and then make it the size of a can of Coke. I guess I will just stick to chipotle from now on.
Freebirds World Burrito,13,Thought I d try Freebirds since I was already in the area  and I was pretty disappointed. First of all  their servers were rude and not helpful. He answered my questions in a condescending tone and did not look like he wanted to be there. He then proceeded drop the fillings of the burrito on their tray  which I don t even know if it s clean   pushed it back onto the tortilla and wrapped it. They also charge an extra  1.50 for a couple pieces of potatoes which didn t even look fresh. On top of that  the cashier treated the customers like children.   Probably better to go to other burrito bowl places in the area since Austin has a lot of good ones.
Freebirds World Burrito,14,I used to frequent this location back in the early to mid 2000 s all the time. I would eat there almost on a weekly basis back then until I moved away. Now I m back all these years later and thought I would give this location a long awaited visit. I did visit after the lunch rush was over and the ingredients did look like they needed some  freshening up . However the preparation didn t look too much out of the ordinary and the burrito was put together well enough. However  after digging into it I was noticing how flavorless it was and the fact that it was basically room temp. The rice was a starchy flavorless blob  the meat was hardly noticeable and neither the salsa or death sauce were very apparent either. It was definitely not at all as good as I remembered. For  10 you can find a lot better burritos at numerous Food trucks and taco stands around Austin.  I ll give them another try during the lunch rush since I m so nearby  but this visit was a 2 1 2 star experience.
Freebirds World Burrito,15,Chipotle could never. I got a cayenne tortilla freebird with Spanish rice  refried beans  beef  guac  crunchy tortilla strips and lots of spicy tomatillo sauce. So good 
Freebirds World Burrito,16,These people are all either really high or just that dumb. I mean  it s a burrito place. I m not expecting the world. I do expect when I order a  family taco dinner  that I m going to get tortillas. Rather than have to drive all the way back to be greeted with indifference  mumbled half-hearted apologies and then a  sorry hon have a nice day on the way out from the manager. It s not just this either. It s every time I go here there is SOMETHING they screw up. I try to support local business but this place makes it hard.
Freebirds World Burrito,17,Very horrible customer service. At one point there was a young lady talking to me with her back facing me.
Freebirds World Burrito,18,Torn. I love freebirds burritos but this specific location have seen little concern of pandemic protocol. On two occasions  first an employee serving food without properly wearing a mask  second visit watching patrons breathing over the food.  Pedantic  Possibly. Considering others  Absolutely not.
Freebirds World Burrito,19,Now they ve discontinued the whole wheat tortillas   Everything I used to like about this place  they kill or get rid of  one at a time.
Freebirds World Burrito,20,I want to alert the location manager about the horrible service I received at your restaurant this afternoon. I submitted an order for 1 00pm on 3 22 2022 and arrived at the location at 1 01. I walked up the pickup area and my order was not ready to stood in at the register and waited and no one greeted me or even made eye contact for about 5 minutes. All the counter people were working and soon a man behind the counter asked if I needed help when he approached with another order. I told him my name and it was for an online order. There was a lady behind him making 1 order  two others were completed and one of the completed orders was my order. I this because the male worker asked me my last name and confirmed on the order. The lady making the orders told the guy  she would handle my order and get back to the other customers in line. So now my order is ready  but the lady handling the on-line orders completed another order first  while I am waiting. She also thought it was OK to clean up her station  and fix a broken stapler while I waited for my order that in now 15 minutes late. She finally finished cleaning  stapling and bagging the online orders  walks over to the  to go order  shelf and tosses the orders on the shelve with any words to me  like sorry for the delay  sorry you had to wait  or even an enjoy your meal and have a nice day. Her attitude and care and handling of food that I paid for and had to wait extra time for is not normal for what a expect at a Freebirds  which I used to love going to.  Positive   Her attitude is bad but she makes a great burrito 
Freebirds World Burrito,21,Some people love this place but I just don t get it. This was my first time here and everything on the line is so processed it tastes funny. The chicken is pressed and formed breasts which is the lowest quality you can get and the texture is not good. I don t think they make anything in house I think they just heat and warm things up. The cheese comes out of a bag it s just not that good. At least this company should use whole muscle meats instead of the inside of a chicken nugget. Not this franchisees fault but not for me.
Freebirds World Burrito,22,Best burrito place in town  always come back for more. Just wish that the portions were a bit bigger.
Freebirds World Burrito,23,Freebirds..... what happened   I started eating your burritos back in 2002 and continued to eat them for years  unfortunately this very location pushed me away to Cabo Bob s a few years back.  Headed to shop at HEB Hancock and figured I d get a burrito before shopping so that I could give this location a 2nd chance.... In the past it had BAD food.  NO CHANGE .... I literally watched my burrito being made and ate dine in and every single ingredient in my burrito was cold.... I mean the cheese was icebox cold and all the other ingredients were room temp at best- not even hot enough to melt the cheese.    discontinued spinach  amp  whole wheat tortillas is a disappointment   Seriously though as someone with a marketing degree I have to ask....  Why is your price point higher with lower quality 
Freebirds World Burrito,24,Was having a strong burrito craving and decided to finally give Freebirds a try. I am pretty disappointed. I got beans  mexican rice  guac  sour cream  jalapeno sauce  corn  and veggies. The burrito had barely any flavor at all and the ratio of fillings was way off. I should ve trusted my gut and ordered from a less franchise-y spot. I have learned my lesson I guess.
Freebirds World Burrito,25,I came almost 2 weeks ago it was suggested by a few people it wasn t something I d get on a regular basis it was okay but I got food poisoning that was the first thing I had to eat that day so I knew for a fact it was the food making me sick
Freebirds World Burrito,26,Hi Freebirds   I ordered online at 7 30 PM. The email confirmation I got stated the order would be ready by 7 42 PM. When I arrived st 7 43 PM there was 1 person in the order line and another person waiting for a pickup. I watched 2 to go orders and 5 other in line orders be prepared while I was still waiting. It was now 8 01 PM. I was told my order would be next to be worked on before the 5 people came into the store. I don t mind waiting a couple minutes past my confirmation email ready time but waiting 30 minutes for my order to be started  and almost 40 before I got my order  while a to go order and 8 other in line orders were completed was very frustrating. On top of that  I wasn t offered anything for the extra long wait  however an extra brownie was thrown in after my order was ready to go. With 5 people working and it not being too busy I m surprised I had to wait so long. This isn t the first time this has happened but it is the first review I ve left. We probably won t be back anytime soon or we ll go to the burrito place closer to home.   I attempted to post this to your online contact page several times. Each time I submitted the info I got an error.  Respectfully   Don Nolting
Freebirds World Burrito,27,They served me raw chicken    That s very dangerous and outrageous   I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and after eating a few bites  I noticed the chicken was raw  I looked through the rest of my bowl and I noticed more and more pieces of raw chicken  I m extremely outraged and worried for my health 
Freebirds World Burrito,28,They didn t start cooking my to-go order until I arrived at the supposed pick-up time. Somehow it was still ice cold  steak quesadilla  also forgot my sour cream and sauces. Chips are way too salty. I will never return.
Freebirds World Burrito,29,I visited this Freebird for the first time  and had the beef burrito bowl.  It tasted very fresh.  They let me try their sauces  but I opted for the sour cream.  Their guacamole is on the spicy side.  Their restroom is clean and they have a really neat towel dispenser that has an electronic poll to vote the cleanliness of the restroom.  The dining room is large and has plenty of seating with the view of the Statue of Liberty on a motorcycle and aluminum foil art strategically placed.  They have music playing and a community board.  If you re not a member you can simply sign up with your telephone number and get your points   Very nice staff.  I would visit again.
Freebirds World Burrito,30,Freebirds is a fast food chain that gets 5 stars for their consistency  endless vegan options  and great service at this location    I ve been to this location multiple times and they ve always given me great proportions  tortillas on the side of my bowl  sauces free of attitude and charge.   Their sauces are so vegan friendly  The staff is knowledgeable on what is vegan and what isn t  which was great.   My favorite is the vegetarian and tempeh bowl. The vegetarian bowl has guacamole included and the tempeh bowl has tempeh included and guac is extra. Get a side of chips or tortilla to compliment your Freebird bowl  Freebirds is delicious  healthy  and conveniently located next to HEB so you can walk your food baby off.
Freebirds World Burrito,31,Fu  friendly staff serving good burritos  bowls  quesadillas  and smiles. Similar to Qdoba and Chipotle
Freebirds World Burrito,32,I got the freebird burrito with chicken and it was tasty  but nothing extremely special about it. It was very similar to chipotle  qdoba  Tex-mex chains  but the burritos are quite large and they fill you up for around  8 so I enjoyed eating there. I was a big fan of their BBQ sauce which wasn t traditional but it was kinda like a salsa  BBQ sauce fusion that was really flavorful and went well with the burrito. I think I ll come next time to try their burrito bowl.
Freebirds World Burrito,33,Better version of chipotle. Delicious. Only negative i have is their chips are thin  but yummy  and break easy if you dip into bowl
Freebirds World Burrito,34,Freebirds is College Station s gift to Austin Good Eating.   Double Dave s Pizza is College Station s gift to Austin Mediocre Eating.   Yes  Freebird s was in Aggieland first where it located in their version of the Drag and became a big hit.  Freebird s in College Station have newspapers hanging from alligator clips on the wall that you can read.  Otherwise it is the same in Austin and College Station.  Freebird s is not destination eating  but it is decent enough and healthy to boot.  Burritos  either reasonably sized or huge  crammed with the meat of your choice  the veggies of your choice  beans of your choice  and your choice of sauces.  There are lots of ways to make your burrito explosively hot.  I tend to add every form of fire they ve got.  Eight hours later I discover sections of my small and large intestines I never knew existed.  You would think I would get smarter as I get older and   Learn to lay off the jalapenos and hot sauces   But I don t.  Eating a Freebirds burrito is not a peak experience at the level of a first kiss    Or even at the level of a 638th kiss.  But it is not unpleasant.  Anti-burrito people - they also use their ingredients to make nachos and salads -  and while that is not the quintessential Freebird s experience -  The salads and nachos are ok too.  Reliable decent food with Godzilla decorations and a little bit of  Keep College Station Weird.
Freebirds World Burrito,35,Freebirds is far from what it used to be but I m okay with where it is now. I know Chipotle has been the biggest challenge for this franchise but I grew up with Freebirds in College Station and it has always been a staple.   I m almost more inclined to order on my phone at this location. The woman I see making ticket orders is far faster than those who make burritos for the line. Always  However  I m happy to say that Freebirds tastes almost as nostalgic as I remember  except without all of the shiny tin-foil animals objects strung onto the walls .
Freebirds World Burrito,36,First time at this store. Really crappy food. Was cold and obviously not fresh. Some staff members appeared to be drunk or stoned or both. The chain used to be a good place to eat but has really gone downhill the last year. It will be Chipotle from now on.
Freebirds World Burrito,37,The food is great  it is Freebirds  which is in my opinion a more savory version of Chipotle   but this particular location s service is terrific. I go there all the time before or after my workout around 5-7pm by the 24 hour fitness that s nearby and the staff is always very smiley and conversational. Thanks a ton for your attitude and the awesome food as usual   
Freebirds World Burrito,38,I like freebirds burritos and the nachos are good too. they have plenty of options and they all  look fresh. the price though can be a little stifling at times but the amount of food you get is good. the facilities are small but clean.  they are reallllllyyyyy busy at lunch so be prepared to wait. the hosts are nice and polite. again  this can be compared to most taco burrito spots but the options make them a little different.
Freebirds World Burrito,39,Never a long wait here and they are always generous with the guac. I love loading up either a steak bowl  burrito with spinach tortilla  or nachos. None have been disappointing. Their queso makes everything better. I could eat freebirds multiple times a week. Cool peeps working there as well
Freebirds World Burrito,40,I didn t care for this place at all. This is a bad version of Chipotle. I guess the chips were good but the rest was not great. I wouldn t go back. However the staff and location was nice.
Freebirds World Burrito,41,The freebirds locations are rocking this quarantine. I like that I can still go in and get exactly what I want. Ordering from the app is easy too.
Freebirds World Burrito,42,A couple months ago I would have never gave free birds a chance cause I was a fool to not realize how great this place is. With me being a college student money is something I don t always have in large quantities but  10 gets me the best nachos around       That steak and their Queso  you cant find a better match made in heaven. Rather I m on lunch break working a split or getting out of class on my way to work this location specifically is always on point with their service and food.
Freebirds World Burrito,43,While I tend to enjoy smaller more independently owned properties  I must say Freebirds World Burrito was a good experience    We arrived during the late lunch rush and the staff was restocking almost everything so the Steak and Chicken were coming off the grill as I placed my order.  You can make it into a burrito or a non-burrito bowl...I like the bowl it makes me think I am eating more.     I will say the selection of rice and beans and other staples were impressive  and the amount they put in your bowl is larger than other companies with similar styles of serving.  The line staff worked quickly and as a team to make sure everyone was taken care of.  I enjoyed my Freebird experience....now we just need a Freebird close to my office in Fort Worth   Happy Eating Y all 
Freebirds World Burrito,44,Literally the worst dining experience of my life. I waited in line for 20 mins when there were only 4 people in front of me. At Chipotle or Qdoba  I would ve been out in half of that time. They tried making my bowl at the same time as someone else s to speed up the line... They ended up just messing up my food but I wanted to leave so badly that I didn t say anything.
Freebirds World Burrito,45,Inferior burrito with no taste. I decided to go here because I ve never tried it before and wanted to see if it is actually better than chipotle and turns out it is not  The meat is so so so so dry  I would ve chocked on it if I didn t have water near by. The rice was beyond mushy  I thought it was rice paste. Not enough anything could make that burrito taste good.
Freebirds World Burrito,46,Friendliest staff ever. Food is great and I always leave in a good mood because of the nice people behind the counter.
Freebirds World Burrito,47,All I gotta say is the tall  6-foot plus  skinny tattooed guy frickin  rocks   I stopped in here w  a friend for some din-din  this guy helped build our 3-taco and beef nacho dinner and did a superb job     He added all of our requests in plentiful fashion  didn t skimp on anything  and made it our way right away.  No  it s not BK  but you can call him the Tattooed Taco Tex-Mex Artist  or The Macho Nacho Maker.  He was funny and accomodating  we definitely had to tip well due to the excellent customer service.    I absolutely love their BBQ salsa  I can drink it w  a straw.  Holy cow that Super Monster Burrito   12.69  is larger than a Great Dane and will last you for days.      Freebirds rocks 
Freebirds World Burrito,48,OK  so we went to Freebirds last night because we had a two-for-one coupon. But we have to admit that this was also our second time there. It will also definitely be our last.   The place is freaking filthy  everywhere. The tables aren t clean  the food area looks like a tornado ran through it  and there just seems to be an all around grimy vibe. The guacamole tastes rotten. The portions for the price are good  as are the number of choices  but nothing tastes fresh. The servers were completely disorganized.   We ve actually both been to a Freebirds in College Station and had a great experience there. One of us also used to like the one up in Plano. This location  though  has gone to the dogs. You re probably better off at Chipotle.
Freebirds World Burrito,49,Been coming here for lunch for the past year after moving from California and it s as good every time. The staff keeps cleanliness of the place. Ever want an upgraded burrito from chipotle I would recommend free birds every time.
Freebirds World Burrito,50,This place serves burnt meat.  If I m paying  12 I expect food that is edible and tastes better than something I could quickly make at home.  It is also guilty of sometimes serving salty food.  I don t know if they just like to unload the bad food on delivery orders  I used a delivery service  or if they just think it s okay to serve visibly burnt meat. This is not the only time this has happened.  Go anywhere else  there s a Mediterranean place next door and Pokejos nearby.  Cabo Bobs is a better establishment that serves consistent quality food  I just had to use Freebirds because they were the only one of the two offered by delivery services.
Freebirds World Burrito,51,I love Freebirds.  Seriously.  I ve been eating their burritos since they only had one restaurant in College Station and the line would wrap around the building.  My Aggie friends would call other friends after they opened two and see which one had the longer line sometimes.  Their burritos are very filling and they don t get chintzy on the ingredients.  Every once in a while the steak has some gristle fat in it but usually it is lean and quite tasty.  I do wish they would spread the ingredients around some before wrapping it.  But you get a lot for your money and the ingredients are fresh and tasty.
Freebirds World Burrito,52,When writing sub-three-star reviews  I try to differentiate between  bad experience  and  bad place.  That s why we have star averages  if I go to well-reviewed place but have a poor experience  I may well still give it a second chance.  However  I suspect my experience with Freebirds was pretty representative  and the food there just isn t for me. In fact  I would go a step further and suggest that it would require copious amounts of alcohol or marijuana for this food to be for me.  The gimmick at Freebirds is giant burritos  ranging from huge to utterly ridiculous in size. But big and good are not the same thing. Neither the spinach tortilla  almost certainly from a bag   the ungodly bland beans  the uninteresting Spanish rice  nor the dry chicken contributed to anything more than a giant  not-very-hot mass of flavorless carbohydrates. It is true that there are many hot sauces and a pretty decent salsa bar there to try to remedy the original blandness of the food  but that can t really rescue a meal that s at root not very good. And besides  if I wanted to cook for myself  I d have stayed home.  The staff were perfectly nice and the restaurant was reasonably clean-ish  given a good amount of traffic on a Friday night. Also  I certainly can t complain about the very reasonable prices. It isn t as if there was anything offensively wrong with my experience  but given the nigh-infinite variety of burrito and Tex-Mex options in Austin  I really can t see why I would do this one a second time. It might work as a post-bar late night booze soaker  but isn t open late enough to operate in that niche.
Freebirds World Burrito,53,You need to look at Freebirds as an investment.   This isn t lunch you re after.   It s lunch  dinner and lunch the next day.   It s a burrito the size of J.J. Watt s arm. The arm with the big black brace on it.  It s 10-12 dollars for a Monster burrito so outrageously filled that the poor line worker has to sigh and order up that second tortilla for you in an attempt to tame this monstrosity before you.  There are no truly bad choices. No truly great ones either. I love spice  but to me something about the flavor of their death sauce is just a bit  off.    The advice I can offer   -Rice in general isn t really necessary. The tortilla at Freebirds strikes me as particularly dense every time  and I ve never seen the rice add anything to it besides volume.  -They have refried beans. Chipotle does not. Will it make your burrito s innards look hideous  Absolutely. But this is Freebirds  not a beauty pageant  and you re here for the tastiest cylindrical cinderblock of calories possible. Add this.  -The creamy jalapeno is good  and I don t really go for creamy sauces that often.  -Experiment with their meats. I ve only had the carnitas  and it s nothing amazing.  -Abuse their salsa bar  which closes early as the night winds down.  -If you have limited lactose capacity  like me   sub the cheese for sliced avocado  for free .  -Don t you dare get a hybird. I ll excuse a well-filled Freebird  but ordering a burrito anywhere south of large here is simply a failure on your part to understand the concept.   You could hit up HEB after you ve done your work here  but honestly you tend to leave this place feeling like you ve just scored a whole supermarket in tinfoil.
Freebirds World Burrito,54,some of the best nachos i have had are from there they don t add a lot of cheese but if you ask for extra it s perfect it s like a better version of chiptole
Freebirds World Burrito,55,Freebirds is my go-to usually once or twice a week  super solid. I always go with a bowl  half spicy chicken half pork w  peppers and onions. They have awesome queso too. Always a huge portion and very filling  Staff is always very nice too.
Freebirds World Burrito,56,The service today was horrible  I was the only person standing in line and they left me standing for about 10 minutes whilst the staff were chatting and focusing on the to-go orders. Whenever someone finally came over to help me they informed me that the onions and peppers have run out and it will take another 20 minutes for them to be ready. I was extremely disappointed as onions and peppers are a focal point of any burrito or Mexican cuisine. I instantly regretted getting the food because the taste was super bland. I have had free birds before lots of times before and this was my worst experience. The staff did not seem concerned me waiting around for no reason. They seemed to be more concerned about the conversations they were having with the other staff.
Freebirds World Burrito,57,I really like Freebirds  especially that they offer vegan options.  Locally-produced tempeh is a great offering   I m a frequent diner here at the Hancock Center store and occasionally at other stores.  Most of the staff are courteous and take pride in making the customer happy.  I have some complaints  though  which is why I won t give 5 stars in this review    1  the sauteed veggies are usually overcooked and oily  they should be crunchy and not dripping with oil... see  for example  the veggies at any Chipotle.   yes  I know... I hate the big corporate chains  too  but they get this part right and Freebirds needs to follow that lead.   2  the tempeh often runs out in the evening  on numerous occasions I ve come in after work only to find out that the tempeh sold out and they aren t going to make any more until the next day.  This is NOT a way to endear your vegan customers to you   I have to go out of my way to come to this place so if I do and I can t get what I came for  this makes me less likely to come back.  I notice that you don t seem to run out of meat   Feels like you value your meat-eating customers more than those who eat low on the food chain.  NOT GOOD.  3  too many of your staff don t know that you allow a substitution of avocado slices for dairy at no additional charge.  I had been paying extra for a long time before I was told by a senior staff person that I should not have been charged for avocado slices on my vegan tempeh bowl.  Now whenever I get waited on by someone I don t know I usually have to challenge them when they try to charge me for the avocado.  It is getting tiresome.  When are you gonna TRAIN YOUR STAFF   This is another form of discrimination against vegans   We shouldn t have to argue with your staff to not be over-charged on every other visit   If you guys can get your act together and make a real effort from the corporate management folks down to the line staff to treat vegans at least as well as you do the customers who are eating dead animals  you will earn a 5-star review from me.  Until then  I ll still patronize your stores  but I don t expect I ll always be a happy customer when I go there.
Freebirds World Burrito,58,Burritos  tacos  quesadillas  chips and salsa or queso. It s all good here. Its even better when you get the combinations of meats  rice and veggies just right. You definitely have to experiment or play with your food. One ingredient too many can ruin the flavor combo s.  I eat here so often that I have the frequent eaters card and they e-mail me special price offers occasionally. Great food  great service and great people to be around.
Freebirds World Burrito,59,They don t know how to make quesadillas. Don t order a quesadilla from here unless you want a tortilla with a very small and laughable amount of cheese   cold veggies that were added after the quesadilla was cooked.
Freebirds World Burrito,60,Sweet kid working  but my only gripe is that nothing on the line was explained to me. I can obviously pick out rice and meat on my own  but I had to guess on all of the salsas with no explanations - my burrito turned out pretty bland because of that  which is a bummer at  8.50. I also saw online they offer avocado slices for your burritos  but I didn t see that as an option in store  and I m a huge avocado lover who was looking forward to that    Nothing inherently wrong with the place  but maybe a little more description explanation would serve customers well   
Freebirds World Burrito,61,I m a supporter of freebirds  but this location was pretty dissapointing. The freebird sized burrito seemed smaller than usual. The meat portioning was terrible. I received half a scoop of beef  leaving the burrito 95  filler  5  meat. I felt like i was eating a rice burrito with some salsa. The lady behind the counter had a poor attitude the whole time I was picking out ingredients for the burrito. Sorry you hate your job  At least the cashier was nice.  If you re like me and like freebirds  go to another location.
Freebirds World Burrito,62,I ve switched to the bowl and it s so much easier and less messy to eat. I tried the same at Chipotle and this place is WAY better. Employees are great too 
Freebirds World Burrito,63,This used to be my favorite location. I would always go shopping at the HEB and grab a burrito for dinner on a lazy Sunday or long workday. However  the last time I ate here  I found hair in my food. I was so saddened by this. It s a let down when something like that happens to really delicious food. That might have just been a one time  random thing  but it was enough to stop me from ever going again.
Freebirds World Burrito,64,I like free birds awesome place like the atmosphere..  The reason I give only 4 stars is because I went there a while back  amp  ordered nachos  amp  I wanted a little bit of  all the meats the had on my nachos    amp  the lady serving me was actually a little rude telling me that  that would be tedious.   But if I request something extra I don t expect it for free.  I don t have a problem with paying for ANYTHING I WANT. I m paying for it what s the problem with you serving it to me 
Freebirds World Burrito,65,Usually pretty good food and service  but after today probably won t go back to this location. Went in at about 6 30 pm. Waited for a few minutes before I was greeted  only person in line and the person in front of me was almost done paying. Even then I didn t show any attitude.   When asked what I wanted  I could tell the guy wasnt in a good mood. He even made a comment of  on your way out can you lock the door we I have a lot of crap to catch up on.  I thought he was joking at first  but quickly released he wasn t. I asked him a question about a new menu item and he grunted a  its ehh.   He grabbed a tortia and didn t really heat it for long. Threw it on the plate and kind of put the toppings on in a sloppy manner. Then passed it on to the next person and went to the back. Sorry bud  didn t mean to ruin your day by making you work at your job.   The next person wasn t all that much better she just tossed in the stuff and crappily wrapped the burrito.   The cashier was cool and friendly. Over all it cost me 12 bucks and it tasted gross. The tortilla was awkwardly chewy probably from not being warmed up properly and the meat and cheese were lacking from its usual serving size.   Not sure if I ll go back to that location  but if I do I ll be sure to say something and walk out if I must. I m not a big fan of spending hard earned money on crap service and crap food. And yes I did leave a tip.
Freebirds World Burrito,66,Love this location. Corey and the crew here are the best  Friendly  outgoing  efficient  great customer service  fresh food. Love the salad bowl as a healthy option. Kudos to this spot.
Freebirds World Burrito,67,Wow this place is amazing. Unless you are a big eater order the hybrid burrito. Everything was so fresh. The atmosphere is cool too. This was our first dining experience since landing In Austin. The bar has been set high 
Freebirds World Burrito,68,Good food  good service  clean bathrooms.   Seats can be uncomfortable. Sometimes gets crowded noisy. One time I went in there  and the mild sauce had obviously gone bad.
Freebirds World Burrito,69,Obviously I have been missing out on this yummy food  I m beyond satisfied with the service  efficiency and quality 
Freebirds World Burrito,70,This tends to be the best Freebird s location in Austin.  Some of the other locations tend to be hit or miss.  However  I have had one less than excellent burrito here  the salsa was full of HUGE onion chunks that day  which holds me back from giving them the fifth star of excellence.  Generally speaking  the ingredients are fresh and  for fast food  relatively healthy. I highly recommend the cayenne tortilla to kick up the heat one more notch.  Overall  the service is above average and keeps the line moving quickly. An excellent lunch option  especially if you come before or after the noon lunch rush.
Freebirds World Burrito,71,Do not come here if you are vegan vegetarian.   When I came this evening  they were out of both veggies and tempeh. They said they do not make much tempeh and that sometimes they just run out. When I asked if they could at least make some more veggies  they refused. Meanwhile  there were multiple employees standing behind the counter doing nothing.   Since there was nothing to add to my meal  I left.   After reading other reviews  it seems like they run out of their vegan options frequently and do not value their vegan vegetarians customers enough to keep things stocked. All of the meat and cheese options were fully stocked.   Goodbye Freedbirds.
Freebirds World Burrito,72,I came in today for lunch and was charged incorrectly for my order.  I ordered the hybrid chicken  which according to the menu board should have been  6.00  however when I went to pay  my order was  7.14. I noticed this at the register and when I asked why my ticket was so expensive  the girl was completely clueless and just said it was the tax... really...   1.14 of tax on a  6 burrito  Last time I checked  the tax rate in Austin was not 16 .  I once again asked why  and was promptly ignored.  The girl at the register had already moved on to take the money from the next person in line  and had no regard for me.  After asking for the third time  still to receive NO ANSWER  I left.  Such horrible customer service... stealing my money and then refusing to even acknowledge that I am speaking to you   If this is how you choose to do business  I will not be back.  To others  be aware and check what you are paying for...
Freebirds World Burrito,73,We have always loved Freebirds   The value is wonderful and their food is sooo good.  They give generous amounts of food so that two people could easily split one meal or one person could take the rest home for leftovers.  They have great vegetarian options if you are cutting back on meat and their grilled veggies are so tasty.  The people that work here are friendly and welcoming.
Freebirds World Burrito,74,This location happened to be conveinent since my friend  amp  I needed to make a grocery run  so we stopped in this weekend for a late lunch.  I usually go for burritos at Freebirds  but I was feeling a little dangerous  amp  decided to try their taco combo instead.  I live life on the edge  truly.   With the taco combo  you get your choice of flour tortillas  soft corn tortillas  or crunch corn tortillas.  The choice was taunting me  so I finally asked for a recommendation  amp  got the soft corn tortillas.  Excellent choice as they were a tasty compliment to my meal.  To complete the tacos  I had them add chicken  rice  pico  corn salsa  hot sauce  onions  and black beans.  Of course  I had to add on some BBQ sauce as I ate  too.  Yea  my breath was pretty sexy after all of that   All of the ingrediants were fresh and yummy... I went to town on their iced tea  too  nom   The two of us got out of there for less than  14  including drinks  amp  whatnot.  That is a definite win   The staff here was friendly and gave great suggestions.  They were pretty generous with the amount of stuff they piled on my tacos  see photo .  Really  I ended up needing a fork because I had been so overzealous with all the toppings   Also  all of the common areas were clean  amp  well stocked  which is always a plus.  There is also outdoor seating here  but it was just a wee bit too chilly for me to brave that this time around.  Perhaps I ll venture back when the weather warms up   
Freebirds World Burrito,75,Food that doesn t suck and it s reasonably priced. It s walking distance from my daughters place. I fed three student girls for  24 the other night. Me and the Debster split a burrito bowl for lunch earlier in the day for  maybe   7  and it was tasty. The sincerity runs a little thin. It s like Chipotle with SuicideGirls and skinny grunge men at the counter and semi-cool music. But lemme get past the gripes  I d WAY rather eat here or Chipotle then  say  any of the big QSRs like McD s etc.  UPDATE  A star is born  The taco meal earns it   5 for two tacos built-to-order with chips and a drink. We re talking value and the food was definitely treat-tasty and crush-worthy.   TIP  Walking distance from two auto repair shops.
Freebirds World Burrito,76,Freebirds is an amazing and unique burrito experience  many people draw comparisons to Chipotle  which is also great   but there s something about colorful tortillas  Spanish rice  and some death sauce that makes it special.  A monster steak will never leave you unfulfilled.
Freebirds World Burrito,77,I finally had a chance to try out Freebirds after hearing about it for years. I m a regular Chipotle customer so I ll be making comparisons to Chipotle for this review.  First step into the store  the place looks  cooler  than Chipotle with colorful decorations and popular music. The menu caught my attention immediately. Since I ve been wanting to try a bigger burrito than the Chipotle option  I opted for  a Carnitas Monster burrito. I really like the many options available for each step along the way  from the tortilla to the rice to the beans to the veggies to the sauce. Its method of wrapping the burrito actually works at not making a mess out of  eating.  I totally enjoyed the amount I got from the Monster burrito. It s more than just a normal burrito. As for the taste  I actually still prefer Chipotle. I don t know whether it s just because of the meat but the Freebird s burrito didn t have as much flavor as the Chipotle burrito s I m used to having. But with that said  I still enjoyed my meal. At this point  I still prefer Chipotle more than Freebirds but I would gladly come back to Freebirds again.
Freebirds World Burrito,78,The food is not bad - the turn over is fast so the grilled meats  lettuce and tomatoes  tend to be fresh.  The problem is that the food is bland.  While Chipotle over uses acid  lime flavoring  and devil weed  cilantro   Freebird s food lacks seasoning  i.e.  salt  garlic  onion and chili powder.  Because of this  the burrito bowl with black beans and grilled chicken fails to reach its potential as reasonably priced  flavorful  low fat and filling fast food.
Freebirds World Burrito,79,I love this place. The people who work here are great. The restaurant works very well. But I m probably not coming back anymore. It sucks because it was one of my regulars.  My favorite thing is the taco meal. At first you got three  then they reduced it to two and now it s gone. As well as a lot of their tasty sauces. It s just not the same place. I loved their tacos  they were great. The girl at the front said if I order the same things separately it will cost twice the price.   It is not a bad spot but now they have taken a unique place with great food and made it a generic crappy version of Chipotle.
Freebirds World Burrito,80,i have been a die hard chipotle fan for years  never tried freebirds and didn t want to  well i finally tried this location today and i can confidently say i will not be going back to chipotle  their meat is so much better and they have pretty much everything chipotle has and more  the service was a tiny bit slow with no line but it was worth it   the rice and lettuce and beans are all better than chipotle and very tasty  while chipotle is quite bland lately.
Freebirds World Burrito,81,The staff is quick to serve you and the place is clean. I ve never been upset with the quality of the food and I don t agree with any of the 2 star reviews. I ve been in Austin for nearly a decade and this Freebirds location is the one closest toy house  and there s never been a time I was dissatisfied with the food or setting.
Freebirds World Burrito,82,I m a long-time Chipotle fan but today things have changed I walked into a Freebirds and was blown away with their customer service and their food was outstanding.  Very flavorful food  I wish I knew all their names but whoever worked Thursday 1 31 19 around 6 30 PM I applaud you. Charlie and staff were great and the cleanliness of the store at the Hancock center Freebirds will keep me coming back for more 
Freebirds World Burrito,83,I m not really sure why  but after shopping at the same Red River HEB for the past four years  I have not gone to try the Freebirds next door until this last week. Maybe I m just a loyal Chipotle fan  Maybe. Could that have influenced this review  Maybe.  I like that you get a choice of different tortillas  though I still prefer Cabo Bob s freshly made variety ones over Freebirds. Pretty standard fillings  A-OK and nothing outstanding. This wasn t a burrito that made me go   OH MY GOODNESS   but it filled me up and was somewhat satisfying.
Freebirds World Burrito,84,So before I moved to TX I thought I knew good monster burritos. I started eating monster burritos in Big 10 country  ie  Big ten burrito  BTB  and Panchero s. Gradually Qdoba and Chipotle moved in on the scene. Regardless I will say there are no tortillas as delicious as Panchero s and stand my ground on that ANY day. However tortillas aside  I was schooled when I moved to TX.  First of all Mexican Tex-mex in TX trumps anything I ve ever had back home. I m just going to say it. Regardless having sampled my share of burritos I will say that hands down Freebirds is my favorite.  First of all I like that they have spinach tortillas. Personally the usual choice of white or whole wheat is boring. Second  they have TWO kinds of rice  Cilantro lime or mexican. Third  they have ground beef  I will on occasion get a chicken burrito but ground beef gets me every time. Finally.... my trump card. Okay  I never get cheese on my burritos. I grew up mildly lactose intolerant until I somehow schooled my stomach into becoming lactose tolerant by sheer will and consumption of dairy products. So while I eat cheese now  I prefer it mainly only on Pizza and in Cheese platter form. Regardless as many people know most places charge you for guacamole. Freebirds also charges for guac usually but there is an exception.  At most burrito places while I pass on the cheese and add guac I still get charged for guac and don t receive any benefit for skipping cheese. At freebirds since I don t get cheese I can get half guac and half sour cream.... FOR FREE    That s right  my lack of cheese consumption totally pays off here. I love this  Plus they re always super generous at this location with the guac since I usually get more like 3 4 guac  1 4 sour cream.  Anyway  all of these factors makes freebirds a winner in my book  All I m saying is that the best guac is FREE guac  D
Freebirds World Burrito,85,Not going back again  they took away the taco combo which was  5 and now you have to order everything a la cart which ads up to  9  no thanks  I can find a different way to spend my  5.  Also they got rid of the roasted garlic and the grilled limes  and couldn t find the limes at the sauce bar.  It s been good for years but I guess the profits have been shrinking due to the new taco places everywhere and they are cutting back on things people like and food quality chicken seemed to be sitting out a while and nothing was HOT like it used to be  Sorry freebirds  long time customer  gone.
Freebirds World Burrito,86,My basic burrito was disgusting that I didn t eat all of it and I lost my appetite for the rest of that night. Won t be back. Also don t ask for a little bit extra meat bc they ll only give u the two small cubes of chicken but wanna charge for 3 or more.
Freebirds World Burrito,87,This place sucks the food isn t fresh and the counter is always messy. Font go here if you want a delicious meal
Freebirds World Burrito,88,Place is legit and beats the shit out chipolte And I don t have to get worry about getting sick
Freebirds World Burrito,89,Top Five Reasons I Shamelessly Like Chipotle Better Than Freebirds  1.  Sour cream costs  .75 extra at Freebirds  free at Chipotle  2.  No carnitas at Freebirds 3.  Generally tasteless meat at Freebirds 4.  No  bowl  option at Freebirds 5.  Freebirds  rice tastes like Uncle Ben s  Sure  Freebirds has a cooler vibe  sassy emo-ish employees  better music  and That BBQ Sauce.  But Chipotle s food is a hundred times tastier and fresher.  So in the Battle of the Big Burrito Chains  my vote goes to Chipotle.
Freebirds World Burrito,90,I went here for the first time to try something new. I got 2 chicken tacos with pinto beans  cheese  lettuce and sour cream  which is  1 extra apparently . First off  my tacos were  not even a slight bit warm as I paid for my food. Second  did not taste fresh at all. The chicken was dry  lettuce soggy  and tortilla cold.   The staff was friendly and the restaurant did look clean but I do not plan on coming back.
Freebirds World Burrito,91,Ok   you see how I have 5 stars up there  Here s why... I ADD QUESO.  See  I went through this love hate relationship with Freebirds while I was in college. I would either be really into it  or think it was the worst thing ever invented. Then I realized what I was doing wrong. What I should have been doing all along. Saying six simple words... Can I get some Queso  too    How easy is that. Of course  you all must know I do NOT agree with putting lettuce and a bunch of tomatoes on my burritos. Save that for a salad. The best burritos consist of  beans  meat  chese  and hot sauce. Rice is optional  but those other ingredients should always serve as your base for any burrito you ever have.   At Freebirds  this is my game plan.   Stand in line hoping that whoever I get to make my burrito knows what they are doing and doesn t skimp on the ingredients.   Say   I ll have a Freebird on Cayanne.   Rice  Beans  Cheese  YES  Please.  Rice   Refried Beans   the Jack  they also have a cheddar mix   Meat  I usually go with the Steak or the Dark Chicken. Lately  the steak.  This is where you gotta tell them what you want  The person making your burrito will say... Any Sauce  and here  right here  at this moment is when you say...  Can I get some Queso  too  or some variation of that. Make them do it. Right here  Right now. This will allow for the queso to start mixing in with all your Base ingredients.  After the queso is added  I go for the Death Sauce  because I m Mexican and I cannot resist spicy  and I also add some of the Mild  verde  sauce.   Any vegetables   Ill have some White Onion and Cilantro.  Anything else   No Thanks  that looks great.  The person making your burrito will then wrap your burrito up into some foil and then you are set.   I suggest buying a drink because this is one of the few places in town that offers Cherry Pepsi and if you didn t know  It s Awesome. It also helps wash down that burrito.  Additional tip. By the drinks they have a Hot Sauce Bar...Bar-b-cue  Hot  Mild and on the table you can find the Death sauce.  I usually get a little plastic container of each and put little combinations of each on different bites throughout my burrito experience. The barbecue is actually pretty awesome  but I only suggest putting it on yourself as it seems like you could totally ruin your burrito if you had too much.  i.e. asking them to put it on while making your burrito   So that s about it. All you 1 and 2 star reviews on this list....please return to Freebirds and make a burrito that is Identical to the one described above. No one will point and laugh when you admit your mistake.
Freebirds World Burrito,92,Freebirds is yet another entry in the genre of the big fat American burrito.  Unlike Chipotle  this place offers a whole wheat tortilla.  Hell yeah   This is awesome for those of us who d like to eat a massive burrito with marginally reduced  carb guilt .  Besides the regular burrito  which easily packs 4 dig worth of calories   they also offer a  monster  burrito and a  super monster .  I haven t tried either one  and  frankly  I find the idea of someone ordering one of these kinda horrific and disgusting.   On the whole  the burritos here are tasty but not mind-blowing.  Now if Freebirds would have the temerity to venture outside the confines of steak and chicken burritos  they might just push the big fat-ass American burrito envelope.
Freebirds World Burrito,93,I just want to dispel the rumor of Freebirds being a local establishment--it is owned by the Tavistock Group  which also owns Puma and Vans shoes  and a number of other restaurants.  It also has investments in drug research companies  huge country clubs and resorts  and sports and entertainment ventures across the world. You can look up their portfolio online.  There s absolutely nothing local about them  and there s nothing representative about Austin  except the workers.  The reason I tell you this is because I m so tired about people talking about how hip Freebirds is--it s not--the same company that splashes John Lennon on their walls and talks about saving the environment with recycling and reducing power intake  is also the same company that owns huge resorts and and businesses around the world.  And there s not unique about them--I know for fact from friends  that at most of the restaurants were they have recycling options for customers  the recycling ends up in the trash  because they don t have recycling contracts.  Freebirds is hypocrisy at its finest and the food is average at best.
Freebirds World Burrito,94,Freebirds has quickly become a staple in our dinner lunch rotation. My husband once told me that one of the reasons he bought our current home was its close proximity to this location. Now I know why.  I can t tell much difference in regards to taste between the cayenne  spinach  or regular flour tortilla  but the red makes my burrito look so pretty  that I choose  the cayenne every time. The other ingredients are fresh and tasty  though  as other reviewers have noted  they can be a little salty. If you have a salt aversion  don t get your hopes up too high for Freebirds.   I have recently become quite a bit more health conscious  and am trying to be cautious with my portions  etc  etc.  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FFreebirds.com amp s fa6a6113f5c5b408c52858146c74e3319047a60b16ee8cfa2313ddb65b15e117  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  Freebirds.com  a  has a complete nutritional guide for all of their ingredients and portion sizes  so I can stay on top of what is going in my belly. Also  upon request  the burrito artists will immediately cut your burrito in half and pack it to-go. That way I can enjoy half now  half later  and not be tempted to eat the whole thing in one sitting. I have zero willpower  people  so this is a HUGE plus.
Freebirds World Burrito,95,Cons-    I absolutely hate Freebirds tortillas. All of them. The plain flour ones are tasteless. The cayenne ones have no appreciable hint of cayenne at all. The green ones  spinnach   disturb me. And I m not going to say anything about how they get stuck in your teeth. Whoops.    Rice  no seasoning.    Guacamole  If I wanted green food coloring blended with moist bird feces  I d go to a pet store.    The  steak  is poor quality meat cooked with a recipe that someone else threw in the trash.    The chicken  white or dark  tastes like chicken.    Commercials  They infuriate me. Having a Freebird s commercial come on the radio while driving inspires me to drive my car through the window of their nearest  restaurant.  Bah.
Freebirds World Burrito,96,Freebirds is one of those places that can be great or lousy depending on what you re looking for and how you order. The other reviews accurately point out some of pros and cons of Freebirds  except about the cheese  which does not cost extra  unless you want extra .  The tortillas are the worst part  they re like dried paper slightly reanimated by steaming. I always get cayenne  though the name must refer to the color  because I can t taste any of the pepper. At best  the tortilla doesn t detract from my burrito experience  as long as I don t focus on it  and I peel back the foil wrapping in 1-inch strips  as the sign advises. Otherwise  the moistened paper tortilla might rupture...  The steak is indeed for salt lovers only. If you love beef jerky  you re probably about to have the best burrito ever. Otherwise  I d opt for chicken  white or dark  or veggie  grilled peppers and onions . Of course  the grilled veggies require that you love both salt and black pepper  because they are thoroughly infused with both.  In retrospect  the rice is a bit bland. I started going to Freebirds before Chipotle opened and spoiled me with it s delicious  buttery cilantro-lime goodness. Still  I find Chipotle and its rice to be an entirely different experience. At Freebirds  I m happy to have the rice serve as an unassuming medium to soak up the best part of Freebirds  the sauces.  Freebirds Death Sauce is one of my favorite hot sauces  and I m a hot sauce connoisseur. It s quite hot with its habanero base  but it also has a great  well-rounded flavor and smooth consistency. The best part is that you can have as much as you want  because it s also in shakers on most of the tables. If you want a pure habanero experience  their hottest sauce is just called  Habanero   it s good  but I prefer Death. If you re not a chile-head  the tomatillo-based  Hot  sauce is really tasty verde sauce  and really not all that hot. BBQ and Mild sauces are also available  but I ve never tried them.  The next best thing about Freebirds is the fresh jalapeos. Of all the burrito places I ve been to  Freebirds is the only one to offer this. They have much more flavor and heat than those flimsy pickled jalapeos you normally find elsewhere. Fresh cilantro is also available.  If you re worried about the mediocre tortillas  allow me to recommend the  Bird Nachos . In contrast to their floury brethren  the corn tortilla chips in the nachos are excellent. It took me awhile to try them  but now I mostly opt for nachos over burritos here. As they ll usually ask you  I d also recommend having them put on the queso after the rice  beans  and meat. Putting it on first makes it hard to mix with the other ingredients  and putting it on last  e.g. after lettuce  can be messy.  Finally  there s the issue of the service. At best  there are a number of career burrito artists  who I recognize as working here at least 5 years ago. If you get one of these  your burrito will be generously loaded  and expertly rolled into the perfect shape  unlike those awkward  burrito balls  you sometimes get at places like Chipotle and Qdoba . At worst  you ll end up with a sleepy college neophyte that has yet to learn the art. There s still hope here though  as long as you re not shy about telling them what to put on and when  and call them on any light scoops. They re on their own for the rolling  but they usually do fine  and will start over with a new tortilla if they screw up.
Freebirds World Burrito,97,My friend from Austin has been raving about Freebirds for as long as I ve known him  so I knew I had to go there when fortune s winds blew me to Austin for a weekend.  My group and I were thrilled with it.  The steak is so tender and delicious  and the fact that you can get it in a 6 to 7 pound burrito is absurd in the best possible way.   I split one with my friend.   The ability to buy a bucket of beer is also really great to me  but I guess that s more of a Texas thing  I m from PA  so I m not used to being able to buy beer at a fast casual joint like this.  In any event  I think I paid about  13 for five bottles of Shiner.  If I were to go back to Austin  I would without a doubt make the pilgrimage to Freebirds again.
Freebirds World Burrito,98,I m encouraged to see other 1-star ppl here  because when I usually tell people I hate Freebird s  I nearly get stoned to death.  Carrie is right about intestinal parasites.  I have eaten here several times  and I am ALWAYS sick afterwards.  I just won t eat there anymore  because I ve never not gotten sickly afterwards.  And even if I didn t get sick  I just didn t feel the food was worthy of the praises it always gets.  Mission Burritos in Houston is way better  and the Maximos at Chango s own Freebirds any day of the week  but you pay a premium .  I ve also eaten at the one Aggies claim is the original on what they call their drag across from their campus.  I was treated very rudely once it was learned that I m a Longhorn.  Enough with that crap.  I wanted to like Freebird s  but due to too many pukings and nasty bowel movements  I just can t.  Also  I can t stand their commercials.  It s like they re trying to be Austin-y weird  but it fails - miserably.  Please leave the tin foil to wrapping burritos.
Freebirds World Burrito,99,Let me start by saying.. meh.  I used to visit Freebirds all the time when I was a student and shopped at the Hancock center to get groceries. I don t know if it was just a bad day  but the food was bland and the chicken was dry.  I ordered the equivalent of the burrito bowl at Chipotle. It was not very appetizing. The Chicken was dry and the lettuce was soggy. When I asked for sour cream on top  I was given a squeeze of sour cream out of a ketchup style bottle. It looked like it had been refrigerated to the point where it maintained the ring shape on top of my food. It spread like butter. It just wasn t appetizing.  The quality is no where near that of Qdoba  Chipotle or Torchy s in my opinion. I think the staff are nice and the place has a lot of personality  but the food needs seasoning bad. Cilantro  salt  pepper  etc. I ll have to try another location to see if this is a consistent experience.
Freebirds World Burrito,100,Burritos hold a special place in my heart.  Once upon a time  I would go bar hopping in Detroit about 4 nights a week and at the end of ever night  I was hankering for something thick  juicy  and meaty.  Instead of going gay  I would walk into Qdoba and score on of their bad ass chicken burritos  and let me tell you  these things were the best drunk food since hot dogs had chili smothered all over them.  So  it should come as little surprise that when the moon turns full  like a werewolf  I need to dine on flesh.  I was able to procure a chicken burrito  or 5  and proceeded to douse them in all the drunk favorites.  Guac  lettuce  pica de gallo  black beans  salsa  bodily fluids  all the basic food groups well represented.  One bite in and I knew it wasn t the same as my beloved Qdoba  but it was still pretty good. But then again  what kind of dumb ass screws up a burrito   Will I return to said establishment  Maybe  depends if when I get another burrito craving and if the full moons align Howling style for a werewolf gang bang.  Getting silver bullets  Gabriel
Freebirds World Burrito,101,Burrito is the new hamburger and fries.  Thus by virtue of just being a  burrito place  the rating is capped at 4 stars.  But one things for sure  this place is way better than Chipotle.  The key differences are the awesome spanish rice and that you don t fart blood later on  and have to use the telebrands product endorsed by Billy Mays.  That very last part isn t true  but a reference to Southpark.  Let me put it this way.  I currently further from Austin proper than I care to.  The Chipotle is way closer.  When I need a meal of epic proportions I will rarely go to Chipotle  preferably never.  But I will make the trip into Austin just for Freebirds  I ll try to package my errands because...ya know...gotta be green.
Freebirds World Burrito,102,I hate to do it  but I can t endorse this kind-of-local phenomenon. Freebirds World Burrito originally began in Santa Barbara  CA before moving to College Station and eventually on to Austin and other Texas locations.    I ve been to the 41st St. and SoCo locations many times and have been continually disappointed. The location on 41st attracts many students as both customers and employees  making for long lines and slow  disinterested service. The food is never hot  our burritos always fall apart  and as a friend of mine has pointed out  the size of your meal depends entirely on who your  burrito builder  happens to be during that visit. Some employees make every effort to stock your order with all the fixings you ask for  while others carelessly toss a few shreds of lettuce  a couple peppers and a dash of cheese on your tortilla. But  I must be honest....I think my real angst towards Freebirds has more to do with their charging extra for sour cream  cheese or guacamole. The guacamole I can understand  but extra for cheese and sour cream  C mon.    Taste buds said...Yech  Blech  Pa-tooey.   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.freebirds.com amp s 56f46f3ec0f36fab4bb923795e026be4224d0a50c6906c96cd72ebf629eeeae9  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  freebirds.com  a 
Freebirds World Burrito,103,Freebirds isn t the best burrito that I have ever had  but they are always a reliable choice for lunch or dinner.  I first started eating at Freebirds in College Station back in 1997 and it has become a regular part of my diet ever since.    There is a decent amount of possible combinations so if you don t like your first try here you can always try something different.  I have tried many different burritos here but I found a combination that is exactly what I am looking for so I tend to stick with that.    My biggest complaint is that the steak here is terrible.  It tends to be a bit on the fatty grizzled side so I tend to stick with a vegetarian burrito.  I am allergic to poultry so I have never had the chicken  but I hear that it is much better than the beef.  A lot of people tend to over-hype Freebirds as the greatest place in town  but it isn t.  That s why so many people tend to be disappointed after eating here for the first time.  It is a great place to go if you want to get completely stuffed with a few friends without spending a ton of money.  Don t come here expecting a life changing experience.
Freebirds World Burrito,104,This was my first Freebird experience about 9 years ago.  It was a Sunday afternoon treat to go to Freebirds back with the regular steak was only 5 bucks.  I love this place.  I remember the first time I saw a Freebird.  So big.  So shiny.  All covered in foil.    I love Freebirds so much that I dressed up my dog as a Super Monster Burrito  he was 135 lbs of muscle at the time  for Halloween.  I had two other little dogs at the time that also went as a Regular bird and the Half Flight.  That just proves my love for the Bird.    I still frequent Freebirds  just not at this location.  See me again 
Freebirds World Burrito,105,I m not a Chipotle fan  and so I really didn t think I was going to enjoy Freebirds since it sort of felt like a version of Chipotle when I walked in. Alas  I was impressed  The ingredients are super fresh and good  and I ll definitely go here over Chipotle any day.
Freebirds World Burrito,106,Top Five Reasons I Shamelessly don t know the difference between Chipotle and Freebirds   Cons 1. Freebirds has a Austin Weird vibe  2. Strange employees.  3. That music sucks. 4. BBQ Sauce does not belong on Burritos.  Or in them. 5. Not that tasty  but big  fresh and fast.    Pros 1.  Sour cream costs  .75 extra  the way of the future everywhere. 2.  No carnitas at Freebirds  don t miss it  the steak will do. 3.  Well seasoned and tender meat. 4. They have a   bowl  option. 5.  I like Uncle Ben s  and it gets lost in the roll-up anyway  So in the Battle of the Big Burrito Chains  my vote doesn t count  but Freebird s sure serves some bulk.  .
Freebirds World Burrito,107,Everyone compares the Freebird s to the Chipotle  who will win1     I personally like chipotle...  don t stone me yet   but Chipotle is no longer owned by McDonald s       Freebird s.... you gotta love those burrito sizes. I can down a monster by myself and still crave a bit more meat. I love how you can pile jalapenos into your burrito. that s fresh baby. mmm.  You can choose your tortilla types  wheat  spinach  cayenne  flour . That s nice but I can never taste the difference cept for wheat. The rice is more mexican to me  to me...  but I m so Asian that I like my rice white  chipotle . But it s good.   Three meats  Dark meat Chicken. White meat Chicken. BEEF.   summary  3 meats  4 sizes  4 tortillas 
Freebirds World Burrito,108,Why did you have to make my meat salty   I want to give you a bonafide 4 stars but I can t because the beef was too salty     The foil sculptures  the friendly staff  and the variety in meal creations makes me almost like you as much if not more than chipotle   C mon.  I will visit you 3 more times and update this rating but this is the rating based on my salty encounter with you.  Beef is not meant to make me want to swallow a gallon of water 
Freebirds World Burrito,109,How can I forget about Freebirds  We went for lunch today and I remembered just how much I like it.  Freebirds is what it is  and I like what it is. I always get a spinach or cayenne tortilla  dark meat chicken  black beans  pico and a little cheese. Topped off with  death  sauce and some Bad-Ass BBQ sauce  it makes a tasty meal.   At lunch  the line snakes out the door  but we were on an assignment to wrangle a dachshund for a photo shoot at work  I love my job  and so we were in the neighborhood early and stopped off for a bite. We got there in the nick of time because that place was packed as soon as we sat down. It s also really loud  and drinks are all Pepsi products  blech.   I did notice that the tortillas were stuck in both of our teeth really badly after we ate. And we both had spinach tortillas. Men were FLOCKING to us. We had to keep swatting them away with foil. It was sick...
Freebirds World Burrito,110,First of all  don t be fooled.  Austin is not the birthplace of Freebirds.   If it was  you might have a little more taste  imagination  and better prices seeing as how a loooooooooong time ago  people used to be able to afford to live here AND go out to eat  hahaha    It just doesn t do it for me.  I don t taste any major flavors jumping out  and that s kind of sad for something that s weighing in at a pound or more.  I mean  that s a LOT of something that doesn t have any taste.   I ve had it 3 times  and each time it s been kind of a let-down.     Anyway  my vote is for Changos.  It s on South Lamar  near Alligator Grill and Half Priced Books...but a little farther south  AND they have Horchata 
Freebirds World Burrito,111,I used to pretty much mouth orgasm everytime I ate at Freebirds  and the prices are good.  But in the last couple of years their ingredients have changed a bit-for the worse.  I like that they still have more of an ingredient and tortilla choice than Chipotle  but it just isn t the same     But I still love this place  and am finally giving it a second chance after a year of switching over to Chipotle.  That guy Mat sure is cute 
Freebirds World Burrito,112,Freebirds is pretty good for desperation food...It s like   I can t wait more than 5 minutes for food  it has to be something that is not a sandwich or pizza  and someone else has to do all the work for me.  Having said that  the tacos are pretty good. But 3 tacos   My god  it s too much food. Once Chipotle set the 3-taco-per-platter standard  Freebirds had to go and be like   us too guys  Wait up    Then they throw in chips and salsa  too. The burritos are okay  but if the tacos were too much  I can t even begin to tell you how absurd the burritos are. It kind of reminds me of eating dog food when everything is all mixed up like that  too.   The service is okay. I remember being an  alternative  kid in high school  so I can relate to these people s angst. It s totally sufficient for what this is  but don t expect fine dining cuisine
Freebirds World Burrito,113,Freebird s vs. Chipotle I ll start with Freebird s. They have 3  4   different types of tortilla for you to choose from  as opposed to Chipotle s one standard tortilla . Their meats are about the same as Chipotle s...umm sauces  they have a wider selection of salsas as well as their special bbq sauce. And you can take some home with you and they won t charge you extra for it. As far as rice...Chipotle s rice is amazing. I m not sure if Freebird s offers rice. I don t remember. As far as decor goes  Freebird s is more interesting. Soo...go to Freebird s if you want a spinach  cheyenne pepper or wheat tortilla but go to Chipotle if you want a big ass burrito.
Freebirds World Burrito,114,Compared to this place Chipotle sucks.  Freebirds is what austin is all about anyway...a chill envoirnment good food  and a gigantasitc burrito.  Its always a great place for a causal lunch  dinner or quick in and out when you are on the run.  Bottom line just go try it  and decide for yourself  if you have never been there then for sure its worth at least one go.    Remember people this is american food  not mexican   
Freebirds World Burrito,115,Freebirds are the best burritos out there. I fell in love with them when I first visited Austin and always make sure I stop by whenever I am in town.
Freebirds World Burrito,116,I m really surprised by all of the Freebirds hate on here.   Everyone compares it to Chipotle  so I will too. I like Chipotle  it s fine  except for the ridiculously salty guac. It s hard to ruin guac  but somehow Chipotle does it.   My major beef with Chipotle is that everything I eat there... tastes like Chipotle. I could spot a Chipotle burrito in a blind taste test. I get tired of it fast and can t go there very often.  Freebirds  on the other hand  has a ridiculous amount of ways to customize your food. Instead of guacamole  you can get avocado slices. You can get red or white onions. You can have random handfuls of garlic thrown on. Add queso straight on to your burrito. Splash extra lime juice on everything. Add fresh jalapenos. It s great. I can go there 5 days in a row and feel like I am getting a unique and tasty meal everytime.  I only wish the death sauce was actually spicier  Thankfully  I can add the fresh jalapenos to make up for its lack.
Freebirds World Burrito,117,Freebirds just fell through the ultimate loophole. It evoked the word  World   ie Freebird s World Burrito  in its name and hence all preconceived notions of what a burrito is or should be can be dispensed with.   So the only remaining and relevant question is  Do I like it .....YES   The meat is grilled to tasty perfection. The tortillas are steamed well. And there is adequate choice and flexibility in the toppings and sauces that within 3 or 4 visits you can triangulate upon your ideal combination and it will be pretty darn consistent run-to-run.   My only pet peeve is that if I want to get 2 burritos I need to bring someone else along to order the second. It s annoying that they can t make more than one burrito per person in their assembly line....but hey...when they make one  they do it well...   My favorite  Regular Steak  Rice  substitute sour cream for beans  optional veggies  barbecue sauce  lime juice  and all the pico that one can fit in. On a GREEN tortilla.   Spinach     Whatever .
Freebirds World Burrito,118,This place definitely lives on reputation and its bbq sauce because most everything else kinda blows. The meat is usually spongy and the rice is usually bland. The workers don t seem to care about anything except for keeping the chalkboard menu nice and cute looking.  Food  5 10 Service  5 10 Ambience  5 10
Freebirds World Burrito,119,Freebirds has a special place in my heart.  It s the first place i ve ever had a Mission Style burrito....before the Chipotle s of the world ever exisited.  Before Freebirds  my idea of a burrito was those tiny little burritos you get at Taco Bell  usually void of fresh ingredients.  Freebirds was different.  Beans  Guac  Salsa  Lettuce  Pico  Rice  Cheese  Onions  Cilantro  Jalapenos  all stuffed and rolled up right in front of your eyes     What Freebirds does a little differently is that they do different sized burritos.  You can go for Freebird  Monster  Super Monster sized.  Monster sized is what you typically get at Chipotle.  Around 7  and is priced similarly.  The Super Monster is around  13 and I can t imagine any one person wants to eat that much burrito  without a fire in the hole sensation down there.  There are also about 6 or 7 different sauces that tickle your fancy.  They even rate the spiciness of the sauces on a scale from 1-10.  Overall nothing above average  but one that does its job to hit the spot.
Freebirds World Burrito,120,Was in the area and stopped in this Restaurant better than Chili s.
Freebirds World Burrito,121,This place s reputation outlives the actual awesomeness of what it serves  which is not awesome  anti-awesome . People who visit Austin are always talking about how great this place is and people from Austin think it s overrated. Well  it is. It s expensive and all you re getting is a silly burrito like the ones they serve at Chipotle. If they food was a lot cheaper and if there were crazy toppings that other places haven t already ripped off  such as the once delicious Hooya s in Denton  then I d probably eat here all of the time because it s right next to my bus stop. What IS cool is the alumninum animals decorating a few nooks in the sky-painted ceiling. And C. T. is right  the employees are all in local bands or look like they should be.
Freebirds World Burrito,122,Just so that you can accuse me of bias right off the bat  I like Chipotle better than Freebirds. Now  with that out of the way  onto the review   It was a while back when I heard of Freebirds. It was actually right after the first Chipotle came in near my hometown of Schertz TX and I was intrigued to compare the two but the nearest one was halfway across San Antonio and I didn t ever feel the need to drive that far just for that. It appeared that I would never be able to hold my own battle of the burritos.   Fate  however  intervened.   I came to school in Austin and found out there was a Freebirds within 5 minutes of me. So I tried it out and while tasty I would have to say inferior to Chipotle. It kept me occupied until the Chipotle off of Barbara Jordan came in but thats not to say I didn t enjoy it.  I liked that you can add queso and that they have a variety of sauces to choose from. I also liked that they had multiple sizes available and while I don t stray from my flour tortillas it was cool to see that they had some options. It was good food and it was close by.   The people at Freebirds are a different story. I think they purposely hire people who don t appear normal. I think they are trying to go with the whole  Keep Austin Weird  thing but sometimes it just creeps me out. Also some of the folks who make your burritos assume you have the hearing of superman. I often have to ask for them to repeat themselves and speak up. Usually they are friendly and make sure your burrito is exactly what you want but it just seems like sometimes you are pulling teeth.   After my initial experience with Freebirds I came back a few times but then I went a whole year without visiting. I went back today and I just felt like it was different. They changed their prices so that now they aren t even numbers after tax and they ve added a lot more vegetables and other toppings  is that the right word   but they don t have any listing for prices on those. I know sour cream  queso  and guacamole are 73 cents more each but how about all these other things  The people almost seemed weirder than before and despite there being like 10 people behind the counter I still had to wait quite a while before I was served.  One last comment before I wrap this up. Who decided that you need 4 layers of aluminum foil between your mouth and burritoy goodness  I mean honestly  I feel like unwrapping the thing is half the battle.  Overall Freebirds has decent food with a unique staff. While I don t mind going there  if given the choice I would pick Chipotle every time.
Freebirds World Burrito,123,I was very pleased with this place.  The decor is fun  and the food is delicious  it totally beats Chipotle.  The queso is just right and the chips fresh and crispy.  I recommend getting the  Monster  size burrito... only about  1 more  and it s so big that you can save half of it for lunch the next day.    The service was great too  one of their workers came around to our table and asked if we needed anything  which is more than you d expect from a typical fast food style place.
Freebirds World Burrito,124,This is Austin. No other food establishment can come close to embodying what Austin is. Music of any genre is blaring in the backround  the whole place is set up as  not normal  right down to the decor. Also you don t get served by some tired  run down corporate pawn in a uniform  you get served by a tired  run down kid like yourself  who is free to wear whateverf shirt they want  free to have whatever piercings they want  basically free.  Let me just give you the best build there is  though there are others  Flour Tortilla Refried beans Mix Cheese Rice  its just not a burrito without rice  Dark Chicken MIld sauce Bar BQ sauce  don t question it  its amazing  Lime juice Garlic Sour Cream Also  ask for extra beans and rice  get that second layer so that when it gets wrapped they are all the way around the awesomeness  The key to Freebirds is identifying the noobs on the staff and avoiding them. They will give you a tiny bird and look at you funny while they do it. My personal advice is to try to become a regular to one of the pros.
Freebirds World Burrito,125,On days when my boyfriend and I can t agree on where to eat or when we re in a rush  Freebirds is our go-to spot. We frequent the Hancock Center and Bee Caves locations.  I LOVE the variety that s offered here  four tortilla flavors  four types of meat  steak  dark meat chicken  white meat chicken  and carnitas pork   grilled veggies  pinto beans  black beans  refried beans  pico de gallo  tomatoes  salsa  lettuce  onions  lime juice  cilantro  etc. The list goes on forever. It s impossible for me to leave hungry. Also  the employees are all very friendly and welcoming. I never second guess going to Freebirds.  TIP  If you re not a fan of beans and leave them out  you can substitute guacamole for free.
Freebirds World Burrito,126,Good   Grass-fed beef  THE only fast-food chain I know of featuring grass-fed beef   Easy-to-access nutritional info on all their food  Has always seemed fresh  Lots of different choices in terms of type of tortilla  Roasted veggies are yummy and free  Workers are always really friendly  Bad  Too noisy inside  Not enough  good tables  in the layout - too many are near the line or entrance  Outdoor seating area sucks - just a bunch of metal tables without any  infrastructure  sun protection  etc.    Overall  this is a place that offers  something for everyone  and is great for a  smaller  group of friends or family. I would have gone 4 stars except the grass fed beef easily earns them an extra star.
Freebirds World Burrito,127,Next time I m hitting up Chipotle. Even though I believe the portions are better here  I didn t like anything about it. If you going there though  hit up the steak  but be wary of what you put in your burrito. Most of what went in mine didn t mix well. If I go back it ll be for the steak  and I think I ll stick with tacos.
Freebirds World Burrito,128,I like these burritos  the steak is really tender and tastes really good. The spinich tortillas are my favorite. Prompt service since like 10 people are working all the time. Nice and friendly  ill go back for sure.
Freebirds World Burrito,129,Burritos are a very rad thing. They begin to lose radness though if they start hanging out with other ingredients that don t go well with burritos... especially ingredients like cockroaches  Which is why I m giving this location 2 stars. Spotted cockroaches partyin at the salsa bar. Super stoned and Still lost my appetite. Place needs a deep cleaning. I Don t pay to party and I especially don t pay to see a cockroach party 
Freebirds World Burrito,130,If you like hyped up trendy burrito joints  eat at Freebirds  If you like bland-ish ingredents  eat at Freebirds  If you like paying six bucks for a blandish burrito that your nine year old nephew could have put together  eat at Freebirds   
Freebirds World Burrito,131,This is my favorite place to eat in Austin  I just love it. The food is always fresh  the people are always friendly and it s never overcrowded. I love the option of eating outside and the fact that it only costs  7 for dinner and a drink.  You have the ability to control everything that goes into your burito. If you opt not to get beans or rice or something keep in mind that you can then get queso  guac or sour cream for free. If you get everything and still want one of those things keep in mind that they are an additional 25 cents each.   My sister and I love this place so much we eat here at least once a week if not more. It s something you ll never get sick of and will constantly be craving   Yummy......
Freebirds World Burrito,132,Okay okay  so I m finally writing a review for this place. My family and I have been going here for years. I love the Austin atmosphere in the place. They do not discriminate against who they hire  They actually tend to lean toward hiring what most people consider  odd-balls .  Service is always great. Food is always the bomb diggity. And you gotta love looking at all the foil creations people leave all over the place   
Freebirds World Burrito,133,Pros  clean  upbeat and inviting environment  good crowd  Cons  the food  Recommendation  If you want to sip on a fountain soda with a date at a cool spot  come here. If you want to enjoy good food  stay away.  I opened the doors and was very skeptical with what I saw. It was another one of those mega-build-your-own-burrito places  tons of options and sub-par quality. I would have normally walked out  yet  I was recommended to Freebirds so I remained open minded and thought   Hey  maybe this place will be different.   I stepped in line and chatted with customers as the line moved along. The atmosphere seemed relaxed  fun  and inviting. I asked the employees and customers what they would suggest and they all gave me solid suggestions of popular choices and their own favorites. I was happy and even excited about my burrito at this point.  Then came that first bite. Ugh. No  It was the same bland  flavorless  texture-less crap that all these places doll out. The rice was tasteless and overcooked with the beans receiving the same treatment. The vegetables were mushy and lacked form  as if they had been sitting in their water-filled heat bath for too long. Also  they were tasteless. The avocado inside was not sensed  and the salsas were mild-tasting at best  as in flavor .  I ate my food  threw away the wrapper and head out the door with no desire to ever return to Freebirds or any other burrito factory.
Freebirds World Burrito,134,When my friend took me on a food tour of Austin  this was the one place that I found to be really weak. The service was very stoned and friendly  which I kinda like  and otherwise the atmosphere is fine. But it s all about the burrito  and to me there is very little difference between Freebirds and Chipotle in terms of taste and quality. The rice and salsa options are nearly identical to Chipotle.  The chicken burrito I had wasn t bad  but I wouldn t go back for more. Thankfully  the other places my friend took me to were much better.
Freebirds World Burrito,135,My least favorite freebirds in Austin. The staff seems stuck up and not as laid back as the other locations. The friendly atmosphere doesn t exist here. Often times the chicken is dry or nearly charred. It s still a freebirds  just not the one I choose to frequent.
Freebirds World Burrito,136,When I was a younger man  I traded my writing skills to University of Texas students for simple items like a case of beer or a Freebirds burrito.  Even after hammering out a 5 page essay on some boring subject  I always felt I got the better end of the deal.  I only point this out to let you know exactly how good a Freebird s burrito can be.  With the right selection of items  the burrito can rival the Fillet Mingon as a true masterpiece.  It seems like the  greatness  of a Freebird s burrito has diminished a bit  but maybe that s because I m no longer a broke 20-something trading term-papers for burritos.  However  I m reserving the 5th star because I don t think Freebirds qualifies as a  must visit.   The food is still really good in my opinion and if you want a quick  filling lunch  Freebirds is a fine choice.  But it s not a must-visit Austin experience.
Freebirds World Burrito,137,Gnarly.  Peanut sauce on a damn burrito    Ethnic fusion cuisine is obnoxious even when it is prepared well  and breakfast tacos  not burritos  are the appropriate vector for administration of Mexican food. Burritos don t belong in Texas. They belong in California  as do the Californians. There goes the neighborhood.
Freebirds World Burrito,138,Simply delicious. I love this place  you can walk in get something to eat fast and yummy    I always get the hybird and its alwaus more than enough food. I also enjoy the keeping it wierd staff. Cool people.
Freebirds World Burrito,139,You ll find  californian  mexican style taqueria burritos here - tex mex burritos are totally different. Its closest competitors are Berry Hill  Houston and somewhere near 360   which serves up Baja style and Chipolte - a decent western US chain but due to a food poisioning scare some time ago - i doubt i ll go to Chipolte. Since west coast taquerias are not common here  the lines can be long as people that frequent here seem pretty confused by the concept of deciding which type of tortilla  what kind of beans  cheese  meat  they do offer a vegetarian burrito    vegtables  and salsas they want... also depending on who prepares your burrito you might  be short-changed on the toppings. Prices are reasonable and everything is rounded up to the nearest quarter for simplicity.  Weekends are crowded.
Freebirds World Burrito,140,Freebirds makes a good burrito. It s not the best burrito in a city where burritos are used in place of communion wafers  but that s ok. Besides  it s still up there among burritos. It s not good enough to merit a precious 5th star.   The real reason I like this place so much-it s location is such that I make an emergency stop to make sure that I don t go to HEB while hungry and fill my shopping cart with every conceivable foodstuff that I can cook. In this respect  the burrito pays for itself and then some.
Freebirds World Burrito,141,The food is good this is definitely an Austin based company. They person that made your food normally comes by and asks how is every thing. They have fresh brewed ice tea  but no sweet tea. There is beer as well. Always friendly and very Austinatious. The staff doesn t change much  so you do see the same people making your food.
Freebirds World Burrito,142,As far as a fast-food lunch -- when you ve just spent a couple hours at Sears shopping for Levi s and Kenmore vacuum cleaner bags and you re about to head to Lowe s on the other end of town to pick up some grout -- it s a snippet better than average.  It s not great  it s not horrible - it s basically okay  especially if you re just going to split a Monster-size between two for nothing more than a hold-over snack.   I think they have a different understanding of Monster-size than I do - the size is laughable more than it s scary.   I like it better than I do all the other fast food burrito chains  even though the quality of your burrito does indeed depend on mood of the employee preparing it.  But it usually ends up to be a decently satisfying snack  and it doesn t make me run for the Tums afterward  like a certain McD s owned burrito chain... .  p.s. This location does not have the impressive collection of foil thingies that the one on South Congress has.
Freebirds World Burrito,143,My expectations were low  but my Freebird burrito rocked my world. Fresh ingredients and lots of flavor. The staff was a little weird and perhaps they need a lesson counting change  but my interaction with them was minimal anyway.  Yum.
Freebirds World Burrito,144,I know Freebirds started in California  and I actually had my first Freebird in College Station which was extremely delicious.  The one at Hancock has meat that doesn t have much taste and the lettuce is usually very soppy. Even with those negatives  it is still a solid burrito   I enjoy their burritos for what they are  just a giant pile of things in a big tortilla.  Here s an interesting fact  those who keep saying that its not authentic Tex-Mex or straight up Mexican food need to realize that Mexican s use corn tortillas and that German immigrants to Texas invented the flour tortilla. So calm down and stop flexing your  I know what a good burrito is  attitude. Put your pitchforks down.  Let s hug it out.
Freebirds World Burrito,145,I m surprised to see a lot of  reviews on this one and even more surprised that people like Chipotle better. I love the options at free birds  way better then Chipotle. And by options i mean good options like vegetables  cheese  beans or heck what if you only feel like half a burrito  then you get the half bird. Or if you want more go with the Monster or Super Monster. Again when I m in Austin I try to make it out to this place. And if people want to talk about how lifeless the tortillas are then come to Chicago where Corn rules and flour ones taste worst then any I have ever had.    Last Note  The first time I had Chipotle I swore I would never go there again  I thought it might compare but it in no way can it come close.
Freebirds World Burrito,146,I don t know how Freebirds became an Austin institution  especially since it s a California institution  and came to College Station before it came to Austin. It must be the atmosphere  which feels very appropriate for a college town. And while I prefer this kind of anti-institution feel  even from a chain  the burritos are ultimately underwhelming.  Other s have mentioned it before  and they are right. The tortillas are gummy and flavorless. I ve had cayenne  spinach  and traditional flour tortillas  and they all taste the same. Then there s the rice  which is bland and soggy. I much prefer Chipotle s lemon zested white rice. Finally  there is the fact that Freebirds charges 75 ccents for a spoonful of sour creme. I can go to the grocery store and buy an entire tub of sour creme for less. And it s not like they make the sour creme in-store.  The final result is a somewhat flavorless burrito that constantly gets stuck in your teeth. Really  Chipotle is much better. More meat variety  They have carnitas and barbacoa   and fresher greens  They do not use the prepackaged  pre-chopped lettuce that Freebirds uses . These days  I only eat Freebirds if someone else requests it.
Freebirds World Burrito,147,I like Freebirds.  Food here is just as reliable as any other Freebirds  but as I saw expressed by at least one other person  everyone here seems very Hipster and high on stuff.  Didn t affect my service or food  but hipsters and stoners don t rank high on my prefer people list.  Veggie Burrito is excellent   
Freebirds World Burrito,148,Tonight I had my second burrito from Freeb rds and I loved it. They do something quite special with their grilled vegetables...TRY THEM   I like the choice of a cayenne tortilla  there s also spinach  flour  and whole wheat  I believe . If you don t get meat in your burrito  make sure you get either guacamole  sour cream  or sliced avocado for free. The roasted corn was delicioso. They have four sizes of burrito ranging from a petite finger-sized burrito to a  Super Monster  burrito that  which  in my opinion  is a level of gluttony one person should do their best to avoid.  The staff was really nice both times I visited. The funniest thing about the placeis that from the ceiling of both locations I visited hangs a motorcycle. Riding the motorcycle is Lady Liberty herself  the Statue of Liberty...gown just a-blowin . In her hand  instead of a torch  is a MASSIVE burrito. The whole  Born to Be Wild  Skynyrd theme of the place is pretty cheesy  but come on  that s funny   Bravo Freeb rds.
Freebirds World Burrito,149,I have to admit  I m probably one of the few people that actually likes Freebirds WB and DOES NOT like the burritos. It s nothing against their burritos...they re just fine if you like that sort of thing. I just don t happen to like an entire Mexican food dinner wrapped up in a tortilla. I don t like a huge pile of rice and all that other stuff all up in my burrito.   BUT...I absolutely LOVE their quesadillas  I like spicy food  so I usually get either chicken or beef on a cayenne tortilla with habanero sauce...have them add a little bit of sour cream to cut the pain just a bit...loads of cheese and a bit of peppers and onions...throw it on the grill and I m all set  Wonderful    You can keep the burrito  monster or otherwise  I ll order a quesadilla every time. Some of their tasty chips and queso if I m extra hungry 
Freebirds World Burrito,150,Service was great. I have 2 boys with weird requests and they were awesome.  Didn t question or protest.  Staff was very nice. As always good was awesome
Freebirds World Burrito,151,The food here is great  however the communication is poor. I was getting nachos and was told the guacamole was free when i specifically asked. They said yes so i had it added. I also had a little bit of sour cream added and they waited until the end of the line to tell me it was extra. On top of that they now stated that guacamole was extra too when I specifically asked before having it added. Pretty poor way of doing business.
Freebirds World Burrito,152,This is the Freebird s I usually end up at. It s right by the UT   t.u.  campus  so it can get pretty busy  but there s plenty of parking and the line always moves fast. Yay  Mountain Dew  The guy serving me today told me to say stop when I had enough BBQ sauce  and I didn t say it  the bottle ran out. Perfect. I still had to add some later.  The original College Station location is still my favorite  but this is a great place to get  a burrito as big as your head  as my college roommate used to put it.
Freebirds World Burrito,153,Love the super monster beef steak mmm it took me two hours too eat it so good and tasty worth stopping in
Freebirds World Burrito,154,I have been a regular diner here for many years. Unfortunately  it is morphing into Chipoltle. Gone are the taco meal deal  and others. Replaced is a menu that appears more like its competitors - prices and all. It s sad really  because I always chose this over competitors because of the value. Now there s no compelling reason to choose Freebirds.
Freebirds World Burrito,155,I was not a big fan of Freebirds  but my love for Chipotle could have influenced that.  The lady who made my burrito was nice  but she was rather pushy even though I was the only person in line. She spoke very quickly so I had no idea what she was asking me half the time. The final result was a steak burrito with to much stuff in it and not enough tortilla. I told her it should probably be double wrapped and she just gave me a funny look.   The taste was off and I prefer Tabasco on my burrito instead of their house sauce.
Freebirds World Burrito,156,Maybe you were having an off day  but on my first time there in 4 years  after a history of being underwhelmed  i decided to not go the chipotle route and instead support local business. BUT the rice was really  underdone  and the meat was grey gristle blandness. Bad food. The staff is great  the vibe excellent.  but its not enough to coast on being the most  austin  burrito place in  austin. Again  maybe you were just having an off day.
Freebirds World Burrito,157,Their burrito bowl is amazing i got the steak and its full of flavor I think its a tie between them and chipotle   
Freebirds World Burrito,158,I am an avid fan of the burrito and decided to try something other than my go-to Chipotle. I m positive that I won t be going back to Freebirds  at least for a burrito. I don t want to compare everything to Chipotle  but hey  it s what I know.  I got a Freedbird-size chicken burrito on a flour tortilla. Some parts of the chicken were burnt  the burrito wasn t completely wrapped  and there was an overall lack of flavor. I also didn t like the blaringly loud music. I don t want to have to yell my order to someone who s standing two feet away from me. I ll have to return to Chipotle because there I can get a bigger and much more flavorful burrito for less money.
Freebirds World Burrito,159,Great store  I made a catering order and  despite my continuous revisions  Meryl Oden was extremely patient and helpful.
Freebirds World Burrito,160,Have yet to have a bad experience here at this location. People have always been friendly and my orders have always been right. Definitely love a hybrid on spinach with veggies  guac  sour cream  refried beans  rice  mixed cheese and salsa. yummy
Freebirds World Burrito,161,Meh. It was alright. I like the fact that there were a lot of choices available such as the size and type of burrito tortilla  such as vege  spicy  wheat  etc.  you wanted. But the quality of meat and vegetables wasn t much different from Chipotle or Qdoba. And I would also like to stress that the guacamole was pretty mediocre and watery.
Freebirds World Burrito,162,In an effort to reduce my carb intake after all the holiday binging  I ordered a steak salad at Freebirds.  I am more of a burrito person usually  but I m glad I decided to branch out.  A spicy lime vinegarette topped the salad of romaine  cabbage  pico  cheese  and dry-rubbed slices of steak. Normally  I think you get beans and tortilla strips in the salad  but I opted out. It sounds plain  but the seasoning on the meat combined with the tangy dressing made this a delicious meal  two meals actually. It was huge   I d definitely order a steak salad again if I wanted to cut down on carbs.  I still like burritos better though  so see my other 3 Freebird reviews for a full picture of what this place has to offer.
Freebirds World Burrito,163,Beware the burritos.  I think the Californians or the Aggies or whoever is responsible for this abomination are trying to slip us some intestinal parasites through this location   the closest Freebirds to UT  because when I go to this Freebirds  more often than not  I get ill.  I haven t been a whole lot of times  3 total.  The first time it was alright.  The second time  I ended up puking.  The third time my Aggie friend wanted Freebirds so we went and I got sick.  I think it s because the lime sauce was contaminated.  I didn t notice at first  but a couple of bites into the burrito I smelled fish.  I ve always just assumed it was the lime sauce since chicken and rice and cheese can t possibly go that bad without growing fuzz.  I can usually forgive a restaurant for possible food poisoning but twice in a row and something as gross as fishy lime juice is unforgivable.
Freebirds World Burrito,164,You really need to forget about Chipotle  the poor  McDonald s imitation of Freebirds.  Freebirds was the first decent  indie chain I discovered in Austin when I came up for school  it was the first thing I looked for when I recently moved to Dallas.  I consider  7 for lunch cheap for food of higher quality than fast food and the line has always moved quickly.  I couldn t tell you the nutritional facts  but it ll cover all of the food groups.  Sizes range from adequate-for-usual-consumption to ridiculous-by-all-means.  Just know that no matter which size you pick  your need to clear out your digestive system will be taken care of.  As long as you know this ahead of time and avoid the sauce on the table  you ll be fine and have enough time to make it back to home base.  There are four locations in the Austin area and they break down like this  1   This one at Hancock Center is usually the busiest  seeing foot traffic at all hours of the day from near-by UT and its 50 000 students and the usual lunch crowd.  You could also categorize it as the most avant-garde of the locations  because it is staffed by members of Austin s music scene  frequented by the UT Basketball team  and plays only the most-obscure music they can find on satellite radio. 2   On Bee Caves 2222  just west of Mopac  if you prefer to dine along side West Lake s most trendy teenagers.  Make sure to pop that collar.  This location seems to have the highest rate in turn-over  but they have the nicest out-door seating.  This location is  usually  the cleanest. 3   Techridge  near Dell.  Probably the most straight-laced of all the Austin locations  the only one more whitebread is the location in Ft. Worth.  The ingredients are the same  but depending on who makes your burrito  it might end up a tad too tight and too long.  This one is filled with  you guessed it  techies.  Leave the Converse All-Stars and heavy eye-liner to the ones making your burrito. and 4   S. Congress  just south of Riverside.  Probably the most-balanced location  just enough weirdo Austin meets just enough mainstream  without any of the kiddies.
Freebirds World Burrito,165,As someone who seen the insides of  Freebird s for longer than I care to mention  take my word for it  and go get a real burrito somewhere else.  Maybe your tastebuds override this review  and if so  more power to you...  but this is the saltiest  most preservative filled food outside of a laboratory.  The employees have little incentive to anything other than keep from being fired  and so there have been some confirmed anomalies that have come out of their kitchen.  Did I mention how much salt is in this food   The menu isnt particularly cheap  especially when contrasted with the cost and quality of the ingredients in the food.  Do youself a favor and get burritos from Changos  Polvos  Chuys  or any of the other local burritorias.
Freebirds World Burrito,166,Dude  this place is the bomb. I was there the other day after some soccer walking around in my cleats and shin guards and all...and boy  did the veggie freebird burrito satisfy or what  The best part about eating a burrito is the pre-eating...which is where you unwrap the burrito from its packaging -- this sounds a bit sexual but it s absolutely unintentional...it was just that freakin  good. But back to my point -- these guys know how to wrap a burrito perfectly cylindrical and that just makes it that much better to unwrap and eat. If you haven t been here  do go. If you don t like it  I ll buy your next meal.
Freebirds World Burrito,167,i m not afraid to admit it   i lived for 3.5 years in austin  longhorn country  and was an aggie sympathizer the entire time.  neener neener.  did my best friend from high school in cali go to a amp m  she sure did.  did i visit her all the damn time   i sure did.  did i eat freebird s on northgate while shitfaced   i sure did...more times then i can count.  so i m a total freebird s groupie.  and let s just stop comparing it to chipotle  shall we   i mean  come on.  if i want an egg mcmuffin  i ll get an egg mcmuffin.  so here s the thing   regular  chicken  whole black beans and  the kicker  half that squeeze bottle of bbq sauce you re wielding.  it s goddamn heaven.
Freebirds World Burrito,168,I will always pick Freebirds over any of its competitors for the same reason as Nicholas S.  I love the fact that they let me get queso instead of beans.  I didn t even have to ask for it the first time.  When I said I didn t want beans  they offered to put queso instead - and it was great  
Freebirds World Burrito,169,Again    food is good but not great.  Ordering food is not well organized.  I had two different people taking my order.....one for my food and one for my daughter s.  Both people were talking to me at the same time....from opposite ends of the line.  Meanwhile other people are ordering and are trying to maneuver through the line too.  It was loud so conversation is challenging.
Freebirds World Burrito,170,If they call themselves Freebirds  then they need to play Leonard Skynard Constantly.  Anything else is an injustice to the freebird heritage. So finally the giant assembly line burrito has made its way to Austin with your choice of 3 tortilla sizes  4 tortilla flavors  4 meats  and bottomless sodas.  While I end up spending  10 -  12 for lunch  I usually end up with leftovers for dinner. The problem is that all the good stuff costs extra and seriously bites into your burrito budget.  The illusion of freedom of choice means that you have no one to guide you to real flavors.  Indeed all the combinations of food basically taste the same.  Worse you feel bad about yourself because you didn t design the ultimate burrito.  I want a place that takes responsibility for its burrito design and gets it right like El Chilito. A lot of people give this place high marks  but I would say it comes form lack of experience with true burrito excellence. Lord knows this bird is going to have to change.
Freebirds World Burrito,171,Had a freebird burrito at this location just yesterday after a long hiatus. Not because I don t like them but because there is no locations close to where I work live. But I was down at this area and decided to dine in. Got your standard burrito and coke with one of their pot brownies. It was good but not great  definately not as good as a burrito or bowl from Chipotle  who I would only rate about 4 stars themselves . Staff was helpful and all smiles as usual. Quality of the product has suffered I am afraid. Also there was this awesome hot sauce they would leave out on the tables condiments area  not sure if they did away with this or just using their own branded hot sauce now  yucky . Definitely lost a star because of that.
Freebirds World Burrito,172,This was my first time trying out Freebirds  and it ll be my last.   Pros   Big selection  Cons   Sour cream is extra  really   Expensive  even more expensive than Chipotle  Tasteless  flavorless meat  flavorless beans  cheap cheese  cheap lettuce   Also  the service was horrific. I was the only person there  and I stood for several minutes waiting for someone to come make my burrito. Once I got to the checkout  a group of people were standing around socializing  and I waited for somebody to ring me up. Finally one of them said  who s gonna ring them up   and they all sort of just stood there and shrugged until one of them finally did it. I kind of wanted to say  eh don t bother  and leave.   I ll take a small selection of yummy food and efficient service over a large selection of tastelessness and carelessness any day.
Freebirds World Burrito,173,You should bring the tempeh back. That new stuff is greazy  and the vegetable is potatos. I m sure people like it but the tempeh with veggies was way healthier. I m probably the only person that bought it though.
Freebirds World Burrito,174,You think this place is all fun and wraps  but let me tell you something.  The queso is unadulterated nectar of the gods  and we all know you can judge a place by its queso if nothing else.  There were a few years there where the entertainment value of this particular FB s was really up there.  One of the staff was completely in love with my boyfriend.  It was decided that I wasn t allowed to come so that he could get the sweet deals on our wraps for a while.  A-OK with me.  We haven t seen her in a while  but we re fine with paying full price for the delectable burritos.  And let s just get this straight  I m giving this place 5 stars based on what they are.  You can t compare burritos here and burritos at say  Fonda San Miguel.  This is fast nummers and it is good when in the mouth.  Also  I m that nerd that hates national chains  so eff you Chipotle 
Freebirds World Burrito,175,This placed was introduced to me by someone that grew up around the Austin area  she raved and raved. And  I agree  it s good...it s just not GREAT. And while I know that most people love big portions- their portions are immense  and are not  in my opinion  the kind you want to take home for later. I m also  as others have said here  not impressed with their ingredients  type and quality  to cost ratio. Most days  I d just rather go to Chipotle.
Freebirds World Burrito,176,I visited Freebirds for the first time last week and it was amazing   Not only was the burrito tasty and the portion generous  but the service was amazing. The staff is really really accommodating and friendly. They even walk around and ask if your food is good....I haven t really seen other fast food type restaurant employees do that. I also liked the space a lot  esp. because it s a large  open space and patrons can put up event flyers on one of the walls. It s clearly a very popular place and is crowded around meal times. I will definitely visit again soon 
Freebirds World Burrito,177,Well  it s ok...but for a quick bite  I don t mind going here.  I have yet to try Chipoodle to be able to compare.
Freebirds World Burrito,178,This use to be one of those  OMG you live in Austin and you haven t had a Freebird s Burrito  kind of place but as of now  this place is a chain reaching to our far north step-brother-child-of-satan Dallas.  It s still got some good Burrito s and the habanero sauce is a hit-or-miss scenario.  I prefer this over Chipotle because there are more choices and it s closer to home.  It s just about the same price as well.
Freebirds World Burrito,179,I m glad I gave this location another chance.  First time I went it took 20 minutes before I got my food with only 4 people in front of me  and there was easily twice that number working behind the counter.  They were also apathetic and generally unpleasant to be around.  This time they were fast and friendly  so I ll definitely be going back again.
Freebirds World Burrito,180,Freebird s has some quite good burrito s.  I ve moved from Austin to Northern California and while I generally think Texas Mexican food is far superior to NoCal Mexican food  the burrito is one thing NoCal does well.  For that reason I would give Freebirds three stars for being good quality  but not great - but the 4th star is for the fact that you can get a spicy bbq sauce on the burrito.  It s fusion food baby 
Freebirds World Burrito,181,Reading some of the other reviews I couldn t help but agree. I really do want to like freebirds it is just every time I eat there I am not satisfied or disappointed. I guess if OK is what you are looking for then look no further. The people that worked there were very nice as was the general atmosphere.
Freebirds World Burrito,182,Always good and consistent.  I love being able to get queso on my burrito  and the fact that I can actually eat it like a burrito without it exploding and falling apart.
Freebirds World Burrito,183,I lost my appetite in this place. Every employee looks like they had been out all night and just crawled into work. Very unprofessional. Food- below average. I will never eat here again- Id rather go hungry.
Freebirds World Burrito,184,Freebirds is probably the best place to go for a fast  custom burrito  although they have more than burritos . They have a variety of tortillas  my favorites are the wheat and the cayenne   several different sizes  and many many choices. I am a vegetarian and am kind of picky and there are plenty of choices for me here. Also  the staff usually do a good job of mixing the burrito contents so you get a little bit of everything in every bite.  Some things to make sure to try on your burrito  or taco  quesadilla  whatever  - corn salsa  habanero and death sauces  roasted garlic. And  don t forget to get extra salsa from the motorcycle dispenser station.  Also  the pot brownies are great  not healthy  but great.  I have liked this location since I was a graduate student at UT. They have some of the best staff of any freebirds I have been to  on a recent trip  they ran out of habanero sauce right before I was going to get some on my burrito so one of the staff went to the back and made a new batch of it on the spot so I could have some - and delivered it to my table . That wasn t great service  it also confirms how fresh the food is here.
Freebirds World Burrito,185,Horrific. The two times I have gone  the place was filthy. Crusty tables  dirty floor  dirty employees. One time I got a burrito  the other a  bowl . The burrito had brown lettuce and salsa that was on the verge of becoming wine. The bowl also had brown lettuce  and a three inch deep puddle of some sort of liquid at the bottom...and a hair. A short curly one. I think it fell off a filthy employee s bare armpit...or worse.
Freebirds World Burrito,186,Great lunch spot  cool place for people watching... Everybody in Austin seem to converge at Freebird s... Probably not the heathiest food you can consume  but it tastes good and definitely fills you up...
Freebirds World Burrito,187,The offerings at Freebirds lack a bit of a punch in my preference  but it is still consistent and reliable.  Nothing is bad here  but all ingredients are a bit ordinary.  Some pluses are various tortillas flavors and a variety of sizes  the super monster is nice and filling.  The meats are always juicy and tender  but they have no distinct characteristics  whereas Chipotle meat definitely has a zing to it.  Freebirds does have other burrito joints beat in terms of meat texture though.  Other additions such as pico  salsa  and veggies are also mediocre compared to other burrito places as well  but as always  burritos are usually just burritos.
Freebirds World Burrito,188,Lunch on a Friday here should be crazytown  but it wasn t. There was a line  but they keep it moving. Shaggy-haired-UT student-type server was super friendly and fun. He gave me great recommendations. I tried the Freebird Bowl  which I had never had. It was salad-like  but really it was We-Put-Whatever-You-Want-In-A-Bowl. So I had the perfect lunch. I made it spicy  but not too too. Loads of veggies  grilled onions and peppers  lettuce  pico and guac with scrumptiously tender stewed pork.  I left not feeling like I overate and very happy.
Freebirds World Burrito,189,Great burrito  The best part is choice of tortillas available 
Freebirds World Burrito,190,I ordered the steak burrito bowl...I know now that most of what I love about Freebirds is the toritilla. Ditching the tortilla this time left me with tough steak chunks and undercooked onions peppers mix which really harshed my mellow. Although we did take it to go...it was nearly inedible.
Freebirds World Burrito,191,I ve been coming here for years and everything on their menu is delicious. Beats out Chipotle and any other competitor hands down. Try the BBQ sauce with your burrito  its awesome.
Freebirds World Burrito,192,If you like burritos  and you re in Austin  you really should try Freebirds.  Its pretty darn good.   For people who don t like it - well  since you pick all your own ingredients as you go through the line  kind of your own fault     pick better next time   This is a true customizing experience.  Try the queso  its good too.
Freebirds World Burrito,193,I LOVE freebirds.  I love their marinade chicken whether its in a burrito  in tacos  on nachos or in a salad.  I seriously love this food.  There are some awesome people working there too.
Freebirds World Burrito,194,Great burritos. Love the choices in different sizes and between white and dark chicken. This place has queso along with tasty salsas. Try the barbeque sauce on the burrito.
Freebirds World Burrito,195,I like going there for the fun of it. I always end up taking my half of my burrito home. It s to big for me. Very Austin and Very fun. Crowded all the time. Give it a try.
Freebirds World Burrito,196,Sadly  I haven t been to Freebirds in over two years  so I hope things haven t changed  because this is the burrito I am eating when I am dreaming about burritos  no it hasn t happened  but when it does  I know it s Freebirds.  I used to live a block away from Hancock Center  and I was over at Freebirds at least twice a week with my roommate.
Freebirds World Burrito,197,I loved the chicken Burrito. It was great  Just the customer service was terrible. As you enter someone screams at you   NEXT   then it was a guy throwing things in a big tortilla together. He didn t look up once. The cashier was also unhappy. Three stars for the food  but I would give it one star for the customer service. I guess they just have too many people during rush hour. Note to others  the monster burrito will feed three people. It s also a good place to go for free refills and salsa.
Freebirds World Burrito,198,I ve never been to a Freebirds before and stumbled upon this place as I was driving around the neighborhood I m staying in.  It was something that we don t have in the DC area  so I thought I would give it a try.  It was ok  but nothing special.  There just wasn t enough flavor in the burrito and while I know I ordered guacamole and saw the kid squirt it onto the burrito  I never tasted it while eating it.  The kid at the counter was a nice kid and was friendly  but the burrito was just very ordinary.
Freebirds World Burrito,199,Delicious fat burritos  My friend and I ate the  freebird  size burritos  plenty of burrito for one  for cheap  There were so many toppings to choose from and a great staff too  Overall  its a funky  cool  Chipotle replacement 
Freebirds World Burrito,200,Great place.  All the different sizes of burritos are really nice.  The hybrid is just the right size for me and they even have a monster size that is as big as a head.  The people who work there are really friendly and it is really clean.  I really love this place      
Freebirds World Burrito,201,I absolutely love this place. It has its own flavor and I mean more than just the food. Everyone is always willing to help however they can. I ve come here so much they even remember what I get. The carnitas is amazing. The only time I wasn t completely satisfied was when they were out of carnitas. The taco meal is only  5 and fills me up. Comes with chips  salsa  a drink  and two tacos. So good 
Freebirds World Burrito,202,Freebirds is a great place for a huge burrito and surprisingly great soft corn tacos. I m a huge fan of soft corn  especially with the diced chicken breast and hot tomatillo sauce. The staff is friendly and with the exception of lunchtime  you can usually get your food and get out.
Freebirds World Burrito,203,Yum. I especially appreciate the garlic and lime options that you can t find in every burrito shop.
Freebirds World Burrito,204,Freebirds isn t bad  but there are definitely better places in town to get a burrito.. The people who made our burrito were friendly and nice  but I think this chain is over priced for what it is and the salsa is boring.  If you want a huge   6 burrito from a chain  go to Chipotle instead.
Freebirds World Burrito,205,Yeah this place is great. You can get a monster burrito for  8 and share it with a friend. I m 6 ft tall  but I don t wanna be Texas sized. It s plenty.  4 each  for fresh meat  salsas and everything. There s no way to do that at home with so many ingredients. It s fast too. I m not so much into the theme and pierced employees  but they re friendly and stay there a while. If it were a bad place the staff would be gone faster. You should go.
Freebirds World Burrito,206,Cant go wrong with the best burrito company in the business. Unlike Chipotle  they didn t stray from the real burrito recipe. Great job.... actually Im gonna go eat there right now. Thinking about it made me crave it
Freebirds World Burrito,207,Freebirds has been a regular staple of my diet for at least a decade now.  The first one I went to  and the first one in Austin  was on East 41st  so that s the one I m reviewing  but I ve found that most locations are the same.  The ingredients are typically fresh and the hipster waitstaff is always friendly polite.  I prefer the burritos over the bowls.  Fave combo is spanish rice with steak  refried beans  jalapenos  and sour cream  but of course there are thousands of combinations to choose from.  There s also a small kids menu  which my son enjoys.  Recommend.
Freebirds World Burrito,208,If you like burrito only with rice come and eat one here. Burrito full of precooked rice and none of whatever you choose  no flavor... A kid is able to make better burritos. Disgusting for the price. Its worthless..spend your money in something else..
Freebirds World Burrito,209,This is my favorite Freebirds location. Everyone that works there is always very pleasant and the burritos are always awesome  The carnitas is my favorite 
Freebirds World Burrito,210,I got a monster burrito yesterday and ended up with food poisoning. I ve been coming here for years and I get the exact same thing every time - never had a problem. Yesterday I got the burrito and ate half of it for lunch. Within an hour  I made 3 trips to the bathroom and had a horribly upset stomach. Since this had never happened  I just popped about 6 Tums and started feeling better about 4 hours later. Just so I could know for sure it was the freebird that made me sick  I ate the other half for dinner  stupid  I know . Sure enough  by the time I went to bed  my upset stomach was back sevenfold. I emailed them this morning to let them know and they responded basically saying it was my fault I got sick and there s no way their food could ve done it because of the  precautions  they take in preparation and no effort whatsoever to keep my business. Unbelievable lack of customer service  let alone human decency. Never EVER going back again.
Freebirds World Burrito,211,Kinda like Chipotle  but not sure they do the same local organic sourcing. Selection and quality is awesome 
Freebirds World Burrito,212,Awesome  I m not a person who likes a lot of choices when it comes to food  so I ve steered clear of this place and those like it. I ate here today while my car was across the street  and now I know what I ve been missing. I told him  Nachos  no meat  but otherwise make it however you d like it  and it was fantastic  The toppings were fresh  crisp  and LOADED. For  6 and tip  I have lunch for two days.
Freebirds World Burrito,213,You can read about the food in every other review on here... I want to review this particular location because of the PEOPLE. The people who work at the Hancock Freebirds are AWESOME. Seriously  I don t know if it s because they are free to look how they want with no crap uniform  or if it s because they get to pick the music so they are always listening to what puts them in a good mood  or maybe it s part of the job requirement  but I always get amazing service  they make the food exactly how I want it without being pushy  a problem I have at a lot of places where you pick each ingredient of your meal  and sometimes even offer advice. They are even knowledgeable  which I in no way expect because I mean  it s just food service. But no  these guys know the food  they know how it s made and they know how it tastes. I think I go there more often then other places at the shopping center not just for a good quality taco for only  2  but because I know I will get a friendly conversation with my service  instead of the cold mechanical speech of the Jack in the Box employees across the lot. And no creepy people hanging around either 
La Plancha,1,We adore coming to La Plancha  My favorite part about coming is getting to see the owners in their flow and love for their restaurant. Next favorite is La Tejana and if you go this November make sure to try their special of the month because it was    Going after the Mueller Farmers Market on Sunday s is the perfect ritual to get incredibly quality delicious food without the crazy farmers market lines.   If you get a chance don t be shy and sit inside because the vibe is on point.
La Plancha,2,Deeeeeelicious   Not for anyone that is looking to keep their figure slim and trim  it s all comfort food cheat day eats.  The papas fritas are a must order. The queso is also not to be missed  but not necessary to order if you re also getting the fries . I didn t order any tacos or tortas but the ones coming out of the open kitchen looked extremely satisfying.  One counter of inside seating options   some outdoor four tops. More of an ideal spot to grab and go.
La Plancha,3,Such a great addition to the neighborhood   My favorites so far are La Pambazo  the brisket barbacoa quesadilla   and the the vegan taco. They make excellent pico and tomatillo sauces  too.  I want to try a lot more so I will be returning 
La Plancha,4,La Plancha has a super cute outdoor patio  and some inside bar seating for times when it s as chilly as it has been lately. My friend and I split the La Tejana torta  the Papas Fritas  and the Carnitas Taco. As others have said  the tortas here are fabulous--that ended up being my favorite out of the things we tried. The tejana is packed full of really tender  flavorful beef brisket barbacoa  a nice smear of avocado  shredded lettuce  cilantro  and some seriously delicious pickled onions that balanced out the richness of the beef. The papas fritas were super crispy  and I loved the way the cotija cheese and cilantro complimented the fries. Good sauces too  As far as the taco  the corn shell was fabulous  as was the salsa  but I didn t like the pork carnitas as much as the barbacoa. The taco was my friend s favorite though  so my suggestion is to come check this place out and work your way through the menu to find your personal favorites. The owner was really friendly  and obviously puts a lot of love into the food he makes. La Plancha has a fairly central location  and parking was really easy when we went. I m thinking the next items I ll try will probably be the made-from-scratch vegan burger and the papa asada  hurrah for baked potatoes  
La Plancha,5,Bc yelp asked me to edit my July review  without  objectionable terms  toward the Austin majority demographic... My review sans my Chicana perspective   Good but EXPENSIVE.  Food  -  Torta  bread  bolillo  was fantastic. Great texture and flavor. Just don t expect Telera bread torta or size  it s very much a bolillo. - Flavor leans more Tex mex Austiny than Mexi street food  I.e the street corn has queso in it - like for chips  amp  queso . It was alright but not quiet authentic  again  very Austin . - Fries were friggin great  but maybe make a combo option or something     . - Salsa verde was legit. Me encant .  -  Street corn  was alright but  7 for about 1 4 of what you could get at any elote truck here. And it was not authentic street elote by any means.  - Limonda was pretty sour  it almost tasted like powder was used  which I highly doubt. Don t expect agua fresca flavor.  - Chilaquiles Torta was good and tasted as you d expect. - Tejana was yummy. Fillings very Texmex austiny apart from the frijol negro. - Also  don t call a bolillo a torta  maybe   Location  -really nice looking spot -no parking lot but ample parking on the side street next to cemetery - not for dine in  a few seats inside  and a few tables outside. Nice tho  if it s not too hot.  Prices  - just the Tejana w fries was NINETEEN bucks. Like guau. - 1 Tejana Torta  1 Chilaquiles w egg Torta  Fries  Lg Lemonade and elote was FORTY-SEVEN bucks. - We literally heard someone shockingly ask their friend  wait  you spent FORTY bucks here   for just herself  as they came out after ordering. She seemed a little stunned too.      Overall  it was all good and filling. Esp if you feel like just trying something new. If you re cool with paying for the Austiny Instagram experience  come check it out  It was a cute spot and the coffee shop next to it was bomb.
La Plancha,6,Surprisingly good torta. It was warm  tasty  subtle  well put together  flavorful  and just all around good.
La Plancha,7,This place is a great little find  Food is sooo good  staff is friendly  and you get to see your food made in front of you if you sit at the bar. Highly recommend 
La Plancha,8,Excellent tacos  quesadillas and loaded baked potatoes. Staying in the area for nine days and visited multiple times  for breakfast  lunch and light early dinners. Favorites were brisket Barbacoa tacos  and the breakfast ham and egg tacos  Salsas were very tasty. Also  enjoyed getting to know the owners and appreciated efficient and friendly service. They have a good and generous rewards program as well. Definitely will be back when we re in the area.
La Plancha,9,Cute little spot next to the cemetery. This place brags about their Tortas. I concur. This one here is La Tejana w a side of fries. Very delicious. Fries were absolutely perfect.
La Plancha,10,Hands down the best sandwich in Austin. Maybe one of the best sandwiches ive ever had. Every detail is perfect all the way down to the perfectly crispy fries.
La Plancha,11,This place was definitely worth the 30 minute drive  I had the Three Little Pigs Torta and my husband had the La Tejana Torta. Mine was definitely the winner  though my husband thinks his was haha  I m a sweet person  so after we finished the oh so delicious sandwiches  I ordered the churritos  5 churros with Cajeta on the side  and WOW  So good  We don t live in the area  but will absolutely be making the trek to return    We only had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners  Julian  but he was so nice and welcoming  He chatted us up during our sit down at the counter and told us some other restaurant recommendations. Very sweet     Overall  we really recommend this place   
La Plancha,12,Great tortas  Very nice costumer service  awesome location with good parking. I really recommend this place if you re looking for some good antojitos Mexicanos 
La Plancha,13,You must go and visit this place.  The tortas are delicious.  Tacos are amazing.  Quesadilla are great.  Make sure to try the guacamole with everything.    Mexican food is not my wife s first choice when we get food.  She loved the La Three Little Pigs tortas and the chips.    Mariha is the chef owner and creates such tasty food using family recipes.  Everything is made in house including the chorizo  carnitas and barbacoa.  There is a small counter inside and the tables outside.  Get there before everyone finds out how amazing it is and it is gets busy.
La Plancha,14,I just ordered the first sandwich in the menu and fries. One of the best meals I ve ever had. The sandwich is the perfect blend of textures and flavors. The fries have a unique crisp that I ve never experienced before. Do not miss this place.
La Plancha,15,I was in Austin and I m so thankful I came across this jewel -  La Plancha   I m always looking for restaurants where the Chef s run the show. Why  Because the Chef s are the most spirited and passionate about the ingredients and flavor of the food.   If you want big flavor and top tier ingredients...eat at La Plancha. You will not be disappointed. Place is clean and food is cooked right in front of you.   I came with a big group  so I had the opportunity to taste almost everything on the menu. We  All  left happy.   We will be back    Note  Only one regret - Houston does not have a La Plancha
La Plancha,16,La Plancha  I wanted to order everything  No matter what you order make sure to get the fries Best fries I ve ever had  And of course pair it with a cold Mexican coke.
La Plancha,17,We had brisket tacos and a brisket torta. Both were very flavorful and moist. The cilantro and lime provided great flavor. The service was great and the employees were very friendly. We enjoyed our lunch outside as the weather was nice. I highly recommend this new establishment.
La Plancha,18,Incredible tortas and definitely get the papas. Will return to try more of the menu soon 
La Plancha,19,INCREDIBLE authentic food made from scratch by experienced chefs. Expect a fast-casual counter-service concept inspired by Mexican street food. Proudly serving family recipes in a modern-casual atmosphere. Your absolutely missing out on a memorable experience by sharing Mexican street food-inspired dishes and drinks.
La Plancha,20,Such tasty food. The fries were so yum. Highly recommend trying this place out    Can t wait to go back   
La Plancha,21,This place is amazing. The tortas and tacos are delicious  the bread really makes it . I highly recommend the chilaquiles torta  which is only sold on the weekends or for breakfast. You will not be disappointed.
La Plancha,22,Fucking bomb. Definitely coming back. I got the most popular sandwich with fries and those pickles they give you are to die for
La Plancha,23,Loved this place  I had the La Tejana torta and it was so good  The bread and meat is so important to me when it comes to a good torta and both were on point. I also tried the papas fritas that came with cotija cheese  cilantro  and jalape o ranch all great They have agua de limon  frescas  that was so good. Peeps that went with me had the Pambazo  chorizo  potato egg  and the baked potato with meat and toppings. I didn t take pics but go see for yourself you wont regret it. Good salsas
La Plancha,24,We were in town for a competition at UT and were craving some Mexican food. This place did NOT disappoint  Between the excellent service  inviting atmosphere and AMAZING tortas  we will definitely be coming back here again when we are back in the Austin area. All 4 people in my family got different tortas  and all were AMAZING  Plus  the pickled veggies are home picked and pickled  and to die for. A must eat place for our family 
La Plancha,25,Searched for Tex-Mex and came up with La Plancha-  the grill . Maria took our order and let us know she and her husband met in Austin  married and 6 years later had this baby   Both worked at  luxury dining and boy does it show   Food is delicious- I had chicken taco on flour tortilla   5 . Chicken so tender and spices with lime- perfection.  Take out or sit at small bar or outside- you will not be dissatisfied 
La Plancha,26,This place was fantastic  The bread they use is great and the portions are ridiculous. The crinkle cuts are super crispy and well spiced  and their salsas are delicious  Staff is super friendly and personable. Space is small but not cramped  definitely feels inviting. Great location as well. Get there now 
La Plancha,27,Normally I do not deviate from traditional style tortas or elote but seeing how hard it is to find a good one  I dragged my husband from Round Rock to East Austin to try this place. I was surprisingly amazed  The bread is on point and the ingredients were great quality. This was the first time I tried hot cheetos on my elote and 10 out 10 would recommend along with the Tejana and don t sleep on the Papa Asada
La Plancha,28,Amazing family owned establishment  Great people great food  a nice mix of traditional Mexican cuisine and modern street food. Highly recommended  
La Plancha,29,Bueno Torta     I got  La Hot Chick . I want to try the other Tortas but it s going to be hard not to get the hot chick again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,1,This is the original el arroyo. If you are new to Texas el arroyo is known best for its witty and funny marquee sign. They have several locations throughout Texas that serve good food along with a great atmosphere.   Me and my brother went to try it and honestly  it was average at best. The waiter initially heard our order wrong but got it right the second time. We had to flag him down a couple of times for a refill on our drinks. The d cor was cute and the AC was on full blast  which is a welcome sign after being out in the hot Texas sun. The food needed salt but it was good  average at best. I think my brother got the platter and he said he liked it  i got something else and like i said it was average at best. Oh  parking can be tricky  i had to circle the block once to find a spot to park. I been to one of their locations in Arlington  Tx and that location had its food be more flavorful than this location.   This place is good for Tex-Mex and drinks after work with friends vibes. The chips and salsa are free  as they should lol  and the chips have a good crunch and saltiness to them.   I probably would not go back out to eat here but would be back to take a picture with their marquee sign.
El Arroyo 5th Street,2,So I ve been to this restaurant a few times since it s a block away from work. Everytime I get there  it s like I m invisible to the waitresses. .  It s kind of obvious the reason for that is that I m hispanic and come in my working clothes   cause there s only 4 tables other than mine. I guess they thought I wouldn t tip enough and value good service.  There is this guy with a beard who s really diligent and nice  but he s not a waiter.  HEADS UP - wear a suit or a taxeedo if you want some service  it will make them believe you ll tip big.  Fun fact  I m writing this review  sitting at my table for 15 minutes and neither of the three waitresses has checked on me.  Food is good but  unfortunately  this particular location could really benefit from better service.
El Arroyo 5th Street,3,Been coming here so long I almost take it for granted.  Known across the internet for their meme-like signage  they are also known for kick ass food. The ultimate in Tex-Mex flavor 
El Arroyo 5th Street,4,Food  5 5 We ordered the El Arroyo Special  Chicken Enchiladas  Queso  and Margaritas. Everything was fantastic Tex Mex for the price - you really can t beat it    Service  3 5 We never had to wait to have our drinks refilled  but we had to wait with food on the table for about 10 minutes before we received silverware.   Environment  4 5 Great location to start the night off at  but the restaurant could have been cleaner.
El Arroyo 5th Street,5,Our server Rico was absolutely wonderful  He brought an incredibly energy to the table and brought out wonderful food  Definitely a go to when visiting Austin. Sign was great too and is pretty iconic. 10 10 overall 
El Arroyo 5th Street,6,I can t believe how far I went out of my way to eat dinner at El Arroyo. I ve been seeing this place because of their super hilarious message board and so I knew I had to visit. But wow  I went out of my way   The Tex Mex as pretty good. I started off with the complimentary chips and salsa. A couple of warm chips with salt were great and the salsa wasn t too wet so that I wasn t dropping it all over myself.  I had a  Skinny Margarita  with only a single shot. I still have to drive later and two shots of tequila would not be wise. It was tasty with a great tart flavor and of course  the salted rim. As the ice cubes slowly melted  I ended up with a completely empty glass. Yum.  For main course  I chose the Steak Ranchero. I delicious lime-marinated steak with their ranchero sauce and this is where my keto diet went bye-bye. I did eat the rice and beans because they were just so good. Rice was firm but fresh and the beans had a great rich flavor. Dang it   Great service in a not-too-busy restaurant with good food. I would definitely recommend El Arroyo    Review 17395 overall - 410 in Texas - 913 of 2022. 
El Arroyo 5th Street,7,Ok  so the sign is legendary in itself  Met my cousins here for lunch and food was good. Queso was bomb and my chimichanga was pretty good. Salsa was great and service was good too.
El Arroyo 5th Street,8,WOW  Had a friend come in from out of town and demand we eat hear. I cannot believe I waited this long. The food was excellent. The margaritas were excellent. Servers were fun and friendly. The only down side is parking. The parking lot is crazy small and extremely difficult to navigate. Be prepared. Otherwise enjoy 
El Arroyo 5th Street,9,The signs are iconic and funny - the food and service are  Myeh .   If this restaurant would team up with Enchiladas Y Mas   a small  moderately priced restaurant on Anderson Rd. that s KILLING it on food and service   they could have it all. El Arroyo has the location and the reputation  but the important stuff needs work.
El Arroyo 5th Street,10,I m on day two of eating a gigantic burrito at El Arroyo and I m not regretting any of it.    Of course El Arroyo is best known for its constantly changing sign outside which was inspired a cottage industry of El Arroyo sign related sales.  And usually  if a restaurant has a niche completely unrelated to its food  you can surmise that the food itself is going to suck.   And you would be wrong.    The gigantic burrito I ordered isn t going to confuse an Austinite as great Mexican food  but it s also not going to confuse anyone as to what constitutes good cheap food at a very reasonable price.  The fifteen dollar burrito I ordered would feed two grown adults easily.    And the food tasted fine.  The rice wasn t hard and inedible  the beans weren t dry  the fajita meat was tasty  and the sauces added flavor to this burrito.  If El Arroyo is convenient to you  I was across the street on this trip to Austin    then it s fine to have some reasonably tasty Tex-Mex at a decent price.  Add in the nostalgia factor and you have four perfectly red Yelp stars.
El Arroyo 5th Street,11,This place meets all expectations.  We came as a pit stop during a long bike ride through the city. It was hot  but they were accommodating and gave us plenty of ice water while we waited for a table.  The kitschy fun atmosphere combined with the unusual restaurant design and an element of fun that tied well with their very successful marketing.  Seated between some hipsters on one side and longhorn football players on the other we fit in just fine   The food was delicious  we had tacos and queso. The margaritas were so good we had to get a second round.  Well worth the stop 
El Arroyo 5th Street,12,There is a sort of nostalgia about eating here in support of the almighty   and very well known  sign out front. Aside from getting that gram pict  the restaurant is worth checking out. Its not blow-your-socks off great  but its not bad either. I had the fried shrimp tacos and they were exactly what I hoped they would be. My fianc  and brother-in-law ordered beef fajitas and my sis ordered the al pastor burrito. The fajitas were decent. Sis thought the al pastor was a bit dry inside. It is worth mentioning though that the service was beyond amazing. Despite being a busy Saturday  our server DJ was right on top of everything the whole time.
El Arroyo 5th Street,13,Good Austin tex-mex. Went yesterday with my boyfriend and ordered a frozen margarita and Del Mar enchilada s with rice and beans. The margarita was decent  as expected. The chips are thick in texture and salty with medium spicy salsa.   I was so hungry when the food came I completely forgot to take pictures but  it was totally good. It has shrimp and other seafood in it. It s a very creamy  heavy dish but  was obviously delicious.   Another table at the restaurant had ordered a similar looking dish to mine and a different waiter gave them mine on accident  they liked it anyway-- so that should attest to how good the dish is . The waiter let us know and gave us some extra chips while we waited and overall the service was good    The only reason for the 4 stars was because the bathroom wasn t very clean. Overall  the food is good and drinks are good for what you would expect of Tex-mex and I will definitely return.
El Arroyo 5th Street,14,Came here in a Friday night early and was surprised that there were still seats available. We had a party of 7 and they sat two of us before the rest arrived. Parking is a bear   I went round and round until I found a spot that was probably a spot  Busy intersection and lots of impatient drivers. Our server was outstanding  very friendly and outgoing. The chips were fresh and warm and the salsa was loaded with flavor. Their beer selection was substandard  especially with so many Austin breweries around.  Since it was Friday during lent  I had a non meat dish. I ordered the chile rellenos with shrimp. It was fantastic  Great flavor  not a lot of heat and loaded with shrimp. The rice was excellent as well as the beans. Everyone else had good meals as well. We will definitely be back
El Arroyo 5th Street,15,This legendary place is well worth the visit for the experience.  The food is good and the service is good as well.  If El Arroyo is really busy  the service may be slow  so be patient.  The clever sayings on the marquee legendary and known throughout the US.  Truly worth a visit.
El Arroyo 5th Street,16,Love it  Can t wait to visit again    Service was above and beyond as they tracked down an allergy concern to the people who prepare their chips    THANKS to the amazing staff who helped us 
El Arroyo 5th Street,17,By far the best Tex-Mex in Austin We ordered the nachos and tacos and ate at the bar.  Great service and excellent food
El Arroyo 5th Street,18,The food is as excellent as their signs  Very relaxed atmosphere with friendly and fast service.  The presentation of the food ramped up the appetite. The 5th street Tacos were delicious. Definitely worth the visit.
El Arroyo 5th Street,19,With as many Tex-Mex places in austin  the food was okay. I think people just come here just because the sign.
El Arroyo 5th Street,20,When I m Austin  or just when off for the day  El Arroyo is a must stop   Back in College we were regulars and now we get here whenever we can.  Totally worth fighting the crazy Austin traffic.  Parking is a challenge so prepare accordingly.  They now have lots of patio seating which is so nice   Enchiladas Del Mar is my usual go to  but decided on the flautas instead.  They didn t disappoint   So good   Margaritas left me underwhelmed so switched to my usual XX   Definitely stop in and have a bite  you won t regret it 
El Arroyo 5th Street,21,The signs may be funny  but please spare yourself and do not eat here. The staff is friendly and it s a cute spot  but the food is horrendous. Something as simple as queso was inedible and we had to send it back. Probably the worst food I ve ever had in my entire life.
El Arroyo 5th Street,22,Food is okay. Cute outdoor patio  a great place for a low-key date night. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup  it comes with a generous amount of chicken and a cute red taco shell on the side filled with cheese and avocado. The soup was good and big portion  and I appreciate they let me decide how much cheese I want to add to the soup. But sadly  their chips  I know it is free  are not freshly made at the restaurant  they come from a big generic store-bought bag  they are thick and not special.
El Arroyo 5th Street,23,Good was good and drinks were good. We ordered guac and queso and never received the guac  but the burrito  fajita combo and enchiladas were all delicious. The vibe was cool and we sat outside with fans on. It was not too bad  but the fans kept blowing everything around Including napkins and utensils.
El Arroyo 5th Street,24,Great food. Great service. Great sign messages. No pretense. All goodness. Get the queso and the fajitas.
El Arroyo 5th Street,25,I like big beefy enchiladas  I can not lie.  This place delivers on quantity.   The enchiladas trio has some of the most meat filled enchiladas I have seen in along time.  Each are about 2 inches in diameter.  Just huge.  Seasoned really good.  Sure wish they had topped it with onions.   Their Bob-chiladas are different and delicious.  Now their appetizer trio is okay not a bell ringer but its simple and good. Their Green Salas is very different sort of sweet and tangy. This place has been an Austin institution since 1975.  The restaurant is even mentioned in a Pat Green song.  Inside seating is very limited but they do have outside seating.  Very nice wait staff.  Its super casual.  Super laid back.  I wish I could give them 3.5 on this app.
El Arroyo 5th Street,26,A great lunch on the patio. Large portions and quick service   Friendly waitstaff and fun vibes.
El Arroyo 5th Street,27,Not only does this place provide a great signage daily but the margaritas are super delicious   The food is amazing  as well.  We love the ambiance.  The parking is hit or miss  pending the time of day you go.  We love sitting outside when the weather is nice however if it s hot or raining  the dining room is relaxing and cool.  Staff are super kind   We love that we don t have to wait too long for the food to come out.  It s perfect during lunch if your time is limited.  I would highly recommend this venue.
El Arroyo 5th Street,28,Emily and Marisol are the best. The service is always extremely fast  and the margaritas are tasty as well. Definitely want to take advantage of their  2 margarita Thursday happy hour. I have ordered the Diablo shrimp which are incredibly yummy. I ve had the fajitas which cone out fresh and plentiful. Most recently  I tried the Diablo fries. It was pure deliciousness. If you re looking for sone decent Tex Mex at extremely reasonable prices downtown  than this is the place.
El Arroyo 5th Street,29,I was honestly really hesitant about eating here due to the poor reviews  however I was with a local Austin native who insisted we eat brunch here. I was not disappointed at all. I had the huevos divorciados  the green salsa is soooo incredible   I enjoyed it
El Arroyo 5th Street,30,Have you seen their signs        They r hilarious   Speaking of signs....  A rabbi  a priest  and an imam stand on the side of the road holding signs saying  the end is near .  A truck drives by and the driver shouts  you dumb religious wackos   makes the turn and drives off the cliff. The rabbi turns to the priest and imam and says  you think we should change our signs    Anyway  since 1975  El Arroyo has been serving up Tex-Mex with a side of laughs on their marquee sign that stands on the corner of West 5th and Campbell in Austin  Texas.  They say they are  The Last Queso Stop Before a Bunch of Yoga Studios.   Some of my favs include....  Ceviche Which fish marinated in lime juice with pico de gallo and avocado.  Cabo Crab Rolls Flour tortillas stuffed with blue grab  cream cheese and mushrooms. Served with jalape o jelly.  Baja Fish Tacos Grilled or breaded tilapia with pineapple slaw  habanero aioli and creamy jalape o sauces.  Enchiladas Del Mar Blue crab and shrimp in a cream cheese blend with poblano shrimp sauce.  You will amor it   Knock  knock Who s there  Nacho Nacho who  I m nacho momma   Q. What do Mexican clocks say  A. Tick taco
El Arroyo 5th Street,31,Come for the sign stay for the food.  This place so dope I m making this review before I even finish my food.  Great staff super friendly and helpful.  The salsa was delicious.  Most definitely come through and check this place out.
El Arroyo 5th Street,32,My wife and I have committed to start to visit some of the ATX icons that have been here for what seams like forever....shocked to see some of the reviews of this place...considering the struggles some of these joints are recovering from I could see the facts on the service being not what people are looking for....But.... El Arroyo didnt let us down in anyway....Super friendly service from John  along with other team members checking in on us. Chips and Salsa hit the table promptly...along with Queso....Salsa was kickin good  with a great little punch of heat....spoonful in the Queso took it to the next level...Water and Chips Never went empty...Wife went with Beef Enchiladas topped with Red Chile Sauce...Beef ended up being Beef Fajita...Tender and Tasty....Double Rice....Fresh and Lite....Now I will say  they claim the Red Chile sauce is Spicy...mmmm...not so much for us...but then again most of our taste buds are dead...but it Did have great flavor....ask for a small sample if your hesitant...There menu is odd and different from those we have visited  150  Mex-Tex Mex under our belt  which make me excited...The Sante Fe caught my eye...why ...the egg on top...Chicken  They use whole bird  and the Red Chile Sauce....Amazing Combo ....Such a great visit and we will be back...There are a few other menu items that caught my eye..
El Arroyo 5th Street,33,Quite sure I got food poisoning from here.   They re clearly more known for their quotable sign posts than their food  except that it s bad.   We chose to sit outside  and were sat at a very wobbly table. Our server was nice but not very knowledgeable  like whether they had perfect margaritas  or really any kind of margarita .   We were pretty flush with chips and salsa  and they were as much as you d expect but not worth it given the rest of the experience.   I ordered the shrimp enchiladas  and it was the biggest ordering mistake at a restaurant I ve ever made. I ve never gotten food poisoning from a restaurant before  and at first I thought it was the gluten from the flour tortillas which were irritating my stomach  but after an hour or two  it felt like an Alien was trying to birth out of my belly. Although that would have been a crazy story that I unfortunately wouldn t have been able to live through to tell  it was not pleasant at all  and I spent the night in agony from it  and the next day recovering  which also made me have to cancel my river floating plans        Very disappointed and definitely will not go again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,34,Best Beef fajita I had in the last 20 years    Great service    Love Austin perfect place to be with family
El Arroyo 5th Street,35,Great dive Mexican Spot   Known for a witty sign that will put a smile on most people s face   It has a large patio. The vibe is definitely divey but enjoyed my food and drinks. Can t beat 4 dollar beers and 7 dollar margs. Loved my Queso Fumedo. It s a very robust queso fundido served with tortillas. The house chips and salsa is good but definitely has a little kick.   I would stop back for sure.
El Arroyo 5th Street,36,I ve always been a fan of El Arroyo. Whether it s a post downtown party night Sunday brunch or an after work happy hour  El Arroyo always offers great queso and frozen drinks.  On this occasion  we went at lunchtime on a Thursday. Upon arrival  the place wasn t very busy and we were immediately given a table. Within a few minutes we had waters  chips  and salsa. At this point  the tables are filling up and it s getting a little more busy. It seemed like we waited at least 15 minutes before our waitress arrived. She was friendly she took our drink orders. I asked for a queso as well. A round of margarita on the rocks and queso came quickly. Another waitress came around to refill the salsa and waters. The drinks were cheap and potent  but not really as good as I remember. Maybe because there didn t seem to be a lot of ice in them. Our waitress didn t come back until we were completely done with drinks and queso. She asked how we were doing and we asked if we could order. At this point  it s been over an hour and we had filled up on queso and margaritas. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were tasty  but nothing spectacular.   Overall  the food was ok  the queso and their peppery salsa were the stars  and the drinks were so-so.   As much as I love to check their marquee  I m probably not going to miss the food. I definitely won t miss the service.
El Arroyo 5th Street,37,Funny quotes on the outside  great food in the inside. If ever a chilly day there tortilla soup flavorful and tasty   Along with everything else
El Arroyo 5th Street,38,Good TexMex and great location. We all enjoyed our meals. Servings are large and we couldn t finish. The restaurant itself has a great patio and plenty of parking. Chips and salsa very good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,39,This place is iconic for the sign so I m glad I went  but I probably will not be back.  The chips and salsa was just okay.   What I ordered  I had the fish tacos. They were normal. The rice that came with it was a little dry.   We sat outside and it was a little dirty.   Overall it was cool to go  but I will probably not go back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,40,Come for the sign  avoid the establishment. Food is not good and service was very slow  despite the restaurant being pretty empty.
El Arroyo 5th Street,41,Great patio  friendly staff  good chips salsa and food consistently.  I can t speak to the inside because I always enjoy the outside area.  Service can be slow but I think it has a lot to do with covid.
El Arroyo 5th Street,42,The service was fast and great   The food was delicious  I m stuffed and satisfied. Highly recommend 
El Arroyo 5th Street,43,This place is pretty much what I expected. Their infamous sign is indeed there in the parking lot for anyone coming to see it  and their food and service are mediocre.  I came for dinner with a friend on a Friday night. The place was busy  but they got us seated pretty quickly at the only available inside table. To start  we built our own queso with jalapenos  guac  and mushrooms. For entrees  my friend  who is vegetarian  ordered the chile relleno  and I had the cancun avocado with beef fajitas  the beef was a last minute addition because the fajitas at the table next to us smelled sooo yummy . We also tried the signature margarita  the skinny margarita  and a couple Rosa Ritas. Overall  the food was not bad but was also nothing special. The queso tasted like something I could make myself with a microwave and some Velveeta cheese  our entrees  when they finally made it to our table  were average  and my friend did report some GI discomfort the next day   and  while the signature and skinny margaritas weren t great  we did enjoy the Rosa Ritas.  All and all  I d probably bring my out-of-town visitors who want to see their infamous sign in person but will otherwise not be back for the food or the service.
El Arroyo 5th Street,44,First off  the food I got here was delicious. This review is definitely not a reflection of the tasty Tex Mex offered at this restaurant. Rather  the exceptionally poor service. I know times are tough with COVID. I know things can t always go smoothly. My hope is that they will make the necessary corrections and improve. My experience is with their  To-Go  service and is as follows   I made a  To-Go  order online and received a confirmation text message. I arrived at El Arroyo to pick up my order at the selected time. They were very busy. I was unsure where to go in order to collect my food. I stopped one of waiters near the bar to ask. He said  Right here  and asked for my name. After assisting some patrons at tables nearby  he went to the computer next to the bar. I followed him. After a minute or so  he asked if I had a confirmation of the order on my phone. I said yes  and handed him my phone with a screenshot containing all the info including order number. He looked at my phone and began poking at the computer touch screen. He handed the phone back to me wordlessly and walked away. I had no idea what was happening with my food or what I was expected to do. I decided to stand near the bar and try to stay out of the way. After 20 minutes of standing there I approached a waitress to inquire after my food. The waitress asked if I wanted to put in an order. As I was explaining my situation the original waiter joined us and said  I already put the order in  and left again. At this point I realized there was definitely an issue with my  TO-GO  order. I asked the waitress if I should come back later for my food. She responded with  Yes  it should be ready in about 10 minutes . I left the building and went to my car. After killing another 15 minutes I went back inside. As I approached the bar  the waiter spotted me and pointed to a bag on the counter. I went over to it and looked inside. I could see right away my drink was missing. I cornered the waiter and asked if my drink was in the bag somewhere. He responded by asking what I had ordered to drink. I told him and he shuffled away. He returned carrying a drink and handed it to me. After gruffly explaining I was not allowed to open it until exiting the property  took off again without a word. I called after him  Thanks   But I doubt he heard me.  In conclusion  this experience was disappointing on two points. First  the El Arroyo  To-Go  system needs serious improvement. My order was not even close to being ready when I arrived to get it. Second  the El Arroyo staff needs to communicate better with customers. They should have explained on arrival there was a delay with my  To-Go  order. I did not appreciate needlessly standing around for so long.   To add insult to injury  The tortillas were missing from my order. Boo.
El Arroyo 5th Street,45,I came here after finding the recommendation off Pinterest. I wanted to eat good Mexican food and I am so glad I came here  The food was great  I wish I lived in Austin to go back often. I would definitely recommend it    To anyone  I thought the sign would be funnier when I went but i enjoyed reading  all the stuff inside that they sell with their signs.
El Arroyo 5th Street,46,I m a newer Austinite and hadn t been to El Arroyo yet but always wanted to try it out. My two girlfriends and I stopped in at 6pm on a Thursday. Name on list and waited on the patio  there was no option to wait at the bar and we couldn t get drinks while we waited. Our 20 minute wait was actually 45 minutes and once we were seated we waited another 20 minutes for a server  who brought our drinks quickly but forgot our queso.  We were in the main dining room. It was quite loud. I think the patio looked nicer but it was hot out so AC was good too. The food we got was good  I had the rolled tacos and they were a little salty but the portion was good and I enjoyed it. My gfs got a quesadilla and tacos and both looked happy with their orders.  Overall  I liked the experience of getting to see an iconic place in real life but I don t think it s really a stand out for cuisine in Austin.
El Arroyo 5th Street,47,Austin Natives and this was a place we had yet to visit. Cinco De Mayo  we figured we would try this spot that s so well known for their signs...  Service was terrible . . . Chips and Salsa were terrible. . . .  Food  queso flamado   beef fajitas - street tacos  rice   charro beans  ... Terrible . . . Mexican Martini -- this was on point and was really good.  . . . Waiter was pretty non-existent  so much so we almost left with out paying .. Waiting 45 min for him to come out so we could pay the check.   But definitely not coming back.    I m surprised this place has lasted as long as it has.
El Arroyo 5th Street,48,I liked it  We were searching for a place with a short wait  and ended up here. The food was great  fast service  and clean. We had margaritas  queso  fajitas  and enchiladas. Everything was tasty   I feel really back for everyone who had a terrible experience.....ours was great 
El Arroyo 5th Street,49,We had quick and attentive service which was a plus  however  I had some mishaps in my food. I had ordered chicken enchiladas without cheese but had received cheese enchiladas smothered in cheese. We didn t send it back since the worker was new. The new worker was incredibly nice though  I hope the worker is doing well and enjoying it because I had a great experience service-wise. The food on the other hand  regardless of the cheese  was average.
El Arroyo 5th Street,50,Went here on my trip to Austin  Absolutely loved it. The service was incredible and the food was great  The enchiladas reminded me of how i make them with my homemade sauce. Also the avocado salsa tasted like it was freshly made. The guac was so fresh and yummy  Loved it all  Highly recommend
El Arroyo 5th Street,51,I follow them on Instagram for their funny signs so I thought I would stop by. Gf likes Tex Mex but I don t care for it so she was much more excited than I was. Inside is small but there are plenty of outside seating. Started off with chips and salsa while looking through the menu. Once we decided we waited to be served. And waited. Pretty sure we were forgotten because I had to walk up and ask for a waiter. On weekends they have a brunch menu and I decided on the 2 breakfast taco platter with potatoes and beans. It wasn t good or bad but I had a hard time trying to eat with the bugs flying around. I think I prefer their merchandise over their food and service. We both didn t finish our plate but she did like and finish the margarita.
El Arroyo 5th Street,52,Okay so the signs are so funny  And I would recommend walking or driving by the place for that  But the food isn t good at all. Way better Texmex places in austin.
El Arroyo 5th Street,53,we just moved to central Texas and we re bopping  around Austin looking for a place to eat. And there it was   I have been using their sayings in their signs on social media for years. we had to try it. really good Tex Mex food. the place looks dive-y but is was clean and had prompt friendly service.  grilled shrimp tacos were totally on point and the pinto beans were superb.  cancun Avocado was unique and delish. For a place world famous for its sign the food was surprisingly good. I would come back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,54,Disappointing experience from start to finish. The staff actually really doesn t care about you or your experience. We got in a waiting list  even though there were plenty of places to sit  and kept coming back when they told us  but when we did they would say they re still not ready. When we finally got seated  they gave us what they claimed to be margaritas  but it was truly one of the worst drinks I had ever had in my life and they wouldn t let us trade it for something else. They just claimed  no refunds on alcohol.  The food was okay at best. I used to think they were really cool because of their sign  but at this point I think it s the only reason they re staying afloat.
El Arroyo 5th Street,55,My husband and I thought we had lost our taste for Mexican food.  We found our love back at El Arroyo  The combo fajitas were tremendous as well as the rice and beans. My only complaint would be that I wish they had put more alcohol in my well drink  it was pretty weak.
El Arroyo 5th Street,56,My family came here for lunch and we had a big party. First the manager acted like he didn t want to seat us  then when he did some of us had to sit at another table not close by. They got orders wrong  food was not good. The portion of our family who did not sit with us were told by the waiter that he ll  get to them when he sets to them.  Very unprofessional  When the bill came  they refused to separate the ticket and also added an extremely large amount of gratuity. Also  some items that were ordered incorrectly showed up on the bill which we had to address. Once the bill was finally corrected and paid we left  just to have a charge on the card for MORE than the original bill  I wouldn t recommend this place to anybody  Food  bad  Service  horrible  Please do not waste your time or a dime in this place    
El Arroyo 5th Street,57,Quality Tex-Mex. Great setting. The message board out front is legendary. The stuffed poblano is the best in town.
El Arroyo 5th Street,58,We came here for my bday and they literally gave me and my family attitude and they gave me the wrong order.  The waiter was asking me  what do you want me to do we are busy  I told him first of all don t give me attitude to start off.   And that boiled my blood.   Horrible service  I don t even know why they are open.
El Arroyo 5th Street,59,Take a pic of the sign and go else where. Over priced  and terrible.  The nachos were thin  and cold and 15 dollars for 5 pieces.  The Mexican martini was bitter  small  and heavy on the olive flavor. Wouldn t have had a second even if the waiter offered   which he didn t - rarely came to the table   The burrito was massive in both size and disappointment.   I ve never been more upset at the waste of money an experience has been.
El Arroyo 5th Street,60,I loved it  Not just a cool photo op but delicious food  The queso was amazing and so was my beef fajita meal  Would Recommend 
El Arroyo 5th Street,61,Not sure what happened to this place. It was great years ago  however I have been to this place twice and it has not been so great. Staff were very attentive  but the quality of food was disappointing. Chips were stale  guacamole was browned  chicken chulapas we re beaned out...where the chicken  And what about the plate does not come with rice and beans 
El Arroyo 5th Street,62,Literally the worst service and food ever. This place is really cute and all with the sign and shit but just know that that s how the stay open. without that  this place would go under immediately due to the absolutely tragic service and extremely poor quality food drinks. Please just skip dining here for your own sake I promise. no need to actually go  you can follow them on Instagram for the sign.
El Arroyo 5th Street,63,Wow   The only good thing about this restaurant  is their world-renowned sign.     and  that s 2 of the 3 stars  here    Lived in Austin  since 1984.  Been here a handful of times  over the years  as it served as a meeting place for something else - now  I remember why so many years pass between visits.   Just because something is  classic  or  old school  doesn t make it worthwhile.   Death knell can t be a long way off.    Austin has grown changed evolved a lot since I ve been here  and not always for the better - this place needs to go.    Tear down.  Rebuild.  Revamp.  But  Keep the sign.
El Arroyo 5th Street,64,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE     I was eager to try this spot since its such a famous austin restaurant.  I sat right in front of there area where they get there chips and drinks and for more an 30 minutes I was not acknowledged at all  Not even a  i ll be right with you . I counter a total of 5 waiters servers and not one acknowledge me.  There were only 3 parties dining in and I was one of those 3. Yet they were being attended instantly. The 5 waiters servers were going back and forth to the two other tables  literally walking by my party to get from the two other parties.   WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS RESTAURANT  Huge disappointment as I was eager to dine in as my last name is  ARROYO .  Thanks for the horrible discriminatory service.
El Arroyo 5th Street,65,This was the worse experience at a Mexican restaurant I ve ever had. If you are Hispanic and know what Mexican or even Tex-Mex food should taste like  do yourself the favor and skip this god awful poor excuse for Mexican food.   The food was bland  the special burrito was far from special  the tacos Al Pastor bland  tortillas weren t even toasted just soggy . The margarita was  6.50 for a tiny glass full of ice and sour mix.   Then to drive this horrible experience home  the waiter was awful. Just awful service and complete lack of consideration for any of the patrons that were sitting on the patio. It started to rain  and they kept bringing food out to the tables even though the customers were standing by the tables hoping to be moved  as everything was sopping wet. Our waiter refused to acknowledge us more than twice  no touching tables at all   and when he did he was so stand-offish that we felt uncomfortable ordering anything else  not like it was worth it  so maybe he did us a favor .  The bathrooms were gross  I had to clean my own toilet to be able to use it.  The only nice part of this was the lady busing the tables who was very courteous and friendly when she notices us trying to get the waiters attention and instead helped us.    45 dollars that we could ve spent elsewhere.  Follow them on IG for their sign quips  but other than that this is the biggest whitewashed Joke of Austin.   sorrynotsorry
El Arroyo 5th Street,66,Bad food and terrible service. We waited for 20 minutes for a host to even let us know how long the wait was and then did not even come serve us until a long time later. and then they didn t even come to top up the water a single time in the entire hour and a half we were there. Absolutely do not recommend unless you just want to have your night ruined
El Arroyo 5th Street,67,Terrible service.  I have wanted to go here for awhile  but never had the time during the work day   Today I decided to give it a shot  big mistake.  They have a sign that says  wait for host to seat you  with no host on duty.  Both myself  and two other families stood there aimlessly for over 30 minutes  while a server kept walking by and saying  oh ill be right with you all  and then would proceed to go hit his vape pen on the patio and ignore the people standing in the sun waiting JUST TO BE SEATED.  After 30 minutes standing in the sun and trying to be patient I decided to get taco bell because they will actually get you through the line.  This place can burn down for all I care.  Never again
El Arroyo 5th Street,68,Always dug this spot. They re famous for their sign out front but they have solid food and a cool vibe on the patio. Their breakfast tacos are really good  probably what they re best known for. But their BBQ enchiladas are really good too. Highly recommend this place as a chill lunch spot with a patio.
El Arroyo 5th Street,69,This is my favorite place to go for frozen margaritas. The food isn t great but i m more of a chips and salsa and margs type of person so this is a great place. Go on Thursdays for  2 margs all day and bring a card game to sit outside and enjoy 
El Arroyo 5th Street,70,We went here because we heard good things about the margs and loved their funny signs. Their little sign books are the only redeeming quality they have. It started off right away on a terrible foot. We parked in back where the lot is  and came in on the deck near the back door. There was a sign instructing us to go to the front door to get seated  so we went through the front door... only to be told by the host to meet him in back where we came in initially. That makes a ton of sense.  eye roll  We were seated quickly  but not given any menus. What appeared to be a busgirl dropped off chips  amp  salsa and waters. Still no menus. I watched her pick up finished plates and drop off more chips waters to other new customers. Minutes pass  we still have no menu. This busgirl never said anything apologetic or even  your waitress will be right with you   nor was she even wearing her mask correctly  bless her little heart. Her nose was sticking out of it. She came back over to us to fill our waters which had a whopping two sips taken out of them. Thanks honey but um  menus would be more helpful. She continued just giving everyone on the deck water and chips. We waited a good 15 minutes without anyone giving us menus  taking a drink order  or at least giving us an apology and reasons as to why the service was taking so long. It was not busy. Very agitated at this point  I see the busgirl through the window heading out with a huge tray of water glasses and that s when we left because I was about to flip that whole tray of goddamn waters right on her. DON T WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE. Just read the funny signs they put out in the book or on the internet.
El Arroyo 5th Street,71,Good food  fantastic Margaritas  and delightfully polite wait staff. My husband and I wanted a new spot for Mexican food and we decided to try El Arroyo. There were not many customers in the restaurant so we were worried it may not be good. On the contrary  it was delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed the marquee sayings which they are famous for with their witty jests.
El Arroyo 5th Street,72,We enjoy the humor that their marquee provides but that s about it.  My wife and I decided to make the 30 mile trip to try the food and I wished I would of trusted the reviews.     Chips and salsa were okay.   Water was automatically delivered to the table as we sat down.   The water was tasty. Not sure about the others drinks because we weren t asked for any other drink orders.   We both ordered the 5th street tacos  Al Pastor on corn tortillas to be exact.  After maybe 15 minutes we received our tacos.  We received beef fajitas tacos on flour tortillas.  They weren t very good.  I would of understood if there was a lunch rush but we were there 30 minutes after they opened and they only had two other tables occupied.   Pros  funny marquee and water  Cons  food and service
El Arroyo 5th Street,73,Do not recommend. Service is terrible  one waiter for the patio with five tables seated and he couldn t manage. Tables seated long after us who had ordered received their food right away. Meanwhile we sat and waited over 20 minutes for our margaritas. Came here for apps and margaritas after reading they have some of the best. Do yourself a favor and skip it  just take a picture of the sign and move on.
El Arroyo 5th Street,74,Tried this place out for the first time today and have to say the staff is amazing. Best service I ever had  They have a pretty good happy hour menu. Cheap and tasty margaritas. We ordered the quesadilla and the nachos from the happy hour menu. Both were very good and large portions.
El Arroyo 5th Street,75,Sweet people work here  they re my neighbors I work over in 5th street. Walked in on a Monday sat in a patio loved the drinks. Had a seafood enchiladas it was OK only bc it probably was after snowvid and the plate situation wasn t what the normal standard. Still received good service. I m coming back 
El Arroyo 5th Street,76,The epitome of Tex mex is right here at el arroyo  I had no self control when it came to ordering food so I tried the chicken nachos  el arroyo special plate  and el arroyo special burrito. But first  we started off with chips and salsa- perfectly salty and the perfect amount of spice. To wash it down  tasty margaritas- at only  6  The nachos were delish  swimming in liquid gold  queso  and chunks of chicken- I would just wish we had more chips to collect the toppings. The special plate came with a smorgasbord  I gorged myself with every bite. And the burrito was really humongous  see photo with human hand for size   probably decent enough to feed 2  maybe even 3 people. Lost a star for our weird server. Mind you  we are still in Covid Times  he greeted our table with a torn glove in one hand  then the next time he checked on us  lost a glove  and by the end of the night  no gloves. It was also pretty empty  we were almost the only table and it took him awhile to get our next drinks and we ran out of water and never offered more  though he said we would get our own personal pitcher . And lastly  a friend asked for recommendations to the closest thing to enchiladas verde  which wasn t a menu item   and he suggested a crab dish  what   and then a dish with mole  double what  
El Arroyo 5th Street,77,Curbside pickup for the win  Help support neighborhood local businesses with sweet specials available now  Great food and great Margs    Thanks for being open and providing this great meal
El Arroyo 5th Street,78,No stars  poor service  stood in line 45  minutes waited to be seated by hostess  since that was what the sign said.  Waiters  other employee would come out to serve and knew there was a line but never told us that the hostess went home sick and that you had to go inside to put your name on the list.  At one time an employee came out to seat and I told him two and he said no I am looking for the couple that was behind us 3 deep  he never mentioned if or that we had to put our name on the list.  First time there with my son who came in from out of town will never go back  
El Arroyo 5th Street,79,This past weekend  me  amp  my family went to El Arroyo based on a recommendation.  The food was delicious  amp  the drinks were fantastic.  Because it was a group  they refused to put our order on separate tickets saying their system couldn t handle it   Go figure   Also  they were rude to some of our family members so they left. Our bill showed extra drinks that we didn t order.   The manager came to our table  amp  stated  they were doing us a favor by accommodating a large group.  Really     We did them a favor by going there  amp  paying our   .  The waiter  was good  amp  positive   Got the ticket straight  paid  591 on 1 card. Today  my statement shows they charged  669.20.  SMH    It doesn t matter how good the food is when the service is horrible  amp  the management is unethical.
El Arroyo 5th Street,80,There is virtually nothing on the menu that you haven t seen before  elsewhere  and thats part of the charm of the place.  It s _old school Tex-Mex_  for good or for bad. When you sit down  they bring you a basket of chips salsa  both of which are  exceptionally  good.  Hanging out in the shade  w  a cold beer  munching on this - hey  it s a pretty good thing  The food is ok. Not bad  not good. ok.  the pulled pork tacos  OTOH  are  good   If you like tex-mex  the food can be  very  good. If you don t  stick w  the pulled-pork tacos  -   Anyhow  definitely a nice place to just hang out during a lazy afternoon...   bonus - fun signs 
El Arroyo 5th Street,81,We went there for the  2 margs and after we were seated we sat there for 20 minutes until I got the waiter so we could order our first round of drinks which took another 20 minutes to get so we drank them and dipped.
El Arroyo 5th Street,82,The food was pretty good. The taco salad was delicious but the quesadillas were a little burnt. Margaritas were fantastic.   Great Space to watch Football on big TVs. Overall a great environment
El Arroyo 5th Street,83,Did the chicken tortilla soup for takeout and was incredibly impressed. They did a wonderful job of packaging the toppings and tortilla chips separately from the soup  and the serving size for a cup was far larger than I expected 
El Arroyo 5th Street,84,The fish tacos were amazing. Margs are even better  The service was excellent. Our server was very attentive and prompt.
El Arroyo 5th Street,85,Hands down best enchiladas I ve had in a while. They re better than my grandmas but I won t tell her that. We came for brunch and did not have to wait and in time for happy hour  I m from Corpus Christi so I didn t know where to go. So glad I was recommended this place because I also highly recommend.
El Arroyo 5th Street,86,Came here for margs on a Thursday night and while I had a great time  many things went wrong. First off  they promoted  1 margs all day and when I get there  there appeared to be a  communication issue with management  and were actually  2 each. I don t think there was a communication issue  but them up-charging because so many people showed up. Second  the waiter literally spilled my drink 3 TIMES    I wish I was exaggerating lol. Every time he brought out my drink  he would slide the drink on the table and it spilt every time. And then when he brought out my water  he knocked over the entire water cup into my lap. Third  the service was just horrible. Our waiter maybe came to our table twice  if not once  just to do the bare minimum. It s a good place for cheap margs and I don t know if this is just how they treat college kids but c mon.. Do better.
El Arroyo 5th Street,87,Zero service.  Ordered 2 beers - she brought wrong beers out about 45 minutes later.  I only saw one other table there.  Serious case of IDGAF.  Damn that sucked
El Arroyo 5th Street,88,We have been loyal patrons of el arroyo since we moved into the neighborhood 8 years ago. During the pandemic we regularly got take out to support them. However  enough is enough. Whenever we order online they are very late with making the food and ha e never gotten an order correct. We treated them with grace assuming  as with everyone  they were doing the best they could during trying times. However  today  they didn t realize they had online orders when I walked in 15 minutes after they said the food would be done. The guy managing the online orders told me he would print off the ticket and get it back to the kitchen right away. 20 minutes later I ask someone to check on my food. Turns out he printed someone else s order and mine still had not been made. His excuse was that he got distracted trying to help out with the tables. No apology  no offer to make thing s right just a  what do you want me to do   Like it was out of his control.  To constantly wait for mediocre food and regularly get the wrong food is just too much at this point. We will no longer be supporting this business.
El Arroyo 5th Street,89,Staff did their job. That s about where the positives ended  Food was extraordinarily average. My entree tasted so bland and even the salsa barely had any flavor. If you re looking for the best Tex-Mex in Austin  it isn t here  hell  if you re looking for good food in Austin  it ain t here.   Maybe write this on the sign  Our Food Is Boring 
El Arroyo 5th Street,90,The margarita drinks hit the spot  Got me some 5th Street tacos  Perfect  I love the sign for today... I don t always roll a joint. But when I do it s my ankle  haha   Ask for Alexander he was on top of his service and customer satisfaction   D
El Arroyo 5th Street,91,Great place to come if you want to be ignored.   Trying to support local businesses during this pandemic but regret wasting my money here. Came for margs and guacamole and it took over an hour for our server to ask if we wanted  another round and then another hour to bring our check.
El Arroyo 5th Street,92,Don t be fooled by the popular El Arroyo sign outside. Save your time  money  and stomach. Had an awful experience here. We were seated on the patio for almost 10-15 minutes before we were given waters chips. After that  there was no server to be seen. We waited 30 min after seating to finally place our order. The server did not greet us  was not friendly. Said they were all out of sea food after we ordered fish tacos  well you should have informed us of that 30 minutes ago . Food took an eternity to come out and it was not good-- at all. Bland burrito  bland and  old   queso. No tortillas given with the fajita  had to ask 3-4 times for the soda that was ordered. Had to beg for the check. Asked to speak to the manager and was told I could not and that they are short staffed. I realize times are tough but... this was a super terrible experience and I cannot recommend this place to anyone.  PS- The bathroom is disgusting.
El Arroyo 5th Street,93,I ve always loved the sign. That s the highlight. Say inside during a rainy night. Food wasn t memorable. After They reopened after Covid I was eager to help local businesses. The place needs hot soapy water. So unclean and the tables are so coated your arms stick. The bathroom is in need of an overhaul. The food wasn t good. I wished I had just ordered fries because that s the one thing that looked appealing. I ll go elsewhere next time.
El Arroyo 5th Street,94,This place is worth the visit on a Thursday. The tacos were good  but nothing great. The shredded chicken taco is the best one on the menus by far. The sign is something you have to see  as it is always changing. BUT on Thursdays they have  2 house margs. The margs made this place 110  worth it     
El Arroyo 5th Street,95,I hadn t been to El Arroyo in years and my companion had never been.  Now Mexican food in hot weather is not my first choice  so I thought I get a salad. However  when I saw the sour Creme Chicken I had to go with that. It was delicious  but alas a lot of food. So I hadt to take homeliest ours.  By the way they reheated well. Lastly Becky  our weight person was terrific. So go for good food and good service.
El Arroyo 5th Street,96,Came down to visit my sister who lives in ATX and was so excited to eat at this restaurant  The funny signs are what made me want to eat here. The FOOD IS TERRIBLE  The service was subpar. I only ate about half my food. The beer was good  it was in a bottle . I will never ever go here again and I m bummed I wasted one of my meals eating here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,97,I ve lived in Austin for 2 years now and this place has always been a staple   must see  when friends and family come to visit in additions to Happy Hours and queso cravings  more often than I d like to admit . The catchy Marquee sign draws you there but the margs and queso are why you stay.   That said  I ordered via their online site last night  Margs-To-Go  Queso and Quesadilla - totaling   90 incl of 20  tip -  supportlocal . Received the confirmation and awaited the follow-up e-mail advising where to park but it never came. I waited the 20-30 mins because I assumed  never again  they were busy and the system was delayed. After sitting in my car for 10 mins  calling and calling   I finally got a hold of someone only to find out my order was never submitted to kitchen. Instead of being put on hold  the person who answered the phone allowed me to hear  Sucks for this asshole who has been waiting  only to be hung up on while hearing people laughing at me through the phone. I called back 2x  no answer. Finally on the 3rd call I got someone who hung up on me because they accused me of swearing  which I did not when trying to explain my situation  now I m starving . I called back for a 4th time to ask about being refunded because I no longer wanted my order and before the last person hung up on me they did not advise what would happen. I was instructed if I did not receive my refund I should speak with Lily  sp  on Monday. From start to finish  this entire ordeal took 65 minutes. As I arrived home  pizza from another local biz and leaving a 30  tip for amazing customer service  I received a  Your Order has been Canceled  e-mail.   I will never be coming here nor speak highly of them again. You lost a loyal patron and IG follower.
El Arroyo 5th Street,98,This place is really a place to bring out of town guests. The will get a kick out of the sign and the gift shop. The food is atmosphere is pretty standard Austin tex-mex .The only time I go here is at the request of guest and they always enjoy it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,99,Happy hour weekdays 2-7 PM -  2.75 margs   Need I say more  I will definitely be back to try more of their menu.   Plus they have a dog-friendly patio 
El Arroyo 5th Street,100,great chips and salsa  friendly environment  and a nice staff. will definitely come here again 
El Arroyo 5th Street,101,I think you have to really read reviews to get a feel for this place and if it s the right spot for you. Based on my visit  not sure why this place has only 3 stars. It was a calm Monday night where we sat out on the porch with only three other tables being waited on. Our waitress was a sweetheart and checked on us regularly.   The pros  The crab taquitos were delicious and we devoured the queso within minutes. I ordered a fried avocado with chicken and as you can see in the image  it was pretty tasty. There are water spray bottles that are to spray away birds. I could not stop giggling.   The cons  I ordered a  skinny  margarita and it tasted skinny.  The salsa was not very spicy and didn t impress me much.  This seems like a standard Mexican restaurant with good food. I d go back again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,102,Went for brunch on Sunday. Service was slow. Our order was placed wrong so wait time was doubeled.   The Chicken Fajitas were real dry with big chunks of chicken which was still cold inside.   We walked in with not much expectations and did not get much. They had run out of mimosa glasses so our mimosa was served in wine glass of different sizes.
El Arroyo 5th Street,103,Sadly i forgot to grab pictures but aside from the famous witty signs out front  there wasn t anything spectacular to photograph. Our server was super friendly and our drinks were pretty average margaritas. I wouldn t rave about the queso and my entree was really not great at all    but it s a 3 minutes walk from our place so I will be back when we are in The mood for some cheap maths once again  hopefully by then their frozen margarita machine works   
El Arroyo 5th Street,104,Amazing place  We had a pretty large party and they accommodated us as much as they could in accordance to the regulations for COVID all while near closing time   Highly recommend this restaurant  the fajita  amp  chicken plate was delicious.
El Arroyo 5th Street,105,I MEAN WHERE THE F    SHOULD I START  Drake voice    I would not give them a star if it weren t required. I used to look forward to taking family visiting from out of town or my friends here but this place has gone downhill. In recent months  I have witnessed disgusting and unclean practices within the work place. A few months ago my boyfriend and I went to eat there for an early date night happy hour and sat out on the patio. We had the slowest service mind you they were not busy at all. There were two tables inside and one other table sat outside with us. Our waitress took forever to greet us  did not offer refills or follow up with us once  and TOUCHED a dog from the other table and did not wash her hands afterwards. She continued to move throughout the restaurant and patio area serving the guests food beverages with dirty hands.   Fast forward to tonight. A close girlfriend of mine and I went to happy hour to give it one more try. Sometimes places can mess up we thought but oh no we regretted our decision immediately  We sit down and no one greets us for ten minutes. The table next to us had a full grown Labradoodle that isn t trained and is jumping around constantly. The dog jumped up onto our table and tried to eat the chip and dips we had  WTF......after all of that BS we finally got brought menus then were ignored for another ten minutes. We could overhear the waitresses discussing who was going to take our table because neither one wanted to and eventually the younger girl gave in. She brought us waters and dipped out for a while. Eventually she returned and asked us for our drink and app order. When she returned with our drinks and app her and the other waitress walked to the table with the pup. The other waitress pet the dog which is fine but she DID NOT wash her hands. She served people their entrees and drinks. We saw her touch the chip warmer  ice scoop  batch house margarita cooler  and bus tub but never wash her hands......MIND YOU they have several sinks strategically placed around the restaurant which she chose to use none of them     By that point we were disgusted...how is a restaurant with employees such as that woman operating still  It s not the worst part though. Our waitress had on a dress that should be categorized as a tunic. She had nothing on underneath her dress. She bent over to grab something by the bar and my friend and I saw her goodies that we did not NEED nor WANT to see. She then proceeds to stand up and walk to the back corner by the other waitress passed the food window and she climbs on the stainless steel Togo table with her bare behind flat on the table where Togo orders are sitting and have sat and her leg propped up on this bakers rack  It was INSANE  It was a social media captured moment for sure. This place needs to be exposed and the health inspector needs to re-evaluate that score they gave to this establishment.
El Arroyo 5th Street,106,Have come here many times but never ate from the menu  so can t comment on that. Only been here for their thursday night  2 margarita special. Very good ambience and an amazing price point 
El Arroyo 5th Street,107,Went for brunch. Had the 2 breakfast tacos   chorizo and egg ...comes with potato and beans. Sides had no seasoning. The tacos were unnaturally hot and took way longer than expected for the slow day. Were they microwaved  Were they Sat under a lamp  Tortillas were from a package  reheated and dried to the point splitting and cracking when I rolled them around the tacos. Bloody Mary was was too concentrated. Had to water it down.   Shame on the kitchen manager. There is a lot of competitors out there. Just skip this place.  1 Star food  2 star patio deck.
El Arroyo 5th Street,108,I was visiting friends in Killeen and drove over to Austin for lunch.  The place was OK... the food average and service OK.  Needless to say  I ll not be back  considering all of the other options in the area.
El Arroyo 5th Street,109,Service was unbelievably horrible. I eat out all the time and this was by far my worst experience at a restaurant. Cockroaches and flies everywhere. Is 0 stars an option  
El Arroyo 5th Street,110,I ve been coming here for years. Not the best Tex-Mex but definitely not the worst. Great for lunch with a group. Fast and friendly service always. Food is good and margaritas are great  Parking sucks.
El Arroyo 5th Street,111,This place is all hype. Was looking forward to some delicious Tex Mex in ATX   amp  decided to come here. We decided to sit in the patio  but I was instantly disgusted with the buckets of dirty dishes they had sitting out on a cart in the sun. All you could see is flies swarming  amp  pigeons trying to eat from the trash they had sitting there. Our waiter  Nick  greeted us  amp  told us chips  amp  salsa were coming out as well as water but he took his sweet time coming back. And instead of removing the dirty buckets he just tried to shoo the flies  amp  birds away. During that time we decided to switch tables since it wasn t busy   amp  we didn t want to sit were all the trash was. He came back out to take our order  still no water or chips  amp  salsa. I tried placing an order for a margarita  amp  he asked for my ID  he condescendingly asked if it was a fake ID. We decided to leave  I wouldn t waste my money on a dirty establishment  amp  shit service.
El Arroyo 5th Street,112,Was looking for an outdoor patio deck to have lunch and be with my new rescue dog-happened onto their patio friendly deck-there was only one other occupied table -they had huge fans to help with the heat. The nice server filled up a bowl of ice water for my dog-I had  their  brunch mimosa  2.50 and the wonderful El Arroyo triple-a huge plate with a pulled pork tostada  a great beef crunchy taco and a cheese enchilada-rice and beans. Their complimentary chips and salsa were very good-I especially enjoyed the spicy salsa  Every item I had was very tasty-if I had been I the a c inside -it would have even been better  The refried beans were great along with the fluffy rice  I can t wait to go back-please help support this wonderful place 
El Arroyo 5th Street,113, food poisoning alert  let me just start off by saying that you re better off eating at a taco bell. this  austin staple  is the epitome of bad mexican food. there were cobwebs everywhere and the water tasted weird. the queso and guacamole were decent and the chips were pretty good as well. I ordered the steak nachos and experienced food poisoning the entire next day. i m not positive on what made me sick but it had to have been this meal. if zero stars was an option  this place would get it. I will not be going back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,114,The best thing about this place is the iconic trailer sign and...possibly...the happy hour margaritas. There are MANY great Tex-Mex restaurants in Austin. This simply isn t one of them.
El Arroyo 5th Street,115,As a place that is known all over the state for their sign and it s funny comments  the quality of the restaurant itself was mediocre at best.  I came in during graduation weekend so of course they re going to be slammed. Unfortunately  they also seemed to have all of their employees call in sick that day. It took forever to get served and people were serving themselves from the chip basket and water guns. A friend went a second time and it seemed they had more staff at that time. Food was nothing to write home about but the  2 margs made up for it.   Maybe stop by and take a pic with their sign  but I d go elsewhere for your Tex Mex fix.
El Arroyo 5th Street,116,I ordered the pollo avocado and it was gross. The waitress commented I was lucky since I got the last one left... which leads me to believe it was sitting in a cooler all day. When I got it that confirmed it... the avocado inside was brown and gross. It had absolutely no flavor  really it just tasted like deep fried breading.   I d come back for the happy hour  but that s about it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,117,Super great service today at noon. Food and margaritas were good as always. Simple Tex-Mex done right.
El Arroyo 5th Street,118,I was a regular here during college because of the awesome drink specials  specifically  1  decent  margaritas on Thursdays. That s come to an end now after an entire year of absolutely terrible service.  Recently  the wait times for service here have become considerably longer  the wait staff has become increasingly unpleasant  and the management increasingly absent. And on top of all that  I have been here two different times for  1 margs over the past year  and both times they have run out of tequila. Really  Running out of tequila at a Tex-Mex restaurant with well-known drink specials   My last time there was particularly off-putting  as the manager had the audacity to bring out our tables  checks after we had paid and suggest that we had been lousy tippers. Not only was this incredibly unprofessional  but every person in our party had tipped either 15  or well above that  despite the fact that we had to wait 30 minutes just to be waited on. It simply didn t make sense.  If this place doesn t fix things quickly  we might see another seemingly iconic Austin institution take a dive.
El Arroyo 5th Street,119,When the best thing about your establishment is the sign you should probably close up shop.   Let me preface this by saying there was 1 other table here when we arrived ie not busy at around 11am.  So we came here for a buddies bday and were excited to celebrate. We sat and waited and waited and finally got drink order in. Then we waited waited waited and 3 drinks out of 9 came out. Then we waited waited and 5 drinks came out. Yup you counted correctly 1 drink was left out.  Margarita rocks  ma am     oh I m sorry I ll get that    oh nevermind don t want it anymore . 10 minutes later a frozen margarita shows up at the table. Lol. It is now 12 an hour passed and we got a single drink order in. Well kinda. Lol.  So by this time water is out  don t have silverware   chips and salsa is out. So we did what resourceful people do we got up and started serving  ourselves. Lol. Refilled our chips  grabbed a  pitcher of water  and if we could we wouldve started making drinks at the bar    Alright so it s time to get our orders in  yay  At this time we watched the first table leave without being served. Another drink order in and food and not a single person at our table optimistic about what s about to play out.  It s hot humid and service is crappy.  I m honestly surprised everyone at my table kept their cool.   Time passes and we all get our food. Nope they forgot to put in my wife s order  migas and fajitas our server says  5 minutes . Lol. In El Arroyo time that s 20 minutes. Seriously though   I think I missed some stuff of our awesome adventure at El Arroyo but you get it. It was terrible   Disgrace to Austin scene   FYI We literally watched 5 to 6 tables sit and leave prior to being acknowledged.
El Arroyo 5th Street,120,This is one of the most disappointing reviews I ve had to make. El Arroyo has been a long time go to  but I give up. The food and service the last time I went were both terrible. The food was cold and bland. The queso I ordered never showed up. I would have complained  but the wait staff was not interested in checking in on us. Lately  several of the old reliables have gone away  much to my chagrin. When this one goes away  it won t even be missed. At least there s the sign.
El Arroyo 5th Street,121,Some of the best fajitas I ve had. Smaller portions but worth the price. Very clean  and accommodating. Restaurant also has outside seating as well.
El Arroyo 5th Street,122,This is a famous place in Austin. My friends and I went to el arroyo on a Thursday because we knew they had an amazing happy hour  dollar margs  and were very disappointed by the service. We arrived and asked the hostess for a table and we were told to seat ourselves so we took a seat outside. 10-15 minutes went by and nobody came to serve us or give us menus or anything at all. During this time SEVERAL waiters walked by us and didn t acknowledge us. We finally walked over and asked for service and they were very rude in reply. We went on to order drinks  guac and queso... it gets worse. DO NOT order the guac. It was a tablespoon of guac served over a bowl of lettuce for 7 dollars  pic attached  Rip off.   Overall Thursday margs are worth it just know the service is going to be very poor. Sad because this place brings a lot of tourists from out of town and misrepresent our city   
El Arroyo 5th Street,123,Worst  most bizarre service experience. We were seated outside  a waitress came over immediately and asked if she could put in an order of queso for us while we looked over the menus. She NEVER came back to our table. She was checking on ALL the tables around us but never even looked our way so we could flag her down. Our queso was delivered by a bus boy. As we ate it  we said  surely  she ll see that we still have menus and realize her mistake.  Nope. Instead  after we were half way through the gross queso and 30 minutes later  she came over and asked if she could take one of the menus for another table and walked away. We were totally dumbfounded. Wait... it gets worse. When she walked by again  we stopped her and asked for our check. She said  sure  let me get your server.  WTF       A few minutes later she returned with the check and said  oh  I didn t realize I was your server.  Uh  yeah. For the record  we were not on the edge of a section. We were surrounded by her other tables and she s the one who took our queso order.  So  after paying  8 for gross queso and experiencing the worst most bizarre service ever  I don t think a really clever sign can save this place.
El Arroyo 5th Street,124,5 stars for customer service   A week ago a group of friends and I ordered a pound of fajitas and only received 1 2 pound  so we were a little upset. But  when I emailed the manager explaining the situation and simply asked to be refunded for just a half of the price of the fajitas  they refunded the whole thing  This meant a lot to my group and we will definitely be returning. Not to mention  the food was fantastic  
El Arroyo 5th Street,125,Came for brunch during spring break with my family. Ordered the queso and to be honest  it tasted like velveeta cheese warmed up but still I ate it without a problem. Had the cheese enchiladas with refried beans and rice.... filled me up because they were so good. The cheese they use is not velveeta  I believe it was some sort of mozzarella white cheese. Very good. Had a raspberry margarita on the rocks and it was good but it went down pretty fast so I ordered a frozen raspberry mixed with mango margarita and it was delish. I recommend that flavor combo for anyone that enjoys those flavors. Price for a family of 4  2 entrees  2 kids meals  few margaritas was a fair cheap price. I ate at The Oasis the night before and I wish I would have spent my money at El Arroyo that night instead. Well worth everything 
El Arroyo 5th Street,126,I think we just expected an average tex-mex food experience. It was not good. Sat outside and waited for 20 minutes till chips and salsa arrived.   Then   20 minutes till drinks were ordered. Finally placed our order for lunch. Two of four were the wrong order. The other two items were  ceasar salad with chicken. We never got any drink refills. The waitress did not bring the check so I went inside and she was chatting with a guy sitting at the bar. She said    I know yall wanted drink refills but I never got around to it. Do you want to go cups    There were only four other people outside. Just two folks inside. Not a busy day. No excuses. Will not be back. If you are just going to see the sign  stand across the street.
El Arroyo 5th Street,127,It has been a long time being able to come back. My daughter  granddaughter and I were very excited.  I try to give grace during this time and know that there were only 2 servers. However we sat waiting outside as people who came after were served. But my granddaughter she is 8 told me to give a chance so we waited. I think it would have been ok but the person did not even acknowledge us. Not sure maybe 3 females whatever made us not worth even acknowledgment but we decided to leave and went to Juliet s which was a much more welcoming place. Not sure I will try again although have been coming here since the 80 s with my daughter and this would have been my granddaughter first time.  Anyway a simple nod or  a simple I see you will go along way.
El Arroyo 5th Street,128,New ownership with a fun new staff. Food quality has improved and they told me that they have plans to do renovations including adding a large bar.   One of my go to lunch spots and pre-game food stops. Fajitas are great and enchiladas are some of my favorite in town.
El Arroyo 5th Street,129,Seriously El Arroyo  The  seat yourself  sign really means  we may get to you if we remember there is an entire outdoor patio . We  along with two other tables  had no one come bring us menus or waters. Invest in a better staff. Seriously. I don t even see a point in writing this review because management has not cared about the multiple other 1 star reviews from years passed.   The 1 star is for the sign not for anything past the parking lot.
El Arroyo 5th Street,130,There couldn t be a more disgusting establishment. If you want the insides of your body to operate normally  skip this place. I ve  very unfortunately  been here more than once. Want decent Tex-Mex  choose anywhere else in Austin. Want great Tex-Mex  go to San Antonio.
El Arroyo 5th Street,131,I know more about El Arroyo from facebook friends in Arkansas posting pictures of their ever revolving signage  which is either classic  or legendary  or kitchy. I m not sure which.  Yelp just told me that I ve checked in 3 times to El Arroyo on 5th street and asked me to relate what keeps me coming back......  Well  here goes....  My bad memory.  Somehow the allure of eating in a ditch in downtown Austin and it s proximity to other things we do has gotten me to forget  twice now  how  poor the drinks and mediocre the food is. We will sit out and enjoy the surroundings  trying to remember what 5th street used to look like. And commiserate about our aging memories  or simply the uncanny ability of a changing city to just kill those memories altogether.  And then the food comes out. Not much need be said. This is Austin. There is very good Mex and Tex Mex out there....
El Arroyo 5th Street,132,Came at 8 30 on a Monday and could not be more disappointed with our service. The server wouldn t give us his name so I can t even say who it was. We had a party of 11 girls and they asked us to write down what amount all of us owed on one check  And then circle what we bought   Anyways we stayed an extra half hour lined up at the bar to pay separately. Worst service I ve ever had. Pretty sure he thought he could rip us off because we were early 20 s women and I guess seemed dumb enough to pay an extra  40  It was a disaster
El Arroyo 5th Street,133,The 2 stars are for the  1 margaritas on Thursdays. It s an awesome deal  and I have a feeling without that deal no one would ever  EVER go there.   The first time I went to El Arroyo was earlier this year. According to Do512 there were all day drink specials on Sunday  but the waitress said that was not the case. My friend asked to speak to a manager about this and the manager was very unapologetic. She said it was Do512 s problem  not theirs. In my opinion  she should have honored the advertisement or at least tried to make up for the error in some other way. Feeling slighted  we just  finished the drinks and queso we had already ordered and left before ordering any entrees.   I thought I would never go back here  but a few weeks ago I really wanted some Mexican food and didn t want to travel far from home. I recalled a sign I saw in the bathroom on my first visit to El Arroyo which said  Well  you gotta eat somewhere  which is exactly how I felt upon deciding to give it another go.   It happened to be Thursday which is how I discovered the  1 margaritas. The place was absolutely packed but we were seated pretty quickly. The waitress was nice but unavailable for most of our meal. It was no fault of her own though  I could tell they were understaffed and running her ragged.    Fish tacos for  7.99  normally  8.99  were part of the Thursday special so I decided to order those. It took a very long time for my order to come out  but we were drinking and talking so it didn t bother me. What DID bother me was the taco disintegrating when I picked it up  It was disgusting. The only part of the tortilla still intact was the outside edge and the rest of it was a mush on the plate under the fish.   I really don t want to go here again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,134,There s a reason this place only has 2 stars. I m assuming people come to this place because they ve seen the funny marquee out front. That s why we came here. Place seemed very dirty  understaffed and food was sub par even for a Mexican food place. One plus is happy hour is 2-7 with  3 margaritas.
El Arroyo 5th Street,135,Food - eh.  Service - subpar. This place seems to have definitely gone downhill.  We stopped in late afternoon for late lunch and drinks and waited 20 minutes for anyone to come by and bring use water and menus. Service was super slow and inattentive.   The shrimp tacos are supposed to come with pineapple slaw  which undoubtedly sounds delicious. But it is a lie. It s just red cabbage. When our waitress finally came by we asked about it  and she insisted it had some  pineapple flavor  which was also a lie. She finally said she d bring some pineapple slaw back out to us. Apparently it doesn t exist because she just brought some pineapple chunks.
El Arroyo 5th Street,136,Was excited to order delivery from El Arroyo because their margarita kits were highly advertised and seemed like a good idea during this time of social distancing. We specifically requested that our food be left at the door so to not come into contact with anyone  I also included gratuity in with my order online . I was disappointed when those instructions were not followed and an employee came up to the door and asked us to sign the receipt and handed us a pen and clipboard  the employee was not wearing gloves or a mask . Very sad that this place is being advertised as social-distance friendly but basic guidelines are not being followed. The food was great  but I just cannot get over that we were put at risk to receive it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,137,Quick and great service  wonderful food and very tasty salsa with chips and a nice atmosphere to enjoy food and relax. I can t speak for parking as that s close enough to where I live so I can just ride my bike and lock it up anywhere. But it does appear that parking could be limited or not easy to find. Otherwise this place is one of the many Tex-Mex type restaurants that I ll visit throughout the year 
El Arroyo 5th Street,138,Yikes   We were the only people here but still somehow had service that moved like a glacier. The chips  salsa and queso were actually all solid but our entrees were the incarnation of generic suburban Mexican. Unimaginative and bland. I cannot fathom how this place stays open in a city with so many good Tex-Mex restaurants other than location and the sign. Sad  because my friend said this place used to be really busy with good food.
El Arroyo 5th Street,139,Margaritas to go  Alright alright alright  Excellent adaptation by the management to allow employees a better chance to get a paycheck during these times. And it s an efficient drive thru set up. Take it home  don t drink and drive  and have a fresh marg while you binge watch  fill in your preference here  all night. Thanks El Arroyo 
El Arroyo 5th Street,140,My husband and I enjoyed the food but the service was just awful. Our server failed to regularly check up on us  we kept having to ask the host for more chips  refills and updates on food. Our appetizer and meal both took long to prepare and we got there at a time when it was not very busy. We sat on the patio and could see that the server was just pacing around inside. When we did manage to ask them for a refill  they told someone else to take care of it. Seemed super strange and it s a shame because we did enjoy the food. Once it did arrive.
El Arroyo 5th Street,141,This place will block you off their social media page  when you make a negative review about it. Says more about the establishment than the people who review it.  The food is not at all great  their service is even worse.
El Arroyo 5th Street,142,Very fun lively place.  Happy hour has great deals  Staff super friendly. Fun to read the sayings  Nachos were HUGE  Fresh guacamole 
El Arroyo 5th Street,143,I loved this place    I ordered the beef and chicken fajitas and they were so good  they made me realize that I need to get fajitas more often  They came on a sizzling plate  which I enjoyed  and the amount of food I got was NOT wimpy at all. It took me a few days to finish. My vegetarian friend got the No Meat  No Way  No How and she seemed to enjoy it a lot.  I also really love the iconic marqui sign that is just outside of the place... I actually heard about this place by reading a whole book full of pictures of the different messages the sign has displayed.  The building is also very colorful and looks nice  just thought I would mention that .  This place got me obsessed with fajitas - I ve always loved them but I never knew I loved fajitas this much     I can t wait to come back to El Arroyo 
El Arroyo 5th Street,144,Sat down and waited for 25 minutes. Waiters were highly visible and attentive to other tables  but ignored our family.  Disappointing.
El Arroyo 5th Street,145,Want average chimmejenga and pretty good salsa  But very busy and outnumbered. Food is average and salsa is pretty good while you have to wait a while for undermanned service. Cheap margaritas on thursdays so that s works  Wait but the check was  8 so all in all worth it. We got 2 margs and a meal
El Arroyo 5th Street,146,The worst service I ve ever experienced in my life. Can t comment on the food or drinks because we never even saw a menu. Waited for 30 mins and never even got a menu  Only thing our group received were waters that we got ourselves. We watched 5 other tables leave before being served.   The place wasn t full. It is just understaffed with a staff that s not particularly energetic. Will never come back unless I hear they have new management.
El Arroyo 5th Street,147,I ve always loved going here. Was one of my favorites when I moved to Austin. They ve always been known for great food  great drinks  Can t beat  0.99 rita Thursdays     and most of all  great signs   The Fidel s Burger  which was renamed from Cuban Burger  was to die for  and their spinach queso was amazing. Sadly  the last time I went  they d removed much of their menu  including the Fidel s which I so very much loved  and the spinach queso was gone. My friends also complained of their favorites having disappeared as well.   The drastic change in the menu really disappointed me  and while I wouldn t say no to going back  El Arroyo isn t on my  automatic go-to  list anymore.
El Arroyo 5th Street,148,I got their take out margaritas during corona virus with some fajitas. The margs were so easy to make and so good  The fajitas were also a great size
El Arroyo 5th Street,149,Not busy and after 15 minutes of waiting and no drinks served and or order taken.    My wife and I were there today  June 26th 2017 at roughly 1 30pm  My wife and I were in town on business.  The place was NOT crowded  We recall about 10 tables with customers .   The place is adjacent to an arroyo  Hence the name of El Arroyo .  It had stagnant water which smelled awful.  Okay  the smell of the stagnant water in the arroyo is not their fault but it s something customers might have to put up with.  Birds are continuously swooping in for food.  We witnessed a  great-tailed grackle  even landed on a table and took chips directly out of a chips basket in front of a customer.  As soon as a party gets up and leaves their table  birds will swoop in for food.  There s bird droppings on the benches  chairs  tables  and railings on the outside patios from the birds.   There s no one to guide you to a table  you sit yourself and wait for someone to come to you with menus.  This means your food server may not know you are there and you may wait a long time before being greeted.   My wife and I waited for almost 10 minutes before someone FINALLY came to us with menus and to take our drink orders.  After a few more minutes we were so bored waiting for our drinks and to have our order taken  we both agreed to give them 5 more minutes to take our order before we got up and left.  Five minutes arrived and we did not have our drinks  no chips  amp  salsa  and no order taken.  We left.  We sincerely doubt we will ever go back there.
El Arroyo 5th Street,150,I ordered to-go margaritas shortly after they began offering it. While it s nice to be able to support a local business and take my drinks home with me I was annoyed by all of the fees that ordering online entailed. On top of that I had to wait well over 30 minutes  about 45 minutes after my order was placed  just to get chips and salsa and the marg-to-go kit. I understand they re busy and it was the start of the day but there was next to no organization to get orders out quickly and efficiently. I ll probably go back eventually to give them another try but it was very meh for a lot of money.
El Arroyo 5th Street,151,I really enjoy the daily funny sayings jokes on their sign out front.  My work orders food from here every once and awhile for an employee lunch.  They are really great about giving use all the fixings and lots of chips and salsa for our spread.  We usually order chicken  veggie and steak fajitas.  The meat is ok nothing s special about the fajitas except the veggies are done well.  I do really like the quest and the chips are very good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,152,Order a pound of fajitas when the plate came  more than half of it was onions and bell peppers 28  for 3 tacos  I don t think so place is trash.
El Arroyo 5th Street,153,So today the idiotic sign reads that  hot girl summer  is over and welcome to  THOTumn . As in That Hoe Over There. Women  and men  are DONE encountering this juvenile  demeaning  objectifying crap. You don t even need to try the food to be disgusted by this place.
El Arroyo 5th Street,154,This place is great for the 99 cent Thursday ritas. I recommend passing on the food  though.
El Arroyo 5th Street,155,Must have been a bad day. We ate outside service was terrible. We were not checked on.took our drink order...no frozen margaritas  Brought our drinks and took food order...brought food. We got up to get more salsa and chips. Dropped off Bill. Waitress was at our table a total of 3 times. Food was good.might go back.   Eat inside next time.
El Arroyo 5th Street,156,I normally don t write yelp reviews but I just wanna warn everybody that i got food poisoning from El Arroyo on 5th st. Service and  2 dolla margaritas on Thursday were great buuut be careful what you eat.
El Arroyo 5th Street,157,The only reason people know about this Taco Bell level restaurant is that   Alumni Pat Green mentioned it in a song. The o my tho g worse than the food is the tryin-to-be cute sign they have our from the purchased at Sam s Club where they try to make funny little quips that pathetically incorporate their crap food with news topics.
El Arroyo 5th Street,158,Yep.... best thing about this place is the signs. Not good at all. Service was terrible  Like we sat after eating for at least 20 minutes waiting on our check. Gluten free menu was minimal. The place is run down and just depressing. We will not be back. Waitress was super passive aggressive. Glad we are out of there.
El Arroyo 5th Street,159,El Arroyo is a tradition with my Austin friends. One I enjoy to continue even if it kills me. Only been for lunch dating back 10 years or so and I can say one thing for certain  El Arroyo is consistent  Limited parking  shady cool deck and indoor seating over el arroyo  the ditch  are all part of the charm here. The service is average and service is quick with a smile.   The food is ok  not great. If you re coming for the food you need to get out more. It s everything else that make it an great adventure. The people  location and hip feel keeps me coming back. That and the Federales. As I mentioned  it s all about tradition so all I eat is this massive plate dinner  Tamale Enchilada Taco Chalupa Beans  amp  rice Plus a beer or margarita  I know  Right  Tons of fun and a drink.  Grab your friend and your appetite for fun in the sun. El Arroyo delivers a good time. And for that  I thank you
El Arroyo 5th Street,160,Three stars isn t really my thing but w  El Arroyo on 5th St its hard to justify more  or less.  So  what does three stars mean to me  Well  I wouldn t go out of my way to go here but it ll do in a pinch. And that s El Arroyo.  Had lunch here the other day w a colleague and was reminded it can t be better than three stars. Chips  Plentiful and stale. That s like having bad free coffee... Yeah  its free  but bad. The salsa  Nothing noteworthy and thin  I hate thin salsa. Mexican rice  Forgettable  but if you ve read my other reviews you know how hard it is to get Mexican rice right.  The good  The tamale plate  pork  is usually pretty reliable  and its pretty damned tasty. And the charro beans  Really good - better than average.  Service here  like many old Austin institutions  is entirely a crap shoot  sometimes good  sometimes not. The bus service  clean-up  chips salsa  is almost always good however  while the hostesses  when on duty  are almost always put off by having to show you to your table.  What a place  some one-star stuff  some five  or close to five anyway  so that s a three.  Perhaps the best thing about this place is its ever-changing and almost always snarky and fun sign. But if you re a restaurant and the thing you re best known for is your marquee  Well  that s not good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,161,Here for Happy Hour. Food is amazing and very worthy of what you pay for. Super delicious. I ve always wanted to stop by and glad I did. Can t wait to come back  -
El Arroyo 5th Street,162,I ve driven past this interesting looking place several times while in Austin  with its random collection of painted car parts and catchy phrases on its road sign.  Finally met some people here for dinner over the weekend and was less than impressed.  My party and I were seated at a table in front of a window that allowed the sun to shine directly in our faces the entire meal.  There were two waitresses attempting to service the main area and both outdoor patios by themselves.  The queso was mediocre  the food was dry overall  and the crispy taco gets a special mention because it was in a well-overdone flour shell  which ruined the taste of the entire thing.  I know Texas is going through a heat wave right now but they need to do something about their fly problem.  I have had much better Mexican food in Austin and likely won t be coming back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,163,This place is run down . The bathrooms are nasty to say the least . Enough said and oh yeah   the good is sub par.
El Arroyo 5th Street,164,Been here a handful of times and everything has been pretty good. I came here for margs and it was hard to get the bartenders  attention at the bar. When I ordered my first drink  I started a tab and handed the bartender my card and she handed it back to me. A couple drinks later  my friends were in a rush to leave and I figured their policy is like most places where if you don t close your tab  they charge a gratuity charge  no big deal . Well  apparently they never swiped my card and only got my name so when I was leaving  they started yelling at me for not paying. I m more than happy to pay  but I wasn t informed that they didn t get my information. Once I told them I thought they already charged me  they continued to be rude and acted like I intentionally wanted to dine and dash  it honestly ruined my night. I don t think I will be coming back after this experience.
El Arroyo 5th Street,165,Used to frequent this place in college. While waiting for our table bartender rejects us for a predinner drink because she was too busy. Suggested we wait to be seated to order a drink and suggested that would be quicker...being sent away from a bar on a Friday night is a first. Figured if they can get some drinks out dinner may be a loss.
El Arroyo 5th Street,166,Horrible service. Here for 2 and a half hours and most of it was because I was waiting for service. The food was decent but might have been because I was so hungry by the time I got it I didn t get to taste it. No chips and salsa when I arrived  dinner time  with my group  4 people  nor did some ever come even after waitress said some would be coming. Overall not coming to this location again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,167,Let me start off by saying  the food was great. Good Tex mex and what you d expect. With that out of the way... this is the WORST service I ve ever received. Our server told us more than 5 times to hold on  or put up his finger  walked past us countless times with no acknowledgement. Zero refills on drinks or chips without us basically yelling out at him to get his attention. We had to go inside from the patio to ask for service and to get someone to run our cards to pay as he ignored our table continuously. Not to mention anytime we did ask for something  we were met with an eye roll as he seemed bothered. Also let me mention that this was at 1 30 2pm... I d hate to see what we d get during dinner.
El Arroyo 5th Street,168,We weren t able to be served  and had to leave  I used to love el Arroyo when I lived in Austin  but I can t recommend it now. I understand being understaffed  but there were plenty of tables and it was a Saturday night....and it s in a central location  All in all  we had to leave after no one acknowledged our set of tables at all.
El Arroyo 5th Street,169,One star only because we tried coming here on Sunday at 9 05 and were told they were closing. They close at 10. Change your website and Yelp to reflect accurate hours.
El Arroyo 5th Street,170,Blown away  I wanted to try something different so I decided to get the stuffed zucchini and wow  The red sauce was just spicy enough and the green had a nice Curtis flavor to it  With the added sweet flavor of the zucchini and the savory chicken  the whole meal was.... well  worth the drive 
El Arroyo 5th Street,171,well just went in today didn t even get to try their food. But based on customer services they get 1 star. Walked in told us to sit anywhere that they would be right out. Sat down 15min passed and no service what so ever. No menu  no water or chips. While sitting down noticed the staff walking around catering other people. I understand if they were a bit busy but they didn t even take the time to say we are a bit busy but will be with you as soon as possible. We ultimately decided to leave after seeing one of the staff being rude to a customer and then getting annoyed after they asked for their drinks. After the service I saw today not sure if i will be back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,172,Sign  hilarious Food  average  Service  shitty  Came here again yesterday  why     and it s the same as it s always been. In Austin you ll have to try hard to find a tex-mex place that does not have better food.  If I m looking for a positive I ll say the drink prices are pretty good and the patio can be fun.
El Arroyo 5th Street,173,This place is absolutely awful. If a Mexican restaurant in Texas can t do queso  you kind of know you re screwed. Ours came to the table cold and congealed. We soldiered on. Our mistake. The most awful enchiladas of my life arrived.  Verde  sauce that resembled a tasteless wheat grass shot.  Ranchero  sauce that looked like a can of vaguely pur ed tomatoes. Bad bad bad. On the plus side  their sign is always funny.
El Arroyo 5th Street,174,El Arroyo   You need to up your game   Out of the graciousness of my old school  Austin heart   I am not going to post photos of the women s restroom. It is filthy  It seems you guys had a slammin brunch  then everyone took off and left our poor server and a bartender behind to fend for themselves. There are WAY TOO many choices in this town now for you not to at least try and make me feel like you ARE TRYING. You once were a classic  but now I think you may become extinct. Please WIPE THE MENUS  CLEAN THE RESTROOMS  TIDY UP THE PLACE AND HOLD YOUR STAFF TO A HIGHER STANDARD. I would guess they get the lack of standards from YOU though.
El Arroyo 5th Street,175,Very slow service even when restaurant was empty and Mexican martinis we re too tart - not like they used to be. Enchiladas del Mar and Fajitas we re delicious.
El Arroyo 5th Street,176,If you d like to know what it feels like to be treated like a piece of shit and neglected more so than you ve ever been  I d recommend coming here 100 out of 100 times.  If you like your servers stoned and inattentive certainly dine here as well.  Would come back when feeling like getting pissed off
El Arroyo 5th Street,177,Monday for lunch and Out of Bud-light  Which would have been fine if I was offered something comparable. Waiter had a language barrier there for nothing was correct.
El Arroyo 5th Street,178,Heard a lot of hype about this place  and the sign  so why not try it while in Austin   We sat down inside and waited for about 5 minutes before getting up and asking if we needed to go to the counter to order. The waiter looked at us like we were dumb for asking....and eventually our waitress came over. Once we ordered everything came out pretty fast.   We ordered the trio  salsa  guac   amp  queso  the queso came out kinda cold....definitely not fresh. The fajitas were great  two people and we split 1 2 pound combo. Margs were okay...but cheap so I suppose you get what you pay for.
El Arroyo 5th Street,179,I read the reviews but still went in to give them the benefit of the doubt. I am leaving hungry and irritated. Imagine the worst service ever and then multiply is by 10. Also  I d like to know how on God s green earth you can mess up CHEESE ENCHILADAS. Also ordered a sweet tea and was given a strange substance that tasted sort of like sugar water. The food was awful  genuinely. I saw comments before mine saying that their sign outside is the best part. I couldn t agree more. Will not be coming back again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,180,So bad  Came today with a group of coworkers. The service was so slow. We got our first round of drinks pretty quick and then they took our order....and then the wait began. We could not get the waitresses attention for drink refills. When we finally did they didn t bring tea. Everyone finally received their orders.....except one person who s order they completely missed. They came back and asked him what he ordered. Then they came back and told him they were making it right now. He got it when everyone else was almost done. She said as she set the plate down that the manger had discounted his lunch. Really  Should have just comped it. The bbq chicken enchiladas were good but the rice is horrible.  Just a meh for me. Not a place I will seek out.
El Arroyo 5th Street,181,When I first moved back to Austin in June 2018  I came here just wanting some chips and salsa but I ordered some enchiladas and I fell in love with the place. I quickly became a regular  coming once or twice a week and always receiving excellent service. This place has slowly gone downhill ever since then. Visit after visit our service has been awful with incorrect orders  servers arguing about what I ordered and claiming that the kitchen was closed  two hours before closing the restaurant  so they could not fix the order  and servers rarely come to the table to offer refills or give us the check. I shouldn t have to sit for twenty minutes to wait for the check. My rice was crunchy and the beans just left a bad taste in my mouth. I won t be coming back anymore. Try Veggie Heaven across the street instead.
El Arroyo 5th Street,182,Brought me the wrong order twice and the froze margarita machine was broken. No thank you.
El Arroyo 5th Street,183,Weak margaritas and no service. Waited 10 minutes in line for a drink that tasted like powdered lemonade.
El Arroyo 5th Street,184,My family and I were in Austin for the weekend and were excited to try this place out due to the famous sign  which turned out to be the only good thing about this establishment. Service was good  our server was attentive up until the point that the food came out. One of the plates we ordered was missing and since someone else had brought our food  he failed to notice that. We gave it a few minutes and waited  eventually we tried to get his attention and finally he came back with the wrong thing.  I advised him that was not what i had ordered and he apologized and left. He came back and told me that he had mistakenly given my plate to another table and gave me the option to take the plate he had offered me first or wait for the right one to be made again. By that time everyone was almost done with their food so waiting was pointless. I was saddened that our experience did not meet our expectations as the rest of our group was unable to enjoy their meals due to this mishap.
El Arroyo 5th Street,185,Had great expectations for this establishment but was greatly disappointed. We sat inside  the atmosphere was family-friendly although the restroom were extremely outdated and you have to step outside to access them. We ordered from the brunch menu  a few of us ordered their chilaquiles  huevos rancheros and the ranchero steak. The presentation of the food was not appealing when it was brought out. There was little to no taste  the ranchero sauce seemed to be the same one they use for the chips. The salsa itself was not bad but definitely not the same thing as ranchero sauce. The potatoes served with the breakfast plates seemed to be unseasoned as well. Will most likely not be returning.
El Arroyo 5th Street,186,This review is positively inflated because of the hilarious sign outside and because of the awesome service we had. Went here with a friend this past weekend. Chips and salsa were very store bought not impressive. I got the skinny margarita which was standard of ones I ve had before. I had the grilled fish tacos which were just okay. I liked how the rice on the side tasted  but lots of hard  partially cooked pieces. Our waitress was very nice and attentive  Overall good quality would probably be a 2 but atmosphere makes it more a 3-3.5 
El Arroyo 5th Street,187,Tex-Mex fabulousity   Their queso is delicious and their food was divine.  The way I test a Tex-Mex place is if you screw up queso or enchiladas we re done  but these folks have it down pat   Cute venue  lots of seating outdoors.  We had been outside all day and wanted to enjoy a bit of A C  so we sat inside.  They keep that place COLD   So  bring a little sweater along and enjoy great food and great service.  I must also say that the people watching is really good there... Parking is not great there  but no one in that area has good parking...
El Arroyo 5th Street,188,Been here a few times over the years  starting in 2014. This last time we went here was AWFUL.Took the waitress 20 minutes to give us menus  this was after we went inside to ask for a server to see us. Since my boyfriend was a server previously we decided to not take it out on her and still tip her well.    Unfortunately our bad experience didn t stop here. Food took 50 minutes to get out  just the queso. I ordered a raspberry margarita and she served me an original flavor. We were given no silverware and our waitress would say  it s on its way.  To everything but I m convinced she forgot about us.   After an hour and a half at the restaurant and only accomplishing eating queso  we asked to speak to the manager. He was apologetic and gave us 25  off. It was nice but felt like the meal should have been comped. Our server never apologized once.   Celebrated my boyfriend and I s anniversary here for 4 years straight  Unsure if I will ever come back  other places will treat me better. Also there was TP all outside the bathroom near where people were eating.  Only good thing is the margaritas but I ordered a raspberry one and got a regular one.
El Arroyo 5th Street,189,El Arroyo is great  Such an Austin icon. Not only is the food great  the margaritas strong  but the sign out front is HILARIOUS and changes everyday. This is super convenient and has lots of parking  I eat here at least twice a week 
El Arroyo 5th Street,190,Admittedly this review is for the ritas only  which are always great. They have a nice outdoor patio to go and hang out at  but bummed to read some of the other reviews about the food on here. At any rate  if you re looking for a refreshing adult beverage--El Arroyo is your spot.   
El Arroyo 5th Street,191,Not sure if this place is under new management or just stepped up their game but for years we thought the only good thing about it was the marquee until I got a random cravin for some tex mex.  We were tentative to go on their frat dollar margarita night but were pleased to find out that s no longer a thing.  Food - great  add jalepenos or seranos to the fajitas for extra kick   Drinks - awesome  the bartender hand made me an amazing margarita  Service - We sat at the bar and the service was legit in my opinion  everyone there had really great energy  especially the bartender  save for the occasional server  but that s the industry  There s something new in the ditch s water  we highly recommend  check it out 
El Arroyo 5th Street,192,REALLY GREAT FOOD    The best chips and salsa I ve ever had. I had the huevos rancheros and it was fantastic and my boyfriend got sour cream chicken enchiladas and I couldn t stop taking it from him they were amazing  Also had a pancake and it was so yummy. However  the service can for sure be improved. Great food for great price.
El Arroyo 5th Street,193,The food  the ambience and the service are all excellent. There s no better Mexican restaurant in Austin.
El Arroyo 5th Street,194,I ve been to this restaurant many times  even brought ppl over to check it out but it was disappointing last night. Waited for a table for 45 min  since there was nothing other than chips and salsa I went and got menus myself. I wasn t allowed to purchase a drink at the bar because I had a table  that nobody was waiting on   and the bartenders were very rude. So I just got water for my daughter in the mean time. I asked 3 times about who our waiter was so we could all at least just have water. Nothing. Finally my sister went in and spoke with the manager and he waited on us himself. I m glad Carlos assisted us and the food was great but why did I get treated a certain way  I m a local and I enjoy this place especially since my late father used to always go. I d hate to not want to go back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,195,Let s see...what can I say about this place...oh  that s right  it s AWESOME.   Not just for their hilarious signs that are shared globally on Facebook  but their drinks  food  and service are phenomenal.  Do you like Happy Hour  Me too. Know who else does  El Arroyo. Seriously  you should check it out.   They have a great patio as well. Do yourself a favor and get one  or a few  of their ritas  some chips  amp  queso  and soak in all the amazing weather Austin has to offer.  By the way  they have live music on the weekends. Sounds like heaven right 
El Arroyo 5th Street,196,Their queso has to be melted velveeta cheese and the chips are not good. The food in general isn t up to par with most Mexican restaurants in Austin. If you do come here come on a Thursday when they offer  1 margaritas. They are actually good for  1. And strong. I laugh almost daily at their sign out front on Instagram  in person.
El Arroyo 5th Street,197,1 Star for the sign  1 Star for the atmosphere and nothing else. This place had decent food at best but the most horrendous service ever. It took almost an hour to order  grab and go  breakfast tacos. The wait staff is super incompetent and incredibly slow. I gave them the benefit of the doubt  after waiting 30 minutes in an EMPTY restaurant and politely asked where a simple single migas taco was and they said their kitchen was backed up. If their kitchen was backed up when only 4 parties were there then I can t imagine how it d be if the restaurant was full.
El Arroyo 5th Street,198,I only gave this two stars because the food was excellent. I was there for an event planning meeting. We waited an hour for the waitress to come order our food. When we finally got the orders in  we waited another hour for the food to arrive. Fortunately  there was a lot to talk about or we would have left. I was definitely sad because the food was good  but the service was so bad that I would not go back there.
El Arroyo 5th Street,199,Their Marquee sign is a definite highlight. I drive by it everyday on my way to work and think it is hilarious.  I frequent this establishment for one reason only  the margaritas that are magically priced at  1 or  2 on Thursday nights. Endless chips and salsa and  1 margaritas makes for a very happy Caitlin.  I have tried some of their menu items  including the fajitas and I feel like the food is average. What really tops this place to a 4 star is their thursday promotion  where I can get my drink on without breaking my bank.
El Arroyo 5th Street,200,I come here because it s walking distance from my house but it s just okay. The margaritas and taste like they have absolutely zero tequila in them. The sour cream chicken enchiladas is the only thing I ve had on the menu but they re very good. Chips are good  queso is okay. Some servers speak very little English which can be a little frustrating when trying to order or communicate.
El Arroyo 5th Street,201,Consistent good Austin-style Tex-Mex.   The queso is good  but still by no means the best in town.  The service isn t always great  but tonight s waitress was very friendly after an initial hiccup.  Words of advice -- the burger is surprisingly good for a Mexican restaurant.  Quite possibly the best fajitas in town as well.   Avoid the rice that s been  extended  with the canned mixed vegetables.
El Arroyo 5th Street,202,Wow. This place was great. Got the queso  sour cream chicken enchiladas  a prickly pear marg  and a strawberry peach marg. Everything was so good. The safe was friendly and nice and the atmosphere is perfect. I am definitely coming back 
El Arroyo 5th Street,203,The service is the worst I have even seen in 20 years  There were at the time hardly any customers and we had to wait 10 minutes to finally get a waitress to take our drink orders. Then another 10 Minutes to receive our drinks. Might have second thoughts about coming back here in the future.
El Arroyo 5th Street,204,We went here on a Sunday in the Spring for Mimosas and brunch.  We were seated on the patio  which  given the temperature that day  was just fine.  Service was better than average as I recall.  I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar  which was a sentimental favorite mine from the days of El Arroyo in San Marcos.  Unfortunately  they did not quite live up to my memories of them  so I was a little disappointed in the food s taste  but not its quality.  The Mimosas were decent.  Due to an accident involving the table surface  one of the Mimosa s turned into a pile of glass just about on delivery.  We were pleasantly surprised that no fuss was made and the drink was replaced without making us feel evil.  In fact  I can only remember how kind our waitreses was about it  she made it seem like an everyday occurrence and no big deal at all.  Had the food lived up to my memory  I would have given this a five-star  especially considering the superior service.  Let s just say it s a solid 4 stars.
El Arroyo 5th Street,205,It was good and tasty  staff is friendly and outgoing.  Parking is a monster
El Arroyo 5th Street,206,I just wanna know that their  1.99 margarita is made out of on Thursdays... I m allergic to everclear and Hhmm i just wanna know if they make it out of everclear  But great place. Food is always good and server is always super nice  does take a little long to come out but understandable because the place is usually packed. I just wanna know what they make their  1.99 Thursday margaritas out of     
El Arroyo 5th Street,207,This place used to be better...however  the last few times I have eaten there  kids in tow  I have regretted it.  It s always crowded  so perhaps they have no problem filling tables and are no longer concerned with things such as quality of food and service.  But I think I ve given them enough chances.  I ll hit some highlights   I order a  1 HH margarita while we wait for our food  and the kids want a virgin variety.  You would think they d be the same price  right  especially minus the alcohol   You would think I d be warned if it were otherwise  right   Well  you d be as wrong as I was.   3.50 apiece for the virgin variety  times two.  Way to pad the bill.  From the breakfast brunch menu  I order a fried egg and some black beans  amp  grits on the side.  The fried egg comes welded to a chalupa shell  swimming in broken yolk and some watery greenish sauce that makes the whole undercooked mess so nauseating that I can only attempt a couple of bites.  The grits are a congealed orange blob that is formed to the bowl  which the waitress says is because they re mixed with cheese.  Good thing for the black beans.  I m giving them two stars because my son liked the cheese enchilada from the kids  menu  and because the building itself has a pretty interesting vibe  given the high ceilings and outdoor patio.  Never mind the huge exhaust fan and bevy of birds lurking.  Oh  and people with their dogs under the tables  which aren t really that far apart.  But I think we ll try someplace else next time we re downtown.
El Arroyo 5th Street,208,Omg like literally we sat down and our waiter NEVER CAME LIKE LITERALLY. I m not kidding you he never came by. We had to go inside to order our drinks and thought maybe he was busy  An HOUR GOES BY AND HE NEVER CAME  I m like actually cracking up because it was so so so ridiculous. I m never going back 
El Arroyo 5th Street,209,My bad really... I should have checked Yelp before choosing to go here. It had been a long time since going here but I do not remember the food being so bad  the margaritas tasting like lemon juice over ice  hold the tequila please   and the help being so two faced. Every time I had to walk up to the bar to get help from from waitress. Which is funny too that I had to go find her. She would come back to the table and was a sweet as could be. Only to walk over to another waitress and bad mouth us in Spanish. Yes  I m a Gringo who understands just enough Spanish.  Anyway... horrible experience but the waitresses did look like they were having fun grouped in the back part of the kitchen laughing. I wondered if they were drinking the tequila that was not put in our drinks.  I say stay away from The Creek... it s tainted
El Arroyo 5th Street,210,The food was great  however  the service was absolute trash. My dad has been going here for years and has always loved it but the service has become terrible. Our waiter disappeared forever many times and our food sat in the window for about 10 minutes  not even the bar tender  who was doing nothing  would bring it to us. Great food but service just killed it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,211,This was the worst dining experience ever   We eventually had a waitress decide to wait on us however  three other tables were not so lucky and ended up walking out.  We had to ask for everything we needed and the food was not good.  We then went to the bathroom upon leaving and could not use any restrooms because they were broken or had deposits in them.  Absolutely the worst ever and I really don t think they care   Never again     Your funny signs aren t going to make you money when people stop Coming to eat there 
El Arroyo 5th Street,212,I have only been there twice and both time it was for a take out. Will not do it again.  First time the tamales were like mush. You needed a spoon to eat it if you would really eat it. I went back and got a refund. Which I received grudgingly.  The second time I ordered Shrimp and Crab for  8.99 it wasn t bad.  The problem was my bill was over  12.00 which I didn t realize until I got back to work.  Guess taxes are high there lol
El Arroyo 5th Street,213,The quirky sign in front of this place is the ONLY thing good about it.    Don t come here to eat  Nobody there to greet us and when they did show up  it seemed like they were annoyed that we were there.  When the food finally came out  it tasted like it was leftover from the day before...cold and stale.  There are too many other good restaurants to choose from in this area.  If you want good Mexican food  don t choose this one.
El Arroyo 5th Street,214,I was really disappointed with the food. I had been here years ago and it was really good. Today I ordered the breakfast taco brunch  it was extremely mediocre. The tacos were very bland. the potatoes tasted like they were leftover from last night and reheated. The salsa was good  it reminds me of Julio s salsa. The mimosa was delicious. But all in all I won t return because of the food quality.
El Arroyo 5th Street,215,Just plain gross. Service sucked. So disappointed how bad it has become. Food was off. Slow to no service.
El Arroyo 5th Street,216,What the Hell      This is the worst service I ve ever had here.   For a place that serves marginal food they should step up the service.   20 minutes and no menus or chips or drinks.  Big girl acted like it was a bother to wipe the table off.    Skip this place and go anywhere else.    Geeze 
El Arroyo 5th Street,217,TLDR  Extremely rude management and consistently terrible service.   After 5 years of dining at El Arroyo  I am disappointed  but unfortunately  not surprised  to have finally had an experience with their customer service that will prevent me from going back. I have always enjoyed their good food  good drinks  and even better prices. Who can resist those dollar margs    However  the customer service has often left much to be desired. Whether it s inattentive waitstaff when the restaurant is not even busy or being regularly understaffed on a regularly busy night  Thursday nights of course . They also would often be out of very basic things like tequila  at a Mexican restaurant famous for its margs    . I ve had many frustrating experiences there  but I always just kinda dealt with it as I figured it was worth it for good food and cheap drinks.   Last Thursday  unfortunately  was the last straw. We were seated and told a waitress would be right with us. After 30 minutes  we had still not seen her nor did we have any waters  chips  etc. Finally  35 minutes later we had our drink orders taken and 10 minutes after that we finally had a round of margs to satisfy us. We saw our waitress 3x more in the over 2 hours we were there  for our second drink order  to give us our tickets  without even asking if we were done   and to promptly collect those tickets. We never had our water or chips refilled  and we would have ordered some apps had we actually seen our waitress more than once in the first hour.   She brought us our tickets at 10 20pm even though we didn t ask for them and would have actually liked to order another round. She told us they were getting everyone s checks out in prep for closing which wasn t until 11pm. So  we paid and sat around talking for a bit to figure out plans for the rest of the evening.  All of that wasn t exactly out of the ordinary for an experience at El Arroyo  so we grumbled a bit but weren t overly displeased. While were talking to figure out our next move  a man  who I assume was the manager or owner  walks up to our table and asks if there were any issue with our service. Being polite  we all shake our heads no thinking that d be  the end of that exchange. He then starts shuffling through the receipts in his hand  which turned out to be ours   and starts mumbling   Well  uhm  it seems like  uhm  there was some sort of issue.    We look around confused before realizing collectively that he was implying we all tipped poorly. Now  we all had tickets that were around  4.50  because it was dollar marg night  and we each got 2 drinks.   Upon talking later  we all tipped  1- 1.50 which is 20   for everyone.  We would have ordered more making it a larger ticket for the two hours we were there  but that was out of our control. One of the people in my party says that she s sure we all tipped at least 15   so she wasn t sure what the problem was. He just kind of makes this face while again shuffling through our tickets. At this point  I m very annoyed  so I get honest with him telling him how it took us 30 minutes to even get service  we never got our waters refilled  and would have ordered more but didn t get the chance. He begins to excuse that by saying there were only 3 waitresses  and it was really busy. To which I respond with a suggestion that they stop understaffing on nights that are regularly busy like Thursdays with  1 margs.  I have never experienced such rude behavior from restaurant management. Had we actually tipped poorly  then fine  ask us if there were issues with service  but to actually thing you will have any sort of positive response by accusing your patrons of that is asinine. Time to find a new Thursday night drink spot 
El Arroyo 5th Street,218,My parents live for the happy hour margaritas and queso  We love the queso and usually are too full to even eat what we ordered because the chips keep coming  I love the unlimited chips  
El Arroyo 5th Street,219,Back in undergrad  I came here every single Thursday for their dollar margarita deal and my friends and I loved it. The food is cheap and the margaritas are practically free- a broke college student s dream. However  over the years  the food has gotten worse and now the margaritas are more expensive with hardly any tequila in them. Parking is pretty rough and the service is lackluster.  Bottom line  if you re looking for cheap Mexican food  this is the place to go. Their food isn t terrible  but it s not great. I always get either the ditch bowl or the crab rolls with the jalape o jelly  that stuff is seriously good . I ve stopped coming here since I m an adult in the real world now  but back in the day  this place was the bomb. Sad to see it go down hill.
El Arroyo 5th Street,220,Have not been here in a very long time. Tried to go today and went in  sat down and waited to be acknowledged.  We waited... And waited. And waited.   After more than 5 minutes of being ignored  we got up and left.
El Arroyo 5th Street,221,I ve had good and bad meals at the 5th street location. The most notable experience came last year when I found a Texas beauty queen style blonde hair  think Lonnie Anderson  in the salsa. It was seriously easily 10 inches long. The manager was summoned to the table and to my suprise the manager actually told me that they had no blonde haired employees. That was really amusing as three or four blonde waitresses were visible at that very moment running about the restaurant. My wife and I walked out.....  I don t think we will return to the original ditch    
El Arroyo 5th Street,222,Killer food. Highly recommend Del Mar enchiladas. Bob-chiladas good also. Pastor tacos tasty but not a ton of meat. Great happy hour and a nice outdoor seating area. Great Mexican food 
El Arroyo 5th Street,223,Don t order the stuffed avocado it is disgusting and the beans are disgusting it s like they just leave them in water  I finished my meal and waited 45 minutes for the check
El Arroyo 5th Street,224,Not the best. Fat chips  amp  broken... I like thin and unbroken. The salsa... bland  ordinary. I ve dined here many a time  amp  it is very hit and miss  Not the best. Fat chips  amp  broken... I like thin and unbroken. The salsa... bland  ordinary. I ve dined here many a time  amp  it is very hit and miss  particularly the service. The enchiladas are so so  the chili relleno  ugh. The cabo mexican rolls are tasty and I like the boracho beans  but mostly the very best thing going for them are the margaritas  which  come during happy hour  or better yet  when they are only two bucks all day long. Toss back several frozen ritas and the food is suddenly much mejor 
El Arroyo 5th Street,225,This was a FANTASTIC first food experience in Austin   We walked right in and got a table on the patio where we were immediately greeted by a huge scoop full of chips and salsa. Our waitress  Whitney  was extremely personable  helpful  funny  and on-point with meal recommendations. When you go  ask for her- she s amazing and what made our already great experience  awesome  We hands-down recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin 
El Arroyo 5th Street,226,The food here is extremely basic.  So mediocre.  Bland.  They just recently pared down their menu and the new selection of choices is a let down.  The last time I came here  they didn t have a drink menu  didn t know drink prices  didn t know drinks  because they were rewriting the drink menu   only took half of the table s drink orders  were extremely slow  took forever to bring out chips salsa and then forever to refill them.  The manager and waitstaff were all very new and seemed inexperienced.  I would rather not come back here....
El Arroyo 5th Street,227,Known for the best  huevos rancheros  in all of Texas  I had to give this place a try. It s a colorful spot to eat  right in the downtown of Austin. They seem to have a lot of really cheap margarita specials if you come at the right time so pay attention to that  I got the frozen margarita which was excellent and of course the huevos rancheros    - they were good. I was sad to see that they took off the cactus on their menu. They have parking available in the back front.
El Arroyo 5th Street,228,I really enjoyed the food and drinks. I had a poinsettia  I had never heard of this drink but I m not a big fan of orange juice and this was a perfect brunch drink for me  I m a fan of cranberry juice and then add champagne   I was blown away    The chip and salsa were delicious     The restaurant has a great vibe   I can t wait to go back
El Arroyo 5th Street,229,This is by far the worst experience ever. First  the server was definitely NOT a server. Probably a kitchen worker with tattoos showing on some white because he was out of it. Way out of it. Not only was he so rude I wouldn t even trust my food being taken out by him being afraid something he put in our food. Second  he was insulting the restaurants by saying the whole menu was out. Legit word by word   we out of everything pretty much you still wanna eat here or not   Told US there was a back order on EVERYTHING. Oh and he didn t change the channel or got us water or greeted us. Third  next time y all are going to be short on staff gear the f  amp k up because people can tell when you re bringing ppl from the streets to  serve  actual customers who are going to spending money there. Disappointed is the least word you could describe the experience and other nasty words describe this restaurant.
El Arroyo 5th Street,230,I ve been here before and service wasn t too bad. Unfortunately last night was bad. We got there before the kitchen closed  but unfortunately we watched the wait staff stand around until the kitchen was closed to come to greet us. Our waitress was sweet enough to bring us Waters and chips and salsa which we appreciated. My date and I decided to order a margarita to share because she already brought us everything so we didn t want her effort to go to waste. Once we were done and got the check  no one had informed us that we had to pay for the chips and salsa that we didn t order. We asked why  and the waitress said since we were just getting drinks  we had to pay for the chips and salsa. I definitely don t think this is fair due to the fact that the wait staff purposefully waited to greet us after the kitchen was closed. I ll think about coming back to this place  I doubt it ll be anytime soon though.
El Arroyo 5th Street,231,I went to this place for the firsts time last night for  1 margaritas and I was not disappointed  I was expecting it to be really crowded but it was actually very fast and easy to get a table for 8 guests. The margaritas didn t taste very strong but I was  feeling it  after a double marg so I was happy with my drink  I didn t have dinner there so I can t say much about the food but I tried the chips queso and it was delicious. Would recommend for a casual night with friends who are on a budget 
El Arroyo 5th Street,232,This is probably the worst Tex Mex restaurant I ve been to in the city. People who speak highly of it are kidding themselves. The breakfast tacos are lukewarm garbage and dinner is no better. The restaurant also just failed its health inspection. Go somewhere else.
El Arroyo 5th Street,233,Came here for lunch today and wasn t super impressed. My husband ordered grilled shrimp tacos on corn tortillas and they came out on flour and I ordered shredded chicken tacos with the avocado salad and fruit and it came out with beans. The frozen margarita with the patron floater didn t taste very good either. Not sure I would come back here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,234,With such a funny  amp  conservative leaning marquee sign  I had such high hopes for this  establishment   A haiku to sum up my experience   Hilar signs for days  These pulled pork tacos are meh. Toddler sized margs   El fin.
El Arroyo 5th Street,235,food was good.  they were very busy and wait staff were hustling.  parking is a bit of a challenge  but hey that is the case at any place downtown.
El Arroyo 5th Street,236,Overcharged. Used to be ok for cheep Mexican food and drinks. Food and drink quality has really gone down. They advertise  1 margaritas on Thursday on Facebook. Charged  2 instead of  1 for margaritas served in small plastic disposable cups like Taco Caba a. Better off going to Taco Caba a. There are so much better Mexican places in Austin. Don t waist your time here. Can see why Far West Location closed down. This location needs to close down as well.
El Arroyo 5th Street,237,Yesterday evening was probably last time I will grace the rooms patios of El Arroyo. Here s why   A friend and I arrive around 6 30. Granted  it is Thursday with  1 margs so we expected a bit of a wait. We added our name to the list and were told it would be about 10-15 minutes. 25 minutes pass by and I go up front to check where my friend and I were on the list. I see my name and a star in the left hand margin. A bit confused as to why my name was the only one with the star  I asked the host how much longer I should anticipate for our wait. He asked my name  I replied  he found it on the list and said   oh  you were the name that got moved from the other list. I m so sorry  I ll move you to the top of the list.  He had mistakenly put me way down the list. A complete accident  fine...just seat me.  I then call my friend to come up as I imagined we were going to get seated very soon. The host leaves and a different hostess comes to the stand. In the time that we stood there  roughly 10 minutes  SIX parties were seated    I had to follow up with the hostess and explain that the other host accidentally put us on the bottom of the list when he transferred the names. There was even an arrow next to the star that pointed UPWARDS on the list. After her somewhat thinking I m just trying to move up in the line and me defending myself  my friend and I finally get seated.  Long story short  we order drinks and food. I got the al pastor tacos and my friend got a quesadilla. Altogether  the food was completely average at best. The flavor was just really off. The rice was kind of dry yet greasy. They forgot to bring my beans out and a sauce that goes with the tacos  the waitress brought it out when I was down to the last 1 2 of my second taco .  TO TOP THIS ALL OFF  a group of three fratty UT boys sit at the table behind us that had just been cleared. They were not seated. They sat. My friend and I could overhear their conversation and it went along the lines of   I wonder if they ll notice. Probably not   Let s get them to turn the TVs to ESPN for the game   Sure enough  they didn t notice.   Altogether  I waited 35 minutes to be seated only to eat lackluster food. And frat boy 1  2  and 3 did not wait at all. All of the contents of my dish were not immediately brought out or prompt at that. While I enjoy occasionally stopping to get my morning tacos from here  they ve messed those up too  given me a taco I did not request only to find out when it s too late to turn back and I want to get my day started    I don t know that I could return after the series of unfortunate events. They really should run a tighter shift. I know Thursdays is their busiest day but if they cannot handle the masses without people being seated fairly and somewhat good food being delivered correctly then they do not deserve the business.
El Arroyo 5th Street,238,Great margaritas and was in my happy food coma after eating my bob-chiladas  DELISH  Slow service  especially for us being the only table in the restaurant  but overall a good experience and will be back    
El Arroyo 5th Street,239,Gave up trying to order even drinks after 20 minutes of waiting... completely understaffed for brunch on a Saturday.
El Arroyo 5th Street,240,There was a group of 15 of us who just showed up for Saturday night dinner and they were able to seat us.  My friend called when we couldn t get in at another place and they had a table ready when we got there 10 minutes later  So awesome.  Food is solid. We had the queso fundido  which kinda looked gross after 5 minutes - you must eat this fast or it will not be queso fundido  and guacamole to start. They gave us more baskets of chips when we went through all the chips. I ordered the beef fajitas to stay on the safe side which were good.  Nothing amazing. Staff was solid and fast  one waitress for all of us . Lots of food for cheap.
El Arroyo 5th Street,241,If this review was based on food alone  it would be 4 stars. However  to me  a restaurant experience is about service  ambiance and food. I found the service to be incredibly slow  while it was indeed during the lunch hour  the place was not busy at all. Therefore  I will not cut them any slack for the incredibly slow service. Upon walking in  not a word. No sign saying to wait for hostess or seat yourself. After a minute or so  someone was kind enough to say sit wherever you d like. We took a seat outside.  We were one of two tables that had patrons. We waited several minutes for the waitress to come out. I asked for water and a margarita  Thursday special  don t judge me  it s always 5 o clock somewhere  . My coworker had the pink lemonade which she said tasted more like flavored water. I didn t get my water and but she was  kind enough  to give me a double margarita  without my asking  just realized after getting the check . The food was delivered after waiting an uncomfortable amount of time. I ordered mucho macho nachos with ground beef  and my coworker  the crab rolls. I requested a side of sour cream when I ordered  it didn t come out with the food  and still . . . No water. I asked for water and sour cream. Got the sour cream  no water. Well  I ate as much as I could with the amount of time left on my lunch hour and asked one final time for water. Bingo    I finally got water  several jalape os later . Long story short - food was good  service was slow  waitress was just blah. Since I work just across the street  I m sure I will go back. Just hope they make some improvements before then.
El Arroyo 5th Street,242,Ugh I wanted so badly to like the famous Austin El Arroyo  Slow service with only five other tables on the patio. Margaritas seemed to be missing tequila  Brought us three baskets of chip crumbs. Queso was congealed cheese that quicksanded your chip. Entrees were lacking. And teenagers were smoking despite the no smoking signs.
El Arroyo 5th Street,243,I used to love El Arroyo but lately it s been a mess.On a Thursday night a couple of friends and I had drinks and dinner on the patio. The first round of margaritas were very tasty  but the second round had too much sweet and sour and after making our server aware that they were awful she doesn t do anything about it and claims they changed it to  the best tequila . We decided to close out and grab drinks elsewhere since we could not enjoy drinks  and since she was also very inattentive.  Would disappear for awhile  did not receive orders for 35  minutes  Towards the end of the service she even asks who ordered what...  Okay  we kindly explain it to her and she brings back incorrect tabs  after trying to clarify her mistake and she gives us a dirty look as if we lied and cashes me out without a word. Unfortunately one of the worst services I have had.
El Arroyo 5th Street,244,A month ago  my boyfriend had the best portobello fajitas I d ever had. They were full of flavor and saucy. They were so good  I had thought of them since. Yesterday  we went back  and this time I got the portobello fajitas. This time  they tasted like nothing. No flavor. No marinade. Just boring  soft vegetables. I asked the waitress if they were usually marinated  and she said it depended on who was cooking them.   So... that s it. Expect that.
El Arroyo 5th Street,245,Our waitress Jane  was awesome   She gave us good info on the local music scene and makes a great skinny margarita 
El Arroyo 5th Street,246,Place looked and smelled dirty..our waitress kept touching her gauze on her leg and didnt even wash her hands..the drinks were flat and the food had absolutly no flavor
El Arroyo 5th Street,247,So disappointed  Tortilla soup totally washed out-no flavor-sent it back-ordered beef taco-same thing  No flavor- it s like the took the meat  put it through the dishwasher and put it back on the grill-everything tasted really bland-come here for the decor and don t expect decent tasting Mexican food  
El Arroyo 5th Street,248,Howard is so amazing  Great service and so friendly  Wish we had a place like this in Houston because the location is perfect for either exploring downtown Austin or a nice lunch and HH break from the lake 
El Arroyo 5th Street,249,Terrible service  sub par food  no parking  and freezing in the winter.  Thats all I got.
El Arroyo 5th Street,250,Came in on a Sunday for lunch with some friends.  There was ample seating  and we were able to watch the Olympics on a wall-mounted TV outside  which we liked.  The service was fine - we all got our drinks in a reasonable time  and they refilled our chips and salsa when they got low  not sure about all the terrible reviews for service here  ours was just fine... .  The only negative was that it took an exceptionally long time to get our meals.  After we finished eating  the manager came out and apologized  saying that there was a computer crash in the kitchen  and it put everyone s orders behind.  Definitely appreciated his apology.  Going off of my experience alone at El Arroyo  I would certainly go back.  I ordered the Migas and Fajitas plate  and it was very good.  If I go back  I would definitely consider ordering this again.  Also  the patio is dog-friendly - awesome.
El Arroyo 5th Street,251,Of course  I went there to see what the famous sign was.  The food was good to OK.  Chili con queso was tasty  but it even had that little film layer when it was hot and just delivered.  Not surprising because I ve heard it ranges from one of the best in town to absolutely horrible. The waiter recommended the enchiladas or something with their BBQ chicken  and he was right.  BBQ chicken enchiladas were great.  Good quality meat and clearly BBQ smoked taste  not just BBQ sauce.  Different than flavors offered in most other Mexican or Tex-Mex places.  Also  super strong margaritas 
El Arroyo 5th Street,252,I can honestly say this was the worst Mexican restaurant I ve ever been to. My husband and I moved to Austin a year ago and tried this place for the first time last night. It started out alright. We were pleasantly surprised at the cheap margarita specials they run on Thursday. Since there was a bit of a wait we grabbed margarita out front and waited for about 20 minutes. The margarita was alright. Nothing special.  Once we sat down  we waited  and waited. And then waited some more.   Eventually a shorthaired blonde waitress came up to us  there was no real greeting  we weren t even offered waters or another margarita to start. We were asked if we were ready to order. Honestly  my husband and I were a bit surprised so we said we would like a queso but we weren t ready to order.   Chips and salsa were delivered. The person that delivered it sloshed our salsa all over the patio floor before setting it on our table. Lovely.  Then our queso came out. The same person that delivered our salsa and chips  sloshed the queso all over the floor again  said  oops  set it on the table and then walked away again   Seriously  I can only imagine how many times that happens in a day and never gets cleaned up. So filthy. I will say that the chips  salsa  and queso were pretty delicious though.   Our server eventually came back and took our order. I ordered the taco salad and my husband ordered the quesadilla. 45 minutes later our food came out. The quesadilla looked pretty standard...no complaints there. As I went to take my first bite of my taco salad  I realized my salad was sitting in a bowl of water  please see attached photo . My salad had more water liquid in it than lettuce. Well I would assume it was water  but maybe that is giving them the benefit of the doubt  Who knows what it was.   I continued to wait for the server to follow up with us on how our food is.  She never came back. I eventually asked a bus boy if there was a manager around. The manager came over and immediately saw what was wrong with my salad. We told him we just wanted to pack up my husbands food and go. The manager was nice. You could tell he was super flustered and it had been a bad night  same with our waitress . For some reason he thought we were wanting a whole new taco salad. Honestly  I was over this place at this point as did not want to wait for another salad. Our waitress never came back over. I ended up going up to her and asking for our check at their waiter station  and then realized the manager had given us our queso for free and left the taco salad on there. I really do not understand why. I commented on this and the server agreed that is not supposed to be the case and said just forget about the tab  you guys are good to go.   I understand that the restaurant was very short staffed and they were super busy. However  I have had many restaurant shifts in my past where this was the case and I know for a fact our service and food never fell that sub-par. It is more than just lack of employees. My husband and I will not be revisiting this restaurant again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,253,Nope. Nope nope nope. I ve tried El Arroyo much more often than I should. The guacamole is halfway filled with chopped lettuce. The happy hour margaritas are so watered down you can barely taste anything. The fajitas are alright  but there are far better places to go for fajitas.  Worst of all  my friend got a breakfast taco and there was an eggshell in it. He found the experience to be... well... surprising  and one he did not want to have again.  There are plenty of other better mexican restaurants in the area. Trust me.
El Arroyo 5th Street,254,El Arroyo what has happened to you in the past year   When I first moved here  I could gobble up your chips n salsa  and devour your food.  Now it seems your Yelp reviews have struggled  and my recent visit has confirmed why.  Your food has gone downhill.  The chips n salsa tastes like tomato water  the guac is flavorless  how can you do that to guac    Sad to see a great place go downhill. Hope you re able to turn it around.
El Arroyo 5th Street,255,We sat on the patio for happy hour and it was frat central.  One dude at the table of   10 frat boys and sorority girls had a dog and the owner was placing plates and bowls on the floor and letting the dog eat off them.  A little while later a terrible smell drifted our way and we look over and the dog had taken a massive dump.  It s an indoor-ish patio so to me it wasn t like we were on a normal dog friendly outdoor patio.  Surely these things are health code violations.  There were a lot of waiters walking around so I was surprised they did nothing.    As long time Austinites our group has used El Arroyo as a get together restaurant for years to catch up when we are all in town but never again.    One positive is that our waiter was very attentive and nice.  Food was mediocre.
El Arroyo 5th Street,256,Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots. I d give them a 5 but service is sometimes lacking. The food and atmosphere make up for it tho 
El Arroyo 5th Street,257,It s probably been 30 years since I ve been to El Arroyo. Hopefully  it will be 30 years  or never  before I have to go back.  The food was decent enough. The service and attention to detail just flat sucked.  Our waiter  or at least the first guy that came to the table  asked for our drink order. My wife asked if he had Sol  beer . He left  came back and left again with no info on the Sol. On his third trip back I asked if he had checked to see if they had Sol and he said   Oh yeah  no we don t.  My wife asked what kind of Mexican beers they had. He said   I know we ve got Dos Equis...and I m not sure what else...let me go check.  Dang  stumped again  You don t know what kind of Mexican beers you have...at a Mexican restaurant     Then a new guy showed up. Evidently he was the waiter. The other guy must have just been the warm up act. He brought one basket of chips and one small cup of hot sauce - for a table of five. I asked for four more cups of hot sauce and you would have thought I had asked for an original copy of the Magna Carta. I asked for plates to go with the nachos  no such ruck there either. Then he mispronounced my name when he brought the check.  Both of the commodes were out of order in the men s room. We came in the back way and asked if we could sit outside and got a firm   no...we re not serving outside today.   The good part  They ve got those funny signs out front. At least they re good at something   Frowny face.
El Arroyo 5th Street,258,Wow pretty damn good. Got the macho nachos and they were legit. Service was excellent
El Arroyo 5th Street,259,The chips were a bit stale and cold. The stuffed jalape os were over cooked. Not to worry  TNT is down the road 
El Arroyo 5th Street,260,Horrible service. Every single time I go out to eat there. I try to be patient. I understand that servers have rough days  but it s way to consistent there. Tuesdays are a good deal if you re okay with a watered down margarita and no parking.Tables are always sticky. Almost every time I ve ordered queso  its come out cold and I always have a basket of nothing but broken chips. I love the fish tacos but it s annoying that one day I ll get the sauces  the next time I wont.   I think I m finally giving up on El Arroyo after all these years.
El Arroyo 5th Street,261,This place is just gross. I ve tried 3 times to really give it a  chance and I m not going back. They always have dirty  sticky tables. Never clean. I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like....yikes. Horrible service. They are either rude or take forever to bring food drinks. Mediocre food. The only thing that is great  their social media and signage. But don t be fooled.
El Arroyo 5th Street,262,AWFUL  I love El Arroyo  but the service here was terrible  No one knew who are official waiter was  so we ended up not even having one. No chips and salsa but people around us were continuously being filled up. We ordered our food as soon as we got someone s attention  an HOUR LATER we stopped our  waitress  and she freaked out   OMG DONT HATE ME BUT.....I forgot  then she continued to say she would completely take care of us by paying for our fajitas  otherwise we would have left  so we stayed. The manager then came up to us saying she would take care of us and gave us a free margarita. After finishing  the waitress came back with the check we weren t supposed to receive saying she is so sorry but there was nothing she could do and we would have to pay after both her and the manager told us it would be free.. SO UNPROFESSIONAL  Oh and btw there were rats running around   
El Arroyo 5th Street,263,I m an original  born and raised here and been eating here for what seems like my whole life  Haven t been here in a year but was excited to introduce this place to friends. It was awful  I was embarrassed. Sunday early dinner  literally 3 people working one of which was the cook  The menus were so faded we couldn t read them   Seriously  I had to pull the menu up on my phone. Drinks were horrible  mostly sweet  amp  sour mix. Their famous shrimp Diablo featured under cooked bacon. My guy ordered their seafood enchiladas and then was sick all night from them... I would have called for a refund  but we paid cash and bolted from there without our detailed receipt. The rest of us left 90  of our food uneaten. Maybe I should send all out of towners to eat here so they can giggle at their catchy signs and then hate the  Austin original  cuisine so much they won t move here     El Arroyo  this visit me sad that I ve lost one more place that made my Austin  Austin.
El Arroyo 5th Street,264,I ve been here once  and once seems to be enough--from what I ve heard. Went here for lunch with my colleagues a few months back and just about anything that could go wrong did. From slow service to poor service  we all agreed--our waiter was definitely high or perhaps batting a severe hangover  to sub par food  we left knowing we d probably never come back.  First  we had to go grab a server because no one came to take our order. Then we ordered a round of drinks  and instead of bringing us three house margaritas  one top shelf margarita  and a tequila with lime juice  we got five house margaritas  and if I m remembering correctly we had to go to the bar to see why those were taking so long  too . We asked if they were correct  server said yes  server was wrong  as we discovered they all were house margaritas. Our appetizer came out with the meal  but that was okay because two of our meals had to be sent back because they were incorrect  and it gave the two members of our party something to snack on while their meals were re-done. Our overwhelming response to the food itself was  meh  and we waited to get another order of drinks  but the server came back with the bill instead. We took it as a sign to leave instead of stay and waste more money.  The one upside was the manager or supervisor on duty was pretty hilarious. We got a good laugh and a gift certificate for our troubles for next time. We definitely would have preferred money off our actual bill though  since there probably won t be a next time.  I keep meaning to try the  1 margarita day  but from the rest of the reviews it d seem like that s not quite worth it  either. Oh well. Hopefully they fix their service and their food  since it s a neat little place overall.
El Arroyo 5th Street,265,Read the Sign and Drive On By.    Outside of  1 Margaritas and a person with a sense of humor doing the sign I am not sure what has kept this place in business.    Seriously  don t eat here
El Arroyo 5th Street,266,The food was OK  but I ve never seen service this bad.  We got here early   table of 3  and got our food.  As it filled up the service disappeared and EVERY table around us left after 40 minutes and they never got a drink. No way are they going to make it 
El Arroyo 5th Street,267,Manny  the manager was a complete jerk.  We had fajitas delivered via grubhub they left out tortillas. When I called back he stated he would have the sent right out. 3 hours later I called back and ask for a credit  he laughed and stated too bad...not getting a refund. I will never eat here or order from grubhub again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,268,Surly waitress... which is fine if you are an effective server. Except the service sucks in addition to being rude.
El Arroyo 5th Street,269,Really average. Not pricey but then again  shouldn t be.  Haven t been in years and now I won t be back.    Had the tortilla soup. When I went in the past it was mostly white meat and loaded.  Today ALL dark meat and not much of it.    Use to enjoy it years ago and it was busy.  Today at lunch  crickets.  I can guess why...  Parking is also a pain in the ass..... Waitress was nice   Cya
El Arroyo 5th Street,270,I ve been going here since the late 70 s. Has always been my go-to when in Austin. I ve literally been here more times than anywhere else in town. Sad today  because it s over. I ordered a frozen margarita and was told their margarita machine broke down a few months back. So  I ordered one on the rocks. It was terrible. Service was good  food was marginal. Obviously not the same management as in the past. Goodbye  old friend.
El Arroyo 5th Street,271,I have always loved this place and came often 20 years ago. I tried to rediscover it recently but unfortunately it s just bad. The service is just terrible. This was my third recent visit and I walked out before ordering because I got a glass of water and a basket of chips and no one ever came back. I could clearly see waitstaff and they could see me. I finally got up  after about 15 minutes  and asked a waiter there if she was my waiter and pointed out where I had been sitting. She said she didn t know if she was but she would serve me. I went back to my table and she still didn t come over  I finally stood up to leave and saw her talking to the manager and pointing at my table. I assume trying to figure out who my waiter was  Since I can t spend all day waiting for them to figure out their business I left. Sorry El Arroyo--you wont see me again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,272,Our waitress was the WORST I ve ever had in my life  her name was Haley  Rude from the first minute we sat down. I ve never felt so disrespected  She mocked my friends and i for attending UT and had an attitude the whole time she was waiting on us. As we walked away she yelled  NEVER COME BACK  We will not be back   
El Arroyo 5th Street,273,We went for the 99 cent margarita night. The deal was legit  but the way they were running the restaurant was terrible. It wasn t crazy busy or anything  but they had all sorts of stupid rules about who could sit where  and who had to order what  and how many IDs the bartender had to see to serve drinks. Look  I understand that sometimes happy hours can get crowded  but when you have a bunch of empty tables inside  don t tell me we have to order entrees  not just apps  but entrees  to be able to sit in the air conditioning. I didn t come to the bar to be told about a bunch of rules and restrictions  I came to have fun. Don t try to tell me how I have to drink. I won t be returning to this place.
El Arroyo 5th Street,274,Um I only had the best cheesy verde 3 enchiladas plate I ve ever had in my life. I asked to see the chef so I could thank him personally. He couldn t speak English  but I could tell he totally understood what I was saying. Muy bien Carlos   
El Arroyo 5th Street,275,Been going here sense college back in the 80s. We were visiting Austin for a bowling tournament for my son. I got the bbq chicken tacos and my husband got the avocado and vegetable entree. My son got the three enchilada plate with a chicken enchilada with sour cream sauce highly recommend that one  a cheese enchilada with queso sauce. And a beef enchilada with spicy chili sauce. We also got spinach queso. Very good stuff. Chips and salsa are made fresh. You can tell that the salsa is very fresh and delicious. Will be back real soon.
El Arroyo 5th Street,276,The first time we went the service was slow  but we enjoyed the queso enough to come back. Margaritas were just okay.  Today  we walked up to a patio that was completely trashed. I counted 5 empty tables that were littered with trash and the floor was just as bad. We decided to sit in the only clean section of the patio and we were promptly kicked out because it was  closed . We had to ask to get a table cleaned and were never greeted by a server in the ten to fifteen minutes we were there. There are a lot of places in Austin with good Mexican food and the signs aren t clever enough that we will return any time soon.
El Arroyo 5th Street,277,My party came here because Do512 had posted a tweet that El Arroyo was having Sunday brunch drink specials ALL day. Meaning..  2.50 drinks. The tweet lured us in. We arrived around 4  which idk about you guys but i still consider apart of the day   and ordered queso and proceeded to order drinks but wanted double check the tweet ad was going to reflect on our bill .. well. The waitress had no idea about it and told us she d get a manager. When the manager arrived she said  oh that s false advertising  and didn t even attempt to rectify the situation or apologize . She could have at least honored the ad for the first round because we planned on staying a while but no  she just said  i ll try and get that taken down immediately  yeah right  That tweet probably brought the handful of people that were there in the first place.    pouty lip and crossed arms  the queso wasn t even that good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,278,This place is terrible. We had great service  which is why I gave 1 star  but the food is awful. It was my first time there and the waitress suggested the Avocado stuffed with rice  corn etc. It was terrible and lacked flavor. The chicken they added was weird and there was spinach in the dish which also made it weird. I also don t trust Mexican rice that contains carrots and zucchini. I also ordered a margarita which was incredibly tiny and overpriced. Lesson learned. I will NEVER come back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,279,Poor El Arroyo. As I sit here on a Saturday night  about 3 tables are full. We sat outside for 10 minutes without service. I walked inside and asked for help  and the employees seemed to be busy  but I m not too sure with what. It s wonderful they have a hot spot on 5th  but mediocre texmex can be found elsewhere. The waitresses are disrespectful and seem to be very agitated by the one table they are waiting on. Yes  always written as an  Austin staple  but save your money and go elsewhere. I would wait hours to eat at Maudie s than sit at El Arroyo. This place is garbage.
El Arroyo 5th Street,280,Has this place gone downhill or what  This used to be one of my favorite spots downtown. It was always packed.  We arrived tonight at 6pm and there was hardly anyone there. We soon discovered why.  The chips and salsa were good  but that was about all. I ate one bite of the rice and 2 bites of my sour cream chicken enchiladas. Gross. I won t be back. It s sad because this place was so good a few years ago.
El Arroyo 5th Street,281, 1 margaritas all day  every Thursday  Don t mind if I do...  The steak isn t bad either 
El Arroyo 5th Street,282,Worst meal I ve ever had. Rude dumb short server with black short hair told us to never come back when i promise we hadn t done anything. She mocked my friends and i for attending the university of Texas. Do NOT go to this place. A bunch of wanna he s
El Arroyo 5th Street,283,I m hearing voices as if I am floating underwater or have cotton in my ears  as if from a great distance   Hubby   I came home and found her this way.   EMT  Do you have any idea what she was doing earlier  Hubby   She said she was going to El Arroyo for migas.  I think she was                 hungover or something. EMT   Ahhh.  I believe this is a classic case of Food Coma. Hubby   Food Coma    EMT   Yes.  Haven t you ever seen wildlife shows where the boa             swallows a wildebeast and then can t move for hours or even             days   All of that snake s energy and bloodflow is going to              digestion and he kinda slips into a sort of coma.  Apparently              your wife ate some kinda antelope or something. Hubby   Well  what do I do with her  EMT   Nothing.  Just let her lay there til she s done digesting.  Don t make            her do her Sunday chores.  Don t ask her to run errands.  Don t            pester her with romantic notions.  Just let her sleep it off. Hubby  Ooookay.  If that s what you think.......  From my drowsy  lead balloon weighted world I hear them walk away and I think   Aaaahhhhh.  Sigh.  Thanks El Arroyo  for making me so miserably happy. 
El Arroyo 5th Street,284,I thought El Arroyo was pretty nice for a place called  The Ditch.   They feature a large outdoor dining area  but since temperatures hit 97  we decided to eat indoors  where we were seated in a cozy booth by a lovely velvet Elvis painting  actually  Clayvis  a hybrid of Elvis and the restaurant s owner .  The interior of the restaurant has a casual feel  not upscale at all but not a dive either.    Our server  Javier  made our first trip to El Arroyo particularly enjoyable.  He recommended things like guac and queso  but he wasn t too pushy with the upselling.  Javier also volunteered information about the dinner special  two cheese enchilada dinners for the price of one   6  and happy hour margaritas   2.75 .  Well that sounded too good to be true  so  that s what we ordered.  The margaritas were a little sweet for my taste  but not bad at all.  And Javier s perfect timing meant we got all of our drinks at happy hour prices  even though we cut it pretty close.  For  3  those enchiladas were excellent  too.  We both cleaned our plates.  The salsa was just spicy enough and it complemented the thin  light chips well.  I would definitely go here again for happy hour and maybe for a meal  depending on what specials they feature.
El Arroyo 5th Street,285,Went here on a Friday afternoon for drinks. First thing noticed  the table was sticky.   Already having eaten lunch during work  we just ordered chips and queso.   The chips were okay  the salsa and queso was also okay. My one complaint is that our queso arrived several minutes after the chips and salsa.   The main reason for writing this review warning is that the house margarita on the rocks was the worst I have ever had. It legitimately tasted like dirty water.
El Arroyo 5th Street,286,Ok. So we ve been to this restaurant a hand full of times in the 9 months we ve lived in Austin. And every time EXCEPT this one has been great.  We arrived and it was busy but the chubby bartender greeted us and said sit inside or on the patio. Your choice. So we sit inside thinking that we would have better service since we wouldn t be out of sight out of mind. We sat ourselves down and waited....and waited.....and waited....for about 20 minutes before we finally got a menu from a waitress. That s it. Just a menu. We waited another 15 mins before the same waitress that gave us the menu told another waitress to tend to us. Her name was Vivica. She was amazing. Super friendly  courteous and very apologetic for everyone else s actions. She bought all of our drinks which was 3 rounds of drinks. Although we got a free queso  it was terrible. Tasted like can cheese with ground meat in it. Simply terrible. Vivica continued to make sure we where good and took care of us very well. I ordered fajita salad and it was good.  My husband ordered a carne guisada burrito and that was crap. He sent it back because it was shredded chicken. The manager  I think  came to tell him that those burritos are premade and cannot be custom made. Well it has been done before but maybe this was with the previous owners. So they offered to get him something else. At this point my husband was just fed up with the service. So he said no thank you. Vivica our waitress said come on order what you want it s on me. Well he ordered cheese enchiladas....goodness. Terrible. They where filled with sour cream. Simply terrible. Not the waitress fault Nor the restaurant managers. The cooks don t know what they are doing  clearly. Overall it was a terrible experience but if it wasn t for Vivica we would have walked out of that place. Good job Vivica. We may go back simply because of you for a drink or two.
El Arroyo 5th Street,287,Thought I would give this place a 2nd try after my last scathing review.  No change  it was actually worse....totally disorganized  food did not come until after an hour after ordering.  Never saw our waitress again  had to walk up to the counter to check out.  The only reason this place stays in business is because of its location and funny sign.  With all the Tx Mex in Austin  this place can t be long for the business.
El Arroyo 5th Street,288,Say what you want about this place but one thing is for sure...New Year s Day about 4pm  it s pretty damn tasty   Our bleary-eyed  rag tag bunch of 8 made it here late in the day  starving and a little worse for wear. Service no doubt SUCKED big time. But I m guessing they must have 1  had a hard time finding anyone to work that day and so it was slim pickings to begin with and 2  those who were there were in about the same shape we were    Still  a little hair of the dog  some chips and queso and the pulled pork Santa Fe Enchiladas  with the fried egg on top  later...a Happy New Year  indeed 
El Arroyo 5th Street,289,Even at  1  the margaritas are overpriced.  FAIL.  I had 3 margaritas here during the  1 special time... normally I wouldn t drink 3 margaritas and drive  but I didn t feel a thing.  I could get a bigger buzz just thinking about alcohol.    Luckily my friends are alcoholics and we had a breathalyzer.  About an hour after finishing 3 margaritas  I blew a whopping 0.00.  There you have it  the  1 margaritas basically have no alcohol.    The only reason to ever go here is if you want to bet someone that you can finish 10 margaritas and still stand.  They re probably still give you a hangover though somehow.  Or just make you feel like crap cause you wasted 10 bucks.
El Arroyo 5th Street,290,El Arroyo  you made my Thursdays with your  0.99 margaritas and endless outdoor seating.  Add Austin during spring and good company  and you re pretty super  my friend. Then this past Thursday I ordered dinner.  Well  we all make mistakes.  A little burrito along with my grease and salt would have been an improvement.  The sodium content alone rendered the dish pretty inedible.  Next time I ll stick to drinking my dinner and enjoying the perfectly spicy salsa.
El Arroyo 5th Street,291,It s with such a heavy heart that I now proclaim this location truly sucks...  My fav  Austin  restaurant since I moved here in  68.  I ve been eating here since the 70 s and the food and service have truly gone downhill in the last year or so.  Gone are the days when you have chips and salsa on your table in seconds   the tea gets refilled before you notice your out and now... the signature BBQ chicken enchiladas are the same price as the shrimp enchiladas       .  I have continued to bring friends here over the past several months and I just keep getting disappointed by lack luster food and really crappy service.  Whatever you guys changed   PLEASE UNDO IT    so sad about this place...
El Arroyo 5th Street,292,Ouch... recent reviews hurt my heart.  For years   the ditch  was my place.  You know how it is when you have your place... kinda your own personal Cheers.  You overlook a lot.  But I LOVE the spinach queso.  Love it.  Here s what you do   Step 1   Cut a hole in the box. Step 2   Put your junk in the box. Step 3  ...  oh wait.  Wrong formula.  Step 1   Dip chip in spinach queso Step 2   Dip same chip in salsa Step 3   Eat said chip and moan blissfully.  I love the ditch.  BBQ chicken  the works  nachos are SO good.  Enchiladas Del Mar  Sour Cream Enchiladas.  It s all so very very good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,293,Yeah...they have 99 cent margaritas. Yeah...the food is greasy  overly cheesed  underly spiced. Yeah...the service is generally horrific. Yeah...the changing street sign is generally funny and timely. Yeah...the atmosphere outside is not too bad  inside it s not too good.  For me  this means the classic 2-1 2 star uber-average place.  But since I had such a spectacular time on my first visit over two years ago  owing solely to sitting outside in February in shirt sleeves  I ll default to 3 stars.  But don t kill yourself getting here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,294,I had lunch here today  and it was a pleasant experience.  The big cheeses from Dallas were in town to look at properties  and we stopped here for lunch after leaving the realtor.  I had a combo plate with a brisket taco and chicken taco.  The brisket was really good.  Rice and beans were fine.  At the table we also had a taco salad  sans taco and dressing  and the fish tacos.   The chips were thin and not greasy  just how I like them   and the salsa was the perfect level of hotness.  The hostess and our waitress were friendly.  We sat outside and it was nice.  Not the best Tex-Mex  nor the fanciest  but a good experience and I wouldn t have any problems going back when I can try a margarita and some more food.  The waitresses wear T-shirts that say  Body by queso  on the back.  Steve said I needed one of those.  Did he call me fat 
El Arroyo 5th Street,295,OK. I have passed El Arroyo a dozen or so times on my trek down 5th street. I would look at the sign out front  usually filled with taunting sayings  changing with regularity. Sometimes touting the awesomeness of their happy hour margarita  sometimes talking smack to another person s football team. Clearly  El Arroyo was a place to check out.   I arrived  found the place easily and then spent nearly 20 minutes trying to cross the road. No joke. There is no stoplight and the traffic is coming straight  off of the highway. I later found out that in order to safely cross the street there is an elevated walkway located at the back of the parking lot that crosses in the air to the other side of the street. Important to note.   I arrived  excited about the dollar margaritas. I left an hour later  excited about the margaritas  but even more excited about the menu. You see  I m a low carber. I eat meat. And lots of it. I order burgers without the bun  pizza without the crust and lasagna without the noodles   well not really the last one  but isn t it a unique concept   El Arroyo has seen the need for lo carb food and met it with flying colors  In addition to a normal Tex Mex menu they offer a huge menu of Atkins and low carb friendly dishes.   Post a ridiculously delicious   and unexpected   meal of brisket and sauteed mushrooms  I headed across the sky bridge back to my car.   Downside  the wait staff was not very friendly. This was the only damper to a really fabulous happy hour experience.
El Arroyo 5th Street,296,I cant even give this place a star but since I cant post without one then heres one that this place doesnt even deserve... My friend went to this place for her birthday and once inside  she was harassed by the waiter and the manager stating that she needed several forms of ID in order to have a drink. This was not a prank but a hassle. If she or anyone have ever felt inhuman  this was the time. She is a very professional woman who was belittled in front of her friends and others. I will NEVER and I mean NEVER come to this restaurant. There was never an apology  the manager just walked away with rudeness. How many other people have they asked for several forms of ID in order to drink at this establishment        By the way  the waitress name was April  not sure if it is true or not.
El Arroyo 5th Street,297,I work in the building opposite El Arroyo and can I say that it is awesome to be so close to them. I LOVE pulling into work every morning and readying their cheeky signs. My business newsletter features their daily signs in a section. I haven t really had anything other than their breakfast tacos. They are some really good tacos for  1 and you get salsa. It is the perfect early morning option. It is super convenient that they have the little bus stand so you can see how busy they are before running over. I need to go sometime for a full meal.
El Arroyo 5th Street,298,We show up for HH.  There is an Bill Engval shindig something or other going on.  They still get us a table big enough and the original host and waiter are fabulous. Then   DUN DUN DUNNNNNN  the asshat waiter shows up.  see previous review  Suddenly  we go from great service to completely subpar.  It took us forever to get our queso and even longer to get a pitcher of frozen margaritas.   I left and went across the street to Sushi Zushi - this guy is SO bad and I m not going to let this asshat ruin another HH time for me. I let the host know how awful he was  how awful he was last time and about his tantrum he threw.   So  fail again  El Arroyo.  Surprised   Nope.  However  the original waiter and host get stars for being awesome.
El Arroyo 5th Street,299,This place was fun years ago before it burned down. A recent visit  having not been there a while.  Sat outside wobbly dirty tables  grackle crap. The place was nasty. So so margarita. watery queso greasy rice and beans.  I had spinach enchiladas  couldn t eat it. tasted like bad frozen spinach. Friend had carne quisada smelled and looked like dog food. My wife had chicken something some kind of pressed chicken ass meat. Even the chips where bad.  If you like this kind of TeX-Mex slop.  go down the road a bit to Maude s  cleaner place fresher food. Also getting tired of seeing their stupid sometimes offensive sign  driving down  5th ST. would never go back for dinner  One plus their morning Taco is stand pretty good
El Arroyo 5th Street,300,What happened to the person who used to do the signs   They aren t funny anymore and I miss that person.  Since I added a star for the signs  and honestly it s been like 2-3 months of unfunny so I gave them a shot to pick it up ...I m removing that star.
El Arroyo 5th Street,301,We enjoyed the HH house margaritas  which were  2.75 each  and packed a punch.  The staff was polite and friendly and we liked chatting with them.  The Chicken BBQ chalupas were okay  but the rice that came with it was bland.  Overall we liked it here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,302,Went here for brunch on Sunday. Had some queso and breakfast tacos. This was a great experience. The chips and salsa were free  and incredibly tasty  and I love chips and salsa more than life itself ...The tacos were hot  and the queso was very fresh and tasty. This place deserves better ratings than it currently has. Give them a shot 
El Arroyo 5th Street,303,You are all wrong.  Four things make The Ditch worth every moment   1.   .99 margaritas.  Bet you a buck it s where I ll be tonight. 2. ENCHILADAS DEL MAR       Seafoody goodness with creamy sauciness. 3.   1 Breakfast tacos. 4.   1 Breakfast juice  Love it  even if the service isn t great  and most of the food is just  good  in a town with outstanding everything Tex-Mex.
El Arroyo 5th Street,304,I used to live in NW Hills and walked by that El Arroyo on the week days when out on a morning walk with the dog... they had  1 breakfast tacos. I loved it.   I was headed to Town Lake today and thought I would stop by the downtown location. They are  2 on the weekend. I was OK with that weekend price. But when they charged me  2.71  a 50 cent surcharge for a  to-go  taco ... I questioned it with the bartender who rang my order. He said that was the way with all to-go orders. Pays for to-go cartons... I usually do not have a problem paying a surcharge  but I got a taco in a piece of foil wrapped in a napkin. No bag. I did not dirty a dish or use a table.  and I would have normally tipped  1 to the bartender... not today .  Maybe I am being petty for 50 cents  but it was the principle. 25  on a taco. Bartender was not willing to budge. Usually  if you challenge these things - they will concede. Not this time. I paid it - complained to the host seating people on the way out. They simply apologized  no offer to fix it . It was not until I got to my car  the manager ran after me and asked me the problem. I explained it.. He said the bartender had made a mistake and gave me 50 cents. That was a lot of work for 50 cents. Something tells me the bartender will do it again.   The taco.... you get eggs and 2 ingredients for your  2 bucks. I got cheese and bacon and a whole wheat tortilla... I like that they have that option. The cheese tasted like Velveeta - not real cheese. So not the best taco I have had. Something tells me if you ask for real cheese - that might be 50 cents. Sorry... the best part was the whole wheat tortilla.. but the experience ruined it for me. Go to Maria s... they are much nicer.
El Arroyo 5th Street,305,Solid tex mex  Super casual. The shredded chicken is way less minced than some other places. It is soft  juicy  and smoked like someone has spent time cooking it. Great chips and salsa and cheap margaritas. Great place to take out of towners who can t hang with spicy salsa. It s mild buy also very good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,306,Went for dinner yesterday around 6. We had what I can only say was the worlds worst service ever. They were expecting a large party which took the full dining room  party didn t arrive until we were leaving  so they were staffed to be busy. Our drinks from the bar didn t arrive until after our meal  a table of 6 was given 1 basket of chips and one small salsa  we sat in the 95 degree heat in a patio with water glasses empty until we paid our bill. Food was good. Service terrible. When we told manager our experience he agreed with us but instead of getting us our waters or drinks from the bar  disappeared. Terrible service.
El Arroyo 5th Street,307,Went here for brunch on Saturday after a grueling sesh at the gym...and was sassified once again. The regular  huge   menu is offered but they have additional items for brunch  a particular highlight being the tamale omelet. OM.. I totally dig the tamale breakfast taco at Maudies  but this is even better. They have ditched the tortilla in favor of smothering the tamale egg goodness in ranchero sauce. I got sausage instead of the side  and while there was a 75 cent upcharge  I got four patties which I couldn t even finish.   At  4.50  the frozen margsmade with real fruit   got me a strawberry swirl  are post-workout perfecto. Could have also indulged in a  2.50 mimosa or poinstetta  but the frozen hit the spot. The  beach  martinis looked amazing  will have to give it a shot next time. Date ordered a bloody and was unimpressed  but seemed to agree with the screwdriver.   He and I both had substitutions and the waitress rolled with it and kept her smile. We sat outside on the deck on the edges and soaked up some rays. Ahhh. Once a again  a five star experience.   PS. I have been here since my first review  but I was pretty gone  having spent the day drinking at Idiotarod. Needed something close to home with good food and drink. The Mexican martini I had didn t help my drunken state any  but the melt in your mouth food made me forget that I could hardly walk and had marshmallow and syrup in my hair. El Arollo always comes through 
El Arroyo 5th Street,308,I m writing to update my review owning to the fact that a new owner has purchased El Arroyo.   The food has changed slightly  but the quality of the ingredients and the finished product has improved.  This is especially evidence with the beef and chicken fajitas  which I usually order  traditional  style  meaning no peppers and onions in the skillet .     The word must be out  as El Arroyo seems to be getting more and more crowded for weekend lunches and dinners.
El Arroyo 5th Street,309,I used to live very close to this joint and every Sunday I would meet some friends here with their dogs.  The food was never very good but the dogs got to eat lots of leftovers so they were happy.  The margaritas were never all that great but they were really cheap so that was the main reason we came here other than the convenience and dog friendliness of the location.
El Arroyo 5th Street,310,Great Sign Out Front.    I can imagine the owner managers thinking up the next great slogan  while simultaneously watching the lettuce wilt and the meat go gray. Drop El-Up-Chucko from your to  do-do  list while you still have a functioning digestive tract .  Pros - Nice Patio. If all you wannado is get slightly  and I do mean slightly  tipsy on margarita-flavored slushies  and pig out on Tex-MEHx-ican  this is your wet dream come true over a stank-a   mud-pit.  Cons - The food  service  and pretty much everything else.  Old Austin  my hind-foot   Even on it s worst day   Taco Flats  wasn t this horrendous. OK  I ve said a colon-full.  LOL 
El Arroyo 5th Street,311,Terrible service. asked for salsa and water and ritas  only got the ritas. had to ask 3 different times for waters.  Food came out and we had no hot plate warning  my friend burnt his hand on the plate. The bill was different than it should have been and the watiress told us thats just how its going to be and dropped the bill back off. Not surprising considering I have horrible service every time  but you d think It would get fixed eventually 
El Arroyo 5th Street,312,I thought this was place was great. Our waitress was really nice and I enjoyed my meal. Actually  having leftovers for lunch right now. The only thing is that the outside tables look old  but most importantly the food was great.
El Arroyo 5th Street,313,Top notch tex-mex and for really cheap. I had queso  frozen margarita  both  2.75 during happy hour   enchilada dinner  9.99. You can t beat that. The chips and salsa were also great and both the server and manager were really nice and helpful. This will probably be my new go-to tex-mex.
El Arroyo 5th Street,314,Great folks  and also they have guac. Also  margaritas contain tequila  so that s a plus.
El Arroyo 5th Street,315,This is a beautiful Mexican restaurant located in downtown Austin. The first thing you see is the colorful atmosphere. The inside is not very big  but there is a lot of outside seating. The thing I liked the most was that they kept refilling our chips and salsa without us having to ask. The food however  was mediocre. They messed up one of our orders. I ordered the Cancun avocado without some of the toppings and they made it perfectly. The food took awhile  considering there weren t very many people there. It is also definitely overpriced. There are better  newer places in town.
El Arroyo 5th Street,316,The atmosphere at El Arroyo is just fine  and I really don t have much of a problem with the food here. It is what it is  and that s fine by me. While I ll never choose it  it s not like Trudy s where I ll put up a fight and refuse to go  even if it s like  say  someone s birthday. Yes  I hate Trudy s that much  but I digress.  It was nasty  cold and rainy on Friday night when I picked my friend up from the airport. As she lives in a part of the world with no Mexican food  Sydney  which  ironically  has no Outback Steakhouse either   and she used to live in Austin  she needed her fix  and needed it fast.  She had fajitas  I had flautas  and we split the white queso. She has a margarita  I had a beer  and then we went home. It was uneventful and unoffensive. Then we went home. Yep  that sums it up perfectly.
El Arroyo 5th Street,317,First off  let me explain why I come here  breakfast tacos. I work very close by  so it s ridiculously easy to pop in and grab some breakfast here. They have a nifty little tent set up out front  so you can just walk right up and get what you need. I get the migas tacos almost every time  but they are all tasty. Nothing super fancy or exciting  just a quick simple breakfast. Also  they make freshly-squeezed OJ  yum.  So that s breakfast. The actual menu for lunch and dinner isn t anything to get worked up about. It s pretty standard Tex-Mex  nothing yummy enough to write home about  but nothing yucky enough to stop you from enjoying yourself. The Fried Avocado is rather nice  stuffed with chicken and lightly battered. I won t be the one who chooses to come here for dinner  but if my peeps are here I ll definitely be here 
El Arroyo 5th Street,318,El Arroyo is fun for the lights  ambiance  the clever sign out front  etc.  but that s basically it. So  everything BESIDES the food is alright. Please don t call yourself a Mexican restaurant if you can t do Cinco de Mayo justice.  What I mean by that is  please plan ahead to have more wait staff  more efficient service  more things on hand if you re going to advertise your Cinco de Mayo specials everywhere. Please learn to cook your food so that the rice doesn t taste like it came from an Uncle Ben package. I received an email from the manager  saying they would have discounted drinks and enchiladas all day. Lucky for me  my boyfriend already said I could get as tipsy as I wanted  since I gave him the same courtesy on St. Patrick s Day  maybe we should find less degenerate ways to celebrate our ethnicities  . We came at around 7 pm  and things started off on a bad note when the hostess said she would be right with us  and clearly forgot about us for about 10 minutes. Idk where she was at. She finally greeted us and took our name because she saw me heading to the other hostess stand.   We went to the bar  since we would have a bit of a wait  and I ordered a margarita and my boyfriend ordered a mexican martini. The bar was SLAMMED. No problem - I figured as much would happen. However  I didn t figure that they would be only two bartenders  and that we would be made to feel bad for ordering the drinks they had on special. The female bartender was obviously frazzled  and in a quick exchange  my boyfriend s drink was spilled on the receipt printer. She made a pretty big deal about it  making a point to clean it so obviously  like he should feel guilty for that accident.   Luckily  a server led us to an open table  and said someone would be right with us. We waited.. and waited. We both finished our drinks before the server came to greet us. In her defense  she did offer queso or guacamole to make up for it. We took her up on the guac  because the last time we came we had spinach queso and it was plastic and rubbery. I took one bite and didn t touch it again. So  it takes quite some time for the guacamole to come out as well. We finally order  and again  it takes forever. He had the sour cream enchiladas  and I had the Santa Fe. We split them and had one of each. I only needed a bite of each to know I didn t like either. The only good part of my meal was that it came with a sunny-side up egg. Seriously. An egg was the best part of my Mexican meal. I ended up giving my plate to my boyfriend  and despite the fact that HE likes anything  he didn t eat the rice either.   As you can imagine  it took a while to get the check and pay for it. I used to think 99 cent margaritas were a good enough reason to come here  but honestly  there are so many BETTER places  for drinks  food  and service. If I m a customer who will tip upwards of 30   I don t appreciate being treated like I m a burden. I won t be back  and if any friends try to suggest going here  we ll easily find another restaurant  with better drink prices and edible food.
El Arroyo 5th Street,319,El Arroyo is pretty close to my place and I drive by everyday.  After more than a few chuckles at the marquee in the front I felt that I owed them at least a couple dollars and a  thank you  for putting a smile on my face before 8am.  In return  if they wanted to give me food as a  you re welcome   then all the better.  There was no wait on a Saturday night  the ambiance was fun  and the service was fantastic.   Unfortunately  this review is of a restaurant and I just think the food is not good.  We ordered guacamole as an appetizer and got more lettuce than avocado.  Yes it s green.  No it isn t what I want on tortilla chips.  Then my fajitas  which I rightly wrongly judge a tex mex place by  were average.  C mon fajitas can t be bad.  However my wife s ceviche was pretty poor.  Nothing that stands out as bad.  Just not a good dish.  The margs were also pretty weak.  All in all  not a bad experience  but this is a restaurant and therefore should be judged by its food.  There are so many better Tex Mex places in Austin.
El Arroyo 5th Street,320,Cliff s Notes  Horrific disappointment. Both locations under new management. New salty chips  they come that way  I was informedI found them inedible   poor service and uncooked food.  This used to be one of my favorite places for cheap Tex-Mex. I went Friday evening  06 22 12  and had a really disappointing dinner. I ordered The Wick Special. The food was delivered promptly  but I realized the enchilada was not what comes with this plate  was given beef  supposed to be cheese .  I flagged down the waitress  after multiple attempts   and she apologized and said she d take care of it and bring me the cheese enchilada on a separate plate. Great  She comes back with the cheese enchilada and proceeds to DUMP IT ON MY PLATE saying  oh this plate is very hot  I don t want you to burn yourself.   The enchilada was not cooked  and the cheese was cold and unmelted.  Not to mention I had a clear view of her spot in the back by the food window where I had noticed earlier that she was picking at customers  plates with her fingers and sampling it. Double gross.  The manager of course was very apologetic and proceeded to comp us for that plate  saying that they re under new management and training new employees.  Enough said. El Arroyo is not what it once was.
El Arroyo 5th Street,321,Stopped by for an early dinner after hearing this was the Bush twins favorite Mexican place in Austin...I m a sucker for even minor celebrity...anyway  the chips were average  the salsa was uninspiring  but our drinks  the Roya Rita and the Rosa Rita were really good.  Our waitress was very sweet  but our order  got lost  so we waited a long time for our food....no problem  we weren t in a rush  we were enjoying our drinks  and they brought us complimentary queso  which tasted like velveeta with chicken stock and pepper  but still  at least they made an effort to make up for the delayed order.  I order the Stuffed Zucchini which I thought sounded really different- plus  it was noted as an El Arroyo Favorite on the menu  that s basically celebrity status among the menu items...so I gotta have it   I assume in their hurry to fill our  lost  order they skipped the important step of actually grilling the zucchini as described on the menu.  So  I was served a raw zucchini stuffed with shredded chicken  covered in cheese and topped with 2 sauces  both flavorless and cold. They must have melted the cheese with a hair dryer because nothing else about the dish was warm and I don t know if you ve gnawed on raw zucchini before but it is not delightful.    Boyfriend had the pulled pork tacos...they were also cold and the pork seemed WAY over cooked and tasted vaguely of Aqua Net  hmm  maybe they are running a salon in the kitchen instead of actually preparing edible food   Anyway  great waitress  good drinks  bad food.  We probably won t be back- too many other great options around.
El Arroyo 5th Street,322,The only reason I frequent this location is I sold them a washer  amp  dryer and got  500 in gift cards.  It s usually fast  amp  cheap when your downtown.  I definitely miss the downtown location of Ninfa s.
El Arroyo 5th Street,323,They need to close this down. It used to be a great spot.  especially Thursdays  -- but now  the service is different.. the menu is way worse.. the happy hour food has been almost totally diminished. I could tolerate a lot of bad from this placed solely based on the menu  particularly the appetizers being decent. In fact  quesadillas and  1 margaritas were almost a Thursday ritual. Now it almost sickens me  and my coworkers to even attempt to go on any day. Hopefully things change for the better again soon.
El Arroyo 5th Street,324,I never do this  but if I could give less than one star I would. My friend and I came here for happy hour and waited 30 minutes for a table that we wanted outside and the hostess kept seating people in front of us. Then when we finally ordered  we only received half of our order and by the time we  were about to leave we ended up canceling the other half of our order... Not good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,325,Do not come on Cinco de Mayo.  Apparently they do not how to staff on such a holiday.  It s been an hour and they have not even come to our table with menus.  I spoke to the manager and he said they ll get to us when they can. Some way to treat customers.  Do not go here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,326,This is one of my favorite places to eat at in Austin  The food and the drinks are always spot on.  The Santa Fe Enchiladas are zesty and fun I ve had the chicken and pork and both are wonderful   My absolute favoriate though is hands down the BBQ Chicken Enchiladas.  The smoky and sweet sauce over the chicken is godlike. I even dip the chips in the left over sauce  its that good.  The sangria margritas are good  but I enjoy the strawberry ones. The prices are great as well.  Usually a few drinks plus appatiezer and dinner cost under  25.   The wait staff is on top of things I don t think I ve ever had an empty glass and that goes for the margaritas as well.  The food never takes long to get out and the servers are quick and attentive as well.  It really make eating out here a treat.
El Arroyo 5th Street,327,First time in Austin here on business. Co worker and I can for dinner and it was amazing. I loved the Cozumel dinner. Skirt steak was cook to perfection. Next time I m in Austin I will definitely come back here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,328,I raced the Winter Warrior in which my crew rowed 8.8km from dam to dam and it was around 32 degrees out there. There was frost and ice on the dock but no matter. My crew was going to race it. It s not called the Winter Warrior for nothing.  I was really hungry afterwards. Therefore  after a race like that  I don t discriminate what I eat and how it taste. As one of my crew members said   Don t question  Eat   I don t know if any competitors out there feel the same way but I do.  I enter the El Arroyo but I was confused about the layout. I thought the outside was the restaurant itself but I didn t realize there was the inside too. Duh. It was just right there   I had spinach and mushroom omelette with coffee and it was good. So I guess I really didn t get Mexican food here but I thought the food and the service was good.   Also it was a laugh that we were trying to figure out the portrait on the wall if it was Elvis or Neil Diamond. It was the owner who is dressed like Elvis because he is a fan. The owner is a nice guy who told us about the portrait. I thought that was really unique.
El Arroyo 5th Street,329,15 years ago - 10 years ago - 8 years ago I felt like I lived here and it was usually meeting my dad after work for happy hour and dinner. I met my  pain in the butt  boyfriend at the ditch two years ago for the first time. I don t know remember if I enjoyed the food then because I was so taken back by the company - you know  cute  funny  smart  all the stages we go through when meeting a potential long term partner.   So to fast forward we decided to meet there for lunch to celebrate our two year anniversary at the place we met. Maybe being together for two years changed the atmosphere  maybe El Arroyo has just changed  or maybe I have found better tex-mex food at many other places.   It is a great place for happy hour  a place to enjoy time with your friends or family  and the location is awesome. They have a sense of humor and there aren t many who can t enjoy the ever changing sign out front.
El Arroyo 5th Street,330,I want bbq. I want Tex-Mex.  Done. And. Done.  bbq enchiladas. pretty awesome.   had a frozen margarita...it was merely ok. nothing compared to jose s down my block in Chicago 
El Arroyo 5th Street,331,Look  it wasn t horrible.  Let s start with the good   lots of patio seating  no wait on a Friday night 7pm  the wait staff was great -- very friendly and attentive.  If I was looking for a place to hang out and drink with friends  I would totally go here.  We were there for dinner  and the dinner definitely qualified as  Meh   2 stars .  The waiter encouraged us to get the queso and it was basically a packet of Sargento cheese from the store microwaved till it was melted.  The result was a stringy disaster of a dish which we had to resort to using a fork in order to get it onto chips.  The entrees were edible  but nothing special.  It was kinda basic mexican food  but didn t really live up to the hype on the menu   Tamales drenched in cheese and chili  was more like 4 smallish lumps with a light brown sauce and some cheese on it .  Long story short  I wouldn t go out of my way to eat here.  Drinks   Perhaps.
El Arroyo 5th Street,332,Did you know El Arroyo on 5th sells something like 5 bazillion breakfast tacos every month   OK  so I m embellishing a little since that would probably be a record  but a recent Statesman article mentioned that they sell more from their roadside stand on a busy city street during morning rush hour than most any other place on earth.    I only mention this because El Arroyo  meaning  The Ditch   if marketing and memory are correct  is extremely versatile and extremely fun  which is why it remains so successful in a city full of  8 a plate Tex-Mex places.  The food at El Arroyo is good - rarely great  rarely bad.  But the margaritas are fantastic and the happy hour prices will get any night started off for just a few bucks.  The staff is usually happy and attentive and the management tends to walk the floor to make sure your dining drinking experience is up to par.   I would recommend El Arroyo more as an after-work happy hour spot than a Saturday night sit-down dinner spot.  However  with so many similar restaurants all over central Texas  the fact that El Arroyo stands out so well is a great testament to it s charm.
El Arroyo 5th Street,333,Despite the friendly waitress I had.... Worst salsa I ve ever had. Worst queso I ve ever had. Four dollars for a tiny cup of plain cheese   I might as well of melted some slices of cheese in my microwave. Worst fish tacos I ve ever had.  Extreme lack of flavor.  The only good part is that their fish is grilled rather than battered and fried. Not worth it...at all.
El Arroyo 5th Street,334,This is a vast improvement from what I would have rated this place a few months ago.   DISCLAIMER  This is just a drink review   I didn t really want to come here yesterday because I did not really like the margaritas last time I came. Luckily  I did not have a say in the matter  so I found myself sitting outside soaking in the wonderful weather.   Happy Hour on Thursdays is  1 margs from 5- 6. We were there a little late  so we slowed out drinking after the first round that was consumed in minutes. They were served in big cups  not the crappy little plastic things like last time  and the machine seems to be different because the texture is a lot smoother. The drawback with the margs though are that they were a little watery  but that could have been because they were sitting a little while before they got to us.   One really good thing that happened was that we were waiting on two friends to show up  and we were able to order them the margs with the special ahead of time  Great for them 
El Arroyo 5th Street,335,This review is just for the grab n go tacos.  I drive past this place pretty frequently  and I had never stopped in the morning until today.  I am in search of decent  convenient  and reasonably priced breakfast tacos on the run  so I gave in to my curiosity today.  The breakfast tacos are served out of a sawed off blue school bus booth  which is a nice touch.  I had no trouble parking in the lot right in front of the restaurant  but I could see how parking could be problematic on a busy day.  I pulled in  walked up  ordered two tacos  one migas and one potato  egg  and cheese  paid  3  including tax and was on my way.  I think the tacos run  1.39 for the standard menu items  plus tax  which in my mind is a pretty darn good deal.  They had the standard red salsa  it was good  but nothing to write home about.  The migas taco was good and tasty  but the potato  egg  and cheese was less impressive.  I am kind of a breakfast taco snob  favorites being Texas Honey Ham and Taco Shack   but I would stop back here because of the convenience  lack of wait time  and the price.  A solid choice if you happen to pass by here on your way to work.  If only someone would open a decent breakfast taco drive thru in Westlake or Downtown  I d be in hog heaven.  But until that day comes  this will do  every once and a while.
El Arroyo 5th Street,336,What a great experience we had. I ve been to El Arroyo about 20 times  but this may have been the absolute best visit yet. My girlfriend was visiting from out of state  and I wanted her to get a taste of great food and casual atmosphere  so this place was our choice for the day. She LOVED it. Callie was our sever  and she was absolutely wonderful. She was so sweet and attentive  which made for a great experience  but she also suggested a couple of items on the menu that were amazing.  That queso   I had a few different tacos  and loved them all. If I had to choose  I d say the al pastor was the big winner  but the others were excellent  too. Callie made our time very enjoyable  and kept serving us with a smile  We will be back as soon as possible  making sure to ask for Callie  and definitely have the BBQ chicken something. ANYTHING.
El Arroyo 5th Street,337,I have been a fan of El Arroyo since the early 90 s eating at the location on Greenville Ave which is now closed.   I get by to this one semi regularly.  I go to get the BBQ Chicken Enchiladas or the Federale Special which is now off the menu.  The enchiladas were about the same but the rice was awful.  The queso came out cold and lumpy.  I have eaten at this one on other occasions and it has disappointed as well.  This was once a great place now it is just ok.  Long live the great memories
El Arroyo 5th Street,338,My favorite place to go for mexican in Austin hands down  however they seriously need to work on their service. I ve been here at least 10 times and have received decent service maybe once. As long as they keep dollar margs on thursdays though ill always be back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,339,I go to El Arroyo often  mainly because I live across the street from it. If I didn t live so close  I doubt I d visit as frequently because parking seems near impossible in the area. And  frankly  this place isn t worth more than one visit  excluding Thursdays  during which it s totally acceptable to make numerous trips to El Arroyo for the famous  .99 margaritas .   Service is hit or miss  depending on when you go during the day and week. El Arroyo tends to be busier from dinner until closing. Thursday evening service isn t great  but you won t mind after a few margs.   The food is generally good. Nothing spectacular in a town where Tex-Mex is the  modus operandi - but nothing horribly priced or particularly bad either. I don t think El Arroyo tries to be anything other than it is  a decent pre-game dining opportunity before downtown shenanigans.   Food recommendations  queso especial  stuffed avocado  sour cream enchiladas  BBQ enchiladas  and the El Arroyo plate. Go on a Thursday. The margaritas really are worth it.  One more thing  You know the funny signage El Arroyo puts out on 5th St.  Well  a waiter told me once that they have to come up with at least 3 original ideas for that sign per shift. So when you go to El Arroyo  do your waiter a favor and come up with some funny sign ideas. Do it while you re still tipsy from the margaritas. Write them on your bill. I got a  5 coupon for doing it once. You won t regret it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,340,I ve been to this place twice. Service can be a little slow on busy nights  but I think they re short staffed right now. I was a little confused the first time I came. There s a sign that directs you to see the hostess inside and another sign that tells you to seat yourself. The chicken enchiladas with suiza sauce were sooooo good  You can t really taste the alcohol in the fruity margaritas  but you could definitely feel it later. There was a special going on so they were cheap too. The waiter was nice and gave good suggestions. He did his best to keep everyone happy and the place clean  while having a busy section full of college students.
El Arroyo 5th Street,341,There are lots of great options at this place--I try something new every time.... and  until we discovered Santa Rita s gluten-free menu and now split our mexican food time between the two places  my boyfriend and I would come here at least every two weeks   One of my favorite things is that they will substitute rice and beans for sauteed mushrooms  which are soooo yummy.  It s a fun young crowd  cool place with indoor and outdoor seating  and the humor of the place is awesome--I m lucky enough to  drive past their witty sign everyday.  My senior year at Austin High the sign said  Fish Fry--courtesy of AHS Seniors ... can t beat that localism     You can also rent out part of the restaurant for parties  my mom had her big 50th birthday party there it was awesome .
El Arroyo 5th Street,342,Only good thing about this place are the  1 Tecates every monday.  Smelly patio  food is sub-par. Service is elementary. Bathrooms are like a truckstop.  Thanks  but no thanks.
El Arroyo 5th Street,343,We ve been coming to The Ditch for 10 years now.  It s one of those  Only in Austin  kind of places.  The first time we had dinner there  we were on our first-ever visit to the Lone Star State.  I think it was in September  a UT Football weekend  and there were plenty of burnt-orange-clad peeps drinking margaritas out front.  I knew I had found the right place   The food is about average for Austin Tex-Mex.  Definitely not in the class of Curra s or Maudie s in my book  but it s good enough.  For the money though  it s a great value.  You do get plenty to eat and it won t break the bank.   Their margaritas are downright yummy--not too sweet  right amount of booze...I never miss a chance to have one when we eat there.  Chips and salsa are tasty--thin  crispy chips and their salsa is smoky and fresh.  Yum.  Fajitas are good  enchiladas are good....you won t be blown away  but it s decent.  The atmosphere is so fun.  There are two open-air patio areas--one with TVs on a deck  and the other is a covered stone patio.  There is indoor seating too with TVs.  You can bring dogs to the stone patio.  One downside to the Ditch is the parking situation.  West 5th has changed 100  in the time we ve been eating there  and the parking situation has gotten tight.  They do have space to park to the right of the restaurant on west 5th  and behind it.  Otherwise  you re stuck parking across the street by the Mean Eyed Cat and walking across  whcih kinda sucks.
El Arroyo 5th Street,344,So I tried this place for the first time today with a couple of friends  and I seriously don t get all the negative reviews.  First off  we went during happy hour  5-7  for the  1 margaritas and they were pretty good. Especially for the price  The ambiance was very casual and our server was really good. She chatted and joked with us while checking on us periodically.  Next  the  5 appetizers   again  it was happy hour  I ordered a quesadilla and some flautas and while they weren t amazing they were pretty darn tasty  Also  the nachos they give you at the start are simply amazing  Hot and crispy  Especially when combined with the chile con queso.   Overall it was a pleasant surprise and I do plan on coming back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,345,worst place i ve been in a while. first off their margaritas are terribly overpriced for the terrible quality of the drink. not only did we get ripped off  we got a margarita with a bug in it. while they replaced the drink no problem  it seemed like a bug in the drink was nothing new and no surprise to them when we told them. my buddy couldn t even finish his margarita after the new one because of how bad it was. will never visit again  thank you el arroyo
El Arroyo 5th Street,346,I came here for dinner with a group of friends last saturday night...Two of us had the Fajitas  and the other person had nachos...I went with combo fajitas chicken and beef...next time I d go all beef...service was good  and it was busy in there...chips and salsa were fresh too...  I struggled with 3 or 4 stars...3 won out because it just wasn t memorable...i wouldn t think oh lets come back to El Arroyo  but at the same time I wouldn t so no if someone wanted to go here...
El Arroyo 5th Street,347,This is an Austin classic  and they have always gone above and beyond  no matter WHAT walks thru that door  college student in a horse mask  not kidding  Thanks  guys  Keeping Austin Weird and great food to boot  Patrick is a lifesaver  
El Arroyo 5th Street,348,Hiked a while to get to this location under no ones fault but my own so was very thirsty when I got in. Sat in the outside patio with nice lamped heaters.   Chips  amp  Salsa were great and queso dip was what you would expect. Got a Tecate with a lime and my associate got a margarita on the rocks. Margarita was pretty sour tasting  Ordered the grilled Fish Tacos. They came pretty quick and were delicious with the two sauces that come with them. Service was great and we were in and out in a respectable time. Next visit I would like to sit in the main dining room.
El Arroyo 5th Street,349,My co-worker and I decided to meet at El Arroyo downtown prior to our department meeting. Although I had eaten at the Far West location in the past and had attended a UT football watch party at this location  I still spent some time on their website going over the online menu. BTW  make sure to turn your computer s speakers OFF or WAY DOWN before you visit the site as there is some pretty obnoxious music that greets you as soon as you hit  enter  on your keyboard  lol  It takes a few seconds to find the  mute  icon    What I did not find on their menu or through a Google search was whether or not they had a lunch menu. Upon arriving at the restaurant and being seated in the very cramped and noisy indoor dining area  they were limiting seating outdoors due to the heat   I confirmed much to my disappointment that they do not feature a lunch menu of any kind. Sure  I can pack away a full-size dinner portion of good Tex-Mex any day  but I know that doing so at the lunch hour on a work day means I am completely unproductive and sleepy for the next 4-5 hours. I highly recommend that El Arroyo consider pursuing a condensed lunch menu featuring their most popular dishes in smaller portions  perhaps even combining iced tea into the selections  much like El Mercado .   Nonetheless  I selected the popular and signature BBQ chicken enchiladas while my co-worker went for seafood and ordered the  Heavenly Shrimp . Although I did not sample his plate  he thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp which was complemented by a nice steamed vegetable medley of squash  broccoli  zucchini. My enchiladas were presented nicely with a side of beans  your choice of refried  black  or pinto  and Mexican rice. The chicken was unspectacular and somewhat inconsistent in texture from stringy to a bit tough. The complimentary chips are thin  warm and crisp while the salsa is thin and runny.   I was left with an overall  middle of the road  impression of the meal  despite being seated  served  and checked on promptly and efficiently. Much like other reviews of this location  I find myself not  wowed  or impressed by El Arroyo but also not opposed to returning for drinks and appetizers with a group during happy hour or for another UT football watch party.
El Arroyo 5th Street,350,I could make better TexMex at my house.  Or just try one of the dozens of fantastic options in Austin.  Not sure why you would subject yourself to such underwhelming food.  But worse  I have been vomiting up the food  pretty much within an hour of eating there.  Friends previously had pointed this out  across from Mean Eyed  warning me not to eat here  but today I was with a large group for a going away party.  Lesson learned.
El Arroyo 5th Street,351,The server was nice but not prepared for a large party  14 people . The food was mediocre at best. Meh.
El Arroyo 5th Street,352,I love this classic  Austin Tex Mex place   Everything here is great and the margaritas are the perfect compliment   Anything that contains their ground beef is going to be a winner  and you also can t go wrong with their queso and guacamole   Go with the basics here  cheese enchiladas  crispy beef tacos  chips  amp  salsa  rice  etc . May sound a bit boring  but they do an outstanding job on these core Tex Mex items and will surely deliver a great meal 
El Arroyo 5th Street,353,Bad service bad food bad hostess...glad we aren t forced to eat here again.  I m sad that I didn t choose taco cabana instead....
El Arroyo 5th Street,354,Nice cheap happy hour   2.75 frozen margarita people     Can t go wrong.  Lovely happy hour  0
El Arroyo 5th Street,355,Went for happy hour with a group of friends. This place is not worth your time. Service was marginal at best. If you are not from the US you will not get served. We had four friends from out of the country and even with a passport they were not served  Don t bother complaining  nothing will happen. Save your time and go somewhere else. If I could give El Arroyo zero stars I would.
El Arroyo 5th Street,356,Go to El Arroyo. The food is awesome and Colin is the shit. Came in on Christmas Day and he made our night  On a scale of one to ten  Colin is a a Willie Nelson. He is the Han Solo of the tex mex industry. Period. End of sentence.
El Arroyo 5th Street,357,Posting this wayyy after the experience  we went in fall of 2013 ... Weak margs  shitty tacos. My tacos were cold and the chicken was totally dry. Our waitress also had too many tables  poor thing.
El Arroyo 5th Street,358,I am a huge fan of El Arroyo.  first of all  the Happy Hour special on Thursdays  dollar margaritas from 5-6   is a huge plus. I believe they re around  3 from 6-7 for the rest of happy hour. still not a bad price   I always get the Flat Iron steak here and always split it with a friend. I personally find that it s a big portion for one person  especially if you are having margaritas and chips salsa   but it s always delicious. and it s only  15   The food and drinks here are always good and I definitely don t mind the prices. Definitely one of my fave happy hour spots in Austin 
El Arroyo 5th Street,359,Great happy hour spot with good mexican food and lots of outdoor seating.  Love a good frozen margarita and a hot day 
El Arroyo 5th Street,360,Meh - not my favorite Mexican food in Austin. Food was just ok  margarita was less than stellar  and our waiter was all over the place and obviously didn t care. With so many better food options in this area  I don t feel the need to ever go back to this place...
El Arroyo 5th Street,361,Bad food and didn t even eat half. Too much onions and our cups sat empty for awhile. Not the experience I heard I would get but he table next to me thought the food was bad as well. No bueno
El Arroyo 5th Street,362,You know what I love about Austin   We may not have the best Tex-Mex restaurants in the state  but gosh-darn it...these guys sure do make us try to believe it with all their heart.  You gotta love El Arroyo s enthusiasm   Plus 1 Star just for that alone.  Everything from their cool daily sayings on their street sign   The only crimson tide I know comes once a month  that s my favorite so far    all the way to the cool laid back attitude their wait-staff has.  A part of their deck sits on top of an old creek ditch  which gives it the name of El Arroyo and it makes for a great place to chill after a long day at work   Their happy hours here make it very enticing to skip the rush-hour crush and chill with a cold Dos XX instead.  It makes you want to scream  SCREW YOU MOPAC  I M HAVING A BEER  amp  NACHOS INSTEAD      Their menu here is incredibly well varied and goes a bit beyond your standard Tex-Mex fare that s available at most places.  These guys venture out in to the culinary landscape of Hispanic cuisine and pull out some unusual dishes.  The Tequila Chicken is really tasty and they actually flamb  real tequila on to the breast.  The Santa Fe Enchiladas have blue corn tortillas  are layered sort of like lasagna  add tasty pork  have a spicy ranchero sauce and they plop a big ol  fried egg on top   You guys remember the scene from  American Pie  where he has is WAY with the pie   Well  I want to do the same thing to their Pulled Pork platter.   This thing is sooo tasty    The original El Arroyo location is by far the best one of the bunch.  Try and get a seat outside on their patio deck  you ll love the big trees and the cool breeze.  If I see any of you guys doing nasty things to the Pulled Pork platter  I ll frikin  buy you a tequila shot 
El Arroyo 5th Street,363,Used to eat here three times a week. Moved out of the area and haven t been for a few years until twice in two weeks.   To keep it short...don t even think about it. Food sucks. Service sucks worse. Salsa is like ketchup and doesn t come unless requested.   Sorry to see an Austin landmark go  but they d be better off filling this ditch up with cement.
El Arroyo 5th Street,364,The best thing about El Arroyo is the sign out front. Service is bad and the food is equally disappointing. Too many other places to eat in Austin to waste your money here. Don t bother.
El Arroyo 5th Street,365,Other reviewers have already gone over the typical El Arroyo experience  terrible food  terrible service  great happy hour.  I would never go here to eat  but it s hard to find a better deal than .99 margaritas.  They have nice outdoor seating so it s a fun place to just hang out and have some cheap drinks.
El Arroyo 5th Street,366,We used to come here for Happy Hour back in college.  I have good memories however tequila induced they are....  Went here for dinner last night.  It was great   Service was fantastic.  Food very good and Mexican martinis were excellent.  Will definitely go back  hopefully sooner than 20 years from now.
El Arroyo 5th Street,367,I must give this place 3 stars only because of the  1 margaritas.  I mean  you really can t BEAT that   As for the food... I had their BBQ Chicken enchiladas  which weren t anything special.  It really seemed as if they just wrapped up some shredded chicken and topped it off w  some bbq sauce.  I also ordered their chorizo stuffed jalapenos  which sounded really great on the menu  but it came out to barely have any chorizo in it.  It was mainly cream cheese and pretty bland.  I wouldn t come for the food  but for the drinks and atmosphere  count me in.
El Arroyo 5th Street,368,Quite possibly the worst service in Austin. Food is also maybe worst Mexican in ATX but would be more tolerable if it were not for the incompetent staff. Not sure how this place is in business and has catering as well.
El Arroyo 5th Street,369,I have gone to El Arroyo multiple times  however this past experience was sub-par  they have a new policy that does not allow dogs on the patio  I am not sure if it was because of the earlier post regarding a poorly behaved dog   however Austin is a very dog friendly city and they are hurting their reputation with this new policy.   A group of us went to happy hour and we waited nearly 15 minute to receive each drink  at times there wasn t a single waiter waitress on the patio and the patio was nearly to capacity. We had switched waitresses three times. They didn t charge us for a few drinks because of the poor service. Every staff member seemed stressed and unorganized  I am not sure if they got new management.   Please get new chips  They have no flavor 
El Arroyo 5th Street,370,Signs are funny  food is decent  service is shit. Good enough to check out for novelty purposes.
El Arroyo 5th Street,371,Kyle is the bees knees  He provided us with such great service during happy hour this week. Couldn t say enough about the amazing service 
El Arroyo 5th Street,372,The signs may be inspired by Facebook graphics lately.  But the enchiladas are still quite praiseworthy. Long live The Ditch 
El Arroyo 5th Street,373,El arroyo is an austin staple. Front the witty sign out front to the amazing food. If you don t do there  you might as well have not even experienced austin.
El Arroyo 5th Street,374,One of my favorite spots in Austin with it s laid back family friendly atmosphere  helpful staff  and great food 
El Arroyo 5th Street,375,Went here with 10 of my family members last week for dinner. Service could have been better  took a while to get our drink order in and a long time to place our food order but once we did the food came out quickly. I got the stuffed avocado  I like Trudy s version better. The drinks were alright  nothing spectacular.  Would I go here again.... probably not  it was a funky place to take our out of town family but I prefer chuy s or Trudy s.
El Arroyo 5th Street,376,My roommate and I made this our first stop in Austin specifically for the  1 margaritas for happy hour. Yes  we had been stuck in a car for 3 hours to get to Austin and our first stop was a Mexican food restaurant just for the margaritas. We made it an hour before happy hour was over and managed to slurp down many  1 margaritas  4 for me  7 for my roomie .   We were then told that they were only going up  1 once happy hour ended at 6pm. So my roommate enjoyed more. We were sat on the patio. It was 104 degrees outside but the restaurant did their best to accommodate the patrons on the patio with a huge industrial fan kicking cool air out on high.   Besides the margaritas  we did eat. I order the chicken flautas which I didn t eat much of  probably because I was full with margarita. But it made the best late night snack later on after partying all night. I ll definitely be visiting this place again. 5 out of 5 stars. Great service  tasty food  and good prices.
El Arroyo 5th Street,377,Ok  so the first time I ate here was probably 1988 or 1989.  I m not a fan of some of their dishes.  I like spicy hot  I like greasy spoon ma  amp  pa Tex-Mex or Mexican you find south of Austin.    El Arroyo tries to play to the palates of the many  play to the city folk who didn t grow up on a farm near the border as I did.  I get that  and hey  at least it s WAAAAY better than having to settle for the disgusting excuse for Tex-Mex in Dallas or Lubbock  or heaven forbid having to eat some of the garbage west of the TX border.    Bottom line here..... can t go wrong with the tortilla soup. A bowl of that is a meal.  Can t go wrong with a margarita or the fajitas.  Don t expect a fine dining experience or the best waiters  but go with some friends and have a couple of margaritas  tortilla soup and fajitas.   You ll be OK.
El Arroyo 5th Street,378,Short staffed  flustered waitstaff.  Ordered 2 enchilada meals for 2 people and waited more than 45 minutes for food.  Food was average.  If this place wasn t sort of a downtown Austin icon  wouldn t have gone in the first place but probably won t return.
El Arroyo 5th Street,379,Well I enjoyed it. Good food  good atmosphere  good service  comfortable environment. Couldn t ask for more.
El Arroyo 5th Street,380,This place lacks common courtesy  respect  and the understanding of customer service. If I could give this place zero stars I would.   Upon walking in to the restaurant  we came upon our server who was less than pleased to serve us. I really feel that it was discrimination as we were a diverse group including 4 African Americans  3 Hispanics  and 1 Caucasian  all women age ranging from 24-25 .  We showed up on a Thursday for  1 margaritas and to celebrate my birthday. Unfortunately the fun filled night hit an obstacle when the waitress  April  gave us issues with our Idententification cards. It is interesting because our Caucasian friend did not have an issue  but everyone else had  issues  as the waitress looked over each card for a good minute.   When she looked at my ID which is a state issued drivers license  she said she needed to take it to the manager. After being gone for approx. 5 minutes she came back saying that her manager wanted another form of identification. I asked her  why did the manager need to see another form of ID and she could not answer that. I also asked what was wrong with my ID and why that was not sufficient. She also could not answer that. At that point I asked to speak to the manager.   She left again and then came back after another 5 minutes. She acting as if there had been no issues and was finally ready to take our drink orders  but she did not bring the manager or explain to me what the issue was with my ID. I then asked again for the manager.   The manager came over  a male and said that there is  no discrimination going on and if he did not want to serve me he would just tell me to leave  and he went on to say that he needed other forms of ID because if we left the restaurant and something happened then they would be responsible. I do not feel that to be a vaid reason as none of the other patrons who where Caucasian had to go through a long investigation process once they presented their ID. The conversation was going no where so I asked the manager for the General Manager and he never showed up. I left angry and upset that I was not able to get respect.
El Arroyo 5th Street,381,Half of the staff was very friendly the other half was neglectful. Its a college bar. Food is ok  but you could wait a while for it - if you even get it. Won t be back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,382,Horrible service. Horrible experiences. I give up. I want to like this place  but it always disappoints. The table was sticky  and there was hot sauce spilled all over the booth where we were seated. Then we couldn t seem to get any menus. Joey the waiter  worst. waiter. ever.  comes to ask us if we are ready to order. Me   we need some menu s please . Ten minutes later Joey comes back    So  what can I get for you . Me   menus   Joey   oh  yeah  I forgot . The food was ok  but nothing memorable  except for the length of time it took our waiter to do anything . The dogs fighting on the porch were kind of entertaining  I guess. At least the cockroach crawling across the ceiling seemed to think so.
El Arroyo 5th Street,383,Horrible  how does this place stay in business   Ordered the pork pastor enchiladas  most of the pork was gristle and tasted terrible.  The Mexican rice was bland and as were the refried beans.  Only gets two stars since the guacamole tasted fresh but no seasoning or spice to it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,384,We ate here while visiting Austin for a day.. we heard it was an Austin  staple . The food was good  and the cheese dip was great  The atmosphere seems to be the real draw. I imagine that during warmer weather the patio is packed. I ll go back for sure  next time I m in town.
El Arroyo 5th Street,385,As a person who worked in the service industry for years  I am very friendly and generous to people in this industry. I recently had the worst food and service I ve ever had. The worst part was I took my two out-of-town guests to El Arroyo expecting the same wonderful experience I had on July 4th. Unfortunately   I was wrong. The waitor was training someone who we never saw the entire time we were there. Yet he introduced her at the beginning of our meal. The waitor himself had scabs on his hands and arms that were unkept. He took our orders and messed up all 3 orders. He never checked with us on how our food was. Our empty drinks were left unnoticed. We had to flag down other people to help us  while we watched him flirt with the hostess and check his phone. I can t tell you how unappealing the food looked and tasted. The drinks were very weak.   I would suggest heading down to Maudie s off Lake Austin instead. That location may not have curb appeal  but it has drinks you ll enjoy  food you ll love  and good service 
El Arroyo 5th Street,386,As far as Tex-Mex joints within walking distance to my apartment go  El Arroyo on 5th is OK. The patio is nice  we went for dinner and while it was empty when we got there during happy hour  it filled up almost completely by the time we left.   The chips were a little dry  but the salsa tasted fairly homemade and made it better. The sour cream enchiladas were a little much  but the chicken tasted fine and the sour cream and lime juice did make them something a little different.   As far as the margaritas go  I didn t think they were as weak as people said they are here. Also happy to report I didn t see any of the oft-chronicled cockroaches or undercooked meat.   A cool spot to go for happy hour or with a big party  if you re in the area and in the market for a cheap meal.
El Arroyo 5th Street,387,I have been wanting to try out this place for a while. I always see how busy they are and they have been around for ever. My husband and I decide to try it out for his Birthday Lunch. Wednesday at 1pm lunch was not crowded so great  Chips were bottom of the barrel bits and pieces and requested another basket and it was the same. Lunch came   food was dry  rice and the sizzling fajitas were served on a cold plate and the patio was dirty. Maybe it was an off day..... They have been around for awhile.
El Arroyo 5th Street,388,The food here is quite delicious and hits the spot when you want some good old tex mex with a variety of well cooked ingredients and don t want the high class fancy Mexican food you can get at other places. I got the Del Mar enchiladas which had quite a good amount of the blue crab in them for flavor as well as a good combination of sour cream  cheese  and seasonings. The rice was cooked very well and not too salty and the beans were seasoned very well. The salsa was delicious with just the right amount of spice and the chips were crisp and not to thick or thin.   The service on the other hand was horrible. I think our server did just about everything a server should not do. She did not refill waters  did not refill salsa  had to go back and ask the kitchen about EVERYTHING we asked her. I asked if there were different bean options other than refried beans to which she said  No  when it is clearly marked on the menu they serve black beans I was more curious if they had charro or borracho beans and was hinting at her offering me a list of beans they offer  but her  no  reply ended that venture . She spoke English but her speech was very poor as in she mumbled and did not speak clearly at all and I found myself asking her to repeat herself every time she spoke. I asked about the margaritas and which would ones were frozen and she said none. Then I said it specifically states on the drink menu that one of the margaritas came frozen  she went back to the kitchen and came back and said the HOUSE margaritas with a flavor shot are frozen. I did not know until after she brought the drink that you can also order the house margaritas without a flavor shot which is an extra  2. She also did not even mix the margarita and flavor shot at all  you could see the whole flavor shot at the bottom of the margarita in liquid form and the frozen margarita above it a completely different color. We then waited 15 minutes with no servers or staff at all in the main restaurant area to ask for our check. To add  there were 2 other tables in the whole inside area  one was a single and the other was a couple.
El Arroyo 5th Street,389,I like this down town austin bar Mexican restaurant. It s not the best Mexican food but pretty decent. Atmosphere is relaxed and actually more casual American like than Mexican food environment. I honestly don t even know if they were playing tejano. Waitstaff super relaxed.  Service was so so. Pretty good 3 star place to go to happy hour with friends with a relaxed environment  Definitely not a date place AT ALL .  Their margarita skinny is fantastic. I hear the happy hour goes till 7 with he priced menu items. Sa-weeeeet.
El Arroyo 5th Street,390,Good food  reasonable prices and a fun atmosphere.  I worked a couple blocks away for 6 months and would get their  1 breakfast tacos almost every morning. I d eat in for lunch about once every week or two. I went back for the first time in a couple months today and it is every bit as good as I remember.  I love the black bean burger and sweet potato fries. I don t know what rachel m. was on when she reviewed the chips and salsa. I mean  yeah the chips are a little greasy  but that s because they are still hot and fresh out of the fryer  Crispy and delicious if you ask me  and the salsa is a prime example of taqueria style  flavor to spare and enough spice to satisfy even those of us who like it hot.  The only real complaint I ve ever had was that without asking you only ever get one napkin. In my opinion if someone orders finger food  or if you serve chips and salsa  you should have some extra napkins on the table. A minor complaint to be sure  but if they read this maybe they will get the hint.
El Arroyo 5th Street,391,Let s see  I ve found better Mexican food in Denver  amp  the crowd is amateur hour at its finest.......... This is really an Austin treasure   
El Arroyo 5th Street,392,Seriously  one of the worst restaurant experiences ever  I used to come here in my 20s all the time and loved it  but maybe I was just drunk on cheap margaritas  The server  who was either stoned or hungover  didn t come for 20 minutes  always great with two young children . Service was horrible  the restaurant was dirty  the food was very late coming and unremarkable at best. The bathrooms were FILTHY which stressed me out to the max with a 3 year old. No toilet paper and all of the toilets but one were clogged. And of course  we had to wait ages for the check. Adios  El Arroyo 
El Arroyo 5th Street,393,Do yourself a favor  amp  do not stop for the breakfast tacos in the morning. They only ever have 1 employee selling them in the morning  amp  if you don t have cash you re out of luck because the credit card machine doesn t ever work.
El Arroyo 5th Street,394,This was my FAVORITE Tex-Mex place in the entire world. We even hosted our rehearsal dinner here  It used to have fantastic food  my favorites were the cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas . Now  even the salsa and guac have gone downhill  and they have virtually half the menu they used to. I m so unbelievably disappointed 
El Arroyo 5th Street,395,Went in while Ritas were on special for 99 cents which was awesome and they were good but they the ONLY good thing. Service and food are horrible. They were not busy and visibly fully staffed  some waitstaff were sitting around chit chatting  yet we still had a long wait for everything  We weren t greeted or even acknowledged for about 10 minutes after walking in and being seen by several staff members. Food is disgusting. I don t understand how they ve managed to maintain business with their dishes. Tried the stuffed zucchinid and my friends had a burrito plate and stuffed avocado. All not good. The style is VERY TEX-mex. Doesn t really have much Mexican flavor at all. So all in all go for a decent cheap drink when you time to kill but definitely don t eat here 
El Arroyo 5th Street,396,Service was awful. There was something wrong with everyone s food that came out to our table. We found a HUGE bone in a chicken enchilada. It was just a huge disappointment form what we were all use to from this location. I will say though  even though it was awful service  their customer service was outstanding and we all ended up leaving happy.
El Arroyo 5th Street,397,I ve been to El Arroyo a few times.  It s usually disappointing.  I ve had bad service  weak drinks  and the food is average.  Once I was seated at one of their outside booths and saw a huge rat running along side the creek that runs thru their outside seating area.  Another time my gf left behind her shaded.  We went back within an hour and the shades were gone.    I haven t been back in over a year and don t plan to ever going back.  There are to may great tex-mex and Mexican restaurants in ATX to waste your time or money here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,398,First time to eat here. My family and I enjoyed the food  the waitress we had was very attentive. Had heard negative things about the restaurant  but we did not find anything bad here. We will definitely be back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,399,I m biased. I ve been coming here and loving it for years  It s a great brunch spot. Migas and a Bloody Mary to kick off your Sunday Funday  Yes  Mam  They used to serve some fried nopalitos  but last couple times they didn t. Anywho  servers are so good here  They are on the freakin ball  I was a sad bear to find out my del Mar enchiladas contained fake crab  even though that was not indicated on the menu      But my server fessed up right away and told me how to get the real deal next time I come. I love the back side porch. Something about a few out of place chandeliers just makes me smile.
El Arroyo 5th Street,400,ATTN  Owner  Start reading reviews  You are in a prime location with terrible food  outdated menus  and out of everything  The BBQ enchiladas were meat  tortilla and bbq sauce and chicken tortilla soup had zero flavor...Get it together  The only thing going for you is location and great service... maybe diablos too 
El Arroyo 5th Street,401,This restaurant went from great to bad to never going back. I m not sure what made them change their menu  but I ve commented on it to the manager a few times  I wanted to give them a chance to redeem themselves  and he seemed less than interested in what I had to say  even though he comes to the table to ask why I ve returned the dish. Anyway  this was a regular Sunday brunch visit for us  but we have found a new place and will not be returning. I m pretty sure a lot of people will do the same.
El Arroyo 5th Street,402,Food was nice. Ordered a plate then they came back after a while saying they were out. We took our service dog and we had trouble sitting outside. They had to call management then they said it was okay and are even going to allow pets again. The price was good too
El Arroyo 5th Street,403,This place is great  especially for dollar margaritas  or two dollar doubles  on Thursdays. The food is average slightly above average. I ve never been really blown away by any of their dishes  but the food has always been solid. The staff is great.
El Arroyo 5th Street,404,Was one of my favorites. Service last night was horrific. Understaffed. Waitress would be gone for 15 minutes at a time. Several tables just left. We were already committed. Sadly this is a very common experience for others per the reviews.
El Arroyo 5th Street,405,Absolutely delicious BBQ chicken enchiladas.  The staff were very friendly and helpful - can t wait to go back 
El Arroyo 5th Street,406,What happened to this place   I remember it being pretty decent the last time I went  about 2 years ago. I should ve known it s gone downhill when we walked in at 8pm last Saturday night and not even a quarter of the restaurant was full.  I was not impressed this time. Chips and salsa was totally bland  and my ceviche was the worst I ve ever had- chewy  rubbery fish  and wasn t served very cold. Everyone else got fried appetizers. I don t really know how you can mess those up  but they weren t impressive at all. I d rather have gone to Chili s if I wanted something like that.  It s a shame such a great space is going to waste.  I won t be back again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,407,As promised in a previous review  if Arroyo is again dog-friendly  our group will come back through the doors and give it a second chance.   Don t pull this ish again  Ditch   The food is decent when it shows up.  The big hiccups the last several times we ve been there have been around the service.    Food is often a long time coming to the table  if at all.  Managers on duty have been kind enough to comp items  provide a free drink  or gift certificates to make up for the short-coming.    I d rather just have my food the first go-round  as I m sure the owner would prefer that  as well.  The service is costing the business money on many levels.  The atmosphere is fun  but Thursdays are definitely loud and made up of  1 drink crowds... If you go on Thursdays  you get what you pay for  both in food and ambiance.
El Arroyo 5th Street,408,Again another positive remark I need to make.  I have been going to El Arroyo for the last 25 years and have seen the changes.  From my experience s  if you let them know exactly what you want  you will get what you ordered.  You cannot expect them to not put something on your food unless you ask for it as they cannot read your mind.  Case in point  I always want the grilled chicken and vegetables without any oil and or additives of any kind and that is what I get.  And for icing on the cake they always serve plenty of steamed vegetables 
El Arroyo 5th Street,409,Went there to celebrate my friend s birthday last night. We were treated very badly. My friend who is well of age was told that her TX DL was fake and asked to show a second form of ID by the waitress named April. April also said that the manager is who told her to do this as we walked into the restaurant. After speaking with the manager who could not explain why they were treating us so badly nothing was resolved. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
El Arroyo 5th Street,410,I used to be normal  like you. I used to eat meat. But then  after a series of really bad culinary experiences  I became one of those weird vegetarian people. Vegetarian  not vegan - I m not an F in freak  just kidding - you know I love you guys . I still ate dairy and eggs and stuff  just nothing with parents  which included seafood... except for El Arroyo s Enchiladas del Mar  that is. That s right - I made an exception for these guys. I totally cheated. I ate Enchiladas del Mar even after I went vegetarian. That s how good these things are. They made me reconsider my own personal convictions. So F in good. Can t vouch for anything else on the menu  I ve never had anything else  can you believe that  I lived in Austin for more than decade  probably ate at this place a hundred times  and I ordered the same thing every time. Enchiladas del Mar. So good. So worth the trip.
El Arroyo 5th Street,411,Not nearly the food before management changed. Order was brought out wrong and had a hair in plate
El Arroyo 5th Street,412,Nice Austin-like locale. Bad service during happy hour and really normal food. Plenty of better places around. Sad because the only thing going for it  which is its iconic place in Austin  calls for a better restaurant.
El Arroyo 5th Street,413,I could kick myself for the amount of times my boyfriend wanted to eat here and i said lets go someplace else. So finally I give in and am in love with this place. They claim the Enchiladas Del mar are a religious experience. I don t care what religion it is  I m converting. The queso is good but I ll pass on it next time so I don t leave any enchiladas behind. The Mexican martini packs a kick and should probably be shared if you are driving. My new favorite Tex Mex  hands down. Oh and the prices are very reasonable.
El Arroyo 5th Street,414,Where the hell do you park    After finding a place  we waddle into this restaurant that sits over a ditch  which I admit is pretty damn cool.  The decor and atmosphere were top notch in my book except the State of Rhode Island-sized fans that sit 31 inches  yes I measured  from my table.  After my chip basket blew away for the 2nd time  we decided to move seats to a more comfortable  less Wind-Tunnel-ish area.    After waiting close to 15 minutes  our waitress comes and greets us and takes our orders.  The Margaritas were ok  and the beer was somewhat warm.  This is Austin right  What gives   We ordered some Queso which in all fairness rocked  However  when my entree arrived  my high from the Queso was gone.  I thought I ordered carnitas  but after looking at my plate...not so much.  The correct way to cook carnitas is a slow slow process.  You shred pork and low heat cook it in a spicy sauce...for hours.  See  the timing is important because cooking pork that slow will make it so tender a spoon can cut through it.  Not to mention the immense flavor.  Well...my plate was cubed pork that I couldn t cut through with a CUTCO steak knife.  Trying to chew through the fat and gristle was another thing.  This was the worst representation on Carnitas I have ever seen  and trust me  I have seen some bad ones.    I should have expected a Tex-Mex place to not be able to m ake an AUTHENTIC Mexican Dish  but I was trying to be a believer in miracles.  I guess I ll just leave that up the Big Man instead from now on.  Even He would have a hard time making those carnitas good.    Its bad whenever Queso can save a restaurant from getting the dreaded 1 star.
El Arroyo 5th Street,415,This place is pretty good. I go often because it is close to my office. The staff is friendly and helpful  the food is fresh and tasty  and the sign out front is usually good for a smile. Also  in the mornings  you can buy a burrito from the nicest young lady who ever sold breakfast out of a bus 
El Arroyo 5th Street,416,Good Mexican  nothing great. Dog friendly on the Patio  that is the reason we cam here. Margaritas are good  not outstanding. Faster service. Parking could be a problem during busy times. Unlimited chip and Salsa.  Good location.
El Arroyo 5th Street,417,Terrible experience   The staff acted irritated to help my party find a table.  Our waitress was nice but they seemed very short handed.  Due to our experience when we walked in  we almost left instantly.  This sucks because I live by here and can walk.  I won t be coming back   Very embarrassed to take my out of town guest.
El Arroyo 5th Street,418,This place used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Austin  even better than Chuys in my opinion. Food was always excellent and quickly prepared  staff was always friendly and fun to be around and always had that quirky Austin spirit....then it got new management and it has gone down hill since. Food is gross and isn t  warm when brought out. It took over 45 minutes to get our food today and it wasn t busy. Staff is NOT friendly. I think they replaced all of the old new with new employees who don t smile  take their time for everything  and don t talk to you nicely. Today  my friend got a burrito  after that entire wait  it was cold. She had the guy bring out a new one  it was still cold. The manager comes by and has the nerve to say how to order it and tells us that lettuce will make it cold.... don t think that is the case. It was almost offending.   Sadly we won t be coming back here until something changes for he better. Sad to see this great restaurant go under because of the stupid people running it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,419,I want to start by saying that the service is always great at El Arroyo.  But come on guys  that is what goes for pancakes at brunch around there.  Literally  there was about 67 cents worth of food in three of the smallest pancakes I have ever seen served.  Call them  Silver Dollar Pancakes  and throw about 40 on a plate for breakfast.  In a town where places like Dan s and Kerby Lane weight the plate down on a small stack you gotta do better. Next  tortillas are supposed to be warm.  That little thing you put them in is supposed to keep them warm.  It does not warm them up.  When corn tortillas are cold  they taste like cardboard and are about as flexible.  Migas are good but not rolled in a cardboard box.  So here s the lesson.  Pay attention to the food.  You are an institution in this town  you need to act like it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,420,Love the food and drinks   We used to love taking our dog there  but now we can t thanks to an irresponsible dog owner.  Please don t let one bad person ruin it for the rest of us.  Enchiladas del mar are awesome   And  try the queso with mushrooms   Bring back the dogs with responsible owners  
El Arroyo 5th Street,421,The Ditch has really gone downhill. The last two times I ve been there  quite frankly has sucked. The salsa is truly lame now. It s not spicy at all. Chopped tomatoes and onion... Boring   I usually get the sour cream chicken enchiladas  but not this time. Unfortunately I got the Enchiladas Del Mar. The menu should say   artificial crab meat and 2 small shrimps. Extremely horrible indeed. The flour tortilla that all the artificial swill was in  was warm at best. The plate was waaay hotter.  I ll never go back to El Arroyo. There are too many better Mexican places to go to in this city.  At least... tell your customers it s fake crab   Jesus....    2 Thumbs Down.
El Arroyo 5th Street,422,ok  so super cheesy greasy tex mex food should probably never get above 3 stars. if you disagree with that statement  go ahead and imagine another star just for you on my rating.  el arroyo serves up standard tex mex that is just above the mendoza line most food of this genre hovers around.   their BBQ-chicken-anything is good - and that s not your standard fare. i think they have bbq chik enchiladas  burritos  some plate o  mound o  cheese and stuff.  the hidden gem here is their bargains. happy hour has been extensively discussed here - but did any one mention that breakfast tacos are just a buck  and juice too  you can get 2 tacos and a juice for 3 bucks. that s  3 even.  no change. tax is included. there aren t too many places around where you can eat for 3 dollars - well - places that i won t mention by name but start with mc and end with donalds.  this ain t the four seasons  but it is solid food. good greasy  cheesy  tex-mex. you know what you re getting into  right    oh and monday or tuesday night they have 2 for 1 burgers. and monday or tuesday night  they have 2 for 1 cheese enchiladas. call to confirm.
El Arroyo 5th Street,423,Five stars for the morning breakfast tacos  but for the sub-par dinner food I had to dock a couple. Seriously  though  about the breakfast tacos. Maybe it is the convenience -- it adds about 30 seconds to my commute to pick them  up -- or maybe they re just that good  I ll probably never know. I could do without ever eating dinner here again  but seriously -- try the breakfast tacos.
El Arroyo 5th Street,424,I ve been dining at el arroyo for many years and always remembered it as the pinnacle of cheap good Mexican food. Perfect for a town like Austin with all the hippies and students  but it s just not as good as I remembered. sure it s cheap really cheap. I mean everclear Margaritas and queso made from something worse than velveeta  but it just isn t delicious anymore. Maybe my palate has changed with age or maybe I m just not drunk enough  but I was certainly disappointed.
El Arroyo 5th Street,425,I was in need of a taco one Sunday evening and I decided to give this location a call. I ordered 2 beef fajita tacos. I get arrived and the staff was very friendly. My order was available quickly. I devoured the tacos so fast I really can t remember chewing. Everything went down so well and satisfied my hunger craving.
El Arroyo 5th Street,426,Went with my sister and we had a blast  great service  good food  I had the green chili chimichanga  did I spell that right   and it was awesome  Two words  DOLLAR MARGARITAS    
El Arroyo 5th Street,427,If upon moving to a new town you re looking to score drugs and get laid go to the methadone clinic or an NA meeting.  If you re looking to score decent Tex-Mex and enjoy a sunny afternoon on a cheerful patio  go to El Arroyo.
El Arroyo 5th Street,428,Pretty awful. 7 45 on a Wednesday the place is practically empty  should have taken a hint. Wife orders a marg with sangria  they re out of sangria. We both order one of the custom margaritas instead  waitress spills one on me  it happens  but then she forgets to come wipe up the mess on the table. No big deal as they are awful anyway. We order ceviche  they re out of ceviche  excuse is a busy weekend  it s freaking Wednesday . Food arrives  plates are hotter than the food  how did they do that  Food is bland in addition to being somewhat cool  just overall seems like poor quality stuff. Bill comes  ceviche they didn t have is on the bill. Whole experience just kind of bad and gross. I don t remember El Arroyo ever being especially great  but it was always at least passable and fun. Things have clearly slid. Pretty much your standard Austin tourist trap. Take a picture by the marquee  but eat somewhere else.
El Arroyo 5th Street,429,The salsa is always good at the ditch. The service can be spotty  but it seems the new look has brought a new attitude to the wait staff. Migas and napalitos  fajitas  and the enchiladas del mar are great choices. Can t go wrong with this Austin original.
El Arroyo 5th Street,430,Amazing Food   Highly recommend the Tre s Plate Chicken with avocado and green chile sauce. The Flautas are amazing also. Service was good and very friendly.
El Arroyo 5th Street,431,My first experience here hooked me - a Sunday morning my younger sister just delivered her second child and the whole family gathered here after many hours in the birthing room minus new niece and mother of course..  No one judged my Saturday night Party attire which I had slept in.  I got here late so I finished off all the left-overs Fajitas good  cheese enchiladas good and the waiter warmed up the spinach queso for my enjoyment. I have made many repeat returns for Mexican yummy cheese goodness... Love Cheese eat here and be Happy 
El Arroyo 5th Street,432,After a long weekend  Flugtag will wear you out    we decided to have a last lunch in Austin before we headed home and met some people at El Arroyo.  As I ve mentioned probably half of my reviews  I m not a fan of Mexican food.  So I ordered some generic flauta dish and it was good  still Mexican.  But the queso were pretty impressive.  Some people at the other end of the table ordered the spinach queso  let me add at this point that I m not a spinach fan  and I ve never heard such noises coming from outside a bedroom.  There was some serious loving going on.  So of course  we wanted to join in on the fun.  Heaven.  The spinach strangely goes perfectly with the queso.  And it is that creamy  delicious white queso that you don t find often.  The chips were already perfectly salted so we didn t need to take our focus away from eating.  Good times  good food  happy camper.
El Arroyo 5th Street,433,you can grab decent breakfast tacos from a stand out front in the early morning. The food is solid  not my favorite tex-mex around Austin  but it is definitely better than at some overated places guerro s comes to mind . Cheap but good margaritas 
El Arroyo 5th Street,434,I took a date here a couple of weeks ago and had a great experience. The manager happened to be at the host stand and was very friendly and was able to seat us out on the veranda  we didn t even have to wait   Our server was also very friendly and attentive. Our orders came out pretty quickly and we both thought the food was awesome   I m glad I found a restaurant in Austin that has both amazing food and service  will definitely be back again 
El Arroyo 5th Street,435,An iconic Austin institution.  Good Tex-Mex  good Ritas.  Although I haven t been since Clay sold it.
El Arroyo 5th Street,436,Margs are great  margs are good especially here. And especially on Thursday. Can t beat tHe price. BUT tHe service outside was completely AWFUL AND DOWN RIGHT TERRIBLE. I think tHe waitress  name was Mallory but I honestly would not know because we sat outside for 30-45 min and she never greeted us. EVEN THOUGH SHE DEFINITELY SAW US MULTIPLE TIMES. She is an awful waitress and I m surprised she was hired. I can go on and on about this horrendous service...BUT what REDEEMED tHe night was tHe manager. AMAZING AWESOME PERSON. I literally cannot speak highly enough of this man. He is tHe absolute GOAT. tHe only time she actually addressed as human beings was to ask for our salt shakers and to let us know tHey we re closed. Other than that if I hadn t reached out to tHe manager of this fine establishment  I would have not been served until now... and that was two hours later. tHe food is great and tHe margaritas are great... but we had an awful experience witH this server.
El Arroyo 5th Street,437,I live really nearby and had never visited because I was put off by the poor reviews. Hubs and I decided to make the trek and found the staff to be very kind  we were getting takeout  and the food to be perfectly fine. No  the queso and salsa weren t amazing  but their salsa verde is good  and the tacos al pastor were everything we expected. And they have 99c margaritas on Thursdays. And their signs are funny  which is why we went in the first place. Don t expect life changing food  but there is friendly service and a good atmosphere.
El Arroyo 5th Street,438,First of all  we went on a Thursday night and even though they were crazy busy  our waitress was still very friendly and got us our margaritas  only  1 on Thursdays  very promptly. They were better and bigger than I thought they d be for a  1. The food was basic tex-mex  but reasonably priced. The chimichanga  my brother got was really good. I ll definitely go back  especially for the cheep margaritas.
El Arroyo 5th Street,439,I had a great lunch here yesterday. The tortilla soup was delicious and the service was great.
El Arroyo 5th Street,440,Came here for lunch with my co-workers lat week  WAS NOT IMPRESSED. The restaurant was empty  a couple people enjoying the beautiful weather outside on their patio. Our food took about 30 minutes to come out  we were starving by this point  again empty restaurant  I ordered their chicken stuffed fried avocado. I took a nice bite out of it and spit it out  When I started to check on the avocado they used an old  brown  nasty tasting avocado. I WAS SO UPSET  How can a restaurant give a customer and OLD AVOCADO. It was so nasty. The waitress was nice  but I cant stand when people call me baby a million times   I am sorry baby  you want something else baby . The manager didn t even come out to apologize for the food. They did remove my food from my bill but charged me  1.95 for my tea  I don t expect freebies but dang  food was late  service horrible  nasty food  and your going to charge me  1.95 for my tea. My co-workers were not thrilled about their food either. Safe to say I AM NOT GOING BACK 
El Arroyo 5th Street,441,This review is based totally on their  1 breakfast tacos Monday-Friday.  The price is right  the food is fresh and damn those Migas tacos are tasty  Oh god...SO GOOD    Damn me for moving up to Dallas and damn you El Arroyo for not having a taco stand down the street from my house in Dallas  I miss those migas tacos.  - 
El Arroyo 5th Street,442,We stopped in at El Arroyo on NYE to get some Tex-Mex that would help fuel our alcohol induced plans for the evening. For the money  I wasn t disappointed.  We showed up a little before 8 30  they closed at 9  with 5 of our party of 8. They sat us and didn t mind us not ordering until the rest of our group showed up a little before 9.   I couldn t decide between the shrimp or fish tacos. Naturally I asked for both and they let me go with one grilled fish taco and one grilled tilapia taco. Nothing remarkable about either  but I ve had far worse Tex-Mex. The mango salsa on the shrimp was decent but the chipotle sauce that came with the tacos helped mask most of the flavor. The gf got quesadillas and  they had more chicken than cheese  something I liked more than she did .   What was remarkable was that I paid for two entrees and six Pacificos and my tab was magically under  30. I don t care if it was a screw up on the ticket or what  an error in my favor will grant an extra star in a review every day of the week.    Cue the dirty talk simple ending   El Arroyo  I m not sure I ll ever be inside you again  but for one New Year s Eve you let me not only trounce around in there  but also let me have my way from start to finish. For that  I appreciate you and think slightly more of you.
El Arroyo 5th Street,443,I have no problems sitting in traffic on Mopac to drive downtown for the pulled pork with rice and beas. The Mexican Margaritas dont suck either.
El Arroyo 5th Street,444,The Ditch.  Love it.  Order it deep fried or don t bother.  Chimi s...yes.  That s it and a little to the left.  Know your artist.  Nobody invited Mapplethorpe to the Vatican.
El Arroyo 5th Street,445,If you want the worst service of your life  look no further. At El Arroyo the waitress will forget your brunch order  and bring you something entirely different. Then re-take your order  blaming the kitchen for the mistake  but forget it again. Then the manager will come out  and be just as confused  leave the table  and have to come back to take the order again for the 4th time. Then you will have the kitchen rush cook your eggs - which takes about 25 minutes  Next they will be sooo apologetic that they offer you a to go box because you ran out of time to eat your brunch.   This was the 1st and last time I will go to El Arroyo.
El Arroyo 5th Street,446,I was on the covered patio with a table of 8 during happy hour  about half of us got food as well and the people that did seemed happy  one of my friends described her enchiladas as  fantastic  and  too big to finish . The frozen margaritas were pretty strong and cost only a dollar- a combination which led me to drunkland pretty quickly and without much damage to the ol  bank account. I would definitely keep it in mind as a good place for happy hour.
El Arroyo 5th Street,447,Very good Tex-Mex at a very reasonable price.  I ve been very happy with the food and service every time that I ve gone here.  Of course  I generally order the same thing  tamale plate   but whatever.  They have a pretty good happy hour  the margaritas are decent  and you totally have to give them props for their sign out front.
El Arroyo 5th Street,448,Surprised to see negative reviews on here so thought I would add my two cents    I ve been to El Arroyo three times so far and I have yet to have a bad experience.   Waitstaff is exceedingly friendly  the decor is minimalist yet funky  the outside eating area is great  and the service is very fast.   They have a new item menu  the stuffed avocado meal  which is incredible. Highly recommend it and it will probably become my mainstay there. We also got the shrimp enchiladas which had a great shrimp to filler ratio and drew pretty good reviews from my girlfriend.  Their drinks are excellent and bargains in their own right. The mango margarita was strong yet delicious.  Dinner for two with drinks and an appetizer was less than  40. There are a lot of great tex mex places down here but for the price point  this place is a great deal.
El Arroyo 5th Street,449,There s a good chance that this is the worst Mexican food on the face of the earth.   And I will review quite a few Mexican food places on Yelp by the time I die in 40 years.     The cheeseball factor is very high here.  You have to listen to the stupid Pat Green song a million times.  Then the stupid I ve Been Working on the Railroad song  UT s school song  on the loud speakers a million times too.  The food was so bad here that I couldn t find one thing on the menu that was worth ordering.  So I ordered tamales.  They were covered in cheese.  I dare you to find a worse Mexican food restaurant.  I m pretty sure that it doesn t exist.  Congratulations  El Arroyo.  You qualify as the worst food that I ve ever had.
El Arroyo 5th Street,450,If you re looking for a fine dining experience  you ll want to look elsewhere.  If you re looking for a lively  diverse atmosphere with great margaritas  especially for the price    great service and above average food - you ve found your place.  My wife and I recently moved from San Antonio  so we know what great Mexican food should taste like  and while El Arroyo would not be listed in the  great  column  it was a fun place with fajitas that were very good.  Inside it was pretty loud  but its exactly as you would expect.  We will definitely return.
El Arroyo 5th Street,451,El Arroyo is a must whenever I m in Austin. It s five minutes from my parents  house  so it s pretty much a family standard. My sister thinks she got food poisoning here once  so for a while she was reluctant about the place  but she s turned around again. Not the best tex-mex in Austin  but it s on my list of places to go when I m here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,452,wow  guess I m the only one who thinks kick ass  .99 margaritas are reason enough for a good 2-3 stars     i also really liked their chips and salsa...Crystal A. and I split the sour cream chicken enchiladas with black beans and rice and I thought they were delicious....  I will definitely be going back for the thursday happy hour specials  i m very much a sucker when it comes to cheap margaritas 
El Arroyo 5th Street,453,This is one of those places I just don t  get .  Everyone in Austin seems to love El Arroyo and want to meet up at El Arroyo.  While I find the atmosphere to be enjoyable  the food always strikes me as mediocre and I don t like to wait for mediocre food.  However  they do always provide good entertainment to those cruising by on 5th street via a message board that has some pretty hilarious sayings.
El Arroyo 5th Street,454,The food here is so disgusting  I would give it zero stars. At least I didn t have to pay for this crap. I never had any of their  .99 margaritas  which I am sure are WONDERFUL . I did have one horrible bean burrito. The flour tortilla was disgusting....ugh  the worst tortilla I ve had in a long time. And the beans were crap. I would rather eat a bean burrito from Taco Bell  and those things taste like absolute shiznit too  so that s saying a lot.
El Arroyo 5th Street,455,Big qualification - I ve only eaten here one time  for Sunday brunch. The migas and fajitas were FANTASTIC - best I ve ever had. Wash that down with a Negro Modelo and you ve got the best Tex Mex breakfast in the city. Prices were great  Staff was great  Seating and ambiance were . . below average. One bright spot  they do allow people to bring their dogs into the outside seating area - so that tells you a lot about their casual attitude  very laid back. Parking can be a challenge.
El Arroyo 5th Street,456,Service was great  Meghan was amazing  she was very attentive  and friendly  I will absolutely request her next time  Drinks were very good  Especially for  1. However  food was awful. I won t be eating there again. I will  however  go just for drinks. Not a place I would recommend if you re craving good tex mex  but a great place if you re just looking for good drinks and a good time.
El Arroyo 5th Street,457,I have been to both locations  both our good we went to the Location on Far West it was good. however we were surprised that there was a  1 charge for fruit upgrade instead of beans  and our waitperson failed to mention that there is a extra charge for fruit but either than that the food and service was good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,458,This place is past its prime.  Stick  a fork in it.  They have gone so far from Mexican food  it reminds me of Denny s inspired Mexican food...that s how close they get to Mexican.  The enchiladas were covered in a creamy white sauce that definitely tasted like Denny s material.  Plus they cannot make a margarita...a complete sin.   The place was dead on a Thursday night at 8pm.......I will never come back here.
El Arroyo 5th Street,459,Dear original El Arroyo  your food was just as lousy as the last time I ate there about 15 years ago.  I will check back in another 15 years.
El Arroyo 5th Street,460,All I can say about this place is BLAH. Soooo boring and generic. I will start off by saying that I love me some good cheap Mexican food. Places like Trudy s and Serranos may be on the less expensive side  but their food is consistently yummy and flavorful and the margaritas are strong. I went to El Arroyo for the first time last night with a group of friends for happy hour. They all raved about this place and their Thursday  1 margarita happy hour. So I went and 6 margaritas later I wasn t even buzzed.  Now you may be thinking   wow  this girl may just have a drinking problem   and part of that may be true. But the margaritas tasted like watered down lime water and could not have had more than a thimble full of tequila in them. After the first one I told my friends I wanted to try a Mexican Martini  but they insisted that the margaritas would soon catch up on me. Never happened  they just made me have to pee a lot. Oh  plus my friend sitting next to us was served a margarita with black flecks floating in it. Looked like pepper but who knows why is was there and how many other drinks came out like that   Now to the food. Chips and salsa were mediocre at best. Nothing too great  probably fast food quality. And the menu boasted a variety of yummy SOUNDING dishes. So I asked the waitress what the best thing on the menu was and she said it was the stuffed zucchini. It comes out as a semi-raw split zucchini topped some extremely bland shredded chicken mixed with tomato sauce and melted cheese on top. Now I am a girl that loves my food and I don t like to share  but I shared this with my husband just to get rid of it. What everyone else ordered looked just about on par with my meal too. And I will say that I went with friends that don t have the most refined palates. So for them to think their meals weren t too hot made me think the whole menu must not be too stellar.  It really was some of the worst Mexican food I have ever had. I would even go as far to say that Casa Ole  is better.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because the location is good and I liked the Mexican rice. Would not go back though  there is MUUUUCH better cheap Tex Mex out there and MUUUUCH stronger margaritas for me to drink  - 
El Arroyo 5th Street,461,I wanted to begin this review by saying that the food at this establishment is absolutely wonderful  and who doesn t love a  1 margarita on a Thursday night  However  this evening I had the absolute worst dinning experience I ve ever had in my entire life. The evening started off with the hostess  forgetting  to write our name on the wait list  although unpleasant  this was merely  a speed bump in the crash course of disaster that this evening was. When we were finally sat  the hostess squeezed our party of six into a booth hardly big enough to fit 4  and then a good 10 minutes went by before anyone batted an eyelash towards our table. Finally  our waiter approaches to take our drink orders. After awhile  he returns with the wrong drinks and then proceeds to take our order. We waited awhile with no attention when finally a gentleman  who I guess was the food runner  shows with 3 out of 5 of our meals and one of those 3 didn t belong our table. As we tried to explain this to him and he dramatically yawned to make sure that we knew he was uninterested in our complaint  and then walked away. After he returned with the correct food  he mouthed an obscenity directed toward my friend. As you could imagine  we were extremely upset at this point and asked our waiter to speak to a manager. The manager approached in an apologetic manor and informed us that he would discount our meals. Even after that  we waited half an our to receive our bills  which came back incorrect. When we FINALLY stood up to leave  the same food runner as mentioned above says  Finally  you re all leaving  ... I will not be enjoying delicious foo andd  1 margaritas on Thursday nights anymore....  Thanks  El Arroyo staff.
El Arroyo 5th Street,462,Not sure where to start on this. I may need to try another dish or two  but what I had and what I tried of my boyfriend s were completely  unappealing.   First of all  the salsa has a sweet  almost ketchup-like taste to it. Chips weren t warm when they arrived. I got the fish tacos and they were abysmal. They couldn t hold together because there was this weird chipotle salsa that was wrecking the tortilla  and they were served with wilted lettuce rather than traditional cabbage. They also didn t offer a fried option  which in the fish taco world  seems insane.  I tried a bite of the enchiladas as well  and nothing awe-inspiring there either. Lackluster food  mediocre service  and construction  may be complete by now  on top of all that. Just an overall no thanks for every part of this establishment.
El Arroyo 5th Street,463,If your only comparison is Taco Bell  this place will seem great  but for anyone that knows Tex-Mex this place has become a joke in the last couple of years.   My family started coming hear nearly 20 years ago and for a long time we came about once a month. 20 years ago  this place could make the grade  sadly that is not the case anymore.   The Taco shells are straight from Cisco  the tamales do not appear to be home-made and the ground beef in the tacos is clearly pre-ground and seasoned with generic  taco spice . Absurd.  The enchiladas del mar  which I used to remember fondly  are now just  Krab  meat and a bland white sauce that has more in common with biscuit-gravy than seafood.   I think the fajitas use that pre-sliced fajita chicken that you can get at HEB.     Even the queso is the worst grade of canned cheez-whiz. C mon guys throw us a bone and at least stir in some ranchero sauce or something.   I actually had not been back in about 4 years until last night.  I was so disappointed that I recommend this place for out-of-town guests to my wedding that occurred a few months ago.    How embarrassing for Austin.
El Arroyo 5th Street,464,Service is bad and quality is not up to par for other places  even in the area.  This place has been around a while and I think could definitely improve with a little TLC.  Breakfast tacos are priced ok  but could increase a bit with a few more offerings or more filling.
El Arroyo 5th Street,465,This is a catering review.   I ordered 100 tacos for a 7am pickup for an event at the school where I work. When I arrived at 7am sharp  the tacos were ready  bagged  and handed to me by friendly  smiling staff  My thanks to Adam  the manager who took the order  and to the staff and chef  who really came through 
El Arroyo 5th Street,466,Huevos Divorciados I had high hopes for you. Eggs done my way  sunny side up please  on 2 corn tortillas with a side of potatoes. The tortillas were crispy but i knew off the bat that those 2 crispy tortillas were not gonna cut it  i need back up. So i ordered a side of tortillas and this is where it gets trifling. The waitress brings over the tortillas and they weren t hot. i m going to guess  you put them in the microwave for 15 seconds. I told the waitress  these tortillas are not hot  could you heat them up please   they get 15 more secs in the microwave. that s trifling. Hey Arroyo  FYI a properly heated tortilla is suppose to steam when hot and you should be able to roll it in your palm. its is not suppose to break in half. Why  because when you put your filling toppings inside it will break in half and everything would just fall back on the plate. i don t often rant  check my history  but if you really wanna hear it  get me luke warm tortillas and ill lose my sh t. other than that... I had a mimosa  ok   the patio is covered. there are large booths outside that could seat up to 6 and its in great walking distance to other shops locations.
El Arroyo 5th Street,467,I haven t been to El Arroyo in 2 years  so i decided to go back.  First it is much cleaner than before.  When we arrived the hostess was not at the stand  but returned quickly and sat us outside in a booth.  The waiter was there with chips in a few seconds.   Much improved    We tried the crab rolls with jalape o jelly sauce and I was delighted as was my GF. She like them so much she decided to order them for entree.  I had  pescado light .  A tilapia fillet and  instead of rice and beans  I ordered Saut ed spinach and a bowl of fruit.  I cringed at myself when I ordered the fruit  I figured in a Tex-Mex joint it would be out of Del Monte can.  Another surprise.  The waiter said it was fresh cut  and by golly it was.  The fish was cooked just right  although I had to ask for lime  and the spinach was not overcooked.   Is that third or fourth surprise  I lost count  All in all  great in every way  well  real good to great  and the price shocked me it was so low.  There is not but one item over  10.00 on the menu.  Our tab was  26.00 including tax with two margaritas.   The waiter tried to sell me on a flat iron steak served with an enchilada salad and rice and beans.  I asked him if was good and he said  as good as any in the city .  I think I ll try it next time.  Which will be soon.    Never dreamed I would give a 5 to a Tex-Mex joint  but I had no choice.
El Arroyo 5th Street,468,Worst fajitas I ve ever had. The meat was dry and tough  onions and peppers completely raw. You could tell the rice was made with frozen mixed vegetables. Margaritas weren t any good either  and the floor in the mens bathroom was very squishy.
El Arroyo 5th Street,469,This is an honest account of our late lunch on Sunday...       Hey  I ve always wanted to stop here. The signs are hilarious and the place looks really fun.  Eww. This place is filthy. I mean filthy.  Hey  The waiter is really nice and helpful in navigating the  far too many  menu options. They smoke their own meat and are pretty inventive.  Eww. Some guy who seems like he might own the place      won t leave the two chicks seated behind us alone. Creepy and weird.  Hey  This salsa is really great. Wouldn t change a thing about it.  Eww. This queso is definitely not con chile. Meh.  Hey  These beef fajitas on my combo are incredible. Smokey  juicy  perfect.  Eww. The chicken isn t cooked all the way through.   puts fork down        I ve never been to a place that is more hit or miss  all in the same visit. I m praying I don t get food poisoning.
El Arroyo 5th Street,470,One of my fav go-to place in downtown.  Go w The Sheriff - it includes a beer and tagline  Have you ever seen a skinny Sherriff  
El Arroyo 5th Street,471,They have  1 margaritas on Thursdays. The place gets full of college students taking advantage of the offer. The margaritas are not good but what would you expect for  1. The problem is that the place gets packed and the majority of the clientele are there for the  1 margaritas and nothing else. Free chips and salsa everyone  Of course. The kicker   The wait staff is in a foul mood. They go around serving everyone their  1 margaritas and free chips salsa and they are irritated about it. This is what El Arroyo is pushing. What do they expect  Wait staff ruined the experience. I really disliked their poor attitudes toward the students. Oy yes  I almost forgot. The food is not good.
El Arroyo 5th Street,472,Not even worth talking about extensively. The food   signage   and ambiance are all terrible  Avoid this place.
El Arroyo 5th Street,473,The drinks were much better than the food. The pulled pork tacos were dry and the queso was average at best. I would only go back for drinks  chips and salsa...on the patio
El Arroyo 5th Street,474,Got food poisoning there from grilled chicken.  I m  talking about 48 hours of absolute hell. So bad that my wife wanted to take me to the hospital. I was too sick to go to the emergency room. I ve talked to others that had the same experience at  The Ditch . This place gives new meaning to Shit Happens . I have never been back.
El Arroyo 5th Street,475,I eat at El Arroyo at least twice a week because it s right by my work. The service is great  the people are friendly and they have the best Skinny Tacos I have ever tasted  LOVE IT    
El Arroyo 5th Street,476,If your on a diet than this menu doesn t have much to offer. If not  than un buckle your belt and enjoy  Texas sized portions  all you can eat chips salsa and cheap breakfast tacos. The cool thing about this place is the modification s they let you get away with on the menu. You can mix and match tortillas   sauces protiens  beans and margaritas. I always thought it was a weird restaurant setup but it seems to work for them. Two deck areas surround a main dining room with a  ditch  underneath. Btw  arroyo literally means creek why not refer to the restaurant as over the creek instead of a ditch. A ditch just has an unsanitary connotation  but I digress. The staff is pretty cool. I ve met some very interesting people  and employees there. I prefer their beer night over their Margarita night. My fav dishes are the baja tacos  del mar enchiladas  beef fajitas  ceviche aint bad  and all you can eat sunday pancakes. Nelly has taken care of us twice and is a sweetheart. We ve gotten to know Jess and Ryan pretty well when we go early for breakfast lunch. I live north and don t get to go as often but when we re dt we usually hit  the creek  up. See  It sounds so much better. Oh yea  gotta love the sign postings which I learned not too long ago are thought up by clever staffers. Keep it up yal 
El Arroyo 5th Street,477,You can t go wrong with  1 margaritas and yummy queso. Or so you would think. This was seriously the worst experience at a restaurant I think I have ever had. First of all  I understand their policy of not seating incomplete parties on Thursday nights  even though we got there at 5PM and the place was not yet crowded at all  - what I don t understand is why they feel the need to be so freaking rude about it. Just because my party isn t all here doesn t mean I m not still a customer. More importantly  our service throughout the night was horrible. When we first sat at the bar to wait for our party  the bartenders and waitresses were so busy talking about how much money they were going to make that night that I couldn t get anyone to take my order or take my money to pay for my drink. Not to mention  being surrounded by a bunch of waiters just standing there around the bar talking unprofessionally doesn t make for a pleasant experience. Then  when we were seated our waiter could not have been slower - he would literally disappear for 30 minutes at a time  we were there for over 3 hours and not by choice . He brought my friend the wrong drink and charged full price on happy hour items during happy hour. The thing that made this experience so horrible was at the end when we were finally trying to leave. After our waiter had disappeared for at least 45 minutes he finally brought us our checks.  He proceeds to come back and tell us that the credit card machine is down but he will let us know when it is working. We waited for AN HOUR  I checked my phone against when my receipt says it was printed  and he NEVER CAME BACK. My friend had to go inside and pay cash for everyone s bills and ask for our cards back. I have literally never experienced anything like this before in my life. I will never eat here again.
El Arroyo 5th Street,478,Food lacks flavor  service is poor. Salsa is watery and chips very oily. We ve lived one block from Arroyo for the past three years and never been impressed by the restaurant experience there. Servers seem overworked and stressed. Objectively - the food doesn t taste fresh  lacks seasoning  and has even been served cold  when items were to be served warm . Dislike the overly politicized sign out front - it has deterred us from coming in. Only eaten there for lunch and dinner - never brunch. Overall  this place is overhyped.
El Arroyo 5th Street,479,I won t comment on the food  since  I don t really remember going here for that aspect but the drinks and the drink specials are pretty damn good.The only downfall is that it gets pretty packed here and sometimes the service can be a little slow since it is so packed. But check it out if you want to just hang out and drink.
El Arroyo 5th Street,480,This restaurant managed to push us away even before we got there.  Groupon  weekend only  expired just before this weekend and they refused to honor it.    We have over 200 expired ones and just can t accept them.     If owners gave their management any discretion at all  they would have had a party of 8 for brunch and an opportunity for some repeat customers.  We repeat buy from Groupon restaurants all the time.  Not El Arroyo.
El Arroyo 5th Street,481,I met a partner here for a late night dinner.  I had the fish tacos  rice and black beans along with a margarita made with Don Julio - it was just right.  It was a good Tex-Mex restaurant  a very casual and local spot.
El Arroyo 5th Street,482,Love the patio and the atmosphere  We eat here kinda randomly but it is always great. They have a great multi level patio with eclectic decoratiosna and it seems to always have  acool breeze. See you soon 
El Arroyo 5th Street,483,11 of us went in for a happy hour  and there were 4 other people in the restaurant  not busy at all. The two guys working paid no attention to us and service was awful. However  the reason I give one star  although I wish I could give 0 stars was because 4 woman we are with   all over the age of 25  are from different countries but have with them their legal ID s. They wouldn t serve them. So basically if you aren t an American Citizen don t go there  or go there and complain. They will do nothing about it. We left  went across the street and got right in and served.
El Arroyo 5th Street,484,Avoid the breakfast tacos.  Very little filling  amp  the tortillas are dry  amp  hard.  C mon man  really   Didn t used to be this way.
El Arroyo 5th Street,485,El Arroyo s famous marquee signs are as much a part of Austin as anything else I can think of.  Their food and service is another story.  The formula is familiar  serve some cheap tequila at happy hour and people won t be able to remember how mediocre the food is.  Happy hour is fun  don t get me wrong.  How can anyone complain about cheap margaritas   The younger you are  the more you ll enjoy El Arroyo  especially on UT game day.  Other than the queso  that s the only reason to go to El Arroyo.  The rest of the food is not memorable.  The service is equally forgettable.  If you want old Austin Tex-Mex  try Chuy s.
El Arroyo 5th Street,486,A-OK is just right for this place. The margarita we got were really just ice with a slight lime flavoring. Pretty sure they forgot the tequila. Ohh  but they did not forget the salt  My food was just ok and my friend s wasn t very good. The staff was acceptable and wait times were all good. Just left feeling very...MEHHH. Salsa and chips were very good though. Maybe a better happy hour appitizer place.. 
El Arroyo 5th Street,487,Great place to go  especially when the weather cooperates.  When you go  you don t want to spend it indoors  make sure you can get a table outdoors and enjoy.  The food is great as well as the drinks. Waitstaff is usually good and more important  in a good mood.
El Arroyo 5th Street,488,I love reading the daily signs as I drive down 5th street.  Clay is a friend of mine and has been doing an excellent job serving Tex Mex  to Austinites over 20 years.  The queso is excellent  and the guac is outstanding.  Ths staff is always pleasant and the outdoor seating makes for and excellent place to meet up with friends and hang out.  The beer is always  Ice  cold and the top shelf margarita    is just that.  Of course you can grab a breakfast taco in the moring for a buck if you are in hurry   
El Arroyo 5th Street,489,It s just a crusty ole bar that has a menu if you dare to eat there.
El Arroyo 5th Street,490,Had a smashing time downing margaritas during happy hour yesterday. Really sweet service even though we were only there for the 99 cent margaritas. And you can get an extra shot on top for an extra buck  Nice patio  good people watching  good company. Don t know much about their food but I think this place is great- but that could have to do with how much tequila I consumed and the excellent company I was in. Either way  I ll be back. And the sign is always dead-on.
El Arroyo 5th Street,491,Food is abysmal. Service is usually  but not always  terrible. Why go here  Cheap margaritas and decent chips salsa. The more you drink  the more acceptable the food becomes  perhaps that s part of the business plan  It gets incredibly loud inside  sit outside if at all possible  Go on  1 margarita Thursdays to optimize your good-drinks to terrible-food ratio.
El Arroyo 5th Street,492,I have not been to El Arroyo in about 19 years. I went this past Sunday because I was in town and still believe it is one of the best Tex Mex restaurants. They have done a lot of changes since I ve been there and it still maintains the Austin feel it had in the early 90 s. I notice a cleaner look than the grungy look it had back then.  One of my favorite dishes is the Santa Fe Enchiladas. It brought back so many memories when I took my first bite. The service was great and our food was awesome.  However  I was a little dissappointed that they changed their Fried Ice Cream. I compared it to other restaurants from all over the US and had it as the best ever. Now they put a sauce and fruit that just seemed like the others I have had across the country. I mentioned this to the waiter and he had the manager come over. I informed him of the old way and he said he had only been there about 3 years so he never new the old way and mentioned they had some menu changes. It was to my pleasure that he said we can do any of the old menu items and can do the Fried Ice Cream the old way. I thought it was funny too that he said he would go the store and get something if the restaurant did not have it. Now that s customer service. He told me to ask the waiter next time and I can get it.  So  thank you El Arroyo for accomodating the customers who have long been a loyal fan since the 80 s. Next tiime I am in town I will assure you that I will get my Fried Ice Cream the old way.
El Arroyo 5th Street,493,We loved our trip to El Arroyo   We went for brunch on a Sunday and were seated on the patio.  We really enjoyed the fried nopalitos.  Delicious food  great atmosphere  and kid friendly.  Definitely recommended 
El Arroyo 5th Street,494,Everyone has got their Mexican place. This one is not mine. The food is greasy and bland. The drinks are alright  but nothing spectacular. The salsa is okay  but I think in Austin that ok tea and salsa are two things that all tex-mex places should be able to provide.  I ve never had bad service at either of their establishments. The waiters waitresses have always been super polite and helpful.  Definitely try it once  to see if its your type of Mexican food  but don t have super high expectations.
El Arroyo 5th Street,495,I drive by this sign all the time and decided to stop in last week for lunch. After receiving two cups of hot tea with no ice  Ice tea   I knew this was going to be bad. We asked the waiter for recommendations and he just seemed confused. I received my lunch  fish tacos  extra avocado  and our appetizer.  tortilla soup  My tacos had no avocado and there was no fish on the tacos. The tortilla soup was more like bland cold chicken stew.. My lunch partner didn t get anything and the waiter seemed to be hiding. He came back to tell us somebody stole his order.     No apogees  no explanations. Maybe the rest of the wait staff didn t like him  My partner  finally got his lunch ..he wanted chile rellenos and got some type of unidentifiable  enchilada. We couldn t find the waiter to even exchange it.We did finally get some ice for our tea from another waiter but our waiter was nowhere to be found. He came by and dropped the bill and walked away. He never even said another word  how was your food  thank you  nothing    Wow  what great customer service  NOT. Never going back here. Your signs are cute  your service stinks..
El Arroyo 5th Street,496,literally the WORST service I have ever received in my life. Not only was the waiter incredibly slow  but even the manager was rude and incompetent. We had to ask an average of 3 times for simple things like water or a lime  and even then we seldom received what we asked for. When we received our checks  they up charged everyone and didn t change them  even after talking to the manager  who was incredibly disrespectful . Do not go here unless you want the worst experience of your life     0 0
El Arroyo 5th Street,497,I only get the Tortilla soup and its friggin  amazing   Chunks of chicken breast  veggies  large slices of avocado.. and you can get it with or without rice.  I always get it without rice  and its still incredibly filling.  Their bowls are huge and their cups are filling.
El Arroyo 5th Street,498,We went on a Wednesday evening and it was quiet  staff was friendly.  They recommended a winner - stuffed avocado   yum   We took the kids and they loved the kids meals too   Enjoyed the salsa too.
El Arroyo 5th Street,499,Was nearby at lunchtime so thought I would give this business a try. I haven t been there in some time. The afternoon crowd was sparse and the noise level was quiet. I sat at a table for a while then interrupted a conversation among waitpeople next to  the bar to ask for a menu. One was produced and I was served  an adequate meal. The decor is casual. Indoor and outdoor dining. Popular place for brunch on weekends. Good place to drink and watch sports. Parking space in back and adjacent lot.
El Arroyo 5th Street,500,Very disappointing. I went there with my mother on a Sunday around 1pm. When we got there and the place was full. The menu states that you should ask your server about Gluten Free and Veggie options. Both my mother and I have to eat Gluten Free though I don t like to be obnoxious about it. But since the menu states there are options I went a head and asked. Our server looked at me like I was a big pain in the ass and started to give me a half assed explanation about what someone who can t eat gluten should eat.  Stay away from flour.  Are you kidding me  So my mother says  So we are basically on our own.  And he says   Yeah. .  We didn t make a deal about it. Just smiled and ordered our drinks. Five minutes later we order our food. Fifteen minutes later he comes back to ask me what I ordered. Which meant he had not yet even put our order in. Unbelievable. 45 minutes after we sat down we had our food. This was after the place had cleared and tables that were sat after us had their food or had already departed. He made an excuse  blamed my mother  that because she ordered fajitas - that s why it took so long. Please. We re from Texas. That s the first and faster thing to order. Give me a break. The food was fine but we were so hungry and angry for being treated like pariah because of food allergies that we didn t enjoy it.   We won t be returning. Ever. The waiter was a red head  bearded jerk.
El Perrito,1,How have I not left a review yet    El Perrito is always amazing. Ivan  the owner  is amazing. The food is amazing. This born and bred El Pasoan is a huge fan - I just wish I lived closer.
El Perrito,2,Ehhh.  I think I m one and done with this place.  It was underwhelming and did not come close to meeting the hype or expectations.   In my case  the pictures look better than the experience or the quality of the food.  So it was not as good as it looked.  On this visit - they were out of chicken  and to be fair to them I think I need to try their chicken.  So we got the beef instead  and I must say their beef had a weird taste to it  somewhat of a swine-effect  it did not taste fresh.   The sauces looked good but bland and lacked flavor and spice to be honest.  The fries were nothing special  so I don t understand what some of these reviews are claiming about how awesome the fries are - they weren t a big deal.    If you look at past pictures - they are reducing portions.  They put half the cheese on as compared to what they used to do - why   Did cheese prices jump 50      Oh - the Hot dog was not good. Mine was cold and not worth  10.  No way.  The bun was stale.  It did not taste that good.  I get a great quality beef hotdog - bigger BTW - at Costco for  1.50.  And here you pay  10 and they put a bunch of stuff on it but it was not good at all.  You just don t serve stale product or food that s past it s expiration.     They do not list any prices on the menu.  That is not good  and that s a red flag.  That just means they can change it anytime they want and there is no way to track that.  They will raise it whenever and however they want to.    I m wanting to try the chicken  but overall this place was so lackluster I may skip them.  If this is El Paso cuisine  then I m either passing through instead of stopping in for a visit - or - their quality doesn t accurately represent the Real McCoy.  FYI - - just by the owner s comments below the review - I think they helped me make my future decision.  Instead of taking the feedback and wanting to make it better  they d rather put the customer down and tell us not come back.  LOL   I m happy to take my business elsewhere - especially to those who deserve and appreciate it.  Just pass on these guys  folks.
El Perrito,3,Exceptional first   of many turns out  visit.  Great customer service - like literally with a smile in the middle of the heat    The salsa on the drowned tacos is perfect. It is authentic- and that s hard to achieve. There are a lot of flavors in any one bite but they compliment each other perfectly.  The taquitos themselves are super crispy which is great to hold up in the salsas. The legit flavor of the picadillo can still be tasted in the midst of all the gooey goodness.    Expect to wait a little while for your order   it s all made to order --so please be  patient       
El Perrito,4,We randomly decided to stop by here for a small dinner yesterday since we were in the area and I m so happy we did  We shared the chicken flautas and they were delicious. The service was super friendly and fast  and the outdoor seating vibes were great  also have indoor seating too. We will be back 
El Perrito,5,Ok  I ve been WAYYY too disclosive on this platform about my abiding love for El Paso style Mexican Food... Austin has had a couple of food trucks that sufficed... but no brick and mortar... that looks to change as one of the truck greats  El Perrito  is transitioning to B amp M where it s food truck is located on Stassney.  Gotta say I love the red cheese enchiladas  the El Paso  drowned  tacos...  Chico s style  for the litigiously minded.  But best is the El Paso style crispy hand fried tacos... you re gonna like El Perrito  and you are REALLY GONNA LIKE the air conditioned dining space already there 
El Perrito,6,OMG  I finally found the best Crispy Tacos EVER  I have been looking and searching since I moved from Southern California to Austin Texas about 3 years ago  This place reminds me of the SuperMex restaurant and cantina back in California  Found this place while sitting and having ice cream at Baskin Robbins. I have been craving fresh crispy beef tacos  I tried Chuy s and many other food trucks  but this place hits the spots  I pulled up an hour before closing on a Sunday HOT evening  wasn t busy  there were people eating there food on the wooden table benches  the food look so good and fresh  I knew I came to the right place  Friendly face with a smile that took my order. I order 6 crispy beef tacos..  to go   the nice gentleman that took my order ask me to sit to in my car  to wait  cause it was very HOT and humid outside. He said he would deliver my food to me  This is great awesome service  I was willing to wait outside but he insists to keep cool. I got my food delivered to my car  I couldn t wait to get home  to enjoy with my beer of choice for the night  Dos Equis  This was so freakin delicious  will worth the 6 mile drive  Green sauce was the BOMB  I am coming back for more for sure  These are the type of tacos  I am use to eating back home in Southern California. Very reasonable price on all there foods. I almost forgot to take pictures before I pigged out on the crispy tacos. If your craving crispy tacos... this place is a must for you to stop
El Perrito,7,Great food at this food truck  They sell El Chuco tacos  and other goodies from El Paso. The salsa on the tacos is casera homemade and delicious. We will be back 
El Perrito,8,A bit of EP in Austin   AMAZING food and very friendly. This is worth the drive from RR. We ll be returning soon 
El Perrito,9,Extremely friendly staff  good food  making chuco proud  You can sit outside or inside. FYI the inside is still undergoing renovation.
El Perrito,10,Food was outstanding  I took my family here  they re based out of El Paso and it definitely took them home. Aside from the food being good as hell  workers are very friendly  helped us out when we first got here  and who ever was running the speaker had the jams   5 stars all the way 
El Perrito,11,I can confidently say that  between Jan 1998 and Sep 1999  I ate more Chico s Tacos than any human being in El Paso...or anywhere. That made this broke college student a lifetime self-appointed expert on the matter.  Fast-forward to Halloween  2021 in Austin. The tacos were a little bigger  which initially concerned me  but then I realized it was actually a feature and not a bug. It keeps them crunchy   One tradition of the experience is either dipping your fries in the left over juice or just pouring it over them  El Perrito does the work for you and gives you the fries with the juice cheese and green chile on them.   The taste was home  the smell a time machine and the experience a solid five stars.  All I was missing was the small cheeseburger with the plutonium-grade mustard and Vicente Fernandez on the jukebox.
El Perrito,12,To preface our experience  we often travel to El Paso  and must stop as often as we can at Chico s Tacos out there.   After seeing El Perrito featured on the Texas Bucket List  and hearing that is supposedly compares to Chico s  we knew we had to make the drive and give it a try.   We ordered the Drowned Tacos  and the chicken flautas. Both were served almost identical to what was shown on TV  and well within a reasonable time.   Both entrees destroyed any comparison between Chico s and El Perrito. Meaning to say  there is no comparison  El Perrito won  hands down   El Perrito s entrees had full flavor  a good amount of spice  hefty serving size  cheese that melts and sauce that sticks to the food.   Given the choice between either restaurants  there would be no discussion that we would prefer El Perrito 
El Perrito,13,Damn  This place is SOOO good  It s right around the corner from my house with is amazing  and dangerous . Honestly  there is nothing bad on the menu. The drowned tacos  the quesadillas  the ELP dog - all of it is good  Yes  they get busy. Yes  it may take some time to get your order. Be patient and get yourself ready for some bomb ass food 
El Perrito,14,Great people and Great food. They have there own style and just overall a good vibe. Highly recommend
El Perrito,15,Makes me miss my hometown  El Paso  I got the rolled tacos and hotdog. The food is great and the service is friendly. I ll definitely be back 
El Perrito,16,Being from El Paso and frequently craving the infamous Chico s Tacos  I was so happy to try the Austin spin on El Paso inspired street food  They were amazing      Missing the soy cheese  they use regular shredded  and the sauce was a bit more of a gravy and much spicier but amazing  Highly recommend   
El Perrito,17,If you like taquitos flautas and you like comfort Mexican food  this is your place   Drowned tacos  is their specialty  which is basically crispy rolled tacos drenched in a red sauce.  El Perrito is now parked in the backyard of Sahara Lounge. Plenty of parking in the lot.  Their menu also has HOT DOGS  So come and enjoy some taquitos and hot dogs.
El Perrito,18,To be honest  I went in with an open mind. I was not disappointed. This was the best thing I ve tasted in 800 miles. Made me feel like I was back in Chuko. Amazing    Thank you for bringing this south.
El Perrito,19,We are from El Paso and this place was recommended.  Drove from Georgetown to check it out.  Very authentic and quite tasty.  Hopefully they can move closer to us.  If not we ll be back. Thank you for a taste of home.
El Perrito,20,These drunken tacos are the best   Much better than Chico s Taco in El Paso.  Hard shell tacos also were very good.  Others in the party had a hot dog which was equally as good 
El Perrito,21,I m in love   So delicious and I can t wait to be back  I can understand all the rave reviews now and please go check them out..
El Perrito,22,Im from El Paso and i dont think theyre all that   i know he s double charging for what you get and then wants a tip. Thats what got me   the tip. But yeah   once was enough for me.
El Perrito,23,Absolutely delicious. What looks like an unassuming little food truck with no more than one person able to fit in ends up being a place that dishes out some of the best food in the city. My mother is from El Paso and we always stop whenever we re there to get some Chicos tacos. The El Paso style rolled tacos at El Perrito is for sure the closest thing you can get to Chicos in Austin. The red sauce the tacos were drowned in was so good I drank it once I was done. The salsa is spicy but tasty and the tacos themselves would be delicious just by themselves.  This is truly a hidden gem of the city and everything I ate while there warranted many future returns. Please  if you re even thinking about it for a second  go to El Perrito. The food is delicious  owner is a very friendly guy  and I would love to see this place get some more love because it deserves it.
El Perrito,24,Absolutely AMAZING  Best authentic Mexican food I ve ever had in Austin. The drowned tacos combo literally makes love to your mouth. The quesadillas are the BEST I have ever had. I was shocked. The owner of the food truck is extremely kind and provides loving  quick customer service. When I was eating I ran out of Coca Cola and out of generosity without asking  he brought me and my partner a fresh one to enjoy. Every customer I observed was laughing and smiling with joy saying  l m definitely coming back   as they received and finished their food. Wonderful environment and even better food    I can t wait until y all open the store  Thank you   
El Perrito,25,Finally   Best Mexican-style food from El Paso Metro  OMG  I am to the Moon and Back with this place. The floating tacos are exactly as you can find at Chicos Tacos in EP  The hard shell tacos are delicious and have so much flavor. I plan on going there at least once a week  cause I live in Seguin  TX  to try their whole menu. It has loads of flavor. Mexican food is supposed to have loads of cumin  garlic  onions  cilantro  avocados  tomatoes  lettuce  limes  Pico de Gallo  and chile sauces. This place is going to be huge for Austin  please consider opening a place in San Antonio   I m in Love 
El Perrito,26,We came here based on a recommendation from a friend from El Paso. A large group ordered ahead of us.  The 4 of us put in our order and were told it would be 20-30 minutes.  We literally waited an hour to get our food.  Someone else came after us and got their food before us.  An hour to wait when they weren t crowded makes no sense.  We should have been told honestly how long the wait was. I m not sure we will be back.
El Perrito,27,This place is awesome. Don t have to go all the was to El Paso when we have ELP here now. Just listen to Gabriel Iglesias when his Kings of Comedy Scott had people flying to El Paso from all around the world just to try these tacos.  a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fyoutu.be 2F5e9Vuj6HAms amp s f18cd5772f47cea34cafe1b15b0ce9177ce6957527b1b69d4268aa80cacfabdd  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  youtu.be 5e9Vuj6HAms  a 
El Perrito,28,The Spanish name of the dish is Tacos Ahogadas  and they are perfectly delicious  a labor of love  and a chuco delicacy  love these ELP Tacos  ElPasoStrong
El Perrito,29,I was there 3 PM Saturday 02 12 22.   I had the Deshebrada Crispy Tacos and a chili cheese bacon-wrapped hot dog.  They were both exceptionally good.  This is some of the best tasting food I have ever had.  I have been wanting to come here for months since the Texas Monthly article came out and I can t wait to return.
El Perrito,30,El paso style tacos...WOW WOW and WOW    The tacos ahogados are super delicious   I will definitely be visiting more often    Can t wait to try the rest of the menu items    Thank you Ivan for bringing El Paso style comfort food to Austin   
El Perrito,31,No bueno. Decided to leave a review based on two visits. On the first one  I asked the guys to make a recommendation for a first timer and was told to get the drowned tacos. We got those  some fries with similar drowned taco prep and some crispy tacos. Maybe you have to be from El Paso  but drowned wasn t really my cup of tea. Since they are so close to our house  decided to go a second time looking forward to trying one of they re got dogs  assuming they must be good with  perrito  in the name . We showed up around 8 40  they close at 9 00  and before we even ordered anything  they open the little window and sat  sold out.  Seriously   Sold out of everything  Maybe I just wanted a Mexican coke. Don t plan to ever return. Business 101 - honor your hours of business and avoid BD excuses for wanting to close early. Ended up getting great food at Taqueria Jefe in the carwash parking lot next to Fire Dept. near S1st and Ben White.
El Perrito,32,I was expecting El Paso tacos but I got Walmart tacos it was very disappointing but the Flautas were delicious
El Perrito,33,This is straight up the hidden gem of Austin. It is the best way to have El Paso style street food  IMO. The ELP drowned tacos are a must  They are similar to a Chico s Style  but he definitely has his own delicious touch on these. The regular tacos are just as good as the rolled  and have a home style feel  which I think sets it apart from the trendy taco joints of Austin. Plus they re not 5.00 a piece.  if you get the rolled tacos  make sure you get a side of fries to drown in the sauce as well. He s always posting weekly specials on his IG as well which we always look forward to.   Now to the hotdogs... holy hell  if you re looking for an authentic style Sonoran hot dog  look no further. Absolutely amazing  Wrapped in bacon with all the fixings  is a must  Highly recommend this spot  Who doesn t want delicious rolled tacos with a draft beer  Keep up the good work    ELPASOSTRONG
El Perrito,34,Wonderful nod to the food of El Paso.  Think Chicos with better ingredients  a little more spice  cleaner tables  less of a line   amp  no loud jukebox
El Perrito,35,love this place. I m from El Paso and now I don t have to make short trips home to enjoy a classic chicos tacos dinner when they are here in the ATX
El Perrito,36,El Perrito food is always delicious.  Today my husband  sister and I ate there.  We loved the Krispy Tacos  ELP Tacos and Quesadilla.  My sister was visiting from south Texas and she loved the food.  We recommend their delicious food.  For sure we will return for more
El Perrito,37,Nothing brings me the amount of satisfactory nostalgia like these drowned EP tacos. The food is amazing  the owner is super professional and courteous  My family and I are so happy we found this truck  Can t wait to see this truck grow 
El Perrito,38,Rolled fried drowned tacos aka Chico s tacos in Austin  TX  I am originally from El Paso and have to get my Chico s tacos fixing here and there and this is the spot  I personally like the red sauce the tacos are in more than the original restaurant. It has great flavor and spice. The green salsa is awesome. Tacos were nice and crispy. Also  he made us fries red sauce green salsa cheese  just stop reading and drive there
El Perrito,39,If you want authentic El Paso style food  you need to visit El Perrito Street Food  Located at Crow Bar on South Congress  this little food truck dishes out some of the best Mexican style hot dogs I ve ever had. But my favorite  Easily the crunchy tacos with ground beef. I will definitely be visiting again - this time to try the Dogstin hot dog 
El Perrito,40,AMAZING FOOD  I got the ELP tacos and Dogstin and both were to die for. The salsa is so good and if you have ever had Chico s in El Paso this is the better version and a little piece of home here in Austin 
El Perrito,41,Amazing  We had the Dogstin  ELP tacos and crispy tacos. All were delicious     We will definitely go back here and soon  So happy this place is in my neighborhood  
El Perrito,42,Oh. My. Goodness. Wow was this food delicious. I ordered the Crunchy tacos  O.G. hot dog and the Dogstin hot dog  all of which was freshly made and soooo good. If you are not a hot dog fan  I totally am  the Crunchy tacos are amazing. Perfect mix of toppings to meat and that great crunch.  The OG and the Dogstin were superb. I had never tried Mexican style hot dogs before and boy have I been missing out. I even took one to go so my boyfriend could experience how delicious it tasted. We will definitely be hitting up this food truck again. My only regret was not ordering more food and not trying the other items 
Tacos Yo Soy,1,I would honestly consider moving to Austin just to be closer to Tacos Yo Soy. Wow  just wow  I think the best thing I ate my entire trip was the barbacoa taco from this modest taco truck. The chicken tinga was also so delicious  but it s a week later and I m still thinking about the dang barbacoa.  Tacos Yo So serves their tacos with a couple options of salsa  one green  one red. Both delicious. I ordered my tacos on flour tortillas  and I savored every single bite for so long the tortillas got super soggy  but who cares. Still delicious.  I topped it all off with a Mexican Coke  1L . Ugh what a meal 
Tacos Yo Soy,2,Decent food truck located on 53rd street. This place has decent parking and food comes out pretty quick. If you work or live around here you probably frequent it often. Side note  this part of Austin feels like it s stuck in time and development hasn t really touched this street yet. Definitely an old Austin feel on 53rd.  I got the carne asada plate which was tasty but I wish they would ve used a different cut of beef it was really thin and made me wishing there was more to it. My brother got the gringa  which was tasty  but pretty pricey  I don t think it s worth the price . The best thing was the Torta.   If I lived here I d probably go more often and try to find the best thing on their menu. This place is ok.
Tacos Yo Soy,3,We were just driving by really hungry and found this highly rated taco food truck  but were soooo disappointed  The seating area is actually really nice  amp  cute for food truck seating  but the food was reaaaaally lacking flavor and a little over priced for food truck food   What we ordered and don t recommend  - Barbacoa Tacos  everyone in the reviews raved about this and honestly it was the WORST one we got  There was really NOOOO taste ... unless I got the wrong memo and should be adding my own salt and sauces  this really was not enjoyable  - Asada Tacos  amp  Pastor Tacos were a bit more flavored than the barbacoa  but were still far from any decent taco I ve had before. - Torta de la casa  again the flavor was not there  and it was a tad dry. We got the green and red salsa but it really didn t do the tacos not torta much justice.   All I can say is eat at your own risk...
Tacos Yo Soy,4,Have a Spec-Taco-lar Day  Highlights   Aguas Frescas    Salsas  Street Mini Tacos   Review  These street tacos might be mini but they re flavorful  filling and probably best two bites you ll ever have. I got the tacos campechanos which comes with chorizo  al pastor and grilled chicken. The flavor profile is crazy  you get the smokiness from the al pastor  the savory fattiness from the chorizo and the charred saltiness from the grilled chicken. Add some drops of lime and any of their 3 salsas for a fully satisfying bite. Can t wait to go back to try their tortas  quesadillas and gorditas.

Tacos Yo Soy,5,Decided to try Tacos Yo Soy Saturday morning and it did not disappoint. I ordered 2 barbacoa tacos and an egg and potato breakfast taco. The barbacoa came with a corn tortilla and the breakfast taco came with a flour tortilla. They both really impressed me   I ll definitely be back to try more tacos 
Tacos Yo Soy,6,Got a quesadilla  which was just sadly made. Barely any cheese and meat  and way too pricey. Service was great and fast  but the food just didn t do it for me. And to do a quesadilla with cheddar cheese is not legit  real Mexican quesadillas are made with either Oaxaca or even Mozzarella cheese
Tacos Yo Soy,7,Honestly these are the worst tacos I ve had in Austin. Meat is flavorless  tortillas are not great and it s is expensive for what you get. Wish North Loop would get a new taco truck.
Tacos Yo Soy,8,I went here probably a few weeks ago and had some really amazing breakfast tacos from them. They were really cheap and done really fast which mattered to me because I was in a rush to go to work when I visited them. They have a huge menu. For now it s a 5 star   . Also they have Chinese food there too but for some reason they call the Chinese food there by the name of another restaurant  dragon shack . I think maybe it s because 2 people were there running the truck but each their own food separately maybe  Edit  I had the torta there too and I absolutely loved it too. So cheap and I m happy to have them close to my home
Tacos Yo Soy,9,We happened upon this food truck with a covered seat area bc of rain and what a find   We tried a few things and ordered a few torta to take home  all of them were unbelievably delicious   Can t wait to go back.
Tacos Yo Soy,10,What a great surprise  can t believe I ve been sleeping on this place for so long  Tacos Yo Soy feels like more than a food truck. They ve created a really charming little patio that is welcoming and comfortable. Service was fast and friendly. Food was delicious  Great value for the price.   We tried the al pastor  chicken tinga  and barbacoa tacos  along with a quesadilla and mango aqua fresca. All very yum  This is my new favorite taco spot in the area. Definitely give it a try 
Tacos Yo Soy,11,Delicious tacos only  2.50 each  tasty tamales  excellent service. I recommend the barbacoa  tender  slow cooked beef that will melt in your mouth  topped with fresh cilantro.
Tacos Yo Soy,12,First time trying this place and I was really good  I got the Migas and another breakfast taco.  I love their corn tortillas and their salas. They had a red  green  and I believe a chipotle one  That one was my favorite. It s a little bit of a drive for me  but I ll for sure be back  Service was quick too.
Tacos Yo Soy,13,I ve eaten at the most famous taco places in Austin  and these are my favorite Home-made corn tortillas  excellent salsa -- toppings are great  and prices are reasonable. My wife and I love the Migas and the Chicken Tinga taco. The Chicken Quesadillas are great as well. My only suggestion is that I would love to see grilled onions on the side    Fantastic food here.
Tacos Yo Soy,14,Oh my god  This place is absolutely amazing   I m visiting from Dallas and I was excited to find a cute food truck to stop at and wow am I happy I stopped here  The food is so good I could eat here over and over again  I had the chicken taco plate with rice and beans. Everything was fresh and delicious   I m really excited to come back for more   
Tacos Yo Soy,15,Tacos were excellent. Salsas were fresh and tasty  Highly recommend if you are in the area   Easy covered seating by the trailer that is kept clean
Tacos Yo Soy,16,Amazing food  Oh my goodness.  There torta  sandwich   was huge and so delicious  I also had their breakfast tacos too. You just try this place. Authentic 
Tacos Yo Soy,17,We love coming here for tacos  tortas  and agua frescas  but everything we ve tried has been tasty. Lucky enough to live close  so I ve spent a lot of time here. They have a good selection of meat like the pastor and barbacoa. I always look forward to coming here. The owners are very nice and help
Tacos Yo Soy,18,Delicious authentic Mexican food .  We asked for vegetarian version of Gorditas and Huarache and it was delicious.    Fresh ingredients with all the 4 kind of salsas  Fairly priced.
Tacos Yo Soy,19,This place has recently moved to north loop next to Vans Bahn Mi. Thought I would give it a go. First thing noticed was it is a cash only truck. Without being aware before stopping I only had 4  cash.  2.50 bistec taco it is. First note and what makes me absolutely gleaming is that the red spicy sauce.....is actually spicy  To many places the spicy sauce is tepid at best. This place  spicy means spicy and great flavor not heat alone. Overall  this is one of if not the best  2.50 taco in town. Look forward to going back with cash and checking out the rest of the menu.
Tacos Yo Soy,20,This place is wonderful  The food is made with love  amp  care- my burrito was grilled to be toasty  And the atmosphere is beautiful. It is a lovely book with umbrellas and I felt at-home. It is a beautiful place to eat at sunset. The servers are very nice people. 5 stars 
Tacos Yo Soy,21,I pop by this truck occasionally and try something new every time. The food is fantastic and the owner is genuinely passionate about the product he puts out and your enjoyment of it. I don t think I ve ever reviewed anything but today I got the huarache with carnitas and a side of rice beans and he was so excited about it he took a picture of the plate  as a cook that is the passion I want the person making my food to have.  Also  being hungover and getting a topo and pancakes at the taco truck two blocks from my apt is pretty amazing.
Tacos Yo Soy,22,This place is amazing. The workers are all so friendly and they all have great customer service. The food is amazing and they have their own special salsa that absolutely SLAPS   So good  10 10 would come again. Also the setup has to be one of the most beautiful food truck setups I ve ever seen.
Tacos Yo Soy,23,Fresh and yummy Asada tacos  2  with rice and pinto beans  They came out quite quickly and came with a sauce  of your choice . The red sauce is REALLY spicy just warning ya. Green sauce was good and also had a kick. Will be a regular here. Located right across from Van s Banh Mi.  both trucks are great     Another time  I got the Mango with Chile. It was sooOOoo refreshing and sweet 
Tacos Yo Soy,24,Tacos and Deli is one of those hidden gems that you find in your neighborhood and want the world to know.  The food is always absolutely fabulous and the portions generous  the breakfast tacos are giant and oh so delicious.  The hot sauces live up to their name  flavorful and quite the punch.  So stop on by and give Emilio a try.  He ll greet you with a friendly smile and a satisfying meal.
Tacos Yo Soy,25,It s not much to look at  but the food is pretty dang good. I had the chicken tacos  with lettuce instead of tortillas  and they had lots of flavor  and it was plenty of food. There s also a Vietnamese food truck at the same location. Picnic tables were pretty well shaded with umbrellas.
Tacos Yo Soy,26,This is my go to taco truck. Super friendly family run. Huge array of options. Everything is solid. Red sauce and oro sauce are nice and spicy. The pork torta is excellent - good bun  veggies avocado  and moist pork. Fast service. Breakfast tacos are great too - more egg filling than avg and the Migas are my fav.
Tacos Yo Soy,27,Haven t tried the food yet  but the horchata is excellent. Definitely the best I ve had in Austin by far.
Tacos Yo Soy,28,Everything was amazing  Got omelette w vegetables and ham  bacon potato tacos  pancakes and horchata. Everything was delicious  Very friendly 
Tacos Yo Soy,29,the tacos here are made from fresh quality ingredients and they are generously stuffed. everything on the menu was reasonably priced and there are so many items on the menu here. i can t wait to try the mango con chile next time.
Tacos Yo Soy,30,If only this place was as accessible as McDonalds.  In which I mean  I wish they were on every corner.  I have to admit  the 1st time I tried this place I had the potatoes an egg taco.  I was a little disturbed that my  papas  were runny  not what I was expecting .   But now each time I go there I order an extra side of papas  ...   I love breakfast tacos.  I love avocado.  I didn t know these 2 things would go together until I had the jess tacos from here.   It was like a harmonious marriage of excellence in my mouth.  This is like the lobster of breakfast tacos.  Another thing I love is the migas special.  I love this plate so much  that I want to take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant.        That winks for you migas especial.  I m thinking of you.     This is a far superior place to eat and is a role model of a restaurant I would like to own one day.  Great concepts and twist on food that you thought could only be prepared one way.  To top this greatness off most of the food they serve here is good for you.  Double sha-poopy for taco deli  great tasting food and it s healthy 
Freebirds World Burrito,1,I used to be a Chipotle loyalist  but now  I m switching teams.   Ever since they launched their new plant-based chorizo made with Abbot s Butcher  there s just no contest.  THIS  stuff is what I was hoping for all along. Moist  chewy  hearty  and  spicy  it is fantastic all around. This replaces the previous Beyond Meat option but I really don t mind  that was mostly potatoes with a few  scraps of meatless grounds in it anyway. This is just pure protein  and  it is GOOD.  If you re on a budget  the kids meal is where its at. For just  5  you ll get a tidy mound of food  plus chops and juice. All told... Freebirds  you are the winner of this round 
Freebirds World Burrito,2,I will never go to this location again. I ordered online and I get my order and the burritos were missing ingredient  the order didn t have my brownies  and the staff on site was very rude when I called to ask about a refund for the brownies since I live 25 minutes from this location. I work at a restaurant myself I understand mistakes happen and an employee tried to tell the guy who answered the phone that he called me saying the order would take longer cuz the brownies were in the oven.. I did not receive any calls and also didn t even know how to apologize. The employee on the phone said I was lying about what the employees said.. If that was the case why not put a note on the order that brownies were missing so they could put them in there when I showed up or asked me to wait until they were done. This was my first and last experience ever to this location  The staff was very rude on the phone and didn t even know how to apologize I m sorry you had to work on halloween but get over it and act like an adult.
Freebirds World Burrito,3,Holy sh  .  Never again will I step back into this location.  On a Sunday morning  staff hungover.  I get it. I ve been in their place but never ever spoke unprofessional in front of customers.  Three staff members  a girl  a guy and a older guy who acted like he was a high schooler.  We were ordering and while the girl employee was taking our order  she and the other staff members were talking about how they should close early and just leave.  We re standing in front of them while they re saying this. I get it  we all hate work but come on.  Next  there s no refried beans.  They claim their machine broke.  The older guy employee said   I can go in the back and smash them myself but it will take 20 mins    Like  bro. You re standing around  doing nothing.  Go do it and have some ready for the other customers.  I hope he wasn t the manager because he didn t care at all.  No different types of cheeses.  Just one. I asked the girl employee about the other cheeses and she replied   Can t you see we have one    Like WHAT. I had to hold back and not say anything.  Like girl  I KNOW y all had other cheeses because I ve been eating here for years.  Next up  half of the soda dispensers were just spewing out carbonated water. I look at the staff member and he sees me struggling to find one that works.  Only one worked. Out of 9 different beverage flavors  one worked.  I really didn t want to leave them a tip. I tried not too.  This experience was so uncomfortable and awkward.  So unprofessional and disappointing.  AND IT WASN T EVEN BUSY. IT WAS SO DEAD IN THERE.  I hope the other locations will change my mind but honestly f    this South Lamar one.
Freebirds World Burrito,4,On the go  quick satisfaction on the curbed hunger of extinction. Let them rock your tastes buds straight to the bank.
Freebirds World Burrito,5,Freebirds is always a solid 3 stars. It s decent fast food  at a decent price  with decent service  which you can opt to make decently healthy. It s a decent choice I opt for once every couple of years.
Freebirds World Burrito,6,Every time I go in the cashier takes forever and they act like it s no big deal to keep you waiting.  Other people are then waiting in line just getting to listen to a pointless conversation with a off the clock employee or a friend.   But every time they are super nice when I m ordering my food. Always seemed clean but in never eat in the store.   Also you can t use their gift cards for online orders FYI. WTF it s 2022.
Freebirds World Burrito,7,There monster burritos are big I only ate half good service n fast it was my first time eating here I ll definitely be back
Freebirds World Burrito,8,Food has gone down in quality  hitting a pretty average caliber right next to Chipotle. Add in the fact I got smack talked by staff while they made my food.   Basically  ordered a quesoritto  without realizing they no longer make them since I haven t been to a Freebirds in over 4 years . I was met with a pretty confused employee so I apologized and said it would be okay to pass on it and he told me he was new and sought out some help from his coworkers.  The process went smoothly until checkout where one of the employees struggled to wrap my burrito. Which is when I got shit talked by two employees. By the looks of it  a new kid  and a catty superior.    How do you wrap this thing   Like a normal burrito   It s breaking apart   Yeah that s why they are no longer on the menu    Then why are we making it   Because it s a special item  -insert eyeroll-  Needless to say I was pretty uncomfortable at this point. I ve worked food service before and would have NEVER talked so poorly about a customer s food while they stood in front of me. It s so unprofessional and just plain out rude. I sustained a back injury the day prior and was on meds and it made me feel even worse than what I already felt like. Unbelievable.   I would never force someone to make something they don t offer or demand things not on their menu. Nothing worse than getting shit talked about an item that you told the employee not to make if it wasn t possible anymore.  Never again am I stepping foot in another Freebirds. Especially if they can t train staff to be respectful and practice proper customer service.
Freebirds World Burrito,9,Felt like a Burrito this afternoon. Googled and saw a Freebirds Burrito in Brodie Oaks Shopping Center. I got a Monster Burrito with a Green Tortilla. This burrito was stuffed with Flavorful ingredients  Carne Asada was tender. I think the Burrito weighed over 3 pounds and stuffing was mixed well by Burrito  Chef by folding unfolding tortilla a number of times  This is very important in the making of a good burrito. Any yall South that want a good  flavorful well balanced meal  they had plenty of food  N yall on other sides o town come on down to enjoy this World Famous Burrito in Historic South Austin  Dr Wiley Coyote SFO...
Freebirds World Burrito,10,Since learning that kids eat free on Sunday we ve become a weekend fixture at Freebirds. I can get massive nachos while my kids get quesadillas or the tiniest burrito made from a taco sized tortilla. It was adorable and my 6 year old was very proud to have her own little burrito. The kids also get chips and a drink. We can all sit outside and enjoy the fresh taco scented air and and the savings.
Freebirds World Burrito,11,I have wrote here before and now I see it removed. 3 times in the past couple years I ve ate here. I get it to go I live a block away. All 3 times it s been cold. I don t send food back. I should not have to get home and heat food that was just made. A block away. Please look into this.
Freebirds World Burrito,12,I ve been shorthanded at work before  we all have  but I ve also been honest with my customers when I have been shorthanded. I placed my order online at 5 45 and was told to be there by 6 05. I show up at 6 10 and am told they are working on it. We ll  it s 6 30 still nothing  I ask one of the kids if my order is lost or if they dropped the ticket. Nope  they re going to get to it. 6 50  now they re getting to it. The absolute worst customer service ever  and rude too. Peace out freebirds  it was nice knowing you.
Freebirds World Burrito,13,Ordered through Grubhub. They didn t put any meat on my kids bowl   It had three ingredients- carnitas  rice and chips. How hard is that   Now my son is pissed. Thanks guys. Won t order from you again 
Freebirds World Burrito,14,Super disappointing.   The burrito is generally dry. The proportions of ingredients don t do it any justice since the larger the burrito the same portion of guacamole  cheese and sour cream are used so you re getting more filler like beans and rice maybe meat but not much of anything else that binds those ingredients. If you re craving a burrito this place won t hit the spot.
Freebirds World Burrito,15,First time at Freebirds and I will definitely be going back  I went with a friend who had never been to this style of burrito place  and they were super patient with him and walked him through the entire process. Great service    This was my first time at Freebirds and I thought the food was tasty and worth the price. I ordered a salad  and they were great about allowing me to customize it to incorporate more or less of what I wanted. The only downside is I noticed a sign when walking in that they had Beyond Meat options for vegetarians  but once I got up there it wasn t clearly labeled so I forgot to order it  I expected the employee to suggest the Beyond Meat protein option since she suggested the peppers and onions for a vegetarian burrito. Either way  it was still delicious.  We also ordered chips and queso which I recommend  and it was an overall good experience. We took it to-go but there was plenty of seating in the restaurant and it was clean and inviting. Great for families     I can t wait to go back 
Freebirds World Burrito,16,I recently decided to try this place out again since my last experience was just ok. The catered our job and the nachos were so good. I was craving nachos one day and decided to give this place a go. OMG the nachos were fire  I ordered the chicken nachos with dark meat  they give you two options either dark or light chicken. The dark chicken has a really good smokey grill taste to it. Their queso is pretty bomb  it also comes on the nachos. They have so many topping options that by the time I got my food it was stacked high.   They also have other options besides nachos. They also have burritos  tacos  and salads. So there is something there for everyone. The prices are very reasonable considering how much food they give you. They also offer a few different sauces to try  so make sure to try them. I went during my lunch break around noon  and they were steady. They have plenty of parking and you get through the line really fast. The cooks are nice and if you have questions they are pretty cool at helping you out.
Freebirds World Burrito,17,I was dumb to go back here again. Of course they forget the chips as they always forget something. I really strongly recommend staying away from this place. I wish I would listen to myself as it s convenient but horribly understaffed and horribly managed
Freebirds World Burrito,18,The service is always amazing and the food is awesome. But ordering directly from the mobile app is trash. It always get stuck on processing or only pull up partial information. I eat at Freebirds at least 2 to 3 times a week. I work all over Austin. The mobile app only work half of the time. Sometimes I get so frustrated with the mobile app. I just end up eating somewhere else. It s a mobile app. So it should be more user friendly. Please    Have your web developer look at this or get a new service. Out of all the restaurants I use to order food. This mobile app is the worst.
Freebirds World Burrito,19,Love how the employees are very nice and actually have good customer service. I personally liked the employee Austin he was super nice and even took time to draw a dinosaur on one of the burritos. You may think it s not that big of a deal  but I love when I can leave a good place like this with a smile   
Freebirds World Burrito,20,Everyone that knows me well are quite aware that I like to be seated and served when I dine out unfortunately my new colleague was unaware when he asked me if I was hungry and wanted to go out for lunch. He was driving and insisted on coming here which at first I was not too well pleased especially after passing one of my favourite places that serves Swamp Curry  nevertheless I was here and hungry  ordered the Steak Burrito on a spinach tortilla  loaded it down with steak  black beans  Spanish rice  cheddar jack mix  pico de gallo  sliced avocado  and just a sprinkling of the death sauce. It weighed a ton and was surprisingly delicious. Needless to say  I wasn t very productive after returning to the office. I could step out of my comfort zone and return  the atmosphere was cool and the staff most accommodating.
Freebirds World Burrito,21,Ate here again today  second time in a short time frame  with two other coworkers. We all enjoyed our food. It was very crowded today and we lucked out and got the last table in the dining room. I had the carnitas bowl today and had it dressed up with some various items and a very very very generous amount of Habanero sauce. It was delicious. Got a to go lid as I could only eat half. They serve a very generous portion for sure. One coworker got the brisket nachos  and he got a to go lid for half of his meal  and the other coworker got the steak bowl and he wiped it all out     Amazing how someone can cram in that much food at one time    
Freebirds World Burrito,22,I expected this to be potentially a better version of Chipotle  but it ended up being a more sub-par version of Chipotle. The burrito bowl was OK  but overall underseasoned. I did like that I could get all the toppings  fajita veggies included  without an additional charge  but I just was not impressed. With so much great Tex-Mex food in Austin  they just could not compete.
Freebirds World Burrito,23,FREEBIRDS. Burrito bowl with cayenne tortilla filled with chicken  cilantro lime rice  lettuce  light black beans  cheese  sour cream  and lime sauce. It s soo yummy   I don t care for freebirds queso with the huge peppers and tomatoes  it s just not very good in my opinion but luckily their yummy burrito bowl doesn t even need it.
Freebirds World Burrito,24,Tried the Beyond Meat at Freebirds. Taste and texture work for me. Apparently the sodium can vary from day to day. Today it was fine. Cons. This location cut the product with fried potatoes chunks. The serving size would have been adequate if it was pure  but since it was cut it s not enough. I ll stick with a veggie bowl. You can ask for extra beans and rice all day  plus it comes with guacamole.  At a  1.50 more it should be pure. Fried potatoes take away from the product. You don t put potatoes in the chicken and beef.
Freebirds World Burrito,25,This place always provides me consistently good food and when I go in the afternoon I always see the manager running the place and helping out.  It s really good to see that.  The food here just seems to taste better to me than Chipotle.  I have been working the 2 taco  chip salsa  drink combo for lunch.  This lets me go a little easier on the fillings so I don t get so full.  Great little deal.  Upgrade to guac or queso for  1 - although the last go they forgot to give me my guac -   
Freebirds World Burrito,26,I find myself at Freebirds frequently because it s close to work  a good choice for when we are indecisive  most of all it s easy to be a vegetarian here.   I really like the staff at this location. Plus  they recently added new outdoor furniture. It s always pretty clean and always consistent. Also  value. Who doesn t leave this place feeling super full.   I recommend over the alternative any day.
Freebirds World Burrito,27,To paraphrase an  old  saying    I wouldn t kick Freebirds out of bed  however  if I had a choice I would pick Cabo Bob hands down. He is WAY hotter  
Freebirds World Burrito,28,I had a burrito recently at a different place and ever since I have been trying to recreate that experience.  I ve been to Freebirds  but not in a really long time.  I have never been a fan of it  but since it is close to my job I thought I would give it a try last week .... well I am sad to report it did not live up to what I was wanting.    One thing I do like is the tortilla selection they have.  They have a few different options which is always nice.  First thing the girl asked me was what size I was wanting .... I was like uhhh I am not sure.  She said the medium was most popular so I went with that.  When  I looked up at the menu I didn t see the sizes.  I did notice much later that they are posted on the menu just further down the line  which really doesn t make sense.  My suggestions would be to move that picture to the left of all the menu information  since the size of your burrito is one of the first decisions you make.  I was cruising down the line telling the girl yes or no on items to put on burrito.  On a couple of items she asked me if I wanted them and I said yes and she follows up with there is an extra charge for that .... I m like ok.  This happened 2 or 3 times I believe.  When I paid for my medium burrito  a drink and brownie it was over  15.  I was like whoa   My meal was not worth that much.  I couldn t help but to think maybe it was because of whatever extra charges there were.  As I sat and ate I was looking at the menu and saw that all the extra charges were  1 or more.  I would like to see Freebirds come up with their own combinations  maybe 5 or 6 options people have to choose from.  That way the customer knows how much something is before they agree to it and the extra charge is built in to the price of that combination .... just an idea.   My burrito itself was ok  nothing special and like I said earlier it didn t live up to what I was really wanting.  It will be a long time before I ever come her again.
Freebirds World Burrito,29,I have to say  I really like this place.  So why the two stars  After dining here pretty frequently  sometimes weekly   I was somehow charged for a drink that I did not buy.   I told the clerk I didn t buy it and he said it would be credited on my card.  It wasn t-I caught the charge on my card.  Called corporate.  Corporate said it would be refunded to my card  and it was NOT.   So-corporate-no. -Clerks here-no.  You can t trust them.  So from a customer who ate here on average of two or three times a month  I will now be a customer who does not eat here  unfortunately.
Freebirds World Burrito,30,Great service but oh so s Lamar slow    Will see how the rest of the experience goes but so far kinda slow  
Freebirds World Burrito,31,I hate to have to write this review  but visited this location on 1 12 20 and got food poisoning. I have been here several other times and this is the first time I ve ever had an experience like this. I was sick for 24 hours straight and will likely not be back.
Freebirds World Burrito,32,What possess a man to stop at a chain burrito place in Austin  I wasn t feelin the food truck vibe tonight so I looked for something new but not to far off the beaten path. I love me a good Burro  I read the FreeB rd reviews and thought Chipotle  Texas style.    I was not disappointed     How can the same 7-10 ingredients taste so different  I guess the same way two painters do. One paints houses the other creates art    The ingredients are said to be fresh as they claim to not have freezers. There are several choices of flavored tortillas  spinach did the trick  Lime Rice  loaded Carnitas  pintos... side of gauc. Similar to the order I may get at Chipotle. I believe the secret is in that she massaged the ingredients together before carefully folding that bad boy.    THE LAST BITE WAS AS FLAVORFUL AS THE FIRST    Enjoy
Freebirds World Burrito,33,Always good  I like the cayenne tortilla  Spanish rice  pinto black refried beans  any kind  they re all good - try the pinto   white meat chicken  pico de gallo  roasted veggies  lil corn salsa  white onions  cilantro  and hot tomatillo salsa or death salsa. Then get all the self-serv salsas and fresh lime on the side to squeeze. I m not big on their queso  meh on the queso and the chips  or their cookies  which is quite rare for me  but they do have tasty rice crispy treats that ll help satisfy both cravings for an evening. Price seems fair. Wish they had better queso and sweets for a one-stop situation. I always go somewhere else for those after coming here for the burritos. But the burritos are so worth it.
Freebirds World Burrito,34,I finally gave this place a try this week and I am happy I did. I loved my white chicken burrito and I can t wait to go back. One thing that sets this place apart from competitors like Chipotle  is that you can get a smaller or larger than normal size burrito  so it s not one size fits all. I appreciate being able to buy the smaller size when I m not starving and then I don t have any to waste at the end. I also love the option of ordering all white meat chicken. Highly recommend trying this place if you re in the area  I will go out of my way to go here and avoid Chipotle.
Freebirds World Burrito,35,We stopped in for takeout  and it was alright. The service was fine and the food was nothing special  but it s a solid choice in a hurry.
Freebirds World Burrito,36,Short and sweet because I just don t have a lot to say about Free Birds.   Okay service - not fast  pretty slow...but nice people.  Okay food - not great  but definitely not bad. Stingy on pretty much everything...even rice.  That s it. That s all I got. It s just only okay that I don t have much to say because there is nothing super great and nothing super bad.
Freebirds World Burrito,37,The food was fine - at least mine was. I ordered a salad  no rice or beans  but it was filled to the brim and was delicious. My boyfriend ordered a bowl  rice and beans included  with about 4 or 5 toppings and his bowl was only half full.  The person making his was very blase and seemed to not care at all. He scooped toppings my boyfriend did not ask for multiple times and repeatedly try to fill his bowl with stuff he didn t ask for. My boyfriend was nice about it but very frustrated.  Not sure what was going on with that guy  but my boyfriend left feeling almost as hungry as he was when we walked in.  Not very happy  especially with  21 worth of food.  Won t be returning to this location.
Freebirds World Burrito,38,Pretty good alternative to chipotle. They have 3 different burrito sizes. The smallest one being around 3 4 the size of a chipotle burrito at around the same price. It is good food  only complaint was that the queso flavor was a bit weak.
Freebirds World Burrito,39,Great place to grab a burrito. Many more options than Chipotle and all fresh ingredients.  This place was born in Texas and knows how to serve Texas unlike many of the burrito wanna-be places.   This location is in a shopping area so they have lots of free parking. Service is friendly   think Thundercloud but for burritos  and food is good. I stick with the hybrid  which is the smallest one  but they have enormous options if you are really hungry or just want to split one by cutting it in half.   Sooo... go get a bird and see what you think. I suspect you will leave with a full and happy belly...
Freebirds World Burrito,40,I ordered the Grilled chicken burrito with the cilantro rice and I added the jalape o sauce. I really enjoy spicy food but if you don t  I advise you this  DO NOT get the jalape o sauce. It s extremely spicy     The burrito was great  I ll definitely try the bowl next time.
Freebirds World Burrito,41,We have been eating at Freebirds since their first locations in Austin after their Cali thing didn t work out so great.  They have since gone from a privately held company to being owned by a large British food company  though the quality of service and food has remained the same.  One downside to them being bought out is the authentic local feel and they no show all the crazy foil sculptures people make from the burrito wrappers.  Don t get me wrong  it still has the funky feel of good ole  Freedbirds  but the standardized corporate signage and other corporate requirements have become a bit evident.  The biggest change for me  and an important one they should reconsider  is they no longer recycle.  Big NO NO in Austin  or anywhere for that matter.  The food is always good and fresh at Freebirds.  It never tastes stale or pre-packed and they have some variations in the menu.  I am always satisfied with a Hybird size burrito  but a lot of people opt for the formidable Freebird size.  You have to be really hungry or need protein for training if you consider the Monster and just plain insane or feeding a small army to get anywhere near the Super Monster.  I can t comment on the non-vegetarian options because I have never tried them  but the veggie and tempeh versions are out of this world.  The cilantro lime rice with black beans is my favorite baseline and all the other fixins are great.    Try Freebirds if you haven t already and you won t regret it.
Freebirds World Burrito,42,I like the food at Freebirds but this location is not good with delivery or pick up orders. 9 times of 10 they forget an item - chips and queso or drinks - but still charge you for it. I gave it a shot but this has happened the last 3 times I ve ordered from here. I m not ordering delivery or pickup from this location again.
Freebirds World Burrito,43,Chipotle is great  Freebirds is greater. The Tempeh protien  cilantro rice  and size variety is brilliant.
Freebirds World Burrito,44,Every time we go here it is NOT during lunch or dinner rush hours.  We always go during AARP   toddler hour.   I think that is a factor with respect to customer service.  We always get GREAT service and plentiful  fresh portions because of this timing.   My only issue is I prefer different salsas than tomatillo-based salsas.   D cor is creative.   I patently refuse to go to Chipotle and this is a much better replacement.
Freebirds World Burrito,45,Store was overall clean however there was some trash on the floor. Employees were friendly and food looked fresh. They have a good selection of drinks and the burritos we got tasted great. Had some good music playing in the background. Will definitely come back to try other items on menu.
Freebirds World Burrito,46,Honeslty tortillas smell n taste like they went bad I dont recommend this place the staff also looked dirty.
Freebirds World Burrito,47,I eat lunch here about once a week. Everything is always fresh and filled with flavor. Ive been eating free birds over a decade now and can say i have never been disappointed. If your dieting  there is a number of healthy options.
Freebirds World Burrito,48,If you like Chipotle then you ll LOVE Freebirds. They have all the fixings for one incredible meal. If you like to call all the shots then this place is for you   To start  you choose from a burrito  burrito bowl  quesadilla  nachos  tacos or a salad  So plenty more options than Chipotle.   I chose the Freebird sized burrito  regular size  verses small or huge. Then you pick from a cayenne  spinach  flour or wheat tortilla. I chose cayenne and loved it.They have the usual proteins and veggies but the toppings are yummy  Pick between cilantro rice  my fav  or Spanish rice. Black  pinto or refried beans. Toppings that include the usuals PLUS much more like mixed greens and roasted veggies. And dressings like ancho  ranch and roasted tomatillo. If that wasn t enough  they have SIX sauces like bad  ss BBQ and death sauce    I added queso to my burrito but you could also add bacon  Have I convinced you yet   I m convinced and headed back there real soon 
Freebirds World Burrito,49,This location is always a good bet for an inexpensive filling meal. The staff is friendly and helpful. The options are plentiful. The brownie rates in the top ten of my favorite brownies available in Austin - which says a lot for a prepackaged dessert  I usually take out a hybird with the optional queso upgrade. It includes chips and a soft drink. My mini partner in crime enjoys the kids burrito with a juice pouch. I will also occasionally mix things up and get the two taco deal instead. It s nice when I can t decide between chicken or beef. It is significantly less food for only  0.20 less than the burrito  so if you re starving go for the bird over the tacos. A large portion of restaurants here in Austin are switching over to non coke products  so I also enjoy that I can get a classic coke and that they keep their soda to carbonation mix on point from the fountain. You can over course also enjoy a Mexican coke or even a bottled beer if you want to splurge a bit.
Freebirds World Burrito,50,I probably love Freebird s more than your average Austinite. It s that perfect cross between fast food and a sit down restaurant  and easily outdoes Chipotle. It has more options  veggies  beans  tortillas  meats  sauces  and it s vegetarian-friendly. Their meat has a lot more flavor than Chipotle and their tempeh is much better than Chipotle s meatless option. The staff is friendlier than Chipotle s  usually  and the atmosphere is similar.  The only downside to Freebird s in my opinion is that the line can get pretty long. The cash register is separate from where they make your food and the flow of service can be a bit choppy. But aside from that  Go Freebird s 
Freebirds World Burrito,51,Here are all of the reasons I love Freebirds   1  They offer a smaller size burrito  the Hybird. Brilliant  Why doesn t every burrito place do this  Those regular sized burritos can be excessive  especially if you re craving a burrito  but don t want to consume 900 calories in one dish.  2  You can put queso and tortilla strips on your burrito. A must.  3  They have flavored tortillas. The cayenne is amazing.  4  Their dulce de leche brownies are scrumptious.  5  The restaurant itself is quirky and the people that work there are usually the same.   So  I know that for some reason a lot of people like Chipotle and I have no idea why. Every time I ve eaten at Chipotle the meat is tough and literally inedible in my opinion. Not the meat at Freebrids. I generally get steak and it s delicious. You also have the option at Freebirds to choose from light or dark chicken  if chicken s your thing.
Freebirds World Burrito,52,I love this place  they have delicious burritos and it s always quick. When the person behind the counter was making my burrito the tortilla ripped badly  and she made a new burrito for me with out have to ask too.  The only reason I rate it 4 stars is the pricing.  4 dollars for stale chips and mediocre dip  and a drink.  2.50 for a medium sized drink.  Plus they ask if you want queso then charge an extra dollar for it without asking if it s okay.
Freebirds World Burrito,53,Freebirds has really gone downhill. Ordered a Monster and the kid literally wraps it in 2 tortillas  really disgusting  why would I want that   Why don t they train their workers 
Freebirds World Burrito,54,Flavor profile here was great  An extremely fresher  better tasting chipotle-style meal with way more options  I did the steak bowl  black beans  corn  pico  roasted garlic  white onion  cilantro and a bit of an habanero sauce  which isn t spicy at all  more smoky . Will be back 
Freebirds World Burrito,55,Staff is usually pretty friendly  and service is quick. It suffers from a similar issue to most Freebird s  where they mash together your burrito before wrapping it  which seems like a decent idea  but usually just ends up leaving the burrito soft and mushy .  Aside from that minor complaint  this location is solid and the food is tasty.
Freebirds World Burrito,56,This place is awesome.  The food is great  the price is cheap  and the service is fast and excellent.  The food here could easily be sold somewhere at a sit down restaurant  
Freebirds World Burrito,57,I had a wheat Freebird burrito that was awesome  The ingredients were fresh  perfectly portioned  and flavorful  The nachos and queso are tasty. Queso is very thick  I docked a star for charging for sour cream   1 extra  but otherwise it was an awesome and fast meal.
Freebirds World Burrito,58,Ordered with door dash for 3 nurses at the children s hospital. All of our orders were incorrect. No one got any of the sauces they asked for. The salad order was pretty much lettuce   no cheese  no dressing  no toppings. The nachos had no queso or cheese of any kind. The two extra quesos were dumped over sideways and almost empty. We spent over  50 on food and it was grossly disappointing.
Freebirds World Burrito,59,Im visiting Austin from Florida and i love Chiptole.  So my mother told me to try FreeBirds because the local likes it better then Chiptole.    FreeBirds has more variety of choices. They have  3 sizes for a burrito and 3 different Burrito wrap. And a large variety of stuff to add to your meal. They also have 3 different sacues that you can put on the side. Including BBQ. I LOVE Chiptole but if FreeBirds was around ill eat at FreeBrids.
Freebirds World Burrito,60,Disgusting honestly. I ordered a chicken burrito  got a tortilla filled with shit rice  amp  beans. 4 pieces of chicken woo 
Freebirds World Burrito,61,Time for a review update. This place is still my favorite burrito place in all the land  English accent...It makes it sound more official that way.  You know I m serious when I whip out my English accent.   They have a rewards card  so you can get points after purchases and save up for their badass shirts. I want every single one of those shirts  but I choose to spend more dollas on food.   The burritos continue to be amazing  as do the servers. More recently I ve chosen the burrito bowls. I d suggest instead of getting rice  pack on the beans. The steak is the best. I ll never order the chicken again  Also  add the green sauce to whatever you get... it s so good  It s a chain  but I don t give a crap. I think Freebirds makes Austin great 
Freebirds World Burrito,62,I give this star simply for the staff . The service was good. Fast and friendly. The food on the other hand just wasn t for me. The meat was bland  no flavor at all. I couldn t even finish it. I would not return to try anything else.
Freebirds World Burrito,63,I still prefer Freebird s over Chipolte  because they have so many more options. And even though they might be known for their burritos  I like ordering their steak tacos on corn tortillas. Keep in mind you might be full for 2 days  I thought going the taco route and just asking for a few toppings would be the lighter option for lunch  but since the tacos come in multiples of three  I found myself on verge of exploding until I went to bed last night. I wish we could just order single tacos there. Pretty please   I m happy to see a new Freebird s further south in Austin  but this location isn t my favorite. Maybe they had just done some remodeling or hard core cleaning  but the vague stench of something like nail polish remover wasn t the most appetizing smell while munching on some tacos.
Freebirds World Burrito,64,My company got boxed lunches catered from this freebirds. We all had the genius idea of getting the monster sizes. The boxed lunch came with the burrito  chips  amp  salsa  and a cookie.   Everything was  good . Nothing was surprising or worthy of blowing minds  but it was just ... good. First world problems might be what we usually call it  but I don t have any complaints nor compliments which explains the reason why I give 3 stars.   The cookie was soft and slightly melted which is a plus. the burrito wasn t cold. The chips and salsa weren t unacceptable.
Freebirds World Burrito,65,I think all these 4-star reviews for Freebirds come from people who are taking them for granted  WAKE UP PEOPLE   Freebirds is a 5-star institution.  Need proof  Monster Steak with sour cream and guac.  I rest my case.
Freebirds World Burrito,66,I hate to write this  Freebird s is usually pretty good but not tonight. I showed up at 9PM  they close at 9 30PM. I walked up to the line and they were busy serving one lady. I waited for quite a while while I witnessed several employees wandering around without coming over to me. One of the wanderers eventually made it over to me and he was hassled by me you could tell. He flagged down another girl to take over saying   I have to shred the chicken  can you finish this  ....she was totally disinterested and he I could tell that. She was very attitudey. They also charged me extra for my sour cream which I had never been charged for before as a veggie quesadilla. Was just a poor experience overall  noone wanted to be there or help me and when I got home  my meal was all soggy and not as good as usual. Just a total let down.
Freebirds World Burrito,67,Freebirds  I used to think you were only for pot smokers and aluminum burnouts  but just a few work lunches here instead of Chipotle and the way Chipotle seems to fall short of its game in the past year has changed my mind.   I love the  5 taco lunch  where I can get better flour tortillas and eat chips to my heart s content with your tomatillo sauce and keep an IV of Dr. Pepper to accompany my after-lunch food coma.   I love your cilantro-lime rice  which seems to beat that of Chipotle s  and your friendly South Lamar staff and how they swipe my Fanatics card 7 times because that machine on the left never works.   I enjoy your gritty rock music that kicks the butt of whatever southern salsa or xylophone arrangement is at  other  burrito places  and how you have outdoor seating and a patio for pretty days. I also enjoy the free wifi  where I can cheque in about how I m there  I know  I m that lame sometimes .   Chipotle tries very hard  but you accomplish more by trying less  and that makes you so much cooler. Cheers to our future 
Freebirds World Burrito,68,While I generally enjoy Freebird s  I don t think I ll return to this location. Service was acceptable  though not outstanding. I d say the staff attitude was rather bland. The particular burrito I got was ok  not great. Some of the ingredients  I got beef  with cilantro rice  and some misc. toppings  were subpar quality. Edible  yes  delicious  no. I had chips and queso with my meal  and the chips were some of the most stale chips I ve had in my life. We re talking seriously HARD.   Edible  Yes.  Yum  No.  Would I return  Only if there were no other places open nearby.
Freebirds World Burrito,69,I solemnly swear to never go to Chipotle again. Better quality  ingredients  price  and attitudes from staff can be found at Freebirds. I just moved to Austin about a month ago and have already been back 3 times. It s an unhealthy obsession   On my first visit I think the man behind the counter could tell I was a newbie so he walked me through the whole process and informed me of all the yummy options I had in front of me. I chose steak for my filling and he advised me that it s even better with a bit of garlic and lime juice to enhance the flavors. Good call  guy    I do think it s kinda lame they charge extra for sour cream  but hey they got to make their money somewhere. I order the smallest size  the hybrid  which is more than enough for me. Good thing this location isn t too super close to my house or else I would get really fat 
Freebirds World Burrito,70,Worst customer service I ve ever experienced at free birds. The whole vibe here is just depressing. Not coming back.
Freebirds World Burrito,71,Every time I come my burrito tastes amazing. I m guilty of overfilling my burrito with chicken  ground beef  extra rice  queso  cheese  salsa  jalape o sauce   amp  cilantro and I usually only eat one half at a time because it s so dang big. They have so many options. Great place if you re craving a quick Mexican bite.
Freebirds World Burrito,72,I went in during a lunch rush yesterday and was every happy with my experience till i checked my bank account this morning. The little girl that worked the register thought it was appropriate to tip herself an extra amount on my card without my knowledge or my permission. I had already given them a tip so the audacity of this act is infuriating and unacceptable regardless of the amount. I will not be returning to any of the freebirds and will be looking to take farther action on this matter. It s unbelievable this even happened.
Freebirds World Burrito,73,If you re in Austin and you re still eating at Chipotle  you my friend  are a fast casual mexican food AMATEUR. Freebirds is where its at for your build your own burrito  taco  salad  bowl and heres the kicker...NACHO needs   Having nachos is one of the areas where Freebirds blows Chipotle out of the water for me  but it s not the only one. Other areas are their diverse tortilla selection  cool vibez interior  super chill employees  vegan friendly options and kick ass tomatillo hot sauce and BBQ sauce. They have way better toppings than Chipotle too  including but not limited to the holiest of tex-mex toppings ...QUESO   Pro tip  try that green sauce behind the counter  its jalapeno garlicy goodness .
Freebirds World Burrito,74,The food is fine  but this yelp is strictly about the brownies. I m not sure who s idea it was to change them  but they should be fired. The old brownies were my favorite part of free birds. And now they have these  pot brownies  as they call them  horrible. Bring back the original ones PLEASE     
Freebirds World Burrito,75,Freebirds is a better option to Taco Bell in my opinion.  Not that there s anything wrong with that.  I was hesitant to go with some fellows for lunch the other day  but due to time concerns  Freebirds seemed like the best choice. I had the burrito bowl  all the guts  no tortilla   and it was an enjoyable eat.  Nothing awesome .  For the same price  I could go to four other places within a mile and eat something closer to my desires.
Freebirds World Burrito,76,Tasty option for a quick stop. Nothing particularly noteworthy but good food for the price.
Freebirds World Burrito,77,So I gave Free birds three stars because the two taco meal that i used to get for  5.00 is now  8.00. My husband loves Free Birds and for me it was okay.. but for  5.00 it was worth the compromise.  Now my review based on the vegan perspective and so I can t rate the queso  or brownies ... BUT the crispie  tacos with refried  beans and veggies was good. I like the  salad dressings  on my tacos and the quac  I always liked.  The service is good and the people are cool. I hate that you can t get tshirts with your points anymore.. BUT my husband loves all the free burritos we have earned. I think when your in this neck of the woods its a good place for cheap its.. well burrito or tacos that is...   Over all every location I have been too.. its been the same  and that s including San Antonio too.
Freebirds World Burrito,78,Sadly this was probably my last visit to freebirds. The food and service was just terrible today and consistently has been my last few visits.
Freebirds World Burrito,79,I want to start the review by saying I m an avid Chipotle fan and I ve only eaten at this restaurant a couple times in California.  But now it s my new favorite restaurant  I was here in the middle of the afternoon on a Thursday and it was relatively quiet. I like the option for all white meat  something chipotle doesn t have  and I think the portions are larger as well. I got double chicken  white meat  with lettuce  tomato and salsa. You can go online to their nutrition calculator and see how many calories your food is if you need to as well.  The place was clean  the staff was nice  and I m really happy with the food 
Freebirds World Burrito,80,I love Freebirds for a great burrito.  I have found that the Hybrid is plenty for me.  Service is great  with friendly folks making my burrito  letting me select the ingredients  offering advice  and at the end taking the time to spread and mix the ingredients.  I like the brownies if I need dessert  too.
Freebirds World Burrito,81,This has to be one of my favorite places to go for a quick meal that s not fast food. A wide range of tacos  burritos  duh  and nachos. They have a lot more too I just can t remember it all. The staff is always helpful and fun. Wry nice and easy going. My kids love it because they get to have exactly what they want on their food. And you can make stuff with the foil the burritos are wrapped in when you re done.
Freebirds World Burrito,82,Almost identical to Chipotle  but with worse food and better branding.  Qdoba is still the best.
Freebirds World Burrito,83,This place is in my  hood and I frequent it often when I m too lazy to cook which is  yeah...often.  I usually stick with the carnitas burrito and the smallest size the Hybird which by the time I get down the line adding all the ingredients is pretty damn huge.  It is too big to finish in one sitting  however  I tend to manage it.  It is similar to Chipotle but they have more ingredients to choose from and for the traditionalist  they even have refried beans.   I ve had the chicken and steak but always go back to the carnitas.  Yeah  this review is boring but the burritos aren t.
Freebirds World Burrito,84,This may be a premature review  since I ve only had it once. However  I hardly have a hankering for a burrito  so I don t know if I ll ever try that.  I don t believe in diets. They re designed to fail. I do  however  believe in trying to eat as healthy as possible so that I can get drunk on Friday  have awful food  and not feel so bad about it. With our world so full of fast-food options  it can be hard to get something semi-healthy when you re on the run. I decided to stop at Freebirds because I figured they would have some kind of salad option  and I was right. Sure  I could have stopped at McDonald s  but going to McDonald s for a salad is like going to a prostitute for a hug.   I came in around 1 30  and the restaurant was full  but the line was empty  so the lunch rush had died. I ordered from a pretty friendly and cute guy  I m forever boy crazy . He made suggestions as to dressings  made me a delicious salad  and that was that.   I had a chicken salad  white meat  with spring mix lettuce and iceberg lettuce  black beans  corn  tomatoes  red onions  peppers  pico de gallo  cilantro  and tomatillo viniagrette. It was huge and very filling. My suggestion is to skip adding any extra onions if you get pico and peppers  because both of those have onions mixed in as well. I had a few too many onions  and that s weird for me to say because I love onions. Regardless  it gave me dragon breath and had to brush my teeth when I got back to my office to combat that. My advice is to not go here for a date  at least if you re in the early dating stages. When you re comfortable enough to do each others  laundry  I guess it doesn t really matter if you have dragon breath .   I m in this shopping center a lot because there s a Sally s Beauty Supply Store and my pilates studio  so if I m ever in a bind  I ll be sure to stop here.
Freebirds World Burrito,85,Seriously Freebirds. You are amazing  how the hell do you make that bad ass BBQ sauce that I so expertly pour all over my burrito  Your portions are so large I can eat your burrito for days. I love all the options you offer-even though I get the same thing every time. I feel like I should mix it up  but that might throw off my BBQ ratio and I can t risk that.   The staff are friendly  fun  quirky  and best of all- AUSTIN  Even when I come in with a coupon for a free burrito they act like I m the coolest person ever for using my coupon. I love it  Walking distance from my condo  great food  fun peeps. I m all in.
Freebirds World Burrito,86,Part A of the story   The day Michael Jackson left the building I went in here to have dinner.  They were playing back to back Michael Jackson songs so loud you couldn t really hold much of a conversation with anyone.  It was somber  it was eerie and just plain ass freaky.  Everyone there was walking around like a zombie from the air of sadness.  I dunno - just thought it was in poor taste.  It s probably just me to think that  but I do.  Part B of the story   OK somebody  splain it to me how this is such a popular place.  It kinda sucks.  The food is below average and it seems very processed.  The staff is pretty aloof.  The place itself is totally whatever-ville.  The only good thing is that there are a lot of options here.  But if all the options are below average  then you still just have a big o  below average burrito.    Guess I need to ask somebody.
Freebirds World Burrito,87,Best burrito in town.   I live within walking distance and try to make it over here at least once a week.   Everything is good... But the portions... OMG.   YOU CAN GET A BURRITO FOR FOUR    No Hipsters.
Freebirds World Burrito,88,Unlike the other comment...I love this location.  I was super impressed with 2 staff members. I wish I caught their names. They were SO friendly  but not  weird  forced-nice nice . They were 2 heavy set guys...one man had a cap and earrings   looked like his hair was shaved short...the other guy may have been a mgr       no cap  shaved short hair.  I would glance over while I was eating and they just kept those sincere smiles and helped the customers...above and beyond what you would expect in a place like this. My burrito was grand    The soup was really good. I was impressed.
Freebirds World Burrito,89,As a relatively new Austinite and a former denizen of Ohio  where Chipotle is the end all  be all of burrito   I have been told on more than one occasion that I  have not lived  until I try some Freebirds.  Well friends  I ve now lived. And it was glorious. This location -- the first such establishment that I visited -- is incredibly charming  the service was great and the burrito  well  I think you know where I m going with this.  Definitely a step up -- in both atmosphere and food quality -- from Chipotle. Another great  uniquely Austin establishment.
Freebirds World Burrito,90,I love the salads here. I normally make my own with mostly veggies and black beans and carnitas.  I like that it s a local establishment. After I did more research into their competitor  Chipotl   I realized that it wasn t as great of a company as they marketed themselves as.  Freebirds is my new fav 
Freebirds World Burrito,91,Well  I ll start this off by saying I got food poisoning from here last night. Still having stomach cramps almost 24 hours later. Also  google  freebirds food poisoning  and you probably will think twice before going to any freebirds.  That being said  the people who work here are really cool  and the food is OK  so if you have an iron stomach and love trying different burrito places  go for it. It s close to home for me  so if I hadn t got sick here I would have probably continued going occasionally.
Freebirds World Burrito,92,LOVED this place. I m a California transplant who is used to Chipotle. This place was a nice change. I first noticed the restaurant in Fort Worth where I live because of it s unusual name. On our way back home I couldn t help but notice how many of them there were in Austin. So I knew I had to try it.  The service was great  as the server took her time to explain the different sizes and ways I could customize my burrito. I settled on a steak freebird with a spinach tortilla. It looked as if everybody had a cayenne tortilla  but the green color looked cool.  Yeah I m a bit childlike at times  Too bad I couldn t really taste the difference. The pot brownies looked delish next time I ll definitely give it a try  The line wasn t too long on a Sunday afternoon. Good stuff  I ll be back.
Freebirds World Burrito,93,Pretty good. Most of the staff fit the Freebirds model of being laid back and groovy. They are pretty consistent with quality. Store always seems clean fok which is nice.
Freebirds World Burrito,94,Contrary to the song   This Is Why I m Hot   this is why Freebirds is NOT.  This is why we order online   To avoid the slow-moving line run by the attitude-studded personnel behind the counter. The guy who served me basically tossed one measly scoop of everything on my burrito and didn t bother to ask me if I wanted anything after that. My boyfriend s server did all that  even included guacamole and chips. All right  so my man is better looking than I am  but still. I really wish the snickering and snotty attitude would not have been passed across the counter along with his food. Also  my boyfriend s burrito fell apart after a few bites  which goes to show that while my boyfriend s server was busy giggling like a schoolgirl behind the counter to the chick that took five minutes to unwrap a tortilla and warm it  his hands were busy making Play-Doh of my boyfriend s burrito. Uh  hello  we did not come here to play like five-year-olds. But whatever.  This is why I won t be back for awhile   The burrito was smaller than the one that I had a few months ago. I bit into it and couldn t taste a thing  and no  my taste buds were not on drugs. I had a steak burrito on a white flour tortilla wrapped around tomatoes  red white onions  guacamole  where the hell was it    sour cream  yeah  right  it was invisible   rice  black beans  and a cheese mix. The only thing I could taste was the rice  beans  and onions. I have a strong suspicion that flavor was lacking because their ingredients were not fresh. The steak was cold  and even what I could taste felt like it was borderline stale. Wow. I asked myself how this could be after my previous glowing review of this place  and so I look to the previously mentioned song for the conclusion.   I m hot  cuz I m fly  you  Freebirds  ain t  cuz you re not. 
Freebirds World Burrito,95,Thii This is my go to in Austin.  Follows the concept of  Keep Austin Weird .  I  love the  menu changes and how fresh and tasty the burrito s are.  My only complaint is they have not opened in St. Louis.
Freebirds World Burrito,96,I ve discovered something new at Freebird s   The taco.    Yeah  that s right.  I did it.  Remember when the world stopped for a couple of seconds three weeks back   That was me not ordering a burrito at Austin s best fast-food burrito restaurant.    And I don t regret it either   Here s three reasons why    1  All the same ingredients that you can get in a burrito--but in a taco   It s crazy   Want refried beans   Rice   Vegetables   YOU CAN DO IT   2  I m no longer 20 nor can tear through a monster burrito with ease.  If you re like me  and want to be somewhat productive after lunch  three tacos is just the right amount of food.    3  The best part--it s all FREE   OK  not really  but it s only  4.99 for three tacos with a drink included.  If that s not one of the best lunch deals in Austin  then I don t know what is   PS- I d highly recommend the crispy shells.  They re great tasting and seem to hold all the contents better too.  Of course  if you re just feeling dangerous  go with the soft flour as the next best option.  The soft corn should be avoided at all costs.
Freebirds World Burrito,97,Me and Freebirds have a highly unhealthy relationship. I have gone through phases when I ve eaten there 5 times a week. To justify myself  I must say that there was one in San Marcos  and it was one of very few good places to get vegetarian food of any kind. However  the South Lamar location is my new spot  and its just as wonderful.  I recognize that its not even that good  for instance  sometimes the rice to everything else ratio is completely out of control. For some reason though  I just never get sick of it. The portions are outside what is considered healthy  but 5 dollars for that much food  Count me in.   Also  perfecting your burrito is half the fun of the place. Going back time and time again  changing just one thing each time to seek improvement  until finally you ve struck  gold  its magical. Cayenne tortilla  black beans  spanish rice  monterrey jack  garlic  salsa  pico  tomatoes  cilantro  guac  tomatillo  and lime. Theres my perfect  but yours may be completely different  thats the magic.  Freebirds  I wish I could quit you. But I just can t.
Freebirds World Burrito,98,This freebirds always has the nicest staff and never too busy when i go. Thanks guys 
Freebirds World Burrito,99,Having took a 2  year hiatus from visiting freebirds i decided to give them another shot.  Things have changed for the better.  The quality and flavor of their meats is much better  they have better rice choices and a whole lot more veggie choices.  I ended up with the MONSTER  it seems smaller than it was a few years ago but i also think they brought the price down a bit to be more in line with what someone would eat split.  Had the seasoned grilled chicken burrito with just about everything you can put on it.  The Jalepeno Garlic sauce was amazing and highly recommended.  All in all a good refresher and now ill be back more often.
Freebirds World Burrito,100,We re pretty crazy about this Freebird s.  Sometimes the wait can be pretty long  but that s not the case if you order online.  Also  if you have a Freebird s Fanatic card  for every 10 burritos you buy  you get a free Bird in return  which is pretty cool.  I kind of wish they had baby spinach as filling option.  Also  every time we go in there it can be pretty inconsistent as far as how much will be going into your burrito.  We tend to order the same size every time  but sometimes we ll have two scoops of cheese or sometimes a little meat lot of meat or half a bag of chips to a full bag of chips.  Also  if you rev  combo  your meal  be sure they don t charge you extra for the drink.  Other than that  the people are friendly and the food is about what you d expect from Freebird s.  The music is almost always loud and not exactly what I d like to listen to  but there is outdoor seating and the option to take your food  To Go.   Overall  this location is pretty good.
Freebirds World Burrito,101,I love this particular Freebirds.  The staff is stellar   Are you not ever sure what to get when you go here    Sometimes  you just don t know what to order  that s why you talk to the staff who make this great stuff all the time  like I did  and then you know why it s just that good   Let me do the honor of enlightening you   Get this     The Carnitas CRISPY Tacos.   Three Tacos comes in an order.  The focal points should be asking them to combine the Carnitas plus QUESO  not the shredded stuff  the liquid gold is better  plus Refried Beans Plus fresh Cilantro   trust me .....and the rest is up to you....Those main ingredients ARE enough  though   Just doing it that way is an inspiring combination   Successful results guaranteed   If you don t like Carnitas or feel like you need variety in your life  you can get a crispy carnita taco  chicken taco  and then a steak one to complete your trio....just sayin  because they told me you can pick more than one meat per taco.  Variety is that spice of life   Oh and they now serve cilantro lime rice....it is so good   Get the chips and salsa to go with  you know you want to.  The salsa is fresh  light  not mad hot  and has pinch notes of frolicking garlic that will seem like a minor picnic in your mouth   To further this taste marathon  and if you have been a good child  opt for the brownie or the amazing  when fresh especially  you will feel the soft difference  chocolate chip cookie  although I must warn you  the brownies are always immaculate and are very inexpensive for how big they are....and are easily share-able with 2 people     While you are at it  go for some Wild Cherry Pepsi too when you are here and voila   You have let the bird free and had a fantastic treat of a lunch or dinner   They also sell bottled Sweet Leaf teas here in the barrel   The sky is the limit    additional flying positives are  if you plan on going back  get the frequent freebird card  rack up your points to get more free food or a tee shirt  order online to save time  and have fun  life s too short    Keep Flying High  you addictive Free Bird   
Freebirds World Burrito,102,Freebird s is a solid burrito and it blows the doors off of Chipotle.  While they are not my favorite burrito spot in Austin  they do win my favor because of the option to have different size burritos.  Sometimes I do not want need a burrito the size of my head...  This is where Freebird s is king  options.  They give you tons of options  whether it be the size of your burrito to the different meat options to the grilled and fresh veggies.  It is all about getting a burrito created specifically for you.  Even their soda machine has more options than most restaurants offer.  Also the closet tree hugging hippie inside of me likes that they have multiple recycling options including being able to recycle the foil wrapping.  This is not a cheap option for the business so I approve of them going the extra mile to make a difference.  Keep up the good work Freebirds
Freebirds World Burrito,103,I had free birds for the first time after living in Austin my whole life lol at this location the food is amazing  and I applied here too looks like a cool place to work I hope I get the job here 
Freebirds World Burrito,104,Yep  my fiance is the one that sat on a chair that broke underneath him this past Friday night. We LOVE Freebirds   1. Cayenne pepper tortillas are BOSS...but a tad bit spicy 2. Their cookies are better than their brownies 3. Mix pink lemonade and sprite  That is all.
Freebirds World Burrito,105,LOVE FREEBIRDS  In my opinion it s the best build your own burrito in Austin. The Badass BBQ sauce is my personal favorite and I will slather it all over whatever burrito I m getting. I also like all of the tortilla and salsa options. Definitely the place I go for my burrito fix
Freebirds World Burrito,106,I hate chipotle.  And I love freebirds.  But there are a couple of things that need to change.   Whoever starts my order I want to finish my order.   The guy at the end never notices I don t do rice and then subsequently charges me for my guacamole or sour cream.   There are a few people  there that really are radiant and you can tell they are in a good mood.    The girl with the tattoos around her collar and the wicked awesome hair is my favorite.   And the guy working the grill on August 22.   Beard and wears a playboy shirt... He always engages and tries and succeeds to make your order awesome. . A lot of the others just don t care.  Drain the black beans before you put them on the order    I don t want a soggy burrito taco quesadilla.  Chips and a 2.5 oz pour of lukewarm queso is 3.25.   You want a 1.5 oz salsa to go with it    More money.   I love the tacos... Was including chips on a two taco order really breaking your bank      I will keep coming here but damn guys... Let s get better here.   And please don t get irritated when someone tells you how they want their food.   After all... I tip every time...  Even when you are jerky pants .   I would just like a non soggy order and consistency 
Freebirds World Burrito,107,Would give it four stars for the food. Love the options  but not the most amazing burrito place in the history of ever.  It s the staff that totally makes it over here. Everyone is really friendly every time I go in  which is an achievement  since I work next door. I know they have it hard over there  lunch rush can be killer  Totally worth the extra star.  My only complaint is that portion size is pretty big. I usually get enough food to feed myself  my brother  and my dog     Also  beer buckets are also EXTREMELY cheap. Thanks for putting up with all of our after hours mini-benders  guys    D
Freebirds World Burrito,108,Love the salad with steak and all the veggie toppings.  Always fresh  organic  tasty.  Freebirds is a good place for Paleo.
Freebirds World Burrito,109,Lives up to the freebird quality. This location is not as creative as the others I ve been to in Austin  but still cool.
Freebirds World Burrito,110,Freebirds  why must your burritos be so large.  why is it i only want to eat here after drinking too much  things i love at freebirds  bbq sauce ability to make burrito so big it takes me 3 days to eat it. things i dislike  there is not one close to me right now tortilla chips are too hard.  and thank you for sometime letting me get away with ordering from the kids menu
Freebirds World Burrito,111,Great food. Great staff. You can get a giant burrito for  10 if that is what you like. I highly recommend. Queso is great. The vibe is great for that earthy  hippie thing. Freebird s is such a staple of Austin  I think. They offer vegetarian options and because it is set up to where you can add what you want  it is great if you are a picky eater.
Freebirds World Burrito,112,The food is great The service is great The music is way way way to loud. I asked. The  manager to turn it down and. He told me it was corporate policy to blowout my ear drums. I still eat there  I just wear hearing protection  really 
Freebirds World Burrito,113,I have eaten at several different Freebirds and I didn t particularly care for this location.  We waited at the counter probably 5 minutes before anyone actually acknowledged us  but they were nice once they decided to finally take our order.  The food was OK. The rice kind of had a weird taste to it and was a little softer than it should have been.  I do enjoy their little self-serve salsa station though.    I imagine we ll come back at some point because it s closer than the Congress location  but it won t be anytime soon.  It wasn t bad  but it wasn t great in my opinion.  Since my husband seemed to like his burrito more than I enjoyed mine and since they have a lot of options  I gave it three instead of two stars.
Freebirds World Burrito,114,Oh  how I miss FREEBIRDS  First few months of living in austin and when I first tried this place  it was SO GOOD   You had so many options to choose from of what you want in your burrito and it always seems huge and fresh. I could never finish my order  but at least I always had dinner  not to mention  I loved the different  flavor  type of tortilla wrap.  The chips and salsa is tasty and again fresh...  One time I tried Chipotle  and it was SO NOT WORTH IT and doesn t compare to Freebirds. This place is like the  authentic  burrito place...I wouldn t go anywhere else...and living in the Pac NW  guess I don t have a choice..   If you re in Texas where there is a Freebirds  you gotta try it 
Freebirds World Burrito,115,I just came to get my burritos and I m very disappointed with my service. The person making my burrito overfilled it  and added black beans when I told her twice that I didn t want any beans. I m seriously disappointed as I frequented this establishment and have always gotten great service. This is unacceptable.
Freebirds World Burrito,116,In my opinion this place is way better than chipotle. The ingredients taste way more natural and fresh and the atmosphere is very cool and great music playing. The staff is always very friendly and they get you in and out fast.   I recommend their steak burrito bowl because it is amazing. Not too overpriced either which is nice. I eat here at least once a week and I look forward to it everytime.
Freebirds World Burrito,117,Been eating at Freebirds for awhile have never been to the south location  so was in the area and stopped there for lunch. The staff was cordial  but i have never had an employee at any other Freebirds shake all the chicken out of the spoon below the spoon line  If I m paying  8 for a burrito  i would hope they d at least fill it to the line.  Maybe a bit petty  but I own a restaurant and never skimp on the main ingredient  or at least serve what I advertise.
Freebirds World Burrito,118,This certainly isn t your typical Freebirds. I  didn t see anyone with a tattoo or a piercing. However  this one redeemed my faith again in Freebirds as the burrito and staff was excellent. Food was hot and fresgh  no line  and it was very clean.
Freebirds World Burrito,119,Really great steak tacos   I would imagine everything else there is great too  but now that I ve had that  I can t seem to force myself to try anything else   The place is pretty fun too.  Lots of color and good music.  Seems very Austin-y.
Freebirds World Burrito,120,I used to like Freebirds.  I used to even like this location.  But I went here on Saturday to get a chicken freebird  and I probably won t be back anytime soon.  The first major problem was their ladies restroom  I had to take my 5 year old in there to use it  and it was the stankiest place I ve been in quite some time.  He held his nose the whole time while in there.  I think they are having a serious plumbing issue.  I hope they fix it soon  but I won t be back to find out.  Second big problem  the mild green salsa tasted rotten  like it was turning fermented.  Which of course I found out after pouring a healthy amount onto my burrito.  Blech.  Third  I don t think I like the flavor of their chicken anymore.  Can t say why exactly  I just know that I like other chicken  i.e.  Cabo Bob s and Chipotle  a whole lot more.  Something about the way they season it here turns off my tastebuds.  So anyway  it was a subpar experience.  The service was friendly  I ll give them that.  But I think I ll get my burritos elsewhere from here on out.  Now what to do with my loyalty card point balance...
Freebirds World Burrito,121,I m adding a star for playing Led Zepplin. The food was kind of icky. The grilled veggies were most certainly not grilled  as they were kind of slimy. The lettuce tasted old  and there was a big chunk of rubbery  underripe avocado in the guac. The only tasty stuff in the whole burrito was the grilled chicken and the tortilla. Fail.
Freebirds World Burrito,122,Order online. The ordering process takes three times as long as it does to eat your food. Food s better than average but not great. Friendly staff  but lacking consistency in preparation. I find the volume that goes into my burrito fluctuates wildly. Cool interior - love the decor  like the statue of liberty on the Harley  and the foil animal menagerie. Think Chipotle  but better food and a touch of originality.
Freebirds World Burrito,123,This place is really amazing if you pre-drink or hotbox in the car. The burritos are usually big in size and really filling. I hate burrito joints where they charge you extra for stuff that should otherwise belong in a burrito. Guacamole  cheese  etc. The problem is their burritos are really inconsistent. It depends on who is building your meal. Sometimes they ll hook you up with a lot of meat and other condiments with no problem. Other times you ll get half the amount. We went in last weekend and I had this borderline anorexic girl making my burrito. I knew I was screwed. My burrito looked like a taquito by the time I got it. I asked for more than the teaspoon of cheese she put in it and she said it would cost 50 cents extra. My girlfriend ordered the exact same thing next to me and her burrito was the size of a newborn baby. LAME 
Freebirds World Burrito,124,Tried the bowl for the first time with steak and it was great. This mag be my new favorite.  The tortilla almost make it too much to eat.  The habanero sauce was extremely hot which still has my lips burning as a type this review in.
Freebirds World Burrito,125,Love the food here. Friendly staff. Lost one star because of the grunge factor.  I got a hybird on cayenne with dark chicken. Added cilantro  onion  salsa  corn and hot tomatillo sauce. Great combination 
Freebirds World Burrito,126,Freebirds is an awesome Austin staple and a great local alternative to Chipotle.  I have to give them major props for always being super friendly and helpful at this particular Freebirds and putting up with my high maintenance picky food needs and wants. They guy that helped us last time even went so far as to get a fresh container of onions out of the walk in to ensure they had not been contaminated by jalapenos  I ve always been a Freebirds fan  but I am so glad to have one so close to where we live with a nice  friendly staff 
Freebirds World Burrito,127,Notice this place tacked on a tip when a tip wasn t specified on a TO-GO order. Check your bank statements.
Freebirds World Burrito,128,great family environment service dog friendly great   amp  friendly staff who are eager to get your order right
Freebirds World Burrito,129,So I actually wasn t a huge fan until I tried their burrito bowels. I can t finish their freakin  huge burritos but the awesome bowel lets you take it home and eat it another day without a soggy nasty taco  I know they ve had it for a while but I m sold now.
Freebirds World Burrito,130,The day after Halloween  I was a bit hungover and tired. I craved an awesome Freebird s burrito and this location is actually close to my house. We were served quickly and not rushed. Great staff  friendly nice and very cute  which made the experience that much more awesome. I love the decor and I think it symbolizes everything in Austin. I normally don t go to this shopping center  because it s a very suburban type atmosphere and really doesn t cater to my style. But Freebird s is going to keep me coming to this location  Thanks 
Freebirds World Burrito,131,Way better than Chip______.  Good variety of tortillas and fillings.  I love the variety of sides and fillings.  This is my go to place for burritos.
Freebirds World Burrito,132,When we lived in Austin  my hubby and I used to make the 30 minute drive from our house every Friday night JUST to eat here. Their tacos are amazing  as is their bbq salsa and queso. AND they actually have healthy choices for my healthnut husband  which is a HUGE plus. Now that I live in Nevada  the closest one is like 2 hours away and sometimes I feel like I m going to die if I don t get my FB fix  Miss this place  hoping they bring one to the Reno Tahoe area soon   
Freebirds World Burrito,133,Quick  filling  vegan friendly  and cheap.  I really like that Freebirds offers a variety of sizes and flavors of tortillas.  Sometimes I m a pig  sometimes I try and pretend that I m not.  Their ingredients don t seem as fresh as Chipotle  but maybe its because I ve only been in toward the end of the night.  The atmosphere is laid back and the staff is pleasant.  Freebirds is a go 
Freebirds World Burrito,134,Freebirds is one of my favorite things about Texas. I ve never had a bad experience at this location. Today my nachos were the best ever. I didn t get the guy s name who made them  but he was a nacho master  he put the perfect amount of everything. The atmosphere was perfectly-austin as always.
Freebirds World Burrito,135,I got the smallest size they offered- it was plenty. And my stomach is built to handle large portions.   I think their burritos are great value for money  with an nice choice of fillings.  Cant really go wrong for a cheap lunch.
Freebirds World Burrito,136,I always trust a restaurant when I order something vegetarian that it will indeed be so.  My error in trusting  I guess  since my veggie burrito somehow had chunks of chicken in it.  So disgusted with this place for letting meat get into their other ingredients.
Freebirds World Burrito,137,Freebirds catering is amazing  The food is delivered quickly for the right price. The burritos and bowls are amazing  Christa  the catering manager  can help you with all of your party needs  Go Freebirds 
Freebirds World Burrito,138,I am not the biggest fan of huge burritos but when I need something quick and easy Freebirds is always an option. I have always been a Chipotle fan  but Freebirds is a nice alternative. They have a different edge to them from Chipotle. I do like their salads because they give you a choice of romaine or mixed greens and give you a decent amount of meat. Some places are pretty stingy on the amount of meat they give you but Freebirds does a good job to make sure you have enough. The food does not always look the freshest and sometimes can look a bit greasy but it does the trick if you need to grab something easy for lunch or dinner. They also have an array of hot sauces. My favorites are the steak and chicken. I am not a fan of their carnitas. It is too salty and has this odd taste to it. Service is decent.
Freebirds World Burrito,139,Chipotle is better. Freebirds has cool decor  nice staff  but the food isn t that fresh all the time...plan better 
Freebirds World Burrito,140,Healthy food  friendly staff  outdoor seating  cheap - how could someone rate it less than 5 stars  Split a Monster  beans on the side  sub guac for cheese  can t do better anywhere.
Freebirds World Burrito,141,So much better than chipotle. Mainly cause they ve got queso. Statue of liberty on a motorcycle and people s foil artwork everywhere. Love to come here and get a chicken and black bean burrito on spinach.
Freebirds World Burrito,142,I didn t like this location.  I m beginning to not like Freebirds at all.  The steak wasn t well done enough for me and it wasn t cut all the way through.  It was still a good Freebirds experience  I just didn t like my burrito this time.  I will try it again just to be sure.
Freebirds World Burrito,143,Had never been before this month  have been 3 times since. Each time perfecting my burrito. Last time I went it got really crowded but the staff handled it well and it was cool when the manager gave the staff a big verbal pat on the back when they made it through the rush. Guaranteed leftovers and great sauces. I will gain weight because of this establishment.
Freebirds World Burrito,144,I would always pass by Freebirds and was always curious but never went to them. Well one night roomy was wanting some so we went to this location. At first I didn t get any but then I tried his burrito and it won me over. I ve gone here twice now and I must say I LOVE this place  I think it even may win me over from Cabo Bob s. My only problem with Cabo Bob s is they skimp a lot when making your burrito. It s gotten BAD lately since I have been going. They barely put any ingredients and the burritos have gotten smaller. But not Freebirds. They load the burrito up and do not skimp whatsoever. The burritos are so big and full that you ll have left overs for the next day. That is what I love about this place and I hope they continue to do it that way. Chipotle I haven t eaten in years and really don t plan on it because they are too expensive. Their fixings are unique also. Overall I am a fan of this place and definitely plan on eating here more often.
Freebirds World Burrito,145,The food that my husband and I had was really good and the service was okay  some people seemed a bit lost. What I didn t like was the noise level  it is VERY loud not just loud. Also  I didn t like size of the dining area  it s JUST TOO small.
Freebirds World Burrito,146,What happened to Freebirds   Went back after being out of state for about 10 years and was sorely disappointed.  Staff was great. Food was barely edible. Carnitas were gamey  rice was crunchy  beans were hard  steak was too salty to eat. So bummed. Might not venture back in there.
Freebirds World Burrito,147,A Mission-Style burrito chain  whose first location outside of California was in College Station. Freebird s is sort of like Chipotle  but with all the flavor sucked out. Go go Freebirds if you like large quantities of bland food.
Freebirds World Burrito,148,This place is like chipotle but far better. The selections of tortillas is more  they don t skimp on their portions  ahem ahem  and they re local. They use quality ingredients and have a frequent dining reward loyalty program...
Freebirds World Burrito,149,This is the frist Freebirds location I visited and it started my addiction. The employee at the front was very helpful with first time suggestions and the burrito was excellent 
Freebirds World Burrito,150,Freebirds  food is bland and boring. The staff  particularly the manager Nick  are rude and uninviting. I had a staff person apologize to me for Nick s behavior. I m all for a relaxed and laid back atmosphere  but there s a bright line between being chill and being dismissive. I was unimpressed from the start and nothing has made me want to ever go back.
Freebirds World Burrito,151,Hmmmmm....second and last visit. Had the bowl and both times was amazed at the super careful portions...one small even scoup of rice and beans and dusting of cheese. You would think they were serving top of the line gourmet imported specialty items and not rice and beans. Over cooked nuked tasting rice and very bland possibly cannoned beans. It was beyond bland but I know spices are expenive....seems like cost corners are being cut to the bone. The cook was also the cashier.  Bottom line expensive for a carefully portioned bland bowl of beans and overly soft instant rice. Skip.
Freebirds World Burrito,152,If you know what to expect from Freebirds  this place is typical burrito fare. This location is smaller than the Congress location  but every time I have been there I have been in and out quickly  unlike on Congress . The food itself is good - I don t consider any of the burrito places anything special - but when you crave a burrito or a simply a quick and easy meal  this place fits the bill.
Freebirds World Burrito,153,I really like the food at Freebirds  but the music in the place is WAY too loud and I cannot imagine it appeals to a broad  general audience.  We debate whether or not to go based on their bad music.  I would give it a higher grade if it weren t for that.
Freebirds World Burrito,154,Very good choice of ingredients here although eating healthy is a challenge.  The staff acts offended if you don t tip  I ve noticed this at this location more than once.  If you re underpaid  talk to your boss or go work somewhere else.  I tip when I have a waitperson.  One time I tipped at another location and they didn t even thank me.  At TechRidge location  the manager always asks how my food is during my meal but I have yet to experience that at this location or the one on South Congress.  Cabo Bob s is really head and shoulders above these guys.  Freebirds started in College Station and the wild decorations up in the air are awesome.  But they could learn a lot from Cabo Bob s ingredients.  Not much you can do if you want grilled onions but no bell peppers  they mix them together here from some stupid reason.  Frequent diner program is lame.  Very lame nutritionally too  based on their site s nutrition info .  Not particularly nutricious  but that s admittedly hard to find at a fast food place.  They should have charro beans  not just pintos and black  another area Cabo Bob s kicks their collective bootays.  In a pinch it s not bad if a little pricey for what you get  another reason I almost never tip here .   The corn pico is a little to spicy hot for my taste.  Mango salsa would be so much better   Cabo Bob s baby.  In fact  I really even prefer Chipotle Mexican Grill by a little  at least they offer a burrito bowl.
La Peña,1,Wow  lots of undeserved negative reviews for La Pe a. I think if you are expecting something akin to Torchy s -- ie  covered in cheese and smothered in sauce -- you may not like what these guys have to offer. The tacos offered here are simpler as breakfast tacos should be  And yes  they are pre-made but I think they are still plenty fresh tasting at 8 or 9am.  Now I hadn t been here in a few years but recently started a new job downtown and am shocked at the limited taco options downtown. There s a Taco Deli a block away  which I am a fan of  but La Pe a has a secret weapon  their veggie chorizo and egg taco  Oh man  it s just as good as I remember  whatever they use for veggie chorizo is so flavorful and has just a hint of sweetness -- maybe it s just me but I think this is the best veggie chorizo I ve tasted.  Another shout-out to their green salsa  which has a nice kick to it. It s similar to Taco Deli s do a but even more similar to the green sauces at Taco-Mex or Tacolote -- same salsa family but a little thinner  a little sweeter  and just a tad less spicy than the famous do a. It s really good    So for those of us who like simpler breakfast tacos and... hate Torchy s bastardization of the breakfast taco  La Pe a is a great option in the downtown insanity.
La Peña,2,Delightful taco shop art gallery to stop by for a quick bite. They have many options of vegetarian   bacon friendly tacos for  2 each. There are your usual red green salsas and pico de gallo all with a good level of spice. Flour tortillas. There s also coffee and pastries like pan dulce.  Love the featured artist area in the back  by the tables.
La Peña,3,Was visiting Austin for QuiltCon and wanted to try somewhere local for breakfast since we had time before our flights. Their breakfast tacos are top notch  absolutely delicious and really affordable. The art was really cool and we loved the tradition of the exhibit. Would definitely recommend stopping by this gem 
La Peña,4,The food  tacos  were highly disappointing at La Pena  I was attending a conference in Austin and I did a quick search during lunch hour to see what places looked great and were close to me. La Pena stuck out to me  cool place with beautiful artwork. I figured it would be a fun place to kill time before the next workshop. I was unfortunately wrong. This place was bizarre. I walked in and it was empty  just one woman behind the counter. There was no kitchen I could see so was wondering where the tacos came from. They are evidently catered in. They only had one type of taco left and it wasn t even late in the day  carne which was disappointing. A guy came out with another case with some black bean tacos so I took one of each. I was so confused as to where these tacos came from.  I took a seat and unwrapped the tinfoil around my measly tacos and add salsa which was the best part.  The woman who worked behind the counter was not inviting in the slightest  it almost felt like she didn t want me to be there. There was no music playing  no one in the joint and the woman working started vacuuming the space when I was still there which was so loud. I quickly grabbed my stuff and headed out. Really disappointing  and not quite sure what it even was. Two stars for the art.
La Peña,5,Such a hidden gem.   My friend invited me to a poetry reading at La Pena this past weekend and it just reminded me of every reason that I love locally owned and operated shops in town. After hearing the owner s story of how they had to move from another location in downtown and how they had to change their vision to keep their business going  I was amazed. This is the kind of place where you can tell that they clearly put heart into every detail  customer service  and supporting the arts. When you get the chance  I would highly recommend checking the place out for their breakfast tacos  about  1.50 each which is a total steal  and art pieces. This place is a glowing 10 10 
La Peña,6,Hands down  the best place to go for some good cheap  2 tacos  It helped that my hotel  the JW Marriot  was literally right around the corner. I came here 3 days in a row. It was definitely worth trudging through a couple rainy mornings. I tried the Chorizo  amp  Egg  which was by far my favorite. It had plenty of flavor and eating two of those filled me up. I also tried the Egg  amp  Cheese and the Sausage  amp  Egg  which just weren t quite as good. The sausage seemed a little too tough to chew. The owners of this fine establishment were very nice and will talk to you if you have the time. Of course  you will probably need to get out of the way constantly because so many locals come through. They also have art showings which I did not have the chance to check out but it s just another neat little thing they do for this town. I will be back again if my job leads me near 
La Peña,7,Favorite place to grab a simple  authentic breakfast taco downtown  I m obsessed with the black bean and cheese  The only bad reviews sound like they re from tourists who probably should have gone to Tacodeli or Torchy s.
La Peña,8,I spent a week in Austin and the cheapest breakfast I could find was about 10 bucks until I found La Pe a. The tacos were hot and fresh  the green sauce is unbelievable. If I could buy the green sauce in bulk I would. One taco and a coffee was just under four dollars. Two tacos and a coffee came to  6.50.
La Peña,9,Completely blah  meh  boring  dry  uninteresting breakfast tacos.
La Peña,10,This place opens at 8  not 9 as yelp has it shown. Total amount per taco is  2.50 after tax which is still a solid price. Pretty basic tacos  but tasty and served hot. I d go back for a quick taco on the go.
La Peña,11,Great little hole in the Wall spot with super cheap   2  breakfast tacos.  The worker actually gave us a third taco for free when we bought two because she wanted to see what we thought of the veggie chorizo  it was good  
La Peña,12,I don t get ANY of the negative reviews here.  I popped in to this unassuming spot to get exactly what I found  a super affordable  quick  warm  authentic meal to start my day.  They pre make their burritos and tacos but each is fresh and labeled clearly for diet and allergy aware humans. I get some people who are staying at the nearby swanky hotels could turn their nose up at this local charmer  but I got a full  happy tummy for 3 bucks. I m sure you could go around the corner and pay  20 to have the same thing on a pretty plate  but who needs that noise  I ve got shit to do. In fact  I ll take one for the road. Thanks  La Pena. Sincerely  A Hungry Traveler.
La Peña,13,I was utterly charmed by this place as I walking by and had to stop. I almost overlooked it  but I m glad I entered this art gallery   taco shop. The art show they were hosting features the artwork of students From a local elementary. The lady who attended to us did a great job of explains what exactly they were about. If I wasn t merely visiting Austin  i would definitely return... not only is the art great but the tacos were delicious. A great little surprise.
La Peña,14,What a great find. Located on Congress Street near all the hotels and a great alternative to the pricier eateries in the area. Their breakfast tacos are only two dollars each and they are tasty. If you re looking for something quick affordable and delicious I highly recommend this place.
La Peña,15,Hmm...came here to try the breakfast tacos because of the great reviews. At first we thought we might be in the wrong place because when you walk in all you see is a tiny area and what looks like a to-go counter.   The tacos are pre-made and kept in a heated cabinet. I tried the potato egg and the chorizo egg. They weren t bad either but nothing special...definitely not worthy of the 4 star average they had on yelp.   Even though there was only one other person in the restaurant and the guy at the counter looked bored before we got there  the tables were dirty - which was a big turnoff.   The one cool thing was the art on the walls - it looked like the place has potential to be a cool little hangout but they need to improve the tacos and train the staff to keep up w the cleanliness of the place.   IMHO  I d pass on this place if I were you....lots of other good options for breakfast tacos in Austin.  - 
La Peña,16,I skipped Taco Deli tacos across the street for this place as it the yelp pictures made it seem more authentic. Employee behind the register had no desire in offering any advice and think he was half asleep. Its not often you find a place with bad breakfast tacos. I mean how can you screw up bacon and eggs.  Well  this place succeeds perfectly at it.  Tacos were about as bland as I ve ever had. Bacon tasted like it was heated up in a microwave. Actually the whole taco tasted like it was made a day ago and put in a warmer.   There wasn t a bug in my food so it gets an extra star for at least being editable. Not worth the money at all  You re better off going across the street to the coffee shop to get Taco Deli tacos.
La Peña,17,Today was my first time going to this place. I ordered a chorizo with eggs and then I asked the guy at the register for a recommendation. He recommended beef fajita taco since I told him I already have a chorizo with cheese I wanted something else besides bacon and cheese. Walked back to work only to find I got an egg and cheese taco and a chorizo taco...   Pretty disappointed.  I was really looking forward to the beef fajita... however both tacos tasted great but I would check the bag before you leave just to make sure you got what you paid for.   Also their phone number on yelp does not work. Tried calling three times and it s just a busy tone.   Would ve been a 4 or 5 Star had I got the taco I actually ordered.
La Peña,18,Meh... You let me down Austin Yelpers  but I forgive you. 4.5 stars for this  taqueria   4.5 stars is fake news for fake  tacos  folks  but of course I hail from San Francisco where 4.5 stars for a taqueria means something.  Pancho Villa  Los Coyotes    The  tacos  here aren t even made on the premises and come from a warmer...wtf   But hey  At  2 a pop the price is right 
La Peña,19,We went here for breakfast tacos  which were okay. The bacon and potato choice was better  the chorizo and potato wasn t as tasty -- the sausage was ground quite fine and was surprisingly bland. Both were enlivened with squirts of Valentina hot sauce.   There is also a little attached art gallery  catering to local and folk art  one section was kids  art from a school project.  This is convenient to downtown but not the greatest choice  I feel.
La Peña,20,Good for what it is.  Very cheap breakfast wraps tasting just Ok.  Adequate lunch for  4.50  so all is aligned.  Space is an art gallery  rough  but interesting.  Nice servers.
La Peña,21,During SXSW  it got late one day  and I had not had lunch. I spied La Pena - I had never been inside before - and there I purchased two soft tacos. They were fresh and truly wonderful. I ll definitely be back. Most people know La Pena for its art and cultural presentations  smiles - but don t forget the tacos.

La Peña,22,Great breakfast tacos at a reasonable price  But  they were not the best I had in Austin  hence the 4 instead of 5.   The salsa is delicious 
La Peña,23,Breakfast taco was already prepared.  The food was hot.  The pricing is wonderful.  The food remained hot until I got back to my desk.  Definitely worth a buy.
La Peña,24,These tacos r mediocre at best.  Cute cafe no doubt but not worth altering ur course for these tacos.    Salsa is even more important for me.  It was good but too hot...left my mouth EN FUEGO     There was no milder sauce.  TAKE IT EASY ON US.  Definitely nothing special. Just OK.
La Peña,25,Grabbed a couple quick breakfast tacos. They were just meh... They were sitting in a big warming oven and are not made on site. 2 bucks a pop.  The guy was friendly 
La Peña,26,This is a great place to get breakfast tacos near downtown. I always get their bacon and egg breakfast taco with the housemade salsa. Most of their tacos are just 2 dollars so it s a great place to get cheap breakfast tacos on the go.
La Peña,27,Great location  friendly owner  delicious food  very reasonable price.  What else can you want   The store is right downtown  next to the JW Marriott I stayed.  At this area  I am pleasantly surprised you can buy a breakfast taco and a beef fajita for about 4 dollars.  And it is not a food truck.  It is a very neat store with interesting decoration.  The owner is friendly and give me some suggestion about the activities I can do while staying in Austin.  The taco and fajita are pre made with label.  But since I was there early  they were warm and soft just like freshly made.  The filling is full and delicious.  The beef fajita is very flavorful.  The filling of breakfast taco is not salty.  With the salsa they are just perfect.  At this location with a physical store  their price is more than reasonable.  Visiting this place  rally make my day.
La Peña,28,Had a couple tasty and decent sized tacos for  4 including leaving a modest tip for the dude at the counter. Bacon egg cheese and chorizo and egg were my choices. Good salsa with good flavor and a little kick to it.   Gotta level-set your expectations a bit  this is a small corner grocery and Latin activist art gallery  not a full service kitchen. Hence  the tacos are pre-made  but still pretty good. It s a walk for me past Jo s and Austin Java  but I resist plunking down  7 or 8 for a couple smallish tacos at those places.
La Peña,29,Had the breakfast tacos.  Neither of us could finish them and later had cramps.  Very underwhelming.  Not sure why this place is rated so high.
La Peña,30,A very small art gallery and coffee shop quaint and excellent service would recommend friends and family enjoy.
La Peña,31,Beautiful art and tasty tacos   The service was amazing as it s run by two sister and definitely has a family feel to it   2384748 10 rec
La Peña,32,La Pena s breakfast taco shop is excellent  cheap  fast. The salsa and coffee -- which they could easily  not  take any effort to make sure are better than decent -- are both really great. The people who work there are all awesome to boot.   I ve been coming back to La Pena every time I visit Austin for the past 10 years or so -- and there s a good reason it s become my go-to breakfast spot whenever I m not having a  sit down  breakfast.
La Peña,33,It s all right.  I mean  there s a lot of good Mexican food around  and there was nothing particularly noteworthy about this place.  Solid food  would get them another star in a town with fewer alternatives  but in Austin  well  I ve had better.  I wouldn t turn down in invitation to eat here  though.
La Peña,34,Let me start on a positive note  tasty and vegetarian friendly. Great art inside. SUPER cheap. All good things.   But.   Are these typical breakfast tacos  They re my first and they re pretty...underwhelming. I mean  they re tasty for sure  but it s literally just the ingredients listed in a flour tortilla. I make these at home all the time so my socks aren t knocked off. I guess since Austin is known for breakfast tacos  I was just expecting more.  Maybe I picked the wrong spot for my first day in Austin  first breakfast taco experience.    Also  they don t make the tacos here. They re done by a catering company and delivered.
La Peña,35,What a find   Amazing catered fajitas. Love the art. I m only sorry I wasn t here in the morning for the the breakfast tacos.  Steak fajita  chicken fajita  bean  amp  bacon burrito  and a 32oz Smartwater. . . under  8. . . JACKPOT   
La Peña,36,Great  perfect delicious breakfast burritos. Yum. Odd little unassuming place but just what we were looking for in the burrito department 
La Peña,37,Would have been nice to know that the breakfast tacos are the ONLY thing this place serves  before I walked the six blocks to get here. That said  they are tasty  if not what I d planned on having for lunch.
La Peña,38,Breakfast tacos shared with Spanish-speaking-only patrons for  3.  Best breakfast in town.   And they have soy chorizo   Which  by the way  if you have never tried  tastes precisely like the real stuff  except you have the knowledge that you have not eaten animal parts that are best not spoken of.  Absolutely recommend.
La Peña,39,Awesome quick  tasty  affordable taco joint. The tacos are pre made just FYI. But authentic Mexican style. 2 tacos and a cola for under  5 and no food coma. Great lunch spot  excited to check out the breakfast tacos tomorrow
La Peña,40,This was a great place. We went only because of the yelp rating and as usual it was correct. Service and food excellent.
La Peña,41,Cool little place serving catered breakfast tacos.  They have tables where you can eat in-house if need be.  Really inexpensive   I just ate 3 and paid less than  5.  I go there a couple times week as my office is across the street...
La Peña,42,Walked into this place a few days ago looking for breakfast tacos and definitely scored. As the last couple of reviewers said the tacos are really cheap and tasty. I tried the veggie chorizo and it was incredibly flavorful and not too greasy. The pinto bean and white cheese  not sure what kinda - maybe Oaxaca    taco was great as well.   The place has a really nice  cozy atmosphere with a few wooden tables and chairs to sit and look at the art work around. When I was there they had some cool Dia De Los Muertos altars up. Also the lady there is friendly and a good conversationalist. I hope places like these remain in downtown Austin because it would be a shame to lose places that give it personality like this little cafe and gallery.
La Peña,43,Love this place  Great breakfast tacos and they are always displaying unique and beautiful art. These are the owners of the classic  but now closed  Las Manitas restaurant. Cynthia and Libby are the authentic  activist Hispanic women of Austin s past. Worth a visit if only for a slice of old Austin.
La Peña,44,Great food. Weak service. Breakfast burritos are the best. I need to go back for Breakfast .
La Peña,45,Let me first say to get a 5  a place needs to blow my mind so much  I want to go back everyday. This place is a strong 4  Two dollar breakfast tacos  cool atmosphere  kind employees  The chorizo and potato taco was amazing. I also got bacon and egg  which was just okay. It s tasty just because  but add that it s  2 - it s a super value. Salsa was yummy. Lots of locals. I m happy we went  and would go back  but I also want to try other places - this the 4.
La Peña,46,The tacos were  1.40 as of this review 8 22 2012 . In any case  cheap and pretty good. They also had my beloved  refried pinto  Bean  amp  Cheese tacos which the hideout stopped getting in the mornings. The salsa was of the fresh variety as well.  There were probably other things in there  but I had The Hunger  and so turned blind eyes to everything else that didn t immediately pique that instinct.
La Peña,47,Wow  This is a hidden gem for sure  Two dollars per taco  Great deal. Also  there salsa was fresh and tasted really good. Great customer service. You would have no idea that this place served tacos. I m definitely coming back again for some breakfast tacos  Thank you La Pena   
La Peña,48,A couple weeks ago I passed by this gallery and discoverd and exhibit on display  Generaciones   which represented the art work of women and various high school students from around the city....All of the artwork was very impressive   One piece I quickly took notice to was that of Ana Vasquez  which is a watercolor and ink on paper...I had to have it....I asked David  who is the director of the gallery if he would allow me to make two payments on the piece within a short period of time and he arranged that for me...Thankfully   I truly love the piece and I hope that I was able to help this young artist....I think it is of the utmost importance to help support all artists   Thank you Ana and hope to see more of you work soon 
La Peña,49,Cheap  delicious tacos    Only  1.40 each  it was perfect    The lady working there was really nice too 
La Peña,50,Excellent authentic tacos  Chicken Fajita  bean and cheese  chorizo and egg... All very tasty. The pico was perfect and the salsa was fantastic. Don t waste money in a fancy Mexican restaurant. Get your taco s here 
La Peña,51,My tTwo favorites were the chorizo with egg and chorizo with potato. They are small but delicious  and at  1.40 each it s easy to adjust quantity to match appetite. I had four and I m stuffed. Best  6 breakfast so far 
La Peña,52,It s a good place for eating tacos and buy art just they need to upload the schedule ... Regards
La Peña,53,Great tacos      And so many choices   Good place if you want a bite to eat    I recommend the chicken or vegetarian. Haven t had the steak one to be honest. Also great because they usually have an art exhibit going on from different pets of the community.
La Peña,54,This is a review on the delicious breakfast tacos - only  1  They also have Mexican sodas and some delicious looking pan dulce  and fruit empanadas. You can get your morning coffee here as well  though I haven t tried it so can t vouch for how good it is. Cash only - so make sure to have a few dollars on you   
La Peña,55,It s amazing there is still a place to grab cheap  tasty breakfast tacos in the middle of Touristville. A lot of their customers seem to be construction workers  but they have veggie chorizo and egg tacos  and the potato and egg are also quite good if you re not a carnivore. I grab them on the way to work and my walk is long enough that I have to reheat them  but they re still good.
La Peña,56,DroppEd by for a quick bite and found good  cheap  amp  authentic tacos. Salsa was exemplary  and hot  . What a deal. Plus  it s a community arts space. What s not to love  
La Traila at Mesa,1,I had the sausage and egg on flour tortilla breakfast taco with their green sauce. Delish   The horchata was very good too. Definitely going back for more 
La Traila at Mesa,2,Breakfast tacos were delicious- we had migas  chorizo  sausage  and bacon.  We ordered a bunch for a group and they came out very quick 
La Traila at Mesa,3,So good  can t go wrong with any option  super fast and cheap and love that it s walking distance from me  The Gringa is my favorite 
La Traila at Mesa,4,SO SAD. I was incredibly hopeful this was going to be AH-MAZING  but instead  it fell a bit flat. I m a huge fan of the sauce. I believe the sauce is what ties everything together when it comes to breakfast tacos. However... the sauce was so mediocre  I actually THREW IT AWAY  GASP . I m torn.   I ordered the Migas and the Potato and Egg Breakfast Tacos. If you are a migas enthusiast  you know migas is a compilation of crushed tostadas  eggs  tomatoes  chiles  and onions mixed with cheese. For some strange reason... La Traila adds refried beans to their mix... which completely takes away from the classics of a migas.
La Traila at Mesa,5,Tasty good tacos.  Be prepared for a line on the weekends.  Tacos are good sized but not huge.  I d be sure to get two.  Lots of tacos have many ingredients but it is just enough of each rather than a huge over stuffed taco.  Can t wait to go back and explore the menu further beyond the breakfast tacos.
La Traila at Mesa,6,Solid Tacos coming from a tiny trailer...Service was good...Tortillas were really good...picked up 3 Bacon   Egg and Cheese...Hot  fresh and cheesy...Hot sauce had a great kick. We were headed out for a walk at St. Edwards and these hit the spot...Would definitely go back. Lot of ToGo traffic.
La Traila at Mesa,7,Honestly  I m from the valley near the border of Mexico so finding semi decent Mexican tacos around Austin is impossible. La traila on the other hand really impressed me  their tortillas are super fresh and just how homemade Mexican tortillas should taste like. The inside was a omelette of goodness. I got el flako which is eggs  mushrooms  spinach  tomatoes  onion  and cheese served with real salsa verde. If you go YOU RE IN FOR A TREAT 
La Traila at Mesa,8,Fresh ingredients and quick service make this a great place.  I ve only been here for breakfast  but Migas taco is worth the trip.  I d give it a 5  but tortillas aren t made on site  warm  but not fresh.
La Traila at Mesa,9,Stumbled upon this place in the corner of a gas station parking lot across Anderson High School. It turned out to be a pretty great experience.   When it comes to tacos  I have a few go-to s and favorites that I use to judge a place. I went with migas  tripas  and carne asada. All three were well done with the tripas being the best of the group. I know some people may not be a huge fan of tripe  but as someone who grew up in South Texas  good tripe on a homemade corn tortilla  topped with onion and cilantro is as good as it gets. This place definitely passed the test  The migas was pretty good as well  a notch or two below Veracruz   while the carne asada was above average. The tacos came with a mild red orange salsa and a fiery hot green salsa  so be careful if you re sensitive to spice.   Overall  this is a great spot to pick up a quick and cheap lunch. Everything came out to about  8 and the tacos came out hot and fresh in less than 5 minutes.
La Traila at Mesa,10,These are the most heavenly tacos. Ever. Came here on a whim when the line at Torchy s was ridiculously long and I m officially hooked. Everything tastes super fresh and the prices are great  My favorite by far are the al pastor tacos. This place is truly a hidden gem.
La Traila at Mesa,11,Fresh delicious breakfast tacos and even Menudo on weekends. The sauces are good as well
La Traila at Mesa,12,Best taco spott around and it s in the neighborhood. Super fresh and pretty fast. Friendly people.  Gotta beat the morning crowd from Anderson H.S. across the street. It s my jam 
La Traila at Mesa,13,Very good migas  chorizo wasn t spiced enough for my taste. Prices were reasonable for good sized tacos.Be prepared for a long wait. They could use another umbrella for their 2nd picnic table.
La Traila at Mesa,14,Do you like breakfast tacos  You live in Austin  of course you like Breakfast Tacos.  Well then taco lover  you already know there are about a million choices in Austin when it comes to eggs wrapped in a tortilla.  You can go ahead and add one more option to that already expansive list.  La Trail  may not be the most exciting place  and it might not do anything really new or different  but damn it is pretty good.  They have all the standard egg   meat  or potato  if you re into that  tacos as well as a few big specialty tacos.  They also have this great spicy green salsa that is quite delicious. The tortillas are apparently all handmade as well  and that s pretty rad.    The cost is pretty good as well.  I pay roughly  1.50 for a eggs meat taco  and roughly  2.75 for a eggs meat taters avocado taco.   So  La Trail  is pretty great even if it s pretty unexciting.  If you happen to be driving down Mesa you should stop by and give it a shot.  Oh yeah  and they are cash only... so make sure you bring some green paper.
La Traila at Mesa,15,Their breakfast tacos are tasty and inexpensive  and the menu caters to the high school across the street  which is a nice touch. If you re hungry  go for the Anderson.
La Traila at Mesa,16,That egg and avocado taco is very very good but the Kearny Asada tacos taste like absolute crap meat is burned up black and throw a ton of onions on it that s about it it s supposed to have cilantro but you get like one little green speck so I advise you don t get anything with Kearny Asada it s burnt to a crisp
La Traila at Mesa,17,My go to taco place  And they have Horchata. The gringo and the Anderson  Their al pastor is yummy.
La Traila at Mesa,18,Really good breakfast tacos. The corn tortillas are fluffy and better than flour. Price is good  quantity good and flavor good. What more can you ask for.
La Traila at Mesa,19,The breakfast tacos here are legit  I came across this trailer thanks to other awesome Yelp reviews.  The pricing is fair and the tortillas salsas are great.  Bring cash.
La Traila at Mesa,20,This is my regular morning taco stop.  All the guys who do construction in the area stop by here  so that s a good sign.  Everything fresh  tortillas made by hand  they crack the eggs right as they put them on the stove.  My wife is a big fan of the veggie El Flako  but she adds bacon  go figure .  That s quite filling  as are the migas  which has refried beans  and the Anderson.  I have gone minimalistic these days and just get the bacon and eggs.  Cooked to perfection  not burned  and perfectly seasoned.  They are  1.75 apiece  and they now take credit cards  and two are just right for me.  I m not a huge fan of the hot sauce but I ll take the green if I don t have any at home.   You can get coffee and drinks at the Mini Mart  and there are a couple of tables outside.  The tacos are so good that we ate thru 2 or 3 each a couple of weeks ago  and I was sent out to get some more.  Now that s a mission I ll always accept 
La Traila at Mesa,21,Pro  Cheap Cons  Mild  flavorless salsas. Terrible flour tortillas that dissolve in response to the moisture of the fillings. I got a shrug and confusion when I asked for corn tortillas.
La Traila at Mesa,22,Oh my goodness. All I can say is wow. Great depth of flavor. We wanted to come to a taco truck and La Traila delivered. The pastor was bomb and the sauce  while spicy  was super delicious. We definitely will be coming back  as the prices are super reasonable  Thanks La Traila 
La Traila at Mesa,23,This place has great tacos. I have eaten here dozens of times since they first parked and have never been disappointed. The servings are generous and the cost is excellent. While my house was being remodeled I would get lunch for the crew from this place about three times a week. I have overlooked reviewing them simply because I began to view it as an extension of my kitchen. Stopped by today and thought it was time to give them props. Nice people  good chow  good price.
La Traila at Mesa,24,Made to order from scratch  Best breakfast taco place in the area  yes including torchys. I usually get the Anderson  bacon  potato  avocado and egg. Red and green salsas are both delicious. CASH ONLY
La Traila at Mesa,25,I found this place about a week ago on my way to work  and have been back twice for the lengua and barbacoa. While some have pointed out that Austin has a lot of good authentic breakfast tacos  completely true   that is absolutely not true of this part of Austin. So I am very appreciative of what these guys are doing  homemade corn tortillas and rich  intense salsa  without having to travel to Burnet or north Lamar. I also enjoyed the egg white  jalape o  and avocado taco  pretty sweet.
La Traila at Mesa,26,Great local place. Very affordable and great migas. Only been for breakfast tacos. Fantastic hot sauces and super friendly staff.
La Traila at Mesa,27,The tacos here are delicious. I always get the Anderson. The tortillas are perfect  and the quality is very consistent. The service is always fast. One thing to be aware of is that they only except cash  but they re right next to a convenience store  so you could get cash from there if you needed to. If you re looking for breakfast tacos in the neighborhood  I highly recommend this place.
La Traila at Mesa,28,Everything you want in a taco. I generally eat here once a week and I m NEVER disappointed. Service is quick  staff is friendly  and the food is AWESOME   Can t wait for tomorrow morning so I can get more Puerco Verde  Keep it up  y all 
La Traila at Mesa,29,I have come here twice for breakfast tacos  the tacos are cooked to order and they are decent sized portions. Both times I went  I did not have to wait very long at all. I wouldn t say this place is ranked with the top breakfast taco places in Austin  but I was satisfied during both visits
La Traila at Mesa,30,Excellent tacos  good meat  homemade tortillas   Didn t try the breakfast tacos  but the Al Pastor and Barbacoa were great   Said they get their food from the restaurant  Molcas  down the street - will try that next  although it has very mixed reviews..
La Traila at Mesa,31,Huevos  chorizo  queso tacos are divine. Their red sauce has got kick but not too much. Cheap cheap cheap on top of it makes this place a must stop for anyone that adores Authentic Street Mexican.
La Traila at Mesa,32,Great tacos  I always call before going so when I get there the food is ready. Cash only. My favorite is the Anderson and the Gorditas.
La Traila at Mesa,33,Overall a good place for tacos. I got two tacos and both were  1.75 each  with tax. The cashier was friendly and they tasted good for being breakfast tacos. There was a five minute wait  which wasn t a big deal. She also told me it d be five minutes  so it was all good. Unfortunately  stars were lost due to the explosive diarrhea I had an hour after eating there. Maybe it was due to the hot sauce or maybe it was something else. I wouldn t mind perhaps giving it another shot there in the future.
La Traila at Mesa,34,Love the tortillas  It s so hard to find homemade ones...even in Austin. But these tortillas are amazing  I love the ones at ZuZus too. Tried the breakfast tacos and the salsas to go with it were killer  They were also fast and cheap. Will definitely return.
La Traila at Mesa,35,Best breakfast tacos        Everything is made from scratch and tastes amazingly fresh.  Menu is simple  cash only  and takes only a few minutes to fill an order.  The owners are good  hard working  people and I m so happy they joined the neighborhood 
La Traila at Mesa,36,Tacos are a good size.  Not bad pricing and everything seems made to order.  Bring cash  that is all the accept.
La Traila at Mesa,37,I am sure glad I stopped by this location. The tacos are fantastic and the salsa is delicious. The staff is very friendly and the service was fast.
La Traila at Mesa,38,Salsas are top notch.  A lot of flavor  and a lot of kick.  Breakfast tacos are good - and this is one of the only places in Northwest Hills to get a decent breakfast taco early Saturday morning.
La Traila at Mesa,39,Located next to a local convenience store  and not far from Torchy s Tacos  you may give this trailer a miss. Don t. The breakfast tacos are excellent and from the comments of others all the items on the menu are good.
La Traila at Mesa,40,This is so far the best true Mexican taqueria stand I have ever had in Austin by far.  I have eaten at this place 4 times so far and the food were delicious each time   I love the la gordita Pastor.  My friend had the lengua and tripas tacos and said both were delicious as well.  She prefers the tripas more though.  Menu is simple and prices are very reasonable given the size of each item ordered.  2 tables available to sit on.  It is a food truck next to a convenient store.  I wish they have chicharon on the menu but I was told that it isn t popular so they took off.  Too bad.  I bet it would have been good.  Anyways   this place is a must try 
La Traila at Mesa,41,I love this place I go to this truck at least three times a week. I always bring tacos for my other fellow employees it s affordable and it s very quick. I drove by there 2 days ago and the truck is gone I was very sad does anyone know what happened to it  I m hoping they re just doing some repairs and it will be back.
La Traila at Mesa,42,Great tacos  Amazing tortillas and salsas   I had the LA Gringa  which was a mix between a quesadilla and a taco and it was amazing     and was really enough for have by just one prison by itself. .  Definitely 5 stars.  I also had the Puerco Verde taco  which was good  the shredded meat and green chile mixture has a soggy texture  not bad  but just a heads up  the sign does say stewed meat .   The taste was very good  4 stars.  I m already looking forward to my next trip to this awesome trailer 
La Traila at Mesa,43,We had heard great things about this taco truck but were disappointed after trying it. We ordered one Trojan burrito and 2 potato and egg tacos. The tacos were littered with egg shells and the potatoes in the burrito were very undercooked. The salsas pack a lot of heat but lack in flavor. The horchata was very good.
La Traila at Mesa,44,La Traila tacos are fast and delicious. One of my favorite places to get breakfast tacos 
La Traila at Mesa,45,Be forewarned  One breakfast taco is not enough.  Loved the  Anderson  with avocado at this food truck located across the street from Anderson High School.  They probably thought it was odd that an out-of-town business person stood in line with the teens  but Yelp never steers me wrong.
La Traila at Mesa,46,Tried this today. Despite having an overabundance of breakfast tacos in the area these are a cut above. Service was fast and friendly. Tacos were fresh and hot.
La Traila at Mesa,47,As we all know  when it comes to food trailers  Austin has a wide variety of choices and you ll find a lot of good places that serve real Mexican food and or delicious breakfast tacos   but  this is not one of them  I was not impressed with the service or the food.
Donut Taco Palace,1,This place is great   I cannot believe how good their donuts are   And my friend got 3 different types of tacos  and he thought all of them were absolutely delicious   I personally like the different variety of donuts they have as well...they were all good   It was busy when we went  but they were fast.  I may have to make a little commute to return as I live in north Austin...but it will be worth it 
Donut Taco Palace,2,Oh my gosh I thought this place was fabulous  if I ever need to get donuts again I m definitely going to come here. Super affordable. They have a great variety. They also sell kolache s and tacos. 10 10
Donut Taco Palace,3,I never knew I wanted a breakfast taco and a donut combo before now  I ordered a dozen glazed donuts and a couple of migas tacos  Everything was super fresh and tasty  I love both separately but now have a whole new appreciation for the combo. Can t wait to try out their other items 
Donut Taco Palace,4,The people working at the shop were so kind even when we came near closing. They gave us DONUT TACOS and it turned out to be amazinggggg. Great vibes and really nice local business.
Donut Taco Palace,5,I ve never had donut tacos  we all loved it  The staff is super friendly. Highly recommend.
Donut Taco Palace,6,For just  2 each you can custom order your own set of donuts for any occasion at Donut Taco Palace   They re also known for their signature Rock  amp  Roll donut which for legal purposes isn t a  hook em . Uh huh.     I placed my order in advance and damn these were beautiful AND delicious  I smiled as soon as I saw them  they were done so well   You can pick what type of donuts  color  toppings  etc. so this really makes for a great way to celebrate   Highly satisfied. 5 5 for sure 
Donut Taco Palace,7,This place is amazing  They have tacos and donuts and even donut tacos  Donut tacos are actually a thing  and they are amazing. It s a taco with a donut in place of the tortilla  And they a huge. And taste great. The donuts are very good too. And even better than the donut taco  if that s even possible  is the super nice staff. Highly recommend this place.
Donut Taco Palace,8,Average tacos and breakfast foods  but they have great customer service and are always quick even when there s a line.   
Donut Taco Palace,9,Donuts  amp  tacos all in one place   Yes plz  The menu is huge and affordable. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was.  We got 7 different tacos. I appreciate them labeling each one. My favorites were their breakfast Chorizo   the lunch Barbacoa. Their salsas are so good with just enough spice. By default  they use a flour tortilla but you can replace it with corn for just 25 .   We also tried the Strawberry   Cream Cheese Kolache  Blueberry Glazed  Maple   Coconut  Lemon Filled   the Apple Fritter. They re not gourmet but they sure are flavorful   My bf   I are so glad we discovered this place. It s def gonna be our regular go-to for brunch   
Donut Taco Palace,10,Bury me at Donut Tacos Palace with a few of their donuts and breakfast tacos please. For real.   Like others have said  this place has a no-frills vibe. Always people coming in and going out  and lots of cops stopping in to grab their stereotypical morning donut.  The donuts aren t the best donuts that you ll ever have in your life  but they re pretty darn good and perfect to brighten up a bleh Monday morning. Their breakfast tacos are super YUM and they have literally brought me BACK TO LIFE the morning after a long night out.  Staff has never been anything but kind to me  but they are often very busy. Great selection of drinks to accompany your donut taco kolache and prices are very reasonable.  All I m saying is that if you re looking for a local  neighborhood donut spot that is going to give you good vibes and good donuts and tacos  this place is IT. Give it a try 
Donut Taco Palace,11,We stopped by here in August during covid and had a good experience. Everyone was masked appropriately and there is a limit on the number of people inside. I see a lot of comments on here about service but that was not an issue for us. The whole idea of the place is fast and cheap so... yeah.   Come early as donut variety will dwindle. We had a variety of donuts  kolaches and breakfast tacos and were pleased with everything. Every item was generally under  1.50. Stop by for a quick  cheap breakfast.
Donut Taco Palace,12,I paid over  7 for 2 overcooked burnt cold Kolaches.  They went down hill in quality and prices went way up.
Donut Taco Palace,13,I feel like Stefon from Saturday night live describing this great little place. It has all of the usual suspects there  donuts  kolache s  breakfast tacos and just about anything you might want to wash them down with. I like the fact that they have custom made donuts for example you can get a thumbs up or a hook them horns donut that s right plenty of variety. Grab a couple of dozen donuts on your way to the office and and watch the smiles happen.
Donut Taco Palace,14,My favorite glazed donut I ve ever eaten     And they re so cheap I love them so much  
Donut Taco Palace,15,Pretyy good but not great their donut shapes seem cool but over priced as heck not something id come back for
Donut Taco Palace,16,The staff is lovely  The sheer number of online orders waiting to be picked up shows they are organized and well liked. I got kolaches  a breakfast taco  and donut holes. Enjoyed the donuts and breakfast taco did the trick. Will be returning   
Donut Taco Palace,17,We ordered on door dash and everything was great  The tacos were basic but good. I loved the large cheese and sausage kolache. The. Blueberry kolache wasn t my thing but I ll order strawberry next time. The Belgian donut holes were amazing and I ll definitely get again
Donut Taco Palace,18,If you order online you might want to call before you go pick it up. 2nd time in a month I ordered online and when I got there to pick it up they didn t have what I ordered. It would have been nice if they called me and told me before I got there.
Donut Taco Palace,19,After getting home  I noticed that I was shorted a taco in my order. Since I  live close to the business  I went back to get my taco. The lady that waited on me didn t apologize or offer to do anything for my inconvenience. Obviously she was aware of the issue because she went to the back area and got the taco that was already bagged. The customer service needs to addressed. I ll never go back to that business and strongly suggest anyone looking for breakfast tacos might want to look at another place.
Donut Taco Palace,20,Not sure why the ratings are so low but this place is a really no frills gem  The donuts and dough are high quality  strawberry donut had actual strawberry in it   the kolaches were also really good and the croissant sausage roll was enjoyable. Can t wait to come back and try way more stuff
Donut Taco Palace,21,Worst donuts and customer service I ve experienced in a long time  I tried quite a few donuts they were cold from the case not even a little bit warm and the dough wasn t all that good. The one I was most disappointed in was the cereal donut  the cereal was half soggy and half stale. I only ate a few bites and threw most of them away in fact. I thought it would get better but it didn t. The breakfast biscuit however was rather tasty   I would go back for that but I wouldn t make a special trip for it. Now for the customer service  the lady didn t know what that was  because after every item I chose  instead of asking  can I get you anything else  she asked that s all right   Like she was put out that I wanted to order anything more than one item. The search for a good donut shop continues
Donut Taco Palace,22,The donuts are not that good. I ordered a cinnamon roll and it wasn t that tasty. I ordered an Apple fritter and that was decent. I ordered a strawberry filled donut and it barely had any filling was just a plain donut. I ordered the sausage kolach and the sausage was super tiny. I ordered the fajita and that was ok  a little plain. I believe they could do better if they put effort into their business.
Donut Taco Palace,23,Their breakfast tacos are consistently delicious  Donuts are also very good with one exception  anytime I get something with the chocolate icing it tastes rancid at first then it builds up to this awful chemical taste. Totally understandable that there are off days but today was the third time I tried an item with the chocolate icing and it always has that awful taste. So maybe avoid the chocolate icing and choose maple instead.
Donut Taco Palace,24,Just got a dozen donuts.  And I was blown away. I never thought they have good donuts but either they changed or I didn t actually try them.  Probably because I got their other yummy food. But it s a perfect donut. Not too sweet but with sweet toppings and such. Try some donuts here and not just the other savory items.
Donut Taco Palace,25,I ve purchased donuts from this place for the past 3 days in a row  They are beautiful and oh so tasty  My favorite are the chocolate frosting filled 
Donut Taco Palace,26,Terrible service... I went in this morning to get one taco  I waited about 5 mins  paid  got my taco then proceeded to leave... then the RUDE manager chased after me asking if I paid and was really close to me and my car... I told her I did she said her employees said I did not... I then showed her my bank statement and another employee came running out to tell her I did pay..  They really need to get it together.. treating me like I stole a  2 taco   I told the manager I would not be returning and she rudely said  fine by me    They need some serious attitude adjustments   My friend went the other day and when he paid they asked him why he did not tip .. like so rude
Donut Taco Palace,27,Good breakfast tacos and donuts  friendly staff  Great that they have online ordering - unfortunately  after about 10 30a it s a bit of crap shoot if they ll have what you ordered.
Donut Taco Palace,28,Was hoping to have a good experience like I did at the Round Rock one off of 620 however the young lady that took my order seem to be upset that she wasn t able to continue playing the video game or scrolling through social media on her phone.   I ordered a taco a croissant and an apple fritter I asked the lady if she had red or green sauce and she simply just pointed to the bag at the taco is it and she didn t say any words and I said is there a red or green sauce and then she just handed me the bag forcefully and then give me my change and I left very rude  I will not be coming back to this location not even if it s the last thing on earth to eat I would rather eat the grass that grows outside into deal with this attitude
Donut Taco Palace,29,This is my new favorite taco place  I went on a Saturday afternoon  and all of the ready-made tacos were gone  so the kitchen was doing made to order tacos which took a little longer but was definitely worth it    I ordered a bean and cheese taco Mexican style  with eggs  peppers  tomatoes  and onions   and a chocolate cake donut. The taco was super warm and had a great amount of melted cheese on it which is obviously very important. The donut was delicious  although pretty small. The entire order cost maybe  5  so it is definitely worth the money   Service is extremely fast  sometimes too fast. They got my order wrong one time because they were moving too quickly  but it is still nice that there is very little wait time.   I stopped by on a weekday morning and ordered a ready-made taco which wasn t as good  but still pretty darn delicious. I recommend going a little later in the day to get the made to order tacos if you can. They are a great bang for your buck 
Donut Taco Palace,30,With all the things going on in the world  how is it that I could ever find the time to talk about Donut Tacos Palace  Let s just put it this way  if the future of humanity depended on a glazed donut  this would be the sanctuary you re looking for. Forget about the other guys. The best glazed donuts ever period. God bless.
Donut Taco Palace,31,Yup  They re officially amazing. I was able to correspond via email to order special donuts for my daughters birthday. They also delivered them early before she woke up for a small fee. Thank you for the super yummy treats and helping make her day special.
Donut Taco Palace,32,If you just want something cheap  amp  sweet this might do the trick however I would consider myself somewhat of a donut snob  amp  it just wasn t worth the calories for me. Donuts were soft  amp  fresh  but just not good. Tasted like the oil was old or something  amp  the raised donuts were really greasy. The thing we went for was the hand sign donuts but at 10 30am when we got there they were already out of them.   
Donut Taco Palace,33,So good  We were visiting from out of town  and saw this place online. Just had to try it out.  The name itself sold us.  We walked in and were surprised  The place had a cool feel to it  and was rather popular by how many people were stopping in.  They were moving along pretty quickly and getting people their orders at a fast pace.  The food tasted amazing. We had the tacos - and would have them again   Will definitely go back the next time in Austin.
Donut Taco Palace,34,This was an interesting stop on my food journey. We were staying just down the road at the Marriott residence Inn and drove by the Doughnut Taco Palace and just had to stop in. We were there at about noon and many of the premade tacos were gone but I was still able to get chorizo and eggs and it was excellent  My daughter  the vegetarian  wanted something vegetarian and they made it for her custom. She loved it as well. Of course we had to try the doughnuts and I had an apple fritter and she had a glazed doughnut with sprinkles and they were very good. It s a very interesting concept and it was very busy with people eating in and coming and going with takeout orders. I did not try the coffee so I cannot comment on that but a shop like this has to have good coffee to go with the breakfast foods  I would think.
Donut Taco Palace,35,I worked a few minutes away before COVID and I have been coming here for many years. Although it is out of my way now  I get the craving for their tacos. Unfortunately for me  getting my order correct has become impossible. The last couple of times my tacos were incorrect. Each time I ordered egg  amp  potato and picadillo with potato. They insist on adding cheese when I specifically DO NOT order cheese. And although the receipt will clearly say  picadillo add potato   potato is not in the taco. When I call to inform them the order is not correct  they argue and say that is what I ordered. All 3 times  I was basically called a liar. Guess I have learned my lesson the hard way about the customer service here.
Donut Taco Palace,36,Can t say enough wonderful things about this place. The donuts are incredible  their chorizo and egg taco is likely my favorite breakfast taco in Austin  and they are so kind
Donut Taco Palace,37,They got my order wrong and I didn t open the tacos until I got home obviously. They had gotten my order wrong before and told me it was too busy to resolve at that time. I called later in the day based off that experience and they told me it was too late to resolve and I needed an order number. Ridiculous  They don t even give you a receipt so impossible to have an order number. I don t want to support a business that refuses to correct their mistakes.
Donut Taco Palace,38,They have gotten busier and with it comes a bit of attitude and inconsistency. When I first tried the Mexican Style Tacos  which is what they were known for   I was impressed and recommended to quite a few friends and coworkers who lived in the area. Next time  we wanted the same tacos that we had from which we were impressed by. We described it  asked for it  and tried to confirm if we were getting the right one by asking   They are vegetarian right   The response we got over the phone  and in person three times was a  They are Mexican Style  with a side of attitude. We can t see the inside of the tacos  nor the case  nor the tacos explicit description  so how can we bypass talking to someone...  We don t know what Mexican style was so we asked  Okay  so it s vegetables like bell peppers and cilantro right   -  They are Mexican Style . Hot tempered  I couldn t handle the attitude any longer so I called her out on the attitude in front of the line  paid and left. She  at least  seemed nervous and ushered to the side to payout other customers. The Asian owners were in the background talking gossip without any action to the situation. Turns out  the tacos didn t have too much bell peppers or jalapenos as it did before.  To the Owners  congratulations for receiving business but the ego there is unbelievable and unacceptable. As you can see from the multiple similar negative reviews here on just your attitudes alone  you re not going to be respected as a even individual persons if you do not respect your customers. I will not return  and will not recommend. I ll go where my money is appreciated.
Donut Taco Palace,39,I love this place and go multiple times a week for breakfast tacos. They stay busy and I m happy they ve found a way to stay open and safe during COVID. Their tacos and donuts are cheap and AMAZING. I just wish there was one closer to me 
Donut Taco Palace,40,I don t understand the bad reviews  I love DTP 1. The donuts are always great and it s so cheap  I would even pay more for their donuts and donut holes. The workers are always super nice and fast and it s just a great experience every time. The line moves quick and you just have to put in the work to get up early enough  or stay up late enough  to get the good stuff. Donuts are amazing and service is great. 5 stars easily
Donut Taco Palace,41,Best Taco and doughnut place in Austin. The green salsa is the best. Definitely get here early because they will sell out. Will always recommend to friends 
Donut Taco Palace,42,So this place has always been halfway between great donuts and maybe not so great service. They re nice  but stressed and want you to hurry the eff up  Again  great donuts and tacos.  Went there today 6 13 for the first time since COVID lockdown. They checked all the boxes for signage  recommending masks  having people respect social distancing common sense...EXCEPT THE STAFF.   One of the three front counter people wore a mask. The lady coming out of the back to restock had no gloves or a mask. WTF. They didn t actually require customers to wear masks.   I love this place  but they re not ready for the Pandemic  definitely won t be going back any time soon.
Donut Taco Palace,43,This has been one of my favorite places to stop for tacos since I was a kid. Lately it kinda sucks to BBEdit honest. If you get fresh tacos out of the back they are amazing. If you get the ready made ones  not good. The tortillas are soft and soggy. If you know anything  about breakfast tacos  it s all about the tortilla  Also one of smaller ladies who works there is very unfriendly. Always rude to me. Asked for fresh tortilla and she laughs at me and said they are al fresh. Wouldn t you know my tortilla was soggy again. I would love to keep going here but it s getting tough...
Donut Taco Palace,44,CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS  I ordered a biscuit sandwich which was tasty but the chick that works the counter likes to overcharge you so be sure to check your receipt.   She told me one price and then I signed my receipt and I noticed she had tacked on an additional 70 cents.  Not cool.    I m a great tipper so not sure why she would be dishonest.   If you need to sell your sandwiches for more money then increase your price.    Don t just sneak it in because you think no ones looking.  This was the second time this happened to me there so I don t think it was a mistake  . Check your receipts   Dishonest and very unethical business practice.
Donut Taco Palace,45,You can try to find a better breakfast spot for tacos and donuts  but you won t find one. This place is too good 
Donut Taco Palace,46,My husband and daughters love the option of getting taco  kolache and donuts but some rude people working there.  I rarely would take them because of that reason  and I seem to get the same person because my daughter said it is usually the same rude person and the others are nice.  Food wise  they love it.  It is alright to me  nothing outstanding about it.  Can easily be found anywhere else.  But maybe their terrible service just left a bad taste.
Donut Taco Palace,47,I m visiting from CA and was craving Kolaches  we don t get those in Cali  so did a door dash order. The  7 delivery fee  was pretty high which  then today on top of that I  was charged an additional  2.50 on top of that for a small order fee  what a rip off  I paid for sausage and cheese kolaches and got plain sausage yesterday. And they were cold. The breakfast tacos were pretty good. I chalked up the cold kolaches to ordering later in the morning. Today I put in a second order and paid the expensive delivery fees to get my kolaches fix in before leaving town. I ordered for an earlier delivery time. Kolaches were cold again. Won t be ordering those again. Donut holes were decent. I ordered 2 egg and cheese tacos with added chorizo and potatoes. Got one how I ordered and one just egg and cheese. Grrrrrr. If you order for delivery expect to get shorted for things you paid extra for and no refund. I hope they don t do that on every order  that would be a pretty nice profit. Not expecting the  0.50 credit in both orders but won t be coming back here when I visit nor do I recommend them to friends or family.
Donut Taco Palace,48,My friend and I stopped here on a weekend morning and the line was insane and out into the parking lot. We skipped but ended up going back during the weekday.  We went inside and I picked out a few donuts and was still deciding what else I wanted. The lady helping me went to go pick up the phone and never came back to me to finish my order or even to ring me up. She didn t even excuse herself or say she would be right back. Once my friend was done ordering  the lady helping her eventually rung me up  while the other lady was still on the phone with a line forming behind us.  We grabbed our items and as we were walking out  I noticed one of their drink coolers was opened  so I decided I would help them out and close it for them. No need to waste energy.  As we were getting settled in our car  the lady  WHILE STILL ON THE PHONE  came out and tapped on our window. I thought we may have left something behind. She had the nerve to say  Did you steal a milk   while looking around in my car to make sure I didn t take anything. I was shocked and upset that I was being accused of stealing  let alone stealing a  2 milk. I told her   No  I closed the door because it was open.  She just said   Oh  okay  and left.  She didn t have time to help me finish my order  but she did have time to come outside and accuse me of stealing. I was just trying to do something nice but obviously they would rather you not care. The customer service is bad here and I won t be back.
Donut Taco Palace,49,I d give the name of the place 5-stars. Donuts and tacos are probably my two favorite foods  and calling the place a  Palace  is marketing genius. The donuts are pretty good  and they ve got an impressive variety of different flavors  shapes  and colors. It s really fun to go there and just stare at all the cool things they have at the counter before things start selling out. This is also a great place to grab donuts for the office because it s cheap with lots of options.The tacos are nothing special  and at times  they re pretty rubbery and unappetizing  but I m not sure you can really expect too much when you re paying a little over  1 for a breakfast taco. I have yet to try the infamous donut taco because heart disease and diabetes run in my family  and I m not ready to die quite yet...  It s a great place to get cheap and tasty eats. Nothing will blow you away  but it s an ideal corner donut and taco shop to get a quick and unhealthy breakfast or snack.
Donut Taco Palace,50,Breakfast Tacos  As a south Texas native  it was refreshing to find cheap  delicious tacos that did not have any gimmicks or a high price tag attached to it. I ordered the chorizo and egg taco and it was piping hot and not at all the extremely greasy drip fest that I ve seen other places do.   Donuts  I chose to eat a regular glazed donut that had a custard filling  Sorry if it has an official name  I simply pointed at it and paid for it  the donut definitely satisfied my sweet tooth craving. My only wish is that there was more filling.   Overall a great place to run in out of when picking up breakfast  Just keep in mind that if you plan to pay with a credit card  they will charge an additional  0.30 to your card if you don t buy  5 worth of goodies.
Donut Taco Palace,51,Got two potato  egg  amp  cheese tacos this morning. Bit into the first one and crunched on a HUGE piece of egg shell right away. Threw out that taco and then wishfully thinking it was an isolated incident  began to eat the 2nd. Again  found myself with a mouth full of egg shell. I am so grossed out. Will never eat there again.
Donut Taco Palace,52,  Review based only on breakfast tacos    Love coming here for a nice  cheap breakfast taco  You order at the counter  they grab one for you and warm it up. I usually get bean  amp  cheese  sometimes potato and bacon if I m feeling feisty that day. The other options are solid though. The real winner is their spicy salsa  SO GOOD. Sometimes I use two salsas for one breakfast taco... It has a great kick to it  and it s super flavorful. Gotta try it    My boyfriend has gotten the doughnut sandwich before - cinnamon roll basically with sausage  egg  and cheese  I think  not too sure of the contents . He likes it though    Bottom line  breakfast tacos are awesome  salsa is a must-have.
Donut Taco Palace,53,Pretty good donuts- they are large and unique looking.   The day I stopped in the stream of people coming in was pretty steady.   Not a huge complaint  but I struggled with the food labeling  it was not very clear what each item was   but I also had two individuals who stood in front of the case talking while I was trying to look.  I  followed suit and ordered what the person before me ordered  a ham and cheese  I said croissant but I think it was a kolache  and an apple fritter to go.   The bread on the H C C was very fresh and delicious  not much cheese in it but overall tasty.   The apple fritter was fried with just the right amount of crispiness-  and it was so rich I ate half and saved the other half for later.   Service was quick and I would definitely try them again.
Donut Taco Palace,54,Pretty good doughnuts. Good prices on a dozen doughnut holes. Have a great deal between 12 30-1  buy one get one free. But they run out sometimes  so don t count on it.
Donut Taco Palace,55,Mother of god.  TACOS.  DONUTS.    I have found heaven  and it is in a strip mall in Austin  TX.  Let me go back 
Donut Taco Palace,56,The donuts taste like it came from Walmart bakery. Rough texture  dense  and just a bad taste all around. Not to mention the price is almost double what it cost in other donut shops. Save your money and make the trip somewhere else.
Donut Taco Palace,57,The sausage croissant here was not freshly made and served cold. Got my daughter sick after eating she had a severe stomach pain that didn t allow her to sleep and we were rushed to the ER at the Dells Children Hospital.  Horrible experience Wouldn t recommend it to no one.
Donut Taco Palace,58,I stop by way more often than I ought to  but how can one resist doughnuts and breakfast tacos in one place  
Donut Taco Palace,59,I have to admit  this place was my first kolache of Austin.  The kolaches are pretty standard.  I prefer the sausage  cheese  jalapeno kolaches.  I could use a little more spice  but it s still decent.  The main thing I like about these guys is that they offer small and large kolaches.  The large is a slightly different dough or at least comes off as different because of the way it s cooked.  The donuts are ok...  just ok  a little dry although flavor is decent.  If you are looking for a way to eat 3 donuts at a time and not feel guilty  just order a twisted donut.
Donut Taco Palace,60,Came by here on suggestion from boss since visiting home tacos were ok donuts good got a maple bacon donut and fruity pebbles donut. .m
Donut Taco Palace,61,I love their kolaches  The cream filled donut holes  and bacon  egg and cheese breakfast tacos are also favorites  There is always a line  but it s worth the wait.
Donut Taco Palace,62,1.  Completely rushed to order - the line is configured so you can t see the case until you are first in line  but then you are completely rushed to place an order 2.  Kolaches - completely inauthentic kolaches and the ones with sausage or ham have hardly any filling 3.  Employees - there is no comprehension of customer service here.  No please or thank you.  The employees are hard to understand and it seems they don t have a good grasp of English or just don t care because they are so busy. 4.  The Donuts and Tacos are just OK  nothing special.
Donut Taco Palace,63,Donut Taco Palace  I have failed you. I ve driven past you for over a year without stopping in to give you a try. I wanted to - and I kept telling myself  this weekend  is  the weekend  to try Donut Taco Palace...and yet something always came up. Well  this past weekend I finally made the stop and now I m afraid I won t be able to stop coming in. I don t even know where to start. But the donuts seems like a good way-  1. Donuts As a recovering donut addict  I can attest that these donuts are simply divine. The dough is flaky  fresh and the perfect amount of sugar. Light  fluffy and straight from the oven goodness. AND the variety  I wanted one of everything  but seeming as how that would be silly  I had to narrow my choices. I went with a dozen cream filled donut holes. PS  you had me at those donut taco palace. You had me at the first bite of one cream filled donut hole. Next  I tried one of the Longhorns  basic glazed  in the shape of the Hook  em sign  and then I had a nice cinnamon cake donut. Nothing disappointed. I ve made a mental note of what I m trying this weekend - the list is long and glorious.  2. Tacos I ll admit I was hesitant. Can an establishment truly do good donuts AND tacos  I wasn t sure it could be done. But  indeed it can. I had a bacon  egg and cheese taco on flour tortilla. It was superb. Fluffy  fresh eggs with crisp bacon and melted cheesy goodness. Smattered with a splash of fresh salsa - it was the perfect addition to an already perfect breakfast.  3. Service The staff was excellent - friendly  patient  too many choices   and fast.  There s also a huge selection of kolaches  breakfast sandwiches  pastries  drinks and coffee. Do yourself a favor and stop by 
Donut Taco Palace,64,It s too bad because I really enjoyed the food from this place  but they need to understand their behavior is not acceptable. I went a few weeks ago for the first time since Covid began and everything was great. Good social distancing cues  they had the door propped open for air circulation  and the staff were all wearing masks. I went again yesterday  May 24  and none of the staff were wearing masks. This is pretty reprehensible for anyone  frankly  but even more so for a food establishment. Poor job by you Donut Taco Palace...I won t be back after many years of visits.
Donut Taco Palace,65,My daughter stopped by on the way to work for some donut  amp  kolaches and it was really good  amp  fresh. I like how clean it is in here  amp  very nice customer service. I will never by any donuts from elsewhere but here   
Donut Taco Palace,66,I absolutely love this place. I ve learned to get here early because my favorite items tend to go fast. The line can be long at times but they move quickly. I always take it to go because the seating area is kind of small  but I definitely recommend to anyone who wants to give them a try 
Donut Taco Palace,67,This place is my favorite for all things breakfast. And the best donuts I ve had. The customer service here is also super great too and they go far and beyond anytime I have a big order to pick up. Love love love the employees and the food.
Donut Taco Palace,68,Donuts AND tacos  Sounds great to me. Tastes great as well. Donut Tacos Palace did not disappoint. Very affordable  especially when breakfast tacos in Austin can reach  4 a taco at some places. After a night on the town  this was exactly what we needed.
Donut Taco Palace,69,After a brutal morning in the world  I needed comfort food. I stopped in for an apple fritter and a cinnamon roll. The store was busy in late morning  which I took as a good sign. The people were nice and the donuts really good. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Flavor was great. Thank you 
Donut Taco Palace,70,If you need tacos  donuts  or kolaches  and this place is convenient to you  check it out. Quaint little hole in the wall with a variety of donuts  kolaches  and tacos. Cute atmosphere and clientele. I wouldn t go out of my way to dine here but I m very glad I stopped here today to check out the palace.
Donut Taco Palace,71,IDIOT stupid knucklehead doh moron numb nuts..........ME for not stopping here sooner. Like other reviewers I was leery of the place because of the name. I was in a bind and needed breakfast  they put the FAST is breakfast  tacos AND doughnuts for a morning meeting. I knew I was in the right place when I observed Hispanic workmen standing in line in front of the counter. I rather enjoy the HOT sauce  chile  because it s guess what  rather HOT             The food is delicious   fresh and there is a variety of pastries to choose from. So don t be a pendejo dope stupid ignorant stubborn burned out loser like me and stop by this place. 2 STUFFED tacos and a doughnut for less than  3 bucks.............get outta here   P.S.  Note picture in the middle for the  hookem  pastries......I m wondering if they could make them with one finger in mind so I can give them to my OU friends. I ll check and let you know 
Donut Taco Palace,72,This is still by far my favorite place for Donuts Tacos and Kolaches in Austin. The owner is especially kind and always makes you feel like you are her only customer.
Donut Taco Palace,73,These guys are great for weekend donuts snd tacos  We always go on Saturday morning  we love Mexican breakfast taco 
Donut Taco Palace,74,I really enjoy finding placed like this throughout Austin. Supporting the local businesses around town is what keeps Austin a thriving city and this place is a gem. Of course Yelp makes it easy for anyone and everyone to have an opinion. SO here is mine  I think this place is great  they have quality product  on time  5-6am full display case ready for customers  friendly staff and great selection of donuts. Maybe I caught them on a good day  Maybe  but ill definitely be back because of it.
Donut Taco Palace,75,The perfect combination of good breakfast tacos and a massive selection of fresh donuts.  Not to mention the kick butt business name.  My kids love picking out their donuts and donut holes  and the old man and I love getting their breakfast tacos which are cheap  tasty  and generously sized.  This place does a brisk business on weekend mornings  which is when we go.  The service is efficient and any line moves quickly.  Check it out if you need breakfast in this part of town.  I tried the mysterious  Donut Taco  once  but it was too greasy and too huge for me to finish.  So I d stick with the donuts and tacos themselves and not the namesake.  The hook  em horns tacos are too cute and tasty too.  4 stars  I m a real fan.
Donut Taco Palace,76,Place was eh. The chorizo and egg taco hurt my stomach. The tortilla was thin and  flimsy and melted when you bit into the taco. The bacon and egg was okay but my stomach already hurt from the first taco. My husband said the spinach and cheese kolache was good
Donut Taco Palace,77,Frequented this establishment often until today. I was purchasing some milks for my girls  and noticed the lady  owner  was charging more than the displayed price. I inquired  and she said the reason was because the milks I was taking were very expensive and people like them...also because they didn t have it on the register...Instead of honoring the display price. She proceeded to charge me the more expensive price instead of what was listed on the cooler. There was a loooong line behind me and a 7 year old and two-2 year olds outside the store waiting for the drinks I had promised  so opted not to argue the price. Now I wonder if This is a routine practice...do they just charge whatever they want regardless of the prices they display  Check your receipts people  Will no longer patronize this shop.
Donut Taco Palace,78,Delicious bacon and egg  amp  beach and cheese tacos. I also tried the plain and bacon chocolate donuts very tasty. Very inexpensive 
Donut Taco Palace,79,I ordered a spinach croissant did not like. I ask the employee if he could swap out. He didnt even pay mind attention to my issue. Instead i ordered a kolache still charge me for it. Bad customer service 
Donut Taco Palace,80,Service has seriously gone downhill. Several of the employees were just chilling on their phones while customers were present and ordering. They refused to make any tacos that weren t already prepared  even though their kitchen was still open it was supposed to close at 12 45  leaving just bean and cheese and sausage and egg as options  and being quite snappy about it. They had very apathetic and unfriendly service  and honestly didn t seem to have any effort towards creating a friendly or professional environment. I m pretty disappointed  and won t be coming back anytime soon. All I can say is their donut holes were decent.
Donut Taco Palace,81,What a surprise   We first decided to go here because we had a chuckle with the name and the food combination.  After we tasted the food we we very happy about our choice. Great portion size and a large selection of items.  The taco were mighty tasty.  If your thinking about it don t hesitate GO 
Donut Taco Palace,82,I have been going here for the past year or so on a weekly bases. The staff and Angel  owner  make the experience fun and friendly  and the process of ordering is quick and easy too.  The donuts are pretty tasty but the Bacon  Cheese  amp  Egg Tacos take it to a Whole.. Nother.. Level. Amazing  In my opinion  of rating ALL the donut taco places in town   this is definitely the  1 spot in all of Austin 
Donut Taco Palace,83,Great service and the best old school breakfast tacos in town   They also have s lot of different donuts and breakfast sandwiches that are fantastic  
Donut Taco Palace,84,Both things I love in one place.  The breakfast sandwich on a Donut....heart attack good.
Donut Taco Palace,85,WOAH    I didn t realize that this place was here. They open at 5am to 1pm so get there early. It s a very tiny spot that doesn t call a lot of attention to themselves...so I ll do it for them hehe.  Everything is made fresh daily  from the croissants to the kolaches to the tacos and yes  the donuts. Whatever you like they have  and for those long horn fans  HOOK EM  they even make the hook em hand sign as a donut    That s awesome.   The kolache we had was a jalapeno cheese and it was delicious. Not too spicy. The chorizo potatoes taco was surprisingly yummy. I had yet to find a place to say  they have good chorizo tacos  until now. They stuff the tacos pretty generously and the tortillas are not cooked in the microwave which is awesome  they cook them on the stove or in Spanish  comal  as it s known to us Latinos.   The salsa has good flavor to it as well so grab a few of those. Needless to say  if your gonna be late to work or anywhere  since they open at 5am you can save the day and by tacos and donuts  best of both worlds    As always  PEACE AND GOOD EATING.
Donut Taco Palace,86,I love this place so freaking much. The price is amazing  the quality  Amazing. Tacos are warm and donuts are fresh. A hidden gem   
Donut Taco Palace,87,Great stuff all around. Breakfast tacos are the bomb  doughnuts are awesome too   Usually a long line on the weekends but moved fairly quickly .  Oh but.....  DO NOT ORDER THE DONUT TACO     If you are a fat  sweaty grotesque pig of a human being then by all means  dig into this unholy mass of failure and regret  just don t say i didn t warn you.   Other than that  all of the human food is fantastic and reasonably priced. Yum 
Donut Taco Palace,88,I went back to Donut Taco Palace today and I wasn t as impressed as the last time I visited. Maybe the sparkling appeal of donuts and tacos combined into one establishment simply wore off for me. Or maybe it was the fruity pebbles donut that had the consistency of a donut that had been sitting out for 4 hours. It also could have been the somewhat bland sausage in the sausage egg and cheese taco. Regardless  there was one fantastic item that came from Donut Taco Palace this morning  and it was the Jalape o Sausage and Cheese Kolache. Now  I ve had quite a few kolaches in my day  but this one  might have been one of the best. The breading was so fluffy and the top was perfectly golden. If I venture back to Donut Taco Palace  it ll definitely be for the kolaches. The chocolate sprinkle donut and the chorizo egg and cheese taco were also pretty palatable  but the kolache was the breakfast winner today.
Donut Taco Palace,89,I live in the neighborhood and have to give these guys 5 stars. DTP is an awesome  no frills shop that is everything you want out of great and inexpensive donuts and tacos. Awesome and friendly staff.
Donut Taco Palace,90,The food was undercooked and the potatoes in my taco was rotten...and something is also wrong with the donut   
Donut Taco Palace,91,I tried this place because it was close to my home after moving back to austin and I was amazed it was so delicious  The donuts are incredible. They have some really fun choices but the traditional glazed just can t be out done. Most of the time I stick to their breakfast tacos and if they don t have my favorite left  they ve always been nice enough to make me one.   The shop is in a strip and doesn t look like much from the outside  but that usually goes unnoticed by the line that often stacks up outside the door. I get up early on the weekends just to get there while everything is hot and fresh 
Donut Taco Palace,92,  Breakfast Taco Review   Amazing breakfast tacos and very reasonably priced  We ate 1 chorizo egg bean  1 sausage egg  1 migas  and 1 Mexican taco and all were delicious while staying under  2 each. My boyfriend and I are from out of town and unfortunately got roped into paying  4  for breakfast tacos during our stay in Austin and nothing compared to these tacos. I accidentally came across this place on our way out of town and I m so sad we won t be able to come back 
Donut Taco Palace,93,We ve come here at least five times and every time the ladies behind the counter are so rude. The food is good  but not that good to endure their rudeness. Based on their food  they score 4 stars. I might have to drive a bit farther to another donut place that isn t rude at all.
Donut Taco Palace,94,How did I miss this before     After driving by this place for the last 10 or so years  I finally stopped in for a donut last week.  Now  I like my donuts  but really only the cakey kind  and I can say that these are hands down the best cake donuts I ve had in Austin.  Darn tasty.    I ve since returned twice and gotten sausage croissants  a few breakfast tacos and more cake donuts.  The staff nukes the croissants and other savory baked goods to warm them up  which effectively destroys the deliciousness of a croissant.  I recommend asking for those at shelf temp.  The donuts seemed to not be an anomaly  they were damn good each time  but not quite Whole Donut in Wichita KS good .  As for the tacos.....in all that is holy  try the machacado taco.  My first thought after seeing the taco was  this is sooooo not machacado  shredded dried beef with eggs .  But then I tasted it  and didn t care anymore.  This is one hell of a taco.  Peppery  spicy with big hunks of beefy steaky goodness.  The beef pieces are like hunks of skirt steak or something  and not at all dried like machacado normally is.  It s spicy enough that it didn t even need the salsa  which is pretty decent .
Donut Taco Palace,95,Decent donuts  don t get me wrong. But it seems they only make one batch a day. If you aren t there by about 8 or 9 they will be out of the really good stuff. That s why I love shipleys donuts  always have everything 
Donut Taco Palace,96,Holy crap - this woman won t stop with the emails   I saw this one today    Ohhhhhhhhh Sooooorry             FUCKIN CRAZY. THAT is  Uuuuu          U act nice on outside but in the inside . You re very DIRTY and fack            I ve asked her  again  to stop emailing me  because she s just abusive and crazy.    As I ve said before - I wouldn t recommend going here.  She seems like the kind of person who would do something vindictive  and possibly unsanitary  to your food if she didn t like that you asked whether or not her tortillas or beans were vegetarian.
Donut Taco Palace,97,So I did love this place. I would always call ahead of time to order my tacos on corn tortilla. Never had a problem before but now they don t have corn tortillas until 8 or later. That doesn t work for people who have jobs they have to be at.
Donut Taco Palace,98,This place is really close to my apartment so I really wish I liked it more. I m sure it s tough making all that variety perfectly but if that s the case  maybe they should pick one to specialize in. I ve only had the donuts but I have had them multiple times. They aren t very consistent. Some days they ll be great  and other days I ll wish I hadn t wasted my money. They are very popular though. There are always people waiting  whether it s just a few or a line out the door.
Donut Taco Palace,99,Normally  I am quite the fan of little grab-n-go Donut joints  especially when they are located near a major highway or road  so as to promote convenience. Unfortunately. this outpost did not provide the most spectacular experience of fried starch indulgence in recent times.  The butter or sugar  I couldn t even tell  was yellow  to the max. I know for a fact that eater of these products  when baked  should not leave even the slightest hint of something golden in hue. Did I just use the word hue to describe a donut  Yes  and not for good measure.  That little aside having been stated  I will say that the donuts themselves were not of highest quality. The blueberry was... blueberry  but again  that little yellow gunk just sort of scared me. It looked a lot like those assorted chemicals you put on your car to remove funky messes.  The cinnamon roll was roughly akin to a donut.. rolled up... and fried. No cinnamon  no body  no butteriness. Aside from that oddly-tinted slime that was caked onto my oil-cooked batter. OK  I really did talk a little too much about the yellow stuff.  Donut Tacos Palace has yellow radioactive material spread all over their donuts. OK  sorry  really. But  I just can t get over that fact that my chicken fat cranked out from bone stock looks like what the put on their American breakfast staple. But  I do think donuts fried in chicken fat made really sweet would actually be quite good.
Donut Taco Palace,100,Birthdays   Donuts and Tacos  Fathers Day   Donuts and Tacos   Mothers Day   Donuts and Tacos  Groundhog Day   Donuts and Tacos  First Day of School    Hellz yeah  Donuts and Tacos  Honestly  not the most spectacular breakfast food in Austin  but Donut Palace is cheap  tasty  and close to my  hood. Everyone in the family leaves happy and satisfied ... because they have muthafing donuts AND tacos.
Donut Taco Palace,101,The selection is mediocre and the service is terrible.   Save yourself a trip and keep on goin..
Donut Taco Palace,102,The number of days that I have found myself split between needing a taco or a donut are almost to numerous to recall.  Hidden away is this terrific solution.  A somewhat large selection allows many choices and many different adventures.  The quality is fine  and the prices are nice.  All in all a good stop and a great place for some breakfast solutions.
Donut Taco Palace,103,The best donuts south of the river  Great customer service. Open very early and only close one day of the year.
Donut Taco Palace,104,We always call ahead to order their breakfast tacos on corn. They re premade tacos are good but are all on flour.
Donut Taco Palace,105,I ve driven by this place for years but never stopped in.  The name always made me think of some unhealthy taco stuffed with donuts - like those burger places that use donuts in lieu of buns.  But this morning  I took my 3-year old there since donuts have become one of his latest obsessions.   We d just taken him to Krispy Kreme yesterday -  please don t  call me a bad parent .  Turns out they had a nice selection of donuts and kolaches as well as breakfast tacos.  I guess that name really does fit.  My son picked out a pink glazed donut with sprinkles and was very happy with his selection.  I tried a couple of breakfast tacos  a potato egg cheese and a bacon egg.    The potato egg cheese was very good  almost on par with Taco Shack which happens to be my fave.  I would have liked the bacon in the bacon egg to be full strips rather than diced pieces mixed into the egg.  But given my distance from the nearest Taco Shack  I may start frequenting this place more regularly.  I liked the salsa that comes with the tacos  there s a nice little kick of spice in it.
Donut Taco Palace,106,I m just rating the donuts here. Big caveat - I ve yet to try the donut taco  because it s made to order and I m usually on the run.  The donuts are average or slightly below. Still doughy and sweet  but don t expect anything great. Service is a little bit slow and definitely not that friendly. Ask for a chocolate bar and you ll get a round chocolate glaze  or a cream-filled bar. In four trips I ve yet to get the order right.   If you re nearby and starving or picking up donuts for the office  go right ahead  otherwise keep moving.
Donut Taco Palace,107,Went here on a wimb this past weekend and loved it  Great drink  doughnut  and taco selection  Was impressed with how everything tasted and will definitely be back   Some type of stamp card would be a great added incentive 
Donut Taco Palace,108,Ironically  I go to this place all the time  not for Donuts nor Tacos.  The donuts are good...don t get me wrong.  Tacos are average at best.  I find them on the bland side  but many others seem to enjoy.  The reason I go there are their Kolaches and breakfast sandwiches.  In fact  I think that is the reason most repeat customers go there.  Their croissant sandwiches are ridiculously good. Very light and flaky.  They also make a croissant kolache that I d highly recommend  unique twist on a old time favorite .  I personally a biased to the heat  and go for the jalapeno kolaches.  Need to have a bottle of water around for those  but very addictive.   So  give it a try.  You won t be disappointed.
Donut Taco Palace,109,So I go in yesterday om the 25th and order a potatoe and egg breakfast taco  drive alllll the way to work which is 30 mins away only to open it and see a potato  bacom  and egg. I call  the spanish speaking lady gives me to an english speaking  she is rude after telling her what happened and what kind of diet I have  she says   well I dont know you.  Im thinking like.... what  You dont have to know me  Im telling you.  So she tells me to bring the taco in with the receipt this morning. I bring it in with my receipt  the lady remembers me and then proceeds to tell me what I told her. She says   you said potatoe  bacon  and egg.    I m a pescitarian. Why the hell would I ordee bacon in my taco  I have never ordered a meat taco since Ive first stepped foot in there. She was extremely rude. Why would you argue with a customer  Does it make her feel good and justified to argue with me by telling me what I DIDNT say  Must be guilt. She is older than me anf obviously doesnt have the life skills to afmit when she made a mistake or apologize. I understand she is not getting paid enough to be nice  but there are SO many college students who will do a better job for the same pay whp will treat us hard working  NICE citizens of America with respect. Im paying for the food and services  after all  it wasnt free. Contacting owners about this and will write to the Statesman. After being unhappy before  I decided to give it ajother chance because  hey  how can you mess up om a premade taco order. When I walked out of the door i said   why would I order bacon  Im a pescitarian.  She said   well thats your fault.  There were children there  mind you. Um. choosing to eat fish and vegetables over pork  chicken  beef  duck  etc is not a fault  its a lifestyle and diet. Since I have been discriminated against  I will make sure to take the time to handle this properly.   Act with grace at your low paying job and if you cant  a college student can surely take your place.
Donut Taco Palace,110,I replace any previous breakfast taco review saying it was the best in Austin with this one.  Donut Taco Palace is the best breakfast taco available. Also great donuts  pastries  kolaches  breakfast sandwiches and nice people.   Never a long wait. Looks like a hole in the wall. Awesome food.
Donut Taco Palace,111,If you want easy to view options  feeling welcome or friendly service do not buy here. The line makes it impossible to see and then it is a order on demand and speedy  you are not asked how many you want and then they are crammed into bags and the toppings smash onto the next donut. Much easier to view and made to feel welcome at a competitor place. The taco has minimal filling and no welcome thank you for coming  no smile  no thank you for your purchase. Tried this place but glad there are tons of other options. Actually the local gas station is more welcoming and the parking is limited too.
Donut Taco Palace,112,I have visited this establishment five plus times. The tacos are great  the donuts are ok but the service is terrible. I usually chalk it up to that they are busy and probably under staffed. Today however  they were not busy. I asked for 2 bacon egg cheese tacos and 2 sausage egg tacos which they happened to be out of the ready made tacos. The lady helping me said they had no more and offered me sausage egg potato. I told her I could not do potato and asked if they were making them in the back like they have all the other times I ve been at this establishment. At first she told me not right now and when I pushed the issue a bit more she said well you ll have to wait 15 minutes. It was as if asking for the taco place to make me a taco was an inconvenience. And they weren t even busy with a sign saying the kitchen closes at 12 45pm. I entered the establishment at 10 15. I ve only encountered one pleasant employee here. Every one else acts as if taking and fulfilling your order is the last thing they want to.
Donut Taco Palace,113,Good donuts. Terrible service. They recently got my order wrong because she was talking to her workmate rather than me. She said she couldn t give me the correct kolache..makes no sense.
Donut Taco Palace,114,So delicious  Their breakfast tacos are amazing and they always have a great selection of yummy donuts   
Donut Taco Palace,115,Good donuts and a fair price. I like their hours  open early on Sunday  but would agree with other posts about the service  it was just OK...the first girl who tried to help me was not understanding what I was asking for...glazed donuts. Then the owner stepped in and took over. Maybe it was her first day  who knows...we  have all had a first day at a new job  so it s not that big of a deal. Heck  we got our donuts  we had a sugar high then a sugar coma...a perfect Sunday.   
Donut Taco Palace,116,Donuts good  very good...seriously this little jewel has great donuts.  Almost Orange County style...if you ve ever spent any time in Orange County you know there is a donut place on every corner....the ones with the cool big donut signs on top...never understood how all of these donut places stayed in business in the so called healthy center of the universe...maybe it has something to do with your relative location - closer to the beach  less good donut spots  farther away hello  Purple  - sorry have to go Homer when we are talking donuts......anyhooo back to this place...they got the donut down cold errr hot they are good and they have a great selection all made really fresh....definitely worth the stop...their tacos are pretty good even if they do pre-make them and put them in a hot hold - no where near Dan s quality but they will do their job....  Donuts 4.5 stars Tacos 3 stars....  If you are in the area you can t go wrong here.
Donut Taco Palace,117,Service is absolutely terrible. The ladies here make me feel un-welcomed and expect me to know exactly what I want when I ve never seen their menu options. The food is mediocre  and even after a second visit a short time later I got the same rude attitudes.
Donut Taco Palace,118,I got there at 1240pm on Saturday afternoon. I ordered tacos for myself and the kids. Which at that time we were told they wouldn t make anymore tacos except for the three in the glass door. Service wasn t great and I expected a lot more.
Donut Taco Palace,119,We used to live very close to this location and I miss our 5am breakfast taco and donut runs  Such excellent and savory tacos with a great variety of options too  Favorite donuts to get were the raspberry filled donut holes. This is the only place I have found that makes these. I now live in north Austin but it might be worth the 45 minute drive next time I get a craving at 5am...
Donut Taco Palace,120,I stop by this morning to get 3 dozen donuts and some decaf coffee and left with just 2 breakfast tacos. the donuts looked good but they did not have the coffee. the lady who took my order stated.  we don t do decaf.  I decided to go elsewhere to get the coffee and donuts. the breakfast tacos were good so I may stop there again. the service was average speed but they did not have a very welcoming approach. that being said they may be having an off day. but it would be nice if they had decaf coffee so I could just go to one place to pick up donuts and coffee
Donut Taco Palace,121,Make a quick run in here for their ready made breakfast tacos. I tried the potato egg cheese  comes with a side of salsa for  1.69....that s a steal in my book  I guess they can get super busy  so while it would be great to have your taco made to order  it s nice that they re ready and in a warmer to get you in and out quicker. My taco was still hot so it s definitely not an issue. Huge fun selection of fresh made donuts  too. Private parking out front. Seat yourself inside. Not tons of seating  but most people were running in and grabbing the tacos to go. Def the place to go for cheap breakfast tacos 
Donut Taco Palace,122,This place closes at 1pm so don t think it s always closed as we assumed. Go there in the morning and you will see the loyal clientele lined up.  The tacos are hot  fresh and awesome. The donut varieties are enough to match DD. This was our first time here but now that we know  should be our regular bkfst place.
Donut Taco Palace,123,Overall  I d say the donuts lack flavor. Maybe they re too doughy or maybe it s the glaze  but they re not the best donuts I ve ever had. However  they are cheap and they seem to be somewhat fresh. The kolaches are good.
Donut Taco Palace,124,Ok ive Been to trulucks french quarter grill nothing like this I mean come on a barbacoa taco with a jelly donut yum
Donut Taco Palace,125,Love this place     I cant say enough about how good  fast  and convenient it is  The staff is so very friendly and efficient at this location as well  Great place 
Donut Taco Palace,126,The best donuts ever. I love the egg croissants and the tacos are damn good too  Very reasonable. Expect a line on the  weekends. This place is popular 
Donut Taco Palace,127,I love DTP     It is quick and reasonably priced   So delicious  Salsa is amazing   I ve tried just about everything  never been let down 
Donut Taco Palace,128,The previous reviewers that didn t love this place have no sense of whimsy. I mean Sweet Mother of stoner business names    Donut Taco Palace     Can you imagine the back story of how they thought up that little gem     We d seen the sign every time we drove down 290  peeking over the overpass at us like a giggling hippie trying to hold a lung full in. We d commented on it. Even joked about it. What an odd choice of specific and non related foods. Who besides the local NORML chapter would go to a place that only sold tacos and donuts  I mean Geez. Evidently  the answer to that question is me.   I couldn t stop thinking about it. What went on in that shop  Were the tacos made with donut dough  Were the donuts made with tortillas  I had to know. And then  one day  Mistress Linda and I were doing some shopping and had to go right past it. We looked at each other  nodded wordlessly  and I turned in. That was the best move I ve made in months.   They have much more than just donuts and tacos my friends. Oh so much more. We tried an assortment. Here s the deal. Breakfast tacos.  1.50. Little tubes of delight that fill you up. They make bacon  chorizo  bean  potato  meat  meatless  all made fresh and fast. The tortillas taste freshly made. We had the bacon and the chorizo with flour. I don t know if they have corn. Then it was on to croissant sandwiches. I ve forgotten the price but I remember thinking  this is a great deal   I had the ham  egg and cheese. A fresh croissant  with a slice of real ham  a freshly fried over easy egg  and a slice of melted cheese  then the whole thing is put on the griddle for just a sec. I took a bite and went all James Brown doing I Feel Good in my mind. Really  I felt good. Damn good. Kolaches were in evidence so I had one. A sausage one. Very good kolache dough  light and sweet  but the sausage was basically a hot dog. It was more like a really good pig in a blanket. I probably wouldn t get it again but I liked it well enough. They also have biscuits  and biscuit sandwiches that looked good  but we were on to the donuts by this time. They have a large assortment  but they open at 5 am  and the favorites sell out early. They were out of cake donuts at 10 am so we got glazed  chocolate  cr me filled and what I would call a bear claw. We both took a bite of one at the same time. I think it was Aristotle  or possibly Justin Timberlake that said   Damn Girl  Damn Girl  Damn Girl . I finally realize what that means. That is how good these donuts were. Some seemed a bit more dense than the usual light donut  but I like that. In all honesty I haven t had a donut in a long time so that may have added to the feeling of bliss.   We ve been back since and have tried other things  and every time we come away thinking this is wonderful  fresh food at great prices. I bought a brunch and snack for 3 adults for less than  12.00 and we had leftovers. For about an hour. And the ladies behind the counter are so nice you feel like a regular on your first day  They have a cold drink case with bottled soft drinks and water  and they use only fair trade grown coffee. How much better can this get 
Donut Taco Palace,129,Donuts. Tacos. And all in one palace. What more could a girl want   No matter what you get  you will NOT be disappointed. There is always a line out the door of happy customers coming to get thumbs up shaped donuts  literal donut tacos  and other tasty things from the friendly staff behind the counter. Be sure to check out the paper menu  not the hanging one  as they can make all kinds of tacos that are not advertised.
Donut Taco Palace,130,Might be one of the best hidden gem breakfast taco joints around south Austin. Well maybe it s not so hidden bc there s always a line to the door 
Donut Taco Palace,131,Got up this glorious Sunday morning in Austin and had the urge for some good breakfast.  Yelped all kinds of cafe s and places like that.  Then I stumbled across a place named  Donut Tacos Palace.   I knew this was the place.  Just finished a sausage egg breakfast taco and a sausage kolache.  The taco was ok.  It was pulled from a warmer and while some breakfast goodies are alright from a warmer  tacos are not.  Shells get soggy and mooshy tasting.  Just not very pleasant.  However  the baked goodies looked absolutely mouthwatering.  The kolache was flaky and sweet and not like it was just rolled in dough and baked.  As I was doctoring my coffee  which was a very good cup of coffee.  I noticed almost everyone was ordering a kolache or croissant breakfast sandwich.  A sign of what their best items are perhaps   After how my kolache tasted I m definitely going back for more of those baked goodies in the future.  The gals behind the counter were also very nice and quick.  The price can t be beat either.  Large coffee...kolache and taco for under 5 bucks.    I debated giving them a 4 due to the tacos...but as long as you don t go in expecting Torchy s on the taco side  you ll be more than pleased.
Donut Taco Palace,132,My coworker brought in some food from this place for breakfast..and it was really delicious  I agree it very socal style espeically the tacos. I haven t been to the actual restaurant  but will have to try to make it there  I think they close early at 1pm  or so I was told. The fajita chicken tacos were really good and the other breakfast items looked good also  they have a little bit of everything  from breakfast sandwiches to taco  to donuts..yum 
Donut Taco Palace,133,I have to get up really early in the morning for work  and I mean REALLY EARLY   One of the few places open is Donut Tacos Palace.  They open at five and close at one in the afternoon  they have three locations mostly on the south and west side.  They have a decent array of tacos that aren t bad.  But it s hard to have your tacos stand out in a town that serves breakfast tacos everyplace.  The donuts are good  with the yellow glaze  and they have a huge selection of different types.  They also have kolaches  kolaches  and more kolaches.  All in all it s a pretty nice place to be in if you have to be awake at five in the morning.
Donut Taco Palace,134,Not good. The donut was not fresh and the breakfast sandwich was pre-made  they simply microwaved it . I tossed it because I couldn t stand the flavor. You re better off going to McDonalds for the same kind of service you get here.
Donut Taco Palace,135,   THis is a Breakfast Taco Review   Still searching for a good breakfast taco place in SW austin.  Ugh.   Like KC Donut  this place promotes kolaches and donuts above the tacos  which are special order only.  The taste was ok  but nothing special.
Donut Taco Palace,136,I m updating this because the owner showed concern about my bad experience and was very apologetic. Tacos are good  Nice business
Donut Taco Palace,137,My fajita breakfast taco was very good but I will admit  I sure wish it was a Tacos Donut version.  Unfortunately they were not make them this morning so I missed out  - 
Donut Taco Palace,138,The new girl behind the counter is extremely rude the past couple times I ve came in there conversation behind the counter is more important than a paying customer...
Donut Taco Palace,139,You will find this to be a very unpretentious and fairly priced place  in what will initially seem like an odd location.  But just go.  I go almost every Saturday for the kids.  The tacos are great  and don t pass on the apple fritter.  Don t let the line scare you... it will look long  but even if the line is at the door  you will be served in about 5 minutes.  Don t be a hater if you go and it s closed.  They are only open until 1pm.
Donut Taco Palace,140,Small store easy to miss off the freeway but amazing.  This is my 10th time going now over a year or so.  Coworkers love the tacos  doughnut holes  and croiscants  I love the speed  price  and atmosphere   I usually come here for breakfast on sundays because I can t get alcohol in the morning  P but all the food is amazing and I haven t had an unpleasant experience yet       I went this morning after hearing about the donut-taco  now I got the bacon egg and cheese and it was everything you could want in a donut taco.  Even got salsa  though syrup would have been equally as good I think.  Eggs and bacon throughly cooked and donut made to order at 5  the most expensive thing they sell  only complaint was I couldn t finish it.  Ya 5  gets you good food here and breakfast is most important meal of the day 
Donut Taco Palace,141,Got to be some of the best donuts in Austin.  Breakfast tacos  pretty darn good.  Kolaches  awesome   
Donut Taco Palace,142,These aren t the greatest donuts  but I d still go back.  It seemed like a little mom and pop place so I don t have high expectations.  It s also very inexpensive and close to home.    They have a lot to choose from...donuts  tacos  kolaches you name it   The woman behind the counter didn t seem pleased that I took longer than the usual customer to make up my mind.  I was pretty hungry so I ordered a donut  taco  kolache and coffee.  I ordered a french vanilla coffee and was surprised it was far too sweet even for me.  The donut was a little dry  but the potato and cheese taco was really good and the kolache was the best part.  It s a good place if you re looking for a quick breakfast.  I can t help but wonder how they came up with the name 
Donut Taco Palace,143,the absolute best breakfast tacos in the entire city...i m not kidding    yes  the counter service can be slow...because they re always packed. i call my order in ahead of time  and walk straight up to the counter. enjoy   
Donut Taco Palace,144,This place is horrible. Only time it is good is early in the morning. The later you go the more stale and nasty the tacos and donuts taste. The staff makes me sick to my stomach. One of the girls is a wanna be cholo the other looks like snookie. They are rude  tacos are cold and rarely good. Dont water your time. This place is trash 90  of the time.
Donut Taco Palace,145,i have to withdraw my bad review of this place....they stop making tacos at 12 30 and i guess the 1st time i went here the cook was out sick or something....anyway i gave it another shot because my kids wanted a donut and im glad i did ....the food is good tacos are not really what i would call authentic  mexican  style tacos but they are good and big....the kolaches egg sausage cheese muffins are off the chain and the donuts are top notch.....give em a try
Donut Taco Palace,146,Wow  I can t believe the negative reviews  ... lack of selection.....only good thing is the name...  etc. I have been an instant fan of this place since the minute i walked in.  First  let s talk about the name  it is very obvious.  What I love most is that a lot of times I can t decide if I want sweet or savory for breakfast or brunch  and here  you can have both. They make their breakfast tacos daily here  amp  I have tried many with no complaints. My typical order might be  1 egg  amp  nopales taco  1 potato egg cheese  1 jalapeno cheese sausage croissant  and half a dozen donut holes. As far as service goes  I have never had any issues  amp  the people are always great. No  this place is not gourmet  it is not trendy  the decor is pretty lame  so if that is the kind of place you re looking for then  yeah  you might be disappointed.  Overall  a good selection of various breakfast tacos  and donuts  always good service  pretty great hours for a  donut  place  and reasonable prices.
Donut Taco Palace,147,I m starting a donut taste tour across Austin in a mission to find the best donut around. I m posting on vine so find me... tastetest and you ll see a few of mine. I would drive by Donut Taco Palace everyday and giggle and then wonder what it must be like in there. Today  I finally went in and was not disappointed. I love that each donut they sell is i a picture frame and hung along the walls. I didn t try anything else  tacos kolaches  but I can say that  these donuts were great  This location is clean and has a good sized area to dine in. Their donuts are soft  fluffy and have a yellow glaze instead. These are the cheapest donuts I ve seen so far at 69cents each.
Donut Taco Palace,148,Rudy s   Bill Miller   Torchy s   Please   Krispy Kreme   Round Rock   Shipley s   Please  again   This place is  awesome  - best breakfast tacos and salsa with the widest selection hands down   1.75 each  and they re fresh and warm.  They also have beautiful  delicious doughnuts.  Again  the selection is impressive.  Doughnut sandwiches   They do those  too   The place is clean  bright  and there is a seating for dine-in.  The staff is warm and friendly.  Go between 5 am - 1 pm most days and see for yourself   
Mi Trailita Y Mas,1,Really happy this crew was able to transition from a food truck to this brick and mortar location. Some of the obvious things  their tacos are phenomenal. Carnitas  Barbacoa and pastor are the usuals for us. However  since opening this location I ve gotten the breakfast and fajita plates multiple times and they are filling and delicious. Really happy to have this place in the neighborhood.   Side note  this isn t their problem  but the shopping center this restaurant is in  is absolutely terrible. Lock your doors and look around  can t believe the city of austin allows it to be so dangerous here.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,2,Have been to the trailer before it closed but this is the first time I have been to the brick n mortar location. Do judge the outside by what is inside. This place is awesome   This place serves some awesome food and it is definitely worth checking out. The staff is very friendly and the environment is cozy inside. Be sure to order online or just be prepared to wait a little while for your food. Nothing crazy but we had to wait for about 25 min.   For food  we had the picadillo taco  carnitas taco  and the bistek plate. They were all delicious and I would totally have all of them again. The bistek plate was great size and definitely shareable with a few other items and you get tortillas to go with it. We had both corn and flour tortillas and they were both handmade and amazing  but the corn tortillas absolutely surprised us as they were super flexible and thick and did not break. We added the different sauces they provide  a red and a green  and they were absolutely bomb to go on the tacos   You also get some nice salsa and chips while you wait at the restaurant.  Definitely recommend checking this place out  I will definitely be coming back
Mi Trailita Y Mas,3,The barbacoa and carnitas tacos slipped inside my mouth  down to my belly  and created a love nest of joy there.   And the cucumber agua fresca   Mama looooves.  I ve been twice now  and the man who works there is so sweet. Please go tell him I say hi 
Mi Trailita Y Mas,4,I have been blind...how have I missed this wonderful spot   The salsa is as good as any I ve had in town of late and their corn tortillas are hand made and melt in your mouth    We had chili Rellenos  and when another bite could not be eaten  we waddled out  I highly recommend you try this spot. Not fancy  but so close and so yum  Four paws up for food  price  friendly service and ease of access.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,5,Love their chorizo tacos  I always get the 5 mini specials ones with queso and chips. Their tortilla is always delicious  It s a bit pricey  but worth it. I don t recommend the horchata though.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,6,Flavor. Came here to check out the brick and mortar  the more  of Mi Trailita for lunch on a weekday. I got the bistek plate with rice and beans. My partner got the Chile Relleno. The bistek was flavorful. Seasoned just right with the beefy bits of the steak with a little bit of unctuous fatty bits. The refried beans were just the right consistency paired with rice. As for the salsa  I am a fan of the red salsa with sone tartness from the tomatillo. The green salsa had a bit of green chile to give it a kick. I also had the horchata which was good. However  the cucumber and lime agua Fresca my partner ordered was very refreshing. Service is friendly as well. If you are in the Windsor Park - East Austin area this should be a must go.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,7,Happy to see Mi Trailita growing and opening a store front...Super friendly service and some top notch food ..Chips  salsa and Queso hit the table...Chips are fresh and there salsa is tomatillo based with a great flavor and a decent amount of heat...actually the first green salsa that my wife has tried and went back in for seconds...it s definitely addictively spice...now don t miss out on this bottled sauces...those back a punch and I just couldn t stop with the red one..both are excellent ...We both went with the Chipotle Enchiladas...the chicken was tender and flavorful..Chipotle sauce was solid...there was a flavor profile I couldn t quite get but was very good  We both enjoyed the rice...fluffy...well seasoned....Beans were bomb  and had a great consistency...overall an awesome 1st visit and won t be our last 
Mi Trailita Y Mas,8,I tried the beef fajita gordita and it was so delicious. It had a nice crisp  the cotija cheese was fresh and the fajitas were so tasty. I will definitely be here again.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,9,This is easily the best Mexican food in town. Everything we ve tried has been delicious. The mole enchiladas in particular are truly outstanding.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,10,Burritos are really good  Great service. Always very friendly. Amazing prices. Second time going here would go again
Mi Trailita Y Mas,11,As close to a home cooked meal as you get in Austin. This place is a perfect addition to the beloved Austin taco truck. The new restaurant serves a similar menu as the original truck  excellent corn tortillas  great breakfast and lunch tacos  tortas  tostadas  gorditas  and quesadillas.  The restaurant also expands with newer dishes like enchiladas  verdes  chipotle  and a Tex-Mex iteration  and chile rellenos.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,12,Manager contacted us and apologized for our bad experience  amp  offered a refund instead of us having to go in person to speak to him. Since the food was excellent  we will try this again.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,13,Great breakfast tacos. I always get the migas or bacon potato egg and cheese. No frills place. You can order online in advance  which you couldn t do when it was a food truck.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,14,Open on Sunday s  Just as good as the food truck  plus the brick and mortar has tortas  Chile releno  etc. Great horchata and really nice bean and cheese  chicken  Al pastor and carnitas tacos. And affordable 
Mi Trailita Y Mas,15,i went here when it was a food truck to my surprise it is now a restaurant. Congratulations you all deserve it. I love your taco i especially love your moist  good barbacoa. I am going back today or lunch to try Beef Quesabirria tacos
Mi Trailita Y Mas,16,Great spot with great tacos. Campachano is my favorite  and be sure to try the pepino water too  it s very refreshing.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,17,Amazing tacos  the best corn tortillas. Very clean  good service  and fast. Excellent chips and salsa too. Good music too
Mi Trailita Y Mas,18,Barbacoa  Slammin  Pastor  Delicious Carnitas  Don t forget it  Made to order corn tortillas  solid salsa  and awesome management. Nice unassuming spot for good grub 
Mi Trailita Y Mas,19,Amazing tacos  specially the barbacoa. You can also have quesadillas or burritos with any of the meats. The staff is also nice and they are fast doing your order.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,20,This business started as a food trailer only offering only fresh made dishes.   They have opened a second location which is a brick and morter. Both offer the same great freshly made cuisine at a reasonable price. The only way you can go wrong is to not go to one of their locations.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,21,My husband and I have lived in Austin for over 30 years and this is our favorite Mexican food place.  They had a food truck for years and recently opened the sit down restaurant.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,22,Great tacos  a bit on the small side so I d get four where I usually order three. Horchata is good but not the best we ve had. For the taco meat the carnitas is tops so far  campechano and pastor good but I d try the barbacoa instead next time
Mi Trailita Y Mas,23,Let me start off by saying these are by far the best breakfast tacos I ve had in Austin. Not only are the tacos amazing  the price is great too. My favorite taco is Chorizo  bean  potato  cheese on corn. Staff is very friendly as well 
Mi Trailita Y Mas,24,I m so excited that the much-beloved Mi Trailita now has a brick and mortar  They have all the good stuff from the food truck s menu  plus a number of new additions  fajitas  enchiladas  flautas  etc . They have longer hours than the truck  and the option for online ordering  which is nice. They ve been open for a week and I ve already gotten takeout twice. I have no doubt this will become my regular spot for straight-up Mexican Tex-Mex.
Mi Trailita Y Mas,25,Amazing tacos and great service  To go process is super easy and quick. Best tacos in Windsor Park 
Trudys Del Mar,1,Yummy       Queso and guacamole were amazing. Try the seafood and other spins on these traditional dishes.   So much more to review  I want to go back and try everything
Trudys Del Mar,2,This place used to be one of my fave places to go on SoCo- South Congress cafe but alas things change.  We were wandering SoCo and noticed the front of the house wasn t very full as we walked past. As we crossed the next intersection I turned by head and remembered that it had a patio. They should really put some signage on front sidewalk  or maybe I just missed it   The back patio is lovely. There were water fan misters  plenty of open tables  and live music  We were greeted with a smile but a nice guy  sorry I can t remember his name . He said he was in training but you couldn t tell  the service was great   We ordered two margaritas and some chips and salsa. My friend wanted an Electric Jellyfish  which was on tap. I mean if it s on tap you HAVE to get it. It s just so good  The taps were fine so he got a margarita instead.  iykyk There is the live  mellow  sit around and chat music every Thursday from 6-8. Go check it out.
Trudys Del Mar,3,We stopped for a snack in the middle of a shopping day. Ordered guacamole and tortilla chips then sweet potato beignets with whipped cream  strawberries and blueberries. Food was yummy.   They have comfy booths and regular tables. Clean bathrooms.  Lauren was a good server and kept our drinks refilled.
Trudys Del Mar,4,I hear the tacos were really good  but I would have to give the interior decor a 1 star for a restaurant on South Congress. We shared the Del Mar entree. The steak was not bad  but the lobster was a bit over cooked. The service was good. Our waiter even took photos of us outside in front of the mural per his suggestion.
Trudys Del Mar,5,Great service and good food. The house salad was PERFECT on a warm afternoon. We always enjoy the patio and look forward to coming back. Good choice for those looking for gluten-free options.
Trudys Del Mar,6,In Austin for a weekend with work friends  our party of eight met up for dinner and drinks at Trudy s Del Mar to kick off the festivities... Since this place seems to have quite the brunch reputation  it was quieter than expected in the evening  but that wasn t a bad thing for us.  Service was a tad bit slow  but friendly nonetheless  and the margaritas  chips  queso  and guac made up for that... Everyone in our party seemed pleased with their entrees as well.    I had a shrimp taco  a lobster taco  a side of beans and a side of veggies and I left with a full belly.  Others in the party went for ceviche  crudo  chicken  etc... I didn t keep track of it all  but as mentioned above  everyone seemed pleased.  I would definitely return for dinner  but sounds like brunch at Trudy s is quite an experience as well.
Trudys Del Mar,7,We loved the Queso Del Mar aka lobster queso .... So freaking good  My kid got the carrot cake French toast and it had me stealing bites off her plate  I d come back again and again for these two things for sure. The husband and I shared the Del Mar Grill. The mezcal mangonada was just ok. I was kind of expecting more on that. I m not sure if we lucked out or if it was timing  but we had zero wait on a Saturday afternoon. I m looking forward to trying more of the menu here and will definitely be back.
Trudys Del Mar,8,Came here for brunch on Sunday morning right when they opened at 10 00 am. I was a bit apprehensive as Trudy s is a chain  but Trudy s Del Mar was a totally different experience. Set off of South Congress  when you get here around this time there s plenty of street parking and a lot less of a crowd. Apparently there was some kind of grand reopening today   We had the Carnitas Hash  sooo good     the Sweet Potato Beignets  and some strawberry mimosas. Everything was really yummy and I couldn t find one negative thing about anything we ordered. The carnitas hash was super flavorful  the meat was moist  and the overall hash was delightful. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive  there was also an amazing giant painting of a mermaid jumping into an ocean full of sharks  gorgeous colors and fit the theme of the restaurant . All in all  a great experience and I ll definitely be back 
Trudys Del Mar,9,We visited Trudy s for brunch today. We we re planning on another restaurant but there was a long wait. I m so glad  Trudy s was amazing  The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. The p sele was delicious  as was the blt  The bacon on it was outstanding  We also got the carrot Ake French toast. Delicious  Can t wait to come back 
Trudys Del Mar,10,Trudy s Del Mar offers Mexican inspired seafood dishes plus honoring some of the former South Congress Cafe s classic specialties. I adore the coastal vibes  the food is phenomenal  and love their bar program which offers everything from sensational hand-crafted cocktails to fine wines that easily pairs with their dishes. We are talking mouthwatering steaks Oscar style to tantalizing crudos  they truly impress    Here is what we tried   FILET MIGNON OSCAR 8OZ.   Filet Mignon. Oscar Sauce. Roasted Potatoes. Saut ed Spinach.  our fav bite  FRESH CATCH CRUDO   Fresh Catch. Blood Orange. Sesame Seed. Citrus Sesame Vinaigrette. LOBSTER Taco   Mango Aioli. Slaw. Avocado Slice. SPICY JALAPE O CUCUMBER Margarita   Socorro Blanco. Jalisco Orange. Jalape os. Cucumbers. Fresh Lime Juice. Agave.  LOVED it  COPPOLA DIRECTOR S CUT   Sonoma County  California BIELER PERE ET FILS   Provence  France
Trudys Del Mar,11,Came here for a refresher drink to wet our whistles. The Whiskey Mule was just right thanks to Tory   And of course ordered two delicious appetizers. One was blood orange ceviche and the other was Guac Del Mar.
Trudys Del Mar,12,Hold your seahorses because there is a new restaurant in town  Trudy s Del Mar  This concept takes both tex-mex and seafood cuisines to give you a fun interesting twist with dishes such as   - Del Mar Queso  queso blanco topped with shrimp  lobster  crab  pico  spinach  and avocado salsa - very creamy  amp  the seafood flavors are very pronounced   16   - Blood Orange Ceviche  mahi mahi and shrimp mixed with blood orange pico  sesame seeds  radish  and mint - a refreshing  light appetizer   15   - Del Mar Guacamole  guacamole topped with shrimp  lobster  crab  pico  chives  and olive oil - great  but feel the Del Mar style works better in queso instead   16   - Yucatan Bacon Guacamole  guacamole topped with pineapple pico  queso  cotija  cholula  and candied honey bacon - my fav    14   - Tacos  there are 9 types to choose from  some unique  some regular  and I got  Lobster   14   Seared Tuna Pastor   9   Crab Cake   7   and Candied Pastor Bacon   5  - Candied Bacon was my fav. The others were good  but a bit pricey imo  - Del Mar Grill  shrimp  lobster tail  steak fajita  and jalape o sausage with veggies served with rice  beans  and tortillas - great dish if you want something to share with people   48   - Honey Cholula Chicken  crispy chicken marinated in honey and cholula hot sauce with veggies - nice crisp outside  soft tender inside   20   - Mezcal Mangonada  a mezcal-based marg with mango  orange  lime juice  and tajin - a good contrast of smokey  amp  sweet   14   - The 1942  a Don Julio 1942 tequila-based marg with lime juice and agave - may be pricey  but it s STRONG   20   - Carrot Cake French Toast Sundae  2 pieces of carrot cake cooked like French toast with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream - A MUST GET  amp  can easily be shared with 2-4 people   10   Overall  there is a wide selection of options to choose from. The prices may seem a bit on the higher end  but the portions are big and most things here are shareable. I liked everything I got and don t have much critical feedback. That said  I give them a 4.5 5 for being amazing  They re now one of my new fav spots.
Trudys Del Mar,13,Trudy s has been my go to for crab cakes  Staff is amazing  food is reaallyyyy good  Plates are a really good size. Recommend this place   
Trudys Del Mar,14,Really good happy hour   Great service   We ate inside as it was too hot for the patio.  We had  5 shrimp skewer  queso  blackened fish taco and fajita tacos.  All were really goid
Trudys Del Mar,15,I m a local and I never write Yelp reviews. In this case I m making an exception. Trudy s has great food at a great price  My wife and I come here regularly and have enjoyed everything on the menu.   Let s start with Happy Hour. They have  5 bites and two can make a meal out of 4-5 bites. Almost all the beverages are discounted as well.   If you visit Cabo or Pierre Vallarta regularly  you ll feel like you re there. The seafood is fresh and prepared like you d expect on the best restaurants in Cabo    The wait staff are on it  They take great care to make sure you re satisfied.   We have adopt this place as our regular  go to  in SoCo. You should too 
Trudys Del Mar,16,I ve been a devoted Trudy s fan for over 30 years. Their new Soco locarion and seafood oriented del mar is their latest iteration. Could walk in and get a table on a Saturday at 11 30 no problem.  Dont think they take reservations...the nice outdoor  in the back  patio was full however.  The food was good quality and value as expected. Salsa and chips come gratis  thank god  and they are both quality Austin standards. Our waitress  being trained by a pro  offered us special waters and drinks in a nice but persistent way...cant blame them. She did upsell us to try 1 slice of the carrot cake french toast   4  which was excellent to share but too sweet for an entire meal for me. The migas eggs were pretty good  couldve used some salt but salsa on top did the trick . The beans and veggies  substitution allowed for potatoes  were very good with tons of flavor and at  10 a very good value.  Crabcakes qere very good and reasonable pricing as well.  And the location right on Soco and redone soco cafe interiors cant be beat. Only warning is that we were wanting tacos etc found on the website menu but we were only offered a  brunch  menu and didnt ask for tacos and the standard tex mex on the regular menu so check which menu is available so you arent dissapointed.
Trudys Del Mar,17,I live in the neighborhood  and I avoided this place for a while because I was salty about the SoCo Cafe closing. But a friend asked me there for lunch  and I was amazed. It s better than the old SoCo  The ceviches are delicious. So far I ve had the blackened fish  crab cake and tuna tacos  and all were fantastic. The decor is relaxing. The service -- even on a Wednesday night -- was first rate. And the margaritas are still the same as the old SoCo -- salty  tangy  with fresh lime juice and just the right amount of tequila. I ll be back 
Trudys Del Mar,18,I happened upon this restaurant when I was staying at a nearby Airbnb. I ve lived in Austin since 1981 and of course used to go to Trudy s near campus long ago.   There are a few dishes here that pay tribute to the original Trudy s   but most dishes here are a fresh take and so far I have loved everything I have tried  and so have my companions.   But let s start with margaritas. I prefer the one called formula one  but even the house margarita is stellar. No artificial anything and just delicious in every way.   Favorite appetizers have to be queso. The lobster queso is outstanding  and there s another one with black beans  spinach  and other fresh ingredients that was so yummy. The queso servings are quite generous  so I ve got some leftovers to look forward to tomorrow.   But get ready for crabcakes to die for   Three generously sized patties garnished just perfectly. I savored every bite  Today I also tried a blackened fish corn taco and was not disappointed with the generous portion of tender fish. Corn tortillas are made in house    Even chips and salsa are outstanding. I especially love the thin light chips  also made in house.   My friend got some sort of honey chicken and she loved it.   There are even plans to expand menu items for vegetarians too.   Servers are friendly and professional  decor is modern and cool.   I think my only complaint  and I admit I m older  is the music was too loud. It made it hard to converse even across a table.   Go check this place out and show it some love by writing a review. Tell your friends about it too. It s only been open a few weeks and I think it s a real gem. In the future there will be a patio out back too.   This is the first restaurant I ve been to in a long time due to health reasons and fear of Covid. It wasn t very crowded when I went  and I felt safe there. I m happy to report the wait staff wore masks. Thank you Trudy s Del Mar for a wonderful evening  I can t wait to go back.
Trudys Del Mar,19,So if you know this spot you know it used to be south congress cafe. That place had the best bloody Mary s and breakfast items. Now Trudy s is new but they still serve some of the same stuff. If you come here these few items are a must....a Bloody Mary  the carrot cake French toast  whether you get the meal or as a Al la Carte  this is a MUST  Now the only reason I gave this place a 4 star is how slowwww everything took from getting our food to getting the bill. It wasn t very busy here either. Other then that we already decided to come back because they have a BLT here that looks incredible.   JK s pro tip  order French toast Al la carte so you can sample stuff  also the honey cholula bacon  you will not be disappointed.
Trudys Del Mar,20,Not impressed with menu. Food was just ok- too much salt toppings took away from the taste. Definitely more of a place to grab a drink   small appetizer. Wouldn t recommend dinner.  Service was fast but honestly it was empty for a Friday night  unlike all the other restaurants on soco with hour   wait times.  Our server was nice but the food and ambience just didn t make sense. I m not sure how long this restaurant will stay in business...
Trudys Del Mar,21,newly open but big shoe to fill- how do you top the reputation of SCC    mahi-mahi shrimp ceviche... I liked it. Quite colorful with the blood orange.   everyone is drinking bubbles that morning.   The service was awesome and they are gonna open the patio for dogs   I just got one suggestion to add more brunch dishes since that was a strong suit of SCC
Trudys Del Mar,22,This place was awesome . Best service   best lobster   the waiter was amazing if you are in Austin definitely a must try
Trudys Del Mar,23,So far everything we ve had there has been excellent.  Some of the best tacos I ve ever tasted.  Shrimp  lobster  doesn t matter.  It s all great.  The crab cakes are spot on.  For apps you can t go wrong with the queso or the guac.  Some of the best I ve ever had.   The staff has been great too.  I m sure this place will be packed soon based on the food alone.  Everyone that went with us initially went back again within a week they like it so much.
Trudys Del Mar,24,I know this place when it used to be a SOCO cafe which was great .  Decided to try this new version out based on prior experience. Sadly quality of food had gone down significantly at least in this  seafood reiteration    Tuna tiradito was awful   no flavor and questionable quality. Fish taco was really subpar... calamari was over- breaded and not tasty ...sadly won t be back
Trudys Del Mar,25,Trudy s had me at crab cake tacos and sweet potato beignets   Super cute  friendly staff  good vibes  great food. What s not to like 
Trudys Del Mar,26,Having lived in Austin for several years we were sad that our SoCo Cafe was gone  but that feeling was immediately wiped out with our first bite of ceviche. We were in town for a wedding and stopped in for a quick lunch. The atmosphere inside is well thought out and makes for a very relaxed dining experience. The staff was attentive  friendly and kind. We had the Fresh Catch Crudo and the Del Mar guacamole. Both were fresh and delicious and made for a PERFECT snack while spending the day on South Congress.
Trudys Del Mar,27,I cannot say enough great things about this place   The ambiance was amazing  but somehow the food and service were just as spectacular. We got the Gigi salad  tuna tacos  Del Mar queso  elote  ceviche  and chicken taquitos and loved everything. They also have an amazing happy hour special  
Trudys Del Mar,28,The food was pretty good  especially the queso  amp  guac. The service was sorely lacking. Our waiter basically ignored us after bringing our plates. We sat there for 30 minutes waiting for tortillas so we could finish our  by then cold  meal.
Trudys Del Mar,29,Amazing  Three hours after my meal there and I m still reveling in the aftertastes. I had the honey Cholula chicken  insert whistle sound here  and shared a carrot cake French toast sundae with my new friend at the bar. Everyone from the bartender to the owner were so friendly. I want to go back for the good vibes as much for the food.
Trudys Del Mar,30,The food was amazing  They have a variety of traditional Mexican dishes and seafood selection. My friend and I had their seafood ceviche  not pictured  which was full of flavor and colorful. Also  not to mention it was a big portion so definitely a great appetizer to share with friends. For my entree  I had their red pork pozole  pictured below  which I enjoyed  The only reason why I did 4 stars is because during our visit  the table next to us had children who continued dropping their chairs  which caused some discomfort but I would definitely go back to try more food 
Trudys Del Mar,31,We ordered the BLT for brunch  which included an option to add egg. The sandwhich came out in two large halves with one egg on a side plate. Confused.   Potato s weren t good as a side or in the hash. Hash was soggy  sitting in its own liquid.   Extra table setting were not cleared from the table. Empty salsa bowls left on table when more salsa brought out.    5 for warm Simply Orange juice.   Great atmosphere  poor execution.
Trudys Del Mar,32,Was super excited when I heard that the iconic name of Trudy s was doing a seafood based restaurant  having been going to the TexMex restaurant since I moved here in the nineties.  But  I must say I ve never been so disappointed.  The food is very bland  even the lobster and the crevice.  There s way more flavor at Taco Bell for god s sake.  Also  if you want complimentary salsa and chips  which use to be one of the best things at Trudy s of old  make sure you have perky tits.  If your a fan of Trudy s of old avoid this place  especially for the price point.
Trudys Del Mar,33,We ate here shortly before it closed for renovations and let me tell you- We Will be back and are excited to see how it turned out.  The food is excellent  the waitstaff was also fantastic and the food was outstanding    Looking forward to the reopening.
Trudys Del Mar,34,We had a nice breakfast at Trudy s while in town for sxsw. More like weekday brunch. What a life. A 
Trudys Del Mar,35,South Congress cafe was better. Quest served in a giant dish and not good. Great location but over rated
Trudys Del Mar,36,Service was honestly really good. However  it s really disappointing to go to a new business that forces straws on you  ESPECIALLY not compostable. I had four plastic straws on the table. Come on people  this is 2022 and we re still using plastic straws   Food was okay  not great unfortunately. They were out of alot of items on the menu.
Trudys Del Mar,37,I live in the neighborhood  and Trudy s Del Mar is my new favorite  The margaritas are spot on - for those of local to Austin  we have a high bar for only the best margaritas  and Trudy s Del Mar does not disappoint.   The food is incredible. The tacos are the perfect size - small enough to order a few  and big enough to be satisfied. In my most recent visit  I ordered the crab cake taco and the shrimp tacos. The slaw  pineapple pico and avocado salsa on the tacos are the perfect trifecta to go with the delicious crab cake and shrimp.   All of the staff - the manager  the hostess and the waitstaff - were all super friendly and attentive. I can t wait to go back for more  Trudy s Del Mar has become one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood 
Trudys Del Mar,38,I find the name to be a bit deceiving. It s more of a TexMex spot with seafood peppered throughout the menu. Outside patio is definitely the spot to sit at on a nice day and love the great location on South Congress with proximity to shopping. Food came in large portions and was good.
Trudys Del Mar,39,This place is overpriced and the food is bland no flavor at all this place is not good it seems like they just heat up the food and put it on a plate   not much of options on the menu and the combination of food is off  deff not coming recommending this place.
Trudys Del Mar,40,Delicious  the service was great  and the amount of tequila they have is amazing  South Congress is a neat place to be located.
Trudys Del Mar,41,South Congress Cafe was one of my favorite brunch spots.  We decided to give this place a chance today for lunch.  I have to say it was pretty disappointing.  I used to order the short rib hash often on the SCC menu  so I went with the carnitas hash.  There was literally 4 bites of carnitas  1 inch squares of meat  and the rest was a bowl full of potatoes with the egg on top.  The flavor was good  but it was clear they were trying to maximize their profits.  Considering how cheap pork is  that was a bad move.  My spouse got the crab cakes.  These definitely had more filler and not as much flavor as the ones with SCC.  I think the owners of Trudy s are going to find out quickly it was a big mistake to replace SCC with this place.  Maybe their lunch dinner menu is better  but I will be finding a new brunch location.
Trudys Del Mar,42,Continuously amicable and productive staff in any event  when they become busy.  They truly invest wholeheartedly in their nourishment here and it appears. It s ideal to eat somewhere where they truly attempt to satisfy the client. We particularly like the inventive tastes on certain dishes  without getting strange. Can t express enough beneficial things  we love this spot 
Trudys Del Mar,43,This place was recommended by the host on a double-decker bus city tour. It is amazing  The salsa and black beans were the best my wife and I ever tasted in a Tex-Mex restaurant. I had the shrimp taco as well  and it was also amazing  I am passing on the recommendation.
Trudys Del Mar,44,We were fans of the South Congress Cafe. When it went away and was replaced by Trudy s we were curious about the restaurant that now occupies such an iconic location. We were not disappointed but in fact we re thrilled at this great place  It has maintained the feel of its predecessor but with pleasing updated aesthetics. You can sit at the bar or enjoy your meal at a table or booth. We chose the booth and enjoyed watching the flow on South Congress as we had drinks and looked over a menu that is quite unique in its range. I opted for the fresh catch Veracruz  love the saut ed spinach  while my wife chose the lobster tacos. The meal and service were fabulous  Normally we don t do desert but carrot cake French toast - are you kidding me  No way to resist that. Give this place a shot. You will be happy you did.
Trudys Del Mar,45,Great fish tacos  If you are craving a good Baja style fish taco in Austin  I would highly recommend Trudy s Del Mar. I have been craving a good fish taco and recently discovered Trudys. I have been twice this week and was in there today 3 10 to get my fish taco fix. I have tried the their posole and their crab cake taco  both of which I would get again. Now if you are craving something sweet they have a great carrot cake French toast. First time trying a carrot cake French toast and it came with a really tasty pecan topping. Great service at the bar with friendly staff and management.
Trudys Del Mar,46,We stopped by for some quick appetizers to hold us over till dinner and really liked the atmosphere  service and food.  We had the Shrimp Cocktail that was one of the best I ve ever had - the home made cocktail sauce is home made - it s the best.  We also had the ceviche that didn t disappoint.
Trudys Del Mar,47,Best fresh fish Veracruz I ve ever had  Nice Chardonnay which is tough to find on South Congress. My husband loved the crab tacos. We ll be back for sure 
Trudys Del Mar,48,omg get the french toast right now. run. it is so good. people love the migas too. mmmmmm
Trudys Del Mar,49,This is our go to spot in Austin.  It used to be South Congress Cafe...  The food is amazing and the Carrot Cake French Toast is to die for   
Trudys Del Mar,50,We really enjoyed this place.  The food was great  amp  so was the atmosphere.  The wait staff were very attentive.  We ll be back.
Trudys Del Mar,51,ordered blood orange ceviche  from menu. didn t come with blood orange pico sesame seeds or mints as printed on menu . came with mango pico topping on the seafood. Now iam wondering if the fish was mahi mahi.
Trudys Del Mar,52,Walked upon this place on South Congress. Stopped in for brunch. Not crowded  very friendly staff. The food was delicious. We had the carrot cake French toast and migas with a side of refied beans and well seasoned new potatoes. The food was delicious 
Trudys Del Mar,53,We miss the South Congress Cafe  Miss the old menu and the former vibe.  New owners  QUICK  Before you go out of business  Get the  Austin wierd hip cool vibe  back... Let your staff be cool again  Let them wear their own weather appropriate clothes and open the patio area as your centrepoint. Nobody can bear the heat to work out there  having to wear those stuffy long-sleeved shirts and jeans.  Patio is often closed because of this. Where are the dog owners going to go  with your patio closed  It s currently high happy hour on Thursday  and this place is EMPTY. Nobody wants to come in and relax at such a stuffy joint. Austin is supposed to be a hip  laid-back  foodie  place  especially on SoCo. You ve GOT to let the staff loose to express their personal charisma on the service floor. People will come in and WILL order your pricier menu items  if we dont feel so uncomfortable watching your sweltering  unhappy wait and bar staff dragging around in their stupid  corporate  uniforms.  South Congress is supposed to be more hip and cool and interesting. The menu here and the food is good-- It always was  used to be even better when it was the SCC  though .  Just lost its mojo with the change of owners.
Trudys Del Mar,54,Very tasty tacos and creamy guacamole. House marg on the rocks was good. Service very good.
Trudys Del Mar,55,Went for happy hour on the deck out back. Absolutely beautiful and the food is great    We will definitely go back to try more items on the menu
Trudys Del Mar,56,Great service and delicious food. Really appreciate our server taking care of us even tho she also had a large group. Patio is divine. Love this place
Trudys Del Mar,57,Fun upscale Mexican restaurant with hopping bar and lots of booths and tables. Great alcohol menu  with both draft and bottled beer. Food  tacos and sides  were excellent- very tasty. Server Kayleigh was outstanding. Highly recommended 
Trudys Del Mar,58,I really enjoyed my first experience eating at Trudy s Del Mar. Walking into the restaurant is so pleasant  the decor attractive and seating nicely arranged. The servers are very attentive. Best of all  the food is very good. I had a fish taco and crab taco - both very tasty. I d definitely return.
Trudys Del Mar,59,What a treat  As a guest of the old SoCo Cafe  Trudy s Del Mar has truly put a great new twist to an old favorite-not only in atmosphere  but also in taste and service. The space itself had definitely needed a facelift and that is what they delivered. It is much more inviting the moment you walk in. The bar is now fully open giving a very social and flowy feel between the main dining area and bar. The lighting created a soothing ambience and the new booth setup was extremely comfortable as well. We were welcomed by a nice hostess  a very personable and helpful server named Julie and two passionate and extremely friendly managers  May and Geoff  that shared how much they not only cared  but were excited about the new menu and space. The excitement showed in the flavor. Our drinks consisted of a cucumber jalapeno margarita  perfect balance of flavor  and a deliciously juicy fresh watermelon and strawberry frose with a tequila floater  great selection of tequila here . We begun our meal with the calamari and tuna ceviche. Breading flavor and sauce for calamari was spot on and the tuna ceviche was fresh and delightful. Our entrees consisted of the Del Mar Faijitas-epic conglomeration of steak  a lobster tail  sausage  and bacon wrapped jalapeno shrimp with even the beans and rice being a hit to compliment this cool Tex Mex Seafood twist. The Filet Oscar was cooked perfectly with nice chunks of crab and lay on a bed of seasoned to perfection fingerlings and spinach. Cherry on top-that carrot cake french toast dessert  Really nice to see a solid seafood option on SoCo  especially with such a nice spin to the old place. All in all  such an enjoyable experience. And YES-they still have all the best options of  SoCo Cafe  brunch with new  delicious additions  Go get ya some Texas  by the sea  twist in the heart of Austin y all  you won t be disappointed.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,1,We dropped by Angie s today and I realized this charming restaurant had become one of our favorites and yet we d never reviewed it.  Glancing through other reviews  we both found it surprising that anyone would claim the food is not authentic Mexican. Well it s actually not nor does it pretend to be. This place is authentic Tex Mex and even more accurately  East Austin Mex   That said   what could be more autentico than house made corn tortillas   Mmmm just the aroma calls up the ghosts of abuelas patting their morning fare into rounds.  What s not to love   Phil adores the chorizo which is not at all greasy  like so many  and is packed with more flavor than any we ve found in town.   My fav is the barbacoa which is pure cheek meat with very little fat. I venture that it is also the best in town.   The refried beans are textured and also full of flavor and the salsa always delicious  though it can be picante  so  watchale   as they say on the East side .   Another favorite go-to is the chicken soup  which is perfect for the  cool days ahead.  Oh and the margaritas are lovely and generous.   Sometimes the staff is busy and we know to be patient  but we ve never had an unpleasant encounter at Angie s. They work hard and give good service as a rule.  This is one of those lingering gems of local culture that cannot be replicated. We treasure these little corners full of character that carry the history of the area and serve darn good food in the process.  If a few persnickety wanna-be Austinites or impatient tourists are put off by a little clutter then I say great  they can stay away and that leaves more Angie s for us locals. Keep up the good work 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,2,If you re hungry for old school TexMex  Angie s is the place. A casual restaurant with a open and airy dining room.  The hot sauce and chips are complimentary  which is more and more rare these days. The service has always been friendly  the food is basic but tasty.  I am in love with their spicy hot sauce  and I don t think I ve ever had better corn tortillas.. It s making me hungry just thinking about it.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,3,Very disappointed when i went in today at and saw prices had almoSt doubled. I know prices have gone up but will find a place with cheaper puffy tacos
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,4,Some good basic TexMex. I haven t had Enchiladas in a long time. I always order chilaquiles or Migas    These were good and hit the spot. I was looking for the old La Tapatia and came here. Not a bad choice. I ll have to hit La Tapatia on another day.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,5,Excellent Tex-Mex that is still  old Austin  so enjoy it while it s still there and before someone tries to turn it into condo hell like the remaining landscape
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,6,Im really surprised by the low marks as Angie s has been consistently one of the better Tex-Mex spots. We ve been going here for quite sometime and have not had any issues with food or service. I recommend you check it out for yourself. We order everything from beef clad to enchiladas to puffy deep fried carnitas tacos  Breakfast tacos are on point as well.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,7,I was recommended Angie s Mexican Restaurant by my friend and they did not disappoint. The staff was so nice and the food was delicious. If you want some Tex-Mex  put Angie s on your list 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,8,Fast  friendly service in a clean space with a nice atmosphere. I had their migas plate and it was tasty.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,9,Please eat here  This place is amazing. It s a gem. It doesn t look like a popping place from the outside but the food is amazing. It feels like a family meal   Best carnitas tacos that I have had in Austin. The nachos plate was also amazing. And the frozen margaritas were excellent.  The chips and salsa hit the table within minutes of us sitting down and the chips were warm and fresh. I love this place
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,10,WTH  Why is Angie s not 5 star all the way  Well pay no mind to fools and get over here PRONTO   I will admit I hardly ever steer away from my absolute favorite plate here in Austin  the CARNITAS TACO PLATE but it s just that good   Crispy fried thick corn tortillas stuffed with succulent pork carnitas meat  lettuce  tomato and cheese with a side of rice and beans... it s worth EVERY penny  and worth the drive  I swear   And you gotta put Angie s hot sauce on everything   It s the best   I always get some with chips to go too. My family has been coming here ever since they were in the little pink house with constellations on the ceiling   Friends  who know  swore the menudo cures hangovers and they were right   Plus I just love the people here   Angie herself put tortilla chips on my birthday cake and lit them   Love it   Get over here fast   It ll become a favorite for you too   Promise 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,11,Good food. Take their word for it when they say something is spicy. It ll be volcanic. Try the Mexican martini.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,12,Love angies puffy tacos  This is a hidden gem  Lots of people think that you need to go to a fancy restaurant in order to get the best Mexican  but take it from a Mexican Food snob... this is the real thing 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,13,This place was awesome   Loved the greeting when we walked in   The god was nice n hot n VERY favorable  I say  this place u strongly recommend  I m glad I didn t listen to the negative reviews which I don t know why that was there  but if you love homie food made with love god if you place
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,14,Great hidden gem without all the trendy fluff   I highly recommend you stopping in..my husband and I wanted a snack so we shared the nachos. I had the house margarita and my husband had the Mexican Martini  So yummy   Mexican martini comes with olives and a shaker - you get 4 delicious martinis from the shaker- definitely well worth it    Be sure to ask for Anna - she was the sweetest  She made a few recommendations as far as the menu was concerned  carnita puffy tacos  and suggested a few places for us to visit  while visiting ATX for the night. You won t be disappointed 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,15,BEST SALSA IN AUSTIN. I know that s a bold statement. I could drink that stuff. Chunky. Spicy. So good.  Used to order takeout all the time before I moved away. Enchilada plate was my goto  Miss it 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,16,Probably the worst Mexican you can have in Austin. I came in on Cinco de mayo and was confused why it was so empty. The reason for that is the quality of the food. Everything we got we all agreed was not good. My boyfriend took one bite of his tacos and said they tasted like chlorine water. Unfortunately  neither of us ended up finishing any of the food. I would like to give credit to the workers though  they seemed very understaffed but continued to work hard and were very kind.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,17,Best enchiladas  I love how the chicken is so tender it s so easy to cut in pieces and the taste overall is amazing 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,18,We make Angie s our  Thursday family night she always takes care of us and we enjoy her service
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,19,We stumbled upon Angie s on a Friday night and had the BEST time  Angie came to our table from the kitchen and whipped us up some BEAUTIFUL Mexican martinis and steak fajita plates  so flavorful     I m definitely coming back here all the time
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,20,The owner overcharged us without an itemized bill  when we disputed she was making up numbers and made us feel like we were questioning her integrity of which she has none at all. Taking advantage of clients in the worst that you can do if you want to  keep your business running. WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK TO THAT PLACE      Besides her food IS NOT Mexican at all  and it is greasy and plain
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,21,I had the enchiladas and they were so good  My so got the tacos and enchiladas and he loved them as well  In sum  great food  service  and environment. Next time I m in Austin I will be stopping by again.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,22,I bumped into this restaurant while looking for another  and it was a nice surprise. The establishment itself is not very fancy  but the food was of excellent quality and had a homemade feel to it.  Service was quick to recognize that I was not a local and they gave me recommendations.  I had the frozen lemonade and it was refreshing and just the right amount of sweetness. The  migas deluxe  breakfast was filling and not heavy. Aside from the melted cheese on the tortilla chips  but I guess that s just a personal preference. Later  I ordered an order of  chicken flautas  to go.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,23,We were looking for something to eat  and everything was closed. This is the only place that was open  We walked in they were very friendly  we ordered way too much food and it was really good.  Recommend  From Fort Worth 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,24,Food is solid but not spectacular.   But prices are reasonable  staff is very friendly and attentive  and margaritas are good.   Will go back.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,25,Read this like a 2.5 star review.  We had a top shelf margarita and a couple of puffy tacos.  The margarita was ok  was a sufficient pour  however it was very pricey   10  especially for a place like this.  I was not a fan of the tortilla chips and the salsa although spicy was nothing to write home about.  The carnitas and beef tacos were more of a street taco size  but for  3 they were pretty good  but the soft corn tortilla shell was a little on the greasy side.  This was a one and done place for us.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,26,I was so excited to visit Angie s restaurant with the bachelorette party I was here with from Houston. We confirmed that they were open and their closing time was 9 30. We arrived at Angie s parking lot at 8 40 and walked to the doors only to be told they were closing early and had the doors locked in our faces     So thanks for that Angie s Mexican Restaurant but I would say next time when someone calls you at 8 30 and you decided your closing early maybe you could just say that when people call.  notcool
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,27,If I could give this restraunt a 10  I would. We got reccomended this by a local. Let me tell you  EVERYTHING was authentic. Like they probably even made the water themselves   It was the most delicious and filling Mexican food I ve ever had in my LIFETIME   The staff was so friendly and kind to us. Inexpensive  Vegetarian Options. This restaurant should be WORLD FAMOUS. Stephanie is super sweet   
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,28,Probably the worst food i ve ever had at such a high price. Everything was very bland and flavorless. Won t be going back.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,29,LUNCH REVIEW   Lunch time again on the East side brought me to this place and I have to say the Jesus statue  on the way in was interesting.  This place isn t anything fancy by any stretch of the word but  the service is 5 stars.  They were quick with refills  happily split our check and were quick to process payments.  Also  they have parking in front and in the back of the restaurant.  Yes  1. The chips and salsa   Chips were fresh  lightly salted and were refilled before you ran out.  The salsa was a mix between a green and a red and packed some heat in the after taste. 2. Queso with ground beef and guacamole   I tried the cheese without mixing it and it was pretty Velveeta tasting so  get one that has something else mixed in.  The meat was dried off and didn t make it runny and the guacamole was perfect.  Maybe  1.  The 3 soft tacos   The beef was good and well seasoned but  after one of the soft corn shells I couldn t eat any more.  The presentation was pretty awful  way too much lettuce and not enough cheese.  Packed full of meat though so  not bad for the price.  No  1.  The flavor of the beans was off for me and I would just skip ordering them. 2.  I would also skip the rice  flavorless  mooshy and didn t add anything to the experience.  As a side note  be careful when you lock the bathroom stall doors in the ladies room because I couldn t get it to lock and then I almost had to call my friend because I couldn t get it to open.  Imagine getting that call   hey I am stuck in the bathroom stall can you send help    Always an adventure with me I guess.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,30,Wow. I ordered a taco salad and it came on a plate without a shell. Just lettuce ground beef and cheese. Seriously I had to order a side of guacamole and a side of sour cream. I have come here for breakfast and was pleased. But the taco salad is a 9 dollar plate of lettuce  ground beef  and cheese. Waste of money .
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,31,If your in the Austin area and are in the mood for Mexican food  definitely DO NOT go here  Only because I had a rough night at the bars  I was able to force this food down. Service was great but food sucked. I had the Deluxe combo  2 enchiladas  chalupa and tostada. My lady and my Mother had the Manudo. Neither of them got through not even half the bowl. The tripe wasn t cleaned properly  lots of fat left on it and made it hard to chew. Was very oily and didnt have good flavor. Tortillas were not good either the corn nor the flour. My chicken enchiladas were bland. Chicken was tender but no flavor. Rich was kinda mushy also no flavor. The 2-star rating given was for the service and salsa. it was good..if not for that it would have been a 1 only because I couldn t do NO stars.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,32,This is one of the last old school Tex mex places in East Austin  The frozen lemonade is different and amazing and a simple cheese enchilada dinner is all you need. Don t pay 50 bucks for atmosphere. Come here. It s better and the people are nice and live down the street 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,33,Lunch in August 2019 was a happy surprise. Have been here before  and the Huevos Rancheros then were good.  This time  the Lunch Vodka Martini filled 3 full glasses of a full size martini glass  from the shaker she left at the table  next time I will need an Uber.  It was delicious.  The Chili Relleno was also delicious  I make them at home  and know a great one when I taste it.   Going back soon.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,34,It was New Year s Day  everywhere was either closed or packed.  But that turned out to be lucky for us  we drove buy and saw an  open  sign with an empty parking lot so we whipped a U-turn and decided to have lunch.  This is now my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  Super friendly  great  fast service.  The food is just better than the other Mexican restaurants in Austin  at a better price point.  I ll be here weekly from now on 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,35,Best damn Tex Mex around  Love this place and Angie. Great food  service and cold beer  if you don t like this place go back to where you came from  This is how you do it baby.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,36,Hungry and tired after spending some time kayaking we decided to give this place a shot. First impression  looks a little older and it is not as big as it looks from the outside. The salsa they served with the chips was spot on   Homemade chunky and spicy salsa. The chips were pretty bad  most were all small pieces and tasted a little like stale tostito chips. I ordered a carnitas plate with homemade corn tortillas. Soooo good  the carnitas tasted just like when I go visit family in Mexico. The corn tortillas made everything that much better. I want to go back just for that plate and salsa.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,37,I m giving this place three stars for coming up with the original and strong cocktail  The Mexican Martini    The food is just ok  with just not the greatest atmosphere  but for some reason the strong cocktails keep me coming back.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,38,Angie s. Austin  Tx. legacy. Skip it if you are actually hungry  or like value for the dollar. Including a picture of a  2.50 breakfast taco. Salt packet included for scale.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,39,Very small portions of Americanized Mexican food. Also we were charged different prices than they had listed on the menu  and when we got our un-itemized bill we were told  prices are going up .  My family all got the same thing  a two taco and enchilada combo plate  they finished eating their tacos by the time my food even came out  so that left them waiting for me to finish. Flavored  margaritas are 4.50 for a reason  they are just flavored syrup and blended ice.. I tasted no tequilla at all  So when we confronted the owner Angie about prices not comparing to what was listed on the menu she not only was the one who told us that they were going but  but also nonchalantly and sarcastically said  what do you want me to do about it  and  well don t come back then .. don t worry Angie  we won t be back  it s a shame for you because we live around the corner and I work at a bar on 6th street where I recommend ALOT of out of towners where to go.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,40,Always enjoy the tacos here. Nice Friendly staff. Family has been coming here for years.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,41,Angie s Mexican Restaurant is in my top 10 Mexican restaurants in Austin. My favorite is the Mexican plate with two cheese enchiladas  one crispy taco  rice and beans. You have to get their corn tortillas. They are house made and very fresh. I haven t found anyone to top  them. Enjoy  
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,42,Great vegetarian selection  I would highly recommend this place if your coming to Austin  Their chips and salsa were so good as well 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,43,One of my favorite places to go. I have never been disappointed. From food to great service  always consistently amazing
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,44,Their Tacos and enchiladas are the best thing ever  I prefer the cheese enchiladas because they are my favorite. I would really prefer for anyone who loves Mexican food to go there.  
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,45,If I could give this 0 stars I would. One of the absolute worst Mexican Restaurants you could eat at here in Austin. My daughter and I ate here last week and were very tired from packing and moving her out of her apt.. We stopped in to hopefully have a good meal and it was far from it. The puffy tacos were hard as a rock. The beans were swimming in liquid of some kind. I believe they were trying to stretch their food out by making it so watery.  Everything had a weird after taste like chlorine or something weird. Very strange. I have no idea how this place is still open.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,46,No frills Mexican food. But damn tasty   The salsa is usually delightfully spicy and the tacos are a treat.   Stop by the next time your in the East side.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,47,Ended up stumbling on this place after the restaurant I wanted to go to was closed and I was pretty impressed. Great and quick service  Everyone there was so nice and food came out super quick. Their margaritas are a good size and just potent enough.   Their food was so good. I had their migas plate... So yummy  They have homemade corn tortillas and even make puffy tacos out of the corn tortillas  Will definitely eat here again 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,48,Bring your friends  bring your family. Breakfast  lunch  dinner    Angie s is a little east side treasure.  home cooked Mexican. Home made tortillas.  Everything.  I love it.  I m almost hesitant to post about it for fear you will all love it and it will become big and change.  I ve come more than 1 time to be sure before I posted and I will definitely be back again and again.  The ladies here are so sweet as well. If you are looking for a relaxed atmosphere and a wonderful home cooked Mexican meal look no further.  I personally did not have any margaritas but my husband did and he said they were good.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,49,This is the food of miracles. The corn tortillas are some magical fusion and when slathered in Tex-Mex chili gravy and molten cheese  it is transcendent. This transplanted Texan now in New England considers this trip my return to the Holy Land.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,50,I really love this place  The beans taste like my grandma s beans and you can tell they are homemade. My husband had the chicken enchiladas and said they were very good. The hot sauce was great and so this place over all is freakin delish.   They do have a vegetarian part to their menu  and so their beans are completely vegan. The tortillas are made from stratch and they even fry their own tostada shells. The customer service was great and the location on the East side is good too. The parking is small  but good. I wish they made tamales for the holidays  but they don t.   I would eat here way more often if I lived closer  but I live in Southwest Austin and so this is a little drive for me. But i plan to back once on that side of town. Oh yeah  With my tostada plate  large quac  enchilada plate and 2 teas  our ticket with tip was about  30 bucks... Not bad at all..
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,51,Tourist trap rip off.  Food bland. Drastically over inflated prices for extras you re not made aware of.  No itemized bill to dispute.  Our  60 bill became  90. How   Angie makes up numbers.  When we complained she said  Don t come back then.    Don t worry  we won t. They re sneaky  greedy and rude.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,52,BLEH   The food is absolutely standard  generic Tex-Mex  but the service is where this place really stands out. The take being slow  rude  and not caring to whole new levels  It s actually kind of impressive. If you want things to take a really long time  to be forgotten about and ignored  then this is the place for you 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,53,Best food I have ever eaten in Austin  Great service  margaritas  Mexican martinis  and carnitas tacos  I will be back soon and also great prices  Yum yum yum 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,54,Fast  friendly and most importantly DELICIOUS   We came in from San Antonio a little leery about where to get good Mexican food in austin and we hit the jackpot. Corn tortillas are handmade. You won t go wrong choosing this place 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,55,2.75 stars.  Came in at 2pm Sunday.  There were only about 5 tables sat  of which 4 had already been fed. So arguably we were the only ones to be waited on at the time.  The servers were very busy with side work as they close at 4pm and didn t make us feel special. Service was given and drinks delivered.   Drinks were average. Queso was ordered and tasted like pure Velveeta.  That s when we decided to call it a day.   Overall....I m sure it s good for parties and kids...and I can t vouch for the food other than queso but we won t be back here.   I
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,56,This is the best Mexican restaurant in town. My girlfriend and I are regulars  and whenever we bring friends  they love it too. The waitresses may seem a bit short at first  but once you go a few times  they always remember you and are super friendly. The best margaritas in Austin cheap too  best tortillas  tacos  everything  This is a wonderful place that I highly suggest. Enjoy   - 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,57,Big disappointment. I had the Mexican plate  a taco  2 enchiladas  rice and beans. A decent price. The taco was good  but the enchiladas were the worst  soggy tortillas and covered in thick layer of velveeta or American cheese. My husband had the caldo de res. It was  10.95  pricey  because the bowl was tiny which also made it difficult to cut all the vegetables they should have cut  but instead give you a 4 in piece of zucchini. And the broth was lacking flavor. First and last visit.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,58,Great  great little place just a few blocks away from I-35 on east 7th. The restaurant now us much larger then when it used to be in a small house closer to I-35 that now hold cork  amp  co.  Angie s is one of the better Tex-Mex spots near downtown. The Mexican plate is incredible  but I do always confuse it with the platillo especial so just watch out when you order. They are so very similar. One has two enchiladas  amp  one taco and the other has two enchiladas  amp  one taco. But honestly  you can t go wrong with either one. Both are also served with rice  beans  and tortillas.  The tacos are special because they are puffy tacos. That are not greasy at all  just beautifully soft   yet still a little crispy  blankets of happiness.   I also love their fresh made salsa. It s extra spicy  amp  definitely will leave a year in your eye...in a good way   
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,59,Best cheese enchiladas in town. Amazing homemade corn tortillas as well. Average of three stars on yelp is way under rating mamma Angie s capabilities  
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,60,I ll start off with a warning. Their salsa is made with Serrano peppers and Jalepenos. It has a very fresh taste and typically I enjoy a little spice. But this was way too spicy for my liking. I was unaware of how hot the salsa would be because I feel like it s customary most restaurants present mild salsa and when I went to go say something about it to my waitress she laughed and already knew that I was about to say it was too hot. Again  fresh taste but those seeds had me choked up. I ordered the queso as a replacement and it looks and tastes just like velveeta... By far the most unpleasant experience at a tex-mex restaurant I ve had in the 8 months of living in Austin.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,61,I have been to Angie s a number of years ago at their previous location  where Uncorked is now at 7th and 35   but hadn t been since they moved down the road.  I ve been stuck on Joe s Bakery.  We gave Angie s a try and were not disappointed. I knew the best thing they had going was the corn tortillas  so I got the carne guisada.  Holy smokes it was good.  The salsa was HHHHHOOOOOTT and we literally drank it up.  The carne guisada was not overbearing with flavor and there was no gristle in the meat as can often be the case at some restaurants.  We washed it all down with a stack of those thick  wonderful corn tortillas.  The other thing that blew my mind was the refried beans.  Terrific flavor. They were fairly full for lunch  but there was still plenty seating.  There is a garage evidently behind the building.  Their lot on 7th was tight. Angie s just got back in the rotation.  Can t wait to go again.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,62,The best authentic Tex-Mex in Austin   I have been going to this place since it was in the yellow then green house on 7th street and I-35.  Family run and great service.  The queso is awesome and is made with several different cheeses  not Velveeta like some other review guessed .  Add some ground beef for a wonderful dip.  Chorizo Flameado is really good too   While the  soft  tacos have a slight singed crunch to them  which I love  the meat could use slightly more seasoning  but they are still delicious    The crown jewel of this restaurant are the cheese enchiladas   They are to die for   Tons of cheese both inside and out.  And the carne sauce tastes like it is straight from the Valley  Be sure to get onions on them.   I also really enjoy the thick  house made corn tortillas.  Very good to make a rice and bean burrito with.  Finally  be sure you try the lemonade  it has an almost slushy texture to it and is delightful     P.S. If the front parking lot is full  there are a few spaces underneath the restaurant in the back.  Also a nice place to park if it is raining.  The staircase comes right up by the restrooms.  P.S.S.  Be sure to check out the bagel on the counter when you check out.    
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,63,In general  the food at Angie s is ok  but not spectacular. The one exception is their migas. I don t know why  but they are about the best in town. I m completely addicted and go there at least once a week for them. Perfect blend of eggs  chips  cheese... And their corn tortillas are awesome.   Five start migas.... Three star for the rest of the food.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,64,I really thought this place would be better. Mind you  I haven t tried their food. So why would I write a reviews    With great anticipation I went in one day during lunch and found a table with 2 other friends. We sat there completely ignore for five minutes until a rushed busboy brought us chips.   10 minutes later  a waiter came trying to take our order  and we politely asked if we could see a menu  it was our first time. The waiter brought our menu and drinks and left. We waited there for 20 minutes with no service  waiters just running around with no real coordination.   Eventually we just gave up and walked out. This place was a mess  DO NOT GO. Their food might be good  I didn t get the chance to try it  but first impressions are very important to me  and Angie s  you failed.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,65,Pretty disappointing  honestly.  Tried this place out on a Saturday morning  as the other place we were headed to had too long of a wait.  No wait at Angie s...should have been a sign  I suppose.  I thought the food was fairly decent  but it blew me away that I spent about  20 on migas plate and split a small queso.  We are on the east side people   I expect amazing  greasy Tex-Mex for cheap.  Their only saving grace  for me  were the thick and delicious corn tortillas.  The service was slow  but friendly.  I hate to give a low star review  but with so many other options out there  this one doesn t make my list.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,66,A hidden Austin gem.  Friendly service  great food at great prices. There are bigger names in Austin  but you really get your money s worth at Angie s
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,67,Great smiling service   Love their chips and spicy slow burn salsa.  Enjoyed finding a place where we could get in without a wait on a cold damp Saturday.  I ordered the migas  and they are heavy on tortillas. I m not saying that s a bad thing  but it s a thing you might want to know. Potatoes need work  not crispy   beans just average.  If you re looking for Machaca a la El Paso  as the BF was   the Machacado plate at Angie s does not resemble that dish at all. Which isn t to say that he did not eat it. He did.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,68,Happy Labor Day Breakfast at Angies. .huevos rancheros w a side of carnitas and Ranchero deluxe. .warm tortillas corn and flour. .and Angie..great day.. won t have to eat until tonight. .ronilou..on 7th street..and won t have to see mom until next week..
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,69,Avg mexican food. nothing to really write home about.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,70,I love you  Angie  even if you are a little grouchy      Went to Angie s for the first  and second   time this week when we had work meetings in the neighborhood. Yes  two days in a row. Don t judge   The salsa is great. Spicy   The flour tortillas are yummy. The vegetarian  i.e. cheese  enchiladas are fantastic     For you non-vegetarians  the standard cheese enchiladas have a meat sauce.  Add onions on top and it takes the meal to another level. A friend had the chicken enchiladas and says those are awesome as well.  Good beans  good rice  good deal.   It gets super busy at lunchtime  but you won t be disappointed. In fact  I wish I was at Angie s right now.   P.S.  Angie s only gets 4 stars b c of the parking. There s a lot  but it s tiny  and during lunch you might have to park a ways away and hike a little.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,71,The food is okay  but not great. But  the older lady in jeans  wearing glasses with the long blonde pony tail  is very rude. Came to my table  while I was listening to a conference call  on my phone and started loudly asking me questions. I already had my food and was halfway through my meal. Tried to tell her  I was on the phone and she just kept talking. Then she brought me a bowl of onions    Then when she noticed I was upset  she kept forcefully asking me  was everything alright   Very intimidating. The chips are always stale and the salsa is too hot and has no flavor. I just go there  because it s quick. I have been eating at Eastside Mexican restaurants in Austin for over 35 years  I consider myself well informed on the restaurant situation. This place is okay  but nothing to brag about.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,72,Love Angie s. The carnitas  taco plate is the absolute greatest in Tex Mex. THick homemade corn tortillas fried soft. Great carnitas. Yellow cheese and iceberg lettuce. Tomatoes I suppose. Great salsa. Real chips like actually fried onsite. Old timey vibe. Pay at the register. TV for sports. Yeah 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,73,This is as close to my husband s Abuelita s  cooking.  God rest her soul  so we were very excited to find this gem. As soon as you walk in  you smell the fresh corn tortillas  Breakfast was excellent  from the carne guisada tacos  bacon egg and cheese tacos and the huevos Mexicana. We even ordered a dozen corn tortillas to go. We look forward to trying out the lunch dinner menu
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,74,Been eating at Angies taco place for over 10 years.  Extremely delicious tasting tacos. Home made corn tortillas. Angie usually will wait on you and greet you.  Great staple of Austin Texas 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,75,Worst tacos ever.  My family has had a few restaurants and I ve worked in many  so I m a harsh critic  but realistic.  It is not acceptable to serve Migas tacos with hardly any egg or veggies in the first taco then only greasy fried chips in the second  charge more than star bucks for a small watery coffee then give me attitude when I politely explain why I would like a refund.  I wish I still had the picture I took of those tacos  had to see it to believe it.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,76,I really enjoyed Angie s. It s tough to find decent Mexican Tex-Mex food for a vegetarian. You d think veggie fajitas are a norm but not every place has  em. Here I was able to get bean tacos. They do a delicious puffy style tortilla  fresh toppings and vegetarian beans and rice. Score  Their mexican martinis are more than I d like to spend   11.25  but boy they had me buzzin . Only thing I wish they did differently is offer another veggie side. Every plate comes with rice and beans but when you order a bean taco plate  yeah... that s a lot of beans. Nopales would be a great option  All in all  It s a great laid back atmosphere  good food and large plates. Breakfast all day - on the cheap  too 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,77,I ve rediscovered Angie s once again. I am happy to see that they have grown from their humble but delicious beginnings on IH-35. I remember going there on Wednesdays for their  Costilla Special . On my recent trip for SXSW I saw this beautiful burt orange building with the name Angie s stamped on the facade. I asked if it was the same that I remembered on IH-35. After an affirmative answer I had to go in and order my usual. Oh my god . It was huge. I cant believe I was able to eat the whole plate when I was younger. Well it was delicious but I had to take a doggy bag.  I would ve given it a 5 Strs but one of the young waitress had a little bit of attitude. I hope next time I go she id off.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,78,Incredible food. Very authentic. The carnitas taco are simply the best I ve ever had. Hands down. I m not a rice and beans person so I opted not to get them. That was a mistake. I tasted my partners and they too did not disappoint.  Not sure why this place only has 3 stars. We had an incredible lunch experience  fast service and excellent food.   We will be back.   Note  the margaritas could have more zip to them. But I m a lush 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,79,Great place for lunch.   They have a vegetarian menu with several options.    Prices are great and the staff is friendly.   The vegetarian enchiladas were great and the corn tortillas are amazing.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,80,Angie s is okay... probably a 2.5 stars overall.  It sort of reminded me of fast food served on real plates.  However  the decor of the restaurant is pretty good... with a nice patio set up and a nice entry way.  This is what led me  and probably most patrons  to try Angie s.  We went Friday at 7pm... most places are packed at that time  but Angie s was relatively uncrowded  which isn t usually a good sign.     The food that I had was okay... nothing bad  nothing good.  Again to emphasize  I d compare it to fast food Mexican cuisine. It wasn t bad  it just didn t seem like restaurant grade food  was smaller  lackluster portions  and definitely didn t live up to the atmosphere of the physical location  especially being in the East side  known for good Mexican food .  Even the salsa and chips seemed to be lacking something.  I d highly recommend Angie s try some new recipes  especially since it has so many other pieces in place that would work in its favor.    We ended up leaving after about 45 minutes... which for me and my group on a Friday night is unheard of.  Typically we will stick around an hour after we finish eating for more drinks  dessert  but the energy wasn t there  and the night was young.. .so we made our way to Silo  which brings me to the other pro... the location is surrounded by some nice bars.    If you just want to check out the patio and have a Pacifico  give it a try.  But for more flavorful food  there are many options all around Austin.  For more energy  go to Baby A or Chuy s.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,81,Bland.  It s like they re not even trying. The nacho cheese  queso   tasted like melted American cheese.  Seriously.  We had a whole table of people and no one even wanted to finish bowl of it  which usually never happens.  The rest of the food is just as bland and uninteresting  see the photos here  it tastes like it looks .    If you re going to run a restaurant  at least try to have some creative dishes.  Or at least try to make the generic tex-mex flavorful  charred peppers  cilantro  pickled veggies  mole sauce  a selection of types of salsas .  Seriously  it s not that hard.  They re just not even trying to make it good.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,82,Waited for 15 mins to be seated when tables were open  salsa is gross and has no spice to it. They don t have sweet tea but instead will give you bland black tea with pink sweet and low...     Not only that but the place was extremely dirty  customer service wasn t anywhere near friendly... you can t say a Mexican restaurant is good if the chips and salsa aren t even good   We paid for the drinks and went somewhere else thankfully 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,83,The food is great  but the service was terrible. We weren t sure who our waiter actually was because so many people came to our table. It took 15 minutes to even get a drink order and longer to actually get the drinks. The food was very tasty  but I won t be returning due to the lack of service we received.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,84,Good and bad. I have eaten here many times over the last 10 years. I think tonight was my last visit. I am pretty sure lady at the front who runs the place always  pads  the bill. They don t print you an itemized receipt normally and the last 3 or so times I walked out of there I was wondering why the it always seemed a little bit more expensive than I expected. I d look at a to go menu on the way out and see they added in another 20  or so...a couple dollars usually. I eat there by myself so it shouldn t be auto gratuity.   The salsa is excellent  the refried beans are great. Rice is kinda dry and just OK. The corn tortillas are home made  but not really my favorite. They are small  thick  dark and kind of bland. They really fill you up while being bland. Their chicken is bland and so is their beef.  I like their cheese enchiladas...and their home made lemonade. Service is a little slow if they get busy. One girl that works there is really cool...but she wasn t there tonight.  I just think it s shady they are padding the bill and not cool. I like the food but I have had way better...sums it up.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,85,Delicious food. I ordered the chicken soup which was so yummy. The guacamole was delicious and the chorizo tacos were awesome. I would come again if I had the chance. Service was great and friendly and the place was clean and cute.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,86,Great salsa and corn tortillas. Very friendly staff. Needs some flavor in the chili con carne sauce.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,87,This place sucks. The staff is friendly but the service is so slow it makes you wish you went somewhere else. I would say that you get what you pay for but it s not even that cheap.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,88,Close to downtown is a plus for this place. Today I  accidentally  found Angie s again while looking for another place down the street. I remember Angie s when it was in the run down 1940 s house on the other side of 7th street. Mismatched tables and chairs I don t care much about  they add charm and character  I do however care about the food. It s cozy  topped with cheese and they serve breakfast ALL day. The food was as good as I remember and we ll be back for sure. Hot sauce most anglos would shy away from....MUY CALENTE. Had to come back to the office and grab my blankie to take a nap.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,89,Came here during lunch and the parking lot was very busy and I couldn t find a spot. The food wasn t the best but it was decent. Our server though wasn t that good. We had to ask her to refill our waters and she didn t ask us how are food was. There are better places to eat Mexican food in Austin.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,90,I m not really such a fan of corn tortillas  but  after reading the reviews on Yelp  I HAD to try them when I met some former coworkers here for lunch.  Damn  the homemade corn tortillas are FABULOUS   They re thick and perfect for supporting the greasy goodness that is placed inside of them.  I opted for huevos rancheros  my new  thing  as of late.  The over easy eggs were perfectly prepared and runny  although there was no ranchero sauce as an accompaniment.  It was brought to me on the side when I inquired about it.  The flour tortillas were pretty tasty as well  but I just had to try the corn.  Portions are average for what you pay  my potatoes and refried beans hit the spot  too.  Service was kind of slow  we were the only table outside  and I think they only let us sit outside because two in our party are regulars.  We had to seek out the person to get our check  but by this time the parking lot was full  so I understand the business.  This is a nice location  I d never been to the old one  I just emailed Yelp to change the address... after driving around and around looking for the one on here .  There s plenty of spacious parking spots and room to turn around.  Didn t really take in the interior  we headed straight outside.  The patio is nice and the perfect place for my former coworker s 2 year old to run around happily.  I ll be back sometime.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,91,I m going back on my original review. After rereading it  I can t believe those words came out of my mouth - they must ve been having a darn good day on my first visit.   Now  let me preface - I ve only ever had breakfast tacos here. My favorite are potato  egg and cheese. Except half the time  they decide not to make potatoes or are  out  by dinner time.   Also  since we work nearby  we re pretty darn good customers - or used to be. Half the time they ll let us split our bill  half the time we can t. Half the time it s OK to charge less than  5 on a credit card  other times it s not. Depends on the day.   And finally - why the heck is there a fake cockroach hiding under a donut by the register  I ve gotten some laughs and screams outta people  but c mon - that s pretty disgusting.   Sorry Angie s - with all these wonderful trailers and restaurants going up nearby  I won t be back anytime soon.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,92,I went here on a Sunday Morning  because the place recommended to me was very crowded.  On first appearance I thought  it might be good.  From the outside it is a newer building with a nice parking lot. I was seated quickly  and placed my order  the waiter was rude and not helpful in the least.  I had to ask for Salsa  and it wasn t very good.  and the two tacos i ordered were just ok..  the beans had no flavor.  The plates looked as if the food was just thrown on there.    Upon closer inspection   the place is dirty  from the walls  floors  etc. Even a new customer asked if they had any wipes to clean off the high chair for their child.  Outside the planters were empty except for the cigarette butts.  I would PASS on by this place.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,93,Angie seems a bit grouchy and service was slow during brunch this Sunday. But the food makes up for it.   Signature dishes include carnitas  which are really the best anywhere  and machacado  which makes a perfect breakfast taco when combined with eggs and served on one of Angie s famous super-thick corn tortillas.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,94,Love the incredible hospitality at this restaurant  When making a decision if I should make my reservations here for my graduation celebration  the owner and head waiter convinced me with their excellent customer service and great business nagosiations. Not only did they let us sample their great puffy  tacos for free  they also agreed to accommodate us by splitting the check by family which they don t do for large groups. This made it super convenient for all 20 of us. How awesome is that        chicken and beef steak tacos were yummy  definitely what they are known for. Chicken enchiladas were also great. Oh man  and their tortilla chips were an awesome blend of super thin and crispy accompanied by some really hot salsa. Everything is moderately priced as well   The restaurant was also very spacious and incredibly clean. Don t get me wrong  I love the little hole in the wall run down Mexican restaurants just as much as the next person  but sometimes I question the sanitary level of the environment.   Have no fear  you ll find parking here. There are even more spaces behind the building kind of near the alley.   Consider this place for your next affordable shindig.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,95,The 2 star description really fits how I feel about this restaurant.  Meh. I ve experienced better.   Right off the bat  it takes 10 minutes just to put some chips and salsa on our table. The salsa was actually pretty good and spicy  but the chips were stale ... gross.  They got the food out pretty quick and it was nothing stellar. I ordered migas and they came with a side of potatoes and refried beans. I think rice would have been a lot better than potatoes. They were seriously just huge chunks of papas with no seasoning or flavor or anything.   MEH.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,96,There are definitely some people out there who are die-hard fans of Angie s. It s been around for ages and offers up standard Tex-Mex as well as Mexican classics.  I m not a fan of barbacoa  yet...give me time  but they seem to be known for it. Overall  I found the food to be just average orange with requisite grease pools on a plate.   Not bad by any means  but not a place I d ever choose on my own volition.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,97,Contrary to popular yelping  Angie s is not all that and a bag of tostada chips.  I got a Mexican Plate which included two  cheese  enchiladas and a taco.  I was excited about the taco because people were raving about the homemade corn tortillas.  They were homemade alright  because commercially made tortillas could never get away with being so bad.  They were thick and gummy  the taco was chewy and bland.  I had to add salt and pepper and salsa to make it edible.  I can t think of a time that I ve EVER added salt and pepper to a meal at a Tex Mex restaurant.  So that s something.  Also  the American cheese on the tacos was an  interesting  culinary choice.  The enchiladas offered no redemption.  They used a different type of corn tortilla for the enchiladas than for the taco or the ones served on the side.  These were clearly commercially made.  But they were okay.  I couldn t find any cheese stuffed into said tortillas  though  until my friend had to point out the tiny layer of  again  American cheese.  Gross   At least the canned enchilada sauce was good.  Wait...no it wasn t   Silly me.  So disappointed.  I didn t even bother with the rice and beans.  Oh  also  both baskets of chips we were served were almost all crumbs.  The salsa was okay...kindof bland and pretty spicy.  So be careful.  In fact  optimum care would involve not stopping by Angie s.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,98,I should ve trusted Yelp. I say that so many times  yet I continue to go to places with poor reviews   I ordered the chicken enchiladas-- I figured you can t go wrong with that. They re pretty standard fare. Well  the cheese on top tasted like the thick grated dollar store brand cheese  the dark meat chicken grossed me out  though the sauce on top was okay. Big enchiladas  small portions of rice and beans... and I think  8.50 was a lot much for a lunch price. I would ve preferred they do 2 enchiladas and take a couple bucks off.  I won t be back.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,99,Oh god  I dream about their beef tacos on those thick  yet crisp corn tortillas. The salsa is hotter than hell  but perfect.  Angie s  you magnificent bastards  I love you.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,100,I agree with several reviewers  when there are over 400 Mexican restaurants and  food trailers to choose from  why would you go here a second time. A friend who works in the area is a regular here. We had lunch on Saturday at his recommendation. My daughter and I  shared the veggie combo plate   8.75 for 2 bean tacos and 1 cheese enchilada with about an ounce each of rice and refried beans . Husband had one dried beef and egg taco and one chorizo and egg taco  with added cheese and jalapenos   5.80 no sides . We spent  14 on two mango margaritas at the suggestion of our waiter and ordered a small queso   3.50  to share while we waited for our food.   We noticed after about 20 minutes a couple being served queso within a few minutes of being seated at their table. Our queso came out with our food about 5 minutes after.  The house made chips are greasy and yummy with the spicy salsa. The rest of the food including the chalky  raw flour  queso was marginal at best. If you enjoy processed american cheese in your TexMex  I do  that s why its TexMex  then try this place once. If you find you ve been overcharged a buck or two  which also sounds common from other reviewers  then I d pass on a second visit--Angie is obviously doing whatever is necessary to pay the mortgage on her building.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,101,I ll keep it simple         Long Gotten over the Homey Feel that Old Angies had on the height of 7th and Frontage 35 where that Wine Tasting place is now.                 Best Flautas in Town.    The ones that need to be beaten.                Carnitas tacos are great too.                  Awesome Lemonade  
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,102,I remember the old Angie s and the drama that would usually ensue during any given lunch time visit. I know the new Angie s is not really all that new anymore but I had never been there.  First of all  this ambiance has 0 feel of a Mexican restaurant. It s way too big to go for the tiling and some paintings route. It felt like a cafeteria  but fine  I m willing to overlook that for some delicious grub  which Angie s always delivers.  I remember the carnitas were delicious so I went for that  however  I made the mistake of not ordering the tacos like my friend  With each crunch coming from the other side of the table  I regretted my choice more and more. I enjoyed my plate thoroughly  but I wish I had gotten the tacos.  I ll probably go back and get my fix of carnitas tacos. Also  kudos on the salsa  it s a slow burn  there s definitely spice there and you ll feel it  but it s still flavorful.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,103,Love this place. They have the best corn tortillas in town. Homemade think and tasty. Classic old school Austin Mexican food.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,104,Angie s has some of the best homemade corn tortillas I have ever eaten.  The rest of the menu is pretty good and their new location has loads of more room than the old.   If you are going I recommend starting out with the soft tacos but make sure you order the corn tortillas with them.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,105,Thank to Angie at Angie s Mexican Restaurant for making us a delicious lunch for my Father s Anniversary Date. This was one of his favorite places to eat breakfast in Austin so what better way to break bread with family  amp  friends after mass on Sunday. Thank you for the great service and food.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,106,Classic tex-mex done right   Yes  the corn tortillas and tacos are awesome.  Everything else is good too.  I love the queso flamiado with chorizo.   This is a huge lunch place but the real treat is that when all the restaurants are crowded on Friday night you can get in Angie s easy.  I ve never seen it crowded and I ve been many times Friday and Saturday night.  OK  the secret is out.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,107,Mayra was our waitress was incredible  I really enjoyed the food as well. Lizette ad I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves  We ll be back. Try the carnitas with crispy tacos 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,108,In a town like Austin  where great Mexican food abounds  why would you eat at a place like Angie s  I have a boss who loves the place. What is your excuse  It is an OK  run-of-the-mill TexMex place. The food is not terrible. It is not even bad. It is a reliable some meat wrapped in tortillas covered with melted cheese with rice and re-fried beans on the side kind of place.   Their salsas are GOOD. You can console yourself with their salsa.   Angie herself is a legendary crank. You irritate her. Don t take it personally. Everyone irritates her. She will not single you out for kindness if you re a regular and you tip well. It might be worth going to lunch here just once so that your presence will irritate her. If you re into the whole angry-dining thing.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,109,Their corn tortillas get 5 stars  They re thick  moist  amazing homemade tortillas. I promise this is as good as corn tortillas get this side of the border  The restaurant it self only gets 3 stars. I eat here for the tortillas.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,110,This seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it type place. I ll admit  the service is not perfect  every dish is not a masterpiece  the margaritas are not great  and yet I ve been going here weekly for over 5 years because I m addicted to the corn tortillas and salsa. I ve not noticed any change in food quality  and on the contrary  find it consistently satisfying.   The unique corn tortillas  which others have described with disdain as  thick and chewy  are just that  and that s why I love them  especially in the form of tacos  in which case they are lightly fried. If you re looking for healthy  no. But if you re looking for tasty  oh yeah    If you think the food is bland  you re not using enough of the fantastic salsa  which is fresh  super spicy and full of nice veggies - just the way I like it.  Occasionally  and sadly  the salsa gets slightly less hot  which Angie explains is due to low availability of hot jalapenos at certain times of the year.    In defense of some of the nay-saying    Yes  Angie and some of her staff are not dripping with friendliness  but I find them genuine  appreciative and hardworking. A few of them are really nice    Yes  they use American cheese  which I happen to enjoy. People - it s TEX-mex after all.   Yes  the weekday lunch hour is super busy. It would not be if this was really a one- or two-star establishment. Tips  There are a few extra parking spaces underneath the restaurant  accessible from the alley behind. Once inside  make your way past the register line into the dining room for faster seating. Arriving at 11 00 or 1 00 will usually eliminate any waiting.   Yes  Angie has a policy of no separate checks at the table. However  she is more than happy to separate any check at the register - however you like.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,111,Horrible service   didn t even get a refill one time  Chicken enchiladas in the red sauce where horrible no taste to them  I sent them back and ordered Chicken fajita tacos  sometimes I usually like  but tasted as if the where dipped in soap  Never will I return here to eat again  Waste of my money 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,112,Here s what s good   - Corn Tortillas - Breakfast tacos available all day - Decent chalupas  Here s what s not so good   - Super bland salsa.  It s spicy..but in a watery tomatoey way.  - Bland flavors - Grey refried beans  Odd....  - You can t really taste an individual ingredient  everything just runs together.  The quality of the food is kind of questionable and it doesn t help that they have a plastic donut with a toy roach hiding under the donut.  I get it..it s there for the lulz. But really   Why would you want the first thing seen  next to kitchen no less  to be a cockroach   Even if it is fake      Sorry guys   gals at Angies.  I would have loved to give you a better review. Due to your proximity  I ll be there again and again and again...so you ll have ample opportunity to make the food better.  Until then  2 stars for you.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,113,Angie s would get FIVE STARS but the service is awful. The food is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST in Austin without a doubt.. We have been customers for 10 years plus  when Angie s was in the run down house on the other side of 7th street near I-35. It was small but better service then... The food is the ONLY reason we keep going back.  If you love GREAT food Angie s is the place to go  expect poor service so your not disappointed..   We MISS your sister Angie    
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,114,After reading all the great reviews for this place and thier chicken enchiladas  I told myself   I HAVE TO EAT HERE  .  Their corn tortillas are awesome  nice  thick  soft  and yum   The salsa is nice and spicy  not clear your sinuses spicy  but  Californians  sorry  will steer clear of it looking for the mango salsa  spicy.  And that s it for the good.  The chicken enchiladas that everyone is so excited for is just  eh  .  I mean  they were good  but not great.  It s not something that would draw me here  my friend had the chalupas which I had a couple of bites of...  eh   again.  The service wasn t the best either  we sat down for a good 10 minutes before we got to order.  But watching other people eat surely did whet my appetite.    Overall  I would probably go here again  but not by choice and and after an argument of better the Mexican restaurants in the area.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,115,My husband and I went here for the first time about a week ago. The place is decent  nothing special but it s comfortable. The service was quick  almost too quick-the waitress rushed my husband and he could barely finish the words of his order  P He wasn t thrilled to get canned beer and my margarita  although very good  was rather small. The chips and salsa are very fresh  also very spicy but it s good  The food was not bad but we thought it was too plain. Not much flavor  I think they put it all in the salsa. Overall the place was affordable and fine for a quick lunch but we won t be visiting again.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,116,Yuck. I just left a full plate of enchiladas. Couldn t finish them because they were so terrible. And it was expensive.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,117,honestly  the 1 star is being extremely nice. The waitress was nice but the food was absolutely terrible. extremely over priced for nothing  literally the worst  50 i ve ever spent. We were all in a rush only to get out of that place because after a while I was just nauseous. never again. this is my first help review bc I found this extremely necessary.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,118,Bad food  amp  Bad Service     First time  amp  Last time   Was ignored being seated  10 minutes later....seated and was brought chips with no salsa  Ask for salsa twice and finally received it  a used one that is  when chips were gone  So i got up and retrieved my own  As i was coming back to my table with salsa in hand  the waitress starts moving my stuff to another table telling my table to move to another table so they can use my table to seat a party of 17  WTF   you ask first  not move my stuff first  Waitress takes drink order  wanted to order meal too  she says   no  I need to take all the other drink orders from these tables first   finally ordered...Food comes  taco first...decent  then enchiladas with rice and beans gross   So gross  I was tasting it that night still    What a waste of  21     Oh and the parking  good luck    I suggest Amaya s or Cisco s for better Mexican food and service  
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,119,Angie s is classic Tex-Mex served up by friendly staff. I ve been coming to Angie s ever since she was up the road in a piece of shit house where the only parking was in the back alley. Parking problem still persists as the spaces are tight up front with limited slots out back behind the restaurant. Angie s has daily specials  full bar and a salsa that ll open up your pores  if you know what I mean. The only negative I have is their tortillas are not home made - this is my biggest gripe of  someTex Mex joints in Austin.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,120,I ve eaten at Angie s on and off for 2 years now.  I am sad to see the quality of the food going down.  I just had lunch there and I was pretty flavorless.  I had the Angie s special--a taco  guacamole  cheese enchilada w  rice and beans.  The taco meat was just browned beef--no spice at all.  I asked for onions on the enchiladas which was good because they were pretty flat as well.  It s very sad for me to see them have a decrease in quality because I work nearby.  On the plus side  service is normally quick  don t expect too much from the wait staff though.   And if you get there around 11 30 there is normally not a wait to be seated.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,121,I used to love this place... but my last experience here last week left me wondering if I should ever come back.  My fave dish is the chicken enchiladas so I probably order it 80  of the time...  this time around... it was really bland and served as a hot mess.  The rice had no flavor at all.  The beans  and I normally don t like beans  was the only part of the plate that I finished.  Maybe  just maybe... I will give it one more chance... we ll see...
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,122,In looking for a lunch location with a friend we drove past Angie s and saw the parking lot. Sold    They had a decent crowd but it did take a few minutes for them to seat us and I was confused as to whether we ordered at the front or would even be seated. They told us to select a table and brought us menus. The service was slow. The salsa was too spicy for me... and even my friend  who is Mexican  thought it was super spicy     I ordered the carnitas tacos. They were freakin delicious  Homemade corn tortillas fried with some dang tasty pork filling... yum. Every now and then I d get a really tasty bite and had to stop myself from moaning out loud     My friend had the carne guisada and she said it was good. The homemade corn tortillas weren t very good for some reason. I tried it and she was right. It was almost like the ones for my tacos were thinner. Odd.   Anyhow  I removed a star for the service as it was really slow but I d go back again for those carnitas tacos  Yum  yum 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,123,I always ask the question...why does lard taste so great in foods   You always wonder about the after-effects of consuming these  carcinogenic  ingredients even though they are  naturally  occuring products that mother nature has provided us.  You will have a different perspective after eating their puffy tacos.  Trust me.  My wife first introduced me to this shack when there were right behind the Shell gas station.  It almost looked like you were walking into someone s home to eat lunch.  There was this drink counter with the cash register canted out into the dining area.  Since then they have  re-invested  those lard proceeds into a monumental change as far as landscape.    To the tacos.  I ALWAYS get the puffy tacos.  Beef or chicken  you cannot lose.  But I always wondered how much lard they use to make the puffy sensation taste so wonderfully delicious.  This was reason  455 why I gained 25lbs the first year I dated my wife.  You can literally feel the lard enter your bloodstream once you taste the first bite.  The puffy tacos are unique in that the rigidity of the tacos won t snap or break  like those at Vivo s.  Because once they break  you have to use a fork spoon to eat it and that would completely ruin the experience of have greeze juice run down your arm.    As gross as this sounds...You pretty much go to Angie s to eat her tacos...puffy ones.   Oh and her aqua frescas are fresh.  Limonada por favor.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,124,I came here after we decided to leave Licha s since it was a 2 hr wait. We were walking around trying to find somewhere else to eat. My bf really wanted Mexican so when I saw this place I decided it was worth trying. We walked in and a waitress smiled and yelled sit anywhere. We grabbed a table and were surprised at how big it was and the amount of people there. The were two large parties and a couple of tables with couples. Immediately a gentleman came up to us and took our order for drinks. He was very friendly and suggested a Mexican martini and a frozen marg with a floater. We agreed and ordered just that. Shortly after we received our drinks and chips and salsa. The drinks were strong and good. The salsa was up to par. I m Hispanic and always tell my mom her salsa never tastes like the restaurant growing up. Now being older and wiser I know why. Hers is spicy and authentic and most restaurants are basically tomato sauce. Here it was a perfect medium spicy yet  tomatoey  in a good way. Sadly this was the highlight to our dinner. I ordered a deluxe plate and my bf ordered the Angie special. Basically enchiladas  crispy taco and tostada. Good but in a Tex-mex like every other place. Tasted like every other crispy taco and the enchiladas tasted bland and almost like a frozen dinner. I drenched my food in salsa to give it flavor and my bf cover his in salt. This place is good if your looking for an ordinary tex-mex place and not authentic food. I would probably go back if I wanted really good salsa and drinks. Food wise not my cup of tea. The staff were extra friendly but hard to get a hold of if needed.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,125,I just like this place.   Everything just seems to be home made fresh. Tortillas are fresh and warm and the salza is spicy. Ordered the Angie s Plate. It came out with a hand fried taco shell that had some real body. You just don t see that much any more. A little skimpy on the gracamole though. The Chicken Enchilada with ranchero sauce was more than plentiful and deeeelicious..corn tortillas were also freshly made.   Service is always prompt  the atmosphere is nothing fancy  just a single open room but nicely appointed. Overall  solid Tex Mex on the fresh side but not a place to go if you are counting calories or mg of fat. But what Tex Mex is 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,126,We stopped by Angie s last Friday for a quick bite and a margarita.  It was the perfect way to end a long week  it just hit the spot.  Angie s granddaughter was our waitress  and she made us feel like old friends.  We ll definitely be going back soon 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,127,Went to Angie s for lunch today for the first time and was floored by how good their chips and salsa were.  The chips were freshly made - thick  crispy  and addictive. I ordered the chicken enchiladas  which were pretty good  but not stand-out.  It was my wife s order  the chicken tacos  that really shined.  Her order came with three tacos on a crispy puffy corn tortilla shell and the puffy shells are definitely something to write home about.  Next time I go  I ll definitely be picking those over the enchiladas.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,128,We love Angie s  My sister  amp  brother-in-law were in Austin from Seattle. They were really hungry for Mexican food so we went to our favorite  Angie s  They could not believe how fresh and delicious everything tasted.  From the chips  amp  quest  amp  guacamole to the enchiladas  amp  tamales  all was so very good  amp  they were very impressed  Definitely 5 stars 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,129,Gross   Gross  The food wasn t even edible. Need to make myself throw up. By far the worst Mexican food in Austin. I should have listened to my friends because I just wasted  30. The chicken enchiladas were disgusting.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,130,The most DISGUSTING  amp  BLAND mexican food I ever had. Waitress didnt turn in order for 30mins to top that off the entire order was WRONG   Would have been better off going to Taco Bell. The rudest and most horrible service I have ever experienced period. They have dirty rude children working there and allowing them to argue with a paying customer   Good thing I work for Texas Health Dept   Worst Restaurant ever   So if you don t want good service  amp  good food. DO NOT GO HERE   Don t say you weren t warned 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,131,Yelp s description for a 2-star review is  Meh. I ve experienced better.   I couldn t describe my experience at Angie s any better.  I had lunch with some friends there a couple of days ago and they were great at making accommodations for 6 at a busy time. But we then had to wait several minutes for them to bring us salsa to go with our chips and then several minutes longer for our waitress to come back and take our order  we were all ready to order by the time the busboy brought salsa . After all that waiting  we then probably waited another 20 minutes for our food. That seemed kinda slow to me for lunchtime on a Wednesday. And on top of all the waiting  I also don t remember our waitress coming by a single time during the meal to see if we needed anything else.    I had the cheese enchiladas and couldn t have been any less impressed.  The sauce was like brown gravy and kinda grossed me out.  The beans and rice were just average.  My Dr Pepper was good though.   The parking at Angie s is also kinda pathetic.  They have a small  30-car    -  lot in the front and  more parking in the back .  The additional parking in the back is 5 or 6 compact spots located under the building.  The lot out front is pretty tight with one center aisle and parking on either side of it. Makes it hard to maneuver a truck or SUV. My friends and I all came in trucks so we ended up parking across E. 6th St. on Navasota.  Judging by the other reviews here  the carnitas and puffy tacos are the way to go at Angie s  so I d probably give them another shot to try one of those two dishes.  But based on the one meal I have had there  I wouldn t be expecting anything else at Angie s to knock my socks off. Just another average Tex-Mex joint  if you ask me.  Edit  I just noticed that Frances L. said basically the same thing I did regarding Yelp s description for a 2-star review. That should tell you something about Angie s.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,132,The good  1. It s near my house. 2. The waiter was friendly. 3. The building is new   The bad   1. The food.    The chicken enchiladas had no flavor at all.  The beans had no flavor.  The rice had no flavor.  The salsa had no flavor - saying it was bland would be an understatement.  I took two bites and returned the meal.  I asked for the tacos instead. The tacos were also bland.  I don t reccomend this place unless you know someone who is on a very bland diet for medical reasons.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,133,Angie was the most attentive owner waitress I ve ever encountered. She was very concerned that my eating companion and I enjoyed our meal  and kept bringing us extras of the foods we were obviously enjoying more than others. I felt like I was actually eating in Angie s home rather than in a restaurant.  If you re looking for a homey  personalized Mexican dining experience  try Angie s 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,134,Food was decent but the service was LOUSY    I didn t like that we had to go up and bug the lady to please check us out.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,135,I am a regular customer at Angies Mexican Restaurant .i have been to various Mexican restaurants  but Angies is the Best in Austin  tx. Their enchiladas are great The foods served there are always Hot. From tacos to menudo  Angies have the best.        Derek N.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,136,As I ve mentioned in my previous reviews  I m a bit of a Mexican food snob. I can t help it - it just comes naturally. Anyway  I used to frequent this place when it was a little house on E 7th  a long time ago. Somehow  though  it got lost in the recesses and caverns of my mind and then I moved away for 6 years.  It was when a friend asked me   Do you know of any really good  authentic Mexican restaurants in town   that it hit me.  Why yes - yes I do. It s called Angie s.  At first I panicked when taking a left on E 7th from I-35. The little house that was once Angie s was now called  Uncorked.  Beads of sweat formed on my brow and my eyes darted all around E 7th  looking desperately for Angies - there was nothing. I cursed  pulled over and got out my smart phone and searched for Angie s. I sighed with relief as it was just down the street from its previous location. I knew that   I said to my companion who was eyeing me nervously.  We sat down - salsa and chips were presented to us promptly. Give me a second here  I m starting to tear up. When I bit into that salsa - when that spicy  savory concoction hit my palate  Mozart played - angels sang. I looked at my companion with the face of someone who had just rediscovered the religion of food. I felt like one of those people on TV that shake and contort when the evangelist thouches their foreheads. I was saved.  Okay  okay  I m getting a bit long-winded now. I ll cut to the chase. The carnita tacos were absolutely freakin  amazing and those shells - those crispy  fluffy  godly shells  There I go again.   Look  just go and see for yourself.I m craving that salsa now and I have no way of getting there at the moment. Oh Angie s  you have ruined me.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,137,The service was horrible. Keep an eye out for the older lady in jeans with glasses. She s rude af
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,138,I have never ate so fast.. Not out of enjoyment  but because I wanted to get out of there. Terrible service  food  environment  you name it  And the prices are expensive for the quality.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,139,We both had the caldo de res  beef soup and the flavor want the best. Service was ok  after we got our good she never came back till we were finished eating. I do like the the place is self. No wait was a please too. I might give this place one more chance  then back to Joes I go.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,140,The staff here are very nice  attentive  and helpful. As I m not a huge Tex-Mex fan  I m a bit partial in my judgment of the food here. The tacos are pretty tasty  as they fry the homemade corn tortillas. I usually order the vegetarian enchiladas when I come here  which are tasty but loaded with cheese and tend to be a little greasy.   I do love the freshly made lemonade here. It s tangy and sweet  and served with plenty of crushed ice  so it ends up tasting like a nice lime slushy.   There s a lot of parking in the front with some more in the back. The layout of the restaurant reminds me of an hacienda  with the royal blues  real wood fixtures  and terra cotta tiles.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,141,Not a rave review  but I keep coming back and inviting a few friends.  Been in Austin 25 years  so maybe that s a clue.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,142,Not a fan. So-so food  and service was awful. My family was in town and we stopped in for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The place was mostly empty  only one other couple in there. My party consisted of 3 adults and 4 kids. Here s the problems that ensued  First  the waiter kept getting the drink order wrong. A few sodas  tea and water. Seems pretty easy to me. Then the food order-he asked for it 3 separate times. There was nothing special or added to the orders either-straight off of the menu. There s practically no kid s menu items-enchiladas or a breakfast plate. Then I get the check. A fifteen per cent gratuity was added. I ve NEVER been charged mandatory gratuity when half the party is kids. Ridiculous. There s plenty of delicious food on 7th St. This ain t it.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,143,Bad service  unsanitary  food...  breakfast tacos  eggs were runny. Not worth the price.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,144,Terrible customer service. After we had left the restaurant I called to see if my husbands  card was over charged. I told the girl on the phone the prices I saw on the menu and the prices we were charged were not the same. She became very rude and then hung up on me. This could have been handled very differently and We will never go there again. As for the food  best not to look in the kitchen.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,145,Food was eatable  but WAY overpriced. Go to chipotle   
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,146,If you love corn tortillas  Angie s is the place to be 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,147,Seriously   A-W-E-S-O-M-E    I recommend the Carnitas Taco Plate   Food  was quick and piping hot   Staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean   TWO THUMBS UP 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,148,This fan is now fanning good-bye to Angie s.    Been going for a long time  in fact my office is across 7th street from Angie s.    Good    1  corn tortillas are hot and don t crumble when folded  2   Carnitas plate is killer.  Can t find  em in Austin any better.  3   beef fajitas are tender and come with sauteed onions and bell peppers. 4  Clean too  and the roach under the bagel gag is finally gone.  Bad  1  service stinks  every server is in a rush  so the patrons feel rushed too.  2   loud  tile floors  close tables  blaring tv - univision on wall.  3   Chips... meh.   4  hot salsa is good  but geez bring the water if you make it hot  right   Sat and waited for refills a couple of times.  My last visit went like this.  I ordered an afternoon snack for pick up   1 beef fajita taco on corn to go with an iced tea.  It was over  6     So I asked how much the tea was   3.25 sir.  But she did explain it was 32oz.  nice  thanks.    The to-go tea glass was a large queso bowl with a hole cut out  looks like by a kitchen knife  on top.  Not professional at all... I love the hole-in-wall types but step it up with the to-go glasses  especially at  3.25 a pop.  Come on Angie s if you want better ratings then bring your A-game.  - Todd
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,149,Food is flavorful. Highlights  Thick  corn tortillas w a homemade feel and a salsa that is actually hot and has a habanero kick rather than just a spicy-less sauce  as is the case w many Tex Mex places these days. Group was pleased w our meal. Now if only they could do something about the lighting of the place  dim lighting gives the place a dim  down feel.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,150,Waitress got the order wrong but it was close enough I was ok with it. Manager came out to check so I found that they were gracious and charged me fir original order. They make the chips and tortillas fresh. House salsa too hot for me but my guy liked it. Tacos  chulupa  enchiladas and beans were good. Lot of food for price. Found my stomach hurt later and I didn t eat all the food. They don t make tamales. Worth a visit with kids or large family.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,151,I ve eaten at Angies at the old location  little pink house behind the Shell station at East 7th and I-35 for 3 or more years  about 3 times a month mostly. Got to be a creature of habit with my beef enchilada plate and two tacos on the side. Her tacos  best in town besides Amaya s Taco Village  are what are sometimes known as  puffy tacos   freshly fried shells that come to your table piping hot with the usual combination of ground meat lettuce tomatoes and cheese.   Plates are oven hot  will burn fingers temperature  and this keeps your food hot through the meal nicely. Salsa is above medium hotness  tongue numbing hot  and has been consistent for years.  Has recently moved further down East 7th. The parking lot though now concrete does not hold enough  the old one didn t either but there was another big dirt lot behind  and you ll most likely end up parking in the surrounding streets. The new place is one large room with tile floors and a high wood lined ceiling. This makes for one noisy combination when full of diners  I mean really loud.   The new place was also experiencing some growing pains when I visited. There have always been lines at Angies but they used to move quickly  I waited 20 minutes when I arrived around 11 40. There were also waits for food and for the first time in years  the food wasn t burn your mouth hot. I ll chalk it down to the brand new digs.   Will definately be back. I think they just need to find their rhythm in the new location.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,152,I love Angie s     Even after ten years   I never order anything other than the carnitas taco plate because they are so good  I just can t bring myself to order anything else.  The thick homemade corn tortillas are slightly fried to be soft on the inside  crispy on the outside...perfect.  The staff is hardworking and pleasant. Can t wait to go to Angie s again soon...
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,153,Today is the second time I ve eaten at Angie s.  Both times were yummy.  The first time I ordered the carnitas taco plate  I won t go into detail  b c the only thing I remember was it was delicious  and today for lunch I had the embueltos de pollo  basically chicken enchiladas but with a ranchero sauce topping and no cheese .  The serving was very generous  coming with a side of beans  rice and an extra 2 tortillas.  It was very filling.  This time I tried the flour tortillas instead of the corn.  Big mistake  there is a huge quality difference.  I should have known though  their corn tortillas are homemade after all.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,154,As  foodies   my fiance   amp  I are always open  amp  eager to trying out new places. We enjoy it as an experience  not just to stuff our faces.  So  we re downtown today  only been in Austin for 7 months.. so we ask some locals where we should go for lunch. With great enthusiasm we re told  Angie s .   It was lunch time  busy.. but not bad  though loud with families  amp  their Brady Bunches. I would say that we weren t attended to right away  amp  I never was sure who was really waiting on us. There was an older woman who seemed very rushed  cranky  amp  cut me off before I could finish my order. Hmm..  I have certain criteria for  Tex-Mex  or Mexican restaurants  Are the chips  amp  salsa FRESH  amp  great  Is the iced tea fresh  I think the chips were bagged.. but could be wrong  that was just the taste I got. The salsa was fresh  hot  which I love  but bland.   The service.. not very friendly  I guess they don t like tips  Being an ex-server myself  I m a generous tipper.. for GOOD service.  I had to ask  3 times  amp  wait for about 20 mins. to receive the lemons for my water. There was one sweet girl there that would come fill us up  when I looked around the room. We weren t asked how things were  how it tasted  did we need anything else   This part was really the most discouraging part of our visit. We were out to enjoy our lunch together.  The food overall  I have to say.. rates with the rest of Mexican food in Austin..  Meh.. I ve had better .  I may be biased  being from San Antonio  amp  having the BEST places on every corner  I had to salt my food about 6 times  Very bland. I had the carne guisada  which made about a taco and a bite.. for  8.75.. really  My fiance  had the enchiladas.. just something weird  but can t put my finger on it.  I guess people continue to go there  regardless.. keeping them open  so they probably just don t care about quality  amp  service. Not my first  third or 10th choice for authentic in ATX.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,155,The parking lot is always empty and I don t know why. Everything was incredibly delicious. The waitress just brought me out a couple of tacos she thought I d like and I did  Everyone here reminds me of my mom and I love them.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,156,Horrible experience  I was very excited about trying this place since it has good reviews  but I was very disappointed. Tostadas are super greasy the service is horrible and the place looks like a dirty cafeteria. We were actually charged twice and they promise they would void one transaction and they still haven t.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,157,Will drive out of my way  way out of my way  to eat at Angie s. My partner judges a Tex-Mex place by the salsa and I always go for the beef enchiladas. We were both very pleased.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,158,This review is not about the food but the professional conduct of the managerial staff. After being wrongly accused of having walked out of a meal after not being in the restaurant ever in my life  having simply parked in their lot due to a work affair next door   my car was towed. The managers refused to speak with the people in my party but were spoken to by the police. A formal complaint will be filed. I am extremely dissaapointed in their unprofessional ethics and demand about this entire process.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,159,Angie s was one of the first places I ate in Austin several years ago in the old pink place.  The tacos are fantastic  and the corn tortillas are to die for.  I loved the rice  and I loved the beans.  I don t work downtown anymore  so I haven t been in a while- certainly not to the new place.  The tacos though  make you want to sing 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,160,I had to give this two stars because three said A-OK and it was NOT A-OK. I have lived in Austin for 12 years and Angie s was recommended to me on a flight returning to Austin 11 years ago. I never got around to going although I have eaten at my fair share of other mom and pops and Dive Mexican restaurants around town.  Let me start with the Chips and Salsa. I would say they were good because the chips were airy and the green salsa was the kind I really like  so I was psyched for the entree. I ordered a combo plate of sorts that came with a Taco and Tostada brought out first. Well the guacamole scoop on top of the Tostada was ok BUT the Cheese reminded of the commodity cheese my friends mom always served YUCK. Thankful I had not ordered the CHEESE enchiladas at that point  The Taco was good although I did not know the tortilla was home made until reading it here. I liked it  thick and semi firm  kinda good  easy to eat and ALOT of ground meat on it. I m kinda already stuffed from my OK so far dining experience and then the Enchiladas came. I cut into them without even tasting the beans or rice yet. Well  I chewed and almost spat it out. I managed to keep my face calm and the food in my mouth  but it was the WORST tasted ever. Almost a NON taste... Like nothing no flavor uck. I was done. I did not eat a bite after that. The WORST enchilada I have had in my entire life    I have been a member here for 3 years reading reviews and such and never took the time to post until THIS EXPERIENCE. DON T wast your time or money TRYING this place. I wish we had just driven on up to Pappadeux s for the the Mahi Mahi...
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,161,Had dinner here one night before a CocoaCoders meeting at Conjunctured next door. The pollo de caldo was very good - not your typical mexican chicken soup. Big chunks of vegetables - and it came with homemade corn tortillas that were out of this world.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,162,Food was great  service was ridiculously slow. Food wasn t good enough to make up for the service  given all the other great Mexican places around.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,163,This used to be a smaller place  basically a hole in the wall for mexican food. I went there for lunch last week to check out the new place and I can t wait to go back. The food is freaking awesome    I recommend the chicken enchiladas  they are heaven  The serving size is huge and its a great deal. The margaritas are served strong  which is a plus for me.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,164,Have been to Angie s a few times now.  I think they have the best migas in the city and breakfast is consistently great.  Only went once for dinner and it was not as good nor nearly as crowded.  I suspect many of the lower rated reviews went for dinner.  Great chips and hot sauce and outstanding corn tortillas.  Go for breakfast and I think you will love it.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,165,I first went to Angie s about a year ago and we had the rudest waitress ever  but the food was really good.  Especially those thick corn tortillas    YUMMMM   I ve tried to go back a couple of times  but they were always closed.  Well  Memorial Day we got lucky.  It was my boyfriend s first time there and he ordered the carnitas tacos.  They were AWESOME    I got cheese enchiladas and tacos and they were perfect.  Delicious food   My boyfriend and I were both very impressed   And the waiter we had was really friendly  so it made the experience even better.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone.  It may just be Tex-Mex  but it s great 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,166,Went to Angie s again to confirm that it s still as good as I claim...yep  still the best tacos in town  although a  little  bit too greasy to be perfect .
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,167,Not authentic Mexican food... Tortillas aren t even that thick   And enchiladas didn t have flavor ... Taco was weird had yellow cheese in it and the huevos rancheros had yellow cheese in them  Whereas real huevos rancheros have no yellow cheese on top  Never going back again. It wasn t of my liking.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,168,My husband had been to the old Angie s before they moved to their new building. I had suggested Dario s or Angie s. He said Angie s. I had our 18 month old son with us.   It was THE WORST experience in any restaurant in Austin. We had to wait 10 minutes after seated and still no one came to take our order. We had to find a waitress to take our order. Our drinks sat empty for a while and the line to pay was longer than the line for a show at SXSW. And  it was  25 for lunch with two lunches and two sodas. No thank you. I will go to Dario s or Torchy s Tacos before I will ever go back to Angie s.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,169,Just came back from Angie s...had a machaca taco with egg and a picadillo taco...both on fresh tortillas.  The top shelf Margarita was good  but what I love about Angie s is their salsa...the closest I ve found to Avila s salsa in El Paso  Texas.  Good parking...kinda loud though  but it is a family neighborhood restaurant  and any place with saltillo floors  wooden chairs and high ceilings is going to be loud.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,170,All the great reviews mystify me. I had a large combination plate that featured cheese enchiladas  chalupas  and beef tacos so I could sample several things. Bland  bland  bland. And the queso was nothing but Velveeta. If you want actual flavor  you re better off buying frozen Mexican dinners at HEB. The service was less than gracious to boot.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,171,Seriously don t go to this place. The food is terrible and the service is worse. Never had worse service in Austin in 3 years. A little bonus is that they charge 75 cents per tortilla and don t tell you when you order them. Everyone had a bad attitude too.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,172,Great salsa  good chips  generously refilled repeatedly. Great service. Beautiful restaurant  friendly staff. Good for kids and large groups. Food is good. Decent vegetarian options. Looks like a family business. Planning to try their happy hour next with friends.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,173,Everybody is mentioning everything but the main thing the chicken tacos here go hard  I usually am an early bird and like to get the migas plate but on my days off the  it s the chicken tacos that do it for me. Top 3 Mexican restaurant in Austin fasure
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,174,I went to the old location three times and thought Angie s was OK. Now I ve been to the new location ... and I ll never go back.   The service wasn t just bad  it was nonexistent. We went for an early lunch  11 30 am  and had to ask someone to take our order -- in a half-full restaurant with plenty of waitresses. When the food came  it was plunked in the middle of our table without regard for utensils or drinks that were in the way.  Much of  this could be saved by some great food. Twas not to be. My barbacoa was devoid of flavor  and the carnitas tacos were dry and tough.   Never again.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,175,This place sucks   There is food on the floor  not a clean place . Waiters wear shabby looking clothes and very poor service
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,176,Wow  where s the love for Angie s here at Yelp  One review so far  This place has some incredibly excellent enchiladas  beans rice and hot sauce. Pretty cheap to boot. Definitely top 3 best Tex-Mex place in the entire City of Austin.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,177,breakfast all day--check homemade thick corn tortillas--check salsa you can respect in the morning--check prompt  friendly service--check  The clean dining area and restrooms fly in the old shabby sabroso paradigm used by some pilgrims in their search for The Perfect Enchilada. Is my personal quest over   No--ya busco-- but I d be happy to put Angie s in the rotation while I m searching.   Minor suggestion  Angie might serve the salsa in bigger bowls...
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,178,The only truly great thing I can say is that it was quiet.  Wait staff was friendly and attentive  there were only a couple of other people there  but the food is lacking.  They have a decent size menu but I will likely not return to try anything else.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,179,I ve had a few good experiences and a few bad but the last one takes the cake. They were so understaffed today our waitress was working the register and making the under-poured  over priced drinks. Then we proceeded to wait an hour for 7 breakfast tacos and one was served with raw egg. I m talking snotty looking  runny egg white. We sent it back and When we got to the register they acted like they were doing us a favor by not charging for it. Don t waste your time on this hit or miss nightmare  Geeze.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,180,Not impress the food is a copy of Amayas but there is no comparison. Angies tacos are bite size and her customer service is horrible. Amayas tacos blow hers out of the water. The restaurant doesn t feel  cozy. It is very expensive  not worth the money.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,181,I went to lunch today at this place and was appalled by the poor food quality and very poor attitude of the owner. The tacos were good but they messed up beef enchilada order and then the owner insisted that I had ordered chicken enchiladas w onions and just sent it back on purpose. I was shocked. The rice was so mushy that I could not eat it and I am a RICE fanatic. It was more like oatmeal. The beef enchiladas were not very flavorful and I forced myself to eat one of the two on my plate. This poor meal cost me 8.60. I will not go back and I will continue to warn others - STAY AWAY.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,182,One word. Carnitas  Carnitas  Carnitas    Man  they know how to do carnitas.  Fantastic. I have never tried anything other than the carnitas and the queso but that s good enough for me.  My boyfriend swears by the cheese enchiladas and for six years never ordered anything but. Then he started dating me and now orders the cheese enchiladas and a carnita taco.  Great place  great service and great prices.  Plus they have the best homemade corn tortillas ever. I do however disagree that it s Tex-Mex. I don t like Tex-Mex. This isn t a Chuy s or Baby Acupulco. It s just good simple mexican food. Nothing fancy. Just. Good. Food.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,183,Really good Mexican food   Great salsa and chips. Not so good at making Margaritas.  Went in on a Friday night around 7PM and there was not much of a crowd.  Made me a little nervous but the corn tortillas made me feel much better.  They are almost worth the trip by themselves.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,184,Salsa  amp  chips awesome  chips light  amp  bubbly but strong.  Food delicious  fast  efficient service  amp  affordable.  Quite a treat 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,185,3.5 stars would be a more appropriate rating of this joint. The food was pretty tasty but there was nothing on the menu that stood out to me as very unique. I had the chicken enchiladas and did enjoy them but they tasted like something I could probably make at home. The service here is quick but one of the ladies seemed to have a little bit of an attitude and made me feel rushed to make a decision about my order. Drinks  margaritas  here get the job done in terms of alcohol content but were not very delicious. I would go here again since I live in the area but it wouldn t be the first mexican joint on my list.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,186,The tacos are good but way overpriced. They do not have sweet tea which is a must in Texas restaurants. The salsa is not too bad but boy are they stingy with it.  The parking is terrible and the worst part is how rude the staff is. No southern hospitality here. I like the tacos but for the price and bad attitude I d rather go down the street somewhere else.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,187,Nice restaurant  has a lot of potential with it s location and d cor but food is very mediocre and pricey for what it is.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,188,Angie s is one of the best   Their homemade corn tortillas and their carnitas  YUMMY   We have been going for years and even had my daughter s graduation dinner here and service was awesome along with the bill 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,189,I just reread all of the reviews of this really nice Tex Mex.  I agree with most of the statements   good tortillas  good tacos and enchiladas and hot sauce.  Slow service.  I think they were more attentive when they were smaller because they needed to turn the tables.  I have noticed the slow service in the new address.  What I am really shocked about is the patrons who say they have been treated rudely.  As a long time patron  and older gringa   I have never been treated rudely.  Quite the opposite.  For tex-mex in Austin  it s hard to beat.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,190,This place makes one of the best Micheladas I ve ever had. I wasn t a huge fan of the food  but damn that was a good Michelada.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,191,It s so sad when an old friend let s you down. I haven t been to Angie s in about a year but it had always been a must stop on the way out of Austin for breakfast. It was a tradition that has today been broken. I ordered the huevos rancheros with barbacoa. The eggs tasted like the plastic ones they used to use at department stores to dress up frying pans that were on ranges that were for sale. The barbacoa was totally unseasoned lumps of water braise pot roast cooked in a crock pot. The sides of refried beans  watery and bland  and under cooked potato s weren t edible. Service barely acceptable. I d like to chalk this up to a bad day but there s too many good places to eat in Austin to take a chance on another horrific experience. It is really quite sad telling an old friend they re not measuring up but then that s what friend s do.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,192,Great service and love the homemade corn tortillas.  If you are looking for  real deal  TEX MEX then Angie s is your place.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,193,Mmmmmm...cheesy goodness. I love this place for exactly what it is  cheesy  melty  Tex-Mex goodness. The menu is simple and to the point. You aren t going to find any blue corn crusted shrimp tacos with avocado cream  and that is fine with me. I always get the cheese enchiladas  which I know is such a gringa thing to do  but they are so damn good  My husband thinks the salsa is too spicy  but I think it is just right. The chips are hot and fresh  the food is bubbling hot when it gets to the table  and the house made corn tortillas are legendary. I have heard that Angie is maybe a little cranky. I have never met her  so I can t comment on that  but the waiter s I have had on my visits were very kind and never cranky. They close a little early and parking is limited  otherwise I would have given Angie s 5 stars.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,194,I d give Angie s five stars for the food but 1 star for service. Maybe they didn t expect people to come in on a rainy Saturday. Maybe some folks called in sick. Either way  we sat for quite some time before the waitress came to take our drink order. We had to wave the waitress down to take our food order.  The food was excellent- no complaints  Great home made tortillas  good hot sauce  okay coffee. Speaking of coffee  we had to ask for refills.  When we got the bill  they d charged for seven drinks though we only had only 5 coffees. It also had different prices than what was on the menu. Since we had a party of six and they added gratuity  and we were splitting the bill  we added the prices stated for the items we got on the menu and it came out correct.  Very strange experience. When I go back for the wonderful food  I think we will make sure we aren t splitting checks.  OH yea  make sure you get the tortillas- best in town. PS When I was leaving I heard two potential customers who were leaving  talking- apparently they d sat for quite a long  time and never gotten anything except chips  no salsa  and drinks brought to their table. Step up folks  and ask for service nicely- the food is worth it.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,195,Well  I d never thought I d say this  but I most likely won t be returning to Angie s. It s just not what it used to be. My family and I were regular customers before they relocated from their location close to 35. I decided to take my husband as he d never been before  and I had hyped this place up big time. Poor hubby. We ordered breakfast tacos and they were not good. The bacon was soggy and tough  and the potatoes weren t cooked all the way. I ordered the homemade corn tortillas in hopes that they were still what I remembered  and thankfully they were  but that was about it. The service was lacking--I ended up drinking my husband s water since our waitress never came back to refill my glass. Oh  and our table was sticky and dirty.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,196,The staff was very friendly. The decor is as to be expected. But the food... ugh. Extremely runny queso  odd taste to the rice and beans  sub par enchiladas. Decent tortillas. Sadly  I can t give Angie s a good review. There are just too many other Mexican restaurants in Austin  and within a couple blocks  that are far superior
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,197,The chips and salsa were superb  We loved the enchiladas  amp  puffy tacos  The corn tortillas are the best in town. Yummy 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,198,The food here is typical generic tex-mex fare. Gigantic portions and un-healthy as can be. Salsa packs a punch though. Service is usually unfriendly and inattentive when medium-busy. Not the best customer service out there  but the food consistency helps.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,199,One of my favorite Mexican restaurants here in Austin. Tastes as close to homemade Mexican food as I ve had here.   The menu isn t that extensive  but the Puffy Tacos and the enchiladas are amazing. The salsa has a kick so be aware if you don t like spicey. The Migas are tasty too. They serve breakfast all day  which is a definite plus. Come prepared to eat  because when we go there  it s hard to stop.   Pros  good food  price  not too crowded Cons  I always leave feeling bloated... but in a good way
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,200,I took my sister and few family member to Angie for dinner last night. I had a wonderful time dinning at Angie s. She made us feel like we were visiting our grandma house. Angie s food and service were awesome     I will return.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,201,Horrible experience   They charge you for EVERYTHING   From refills on TEA  to tortillas  to more chips  extra limes  and a TO GO CUP    We also complained b c they did serve much rice on plate and they brought us more and charged us.  Horrible experience and haven t been there since 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,202,I met friends for dinner at Angie s recently  and had a very poor customer service experience.  An older  drunk man sat at the table right behind ours  pulled out his phone  turned on music  and turned up the volume.  Loudly.  Coming out of phone speakers it was tinny and annoying  of course  so we asked if he could turn it down.  He did nothing.  When the waitress served him a bucket of six beers  we asked if she could talk to him about the music.  Instead of addressing it with the man  she told us we could change tables  and then informed us we were  lucky he hadn t brought in his speakers this time .  Clearly  the guy is a regular whom they allow to do as he pleases.  Several things about this situation annoyed me   The man was drunk when he arrived  slurring  watery eyes   yet he was served a bucket of beer.  The people at our table were told to move ... a table of five people with plates of food and drinks.  The man even accused us of being racist ... said we didn t like his Tejano music.   One of our party was Mexican-American.   Not once did the staff address this situation.  They acted as if WE were in the wrong.  I d been to Angie s a few times before this happened but I won t be going back.  The food isn t that great  nor is the atmosphere  and the wait staff leaves a lot to be desired.  Skip Angie s and go elsewhere.  There are plenty of wonderful Mexican   TexMex restaurants in the area to choose from.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,203,The food is so good.....the service is spotty.  The salsa  corn tortillas  and tacos are some of the best.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,204,I honestly have no idea how this place has any positive reviews whatsoever. The salsa is passable  but your meal will dive off a cliff after that. Flavorless meats and sauces  topped with government cheese. We had three people in our party  all qualified to judge a Mexican restaurant. Between the three of us we might have eaten ten bites before leaving. Do not go to this place. I promise you will be disappointed.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,205,I need to start off by saying that I am Mexican and love Mexican food and I look forward to Saturday and Sunday breakfast.  This past Saturday I made the mistake of going back to Angies for breakfast.  I had been there for lunch and although it was a lil pricey the puffy taco was good so I thought how bad can breakfast be   Well we sit down and get approached by the grouchiest woman ever...if she is the owner or front house manager she shouldn t be waiting tables  She really has no business in the service industry.  She takes our order and leaves.  Never brings us chips but does drop off a dollop of salsa...brings me a water because she has to make lemonade i ordered half tea half lemonade.  She brings me a tea with a drop of lemonade.  I have to add sweetner.  When I bite into my taco  the chorizo is sour.  I am Mexican and eat chorizo all the time  I know what spoiled chorizo smells like  I spit it out and flag down the other waitress since ours refuses to come back to the table.  I tell her what is wrong and ask for something else. Well our original waitress returns and now suddenly only speaks spanish and tells me  Why don t you like th chorizo.  What s wrong with it    I tell her she rolls her eyes and says  Well what do you want    I tell her I reordered but would like a refill on my drink.  She then says  We charge for refills   You will be charged for another tea and another lemonade.  Thought in my head  Correct me if I m wrong but if I am being charged for a full tea and a full lemonade shouldn t I have had a full tea and a full lemonade wouldn t this be my other half that I just paid for    I tell her please just bring me a refill.  She rolls her eyes and walks away.  My replacement taco arrives and it s burned the egg is way over cooked my potatoes are burned and the bacon is raw...Needless to say I don t eat it.  She never came back to the table.  I decided to get up and leave at this point...my tab for two tacos of which I ate one...and one tea... 15.00...Seriously Angie s if you want to charge high end prices for your food  you must provide the same service...I ve been in the restaurant industry for 16 years in every capacity from host to General Manager and this is a location that is not worth it.  Their water smells like bleach...no surprise there...their floors were dirty and the rude service...I don t know what happened to this restaurant but I will stick to Dario s or Casa Garcias at least there the food is awesome and the service is great.  Angie s you are truly a disappointment.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,206,I m not sure what everyone is raving about.  Other than the awesome homemade corn tortilaas  this place is standard Tex-Mex.  My deluxe dinner included enchiladas  a taco  and one other item.  And yea  that s plain old American cheese piled all over the food.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,207,Stumbled upon Angie s as I was looking for somewhere new to go that I hadn t tried.  Now that I ve gone once  it s the only place I ll go   The salsa is amazing  the chips are warm  and the food is beyond good.  I had the taco and enchilada plate and ate every last bite.  The enchiladas here are to die for    Definitely a must if you are looking for great Mexican  good service  and good prices 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,208,The service ill never go back. Food was ok nothing especial. Waitress got my order wrong than angie Tried to charge me for it than I corrected so she Tried tell me i had something else. Charged me again. I dunno if this Lady knows up from down just hope she realizes she will By herself close the place...the customer is always right. I worked in food for 15 years and I live By that saying.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,209,Eh  nothing really to write home about.  The food is standard fare.  The customer service is good  which the food was as stellar.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,210,worst mexican food i ve ever had in austin. service was poor and the wait times were ridiculous.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,211,I was taken to Angie s for the first time by a friend of mine from San Antonio. Not being from Texas or Mexico but loving Mexican food and culture she warned me that the food isn t what Austinites or transplants from such places like California or Yankees like me usually enjoy. She made it clear you either like it or you don t. They had the best Migas I have ever had and the homemade corn tortillas were great for soaking up the great sauces left on the plate. I have had migas in a lot of restuarants and I love the Migas at Juan In a Million but it doesnt come close to Angie s. The salsa is spicy and amazing and the servers were very friendly and very attentive. My friend has been going there since it was in the little house at 7th and 35 and when we walked in the door we were treated like family. So hospitable. My first experience was a great experience  we shall see if that continues to be the case and I will say with almost all restaurants and trailers it can be difficult to find consistency. And I am sorry but if you have never worked in the service industry or had a bad day then maybe you should stay home and cook and serve yourself then you won t ever have anything but a perfect experience. Its the East Side  basically the Brooklyn of Austin which is where I moved here from. If you don t expect a little attitude with your food maybe you should go eat in another part of town. Because in almost every business on the East Side that I have been to I have dealt with one or more  snotty too cool for school people but welcome to being in the  hip  part of town. Angie s was not like that for me and I recommend giving it a try at least if you are tired of your normal haunts.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,212,I have only eaten at Angie s two times  but I think it will continue to be a staple in most  if not all  of our future Austin expeditions. We accidentally found it a few months ago  and immediately feel in love with the food. My wife is Hispanic and from San Diego  so she is quite the Mexican food snob. She says it is the best she has tasted since she came to Texas  and I ve lived here my whole life and not experienced anything in my last thirty years that quite compares. The corn tortillas may be what does it for me  but both times I gorged myself on everything that came my way. The only reason I didn t give them a fifth star is because my drink stayed empty a bit longer than I prefer especially with the deliciously spicy salsa that comes with the chips. It definitely is not a big enough complaint to make me disregard the quality of the food. I saw an earlier review that made a point to say that you should not go here if you are a gringo  but this gringo says the impeccable food outweighs any service issues in my opinion  plus I was at a table with three Hispanics and I don t think they were treated any differently than I. Red  yellow  black  or white Angie s Mexican Restaurant is a nice delight.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,213,A group of 29 of us went to Angie s for a late lunch today  and it was fantastic    Food was good  service was outstanding.  They made every effort to accommodate us and meet our needs.  We all had a variety of things from the menu  and everyone was very satisified.  Every bit as good  or better  than Amaya s  although a little pricier.  The carnitas taco plate was delicious.  Definitely will go back.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,214,i ate at angie s last night after walking out on my regular dinner spot  nuevo leon  they sat me  but never returned to take my order  much less bring by water . and thank gawd i did  it was damn good and the service was attentive and polite  exactly what i needed after getting dissed at nuevo. i ordered the vegetarian cheese enchiladas and boy did they hit the spot  the only reason i gave it four and not five stars... cos the cheese was definitely on the cheap side  but sometimes that s okay...just smother it in sour cream and keep on chewing 
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,215,I received exactly what I expected.  Tex-mex food that was great   I like it hot and the salsa was just that.  Excellent service and very prompt.  Contrary to some of the complaints about the service and attitude I found everyone to be pleasant and accomodating.  Comfort food for this displaced texan that did not disappoint.  Angie was also very accomodating and even took me back to my hotel because the cab was going to take 45 minutes.
Angie's Mexican Restaurant,216,HORRIBLE  Parking lot was kinda empty  I should of known better. But no  the nice person I am I had remembered coming here once before and it wasn t too bad so I figured I d try it again. WORST decision I ve EVER made  To start  the woman who runs the place greeted me with a   sit wherever   And after sitting she just dropped the menu on the middle of the wet table upside down and open to the middle on the dinner page  mind you  it s breakfast time. As she demanded   drinks   And started to walk away I was afraid she didn t hear what I wanted to drink  she was walking away as I ordered it. And then another couple came and sat at the table next to the one I was at and they got their drinks  chips  salsa and got their order alllllllll before I even got my drink. Then I had to ask for chips because the woman brought salsa with no chips. To top it off when they finally took my order  it was simple potato egg and cheese taco  is what I said. When they dropped my plate in front of me  literally  it was a bean and cheese taco. UGH  Pissed at they way they treated me as a customer pissed at they way they threw my order at me and pissed at their ugly attitudes I turned red in the face. Good thing I am a nice person and pregnant otherwise I would have blew the roof off their place. I just paid and left  I should have not paid and just told them how shitty they were and left  now that I think about it  But my blood pressure can t sustain the confrontation. HORRIBLE SERVICE            And just bad energy and vibes in this place. I will NEVER return and I hope you run 
La Holly,1,La Holly is the best bar on the east side  imo. This place does so many things right.   There a few things that make this place stand out   -It s not loud  you can actually hear people in your group and don t have to yell -Indoor and outdoor spaces are cozy and can easily acom date large groups -Cocktails are great and they also have a ton of mezcal pours you can chose from -Taco Flats has great tacos and chips and guac -Bathrooms are clean -Lastly and most importantly  It s never overwhelmingly packed. This place is very comfortable. Great for an intimate date  after work drinks  or night out with a big group of friends.   Cons  -Don t go after it rains. You ll be sitting inside or on a wet seat.  -Some staff can be rude which really sucks. Including ownership. Luckily the rest of the bar makes up for this.
La Holly,2,meh. underwhelming and overpriced.  weird vibe.  it feels like a bar looking for an identity.
La Holly,3,Oaxacan Wipeout and quesadillas. Yum. I take a photo of the menu every time I m there and pretend like I m gonna make it at home.
La Holly,4,Great drinks and ambience. Bartenders are great and drinks are reasonably priced. Nice hole in the wall bar.
La Holly,5,Omggg I HAVE to talk about how DAMN GOOD the food is    We came in on Friday night  8 20  around 7pm so it was hoppin   but luckily we were able to find a seat inside. It s pretty loud in there  small space  filled with people  loud music -- we didn t want to sit outside  still too damn hot   so be prepared for that loud vibe.   I was standing in front of the bar looking at a menu when the two guys sitting at the table next to me just randomly and simply stated   get the pirata.  I took it as a sign from the universe and that s exactly what I did. Totally straying from my normal go to  fish or chicken  the protein here was beef fajita so I was a little nervous. But all was calm in the world when I took that first bite. This taco is THE SHIT. Reminded me of my grandpa s cookouts when I was a kid. I text my Mom immediately  sending her pics saying   Apa s relative must have made this meat.  So full of flavor     We also ordered the chicken quesadillas which were delicious with the cheese ring on the outside. My guy got the fish taco and said it was good  too  I will be back  COUNT ON IT 
La Holly,6,I enjoyed the patio seating because there are plenty of mister fans and covered seating--especially needed in this 100  degree weather. The patio area is more spacious than the inside of this bar  it s extremely small. The food truck is expensive for smaller tacos  but it s really delicious  I ordered the Chicken Mole. The atmosphere was eh... weird. Drink are overpriced and slow service. Overall decent experience. Still parking is available.
La Holly,7,Chill bar in Eat Austin specializing in mezcal cocktails. Big fan of their frozen La Sancha which uses vida mezcal  triple sec  their house made hibiscus syrup and some lime.  Gives off a very woody taste.  Cool outside patio to chill in. They have an inside and outside bar. Did I mention they serve up some good tacos as well 
La Holly,8,If you love mezcal  then you HAVE to check out La Holly  They come up with really innovative ways to make mezcal shine in all their drinks.   Happy hour is from 4-6pm on the weekdays  and you get  2 off their cocktails -- but maybe not their house specials drinks  My friend and I arrived early on a weekday around 4pm and ordered their specials  but we didn t see the discount when we closed our tabs.   I got the Sue o Helado  Icy Dream  which had sweet orange and pineapple flavors  while my friend got the harder  more robust mezcal special that was mixed with vermouth  El Amante  The Lover . We sat outside to enjoy their spacious outdoor bench seating as the city started to cool down after a hot December day.  Yeah  it s like that here...    It was nice to have the place to ourselves to chat over some delicious drinks  and then watch the place fill up by the time we closed out our tabs about an hour later.  I think La Holly is a perfect pit stop for happy hours or bar hops. The ambiance was chill  and everyone at the bar was super friendly and helpful. I m actually kinda jealous of the people who work at Favor  because this mezclar a is right next door to them    Will definitely be back. Cheers y all 
La Holly,9,RAMOS GIN FIZZ is the shit and they may not be able to make it though fyi but I got one. I m a fan of the margarita casera . The Trace is the skinny off the menu version. 6 out of 5 stars the only bar that I will come to any day for drinks and tacos. Queso always runs out too quickly.  Caleb is the shit.
La Holly,10,First time visiting this place today and was extremely underwhelmed. The vibes were very odd and uninviting. The main reason we came was for the food truck  but it was empty and you had to order through a QR code. Didn t want to chance how long that wait would ve been since no one was even in the food truck.
La Holly,11,Have you tried their frozen spicy marg  You should  I love this place. Great drinks  chill neighborhood vibe - during the wee -  weekends can still get rowdy  but always fun.   Margs  tacos  chips and salsa... it s really all you need  right 
La Holly,12,I freaking love the drinks at this iconic mezcal tequila east side spot. Drinks are so so good  and Taco Flats never disappoints.   I d happily be 5-stars except the last time I went - I was denied a cup of water with my multiple drink purchase  and I was directed to purchasing a bottle of water  a major TABC rule-breaker  and just generally disappointing .   I hope y all have a team huddle and standardize a better practice here pronto.
La Holly,13,We stopped in to La Holly on a whim  it s now one of my absolute favorite taco spots in Austin. Order online and pick up from the truck in the back. Inside is a cool island vibe with great service and drinks.  Try the pirata and the pollo asada. So savory and hits the spot every time  Chips and guacamole are legit also 
La Holly,14,This purveyor of sumptuous and enormous tacos currently sits where the Dee Dee s food truck was once situated. You can buy your margaritas at the restaurant next door.   The tacos were scrumptious and practically a meal a piece. Served hot. Sweet and careful service. Handmade tortillas. I recommend the tacos al pastor.  I ll be back  
La Holly,15,I m incredibly disappointed at the experience I had at La Holly last night. It s usually my favorite spot  I live in the neighborhood and boasted about the spot which is why my colleages came from north Austin.  I organized a work happy hour there  spent over  500 of my company s money  etc.  An employee told my colleague he could turn the fans on to help with the mosquitos. When he did an hour later  it annoyed guests so I moved to turn them off. At that time  an employee approached me and accused me of ignoring employee rules  that I had never heard   and literally pushed me me out the door. He told me he was sick of this shit and I was kicked out. I m  a 38 year old  was with coworkers and was completely shocked.  I followed them to convey that I had no idea what they were upset about  trying to turn off the fan for my colleagues and glad to do what they d like. They were aggressive and it honestly made no sense. When I continued to explain that I was a local patron  apologetic for any misunderstanding over and over again they allowed me to stay. My group spent over  500 which is why I was trying to appease these kids and not leave.  I won t take my company here again though it s a couple of blocks away. When I asked for the owner s information  the staff gave me a generic email address and laughed. I m really disappointed in the staff and have always appreciated the former employees I knew.  Tonight I took the time to get to know Sophie from NYC when she took my drink  asked about her scooter incident and gave her Austin suggestions. I know her bf was also working at the time.  When I asked for owner information they literally laughed it off and I left. I hate ppl who write bad reviews so I wouldn t write this casually. I m completely shocked and I m sure the owners would want to know who is running their bar. I ve been going here for years and have always had a great experience- tonight was aggressive  scary and just horrible on all levels.
La Holly,16,Excellent frozen margaritas  boozy and flavorful  with your choice of salt rim...Standard  habanero  sweet tamarind. I love this little fun detail  takes it up a notch.  There always seem to be a gaggle of gents behind the bar that are friendly and handsome  to boot.  Some inside seating and a huge outdoor patio with misters and some covered areas.  Taco Flats truck is in back and you can order their goods from the bar  and pick up at the truck . I am not a fan of the vessels  they need to be wider and shallow vs deep and narrow  for the queso  salsa  and guacamole  but I VERY much like all three of those dips and the chips that accompany each of them. Wish you could order them as a trio so you didn t have to triple down on chips  but if you have enough people  that shouldn t be an issue.   It has a divey vibe but doesn t feel down and out.
La Holly,17,I ve been here a couple times now and it s great  I always get the quesadilla from the food truck and the crispy cheese that oozes onto the pan makes it so delicious. The drinks at the bar are your classics  I get the margarita. One time my margarita was missing an ingredient and it tasted bitter but the bartender was nice and made me a new one.
La Holly,18,I m just another EA noob that just moved here but we can blame that on La Holly and Taco Flats      La Holly is a chill pad with some amazing drinks. It feels like it s in a similar vein with Half Step and Whislers to me. They are great.  I ve been working my way down their list and I haven t had a bad one yet. Spirit forward or light and refreshing - they have it.  I usually grab a drink and order food  which is sent to Taco Flats - food truck outside   they hand you a pager and a buzz or two later and the food is ready.  What a marriage made in heaven with these two places.  Head in after work for their happy hour and see what the buzz is about.
La Holly,19,Bobby buddy-best bartendar I ve ever fuggin had. Truly unbelievable. I described a taste to him and he made the drink.
La Holly,20,Does anyone want a  12 margarita to-go  Either the bartender on shift was lazy or 16oz doesn t mean 16oz for La Holly. Super disappointed in a place we ve heard good reviews about. They should be valuing to-go customers just as much as in-person customers. No excuses.
La Holly,21,Ok  first time here.... Lived in Austin for 10 years and native Texan.  If your looking for a legit food truck.... pass        Food truck in back with women on their phones and nock on the window to get attention.... order food at bar    Go to the bar  scan this code and enter your CC info and place your order   Opened QR and enter CC info  email  phone    ect.... For an queso  amp  chips      Pick up order and it s chips and salsa.... Nock on window again and told til talk to the bar because they have no queso.....  Talk to bartender and he shows me screen where I ordered chips and salsa...  I show my phone where I ordered queso and the bar tender removes order from my tap and throws entire order in the trash and looks me in the eyes and says ....   Sorry dude we don t have queso    Welcome to Austin ..... waste your time and don t even get what you pay for         Much better options in Austin    
La Holly,22,If you want some legit Mexican tacos or quesadillas... this is it. Randomly stumbled  literally lol  on it and best find in a city that s a melting pot of good food. Plus the two girls.. de la gente .. loved their personalities.
La Holly,23,This is one of my favorite places during COVID. They have the best mezcal selection and the food truck has one of the best tacos. I recommend Taco Pirata. Also  the outdoor tables setting is great for a good weather day. This location is more chilled that West 6  That is why I like it.
La Holly,24,Amazing mezcal tequila drinks  and great vibes  both indoors and outdoors. Great music  too. Go here 
La Holly,25,I really like the feel of this place. The vibe was very chill and they have a great amount of mescal to choose from  The bartender was very nice and able to make literally anything I asked about. Which is always impressive to me    My only complaint was with the food truck.  Which I know it probably a separate entity but it was the reason we didn t stay  We got pastor tacos  which are my favorite  But the pastor meat was burned to a crisp. Couldn t even eat the meat it was so tough.  Very disappointed with that.  I will say the queso was delicious but it hardened up super fast.   But otherwise  the bar itself I give it an A. Check it out  just don t plan on eating.
La Holly,26,Food is good but the bartenders are fools. They just tried to scam me by telling me  We closed your tab by accident.  After I had order food and left my tab open but what they didn t tell me is that they also charged me a 20     7.79   TIP without letting me know. So when I confronted the bartenders they started to act dumb and started to blame the card reader. Remind you the same bartender that told me he accidentally closed my tab he charge me for my second order without mentioning anything about the TIP from my last order. These bartenders are a joke. Bad service  horrible attitude  and awful customer service. Come on Holly get your shit together.
La Holly,27,This bar was not only cute  comfortable and had an outdoor patio but the drinks were excellent. If you re into Mezcal  they have a great menu including multiple Mezcal drinks. Highly recommend - you won t be disappointed  We will be back 
La Holly,28,Great spot to grab a bite to eat and a cool drink  A must try for any local or tourist 
La Holly,29,Great place to stop in for a drink on the Eastside  They have a nice open patio and inside seating as well. Great selection of cocktails 
La Holly,30,Made a drink that they said was similar to a mojito. Needless to say  it tasted like a jar of pickle juice. When I came to the bar  they failed to accept a terrible drink  and instead stated  the drink was made as ordered  so if you want to buy something else  that is your choice.  BTW this drink was 15  drank and had the consistency of wet kimchi trash. It tasted of over pickled water  which is something nobody should endure. I wish this place on no single human. 0 out of 5 stars.
La Holly,31,Great drinks  great prices and the food truck makes the best fish tacos in town. I love sitting in the sun on their patio and sippin some margs.
La Holly,32,This bar is a lovely spot to grab a cocktail and some bites. We felt safe at the picnic tables and when going up to the bar to order. The cocktails are delicious and the queso  chips and guacamole  and tacos are amazing. Taking one star because the tacos didn t quite live up to my experiences at Taco Flats  sister restaurant on Burnet . But in terms of a drink and app place  you can t go wrong 
La Holly,33,I would drive by this place all the time  not really giving it much consideration  but just recently I noticed a beautiful mural adorning the side and it caught my attention. This has to be new  right  Apparently so  And I m happy to say this place is fantastic  Into they re eighth week of service  this small east side dive has been transformed into a charming Mezcal bar.  They re serving up some really tasty riffs on classic cocktails with Mezcal as the focus. Don t worry you can still find a great sampling of local Austin beers and your staple cocktails but when you re here  it s really all about the Mezcal    I really appreciate the small cozy interior space with a the bar wall covered in beautiful Mezcal bottles from all over Oaxaca. I tried the Negroni and Old Fashioned  both were so flavorful  mellow and smokey. Using Del Maguey as their well for these cocktails was really nice to see   They have a great patio with a few picnic tables and cafe lights strung above connecting you to the perfect accompaniments to a strong drink or Mexican Lager  Tacos and Thai  Taco Flats and Dee Dee s Thai trucks.  Had a great experience here. A great friendly atmosphere. Sometimes a more unique spirit  like Mezcal  can be intimidating to try but I d say this is a great place to get started 
La Holly,34,This review is specifically for the Food truck and not the bar  which I have yet to try  doubt I ever will since the food was so bad.  I ordered one single shrimp taco  which cost me  6   tip and taxes. I don t mind paying high prices for good quality. The reason for the one star is because is was not higher quality at all. The shrimp is labeled as wild caught but it tasted like one of those shrimps you can cook for as long as you want  but won t ever fully get cooked. Having just had the best Baja shrimp taco at Torchy s taco the day before  this taco in comparison was awful and expensive. Torchy s taco had real shrimp  and was only  4.75 plus tax and tip.  Would never visit this food truck again.
La Holly,35,Fun place to meet up with friends and finding delicious tacos and great cocktails and beer.
La Holly,36,La Holly does 3 things right  1. Their mezcal drinks taste incredible  2. Their tacos taste amazing as well  and 3. the service delivers the first two items to the best of their abilities. While many restaurants feature glamour-shots of their food and cocktails La Holly will give you food that looks picture perfect. If you like smoky drinks definitely come here and enjoy the Oaxacan Wipeout. The tacos may look overpriced on the menu but they are completely worth ordering because of their size  quality of meat  and freshness  pastor and pescadito stole the show . We dined here with the family and thoroughly enjoyed it. But La Holly clearly draws more young adults and hipsters to their mezcal quarry.  La Holly isn t much for its looks because it appears what appears to be a slightly renovated shack with low ceilings and a trailer in its backyard for cooking tacos and greasy jumbo chips. It s also located off the main stretch so when we stumbled on it in the dark we weren t sure we were at the right place  but from what we ve seen that s about par for the increasingly urbanizing Austin suburbs.   The interior has the feeling of a home freshly built but not lived in. Two oversized TVs hung over the bar playing National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. The rest of the decor seemed generic with impeccably clean bartables and metal stools. Despite the sterility of the ambiance the young clientele and workers made the place feel cozy. The two friendly hipster bartenders gave us the attention and punctuality we needed to get our food and drinks to make it through our family holiday. They definitely seemed to know several of the patrons and chitchatting in what gave a warm hang-out vibe.  La Holly doesn t overpromise on its goods but outperforms on its quality of drink  food  and friendliness.
La Holly,37,This hidden Mezcal-bar gem deserves all the stars     Walked in on a quiet  rainy night to be greeted by an incredible cocktail menu and super helpful and friendly bar staff.   The Oaxacan Wipeout with pineapple  cinnamon  absinthe butters and habenero syrup is fabulous- sweet and spicy with a creamy top layer. And my husband s mezcal old-fashioned was even better than the reknowned one we had in Santa Fe   This place sports a funky  clean  hipster-dive vibe  has a dope taco truck outside and offers a cocktail menu that would make even the most exclusive speakeasy blush.   I love that it s mezcal-forward and totally dives into it with no apologies.  MUST TRY    
La Holly,38,Horrible AC system that s likely linked to zero insulation.  Their digital thermostat between the rear exit and restrooms registered at 89 degrees at 8 30 pm. The bartender with the rolled up sleeves to show off his arm tats wouldn t answer my girlfriend s questions about their gin selection - acted like he was doing her a favor. The east side is sadly building a horrible stereotype.  I had to go up to him and pull his teeth and  in return  be rude to get some answers get him to do his job.  They also have a political sign in the oven-like area.   They clearly have a liking to BETO.  I would never invest money in an openly biased company that s still very green.  Clearly they won t be expanding or growing.  Dee Dee  who has a food truck located to the rear of the  oven  is one of the best food trucks in the Austin area. I ll never stop giving them  dee dee  business  but I ll never spend a dime at la holly.    I m a tequila and mezcal snob and they have some  of the stuff you should try  bud need to drop the asshole mentality ASAP.
La Holly,39,My favorite chill spot to grab a drink  Amazing tacos  Great outdoor space. Drinks are decently priced  the margarita is my go-to 
La Holly,40,Woohoo  Welcome  La Holly to 78702. You re a star  baby.  La Holly opened recently at the site of the fallen John Mueller Meat Co. I frequented JMMC  so I had a soft spot in my heart for the location and when they left a hole was created. It has been too long since this place occupied something. La Holly came in  filled the hole and the longing for a cocktail bar farther East.   This place is so cute  but doesn t try too hard. They have soft pink cabinetry  a large patio   amp  tons of exposed boards. It feels refreshing and comfortable.   I thought you could be my new neighborhood bar  La H  but you added DEE DEE s Thai trailer and Taco Flat and sealed the deal.
La Holly,41,Funky bar with a decent drink selection. I really enjoyed the frozen spicy margarita and back patio.
La Holly,42,This is a nice little spot. It s not too crowded usually. I get a feeling the crowd comes in waves here  where people pregame then where people end the night. The cocktails are mostly mezcal with a few tequila drinks  but beer and wine is available  too. I tried a gin drink last night  and I m not a gin drinker  but it was very good. There s a taco food truck out back. The tacos are delicious  I will say that my boyfriend and I each got 3 cocktails  chips and guac  two tacos for me  three tacos for him  and it was over  100. So  next time  we may switch to beer after 1 cocktail and lower our taco count to have the bill lower than that.
La Holly,43,This place gives you a device to pay that s hand-held  and the first prompt is for a 25 or 26  tip  then the second option is 20 . Great method for when your customer base is a little tipsy and opts for the first tip amount without looking at it. The tip amount is based on the post-tax total.   Drinks are good.
La Holly,44,Guy with the greasy dark slicked back hair who bartends literally has the worst attitude ever.... we get it tho... you re a  hipster  lmao. Giving this 3 stars because the tacos are always good 
La Holly,45,Great margaritas. We got queso and guacamole which was also good. It s a small bar so best for smaller groups.
La Holly,46,This is our favorite neighborhood bar  The drinks are great  the atmosphere is the best  and everything is consistent. We live up the street and can t say enough good things about this place. We routinely bring friends from out of town and they love it  The mezcal old fashioned and the frozen jaimaca are the best 
La Holly,47,Always love La Holly  Counter point to other reviews  I am more than happy to leave a 25  tip. We were able to have some margaritas on the lovely  socially distanced patio served by people who are putting their health on the line just so we could hang out. 25  is too low for such great service and such great margs 
La Holly,48,Solid hand-crafted cocktails with a full tequila and mezcal selection. Trust your bartenders  Campy vibe that makes you feel right at home in this casual atmosphere. Did I mention Taco Flats and DeeDee  authentic Thai  are the two food trucks right out back  Both delicious and pair well with the drinks. Check out the low-key neighborhood gem. You won t be disappointed 
La Holly,49,tacos and drinks were great  staff was incredibly unfriendly. won t go back - other great taco places in austin with friendlier service
La Holly,50,Tiny  cramped  music is too loud  and the bartenders are snobs. I went with a date and we left after 15 minutes because we couldn t hear each other over the blaring 80s rock. Had high hopes but won t be going back.
La Holly,51,We walked 1 2 mile from Suerte to la holly to have an after dinner cocktail.  The bar says it is open until 11 and when we walked in at 10 25 the bartender said they were closed.  But then offered to serve us shots  but reminded us they were closed.
La Holly,52,Best tacos one the East Side. The frozen Margaritas are awesome as well. Short sweet and to the point - just like La Holly.
La Holly,53,Unique vibe  incredible cocktail program  a rotating tap program  knowledgeable staff.   It s got a great outdoor space with food trucks offering up delicious tacos. Great place to spend a night  or two  or three 
La Holly,54,Best value mezcal cocktails without a doubt in Austin. We live basically right next door  have sampled a great deal of their menu. Surprising good for a place that has never been written up as one Austin s mixologist spots. Pleasant outside patio  their Taco Flats food truck is always open. Little expensive for tacos   5-6 small taco   but they are pretty good if you re hungry. DeeDee no longer on-site which is a huge bummer.
La Holly,55,My wife and I caught the mezcal bug a few months ago in Santa Fe  and THIS is the bar we have been dreaming of.  The cocktails are killer.  The tacos are the bomb.  The Al Pastor taco is smack your mama good.   I think I m coming here every night after work until this job I m on in Austin finishes.   Start your night here and pub crawl back west to the highway. Or  honestly  just come post up here and forget the rest of sixth street.   The music is perfect 70s and indie rock - my wife and I have been sitting here shazamming every song.
La Holly,56,This place has everything I desire in a bar. Great cocktails   a laidback atmosphere  and an enjoyable outdoor seating area.   My favorite cocktail is the Mezcal Old fashioned. It s smoky and boozy and everything it claims to be.  They also have a frozen Hibiscus Mezcal Margarita which taste just as good as it sounds. The thing looks like a piece of art. If you or a friend even has the slightest interest in Agave spirits then you ll be pleasantly surprised by the huge Tequila and Mezcal selection.  Co-starring in this flick is the Taco Flats food truck in the back. I know what you re thinking... As if Austin needed more places to eat tacos  right   Well let me tell you that most taco I ve had in the area fall far short from tacos at this taco truck. The Pirata and the Pescadito NEVER FAIL. They re just solid A  tacos.   Venturing a little further east definitely has its perks. La Holly offers an escape from the the less desirable aspects of downtown with great drinks and juicy tacos. The staff is laidback and knowledgeable  the music is good  and the outside seating area is comfortable for party s big and small. I recommend this place to anyone looking to have a good time.
La Holly,57,Taco s are bomb  but the bartender s attitude ruined my experience here. Will not be coming back.
La Holly,58,Awesome tacos and better mezcal selection. The Pira a tacos were my favorite. I will go back for sure.
La Holly,59,I love this place. My new favorite neighborhood spot  especially recommend it to mezcal fans. If you go  definitely try the spicy frozen margarita. I ve brought tons of friends and out of town guests to this spot and everyone has loved it. Great food trucks too 
La Holly,60,Cool mezcal bar with a cool little patio. Bartenders were very nice and didn t even complain when I asked for a non-mezcal drink. The food trucks are also very good. Would definitely return. Only slight problem isn t really a problem - its just small. And because its a cool place  it gets pretty crowded. At least it was on the night I went.
La Holly,61,This place already gets some stars for having DEE DEE food truck on its property  but La Holly fills in the rest. It embraces everything that I love about a good watering hole. It s new  but it s a dive. It has great craft cocktails  but it doesn t try too hard. It has friendly bartenders  along with it being Mezcal bar  so that s always a selling point for me. The music they played was new and old. It also has the essential Austin patio. It will definitely be my go-to no-frills  hangout bar where I can take it easy and enjoy a tasty libation while eating amazing food truck food.
La Holly,62,There hours are weird  they close early some days and also not open everyday. It doesn t say when they are open on the website.
La Holly,63,Very cute place. If you don t like mezcal  you re gonna have a hard time. There are beers but... it s a mezcal bar. If you DO  though  great cocktails. Very friendly bartenders.
La Holly,64,This bar is in our new neighborhood and we love it. The owner and staff are nice and welcoming. Drinks are on point with a strong Mezcal presence. Dark and cool inside and dog friendly. Go check it out 
Nonos Tacos,1,And old friend was coming to town I had not seen for decades and I knew she was going to love to get Tex-Mex while she was in Texas. I was looking for a place not too far from where I lived and before I began geeking out on finding food trucks in the area I had been under the impression that places with good Mexican food are rare in this part of town. Boy  was I wrong   First  let me admit upfront I m a gringo and have lived in Texas so long that I really don t know the different between Mexican and Tex-Mex  though I did live in New Mexico a little while and can tell you that their Mexican food is the HOTTEST as in burn your tongue     Every time I would begin to search again for a food truck within approx. 2 miles where I live  which is by Metric and Braker  I found another food truck or  hole in the wall  or even an apartment selling highly rated Mexican food. The main problem I had as I was narrowing down where to pick up our food to take and eat at home was that many of these places with wonderful food are not very bilingual and it can make it hard to order if you love Mexican yet don t speak the language  esp. for someone like me who doesn t eat pork or even shrimp anymore . There are LOTS of different dishes that have pork  including puerco  pastor  carnitas  many gorditas  chiccaron and more.  One place I was beginning to think was the bomb had a lot of reviews warning that without knowing Spanish ordering or communicating at all could be very difficult. That particular place I wanted to know if their tripe was from pig  cow  sheep or what. I asked my question in an online English translator and had it converted to Spanish. I then played the voice aloud that asked my question in Spanish and called the place and asked the question via my computer. What had seemed like a brilliant idea totally flopped. I tried twice and both times he just say  bye  and hung up on me.  I decided to search again -- this after spending most of the day researching Tex-Mex places -- and was surprised to see THIS place -- Nonos Tacos -- for the very first time. And WOW. A bilingual couple runs it  so no worrying about being  hung up on  in person or on the phone  a menu that truly seems to have a HUGE number of choices for a small operation  great reviews of good  fresh and affordable food. And even a review kind enough to make it easier to find by telling people that it is attached to a Sunrise Mini-Mart  it s the screen porch looking extension  with a sign on it that has a totally different name. The sign does NOT say Nonos Tacos. Sorry  but I didn t memorize what it said  but clearly it was another Mexican name and the sign is still up.   Review warned -- also very helpfully -- that they do not serve drinks. Though of course for convenience store prices drinks can be bought at the mini-mart.   I also saw a number of reviews implying that this was a very dangerous neighborhood and scary even to men. I went midday and felt no such qualms there  but I m a big believer in just staying home when it is dark. For those who do go out in the dark  this may be a dangerous place to go  but my experience at about 2 00 p.m. was fine  and not many people around and easy to find a parking space.  The menu is indeed BIG and so easy to read in the signage in the enclosed  porch  of Nonos Tacos where you can order and wait. They even have a few tall chairs  bar stool high  to sit on while waiting. I also knew from reviews that you can call in your order so that it will be ready when you go to pick it up. They take both cash AND cards  whereas my other top choices took cash only   the food was wonderful -- me and three friends got our orders -- the prices for the days we live in were VERY reasonable  and last but not least it is a friendly place.  I also agree with those who recommended their green sauce. Careful when you use it -- it s pretty spicy -- but it s sooooo good. All of it was good and in our party of four there was only one complaint  and that was that they forgot to give her the rice and beans she ordered  and we didn t look in the bags until we got to my place . We gave them a double tip. They were that good. Or to put it in Spanish  BUENO   One thing I forgot to mention. If someone just wants some good food but doesn t really want Mexican  they have hamburgers and french fries there too. To be honest  the menu had so many things on it and we were on a time clock so we just went for what we wanted and though I should have  I did not take the time to read all of the choices on the menu. I think it is safe to say there is something for everyone there.  This is not a place that is set up for you to eat there  but at the same time a party of 3 or less might sit on the stools in the porch and eat  though it is not at all like  restaurant seating  and I would not recommend eating on location. It s really not set up for that. There MAY be a picnic table outside  but only if there is one on the side I never looked at. Order  to go. 
Nonos Tacos,2,As nondescript a taco joint as they come  but punches well above its weight in excellent  excellent food.  We had a bit of trouble finding Nono s because the sign on its exterior said  Taqueria La Cascada . I m not sure if they ve rebranded  but just follow the address and enter the built out screened porch attached to a corner store and you re in the right spot.  We came here in the morning and the porch stayed impressively cool  I imagine it could get fairly toasty in the afternoon  but when we were there the shade and fan did a good job . There s a small bit of seating at a counter  no tables.  I brought four friends with me and each of the tacos we tried  probably a dozen individual varieties of both breakfast and lunch tacos  received universal accolades. Portions are good  price is right  flavor is impeccable.
Nonos Tacos,3,This is a hidden gem  if you like authentic Mexican food  I love their torta cubana. For one it s huge and delicious  I add an order of French fries to mine and it s great for two meals. I ve also had their burritos and just like they toast the bread on the torta  they will toast one side of the burrito and it s so yummy  I ve never been disappointed when I ve ordered food here.
Nonos Tacos,4,Love this place  Called in a large order to pick up the next day and it was ready when I got there and was exactly what I ordered. The staff is super nice and the food is great.
Nonos Tacos,5,Nonos is REALLY cheap  and pretty damn good. I like the pastor tacos  torta Cubana  burritos  and quesadillas. The kids quesadilla is huge and only 2.99. The green sauce is soooo good. Everything is tasty and a great value 
Nonos Tacos,6,menudo wasn t great. flavorless broth. If I had known it didn t come with hominy  I wouldn t have ordered. Also ordered a fajita taco and it was lame.
Nonos Tacos,7,Blink and you might miss it  and you ll be devastated that you did. This taco shop offers up a master class in tacos without the frills and fancy hubbub of something boujeeier. The service was fast  friendly  and on-point  too. Everything was made to order and extremely fresh. Both the al pastor and barbacoa were exploding with great flavor and the helpings were big. This is a must-have stop if you re in the mood for tacos.
Nonos Tacos,8,We love this place  A little unassuming taco shack attached to a gas station has never been more appealing. You can get authentic and delicious Mexican food and I couldn t recommend the chicken burrito any more highly  They add a tasty crema and I always order with jalape os  that I think they pickle in house . Not to mention this place is about half of what you would spend anywhere else  Love you nonos 
Nonos Tacos,9,This location never disappoints and always serves delicious food fast so I definitely wanted to take the time to leave them a 5 star review  The location may be a bit weird  the building is right next door to a gas station in the middle of a residential neighborhood and caters more to-go orders than dine-in   but if it feels like a hole-in-the-wall  it probably means it s going to be really good  and it is   The tortillas are always really warm and fresh. We live just down the road so we order from here a lot and have gotten to know the menu pretty well. Here are my reviews on some items we have tried over our several visits...  Breakfast tacos - Build your own  2 toppings for  1.75  and add cheese whatever for  0.25 for each add. topping means I will be ordering again and again  I can usually eat 3 or 4 tacos that I make at home for myself no prob  corn tortillas seem less filling  but I ALWAYS have trouble finishing my 2nd breakfast taco from Nonos   I have never had trouble finishing a 2nd taco . My most recent experience was for breakfast and I literally thought   Damn  this is a fat-ass taco     That being said  I have never ordered dinner tacos from here  bc we eat breakfast tacos so much I always get the quesadilla  flautas  or mix it up with one of their yummy sandwiches if we grab dinner from here .  If I had to make one critique it would be that the potatoes in the breakfast tacos always seem a little underdone  amp  could be way crispier  maybe they sat too long got steamy before I got them  who knows  so they re my least favorite taco topping of all the things I ve ordered here  but still good.  Migas taco - My new favorite  vegetarian-friendly  taco on the menu  Eggs and corn chips with tomatoes  onions  jalape os and cheese  I love vegetables in my eggs  can t get enough   I thought the jalape os were going to be too spicy for breakfast but they were very mild  which I appreciated. Will definitely order again.  Steak  amp  egg taco - I am a  trying  vegetarian and I made the mistake of trying the steak   amp  egg breakfast taco one day  add onions and cheese  OMG  in addition to our usual when I was having an insatiable craving for red meat... I  only  say this was a mistake BC now I crave it all the time   I try not to eat meat but one thing I really seem to have trouble resisting is a grilled steak -ugh- especially when done well...pun totally not intended.  Where else can you find a quality grilled steak  egg  amp  cheese taco for only like  2    Don t tell me.   Quesadilla especial - a big-ass  delectable quesadilla  described as one of their house specialties  comes with your choice of meat  orrrr get it without   The tortilla was crispy even after it got cold  it was so big I couldn t eat it all while it was still hot  def not mad about that fact . It comes with a side of fresh tomato lettuce   sour cream. After I ordered it the first time I ordered it again the next couple visits in a row because it was so good  amp  satisfying.   Papas fritas - tasty  chunky crinkle cut fries with seasoning salt which somehow even pair well with breakfast  tacos... It took several visits for me to try them  got them one day with a sandwich  but now that I have I m hooked. If they were cold it s only because we ordered it for delivery  but when that happened I popped them in the air fryer for 2 mins and they were good as new and still tasty. Every time I ve ordered them I received a box full with enough for 2 servings.  That s enough of a review right  Totally worth a try  especially for breakfast tacos. As always don t forget to leave a tip  Thanks y all  
Nonos Tacos,10,Best hidden gem of a taco joint in this part of Austin. Get the migas breakfast taco  or go for the breakfast burrito. Super friendly  and super cheap. Almost didn t want to leave a review to keep  o os hidden for myself.
Nonos Tacos,11,I ordered the fajita tacos and they were delicious.  Will be going back to try the menudo and churros.    
Nonos Tacos,12,Delicious breakfast tacos. Fresh  hearty and authentic. You can get them to go or sit on the picnic tables outside. Be advised that they don t serve drinks and you ll need to get them at the sketchy convenience store next door. You can pay with cash or credit cards.
Nonos Tacos,13,This is one of my work lunch staples. The huge burrito for  5.75 is a bargain. They sell pollos asados  whole grilled chickens  so it makes sense to order the grilled chicken on the burrito. It s good  I order it with lime to squeeze on every bite and they have that awesome creamy green salsa. Highly recommend 
Nonos Tacos,14,Delicious    Very authentic tacos  sketchy area  but sketchy areas have the best tacos   Haha    I loved their chicken fajitas and migas tacos. Friendly cashier  not tex mex  Real mexican tacos 
Nonos Tacos,15,I love Nonos  They have the perfect serving size  seasoning is on point  sauces are amazing. Overall every time I visit everything is very consistent and I know what to expect every time 
Nonos Tacos,16,I work nearby and am growing to love Nonos breakfast tacos. Everything is made fresh to order  the manager is very friendly  and bilingual  and it starts my and my coworkers  day out right.   We are in the process of setting up catering  for a work function due to popular request  and my coworkers are tough people to please when it comes to tacos. I m a regular now and I recommend everyone to eat here   They don t serve beverages due to being attached to Sunrise Miri-Mart but the owner over there is friendly and the store is well stocked so it s not an issue.
Nonos Tacos,17,Great hole in the wall. Authentic. Polite staff. Great tasting food. Not much sitting room but it works. I ordered some breakfast tacos. It was amazing to see them making tortillas in there  That s how you know they re taking the time to make it right  Salsa is tasty. I recommend the green one. It s a bit spicier -- but I like that     I have tried both the corn and flour tortillas. Can t go wrong either way. Bring your own drink or you can get one from the convenient store next door -- but that store charged me like  3 for a Topo Chico  Dude  it s .81 at HEB. But that s for another review.  D
Nonos Tacos,18,Food was amazing  the meat was juicy and the food was scalding hot. I d definitely come back again.
Nonos Tacos,19,Two words  grilled tortillas. This place grills all their tortillas  and it tastes amazing. This place is more of a Mexican style  not Tex Mex . Burritos here are fantastic  cheap  and filling. Tacos here taste pretty good  highly recommend the barbacoa  but the tortillas are big and could do with a bit more filling. Everything is pretty fairly priced  and the grilled tortillas make everything much more tasty than your typical fare. One thing to know if you are dining in  it is a very small place that is meant more for take out orders and the only cooling is from a portable air conditioner. And also you have to get drinks from the convenience store next door.
Nonos Tacos,20,Yum. Real Mex. 3 chicken tinga tostadas  a huge meal   were  6.95. Most other things were cheap too.  Real fresh fried  chips and  hardly any  sauce was  4.50   very odd. A 3 oz. container of extra green sauce  like El Regio s awesome version  was  1.50. This was through Prime Restaurant Delivery so I could see some errors in translation transcription whatever. Go see them we will soon.
Nonos Tacos,21,I am so fortunate to live within walking distance of a KICKASS TACO JOINT. Seriously  I eat there at least three times a week or more. Best home made  authentic Mexican food I have had  and I hail from the border. Taste of Home
Nonos Tacos,22,New favorite little place.. Very affordable.. great friendly staff and authentic Mexican food.
Nonos Tacos,23,This is one of my favorite places to get breakfast tacos  they re fast  friendly  made to order  and inexpensive-but you get SO much for your dollar. There s two locations  both are awesome. My go to quick breakfast when I have a few friends in town
Nonos Tacos,24,Lucky to have an affordable  delicious and authentic  not to mention fresh and made to order  taco stand around the corner. Love It
Nonos Tacos,25,Best tacos in town  I ve been in Austin six years and haven t found better. And the staff is so incredibly nice 
Nonos Tacos,26,Fast and friendly. Breakfest  lunch or dinner its always a good place to get food. I ve not once been disappointed with anything i have ordered. 100  sure i ll be back again.
Dos Salsas,1,We are on a small fun weekend staying near the domain and decided to try this restaurant as we had never been.  It seems fairly new as it has only 3 locations as if now.  I want to start with our waiter. He was training a new employee and was super friendly and helpful. He helped us choose drinks and was fast and friendly.  I got a shredded chicken chimichanga and Shana got shrimp tacos. Mine was pretty good  good flavor and a good size  not small but not so big it was too much.  Shana enjoyed the shrimp tacos but as a shrimp taco affinado they were not the best she has had in Austin but still good.  The drinks were flavorful and large.   It was a nice experience  large with a sitting waiting area when you come in  then you go upstairs to eat.  Overall it was good. Nothing overly great or awful about it.
Dos Salsas,2,We were randomly browsing on Yelp for a Tex-mex place and ended up here.   We ordered a couple of things. One chimichanga and one burrito. The veggie burrito was filled with veggies  which were not very good in taste and the whole thing together didn t taste very good. The beans were also okay.  Same with the chimichanga  very okay in taste.   We also ordered a drink with light ice  but when we got it  it was filled with ice and we had to remove a plate full of ice cubes from it.   Which brings me to the service. It s not great I think  worse than an average restaurant. Our server was quite rude which also affected our overall experience.   The vibe of the place was good since they have live music and karaoke  but that after a point was also too loud.
Dos Salsas,3,This place is a trap    Lol but I mean that in a good way  I was lured here  literally lured here by the smell of the chefs cheffing it up in the kitchen.  You could smell the food from across the street and by street I mean the Domain because it s located right across the street off Burnet Rd.  It s a 2 story building but the actual restaurant is upstairs.  They have stairs and an elevator and a nice little waiting area downstairs.  I only ordered drinks and YES they were delicious.   I ordered the Dos Salsas which is named after the restaurant.  I cannot remember the name of the other drink my better half ordered but it was delicious and we have pics to prove it lol.  They also have a stage I m guessing for live music and screen tvs for your viewing pleasures.   Ofcourse their are a few cons but nothing major as it s my personal opinion.  Although a wonderful establishment it felt more of a cafe type setting.  The seats are pretty close to each other and offer no privacy....that s it.  We re you expecting more  Lol no this place is awesome I will definitely be back to try out the food but so far so good
Dos Salsas,4,The food was good priced and good portions. The queso was great. The service was ok. It was busy. You need to stay on top of the person putting your name on the wait list as they messed up putting ours down when we came in before another large group even though we asked them to put our name down. We went to check and they didn t have our name down but did remember we came in before the other party as we were standing right in front of them waiting. So I am not sure why they wouldn t have our name down when we were taking the bench in front of their station and spoke to them about the size of our group to wait our turn. Overall it is a good place to go if you have a large party. Not too expensive. Service was ok. Food was ok. Everything was ok.
Dos Salsas,5,As a San Antonio native  this place is pretty overpriced and mediocre for Tex-Mex  but a somewhat better alternative to many other places in Austin  particularly in the north area. Convenient to the Domain area  Dos Salsas is a chill Tex-Mex restaurant and their margaritas and fajitas  amongst other classic Tex-Mex plates  will hit the spot and fulfill your craving. Much better pricing than Valencia s Tex-Mex IN the Domain  only worth going to for happy hour  if even that .  The fajitas are decent and the margs are pretty good. You get your typical chips and salsas when seated  and the service is pretty standard. They also have karaoke nights on weeknights sometimes. It can get pretty busy towards the end of the week  but it s a consistent spot for all your Tex-Mex cravings 
Dos Salsas,6,So  easy to get to  great tacos  the best barbacoa  and the best salsa   Great chicken flautas  However...the chicken they use in the tortilla soup is a little too lean...
Dos Salsas,7,Always on point  delicious  filling  plentiful proportions. The lovely lady that took my order over the phone and when I pickup my order was so nice.
Dos Salsas,8,Chicken  Shrimp  Beef and sausage fajitas were great except sausage wasn t the best choice for a Mexican dinner.  Condiments sufficiently provided  clean  fast service and fair price. Margaritas great  will return.
Dos Salsas,9,Totally decent and will return. A bit pricey for being pretty standard. Menu seems a bit all over the place    My meal was totally fine. As a native San Antonian though  I don t understand how a meal doesn t automatically come with tortillas or how any Mexican  Tex-mex place doesn t make their own tortillas in house. I m spoiled I guess.   One point I want to give props to is the enchiladas. Specifically  it seems they either dredge or dust the tortillas with chili powder  Love that  Gives great flavor instead of just rolling plain corn tortillas with the filling. My Mexican martini was fine a well  nothing special but would order again.
Dos Salsas,10,This has been one of my favorite restaruants for 15 years. The green salsa is amazing and I could drink it like soda.   The food is good  good price  service is usually good  I mean I used to go once a week for two or three years  it s not always gonna be perfect .  I love the shrimp coctail and the flan. And guacamole so I have an excuse to eat lots of chips with the green salsa.
Dos Salsas,11,I loved the food here  Ordered their veggie Relleno. It was so tasty  And gobbled up their rice and black beans. The red salsa is .
Dos Salsas,12,Moved to the neighborhood just a couple months ago and have already been here twice for happy hour dinner.  I can tell it s going to be in our rotation of usual spots   If there s one thing you should know about me it s that I m going to find the nearest tex-mex restaurant and I m going to order a margarita.  The margaritas here do not disappoint   Nor does the food.  The menu is quite large when compared to your typical tex-mex spot so it should be easy for you to find something that fits your fancy.  They also have an extensive drink list and happy hour runs on friday  score  .  If you re familiar with other texmex spots around town I would compare this one to Glorias.  It s not your whole in the wall spot and it does get very busy during peak hours.
Dos Salsas,13,The customer service was horrible. The server told us they didn t have something it said they had  which was verified by asking at the bar .   The first bar tender was a female with a top bun who just completely dismissed us - but a male then walked over from cleaning a table and helped us  the top bun female then yelled at this guy for some reason .   The server had whole conversations with two other tables but when my friend asked for a drink the server literally huffed and said they didn t have it  which  as previously mentioned  was a lie .  The food was average. Queso with meat was good but neither of us was impressed with the entr es  lacked flavor . It s not a place I would recommend... or return.
Dos Salsas,14,Our waitress was friendly. It was a holiday  so everyone seemed a bit overwhelmed by the crowd.   We waited about 15 minutes once we sat before getting water or were greeted.  The food was alright  Nothing wrong with it  and everything was cooked well. Margarita was good too 
Dos Salsas,15,The seasoning is good  but for the second time  the lunch special was served cold.  The rice was hot  but the enchiladas and beans were very cold.  There is never  ever an excuse for cold food at a restaurant.  We will not return.
Dos Salsas,16,Found it very interesting to walk in and discover that the dining area is upstairs   Now that s unusual   The restaurant was willing to set aside an area in a side room for our group so we could hold a meeting over a weekend.  We greatly appreciated that they would accommodate us.  Our server did a good job staying on top of all of our needs--refilling drinks  catching orders of people coming in late  keeping chip bowls full.  Food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. My only complaint is that the food is boring--it tastes like Mexican food my midwestern mother would make.  The chicken in my taco salad had zero seasoning.  It s as if it was made for someone afraid of spice. The one bright spot was the tres leches cake--it was beautifully moist and plated.
Dos Salsas,17,This was my first time at the Georgetown location and we got there on Friday at around 6pm. I expected a long wait as Dos Salsas is usually pretty popular. To my surprise wait was actually less than 10 minutes  We were sat down in a booth inside and our server was with us in less than a few minutes with some chips and salsa.   We ordered the chips and queso to start. I forgot to take a photo but it was very good. We finished the entire basket of chips and without us even asking for more the staff brought us a fresh basket and refilled our salsas. This is pretty rare to get our chips and salsa topped off without asking.   I ordered the Mole Chicken Enchiladas. These were very very good. Probably the best I ve had. The beans were perfectly seasoned and the rice was a nice addition to the flavor of the enchilada.  I will come back for these again. Thanks for the awesome service.
Dos Salsas,18,A friend and I stopped in for dinner last week. Carlos was our server and he recommended the best drinks on the menu. We had the Shrimp Zoodles which were full of flavor. Carlos kept our waters full  made sure we were well taken care of and didn t rush us out at closing. We ll be back soon 
Dos Salsas,19,This was my first time at this restaurant and I m sure it will not be my last time. I went to dinner with a large group and the customer service was great  We didn t make reservations  but was able to get seated quickly and together. Our waiter was nice  friendly and patient. Our food and drinks were served to us promptly. My food and my drink was good. The food and drink price point is reasonable. The restaurant is nice  clean and big  which is good for large parties. The restroom is a nice size and it was clean. The restaurant has a parking lot that can get full quickly because I don t believe they have a lot of spaces.
Dos Salsas,20,We came in on a Sunday for lunch for the mariachi band and really enjoyed it  We got coronaritas and I ordered the fish taco plate. Everything was yummy and we had more than enough food to take home leftovers. Our server was very friendly and checked on us often. My only complaint is the noise level inside and the odd layout. The whole restaurant is on the second floor of the building and when it s as busy as it was that day it feels a bit cramped. That being said it s a great classic casual Mexican food spot and I d love to go back 
Dos Salsas,21,Came for Cinco de mayo.. I believe it s my second time celebrating it there and both times I really enjoyed  The Serrano Margarita is a must try
Dos Salsas,22,I want to recognize our waiter Carlos for taking care of my party of 16. Food was great. Very accommodating and the best Waiter I ve ever had. Thank You again Carlos  I recommend this restaurant as well as any of the locations. I live in Georgetown where the first one was built  Please commend him Memo 
Dos Salsas,23,Visiting for a conference and we tried this place out. The chicken tortilla soup was great   Also we had the lunch plate and portion size was  large 
Dos Salsas,24,The atmosphere in this place is gorgeous. The large floor plan  and high ceilings help you feel safe  Covid considering. Our waiter was warm  and helpful. We started off with a Memo s Rita and a Skinny Rita. Both were very tasty. The Memo s was considerably larger which made sense since it was twice as much. But the Skinny was able to hold it s own. We decided to split the Pescado a la Mexicana since we are doing Keto at the moment. Forgot to ask for no rice but we just ate around it. The fish was so juicy and flavorful. Oddly enough  the veggies stole the show. Slight char  and I m not sure how they were seasoned but goodness they were fantastic    Looking forward to exploring their menu in the future.
Dos Salsas,25,My chile relleno came with a piece of hard plastic that I had to spit from my mouth and I still paid  16.99 for this plate even though I took 1 bite and spit it out  my waiter said it was probably from the packaging of where the chiles came in and walked away  he didn t care whatsoever.  Horrible service   I would have asked my waiter to discount my plate but I m not that type of customer he should ve done it without me asking  just know that I will not be returning here.
Dos Salsas,26,This is somewhat of a mixed review. First and foremost we love Dos Salsas  at least the location in Cedar Park. We have been multiple times with no complaints or issues.  This was the one and only time we decided to try the restaurant by the Domain.  We arrived around 4 30pm on a Saturday. The location was convenient and the restaurant was clean. There were very few customers  perhaps a bad sign  on a Saturday even  .  We were promptly seated and greeted. We ordered drinks and queso.  Sadly  from that point on our experience went downhill.    Our server was mostly absent. She never checked on us to refill chips or follow up on drinks water.  Other servers were busy tending to the few customers who had arrived but unfortunately ours was hardly seen.  The food arrived and you could tell it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.  The beans had that warm but harder outer layer and the melted cheese had started to harden as well. After a mediocre meal and lackluster service I asked to speak to the manager.   The manager arrived and was apologetic and offered to comp the meal. I explained that I was still willing to pay for the meal but that I wanted her to be aware of the situation and our experience both with food and service.  She discounted the meal and we paid and still tipped on the original amount.    It appeared that the server was occupied with her child who had arrived with her at work that day. I am sympathetic to situations such as this and understand that unforeseen circumstances perhaps require you to bring your child to work.  Unfortunately it will just require you to split your attention between your job and your child.  I am not interested in punishing the restaurant or the server  which is why I still tipped appropriately   but I would have really liked a little more attentiveness and for the food to not sit for as long as it did.  The manager was accommodating and while I appreciate their efforts it ll be hard for me to justify this location over the Cedar Park.
Dos Salsas,27,First time here at location on Burnet Rd.  The building is beautiful.  Parking alright  but wonder why we can t park underneath in the shade   Have to take stairs or elevator to the main dining area.  The restaurent is large and open.  The staff attentive.  The main reason for the 2 stars is the food.  The red salsa  is sweet and tastes like it s out of a jar.  The green salsa was spicy  but meh.  My nachos supreme looked great.  Large order.  Had absolutely no flavor  no tex mex flavor at all.  My friend s beef fajita taco salad was the same.  No cumin  no chili powder  no cayenne... nothing.  He kept taking onions off my plate to give his salad some flavor.  Won t be going back.
Dos Salsas,28,So I am someone who has lived in southern New Mexico and I am very picky when it comes to my Mexican food. I came cause Glorias was taking way too long. But I must have come on the perfect night because I was so entertained. Tons of family s were celebrating  Austin FC soccer was playing  and the karaoke was getting the crowd hype. Environment 10 10 I always judge a New Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa  of course they passed with flying colors.   I started with a frozen mango margarita with tajin and the taco plate to start. Delicious. My eyes were rolling back and I almost had an out of body experience. THATS ALL IMMA SAY   Next was the Enchiladas. Do not skip the enchiladas they know what they are doing    I just about fell out my seat and rolled down them stairs after eating that meal. I WILL BE BACK 
Dos Salsas,29,I m surprised by the low ratings here. I ve been here twice now. Once when it was slow and this time when they were slammed. The food is good and the number of vegetarian options  including vegetarian rice and beans  is impressive. The food is pretty good. I can t say it blows my mind but honestly very impressive. My husband got the chicken tortilla soup. He used to get it every where we went but after being disappointed so many times he had stopped. I was surprised to see him get it here and he said it s one of the best he s had.   When it s slammed parking is pretty bad  would recommend someone get out of the car to get the the party signed up to wait while the driver circles to find a a spot.   The Mexican martini is great.   The atmosphere is a mix of karaoke  club and restaurant. The key is bc where you are seated. If you are right next to the stage  be prepared for loud music. That s where we were sat the first time. This time we were seated nearly as far as you can get and it was perfect. Good food  good drinks good music.  We came for my moms birthday and while it was a rough start with difficult parking. We walked away pretty happy. They gave her a fried ice cream dessert  a big hat and a birthday song.   Oh also  service can be spotty. The first time we came when it was slow it was pretty lackluster. This time the service was amazing.   Also  2 we noticed that this place is incredibly clean.
Dos Salsas,30,The name says it all. It s not that the food was bad  it just wasn t good either. The restaurant seems to be aimed towards WT PPL who do not season at home  nothing was spiced for taste. The salsa was bland  the beans and rice were bland  the taco meat was bland and the cheese enchilada was so tiny  see pic. It s on the right of the Tamale. The Margaritas were pretty good though. I asked my server if the Carnitas were made in house and was told they were made in house. I asked how they were considering I lived in Mexico for several years. I was told they are not like the ones sold in Mexico. I must commend her for being honest. If you are looking for basic Mexican Tex Mex spiced on the lite side  this place is for you.
Dos Salsas,31,Absolutely new to this butttt i am going out of my usual to write how awesome my experience has been. The place itself is beautiful. Verry welcoming when going into the restaurant. Eaten there a few times already Our server was awesome took verry good care of us hes name is Carlos verry verry good server but its always a pleasure to get to meet the person that has to deal with all 50 employees. Lord bless her heart verry beautiful young lady that has a million dollar smiles and personality we sat there and observed her take control of anything she could while helping others still manage to try and make it to each table to introduce herself i clearly remember her funny joke about her name YARI YARI YARI like the song. Guys have a good staff and the food was amazing. YARI recommended the tres leches cake as carlos was taking our plates out of the way and let me tell you. Thats an awesome team you have going there keep up the good work yari and carlos. Pleasure to meet you and become a new regular of the place. We loved every bit of it
Dos Salsas,32,I come here wayyyy too many times than I d like to say. When the waiters ask if I ve been here before  is that even a question..  My go-tos  Guacamole Dip  Tex Mex Combo  and 2  or more depending on the day  Spicy Margaritas with a chili-lime rim.   Guacamole  freshhhh. Literally  I could slurp the avocados  it s like they were picked from Dos Salsas  own private garden. I love a good sampler  which is why I always get the Tex Mex combo. The combo serves 1 cheese enchilada  a pork tamale  and a crispy beef taco. Lastly  SPICY. MARGARITAS. Need I say more 
Dos Salsas,33,Clean restaurant with a second floor - very big building.  My husband and I came out of our quarantine for some Tex-Mex food.    It was understandable but a bit odd that the menu had to be downloaded on our personal phones. With the pandemic though - understandable.  FYI  Bring a cell phone...  We ordered   Carne Guisada - my husband really enjoyed this  said it was one of the best dishes he had and he orders this many times when we go out for Tex-Mex Mexican food.   Dos Salsas plate - this is what I ordered. I had the refried beans with it.  This dish has some of my favorite foods  unfortunately I found it to be rather bland. I looked for salt but guess it was all put up due to Covid.  The beans were very bland and I did not enjoy them much. The rice was cooked perfectly well.  The enchiladas were a bit blah and the taco meat was not that good. To top it off  my dish was left under the heater a bit too long.  Chips and Salsa - chips were not stale but were fresh. The salsas both were bland - could have used some salt  spice and maybe something acidic.  House margarita - probably the best thing we had - I had out of the whole meal.  To sum it up  my husband wants to go back as he enjoyed it a lot  however - I need a little more flavor in my food.  You will have to try it yourself and form your own opinion.
Dos Salsas,34,This restaurant had such a wonderful ambience and the food was simply delicious   I ordered a Pina Colada and the El Favorito off their menu and have NO regrets   I highly recommend to anyone in search of tasty Mexican food.  Great ambience  food drinks  compliant and socially distanced various tables  all staff wore masks and made sure to clean tables adequately. Also  their Drink and Food menus have something to fit everyone s needs-the options are endless for which I was thankful  
Dos Salsas,35,Server was very nice. However if I was looking for underseasoned Fajitas and store bought tortillas I would make them myself. If you re after authentic Mexican this ain t it.
Dos Salsas,36,Never been here before  and man  what a great place to meet up with friends. Bartenders are great  the staff is wonderful all around. The decor is beautiful  the bathrooms are clean  the parking lot is large. The whole experience all around was fantastic. Can t wait to come back
Dos Salsas,37,I always love coming to Dos Salsas. I ve visited both the Georgetown and Burnet locations multiple times and neither fail to disappoint. The margaritas are delicious  the portions are generous  and the service is fantastic. We were celebrating a special occasion tonight  and Mark H. took great care of us.   We usually get the Dos Salsas plate and the vegetarian enchiladas. They have a huge menu  though  so it s worth exploring a little bit.   And- as the name would suggest- they give you dos salsas with your chips.
Dos Salsas,38,My friends and I use to come to Dos all the time. This time they said no.  The vibe isn t there anymore .  I can see why. The music is horrible. Other customers said it s the same ole karaoke person they ve had for ever with the same old out dated music.  I didn t stay long  very sad this place use to be amazing and do hip. Still good service and food.
Dos Salsas,39,The only good thing was the beer. Besides the disappointment with the food   it was hot and stuffy in there. The taco came in a taco shell and the flour tortillas were not brown enough. They were undercooked.
Dos Salsas,40,BEWARE of the classic over charge         This restaurant is in practice of bait and switch.  They have marked a price on both the website and physical menu and then once inside and ordered they jack it up  8 dollars and say oh it s a mis print.  The manager is like we can t fix this we have to wait so we are just telling and charging.  Classic bait and switch on the price.    I would not go back to this establishment.   I have attached the email and the pictures from website and menu for reference.  I recommend others to also pay attention to there bills.  Besides the pricing issues the service was sub par.  Things came out super staggered.  Chips and queso.. we got queso then in a second round got chips and salsa.  The food two of us got food and then 5-10 mins later the other two go their food.  Waitress didn t bring water until reminded a second time.    This restaurant and manager and staff are below the industry standard.
Dos Salsas,41,I ve reviewed this restaurant already. Right  Maybe it was the Cedar Park  location I m thinking of. Well here we go  I went to this Domain location on Burnet Rd. The atmosphere during the Pandemic was pretty cool. People were at the bar enjoying a cocktails and beers including myself while looking over the menu.   The service was pleasant and quick at the check in area and at the bar. Ice cold 16oz Modelo was delicious. I ve had the fajitas here before which I can recommend as well as any of the enchiladas. The items I have on the menu most often are each enough to make two meals out of.   The first plate I order almost every other visit is the Fermin s Plate. Two chicken enchiladas and a chicken tostada with rice and queso. Very good. The second plate I will recommend is the El Favorito plate. It s a combination of carne guisada and Puerco en guajillo meats served with rice and beans  tortillas and guacamole salad.   There it is. I usually get a plate I m familiar with when I eat here. The food is very tasty and you ll probably like it too. Have a beer or cocktail when you visit too.
Dos Salsas,42,Staying in a hotel in the area for business trip. Horrible meal. How hard is it to screw up a beef taco salad  beef at the bottom of the salad was colder than the lettuce. think twice before you eat there.
Dos Salsas,43,Went here last night. Food was okay  drink was ok. The green salsa that they bring out though was excellent.
Dos Salsas,44,The ambiance was great  Karaoke and drinks were awesome  Food sucked  The chicken mole was totally dry  So bottom line I would go back to have a good time but not for he food.
Dos Salsas,45,Their spicy margaritas are delicious  I can t speak for the food since I only had drinks but they were really good  they had enough alcohol but not so strong to the point where the taste was overpowering. I highly recommend 
Dos Salsas,46,We came as a party of 15 guest and had the most amazing waiter. Every order was fast  accurate  and the service was very polite. I highly recommend Carlos G. Thank you 
Dos Salsas,47,This place is packed  The wait is long  The only way we got in was because we had dinner reservations   I got the ceviche It was very good Except for the pepper that was in there  The heat was too hot for me   Now the Don Julio margarita was excellent and very generous   All n all I enjoyed my experience  It was a good place to celebrate my friend s birthday
Dos Salsas,48,I love Dos Salsas. I come here legitimately every single week and can t get enough of it. Their fajitas are incredible  amp  their salsas are great. The service here is outstanding. I have to shoutout Carlos for being an amazing server and always being so friendly. The only thing that would make this place better is merch so I can rep Dos Salas everyday.
Dos Salsas,49,This location was convenient as it was right next to my hotel. A very nice restaurant that is likely busy during non-COVID times. I ordered the chipotle pechuga. It was a really solid dish. Everything was hot and tasted well. I think to set it over the top  I feel that the sauce needs something extra to give more flavor.
Dos Salsas,50,Great food and service.  Really wish the music would be turned down a few decibels.  It s so loud we couldn t hear each other talk.
Dos Salsas,51,Atmosphere 5 Cleanliness 5 Service 5 Food 5 Likelihood 5 1-5  5 Best   5.0  I don t hand out 5 s that often  or easily.  It takes a lot to earn a 5 from me.  This was my first visit  it is NOW my FAV Tex Mex in Austin.  The greeting staff did a great job  the server was SPOT ON   There when she needed to be  and gone when she wasn t needed.   Restrooms were IMPECCABLE   The entire place was very clean.    The food  we all had various types of Fajitas  and they were hot  fresh  tasty  and not dry.    It really was an incredible experience.  I shared our experience with the manager  and tipped 30 .  Great job 
Dos Salsas,52,The service was not good. The food was typical Tex-mex food. Nothing to exciting. I asked our server for a cherry coke   and the server huffed and was disturbed by me asking the question. He said no  of course. Then my friend went to the bar and asked.  Sure enough they had the beverage. I totally get that some people dislike there job but please don t be in the food industry if your going to be rude to people.
Dos Salsas,53,I have mixed feelings. 3.5 stars is probably about right for now. The food was really  really good and the service friendly  but a couple things just werent quite right.   First  I ordered a bloody mary  because I love them and I order them everywhere I go.  It was just really not good. The flavor was meh  but the real issue was it was very watery. Most bloody marys are much thicker  and have much bolder flavors . I ve never sent back a drink. Actually I ve never sent anything back. I gave it a few sips and was going to just drink it and deal with it because I hate to complain  but ultimately I just really didnt want to drink it. I apologized to the server and explained to her it was very thin and watery. She took the drink back  still 95  full  and brought me a margarita which was very good and fresh tasting.   Moving on...the food comes. It was SO GOOD  I ordered the pechuga poblana based on pictures I saw from the other location s yelp page. I loved the flavor  and the portion was big enough for 2 meals. I commented to my bf that it didnt look like the pictures I saw though. He loved his burrito  and the salsas were both delicious.   And the finale...the check comes. THAT S why it didn t look like the pictures  They gave me pechuga Monterrey instead of poblana. Luckily I loved the dish so much that it s okay  but it s still not what I ordered. And here s the real kicker...I still had to pay for the bloody mary that I sent back full because it just wasn t made right. I m not looking for free stuff or handouts  but that just didnt seem right. Either way  I really didn t want to seem difficult or complain so we just paid for it and tipped well.   I will very likely come back because the food was so good and the server really was nice. Hopefully the next visit goes a little more smoothly though...I know they are new and probably have some kinks to work out. Just don t charge your customer for something that wasnt made well and wasnt consumed. I ll definitely update my rating if things are better next time.
Dos Salsas,54,Delicious  Very nice breakfast menu   has both American and Mexican food selections. Was a great balance for the family. No breakfast burritos to our boys surprise. Easy recovery due to menu. We enjoyed our meals. Servings were very large and super tasty. Service is always very good as well.
Dos Salsas,55,The food itself was probably closer to a 3 however the customer service bumps it to a 4. Everyone is always super nice and helpful. The reason I am giving it a 3 for food is that I was not a huge fan of the chicken enchiladas. The Mole sauce was yummy but the actual chicken was a majority of veggies than chicken. For someone who isn t fond of large chunks of tomato  peppers  and onions in their food  it was kinda icky. It felt more like veggie enchiladas than chicken. Not terrible flavor  just not what I thought I was ordering. Rice and beans were average and salsa was just okay. It was a little expensive  20 dollars for lunch for one person  so I m not sure I would go out of my way to go back.
Dos Salsas,56,This a very interesting venue  It is large  spacious  and popular  When you first walk in  you have to go up the stairs and then you see a gigantic room of tables. I enjoyed that it was on the 2nd floor because the windows were large with great natural lighting  The waiter was so polite and gave great suggestions  We came for Sunday brunch and arrived 30 min late for the brunch time  but they were still willing to accommodate our request for brunch food  The food was SO delicious in flavor and the portions are HUGE  I definitely recommend sharing a dish with someone  especially if you get chips queso. The chips and queso was smooth and also large in portion 
Dos Salsas,57,Eh  I wasn t very impressed with this place. The Tortilla on my burrito was a little hardened  the meat inside was a little over cooked and tough. I asked for tortillas because I love tortillas and I wasn t impressed with those. The only things that were good was the queso and the flan and the prices in general are little overpriced.
Dos Salsas,58,We live very close to this location so have come here quite a few times. Their to go option is very convenient and quick but doesn t give you good options if you try to go through a 3rd party app. If you decide to eat there  they can get very busy. The servers seem to work well together so it s typically easy to get anything you need. They also offer suggestions  Our favorite is memo s special but haven t gotten anything here that wasn t good. It s a little on the pricier side  but the portions are large.
Dos Salsas,59,Atmosphere  Great  Food  Awesome  Drinks  Spectacular  But the real star of the show at the N. Austin Dos Salsas  is bartender Alexia  i.e.   Lex   who  in addition to being the nicest  friendliest bartender we ve seen in North Austin in a long time  prepared what is likely the best margarita I ve ever had. She also knows how to pour a glass of whiskey  so her skills are all over the map    .  As a former bartender  I know what it takes to have the social skills to be a great bartender. Her social skills are excellent  and she serves with a million dollar smile  We will be back 
Dos Salsas,60,The food was really good.I had beef fajita ranchero and it was tender and flavorful.The drinks were great as well.It was a busy Friday night and service was a little slow but overall I had a hood experience.I will be back
Dos Salsas,61,One of the worst experiences in Austin dining. With the choices and great food in this awesome city I would recommend go anywhere else. We brought our sports team here and it took over 40 minutes to get seated while the staff pushed alcohol.  The food was poor and the staff worked hard amongst the chaos facilitated by non-existent management. Stay away.
Dos Salsas,62,Great chips and salsa  Also both the beef and chicken fajita tacos were excellent. Very tender beef  I really like their refried beans too 
Dos Salsas,63,Food is delicious. We had the fajita plate for 2. The service was good. Jenie is phenomenal  She is so attentive and kind.
Dos Salsas,64,I have been a customer of Dos Salsas since they opened in Georgetown years ago. The Burnet Road restaurant is great for groups and outdoor seating. The food is as good as ever and the service by Emmanuell was excellent for our large group. Congrats on this location.
Dos Salsas,65,Today at Dos Salsa   located off Burnet Road across the stress from the Austin  Texas Domain  I received the worst restaurant table service I have ever received. I arrived at the location. The second person of my party has already gotten sitters and ordered a glass of water. Ten minutes later  I go to the restroom wash my hand and return to the table  after stopping by the bar to grab myself and the lovely lady I was accompanying glasses of water. Get back to the table and the waiter or waitress has not come to the table or anything. I asked the partner do we even know who our server is  She replied    no.  After waiting a few more minutes  I asked my partner if she really wanted that water  She replied    yes  why   I told her let s get out of here. And we ended up at Taquero Mucho least than 5 minutes away and had an amazing time. Thank you Dos Salsa  your experience helps us have a great time.
Dos Salsas,66,All in all  the food here was pretty decent. Our waitress was kind  our food was tasty  the prices are reasonable. The reason for deducting two stars was the amount of maskless employees. Now  regardless of what others feel. Austin is stage 5. I don t feel comfortable where people can breathe on my food or whatever else could happen during preparation. The covid measurements were just not there and I don t support mindsets as such. If you don t give a rats a   and want decent tex-mex  this place is for you buddy  Will most definitely come back when things settle down.
Dos Salsas,67,This place has become our weekly spot  The gringos dip and queso dos salsas is a must have for our table. Our server Gustavo has hands down been one of the best servers we ve had. He s professional and upbeat. Our cups never go empty which is a bonus because the food can get a little spicy   We like to add the guacamole salsa to pour over our entree s  when we order from the bar it s usually the Especial Rita or the Plata Rita. And they have so many tequila options  so even building your own marg is a pretty cool option this place offers.
Dos Salsas,68,Great staff service.  They try to please  but the food   Mediocre at best.  This new place attempts trendy but misses the mark. The Cedar Park location is better. Burnet Road location parking lot is a crammed  disorganized directional nightmare.  I give this a  just ok. 
Dos Salsas,69,It s just bad bland food. I ve written two or three yelp reviews in my life  but this was so bad I had to.
Dos Salsas,70,This place is awesome I highly recommend it to anybody who loves Mexican food. However it gets pretty packed so be prepared to wait and I would suggest making reservations. One thing I love to have is shrimp cocktail it is delicious.
Dos Salsas,71,Food is good  but the music blaring makes it impossible to talk to the person sitting right next to me.  We re on the patio and the music is inside.  Don t understand the wanna be party atmosphere since it seems to be mostly families trying to eat.
Dos Salsas,72,We went back to Dos Salsas yesterday  during the 25  occupancy restrictions  and were enthusiastically greeted by and large and full staff.  The dining is huge  beautiful  and sadly  almost empty.  All of the protocols are being followed aggressively and yes  there is ample outdoor seating.  Our food was excellent  the ritas were perfect and the service was attentive.  Our waitress suggested that we try to add queso to the rice.  We did and wow  it was wonderful.  Of course  it is hard to image this queso not be an additive to any dish.  We can t wait until Friday when Texas goes to 50  occupancy.  We need Dos Salsas.  Please support your local businesses.
Dos Salsas,73,Racist ass waiters here  The waiter just brought chips and salsa and never came to take our order. After we mentioned it to the them everyone came to our table . Everyone one else that was not colored or Hispanic was taken care of even when they arrived after us   I would give this place a negative 5 . Being racist is not cool 
Dos Salsas,74,First of all  this place is so cool on the inside. Delicious and extremely flavorful food   Green salsa was tangy.. I prefer a creamy green sauce instead. Service at the bar was phenomenal. Social distancing was perfect and everyone abided by the rules. I had Tex-mex cheese enchiladas and the chili sauce was incredible. My friend had more authentic fare of Pork in red pepper sauce and it was nice and perfectly salty with a delicious rich flavor. The Guajillo sauce was excellent too.  Spicy margarita was SPICY GOOD  too   We will back to try the many other selections 
Dos Salsas,75,There s a lot to like here  but there are three reasons why I only rated this as A-OK.  Let s be blunt.  In Austin  to get five  or even four  stars  you have to perform almost flawlessly as a Mexican restaurant.  Dos Salsas here does a couple of things well.  With the exception of a delay in getting our check  the service was stellar.  In fact  the service compares well to much fancier restaurants.  Drinks were kept filled.  The food came out quickly and accurately.  There was management on site checking on things.  Even the hostess up front was pleasant and made sure we were seated promptly. And the decor and atmosphere are stellar.  Again  it looks and feels much more like an upscale restaurant than another Tex-Mex restaurant.  Here are the downfalls.  Like some others have observed  the parking lot is a challenge -- both in terms of finding the entrance and exit as well as the limited amount of parking available.  Next  the food is good  not great.  In fact  the biggest disappointments of the evening were the relatively weak red salsa and the chili gravy on the enchilada that suffered from a massive overuse of chili powder.  When combined with the rest of the meal being average Tex-Mex  that brings up the final flaw.  Namely  the prices are significantly more than any other Tex-Mex option in town  with the possible exception of Pappasito s .  I don t mind paying more for good food.  I do mind paying more for average food served in an upscale atmosphere.  Not a hard pass by any means  but there s better options for a lot less money.
Dos Salsas,76,Giovanni was excellent. On top of everything. Great service and very personable. Will come back and request his section.
Dos Salsas,77,Really good food. Service was super good. Think his name was Gustavo.  Had the lite plate and hubs had carnitas tacos.  Margs good and Mexican martini.   Saturday night is karaoke night. Very very loud inside. Fun atmosphere though.
Dos Salsas,78,Love the food and the drinks but we re here on a Sunday night and I have to say something.... they have a karaoke performer. HE IS SOOO LOUDD   I can t even hear my date. It over powers the food and so if you really don t want to connect with anyone you take here  it s a good choice.
Dos Salsas,79,Giovanni our waiter was very attentive and helpful. There was no wait and we had an enjoyable evening.
Dos Salsas,80,This is a new place here in the Domain area  actually right across the street from the Domain. This place is massive in size with an upstairs and downstairs dining area.  The staff was nice and friendly..  I didn t order any food so the judgment is still out of that part.
Dos Salsas,81,Pros   location  not much Tex mex in the area   spacious  plenty of seating and attentive staff  no wait for seating  ordering  food and check delivery to table   large tables to spread out  if you like to order appetizers  fajitas  dessert   quality  food  silverware  thick napkins   ample parking  valet parking in covered area available. There s a diverse menu. They re open for breakfast  too.  We ordered queso  nachos  and fried ice cream that rivals Pappasitos   Two Salas  red and green  were brought with light  crispy chips. The salsas and beef fajitas were mostly natural flavors so not a lot of spice or heat.  Some people might call the flavoring bland. We loved it though.  Cons   full parking lot that is compact and a little difficult to navigate
Dos Salsas,82,The food was great  the margaritas hit the spot  and Giovanni was one of the best waiters I ve ever had 
Dos Salsas,83,The food was good  except for the super thin queso. The drinks were bad  they tasted sweet and pre-made. I liked the large menu that included many healthy  amp  low carb options. The salsas were delicious. Overall this is a decent Mexican restaurant  but nothing to call home about.
Dos Salsas,84,This has been the most highly anticipated new restaurant in the area for my partner and I for three reasons  We are HUGE Tex-Mex and Mexican food fanatics  it is very close to our house  and it is in a HUGE building so we have watched closely as this Tex-Mex compound has come to life on Burnet road next to Top Golf  opposite the Domain.   Okay I ll cut to the chase  we had high hopes for this place and it only sort of delivered. The salsa is so-so at best  I liked the texture  not too chunky not too soupy  but the flavor was sort of bland  not spicy at all  and they refilled it at the table with those syrup dispensers you sometimes see at Mexican restaurants which isn t the most appetizing. There is a green and a red  spoiler alert  those are the Dos Salsas  if Dos Salsas is your name  salsa should be your game - I was disappointed.   In contrast  the frozen house margarita with salt was the star of the show. The texture was perfect  not too icy not too slushy  just right. The flavor was very citrusy sort of lemon leaning and the boozy taste was also just right - you can tell that it s packing a punch but in a way that is very pleasant and drinkable  so much so that I had to have a refill    The food was tasty but came out cold. The service was pretty awful  slow and not knowledgeable  and when we asked if we could do beef  amp  chicken combo fajitas  our server looked at the menu and said  No I don t see it on here  y all... that s a pretty standard and very doable dish given that every other imaginable fajita iteration was on the menu. I opted for the beef chimichanga instead. Good flavor but like I mention  it came out cold.  Overall  I love the spacious atmosphere  think Gloria s but not quite as upscale but more expansive . Would be great to rent the place out for Quincea eras or an office holiday party. They also have a really fun looking bar area that is lit with purple-ish pink lights which I appreciated.   I would be willing to give this place another shot because I really want to love more than just the margarita and it is brand new so maybe they are working some kinks out. I ll likely only ever be back for drinks if there s not dramatic improvement to the service  salsa  and food temperature on my next visit... Otherwise  it s Dos strikes  you re out   See y all at the purple-ish pink bar 
Dos Salsas,85,As always we had an awesome meal at Dos Salsas. Our food came out quickly and tasted delicious. Our server Gustavo went above and beyond to make sure we had a good experience. I would definitely recommend coming for delicious margaritas  fresh food and friendly service.
Dos Salsas,86,Love this place. I think I am a regular here already. Food is great and they serve big portions.  The prices are reasonable for such a elegant place. I was skeptical to go thinking that it was pricey but Daim I was wrong.  Did I mention the entertainment  at night  with salsa dancing. Wholly molly... watch out Gloria s   there s a new sheriff in town.
Dos Salsas,87,This place was so gross. Everything was dry and they served me barely any chips. I would not recommend this restaurant and I would recommend Taco Bell. Their drinks are delicious and this places drinks are flavorless.  I think the taco bell mtn dew and cravings pack is so much better than everything here   
Dos Salsas,88,Amazing food warm well season queso was delicious the frozen Rita was bomb   told my server to pick the best one he did a awesome job   He was really nice very polite attentive to our needs never once asked for a refill he was in top of it amazing food and drinks an a great  server Were definitely coming back  And if ur in the area by dos salsas domain ask for Emmanuell to be your server .
Dos Salsas,89,Service was amazing  The staff was great with my whole family  They knew how to treat us right and our server was very polite and always checking if we needed anything. Food was delicious  I recommend to anyone that wants fine Mexican food.  Once again awesome service  For sure will come back 
Dos Salsas,90,While I m a big fan of Dos Salsas  the Cedar Park location seems to be way more consistent. I have eaten here twice within the last few weeks and it just wasn t the same. The most recent was last night  and we got it delivered. The fajitas that I got were just so under flavored  very similar to the time before   the restaurant. I enjoy Dos so much normally  I will probably try em again before I make a final decision about this particular location. Maybe it has something to do with staffing and pandemic issues.
Dos Salsas,91,By far the best Michelada I ve had in Austin. The chips were homemade  always a good sign.
Dos Salsas,92,Good food  portion is relatively large  cheap drinks  1 dollar mimosa refill and to go cups . Super quick and friendly staff
Dos Salsas,93,Dos salsas is the place to go if you are looking for an entertaining dining experience. Mark H was the best server  he was so accommodating and helpful. He recommended the sour cream sauce for chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend loved it. Great tortilla soup also. Mark H was a terrific server and really made the night great.
Dos Salsas,94,I love that they have zucchini noodles   There were dirty finger prints on my silver ware though and it grossed me out. We won t be returning.
Dos Salsas,95,Worst service ever  Sat there for 20min no one ever came to our table to even take our drink order. Witnessed another couple put in their drink order within seconds of sitting down.
Dos Salsas,96,i love this place. happy hour  amazing. chips  crisp. salsa  sauced. live music  cute. i like this place    especially for fajitas.
Dos Salsas,97,The food is good. Drinks are average. Service is horrible. Our waiter never stood still when taking our orders  he was always running by and we had to yell what we wanted. I ordered a drink and our waiter literally said   but you haven t finished your current drink  . Three girls at the hostess stand didn t greet us when we walked in. The entire staff looked like they didn t want to be there and acted as if we were a burden. The food wasn t worth the experience. Do yourself a favor and go to Casa Chapala or Lupe Tortilla.
Dos Salsas,98,Great authentic Mexican as well as tasty Tex-Mex dishes. Add in top notch margaritas and you ve got yourself an amazing night  no matter the occasion. Ask for Giovanni and your cerveza will never be empty. Salud 
Dos Salsas,99,Muy mal servicio fue el que brind  el manager William al negarnos una bebida solamente por que a su parecer no se encontraba sonriendo en la foto  siendo que en un pasaporte mexicano official te piden no sonre r  que mala manera de dar por excusa  al final tener que revisar la identificaci n m s de 3 veces me parece un poco imprudente  espero y esto no siga pasando
Dos Salsas,100,I don t know that I will ever have a picture to add to this review because the food is so delicious we start inhaling it immediately. My husband loves the beef fajitas they always prepare them well done as requested  he says the refried beans are the best he s ever had. I get the shrimp Diabla with no cheese and OMG SOOO GOOD. Realistically enough for two meals but it usually doesn t make it past that night at my house. It s light it s fresh steamed veggies are excellent. We will continue to come back often. Immanuell was our server and he took excellent care of us  
Dos Salsas,101,Fantastic food  I finally had a chance to eat here.  During covid  they DO have dine in service at this time.  I ordered for lunch the enchiladas suizas and an iced tea.  A very decent sized salad was first.  It was very good and fresh.  The enchiladas were divinity personified.  The black beans well done  seasoned just right with the perfect amount of cheese.  The rice... just yum.   and I almost never eat very much rice on these plates . The salsas had a nice flavor  not too spicy.  The only thing that wasn t 100  was the tea.  The first glass tasted a bit old  but the second glass was just fine.  I can t demerit them over a single cup of tea.  My waitstaff  Krysten was very attentive and polite.  My total bill was just over  16 so it s a bit on the expensive side -- but OhMy... it s worth it.  The place was extremely clean and the women s bathroom was extremely clean as well.    ON a side note   As others have said  finding their parking is a bit weird.  YOU HAVE TO ENTER AT THE APARTMENT ENTRANCE from Burnet Rd  then turn immediately right going behind the building.  There is no other way.  There s plenty of parking  but make sure you don t go all the way down to the apartments or try to go through the other business parking lot next door.  There is a small covered parking lot area  and a huge lot uncovered  enter via outside door near the fountain on the building  amp  take the stairs to the 2nd floor.
Dos Salsas,102,The lettuce on the taco salad tasted either like cleanser or floral perfume. The rest of the food was only meh. Either way it was not a good flavor and ruined the experience along with waiting for a long time for somebody to notice that we were there even though they were not busy. I get that they have pick up orders but still. I will not be back. And TMI  terrible gas this morning after eating your food.
Dos Salsas,103,Best Place for Drinks and Food. My waiter Angel was the best also    100 10 Food was the hood and the environment was also very nice. Definitely will come back to visit again.
Dos Salsas,104,Let me just say  I am normally not a fan of Texmex. Most places don t appeal to my New Mexican taste. But Dos Salsas is a refreshing upgrade. The food is well seasoned and has a kick. There are good selections that I don t normally see in the Texmex restaurants around town. However  my real review goes to our waitress Caitlin. I can honestly say that she provided the BEST service we ve had in a long time. She was friendly  attentive and checked on us just enough to make sure we had what we needed despite it being a super busy Friday night. We will be back and hope to see Caitlin again. She deserves a raise  A  service 
Dos Salsas,105,Very good experience first time being there very good vibes. Would recommend it to anyone kid friendly also .
Dos Salsas,106,Wish I could review food and drinks from Dos Salsas  but my bf and I were never served so we walked out.   We sat at the bar which was not crowded by any means. There s a nice open air patio that wasn t open for some reason - sunny weather on National Margarita Day seems like a huge missed opportunity  We could only sit in the upstairs area where the vibe is kinda tacky with bad lighting.   Bar service was literally non-existent. We watched the bartenders serve everyone around us while we waited - zero eye contact or a simple  hey we ll be right with you . A server dropped off some chips and salsa but the salsas didn t taste great and were really watery. After being ignored for sometime  we cut our losses and left.    Service  and ambiance severely miss the mark for what Domain area establishments typically uphold.
Dos Salsas,107,Let me start with this place is awesome  they have elevators in case you don t want to used the stairs .The waitress are friendly   The place is clean the food is really good and the drinks yummy
Dos Salsas,108,I was so excited they opened a new location here by the domain   I went in yesterday and it was amazing. It was clean and the waiters where super friendly. I am considering going again today because the food was amazing  There s so many good places for Mexican food in austin  so you gotta love the real authentic ones 
Dos Salsas,109,Went to eat there Saturday night- parking lot waaaay full- EXCEPT for an ENTIRE section of like 20 spots that were saved for valet parking. Why the hell does a Mexican  restaurant need 20 spots of valet parking   The valet parking guy told me he d charge me  7 if I parked in one of those 20 open spots  so I asked him where I should park  but he had no clue.   They lost my business before they even had it.   Poor planning dudes  You built this huge building but didn t plan parking well at all.
Dos Salsas,110,This place was great for our first time  working just next door at a local neighborhood bar  we watched this building shoot up and weren t too excited seeing the big building that looked so corporate. But after spending some time inside and getting to know the amazing staff and management this is an essential stop before or after a shift   Foods great  inside is very clean and efficient feeling even if it can be a little overwhelmingly busy  but that s technically never a BAD sign. If you get a chance get you a plate and order some drinks they ll come quickly  they ll be strong  and bonus it s one of those places where they leave the shaker   After dinner you can head out or you can head downstairs to the bar which is a great time  they have DJ entertainment and I took it as a personal compliment the DJ would take my request   Haha   For a fun time - check it out  
Dos Salsas,111,There s nothing bad that I can say about this place everything is excellent and nice clean welcoming environment
Dos Salsas,112,We came here on a Sunday night and they had live music... it was so fun and lively  The food was amazing and the whole staff was so friendly and attentive. The whole place was so spacious  didn t know they had 2 floors. We will be back 
Dos Salsas,113,Excellent variety of menu choices. Very good tasting food.  The food is appealing and generous. Awesome frozen margarta flavor choices. The service was outstanding.
Dos Salsas,114,This was just an overall disappointing. The waiter could not for her life get our order straight. We were party of 5  very simple order with no changes. The check came out all wrong  my food with my friend s drinks  charging us for things we did not eat  but not charging us for things we did eat. The food was easily overshadowed by this experience. Honestly I cant remember if I liked the flautas or not.
Dos Salsas,115,I don t recommend this place. The food lacks flavor and that goes for the salsas too. We were a group of four and all of our food was lukewarm. The server kept forgetting things and would get irritated when she was reminded of things she forgot. Regardless of the service the food is not good and it s pricey. I will not return here.
Dos Salsas,116,I m giving this place a 5 star to offset the BS low star reviews. I m tired of things like parking being accounted for in judging food. I had bacon wrapped shrimp with vegetables  wife had  Memo s special adding bacon and cheese. Very good. It s for sure at 4 star place  we sat outside where nobody else was and still had fantastic service and great recommendations on both meals.
Dos Salsas,117,Giovanni was the best waiter  He was super nice and quick with all our requests  He did great 
Dos Salsas,118,I had the pechuga relleno it was really delicious  thank you to our waiter Giovanni that took care of us very well
Dos Salsas,119,Great place to eat breakfast  lunch or dinner      Food is always fantastic   Giovanni was an awesome waiter       Definitely will be back   
Dos Salsas,120,Love the interior  and location gives you another option  around the burnet area. The food is great and the service is just as good  the bartenders are friendly and helpful. I ve been a frequent customer since they ve opened. Every Saturday I love the drinks and music...although I disagree with the management    I ve had my receipts  checked several times from thinking I m receiving drinks for free  after the fact I ve paid my tickets in full. I ve even had the owner and his family circle around me like fresh meat in the ocean to sharks  even go as far as stand behind me and stare at me all night. As uncomfortable as it is I don t know why but I still enjoy coming every week to enjoy the food and drinks. I would hope in the future that the management recognize loyal customers rather than drive them else were to other domain establishments.   
Dos Salsas,121,Terrible service. Have been there twice and both times I ve had an awful experience with the service  The first time we got hurried up to get out and were made to feel like they were ready for us to leave after we finished our meal. Keep in mind  there were 8 of us there and we were all still ordering drinks and part of our party was still fInishing up their meal Friday we gave it another chance and again sat at our table for 20 mins before anyone came and took our drink order. Waiter never came back to refill our  waters. Had to wave him down to ask for water refills and to ask for drinks and food.  I m sorry  you built this beautiful place with great food and not enough servers  You will not have repeat customers if this keeps going like this. Gave you 1 star for the food
Dos Salsas,122,Food and service were great. Even during this pandemic  nothing to say negative except that it is easy to miss the restaurant when driving in since there is no sign to indicate the entrance.
Dos Salsas,123,Loved loved loved this place so much. Happy hour  GREAT   My waitress was stunning beautiful  amp  her service was ridiculously incredible  She had more tables she had to attend  amp  when I will see her she always had a smile on her face. Never was rude  always smiling. Her name is Noemi  amp  I will make sure to get her next time I go. Thank you so much Noemi for such amazing service 
Dos Salsas,124,My very first time here and I m glad I got noemi as my server. She was very patient with my friends  amp  I. Her charisma  amp  attentiveness made it a great experience for us.
Dos Salsas,125,Beautiful new location.  Gorgeous new decorations but not too cheesy.  It was clean.  It s two stories and big enough for a banquet or even a wedding.  There is even a stage for live band or a newly wed couple.  Very versatile.  Service was great. We had dinner here as a team and shared a fajita platter along with queso.  The queso is good.  Not the best I ve had but not bad.  The fajitas were delicious.  They had a good drink menu with a good variety.  My friend got a spicy martini and she loved it. Margaritas there are above average.  I would go back and have dinner or happy hour here again. Normally  I don t eat the mints but they had a good creamy mint I had to go back to ask for more.
Dos Salsas,126,This was the worst experience I have dealt with at a restaurant. Bianey C  didn t seem to have a care in the world of how disrespectful she came off. She took half of the party s order  and then started tending to other tables. Half of our party got their food  ate  got to go containers  and there check  and the other half of the table still were waiting to put their order in. and Bianey didn t have a care in the world. Im so fuckin pissed at this level of service. I ll never come here again.. EVER... This is completely unacceptable and I have absolutely no understanding for such disfunction. This completely ruined my experience for someone who was dying to try this restaurant  and I ve always been willing to give the benefit of the doubt but not tonight.
Dos Salsas,127,Nice lunch specials. Sat at bar unfortunately the bar server to busy with side work and didn t give us good service at all   Had to as for refills on drinks chips salsa if we could find him.  The food is delicious. The clean up crew on top of plates out of your way.  Not bad for first impression.
Dos Salsas,128,My daughter and I tried Dos Salsas off Burnet Rd for the first time today. We won t be back. We each ordered different meals and after the first bite  we looked at each other and said way too salty. My cheese enchiladas lacked cheese inside and just had a sprinkling in between the two. I gave it a 2 rating because we were seated within seconds of walking in and the meal came super fast. The waitress never came back after setting our plates down. We needed more water to counteract all the salt. Nope won t be back.
Dos Salsas,129,Service is good  everyone is very friendly  which is expected from a new restaurant. We shared one entree  steak a la mexicana  and it was very good  portion was big enough to share with someone.   Downstairs bar only serves a few appetizers  music is louder  seems it s the  party part  of the restaurant. They have to work on their guacamole      Upstairs is the dining area with a larger bar that serves the entire menu. Will be back.
Dos Salsas,130,Excellent menu with good variety. Food is always great.  Talented bartenders.  Really good tequila selection. So glad they opened up on Burnet
Dos Salsas,131,Oh my this place is quite amazing  The drinks to the meal to the promptness and accuracy of the service has been refreshing 
Dos Salsas,132,Great food and great service. The fried jalape os were delicious and the fajitas for 1 were perfect for my wife and I. I will definitely be back.
Dos Salsas,133,The Enchiladas Texanas was very good.  I liked the decor.  The server was attentive and polite.  I will be back to try other items on the menu.
Dos Salsas,134,Dos Salsas is sooooo delicious   I love their soup and flautas and the margaritas are always yummy  Our server Alyssa was attentive  highly recommend 
Dos Salsas,135,The food is great. The drinks are hit or miss. The service is subpar. The management is oblivious to customer service. The management does not address the issue of  poor service and just ignore you when there s an issue. When I asked to speak to a manager the hostess spoke about me in Spanish because she assumed I didn t speak Spanish. I would say pretty rude. I ve been many times to eat because  again  the food is great. The management and service have me looking for another place to eat.
Dos Salsas,136,Our server Alyssa was great. We were a party of 7 and no one thought the food was great. Only one of us thought the salsas were good. It s was OK but it wasn t anything I ll go back for  The margaritas were just Ok too  There are a lot of Mexican restaurants with much better food than here.
Dos Salsas,137,We ve been to Dos Salsas for Dinner a few times and we absolutely love it.  The food and drinks are amazing and the service has always been great.  It has become one of our new favorite spots for dinner dates on Friday night.  Highly recommended 
Dos Salsas,138,I just left this place. I will never return there again. My colleague asked for cheese enchiladas the waiter replied  cheese enchiladas  and got one beef and one chicken. I ordered the pechuga poblana. First I wanna say if I m paying 16.00 for a meal I want a whole chicken breast not a sliced thin piece of chicken   paper thin . That says to me you are cutting cost and customers are paying for it. I asked for beans the waiter replied   refried   I said yes please. I got rice which was the only thing good on my plate. Everything else had no flavor. Everything was bland. I was very surprised at what a large menu they have and the one thing I ordered was so plain. I thought it would be better.
Dos Salsas,139,Jared was my server and gave me excellent service  He was so great     My food came out amazing and quick very yummy. Got the chicken ceaser salad with an ice cold topo Chico. 5 5
Dos Salsas,140,Generic  flavorless  spoiled and expensive. Almost  70  for 3ppl  with no alcohol  2 3 having water  and regular priced meals. They wanted  22 for chicken fajitas. Seriously      12 for a  lite plate   which was a taco  an undercooked enchilada  a scoop of spoiled  brown guacamole  and about 2 tablespoons of queso. Basically  for  12  I had a taco for dinner. Seems like this place is making up for the location  in the pricing  and ready to take advantage of unsuspecting visitors  or people from The Domain. On par with Taco Cabana  but Taco Cabana has better food  salsa  and tortillas...and way cheaper. What a disappointment.
Dos Salsas,141,We were pretty excited this place opened up right next to our complex but boy was it disappointing. It s hard to mess up Tex-Mex but none of the food we had was good. We started with some queso and this was like queso you d get in Wisconsin - certainly nothing you d expect from Texas. We had the barbacoa plate and burrito americano - kinda gross if you want to know the truth.  The only good thing was actual building itself. Kind of weird to see Chive TV everywhere  though.   The drinks were ok.   There are WAY better places for Mexican in the Domain.
Dos Salsas,142,Mariela is wonderful as our server. She remembers our Vegan order each time and is a delight  Not to mention great food 
Dos Salsas,143,The food was ok but the chips tasted old and needed to be thrown out. The hostess seemed to resent seating me and sat me way back where the kitchen door was. I think this is a place where you pay for atmosphere instead of good tasting food.
Dos Salsas,144,Coworkers and I went for lunch the other day  and left in agreement we probably won t come back again unless it s for drinks at happy hour.   We didn t get our chips and salsa until shortly before our salads came out  after having been told 3-4 times they were on their way. When you sit down at most places  they re on the table the minute you re seated  but not here. We ordered food and they brought the side salads out  which are basically just bowls of iceberg lettuce and carrot strips. You might get lucky and see a leaf of spinach in there. When we started running low on chips  they took our baskets away and said more would be right out  they didn t come until we were almost done with the entrees . The guacamole was bland  and most emblematic of the overpriced food Dos Salsas has to offer. The tacos we ordered were slightly better than cafeteria food  definitely not worth  12 a plate  at  lunch special  prices . Pick another place to eat.
Dos Salsas,145,I m giving this place two stars. One for the nice building and the 2nd for the iced tea. This place was a total disappointment  Great location across from the Domain. Huge  nice  new restaurant but such a shame service was terrible and the food was less than mediocre. Waited a long time to be seated because of lack of communication  between the downstairs hostess to the upstairs hosts. Was never greeted upstairs and several people were sat ahead of us. Get to our table and waited longer just to take our drink order. Took forever for our food to arrive. We had to ask our waitress for everything. Service was slow  Pricey and Food was bland. Will not be returning and do not recommend this place.
Dos Salsas,146,Very disappointed  after 15 years of coming to the restaurant  to find someone decided to change the queso. The new stuff I just picked up is no better than a jar of tostitos. I will no longer be coming to the restaurant as this is extremely disappointing.
Dos Salsas,147,I have been here twice and it s excellent  The staff was amazing and their suiza enchiladas were outstanding  and the Bryan salad that came with plantains  which was amazing and the portion was huge   The salad was Enough for three meals   Probably going back today for lunch 
Dos Salsas,148,The food was terrible. I ordered a keto option which was the chicken fajitas with a salad and veggies. The salad was just clumps of iceberg lettuce. The veggies were definitely from a steamed bag  I couldn t even eat them. The chicken was decent but it was chopped up into a million pieces which made it difficult to eat. It wasn t really seasoned either Our server was very kind and the venue is beautiful but the food is awful.
Dos Salsas,149,Me and my bf have been dying to try this place out since we saw it being built. Finally last night we saw it had finally opened  It definitely looks really fancy on the exterior and inside is ..  fancy  by cheap means. Their tables and chairs alone.. just cheap. I don t care if it s cheap when the food is great but that wasn t the case. The first thing I ordered was beer and when I received it  it was kinda chilled but not cold at alllll. I then asked for a cold mug dressed and when I received that it was also barely chilled and not dressed. Moving on to the food.. AVERAGE for  14.99. I go to Gloria s for the same price and the food is the best. The salsa that came with the chips was really gross. Everything seemed like it was store bought honestly. The scenery is their attraction. If you re looking for really good food and cold drinks   go up the road to Gloria s at the domain.   I don t work there I m just a foodie girl  lol 
Dos Salsas,150,Great Atmosphere  Great Martinis  Awesome Awesome   food HIghly recommended  Thw wait staff is excellent and efficient.My favorite drink Mexican Martini is excellent.
Dos Salsas,151,Great service and great food. I m very happy that that there is now a Domain area location.  I love the barbacoa tacos.
Dos Salsas,152,Came here for a late lunch  ordered the chicken fajitas with cheese. My co worker and myself were both doubled over sick by 4-5pm. Never go here.
Dos Salsas,153,We stopped in here on our way out of town. We enjoyed it. Good tasting food  great service  good company. We had the Tex-Mex Combo and the Enchiladas Texanas  carne asada . The tamale was moist and tasty. The carne asada was nice and tender. I m baffled by the bad reviews. They certainly don t deserve them. We will go back the next time we stay in The Domain 
Dos Salsas,154,Sergio is AMAZING  We have been going to Dos Salsas in Cedar Park and tried the Burnet location for the first time. Gotta say  kudos to our server for his awesome service 
Dos Salsas,155,Came for happy hour here the other night and it left a lot to be desired.   There was no where to park for starters as the amount of valet to non valet spots were uneven. Which didn t make sense because we didn t even see a valet outside.   Walked in and it was pretty dead yet the place was huge.   We sat downstairs at the bar. The bar snack options were all just dips. Nothing to gush over. The drink situation however had me all sorts of feelings. The first round we got a Suprema margarita and had it asked to be made with Silver tequila instead of gold since I have an unsettling reaction to gold - which we mentioned to the  bartender. She switched it to silver yet never told us there is a  2 up charge. We didn t even change tequila brands. Then the second and final round I asked for just the house and didn t see to remind her about switching the gold to silver since I d made her aware and no one but her friends she was entertaining were at the bar. I m pretty sure she made it with gold as I ve been unwell all into the night. She was more interested in entertaining her friends than serving us.   Next time I ll go upstairs and try some food and hopefully come back to edit this review with a new perspective.
Dos Salsas,156,We love Dos Salsas. All 3 of them  Our server Laura was great  Food was amazing as always 
Dos Salsas,157,Will not return.  Horrible layout  I sat downstairs at the bar that only serves five overpriced appetizers. I ordered the jalapeno poppers  they were not warm no flavor served with a random dipping sauce.  Music was loud bartender allowed people to smoke on the patio with the doors open.  I will not be back 
Dos Salsas,158,The tradition continues   It s our favorite restaurant in Georgetown and they delivered the same great service  food  amp  atmosphere at their new Austin location  Easily my FAVORITE family restaurant chain  
Dos Salsas,159,The food was decent but not great for the price. I got the tex mex combo and my boyfriend got the chimichanga. I believe both were priced at about  13 each. When I got mine I had to ask if that was the tamale  as it was tiny. The girl said yes  they got their tamales from another company. Seemed odd to me for a Mexican restaurant to do that. I wouldn t go back.
Dos Salsas,160,This was our first time visiting this Dos Salsas location and everything was fantastic  Love how large the space is considering our current climate. Service  food  and atmosphere were great. We will definitely be back. Definitely recommend the mexican martinis and guacamole enchiladas  Yum 
Dos Salsas,161,Let s start with  cannot order from menu at lower bar. Really   Chip  amp  queso only. Give my name to guy downstairs for table upstairs. 30 minutes   not yet . 35 minutes   your table is ready . He didn t tell us  wife asked. Never called  texted  or tapped my shoulder sitting at the bar  telling us our table is ready. Go up stairs  my name is crossed off  5 people ago  but got seated. 25 minutes now  still haven t received a glass of wine  amp  Bacardi sprite. Wife just said   I m about to walk out of here . Chips are light  amp  crispy. Red pico is robust in flavor  I do like the zing of the green salsa. Got drinks     28 minutes from the time we sit down. Mine is wrong. Something very grody on the fork  see pic. Restroom very nice with warm water. Chip guy is on point with refills. Chips not warm upstairs  they are downstairs. 20 minutes since we ordered....yes  this is in real time. Not really busy and it s a Sunday evening. All rightfood 21 minutes. Looks pretty and of course   hot plate  . We like chili gravy  it s ok. Moving it to 2 stars. The other couple with us having fajitas are not impressed. This gives us a good reminder perspective of the difference of good and not good Mexican food. This ain t good. Not going to make me sick  but for the price point and wait  there are better.  Much better. We had to try the place  debatable if we will be back  just to go to the downstairs bar. All 4 just voted no. Wife says 1 star  group consensus is 2 stars. Domain pricey without Domain quality.
Dos Salsas,162,Unacceptable welcome at the grand opening. Came to have a nice dinner and dancing with my sister who is from out of town. Even though it was an hour before the event indicated they would be checking ids  11pm   they turned us away. The hostess insisted they always check ids at 10pm  even though it was the grand opening and the event page listed otherwise. She didn t budge even when I proposed we dine downstairs away from the music area. Very elitist and unfriendly.
Dos Salsas,163,This is a really nice restaurant in a great location but finding parking is terrible. Plan ahead for parking and your experience will be much better.  Management should advise customers on where to park  1 star. The food was good  4 stars. The service I thought was excellent  waitstaff was quick and attentive  5 stars. Please fix the parking situation as this could be a very  good restaurant by the Domain.
Dos Salsas,164,If you love mild flavorful Tex-Mex this is the place for you. My husband and I came here for our  Sun-date  I know cute right  We enjoyed every bit of it we ordered the Gringo dip for appetizer  amazing  I had the stuffed pechuga  bomb  And he had the Parillada  also bomb  We both had swirl mango strawberry frozen margaritas which were super tasty as well. Our server was super sweet and our food and drinks arrived promptly. We will definitely be back 
Dos Salsas,165,Great food and service.  Very fresh.  Love their salsa. Has become a Friday night tradition. One suggestion.  Get paper menus.  Internet connection poor and hard to bring menu up on phone.  Will keep coming back.
Dos Salsas,166,I have to say I ve came to this restaurant a few times the foods always been good the service hasn t been bad   but today . Today 3 21 2021 I went to have dinner with my boyfriend around 7 30 8 00 pm sat at the bar   ordered our food. Waited enjoyed the music watched a little tv it was all going smooth    until our food arrived . My boyfriend asked the girl that was helping us that worked behind the bar I wish I would have got her name because I would have so put it on here . He asked her for some hot sauce and I don t know what got into this girl that made her think it s was okay to say   no   no you can t   in a playful way trying to be funny or something it almost seemed flirtatious  it was just plain UNPROFESSIONAL and disrespectful. Why would you do something like that let alone in front of someone s partner your working your job is to be polite and get your guest what they need she didn t know us. I just don t understand what made her think it was okay to do that. Management needs to get to the bottom of this I m thinking she might have had a few drinks in her or something for her to have made such a bold move. I don t think we will be returning to dos salsas at least not to sit at the bar to enjoy our outing .
Dos Salsas,167,The bar area not following proper Covid policies. Complained but was ignored. Two older men with no masks ignored the policies with no mask on 8 25 20. Went to the restroom they took my seat they laughed at a far and I was greeted at the door to leave. Do not go to this place  Terrible management 
Dos Salsas,168,I went Friday morning and Menlin was just the best  Gave me and my boyfriend the best service  Loved it  Definitely going back  
Dos Salsas,169,I didn t like the service at all    The waitress took forever to notice us we were there waiting for 15 minutes for her to come she seemed a little bit confused she was nice but everyone seemed so lost our food took long and they weren t busy the restaurant wasn t even full. The food started off good but the dessert had a different taste which I didn t like at all. It was our first time going there I expected more   
Dos Salsas,170,Went there on a Saturday around 2 00.  Not busy.  Sat at table for 15 minutes and never had a waiter greet us or take our drink order.  We just walked out.  This is the second time we have tried to eat there.  Won t ever go back.
Dos Salsas,171,Great delicious dinner and Emmanuel was a fantastic server  Highly recommend Dos Salsas  
Dos Salsas,172,Food was OK  a waitress  dumped a full tray of food a few tables over  accidents happen  however  when they cleaned it up they mopped the floor with bleach  the smell was ridiculous.  People all around had to cover the noises the smell was so strong  totally ruined an overpriced dinner.
Dos Salsas,173,We LOVE the dos salsas in Georgetown. Went to the domain location for a birthday dinner and the menu is the same and the place is nice but my server was a nightmare. I am noticeably pregnant and ordered a shrimp cocktail. Shrimp cocktail is safe to eat while pregnant FYI. Anyways  I ordered my food and my waitress didn t voice any concern over my order  however  after I began to eat my waitress came up behind me and said  should you be eating that    with a horrible look on her face  I was really confused at first and tried to laugh it off and said  yeah I can eat this  and she AGAIN said  BUT SHOULD YOU  You can eat it this time but next time I WON T LET YOU ORDER THIS  EXCUSE ME      She acted like I had a shot of tequila.... it was insane. Also  if she was truly concerned she could ve mentioned something BEFORE she put in an order for a nearly 20  meal  that was NOT worth it . After we were given the check  my husband made a joke about ordering some raw shrimp to go and she snapped at him. The whole ordeal was uncomfortable and embarrassing. We will NEVER be back. Oh ya...they also can t make a bean and cheese taco if you try to order one for your child but they can bring you a plate of beans and a tortilla. The service was poor but to mom shame and belittle your customers....IT IS NOT OKAY.  Poor shrimp cocktail  especially for the price  and the unsolicited advice and the bullying was extremely uncalled for. Do not recommend at allllllllllll.
Dos Salsas,174,Food is good  not great.  Have had much better at Casa Garcia s and for a much lower price.  We went for lunch  11.99 for one meal   had 2 meals  water to drink  no appetizer or dessert and bill was a tad over  30   that did include a 20  tip .  Too rich for my blood for the quantity and quality of the food.  Service was prompt  and parking  well  it s been covered in other reviews.  Very disappointed.  Doubt that we will return.
Dos Salsas,175,Great salsas  chips  queso  amp  guacamole to start  I have not a bad meal at this small chain in 20 years. The new location on Burnet is over the top. Great service  DJ with great tunes on Friday and Saturday and great band and dancing on Saturday nights upstairs 
Dos Salsas,176,We have been to the Georgetown original location and the food was just as good but it was soooooo loud that my mom had to wear ear plugs and we couldn t even have a conversation with our party of 5. We had to yell practically to each other. There was super loud salsa music playing as well as just overall loudness. No bueno. Won t be back.
Dos Salsas,177,This is probably the best Mexican resturaunt I ve ever been to. The plate was very beautiful and so delicious. A little pricey  but thats what you pay for a place of this luxury. They also have a lot of uniuqe things on their menu most mexican resturaunts do not. 10 10 would recommend.
Dos Salsas,178,Well I will have to say this is the most American Mexican restaurant in town lol. We try as many Mexican restaurants  as possible and although dos salsas really does not have a great reputation   I was hopeful  that they would try and do better at this location.... NOT     So we get in and it s obvious not a mom and pop real Mexican restaurant   large two floors and the seating is somewhat  odd. Tables real close together   we get greeted quickly and asked for drinks. We order teas and guacamole   and view the menu. So it s an OK size and it sound good but you will see that is just a jeti mind trick. We get chips and salsa that is mild and kinda bland nothing authentic  about it  tea was still hot and ice melted. We order the seat Ranchero fajitas   mushroom  quesadillas  when we get the food we had to ask 3 people before we get a refill of our drinks.  They are not very attentive  and it s just ok service from waiter that has an accent and a slight attitude  I m Latin as well  fyi  so don t expect too much. So like I said the guacamole  was bland and basic not worth  money for sure so you should pass  the quesadillas  was OK not enough filling and mostly the taste of the whole wheat tortilla so you have to dunk in salsa also is bland . So the main dish was the worst... the meat was tough and way too fatty  I had to spit out several pieces that we not chewable  the ranchero sauce was too liquidy and not much flavor. They top it with enough cheese so that is all you taste  obvious  a technique to hide the lack of flavor and not so tender meat. I have to say that there are way better mexican restaurants  like casa chapala which is 10 better with table made  guacamole  and super tender beef fajitas or lupe tortilla who is second  to casa.Overall there is nothing that should bring you to the place unless you don t have a car and live next door  the atmosphere  is like Olive Garden and although they have 2 large bars   I suspect that the drinks are over priced as is the low quality food but not sure indont drink. I gave them a 2 star only because they have a way cool painting of austin  as you walk in on the second floor but that is still a stretch.  In closing I wish we would have went to casa chapala  this was the worst 50 dollars I have spent on food in a while.
Dos Salsas,179,Placed a to go order for lunch on a manic Monday. I thought today is a good day for takeout  I ordered a kids meal beef enchilada  a pork tamale on the side  a large queso  and the cheese enchiladas meal. What I got was a pork tamale meal with queso all over it  I m assuming they misunderstood my request   a beef enchilada plate  not the kids meal  and a cheese enchilada on the side. Now if you work  you know you have time just to grab pay and go  so I get back to work and my coworker who I ordered the food with  was like what is this  I look in the bag and realize nothing is right. I said hey no worries  just eat the food   but I don t eat beef. I said just be open minded  It was tough and rubbery. I was so disappointed. My coworker didn t want queso all over her tamale so she of course was not happy. I paid  38  b c I felt terrible for her and didn t feel she should have to pay for food she didn t order. So finally I built up some courage and called them  and was told that I was going to be forwarded to a manager who would take down my complaint. They forwarded me to a voicemail where they never returned my call. I will update my review if they ever do.
Dos Salsas,180,I saw this place get built in my area thought it would be a good decent to go eat. But let s first start off with parking   the parking is not good I feel like they could of done better. I seen a few cars having trouble getting out because it was to packed and wouldn t let people out. When I first walked in I thought I would be getting greeted but nothing. The girl sitting down in the chair was on her phone. Could have better guest service tbh. The atmosphere is very nice I loved it but to me your paying for the atmosphere not food quality I had MoMo s special or something like that. It was a good decent size plate but the meat was dry same with chicken the onions  chili pepper where not even grilled it look like it was just tossed on the plate. The rice is a good position same with the beans but I do feel like the plate should of came with cheese and sour cream. I had to pay extra for sour cream witch was  1.50 for two spoons fulls and  1.00 for a small amount of cheese for 2 tacos my one thing I will give a good feed back is the margaritas they where very good and strong I would come back for drinks but food I don t think I would the salsa wasn t even spicy it just tasted like blended tomatoes with water the green salsa tasted like water down tomatillo no flavor from cilantro or onions.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,1,UMMM  excuse me   What a lovely surprise  Jefes has amazing breakfast tacos    Was I influenced to order these by watching a taco tv show  Yes.  Did I shamelessly order these after already eating breakfast  Yes  Do I normally find chorizo overly salty  but not this time   Yes  Do I judge all breakfast taco places on their humble bean and cheese taco and did Jefes rock it out of the park   Yes   Was I SHOCKED to see  2 breakfast tacos in 2022    Yes  Was their green salsa just as great than my fave  do a  Yes    Don t sleep on this place. Crazy soft corn tortillas. Highly recommend a Chorizo and potato taco 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,2,When I order nachos with beef fajita meat I know I m going to get a meal for two. I ask for jalape os and verde sauce. I live a few blocks from their location and by the time I get home everything is melded into an awesome Mexican mix of ingredients to kill for. It s been a very long time since I ve had a better meal. I also love their burritos. I wish they were bigger. I would pay more for a California burrito if they were to introduce it. The bigger the better. Anyway. This is my neighborhood favorite.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,3,I love living down the street from Jefe s  the food is great  and everyone is really nice that works there. The food is packed with flavor  good portions and reasonable prices. Thank you Jefe s for serving our community and keeping us well fed
Jefes Tacos & Catering,4,I got the enchilada plate to go and they didn t receive my online order until the time I picked up so I recommend calling. The enchilada plate was a little pricey but I enjoyed it with their salsa verde. The staff is fun and I like how close this place is to me.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,5,What a deal   Authentic tacos for the right price  Have to give this place a try  Please be patient this isn t fast food  it s great food 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,6,Some of the best breakfast tacos I ve had in a while. I got the chorizo and egg  and bacon and egg taco. Oh and the salsa verde is spicy. 10 10
Jefes Tacos & Catering,7,Best tacos  Breakfast lunch and dinner  Oh and their guacamole   Amazing   Love the green salsa  
Jefes Tacos & Catering,8,This little restaurant hit the spot on a Thursday morning breakfast run  We had barbacoa  pastor  and carnitas. That red sauce is hot- still stuck on the side of my throat  cough cough  and the coffee in the mugs was that little extra touch. Totally recommend 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,9,I found this place in my neighborhood  Unassuming local place. The breakfast tacos are amazing. The verde sauce is what it s all about. Great price  always very good 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,10,I stopped by on a morning to pick up some tacos and must say  this place is super authentic   The prices are fair   2 breakfast taco and  3 taco for the jefes   There are other platters and larger taco specials for more  but I didn t get to try them.  They cook it fresh and add plenty of meat  The tacos are pretty sizeable  larger than the ones at taco deli. They even have a little condiment bar with like 7 different sauces and also tomatoes   Excellent service and awesome Spanish music.   Will be back soon for more 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,11,Ok  so I ve been on a roll with finding some pretty good Mexican cuisine spots this week  I came here in a bit of a rush during my lunch break and ordered a chicken taco plate to go  I only had 10 mins and they came through  The tacos were fresh and delicious  and the salsa bar  with little to-go containers  was an added bonus. The rice and beans left a little to be desired  but at about  8 plate  which included 3 tacos   rice and beans   I couldn t complain much. I ll be back to try more 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,12,Sad to say that this place was not boss. It was fine  don t get me wrong. But in a city full of tacos I just don t know why you d go back here. Healthy portion sizes and good prices. Maybe its a solid choice if you re in a pickle and happen to be standing right there.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,13,For the 1st time in like  life  I didn t get a picture         I had  50 worth of food. So many pux to take. And I got none. Once I unwrapped everyones plates back at the office  togo order    The.  Room. Was. Silent.  Thats how hard it went.  Get 2 of EVERY sauce too. Omg. The lil salsa bar. Its a gold mine.   I got a pure veggie taco freestyled  and Im in love. Potato  avocado  lettuce  tom  cilantro  beans  no animal . THEY WERE FAT  Winning    Everyone loved their gorditas   Tacos  chicken  beef steak.   Customer service was STELLAAARRR. I KNOW my order was a pain in the ass  but they smashed it.   Everyone said theyll never go anywhere else. So  theres that.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,14,Stumbled upon this gem by accident. If it s Your first time  you might try the Taco Pastor. 2 for  5. I ll be back with others 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,15,This is probably one of my favorite spots for Mexican food. It is kind of a hidden gem out on Lamar. Their enchiladas are to die for. So tasty and fairly priced. The staff is also friendly and helpful with menu questions. I recommend their enchiladas Suizas  but their breakfast tacos are also delicious.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,16,I literally made a near two wheel turn into the parking lot just to avoid missing this lol. I ve been craving breakfast tacos for 2 days now and saw a sign. Must stop
Jefes Tacos & Catering,17,Truly amazing  We found this shop coming out of the DMV trying to figure out what to eat  and like a light  this placed shined. We were greeted by the owner who was very kind and offered us great suggestions as to what to get since it s our first visit. We got the family platter which offered a perfect way to sample everything and even our picky eater enjoyed it. Would definitely be back and recommend to everyone to come and visit.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,18,Street tacos are my jam   We stopped by for a quick lunch and got some carne asada and al pastor tacos.  The meat is good  the salsa is stellar but their tortillas are eh. They aren t bad but they aren t good.  I m also picky coming from San Antonio where all tortillas are made in house.  So for a quick and easy lunch-yes.  Taking guests to blow their mind   No-head to Las Trancas instead.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,19,We contracted with Jefes to provide food for our son s college graduation party with 70 people. They were easy to plan with  were timely on delivery  amp  set up  and the food was delicious. We will return to Jefes for any future catering needs and look forward to frequenting their restaurant. Rogelio was a pleasure to work with.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,20,Love their breakfast tacos which are delicious  large and cheap. Also they have a great salsa bar with over 10 varieties and I pretty much love them all. There is a good number of tables inside and it s clean so don t let the fact that its next to gas station dissuade you from coming here.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,21,I actually live like a 5 minute walk away from this restaurant and it s definitely a great place to stop by for breakfast  I always get the breakfast burrito  I think it s like  6-7  and it s huge  the tortillas taste handmade and the food is delicious. As others have mentioned  the salsa is a little spicy but honestly I think it s amazing. If you re looking for the normal tomato flavored Pace-like salsa you won t find it here. I haven t tried any lunch options because the hours are so weird. Literally the only time I can even stop by to eat at this place is on Saturday because Sunday they re closed and every other day they open when I m already at work and close at 3PM  this is why they lose 1 star . I ve even had a few attempts when it s listed as being open and it was closed. Go figure.  Regardless  stop by for a breakfast burrito on a Saturday 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,22,We were the only patrons when we arrived on a Saturday morning. Had decent though not outstanding tacos. Very much mom and pop and kids. Not bad  just not special. Fairly dour service.   Where do we find special  Are we expecting something that doesn t exist 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,23,If you re looking for authentic Mexican food  this is a great place to visit. It is family owned and their tacos are awesome  please try this place at least once. I can tell you it does not have a big dining room  but it is worth trying. The cashier was friendly during my visit and very attentive. Location is not great  I would suggest it for to go orders though and maybe catering also. But the food is what makes this place stand out from the rest of the Mexican restaurants around the Austin area.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,24,Great family owned and operated restaurant in the North Lamar Airport area. Even after living nearby for years I ve yet to grow tired of it  as every item on the menu is pretty great. One thing they have that really puts it over the top is an amazing salsa bar. Their green sauce puts Taco Deli or Tysons to shame  The atmosphere is super comfy and the employees have never been anything but friendly and helpful on any of my visits. They ve recently extended their hours are are open later than some of the info you will find online says.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,25,Good street tacos served fresh and hot and great hot sauces as well. Friendly staff and reasonable prices make it a must try place.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,26,This review is for the Taqueria Jefe restaurant  not their taco stand up the street on Lamar  amp  183.  I had lunch there today to see if it was just as good as their taco stand up the street.  My memory was a little blurred due to a few beers then  so I wanted to make sure my taste buds were not easily fooled.  I m VERY glad that I made the short trip down the street to grab a bite.  It is exactly as I remembered   The bistec tacos were really tender and the home made red salsa was spicy  but not too hot.  They add fresh cut onions and cilantro to their tacos  this really brings out the flavors really nicely.    This is what Mexican food should be  simple and fresh.  Taqueria Jefes is turning out to be the real  Jefe  of tacos in my neighborhood.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,27,Holy moly I love Mexican food and this place is good  Best homemade flour tortillas  the scrambled eggs  amp  beans are yummy    I m very picky about beans man  some Mexican places just give you brown goop with no taste  not Jefes  I really like Jefes Mexican food. Support local family restaurants 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,28,Was just driving and even thought the hours on the door showed they were closed  they weren t.  They just started being open evenings.  I tried the barbacoa and carne guisada.  They were both good.   They serve a well stuffed taco for the money.  In the words of Arnie  I ll be back.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,29,Hi. Today  I and my friends walked into this place looking for good Mexican food. We were utterly astounded at the quality of the food here. The chicken fajita tacos were superb  the bistec  steak  quesadilla was amazing  and the steak tortes  like a burger   were simply to die for. Would recommend to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,30,We wound up at Jefes because everything else is closed on Mondays.  I had the cheese enchiladas.  They weren t the best  weren t the worst.  Decent pricing and quick service made this trip pleasant.  They are next to the convenience store.  I wonder if breakfast isn t better than lunch was.  The salsa bar was pretty bare the day we were there.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,31,I ve been looking for a divey  Mexican joint like Jefe s. I m glad my boyfriend and I stopped by for lunch. We arrived at the end of the lunch rush and there was only one other patron in the restaurant. This kinda made me nervous and I second guessed if the quality wasn t too good but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was really tasty and I cannot believe their lunch entree plates are only  6.99   This is a great deal for how much food you get. I got the pastor and my boyfriend got the barbacoa. It specifically stated on the menu that the barbacoa was made with beef cheeks and from how much fat was marbled throughout the meat  it looks like they were telling the truth. Each entree came with beans  rice  raw onions  A LOT of cilantro  o amp c were piled on the side  and a choice of flour or corn tortillas. The pastor was really well seasoned and lean. The barbacoa also had good flavor but even though fat was marbled through  the tops of the shredded meat were a little crunchy. It made me think it was sitting under a heat lamp drying out  not saying this was the case but it crossed my mind given the texture. Not a big deal and my boyfriend loved it but I was happy I got the pastor instead.   Since we were the only people in the restaurant  we were served quick with drinks and our food. There is a salsa bar but I found that the house salsa that comes with the complimentary chips was the hottest out of the bunch. If you are sensitive to spice  you might want to try something else because the heat definitely snuck up on me.   All in all a great little divey place for cheap  good Mexican food. Its what every neighborhood needs and I m glad I finally found this for my  hood.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,32,This place is located in a small shopping strip next to my local gas station. I don t usually buy food when I m stopping for gas  but I had visitors in town and we were fueling up the car to take a trip out to Hamilton Pool. We wanted to get on the road and needed a quick option to fuel our tummies as well  Enter Jefes. I ordered a variety of tacos. They were all good  but my favorite ended up being the bean and cheese taco. The lady at the register seemed a little surprised to see me in there. It seems like a joint that is probably frequented by the same clientele. I saw a lot of people hanging out who seemed like they might be regulars. That said  I didn t feel uncomfortable and one of the regulars even gave me a suggestion on which salsa I should try from the salsa bar. It is easy to forget about a place like Jefes because it is tucked away  but that makes it a good secret spot  amp  keeps the line short  One of these days I will remember to stop there again.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,33,Rogelio has been catering an annual party of ours for years. He is always timely with very tasty tacos  chicken  beef  brisket  pastor   rice  beans  guac  etc. He brings everything you need and serves up your custom taco as you desire.  Pricing is very reasonable and he and his crew are a pleasure to work with.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,34,Me gusta el coche cucaracha   Taqueria Jefes is a little taco bus parked in the edge of the parking lot of a corner store and laundromat near 183 and Lamar. The dining area is one small picnic bench right in front of the window where you order. They have supercheap tacos...the barbacoa taco I had was excelente  but the pastor  not so much. I saw a couple people ordering tortas to go from here  so that s what I plan on trying next time.... glad I found this place  now I can stop going to taco cabana late at night  this place was open at midnight  which is awesome
Jefes Tacos & Catering,35,Having been a loyalish Tamale House patron over on Airport  I was sad that they closed and there s a serious void they ve left in the cheap breakfast taco game.  Seeing that I work about a block or so from here  I ve had my staff get tacos from here so it planted a seed in my mind.  I ve had their breakfast tacos here on multiple occasions.  Bacon  Egg  amp  Cheese  Potato  Egg  amp  Cheese and Chorizo  Egg and Cheese.  One positive is that they stuff them full of fillings.  One negative  it s inconsistent.  The first time I had the chorizo  it was dry and bland.  Everything chorizo shouldn t be.  Recently though  I gave the chorizo another try and it was PERFECT.  Perfectly greasy and dripping with pork fat.  Droool.  Another positive is that you can call in your orders.  It s pretty great to just pop in  pay and leave.  They also have a salsa bar that you can help yourself to.  Solid choice and legit.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,36,Tried shrimp cocktail but it was very appointing. It is just not good and expensive. I deducted one star because of that
Jefes Tacos & Catering,37,I ve been getting gas at the Shell station across street from Jefe s for years and noticed this little hole-in-the-wall many times  but was just never inspired to try it.   when I finally did  the first visit started off a little on the sketchy side...it s not the most inviting place on the outside and when I stepped inside  it was very dimly lit and there was no one in sight.  I wasn t even sure they were actually open for business. I almost turned around and left  but ended up going up to the counter...  read the menu for a couple of minutes and finally a nice Mexican lady appeared. altho her English was about as good as my Spanish  we managed to order some tacos al pastor to go. if you re a pastor fan  their version will get high marks. I grew up on the border and these are the best I ve had.  they have a fairly large menu  but I haven t tried anything but the pastor and a side order of refried beans...the pastor is so good  just haven t wanted to experiment with anything else yet. they have a salsa bar with several very tasty versions available.  taco prices are quite low    2 each   but they charge for home-made  extra thick  tortilla chips and salsa  so with a couple of tacos  chips  and a drink  you can spend  10 for a moderate lunch. which isn t really all that bad considering.  the place is a family-run business and everyone has been exceptionally friendly so far. I try to get there at least once or twice a week now.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,38,I am not a fan. Told them nothing spicy but my mouth was literally on fire after eating taco. I don t think they understood and should have gotten quesidillas or breakfast taco   
Jefes Tacos & Catering,39,If you happen to need breakfast  a beer and some new car insurance  Taqueria Jefe s is your place    If you hang out long enough  there is even a pool hall bar next door     One stop shop   I was feeling boring though  so I just had the breakfast.   A decent selection of Mexican classics like Migas  breakfast tacos  burritos  heuvos rancheros  etc.   All at very reasonable prices.   The migas are only  3.99 and are in reality probably enough food for two.   Breakfast burrito was also huge and quite tasty.   Make sure to ask for the red and green salsas from the fridge - really good.    Huge breakfast  we couldn t finish either  for two plus 3 cokes was out the door for  12.94 plus tip   The decor could stand for some improvements  but is fairly typical for a place like this.  It seems reasonably clean.  Bonus - they are open Sunday  which is more than I can say for my other usual breakfast taco spots in Central Austin.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,40,I still need to visit the actual restaurant  but if their food is a fraction as awesome as the food from their cart just up the road  they ll still count as  amazing.    I first found this place one night after having enough drinks that I was DEFINITELY in the mood for tacos  but I had just moved to north austin and didn t know where to find the best ones. So  being a scientist  I drove as far north on Lamar as the plentiful taco carts seemed to stretch and made the same order at each - 2 tacos al pastor  I figured just a single one might be a fluke . As it turned out  my last two tacos of the night  also my last two for the month - eating 10 tacos was not my best idea... Even if it was for science  were hands down the best. Since then  I ve moved out of the area  but these tacos are so good  I ll even drive down from round rock at 2 am just to get some  Damn cravings...
Jefes Tacos & Catering,41,Small clean high quality interior  Mexican food. Fantastic tacos  especially the barbacoa.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,42,Great place  Salsa bar with pickled carrots. I really enjoyed the carnitas tacos. Very affordable. Glad it is in our neighborhood.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,43,This is possibly one of my favorite places to eat  ever. I ve celebrated much of the menu and never had anything that wasn t  totally bangin   they are fairly priced  the salsa bar is awesome and the service is great.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,44,So  I work at a hospital and we get food brought to us. ALOT. One of our vendor peeps brings us breakfast tacos from this spot. I freaking LOVE them. I think the tortillas are awesome  and they are a good size  not too huge  but also not the dinky little taco you get at Taco Cabana. I really like the salsa. I have never been to the actual site  so I can t speak to the ambiance etc.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,45,I found this little restaurant while searching for breakfast around noon last week. After realizing Galaxy cafe  Taco Shack  and all the surrounding fast food joints in the area were no longer serving breakfast I stumbled on this tiny Taqueria. The breakfast tacos are 99cents for 2 ingredients and a good size. The best part is the salsa which is the Valentino type salsa with a green jalapeno salsa and a smokey red one as well. I will definatly be back.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,46,I just moved to the North Lamar neighborhood four days ago and have already had breakfast here three times. It would have been four  but on Sunday they were closed because they were going to be selling at the farmers market. The waitress already knew who we were and told us where to find them. The next day we came and ate breakfast tacos agan  and she told us her boss told her she shoulda let us in an gave us some tacos  Freaking awesome. I m a huge fan of their salsa bar  they have my favorite do a style jalapa o sauce that s to die for. My favorite taco is the bacon  egg  cheese and potato. My boyfriend is a fan of the chorizo. Great place  great owers  great waitress. Good thing our new rent is so cheap because I forsee a lot of tacos here in the future.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,47,Jefe s is kind of hidden behind a service station on N. Lamar  so I didn t even notice it till I was taking a walk  but it kind of had that look of one of those hidden treasures you mostly find in shopping centers full of  for lease  signs. I m always intrigued with little hidden restaurants like that.  -   So I kidnapped my parents and forced them to try it with me. When we drove up  my dad was very dubious and thought it looked like a sleazy bar restaurant from the outside  but by the time we left he was joking  isn t it lucky that  I   as in he  suggested we try  this place   Really excellent food  decent prices  and good quantity.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,48,Most amazing taco plate  My face almost melted off  but then I cooled it down with an ice cold margarita. Thanks jefe. You really are the boss.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,49,This is a wonderful family run taqueria with excellent  inexpensive breakfast tacos  menudo  and tortas.  I m not a fan of their al pastor  but the tongue  chorizo  beans  and chicken are all good.  Their red and green salsas are wonderfully spicy.  They have beer  and get a mix of clientele.  Definitely  authentic  and NOT Tex-Mex.  A plus.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,50,This place could be just another cheap divey taqueria  but for one thing  the amazing green salsa.  There are 3 kinds of salsa on the table  and the green one here is everything I could hope for - tangy  garlicky  the right amount of spicy.    That said  I sort of view everything else I ve eaten here as a vehicle for the salsa getting to my mouth.  The egg platters were huge and really quite good  and mine came with an excellent tortilla that semed homemade.  The breakfast tacos were ok  but nothing to write home about - I d stick with the platter next time.  I haven t tried any non-breakfast items here  but it s definitely on the agenda 
Jefes Tacos & Catering,51,best breakfast tacos i ve had. the chorizo is yummy  not too greasy and flavorful.  taquitos rolled tacos were crunch and filled with shredded chicken. gordita had lots of  fillings  and was not too greasy and nicely fried. tacos were street style with lots of onion cilantro on the side.   the salsa bar was nice  and the red chile and green sauces were amazing. sides of refried beans and rice were ok  but not the focus point of the meal. staff was friendly.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,52,There main restaurant isn t a roach coach  and is located at the location listed on yelp.  Good chicken tacos  but a bit salty.  Tasted almost like panut oil and reminded me of thai chicken  pretty tasty.  They have the orange and green jalisco style sauces which are good there.  I think it was around  6 a plate for lunch.  I d go again.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,53,Not very good. Meat was full of gristle  and the fajitas were weirdly bland for Tex-Mex.
Jefes Tacos & Catering,54,Great breakfast tacos and lunch food.  Awesome salsa bar.  I just wish they were open earlier Sunday so I could go more often.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,1,All I have to say is... the food is GOOD DELICIOUS    I totally recommend this place     
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,2,After a night of drinking I needed some kind of soup  Came across this gem and ordered the fideo and OMG  it was delicious and it hit the spot. Service was just as good. Definitely will come back when In Austin
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,3,Service was awesome  5 stars  from getting seated to getting our food served quickly to getting water refills and all. However  the food generally lacked seasoning and was light on the meat. The salsa was spicy and tasty but the queso was oddly sweet. There s good parking.   I don t think I ll be back given the Tex-Mex options we have all around Austin.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,4,Hello World    I arrived at Los Comales on 7th Street with every expectation that it would be a good meal. I ll make this short  Since my visit was cut short. I sat down near the back wall and the place looked very clean  amp  the decor was nice. My waiter greeted me an took my order  I ordered a sweet tea  1 crispy beef taco  Chicken Mole with Rice and Beans. Simple enough right well that s what I thought too. Unfortunately my tea came to me unsweetened  no problem I just added a package of sweetener. Cool   Then my food came out  I tried the Refried Beans first and they were burned  I called the waiter over and let him know the beans are burned  if I could have double rice  and to let the cook know so he could prepare a new batch for the other customers. At that time I asked for corn tortillas. So the waiter took my dinner plate into the kitchen and returned with double rice. I waited for the tortillas because I eat my crispy taco wrapped in corn tortilla. When the tortillas came I ate the taco which was good tasting  I then cut into my Chicken Enchiladas and discovered they were made with Beef  so I called the waiter back and he said the Chicken Mole is  17   ok but I asked for chicken mole. I said  I ll try it  I don t know Beef Mole was a thing  so I tried a bite and it was not something I liked at all  so I told him  I don t like that  I d rather have the Chicken Mole   it is what I came for. So he took my plate back into the kitchen  then the cook refused to make my food apparently the Cosin ro is also the Owner his name is Eddie. I asked for the Owner to come to my table  So Eddie approached my table  He didn t want to shake my hand to great me at my table  he acted like a real a-hole  I explained to him that I just wanted the food I ordered and so what s the problem. He told me to leave that he wasn t making me anything because I complained about his food  that if I wanted a Chicken Mole they would charge me double because I complained. It s not a mystery why this place is empty. They don t know how to treat customers properly. As I was leaving I  asked for my check to pay they refused me service  at that time another cook started trying to argue from behind the old bar area they converted into a cooks line station  I want to be clear on who Eddie is and his job title  turns out he is not the owner he is the Brother inlaw of the owner  the owner is a lady name Jasmine. I would not recommend this place  There are far better options. It s fine I write my reviews I m an Austin Original  I have 35 years in the restaurant industry  I m a 5th generation restauranteur  my family has owned and operated restaurants in the Austin area for over 100 years. I think I know what I am talking about when I let the kitchen know they have burned the refried beans. It s shameful that they treated me this way  I hope my review can prevent other people visiting my beautiful city to avoid this establishment. Hope they close up shop so we Austinites can get something good in its place. I hope this helps narrow your choices. Try Joe s Bakery  for breakfast Ask for Olga or try Juan In A Million  for lunch  Ask for Juan
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,5,Been a bit since we visited...a long bit but this visit really hit the spot...service was stealer as there were only 2 servers and one was also the bar tender...they were hustling for sure...as usual we get chips  salsa and Queso...last time we were here the salsa was severed warm...which we weren t a fan of...this round though it was chilled and spot on with a bit of heat and with a couple scoops added to the Queso the apps were bangin ....Wife switched it up and ordered the Chicken Flautas with double rice...they were crunchy  tasted great and huge  ...I went the same route with Chicken Chiladas  refried and rice...our granddaughter has graduated to the adult menu and went with Cheese chiladas  refried and rice...again with the rice..fluffy and flavorful...the Wee one and I really liked the beans..Food was hot and on time  ..Really great visit this round 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,6,We live nearby and we love this place. The service staff is always super nice. We get vegetable fajitas and it s so much more flavorful than other places. The complementary chips n salsa are delish and the drinks hit the spot. They used to have breakfast tacos ready to go in the mornings as well.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,7,If you re thinking about getting the quesadilla  get the quesadilla  It s huge and all the textures and flavors are just right.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,8,Great find in east Austin.  Local eatery.  Salsa was amazing.  Fresh and handmade.  Chicken fajitas burrito was spot on.   Not you everyday Tex-Mex.     Support local Austin and try this place 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,9,Love it here     Customer service is always super friendly  whether in person or on the phone they always answer their phone and while the prices in Austin are going up it s not so bad over here..delicious food    They also put salsa and chips for takeout which I love.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,10,I m Mexican and know good Tex-Mex  I ve been coming here for years  mostly for their great Lunch specials that offer a number of options. The food is good for the price and the service has always been topnotch.  With that being said  I recently had a small mix-up with a to go order and when I called  they were closed but  the owner manager answered the phone and promptly stated she would refund the full price of the meal. When I noticed that it had not credited to my account  I called back and the Owner stated she would refund   AND gave me a Lunch plate for my troubles of going back to restaurant. WOW  Great food AND Customer Service 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,11,Somehow we only recently just discovered this place  and wow have we been missing out. What an East Austin gem  If you are craving good Mexican food and a casual meal don t overlook Los Comales.   When they say they ll serve you food that tastes like your grandma made it they mean it. It is so delicious for a very affordable price. And the happy hour is hard to beat. I can t wait to come back often 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,12,Food was amazing. Drinks were great. Service was excellent. I definitely recommend the margaritas. They have many different flavors. I also recommend the al pastor.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,13,Seriously one of the best spots this side of town to eat  I ve tried several meals here from fajitas to tacos and I ve never been disappointed  The staff is also some of the friendliest you ll encounter.  If you want some made from the heart great food from wonderful people then this is the spot for you 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,14,First time and the wait time was amazing. Happy Hour House and new Margaritas were great. I got the appetizer nachos to feed four. Fresh guacamole  Fresh Salsa  and delicious drinks. Definitely Recommend Awesome food For Groups and Large Family s.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,15,Good tasted great    Pretty authentic Mexican food. Chips and salsa crisp and spicy. Shrimp cocktail had great flavor and spice. Chicken Monterrey can only describe with one word .... YUMMY. Chicken was not at all dry nor bland. Waitresses was very sweet  polite and swift. Cozy spot to eat at. If we are ever in Austin  will definitely come back.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,16,Just discovered this east side gem a few months ago. As someone from San Antonio I m pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food and this place certainly does not disappoint. The rice and beans were the first thing I tasted that I knew would have me coming back. My personal favorite is the  Delicious and Tasty Pollo Chipotle   it definitely lives up to the name. The prices are crazy affordable  especially for the quality and quantity. They have a great outdoor patio that s perfect for enjoying a margarita at happy hour. Excellent in all aspects.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,17,Hands down  best Mexican food in Austin Tejas   Its like we traveled to the homeland  Yaaaaazzzz.  I had the beef enchiladas and it was yum    Do your belly a favor and try it and they also have the beer in the XL margarita drinks too 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,18,I can t even give any stars I paid  20 for this it s cold its old and tastes like rubber  I m not exaggerating not one ounce   I know delivery has to do with it being cold but using old black avocados and burnt rubbery chicken is all on the restaurant. One bite and it s garbage chale    Enjoy the photo  How do you plan to stay in business serving up this kind of food that belongs in the fast food world of junk  
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,19,DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT             One of the workers here  found my phone  when I had lost it  like 10 miles from the restaurant in my neighborhood by the way  and was going to  figure out how to get it back to me  when she got home. She said she couldn t read and only spoke spanish  which I speak as well  but if it says  Lost Phone  on the screen with a phone number directly below it and makes a loud sound every 5 minutes you should know what that means  The workers all started defending her rather than apologizing to me. I may not have been a customer but they all treated me awfully. I finally left the restaurant after a bit of back and forth arguing and two of the workers FOLLOWED ME OUTSIDE where they CONTINUED to scream at me     I could have called the police based on their actions alone even if my phone hadn t been taken.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,20,I m pretty impressed every time I go to Los Comales. It s solid Mexican food that never has a wait  has good options and consistent food  and has some of the friendliest servers    I live close to this place and would definitely consider it my neighborhood Mexican restaurant. I need a place close to me and Los Comales fills that crucial void perfectly. I d love more parking  but so far it s not been a deal breaker. They are also on Uber Eats  so you can get it delivered and don t need parking at all.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,21,First time here and was really excited to try out the chips and queso. When it was time to pay I noticed that extra charge. I wasn t given notice that a second serving of chips was extra. Disappointed unfortunately.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,22,The food here is solid Tex Mex with some straight Mexican food mixed in.  Service is super polite and accommodating.The chips and salsa are fresh  with the salsa being not spicy at all. Horchata is hands down the best I have ever had    The water pressure In ladies room sink needs fi
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,23,This is my local Tex-mex restaurant. It s nothing fantastic  but the staff is friendly and the food is alright. Their margaritas and not great  but they are cheap.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,24,A friend brought me here for lunch and I must say the tacos and the chips and salsa are great. Salsa has some kick to it that livens up the palette.  The tacos are simple  meat   onions   cilantro on a freshly cooked tortilla. I got a barbacoa and an al pastor - both are superb  with flavorful meat - taste unobscured by other toppings.  That said  my stomach wasn t that happy with me after lunch and thats why I m knocking the stars off. Can t tell what it was but definitely wouldn t mind trying again - maybe just a one off.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,25,Given that I have been going to Los Comales for about 10 years.  I enjoy the fact that their menu is is very well made and all the foods depicts north central Mexico.  Chelo the waitress is very warm and very responsive to you needs and always offers to get you more of what you need.  Please visit the this establishment before you try other Mexican restaurants.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,26,Amazing food in a friendly professional old school traditional atmosphere. We are going to make this a regular spot  Already went back twice for the d-elicious fish tacos 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,27,The people who run Los Comales are great and the queso is swell.  The rest of the menu is bad and expensive.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,28,If you have a soft spot in your heart for hole in the wall Mexican this place could rise to 4 stars - however  Austin is to hole in the wall Mexican what Tokyo is to sushi - and in light of that Los Comales is sloppy.  The service  other than the grumpy guy at the cash register  was excellent.  The Ambiance was nice.  The food however left something to be desired. It s a personal pet peeve of mine to be served frozen crinkle cut french fries with any meal at any restaurant other than a greasy hamburger joint.  I ordered the juevos rancheros and it was decent  but the beans were flavorless.  I ordered migas for my daughter  asked them to hold the Pico  and it looked like it came from Denny s.  Note  that the chips  salsa and tortillas were unusually good.  Bottom line  there are too many other good places within walking distance to come here again
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,29,In the 30 years I have lived here in Austin I have eaten out at hundreds of Mexican Restaurants. I love Mexican food and try to eat a different dish when I repeat a place I like.  Today it has the Chicken Monterrey.  OMG the chicken was cut up into nice sized chunks  as where the green pepper and onion.  Covered in cheese the plate looked wonderful.  First bite and I was in heaven  come to find out they also add  made inhouse  chorizo  Add the flavor of the rice and the beans and my mouth  my entire being was in dinning heaven.  The waitstaff was upbeat  positive and very friendly.  The prices where average compared to the rest of the restaurants in the East Austin entertainment district.   And the food  well the food was amazing.    My husband  who is Mexican and an Austin Native  and I eat out often and although we have Mexican food at home  eating out for us is like going to a friends house for dinner.  And we definitely like going to this friends house
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,30,We were taken here by an Austin local and had a great experience  The service was so very kind and everything was authentic. Highly recommend the Chile Rellenos- delicious   Would recommend if you want to get out for a little adventure.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,31,Kind of expensive. Kind of not-very-tasty  AKA bland . Kind of why people are  Meh  about TexMex in Austin.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,32,So i just ordered a caldo de res over the phone. This isnt caldo de res. They through all these HUGE pieces of squash with green beans  in something that WASNT a broth haha. Missing most the recipe And the beef was some hard ass pieces of meat all attached to one huge piece of fat. It Wasnt meant for caldo de res. Idk if this is just how austin makes their caldo de res or if it was the angry looking cook in the back who kept looking at me.  Either way its trash and over priced.  Sad thing is i tipped for a pick up order i still had to wait for and it was garbage. Literally garbage. Thats where its at now.  Also caldo de res usually comes with rice. Ayy but the lady who helped me was nice  could have used more napkins tho other than the single one that comes with fork but hey i ended up not needed napkins cause it was garbage so yayyy   hope you guys make a better effort for the next person. Ill never eat here again.  thought this review would be better than a call and trip back to them. If that was their effort the first time  i dont want to see a second try haha your cook sucks. Keep my  13 and invest in learning the actual caldo res recipe
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,33,Yummy food  and this is coming from a homesick Valley girl. It might not be exactly what I m used to  but it definitely hits the spot. Would recommend to friends. Great homemade tortillas and tasty fajitas  
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,34,Actually just so blown away by the kindness of their employees. They all were so helpful and made sure I was taken care of constantly. The food was I credible too and the salsa was good which is so important 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,35,The food here at Los Comales was very delicious and quick. We came in for a quick lunch and started with the guacamole. It was very fresh and good. My boyfriend got the cheese enchiladas which were very tasty  and I got a torta with pastor as my protein. Let me start with saying this  if you haven t had a torta  get it here. This torta was a A . The price of food was a little more than I expected  but I will support a local business any day.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,36,I ordered chicken fajita tacos.  Ummm  not good.  They had so so queso  good chips  okay salsa.  My friend got a michilata  spelling   and it was fabulous  that s why it was 2 stars instead of one.  My friend also had tostadas and she said they weren t very good     the one thing I was a fan of was their service.  The ladies were all very nice.  I will probably give it another try.  Also  they don t take discover card.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,37,Great food  My wife and I either go or call in an order for pickup once a week. My favorite is the shrimp enchiladas and my mixed favorite is the shrimp cocktail. Everything I ve tried is really good 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,38,Enjoyed dinner there last night. Not crowded and don t know why since it was a Friday night and the waiter was attentive and the food was good  classic tex-mex. Had a basic meal of tacos  queso  taquitos  and margaritas. Will go back many times.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,39,The wait at Joe s bakery across the street was an hour so we decided to try something different. A friend had mentioned this place before and he really liked it.   We came after church around 11 00 and I was really wanting breakfast but was only handed a lunch menu. When asked  the waiter informed me that there was no breakfast after 11 but that there were two lunch plates that had eggs on them. I passed.   The place seemed to have a lot of regulars so I thought this to be a good sign. Unfortunately once the food arrived  I was disappointed. Everything we ordered was extremely bland with no seasoning.  Our order    Me  gordita with barbacoa  fajita taco on flour tortilla - the meat on both were flavorless. The gordita contained beans  meat  lettuce   and queso fresco. The fajita taco had lettuce  tomato   and cheese. Not even salt and pepper could give these items flavor. The beans were also bland.   Wife  mole enchiladas. She said it was just okay  needed more mole.  Son  chicken flautas. He seemed to enjoy his meal the most. They were covered with melted Jack cheese.  Daughter  cheese enchiladas with red sauce  not chili con carne . Again  very bland.   The tastiest item at the table was the Mexican rice on everyone s plate  except mine since I ordered a la cart . I will admit that the rice was better than the majority of Mexican Restaurants in town. But it wasn t enough to make up for an unsatisfying meal.  It s not the worst meal I ve ever had. It was just very disappointing.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,40,I got food poisoning last night after eating beef fajitas  with lettuce and sour cream   enchiladas  and rice beans queso. I only had my usual Kind bar for breakfast at 10am  so it could have only been this food. My stomach began to hurt badly about 90 minutes after and I became dizzy. Two hours later the vomiting and hot cold flashes began  which continued for 6 hours. It was awful. VERY alarmed by this place  as when I reported it they screamed and me and told me to get the health department there. I told I was worried about other people getting sick and they just yelled at me and told me it s not possible to get sick off cheese. I told them it was the lettuce I was most worried about and really - neither of us know what caused me to get sick. I asked for a refund and they said no because you can t get sick off cheese. Look at my reviews  I m fair and I ve had stomach flu before and this was not that. I would avoid so you don t also get sick  but in addition the manager I spoke to was really mean and unreasonable - not good people.  Update  following this post  my 15 month son and his dad proceeded to sick as well. They ate less of the food  and this was the only meal all three of us shared in about a month. So to the owner who s writing this nice response after talking to me like complete crap  I don t think you have much of a defense.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,41,This is my go to spot when I m hungry and in the area. The queso is unmatched and the chicken enchiladas are the best  Place has a great atmosphere and the best staff. Thanks 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,42,I love this place.  Always good authentic  in my gringo opinion .  Love the furniture from Mexico  quiet atmosphere.  Family place  Lucinda Hutson introduced us to this place.  Just had a sopa de res  simple just like in Mexico..
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,43,So sorry to have to say that this Mexican restaurant falls flat. I stopped in today for a to-go meal  so hungry for a late lunch. Ordered the chile relleno plate. Stopped at a park to eat it -- chile relleno cheese was not melted  the sauce wasn t spiced. The rice was scant  and the refried beans were sour to the taste. The only saving grace was the homemade corn tortillas -- nice  large. I won t be coming back here  unfortunately. I can buy 2 frozen chile rellenos box at Walmart for  6.99  which means I can make this so much better myself at home for so much le  .
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,44,When we are in the mood for breakfast after church  we typically go to Joe s Bakery  but we didn t feel like waiting 30 minutes to be seated today  there is always a wait  but it s worth it   so after finding Beto s packed as well  we came to Los Comales. I have been here a few times before with my husband and some friends for lunch  and it s okay.    We were able to get a seat right away  and saw our waitress about 5 minutes later.  I was really in the mood for breakfast  and found that there were not many options in the way of breakfast items- I believe there were only three things on the menu that incorporated an egg  and there was not a single breakfast taco or plate on the menu. This lead to me having to rethink my order  so we asked for more time  and the waitress disappeared for another 10 minutes.    I ended up ordering a chorizo and egg torta  one of the three egg items  and asked them to hold the lettuce and tomato  and added two barbacoa tacos  because those constitute breakfast tacos where I grew up . When I was asked whether o wanted my tacos in flour or corn tortillas  I followed up by asking if the flour tortillas were homemade.  They were not  so I opted for corn because flour tortillas that are store bought  the commercial brands  tend  to have that sugary preservative taste to them.   The chorizo and egg from the torta was ok. I have definitely had better  but it wasn t horrible. As for the tacos  the barbacoa was extra oily  lukewarm  and bland  even after adding salt.  The corn tortillas were delicious  but were cold.  We were in need of drink refills  but our waitress never stopped by our table after serving us.  My husband had to hunt her down for the check and then was able to ask for refills.   Overall  I had a very underwhelming experience. My food was ok but barely warm  my husband seemed to enjoy his lunch choice much better  and the service today was lacking  it s been better on previous visits  and the restaurant was not slammed by any means .
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,45,The best authentic Mexican food in Austin  Super yummy shrimp cocktail too  Def order a coronarita 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,46,The food and atmosphere are GREAT  best QUESO EVER  Homemade corn tortillas are to die for 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,47,Will someone please come and pick me up.i am so full  This place is on point. Also  best salsa I have ever had.  Thanks for the hospitality. Xoxoxo
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,48,Real authentic Mexican food and ambiance at a good price. Great variety of ice cream for dessert. A very nice outdoor patio as well. They also have original mexican Coca-Cola.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,49,Went on a Saturday night  around 6 30-7. Was almost virtually empty  two or three other tables were full . Not an amazing sign.  Salsa was actually really good  Very spicy and fresh. The rest  Pretty bland  honestly.  It s pretty pricey   9-12 per entree  for what you get. Plates were big  just not tasty.  Employees were friendly  nice ambiance if it was actually busy.  Wouldn t go back  for the price and the value.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,50,Excellent food and service  delicious hand made corn tortillas and salsa. Everything was fresh  crisp and generous portions. I had the enchiladas huastecas  with a tangy tomatillo sauce and melted queso blanco  and a pan fried tender rib eye steak. My husband s dish also had steak plus chorizo with queso fresco. Both plates include tortillas  rice and beans. The restaurant reminds me of when I was a kid visiting family here. Reasonably priced
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,51,This place is amazing great serivce fast and friendly  Have you had the queso  Amazing
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,52,Wasnt really impressed by the food  or the salsa. I had the enchiladas lunch plate. The salsa was a pale green and was bland.   But the interior looks good and clean and the waitresses were all SMOKING HAWT  Service was great. The waitresses seemed to be fluent in English and Spanish. I guess Ill give em a second chance based on that. Judging from the outside  you would expect a crappy interior and terrible service.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,53,Best nachos in the neighborhood - I ve shopped around  so I say that with confidence. Also  they are good  honest people. I left my phone behind one night  came back the next morning  and they handed it over. Sure  we expect everyone to do that  but there are a lot of places I would have been out of luck. This place has my loyalty.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,54,At best average. The food was ok and could have been from anywhere. The service was outstanding and the waitress was very friendly.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,55,Queso good  martini good  food good. Normally we never go 3 for 3  we were pleased to say the least 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,56,Yummy chicken soup  love that they are and old time EAST AUSTIN establishment. Hope they never go away 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,57,Love this place  The food never disappoints and the variety is great. Never been when it s busy  so I love the calm atmosphere it allows. The location is perfect and easy to spot. Great prices as well  Don t pass up on this place.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,58,Four of us visited Los Comales for dinner last night. My friend s neighbours swear this is the best Mexican restaurant in Austin. Now that s a big claim  I don t know if quite deserves that title  but Los Comales is pretty good.  The free chips and salsa was great - as other yelpers have told us. I had the enchiladas verdes con pollo - a simple  classic dish  two  generous enchiladas in a delicious salsa verde  just like abuella used to make . My husband had the carne asada  a tasty thin cut of grilled steak. Both mains came with rice and beans and a lettuce salad  topped with a dallop of sour cream  putting the  tex  in  tex mex  .   We were surprised this place was not very full at about 8.00pm on a Thursday night  there were about 15 people in the huge dining room. For me  it s always fun eating at a place that s packed with people. Maybe the rush crowd comes earlier or later  Or on weekends   Our server was warm and attentive. The highlight of the night was the roaming musicians who serenaded us   10  you pick the song . The duo had an accordion and a guitar and great voices  they rocked  La puerta negra .
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,59,I came in and walked right back out. I did not order any food.   Once seated a had a chance to look around and take the place in and it was FILTHY. I just couldn t imagine eating something from a restaurant that had such a dirty front of the house... it scared me away because if that was the front who knew how bad the kitchen could be.   
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,60,I don t have much to say about the food or service. What I do have to say  is that my cell phone was stolen from my table by one of their employees. I left the restaurant and immediately realized that I had left my phone on the table and went back inside. I ran to my server and said I had left my phone and asked if she found anything when the table was bussed. While this is happening  my friend was calling my phone. It rang and rang  then voicemail. He tried again  and this time it went straight to voicemail-- it had been turned off within about 10 seconds of each call.   While still in los Comales  I log in to  Find my iPhone  app to find that my phone was indeed in the restaurant. I showed this to the manager. Nothing. No one would help me. They said it wasn t their problem and that maybe a table next to ours took my phone. I called the police  filed a report  and of course  nothing has or will come of it. This is completely despicable and I am in total disbelief and disgusted that no one did a thing to help  even though my phone was absolutely still IN the restaurant. I know for a fact that whoever took my phone  was witnessing all of this going down.  Anyway  I never leave reviews  but I just thought I should get it out that there are some nasty  reprehensible people working at this place that just might steal your stuff. Obviously  I will never go back to Los Comales.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,61,How do u mess up Mexican martinis and cheese enchiladas  Also the salsa was definitely Pace salsa from the store.... if I don t get food poisoning God is good.1
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,62,One of my favorite places in Austin for Mexican Tex-Mex food. The Caldo de Pollo is my fave here   My husband and I drive by Los Comales every Sunday on our way to church and every time I see it I m reminded of how much I love East Austin. I have a special place in my heart for Los Comales and that Caldo de Pollo. The love from the staff that will make you feel apart of the family 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,63,Review for takeout only   Best chicken soup  My partner and I have tried a lot of chicken soup in town over the years during cold periods or when we are sick. We keep coming back to this favorite. It is fresh and flavorful with real chicken pieces  not shredded  and lots of vegetables. It comes with Mexican rice  onions  cilantro and lemon as well as either flour or corn tortillas. It is very well wrapped for pick up. Their flour tortillas are excellent. They reheat them on the grill for you.   NOTE   It is not chicken tortilla soup nor is it the style with big pieces of vegetables in the broth.   Los Comales also has great breakfast tacos Monday - Friday for  1.25. I think they are the best in the area. Just the right amount of filing and great flour tacos.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,64,I so want to give this place 5 stars. The service is great. The chips and salsa are delicious and delivered promptly. The chicken taco  Exceptional. The shrimp fajitas  Fine. The Barbacoa  Not so much...a greasy discharge left me slightly nauseous. I loved the server  so I m sorry to say  probably wouldn t return.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,65,Finally found an authentic Mexican food place in Austin  Loved everything from their bomb horchata to the chille rellenos and enchiladas. Our waitress was wonderful as well  super friendly and very attentive. I ll definitely be back again soon.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,66,My boyfriend and I were in the area to get a tire for his car. While there  we asked one of the mechanics if he could recommend a good place to eat  and he suggested this restaurant. I m so glad that we took his recommendation . The food was great  fresh and delicious. We loved our waitress  who was very pleasant and attentive   even though she didn t speak English and we don t speak Spanish we communicated just fine . I ve told others to come here and I ll definitely be back.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,67,Pros  DELICIOUS prickly pear margarita. Huge tacos. Yummy chicken. Friendly staff. handmade corn tortillas  Cons  Meh chicharron. unenthusiastic staff.   I really enjoyed my margarita. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in the beginning but toward the end she totally disappeared. I mean  we wanted to pay our bill and we couldn t find her for about ten minutes. I didn t like the chicharron taco. I like my chicharron crispy but this was pretty spongy. The chicken taco was scrumptious. Next time I ll get like five prickly pear margaritas. And many corn tortillas. My dining partners both got the carne asada and it was AWESOME  I d recommend that over the tacos.   Good not great Mexican. I miss LA.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,68,Freaking delicious and well priced  May need some basic Spanish  but so worth it  Best shrimp fajitas I ve ever had.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,69,Wasn t satisfied with my meal took one bite and left the whole plate the waiter asked if I would like something else from menu then had the nerve to talk bout me
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,70,Really liked the environment and the employees are great and are always around. Food is an 8 out of 10 and the service is outstanding. Plus  3 mimosas for brunch is pretty good. We will be back to this place when we visit Austin again.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,71,Recently I made it to Los Comales  they serve authenic Mexican food   actually the style is called Norteno .  As you enter the restaurant  there is  a long  flaming grill along the righthand side that is full of smoking meat  grilling jalapenos  and onions.  If I didn t know better I  would have sworn  that I was in Mexico - the juke box blasts Mexican tunes  pinatas hang from the ceiling  the waitresses speak to you in Spanish.  Don t be too worried if you don t speak Spanish as the menus are actually in English so you can just point if you are in a bind.  Apparently they even have mariachis there on weekends.  The salsa that they serve with their chips is delicious. When the waitress set the salsa bowl down on the table  I picked it up and started devouring it. After about 5 minutes  I asked my companion how he liked the salsa.  He said that if I put the bowl down that he d love to try it.  They make terrific homemade corn and flour tortillas.  Los Comales is known for their carne asada  grilled meat  so we ordered the fajitas for two    16 .   All the different   fajita dishes come with onions  tomatoes  rice  beans  guacamole  sour cream   amp  pico de gallo.  When the fajitas arrived  the metal platter was really sizzling  if it had been any hotter then it would have ignited.   after our waitress burnt herself on one of the plates  she warned us that the plates were hot too.  And boy were the beef fajitas tasty with a great smoky flavor.  The other time I was there I had the T-bone Los Comales which is served with chorizo  spicy sausage   grilled onions  chiles  rice  and beans. That was great as well.  They have a number of lunch specials for  5.25.  They serve a good margarita as well.  I had a regular sized margarita but their web site says that they have the biggest and best margarita in Texas for  7. I am going to have to check the super sized one out on my next visit.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,72,Worst server in the whole place... especially 4 Mothers Day... telling us we could only have 1 bowl of chips per table  we had 3 tables total  even tho we ordered a large queso to start off with... how are we supposed to eat the queso with our fingers ... even tho the salsa was straight up Hot El Paso sauce and garnished with a cilantro on top u didn t fool anyone... waiter kept forgetting what we requested... kept ignoring us especially after we received our food... never going back again..even if u paid me.... this guy needs to work on his table service manners... and thats why people don t get tipped....    
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,73,Loved it  Food and enchiladas were amazing. Queso was great. No Kerbey  but half the price...Everything s very cheap. And the service was pretty amazing. Great real Austin TexMex.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,74,We have been having fun exploring all that Austin has to offer in the way of restaurants which has been a rather interesting process.  I ve also been finding some fun restaurants exist on  the Eastside  these days.  So one Saturday  I thought we d try another Eastside Mexican restaurant mentioned in the Chronicle  Los Comales.  Whoa  what a night   So first we drove past the place.   I think the light was rather dim on the sign to our credit .  Then  as we parked we were greated by a man in a reflective yellow vest.  In retrospect  I guess he was the parking lot attendant.  It wasn t really that complicated to park even for someone who is parking challenged nor was it a high demand parking area so I assume he was there more to discourage criminal activity.  Then  we walk in and sit down  and our friendly server comes over to greet us.  The only problem was we discovered very quickly that she could hardly understand nor speak English   It was a little difficult to communicate what it was we wanted but somehow we managed.  At least she was friendly.  The next amusing thing was that later on  this Asian girl with a backpack and an i.d. badge shoots through the door and heads for our table.  She plunges into her spiel   I m a missionary...  as she flashes her photo i.d. badge around her neck for the Unification Church.  We talked her for a little bit  and when she found out we weren t interested in her spiel  she just smiled  and says   Would you like to donate    My husband said he already donates every Sunday.  She said   God Bless You  and shot right back out the door after that.  So then after a little more time  a middle-aged Asian woman walks in the door with several bouquets of roses  some garnished with teddy bears.  She comes to our table asking if we would like one.  We decline  and she proceeds from table to table bewildering others in the room and then leaves.  When we were checking out  I started admiring the pralines and other candies for sale.  I saw a pumpkin candy which I had never heard of  which I casually remarked out loud about it.  So before I knew it  the cashier grabs the pumpkin candy  and chops it open  and hands me a slice to grab part of.  I grab some but too much.   I was curious but not terribly feeling like pumpkin candy .  I thank him  try some  but then I m stuck with this chunk of sticky candy in my hand.  We walk outside and get in the car.  I m trying to figure about what to do with the candy before I start driving  as the parking attendant starts to get a little worried about us hesitating.  I guess thinking I needed help pulling out  again not that difficult even for the parking challenged me   he helps direct me out of my parking spot and the lot.  So I don t have much recollection about the food which tells me it must have been so-so  but I have to admit that our visit to this restaurant will make me chuckle for years to come.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,75,This place reminds me too much of home.  This is where Mexicans stop for food  they aren t out to impress you.  Also some good advice  I don t think Mexicans really eat chips and salsa too often  so don t expect that to be good.  Get the Chicken Monterrey or beef fajitas and mosey on back to your condo.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,76,Not as good as I expected  but totally kinda OK. This place is  butt  in the following sense  The atmosphere is cool  rustic wood furniture  colorful paintings and comfy layout  BUT it s got that grungy ring around the edges  sagging ceiling panels  etc.  that makes you wonder how clean are the things you re touching  and the multi-media mixture of Spanish-language soap operas and Mexican juke-box pop adds an extra flair of trash. The service was quick and friendly BUT the frozen margaritas were a let-down. The chips and salsa came free BUT the salsa tasted like ketchup. The food seems fresh and the size is decent for the price  a skinny-steak dinner for  10  BUT it s on the greasy side  steak tastes like it was fried in butter  and I did not sleep all night after eating here...
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,77,A friend and I only had an hour for lunch so we needed to find something close by and fast. We ended up at this place  which seemed semi-busy. The waitress was very nice but not too helpful when asked what she recommend.   The salsa was too watery  and the tortillas weren t as good as I had heard they would be. I stayed safe and ordered the chicken flautas and they tasted so funny. I didn t enjoy them one bit. The beans and rice weren t even that good  and how can you mess up beans and rice      Overall  not a horrible experience  but won t be coming back.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,78,Authentic Mexican     Finally  no TexMex BS. Best cheese enchiladas is Austin. Red sauce is delicious. Friendly staff.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,79,Kilroy is back...at Los Comales  It s been about 2 years since my last visit-the road construction kept me away. Stopped by for lunch today and was torn between the  19 Chicken Mole and the   24 Chicken Monterrey. When in doubt-go mole...hard...I did..and it was as delicious as I remembered it.   What got me to be a fan keeps me a fan. Los Comales doesn t serve up what some hipster executive chef thinks Mexican food should be. It serves up what Mexican food is  If you re the glitterati type  you won t like it. But  if you ve lived on the border or traveled the interior of Mexico  you ll be at home here.   For you gringos out there-brush up on your Spanish before you go. When I say this is a Mexican restaurant mean it. It doesn t get any more authentic in Austin than Los Comales 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,80,I live near by and finally decided to stop in Sunday night when we had a craving for Margs  amp  mex after ACL.  It was almost 9 and we d intended to go elsewhere but they were closed and this place was open. It was a just a bad idea from the moment we walked in. The decor was hideous  lighting was weird and they had some Spanish Idol type thing on the giant TV behind us.  We get our chips  amp  salsa but I hadn t bothered to try it yet. So we order. Things sound pretty yummy but I was jonesin  for some cheese. I ordered the chicken enchiladas  my bf got some verde sauce covered dish  amp  my roommate played it safe with flautas. I figured enchiladas are typically a safe bet. Then I say I d like a margarita. They have an entire half of page with their margs in big letters. Takes her a second to figure out how to tell me they only serve beer. I look at her funny and am just like ok well whatever...  Then I dig in to the chips. They were awful  store bought and stale. I think I took one bite of salsa and sure it was hot but not a good hot. There was almost no real flavor other than heat. I look at my friends and I remembering telling them this is gonna be bad. My roommate says think positive.   So a few minutes later out comes our food. It doesn t even look good. I didn t even know that I want to take a bite. But I did  crossing my fingers other wise. It was basically a tortilla with dryed out chunks of chicken to big to even put in your mouth  wrapped in a tortilla with some melted shredded cheese on top.  WTF    It was I would imagine someone in the middle of Alaska who s never had mex or tex mex would come up with.  I ate my rice and the cheese off the top. I didn t even bother with the enchilada itself it was so bad.  My bf s looked the same only it at least had verde sauce on it. They had brought us out tortillas for some reason. They were just blah store brand but it was at least something else for me to nibble on.  I didn t even bother to complain I just wanted to go home and find something better to eat.   I will NOT be going back.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,81,Once again the enchiladas were great  I love this place  Great food that s enjoyed in one of our true Mexican restaurants popular with many Hispanics in town as well as the rest of us. Parking is a little tight but it s worth the visit. My favorite is the chicken enchilada with mole.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,82,Decent little comida stop on the E. Side. Pretty authentic tex-mex  Definitely a step better than El Azteca  Juan in a Million. Todo in espanol- bueno. Nothing fancy  just good grub. You can see the grill at the front  all the meat was fresh and seasoned on the fly.   Super fast and cheap Lunches. Monterrey Chicken was excellent- had chorizo built in which really gave it a nice punch. Served right off the grill in under 4 minutes. Damn satisfying for  6
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,83,This is the dirtiest restaurant I ve been to in Austin in a long time. The tablecloth and small plastic cover that didn t fit the table were both covered in sticky and chips and salsa. The waitress had to take plates back because they were covered with someone else s old dry cheese. The food was pretty good if you can put your arms or hands down on the table to eat without getting nasty. The chairs are certainly authentic but are also horribly uncomfortable unless you like sitting on a flat hard slab of wood. parking can also be an issue but you are downtown. Service is very slow but they are very  very nice.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,84,Went this past Sat night with a big group of friends  20-ish people  and they did a great job in accommodating our party. Drinks came promptly and the salsa and chips were delicious    I am pretty sure I ate a whole basket to myself. I think this after this point is when the service really went downhill. I ordered a house margarita and the Chicken Taquitos plate  with no sour cream  no beans  double rice. The whole table got their food except me and another person and we had to wait quite a while after everyone had gotten their food before we did. Someone at our table was waiting on jalapenos with their meal and never got it after asking for it three times. I had a big whopping dollop of sour cream on my plate but that wasn t a big deal  one of my table mates just scooped it off my plate. The Chicken Taquitos was very very dry and the cheese on top was chewy. It is almost as if the cheese was melted and then my plate sat under a food warmer for a while. Even drenching the taquitos themselves in the yummy salsa that I loved couldn t save it. At this point I wished I ordered something else but since I got my food so late  I just stuck with it. I would be willing to give this place another try because of the margarita and the salsa because I am hoping the mishaps were simply because we were there with a big party.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,85,Maybe I m just getting old  but damn  Can they make their chairs any less comfortable    I really don t think they could unless they added nails poking through the butt of the seat. Seriously  The angle of the back is just not right. The chairs are of Mexican style and whatnot  they fit with the decor and all. Whatever  They suck  I mean  can a boo at least get some ass padding if you are going to shove my face in my plate with your oddly angled chairs    My companion and I were both complaining to each other and laughing at their ridiculousness. I remembered feeling that way the only other time I visited. I probably won t go back for this reason alone. Really. It was that uncomfortable. If you are in your 20 s and don t have creaky bone syndrome that you will inevitably get one day  go here. You probably won t notice a thing.  As for the food  it s pretty solid. Micheladas are okay. I ve had better  I ve had worse. The food was fresh. The chicken was not weird chicken parts  so that was good. Not too greasy. Tacos be a crispy. Not bad  just a little bland. Our waiter  we fondly and secretly referred to as Myrna  was attentive and fast.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,86,Great Norte os-influenced Mexican food.   The skirts and ribeyes are a specialty and the fajitas are great. On top of all the asados  you get great accompanying Mexican food like enchiladas  sopes  gorditas and tacos. They also have a good selection of stewed-meat options  as well.  ed.  Just so you don t throw a gasket unnecessarily  the practice here is to pay at the counter. If having to pay in person is the sort of thing that makes you fly into a rage  then you re probably best sticking to  merican eateries where the tradition is to have your check brought to your table.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,87,The Take out paper menu does not match the prices of the website menu on Yelp. The discrepancy of the two menus is the internet menu everything is a dollar or more cheaper. We call in to go orders using the menu online expecting the correct amount. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. Please update the prices  
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,88,Los Comales has a pretty extensive menu  but today three things I ordered were not on the menu  and it s not the first time to happen to me. I m not sure of the reason but it ought to be listed some where they are out of XYZ. I settled for fajitas that had the  marinade  flavor but over cooked. The rice was clumpy and the beans tasted as if they had been soaking in the pot a tad too long. Finally  my pet-peeve with Mexican restaurants is using store bought tortillas  but Los Comales had homemade flour and corn tortillas  which were very good. That s the reason I give them an extra star.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,89,The best tacos I ve had in Austin.  I m not talking about the fusion Tex-Mex kind like Torchy s or other places that add unique flavors by having queso and brisket as options.  Not knocking those places since I enjoy eating there  but if you want authentic tacos  this is the place to go.  I love their homemade corn tortillas as they are thin  not like the store bought ones that taste like cardboard and are a bit thicker.  The tacos come out piping hot with diced green onions  cilantro  and a plethora of sliced limes available upon request.  I usually prefer al pastor  but the barbacoa at this restaurant was delectable.  I should ve gotten two of those instead.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,90,Average  at best. There s a chance I came on an off night  but it just wasn t that enjoyable. The margarita on the rocks that I had was quite weak  the frozen one was better . Chips and salsa were above average  so that was good...but then they gave points back for some rather bland enchiladas. Service seemed indifferent overall.  So basically  it wasn t a horrible meal  but you can do far better for Mexican over on 7th street.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,91,My wife called to place to go order. After telling her they were out of half the items on the menu  she went ahead and placed an order for what they said they did have. After driving there and finding parking  they informed her they were now out of her item. As a result  she left empty handed  hungry and angry. Bottom line  their service is slow and incompetent and the food isn t that great. There are better Mexican food places in E. Austin.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,92,Overpriced  sub-par food. Non existent waitress  had ask for everything and bring the check back and forth to her  Much better Mexican options in town 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,93,The BEST MENUDO in town. This restaurant has to be one of the more authentic places in town. The place is clean  the service is fast  and the drinks are cheap.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,94,Cheap  solid mex and tex-mex.  Good staff.  Good drinks.  Good chips and queso.  Large  tasty portions.  I love when I get two meals out of one entree.  We love this place.  Don t expect a lot out of the atmosphere ambience.  But hey  quick  cheap Mexican food.  I m for it.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,95,On 11 4 at 2 pm ish I went to get great Mexican food. The service so so. Once they bring you your food you will never see them at your table again  need more of what your drinking to bad. What the check good luck. The last time me and my friends waited 15 minutes. She walked by us  looked at us and could see we were just sitting there I asked for the check and nothing. We all got up to leave and I walked up to the casher and still had to wait on the check before I could pay and get out of there. Now they have PO everybody that I have gone there with that if I ever want to eat there it will be just me.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,96,Pastor tacos were great. Good flour tortillas    Everything tasted fresh and food was cooked up very fast. Friendly staff. Surprised this place isn t more packed. I suggest putting a mexican martini on the menu.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,97,You want the Mexican food and you re driving down east 7th going east and you see a bunch of Spanishy signs indicating Mexicany foods and so you stop and you get out and go in and eat aforementioned Mexicany foods and are pleased that it feels Mexicany and everybody speaks mostly only Spanish to you and smiles and like Bek said in her review it s a bit grungey but colorful but that s alright so you order your fajitas and tacos and beans and margaritas and rice and such and pay and you re full and buenas noches.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,98,Not my favorite   I saw the commercial for this place on tv and then saw it had good reviews so I figured why not try it.  I ordered what the waitress described as flautas.  I did not like it at all.  Something about the chicken did not sit right with me.  The salsa was just meh and the bathrooms were not clean   Then our waitress disappeared and we sat there waiting for her to come pick up our bill for 10-15 minutes.  Theres better mexican food in Austin. You arent missing much if you skip this place.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,99,This place sucks.    Listen  I have heard ALL about how  authentic  and  Not TEX MEX  this place is  so I went today for lunch.  I GREW UP on Mexican food in El Paso and MUCH traveling in Mexico.  What I can tell you is that this place sucks  In case you didn t see the first line of my review.   I had the gorditas  one picadillo and one  was supposed to be - turned out to be puerco  which is fine  but not what I ordered  Carne Guisada.  My wife had the Tamales with Rice.  The experience started off OK  I ordered Horchata and water and a nice lady took our order.  Then the chips and salsa came.     QUICK TIME-SAVING SUGGESTION FOR ANY MEXICAN RESTAURANT     - PLEASE DO NOT USE CRAPPY  RESTAURANT-SUPPLY CHIPS WHEN INTRODUCING PATRONS TO YOUR FOOD.  So that sums up the  appetizer course  - salsa was average - fine  whatever.   Now about 25 minutes later   Keep in mind this is LUNCH  right   Not a relaxed  leisurely dinner - please be respectful of our time.  the food arrives.  Looks promising  except for this sheen of grease over the gorditas.  My wife tries her tamales and they are EXTREMELY dry.  I tried one too  just to see what she meant .  As for the sheen of grease  well  it was indicative of the food on the plate.  She and I split the gorditas and they were BAD.   I m talking to you Jennifer A. from Arizona  whose review was the reason I chose this place  since my wife and I wanted gorditas for lunch    So this entire time  my wife and I NEVER got a refill of water brought to our table or saw our waiter  so also couldn t complain  which I wasn t REALLY in the mood to do  but the situation increasingly called for it .  The waiter looked like he had been up all night  sweating  shirt unbuttoned right above where it is tucked in.  Finally  my wife got up and walked over to the water pitcher and refilled both of our glasses.  So this whole thing was just not good.  NOW  we get to the end of the  meal .  We couldn t get a check to save our lives  so we just got up and went to the cashier.   The Lady had to literally ring a bell multiple times to get our waiters attention and he THEN handed her our check with a very curt Thank You .  I customarily tip 20   and here I still tipped 10   but I felt like tipping nothing.  As in  THANKS FOR NOTHING LOS COMALES .  P.S. - my wife and now I have bellyaches  no b.s.   hence my bellyaching 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,100,Since Los Comales is up the street from my house I was excited to give it a try. A friend and I went pretty close to closing time.  We thought maybe the food and service were a little weak because of the late hour.  Again  since it is so close to my house  I decided I should give the place one more try  maybe lunchtime.  So I did.  This was  hands down  one of the WORST meals i have ever eaten  ever.  The salsa is pasty  the queso is runny  the food is relatively tasteless. My lunch companion got a beef fajita torta - the beef was tough and stringy and tasted off.  The entire place smelled of stale cigar smoke.  There will be no third times the charm for me with this place  and i suggest everyone else stay away.  There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants on the East side that are not just edible  but delicious.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,101,I ve known about Los Comales for years but have only been enticed to eat here recently after reading the reviews here on Yelp. The service was excellent  as our waitress came promtely to our table followed shortly by our food after taking our order. Unfortunately  the food was nothing to write home about. My chicken enchiladas verde were lacking in the cheese department. The beans were flavorless. And the rice was somewhat bland. I really had high hopes for this restaurant  but maybe they were too high. Big pro is that the food is cheap and the portions are big 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,102,yum  anything with the pork in verde sauce is excellent. the enchiladas that are called either just  oaxaquena enchiladas  or  pork oaxaquena enchiladas  are the best    complaints - their service is almost too fast when it s not crowded and sometimes the music is WAY too loud.  there s a small  caged in patio area for smokers traffic noise lovers   
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,103,I haven t been in a while  but this is my favorite Mexican place in Austin. Lots of great pork dishes  super-friendly staff  cheap prices and fast service. It s authentic Mexican  so if what you want is Tex-Mex  go elsewhere. Plus this was pretty much the first place in Austin to sell Mexican Coke  which wins them an extra star.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,104,Los Comales gets four stars from me for their tortas.  Their other food is tasty  but I go for the tortas.  Their service is fast and they have reasonably priced food.  Great for lunch or dinner.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,105,You know a place is authentic when the waiter barely speaks English. I really liked this place. Cheap  good sized portions  amazing food  not busy  and good atmosphere. I only had the beef fajitas  but everything on the menu looked delish. I definitely plan on going back
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,106,The food is authentic  so says my friend in the know. I like it because the food is good  the price is reasonable  and you must have at least a rudimentary level of Spanish to communicate beyond simplicities. Pretty sure that influences the quality of the food in a good way  though.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,107,This place won t impress you with decor but honestly does that matter THAT much  The food will not BLOW your mind but it s good and pretty affordable. I really enjoyed the flan and my man friend liked the shrimp cocktail.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,108,Not Tex Mex  Genuine Mexican cusine. If you want Tex Mex go to Chuys. If you want real mexican food eat at Los Comales. A fan since 1985.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,109,if i could give zero i would. ppl say this is authentic. if this is what authentic is then please  direct me to taco bell. i tried again  i did  i tried. but suck just wont wash off this place. give it a rest please. ive had better tacos from gas stations. they say they have awesome corn tortillas. this is a lie. it tastes like corn flavored ass. i try to give the benefit of the doubt  i do try so hard  but this place sucks and anyone who enjoys this food is either a novice or a drunkard. first time shame on me  second time shame on you  there wont be a third.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,110,LOVE THIS PLACE    Definitely a hidden gem on the East side that you HAVE to check out  Great food  amp  the staff is super nice  Great spot to grab a margarita before heading downtown 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,111,Los Comales is the most authentic Mexican restaurant in Austin. If you want Tex Mex  stay away. Everything on the Los Comales menu is reasonably priced  homemade and delicious. I especially like the soups  they re enormous meals with lots of great flavor. The staff is always very friendly and try their best to communicate  English is their second language . It s very clean inside and filled with authentically Mexican decor. In one corner is a juke box and a billiard table on a very small dance floor. It doesn t get more homemade and real than this place 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,112,I absolutely LOVE Los Comales. I recommend either the Chicken Monterrey or the gordita. They make their corn tortillas in house and OMG they are the best   Awesome for Sunday morning hung over brunch.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,113,This is NOT the place to bring parents visiting from out of town  but it is great  family-owned Austin Tex Mex. I love it because of the HUGE portions  telenovelas  and speedy service.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,114,Really good tacos  hand made tortillas.. but they charged me  3.75 tax for each taco... when I asked to the cashier  is an old guy his voice sound rude.. think is the owner. I could give 4 stars  but customer service is very important to me.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,115,Ok. So I admit  after reading the reviews before going to this restaurant I was very concerned. It wasn t as bad as I was expecting  but still not great. We were in a group of about 12 on the patio. There were maybe 2 tables inside. The service was still slow  my bf and I waited nearly 15 minutes just to get our drinks. About 8 people got their food out the first round while the rest of us just sat and watched them all eat. About the time that they were done  the remaining food came out. Not usually a huge deal for me  I know kitchens get slammed...but it was just SO much time between. Once everyone s food had come out  we didn t see our waitress again.   The food was actually wasn t bad. I m very finicky about meat and we ordered chicken fajitas  they were pretty tasty. MUCH better than I expected. The margarita was a different story...on the rocks  amp  pretty awful.   I won t seek this place out again but it s just not my thing.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,116,Good service  live Mariachi band  delicious authentic food. Doesn t get much better than this 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,117,Great food and pricing was cheap  I recommend it to all my friends 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,118,I didnt like the food I asked for chicken flautas and it was horrible I asked for a agua de horchata it was good but they give it to you in a margarita cup instead of a glass I think to put less  the waitress are nice but the food its a no no I could bearly find a parkin lot I had to park on the back ...ps   would not go back in there   
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,119,This is an authentic Mexican place. I am a Mexican  born and raised in Mexico  and this place reminds me so much of home. If you are an American looking for what you believe is Mexican food that you tried in Arizona  California or any other American state you might not like Los Comales since this is NOT Tex-Mex at all. This is authentic Mexican from the staff to the food to the atmosphere so I would really recommend this place to Mexican patrons but I am not sure Americans can really appreciate it. If you are an American that really knows what Mexican food is go ahead  I am sure you ll like it.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,120,nice tacos for the price. order with corn tortilla and chances are  you ll get one made fresh from masa. support this family business. good spot to watch the chivas play some football.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,121,if you order from there lunch menu you can t get any refill on your drinks so I asked can t I pay for another the waiter said NO.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,122,The place was dark  amp  univiting  the coffee  amp  tea had no flavor  taste like water.  The salsa taste like Hot Picante sauce...The queso was good  amp  the service was ok.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,123,If you are looking for Tex-Mex then this isn t the place for you.  On the other hand  if you are seeking a more authentic Mexican restaurant with fast friendly service then check out Los Comales.  Unfortunately I haven t tried too many items on the menu because I m addicted to the  Mole mi tierra .  This place is pretty festive with the decor and La Banda style music that they play.  Prices are very reasonable and it s a good place to drink a couple of cerveza s and snack on homemade chips and salsa.  Si quieres practicar hablando en espanol  este lugar es una eleccion buena.  Buen provecho 
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,124,I really like this place. Authentic Mexican not overwhelmed by cheese or the scent of a freshly opened bottle of Corona. Tacky  colorful interior seems to make sense  especially when you figure out ordering in Spanish is pretty much necessary. Good mole. Grill master takes the payments while the green onions and tomatillos slow-char on the open flame right in view...  hey buddy  those are burn....nevermind ...see you next time.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,125,Went back for dinner  and the food was just as good. They have grilled jalapenos  which are great sliced atop fajitas. A must try on the East side.
Los Comales Mexican Restaurant,126,Authentic  reasonably priced  and filling   I recently discovered Los Comales and am hooked.  The decor is small-town-Mexican-restaurant authentic  I felt like I could be in Falfurias or Sweetwater.  Bright colored cut-outs adorn the ceiling and there s even a pool table.  It s spacious and clean.  There s room for large parties.  My test for great Mex  not Tex-Mex  is the verde sauce  and Los Comales passes with flying colors.  The picquant tomatillo sauce  which I had with chicken enchiladas  was perfect.  Our server cheerfully tolerated our practicing some imperfect Spanish and even helped me with a word or two  never resorting to English. She re-filled my tea glass without my asking and  miralce of miracles  brought me a new lemon for the re-fill.  Even in the priciest places  they seem to not get it -- if you like lemon or lime with the first glass  then you like it with a refill.  My lunch companion got a combination plate of some kind and loved every bite. His came with a hard taco and the taco shell was home-made    .  The salsa was delicious.  On another visit  I had fajitas and they were great too. I saw a caldo that I want to try next time.   Lunch specials filling and well under  10  with a drink.  I can t figure out Tabitha s negative review below  but maybe she just likes plastic chain food places  or just needs to go back to Dallas . Her nasty trashing of this nice place is unwarranted and the things she reports are not reflective of anything I experienced in two visits.  I can understand taking a place to task when they are rude to you or deliver a bad experience for a hefty price  but what she wrote was just plain mean -- and unjustified.  Ignore her  ignore the endless road work and try this gem.
Little Mexico Restaurant,1,Second time coming here and we absolutely love it  The food is delicious and the staff is so friendly 
Little Mexico Restaurant,2,They robbed themselves of a  50 tip.  Food here was absolutely amazing  but the service was extremely poor. We were a table of 6 and upon being sat the waitress asked for our drink order. 1 person ordered water  so she assumed everyone wanted water and that s all that was brought to the table. No ice  no straws. Every time they came back to the table  they would walk off before we could finish speaking and even went as far to  jokingly  say  oh my god you ve got to be kidding me  when we asked for refills.  Something that should not have to be asked for to begin with  one member of our party tried to order tortilla and was informed  they were too busy.  There were maybe 4 other tables in the restaurant     Like I said  the food was delicious. Everyone in our group has worked in food service at some time  so regardless we were still going to tip them well. It s a difficult job we all know that sometimes you have a bad day. To wrap up this long story  upon check out  one member placed  9 on the table after paying the entire check. I had actually go out to grab my wallet to get my cash. The waitress began yelling that we didn t pay her enough and before we could even get a word out  insisted on us REPAYING to include an automatic gratuity. We paid their newly  required  amount  took our cash and left. We will not be returning.
Little Mexico Restaurant,3,This restaurant has been in operation since 1986. It s clearly a family-owned business. The building is beautiful and the interior is very colorful. We sat ourselves and were quickly greeted for a drink order. Shortly after  we placed our breakfast order  the Protein Plate and the Barbacoa Plate. We got the flour tortillas with them. Both entrees were delicious. I absolutely loved the carne asada  and the barbacoa was wonderfully seasoned. This place was bumping by the time we left  around 11am on a Sunday . I can see why - really good food. It looks like they had a solid lunch   dinner menu  as well.
Little Mexico Restaurant,4,I am so incredibly happy that I gave this place a try and have a feeling I ll be coming here often. The fideo with beef was out of this world. Everything was delicious  really. No bells and whistles. Just simple and delicious  and quite obviously made with love. We chatted with Rosa  the owner  for a while and she was so friendly  welcoming and interesting. She gave us a sample of the menudo  spectacular and apparently award-winning   and now I need to go back this week to order a bowl  Very highly recommended.
Little Mexico Restaurant,5,Drinks came without straws. Asked for straws. Straws never came. I finished my drink a few minutes after it was brought to the table. Start to finish nobody at my table was asked for a refill. Ordered two bowls of queso. The chips were never once refilled. And now I ve been waiting on the order ticket for 10 minutes. Overall sad experience to drive from northwest Arkansas to experience this place as a tourist destination.
Little Mexico Restaurant,6,This place was so cozy and authentic. Loved all the plates we got. We ordered the arrow con pollo and menudo and they were both fantastic  We also ordered a barbacoa and chicharron taco and both hit the spot perfectly  The owner was so kind and attentive. We will definitely be coming back for some home cooked meals.
Little Mexico Restaurant,7,Many  neighberhood  restaurants in the SoCo and South 1st Street areas have been coopted by millenial newcomers looking for a place with  character .  This family run restaurant has managed to thrive workout losing it s home-spun character  true South 1st feel and delicious family recipes.  I frequented this place for years when I lived in the area back in the late 90 s. Now that I m back in the area I returned to find familiar faces running the operation and food even better than my mouth watering memories.  The salsa is spicy and flavorful.  I ve always been a fan of the Jerry Jeff Walker dip  Queso with fresh guac and well-seasoned ground beef . My favorite entr e is the  22.  Poblano enchildas with the same sauce that comes on the chili relleno.  O. M. G.  I happy-danced through the whole freaking meal.    Oh.  And give yourself time for a couple of their delish house margs.   Parking is in rear via a narrow alley between the restaurant and the car wash.  Don t let the cat out of the bag but do yourself a favor and skip the crowds on South Congress for a stop here 
Little Mexico Restaurant,8,The spicy flavor that once was seems to continue to decline due to the changing customer base of people from out of state. This is understandable as you must provide what your customers wish. I ordered the Menudo and hesitated when I realized that one piece was cold. Lots of possible reasons  but they do offer it each day. While onions were provided  no jalapeno  but rates an OK. However  ordering Menudo anywhere except on a Saturday can be a roll of the dice. The Lady ordered the Poblano Enchiladas  which had been her long-time favorite. They came out with a red sauce instead of green chilies and cheese sauce.  She was not too impressed. We will return again in a few months for another try as this used to be a restaurant we frequented.  The staff was friendly and fun. Also  they have greatly enlarged their parking lot.
Little Mexico Restaurant,9,This is probably the first time that leaving a two-star review has  us  feeling guilty. Little Mexico is a very cute mom-and-pop operation that we went to by utter chance  driving home Sunday night  child wants to go out to eat  we acquiesce  it s the first place we turn into . Nobody speaks English but the service is friendly and sweet. The food  Errrrhhhh...pretty bad.   To be clear  we love Mexican dives because we know that they can be secret gems peddling delicious  homemade meals. Not so much here. The Jerry Jeff Walker queso was orange glop with a scoop of some sad guacamole and ground beef surprise. The soft chicken tacos were middle school lunch traumatic flashbacks. And the steak burrito  Don t ask. Even paltry margaritas couldn t wash away the culinary sins.   We re  happy  that we went here so we could support a local  small business  and the place is charming in its own way  but we sadly can t say that the food is worth the goodwill cost.
Little Mexico Restaurant,10,The mole plate and fideo plate both brought me back to my child hood when my great aunt would make these dishes. So excited for hat Little Mexico brought these memories back.  They also have been great during this pandemic. After closing for a while they reopened safely and are continuing to practice social distancing. They also have sanitizing station at the door.   This place has been a family favorite for years  and we continue coming every Sunday.
Little Mexico Restaurant,11,We were nervous about going into a restaurant for take out with the recent health scare of COVID BUT from the moment we walked in the door we felt instantly relieved to see everyone in masks  hand sanitizers cleaning wipes and a fresh clean smell throughout the restaurant   They even have printed menus that they throw out or you can take home    Social distancing in full effect for seating  THANK YOU so much Little Mexico for all the effort  amp  of course amazing food too   
Little Mexico Restaurant,12,Love this place and the staff. So much history in their building. Their chicken caldo is so good as well as their tacos and their salad  amp  so much more . The red salsa is so good too  Give them a try if you haven t 
Little Mexico Restaurant,13,This was just as delicious as I remember it to be  ten years ago.  I left Austin in 2009  hey  don t judge me   The economy was bad    and just returned two months ago in June.  I had my old favorite from here  chicken enchiladas with roja  red  sauce.  I m a real gringo who knows very little Spanish  and while the waitress didn t seem to know English  I communicated just fine.  Hint  for gringos like me in Mexican restaurants in Texas   the first thing they ask you at your table is what do you want to drink   I enjoyed everything.  Note   the table salsa is spicy HOT.  You may wonder  why is there so little in the bowl it comes in   Put a SMALL amount on a corn chip  while at the same time getting a dry chip ready.  Ready to help extinguish the fire that is about to consume your mouth   But it  is  really tasty stuff.  The beans taste unusual to me.  This is not a bad thing.  In fact  I like that the food doesn t seem run-of-the-mill to me at all.  It seems more authentic.  If you haven t eaten here  do yourself a favor and give it a try   I hope to be back soon.
Little Mexico Restaurant,14,So I walked into this place and was instantaneously reminded of my grandma s house. There was an extremely satisfying  homey  feel to this restaurant and a simplicity I loved.   Eat here if you want food that tastes like home. Eat here if you care more about a real meal than decor.   Their salsa is spicy and I liked it. Queso  the one with meat and guacamole  absolutely delicious. My fianc  got the calabaza con puerco and said it reminded her of her grandma s calabacitas. I got the chicken enchiladas with ranchera sauce and it s very very high on my list of favorite enchiladas now.   Overall  I really did enjoy this place. I know it might not seem like much to some  but give it a try. You can tell it s family owned and they obviously take pride in their food and I really do appreciate that.
Little Mexico Restaurant,15,The pictures looked super promising  but overall the food was disappointing. There were 2 cheese options for the enchiladas - Monterey Jack and Queso Fresco. Typically  I don t like yellow  American style cheese in my enchiladas so I opted for the latter. What I got looked sorta like they just wrapped some queso fresco in tortillas and put some salsa on top and popped them in the microwave. Nothing tasted very much like anything. It wasn t expensive  and it was prompt. Just a let down - look at this compared to the other reviews tagged cheese enchiladas   
Little Mexico Restaurant,16,What a great little hidden gem. This place is adorable and delicious. Really feels like you re eating in someone s home with a home cooked meal. Definitely the best enchiladas in all of south Austin.
Little Mexico Restaurant,17,I drive by this place and it always seems to have lots of cars - so I m thinking it must be a good place to eat.   Little Mexico I was there yesterday for lunch and met my son and husband and the service from our male waiter was horrible.  Honestly I felt like we were not suppose to be there or something. Snarky look when asked for silverware and btw   I said Thank You   I got silverware but my spouse didn t and I had to ask again.  Chips and salsa refills was like asking for gold nuggets or something.  Fajitas were okay - hence the 2 but the Johnny Walker Queso was cold and I wasn t about to ask our waiter to heat it up - heck no-way. No bueno folks   Maybe it was a bad day for our waiter  not sure.
Little Mexico Restaurant,18,Easily the worst Mexican food I ve ever attempted to eat. Guacamole made from a lovely mix of unripe and bad avocados does not set a good standard. Carne guisada was more like carne sopa. Chile relleno was unseasoned. The rice was vinegared and salty. Even the tea tasted old.  The table next to us returned his egg and bean tacos because they were too nasty to eat. He was trying to be kind  but how do you screw that up  He audibly gagged when he took a bite.  On top of all of that  the service was slow and poor. Our waitress handled money and washed dishes and served food without washing her hands once.  You re better served going to Taco Bell.
Little Mexico Restaurant,19,Meh. I was told that this place had great authentic Mexican food. It was okay. Nothing to really rave about. Also  they confuse scrambled vs.  fried eggs. The waitress even argued that the sunny side up eggs where  called scrambled  we went cross eyed when she said that.. we aren t really in a rush to get back.  Also the inside is about 63 degrees and the patio is right off a loud intersection. Atmosphere needs work.
Little Mexico Restaurant,20,I m giving this place a three star only because the frozen margarita was a delightful combination of strong and delicious and because the service was great. The food however was pretty bland. It makes me think that they re afraid to add any saz n to their food only to make sure the gringo tastebuds are satisfied.   The search for good Mexican food in Austin continues.
Little Mexico Restaurant,21,A friend said the enchiladas here were better than Pappasitos  so I had to see for myself. First off  there was barely any meat in them and not much cheese. Overall the flavor was just not there. My companion wanted to give their food to a transient person on the way home. The chips and salsa were tasty. The service was fine. Wouldn t add this place on the list to go back to or recommend to anyone. Can t wait to haggle my friend about their weak suggestion.
Little Mexico Restaurant,22,First time visiting.  I have seen this place over the years.  Authentic Mexican food.  I went by for lunch and this place is good.  The salsa was hotter than I like  but addicting.  I ordered a lunch plate and could barely finish my food.  This place is good and I cannot wait to go back.
Little Mexico Restaurant,23,First of all there was an onion in my oatmeal  bacon on my taco was undercooked  we had to track down waiter to ask for a refill for our coffees  salsa on taco tasted old  and staff was talking bad about customers. I couldn t complain to the waiter or staff since we were never checked up on. I was starving and ate it anyways.  Then to top it off they made a homeless couple pay for their meal before being served  What makes them think I won t dine and dash  and they made them sit outside in this cold weather. Then when we approached the subject of the way they treated the couple they tried to lie and say he asked to sit outside. I personally spoke to the homeless couple and he said he never asked to be outside. He seemed cleaner than most folks eating in there.  I will never return and will tell everyone I know about the bad experience at Little Mexico Restaurant. BTW I talked to the owner Arturo and all he do was come up with excuses for the horrible experience.
Little Mexico Restaurant,24,Terrible food service and everything else so stingy that they get mad at giving you straws owners kike that will not last any longer
Little Mexico Restaurant,25,I went to this restaurant for the first time and it will be my last.  Food was horrible and there was a live roach in the sugar jar.  The server didn t seem to be concern at all.  I can t imagine what their kitchen looks like.
Little Mexico Restaurant,26,I m not one to Yelp because I am in the customer service industry and I don t hate on people today was one of the worst days I ve ever experienced at this restaurant from The Breakfast to the service to the aura and I even ordered lunch to go I ll never return here I don t know what people are raving about cuz it s not what it is
Little Mexico Restaurant,27,Discovered this place at the beginning of the COVID quarantine and have been back several times since. Everyone has always been very pleasant and helpful and very large portions of food. Highly recommend for to-go orders for some tasty food
Little Mexico Restaurant,28,Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed in what use to be a thriving place to get good Mexican food. My family and I went to eat this evening and we were so disappointed  we ordered 3 tripa tacos and were in shock when each taco only had 3 -4 small pieces of tripa  we also had a beef fajita taco and the same 3 pieces without bell peppers or onions  i had to ask for bell peppers and onions.   the tea was very watered down. My little one ordered beef enchiladas and Sadler he was served cheese enchiladas. We use to frequent this establishment quite often and after dining there we remembered why we stopped going. We felt extremely rushed as it was 9 pm and staff seemed to be cleaning. The parking lot was extremely dark with no lights. Little Mexico I wish ya well
Little Mexico Restaurant,29,Hidden gem  Great prices  friendly staff  chill vibes and  of course  good food  It s very casual and is never too packed with people when I go. I think they might have live music sometimes  but to be honest I m not sure. If you re looking for a straight forward  low-key Mexican joint in South Austin  definitely give this cute little spot a try   I highly recommend the Arroz Con Pollo. A 
Little Mexico Restaurant,30,Stopped in on a Sunday for a late lunch. Place is small and cozy  staff is very attentive. Both entrees were served super hot  which is always a plus    and within a reasonable amount of time. I had the white cheese enchiladas and a glass of rice milk-yum   All entrees are very reasonably priced and tasted great. I highly recommend the rice milk 
Little Mexico Restaurant,31,  68 ..We have truly pondered this review since eating here...came as a yelp suggestion  and then me asking my foodie friends I got the thumbs up...Yet It fell short in Our Quest....Good....OK..But  Yes We Have Had Better..Every thing was flat on Flavor..Staring with the Queso...No spice  kick  punch  flavor..  ...Of Course we stick to the Enchiladas on the First Round...Rice was fresh  not sticky at all...yet lacked flavor...Let just sum this up....Wife did like the Sauce  but beef by itself  bland...My chicken Verde plate  sauce was Very mild  and Breast meat..DRY breast meat...there is more to a chicken the Breasts  ..Charros Sadly feel short as well....One to the next One..
Little Mexico Restaurant,32,Authentic Mexican food. My family and I went in on a Sunday afternoon  it was pretty relaxed. Very friendly and helpful staff. We had fajitas  taco salad and some tacos. Everything was fresh and delicious. They also come by the tables and sell fresh tamales as well. We will definitely be back. Thanks  Little Mexico
Little Mexico Restaurant,33,Visited on New Years Eve and was delighted once again.  I had Arroz con pollo and my friend the caldo. The food was amazing and the place clean.   They offered fresh made tortillas.   There was great seasoning and portions esp.  with the chicken.   I have been before on Weds when the have a live Conjunto  it s a can t miss.
Little Mexico Restaurant,34,Food is ok. The waiter omge so rude it s like he hates his life. He is not nice mad at questions. Would not of recommend. He might be the owner or not sure he is a big guy.
Little Mexico Restaurant,35,Not bad but room for improvement. Old style place with old style menu. Might return as they have a nice outside dining.
Little Mexico Restaurant,36,I walked in and liked the decor.  Old fashioned Mexican Restaurant that I used to have when I was younger.  I grew up in the neighborhood and was looking forward to a great meal.  Had the enchiladas and enjoyed the rice and the beans which were very good.  Nothing wrong there.  The filling in the enchiladas were good   But the corn tortillas were stale.  I think they had been sitting out of the package all day long because they were tough to the taste.  I was disappointed they used stale corn tortillas.  So close to being a very nice meal.  A little over priced too  about  10.00 for the plate of enchiladas with rice and beans.  The service was ok  nothing stood out with the server.
Little Mexico Restaurant,37,I wanted to like this authentic little place but after three visits I can say the food doesn t measure up to the warm and cheery aesthetic charm. Don t get me wrong  it s not bad I just haven t anything that wowed me. I kinda feel like they re phoning it in. Twice we had to send stuff back because it was cold. Try a little harder  maybe 
Little Mexico Restaurant,38,Been coming here my entire life  for sure best huevos rancheros in the area. I m never disappointed 
Little Mexico Restaurant,39,I finally got around to eating here and what a pleasant surprise it was   The interior and decor may be described as  kitschy   but the food and ambiance is very good. My partner and I had the South First Special  a burrito wrapped around fajita meat  beef   beans  and cheese. The chips are well-made and the salsa is spicy without being too hot.  At least while I was there  the overhead music was conjunto  both traditional and contemporary  and played at a good volume which makes for a pleasing atmosphere.
Little Mexico Restaurant,40,Oh  my goat  they serve fideo here. Hold the presses  y all.  Fideo is my ultimate comfort food - I make it frequently and it warms my soul and fills my belly.  I frequently lament the fact that I can never find it in Mexican restaurants. It s such a basic  yummy dish. Imagine my delight when I saw fideo on the menu at Little Mexico. Their fideo has lots of flavor and was delicious  it s greasier than mine  but that was to be expected. It s not too greasy  though. I got it with beef because that s how I usually make mine  but I m interested in trying it with chicken  as well.   Like other reviewers  I thought their salsa was delicious. It had a good bit of spice to it  which I love. They also make their chips the way I like them.   The tamale was the only item I wasn t so fond of. Maybe I got the sad little reject tamale  Maybe other days the tamales are better  Who knows  who cares. The salsa and fideo are all the reasons I need to walk the half mile from my apartment to Little Mexico.
Little Mexico Restaurant,41,Many people pass this great restaurant not knowing their food and service is excellent. 1980 s pricing and they level Magnolias pancakes    Much better here
Little Mexico Restaurant,42,This little restaurant has a lot of charm to it. I have a feeling it we had been hungrier and ordered something else or even breakfast it would have been a solid 4 star experience. I base a lot of that idea on the delicious salsa Little Mexico serves up. It s some of the spiciest I think I have ever been served at a restaurant. Typically  Mexican restaurants seem to make the salsa work for everyone and not just those of us with hardened taste buds and iron stomachs. This is YUMMY stuff. Can I get a jar to go please   Dr. Fredo and I shared a plate of nachos that were not well-made at all. Nothing much to them topping-wise aside from beans  cheese and chicken plus the jalapenos I requested on the side for the Dr s sake. Our main gripe about them was how soggy they were. Definitely fork nachos.   How were the Margaritas  Nice amount of alcohol. But the flavor of the mix was far too syrupy.   Not writing this place off. Service was friendly. We just plan on exploring them menu a bit more.
Little Mexico Restaurant,43,This is one of me and my friends hidden gem finds  Homey resteraunt. Great service. And cant beat their margarita prices  If you go to their website they give you a list of all their weekday specials too 
Little Mexico Restaurant,44,This place isn t bad but it s not terrific. I am spoiled from true authentic Mexican food and base my ratings on homemade tortillas  and this place doesn t have that- so I m going mainly off of that. The salsa and guacamole are on point and they have a pretty awesome patio that was nice to relax on with some margaritas. The enchiladas  rice and beans are decent- nothing special. Their menu is available all day  breakfast  lunch  and dinner .
Little Mexico Restaurant,45,This is great Tex Mex food. I had a breakfast plate at noon. Taste was really good.  compared to other Tex Mex places  the prices were maybe  1 higher.  I just think this place has been overlooked by those looking for good food.
Little Mexico Restaurant,46,I almost don t want to write a review because I have so many good things to say and this place might have lines outside by the next time we go.  This is my go-to Mexican restaurant for food that tastes as if my grandma made it.  I love the service and kind people who work here.  I ve tried almost everything on the menu and it is all great. I love this place and the location is also great - in central Austin.
Little Mexico Restaurant,47,Little Mexico s one highlight can be a seriously hot salsa  sometimes.  The food is good across the board  but it s not going to change your life. What s frustrated me a number of times while trying to pick up breakfast is that you cannot rely on them being open when they are supposed to be. There s a lot of places to eat at on South 1st.  Little Mexico is worth being on the rotation.
Little Mexico Restaurant,48,I have been missing out  Tried this little place out last week and it was AMAZING Went back today and will be gaining a lot more weight lol I ve tried the fajitas  their gorditas and Monterrey enchiladas  it has all been great and their salsa is so delicious. This is real  authentic food  totally recommend it.
Little Mexico Restaurant,49,I wanted Beef fajita enchiladas and i was told they can t change menu amd that all enchilada plates are already made  i have never heard of a restaurant having enchiladas pre made.  Then i was told if i wanted beef fajita tacos but if i wanted tacos i would have ordered tacos. The waitress was rude and didnt want to ask if tjey could do this for me just this one time and i even offered to pay extra. My mother ordered a Huevos Rancheros plate and food was cold. I really wouldnt recommend this place to any family or friends.
Little Mexico Restaurant,50,Worst place ever I came in with friends at the end I ended up paying and when I see they automatically put their own tip on the check it s not that I m complaining but they shouldn t do that because we are the ones who give them too not then who choose what the tip they want don t come here worst place ever to eat plus the food was horrible
Little Mexico Restaurant,51,This spot has been in our neighborhood for a long time and it has the feel of old S Austin. They are always friendly and the prices are very reasonable. The food is good but not the best TexMex in Austin. I like the fact that they serve breakfast until 3 PM. The last time I was there I just got an assortment of their individual tacos at  1.99 each. They were all good but very basic with just the meat filling of choice and no additional condiments which you need to order separately. Their salsa is well balanced with just a medium kick. I hope they can stick it out with all the crazy redevelopment going on in our neighborhood.
Little Mexico Restaurant,52,Really cute place...I ve driven by a zillion times and finally made it in  The food is great...we had fajitas  mixed ...my friend is doing low carb diet so the waiter was super helpful and recommended the best option...we thought the beef and chicken were great  The flour tortillas are excellent ....I would bet they are made in-house  I m not on low carb diet   the guacamole is fresh and delicious...and the salsa is AMAZING  I judge Tex-Mex places on salsa  typically and this place has it right....super spicy    We will be back for sure  need to try the margaritas   0 
Little Mexico Restaurant,53,Great breakfast tacos and good service. My fav Mexican restaurant in Austin and no wait compared to Kerby Lane.
Little Mexico Restaurant,54,Can t go wrong with this little Mom and Pops place. The menudo is great  Hospitality isn t to bad either. Location is ok - if you aren t looking you may just pass right by it. I d recommend this place to anyone to try it out. Can t knock it until you try it 
Little Mexico Restaurant,55,There s definitely better places for Mexican food in Austin. I came for breakfast on a Saturday morning  and they were completely understaffed. The food took forever to arrive and the waitress never refilled my drink  not once . Even though tortillas were listed as part of my meal  the easiest didn t bring any. To top it all off  the food was only mediocre.
Little Mexico Restaurant,56,I pass by this unsuspecting place each day on the way home from work.  It was always a  Well one day  I ll just stop there  but maybe not today  kind of places.  So when the opportunity to be spontaneous on the ride home arose yesterday- I took it   First off  there is lots of parking  we were some of the only folks in the place at about 6 00 on a Wednesday afternoon .  There are also a wonderful hodgepodge assortment of seating arrangements that you can choose from.  Mariachi music in the background  we ordered some delightful food.  Salsa in a Mexican restaurant kind of sets up how the food is going to be for me.  If the salsa is no bueno  it makes me sad for the upcoming entree.  This is not the case at Little Mexico- the salsa is fabulous   We ordered the Jerry Jeff Walker queso and it was alright and was more than enough for two people.  Both of us ordered the same entree- the carne guisada.  It was superb.  The tortillas were nice and fresh.  The portion was also right - not too much  not too little.  The service was also a selling point for this place.  The server we had was very attentive.  So overall  I m kind of kicking myself for not trying this place sooner.  I think it ll be a great place to take the family when they come into town.
Little Mexico Restaurant,57,I have been visiting this place for about 20 years. Great migas and the Jerry Jeff Walker dip is worth every calorie. If you are in the mood for Tex Mex that your grandmother would approve of  this place is for you.
Little Mexico Restaurant,58,I want to love this place. I ve eaten there several times now. It s so charming  a true  mom-and-pop  restaurant that s clearly been open for a long time. And I really dig mariachi. Their Friday night mariachi gigs are a lot of fun.   But the food  The food is just bad. Everything tastes like it came out of a can  was poured onto the plate  and then microwaved.   I might keep going for margaritas and mariachi  but . . . this is in South Austin. If you re going to serve Tex-Mex  you ve gotta bring your A-game. Plenty of other amazing joints within walking distance of this one.
Little Mexico Restaurant,59,They have terrible service  don t  even  speak English or understand  English  we order the green enchiladas and they brought  us red enchiladas  to top that off they scrap the red sauce  thinking  that it was ok to do that..  NOT COOL  
Little Mexico Restaurant,60,Probably one of my favorite date night spots. Incredible mariachi on Friday evenings  the food is hot and fresh  and service is always attentive and amazing.
Little Mexico Restaurant,61,Great food and friendly service. Whenever we are in Austin this is where we go for Mexican. Highly recommended.
Little Mexico Restaurant,62,The Mexican caldo is exceptional  authentic  with big pieces of cabbage  zucchini  carrot and potatoes in the soup. My favorite in Austin. We have come here 6 times  consistently good.
Little Mexico Restaurant,63,Arrived in Austin famished around 9 pm and since this place was literally across the street from where I was staying we decided to give it a try. Very cute  eclectic old house with sufficient seating inside and out. We waked in to find the Mariachi band in full effect. Menu offers typical Mexican dishes at reasonable prices. Ordered the steak with papas and rice and beans. Very good flavors  not Tex mex-y at all  but my only grip was the marbled steak. Guac is also pretty good  Will definitely consider the spot again when visiting Austin 
Little Mexico Restaurant,64,This place is hilarious. I m not sure how it stays in business because it always seems to be empty  but I don t care. The food is alright  but it s so fucking cheap that it can be just alright and that s fine with me. Next time you have something better to do on a Saturday or Sunday than wait 2 hours for brunch at Bouldin or Kerbey Lane  try this place out. Save yourself some time and some cash. Just don t expect exceptional from a fuckin  6 plate.
Little Mexico Restaurant,65,I had to write this review. You see  I needed to remind myself not to go back here  because I forgot I told myself that the last time.  I know I m in the minority on this place  but perhaps it s gone downhill  Perhaps I always order the wrong thing   The thing that made me go   Ugh  Now I gotta Yelp.  is the taco plate I ate here. I just wanted something simple and quick. I guess I forgot to specify tasty and quality  too  because the beef used was the lowest grade  probably 60-40  judging from how greasy my tortillas were. In fact  the curious thing about my dinner was the rice  even that was greasy.  Couple that with the watery salsa  and the queasy  gut-busting sensations I felt for the next 36 hours  and you may think two stars is generous.   You may think two stars is harsh  Were this an isolated incident  I d concur. But  I have a short culinary memory and  like I said  I ve eaten here twice since the new year  and both times regretted it within an hour.  So why two stars  if eating here is a guaranteed way to quickly lose four pounds the hard way    1 for being so darn cute.  1 for being on the way to my fave coffeeshop down south.  I think this will help me remember now...
Little Mexico Restaurant,66,I must not be that picky. Or knowledgeable about Tex-Mex. Or something.  Because unlike so many here  we like Little Mexico. Been three times  enjoyed each visit. I like the vibe  and the hustlin  wait staff and the big families gathering on Sundays and the cheese.  They give you extra tortillas with your enchiladas . I don t need the carbs  believe me  but that whole thing works for me.   On our last visit  our niece ordered the veggie quesadilla. Total Woman and I couldn t keep our hands off it. The girl finally gave up and let us finish it.  Eating it made me happy.  As you re leaving  consider splurging on a praline on your way out -- or better yet  save the calories and buy one of the little plastic Santos figurines sold in the vending machines out back. We got St. Francis  who looks like he s holding a chicken.  So to recap.....walk in hungry and leave full  happy and with a Catholic saint in your pocket.
Little Mexico Restaurant,67,It s true  Little Mexico is considerably smaller than regular Mexico.   Even so  a stop in on Sunday morning proved fruitful  and we could tell that good things were in store when we waltzed into this breakfast taco haven  dotted with regulars.    As is my wont  I sidled up next to some yummarific breakfast tacos  which came with crispy bacon  mmm  bacon  and loaded with scrambled eggs.  Coupled with the mother of all orange juices  I was on my way.  Service was a little spotty  we couldn t sort out for a while whether our check took fifteen minutes or whether we were supposed to run to the register   but even that got sorted out in the end.  And in a funny way  the imperfections of these places are a little bit of the fun.  Fun that wouldn t necessarily go a particularly long way without some top-shelf grub.  Small wonder then that these guys have the regular following that they do   sometimes a Mexico of any size hides a diamond in the rough.
Little Mexico Restaurant,68,Wow. There is a lot going on at this place.    Man behind me talking loudly on his cell phone.   Children going behind the counter to serve themselves drinks.   Teenager trying to win a prize on one of those  claw  games that little children always seem to crawl up in and get stuck.   Another family gathering around the ice cream freezer trying to decide which dessert to get.  When you have been out late the night before  this environment doesn t make for a very relaxing breakfast  but damn  those are some good breakfast tacos.   So she didn t bring me what I ordered  but it was all good. I have never had bean  cheese and egg breakfast tacos before. And so  she didn t put cheese on my bacon  egg and cheese taco  the taco was plenty good with the super crispy bacon.  Breakfast for two  10 bucks. Not bad.
Little Mexico Restaurant,69,Little Mexico  you are so cute.  The restaurant is located in a brightly painted and decorated house on S 1st with ample parking. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet - she was so adorable  I am yet to get over it.   Their vegetables are HUGE  They look and taste like homegrown ones.  All the food was delicious. They actually have vegetarian options  limited options  but options nonetheless - a rare occurrence in Mexican restaurants .  The rice and beans was very good. Everything was well prepared and made from quality foods  but still reasonably priced   The atmosphere is cheery and bright with friendly and attentive employees. We ate outside on a rainy day - very relaxing. I recommend this place for good food and good times.
Little Mexico Restaurant,70,We might have caught them on a bad day but the service was very slow. They hardly ever came to check on us. The migas were at least HALF chips. Who still charged for individual sodas  Not making a return trip.
Little Mexico Restaurant,71,If you come here on a Sunday i recommend coming here before eleven while everyone is at church  if you go to church and come here afterward you will be seeing me drinking a beer eating chips and salsa  with a smile on my face. I like this place. I might be biased because this was my Moms and my sunday morning breakfast hangout for awhile. The chips and salsa are good  the enchiladas are bueno. So if you already know my rating system for mexican food you already know......  and knowing is have the battle  G.I Joe    rating system for mexican food  i judge solely on chips salsa and enchiladas. thats it. nothing else to it. 
Little Mexico Restaurant,72,I want to write a catchy poem or ode like everyone else  but im tired and frankly just not that creative. I did like little mexico though  I got one potato  egg  and cheese taco and immediately wished I had ordered the migas after I saw another tables order go out. However my taco was huge and delicious  although the cheese was very much some kind of velveeta relative. the salsa is nice and spicy and they have crazy awesome drink specials. I would definitely take some friends to enjoy the nice patio.  p.s.- dont get the enchiladas  i think the sauce might be from a can....
Little Mexico Restaurant,73,Aw  Little Mexico  I like you. I really do. You are so colorful and bright and all the plants and flags make you look so friendly. I visited you on a sad day and though I was still sad  I also felt a little better because you were so cheery even on the sad  rainy day I stopped by.  I hear  LM  that your breakfast tacos are good and I admit I haven t tried these yet. You are not really on my diet  Little Mexico  you are all beans and cheese and chips and cervezas  but still  I will try your breakfast tacos some day. I will not just order gooey nachos and beer and cry like the last time.
Little Mexico Restaurant,74,This restaurant was as much fun as it was good. The salsa was amazing--hotter than most and really flavorful. The guacamole was fresh and interesting  not just the mashed avocado I get at other restaurants. The owner dropped by our table to check on us and visit  my son had been there before   so we felt warmly welcomed. We both thought our enchiladas  his with mole  mine with tomatillo sauce  were excellent.
Little Mexico Restaurant,75,I was pretty new to town at the time  and instead of being nice about it they refused to serve me with an out of state ID. I m almost 30 there was no reason to deprive me of a Mararita  I just got up and left.   The waiter was a real ass hole  he wasn t even nice about it. He just threw my ID back at me and said NO.
Little Mexico Restaurant,76,It s fine after a 3 mile jog walk excursion around Tow--Lady Bird Lake. No wait  even for such a large party  8 or 9 of us . Coffee is mediocre  but when necessary  yes  it is necessary   it works.   I tried a scoop or two of the queso and did not need any more than that. At all.  The salsa was fresh and spicy.  Having a hard time with the decisions  I went with breakfast tacos. They were fine. Maybe not a good measure of the food at the place--breakfast tacos are hard to mess up.   It was cheap enough that I got out of there under  10  yes  yes breakfast tacos are cheap  too  even with a very large tip.  I d give it another shot  but wouldn t seek it out.
Little Mexico Restaurant,77,Showed up to meet family to celebrate the life of our grandmother. One of my aunts set things up with the manager. Arrived right before 7pm. Some guy  who is not the manager but acts like the owner  delivered salsa to our table  sans chips. We waited for about 15 minutes before saying anything. Told a waitress we wanted to order drinks and she said ok. Waited again for another 10 minutes. We said we were a party of 20. At that time we were at least 15. My sister gets up to talk to the guy who acts like the owner and he puts his hand in her face and proceeds to tell her that  somebody will be right with you .  WRONG  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A COMPLETE UNDERSTATEMENT. Find somewhere else to eat. The food isn t all that either. Glad we didn t stay. We moved our party down the street to another restaurant that welcomed our party of 20  that turned into 30.
Little Mexico Restaurant,78,Pretty darn good food. Server was a bit impatient.  Live music was good.  Drinks were just ok.  I guess for every good here there is a bad     Overall  I would go back.
Little Mexico Restaurant,79,Little Mexico is my favorite mexican tex-mex restaurant in town. Their shredded chicken quesadillas are mostly chicken  which is awesome. I have visited far too many places where cheese is 90  of the quesadilla with a little blob of chicken hiding somewhere in one of the slices. you may be thinking   alex  a quesadilla is supposed to have lots of cheese in it  thats what makes it a quesadilla   I dont care  i ordered a chicken quesadilla for the chicken goddamnit  And Little Mexico understands this.  The building itself kind of looks like an old house  which isnt something to write home about  but i dont go to restaurants to marvel at the architecture  i go to eat delicious chicken quesadillas.   Little Mexico is cheap   Please note  Little Mexico offers a wide variety of tasty treats  try the dips  the enchiladas  the salsa  and one of the frozen fruit bars after your very reasonably priced  delicious meal.
Little Mexico Restaurant,80,Good S. 1st food  good queso.  The prices were a little higher than what I expected for a hole-in-the-wall.  The staff is extremely friendly  and they were very gracious to us  even as we lingered well past closing time.  I have to take away stars though for charging for extra tortillas.
Little Mexico Restaurant,81,I finally joined Yelp and decided to write a review after eating at Little Mexico for the first time this Friday.  I live right off the Tex-Mex mile and had never eaten here before. My husband  my neighbor and I decided to stay in the hood and walk to Little Mexico.   I WANTED to love it. Close to home  charming colorful house  mariachis  patio  what s not to love right  Well  that was all there was to love. Salsa was watery  chips were stale  frozen margs were a lime green color that glowed in the dark. If that was all that was bad  I would have given it two stars. I always have cheese enchiladas with chili con carne  Tex-Mex staple  and these were hands down the worst enchiladas I have ever had. The corn tortillas were hard  like they had been made and left to sit under a heat lamp and I m fairly certain the enchilada sauce was made from a can with no meat to be found.   Sorry Little Mexico  it s Polvo s or even El Mercado for us from now on.
Little Mexico Restaurant,82,Used to be a regular  recommended the place to quite a few people.  More recently the quality has been suffering  while prices went up. The final straw was going in at 10 30 a.m. and being told chips were  1.50 extra until 11 00 a.m.  Maybe I m a whiner  but having spent a ton of money in there over the years  really  Lame
Little Mexico Restaurant,83,It s a rare restaurant that can fail so miserably across the board. I waited 10 minutes for the server to take my order then finally got up and went to the kitchen to place it. My food  the  9 migas  came out cold  over-cooked and tasteless -- cheap ingredients tossed together carelessly. My server never returned  so I got up and went to the kitchen again and told her I was ready to leave and did not like my food. She charged me anyway. There were four tables in the restaurant  so there was simply no excuse for how bad everything was.
Little Mexico Restaurant,84,Pretty awesome for what it is  and I like the unique selection of a la carte tacos. I got to try a kind I d never had  or even heard of  before  and I m definitely a fan of that. Try the asado de puerco  Even with a large flavored margarita  we got out of there for about  10 per person  which feels almost like stealing nowadays.  The patio is great too. Nice and shady  with lots of beautiful plants hanging around to add to the ambiance and distract from the mass produced Bud Light signs. My only complaint is that I called ahead to see if dogs were allowed on the patio  was told they were so I brought my dog  and was then told when I showed up that I had to tie her up outside while we ate on the otherwise empty patio. That patio was meant for people to share with their dogs 
Little Mexico Restaurant,85,Nice little hidden spot in South Austin. It is basically a house that has been converted into a restaurant  and the inside is very............vibrant. Definitely not professionally decorated  that s for sure  but at the same time that s what gives it that kinda quirky-authentic air you won t find at a place like Baby A s. Another reviewer mentioned  Abuela . You will feel as if you are in her house.   The food is the dictionary definition of average. But average is still far from bad. I ve never had a straight up bad meal at Little Mexico. I ve eaten here maybe 10 times  breakfast and dinner  and each time the wait staff was constantly asking if I needed anything and checking if the meal was okay  bringing more salsa  etc. So the service is above average  and the prices are low enough that you will be moved to tip them a lot.   Overall  if you re a  foodie  looking for the best mexican food in town  seek elsewhere. But if you re a local looking to have a decent meal at a small mom  amp  pop place with a unique vibe  Little Mexico is a great option.
Little Mexico Restaurant,86,I can t believe the 1-star reviews on here.  Little Mexico is one of my favorite tex-mex places in Austin.  I usually hate cheese enchiladas  which often are a big globby mess of WAY too much cheese.  Little Mexico s are light and delicious with Mexican-type queso  and I love their prices too   I don t think anything on the menu is more than  10  and they have  3.50  large   not really that large  margaritas from 5-7 p.m.  which are alright.  The chicken enchiladas with verde salsa are also pretty good.  The complimentary salsa that comes with chips is probably one of the HOTTEST salsas I have ever had.  Even slurping down a whole frozen margarita did not cure the burning sensation tingling my entire mouth.  And that s the way I like it.  This restaurant is so cute with a very nice wait staff  and tonight they had a man with a sombrero walking around and playing guitar  asking for requests.  The plastic booths may seem kind of cheap  but I think it s part of the charm and my boyfriend who is from a border town says it reminds him of the restaurants back home.  They also get an extra star for not making me wait an hour like other Tex-Mex places  COUGHCHUYSCOUGHGUERO S   It may not be the best food in town  but it makes my stomach happy and definitely solves my Tex-Mex craving.  Minus one star for somewhat tough complimentary tortillas.
Little Mexico Restaurant,87,Little Mexico  Empty. Kids bear roses in the menu photo. Margaritas only frozen. Check slow.   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Ffoodverses.com 2Fpost 2F19641862968 2Flittlemexico amp s 6bcb349c6b3aef2e73043612a31cadd542ac94d79efa92622a054874ade0cafc  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  foodverses.com post 1964   a 
Little Mexico Restaurant,88,Headed down south to eat at the Chuy s  on Barton Spring  on Saturday night. Boy  the rest of Austin thought Chuy s would be a good choice....It was wall to wall people  standing sitting eating drinking waiting outside-you name there was a person in the space. eeh   So per the birthday girl  we headed a little further south to Little Mexico. I loved loved it. The place was easy to find. Parking was aplenty in the back and we walked in a back door to the table. Whoot   We had to wait a while for the last two to arrive  as per the change of venue. But the staff was very friendly and checked on us very very very often. Drinks were refilled and replaced. Chips and salsa were delivered and were good. We all had a good time sitting at the table talking and laughing.  -Side note  there was a very weird musical vibe inside. Like techno-ish and then some weird pop stuff which did not really gooooo with the atmosphere. Oh and this weird saxophone mess  think along the lines of Rob Lowe in dark glasses playing the sax in St. Elmo s Fire  hahahaha  But it was pretty amusing hearing what would come on next.   Anywho  the enchiladas I ordered were good. Beans were good. Rice was acceptable.  They even have vegetarian options which was an issue for our party since one pescetarian and one vegan were amongst out party    I just enjoyed my time there. Nicely done. The friend  and birthday girl  that suggested the place loves Little Mexico so I am sure I will return.
Little Mexico Restaurant,89,In our quest to try out all the neighborhood Mexican restaurants  my sweetie and I dropped in to pay Little Mexico a visit...  Its an eclectic little place  basically a house gutted and turned into a restaurant. Prices were very cheap  the service kind of average... you didn t get forgotten  but they didn t seem in a hurry for anything. We made our stop a little bit back  and the food was unexciting enough that I honestly can t tell you what I had. Seems we had the queso and found it... ok. I want to say I had a chipotle chicken  but it might have been a chile relleno. Whatever it was  I remember thinking it reminded me of a microwave dinner.   I might have been really unhappy had I paid regular menu prices  but this was cheap enough that I didn t mind that it was cheap. If I was still a college student back in my partying days  I d probably like this place a lot. Seeing as I m not... I continue my quest.
Little Mexico Restaurant,90,Not a chain  Homestyle  economical  efficient service  delicious. Table indoors and outdoors. The parking lot was recently enlarged  so there s plenty of room.
Little Mexico Restaurant,91,I just went here for the first time today.  The food was sub-par to wretched. The ingredients used were low quality  the food bland yet over-salted. The cheese was see-through like something from a 1980s elementary school cafeteria.  The service was good and so I wanted to like it. But it was terrible and I m still feeling ill about it.  NO BUENO  It s simple food but they still f cked it up.   You re better off going to Habanero down the street on Oltorf.
Little Mexico Restaurant,92,Sometimes loosening the reins on the impulse-control function pays off.   Take yesterday-- sitting on the 10 bus  on my way to downtown from points north  I decided to stay onboard until I reached Little Mexico rather than arrive early and hungry for an improv show. Sunday afternoon  5pm  a bit early for dinner-- I nearly regretted my decision when I walked into the quaint little house and came upon the waitstaff hanging out at a front table. The vibe said   Really  Do we look like we want to get up and serve you Tex-Mex    But I stuck around  and was rewarded with a basket of warm chips and a wee dish of salsa that made my tongue tingle. Ice water was presented in a timely manner  and the friendly host got my order for a carnitas plate in right away. I read my book and munched away happily  ruining my dinner  in retrograde retaliation for all of those parental lectures I received growing up .  The food was good. Not fantastic  not disappointing  but good. Beans  pork morsels  a little fatty  a little dry-- not complaining  just noting   warmed corn tortillas  rice  and the salad and promised avocado to round out the variety. I stuffed myself and left happy. I d go back-- relatively inexpensive food for the portion sizes given  everything served warm and promptly  staff that do their jobs and are neither neglectful nor fawning  and sweet decor in a relaxed surrounding. Another win for the S 1st neighborhood restaurant scene. Oh-- and La Mexicana is walking distance up the street for cheap-ass dessert.   
Little Mexico Restaurant,93,Had a good dinner here last night.  We sat outside on a very cute porch  looking out on S. 1st.  For the hell of it  I decided to go for the chalupas  which is something that I don t typically orderand.  The shredded chicken was just okay...but the guacamole and refried beans were both great.  Also had fun getting seated by someone who spoke spanish to us...luckily my girlfriend has lived in Spain and knew what to say.  I just nodded.  Word to the wise  the chips and salsa were good too  but my girlfriend got really sick from eating the salsa  which was pretty spicy  and it  uh  sorta destroyed her insides.  Be careful out there.  I give it four stars but she will probably give it one.
Little Mexico Restaurant,94,Nothing awesome  nothing terrible. I had the vegetarian quesadilla and the dish was presented in a lovely fashion. I d give it another shot to see if it s better  so it has potential I believe   You can sit anywhere you want. Also  the place has a nice character to it. It seems like it was once a house that was gutted and made into a restaurant. The staff was attentive and kind.   Certainly not terrible  but not oh my gosh amazing.
Little Mexico Restaurant,95,No complaints  just nothing stellar anyways.  A friend wanted to stop here for breakfast  the kind that comes at 12 30pm . At first blush  I was pretty excited as it appeared to be a little hole in the wall and we were literally the only gringos in the whole place. There were several families  adults and children  all chattering away in Spanish. Pretty authentic   The patio area is adorable. Old metal chairs and plants overlooking S 1st. Nice spot if you enjoy people-watching.  The service was quick and polite. I ordered migas  which were sufficient but nothing to write home about. They were only  5  though  The salsa was very spicy  but tasty. I would be interested in the lunch and dinner portions of the menu. Everything is super cheap and the portions are large  so even if the rest of the menu was kind of  eh  I wouldn t write them off completely.
Little Mexico Restaurant,96,Like a siren song in a sea of South Austin Mexican American cuisine  Little Mexico calls out to me over and over again. I answered that call once again this fine evening.  I had three tacos  guacamole  picadillo  and Antonio s.   Antonio s  Great taco. Guisado  cheese  beans  and a thick-ass slice of bacon. Very nice. Highly recommended.  Picadillo  Good taco  but I almost wonder if I got the wrong taco. I have not eaten a whole lot picadillo  but I always thought it involved carrot. I saw nary an orange root vegetable. Nevertheless  it was tasty.  Guacamole  I added pico to my taco because a taco of just guacamole didn t sound quite right. The guac did not make it s presence known in my mouth - it was all pico and not so grand.  Service  We had a new server who was as friendly and accommodating as could be. The service is always very good here.  Ambience  On Thursdays and Fridays there is a Mariachi singer who adds a nice character to your experience. For me  it s very enjoyable. He might try to work a tip out of you  so be ready   Salsa  The spiciest I ve had in Austin  which is good for me. Not overpoweringly spicy - it strikes a spice-filled balance.   Overall - solid mex at a good price.
Little Mexico Restaurant,97,The most authentic Jalisco experience you ll find in Austin. I literally just got serenaded by the owner and lead female vocalist of their Friday night mariachi band. Can you say soul  Passion  This place is everything a native south Texan Latina craves in a city of granola and brussel sprouts. The margaritas are cheap  strong  and delicious. The salsa is spicy. GO HERE NOW  
Little Mexico Restaurant,98,I can only imagine that the people who gave this place one star were actually reviewing the wrong place. We just took the family there and the puerca asada and mole enchiladas were both outstanding. The asada was tender  juicy chunks of pork in a rich  flavorful red sauce. The mole had just the right touch of bitterness  some of the best I ve ever had in Austin  and there is a lot of good mole in Austin .  The limonada was the perfect drink for a hot summer day  and my children  and the adults  for that matter  were thrilled by the delicious sopapillas for desert.  My only criticism is the plain queso was very unremarkable - perhaps next time I ll try the  Jerry Jeff Walker queso.  Otherwise  I d have given this place five stars. If I lived in South Austin  I m northsider  I d be here on a regular basis.
Little Mexico Restaurant,99,Absolutely disgusting.   I ordered Poblano Enchiladas from Little Mexico one afternoon  and they arrived as naked and hollow corn tortillas smothered in feet sauce. No poblano peppers to be found. I told the waitress and ordered some cheese enchiladas instead. They came out...just reeking of feet. I tried to bite it for the sheer pride of my money  but this was seriously nauseating stuff.
Little Mexico Restaurant,100,I ve been twice but have only gotten the breakfast tacos each time. That s a sign that they are pretty darn good though - I m relatively picky when it comes to b-tacos  they serve them  til 3pm . The eggs and potatoes have a slightly spicy seasoning that you don t find at a lot of Mexican restaurants. The sauce is excellent as well   Not the speediest of restaurants  even when it s not too crowded  but it s worth it. If Maria s is too busy - veer over to S 1st and eat here.
Little Mexico Restaurant,101,Going in on Cinco de Mayo we fully expected it to be busy  and it was. Not Trudys Chuys Polvos busy but most of the tables were filled when we arrived for dinner at 7. At this restaurant you seat yourself  so we sat inside since all the tables outdoors were taken. It took 15 minutes for anyone to say anything to us. No waters  chips  nothing. Eventually we did get half of the drinks we ordered  never received the other half even though we reminded the actual waitress for our table when she finally came over to take our orders. . The long and the short of it  exactly one hour after arriving and 45 minutes after ordering our food with no drink chips salsa refills or the other half of our original drink orders - keep in mind that it was just the two of us - the waitress comes over to us to say that they re out of what we ordered to eat. They hadn t even started cooking yet. So  we asked for our ticket  paid  and left. We went to Casa Maria s down the road which at this point was 8 30 and MUCH busier. They sat us down within 5 minutes and 10 minutes later we had our food.
Little Mexico Restaurant,102,My friends and I stumbled across Little Mexico late  looking for good food after a disappointing lunch on 6th St. The restaurant stayed open late for us  the server was attentive  and the food was AMAZING. Accommodating to vegetarians  as well. I would highly suggest them over some of the  fancier  restaurants.
Little Mexico Restaurant,103,great food  service and atmosphere. get the barbacoa breakfast plate. you can also get tamales for the house. 12 for  10 
Little Mexico Restaurant,104,It s great to come here after a long run. The restaurant looks like it was a former home and it has a cozy feel to it. I love the fact they have a Protein Meal which consists of Huevos Rancheros and Carne Guisada. Huevos Rancheros was decent but the Carne Guisada was kind of watery. The number for that meal is  200 after number  2. I guess it was suppose to get your attention. Service was good. Coffee and food was okay. Once you get your check you have to pay at the counter. Honestly Little Mexico wouldn t be first place I would go to. If my running group had to meet up after the long run  I would go.
Little Mexico Restaurant,105,I only give two stars because I wasn t that impressed.  My husband s dish  on the other hand  was delicious.  I think he ordered the house special.  I got the barbacoa plate and found very little barbarcoa  lots of onions and grease  and was really not that great.  I will give it another try...as always and update my review then.
Little Mexico Restaurant,106,I went to Little Mexico for lunch on New Years Day because we didn t have time to wait at Polvos.   The ambience  mixed matched patio furniture outside  cozy   hard back booths inside  did i see a vending machine    The service  Oh dear... the service was  minimalistic . We could have used more aggressive rechipping and prebussing. And the check wasn t ever brought out to us. But since this is far from the four seasons it feels more acceptable.   The food  Salsa was good  with a little kick at the end. I had a vegetarian enchilada plate that was stuffed with green peppers and it was goooood.   The booze  margarita was a two star experience  I will be back  it s a shame I ve been driving by this place for years and haven t ever checked it out. I need another mexican food dive to call home.
Little Mexico Restaurant,107,I m new in town  was hungry and decided to stop by.  Plenty of parking. VERY EXTREMELY NICE AND EAGER waitstaff  I ordered the green enchilada plate. Good size portions.   The rice was  nuked  therefore some grains were extremely crispy. The beans were really good. The salsa was spicy but not super hot.  The food overall was ok.
Little Mexico Restaurant,108,I have been here several times and depending on if Abuela is here or not determines the quality of the food.  The past 2 times I was there  she was also there. The food came out piping hot  5 servers attacked our table to get us drinks  chips  salsa  silverware  ashtray  extra napkins  menus  and to ask us if we were ready to order.  Food overall is just above average. There refried beans are sometimes over-salted  this is how I rate mexican food.......by the beans.  Great service  just needs to be more consistent with the food. I wish Abuela was there all the time 
Little Mexico Restaurant,109,I felt like I was visiting my grandmother s house. Ofrendas  Mexican posters and family photos line the walls. One wall  dedicated to soldiers in the family  included WWII medals. Cumbias Colombianas played in the background.  What used to be two old houses is now a terrific restaurant that serves reasonably priced  delicious Mexican food.   I ordered puerco guisado  a dish of stewed pork cubes smothered in a flavorful  slightly spicy red chile sauce served with refried beans  rice  a tiny salad and corn tortillas for about  8.   The pork was cooked perfectly  amazingly tender and had virtually no fat. Beans reminded me of my grandma s. The rice was a little on the bland side  but decent. I had enough to make five fat tacos.   You know you re in a real Mexican restaurant when they don t charge extra for chips  salsa or more tortillas. The salsa is fresh and made with chunky tomatoes  onions and chile  including some tiny flecks of red chile. If you don t eat chile  it will seem hot  but for those with an iron tongue  it s medium.  The staff was friendly and attentive and there was little wait for refills and food was served quickly. There s a spacious outdoor patio  drink specials and mariachis play Thursday and Friday nights.
Little Mexico Restaurant,110,We live nearby and my husband loves menudo - so we eat here relatively often.  He says Little Mexico has the best menudo he s ever had  and we live in Mexico part of the year.  I love their beef ribs lunch dinner.  I got it once and it was mostly bone and gristle  so I sent it back and the owner gladly brought me a better plate of the stuff.  Too much to eat in one sitting and very  very tender and flavorful.  We love the poblano chili dip from the appetizer section and it comes with chips  even though it s really too thick for chips and should be served on tortillas.  But they charge for them  some ridiculous thing like 45 cents each   They are the cheap  thin storebought kind  not even house made.   So we learned to ask for corn tortillas with our entrees  they re free then  and use them with the dip instead.  There is no excuse for this  since other restaurants nearby make their own fantastic corn tortillas  Guero s and Curra s .  They charge for them  too  but they re wonderful  not the roof-shingle tortillas this place serves.  They re salsa is like chunky tomato soup - not spicy at all  either.  But if you stick with the menudo  ribs  poblano veggie enchiladas and the poblano dip and ice tea  they re margaritas were really bad a few years ago - we now only eat weekend brunch there  so we haven t tried the margaritas in years  you probably won t be disappointed.
Little Mexico Restaurant,111,Had the beef caldo on 1 3 10 and it was awesome. Came just like grandma made it. Side of rice  corn tortillas and a wedge of lime. The beef was so tender and the veggies were great.   The beans were so tasty to. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Hard to believe some of the other reviews. I say give it another try.
Little Mexico Restaurant,112,I hit up Little Mexico last night with my Dad and little bro. All of us tend to be Mexican Cuisine connoisseurs being that my dad is Hispanic and we are from Houston. I can tell when the men of my family like the food and last night was not one of those nights. My brother and I both had the vegetarian enchiladas and my dad had the Mexican platter. Although they finished their meals the food was nothing to jump up and down about. Nothing was horrible but nothing was really extraordinary either.   We sat on the patio hoping to enjoy the good weather and unfortunately we were constantly disturbed by the noises of Oltorf and South 1st.    On the upside  the service was quick  attentive and extrememly polite.    A couple of years ago I had breakfast at his place and I remember it being pretty good so maybe I just came at the wrong time of day.
Little Mexico Restaurant,113,Little Mexico is a homey  small restaurant where you will always have trouble ordering your meal if you don t speak Spanish. However  I  someone who doesn t speak a word of Spanish  keep coming back for more  They have the most amazing mole I ve ever had  and I ve had a lot of mole. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. They also have great enchiladas. The salsa is good as well. To be honest  this is all I ve ever had there  but what more could you ask for     Order the mole  
Little Mexico Restaurant,114,Good solid sloppy texmex. Great people. Very very very casual.  The quality of the food isn t something to get excited about. But if you want just sloppy texmex it is a solid joint.
Little Mexico Restaurant,115,Don t order the Fideo. God it was NASTY. It was not only cold but it tasted like it was watered down. And the service is slow and bad. Avoid this place like the plague. Jack in the Box tastes better and its more nutritious. At least Jack in the Box s food is hot. I am still glad I went. Just to keep it as reference as to places not to go back to. Got to go for some PEPTO...
Little Mexico Restaurant,116,This is a legitimate three star yelp experience.  I ate here with a friend and we were both very impressed with the meal.  The atmosphere is like what you would find on the Texas coast.  The restaurant has been made from an old house and the inside is adorned with UT pictures   Mexican nic knacks and photos of the staff and different events make you feel very comfortable with your surroundings.  As I looked out the window we were sitting at there was a fountain and different potted and planted plants adorning the outside.  I bring this up because though it looked a bit scary here in the dead of winter I can only imagine what it would look like in the summer with vines growing over the walk up and building.  Now to the food.  The menu has a variety of different and traditional options.  Though I did not have one of the tacos there are multiple options for those who like to build their own and even some pre made options for those that don t like having to make decisions.  The prices are cheap compared to the other Tex Mex joints on south first so tuck in.  I had the veggie quesadillas.  They were wonderful and exactly perfectly portioned.  My friend had the relleno.  Now if your trying to watch the caloric intake then watch out this is a place to cheat.  Though there are a few veggie options the devout vegans will find no solace here this is greasy  cheesy  Mexican deliciousness with all the glory that lard and drippings can provide.  The rice and beans are standard and though a bit disappointing but not a total deal breaker the flour tortillas are not homemade.  The only reason that this did not get another star and I have to admit the only complaint is the parking lot.  It is quite a feat to get into the parking lot because you have to stop in the middle of the street and then zoom across to get into the lot.  This is fine for SUVs  but my car hit the heavy incline that greets you with a thunderous scrape upon entry and when leaving the restaurant there is very little visibility to the busy street and you are nearly forced to turn right so not to be hit.
Little Mexico Restaurant,117,How have I never been here  It has always caught my eye. Yummy  carefully cooked tex mex...  My asada de puerco clearly was cooked with love  and just crispy on the edges. Eric had the relleno which was on point..Just the right amount of cheese. The beans were delicious.  It looks really kitschy and cute inside.  I will go back for sure....
Little Mexico Restaurant,118,Huevos Mexicana. Overcooked. As were potatoes and beans. Caldo  simple. Fine. Nothing impressive. Something you could probably cook at home yourself.
Little Mexico Restaurant,119,Excellent oatmeal  almost like the one my momma makes. Had a couple of yummy tacos. Service was good. Laid back place.
Little Mexico Restaurant,120,I used to come to this place a lot more often about 10 years ago. It was a different area back then  the neighborhoods  and the people in general. I went to this place about 3 months ago and it has changed  and not for the good. The place still looks the same  but the service  staff  and food are not what they used to be. No way can I drop money at this place anymore. The food is terrible and for the quality  well not worth what they are asking for. I m not sure if it was always that way and my palate has gotten much better  but this is a place I will avoid from here on out. The two stars for the past  and not the present. 2000 seems like forever ago.
Little Mexico Restaurant,121,Migas with cheese  that s all I have to say right now. My family has made it a payday-morning tradition.
Little Mexico Restaurant,122,this place gets four stars for being simply adorable. an old house on south first  it has indoor and outdoor seating. if it s not too hot  i d say go outdoors - there are adorable potted plants and colorful corona banners everywhere.  the food is ok. i want very much to say it s fantastic  i crave it  but it s just sort of standard texmex favorites. good comfort food  but nothing that s going to blow you away.   the price is right though - two people - two entrees  big ol side of guacamole  and 4 mango margaritas later  we only spent  40.   and everyone who works there is really friendly although i still haven t figured out if you are supposed to just go inside to pay or if our server consistently is just giving us ages to enjoy that last bit of margarita before he brings the check.
Little Mexico Restaurant,123,This was one of the few places my friends and I were able to eat lunch at on New Years Day. They food was excellent  It is a hole in the wall type of place I will come back for the food 
Little Mexico Restaurant,124,I m a big fan of this place.  Great Tex-Mex.  Love the Fajitas.  Good service. Good salsa.  Inexpensive  high marks for all the rest of the food 
Little Mexico Restaurant,125,I love this place. It feels like Austin from decades ago. It s very casual  the food is delicious  and the people are super-friendly. Fantastic queso  chips  salsa  carnitas  and chicken mole. Live music on Friday nights--usually mariachis. The margaritas are almost neon green  but very tasty 
Little Mexico Restaurant,126,Extremely poor quality food.  Soggy all dark meat chicken and cafeteria-quality beef.  Waitresses are super nice so it gets one star.  I gave this place multiple chances because it s so close to where I live  but it bit me in the ass every time.
Little Mexico Restaurant,127,Food is very good. Green chicken enchiladas are always great. My only complaint  the staff service isn t very good lately. Went for lunch just after the holidays  they were busy so I could understand for the most part. But had to actually pull someone aside to ask for refills of everything. Regular lunch day they were not very busy and still lacked in the service department.  Lady forgot my drink and then when I got the bill and set It aside with my card to pay  she never came back. Started sweeping and doing other stuff i finally had to walk up to her and give her my card.
Little Mexico Restaurant,128,Have been eating here for years  if you are looking for somewhere to drink this is not it  if you are looking for good food this is it. Excellent hot sauce  spicy but with good flavor  i usually eat cheese enchiladas but like the  carne guisada  short ribs  gorditas and sopapillas . If you are a big on fajitas may not be the place either  i have never eaten them but have had friends try them and none were impressed. Have always had good service.
Little Mexico Restaurant,129,I have been there a couple of times and I have enjoyed the asado plate and fideos. Great little place  I would recommend this place
Little Mexico Restaurant,130,For a  5 breakfast  no complaints   We had migas  which is mostly tortillas but you get a huge pile  with smoky refried beans and bland potatoes.  Salsa was spicy and fresh and the guac was great.  Best value on our trip.
Little Mexico Restaurant,131,Very good food. The enchiladas and beans are excellent. The rice could use work though  and the flour tortillas seemed like they could have been better.  I like this place a lot  the service is good  but the food just doesn t blow me away or anything. It s decent.
Little Mexico Restaurant,132,I ate here for the first time on Saturday  and I really wasn t impressed.  First off  for the portions this place was really over priced. Most mexican food places have much larger portions for the same price if not cheaper. Also  the food really wasn t fantastic. The hot sauce was watery and had no flavor. It seriously tasted like very spicy water. The chips were good though. I also enjoyed the guacamole  which was possibly the only good part of my meal. I ordered one taco  queso  and potatoes and it cost  9. My boyfriend s meal included rice and beans with a taco and it also cost  9.  The potatoes were cold  not even luke warm.  The queso looked and tasted like straight up velveta that had been melted.  On the plus - the atmosphere was cute  the wait staff was nice  and I had a pretty good peanut butter crunch bar for dessert.  It could be that I didn t know what to order  but I think I will try a different Mexican restaurant next time.
Little Mexico Restaurant,133,As a person from South Texas  I am always on the lookout for Tex Mex that reminds me of home.  In Austin  this is as close to something that I would find in the RGV. Nothing fancy  but people and prices are great     Big Fan of the Migas for breakfast 
Little Mexico Restaurant,134,Only decent service  but delicious and utterly authentic.  Best salsa I ve had in a while  fantastic fajitas.
Little Mexico Restaurant,135,One of the best Carne Guisada plates I have ever had. Rice and beans very flavorful  really good queso. Salsa was fantastic. Our sweet waitress was hostess  waitress  busser  cashier  bartender  and spoke almost no english. But luckily i speak enough foodie spanish that we communicated enough to get our food ordered. I have passed by this place so many times and never stopped to eat here. So glad i did  and will again and again.
Little Mexico Restaurant,136,This is a hole-in-the-wall type place that has expanded a number of times since it opened. The restaurant is nothing fancy  but delivers good food at a very good price. This is a family-owned and operated place that draws an eclectic group of friendly diners. It s common to see strangers sitting at nearby tables strike up a conversation and enjoy a community meal. There s nothing pretentious about this place just good food at a good price. There s a great patio for groups or those that prefer getting a little vitamin d while you eat. Give it a try.
Little Mexico Restaurant,137,Nice little spot. Best salsa around but prob a bit hot for some. The food is great  service excellent but if you don t speak Spanish it may be tough to order.
Little Mexico Restaurant,138,This was a great spot for a super quick  tasty and cheap Mexican lunch.  We were in and out in about 45 minutes.  The lunch specials are inexpensive and have decent variety.  I had a plate with a cheese enchilada  tamale  crispy beef taco and rice beans.  The beef taco was excellent and the enchilada and tamale were very good but tasted pretty similar to each other.  The service was nice and attentive.  I would definitely go here again for a work day lunch break.
Little Mexico Restaurant,139,Little Mexico is awesome..and let me just say..uhhh it s not tex mex really.. My mother is from Cuahtemoc Chihuahua and some of her dishes are on this menu.. the caldo is delicious and i ate it when I was homesick  mmm chicken fat  The cheese is supposed to smell like feet..it s mexican cheese  I ordered the tacos de barbacoa last time and my only complaint is that it didn t come with the usual cilantro  onion  and lime to season it with. Other than that everything I ve tried here is pretty damn good.
Little Mexico Restaurant,140,When you need a break from Tex-mex this is the place to go. Reminds me of small town Mexican joints.
Little Mexico Restaurant,141,I got the chicken taco salad thing with avocado. i dont remember the name of it  but it was AWESOME. their only drawback is their salsa... it is very liquidy and unenjoyably spicy.
Little Mexico Restaurant,142,I use to own a business across the  street from little Mexico and fell in love with this place. Everything I ate was delicious and the family that owns it are really wonderful. Favorite dish is chile relleno with cheese and potatoes.  Please never close   
Little Mexico Restaurant,143,I always get friendly service when I dine here. Everything I ve tried on the menu is delicious except for the ground beef. Any dish that requires this will probably be a bit on the bland side  just an FYI. So  don t judge off of one dish. The Menudo and the Caldo are the best dishes on the menu. Perfect for cold weather or any day really  I ll definitely be returning.   
Little Mexico Restaurant,144,I ate at Little Mexico for dinner and was not very impressed. I have been ordering breakfast tacos from this place for a while now and have always LOVED them. The Restaurant is very clean and the people who work there are always very nice. I know now that I will just go there for breakfast tacos and nothing else. I am giving this place 4 stars because I just love there tacos 
Little Mexico Restaurant,145,Very Tex-Mex food  it s a good place to just to grab a bite to eat  if you are in the mood for mexican food.
Little Mexico Restaurant,146,Amazing margaritas and very authentic food   Best thing is that they have great prices and a badass patio   Def try this place   It s a hidden gem    
Little Mexico Restaurant,147,I ve enjoyed both times I ve  eaten at Little Mexico.  The best part is the _salsa casera_ which is wonderfully rich with fresh tomato and vegetable notes  with just enough piquancy  to waken the tongue for the main dish    The chicken fajita tacos are classics with onion and  green pepper - everything needed for a late-afternoon snack  
Little Mexico Restaurant,148,Love the food and friendly service. I especially LOVE the bacon  egg  and cheese tacos  they re so delicious and the prices are very reasonable. I get their tacos just about every morning for myself and my girlfriend. I definitely recommend this little gem.
Little Mexico Restaurant,149,Count me in the fan column. Little Mexico is worth it for the salsa alone  which is the best I ve had in town. It is typical Tex-Mex  but done well with that funky south first vibe. Wait staff is friendly and helpful  and the food is tasty. I prefer the lunch period--it is generally easy to get a table  and they don t mind you bringing in a book and reading. Plus  there is no live music at lunch  which is never a plus in a Mexican Restaurant. I particularly like to roll my own from the a la carte menu. Biggest downside  They don t let you take your Mexican coke bottle away  because they return them to the distributor. On balance  I can live with that.
Little Mexico Restaurant,150,Went on a Friday night with a date and it was not packed. There were diners but it wasn t populated like a lot of places on a Friday night. Which is a win in my book. Had three asada de puerco tacos and she had chicken tacos. The food is affordable  authentic  and the atmosphere is good  especially on the patio. Sit on the patio if you can. i really enjoyed it. The service was friendly and the drinks were cheap. Recommended if you aren t too snooty  like me  and you want a cool place to hang out  have beers  and eat good Mexican food.
Little Mexico Restaurant,151,Wow  judging from the reviews it seems many of you haven t had good Mexican Food.  In any case  I was there last night for dinner  we saw this colorful green buiding that said Mexican Food.  It looked pretty cool  so I thought hey lets go in and see whats up. We decide to go in  pretty colorful spot  Cumbia music playing in the background.  The waitress was friendly  asked us what we wanted to drink  we ordered an Horchata.  She brought us some chips and they were warm  but not fresh and were obviously from a bag.  They tasted like those Mission Chips you buy at the store.  The salsa was spicy  but it didn t taste fresh  it was mediocore.  After checking out the menu  I decide on the Carnitas Plate  my wife goes for the Mole Enchiladas  and my kiddo goes for a Cheese Enchilada.    A waiter comes to our table  not sure if he is the owner or not. Seemed pretty friendly  asked us what we would be ordering tonight. I asked him if the carnitas were fresh  he stepped back and gave me this weird grin and said sometimes.  That should of been an indication not to order that  but I took a risk and went with it anyways.   So we order our food and it comes out within 10 minutes.  I had ordered corn tortillas but they gave me flour  I was like  ok whatever.  The plate consisted of some dry crunchy looking pork on a bed of lettuce  tomato  and a piece of avacado  with a side of rancho beans and rice.  I tasted the beans first  they were hard and horrible. They had a weird after taste.  I go for the rice next  same thing  it was crunchy  so that was an indication to me it was not fresh and it  was probably old.  The rice also had a lot of pepper  I don t know of any Mexican rice that uses pepper in it  at least not any that I have had.  So I make a taco out of the carnitas meat  lettuce  tomoto  avacado  some lime and salsa.  The carnitas were hard  crunchy and very salty  overall just bad.  My wife didn t like the chicken enchiladas  the chicken was dry and the mole sauce had a weird taste to it. The tortillas were oily  like that had been soaked in oil.   My kid as well didn t like his food  he ate half of the enchilada.    So I get the bill  it was  35 dollars for 2 adult meals and a kids  too expensive for this hole in the wall.   Pretty much the food was bad  wont go back ever again.  What really bothers me though  is how so many restaurants like this are in business and how these places don t care about the food they serve to their customers.  I would never serve anyone crappy food like this and then charge them for it.  With this recession it looks like eventually only the good places will be around.
Little Mexico Restaurant,152,Depending on what you are after  this is a great place to eat.  Authentic as it can be.  Good tacos and good coffee and good pan.  Attentive and kind ladies working there.  Not much English spoken there though.  If you like authentic and have a very slight understanding of a bit o spanish go here at least one time for the experience of it.
Little Mexico Restaurant,153,Best authentic made from scratch Mexican food I can find in Austin Texas. The tourists eat down the street and the neighborhood eats here. Family owned and locally minded.  Really good food. We love coming to Little Mexico 
Little Mexico Restaurant,154,Seriously  Who writes these reviews  Obviously  anyone who has been to Little Mexico knows that there are probably 50 better mexican food restaurants in Austin. My fiance and I have been on a mission to try a new mexican food place a week. This was our first and we were sooo disappointed  The place is a typical dive type restaurant and  honestly  that s fine...as long as the food is good. The service was fine and  unfortunately  that was about the only thing. The salsa was plenty spicy  but it was so runny. It looked like the restaurant was watering down their salsa to save money. The combination fajitas for two was a joke. The chicken fajita side was all dark meat and the beef was over done. The poblano enchiladas were bland. The worst part of the whole experience for me was the margaritas. Gross  The rocks margarita tasted like a mix minus the tequilla. The frozen one was just as bad. I m a business executive now  but my roots are in the service industry  including 10 years as a waiter at three different places . Trust me when I say  there are a ton of places better than Little Mexico.
Little Mexico Restaurant,155,This place is amazing   Authentic and intimate  The food is amazing and reminds of living in the rio grande valley. I will definetly being a loyal visitor 
Little Mexico Restaurant,156,My sister was visiting from Iowa and I wanted to show her just how great the Mexican food is here. Hard to choose since there are so many good places  right  We finally decided on Little Mexico because we remembered the  22  Enchiladas con queso blanco y poblanos. Best veggie enchiladas in town. Sister was very satisfied with the chicken sizzling plate of chicken fajitas as well. But the thing that won me over about Little Mexico was the mariachi band. Every Thursday and Friday. Good stuff.
Little Mexico Restaurant,157,Great taco meat. Enchiladas remineded of tv dinner. fake cheese.
Little Mexico Restaurant,158,Although service was slow  the food was OK and the atmosphere is warm and Mexicany  Servers were friendly  and prices are affordable.
Little Mexico Restaurant,159,In Austin last night from Houston  home of the best Tex-Mex imo  for 1 night and had a taste for Tex-Mex. I was in a suit and alone so I passed on other spots nearby that were food trucks or had rowdy college kids outside waiting to be seated.   The decor is cheesy and old  which I kind of liked. A guy in a mariachi suit played guitar and sang songs like Patsy Cline s Crazy and The Beatle s When I m 64 and he wasnt bad at all.  I ordered 2 chicken enchiladas and a crispy chicken taco with rice and charro beans  salsa  chips and 2 margaritas  yes  I was hungry . The enchilada fine--not bad but not great. The chicken taco was pretty good  even though the cheese tasted like shredded processed cheese. The rice and beans were subpar so I didn t eat them beyond my first taste.  The beans tasted like they were dumped out of a can and heated. The chips tasted store bought as did the flour tortillas. The real winner here was the salsa   I like spice and this was spicey  It was clearly homemade and fresh. I tried to stop eating it but I couldn t. It was the right mix of flavor and burn your tongue spice. My husband says salsa is my  beverage of choice  because I eat so much of it. I am a salsa snob.  This salsa was some of the best I have ever had  the margaritas needed more kick but they weren t bad.   Tips to the restaurant  Make your chips fresh Make fresh tortillas Give your beans and rice the same attention you have given your salsa
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,1,Great mom and pop shop for breakfast and lunch  Handmade Tex Mex deep In East AUSTIN. Nice People 
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,2,Nice small Mexican place with friendly staff  It has standard breakfast tacos  more breakfast options  and daily lunch specials  but the quality is average.  The place itself has an odor  so it wasn t a very pleasant dine in experience.  Would come back for some take out breakfast tacos next time maybe.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,3,Very good food and service  The food was priced a little higher than I would expect but it was definitely worth it  especially for a local family owned business. Not to mention  the serving size is pretty filling.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,4,How are there no reviews yet   Oh well  I fixed it.  When I worked down the street at the Yeti Coolers warehouse  I ate here all the time and gained weight because of it.  Thanks to me now working in Cedar Park and being on my feet constantly  I ve been able to shed a few pounds  so I can afford to come here once in a blue moon.  My first trip here  maybe six months ago  was slightly disappointing because I was given a beef enchilada  instead of cheese  with my Combo Loco plate.  The cashier misheard me  and that s no big deal  it happens. I still enjoyed what I ate that day.  The Combo Loco plate comes with a beef and bean chalupa  a beef taco  and a cheese or beef taco  along with your typical rice and beans.   Anybody who knows me knows I routinely go to Camino Real up the street from my house and get the same damn plate  except there it s just called the Number 33  which isn t nearly as interesting as  Combo Loco .  Look  I ve sung Camino Real s praises for years  but the food at this place is just better.  What can I say  I m loco about the Combo Loco.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,5,Very friendly neighborhood dining spot.  Orders arrive quickly to your table and pricing is right for the meals.  Glad I found it 
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,6,Local spot that makes you feel at home. Great food for the price point. Quick and excellent service.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,7,We are visiting Austin from Mississippi and were looking for a local place to grab a bite to eat. Found Papa Joe s online and decided to give it a try  When we first pulled in the parking lot  we questioned whether or not we wanted to go in by the outer appearance of the restaurant  but we are so glad we did  Fantastic food and very kind staff and patrons  Some of the nicest people we ve met since being in Austin. Highly recommend if you like small  local eateries    We visited on a Sunday for lunch.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,8,I love this place  Papa Joe s Tex-Mex has the best customer service and also the best breakfast tacos in town   I would recommend to try the migas tacos if you get a chance to come here. The best part are the homemade corn tortillas 
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,9,Very nice young lady at cash register and very enjoyable ambiance.  Good East Side experience. Breakfast tacos - yes please 
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,10,I almost shouldn t leave a review of this place  and keep it a secret. But  I feel I owe it to other Urban Outfitter shoppers to let them know how good this Mexican food is.   In Austin  as you might know  it s hard to find a place that just cooks food and doesn t try to be all cool and trendy about it. It seems like everywhere you go nowadays is trying to have that special...vibe. Well  this place doesn t have any of that...  Here s where you get good food  cooked by a good family who appreciates their customers. What more can you ask for   Sometimes though  I have to warn you  it can be hard to get a table so you might have to order out. I came in here a few days ago at lunch and it was packed  even still I got my food fast. You can call ahead if you don t want to wait.   Hurry up and get in here before the Indiana Jones hats take it over and make it cool.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,11,Good food  great people  funky decor  no dinner hours.  The Goods  - Food. First  know I m not a Tex-Mex fan. In fact I generally dislike it. But Papa Joe s has recipes closer to Mex than Tex. More beef flavor in the tacos and fajitas  not crowded out by spices . Lighter  more  Mex  corn tortillas and corn taco shells. Enchilada and sauce compliment each other. I even like their refried frijoles  usually my least favorite Tex-Mex standard . - People. Friendly  casual  genuine. They are glad you are there and glad to be there for you.  - Vibe. Hole-in-the-wall. Smallish  a little rough around the edges  but very clean. Haphazard but fun decor. - Price. Not a bargain  but reasonable. Daily special and a drink will run you  9.24 plus tip.   The Bads  - Minimal parking. If the place is almost full  you ll struggle to find parking that doesn t encroach on the neighboring businesses. But I ve always found something.  The Uglies  - No dinner hours.  -  Breakfast and lunch only. Closes by 2 pm or 3 pm  depending on the day and business.  The bottom line  Good food and great people will keep me in Mexican heaven.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,12,I was visiting from Seattle and found this place after visiting Boggy Creek Farm. Boggy Creek was a little bit disappointing but Papa Joe s was super yummy.  Should have ordered more and eaten on sight. Some tacos were a little soggy after driving 20 minutes to Pflugerville.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,13,Literally one of the BEST quesos I had. I m picky about my queso  too  Super friendly and quick service. Their green salsa is also very BOMB  Cover your taco in it and BAM  Great.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,14,A real local spot  The tacos are always fresh and hot when I get them. Definitely give their barbacoa a try. The people are always so warm and kind to me. I stop by once or twice a week for breakfast and I m never disappointed.

Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,20,I am a bus driver on a busy schedule.  I placed my order and was told it would be ready in 5 minutes.  10 minutes later I arrived as promised and my food was not ready so I left 1 hour later I got a coworker to call and make sure my order was going to be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived 20 minutes later and was handed a bag.  I asked if this was the same food they had made 90 minutes before and was told yes...why would I want to eat tacos that are 90 minutes old and cold     I was ready to give a glowing review on my own personal food criticize website and would have eaten here regularly  Until next time  this review stands
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,21,Tiny hole in the wall Mexican restaurant but the food is delicious. Chicken flautas are some of the best I ve ever had and the verde sauce on the chicken enchiladas is delicious 
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,22,This is everything a Tex-Mex spot should be. Family owned and operated  delicious  authentic tacos  the al pastor is my favorite so far   excellent customer service  breakfast all day  and a huge menu to match the portions. Truly an East Side gem.

Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,27,This was my to-go place to get breakfast. Today I ordered a barbacoa plate and found a bug in the potatoes.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,28,Yum. Delicious homemade salsa and sometimes even home made corn tortillas. The ingredients are fresher and higher quality than most taco restaurants. Good quality  excellent flavor  fast and friendly service.

Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,33,Hands down the best tacos in town imo  really top notch stuff  also I like all the pictures of pancho libre  also that one girl who works there is real cute

Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,35,Don t be deceived by the look of this place. It is definitely a hole in the wall. You order at the counter and they bring out your food. Service was great. I had the chicken enchiladas with red enchilada sauce which came with Mexican rice and refried beans. It was absolutely delicious 
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,36,I was pleasantly surprised at how good this place is.  I got the Combo Loco  which is the taco  chalupa  and enchilada.  It was all really darn good.  I would be hard pressed to find a better  more authentic tex mex restaurant in all of Austin. The staff is super friendly too.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,37,The best tacos in town  Super small and quaint family-run hole in the wall. Don t miss out if you re from out of town and looking for some authentic mexican breakfast tacos.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,38,Looked like an awesome find  The tacos smelled delicious on the way home  but I was sad to open the taco to find a really long hair mixed into the eggs and cheese. It was obvious  sitting on top  and was the first thing I saw after opening the taco. I don t know how you would have missed this when wrapping up the taco. I really wanted to like this place  but hair in my food is a deal breaker.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,39,The best migas in Austin  probably the best Mexican food in Austin. Awesome family owned and operated business  everything is made fresh to order. I would eat here everyday.
Papa Joe's Tex-Mex,40,Super friendly staff - the guy at the register was cracking jokes and was awesome. Good food and fast service  too
