Mí Casa Market,1,Our good friends live close by to this store and it s a real treat to swing by Mi Casa on the way to visit their home for dinner or a BBQ. Very easy access from southbound Dessau with their own dedicated driveway. Just look for the animated LED sign to know when to turn right. Ample parking spaces so no long hot walks to reach the entrance. Quick in and out to grab beer  meat for the grill  some salsas and guac  and maybe some fresh baked pastries for dessert.  The bakery in here is a hidden gem if you like super fresh Mexican pastries and other delicious hand made breads and cakes. The walk in beer cooler and little wine alcove along the front wall full of wines is awesome. Meat counter selection is good and the counter staff are very friendly. Just keep in mind this is not pre packaged meat sealed up in plastic so you ll want to cook or freeze it within a day or two. The marinated meats are tasty but can be on the salty side sometimes. When it comes to meat the whole point for us is to get it fresh cut then take it to our friend s home and cook it right away for peak flavor. Yet I ve seen other reviews on here where people seem to miss that aspect and forget that natural meats cut to order don t have tons of preservatives so you don t want to let them sit around for days before cooking them.  There is a limited selection of organic produce here but there are options. The produce here can sometimes be a bit hit or miss which is why I m only giving 4 stars. Most of the time everything is A-OK in the produce section though. I m guessing this is an issue with their supplier or something. Produce reminds me of the produce at Supermercado El Rancho. The cost is low but the produce is ripe and ready to be used with minimal chemicals sprayed on it like you find at HEB with their non-organic produce.  There is a standalone fridge with glass door near the registers with various salsas and hot sauces. Be careful as they are delicious and highly addictive  We discovered these because when the kitchen was still open they will include these same sauces with the made to order plates of food.  Hope to see their kitchen back in full operation very soon. Before covid19 struck it was really nice to chill on their huge outdoor patio eating fresh made tacos or tucking into a huge torta along with a cold beer or other drink. They have a soda fountain in there but unsure if it s in operation what with the kitchen being in limited operation. Used to have those Maine Root sodas which are simply divine. Once upon a time they had a couple beers on tap in the kitchen but the bottled selection for sale inside the store is much much better imho. There is a walk up order window on the outdoor patio but it s rare to see anyone using it. We usually ordered inside.  It is a real mystery why the outdoor patio space is not occupied most of the time. Someone might hire a kitchen manager with bar experience in order to curate a menu that suits patio dining. A margarita machine plus hot chips and fresh salsa could turn this into a lucrative little outdoor eatery and lowkey bar 
Mí Casa Market,2,You know BEFORE this COVID-19 pandemic I was going to update my review for Mi Casa Market  amp  go down in my rating because Mi Casa Market has been slackin  on having fresh Mexican Sweet Bread BUT then the global pandemic happened  amp  that put things in perspective real quick    Of course having fresh Mexican sweet bread was no longer a thought but being able to still buy toilet paper  bleach  eggs   amp  meats at Mi Casa Markets fresh meat deli were now essential items that were like gold during this very scary  amp  never experienced before pandemic.  From the beginning of this craziness Mi Casa Market has carried all of the items that were no longer on the shelves at my local HEB or Walmart.   I also have to give kudos to the employees at Mi Casa Market for enforcing the wearing of a mask while shopping.   Stay safe    -Rebecca out
Mí Casa Market,3,Newly built  I visited this market to check it out today and was fairly impressed.    They have a Taqueria inside of this market that offers tacos  soups  burritos  and more. The nice young woman who took my order was great at customer service. The food was decently priced and from the Chicken Fajita taco I had  pretty good eats    The market itself is clean and has a big produce section as well as a big meat market  good wine choice  and of course - beer.  Their bakery selection is wide in variety and looks amazing  They carry most grocery store fare with a bit extra. It is by no means a huge market but it is clean and everyone is nice.    I will definitely be going back to try their Pozole from the Taqueria next time 
Mí Casa Market,4,Everything is marked up heavily and the produce is garbage. Aside from that  it s the same owners as the Texaco across the street  and the micropenis male employees like to say derogatory slurs under their breath like little girls when you re checking out.  I avoid most places just for the purpose of not having to listen to that unprovoked weaksauce bs.
Mí Casa Market,5,I bought a bag of potato in this market. All turning to green and growing trees. That should bring toxic to health if use these potato.  So that I decide to call them to remind them about this problem to change. The problem is the service in this market is poor. They said its normal. I left 1 star not because the potato growing trees but the service. Every body make mistake. However They dont agree their fault and say normal. Toxic go into body is not normal.
Mí Casa Market,6,Finally got a chance to stop by and i will be coming back. The food looked really fresh and the tacos were good as well.
Mí Casa Market,7,Thanks to the Mi Casa staff for keeping essentials on hand and remaining open when possible during bad weather. We needed shelf-stable goods during an 80 hr. long power outage due to the recent winter storm and Mi Casa had us covered. Hope everyone is safe.
Mí Casa Market,8,Although Mi Casa Market was convenient during the blizzard  this store is usually disappointing. It is common for this store to not have regular  everyday items like bread or milk. Likewise  the employees  the young girls who work in the front  are usually... rude. Recently  I asked one them if they were out of bread. Given that she didn t speak English  which is fine  of course   she had to ask a co-worker to translate. This was  of course  after she rolled her eyes at my simple question.
Mí Casa Market,9,Love the tacos here. We go almost every weekend. The people are really kind and very helpful. The al pastor tacos with the green sauce are by far my favorite.   Great place for majority of your groceries too.
Mí Casa Market,10,I was visiting my brother recently after he moved to a new home in Austin and wanted to make dinner for them  so we stopped in here to pick up groceries. I was surprised by how clean the place is  but it did seem pretty new too. They had the meat and groceries I needed  some things I didn t need and the staff were super helpful since I didn t know my way around the store. They actually all spoke English too  which surprised me as I ve come not to expect that Houston markets isn t really an issue anyways   but I think makes for a more approachable experience for some customers that may not shop there otherwise. Definitely will be back in the future when visiting Austin.
Mí Casa Market,11,Great food and low prices and its extremely clean. The produce section is defiantly lacking in quality and quantity.
Mí Casa Market,12,As a gringa boomer avoiding HEB since it s hard to do social distancing there  MiCasa has most anything I could want or need without being so crowded that I can t be safe. Very clean  very helpful staff.
Mí Casa Market,13,UPDATE  THEY STILL CARRY EXPIRED FOOD  This is unacceptable  Date of visit 10 05 19. Zoom in to see. There is a drink  banged up  expired 4 months ago in JUNE 2019. Mind you  this bottle was front and center on the shelf  not something I rummaged for in the back. Be weary of buying any kind of produce  meat  etc from here. I would never.
Mí Casa Market,14,Half price beer on weekdays  less than  2 for  Shiner or Modelo pints. Two people can split a massive  8 quesadilla-- loaded with meat and cheese and pressed like a panini to lock everything in. It s already cut into two sandwich-sized halves. Or a  6 burrito and a  2 taco.   You order inside and can sit outside at a metal picnic table  next to a window where they ll deliver your foods  drinks  napkins  and delicious salsas. If you need more napkins  a no-go box  or a drink refill  simply tap or wait   this window
Mí Casa Market,15,Awesome place that reminds me of a smaller version of Fiesta.  Went there for lunch to their restaurant and had 2 delicious chicken tacos.  To be blunt  blows away Torchys or Taco Deli.  Plus so cheap. 2 tacos and a soda for  4
Mí Casa Market,16,IF U LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD  show them some love     I ONLY have to trek all the way to HEB once a month  now  if  that  much.......Just knowing that makes life pretty sweet    IF they don t carry things you re looking for   TELL  them. They will order it for u     They re  new . So it s up to u to tell them what u want      Mi Casa Market carries L O C A L products    Like.......El Milago tortilla chips from San Marcos  among other items    Mi Casa is GREAT FOR VEGANS   They have vegan cookies that do not have eggs OR milk   Happy Dance   They have tofu  amp  a plethora of awesome FRESH fruits  amp  vegetables.  IF  on rare occasions  u see a sub par produce item. JUST ask them if they can bring u a fresher selection. I am VERY VERY VERY pleased w  their produce. PLUS.....They have plant milk  even chocolate soy milk .......ALSO they have dried hibiscus leaves. I asked one of the sweet cashiers what they were for  she said  oh  u make hibiscus tea w  it   So I bought them  amp  looked up the recipe on the Internet. I now make awesome tea    high in vitamin C  amp  lowers blood pressure  naturally   I will say it again  I LOVE MI CASA       Happy Dance every time I go in there          I LOVE MI CASA       PLUS.......It s nice not having to treck ALL the way to HEB  because I live in Copperfield.     amp    they said they were getting their own tortilla making machine S O O N          I LOVE MI CASA          
Mí Casa Market,17,The market is clean and the food is very good.  I had the chicken enchiladas.  I also sampled the bakery and everything was fresh and tasty.  I definitely recommend it.
Mí Casa Market,18,I was greatly anticipating this place opening up since this corner of NE Austin is greatly lacking in convenient grocery stores.    This place is a like cross between a gas station convenience store and a meat market.    Prices are in line with a gas station  but the selection is greater.  So not really a regular grocery store  but a place you stop off on your way home from work when you really need milk and don t want to trek down Parmer to HEB.    I haven t tried anything from the bakery or meat market or the taqueria yet  but they do seem to have a little of everything.
Mí Casa Market,19,Cutest little Mexican grocery store on the corner.  Literally down the street from me so that s super awesome   And it s super clean    When you walk in you can smell the yummy aroma of the taqueria in the corner.  It s where we get our breakfast tacos from every other morning.  It is a bit priced but hell  you pay for convenience.
Mí Casa Market,20,This place is nice and clean and definitely not really an authentic market...it s the hipster version and very very pricey. Their meat selection wasn t that good either and the stuff I did buy I couldn t really eat they used the same red seasoning on it all and it wasn t good  they are very limited in all of their selections and do not make their tortillas in house. But it s pretty and shiny and new so don t be scared to come in here if a regular Mexican market intimidates - they all speak English.
Mí Casa Market,21,I mostly do quick stop shopping here. If it s 6 o clock on a weeknight and I don t feel like trying to find parking and wading through the crowds at HEB to get a pint of ice cream and some AAA batteries M  Casa Market is where I go.
Mí Casa Market,22,I finally went and adventured to this store. It s decently close to where I live which is nice. They have everything a normal grocery store would have. It s smaller inside then I thought it d be  but they aren t really missing anything per say. The prices seem very comparable to stores around here and the produce looks great  Store is clean and new still. The store probably isn t a place I ll shop for all of my groceries  but it s amazing for those quick things you may need.
Mí Casa Market,23,This market is my new favorite neighborhood spot   Great for grabbing eggs  milk  or an avocado or two without having to go all the way to the grocery store.  They also have a great selection of Mexican marinated meats  baked goods  cakes  and even have a little cafe inside where you can order soup  tacos  etc...  Just picked up my Dads birthday flan cake from here yesterday and it looks so pretty 
Mí Casa Market,24,Don t get the carnitas tacos. I bought several today and they contained shards of bones. Some of the pieces of bones were large  others were small and sharp. Not only is this gross  it s pretty dangerous and a choking hazard. I tried calling them multiple times to let them know about the bones - nobody answers the phone and the answering machine is full in each department.
Mí Casa Market,25,Great and clean Mexican market  You must make sure to grab a full size tub of their green salsa  So tasty. But buyer beware  it is spicy  It s in the fridge right in front of checkout area 
Mí Casa Market,26,This place sucks   I came in over the holidays and they never had tamales or pozole or literally anything else that is on their menu  Ok fine it was busy times maybe that was why I thought. I called earlier this week to ask if they have pozole  since it s been cold I ve been craving it  they said only on the weekend. I called several times today to check before wasting my time and coming here but no one answered the phone. So what did I do  Wasted my time and came over here. Did they have pozole  like their menu shows  Of course not. Did they have sopes  also listed on their menu  Again not surprisingly  of course not. Seriously take items off your menu if you are not ever going to have them   What s the point  To keep people disappointed I suppose.
Mí Casa Market,27,I recently visited this place for lunch.  The place seemed nice and clean. However  had a bad experience with their food. I ordered 2 carnitas tacos and 1 al pastor. The worst     It made me sick later that day. I don t think the cooks cooked it properly or maybe the meat was bad. Whatever it was  I will no longer order from there again   
Mí Casa Market,28,Routinely closes more than 10 minutes early and don t seem to care. Avoid.
Mí Casa Market,29,I drove my mobility scooter to thid store one day last week in sesrch of Neosporin. It was  3.99 on thr shelf  but the cashier did give me a bottle of water for my trek home. Some frozen products are reasonably priced. But i won t go there very oftrn. The dollar general nesr me on braker lane closed and not sure why. Tjat store had a lot of customers
Mí Casa Market,30,Great lunch  beautiful patio  awesome neighborhood spot. Loved the carnitas plate  amp  the pastor. My fav do a salsa in town.
Mí Casa Market,31,This is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and I find myself stopping in at least once a week. The produce selection is amazing for such a small market  and everything is always fresh.  The butcher section is huge  with a wide variety and fresh and marinated meats and seafood. Fresh bakery  cooked foods and a walk in beer cooler too  I m so glad to have such a cool little store so close to home 
Mí Casa Market,32, MOLD in cupcakes  If I could give zero stars  I would.  Decided to check out Mi casa market for the first time.  Upon entering the worker just stared at us instead of saying  Welcome  or  Hi .  Anyways  I was amazed at all the fruit they had and the fact that they had a carnicer a and panader a as well.  We bought some fruit and a pack of cupcakes from the bakery.  The package of the cupcakes said best by 04 18 18. We were expecting guests from out of town so we wanted to make sure they had sweet bread in the morning with coffee. This morning as my sister bit the cupcake she noticed there was white mold all over the cupcakes.  We inspected the cupcakes and all of them were covered with white mold. I am absolutely disgusted and will definitely not shop there at all. Even though the prices are cheaper  I would rather pay a few extra cents knowing my groceries will be sanitary and not filled with mold.
Mí Casa Market,33,I refuse to buy in 2 Spanish stores close to my house because of their believe customers are stupid.  In Spanish or English we know when we are taking advantage of.  Is the second time I bought meat in Mi Casa Market  both times I got the wrong meat.  First time from 5 different kinds of meat I bought  2 were not what I ordered.  I didn t complained and given the benefit of the doubt I though was maybe a miscommunication since I bought a large amount of meat.  Today July first  I went to the store to get some Skirt Steak  the price last week was considered less  but I thought well is because of the holiday and I really need the meat.  I asked the guy if he didn t have available the already cleaned steak since they came full of fat and some tissues you have to take out.  The answer was  we did run out  this price is for the cleaned but you have to tell me the amount you want uncleaned   after we weight the meat we will clean for you .  He weighed the meat and just put apart and continued to served all the customers behind me first.  I understood because takes a lot of work to clean it.  I waited a long time  finally he gave the bag and I paid for  when I got home the meat was not cleaned the way I was promise.  One time I understand selling me inferior product for the price of the prime  the second I doubt      Austin have many Spanish Carnicer as opening and competing for customers.  Mi casa Market is new in my area to get already this well know  smart  practices.
El Pollo Rico,1,I was really craving some yard bird. I decided to head over to little Mexico on Lamar because of this place.  They grill on charcoal which is freaking awesome.  I was delighted to learn they have a drive thru. It s quirky as fuck because you have to drive in the opposite direction and make a U turn to get in the drive thru.   I ordered the 1B which is the grilled 1 2 chicken with two sides. I got charro beans and plantain and also asked for extra onion. I love onions so got to have them with grilled chicken.  The service was friendly and quick. They have a sign at the pick up window telling you to check your order before you leave for accuracy. I did just that.  My chicken for the most part was really tasty and good.  Some of the breast was overdone  but  overall a good score.  Love the charcoal flavor  My charros were just meh. I didn t finish them. Very plain and boring. The plantain was sweet and delicious as you d expect. They only gave me a little bit of onion with my chicken so I was damn glad that I ordered extra. They gave me the whole onion head   YES    I ate every damn bite    Kiss me anyone    Overall I really enjoyed my protein. Four stars may be a bit generous  but  this will be one of my go to places for grilled chicken. That is for sure.
El Pollo Rico,2,Skip to the third paragraph for the main points. I wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt  but what happened after I ate was what changed my mind. I ordered the carne asada meal  probably my first mistake ordering this from a place with the word  pollo  in it  online and initially was told my order would take more than an hour. Called the place  confirmed with someone that I could get it in  30 min  cool. After waiting in line and bringing my food home  I opened to find that all of my sides were wrong. Ok  I d rather not have that happen but I guess I ll always check my order before I leave  fine. What really bothered me  - The carne asada was burned to the point that it was really hard to eat since I had to bite hard - My stomach hurt a lot and I ended up throwing up early the next morning  likely from food poisoning The chicken is hopefully better  and it seems like others have had a better experience  but after the stomach pain and puking I m not taking any chances 
El Pollo Rico,3,When I say this chicken is OFF DA HOOK...I mean just that. I ordered some from DoorDash a couple of times. The sides are tasty  the mexican rice was fluffy and full of flavor...the salsa was tangy and spicy...just the way I like it. The main star was that chicken...LAWD  it comes wrapped in butcher paper...greasy juicy...I dont know and dont care...100  flavor...tender and SEASONED...from the skin on down. I grab the rice...the beans the tortilla... a piece of chicken and salsa and in my mouth it goes  Just writing this review has me thinking about how good it is and may go pick myself up some tomorrow...Ill add pictures later.
El Pollo Rico,4,Ordered the whole chicken and sides  french fries and Spanish rice  The chicken was so flavorful  but dry unfortunately. I also hope they would at least fix the packaging. Napkins were just stuck in there like they were in a hurry. The green sauce was a bit bitter. Rice and salsa were good.
El Pollo Rico,5,Chicken was good and well seasoned. I think I could have been given a warmer piece. Mine was lukewarm. Sides were good. Staff was friendly. Plus is that they have a pandaria inside 
El Pollo Rico,6,The best chicken on planet earth. I ve been smelling the chicken at this place for 4 years due to me delivering across the street but often times I m unable to go grab some food. It always smells absolutely amazing but again no time. Well today was the day and the chicken is spectacular. It s seasoned and coated with an amazing wet dry rub that makes your mouth dance and water. I will now plan my trips around visiting this place because the chicken really is that good. No exaggeration needed. It s really just that good. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful meal with the city of Austin. If your passing by Austin on I-35 you won t be let down getting the food. And lastly they give you so much food.....I got a half of a whole chicken  beans  rice  corn tortillas and even a drink for  10 bucks even  I m telling everyone about this place  See ya many more times in the future.
El Pollo Rico,7,Man this place is amazing  I have to have it at least once a week  The medio pollo  is my favorite  It has never disappointed  Rice is always moist  beans always  flavorful and chicken  is always  made to perfection  Not to forget that green salsa and roasted onion   I could go on and on... I tried their torta and mini tAcos too... which were also good.... but nothing like that  medio pollo. I also appreciate that they  allow you to call in the order  and hAve a walk up window. I ve never been inside but through the wiNdow I noticed they haVe pan de dulce which makes my mouth water as I type this lol  Good stuff  This is definitely one of my  top Austin favorites   
El Pollo Rico,8,This place has become a favorite of mine over the past few years. They occasionally will be a little slow but their food makes up for it 
El Pollo Rico,9,Terrible customer service. Especially if you re not a Spanish speaker. The food isn t good as the location off Riverside. Don t recommend this location to anyone. Fried rice wasn t good. My taco was 80  onions and vegetables. barely any meat. mostly fatty or gristle part. gave this location two chances and each time was more disappointing than the last
El Pollo Rico,10,Gross  Food is not good. I would give it zero if I could. Do not eat here. My 3 yr old can make better food out of mud pies.
El Pollo Rico,11,I was very disappointed in the food I received. The refried beans were old  dry and had a strange smell and taste. Something rancid. The cashier asked me more than once if I wanted refried beans and I see why. The rest of the food was fine  but I m sure no one working there would ve paid for or eaten those old  rancid beans I got.
El Pollo Rico,12,I am from Houston and I m visiting. So I was looking for a good chicken place. Chicken and salsa were good but I feel like cheaped out on the rice and beans. When you order half a chicken they give you a small rice and beans but you would think that if you ordered a whole chicken  you would get a bigger portion of rice and beans.... well you don t. They actually charge you more for it.
El Pollo Rico,13,I love the burger and the chicken and beans are heavenly. Fast and friendly. Very busy    
El Pollo Rico,14,The location is questionable but turn your car alarm on and head in. Omg idk what they do to their chicken but its so good that I forget how scary the crack heads and hookers are and just brave it. Yum   Sometimes you get a live episode of cops happening right in front of you. Hot damn dinner and a show for under  20.00. Hahaha
El Pollo Rico,15,You have to compare this place to El Pollo Regio because they re basically identical. They re both windows that sell grilled chicken with rice and beans. They both charge  8.99 for a half-chicken combo and the both have delicious green sauce.  That being said  Regio is much better. In addition to being in a less shady location  Regio s beans are way  way better than Pollo Rico s. These beans were just sad-looking.  Additionally  some of my chicken pieces were a bit burned and  all-in-all  the chicken was just less appetizing here.  If you re in the market for this type of food  I d recommend going to Regio instead.
El Pollo Rico,16,Such great tasting chicken   every bite you take has great flavor. The rice and beans are delicious.  Several sauces are given to you to choose. I love the green one. The lemonade is awesome.
El Pollo Rico,17,I have not had chicken like this  since I was in my hometown. This reminds me a lot of Pollo Loco  but the good one from Mexico. It feels awesome knowing a restaurant like this is in Austin. If you like Pollo Loco or just pollo a la brasa I definitely recommends this place.
El Pollo Rico,18,They don t wash their hands so we left. Seen em walk straight back there after lolly gagging in the front then went straight to the grill. Just nasty 
El Pollo Rico,19,Don t be scared of this place. You may have to walk past a couple of crackheads  but it s absolutely worth it. Best grilled chicken on earth. Best beans on earth. And best salsa verde ever created. It s cheap as hell. You can eat an entire chicken  beans  rice  tortillas  and a grilled onion for like 10 bucks.  Most of the other stuff on the menu is not that memorable  but seriously  go get some chicken  
El Pollo Rico,20,Love the chicken at these places and the awesome green sauce  But beware the heat varies from spicy to blazing hot.
El Pollo Rico,21,El Pollo Rico  Formerly El Regio Pollo  is probably some of  if not the best grilled chicken in TEXAS. Yes  i said it. in ALL OF TEXAS. The standouts are the cebollas asados  onion wrapped in foil and grilled to yummy transclucent  slightly caramelized goodness.  The green sauce. The  salsa verde . You do not ask what is in the sauce  you just eat the sauce  with everything or by itself. If you re into heat like i am  roll up one of the fresh hot tortillas de maiz corn tortillas   that your order comes with  dip it in the green sauce and disfrute  that s my favorite part of the entire meal. El Pollo Rico is for you. My fiance wants them to cater our wedding  ha 
El Pollo Rico,22,Mst of the Pollo shops have great chicken ranging from 10-14 bucks for a whole chicken half a lime  an onion  and corn torillas with sals  rice  and beans.  This place has great chicken  other stuff is Blah.  Pick up only no inside dining.  It s hood  but it s good   Eat there  You should 
El Pollo Rico,23,Excellent chicken dishes   Tried the chicken quesadilla and was amazed that they used fresh chicken   Bet chicken quesadilla I ve ever had.  Good size.  My friend got the chicken and loved it   This is not the most enticing place to eat  but the food is outstanding 
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,1,Great inexpensive Mexican family fair.  Great for stopping by before heading to the airport or if you work in surrounding area.  Beats any food truck. Recommend for the money.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,2,Its as good as Mexican food should get and the price is right too. They missed the mark on a couple things for me personally but after my third time here  4 stars it is. Will I be back  Yes. Did it wow me  no but good Mexican food doesn t wow you  it brings up great old memories.  This place hit the spot.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,3,Very good breakfast  lunch and dinner. The service is very friendly and lunch is busy but there is no wait. The chicken tamales are fantastic and two was plenty for me as an adult. Don t forget to get some tres leches too 
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,4,Very friendly accommodating staff   Small and casual but has plenty of seating to cover the lunch rush.  Free chips and salsa  chips not salted and salsa little watery with a kick  .  Good food selection. Homemade tamales.  Take home tamales by the dozen or half dozen... call the day before and have them make special ordered by the dozen just for you    Small bar that seats about 6.  Looking forward to going back 
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,5,This is such a cute little place with the best food  Loved the queso  Loved the salsa  L O V E D my shrimp tacos. Thanks Vanessa you were great.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,6,Hole in the wall restaurant near the airport.  Great pork taMale and lunch specials for  6.99.   The pork tamale was excellent. Haven t had one in a long time. We ordered a 2 chicken enchilada lunch which included rice and beans. Very good. The complimentary tortilla chips are very light and airy and served warm. Perfect with their salsa.   Glad we stopped by. And then fill up your gas next door at circle K gas for  2.19 per gallon   What another deal if you  live in San Francisco where it is currently  4 a gallon
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,7,Not sure if we freaked them out or what  my group of seven stopped in after work and not a lot went right from there. One of my coworkers can t eat almost anything so she asked if there was anything but cheese in the queso. She was told it was just cheese  then got it to find it full of things she can t have. We asked if they could just melt some cheese  she was ignored. We ordered margarita  with salt. Explained that the salt was our favorite part. Got sugar. The rest of us are our friends queso only to find it was filled with salt. There was no salt on the chips. I ordered a veggie taco on a flour tortilla and got a corn tortilla. They must have spilled a bottle of salt on the veggies.   Our waitress was very nice though.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,8,I have been driving from San Antonio to this place to buy cauliflower tortillas the first few times I bought them they were great     The last 2 times I bought them they were bad they smell rotten I bought 6 dozen at almost  10 each dozen    I called to ask if they changed suppliers and they tell me no  I try to talk to the owner and I never get a call back  I will never go back . I will be reporting them since they are selling rotten Non cauliflower tortillas    No wonder I have been sick    I m allergic to gluten    I am very upset
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,9,Best restaurant  Looks bad on the outside  But omg the service  the drinks were so amazing  The service exceptional  The food was good  Exceptional service
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,10,Very good  solid  simple Mexican food. Building looks sketchy on the outside  but is very pleasant on the inside. Food was very tasty. Quite a few locals which bodes very well. Chorizo was exceptionally good. Tomatillo sauce very good with just the right kick.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,11,Basic Tex Mex.  Convenient to the airport.  Took courage to get past the outside.  No regrets.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,12,Found this little hole in the wall restaurant and I was very delicious the server was nice and polite and served us chips and salsa for breakfast at no extra charge  most place these days charge additional  I had the huevos rancheros and the sauce was delicious  sweet tea was good not too sweet  only thing that would have been better if the tortillas were homemade instead of store bought. All in all it was a satisfying experience.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,13,Edible at best. Traveling to Texas  looking for some great Mexican...this is not it. Their queso is made from velveta  salsa from a jar you could buy at Walmart and chips are clearly from a bag. The restaurant itself is a hole in the wall  which I was excited about at first  but quickly disappointed with the slight musty smell.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,14,Amazing tortillas and tacos just a short ride from the airport.  Gateway for long layovers.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,15,Great service and wonderful hostess. The food was great and tasty. I wonder if her name is Jasmine 
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,16,Authentic Mexican food  the owners are very humble people and always welcoming  Definitely a  go to  choice for breakfast  lunch or dinner
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,17,Amazing mole. The Verde sauce is also great    Once I forgot my credit card there and they were still saving it for me 2 days later. There s a little bar with a tv up front and a large dining area. Their employees speak English and Spanish  for the most part.  I love that you can specify 2 or 3 enchiladas in corn or flower.  It s not organic corn so def GMO  that s why why flour is important. It s hard to resist their chips though because their hot salsas are so good  both green and red.  Convenient if you ve just landed at the airport or for uber or Ride Austin drivers   Or even to come from other parts of Austin.
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,18,Always a warm welcome and fresh deliciousness  Very reasonable on your wallet and easy access after a long flight from anywhere in the world. Make a right exiting the airport and 100 feet on your right. Slow down or you will pass it.  Try the tres leches cake PLEASE       review by WHITE CLOUD SERVICES
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,19,I discovered this little Mexican Cafe by chance. I ordered a breakfast taco with egg  cheese  spinach  and a slice of bacon. It was the most delicious taco I ever ate. Went back again today had them again. Same thing. Ah..maz..ing. Nice folks too. Very reasonably priced too. Can t wait to go again and try their enchiladas 
Jasmine's Mexican Restaurant,20,The best horchata ever  They actually make it themselves. Breakfast tacos on point too 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,1,The food is delicious which deserves better than 4 stars. Cocktails are average with service being the real issue.   Mid to upscale food prices should come with good service..
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,2,I can totally see why this place has an average of 3 stars  I didn t wanna give them 2 cause I didn t want to mess up the average.  El pastor is definitely not el pastor. It was like a cross between carnitas and shredded cooked pork meat. In short It lacked flavor.  The refried beans had no flavor.  I added salt    amp  my other half was only served maybe 2 table spoons of it on his plate.  The rice was okay. Just ok.  I ordered the enchiladas poblanas and those were pretty good so if you find yourself coming here even after seeing the 3 stars order that    Plus  they have homemade corn tortillas  Yum
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,3,Great spot for breakfast tacos  I call and order ahead which makes picking them up before work a breeze  Everyone s so nice and they have a great deal for breakfast tacos too  Will try their other menu items someday 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,4,This restaurant will add everything they can to you bill to pad it.  Only two tortillas with the big 18.00 fajita dinner.  Be careful when ordering the margaritas as the prices are not marked and it is very deceiving. I ordered a small frozen margarita and it was 15.99  -0  I asked the waitress before I started drinking it and she confirmed it was a small. The small size is only 6.99 but they wouldn t adjust it  saying she said it was a large and I drank it so it was very confusing that she would lie.  I asked to speak to a manger about it because it wasn t going anywhere with the waitress s that decided to not understand English and he wasn t a manger  he was out on a Saturday night  and wouldn t give the managers name.  A lot of padding on receipt  1.50 for two extra tortillas  .75 pepper on fajitas  didn t ask for it   3.50 soda  overpriced   15.99 margarita    The food was only fair TexMex considering the total bill amount for two adults and a child was  69.00. Before tip.  And we drove South from downtown area thinking the prices would be more reasonable.    Will not be returning to this adding extras and hidden prices restaurant.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,5,There is something to be said about intertwining life events with food. The events have the ability to make the food the best or the worst ever  regardless of the quality. Therefore  this review is more in the context of hope  anticipation  and joy while commenting on the establishment and food. I had just moved here from Kansas City and after 6 months I was here with the first woman I cared about since my divorce roughly a year before. I was new to Texas so everything had that  new car smell .    When my almost girlfriend and her mother suggested we hit Beto s I was excited b c the locals know where to go  Driving up it s pretty much what I had in mind for a downhome style texmex restaurant. Big open parking lot  obtuse restaurant colors  loud sign  and a LOT of cars  That means they know how to make food the right way  Upon entering the wait staff  even busy  are quick to pick up the customers and seat them. Straight in front is the bar area  well stocked and the whole restaurant is clean with simple light brown wooded chairs and booths. For me the ground was hallowed as I was out for the first time with my  almost  girlfriend and her mother  Cloud 9 was way under me as I floated to my chair. The menu is HUGE and the red and green salas are wonderful and I m delighted to add  not to hot  The chips fried to perfection but with the woman I loved next to me  I could have ordered beef jerky and thought it was ice cream. Conversation is easily made as the restaurant dampers the volume fairly well.    I was in a street taco type of mood and the pretty woman to my left ordered the chilli relleno s while I can t remember what the mother had. I did buy some nachos to go for her father was waiting at HER house  long story there..... . Anyways the Alpastor taco was a hit  The pork was so tender and oozing flavor I declined offering any to  the L word  or her mother. The pico on top was a nice freshness that made me salivate for another bite. The Carne Asada taco was another hit. I was anticipating the steak to be chewy but nope  tender and flavorful. The guac was fresh and more like a salad than a paste  if you ve been there before. Finally my shrimp taco was a nice addition. The rice added some nice texture while the shrimp was bursting with caramelized seared flavors.    My Texas Lonestar got the Chiles Rellenos. This is the first time I ve had them in Texas and I don t know which was better  putting my lips on her hand or the bite she gave me of her food  The poblanos weren t obnoxiously hot  but enough to keep my taste buds engaged. The chicken was shredded and the sauce was dynamite. I simply love red rice and it was the best I ve ever had. It tasted as if the rice was toasted in lard and tomato paste then allowed to simmer and suck up all the flavors  creating a symphony in my mouth. Unfortunately I didn t try the beans as A-I only have a small amount of space in my stomach and B-I didn t want to go back to her house and  toot my horn . Anyways I was in paradise with my date  her wonderful mother and the best texmex I ve ever had.   Overall Beto s is the best TexMex restaurant I ve been to in Texas thus far. The food was outstanding and memorable. Unfortunately  my female friend broke off our relationship without telling me why and she lived close to the facility. Because of the proximity and me wanting to leave at least one good memory of her in my life  I won t be going back. But discounting my personal issues  I highly encourage anyone to try this restaurant  You won t be disappointed but one word of advice  don t take the love of your life if you re still courting. B c if you break up  you ll lose some darn good Texmex in the process. With that said  don t wait to hit this place up  you ll be glad you did 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,6,Ok. The Enchiladas de Espinaca hits like pure cheesy glory. And I was so wrapped up in eating I forgot to take a photo. Wait  I lied. THE STAFF IS FIGHTING OVER BEATLES VS CLAPTON and then someone played the Abbey Road Medley.   I think I live here now.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,7,This place is WAY over priced and WAY under classed.   The bartender is a certifiable jerk. The wait staff and servers are from a really bad movie.This place is so insulting it s funny. except they took my money.. NEVER again 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,8,I m native to Austin  it pains me to write this review because this was my go-to for hole in the wall Mexican food. Been coming since they opened in 2020 a few servers know us. Got 2 breakfast tacos  amp  found a thick short hair ENGRAVED into the tortilla. The servers  amp  cook acted like we put it there or it was intentional. It ruined our appetite  amp  attitude towards this establishment....All the more reason to start making food at home.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,9,We had such a good experience with Beto s that we are going to try it again. I had the carne asada enchiladas covered with chili con queso and it was heaven. I only ate half so got to enjoy it twice  My husband got the chicken flautas and cleaned his plate. The guacamole was very good though not great but only because I doctor mine up more and not everyone likes that. I get it. The Mexican martini was wonderful. Chips and salsa were on point.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,10,Good food at pretty reasonable prices. I went for an early lunch  amp  they weren t very busy but the server came to get my order quickly  amp  made sure I had what I needed the whole meal. Beans could have been a bit better  but overall it was tasty  This is a non-chain from what I can tell. Give it a try 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,11,Very flavorful food. Steak quesadilla  queso  taco and beef chili relleno were very good. Might be our new favorite spot.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,12,I like this place it stays busy depending on who is the bartender you may or not get a good drink  the food is tasty
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,13,This place is incredibly racist. I ve gone there maybe 20 times hoping for half decent service. We were always the table that was last priority. Regardless of how nice we were and and tipped far more than anyone deserves. The last time I tried taking my family out to breakfast we were literally ignored and two parties were seated before us. Before we left though there was a very angry woman of a different race complaining because she too had been ignored and people were sat before her. The mediocre food isn t worth the terrible and disrespectful service. If you are really hungry I would recommend 711 instead of this place.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,14,Really good breakfast. Yummy green sauce. Okay vibe. I would go back for breakfast  I didn t like lunch as much.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,15,Tuesday Nov. 16th 2021  early dinner around 4 thirty ish. My son and I had dinner at Beto s. The staff had no smiles   no welcomes  customer service within the staff was lacking . Food like usual was tasty . This time I will not be returning . The cup of whole black beans was lacking beans mostly liquid . I flagged down the non English waitress   that stared a lot  and in my broken Spanish mentioned this to her. It took about 15 minutes to receive a new cup.  And to end the dinner low and behold a roach making its way under our table   I mentioned this to the waitress but no response . Probably because she couldn t speak English . Not a very clean restaurant.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,16,As a regular customer I asked to speak to owner  I got hung up on  I tried the other location and same thing.I simply asked if I could reserve the tiny room for a party they said we don t take reservations  I said what if we just showed up 10 people  and the room was empty may we sit there  Same response  we don t take reservavations.I did not ask for a reservation. When I asked for owner email they said no when I said can he email me or call me they took my info and never got back to me.I got hung up on and will never ever go back there.Hey Beto s ...guess how may mexican restaurants are in Austin  You re one I will never spend money on again or reccomend to anyone.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,17,If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. Worst costumers service  could just be the guy who served us  the food was cold and tasteless. I don t mind paying 100   bills and leaving and tip but I feel like there food was overpriced and and forcing the customers to pay 19  of tip is ridiculous. The second our server came to our table we felt like he didn t want to take our order it was 6 of us. His interaction and communication was poor and when I try to get his attention he would ignore us or walk around our table. Very upset with my experience
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,18,I wanted to give this place a try as I am usually going to the awesome other restaurants in the area and after sitting down and getting a  coke for my son and a mimosa for my wife and myself   the menu prices were a bit on the high side  then I tasted my mimosa and it was cheap bitter sour oj and no champagne with the worlds smallest champagne flute. It  would look small in a baby s hand. We decided that we didn t want to be disappointed with our Sunday and to go elsewhere.  After asking for the check and it being  20  for 2 mimosas and a coke  we definitely agreed that it was the right decision to leave. ......   8 for 3 oz of old sour oj       I really hope this place gets it together   I  hate posting this but my neighborhood has standards and this will not fly  at least not for long    
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,19,The 5 star rating is factoring in easy parking convenient location  great service  good food  and low cost.  We have gone to Beto s now about half a dozen times since it transitioned from  Jalepeno s  It is very similar to the previous restaurant  which we liked.  In fact  I wonder if the regulars who have been coming here for years even realize it changed ownership   We often come on a weekend morning for breakfast  and have had dinner on a few occasions  including Valentine s Day   The food is consistently good.  Honest  humble Mexican fair - tacos  burritos  enchiladas  migas  etc  etc.  In my opinion it s as good  and in some cases better than similar Mexican restaurants  of which there are many around here .  I would say Beto s excels in service  always friendly and attentive   and in consistency of the food.  As far as the food  pictures of the various dishes we ve had should appear below this review.  They are generous with the chips and salsa.  Salsa is good  chips are standard  but fine.  Breakfast tacos are very good.  They are also pretty massive.  I would say 2 breakfast tacos from here would be as filling as 3 to 4 at some other restaurants.  We ve had chorizo egg  amp  cheese  potato egg  amp  cheese  and bacon egg  amp  cheese.    The Burrito dish is good  but may not be quite as large as some other restaurants  but decent .  If you get an appetizer or nosh on a good amount of chips and salsa  you d probably be fine.  Not a complaint  just an observation.  Other dishes like enchiladas and nachos are also really good.  When I  order nachos  I usually get a half-order  because even that s more food than I can eat.  Potatoes served with the excellent breakfast dishes could be crispier.  I ll ask next time for  extra-crispy  and see what they say.  I d be shocked if they didn t enthusiastically accommodate such a request because of how good the service has proven to be over multiple visits.  Ultimately  service here is easily 5-stars.  Food is probably 3 1 2 to 4  so 4 1 2 stars would be appropriate in my opinion  factoring in the low cost of dining here.  We typically get out of here with an   18 bill for two.  You can t give 4 1 2 stars so I m rounding up to 5 stars.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,20,Didnt know about this place until recently  now Im there at least once a week. Best green sauce Ive ever had. The employees are super friendly. Food is delish  I highly recommend the steak poblano
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,21,Food was good unfortunately service wasn t  decided not to pay too much attention to the service even though it s a big part of the experience when you dine out. I don t ever leave review on places so that says a lot about my experience the server didn t ever make small talk  let us know it was happy hour  never asked how we were doing  didn t even ask what I wanted to order We just knew because she looked at the next person when she was ready she asked once what we wanted to drink and order barely spoke to us. Didn t even have to look at her to know she wasn t smiling even with a mask on. Whenever someone is ordering their dinner nobody wants to feel like they barely want their order to be taken. Even after smiling back at her and saying thank you for the things she acted like she barely wanted to do  take orders and talk to us give us information on what we needed like drinks  happy hour  food  she still didn t change her attitude much less her tone. We sat for 25 minutes before she finally came to ask her to bring us our bill. When we decided to speak to the manager in regards to her tip that had been automatically taken she said she couldn t and wasn t going to get her manager more than once and wasn t even curious to see why we felt the way we did but instead told us what was missing as if dining somewhere should just be you receiving your food. These are just very few examples of how she acted but long story short she must have been upset she had to work that shift because she very well relayed that message. Can t leave her name because no surprise there she didn t introduce herself the only description I have is she was wearing a purple shirt and a braid. Since a lot of us have been servers we understand how much tips mean and always make sure we tip good which should show how bad this experience was. The older man that sat us down and brought us our chips definitely was the only highlight of our experience even tipped him for it and this was only based off of a few minutes that we had an interaction even said goodbye as we exited. We only came here because my dad has been wanting to try this place for a while now and decided to finally come here for his birthday needless to say we will never be going back.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,22,Caution    Check your receipts  Why they don t automatically print itemized I m not sure. But also  there was a 21  gratuity for table of 5  First of all  it s usually over 6 ppl. 2nd that information is usually given before and lastly  it s typically 18  at that.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,23,I decided to revisit this restaurant after the name changed to Betos. I regret it. We ordered Caldo De res  2 tacos de Barbacoa  1 breakfast plate.  1. Caldo de Res tasted horribly like if the meat wasn t cleaned before they cooked it. The broth tasted like water. We got one potatoe and 1 carrot.  2. The barbacoa tacos were burnt and dried. 3. The breakfast plate. The eggs were dried and the cactus was dry and salty. The Male waiter who delivered our food was rude. When I asked for extra lime he just looked at me and didnt even acknowledge my request. He never delivered the limes. I had to ask another waitress after they delayed in checking on our table. We will never eat here again. It was a waste of  35.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,24,Discovered this gem of restaurant a few months ago    And I love helping out a small business    Beto s is great and they are allowing  pickup  of their menu items during this virus pandemic.  Good job Beto employees and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for still being open    Ms Tee
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,25,Have been in South Austin for the last 2 years haven t been able to find some good ceviche and shrimp cocktail that was delicious finally found my place 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,26,I went to place an order to go and was treated very rudely.  I was not asked if I wanted water or chips and salsa while I waited for my food  so before I left I asked for chips and salsa to do and they wanted to charge me  4.  Beware of how they sneak in charges on your ticket.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,27,This Mexican restaurant is awesome. Their salsa and chips are great. I ordered a menudo to see if they would get it right. I have to say this is the best menudo I had here in Austin. My husband ordered a milanesa torta. He also loved it. I would totally recommend you all try this place.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,28,Came here on a Sunday evening around 8pm. Ordered the chicken enchiladas and a few tacos  would recommend the barbacoa and carnitas . Food was solid all around  and the salsa served with chips was great. Service was ok. Just checked my credit card statement though  and looks like they changed my original  4.06 tip to  5. Difficult to believe that wasn t deliberate. Changing my 18  tip  post-tax  to 22  on par subpar service leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Disappointed.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,29,This is a great spot for a simple  straightforward TexMex meal. Complimentary chips and salsa  which are spicy enough for someone who likes spice but probably not too much for someone who doesn t. And you really can t beat a  6 burrito at a sit-down restaurant. It isn t a fully loaded burrito though so I suggest getting an extra little side of beans and sour cream to really set it off. Place is clean  service is friendly  and the food comes out at a reasonable pace when it isn t busy.   4 stars because it doesn t wow me  but it hasn t disappointed me in the times I ve visited since it changed from Jalapenos.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,30,Great food. Service and value    Was very happy to try it out on a Friday night   Will be back   
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,31,Lots of options on the menu. The food is good  the service is great. They don t list their happy hour prices but it s  3 for their small margaritas.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,32,Was visiting my mom in S. Austin and she recommended this place.  Walked in last Friday or Saturday night around 9 30.  We were promptly seated and after almost 15 minutes or more of waiting for anyone to take our order I walked up asking the  manager  if there was anyone working our area.  I knew we should ve left sooner.  A  server  named Angel  came and took our order.  My mom ordered a margarita  they brought her someone else s drink and never brought mine out.  Food came out much much later and I had to get up and ask  manager  on duty where our server was and where my drink was I ordered almost 30 minutes before.  I ordered the Beto s Plate which is supposed to come with beef or chicken fajitas and shrimp.  It arrived with no shrimp.  Again I have to ask where the rest of my meal was.  At the end of my meal he finally comes out with the shrimp.  Finally he comes over and shrugs his shoulders when I asked if i needed to go mix the drink myself since it was apparent i wasn t going to get it from him.  The food was average at best and the waiter really would ve better placed in the kitchen washing dishes than  waiting  on anyone.  Frankly  my experience at this restaurant was probably one of the worst in many years of dining out.  At the pretty much end of our meal  another server took over our table since it was very apparent he never intended on waiting on us.  Airport Blvd location service this week for lunch wasn t much better either when we decided to try a different location.  Waitress there walked off in the middle of us ordering our food  to go chat with another restaurant patron.   If mediocre to average at best food and consistently bad service is your thing  this is the place to be.  I won t try them for a third shot.  There are too many choices in Austin to eat and the service just frankly sucks at this local chain.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,33,Wow super impressed with this place    Gloria our waiter was amazing super kinda sweet and explained the menu she even was so sweet with my smallest daughter   BUT THE FOOOOOOOD    Wow wow  Salsa was great  Super cute jar the put it  in so you can serve it yourself in a little bowl. I got the burrito Jalisco the sauce was awesome  my husband got the Barbacoa and he loved it    Everything was great  Happy we tried a new place   Forsure will be coming back 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,34,Used to be Jalapenos which was great  but I dont believe this place has lost a step. Great queso and good service. Drinks specials are icing on the cake.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,35,I think this place is just terrible. I mean  well  just OK  amp  with all the choices in Austin  amp  someone chooses this. The staff are snooty. Go to La Posada down the street for nice staff  amp  slightly better food. And it s so hokey changing the name to Beto s after he ran for office. No  nothing changed. I just can t stand this place. When I have been I m astounded at the people eating that crap food. With all of that said  the cerviche is good  if they still have it. Even Arandas would be a better choice
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,36,We frequented Jalapenos so a bit skeptical when Beto s took over. Food and service is good. Portions are big. Prices reasonable except I asked for additional corn tortillas  meal came with only 2  and they charged me for it....really   They might want to rethink that... it was offputting. This might turn others off.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,37,Came with my boyfriend for the first time. It was kinda busy but waitress was nice and food came out in a decent amount of time. We both ordered migas but I ordered Migas La Mexicana. I really enjoyed that the tomato  onion and jalapeno were cook all the way. Each plate only about  9 bucks I thought menu said 7.50 but egh. If trying to decide between here or casa Gs for breakfast  since they are close to eachother  i definatley recommend Beto s for sure. We will definately be back to try more food and maybe enjoy some drinks next time since they have a full bar.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,38,Very tasty and clean. Above your average TexMex joint for sure   Ordered the Mexican Plate  two cheese enchiladas with carne guisada  and an order of Chile con Queso. Queso was very plain  but I like it that way sometimes. Carne guisada was tender and flavorful. Waitress was very kind.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,39,Place was decent.  Was a little expensive  but then again this is Austin.  Property values are so inflated and out or reach for most  that everything cost more  just so people can k ep their businesses open.  BETOs is fine. It s Austin that s the problem.  Overrated and over populated.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,40,Solid place. Food and drinks. Very kind and attentive servers. Love this place  This is our fifth visit and we are still as impressed as we were the first time we came. We will definitely be back often 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,41,Chiliquiles were perfect. Staff asked many times if we needed anything and were ok. Freshly squeezed oj and homemade lemonade really hit the spot 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,42,Ordered enchiladas carbon  got flour tortillas wrapped around over cooked steak with velveeta melted on top. No other sauce. Very disappointed with my experience.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,43,I can t eat anywhere named Beto s. Their political namesake is an idiot. Probably why they have 3 stars.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,44,Came today just to check it out cause was in the area and wanted a drink. Chips and salsa on point. Had some nachos cause I wasn t really hungry and they were good  All the food I ve seen coming out of the kitchen looks so good  Especially the fajitas. Margs are good and they have a happy hour. If you live in this area u must check it out 
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,45,If you are looking for Mexican restaurant this is one of many. I wouldn t eat hear unless your just having a drink. The food was bland and the cheese on the Tex mex plate was like plastic. Don t waste you money on trash unless your getting a drink. Waiters will ignore you if your not speaking their language. I think they are blind on how the food is there  fix the food. I should ve had a pizza instead of this place. I know pretty bad.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,46,Kinda not good. No  pretty not good. I just wanted my burrito in a bowl instead of a wrap. I didn t feel it was a  rocket science  request. After two times sending it back to the kitchen I received the burrito  unwrapped  in a bowl...
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,47,This is the place to go for great mexican food. Be sure and ask for Angel for your server.  This was our first time and because of the excellent service we received from Angel we will come back and I am going to recommend this place to everyone. Food outstanding but I base my return to a place on customer service then food. Keep up the good job Angel.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,48,Service good  food OK. Food like eating in Harlingen or down in so. Texas. A  4.99 margarita which was good. But why eat here when Casa Garcia is across street on Wm. Cannon and has excellent  food and a  5 margarita  too. Asked waiter that question and he said  Betos was more traditional Mexican food. I do not see it unless they have dishes that are not available elsewhere. What was their corporate site locator thinking. We need a different type of restaurant here. Maybe a good Italian.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,49,family oriented tranquil atmo pero sometimes  quieremos bilar   Come on with the jams sometime    food has been very good compared to some places...viva la  comida Mexicana  Mexicana       Chips y salsa de bomb dot com
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,50,I used to be a regular at Jalape os and when it became Beto s I decided to give it a chance. I truly enjoyed the change  the food was excellent m as was the service. So why did I give it only one star  Well  I went there tonight for dinner. It was late and I got there at 9 30  they close at 10PM  and was looking forward to dinner. As I entered the restaurant  I was told  remember  it is now 9 30PM  by the hostess that I would have to order  To Go.  I would not be allowed to sit down and enjoy my dinner in the restaurant. When they say they close at 10PM  that means they lock the doors at 10PM. So I ended up at La Posada  also closes at 10PM  but that means they close the kitchen  not lock the doors. We were out of there by 10 15 after arriving at 9 40PM   I usually went to Beto s around once a week  spent around 30 to 50 bucks and recommended it to all my friends. No more. The Hostess at Beto s said that this was the manager s orders. Maybe the owner would like to know that his  or her  manager just cost hime 50 bucks. I know if I were the owner  I would be looking for a new manager. One star for their insulting response to my arrival time.
Beto's Restaurant & Bar,51,We decided to try this place out because my husband found it on the new and hot section of yelp. The pictures of the food looked pretty good and it was fairly close to our house. I have been looking for a good Mexican spot and was looking forward to trying the food to see if it s as good as back home in CA. This place was not. Not that it was bad. Just wasn t great. Just ok. I got chicken enchiladas and my husband got the poblano ones I think. He said his was really good. Mine were decent. They weren t very hot though. And the beans were very skimpy. I ordered a half order of chicken quesadilla for my kids and they ate some of it so I guess that means it was ok. I also got an horchata and that was good. The chips and salsa were pretty good but they didn t refill our chips. And the service left something to be desired. The guy who took our order was fine  but didn t smile or anything. Would I come back  Maybe but I d try all the other Mexican spots first.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,I have had mixed experiences at this specific Chipotle location.   There have been times when my food is ready to be picked up on time and tastes fresh.   There have been other times when it takes over 15 minutes to get my order  and the food does not taste good.   It always seems like the staff is overwhelmed which is what causes order delays.   I would recommend ordering food ahead of time to avoid waiting for your food.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,Wow  service is bad. I don t generally leave reviews  but this experience deserves it. Two stars because food is good and it s mostly just one employee  but come on guys. The burrito gets made with all the fillings in one ball in the middle. The young woman pushes down the center  balls it up and makes a huge tear  rolls burrito over to tuck folds  and makes another huge tear. She looks up  That s ok  right   I say laughingly  No  let s remake that please.  Her  Ugh for real   Me  disbelievingly laughingly   Yes for real  let s get a new tortilla going  that one is ripped...  She says with a teeth click  Ah it won t rip.  She rolls it up  rings me up and walks off.    I didn t want to push the issue  so I go sit at a table instead of taking to go. I go back to the table  open it up  still huge rip. I try my best to eat it. Ridiculous. I get in line after less than a minute of sitting down  order another burrito  and an empty bowl container with lid. At no point did anyone  Several people heard this exchange  ask if everything was alright for me  or why I wanted an empty bowl. Paid for second burrito  boxed up first one to eat like it s a bowl  and left.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,Forgot my three sides and hit two quesadillas and it was 30 bucks bruh Friday night crew wack ash fr smh yall work there and complain about working there then Why you work there I ll serve y all next time I ll bless y all up for lunch I ll pay for y all to eat good
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,I love Chipotle  but this location is gross. Came on a Friday night and the rude kid making my bowl slammed his hands down on the counter and demanded my order  after ignoring me for a good five minutes. He then slipped all the ingredients in my bowl and added way too much of everything  items were spilling out as I tried to eat. Worst experience ever  I go to the 4400 North Lamar location at least twice a week and am never treated so dismissively or ever have a bad experience. I ll never go to this location again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,I was really disappointed in the portions in a bowl. I received plenty of rice  beans  amp  lettuce but very meager amount chicken  amp  roasted veggies. Additionally  the manager basically chewed out employees about doing  5 of _______ instead 4.  Felt uncomfortable.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,So the only reason I am giving it is due to the fact that they only added about 6 pieces of steak. That one thing I hate about the Chipotles   they are very stingy when it comes to the Steak. It might as well been a vegetarian burrito. And at  10    Not worth it .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,This location is terrible. Almost every order is either extremely undersized or completely wrong. I waited 45 minutes to receive a completely wrong order for probably the 6th time. If there was a way to order delivery from a location 15 minutes farther away  I would do that without hesitation.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,I received an email for a free queso side. I first went to the Chipotle on Lamar. The doors were locked. After some time a female Latina came to the door and asked if it was a pick up order. I said  no. Another person trying get in asked if he could order it online. She said no. We re not trying to take online orders either. We ve got a little situation going on here. It seemed like there might be some issue with employees. So I  with a stream of other would be customers left. I went to the Chipotle on Oltorf. I get there and I m the only person in line. Another Latina is poking her finger what looked like at meat in a plastic bag. She s talking to another employee and ignoring me. She takes me through the line with the greatest of ambivalence. I asked for the side of queso and asked how I can use the queso22 code. She said that it s only for online orders. That really burst my Chipotle bubble. I went ahead and paid anyway. As I was getting my tea  I realized that the queso disruption caused me to forget to order chip. I took my order back to the empty counter and I advised a male that I did not want it any longer. I turned and left. I know there are issues to staff businesses. It will be a long time before I ever consider going to a Chipotle again  if ever. I am disappointed.   I received a pat response reply. I m done with Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,No shade on Chipotle  I love me some tofu sofritas  but this is the worst one I ve ever been to. Chipotle has been my savior on long road trips  so trust me  I m not stranger to the formula.   I ordered two bowls online because it s 2020 and what else would you do  To their credit  my food was ready very quickly  probably 15 minutes after I hit send. It s actually impressive how cold it all was for being so  fresh.   Most importantly and deeply disappointingly  half the toppings were missing on both  the containers were miserably underweight  and the tortilla on the side that I paid extra for was conveniently absent. No rice  no corn  no joy.   What the hell Chipotle. After all of these years. What did I ever do to you.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,Very clean establishment and well-prepared meals. Just as good as any other Chipotle I ve been too. We have eaten at this one about 5 times. Love Chipotle 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,I m still in disbelief about how underweight my chipotle bowl was this evening. It s almost laughable and this is probably the fourth time in recent months I have received it this way. For the price of a bowl I expect so much more and I m sad to say I won t be returning to this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,Food is great but evening staff needs help. There is always 1 person doing online and in person and wait is about 20 min in line. Not very efficient compared to other chipotle s. Management please ask the cash register to help the 1  employee making in person and to go orders so there are at least two people to get the line moving.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,Chipotle has a new employee who only knows how to grab the smallest portion available. He didn t close our food either. My car is covered in grease. It was such a disaster I won t be going back to this location ever.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,Echoing the reviews below. Online orders are consistently ready well past their  promised  time and are almost guaranteed to be wrong. Quality control and accuracy at this location are incredibly poor. I would avoid this location for online orders especially.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,There is a certain standard you expect from dining at a Chipotle  you know what to expect. This location however  is the exception. No matter how simple my order is  they just can t get it right. What s worse is they are unapologetic and act like it is an inconvenience to them to have to make your food correctly. The convenience of this location has kept me coming back  today was the last straw.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,I just carried out from this location and didn t have any issues with my order upon my arrival back to my office. This location was up to par on cleanliness. The order processing line was efficient  which is most important to me on my half hour lunch. The customer service was good but not great. The chicken in my salad was a little on the skimpy side. My guacamole was green and not brown  the remainder of my food wash fresh too. I ordered a tea  went to the drink counter only to realize there wasn t any lemons.  Overall positive experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,I WOULD GIVE THIS PLACE A ZERO STARS IF I COULD. With COVID going on ... nothing is grosser than finding a hair in your burrito. IM DISGUSTED this is apparently a unsanitary place and you should definitely stay away.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,The phone rang ten times and the lady answered with an exasperated  Hello    No thanks- be professional 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,Normally this place is great but they have not had my order ahead pick up meal ready at its specified time two times in a row now. This is unacceptable. You order ahead for a reason. Not only is having to wait annoying  but it s the lack of urgency by the staff to get you your food. Please get the order ahead pick up times fixed or I will stop ordering all together.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,Looking for an Inexpensive Big Burrito Bomb   BOOM...you just found it   And you just found it on South Lamar. What can I say that people don t already know about this place... Well not much.  You want a burrito    Yes You want a BIG burrito   Yes You have limited funds   Yes You want possibly 2 meals in 1   Yes You eating on the go   Yes You want the option of tacos   Yes You want the option of a bowl   Yes You a vegetarian or wanna be one   Yes You eat everything and want to eat everything at once   Yes  If you said Yes to any of this questions listed above...Then that s the only reasoning you need to come spend your money here  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,I go to Chipotle a couple times a week  and this has by far been my absolute worst experience ever  First I got a burrito bowl and I m not sure if the person helping me had RBF or just reacted to my question  but when I asked them to tap the beans to dry them out a bit she made it seem as if I was asking a major inconvenience. Not only that she didn t even really let any of he liquid run off.   After that they skimped on all the ingredients  it looked like burrito bowl portioned for child. Overall the customer service was rubbish and it didn t seem like anyone working there wanted to be there. They were rude when I asked them for an extra tortilla. The woman inconvenienced when I asked for a lid for my bowl. And there were five people down the line who made the process take so much longer. It was unorganized  unhelpful and by far the worst experience I ve ever had.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,This location has management that doesn t care  they begin clean up and putting all chairs up for no customers to sit two hours early. I usually have to go toward the end of the night because of work and most times the employees begin spraying tables with chemicals right next to me while I eat  it s plain and simple  THEY. DONT. CARE. The guacamole is old  all taco shells and chips stale  steak tastes like cardboard on most days and chicken might as well be canned. The ice machine is out almost always and the employees act as if when you walk in that you ve inconvenienced them. This is the worst location I ve been to out of all the states I have lived in. No one cares and the food shows.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,Love Chipotle. For a place that is based around burritos  they sure do suck at making them. I m about tired of them making my burrito as if they hate me. NO  I don t want a pound of rice. NO  I don t need an equal portion of beans. Oh thanks for an entire ladle of hot sauce and chicken juice. Then they go to roll is and make a huge mess which requires two pieces of foil. Cool. Can t wait to go eat my soggy soaked burrito. Good job. Is this how you would prepare a burrito for yourself  McDoubt it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,This place use to be great  As of late  poor customer service and unsanitary. Keep an eye on how your food is prepared.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,Surprise  My order was made incorrectly again. It s unfortunate because I love Chipotle and this is the only location close to where I live  so I don t really have much of a choice if I want it to go.   You d think dining in would remove the possibility of food being made incorrectly  but that is not the case. Their renditions of the company recipes are always subpar compared to other locations  ESPECIALLY their guacamole. This is probably because most of the time  their staff is getting stoned behind their trash enclosure and are too baked to follow the recipes correctly. News flash  you re not being inconspicuous if I can see you toking from the kitchen line.    I am happy that I work further away so I can go to a different location that actually has their restaurant together.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,By far the worst location in Austin. Don t go here unless you want your entire bowl covered in sour cream and guac. Not to mention  the workers couldn t even put the lid on right and everything started to leak.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,Great place  very consistent.  I really hate that you can t add a tip on credit card receipt.. who carries cash these days  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,I don t think this location is stingy on portions  as most of their Yelp complaints say.  I do think they have THE WORST customer service. I get workers batting their eyes at me EVERY time.   A few months ago I was nearly hit by a customer backing out so fast without looking in the lot... I mentioned it to the cashier and he batted his eyes at me giving me the  you dumb ass . Maybe your parking lot is too fucking small .. has nothin  to do with my intelligence.   Anyways... today I was in here... the tortilla distributer made light conversation with the body-builder-type guy in front of me. Then for me  the worker literally goes   um. oh.. haha.. what do you want   I should ve walked out then. The next clerk bats her eyes at me  Is it because i m white  ..rude mexicans working here.   FUCK YALLS CUSTOMER SERVICE   Seriously.... I work out also.. NO NEED to be so rude  Is it because i m female   Last visit  I called to complain and the manager offered free food. I told him   I can afford Chipotle s food  but i cannot afford the poor service at this location . Last time i ll go to this location I swear. Are y all trying to weed out my type  ... white tall thin... don t understand your  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Frudeness.at amp s cdf5d718bd2bcb49e9b6996bb928f8a835878d277606cf4aadda8efeb312eb4e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  rudeness.at  a .all.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,I have been eating chipotle for years and every time I go there I get good service and good food. I have never experienced such health  good food. The bowl is awesome the burrito is like a bowl all raped in a tortilla which is really good. Keep up the good work chipotle your food will always have a place in my heart.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,It s fast food with a healthy bent  served in an assembly line like all Chipotle restaurants.   If you need to grab something quickly and take it back to work  this place fits the bill. The dining room is tiny and very plainly decorated  unlike some of their other locations  but if you end up eating there  you can face the street and people watch through the giant picture windows that front the store.  The parking lot is about average size and fills up quickly during rush dining hours  so plan accordingly. Send your lunch order with that nice guy in the next cubicle or carpool.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,Dream Crushers.  I was told the last time I went I would have one free burrito left on my Chiptopia card. I m a fan  a big fan  so this story I m about to tell really hurts my soul and stomach. I went today and most certainly didn t receive a free burrito. They didn t honor the last free burrito I worked so hard to attain. With that being said  I m angry  sad  and currently eating my burrito with a bitter taste in my mouth. The manager gave me a free drink  after having paid for my burrito and chips  amp  salsa . If I wanted a drink I would have bought a drink.....just like the non-free  free  burrito I was promised. Most expensive free burritos in town. Also customer service needs improvement.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,Get ready for this Yelpers   So it s noon lunchtime and decide to treat a colleague to lunch at Chipotle on S. Lamar.  We both make our order and notice A bunch of napkins on the ground in front of the register.  Mind you this was there when we walked in.  When we were checking out my colleague asked if that was throw up and the cashier said yes. I also notice the On duty manager as I asked if she was  Telling another employee they need to clean up not sure if the employee was arguing but the manager told her she needed to clean it up and then clock out is what I heard.  She was also very rude to the employee and taking down to her. So as this arguing was going on we got our food and sat at the table  we began eating and noticed it was still not cleaned up. I mean come on guys as a manager I would ve made sure that got up before anyone else was served any food  And cleaned it up myself but this manager didn t want to get her hands dirty. So after this throw up set on the ground for over 15 minutes still wasn t cleaned up then the lady she ordered to clean it up came out in basically a hazmat suit and began cleaning it up in front other patrons ordering  And not getting up really fast but taking at least five minutes to clean it up as she was using a paintbrush or something to sweep it up.  I ll never eat at this chipotle again their lack of management  and the way the manager treated their employee was a disgrace.  Why anyany manager would think it was OK to leave throw up on the ground for even five minutes just boggles my mind   it should ve been picked up immediately and by the manager.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,I ordered food online and didn t get all of my order.  They would not give a refund and advised to go to the website and type a comment.  The website provided a statement to go back to the store the food was purchased from.  Another phone call to ask for refund and the manager stated they would not refund money over the phone or online even though they took the money online.   Manager stated that I had to go in person to get a refund.   Their attitude came off as they could care less that the customer was not satisfied.   The food was also not that good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,I love Chipotle  I had a delicious veggie bowl with guac on the side and kids chips. This is my regular order and today s lunch was good as usual. This location gets 4 starts because parking there is a mess during lunch time and the seats are super shallow and weird. Otherwise  the food is good. A better location for comfort and parking is Stassney  but if you are on SOLA this will work 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,Chipotle advertised all over BOGO for Teacher Appreciation week  so my boyfriend and I went last night  I teach Special Ed .  The guy making the burrito put several different ingredients on that I did not ask for  even though I was standing right there the whole time   and then when I mentioned it  used tongs to half-ass take off the mistakes.  When I got to the cashier  I showed her my badge and she told me we had to get the same entree  burrito burrito  bowl bowl  etc  in order to qualify for the BOGO.  I said fine  I will just pay for the 2nd  some  teacher appreciation    when I got home  I realized she didn t even put the burrito in the bag   WAY TO GO CHIPOTLE   Teacher Appreciation my ass 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,Standard Chipotle....my reliable go to for lunch when I m indecisive. I like their burrito bowls....its  a huge serving though and they ll even give you a tortilla on the side. It s conveniently located and has a decent sized parking lot.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,Chipotle is for people who want to feel good about the 1200 calorie bomb they just consumed.   I like that they try to always use organic ingredients and that they use more naturally raised meat than any other food chain  because I care about my environmental foot print. Chipotle is still fast food  though  and the portions are ridiculous. I don t care if you eat the whole thing in one sitting. America is known for its incredible feats of food consumption and I don t expect this to be any different. All I m saying is that if you put away an entire Chipotle burrito for lunch  maybe you need to eat just a light dinner.   This location is decent  the parking lot is reasonably sized  and they don t seem to be stingy with the food - although it would be better for most people s waist lines if they were. My burrito bowl had a reasonable amount of each selection and no single flavor overpowered any other with each bite. I usually eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner and half of my bowl keeps me full all day long. The good kind of full - not that uncomfortable kind of full you might get after eating a huge grease bomb of fast food.   Oh  and if you pronounce it Chipol-tay instead of Chipoat-lay  you deserve all the derision that will inevitably come your way.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,I ve always liked Chipotle. I know they re getting a lot of heat lately about food safety  but really  many local restaurants have the same issues. What I like about Chipotle is that everyone in the family can get exactly what they want  and it s affordable. Even in Austin  with all the great local Mexican food options available  I find myself favoring Chipotle because the food is great and everyone can customize their dish exactly how they like it.  Now if they can just work on their food safety issue...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,Dear Chipotle   I like you.  You make vegan fast food possible. Your cilantro lime rice  black beans  fajita veggies  pico  corn relish  lettuce  and guacamole - all jammed up in flour tortillas make for a tasty meal  or three .  And you do make wicked tasty guacamole. And those damn tortilla chips are so good  that I want to punch you in your burrito making faces.  All the kids that work at this new place are awesome. I want to hug them all after they make food.  I want to be friends with them in real life.  Especially that cashier guy that is always smiling.  Why are you always smiling  cashier guy  I m so curious.   I can swing by and see you  after I get off work from cooking all day  and then you cook for my offspring  because I m a bad person  and would make them eat cereal  ice cream  and a carrot for dinner.  But they don t mind  the Vegan Littles love you  too.  Thanks for helping me be lazy  Chipotle.  Love  Jenny Lorraine.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,I didn t know this type of customer service existed at Chipotle...  Michael and Marissa specifically  go out of there way every time to make sure my food as is promised and always greet me through the door. It feels more like a family owned restaurant as opposed to a chain. Food is always fresh  service is bang-on  and I will forever be a customer.  Thanks guys  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,Unlike many chain restaurants  there will be variations from a restaurant to a restaurant because many items are made fresh and cooked fresh.  I like eating here because the food is consistent and most workers seem nice.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,I ordered my food online for pickup during lunch. I expected it to be a hassle to pick it up with the long lines Chipotle has but was greeted when I came in  was able to skip the entire line and my food was ready to go 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,This location is just  ok ...  Pros  The staff is super nice and reliably efficient. I ve never seen a long line here  and the parking lot is never full.   Cons  The food  the chicken is always way spicier than other locations I ve been to. I can barely eat it. It seems weird to have that kind of discrepancy.   Even if everything else was perfect  what would it matter if I can t eat the food  As far as other locations I ve been to  the seasoning and spices usually seem fairly consistent  but that s not the case here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,Chipotle is great when you want something...  A  QUICK B  HEALTHY C  Satisfactorily dericious  I usually come by here when I need something quick for lunch.   ....or if I m trying to save some money and still have a filling lunch. hehe   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,Poor service at its finest     Don t waste your time eating here after 9 30pm.  They don t cook enough meat  or sometimes veggies after 9 30pm.  They don t care either.  I have mentioned this two times to the manager and it still operates the same.  Try other burrito places on S Lamar Blvd.  They care.  Enjoy 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,As an avid chipotle lover  I find that this location is pretty much always slow and bogged down with mediocre service  but due to the location  I keep coming back.   But today  on a random Sunday that is not a national holiday they decided to throw a christmas party and be closed at 8 30 when the hours SHOULD be open until 10. I m all for the Holiday spirit and keeping your employees happy but deciding to forego the store s actual hours and let people continue to waste their time driving to a closed establishment is a bit inconsiderate.  There s a Freebirds down the street that has better  faster service and reliable hours plus the food s damn good - would recommend going there instead.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,I will be the first to tell you how much I LOVE Chipotle. But this place should not be associated with the chain.   They have stingy portions -- I hate having to ask for more rice and beans  but come on -- I m ordering a veggie burrito bowl.   And I think it s the pico  but it always has a vinegar taste. It is not the flavor you expect from Chipotle. I would rather drive a little further and hit up the Chipotle on Slaughter Lane because at least you know you ll get the true Chipotle serving and flavors.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,This is by far my favorite Chipotle restaurant. The food is obviously amazing  but I m even more impressed with the kind and welcoming staff. I always leave I m a great mood. Caleb and the team are some of the best staff I ve ever come across in any restaurant. Looking forward to eating here a lot more 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,Amazing service  Super nice staff  Love the food  I forgot my wallet at home and the manager was so nice he gave me my food for free. I m definitely coming back 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,This location has gotten stingier and stingier with portions. Bowls are light on rice. Even salsa is a half scoop and you have to hound them for more.   The value of the Lamar Chipotle is declining.  Now with more stinginess. Half a scoop of guacamole  for 1.80  is the norm. Go to Freebirds. Jesus.  Updated 12 19 to one star...When you have a scoop  use a scoop. Don t sit there and use half a scoop and look up to see if I m paying attention. That s not just demeaning  it s cheap. This is absurd.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,My first visit was great...I loved how quick and fresh the food was and the staff was very inviting.  After learning it was my first visit my meal was free...how nice was that.  They didn t make me feel dumb asking questions.  Very clean location and parking is good.  I will definitely be back 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,I m a big fan of Chipotle. I m a also a big fan of replicating my favorite dishes but when it s too messy or not as great as the original  I just stick to the original. The Burrito Bowl is one of those.  Enough about the food. You know what you like. Chipotle is my Friday night treat after a week of work and a great start to the fiesta weekend for me.  I love this location because there are always multiple people behind the counter ready to help or replenish food. I ve never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time  especially when it s busy. I am always greeted as soon a I walk in the door  more than once most of the time . And I m somewhat particular in I always take my order to go but with the bowl  I like to keep the top off so I can add my one true love  the green jalapeno Tabasco  to my dish before I leave.   I could go on and on at how difficult it is to put the top back on after removing it once so I ve found it s easier to ask them to leave it off and put it on myself after pouring an entire bottle of Tabasco on my dish. I truly appreciate their willingness and non judgmental reactions to this request.  They are fast and friendly and I like it. The parking lot looks like it would be a pain in the ass but surprisingly I ve never had a problem.  Waiting to get back on Lamar in the non stop traffic at all hours of the day  is a very different story  however. But that s Austin s problem  not Chipotle s.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,You know how there s always one chain restaurant location out of the many in town that you swear is better than the others  Yeah  this is that one for me.  They never run out of chicken or rice  other locations do and I have to rage a bit .  The guy that serves during lunch can make 400  plus or minus some  burritos a minute so you are in and out super fast.  Parking is a breeze and there s always a space.  Did I mention this location is brand new and immaculately clean   What else can you possibly want from Chipotle  Well  I suppose I d take a little more meat  I think Qdoba does slightly more   but that s about it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,Great place to eat out keto  Obviously  it s a chain so don t get your expectations too high. This isn t Torchy s but it s close to work if I m in a pinch.  Carnitas burrito bowl with sour cream  cheese  lettuce  guacamole. Sometimes I cheat with a little bit of pico which is exciting because a little bit isn t technically cheating. I like that it is naturally raised and well-spiced food. Quick and simple.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,I m a big chipotle fan so it hurts to give it two stars.  This location is so STINGY.  I came back three times hoping it was just a specific employee problem but it must be management training directive.  They give you half a bowl... and then roll their eyes when you ask politely for more.  Dude gave me attitude about another scoop of rice.     What is this  a burrito bowl for ants   It has to be at least...3 times this size   - Zoolander
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,Things have definitely improved here  I think they ve hired some new staff. It is still hit or miss with quantities of food based on who assembles your burrito  I still occasionally have to ask for an extra scoop of rice or beans  but it has gotten better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,The favorite thing I love about Chipotle is their famous guacamole  I also love the way they treat their customers. When we went here they gave us free drinks  Their service is always great 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,Due to a minor lapse with food being ready at the time of checkout  I was given a free soda with my meal and I only waited a couple minutes  Way to show great customer service...this was my first time at any Chipotle and I will definitely be returning. The food was delicious  but it s the service that is bringing me back  thanks 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,I will never understand the appeal of Chipotle outside of the fact that it can prevent you from eating something worse like Taco Bell.  It depresses me to think that people in Austin think this is a good burrito in a city with a ton of good burrito locations  ie. Super Burrito  Cabo Bob s  Taquaria Arandas Arandinas .  I even feel like Freebird s and Chuy s both make a better burrito but they are not in the class of the burrito establishments mentioned above.  I will use this review for my visit to the Stassney and S. Lamar locations as they essentially had the same issues.   1 star for consistency across multiple locations I guess.  Now to the burritos.  The meat  steak  and beans  pinto  were dry  without much flavor.  The cilantro lime rice had the flavor that it had been swimming in lime juice which completely over powered the rest of the fillings.  The pico de gallo and lettuce were fresh and the only highlights of the burrito but it could have used more jalapenos but that is personal preference.  Guacamole was OK but considering they sell it as a side as well it was a bit bland.    Girlfriend generally orders the bowl and they sell barbacoa which is more of a beef roast and is nowhere near an accurate representation of actual barbacoa which is from the beef cheek and is a fattier meat than what Chipotle is advertising but the bowl was actually decent because it held the fresher ingredients from the burrito.  All in all I guess this is what I should expect from a burrito chain that is owned by the McDonald s corporate umbrella but I should not have to lower my standards when you are charging full price for the product.  Chipotle will live on and this location will boom but I will do my best to avoid it in the future.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,Staff is always so nice  We always think they should add a tip line on credit receipts   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,This is my favorite location to go to. I ve been to the one on Stassney and Brodie but this is by far the best location. Their food is so flavorful. From the chicken to the corn and even the bell peppers. Everything just has flavor. The other locations either taste burnt or have no flavor. I love coming here. Though they are pretty stingy and skimp on the portions. I once saw a worker barely put any rice on the man s burrito and he had to ask for more and the guy scooped yet again only a little. I ve had to ask for more scoops of rice also. It s like jeez quit being so stingy and just give the customers more. We are giving you our money so the least you could is give us good hearty portions.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,This place is consistent  which is really good. Fernando just provided the best service I ve ever had at Chipotle before  my order was messed up . If I were them  I d have him oversee service at all the locations around. He s a stellar example of providing good service and making things right for the consumer.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,The food was delicious  the prices reasonable and the staff outstanding   Atmosphere not so hot. So this is a good place for take away  but eating in  not so hot 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,This is definitely not the same as the other locations. When I tried to order the kids quesadillas they tried to take a 6  tortilla  slap on some cheese and just fold it in half  Yep  that is stingy. My taco was so tasteless  I threw it away after one bite. On top of that  the two workers were rolling there eyes and making other rude gestures right in front of me  Too many better nearby options to return. Bad service  amp  bad food 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,This chipotle has always been a little lower in quality than the other location  but it s still amazing. I always get a chicken burrito. The employees are very nice but most times I come to this location my burrito either unravels or rips. Still will come back though.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,So disappointed. Ordered a burrito with guac. The girl didnt even give me half a scoop of guac. Ridiculous  Almost  2 - it should be a full scoop. I asked her if she would mind to put 1 2 a scoop more on my burrito - she got a heaping spoonful and globbed it on  Seriously   I was starving so I just paid for it and left. I couldn t eat it.   A complete waste of my time and money. Plus I feel sick from what I did eat. I am NEVER coming to this location again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,Recently moved this area and have become a regular customer here. Service is fantastic. Very fast and courteous. Always clean. And the food is delicious   amp  pretty large servings .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,I completely agree that this location is consistently stingy with their portions. I mean  it s a burrito bowl  gimme some rice and beans  You would think they are giving you their own rice and beans out of their own pockets  and they haven t eaten in two days  they are so stingy with it. I am not a glutton  not at all  I just feel like I should get at least one half way full spoonful of ingredients    Also  for some reason every time I come here  the entire staff looks acts overwhelmed and flustered and even a little frustrated at the customers. By the time I pay I m literally out of breathe and sweating from anxiety of ordering and watching them freak out the whole time. And the guac tastes different every single time  I am a big chipotle fan and my hubs loves it so we come here a lot. This location is super close to home and it s not bad enough to drive further  I just wish the portion size was better  I am probably the only person alive to ever say that about chipotle   and the guac would be consistent. More stars if they improve 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,Lewis was fantastic. Built our burritos to perfection. Super helpful and excellent customer service  will definitely come here more often  No other location has had such great service. Highly recommend 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,This is my go-to chipotle in South Austin. The food quality is always consistent. The service is always speedy and the employees are very friendly. The parking lot can be a bit of a cluster during busy times  but other that everything is just fine.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,This is the worst chipotle I ve ever been to. It wasn t the service it was the really bad food. The meat was so chewy I could not even eat it. The lettuce was soggy and wilted  just all around bad. If you were to tell me I was eating cat I would believe it. Don t go here
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,Love Chipotle but the location in Sunset Valley was a pigs sty.  The floors  tables and drink station were a mess. The food was good   Need to keep it clean.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,Great location with ample parking and a great fenced dog-friendly patio just off South LaMar and just north of Bluebonnet Lane. Extremely clean  attentive and helpful staff - the only suggestion  slow down your speech and please enunciate  - some of us don t have your menu memorized and or don t eat at Chipotle every other day   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,The employees here are always so friendly and fast  and it s Chipotle so it s really tasty. But this location is SO STINGY. I always end up having to ask for more because they never fill up my bowl. They use half the portions of any other franchise I ve been to. Management must be super cheap   I go to chipotle because I can get two meals out of a burrito bowl but you ll regret not asking for extra at this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,Sure  Chipotle is a chain and we aren t so fond of chains in Austin  since we do have SO many amazing locally owned restaurants . But there are times when you need something quick and easy  and this location is a great option for me when I need a fast lunch. I am glad this location is the one closest to me since I happen to think it is the best one I have been to in Austin  The service is excellent - the staff is polite and friendly. They are quick without skimping on quality or messing up your order. I find their ingredients to be very fresh as well.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,I don t normally write reviews on chain restaurants  but I felt like I needed to mention my experience at Chipotle recently. I went there for dinner and at the end of the meal I had to wait one minute  just a minute  for them to open the register. For my wait  the manager gave the meal for free. I m not saying they ll give you a free meal every time  but I thought he was going above and beyond on kindness. The food was fresher than anything I ve ever gotten from other chain restaurants and was really quite good. The next time I came in there they opened the store 10 minutes early when they saw me come up and they were incredibly polite and helpful. From this point on if I need a quick meal on the go this is the place I m going to. Thank you for the experience.
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,1,All my favorite taco spots that I have found in the 5 years I ve been living in Austin have all blown up.   Mark my words  this one is next.  Cash only 
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,2,Awesome taco truck open till midnight daily. We tried a variety of tacos  and cabeza was my group s unanimous favorite  with pastor following behind as a close second. Everything was delicious though  and we d happily come back again.  Note that it s cash only 
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,3,It was our first time trying out this place. We drove 25 minutes to get there and it was well worth it. Staff is very kind and they do speak English and Spanish. They do not accept credit cards  but will accept Cash  Venmo or cash app. We were glad cash app was an option since we didn t have enough cash.  We ordered tacos bistek  campechanos  and tripa. They were all delicious. It was worth the drive. Yes  I recommend and yes  I will be coming back    
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,4,bad ass tacos the best on riverside no fucken doubt 100  guaranteed EL ZACATECAS IS MY NICK NAME RAUL..............
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,5,Great  authentic tacos served from a food trailer.  Anjojitos offers a variety of tacos from al pastor to tripe.  All prepared fresh and all delicious.  When we arrived  there was no line  but as we ate at one of the picnic tables  the line grew.  The prices are very low  so enjoy a number of tacos without breaking your budget.
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,6,Absolutely BOMB tacos  Hidden Riverside gem that more people need to try.  If you don t speak Spanish it could be a little tricky to order  but it s never been a big issue. When in doubt  just get the al pastor tacos.
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,7,Most amazing pastor tacos I ve ever had  Definitely will be going back and forth here
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,8,Sooo Good  I m an outta towner and this was definitely the spot to go to. But shhh it s still a secret. Al Pastor tacos for the win 
Antojitos Mexicanos Los Jarochos,9,Amazing food    Quick service and food was still hot when I got home. Definitely must try.... going back tonight
Tacos 620,1,Wonderful taco truck in close to Steiner Four Points. The tortillas are delicious and the Migas tacos are some of the best I ve had. Don t miss this gem on the side of the road. Try tacos 620 you won t regret it.
Tacos 620,2,Woke up craving breakfast tacos  so I searched Yelp to see what was closest. Winner winner  Tacos 620 was just around the corner from my hotel. They have a drive through  but I got out and walked up so I could see the menu. We got the everything taco  a chorizo y papa  and the daily special which was shredded beef that day. All absolutely BUSSIN   Didn t even get pictures  just went in on them. Salsa was good too 
Tacos 620,3,If you are looking for breakfast tacos in west Austin  Four Points area  this is the place  I stopped here one day about a year ago and now I m hooked. It is our family breakfast every Sunday morning. I even make a few stops during the week to grab them. Just a heads up that they only take cash or Venmo.   My son likes the bacon egg and cheese. We wife picks the bacon egg cheese and potato. I pick this best taco on the menu  the super taco  it is everything from the menu and is amazing. Their red and green salsas are both great as well. Their tacos are large  too  so you won t go hungry.
Tacos 620,4,Delicious tacos  made to order. Our whole family loves them. Always hot and fresh. Wish they stayed open a little later.
Tacos 620,5,I m almost afraid to write a review   but hey   if ur nearby  amp  you  tacos go for the  migas  tacos. That was the special of the day  amp  let me tell you  I m HOOKED. Fresh eggs  tender onions  pieces of gently fried corn tortilla mixed in a white creamy cheese topped with fresh  avocado.... Need i say more   Dear God my mouth is watering just thinking about em 
Tacos 620,6,This place only has 1 review        Not sure how long this little trailer has been there but it s delicious     They re used to be a different trailer in its spot.  This one is just as good.  I have no idea if they are related.  I ve gone twice in one week now.  They get your tacos out pretty quickly.  It s cash or venmo. The people are friendly.  The tortillas appear homemade.  The green salsa is on point... not too spicy but gives it a kick. The tacos are about  2.50 each.
Tacos 620,7,Best breakfast tacos in Austin. The little bit of everything taco  I call it a trash is the best breakfast taco I have ever had.
Tacos 620,8,Tacos and salsa are on point. My mouth is salivating thinking about it. Best tacos in the Four Points area. Great prices too 
Ember Smoke,1,This is a no-joke  can t-lose  sure bet. These guys clearly have a passion for what they re doing  and what they re doing is crafting unique and delicious tacos around BBQ meats.  I doubt they d ever be pretentious enough to use the word  crafting   but that s damn well what they re doing.   Everything from the tortillas to the sides has a special touch.  Can highly recommend the jalapeno creamed corn.    There s a reason I m here almost every weekend. Do yourself a favor.
Ember Smoke,2,I ordered from this place on DoorDash. The tacos weren t available to order. The deviled eggs need some work. The flavor is a bit salty and the consistency was a bit soupy. The baked beans tasted like beans heated up straight out of the can. Maybe add some seasoning  molasses and brown sugar.   The Mac and cheese needs to be removed from the menu. It s false advertising. It s just noodles with butter and flavorless cheese bits. The ribs were good. I was interested in the brisket hush puppies  but I received regular hush puppies in my order.  I might try visiting the actual food truck instead of DoorDash so I can try out the tacos.
Ember Smoke,3,Ember Smoke Co has some amazing tacos. I ordered three different tacos and I can t even say I have a favorite because they were all so good. The Bark was their staple brisket taco and it was made with delicious brisket  guacamole and sauces. The pickled onions were a nice touch. The finer things taco had rib meat with Brie and cherries. The flavor profile was so unique and out of the box but it worked so well on their fresh handmade corn tortillas. The al pastor was spot on and they pulled the pork rather than having pieces. I really enjoyed the way it was prepared.  The jalape o creamed corn was also delicious.
Ember Smoke,4,Let s just say  I wish I lived across the street from Ember Smoke cause I would be here everyday. The bark tacos were amazing  The food is a work of art  a talent  a passion that definitely shows. The brisket was soo fatty  in a good way. One bite and it just melts in your mouth. As another review put it  not need to chew. Just enjoy those flavors as it melts. The corn or the flour tortillas are fresh and you couldn t go wrong with either. However  It doesn t just stop there  the creamed corn was phenomenal  The consistency was on point and the thought to add jalape os was mind blowing  I can t wait to go back. Thanks for the hospitality and great vibes guys.
Ember Smoke,5,Best barbecue I ve ever had. Staff is incredibly friendly. The fatty brisket is unbelievable. Melts in your mouth  no need to even chew. So glad I found this place.
Ember Smoke,6,Awesome new food truck serving up bbq by the pound and some awesome tacos with fresh tortillas. Great spot to check out 
Ember Smoke,7,Dare I say these are the best tacos I ve had in Austin   So delicious and the guys who own the truck are so wonderful and definitely know their shit. Go eat here - you will not be disappointed  
Ember Smoke,8,Came across this food truck on my way home the other day and I m so happy that I did  I had the Bark  Resonance  and Chubby Cheeks tacos and all three of them were delicious. The brisket is perfectly smoked and full of so much flavor. The jalape o corn is so tasty and has a great kick to it. Not to mention the guys that run the truck are super friendly. I m looking forward to going back and trying out the rest of the items on the menu 
Fruteria Pekitas,1,One of the best pupusas I have ever had   Very flavorful food    Today I ordered 5 mini pastor tacos  1 chicharron and cheese pupusa  1 revuetlas pupusa   chicharron  cheese   beans   a cup of watermelon fruit  and a lemonade.   I love the pupusas  they have so much flavor  a perfect crispy outer texture  and are bigger then usual. The tacos had a really good flavor  also came with a good green avacado salsa. The only thing that I didn t like was the texture of the hard tortillas and grainy like texture from the meat. However  they are still a good taco. The watermelon was okay  could ve been sweeter. The lemonade was water down.
Fruteria Pekitas,2,BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN AUSTIN. HANDS DOWN. Technically  they mostly have snacks but there are a few meals you can get. I love this restaurant  because Austin is saturated with Tex Mex restaurants that people consider to be Mexican food. Real foodies know the difference.   I tried to take a picture of the food me and my family had  but we ate it before I got the chance to get a picture. We got the al pastor tacos  which came with six tacos. Very yummy and filling. The mangonada was the best I ve had in awhile. Elotes en vaso is so good. They put a lot of corn and the filling on top so you have to mix it well. The fresa con creama is delicious  but they put so many strawberries and so little cream.   This is my new favorite restaurant.
Fruteria Pekitas,3,Excelente lugar save ven todo lo que tienen  esta de buen  precio y buen servicio gracias
Fruteria Pekitas,4,This place was great  I had a mangonada and cucumber lime water and it was so refreshing.
Fruteria Pekitas,5,Awesome place  corn in the cup was amazing  Definitely recommend  and happy positive environment.
Fruteria Pekitas,6,Seems they re under new management  I was greeted right away with smile and the smell of cooked beef fajita meat   They had a special of 5 mini tacos for only  6.99   Filled with fresh avacodo  cheese  and grilled onions.   Got my attention there     A lady by the fruit bar asked if i wanted to try anything  to let her know so she can give me a free small sample.  This place is small  but they have a variety of a lot of tasety things. I will definitely have to come back again and try their home made soups fresh ceviche tostadas  shrimp cocktail.   I give them  stars because they were friendly  fast  and clean   
Fruteria Pekitas,7,Experienced much better mexican food in austin and this is one place I won t be coming back to if I m craving tacos. I placed a to go order consisting of a chicken fajita taco and a bean and cheese pupusa. I was excited to try out pupusa as I have not been able to find too many places in austin that serve them.  I order the taco with everything on it...so onions and cilantro but when I got it had a whole bunch of lettuce and tomatoes but no onions or cilantro. The problem was that the chicken tasted funky and not fresh...Also it didn t have much of a sear on it. The pupusa was good  not too much bean and cheese filling   and came with a slaw of cabbage and carrots. I was happy with both the items until I found a piece of hair in the slaw but they pack the slaw separate so I ate the pupusa but tossed the slaw. They had a green and red salsa and my favorite was the red..it had a smoky savory flavor that was great. Also  for some reason I was charged 0.25 extra  didn t affect the rating but I wasn t sure it that was a bag fee or a take out fee  so just a heads up.  If I m back I ll try the fruit and drinks.  1 star for the chicken taco 3 stars for the pupusa and salsa
Fruteria Pekitas,8,I stopped by on a whim and asked for a sandillada which like a snow cone with watermelon pieces  chamoy  and chile. It was yummy  A little more ice than I prefer and not as much watermelon as I d like  but good enough to order again and try others.   The service was quick and friendly. The clerk was helpful  bilingual  and very welcoming. The place was small but clean and bright.   Definitely worth a try 
Fruteria Pekitas,9,The fruit here is good and fresh with many great combinations.  It s allot like Pepe s.  I ve also gotten the pastor burrito which is good  tasty  and huge and for  6 it s a great deal.  The other food items are mostly too pricey though.  A taco plate out of a place like this should not be  9 and  2.25 per taco a la cart when everyone else around them are  2 or less is not good.  I ll be back for the burrito and probably try a torta later though.  The menu pictures on here are not up to date.
Fruteria Pekitas,10,I loved this place  I love their selection of food and their raspados  shaved ice . We ordered the watermelon  pi a  amp  chamuco  which is what they called their spicy cucumber one . They Rach had chamoy  chili powder and fruit based on the flavor you ordered. For example  the pineapple had pineapple chunks.  I ordered street nachos which allows you to pick either chicken or beef. I got beef and imagined it to only have chips  nacho cheese  amp  beef. I was pleasantly surprised to receive my nachos with nacho cheese  beef  pico de gallo  lettuce  avocados  cotija cheese and sour cream   We loved it - minus I felt the beef had too much pepper. I also wish they were more descriptive on their menu because my husband does not like sour cream. My daughter and I on the other hand devoured them  Check them out  you won t regret it. Also  - like their page and receive a FREE 12oz. Raspados  snow cone . Thank me later    
Fruteria Pekitas,11,Okay yes it was not the best  in regards to their elote  but customer service was great. They were kind and honest. Didn t lie to us when we asked what kind of corn they use for their elote. Straight up told us it was yellow corn from a can and you know what  I appreciate honesty. Such a rare characteristic in humans these days. The sandia agua fresca was good  very sweet  but hit the spot on these craZy hot summer days. I would hit up ricos elote fanny on Rumberg though if you want elote. Good luck everyone on their elote prowl 
Fruteria Pekitas,12,Fresh  friendly  fast. Great healthy snack alternative  grilled items are great as well.
Fruteria Pekitas,13,I decided to try this place yesterday with my boyfriend. I had to take the order because the women behind the counter only acknowledged me and ignore him. He doesn t speak Spanish  so this happens at a lot of places were they ignore him and the workers look at me to call out the order. Anyways as we waited for our fruit cup and mangonada I saw a cockroach on the counter and it scurried underneath the styrofoam cups. I saw a second cockroach on the wall. She called me and said my order was ready. I get up and tell her I no longer want the food. She is confused and I did not want to call her out in front of the customers eating their food. No place like this should be open. This place is roach infested. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,Frequently flow through the menu to switch things up. Highly recommend using the Chipotle App to get points and work towards a free entree  This location is VERY BUSY. It isn t unusual to see employees come and go as they are frequently understaffed.   Once again  recommend using the app to place an order in advanced because there is a 50 50 chance you still will be waiting for the order even if you placed it 10 to 15 minutes before arriving  depending on the time of day . Despite the long lines  running out of food items  and dealing with unpleasant customers  the staff still is very nice 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,Overall the food here is fine but it has to be the slowest chipotle I ve ever been to. And Ive been many times... Just sooooo slow...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,Come here for the large portion size but not for the speed    This specific location had one of the slowest lines I have ever waited in at a chipotle  about 20-25 minutes wait just to even order . The staff is very nice but extremely slow. The employees took a very long time to complete orders. They carefully wrapped the burrito as if it was a baby and took double the amount of time to do so. For fast food  they worked in slow mo like the sloth from the movie  Zootopia.   However  they gave me the most food I have ever received at a chipotle  Typically  a kids meal is only partially filled. Here  they gave me basically a whole meal  It was so delicious and had the best quesadilla I ve had from chipotle    If you are looking for a fast chipotle  I would suggest trying a different location. The one on Guadalupe street is much faster  However  if you are looking for a chipotle that gives you the most food that is still yummy  I definitely suggest trying this location 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,The nastiest and most poorly run Chipotle ever.   Is was nastier in person. The glass is gross  the food wells always look nasty. Come on man. What gives. I like chipotle. This one is so gross it makes me leave.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,I ordered  amp  paid for guacamole. I got a shit ton of cheese  amp  sour cream. I didn t want sour cream. I ve not had it in years because it kills my stomach after I eat it. This is the last thing I wanted from chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,Horrible   Absolutely dirty and disgusting. Staff is rude and texting with gloves on while being annoyed to make your order. Don t waste your time or money.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,I walked into this chipotle and saw how disgusting and dirty the counter was  There was smeared guacamole and ingredients all on the counter. I almost threw up. It wasn t even busy. They have to teach their employees how to clean up behind themselves when it slows down. No one would want to eat here   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,Tried this location again bc another location recently screwed up my order so i had a free entree coupon to use and it s so close and convenient. i walk in and patiently wait by the start of the line while the woman checks out another customer. then she yells at me  just so you know maam i m not making orders today. i m only doing mobile  and i asked  so i can t just order a bowl really quick here    no in the only one and i have all these orders to do   look i work in customer service and with the general public too and am very familiar with being understaffed and stressed to take on more work than i should be. but maybe next time put a sign on the door  or close the location. i don t know if it s even a possibility but maybe turn off mobile orders  I think the worst part that upset me is just how rude and dismissive she was  especially when there were like 1 other customer in the store who was paying  which you don t do if you get a mobile ....suspicious  and it feels very simple to just pause mobiles for people that aren t even there to make one quick bowl for someone who is.  overall  chipotle as an entire company has just gone SO downhill in the past few years and BY FAR this Riverside location is the worst of them all.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,Filthy. Besides being slow and having rude staff and management  this place was so filthy it made me nauseous. To the point I will never eat at a Chipotle Grill again. I understand they are understaffed as most fast food restaurants are nowadays  but it was clear that was due to poor management. The employees aprons had a week s worth of old food smeared on the front  the bathrooms had no toilet tissue or paper towels or soap  yes in Covid times   and trash was strung all over the floor  they were so slow they had 6-8 delivery drivers waiting for  and canceling  orders one by one. I can t even imagine how filthy the kitchen is where the food is coming from.  Don t order from here and don t eat here. It really needs to be shut down. Gross.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,Let me help you out  go to the chipotle on Oltorf and I-35.   This chipotle is always out of common ingredients  has the laziest employees  and non existent management. They mess up your order and then cop and attitude with you when you ask for them to correct it.   I had my order delivered using the app and when it arrived the order was absolutely wrong. Not only was it missing half the ingredients I ordered  they added toppings that were not on the order and ingredients that were listed as  out of stock  on the app.  I had to drive back up to the store for it to be remade  waited another 30 minutes while only one person was working the line on a Friday night and some random dude working the register out of uniform.  This chipotle is poorly run  has team members with zero initiative  and lacks structured management.  Seriously... Oltorf is less than a mile away  you ve been warned.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,This Chipotle rips people off. Avoid it. They give really small portions of everything and when you ask them to add more they wanna charge it as extra. Why would you charge it as extra when I can literally see the small amount of servings your putting in my bowl. Got such a horrible bowl with very little food and paid  15 cuz of all the extra charges they added. I had no time to speak to their supervisor and file a complaint but I will never be back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,The dirtiest most unorganized and slow chipotle you ve ever been to. Always out of some ingredients because they re so slow to prep the food too
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,Husband went to chipotle this afternoon for a steak 3 pointer unfortunately they had given us  chicken  so I went around 8 30 to see if they ll remake it. I got an instant attitude from the manager. Anywho they decided to re make it so I kindly asked if they could add as spoon of beans the young girl who was making it looked behind  amp  said I can t.... My boss said I could only add  3 items  I was annoyed at that point. Charge me for the damn beans   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,Food is as expected from Chipotle - fresh  consistent  highly customizable  and delicious. This review is in regards to the management - this particular location is incredibly poorly run.  On my last four online orders  none have been ready on time  and all have been at least 10 minutes  late. I m writing this review as I m waiting for my current order  and it s already 20 minutes late.  Time is of the essence when grabbing lunch during business hours and this location predictably misses the mark.  I plan on bringing my business to the Oltorf location moving forward.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,Service sucks. Whenever I order online  I show up and wait 10 minutes past my pick up time for them to make it. When I show up in person  I stand and wait forever while they make the online order.   It s a lose-lose either way.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,Service is terrible. One person helps the line the whole time while 3 people watch and clown around or decide to go on break. Manager is just joking around half the time. If you can go anywhere to any other chipotle please do
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,I m always in for a surprise when I order from this location. Whether it s brown guacamole  hard rice  on multiple occasions   over and under cooked chicken  10-15 minute wait periods or just not having any ingredients. Today is officially my last day going to this location  it should be impossible to ALWAYS mess up the way they do. I can t remember the last time I ve had a decent experience. I placed an Ubereats order today and my bowl was missing two ingredients. Not only was I missing two ingredients  the rice was hard and the chicken was extremely overcooked. EVER TIME I walk in this establishment  even if there s no one there LITERALLY  I have to wait. Terrible  terrible  terrible. These experiences are definitely not worth  11.09 and I will be finding a new location    
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,Horrible customer service  online ordering NEVER works. Ordered online to pick up at 9 pm  showed up at 9 and was told to then wait in line to place the order I already placed. WTF is that  Now I don t get to eat dinner because I don t have time to wait in a 20 minute line.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,Wry slow and under staffed  I usually order online to get my order faster but even 40 mins after my scheduled time my order is not ready   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,My boyfriend and I love chipotle and have been loyal customers of other locations in Austin  at least get it twice a week . Since moving to riverside  we are constantly disappointed by this location. They are always messing up on our orders  forgetting entrees when we deliver  consistency in their products. It s honestly really disappointing because we love Chipotle for their convenience and consistency. And because this location is such a let down  we would rather order something else. If you live in Austin  I would try to go to a different location if possible.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,I don t what s going on with this location.  They used to be really good with service. Lately they have not had the food set up to serve by the time  they open. People are having to wait. I usually  put my order in so that way it would be ready for me to pick up since I only have a 30 min lunch.  My pick order was suppose to be ready at 11am and didn t get put together by 11 30am. Like seriously what s going on.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,Yoo nice service but what s with the longest slowest line in the world. The cooks and servers and cashiers are sooooo slow. Damn this thing is busy. I walked over here and stood in line for literally 40 minutes. And there we re only 11 people in front of me. There isnt even a drive through here. Speed it up guys got damn.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,Ordered online and when I came back into work as I was dipping my chip into the blanco cheese I noticed this long hair along with it. Killed my appetite 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,I asked for a salad  this is the fourth time I get a bowl salad with little to no lettuce  why are they skimping idg cos this definitely isn t worth  13
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,Put your in-house customers above online orders so we don t have to stand here for 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged. A sense of urgency like at every other Chipotle would be appreciated too
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,This has to be the worst chipotle in all of Austin. They are incredibly slow and the employees are rude when your trying to order. The line could be out the door and you can see the employees in the back messing around. I d go to any other chipotle in the area.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,This location never gets my order correct  and the last few times I ve ordered the rice wasn t cooked probably. Their definitions of extra need some help.  Extra  rice and it comes half empty. I ordered extra WHITE rice for delivery and I got three bowls of brown rice on the side. Went to the store to have it remade and they re out of white rice but they never contacted me  i would have rather cancelled my order. We regularly wait over 10 extra minutes for our online orders and the portions are pitiful. Maybe if they paid their workers what they re worth and make the working conditions better we wouldn t have such poor quality and experiences.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,I love chipotle  but there is something not quite right about this location. I have been here many times  and I have ordered both in person and ahead of time. Nearly every single time I have had to wait roughly thirty minutes to get my food. I have held off writing this review for a while  hoping that this was a temporary problem  however it does not seem to be getting better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,I ve gone here many times and they are always slow. I ordered via online and then waited nearly 40 minutes for my order. Instead of taking care of orders 30 mins prior  they ll take care of orders that just came in. It s often a mess. I don t know why I come  likely won t again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,This place is ridiculous. My mobile order was over 40 min late  and yes they kept telling me it was coming and to wait a bit longer  then finally I just got in line and re ordered. When I talked to the worker to address the situation he was very rude and simply stated  we are short staffed  while he did nothing to help. No one was in a hurry or helping at all. They were standing around while one guy worked. And they were audibly complaining.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,I d be happy to change this to a 5 star rating once there is actual enforcement of their mask and social distance policy. This is just a gross way to treat the employees.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,This is my second visit in the past week and the online service is terrible. I placed an order online for 6 30pm and didn t get it 15 minutes after. I went up to the clerk about my order and said that the receipt machine broke and my order ticket didn t get printed. I was appalled when she said this to me and had to wait with 4 others who were waiting for their online order and waited longer than I did. Please create some organizational system or hire more staff to support people who orders online and come in person.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,By far the longest I ve ever waited in line for chipotle  it almost took 30 minutes just to order
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,Stood there for 5 minutes before anyone even assisted me. There was only one person in front of me and all of the workers were standing around talking. Finally when i got my bowl started  they didn t even have someone in the second end of the line to add the veggies to it so I stood there for another few minutes looking around waiting. Then the same exact situation once I got to the register.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,I love chipotle but this location sucks. If you want chipotle  go to another one. They are very slow and mess up orders alot
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,Chipotle in riverside is one of the worst chipotles in the country. I have never NOT had a problem going to this location. I worked for this company for 4 years. It is a horrible group. Tomatoes were completely bare of ingredients. No fajitas veggies. No corn. Their website down  no boorito discount even though I was in full costume. Every time I go here. Garbage. Food is burnt. Missing items. Longest and slowest lines. Chips undercooked. Staff looks miserable.  Except the old man who works there  he s the only shining star . This is why more of us are going to Cabo Bobs. You get better food  a better deal and you don t have to deal with constant quality issues. Lost a customer today.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,One thing that I ve noticed when I go to chipotle is that the service is usually very fast even if there s a line that the people are always pretty polite never rude I ve never had a very rude person help me that works there and that the food it s basically the same almost every way I haven t been to a place where it s two different sometimes it seems like the steak isn t cook the same everywhere and it s chewy and some locations in some locations it taste good but one thing that I have noticed that basically stays the same with every single chipotle that I go to is it the food is never hot it s never hot sometimes it s warm but it is never hot I have no clue what they re doing But they are not keeping the food hard when I go to Freebirds the food is hot I get the burrito and it s warm to the touch it s hot if I keep my hands on it too long I need to switch it to the other hand when I go to chipotle the food is never hot if you want it hot you have to put it in the microwave which means I have to ask them to put everything on the side the sour cream the tomatoes anything that I want cold it Hass to go on the side in those little containers and it s annoying and I don t know why they can t do something simple like keep their food hot
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,If this had an option for 0 stars I would put it  worst service from a chipotle and they are always out of ingredients. Workers don t care at all and don t do anything
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,DO NOT ORDER ONLINE AT THIS LOCATION  You will not receive anything close to what you would receive in store.  I ve had multiple orders wrong from South Shore store. I ve even called and spoke to this location the past couple of times I ve ordered. Today s order was subpar at best. It didn t have what I ordered. We received two salads WITHOUT dressing. There was little meat  no extra fajita veggies which we asked for  in place for no rice or beans . This salad would not be a meal for grown adult. Yet when we dine-in  it s exactly what we want.  I called back and asked for district managers information. The manager Marissa didn t give correct information.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,I ve been to Chipotle restaurants on the east coast  west coast  and now right in the middle of the country in Austin  Texas. What I was just served at this Chipotle  was the poorest excuse of a burrito I have ever seen. The tortilla had to have been sitting out for at least an hour  there may have been 3-4 pieces of steak on it  all of the guacamole slipped down to the end of the burrito. To continue on  the restaurant was out of chips. Avoid this chipotle at all costs.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,Waited 15-20 minutes in line and they even made my food  then at the last second as I m pulling out a 20 they tell me  we only take exact change    there was multiple people in-front of me and the Had multiple chances to say that
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,Worst chipotle I ve ever been to. Worth the drive to go to the one on oltorf or e 6th. Consistently are out of food and just shrug. Employees have on numerous occasions told me  I can t give you extra cheese  they re watching us on camera. Note to the franchise owner  invest in your business. Get the right person managing it. There are chipotles everywhere  why would I continue to put up with bad service when I can drive another 5 minutes to the same restaurant
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,All reviews are relative... And this one is obviously for this particular location in relation to other locations rather anointing this place worthy of a Michelin star. There is GREAT service at this chipotle...the other reviews do not lie. While the food is more or less the same thing as every other location  this place is filled with awesome staff who were super friendly and smiley.   I stopped by here today to  1  redeem my free burrito coupon and  2  treat my family to their first chipotle experience ever. Not only were the staff super friendly  but were patient while I tried to make 4 entrees at the same time since everyone in my family wanted me to order for them.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,I went in at 8 30 pm  the location closes at 10pm. By the time I walked in  the grills were off and cleaned  the floors were mopped and they were turning off the coolers for the line..... an hour and a half before close.. better yet  half the ingredients were out. Ya ll need to be waitin til close to start closing tasks... or at least prep enought to get you through the rest of the night. I feel bad for whoever came in after me because I almost wiped then out completely.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,so i ordered a salad online and went to pick it up yesterday and just by chance  i checked my bag before leaving the parking lot only to find out that they had written that there wasn t any lettuce in my salad because of a boil notice here in ATX. I totally understand the boil notice but the fact that they were going to let me leave the store with just a scoop of meat and guacamole when i paid for a full salad is ridiculous. I would ve appreciated a call or an email telling me the situation so that I could change my order. I went in to the store to ask if they could rice to it  so I wasn t just eating scoop of meat with guac and they made a big deal about how they would make an exception this time and give me rice. the woman comes out and hands me the smallest container of rice in one of those little cups where sauce or salsas or supposed to go and tells me that s the best she can do. extremely disappointed by chipotle and their customer service.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,Asked for more chicken in my bowl and after getting a way less than I m used to and the female worker gave me attitude said it was a generous portion. This is not what I expect won t be returning
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,This is not a review of the employees working there they always seem to be trying there best to do their jobs but it seems like they re always running out of very basic items like chips  guacamole  soda carbonation  etc. it does not seem like management is doing a good job of inventory or regional managers are not supplying this store with what it needs. I ve seen hourly employees on the floor apologizing for it to rude out of touch customers time and time again. Clearly this location gets a lot more traffic than they are accounting for and it just seems unfair to the staff working there dealing with it. Food is great otherwise. Hourly employees keep it up I appreciate you and I know the long lines are stressful especially when giving disappointing news to customers regularly.  I have worked for a casual dining restaurant very similar to chipotle and I appreciate the good attitudes I ve seen. Uppers  management do your job and get these employees what they need. I ve been to a chipotle in Las Vegas and they seemed to be fully stocked even with hundreds of customers. I understand covid changed a lot but this just seems like mismanagement to me.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,When looking for a good meal that works with my Weight Watchers points  Chipotle didn t disappoint me. There was no wait or line. The service was quick and courteous. I got a bowl and they made sure to load it up. It was enough for two meals. All the tops were fresh and flavorful. The restaurant was clean and very organized. I definitely recommend the riverside Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,Thank you so much for the wonderful service and hot food today. Were y all out of stuff  sure  obviously  times are crazy. I got a great filling meal from a lovely staff doing there best to feed their community with a fantastic positive attitude. You are very appreciated  Thank y all so much
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,Had a quick bite to eat here. Good food at the same decent price as other Chipotles. If you have a craving for quick decent burrito or burrito bowl stop here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,I ordered 2 burritos and a bowl and 2 chips and salsa the burritos everything was on one side instead of the middle and I didn t get my chips first time ordering here maybe the last
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,I love Chipotle  Fresh ingredients  great service and filling food. If you re hungry  this is the place to go. I had two different experiences at this location. The first time I ate here I order a salad bowl with sofritas online and when I opened it up at work I saw that there was hardly anything in the bowl  They could have our way more salad or something. I finished the bowl in a few minutes and was disappointed. The second time I ate here  I dined in and ordered 3 soft flour tacos in person. They loaded those things up  I got sofitas  black beans  fajita veggies  lettuce  sour cream  salsa and cheese. I was so stuffed and happy. More than I should have eaten but I didn t want the tortillas to get soggy. Next time I go to chipotle  I m going to order the soft tacos in person for sure 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,Give it up to the best Chipotle in Austin    This location is clean af and has the downright friendliest staff this side of the Colorado River. I m a little biased  though  because someone compliments my outfit every time I go here.   There s coveted outdoor seating  cool indoor spots  alcohol for sale  and quick service that can churn out orders like none other.   While I wouldn t go out of your way to drive here  it s a great option for those who live close.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,Don t expect them to close the lid on your bowl all the way. I had the liquid from the beans come out  go through the bag  and spill all over my jeans and car upholstery. Closing the lid is a simple job. They didn t care either just gave me a careless apology and a new bag.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,I m not sure what was going on but some of the rice was crunchy. And the quest was grainy like they used powdered cheese. Not the very best I have had  but maybe it was a bad day.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,Apart from you walking on rice  corns and pico  every other things are pretty typical of a chipotle restaurant. Fast service  and decent food. Lots of customers because I went during lunch hours. Overall I ll stop by whenever I m in the area and craves chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,I ve been going to this location for 3 years.  Wonderful staff amd great food. Today was a blessing. My bowl ripped from some freak  accident and in a heart beat replaced. Thank you for the service and the wonderful staff  managment
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,They ve never messed up my order and my expectations are always met  My steak chicken bowl has been excellent regardless of the location I visit.   However  this location in particular is fantastic  I ve shown up once in uniform on my way home from work  I m in the military  and my meal was comped. Chipotle does not offer a military discount  but the manager of this location provided not only a discounted meal  but a free one  On another occasion  out of uniform I ordered again  not expecting any special treatment. I was recognized and comped again   Thank you so much  this review is the least I can do. I wish I could take a bucket of your amazingly delicious chicken home with me 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,Very impressed with this location. Never had any issues with my order. The staff is great and friendly. Location is clean and easy to get too. It is an option to go to if in the area and do not want a burger.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,First  I d like to start by saying how wonderful this Chipotle location is. It s always clean  the staff is so pleasant smiley nice  and until recently the food was kept hot and to perfection  They create the perfect bowl every time and don t give skimpy portions that have you regretting your choice. I love this place  I live next door and use this as a meal twice a week. So convenient   Anyways  there s recently been a change to your steak. Like REALLY noticeable. It used to be cooked to a perfect pink and melted in your mouth. I loved this Chipotle for their steak cooking abilities  However  it s now rubber. It appears to be grey it s so overcooked. It s like we ve boiled the fun and flavor right out and left a gritty piece of yuck. You ve ruined this perfectly good piece of cow. I know you probably have new standards for meal prep with the recent food illness epidemic your chain is experiencing... but let me tell you  I ve stuck by your side but think you can be held to higher standards.  All in all- steak need more melt less chew.   PS- Staff may need educating on what  a tiny little bit of sour cream  means as it has not ever translated correctly and I wind up with a liqui-bowl. 1
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,Poorly seasoned  poorly cooked  low quality overall. Your food will be super watery all with no flavor. They don t care.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,Hard cheap steak meat  Gross. Don t get the steak unless you like a lot of gristle  fat  chewy-non-meat parts  I ordered a salad and when I found out they don t offer white meat chicken I opted for the steak....that was a bad decision. Everything described above  very cheap meat  and I m not talking about 1 or 2 random pieces.....my entire plate had nothing but gross pieces. I only ate about 4 real pieces of meat and the rest was trash pieces. Never again  Freebirds way better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,Just checked this location out and it s nice  The line was out the door but moving pretty quickly  The staff was super nice and chipper. I ordered a side of chips  they were stale so I brought them up to the counter and they replaced no problem. Def a good lunch stop 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,Chipotle always makes my day better. It s so much better to grab a quick meal here then to go to one of the many fast food joints that are polluted down riverside.  When I originally went to the chipotle off stassney  it was closed because it was before 11am. Old frustrated from being at the Public Safety of Transportation Office  I decided to go to the one off riverside by my house. I was hoping by the time I got there it would be 11am.  It was about 10 55 by the time I got into the parking lot. I parked and I noticed people already in there. I thought it was awesome that they were open early even if it was just 5 minutes  That s a huge plus in my book. Especially when you are hangry and not a breakfast gal.   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,Larger than most  nicer layout  cushioned bar stools and a pretty nice patio. Servings do seem to be a tad less than standard and it s kind of amazing how at least 73  of all the tables are always dirty regardless of how many people are there. But it s still delicious Chipotle crack so of course I ll keep coming back. Here are some tips for a better burrito experience from a previous post    -Free things  You can always get a big flour tortilla or up to three corn tortillas on the side  even if you order a bowl or a salad. Speaking of unnecessary carbs  you can also have your burrito wrapped in TWO tortillas.   -Those grilled vegetables for vegetarian entrees can also be added to meat entrees for free. Get those veggies in    -Also fresh chopped jalape os are hidden  but free.   -Even though they ask you if you want black or pinto beans and white or brown rice...you can actually have them all  I have found that if you say both  they actually give you more overall.   -You can also do this with meats  but they will charge you for the more expensive one.  So if I say  half chicken  half steak   I ll get charged for steak .  -If you re not food baby hungry  you can also get a quesadilla   2.95  or a single taco   2.25 .   -Guac  If you want it  order it on the SIDE. It costs the same and you get like double the serving.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,Finally opened this by close proximity to my place.  Glad too because Chipotle is good stuff.  This time I got a chicken burrito  had to spit out my usual two pieces of gristle  they could up the quality of the chicken  but anyway.  Flavor was good and a little spicy.  Everything is nice and clean  the place is very long and narrow  but has a good bit of seating.  Is in the up and coming part of Riverside area and all is nice there of course.  Hope it stays this way.  Employees were personable and asked how my day had gone  it was getting late .  Be back soon 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,The staff was so chipper even tho we walked in right before closing. They were so nice to all the customers left in the store and the food was better than the chipotles  back home.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,There s honestly no good reason to come here. Go to cabo bobs. You get more food at a higher quality including fresh tortillas made on the spot for a lower price. I have no affiliation with cabo bobs.  Or you could go to one of the other millions of places with authentic Mexican food.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,Worst chipotle experience ever. Neither the beans or the rice had any flavor. The meat was mediocre  at best. Completely disappointed in my trip to this location. Not sure I ll be back anytime soon.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,9 57 and I ve witnessed more than at least 20 people walk in to purchase this awesome food but when you come and find out they are out of food because they are close to closing is not cool. On top of a rude and rushing cashier  Riverside location  I understand you re closing soon but you should be prepared to sell until closing. It s 9 59 and people are still walking in wanting to eat. Be prepared  if you see your out of chips and avocado at 9 35 make some more you still have plenty time to serve customers. Not cool chipotle my bowl wasn t the same w out you re chips and awesome avocado. Let me down.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,A nice addition to East Riverside  the patio will be sweet when the weather is cooperating. Food is the same as you find at any Chipotle but the inside is nice with some cool stools and bar areas. Like it 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,Whoever is running the riverside location does a terrible job training their employees in how to roll a burrito. Every time I go in my burrito falls apart the minute I pick it up. Burritos is what y all do. If you can t roll a burrito up properly  making sure the proper amount of food is proportioned so it s not spilling out  you don t need to be making burritos  I highly suggest re-teaching your staff in order to provide the customer with a the satisfactory product they pay for.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,So happy they opened this new chipotle right across the street from me  It s nice and friendly staff  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,This location is terrible. We got to go here because we wanted something fast and close to our house.  The steak in our meals were fishy tasting and fatty. My boyfriend said no one was helpful when he was ordering and the chips were stale. Won t be returning.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,I come here alot and am always greeted in the same way. The steak is less than good so i end up having to gset the chicken which is on par with baby Acapulco. Now when it comes time to roll my burrito i always ask please roll it longer and thinner as i dont enjoy trying to stuff a 4inch wide 4 inch long burrito in my mouth. And they respond wvery time with we cant  so i ask dont roll it ill roll ot myself and get told that it is against policy. Its my money paying for food i want so why do these people tey so hard to say no  Love hate relationship with this place and its closer to simply being hated by me. The staff is terrible.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,They recognize me everyday and always say hi. One of the best chipotles I ve been to 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,77,Always clean  friendly staff  great location. They have never messed up my order and the employees are always in a great mood when I have gone. The line also goes by fast. Definitely my favorite Chipotle in Austin 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,78,We eat a lot of Chipotle at many locations and this place was the cleanest Ive seen. The staff are the BEST as well  Best Chipotle experience to date. Thanks to the staff for being so smiley  happy and genuinely concerned that we had a great experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,79,I am reading about veggin  out on the outside of the bag but yet they were all out of the grilled vegetables at 8 30pm  They also need to install a microwave next to the soda machine because my food was super cold. Horrible experience and never going back to this Chipotle again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,80,This place gets top reviews. Quick  courteous  perfect order  and sleek atmosphere. Love this place. Visited a horrible Chipotle today and wanna make sure and give this location a 5 star review. After what I saw today I d love to give this place more stars. My co-workers come here once a week even though there is your Lamar location probably 1 2 a mile closer.  Now I understand why.  I know you guys are new and steam may run out but I am truly proud of this establishment. Keep it up team and thanks for busting your butts for us 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,81,This Chipotle is great  Very clean and the service I receive here is always top notch  I came here trying to use my BOGO coupon and it wasn t working but the manager guy still gave me the BOGO deal  That s great service that most fast casual places don t have. Thank you Chipotle for being so awesome   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,82,Friendly staff. Good location. Food was hot and great. Nice pre game meal before hitting up the bars and clubs.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,83,Seriously the best chipotle in Austin. Unbelievably fantastic employees. I swear by this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,84,Stopped in on buisness trip  because I love chipotle  This is a super awesome location  the people were sooo extra nice  they thankfully were not to busy as one of my co-workers was a giant pain in the butt  nice  but a pain. They were excedingly tolerant and very friendly.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,85,I visited this location yesterday and let me just tell you it was the worst experience I ve ever had at chipotle. The tables were filthy and besides that the employees were so hateful and rude. The food looked very old and crusty. When I asked them to make me some more steak  they refused and I m so pissed off. I ended up not getting anything and going to the one on congress. Now those people are something else  I love it. I ll take my business there.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,86,Love Chipotle and happy to have one so close. The staff is great and are good on portion sizes. I have really never hs anything here I don t like. If you re tired of the burrito go with a bowl or salad. Better yet  if you re feeling adventurous get a queasrito  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,87,I come here all the time with my boyfriend and the staff is always super nice even when it s late and they have a line out the door. Generous portions and the house made lime tortilla chips are so good with the corn salsa  I m making myself hungry while writing this review.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,88,Lol never again. Closest chipotle to my house but would rather drive farther than deal with the rude employees here again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,89,Chipotle ....I wish I knew how to quit you. No  just kidding  I don t. The ingredients are fresh and FULL of flavor.  Their red  hot  salsa  not really hot for this Mexican  is addicting.  I usually get the burrito bowl with steak and guac.  Chipotle never disappoints. I don t typically eat fast food but Chipotle s meat veggies are responsibly raised without hormones chemicals. SO  bring on the burrito bowls     The staff at this location are friendly and super fast  I was impressed.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,90,Love the app.  I order from it often at this location.  Great group of workers and environment. The food speaks for itself as we all know chipotle is awesome    but the staff is what makes this location great   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,91,I just want to say that I am a huge chipotle fan. I eat it all the time and love it. On that note  I was so excited to hear that they opened up a chipotle so close to my apartment  However  this chipotle was not up to par with the other ones. The amount of food you typically get at a chipotle is pretty top notch especially if you get the burrito bowl. The amount I got here was ridiculously little. It barely filled up the bowl even with the  extra  lettuce in it. She gave me about half a scoop of brown rice and same with everything else. I probably won t come back to this location again unless this changes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,92,Just witnessed one of the girls here drop a sharpener on the floor  pick it up  sharpen her knife and the cut into some cooked steak for the line. I decided on chicken.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,93,The staff is super nice and since it recently only opened up  it hasn t gotten super busy yet. They always ask me about my day and accommodating if I want extra rice or veggies. I love Chipotle in general and this is a great location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,94,First  their staff is a bunch of high school kids who know nothing about customer service or food prep. I always go to Cabo Bobs but thought I would try Chipotle this time. Big mistake   No choice in taco types. It either corn or flour. Tacos are tiny   They skimp on the meat big time. No baha beans and minimal selection of toppings. Cabo Bobs you get MUCH more for your money and it tastes great. I will never return to this location or any for that matter. Total waste 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,95,Great food   Always fresh  Try the carnitas  Everyone is always courteous and efficient.  I m a frequent customer.  I love Chipotle 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,96,I am a racist gentrifier who loves pushing out POC from their homes and businesses and destroying local cultures by supporting cheap and insulting imitations of their food when there are authentic and tastier versions in the same exact area owned and operated by people who have lived in the neighborhood that I just moved into for generations.  That s why I love coming to this Chipotle instead of the better and more authentic options right next door.  I eat here every day. I love how mild their food is.  Real Mexican food is TOO SPICY    If I had a conscious  I would feel very ashamed of myself  but since I don t  I will continue to come here because my favorite flavor is cardboard with mayo on it and that is what Chipolte provides.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,97,Never been to chipotle before. Got a salad bowl with grilled chicken. Everyone was super nice. Food was much better than I expected from a chain. Veronica  might have been Victoria I can t remember  gave me the meal free because it was my first visit   So awesome.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,98,I eat here once a week and the food is always so yummy  The staff is also super friendly every time I have been there. I just LOVE their guacamole 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,99,I have multiple food allergies  and the staff has been very polite and helpful both times I have come to this location. They make sure they are as safe as possible with my food and ensure that only the person who changed their gloves and washed their hands is the person who takes my food through the whole line. I really appreciate it when people go out of their way to help me out  since I know dealing with a customer with food allergies can be a pain. These guys are awesome.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,100,I went to this location about a week ago around 11 30am with a co-worker and dined in.  I ordered the 3 tacos combination  2 chicken and 1 steak  along with an order of chips and guacamole plus a beer.  It wasn t too busy at the time but the dude who waited on me started my order  told me he was waiting on the steak to complete my order but then left to do something else mid-stream.  Another guy saw that my order was holding up the line and asked me what i was waiting on.  I pointed the other dude out and said he was supposed to be getting the steak.  The competent one completed my order with fillings and i proceeded down the line.  I decided at last moment to get the chips and guacamole and a beer to add to my order.  A girl around 20 asked me for my ID when I requested the beer.  I told her I wasn t even close to being under 21.  I m 44   She offered no explanation  just a silly smile  but another female co-worker  assured  me it was  ok  and just accept the request for my ID.  I stupidly complied instead of just getting water but I just can t help feeling somewhat upset and also amused whenever a person who appears to be around 20 or so asks a 44 year old or so for his her ID   I m sure if that same 20 year old was at a party with other young people and I came to it that same person who asked me for ID at the restaurant would say  why is this old guy here at the party    Sorry for the rant but I always find that very strange.  BTW  I don t look that young.  Sometimes i get mistaken for being in my 50s.  I think the bottom line is trust.  That wait staff is saying they don t find me trustworthy.  And I don t want to be some place where they think I can t be trusted.  BTW  the chicken and steak was DRY and the chips were HALF-BAKED and very GREASY.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,1,Rita s Mexican Food sits in an older industrial building near the intersection of Rockland and Metric. Don t let the outside of this building full you  Rita s is the real deal.  I have eaten breakfast  lunch  and dinner here. Their prices are very good and the quality of food is excellent.  For breakfast  I ate an order of migas. I am pretty picky about my migas and the ones I ate at Rita s were very good. They came with homemade flour tortillas  fried potatoes  and refried beans.  For lunch  I have eaten there cheese enchiladas. Rita s prepares them just like I am used to.  The one time I have eaten dinner at Rita s  I had carne guisada. It was very tasty and came with several sides. The serving was generous and I would eat their carne guisada .  It is fairly hard to find authentic Mexican food in this part of North Austin close to Burnet Road. Rita s is about as authentic as it gets.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,2,So I they had advised consume de chivo. It s a soup of Goat . So I placed my order and that looked at me like was from another planet  When I explain to them what I wanted they told me that had no idea what I was talking about . I am Mexican but they treat me like I was American . Not an insult but made me feel like amd Idiot .   So I ended up ordering menudo . That had only 1 size . While I was waiting I asked about the carnitas and asked if I could try some . They told me ok . So I waited then waited then waited. Finally my menudo Came our . It was a 8oz cup instead of a large . When I asked them about it they said it s only one size . So  10.00for a 8oz cup ripoff . And when I asked them about waiting to try the carnitas.they totally ignored me
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,3,My friend lives close to this restaurant  but we were in no condition to drive so we used Grubhub...not knowing they d be closing in 20 minutes  I m SORRY y all  I know that s a d ck move . The food arrived quick  hot  and truly delicious. The queso is addicting. The chicken fajitas were really good  loved the spice level. I ll be ordering again for sure.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,4,Saw some good reviews and gave it a try. Quiet strip-center restaurant in the Rutland-Metric  area. Decent  reasonably short menu. I had their chicken mole  and it was astonishingly good. You can taste the different levels of flavor in the sauce. Appears to be house-made tortillas and salsa as well. Spotlessly clean  good service  decent prices. Definitely will return.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,5,The place only had one other person. Lackluster for sure.   The queso was just cheese no onions and peppers  kinda tastes bland  same with the salsa.   The quesadillas were a bit dry but edible and the chicken fajita meat was good.   The sour cream was real but the guacamole looked like green sherbet I didn t even taste it.   Side of refined beans was a big bowl for  2.50 it tasted rancid. Disgusting. I ate one bite and she refused to take it off my ticket  bad business.   I will never eat here again.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,6,Fantastic breakfast tacos  flavorful. I found this place on Google maps. Yummy. What a gem 
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,7,Save yourself. This place is terrible. Maybe if you grew up outside of Texas and have never had good Tex mex you might enjoy it  but just don t bother if you know what good Tex mex is. If I had to guess  the  guacamole  seems to be extruded from some sort of industrial sized bag of pur ed avocados  no tomatoes  onions  peppers . Tortillas are not fresh. Beans are flavorless  rice is over cooked. Tamales taste really gross  as in  I m legitimately afraid they will make me sick because they tasted like battery acid. And the enchiladas obviously use that pre-shredded Mexican cheese mix you can get from any grocery store - it doesn t fully melt because of the preservatives and is also generally flavorless.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,8,Very solid TexMex 1960 s-style. Great service and traditional presentation every time I ve eaten here. This is the kind of food that put El Rancho in the history books.  Typical sombrero-on-the-wall decor  and throw in some old maps of Texas and random posters of Emilio Zapata   Pancho Villa. I d say Rita s was a little pricey for the area  if the food wasn t right on. I m more leery of the  5.99 value-lunch format  anyway.  It s generally slop w  more slop...  I ve been eating Central-Texas TexMex for over half a century. This is the real stuff.  and yes  chorizo IS freaking greasy  people. If it doesn t stain the bag  it s not doing it s job .  If you re driving around the Domain-area looking for trendy dining  stay nearer to Mopac. You probably won t like the Rutland very much...     BTW  9.5 stars on the chips. If they weren t made on site  they were made a block away. awesome fresh.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,9,The best place to get breakfast tacos in the area  I admit I haven t sat down for a meal there. BUT  the owners are the nicest people in the world. And the breakfast tacos are always amazing and quick. If you re looking for some good tacos  this is the place
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,10,The Sopa Azteca is hands down the Best Tortilla Soup in all of Austin. This quaint little hidden gem has been here since 1992. It s ran by a husband and wife team that spoils you like grandma would. I very much enjoy popping I here for some great soup and Tamales.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,11,I ordered two breakfast tacos  one I threw away. Yes that bad  it was a chorizo and eggs  my the time I got to work half a block away  the paper bag was full of grease  yuck. I tried to eat the Egg and Bacon  I mean anyone can make a bacon and egg right  NOT  it was horrible.  On to the next breakfast place.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,12,Another one Down...Right TOO it...Queso wasn t bad  good  Clingage   but we didn t get our second round of chips  so at least 1 2 went to waste  sorry not my job to remind ya to keep it full.. Sad...Chips were good.. Green Salsa was good.  Wife had the beef enchiladas. No flavor at all in the beef. Rice for both us was a downer  sticky  haven t had that in a long time. Biggest hit of the meal for my wife  the sauce. I went with the combo plate. Cheese Enchilada  Tamale  Hard Shell Beef Taco  and a chicken flauta. Oh and rice and beans..Let not talk about the rice  beans were good. Tamale and enchilada we middle of the road  good sauce. Taco meat had no flavor  dripped water  not grease. I would have to say steamed  reminds me of something from elementary school. The chicken in the Flauta ..DRY as Moab in August  and no flavor. So we hang our heads and head to the next place on the list.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,13,Great food. Authentic Mexican. Local to domain burnet rd area. Serves breakfast lunch and dinner. Great happy hour prices.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,14,This was the most nasty food ever.. not real Mexican food.. all processed. Guacamole was soup. It was more of Chinese food than fajitas.. uuuugggghhhh
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,15,We just moved to Austin from San DIego  where there is a mom and pop taco shop on every corner  and I picked this place because other yelp reviews claimed that this was exactly that  and looked up mexican restaurants in our neighborhood. I went there when it was empty  meaning  the food should be INSANELY good because both Rita and her husband were cooking for me... and only me...  I asked for a simple chicken burrito with cheese and sour cream. Literally 19 seconds later out came my food. A cold  cracked  flour taco shell with steamed   but cold  unseasoned chicken  shredded cheese out of a bag and a big blob of sour cream in the middle. Served with this  burrito  was canned refried beans and sticky  flavorless rice. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. yuk.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,16,This was obviously a very off night based on some of the good reviews I read about this place.  We stopped in  later in the evening on a Friday night  around 9.  Place was so empty we thought it was closed.  Just the chef and wait person was there  owners   not sure   but our food experience was so bad that frankly I can t even remember what we ordered    That never happens and this was only about 2 weeks ago. I do remember the salsa that came with the chips was excellent. Very spicy and very flavorful  so that much I do remember. I also remember that the tortillas I had with my meal tasted old and the chicken in the dish I ordered was simply tasteless.  I don t know how to describe it but maybe they used some type of memory block spice since it was likely the last order of the night and they were scraping the bottom of the barrel. Oh wait  I remember my order now.  It was a chicken burrito.  Worst one I ever had. It looked like it was  deflated  and limp and not a respectable amount of  stuff  that makes a burrito nice and fat and oozing with  stuff    We clearly do remember that when we left we vowed not to even come back and try something different.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,17,The bacon  egg and cheese breakfast tacos are huge  taste awesome and very inexpensive.  Bacon is always crispy.  Only need one to fill me up.  The couple that own it are always very nice.  Never had lunch or dinner here.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,18,This place has really good breakfast or lunch tacos. It doesn t receive 5 starts because the tortillas aren t fresh but they are consistent with your orders. I always get bacon egg and potato with cheese or carne guisada with cheese tacos 
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,19,I have been coming here for a few years these people are always so sweet  The food is always amazing and it s always super clean. I m allergic to egg so they always work with me on my breakfast tacos.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,20,Great local Mexican restaurant  Worth stopping in for lunch or breakfast tacos  It s hidden away in north Austin.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,21,Not that good. The food is too expensive for what it is. Also  order at the counter for take out. For dining in  sit down at a table. Best of luck 
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,22,I have been to Ritas multiple times during lunch hours and it has always been a pleasant experience. Staff is friendly and the food does not take long to come out.  The Chips and Salsa are excellent  I ordered the soup with Chicken and Rice and it was really yummy. I also ordered a chicken tamale and it was extremely moist and super delicious. I went ahead and pre-ordered a dozen tamales and am picking them up tomorrow along with the awesome salsa.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,23,The queso is great  ask for the green sauce as they did not bring it out with the chips. My sister and I enjoyed our meals  definitely would recommend 
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,24,This place is great. Reasonable prices. Carne guisada is legit. Reminds me of Corpus Christi Mexican food. Staff is friendly and smiles. I love it. Most times I spend less than  7.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,25,Rita s has been around for a long time and the breakfast tacos have always been excellent.  If stopping by for lunch  then I recommend the pastor.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,26,Rita s Mexican Restaurant is as authentic as Mexican food gets up here in Austin. Their homemade salsa is outstanding. I am still amazed that Rita s sells manudo everyday  all day. I do wish that they stayed open a little bit longer. They close around 8pm  and sometimes even sooner.  There are some dishes that I do not like at this restaurant  but it is more because I am not used to the  style  of how they cook these dishes  eg  migas with cheese . Even with that said  I ll still give this restaurant 4 stars.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,27,Since I am in a nearby area I stopped in to get an order of enchiladas   beans  rice was cold they look so  extremely good but  was cold bland   no  seasonings as if they were preparing they for an old retirement home for seniors the corn tortillas was soggy from the taco   greases like they had been warmed over just not  so  very good experience for me. It was one of the worse experiences I ve had in many years just plain old horrible.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,28,Food is good  definitely authentic  a bit spicy so be prepared for it if you are sensitive to it. This is your typical Mom n Pop Mex place to go get breakfast tacos or a quick inexpensive lunch on a weekday  Don t expect anything more like the other critics that gave this place just one or two stars  that was harsh ...place is good  you get your money s worth ...I ordered the green enchiladas with sour cream on the side and I cleaned my plate. Hope you enjoy 
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,29,I probably should lower my expectations sometimes....the food was tasty...however....service left a little to be desired. I personally felt as if my very small plate was  thrown  at me ... And I was not offered a drink....I had to ask for it...no refill either...well  at least I m not hungry anymore...that s what counts right  
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,30,Phenomenal el pastor dish  Mole is amazing too. I have driven by this place dozens of times and only recently stopped in. I wish I had done it long ago. Rita is a sweetheart and the service is amazing  I ll be back often.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,31,Best breakfast taco s ever  .  Seriously  they are fantastic.  I ve also had lunch there a few times and had the El pastor.  Also  delicious.  They aren t great on service  but I don t care.  I call my order in  walk in the front door and get my tacos  and head to work.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,32,Worked three blocks from it one sat. so me and my co-worker started wit some breakfast tacos    2 thumbs up  so we tried it for lunch    chicken fajita nachos  if anybody try it u want be sorry.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,33,Another early discovery upon moving to Austin. RIta and her family are so sweet.  This is a great mom  amp  Pop restaurant with the best homemade fresh Mexican food. The atmosphere is very casual  portions are good and the prices are just right.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,34,Great family-run place tucked away in a dated strip mall.  Grandkids show up once in a while and run around the place.  Consistently delicious food  at low to medium prices.   Rita makes the salsa fresh every day and it is excellent.  Everything is good - my favorites are the fajitas mexicana  chicken ranchero and the two different types of marinated pork tacos.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,35,The food is tasty and the prices are reasonable and low. Locally ran and friendly. Plus you can get a really huge tamale for 1.25 each
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,36,I agree its very clean.  I m sorry to say I wasn t impressed at all with the food.  I had the carnitas tacos.  The meat tasted reheated.  The  homemade  salsa I put on the tacos was very mild and had no seasoning just tomato and onion I could hardly tell there was salsa at all.  The Mexican Spanish rice tasted like Uncle Ben s minute rice and the refried beans were also bland.  Just my opinion.  The service was very curteous.  I am Hispanic  specifically Texmexican so I don t know what the food in Monterey tastes like but its not remotely like momma s or  buelitas.  The prices are comparable to Chuys lunch specials I think I was expecting less based on my assessment of the overhead location.
Rita's Mexican Restaurant,37,I have been going to this restaurant for over 6 years and by far... this is the best and most authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten. We have hold corporate breakfast and ordered tacos from Rita s and they have always been on time every single time delivering the food. Their service and customer service is outstanding and friendly. When you visit this place  make sure to taste their salsa   it is sooooo good  
Taqueria Piedra Grande,1,Very good saz n.  Elote phenomenal    Professional  amp  fast service  Agua de pi a muy rica.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,2,First of all I didn t even try the food here but I would still give it 5 stars every single time as I did have the best aguas frescas I have ever had in my entire life  Like literally I can t even describe to you how good it was. Stop everything and go try it now  They should bottle it and sell it in stores. Crazy good   insane  
Taqueria Piedra Grande,3,My friends decided to take a trek on Eater s Austin Taco Mile and this place was really appealing to one of my friends who grew up in Mexico and you can see why. The food is homey  everything is made to order and you can even see them pressing the tortillas fresh   The gorditas here are great - nice crisp  chew contrast as you bite into it  good amount of vegetables  chicharron for us  and pairs well with the tart  spicy green salsa. The tacos are decent too - we tried the al pastor and the corn tortillas are among the best that I ve had anywhere - they re fresh  taste like corn and have some pliability that you don t ordinarily see. The Al pastor itself I thought was a little dry and underwhelming though. My friend who got some chicken tacos said those were pretty good though  so maybe it was just that particular meat. Customary cilantro and onions too   Can t go wrong stopping by here  Cash only.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,4,Tried the Cubana  and it was easily the best sandwich I ve had all year. Lots of fast food places nearby  resist those and check out the food trucks on this corner.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,5,Went here last night and the chicken quesadillas was sooo good. Liked the person who took my order too he seemed really nice. It was ready in like 3 minutes too. I definitely plan on coming back here soon to try out more of their food   .
Taqueria Piedra Grande,6,I love both locations  Their Chile and their food is packed with flavor   I always get the carne asada quesadilla tastes just like a Cali style quesadilla  I also get the torta ahogada con pastor or carne asada  
Taqueria Piedra Grande,7,I waited in my car for 35 minutes for a quesadilla to be ready and 3 other people people who orders after me were served before I was.. I went to the window asking about my order and they said oh sorry we called ur name but we didn t know if you were ur car   when I clearly told the man who took my order I ll wait in my car
Taqueria Piedra Grande,8,Love this place   I love the carne asada is juice and crispy at the same time Made to perfection. I always get the carne asada quesadilla and I also love the al pastor Torta Abogada  Bampazo 
Taqueria Piedra Grande,9,the ladies serving me were sweet. 3 tacos and 1 gringas ran me about  12 after taxes  before tip. the gringas were my favorite--extra cheesier than others that ive had. the corn tortillas are hand-made.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,10,Tacos are the best  Fast and Friendly service. The place was clean and had beautiful landscaping.
Taco Shack,1,I m a fan of taco shack and especially this location.   I drop by here a few times a month and have made small orders for myself and the kids as well as huge orders for my entire office team.   The food has always been good and the they have never gotten my order wrong.   The same group of women have been working here for years and they are always friendly.
Taco Shack,2,Food is ok.  I got two tacos and think they were fine but I prefer Taco Ranch.  I was in this area and the one on Lamar is closed on Mondays in May 2022 so I came down here.  Service was fast.
Taco Shack,3,I swung by on a quiet afternoon on a Friday. I got the special taco plate for lunch. The location is quite tiny and you can park in a nearby park. They have 1 table inside and 3 picnic tables outside to enjoy some sun.  My main gripe about the food was how the texture and flavour of the food was just very off. The taco plate comes with 2 tacos  refried beans  and spanish rice. I asked for some authentic corn tortillas but they served them to me in flour tortillas. The spanish rice is probably the worst rice I ve ever had. Either it had been left out for a bit or microwaved  the texture was terribly off and definitely not fresh. It was also unbelievably bland  almost white rice level of bland with some random tomatoes and veggies thrown in. The beans had the consistency of baby food  really really watery .  The only saving grace of the meal was the meat. It was actually pretty decent  Carne Guisada was pretty juicy and flavorful. The beef fajitas were decent and not too tough. Although the meat was good  getting the order wrong and all the other bad stuff just dragged the meal down.  Will definitely not be back to this Taco Shack  it didn t help that I had stomach problems later on that evening .
Taco Shack,4,Your better off eating a dirty diaper than the garbage they call food their serving   Two bites in and I spit it out  Barbacoa and carne guisada was disgusting  So basically paid 14  for garbage.
Taco Shack,5,This review is long overdue. This Taco Shack is the best one in Austin. I have been eating their breakfast tacos for years. They are made to order  fresh  and hot. I love the salsa too.
Taco Shack,6,I eat here frequently for both breakfast and lunch and the ladies that work here are very friendly and the food always comes out fast and is never a disappointment. I already enjoy the food but my taco special today was one of the best I ve ever had. Not sure what changes you ve made to your rice recipe but I love it  Thanks for always being consistent and oh so friendly. I ve been coming here for over 5 years now and I most definitely will be back. I can t live with out my chorizo  potato and cheese breakfast tacos 
Taco Shack,7,This is a great little neighborhood taco joint that s cheap  fast  and tasty    It s obviously not going to be fancy or blow your mind  but it s good food for a good price  and the staff is always happy to see you    Their breakfast tacos are always great before a road trip  or on a weekend when I can pick some up for the family.   Their lunch specials are pretty good too  I enjoy their cheese enchilada lunch special and they put lots of chopped onions on top. Yum 
Taco Shack,8,A small hole in the wall but very good. The staff are Mexicans so the food taste authentic. I don t care what other posts have said but this is a great place to eat. The enchiladas and tacos were very good 
Taco Shack,9,Horrible service  and he food came out stuffed so tight in the bowl with whole pieces of bacon. I ordered a breakfast bowl. The sausage tastes freezer burned and the potatoes had absolutely no flavor. Was super disappointed
Taco Shack,10,I love this Taco Shack location  The staff is quick and friendly  Food is delicious and inexpensive.
Taco Shack,11,Love there chorizo   Service is fast and less expensive than the other taco places.  Drive thru 
Taco Shack,12,Can t say I ve had any of the negative stuff happen to me in some of the reviews I ve seen here. I come here for the breakfast burritos  and everything in it appears to be fresh and made-to-order. They ve been courteous 90  of the time I go. Would recommend calling to order ahead as there can sometimes be a wait
Taco Shack,13,This place was pretty good. Watched the Texans game here and got three different tacos that I liked a lot. My buddy didn t like his however  so I guess it can be very varied. A bit pricy too for small tacos. But still on flavor I very much enjoyed mine so 4 stars. I d like to give 3.5 but 3 is too low.
Taco Shack,14,Really  Items in this picture are SMALLER than they appear. A  5 dollar breakfast bowl with the dimensions of 4 in x 2 in. Aka  SIDE item at any BBQ place. What a joke. And the food sucks too. Nasty flour tortillas.
Taco Shack,15,We had breakfast tacos on the brain and wanted to try the oft rave reviewed cocino de consuelo.  CDC was closed so we went to Taco Shack. People in Austin have been shocked that i ve never hit this particular favorite so i figured it was time to take the Taco Shack challenge.   So besides the limited selection and the surly cash register lady  I had a super random exchange that colored the whole experience. We ordered a bevo and a burnet road special. When my   tacos  were ready  i picked them up  decided to eat outside and opened the bags to discover two huge salsas. That s it. No tacos. So i went back inside and looked for another bag. No bag. So then I m kind of looking around the thimble-sized shop and the counter lady acts like i am ANNOYING her with my presence. Then the weird exchange happened just like this    Her  What are you looking for  Me  Im looking for my tacos Her  You already got your tacos Me  No... there were only two salsas in the bag. No tacos Her   yelling to the guys  she wants more salsa  Me  No... I HAVE salsa. I need tacos.  Her  What  Me   looking at her like she s insane  going outside  getting the salsa  showing it to her  I HAVE salsa. Her  OH  Taking the salsa    Me  Um i d like to keep one of them. To eat with my tacos. So... where are my tacos  Her   in Spanish  yelling at cooks that that they misunderstood the order and to make me said tacos Me  Ok i guess i come back in  Her  Ignoring me. Me  Standing there like a moron.   This whole exchange literally stopped the ordering in its tracks. Everyone was staring  the lady was obviously exasperated and I almost felt like busting out my relatively decent spanish to clarify the situation but then didn t want to be that girl anymore than I already was.   After the fiasco  we finally get tacos that were tasteless  wildly egg heavy and weirdly watery. I dont know how that happens but it was really unappealing. Combined with my weird exchange  this goes to the bottom of my breakfast taco stops.
Taco Shack,16,What I like about Taco Shack   the fact that it s a true American success story.  Family works their asses off selling tacos out of what is literally a series of shacks scattered around town.  Eventually  the dad is riding around on a decked out burnt-orange-and-white scooter with  Taco Shack  emblazoned on the side  owns a location in the swanky Frost Bank building  and takes over an old Long John Silver s location on a prime stretch of Lamar.  What I don t like about Taco Shack   the food.  The breakfast tacos taste all right  but if I eat more than one  I almost always get a stomach ache.  And the fajita tacos on the lunch dinner menu are gooey and drippy and just gross.  Fortunately  there are many others who like Taco Shack and can help it carry on the success it s enjoyed thus far.  This location literally has ONE very tiny table inside that you really do not want to try to sit at  because people will be constantly bumping into you as they try to crowd into the interior to keep their place in line.  There are a few picnic tables outside  but it seems like most of this location s clientele gets their tacos to go.  I have to hand it to the owners of this place for keeping this location open even after opening their much bigger swankier location just a stone s throw away on Lamar.  It does have a certain charm all its own....although it might be the kind of  charm  that realtors talk about when they re trying to sell a really  really small house.
Taco Shack,17,Price is really important when we re discussing breakfast tacos.  I think it s  dare I say  the most important thing.  There are only so many unique ways to prepare eggs  cheese  and potatoes.  On this all-important criteria  Taco Shack falls short.  I like their breakfast tacos  but not their price.  Loss of a star  at least  for a lack of value in the surprisingly competitive  cheap Mexican breakfast  category.    Note the lack of virtually any indoor seating  too  just in case the weather is bad and you can t sit outside at the picnic tables.  Their shack tacos  crispy tacos  are good  which was a pleasant surprise   although the shells taste like Old El Paso brand shells.
Taco Shack,18,A burrito should NOT have water coming out of it   A burrito should have some kind of seasoning on the meat  salt being the bare basic of seasonings.  A burrito should NOT look like a round turd.  Do NOT come here for a burrito.
Taco Shack,19,I come here because its convenient  good and cheap. But most importantly  I am always running late in the mornings and its never busy. I park in one of their 3 parking spots  I walk in and order 2 tacos. I pay. I get my tacos 20 seconds later. And I leave. Its as simple as that.   Do not come here if you are on a  diet.  Do not come here and expect there to be no grease. Its mexican food for crying out loud. I hate that when I go eat Mexican with someone  or make some. A certain someone I seem to hang out with too much always gripes.... ewwwhh its so greasy  Just look at that grease   What do you think this is  A salad bar  Come onnnn   With that being said  I can only recommend the breakfast tacos. 2 toppings for  1.65. Not bad for some yummy filling breakfast. I normally get a bean and cheese. yes  the beans fall out the end of the taco. But i try and play a little game called  catch it with my mouth.  My only criticism is the chorizo. Its good  don t get me wrong. But....I m used to egg  amp  chorizo to be COOKED TOGETHER  at the same time. Not egg separate  and meat separate. Everyone in here is not from America  heavy accents. They know this. Yet they still cook it separate. I guess they are trying to stick with the price saying 2 toppings. I think I may ask them about it next time.   Still  its pretty awesome to have 3 locations near me. I d say there are 3 within 3 miles of me.
Taco Shack,20,I ve had some seriously good tacos in town. Unfortunately  none of them came from here.  Love this truly  shack  of a location with it s tiny interior and picnic tables outside. Sadly  the food just doesn t deliver. The chorizo is pretty good  but most everything else is completely devoid of flavor.  The eggs had no taste at all and tasted as if they d been watered down. The beans and potatoes were both also completely without flavor  seasoning  anything. BLAND would be putting it mildly.   With all the places to get breakfast tacos in town  I m surprised an institution such as this has survived when their product seems to be lacking both in flavor and imagination.
Taco Shack,21,Very dissapointed in the quality and taste of the food at Taco Shack on Medical Pkwy. The refried beans are bland and soupy. The potatoes are like flavorless pieces of styrofoam. Their idea of migas is precooked scrambled eggs and folded into pico de gayo with some tostadas. They have sacrificed quality for quantity. The measure of any restaurant is the quality of it s basic dishes. The beans are horrendous and the spanish rice is abhorrent.  After giving them 3 chances I will not be returning and cannot recommend them to anyone that seeks good Mexican food.
Taco Shack,22,How did taco s become a regular part of my diet  Breakfast  lunch  and dinner. Taco Shack is definitely a good substitute for any of those meals.... but I don t see myself driving across town. Taco Shack is average. They definitely aren t the worst taco s in town... but they aren t the best either.    5 stars for a local place having Diet DP on tab -3 stars for having a bathroom so close to the kitchen ordering area.... gross  2 stars for having a lot of outdoor seating -1 stars for not having any indoor seating if it was cold or raining.   2 stars for decent tacos   Wait  doesn t that bring us back to 5 stars    Put the abacus down there Good Will Hunting..... it s just for show.
Taco Shack,23,In  out  stuffed with cheesy  potato-y goodness. Slurp  crunch  yummm. Give me a breakfast burrito to go and I m a happy camper.   I see a lot of nasty reviews on here for this Taco Shack and can t help but wonder if my terrific taco experience was simply a fluke. Even so  it was a warm  perfectly melty  hit-the-spot-with-salsa kind of fluke. and that may be the best kind.
Taco Shack,24,I d really like to give Taco Shack four stars because I really  really love their shack taco.  With eggs  potato  chorizo and cheese  its pretty much the perfect breakfast taco. On those mornings when you re hung-over or just really hungry  the Burnet Road burrito hits the spot  for sure. It s filled with egg  potato  bacon and cheese and is big enough for breakfast  lunch and maybe a mid-afternoon snack.  Yes  Taco Shack is a good staple for breakfast tacos.  Unfortunately  I don t like their prices.  Only two ingredients for 1.49 and extras are another .35.  You can go to several other breakfast taco places around town and do much much better  but considering that this shack on Medical Parkway is right in my path to work  I find myself stopping by pretty often.  As far as lunch goes they seem to be pretty hit or miss  I like the chalupas  but they re nothing special.
Taco Shack,25,Just a quick bite at TS. Disappointed breakfast tacos where not available all day  but nice friendly drive thru service. Reasonable fajita tacos. Overall good job.
Taco Shack,26,This place is cool because it is the original location.  Its nice to see a successful local chain and see that the original location is still standing.  This location has odd hours  and I only come here for breakfast  but their breakfast tacos seem to be consistently a bit better than the N. Lamar location. Perhaps the quality comes from the lower volume of business   Their breakfast tacos  recommend the shack taco or a potato  egg  and cheese  possibly add guac   hit the spot and are the perfect hangover remedy.  I also like this location because it forces you to eat outside  would not eat this in my car  and that just adds to a good start to your day.
Taco Shack,27,Why  oh why do people like this place   I ve tried several times to like it.   It doesn t work for me at all.  The food is mediocre at best.    Less than a mile away  you have Taco Deli  Torchy s  and several other places that can do a nice Mexican meal ranging from standard Tex-Mex fare  which is what Taco Shack tries and fails to do  to edgy and gourmet.
Taco Shack,28,Pretty good. I go here because it s close to home. Perfect  thick  center-cut bacon. It s a breakfast place and they have gross  cheap OJ. All breakfast places should at least offer good OJ.   They are also closed Sundays  Shame
Taco Shack,29,Big things come in small packages.  Taco Shack just might have the highest breakfast size to restaurant size ratio in the city.  OK  so it s a meaningless ratio  but you won t be disappointed when a burrito the size of a wheelbarrow tames your growling stomach.  Taco Shack has received a lot of criticism for being bland.  In a sense  I can understand where these folks are coming from.  TS doesn t feature the wildly imaginative recipes that  say  Torchy s does  nor does it have the spicy  savory food that more authentic places have.  It s definitely food geared toward a more conventional American palate  but calling it  bland  is a misnomer.  TS s fare is in fact highly satisfying in much the same  simple way that a Whataburger is--and in true American form  there is enough food in one serving to feed three non-Americans.  Take the  Burnet Road  burrito  for example.  It is a massive contraption overstuffed with thick potatoes  pillowy scrambled eggs  and gooey cheese.  You say  wait just a minute  Jeremy.  You mean that the entire burrito is made of mushy  semi-veg-friendly stuff   Not to worry  the good folks at TS have you covered.  Because they love you  they added a layer of crispy bacon on top that adds a wonderful  crunchy texture and some much-needed animal fat.  The result is an orgasmically satisfying brunch  even if you can tell it didn t come from Jalisco.
Taco Shack,30,My wife  amp  I have been going to the Taco Shack since we moved to Austin nearly 14 years ago so I think it s about time I post a Yelp review. I ve loved watching their success over the years  from their start in the modest location off Medical Pkwy - which happens to be right around the corner from where we used to live  how I miss those morning walks to  1 - to several locations around Austin. A true local success.  I ve had their entire breakfast menu and some lunch items  the 1 star deduct is for lunch and the Fox news on their TVs ... but  for me  it s all about The Shack Taco  though the barbacoa is a close second.   The Shack is  Fluffy eggs  perfectly fried potatoes crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside  spicy chorizo fried with a slight crispness  sprinkled w  finely shredded cheddar cheese  all wrapped in a warm flour tortilla served w  a side of their great hot sauce... heaven  This perfect breakfast taco combination even convinced my mother-in-law who generally shuns any  adulterated  egg concoction... she has also seen the light.  Always friendly staff and  typically  fast service.
Taco Shack,31,Well..let me give this location a review so they will have one for 2014   YES YES YES or SI SI SI...I love this place...the tacos are hot and tasty like San Antonio and not priced like some sort of specialty food.  It is on the way to work and during the many stops on lamar on my way downtown I get to eat - so I am in a good mood when I get to work.  Carne Guizada and bean cheese and egg are my favorites but next year I will try their special tacos   I like the 2 ladies that work there they are always nice.
Taco Shack,32,Let me start off by saying  I love Taco Shack... Pretty much every location EXCEPT this one. I have given this particular location several shots as it s super convenient on the way to work but in the end prefer to go to the Spicewood Springs location. This is all based on service alone.   It appears as though it s always the same lady working the cash register area. This lady is particularly rude and scowl-y. I have never been mean to her or back-talked or anything. I m not that kind of person  yet have continually received this attitude from her over several visits over several years. Starting to think it s not a coincidence and just how she acts towards the average person grabbing a taco. So  if you enjoy ordering to a woman who doesn t acknowledge you re standing there and just stares at you to  ask  for your order  this location is for you.   The lady making the tacos seems very sweet  and the food is near identical to other taco shacks nearby. If you want way more friendly shack service  I highly recommend the Spicewood Springs location 
Taco Shack,33,This Taco Shack is the ONLY one my wife and I go to. It s in our hood and we love it  They know us by name and always deliver consistent breakfast tacos.. They are good  Very good. So good we have to budget for it.  - 
Taco Shack,34,I just moved in down the road and today I gave this place it s third and last chance. While the breakfast tacos can be deemed decent the lunch menu is BLAND.   My biggest problems with TS is over use of refried beans to bulk up the burrito  water dripping from the burrito  as other have clearly noticed   and chopped carrots and peas in their rice  which I have always associated with chintzy  redneck chinese food joints.  The worst part is the woman who takes your order. She is quite possibly the rudest person I have ever encountered. She consistently talks down to me and gives me attitude. Aside from the fact that the food here sucks  having to deal with her actually felt like a burden before I walked in today and left me feeling even worse on my way out the door.  Luckily  a Torchy s just opened on 51st And Burnet. Go there instead  you ll thank me later.
Taco Shack,35,Tried two of the Shack Tacos and a bacon  amp  egg for brunch. Relax  I m going walking afterwards.  The combination of ingredients go well together however I am used to having them cooked together not added together like pieces of Ikea furniture waiting to be assembled. I like that the eggs were pillowy but  as others have commented  one of the three I tried did have watery eggs.   Red salsa  not so much. It is designed for a blander palate. Should have waited to add some green. If I had options i was not asked or offered.  Staff were friendly  like the history of the place and not a bad drink selection considering.  I ll deduct 1 star for value and 1 star for overall flavor. I m willing to give them a chance on lunch  just not on a Saturday since they only do lunch during the week.  In the words of Hoggett   That ll do  Pig. That ll do. 
Taco Shack,36,Sauce is like jello.  Inconsistent with food.  It s great one day and bad the next day.  Order is wrong 50  of the time when we get food.
Taco Shack,37,Usually the dive taco places are more authentic. This place is like a Tex mex taco dive. If you are looking for limes  cilantro  pico and that authentic tast  keep on looking. However  this place is a great deal  and the food is pretty darn yummy. I give it 3 stars because I really prefer authentic style  but if possible I would go 3.5
Taco Shack,38,It s one of  those cases of  I remember when  again..     I remember the 1999-2002 Taco Shack peroid. Before they had 7 locations and forgot where they came from.  Michelle C. says it best  talking about the American Dream kind of ideal  but really  somewhere along the way they forgot the customer.     The tacos here were my favorite  and it was so close to work I would get them almost EVERY work day. I guess I hadn t explored around enough  or I m too much a convenience-slave.      Anyway they were fat  tasty tacos served up quickly. They still have fast workers  but the fillings have gotten skimpier and the prices have risen 2 or 3 times since I first visited. I know inflation is a bitch  but lets  see if they go ahead and up it to over 2 bucks for 3 fillings.  It seemed the more locations they opened  the more I had to pay.     Stick it to me  the loyal customer   Not easily forgiven.  Now I just go to Dan s Hambugers on Lamar to get properly full for less.
Taco Shack,39,i know how many people have a soft little sentimental spot for their hometown faves - but i m gonna upset some of yall like i did with my review of that  burger place  called hut s - so here it is in a nutshell  seriously  all you need to know . . .   1.  nothing special 2.  a bit pricier than less  caucasianified  places 3.  save you re money and go to places that have better  cheaper tacos i.e. taqueria arandas  tamale house  las cazuelas  taco mex  la mexicana  moving on . . .
Taco Shack,40,Good  but not great. We came here on a Saturday morning after finding our original choice was closed on Saturdays. Since we already had breakfast tacos on our mind and this was right down the street  we figured what the hell. Although the tacos were good  there was nothing special or unique about them that set them apart from various other breakfast tacos I have eaten around town. Nonetheless  it was a cheap  satisfying meal  although one that I ll unlikely have again anytime in the near future.
Taco Shack,41,I ve frequented this location for several years and always experienced good service and delicious tacos.
Taco Shack,42,It would seem difficult to botch a breakfast taco  but these folks appear to have found a way.  Sure  they are served quickly  but that is little consolation when the salsa is tasteless and the eggs are watery.  Now that Taco Deli is down the street  one would hope that they d step up their game.
Taco Shack,43,The tacos here are pretty good and cheap--I can usually be in and out in under 5 minutes during the mornings.  However  it is very small and can get very  cozy .
Taco Shack,44,Location and the fact there is a drive-thru makes this place somewhat convenient.  But  honestly  the food here is just not that good.  The drive thru line in this former Long John Silver s is never quick and there are just so many better taco places in Austin.  The carne guisada was fatty and had a slimy but tough texture.  I liked the lettuce tomato cheese toppings at first  but I think it was because it disguised the taste of the meat  which isn t a good thing. The beef fajitas  seasoning was slightly sweet and not very tasty.  And you get the same lettuce tomato cheese topping on everything  so it s all very much the same.  The queso was okay.  The chips are bland and don t really taste fresh.  Nor do the tortillas  I guess not many places make their own tortillas anymore .  For what you get  the price  and time  it s really not worth it.  I won t be back.
Taco Shack,45,I wish I had checked reviews before driving thru for lunch today. This stuff reminds me of the cheap  poor quality food you get around a college campus. You know what I am talking about  the places that only stay in business because of their convenient locations and captive customers who don t have time to drive and find something else. Gross   I had a chicken fajita soft taco  a beef fajita soft taco  and a Coke. When I opened the chicken taco  it had a little nasty grey and red stringy  vein   piece in it that I decided to remove. The chicken was blah  and the  steak  was greyish and looked like it had been cooked in a crock pot and never browned. In fact  I think the tacos would have tasted better with no meat at all. I hoped the hot sauce might help flavor this disaster  but it was all hot and nothing else. I m talking weird  blazing  horseradish hot  So I ate what I could and washed it down with the Coke. All that  and I got to pay over  7 for it too. FAIL. Next time I ll go to Torchy s.
Taco Shack,46,I love  love  love the Shack Taco. Chorizo egg and potato are a great way to start your day. But not every day  because Taco Shack is a little too pricey. Sorry  TS  I wanna love you 4 stars  but ouch on the sticker price.
Taco Shack,47,The location is very convenient  and the employees are super friendly. We ve been going there for a while  and Marta  the cashier  knows our family now. The service is very fast. The way I judge taco places is by the crispiness of their bacon  and Taco Shack is a win  the bacon is perfectly crispy.
Taco Shack,48,I was talking with a friend at work the other day about TS.  My experiences have been with this one  mostly  and the one across from Central Mkt.  They pre fry their bacon and over cook the heck out of it.  I have tried both the bacon  egg and cheese  BEC   and  the sausage  egg and cheese  SEC .  I used to pop in around 0630 ish  opening time .  The BEC are lame.  The overcooked bacon really screws it up for this one.  The SEC are fairly decent and the guy is usually generous with the portion.  They both could use more cheese.  This chain has great potential.  My biggest problem with TS is the service.  The opening lady at this joint is a little freaky and quite rude.  Could be a medical condition  I dunno.  She is rarely on time and always in a pissy mood.  As for the other store  same rudeness.  Maybe their trying to do the Dicks thing    on the river walk in SA .  If so  they got it all wrong.  Maybe it s management and poor working conditions   At this point  I don t care.  I ditched them a long time ago.  If you re looking for something better  service and quality  hit the Monkey Nest   I ve recently discovered them and love them.  Let me add two more things.  Enchiladas Y  Mas kicks breakfast taco butt.  Unfortunately  they don t open until 0700.  As for the rudeness at TS  my friends at work agree.
Taco Shack,49,Unfortunately  I ve been to a few places than sell breakfast tacos assembly style.  Bacon egg  sausage egg ... cooking them separate than combining in the tortilla is just not the way to do it.  Having said that  I have NEVER had a chorizo egg taco cooked that way.  I was in shock when that was what I was handed.  Really   Chorizo  amp  egg cooked separately   I was VERY disappointed.  Won t go back to this location  nor probably any of their locations.
Taco Shack,50,In another life  or possibly a dream  I ate here and liked it. No  it was a dream  because I ate here today for lunch  I have never had breakfast here  so cant review  and I can honestly say I dont know why anyone would eat here. Literally flavorless soft tacos  1 ground beef  one carne guisada  and that was after 3 tiny containers of their red and green sauce  also flavorless. Rice and beans saved the meal  Heck no. There could not have been any seasoning get near a hundred yards of that rice or beans. Place was not especially clean  girl behind the counter fairly rude. Take this one off this list of going back to.
Taco Shack,51,Best all around breakfast taco place in town. The Shack Taco is hard to beat  yet so is a classic Bacon and Egg tago.
Taco Shack,52,I m not quite sure what is the deal with the Medical Parkway Taco Shack.  I would give it 3 stars  but the last experience was a 1 star affair.  So I m averaging here.  The last time I was hungry for a taco on the way back home from downtown.  I did not want to wait in line at Torchy s since it was too close to lunch time  and the Medical Shack beckoned to me.  Well I ordered  but apparently this gringo was not welcome.  I sat around for a bit  got my taco  but since I have worked fast food in my youth  I checked the bag.  Not my order.  Not my taco  so I walk back inside.  I said hey  I think I have the wrong taco  maybe someone else s order.  So they just kind of look at me.  So I repeated.  They kind of looked at me.  So I used my Spanish with a bit of cussing thrown in after they told me to just throw the old taco away.  The Spanish I know threw them off.  Yep  my dad is fluent.  So the long story of it is  I have not been back.  I go right around the corner instead to the Lamar location  or Mi Victoria or Torchy s.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,1,A coworker recommended this place for me and the best part is that they re on Uber eats so they have delivery    My go to order is a pound of meat with a pound of tortillas and that comes with salsas  cilantro  onions  and limes. I ve never been disappointed  food is AMAZING and the amount it s always right. The tortillas are perfect  if you want true good Mexican food this is it.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,2,Everything from the tortillas to the salsa to the chips to the meat oh my goodness the meat was so delicious  I will definitely recommend to friends and family  Love the specious combination in options to go and dine in   will visit again 10 10 for sure 
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,3,My manager at work is a Taco connoisseur. He highly recommended this restaurant and we went for lunch the other day. The restaurant was packed but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. I had the three street taco style fajitas. Came with beans  rice  a boiled red potato  cilantro and diced onions. The tacos were fantastic and seasoned well. They have that awesome green sauce that was spicy. Beans and Spanish rice was awesome too. I ll definitely go back.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,4,BEST.MENUDO.IN.TOWN   I order it thru ubereats.  Always packed well  huge portion  tastes great. No pozole in it  so low carb  too  
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,5,Ok I am going to start off with the bad  The Location is on the Eastside of I 35. Its not in the greatest of areas. So lock your door.  some one right in front of the door trying to sell you something out of their Ice chest. Get past this less then attractive exterior and I promise the food will have you driving back for more   Ok that is out of the way...  You will walkup and either order a plate by number or meat selections by pounds. Be prepared to Speak Spanish or say Su Hablo English  They will get someone to the register who can help you.  Fresh home made tortillas   Flour and Corn   They have Aguas Fresca    Flavored fruit water  Lots of different types of Tacos to choose from and plates.  Your Tacos are served with Jalepeno  celantro onion and lime all on side.  I ordered 2 Carnitas tacos they gave me enough meet in the 2 tacos with 4 tortillas  to make 6 Tacos. They gave you chile sauces which by the way are delicious especially enjoyed the orange red one This place is totally worth it and I would go back  My advice is order your food and take it to go to enjoy in your home  work or in your car.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,6,The customer services sucks bad. I was giving cold chips and my food came out a bit cold. I asked the waitress for warm chips and she told me that they have any.  But I have eaten here 3 or 4 times with my friends.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,7,Delicious fresh corn tortillas  carne al pastor  and beef fajitas  Green salsa is so yummy. Didn t give them 5 stars bc service was slow even though I was the only customer in the place.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,8,Great place to get fresh corn tortillas  A stack of 30 white corn tortillas is  2    The tortilleria is also a small taqueria with about a dozen dishes. There is a small dine-in area.   I got a carnitas gordita to-go and while it was good  I did want a little bit more seasoning on the pork.   If you want some chicharrones  this is the place  They have slabs of the stuff    Service was friendly and fast.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,9,Delicious tacos  I had two tacos de cabeza and one taco de pastor. Authentic Mexican taste and place was pretty clean  people were nice.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,10,Good food  good price  excellent service. I had the chicken milanese which is breaded chicken. Overall  good experience  I highly Recommended it.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,11,Love this place   Their food is amazing.  Everything I have tried from tacos to the mariscos.   Seafood . Eat here 
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,12,I don t know Spanish but I was able to order the food which was great and freshly prepared.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,13,The only reason I m giving it a two star rating instead of five is because they have pushy and judgmental beggers at their front door shaking their tin cup. The will ask you for money and when you say no  they will either say some smart remark right in your face or just give you the most disdainful look you ve ever gotten or sometimes they will just ask again. Am I missing something  How can the business allow this  Now that that has been said  the fajitas and guac are always on point. The food deserves five stars  the location zero.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,14,Their breakfast Tacos are awesome and you can get it whole day  you should try them.   This is very much local type.   If you like spicy  you should ask for verde sauce  my favorite
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,15,This review is only for a takeout order of their homemade tortilla chips. They are worth the drive to purchase  especially if you are planning a party. Fried on premises  their chips are stuffed in big bags and are a great value and taste great. Much better alternative to the fried-in-store chips you can get at HEB and Randalls.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,16,Pleasantly surprised at this place. Food was good  portions were large  and our waitress was polite. Are for two for less than twenty bucks. No complaints here.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,17,Their authentic  delicious Carnitas make this place an instant 5 Star. Their speed of service and customer service in general even to Spanish speakers like me  is a poor half star.   What I recommend is going in  grab a pound of Carnitas and enjoy them in the comfort of your home.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,18,Love coming to this place since I moved to Austin the only thing I dislike is the cashier in the tortilla section. She doesn t speak to you she doesn t acknowledge you or even welcome you she just has no kind of customer service. Person like that does not belong in the front of your business where she will be the first contact for anybody to walk into the door.  With customer service like that not being acknowledge not even when we order our items one really doesn t want to come back.  Me encanta venir a este lugar desde que me mov  para Austin.  Pero la cajera que tiene en el aria de las tortillas es muy fr a. No saluda a los clientes no les dicen nada cuando entran por la puerta alguien hacina no necesita estar enfrente sin ganas de no venir pa tras. Su negocio atrae a muchos clientes Pero cajeras hacina nom s no.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,19,My family  amp  I have been coming here for a while now and it s a nice  small restaurant. The environment is comfortable  amp  all the food is cooked from scratch  so it s always fresh. However  the wait is longer than one may want it to be  sometimes we wait for our food up to 30 minutes.  It gets really packed on the weekends  so service is a little slow  but besides that  it s delicious. I would personally recommend la barbacoa and the breakfast tacos  they are some of the best I ve had. The prices are very affordable  too.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,20,The above yelper took the words out of my mouth  Whether it be Chinese  Thai or Mexican  when a language barrier needs to be overcome while placing your order the probability for authentic  tasty eats is favorable.  I live and work near by so this has become my go-to spot for some real Mexican food. Today was my third visit so I am confident in their consistency. I have enjoyed the pork chili verde  grilled chicken and a burrito. They make all the tortillas in-house along with the sauces  chips and drinks. They also sell these staples in bags and tupperware at very good prices.  The prices range between  5 and  8 for a plate and I have never spent over  10 for a meal and drink. If you dont mind the location and are committed to seeking out good food for its own sake this should be on your list.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,21,Authentic. That is the word to describe this place. I got breakfast tacos on flour tortillas. The tortillas are perfect. Not too thin or too thin. The red salsa they have has amazing roasted flavor and is just the right amount of spicy. The employees all have smiles on their faces  are polite and helpful. The pricing on all the menu items are great  You can get a full meal for 10 bucks. You won t leave feeling like you got jipped on the portions either. There is a bit of a language barrier  but that is all part of the experience   
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,22,Food is great.. But services are horrible. The lady who took my order didn t speak no English and had trouble with my order. They ended up charging me extra for packs of tortillas. and that s not what I wanted. The girl in the front when I told her acted like she didn t care or even tried to help me. The guy in the back who handed me my food was a great help.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,23,I walked into this place this morning and it had a funky smell   as most whole in the wall places do on top of that the wait staff was not very courteous and did not speak one word of English  The food had lots and lots to be desired  and as if that wasn t enough. The man helping me weighed raw  bloody meat and then tried to weigh my barbacoa on the same scale without cleaning it. This place is absolutely disgusting     DO NOT EAT for your own safety 
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,24,This place is delicious  No the most inviting since it is primarily a tortilla factory and then the restaurant part was an afterthought.  So the restaurant feels a little cramped and when it s full or there are kids around it can be quite noisy   I am guessing capacity is the dining area is about 20 people and sometimes the clientele can be a little too blue collar.  In one particular instance I remember this one  tex-mex  hispanic  definitely not from Mexico but of Mexican American origins  speaking loudly to his friend and or on his blue tooth device and being incredibly vulgar   You could tell Spanish was not his first language but he was certainly trying  dropping all kinds of curse words in Spanish.  Nasty   The service is pretty decent  not slow at all but certainly not service with a smile.  Waitress  there s usually only one  is mostly if not completely Spanish-speaking so like others have said  this equates to authenticity   This is not Tex-Mex food.  And it is good   My girlfriend  Asian but loves Mexican food  loves the flautas  yes they are flautas  not rolled tacos or taquitos  there. They give you 4 to an order and they are fat and round   Filled with chunks of chicken  not shredded or  pulverized  chicken.  They are hearty and filling.  Tasty albeit a little too oily sometimes.  They don t skimp out on the meat nor the avocado that comes with the  side  salad.  I myself have grown fond of the Caldo de Res z.  Don t quite remember how they spell it as you can see plenty of typos on their menu...again  English is not the 1st language spoken here.  It is savory  not greasy  nearly boiling hot and perfect for one of those chilly winter days like we ve been getting here.  On a hot summer day I don t recommend it...yes it is still delicious but it ll have you sweating   Especially if you accompany it with a chile toreado.  Those suckers are hit or miss but they can have you in tears  Sabrosisimo   The caldo has carrot spears  potato  some cilantro  I think  and it comes with some Spanish rice that is just okay.  Just throw the rice into the caldo  it s better that way.  You get a side of warm tortillas and they don t skimp out on the tortillas   I think mine came with about 6 of them.  For caldo  go with the corn tortillas.  Flour would be a sin   Whenever in town I plan on going back.  Fingers crossed I don t have to share the small room with another  vato mofo dog ...whatever   People like that embarass me...I am Mexican American  just like him.  Still  give this place a try..despite the humble and cozy seating area  or the questionable neighborhood  or the only one way in and one way out parking lot  it s definitely good eating and worth it   La Sabrocita is worth it   Could it be better  Sure  But I ve yet to find one that IS better.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,25,I knew this place was going to make it when I walked in and absolutely nobody in the place spoke a lick of English   I mean  it s definitely tough to get any change or customization of your order across  but I absolutely love it   I like when my ethnic foods are taken or cooked by people that aren t necessarily of US origin.  Okay  moving on the moment you walk in  you re completely overwhelmed by the smell of braised  boiled  and fried MEATS.  Think of them as a pre-cooked carniceria  because they have a large array and assortment of pork  beef  chicken  and lamb that have been prepared in a multitude of ways.  From chichharrones  fried pork skin rinds  to barbacoa  prepared from three different types of beef   the list is really endless on meat fillings.  You ll also notice once you walk in that there is a list of lunch dinner entrees that span across the top of the wall.  SO MANY OPTIONS -- and most of them very familiar to other taquerias around Austin.  My favorite of the meats was probably the al pastor  and I enjoy ordering them in the burrito entree.  Their burritos  by the way  are moreso like rolled tacos  that are pan-grilled to a slight crisp.  The meal also comes with a side of beans and a side-salad.  Their green sauce reminds me of Pollo Rico s--definitely a good thing.  Lastly--and I probably should have mentioned this earlier--they have fresh tortillas that you can also buy in bulk.  Thus  the  tortilleria    You see them making the tortillas from scratch from a HUGE tortilla machine.  Looked to me like they also packaged these into boxes  probably to be distributed in stores or restaurants.  Overall--I d go back from time to time for a nice lunch.  I would rank them around or even slightly above your average taqueria.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,26,The food here is tasty but overpriced. The service was bad and they charged full price for the tea refills. No warning on this. The server constantly carried the food out with money in the same hand. The money was touching the plate. It was a horrible experience overall.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,27,Tortillas were pretty good  I mean  they should be.  The barbacoa was no bueno.  Would go back to get tortillas but thats it.
Tortilleria La Sabrocita,28,Great food and very nice people  just not that one would expected a tortarillia to have such good food. Advise you to read the menue and the specials on the walls as they are very well priced for the quality and quantity of food. Corn torts are king here but they do have flour. Their salsas are also very good. Service is only lacking if you dont speak spanish  but as I see it that equals more adventure especially knowing the quality will be good.
Taqueria el Torito,1,What a nice little discovery  In the parking lot of a tire shop along with 2 other little food trailers  it s a little family-owned business with a couple of picnic tables. Dine  in  or get to go. Cash only.  I had a carne guisada and a beef taco on corn. The corn tortillas are clearly handmade  warm and hearty. Delicious   The tacos were amply filled and topped with cilantro and onion although you could choose lettuce and tomato. Hot red salsa  Green not as hot but still hot. Served with a bit of lime to squeeze.  They have a number of other items as well and a cooler in front with various beverages. They have at least one agua fresca that changes daily.  Inexpensive  quick  convenient - everything that a food trailer should be. Nothing over about  5.  See hours from the owner in the comments.  Recommended.
Taqueria el Torito,2,One of my favorite taco stand the homemade tortillas reminds me of my home town in Mexico. Great service never disappointed me
Taqueria el Torito,3,Recently started going to this place and WOW is the food great  All the tacos I ve tried are delicious and they have THE BEST corn tortillas I ve ever had. Normally I m not a big fan of corn but they make these by hand and they re the  meatiest   tastiest tortillas I ve ever eaten. If you get the sope  a kind of open face taco with more filling  they ll put it on an extra thick tortilla.  They make three kinds of salsa  red  green  and asadera  I think that s the name . Haven t tried the green but the red is delicious and pretty hot. So far my favorite is the asadera which is a little chunkier with a bit of a kick.  The place is owned by two women  mother and daughter  and they re super sweet. They accept call-in orders and I recommend you call ahead.   It s located in the parking lot of the Kwick In convenience store  next to the Wells Fargo bank.  They don t have a website but can be found on Facebook   a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.facebook.com 2Feltorito2016 2F amp s efa3093e45344272a08430435adf267e8c24b13df533849a5f027a138695ef2d  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  facebook.com eltorito2016  a 
Taqueria el Torito,4,Amazing for a food truck  I actually believe they are a bit underpriced cause their food is so savory and their service is excellent  We went for breakfast and got the gorditas. They are big and so filling  Not to mention the amazing flavor  A definite win in my book  And their aguas frescas are delicious  Also  the lady that took our order was friendly  courteous and attentive to our needs. I would definitely be back 
Taqueria el Torito,5,I was surprised by the quality of food  Definitely a jewel  I ordered a Gordita and Torta with fries  I didn t expect much of quality since my total was only  12. With the first look at my food I realized I was In for a treat  The food was delicious and the portions are definitely bigger than most taco stands  Will definitely be coming back here 
Taqueria el Torito,6,Very delicious tacos and friendly service located in the parking lot of the  Kwick Mart.  Try the Puerco verde taco  I will definitely be returning 
El Vago Cantina,1,Best food and drinks. The service is great. It s rare that you find a place that checks all the boxes  but this is it. Highly recommend
El Vago Cantina,2,This place....   Is it a restaurant  Is it a discoteca  Is it the new neighborhood watch spot for the Mexico national football team   It s all great whatever identity it takes. Ordered some Birria Tacos with a large consume.  I suggest ordering the small  large was huge  Quick service and friendly smiles all around. I arrived at on off-peak time of 2 15pm with only a handful of others around. Looking forward to seeing how their HH crowd is   I ll be the Gringo posted up at the bar with my laptop  while trying to not make a mess by dipping the Birria into it s glorious broth  and I m perfectly fine with that.  Enjoy 
El Vago Cantina,3,Went to this place because of the food reviews. The vibe of this place was nice  I loved the neon signs and the place was very aesthetically pleasing and super instagram worthy  We had fun snapping some pics.  We ordered the birria ramen  an aguachile and Two micheladas. Overall we were satisfied with our food and the service time as well. Our waitress was pleasant but did minimal checking in which was strange because there were only 4 other tables and a couple more waitresses.However  we didn t take offense to this and didn t mind not being bothered. We didn t see a bartender at the bar so we didn t bother ordering any more drinks. The chips were not my favorite but I think that has to do more with the type of tortilla and it was just not for me.
El Vago Cantina,4,This was our first visit to El Vago Cantina  My husband and ordered their Birria de Res Tacos  Red Taco   It was absolutely delicious  It looked great but it definitely was not what I was expecting.  From other pictures I ve seen  there s supposed to be a red color to it. Ours had absolutely no redness. We then requested the sauce  consome broth . The broth is an additional charge of  3. This also had no redness to it.  The menu prices also showed  3.50 per Birria de Res taco. Instead the final bill came out to  4.50 per taco and it was listed as a Quesataco on the receipt.  In retrospect review it seems the waitress gave us the incorrect items that we ordered which is why it wasn t what we expected. My husband is a fluent Spanish speaker and placed our order in Spanish. So the order mishap isn t due to a language barrier. It also can t be due to being busy as there was only one other table.  I typically don t drink anything but water when I eat out. To my surprise  when I asked for water  I get a bottled water which is then charged at  1. I mean that s not expensive for water  but most places offer iced tap water at no extra charge.  If you re paying by card  one thing to know  there is a credit card processing fee added to the bill.  Overall the food tasted great  I was just disappointed in the price difference and what I ordered vs what I got.  I would definitely recommend trying this place as the food was indeed delicious   I hope next time I visit my experience will be better 
El Vago Cantina,5,Delicious and authentic food. Good amount of seats. Great drink selection   Very dark interior with red lighting--would be interested to visit it in the day.   Few options on the menu for vegetarians  but I m sure you can order a cheese enchilada or something with beans instead of meat.
El Vago Cantina,6,I promise this is a Restaurant you want to visit  Great Taco Restaurant and the staff are super friendly. Always great food  never disappoints.    Definitely recommend
El Vago Cantina,7,The food is really great  some of the best tacos in Austin.  But... I arrived there 30 minutes before closing  took a trip from Georgetown which is about a 40 minute drive. The restaurant was open but the waitress said the grill was closed and I could not order anything.  I spent my gas and time. If your schedule says you re open until a certain time  you can t close 30 minutes early.   So what time do you stop serving food  If I come again  will the grill be closed at an arbitrary time  You should display that you actually close earlier so I won t waste my time and gas.
El Vago Cantina,8,The drinks are delicious  the birria tacos are delicious but I recommend that they only give you lemon  cilantro and onion as a side because they give you a slice of cucumber and a slice of radish but just a little bit is like it s not nice Look  the Aguachile had no guacamole and since they didn t have just a few avocado slides  the waitress took too long to bring our drinks to the table and brought them in parts   She took a long time to ask us if we wanted to order something else  I think they need people with more experience to serve the customer   she was not good at serving us but we still left a tip 
El Vago Cantina,9,We had high hopes for El Vago as it is close to the house...we have been on a Birria taco quest since last year when they exploded on the ATX food scene  and we have been to quit a few and have a lot more to go. Arrived just a bit after 11...most of the lights were still off and the tables pushed together...weren t even sure they were open...we walked to the counter and was greeted by a friendly face...at this point I assumed they didn t have serving staff...which was cool...we placed our order for a total of 4 Birria tacos  Queso and Beans and rice...as we sat and waited for our food other people strolled in and were greeted by a waitress and seated ...Along with being seated they also received chips and salsa  which we were never offered...when the Queso landed  the chips were a unique shape and were fresh and crunchy...The Queso was not the creamy golden goodness we have partaken in at the 150  Mexican joints we have hit in Austin..this was nothing more then Ricos cheese sauce...sorry  you can t call that Queso in our eyes..needless to say it didn t get finished..a first for use...and when we ordered it was for one small Queso for  6...and we were charged for 2...when we tried to explain she told us they put both of them in one dish...so we paid  12 for 2 small Quesos when a large is just  10  ...there was a bit of a language barrier and it wasn t worth the effort. Now the bottled sauces were great ...The Birria Tacos had great flavor  but no consome ...you have to order it separately...another first for us as every other place it s offered with the meal...like I said the flavor was good  but the meat was fatty with not much chew..similar to the texture of the fatty part of brisket..which soaked into the tortilla and took the crispy griddled crispness away...as for the Beans and Rice...Rice was the star of the meal  light  fresh and tasted great...Overall the experience just didn t do it for us.
El Vago Cantina,10,Great place  lots of good food. They have a lot of drinks for adults and kids. Nice music. A lot of TV . Clean place and clean restrooms too. Highly recommend El Vago      
El Vago Cantina,11,This popped up as a new place to try yesterday and coincidentally a friend wanted Birria yesterday and mentioned this place. We decided to check it out. Wow  The food and drinks were amazing  We ordered the ceviche  queso flameado  Birria tacos and the queso Birria dipped in red sauce with a side of consomm . It was TDF. The consomm  was so flavorful and had the perfect amount of cinnamon. The drinks were also fabulous. I highly recommend El Vago. I can t wait to go again.
El Vago Cantina,12,Took my family with me to this place  I live about 5 minutes  been wanting to try it and today was the day. I will definitely come again at least once a week. I m serious  this place is so goddamn good  I want to try other dishes  aside from the food the michelada I got was good as hell. Environment I can tell it gets good at night  but during the day it s just as good  calmer. Owner and staff very friendly  shout-out to Jose thank you for your hard work and good ass food. Keep it up man. 5 stars  
El Vago Cantina,13,Came in not knowing what to expect after seeing a michelada sign outside. Michelada and Cantarito that I tried were great and the bartender Daisy was great and attentive the whole time. She recommended the pastor tacos which were great and made sure we were never sitting on an empty drink. Food is one thing but service is what it s about.
El Vago Cantina,14,Daisy is an amazing bartender to me.  She has been attentive  energetic  fun  funny and all around helpful lady. The food was great  and the music kept the energy up 10 10 would come again.
El Vago Cantina,15,Wish I could give this place more stars  Extremely friendly and welcoming owner and staff. The food  music and overall vibe is A-1  I will most definitely come back with my family.
El Vago Cantina,16,Nice enough setup but that is pretty much it. SERVICE-  The service is a let down. Walked in no one greets or seats us. We take a table on the patio  no one comes out for 15 mins. I find the waitress and she comes out. We try to order but she does not speak enough English for us to do so and has to go get someone. After a fairly long wait one of our entrees comes out  missing the queso on it which is brought out a few min later . I get to watch my wife eat while I still have no food. Halfway through her entree I think maybe they didn t get my order  I find someone  because no one checked on us since the food  and say where is my food while pantomiming to make sure she gets what I am asking. She says  still coming  and points to an uncooked burrito by the grill. Finally it comes to the table and I start to eat. After a few bites I realize that the service was to prepare me for the disappointment to come.  FOOD- Beans  out of a can  flavorless  like paste Queso  out of a can  an unnatural orange that reminded me of school cafeteria  cheese  or carnival nachos Chips  stale  possibly made here  Looked like tortilla cut up and fried in strips  Salsa  was great  fresh and flavorful  Meat  this was the worst part  the beef fajita  the upgrade from ground beef  was tiny little slivers that had no flavor and were about 50  inedible. Mostly fat and gristle  some hard cartilage that I had to spit out.  DRINKS- Drinks were ok  menu doesn t tell you everything that it comes with  price was ok  and flavor was great. Not very strong  I assume it had alcohol in it but could not tell and based on the quality of the food ingredients  I am sure it is the shelf underneath the bottom shelf but did not see them make it nor is it called out . I drank two large margaritas and did not get even a light buzz.  I paid and let the cashier know that the food quality was poor and she listened to it and said  ok  No manager  no anything really other than ok and a frown.  The expected end to an expectedly disappointing lunch. I had high hopes for what could be a cool spot.
El Vago Cantina,17,I live nearby and was really hopeful to find a good tex mex taco place nearby that I could drop in on. It is somewhat of a hole in the wall feel  there s a drive through and patio seating. There was one waitress working the restaurant who only spoke Spanish I think  she was hustling and although there was not many tables seated  4 tables    service was as a result  pretty slow. We requested water and did not receive any the entire meal. Our flavored margaritas were pretty sweet and tasted like syrup. I ordered the birria tacos after noticing the positive reviews - the consume  extra add on  was watered down  the tacos were fine but I wouldn t say there was the pronounced magical mix of flavors typical with birria tacos. I added rice beans for an up charge and only received the beans. The refried beans did not seem seasoned  very earthy. The mixed fajitas my friend ordered was overall tasty but the meat  steak  chicken  was smaller bite sized bits  which I think speaks to the quality. The shrimp on the fajitas were big and cooked nicely. And then  we were given plastic utensils to eat with. I was pretty disappointed.
El Vago Cantina,18,Good food definitely     The service I guess is somewhat ok not too bad.  We will be returning for sure 
El Vago Cantina,19,This place was such a vibe  I m only disappointed I found it on my last day in Austin  but I ll definitely be back  Good food  drinks  and music  Plus so many cute spots to take pics 
El Vago Cantina,20,Really good authentic food. I had the queso birra tacos and they were delicious  Staff was also super friendly.
El Vago Cantina,21,Man the good is really good I would recommend the shrimp quesadilla the horchata is my favorite overall a good spot lol I
El Vago Cantina,22,What a great place  with GREAT food service. Daisy is amazing and took wonderful care of us. Go daisy go     
El Vago Cantina,23,Just a heads up this place was Micheladas before and changed the name. I went to check out the specials for national margarita day  which was advertised for 2.22 . Deal you can t beat  Ordered one then asked for another one and she came back with a different drink that was  10    Not what I asked for  Also ordered a queso dip that wasn t even queso but melted taco cheese and was told to eat with a tortilla. Queso is meant to eat with a chip Sorry but I will not be returning.
El Vago Cantina,24,I saw an ad on FB about this restaurant  I thought it looked fun and a good place to hang out and have some drinks. I was excited for the patio area but it turns out it s just a small spot next to the parking lot. My first time here  I ordered some tacos and I was surprised the tortillas were hand-made. They were really good and authentic. I was not surprised to pay  3 for a small taco. The second time  the whole place had changed and no more hand made tortillas. The tacos are expensive and overall the food is really overpriced. I had some drinks and they really disappointed. I paid  18 for three small cups with cheap vodka. The drinks are not good at all. They advertise them as if they are bigger than what they really are. When I was there  there was only one other couple in the restaurant. Really disappointed with this restaurant. It s overpriced  and overrated.
El Vago Cantina,25,Fish tacos fresh and unique. We liked them with cucumbers and radishes instead of lettuce and tomato. Shrimp Mexicans was good. Think we ll go back.
El Vago Cantina,26,Delicious queso birria tacos and consome  Can t wait to come in and try the bar drinks 
Jasmine's Restaurant,1,Airline pilot recommended.  Great local spot for some really good tex-mex. Rustic local spot- just outside the airport- with some great happy hour deals for margaritas.
Jasmine's Restaurant,2,My family and I stopped in based on the reviews.  However  we were fairly disappointed.   The food was much more than expected and it wasn t all that good.    Service was scarce leaving us with empty cups and chip and salsa bowls when there was only one other table occupied.
Jasmine's Restaurant,3,If I could give this place 10 stars I would. From the looks of the outside I prob wouldn t have stopped. In my 70 years of dining I ve never had a better chili relleno it was fantastic. Will b back
Jasmine's Restaurant,4,Great margaritas. Great queso. Stopped in and the staff is super friendly. Highly recommend.
Jasmine's Restaurant,5,Ignore what it looks like outside. You will be rewarded once inside  with deliciousness. We had amazing green and red chilaquiles. Where has this been all my life  They had better than average salsa for the chips bought to the table and excellent coffee.
Jasmine's Restaurant,6,Love this place. The food is amazing.   Today I ordered shrimp a la diabla  the meal  not the appetizer. But they gave the appetizer. Not great  but I understand  mistakes happen. But when I called to let them know they told me that dish doesn t exist    It s right there in the right corner    I had that dish last Saturday.  Of course I will eat there again. But please don t tell me the dish doesn t exist when I ate it last Saturday and it s listed in the menu.Shrimp Diablo So  be careful so this doesn t happen to you  
Jasmine's Restaurant,7,Food is mediocre. Went in and ordered a chimichanga  the menu clearly states that it s stuffed with ground beef for 10.99. I was charged 12.99 which is the up charge for fajita meat. When I questioned it I was told that it was 2.00 to add any meat. It came with no rice and beans. The food isn t worth being given the run around. Not the 1st time I ve had a discrepancy in prices.
Jasmine's Restaurant,8,Was waiting for our flight looking for some breakfast  don t let the outside of the restaurant fool you  quickly seated and attended. Food was great highly recommend the chilaquiles in salsa verde  hands down the best Iv ever had. Defiantly recommend you won t be disappointed.
Jasmine's Restaurant,9,This place provides everything you need in an authentic Tex-Mex establishment. And with it being so close to the airport  it s extremely convenient.  We walked in with masks and were greeted so kindly. We chose our own table. The lunch specials were delicious. My carne guisada was tender and bold. The tortillas were also delicious. We all easily ordered with the friendly staff. The salsa was homemade and tasty.   I felt safe here during Covid. And I felt welcomed. If you are coming from the airport  and need a great place for lunch  Jasmines is perfect. This place welcomed me back to Texas in the best way.
Jasmine's Restaurant,10,I ve been to Austin a few times and I m always looking for good Mexican food....not just Tex-Mex. I found Jasmine s right here on Yelp and wanted to give it a shot. I am so glad I did  I got a sangria margarita  which was sooo good. I also ordered the mol  poblano and it didn t disappoint. The mol  was so flavorful and the plate was filling. The service here is also great. This restaurant is located really close to the airport so I will definitely be stopping by the next time I come into town.
Jasmine's Restaurant,11,We stopped in to eat while waiting on incoming flight. It was the middle of the afternoon so there were just 2 tables being served. Food tasted great  was hot and served quickly. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Overall great experience.
Jasmine's Restaurant,12,Local  the best   If you are at an airport hotel  walk over or get the hotel to bring you   I have visited multiple occasions and food is always freshly prepared-salsa and chips free and wonderful 
Jasmine's Restaurant,13,Ok it s been a good while since I been back my yelpers   so this morning I decided to stop for breakfast and discovered this little hole in the wall . First thing I noticed of this business is they run warm inside and I personally don t  like eating in a hot atmosphere  I already do at work . Fast forwarding to the food  the quality is ok I ve had better from other taquerias. I ordered the migas with cheese and asked for homemade tortillas and when I opened them to re heated tortillas I  was disappointed. My co pilot ordered chilaquiles and received his order about 13 minutes later with his eggs still on back order. Not bashing this place but a little of tightening up will definitely be the key for a successful review next time. Hope this helps out community  thanks for reading .
Jasmine's Restaurant,14,Just landed in Austin TX  drove out from the airport and saw it -  Love those places     Local Mexican restaurant  Fresh     And good food
Jasmine's Restaurant,15,Hole in the wall joint that you wouldn t look at twice if you were passing by however this was truly some of the most authentic and tasteful Mexican food I ve had in years. None of the Mexican restaurants I have been to since have come close to how good the food was here. Absolute A  rating 
Jasmine's Restaurant,16,Jasmine s is what you could call an almost  hole in the wall   a stones throw away from Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.   Food  There s a variety of options  but this review is focused on breakfast. The huevos rancheros  specifically. Eggs were cooked to a perfect sunny side up  refried beans were plenty and delicious  and the ranchero sauce had a nice deep flavor to it - not too spicy  and not too watery. Our waitress was kind enough to indulge us with an extra egg and extra beans in lieu of potatoes and tortillas  yes  we are those people .   Service  Friendly and warm. You ll seat yourself  but they are quick to bring out a menu and get your beverage orders. Drinks are consistently refilled without ever raising a hand.   Cost  Two huevos rancheros with sausage  a coffee  and an ice tea cost  24 after tax. Really can t beat that.   Overall  There s parking outside  A C  it s clean and welcoming  they take credit cards  and if you re headed to the airport  it s well-located for a meal before you check-in.
Jasmine's Restaurant,17,Tasty food and friendly people. Our meal was quick and hot and ready to go.  Had the Chile relleno and fixings.  Good flavor and not too greasy.
Jasmine's Restaurant,18,When you get their fajatis  you get 2 small tortillas. Simply inadequate amount of tortillas. Then they charge you  1.75 for each addition request of 2 more tortillas. Their food is expensive  was bland tasting  and then they don t give you enough tortillas and charge you even more. Also the service is very slow. Waited 30 minutes to place an order. Had to wait 10 minutes to get more tortillas. My food went cold while waiting. Had to ask waiter 3 times to bring me the tortillas. The place wasn t even that busy so service should have been better.
Jasmine's Restaurant,19,This is well overdue. I am a born  amp  raised Austinite  and have tried just about every place along my life with my family. My mom always has underlined the importance of true Tex-Mex food. ESPECIALLY  the cheese enchilada. Any true Texan can detest that the value of a cheese enchilada is unparalleled. I have visited this spot on occasion when I m in town with my parents and let me just say- The KINDEST employees always willing to give you a friendly hello and amazing service throughout. Their frozen margarita is TOP NOTCH. I am a margarita connoisseur  amp  THIS is the best place to get an amazing frozen marg. The authenticity  Jasmine s offers the most authentic - hole-in-the wall  Mexican experience. I will NEVER turn down a dining experience here  they truly have gotten everything right.
Jasmine's Restaurant,20,This place was absolutely delicious. We were trying to find a place to eat on the way back from Houston and most of the places were closed or not on our route. This was honestly one of the best places we have ate during our vacation. Their salsa was absolutely amazing and actually flavored unlike other places we have been. Their cocktails are amazing  it had a great atmosphere  the food came out quick and it was a great stop for the children who were tired of being stuck in a vehicle. This will be a place we stop at on our next vacation.
Jasmine's Restaurant,21,DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS RESTAURANT  it s easy to pass right by it but the food here is too good  shout out to the nice ladies working hard to sever warm delicious meals  Support Latino owned businesses  juntos sumos mejor  P.s the tortillas here are one of the best
Jasmine's Restaurant,22,Their food is good  and I would typically give four stars. However  I would caution against dining in or ordering for pick up if you are on a tight schedule. Ordered ahead for pick up because I was limited on time.  I was told the order would be ready in 15 mins  which was perfect timing for me to get there  pick up  and be on my way. When I got there  the kitchen was behind and had a large to-go order that was still being fulfilled when I got there.  I was told it would be just a few more minutes  and that turned into 15.  I had a scheduled appointment that this caused me to be late for and it was cancelled. It could not be rescheduled until later this week. I probably would not have been as upset if someone bothered to update me  but I had to flag someone down and ask them to cancel my order due to my time crunch before I was told my order was about to be bagged up. I would give a 3.5  but since I can t  this was closer to a 3 star experience than a 4.
Jasmine's Restaurant,23,Do yourself a favor and stop for a marg and good  They outside might not be what your expecting but don t be mistaken   Chicken enchiladas and frozen margs were amazing  Also enjoyed the chips and spicy salsa 
Jasmine's Restaurant,24,Great family Mexican restaurant.  Read the specials board  the Tamales are excellent but not on the normal menu.  Good honest food at a fair price but nothing fancy.
Jasmine's Restaurant,25,Cold rainy day   Jasmine s Caldo De Res   satisfaction. I also ate the bacon wrapped shrimp.  The food is off the chart delicious. The waiting staff were attentive and sweet and never let my cup get remotely close to empty.  A definite must if ever in Austin Texas. The best part is that if you fly in or out the location is convenient and extremely clean.   Mi Encanta Jasmine s Restaurant   QUE RICO  I will be back  
Jasmine's Restaurant,26,We had a quick trip to Austin and found this delicious restaurant. We ate breakfast and the Huevos rancheros was great. The tortillas were out of this world. My husband ordered the mechacada with a side of nopal and loved it. The service was fast and efficient. Very nice staff.
Jasmine's Restaurant,27,I had ordered my meal to go so come to find when I got home to eat my shrimp weren t cleaned and I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to it 
Jasmine's Restaurant,28,Come on in  The food was GREAT  the service friendly and I m all for supporting local. Don t let the outside steer you away. Obviously a family run business and we wish them much success.
Jasmine's Restaurant,29,A seemingly hole-in-the-wall restaurant  this place is a gem  It s walking distance from Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and despite its run-down exterior  the interior isn t bad and the food is actually pretty good. I decided to give this place a try since it was close to the airport and the yelp reviews were excellent  I had a reservation for a rental car which I had to wait for  so this was perfect.   My wife tried the chicken fajita taco and the pork tomales with verde sauce. She absolutely loved the tomales. The chicken fajitas were okay apparently. According to her  the chicken was moist but didn t have much flavor.   I got the Huevos Rancheros with Guisada  basically beef stew  and it was really good. The potato side that came with it  however  was cold and tasteless.   The best part of the whole experience was the customer service  Our waitress was very attentive to detail and constantly refilled our waters and coffee. She was very patient in answering any questions we had and overall very pleasant 
Jasmine's Restaurant,30,Great food the mole enchiladas were exquisite.Great customer service. Good food  served in a timely manner.My order was exactly as I asked for  Being dairy and gluten free  this is a big deal not to have to wait to have my food redone.
Jasmine's Restaurant,31,Jasmines looks like it s gonna be very authentic Mexican but it is more gringo style Tex mex. It s casual inside and mildly dive bar like but that s always fine by me.  Service was prompt and friendly.. the salsa that comes with the chips was my favorite part of the meal. As it was tasty and a bit spicy. I ordered the 3 taco plate. Asked for chicken but they brought be beef instead. Was not in the mood to point it out or complain so I just ate the beef ones. They were just your normal whitey hard shell taco. The beans were pretty dang good though. Nothing about this place will blow your socks off but it s decent.
Jasmine's Restaurant,32,Amazing salsa  I had veggie flautas as well - they were great. The service was really good too. Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful
Jasmine's Restaurant,33,Don t let the outside impression impact your choice of where to eat. It might seem small on the outside but there is nothing insignificant on the inside. The relatively small scale abode allows them to cater to their guests with the most satisfactory of service. Weather your in for a special lunch  or simply a quick bite. This restaurant is perfect for anyone. Hot food  made quick  and fresh. I am not one to like the beans at Mexican restaurants  but these where some of my favorite I ve tried even compared to homemade ones. Definitely let this place be one of your stops after a long flight  or leaving the McKinney Falls State Park  or even just passing along the way. With such hospitality I didn t even realize I was hundreds of miles from home. A true testament to Texas hospitality. I will be eating here again whenever I pass through Austin.
Jasmine's Restaurant,34,We heard about this place through our rental car agent  said it s a locals spot so we decided to check it out. Great fast service. The food was quite yummy and everything is authentic. There salsa is awesome  if you like spicy then you ll love it. We ordered the huevos rancheros and Barbaqoa plato. It s very affordable and worth the trip.
Jasmine's Restaurant,35,We stopped in to get a good takeout meal before heading to the airport. The staff was friendly and the meal was delicious  I had the tilapia plate and my husband had two crispy tacos with rice and beans. It was all good  even out of a styrofoam plate in the waiting area.
Jasmine's Restaurant,36,The eggs  amp  tortillas were decent but I had called in ensuring that my taco orders dont come with American cheese but Cheddar instead as Im basically allergic to how American is processed - I get severe headaches. I pick up the tacos feeling excited as its my first time trying this place out and yet as Im on the road  I had to discover that the tacos all had American cheese. What the hell  Only one other customer was at the restaurant so not sure what their excuse for this is. Cant say I d be able to feel comfortable about returning now that a headache is already forming after a bite of that taco. Appreciate this kind of start to our moving day  Jasmine.
Jasmine's Restaurant,37,The reviews are spot-on. The exterior is horrible. We were  like  OMG  really Yelp    There were a couple shady characters that walked by  too  and we are like  where the hell are we     To our satisfaction  the food is good  the menu had a ton of choices  the service was great and super friendly  the iced tea was excellent  I know that s a strange comment  but it was   and the salsa was delish.  It s very quaint and welcoming and clean inside. Our tummies are full and we are satisfied. There s NOTHING around the airport  and this place is a hidden gem 
Jasmine's Restaurant,38,Really good food for a really good price. I really enjoyed the enchiladas and my margarita was pretty tasty as well. I don t know that I would drive out of my way to go here but it was a cute little stop just outside the airport if you re hungry when you get in and looking for some decent Mexican.
Jasmine's Restaurant,39,Ambiance - looks like an old derelict building that has seen better days.  It is right across the highway from the airport so you see it as soon as you leave.  The vibe is very dive  doesnt look like much on the outside but pretty neat place.  The interior is very basic tables and chairs and has all the standard decors and colors you see at most Mexican food places. This building has been here awhile but they make the interior work well.  Very vibrant and beautiful colors and decor.   Menu - well it is a Mexican food place  so the menu is what you would expect. They actually have a pretty big menu and offer a lot of variety within each category.  They hit all the basics of taco salads  fajitas  enchiladas  dinner plates and so on.  I was actually quite impressed with the selection of entrees as to be honest i thought this place would only have a few things to choose from.  But i was wrong. They did have some of their own signature items which is always a good sign for a store. The one thing about the actual physical menu was that the words were printed in a very elaborate cursive that made it kind of hard to read. I m no illiterate mo-ron  but i actually had to read some things 2 or 3 times to find out what it said.  But other than that the menu is really solid with lots to offer and a really nice variety.   Service - our service was super cute and homey.  We were greeted and sat by an older Hispanic lady who was all smiles.  We had gotten there a little after opening so we were the only ones there.  But i could tell see was sincere in her personality.  There were some other Hispanic ladies working and they all seemed really friendly. Our waitress in particular had the whole broken English or English second language going on.  For me that s a good sign as it normally means the food is more authentic or at least better than most.  I still cant get over how see was all smiles like that  like someone had sewn her mouth corners to her ears.  Anyways  she was really sweet and it felt more like being in a friends house rather that a store.  So props for genuine and inviting service.    Food - I came in with my family and wife to make a party of 6.  Ultimately thou between the 6 of use we only got 3 entrees.  My parents both got a taco salad  my wife and mother in law both got a black bean nacho dish  and my sister and I both got the enchilada trio.  My parents taco salad was pretty average like anywhere you would.  But the one thing about it that was great was the beef.  The beef was actually really good  seasoned well and cooked properly. It was dry or overly moist.  It also didnt have that widely use flavor that tastes like it came from a bag of Ortega or El Paso seasoning.  It was its own nice flavor.  Really good.  My wife and mother in laws nachos where pretty good too.  It was mostly just a few tortillas cut in 4ths and then fried and with the toppings poured on.  They both also asked for chicken fajita meat on top which it doesnt come with.  But when it came out it looked really funny and kind of lame.  Each nacho had 1 slice of chicken on it.  LOL.  But it is what it is.  I liked these nachos still thou because it was a different take on nachos.  Most nachos are cheese  gauc  and some protein or any subset of items.  But i really enjoyed the black beans and cheese and other toppings on this.  The chicken was also pretty good  had a nice flavor but leaned a little on the overcooked side  so it was just a tad dry. But overall the nachos was a nice change of pace.  I always get an enchilada plate when i try a new Mexican food restaurant. Because it you cant make good enchiladas  then you probably cant do anything right.  I got the Trio which was a green chile chicken  a cheese  and a spinach enchilada.  The addition of a spinach one instead of a beef  like most places do  was a interesting take and very rewarding.  The first one i ate was the cheese.  Pretty basic  cheese and tortilla.  The cheese was good but it didnt have very much cheese on the inside as it came out pretty flaccid.  The green chile chicken was pretty decent as well.  The sauce was really good  had a great flavor and some mild kick.  I really liked their green chile sauce.  The chicken was overcooked thou  as it was impossible to cut into bites.  So i basically ate the chicken first and then the tortilla with sauce. The chicken tasted fine but it was just pretty dry that even a knife had trouble cutting thru.  But i still enjoyed the sauce. Now for me the best one was the spinach enchilada.  It was a basic like of ingredients  spinach  tomato and cheese.  But it packed a great amount of flavor and spices.  It had a great fresh taste and lots of deliciousness. So overall  the food was pretty good  a few downfalls but thats like most places.  Overall - I really enjoyed our service and the food.  It doenst look like much on the outside but it was definitely a gem. And the fact that we were the only white people in there  was also a good sign.
Jasmine's Restaurant,40,Delicious  We ordered carryout  friendly staff. We had the taco salad with chicken fajita meat  amp  the chimichanga with beef fajita meat. Very good and nice portions.
Jasmine's Restaurant,41,Great food at great prices  My daughter and I had breakfast and it was all good  Their menu has some great Mexican dishes advertised and I can t wait to come back and try some of these as well    I definitely will be back  Sorry Arnold Schwarzenegger but I just had too 
Jasmine's Restaurant,42,I recently moved up the road from Jasmine s and despite there not being many restaurants or different food options around  I am absolutely fine with that because this place is amazing  They have the most authentic Tex-Mex in Central Austin that I ve had and they have a large menu so I m excited to try more. I had the Mole Poblano and it was spectacular and some of the best mole I ve had in the country  Can t wait to try more menu items soon.
Jasmine's Restaurant,43,This was a really great find on our way to the airport  Very friendly staff and delicious inexpensive meals  I had the Caldo de pollo and chicken pieces were large and full of flavor - soup was quite tasty  Rest of the party had their specials - lots of food for very little   
Jasmine's Restaurant,44,Really really good food  we had the fajitas mixed for 2. Plenty of food we did not eat it all. It is served with of course chicken and beef strips on a sizzling plate full of onions and bell peppers. Each person is given a plate that comes with shredded cheese  sour cream  guacamole  small salad  rice and refried beans but we requested charro beans. Everything was full of flavor. We also had the happy hour on the rocks margaritas reallllly good. The prices are very reasonable.
Jasmine's Restaurant,45,Was looking for a good place for lunch near my hotel  Hilton Austin Airport .  I have no vehicle on this trip and could see Jasmine s Restaurant across the highway.  Thus I figured I d take a walk and try out this joint.  10 minutes later I was in front of Jasmine s.  Place looks like a dive from outside.  I was leery to enter  however  figured it had to be good as Yelpers have given them 4 stars.  Once inside I realized this is a cozy Mexican Mom and Pop place with a wonderful vibe.  The gentleman whom helped me was super nice  most helpful.  They probably need to spend a couple of bucks on the exterior d cor as it may frighten some away.  Inside is awesome but you need people to walk in  right   I was in the mood for a crispy Tex Mex taco salad today.  I opted for the ground beef.  It was very good  decent sized portion which hit the spot.  It was a 4 star salad no doubt.  Price was dirt cheap.  Lunch was  7.56.  Impossible to get a good meal for this kind of money today.  I shall definitely return to Jasmine s Restaurant.
Jasmine's Restaurant,46,Excellent. Does not look like much but great food and great service   Good prices too we even had a celebrity sighting.  Very excited.  So good. Go you won t regret it.
Jasmine's Restaurant,47,The service was absolutely phenomenal    Such a cute little place with such delicious food. Came here to eat before catching my flights and was extremely pleased and would highly recommend 
Jasmine's Restaurant,48,So good   Impressive vegetarian options.  The cauliflower tortillas was amazing. Can t wait to bring the family.
Jasmine's Restaurant,49,What a great little restaurant  The chips and salsa were very good. I had the Enchiladas Fajita and was upstanding. My friend had the chicken soup and said it was good.
Jasmine's Restaurant,50,Driving down 130 by Austin with the family about to starve.  I look this up and decided to give it a try. Yes it looks sketchy from the outside but on the inside really authentic Mexican. And I must say the Mojitos   because they had mint   are really good. I got Mariscos Diablo   shrimp in spicy  aiolesauce. Kids got lunch specials and grandma got soup. Delicious.  Really homemade authentic taste my shrimp are so spicy they were great grandma soup tasted like she made it it was so good. Rice good.  I like mine mushy but my son loved it.  We had the thres Leches and the bolios for dessert. Bolios ok but the 3 leches creamy good. I would have taken a picture of dessert but the kids ate ate it before i could.
Jasmine's Restaurant,51,Service was good  overpriced for what you get. A small cup of shitty ball park queso was  6. The nachos were dry and underwhelming for  12. Shrimp Diablo was good and was fairly priced but overall wouldn t pay money for it again.
Jasmine's Restaurant,52,What a delightful surprise of a find on our way to Austin 360  They had us a chips and salsa  Much cleaner than its shell  would highly recommend 
Jasmine's Restaurant,53,I just found my favorite hole in the wall in Austin. Amazing food  drink  and service   Myself and another came here after an exhausting day traveling into Austin s airport. I m a native Houstonian and the other with me is from Mexico City  so his expectation of tacos and mine of tex mex are incredibly high.   This place was FANTASTIC. Amazing micheladas  which I find a lot of tex mex places have a hard time getting this right   yummy queso  with the option to add guac   delicious enchiladas  and super yummy tacos. Not to mention this place has daily happy hours and lunch specials and is overall very affordable compared to most tex mex you ll find in downtown Austin.   Will definitely be coming back on my next visit to Austin 
Jasmine's Restaurant,54,Not much from the looks of it  but turned out to be great  They make there own tortillas  Great service and good food 
Jasmine's Restaurant,55,Casual ambience  divey is a good description for Jasmine s. We were looking for something convenient on our way back to the airport and cheaper than airport food prices. Super convenient and a few doors down from the shell gas station  where we refilled the rental car . Service was good and food came out quickly. It was not busy at all. We ordered the beef nachos  pork tamales and crispy 3 taco plate  chicken and ground beef . Everything was fine and would recommend Jasmine s if you are looking for something basic and quick.
Jasmine's Restaurant,56,Jasmine s has quickly become one of my favorites   Had to make runs to the airport 2 days in a row and ate here both times.  Salsa is great and everything was freshly made.  Delicious frozen margaritas too   I ll make this my regular stop anytime I m in the area.
Jasmine's Restaurant,57,After a long and hungry flight home to AUS  I was desperate to look for some Tex-mex food. I yelped what was near by  and decided to give jasmine s a try.....  ....and let me tell you something. This is one of the best Tex-mex I have ever had. The chips they serve while you wait for your meal was delicious and it was only the beginning. I ordered the Mexican dinner and it was one of the best enchilada I have ever had. Their rice was also very good too.   I am by no means a Tex-mex expert with me being Asian and all  but this is good    
Jasmine's Restaurant,58,The service was very nice and the food was delicious.  We ordered the Queso with Beef and Avocado and that was delicious. We had the Enchiladas and it was big enough to share for 2 and be filled.  The taste was spot on.
Jasmine's Restaurant,59,The previous reviews did not lie.  The outside of the restaurant looks like it is closed or is in desperate need of repair.  The inside is divey like you just stepped into an Mexican cafe.  The customers are just as interesting.  The food was great.  Never had cauliflower tortillas but they were really good.  My husband had the fajitas.  He said they were okay .  All in all a good place fir authentic Mexican flavor.
Jasmine's Restaurant,60,When we were Yelping for an eatery near the airport and found Jasmine s  I was VERY skeptical about the high rating.  You pull up to a dilapidated building with barred windows  a deteriorating parking lot  on a sketchy looking street- Who eats here and why would they give it good ratings   As I discovered  this was a perfect example of  Don t judge a book by its cover.   So at first  once you get past the janky exterior and walk through the door  it s only slightly better.  Definitely has the look and feel of a local Mom amp Pop restaurante  with old furnishings and a small bar. Tables and booths all need revamping  the paint on the walls is peeling  etc.  But  the place is clean  quaint  and inviting enough.  The menu was actually very decent  lots of Mexican dishes  obviously  served in different combinations and styles.  I opted for a classic Carnitas plate  and my companion went with a vegetarian spinach enchiladas.  Both dishes came out sizzling hot and fresh.  And the food was delicious   My carnitas came with hot tortillas- mixed with the salsa  pico de gallo  and rice  made for some great eating.  My buddy s enchiladas were on point as well.  And they provide refillable chips and salsa  which adds to the gluttony.  The prices were actually very good- two full dinners with drinks came to  20ish. And the dude that served us was rad  and spoke English as well  an issue sometimes in any small international restaurant .    Oddly enough  despite the crummy building  shady neighborhood  and antiquated interior  I would have no problem coming back to this place again.
Jasmine's Restaurant,61,Meh. Not sure why this place has such good reviews. It s basically Taco Bell  maybe worse than Taco Bell. I had the beef burrito and the husband had the trio enchiladas. They were bland and mushy. The guacamole tasted old and not fresh at all. I thought we were going to get decent Mexican but it was pretty bad. I m giving 3 stars because the staff was friendly.
Jasmine's Restaurant,62,Oh  Jasmines. You divey  delicious little treasure. Don t let the outside fool you. Park and enter one of my fave spots for good  ol greasy authentic Mexican food. Guisada enchiladas are soooooo good  Ice cold beer to wash it down. Great service. Next to the airport. So it s full of airline employees. If they all eat here... you KNOW it s good.
Jasmine's Restaurant,63,We tried this place after leaving the airport since we were really hungry and didn t want to drive into Austin for lunch.  I kinda wish we did.  I think it was overall OK  but I ve had better Mexican food for sure.    It s a typical down home building  but everything was clean.  The chips and salsa were decent.  I had the veggie chili relleneo  but wasn t impressed by it.  Lacking in spice overall and the rice black beans were also very bland.  They did make my friend a black bean veggie burrito  which looked way better than mine.  They guys thought their fish tacos and fajitas were also just OK.  If I m in a hurry for lunch or have to wait for a flight  this place will do  but I don t think I d drive out of Austin for it.
Jasmine's Restaurant,64,Wow. This place is GREAT. The prices are VERY reasonable for the amount food you receive. They have just about everything on the menu. And it s not TEX-mex. it s authentic Mexican food.   I have only had breakfast  The staff are welcoming  helpful and friendly... The outside has kept me away for a long time. But it s extremely clean in the inside and I will be back.
Jasmine's Restaurant,65,Really good place with good food  I was skeptical when I saw the outside of the restaurant but gave it a shot anyway. Staff was very friendly and we didn t have to wait long for food. Tried their flautas and their fajitas  both were delicious  We also loved their complimentary chips and salsa which were really fresh and really good 
Jasmine's Restaurant,66,Great place. Authentic Mexican food with excellent vegetarian options. Easy to find parking. Service is fast and very friendly. Highly recommend it 
Jasmine's Restaurant,67,This place has the best enchiladas hands down and the best queso. This place is a small place so it s easy to pass up but the food and the staff are amazing  I enjoy coming here. This place is way better than Amaya s anyway 
Jasmine's Restaurant,68,This place not only has great service  but great specials on their menu items..-Waiters are very attentive and great food. Would recommend.. We usually go there during lunch..Have to try their breakfast..some day..Jasmines is tops..
Jasmine's Restaurant,69,Great food  Great customer service  Don t miss this place. I got the regular dinner plate  price was about  9  crispy taco  tamale  enchilada  guac salad  and some queso. Margs are great    
Jasmine's Restaurant,70,Awesome breakfast find  the huevos enchiladas are delicious. Hearty meal full of flavor  would definitely recommend this place for any meal. The place doesn t look like much on the outside  but inside you will get great food and service 
Jasmine's Restaurant,71,5 star update  Now you can enjoy all the great food with a margarita  They have their liquor license now and are pouring margaritas  Happy hour in Del Valle  That s worthy of 5 stars  I ll plug the Pollo Chipotle because its one of my faves 
Jasmine's Restaurant,72,Yum  A charming little Mexican place a hop  skip  and a jump from the airport  I ve been here on my way to the airport and it always hits the spot. Nice and inexpensive too.  I ve had a few things here  but the things that stand out are the enchiladas. I really liked the veggie version with green sauce. The green sauce was perfectly tangy  just like it should be. The chile con carne really surprised me too. And I REALLY don t like chile con carne usually. Too salty  meaty  and usually reminds me of a school lunch or something. But here  it tastes like it s supposed to and I love it   I feel like everything is just authentic here. You may surprise yourself with finding out you really did like chile con carne  Honestly  we ve got a lot of Mexican in Austin  so it s hard to say this is the best thing I ve ever eaten  but  it s a solid  authentic choice that sometimes has moments of brilliance.
Jasmine's Restaurant,73,Went here while waiting on a flight based on Yelp recommendations. Highly recommended  Salsa  queso and main dishes were very good. Restaurant was busy  but everything went quickly. We were there for lunch. Will definitely be back when I have time while in Austin.   The outside has that old charm  so don t think the food isn t awesome. It is.
Jasmine's Restaurant,74,Very good food and great service.  The food was served right off the grill... in and out within 20-30 mins
Jasmine's Restaurant,75,This place is incredible  I am a Texas girl born and raised and I know good Mexican food and good Tex-Mex food when I come across it  and this place hits the top of the list. The salsa was probably the best salsa I have ever had. It was spicy  full-flavored and absolutely delicious. I look forward to coming back to Austin so that I could try this place out again. Oh and the Margaritas were really good also they have a happy hour every single day from 4 to 7pm.
Jasmine's Restaurant,76,1Still enjoy eating at Jasmine s.  This little place is a suprise package.  My friend ordered the mole enchiladas and said the were great  not too much cinnamon ans slightly spicy.  Tge torta i had was delish. The bread was lightly toasted buttery and flaky. Not a heavy bread. My beef fajita meat was tender and grilled to perfection. Yep  you should take a chance and get you a meal here.  The salsa is made fresh daily  chips are lite and crispy. The staff is very kind and friendly
Jasmine's Restaurant,77,They need to update their hours. After waiting for and paying an Uber to drop me here  the place is closed. Not cool 
Jasmine's Restaurant,78,I have eaten at this place since they opened years ago. When they first opened they were great. They made fresh corn tortillas and used real cheddar cheese. They have since gone to using cheap processed cheese and premade  corn tortillas.  The food isn t bad but could be better.
Jasmine's Restaurant,79,This restaurant was recommended to us by the valet parking guy at the Hilton nearby. He said it s not much to look at but the food is delicious.  He was right on both accounts. The food is tremendous and I encourage anyone who is in Austin to drop by and sample some. I had the sample platter and shrimp cocktail. Best shrimp cocktail EVER. I will come back.
Jasmine's Restaurant,80,This place is surprisingly excellent   When you go inside the first thing that comes into your mind is  Damn it yelp  I knew I cannot trust you   But when you taste the food everything changes  Definitely will go there again if I m around.
Jasmine's Restaurant,81,A great find  Pulled right of 71 parked and strolled right inside. Chips and salsa are great  A little spicy but that s how I like it
Jasmine's Restaurant,82,Chips were from a bag and stale. I m pretty sure my tacos were made with canned chicken and taco shells from a box.
Jasmine's Restaurant,83,The staff is so friendly and attentive. The food is good and fresh. The decor is dated but the place is clean.
Jasmine's Restaurant,84,This place is fire  worth it for the salsa alone. Chorizo plate was great  green salsa made it better.
Jasmine's Restaurant,85,Don t let this little hole-in-the-wall Tex-mex restaurant fool you. The food was great  and the chips n salsa were superb. They make the salsa right there. Very friendly service. You will get more than your money s worth.
Jasmine's Restaurant,86,  82 This place is just down the road from El Michoacano  and I do have to say...Place looks like a Dive from the outside  yet very clean and big on the inside....I LOVE IT...First and foremost the Service is outstanding...Angel did a fantastic job...Not often to come across a kid...yes kid.. in this day and age  that actually cares about what he does..Best Service we have had in a long time...THANK YOU  ...The food was spot on as well...They have Queso  YAY ...and it was good..salsa was good  ...Chips were crisp  warm and stayed full...Wife again when the beef chiladas  which were packed out  and pretty dang good...Sauce was tasty  meat was good  did I already say they were Packed...Wife was stuffed when she was done...NOW my Dish  ...I have had it before at other places  but not served like this...I attacked the Carne Guisada enchiladas...So what was different.  ...These were Cheese Enchilada s wtih Carne on Top..Kinda like the best of both worlds  ...Carne was tender and full of flavor  Beans were tasty  and rice...well it was rice..We all have to admit  most are the same place to place  but good....All around a very good trip  and look forward to the next visit...The Quest to 100 continues   
Jasmine's Restaurant,87,We ordered a few things. All were great. The shrimp diablo and queso flameado with fajita beef were really fantastic. The churros dessert come with four warm small churros and a side of ice cream in a cup which was tasty.
Jasmine's Restaurant,88,Stopped in for the breakfast tacos    2 a taco with two ingredients    4 for three the same M-F.  We had egg   potato and cheese   about  5.50 with tax for three with three ingredients. Two tacos filed me up for breakfast.  Tried all three salsas  red  green  and hot  and recommend the green one.
Jasmine's Restaurant,89,I really liked Jasmines. Simple mexican  not very expensive  but quite tasty  I had the trio of enchiladas and they were all yummy. Service was fast and courteous  and the beer was cold. Can t imagine what else you d need 
Jasmine's Restaurant,90,My review would be much better but I recently realized that I was overcharged. I ordered a steak meal for  14.99  a chimichanga meal for  9.99  and 2 sodas for  1.79 each. I m still trying to figure out why I was charged  41.96 when I left a cash tip. The total for my bill before tax was  28.56. I will never visit this place again no matter how good the food is. I called the phone number to ask about the bill but all I get is a busy signal.
Jasmine's Restaurant,91,We stoped for breakfast before heading out of town.  When we first pulled up  we were a little skeptical but read a review in here which assured us not to worry.  I m so glad we re we re not deterred   I had the Huevos Enchilada and my friend had the Migas  egg scramble with jalape o  tomato  and onion .  Both were EXCELLENT 
Jasmine's Restaurant,92,GREAT service   Extremely attentive providing the best in customer service.  The queso and chips rocked   Generous servings and clean atmosphere.  We will be back 
Jasmine's Restaurant,93,Not to be a broken record but don t judge a book by its cover. I had an hour to kill before flying back to NYC and was craving Mexican food  one last hit before heading east. I found Jasmine s on Yelp and yes it happened to be the closest place to the airport. Nonetheless it was hands down some of the best food I have ever had.  I got the migas and it came with the best chorizo  the kind you can only get in Texas. I would highly recommend this spot and even going out of your way for this place. You won t be disappointed.
Jasmine's Restaurant,94,It does look suspect from outside  but do not let that deter you  It is clean inside   We were staying at the Hilton Airport Friday and Saturday and found Jasmines to be a  4 minute drive away.  After two breakfasts and one dinner there  all six of us had nothing but praises. With friendly service  great food  generous portions and cheap prices  it was a find. Cops and Super Shuttle drivers have found it  too  Beer and margaritas are available.  Driving from or to the airport  it is very convenient plus there is gas to fill the rental car next door at the Circle K.  Give it a try 
Jasmine's Restaurant,95,My mother  amp  I stopped in here after reading a couple of reviews. I was so happy we did the service was great  amp  the food even better. I had the chilaquiles   might have spelt that wrong   amp  my mom had the chorizo plate both were amazing. It s hard for me to find good basic chilaquiles because everyone wants to put in so many other things. They kept them simple salsa  cheese   amp  topped with a bit of diced onions. Even the potatos  amp  beans were delicious. Don t be deterred by the outside. This place is amazing.
Jasmine's Restaurant,96,Stopped here for a quick breakfast on my way to the airport and was pleasantly surprised. Looks sketchy but it was actually not bad. The staff is friendly and they refill house made chips and salsa be careful it s spicy but I m a whimp I made my own breakfast taco and the service was fast
Jasmine's Restaurant,97,Jasmine s was recommended by the front desk of Quality Inn. We asked for good Mexican food and we got it only 3 blocks away. Small hole in the hole mom and pops type restaurant. Those always seem to be the best ones. Good cold beer and good hot food. They went out of their way for my wife s dietary needs and she was very happy. I pigged out as usual. Great food. If flying out of Austin airport. You can gas up your rental next door get a great dinner all in one stop. Happy wife happy life.
Jasmine's Restaurant,98,The best hispanic restaurant near the airport. They have the best Torta Cubana in Austin 
Jasmine's Restaurant,99,Ordered caldo de res and caldo de pollo  EXCELLENTE  I always passed by this place and only today I decided to stop  dine and WOW 
Jasmine's Restaurant,100,Very authentic  good little Mexican restaurant. No complaints good flavor good service I would recommend to anyone 
Jasmine's Restaurant,101,Excellent food at a fair price and fun  lived in   atmosphere. Don t let the exterior deter you.
Jasmine's Restaurant,102,I absolutely love this place. I work out in Del Valle and there is nothing to eat around. I found this place on Yelp and based on the reviews I decided to give it a try... I m pretty picky when it comes to food but I was STARVING and had to eat something. I called them up and order my food  they never asked me for my name or anything... When I walked in I said I had a pick up and they knew exactly what I ordered. The best part is they didn t charge me to take chips and salsa   Most restaurants make you dine in to eat the free chips... But not this place  I was literally in and out within 7 sevens and less then 8 dollars. LOVE IT 
Jasmine's Restaurant,103,Amazing food and excellent vegetarian options. Best chips and salsa in Austin. So happy I found this place. Not near my home  but definitely worth traveling for. A must try    
Jasmine's Restaurant,104,Service very attentive  Food was underwhelming   Had the beef fajitas. Served warm on a plate   not on the traditional sizzling skillet. Good quantity of meat  but very few onions and peppers. Usual fajita flavor lacking. Somewhat bland.  Decent portions.
Jasmine's Restaurant,105,Let s start with the chips and salsa. The chips were worm and and had a good flavor. The salsa is spicy but also has a good taste. The wait staff was very nice and knew the menu well enough to make suggestions. I ended up getting the Mexican dinner  enchiladas  a taco  quest  guacamole  rice and refried beans  . My meal was fantastic and it came out super fast  There were no disappointments. If I can sum up this place in one statement it would be   Classic Tex-Mex done right.  One last thing  the refried beans were some of the best I ve ever had.
Jasmine's Restaurant,106,I love Southern California Mexican food  and since recently moving to McAllen Texas I have yet to find a burrito place. I enjoyed my chicken burrito so much I wanted to hug everyone in there. My fianc  had enchiladas which had a cheese sauce on them  like nacho cheese ... Weird I thought  but he loved it. Very nice and friendly staff  no wait and great food. Wish I wasn t 5 hours away and could try more of the food and margaritas 
Jasmine's Restaurant,107,It looks unattractive from the outside but the Hilton staff recommended it and we are glad they did.  Great food  Attentive service  Cheap   If you can - go over there and grab some lunch 
Jasmine's Restaurant,108,My go to for the best breakfast tacos in the area. Their migas with fajitas slams. I love this place and go here at least 3 times a week. I highly recommend this place. Plus the staff is really nice. Never had a bad experience here.
Jasmine's Restaurant,109,Great chili rellenos and cheese enchiladas and customer service   And that s about it.  These three things are good enough to earn the 4 stars.  Otherwise....  We had a carne asada burrito and a chicken fajita burrito and both were ewww.  Prices were a little high as well.  So stick with the good stuff and you ll be happy.
Jasmine's Restaurant,110,This place was awesome. Took my 3 kiddos. I had carnitas terrific service. Got 10  military will definitely pass the word to soldiers. Clean bathrooms and inside. Don t let the outside deceive you. Going to be a regular for us.
Jasmine's Restaurant,111,Great food  quality ingredients  and the best corn tortillas in Austin.  Don t let the outside sketchiness of the surroundings fool you- didn t your mother teach you it s the INSIDE that counts   Great service- the servers and manager are all so nice.  Watch a futbol game at their fully stocked bar  or bring the family for a meal.  The tortilla soup and their Micheladas are my fave.
Jasmine's Restaurant,112,Was in Austin for a few days and drove by this place and decided to stop in for breakfast. I was not disappointed. Great food at a great  price. I will be returning next time I am in Austin.
Jasmine's Restaurant,113,If  you want the Ritz keep driving  if you want great authentic food  reasonably priced served by happy people.... Stop here. I don t leave reviews for everywhere I go. Just the ones that go above and beyond..... This place is great  the food came out so fast I thought the cook was psychic. Tasty authentic flavors  served with home made flour tortillas. Great coffee.... Don t let the exterior fool you  try it you ll like it.
Jasmine's Restaurant,114,Like others  I stopped in for a quick breakfast before a flight. Like others  my initial impression from the parking lot was not good. But the food was very good  and the wait staff very friendly and efficient. Although not fancy  it felt homey  clean  and comfortable. I can recommend the huevos rancheros.
Jasmine's Restaurant,115,Great little hole in the wall. Manager is super friendly. Wait staff delivers to my work 50 yards away
Jasmine's Restaurant,116,Let me start off by saying I LOVE Mexican food and dive restaurants. I was hungry while on the way to the airport and decided to give this place a try. It looks seedy from the outside but inside it s very clean and welcoming. The staff are super friendly but don t be in a hurry when you come here. I had the al pastor plate and it was probably one of the best I ve had. The only downside is they just give you 2 tortillas  which are homemade  . I ll definitely be back    
Jasmine's Restaurant,117,Don t judge a book by it s cover   This little out of the way place has been serving the Del Valle community for years and never seems to disappoint.  Good  clean and simple Tex-Mex and friendly staff.  I come here 3 times a month and I love it every time.  The salsa is great and if you are a frequent customer  you can even get a free meal.  Ask the waiter when you get there.  Personally  I like the flautas and the deluxe nachos.  On the lighter side  I enjoy the taco salad  in a taco shell    amp  the spinach and mushroom enchiladas.  Hipster Restauratuers attempt to recreate this ambiance and it is refreshing to get a taste of the real deal.
Jasmine's Restaurant,118,We came to ATx for a quick overnight trip and wanted to grab breakfast on our way back to Houston. By the time we thought to really look for a place to eat  we were almost out of town...and I m so glad we waited  Jasmines isn t in a fancy building  but it is very clean and we had an amazing experience. The food was delicious. I know it s hard to screw up breakfast tacos  but they used something special in these because they had just a bit of extra flavor to make them sooo good. The salsa and tortillas were fresh and also did not disappoint. The BEST part about eating here was the service. I m not sure if our waitress was the owner or if she just worked there  but she was so friendly and so nice. I don t usually give five stars  but this place by far exceeded our expectations  To top it off our bill was  22  with 30  tip . Can t beat great food  great service  and great prices 
Jasmine's Restaurant,119,There are not many food choices in this area  and even if there were  Jasmine s would still be up there with some of the best Mexican food I ve found in Austin.  It s a cozy little hole-in-the-wall.  The prices are VERY reasonable  their tortillas  flour and corn  are homemade  and their service is fast and friendly.  My collegues and I come here at least twice a week for lunch and some of our top choices are   Beef or cheese enchiladas  the sauce i ON point    Caldo chicken and Tortilla soup are preferred by us   Nachos  and their breakfast tacos. Check this place out and find out for yourself   I have yet to try any of their other plates because I crave these few so much.  They also have lunch specials on their menu and in additon to that  they ll have a rotating lunch special for the day.
Jasmine's Restaurant,120,The wifi never works. If some kind Yelper can help these people get their wifi together it would be great. They paid  500 to get it set up to a guy in Houston. They blame him and ATT. At any rate it needs to be fixed.
Jasmine's Restaurant,121,I was fooled by the four stars on this one. The food is not good. This is Austin  TX  right  I have always heard to eat Mexican  steak  and BBQ here. If you are leaving the airport in Austin craving Mexican food  drive a little further and avoid this Dive. The four stars are extremely suspicious here.
Jasmine's Restaurant,122,The food is really good...REALLY GOOD. My only gripe is they use bagged chips. I prefer places which fry their own chips. More of it was good than not  so I would totally recommend this place  especially if flying in out of Austin.
Jasmine's Restaurant,123,Total dive by the airport  but the food was great.  We actually dined here b c of the great reviews.  We were not disappointed at all    Highly recommend giving this spot a chance.
Jasmine's Restaurant,124,Very good. I had the  9 Crispy Combo  which has a taco  chalupa  and rice for a  6.99 lunch special. Everything was great and the rice was superior. Good service  good food  and good price. Hard to beat that 
Jasmine's Restaurant,125,Affordable prices.  3 Coronas  hello      and the Chicken Tortilla soup is made with full chicken  avocados  and full flavors. Beware the salsa....a ten on the spicy scale.
Jasmine's Restaurant,126,The food was very good  right outside the airport very convenient  prices were reasonable and the staff very friendly  We ll be back 
Jasmine's Restaurant,127,Delicious little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant  It may not look it from the out side but the food here is delicious and inside its nice and clean  Came in for  breakfast after reading other reviews on yelp and we were not disappointed. The breakfast migas taco it s amazing  Huevos rancheros were on point  Warm homemade corn tortillas  Everything was authentic Mexican food. And cheap  Our waitress was so nice and tentative. The only reason I m not giving it the fifth star is because of something that made our visit a little uncomfortable. Apparently  the waitress brought us an order that was meant for one of the other tables and the man in the kitchen behind the little window  not sure if he is the owner or not  started yelling at the waitress in Spanish to where everyone could hear everything he was telling her. 95  of the customers dining in were Spanish speaking  so yes  we ALL understood what he said. I feel like he should ve been a bit more professional about it and either call the waitress to the back or wait for a less busy time to bring it up and handle the situation in an orderly manner. Of course we were uncomfortable after that but tried not to let it ruin our delicious breakfast. Will definitely be coming back when I m in the area  and recommend for anyone looking for a good cheap breakfast 
Jasmine's Restaurant,128,Wonderful food  great service and good prices.....   Had the Mexican Dinner Plate and it was really Two plates of some of the best Tex-Mex I ve had.  This restaurant doesn t look appealing from the outside - not uncommon with  hidden gems  - but it is clean and the food is delicious      The Hilton is on the other side of the freeway  so it s close and easy to get to from the hotel or airport.  They work hard to make your meal a pleasure and do a good job of it    Excellent drinks and good wines to boot   Try it  you ll like it 
Jasmine's Restaurant,129,Wow  I caught the Hilton hotel shuttle over to pick up take out from Jasmine s. Great Mexican food  fast and courteous service. Highly recommend 
Jasmine's Restaurant,130,Breakfast tacos were awesome  If you are thinking about skipping this place because the area looks shady  don t  The prices are low and the food is great.
Jasmine's Restaurant,131,Simple Mexican restaurant. Good happy hour. Yummy salsa. Ask for the habanero one if you like it hot. Friendly service. A good place to eat near the airport
Jasmine's Restaurant,132,Great little hole in the wall. Authentic Mexican with good spice and flavor.  Good prices
Jasmine's Restaurant,133,Just moved to Del Valle 3 days ago and im already in love with this place   looks a little shabby on the outside but the service and food are to die for   ive mainly had their veggie entrees and they are all fantastic   gotta try this place out  
Jasmine's Restaurant,134,Had to try one more time while coming from airport to see if eating it fresh would make a difference  and it DID  I m back to loving the Carne Asada Torta. It actually wasn t on the menu exactly  but I just asked for a Carne Asada Torta and they made it. It comes with a lil mayo  lettuce  tomato  onions on a toasted good bun with flavorfulll Carne Asada meat. Kids love it too  minus the onions. About 6 bucks and a lil  tax. You gotta try it. Soon as you round the corner leaving out of the airport in Austin  pass the gas station and pull right into the parking lot. I believe it was a green building. Very nice girl in there too that helped us.
Los Pepes,1,Best Mexican food I ve ever had. I m from Up north in PA  so needless to say our choices of authentic Mexican cuisine is slim to none. I am down here for Austin City Limits  and staying a block away. We walked past and I decided to try it. I speak some Spanish so ordering was not an issue. Service was excellent  the lady taking my order all three times here was patient and helpful. Food itself is amazing. Tried the carnitas  barbacoa  el pastor  And chicken tacos. Also tried the enchiladas Rojas  beef burritos  and several of their fruit drinks. All amazing. Any time I come back to Austin I will be stopping here first thing.
Los Pepes,2,Ive tried their strawberries and cream  mangonadas and mojarras and they have all been tasty and great  I usually call in to pick up my order and it s always done in time great place for food or if you want something sweet or salty
Los Pepes,3,THE BEST authentic home made Mexican food in Austin  maybe all of central Texas. If you ever find yourself in northeast Austin craving GREAT Mexican good  this is THE place  It s a bit on the spicy side  after all Mexicans love their chiles  but they are willing to tone it down  guero-style if you prefer.
Los Pepes,4,Really hard to believe that this place doesnt have more reviews for as long as its been open...This place was is surely a hole in the wall  out of the way  blink and you will miss it type of place...There is a bit of a language barrier  but we worked thru it...Bang for you buck is about the best you can find...We get the starters...some salsa  chips and Queso...Chips are home made  Salsa was great and small side of beans as well...We werent the biggest fans of the Queso  but the price was right for  2.00...Wife starts with the usual...Beef chiladas  double rice...topped with red sauce...Mine was the Chicken Chiladas with green sauce  beans and rice...Each plate came with 4  yes 4 enchiladas...and they were delish ...all for the average price of  8.99...They were packed  and the sauces were full of flavor...rice was fresh and fluffy...Take the time to check this place out...its well worth it  next stop here will be for breakfast.
Los Pepes,5,I added the new menu photos   I just started working close to Los Pepes. We have been there twice for lunch and it is great  Delicious chips  salsa and refried beans were served while we waited. Food arrived quickly and looked great. I have had the Carne Asada and Pozole lunch specials so far. Everything was fresh  hot and very good. We ll be back for lunch and I plan to take dinner home to the family soon.
Los Pepes,6,Comida mexicana estilo luvianos aut ntica deliciosa  cocinan con mucho sabor y todos son muy amables 
Los Pepes,7,First time here  and I will definitely come back. The best Mexican seafood gumbo I ever had. The customer service was okay  but the cooks were great  Small location with few tables but it was totally worth it.
Los Pepes,8,OMG yes  I just moved to the northeast side and until today I had been disappointed by the quality and variety of Mexican food in this part of town. But now I ve found Los Pepes and my palate is doing its happy dance. This the real deal  with a broad and deep menu of familiar favorites  enchiladas done true Mexican style with no orange cheese in sight   filling caldos  my dining partner had the delicious  Vuelve a la Vida  seafood soup   and snacks that are new to me like pambazos and a million kinds of huaraches. So good  I ll be back.
Los Pepes,9,Found this place because I was looking for a pambazo in Austin. This place feels authentic Mexican and the food matches. I had the pambazo with pastor and my girlfriend had the enchiladas verdes. These are not tex-mex style enchiladas slathered with gravy or cheese. The tortillas are a little crispy  the salsa and crema are fantastic  and the rice and beans on the side taste good and homemade. The aguas frescas are delicious  we tried melon and pineapple  both splendid.
Los Pepes,10,It s one of the places I most recommend in Austin. Their pambazo and their enchiladas are not what most people are used to from Mexican food  but they re delicious. This is authentic Mexican food  not doused-in-gravy-and-cheese Tex-Mex.   Breakfast wasn t great  I had the chilaquiles and found the sauce to just be a little sour with not much flavor . The food I ve had for lunch  on the other hand  is delicious and the kind I would expect in Mexico.   The decor feels very homey. It s not fancy  but it s not a hole-in-the-wall. It has character and a unique feel.
Los Pepes,11,I can t believe that I live down the street from this place and I have never been here  I picked up food for my daughter my mother and myself all for under  25.  We got the gordita and asked for nopales instead of meat also ordered the combo plate  w chicken   amp  the huarache azteca.  SO much food    The chicken was very tender and seasoned just right  not too salty.  No American cheese  all queso blanco  the best and only way to go.  Huarache was huge and enough for at least two people.  The Gordita wasn t greasy perfect for really hungry and on the go person and was wrapped up so neat  I ll definitely go back when I need something on the go.  Son buena gente en los pepes con comida riqu sima tambi n i love to support local small business.  Highly recommend this place if you leave on Loyola or mlk.
Los Pepes,12,The food is so good but I found a hair and my appetite was ruined. Other than that that is very important  it s good.
Los Pepes,13,I live near Los Pepes and read the previous review about the place. I have forgotten every bit of Spanish I learned in college and BELIEVE ME  it was obvious  I decided I wasn t going to keep my lost understanding of the language from at least trying it.   I got there and it was very obvious that there was a severe lang barrier. Still  I managed to order 4 tostadas without meat  I m a pescetarian   a fruit cup  and mexican coke. The sauces offered were both good  but beware of that orange onethe spiciness sneaks up on you  lol   The fruit was really fresh  but after having my mouth on fire from the orange sauce  I wasn t able to finish the fruit cup  that was seasoned with chili  but it doesn t matter...I will be back    Not bad for a hole-in-the-wall place   
Los Pepes,14,This place is interesting. It s in a strip mall near my house  and if my roommate hadn t brought me here then I probably never would ve eaten here. They have tasty tacos for a buck if you buy em before 11am. It s also a fruiteria  with fruit cups so large and tasty for 5 or 6 dollars that the business has to be losing money on the cost of fruit alone. They would get a solid 4 stars based on food quality and price  but they lose a star due to lack of english speaking ability. There are a few different people who work there that have no problem speaking English  but they re not always there. Not a problem for me seeing as how I speak Spanish  but nevertheless they have still messed up my order a couple of times. Once they gave me bacon  amp  chz tacos and left out the potato... Seriously  who eats bacon  amp  cheese tacos  I imagine someone lacking bilingual attributes could have a tough time on the wrong day.
Los Pepes,15,The food is good but the waitresses  the people who take your order are rude. They sometimes mess up your order and whenever you explain to them how you would like your food  they look at you like youre crazy. They dont even take note of it. And they take foreveeer to give you your food sometimes. So  the reason why i rate it 2 stars is because of the bad service.
Tacos Doña Rosita,1,Solid tacos. This food truck is located in the food court area next to Thundercloud Subs.   Nothing fancy. Just good solid tacos at a great price   2- 3 .    Bistec tacos were excellent. Excellent thin corn tortillas. Well seasoned cuts of meat  avocado  and onions.   Pastor taco was average. Meat was marinated in some funky pink sauce. It was okay. Just not great.   Will go back and try a few other tacos next time.
Tacos Doña Rosita,2,Delicioso  As someone who grew up in central Mexico  I miss an authentic Torta. Calling it a Mexican Sandwich is like calling Texas BBQ sauce  fancy ketchup  - it s not the same  right   The torta s essential ingredient is it s  telera  bread  which has a unique flavor  and interestingly is one of the wonderful things Mexico got from the French occupation from the 1862 to 1867 - when Mexico lost the war shortly after winning the famous May 5th battle. But I digress...  Once you have a Telera  you need a special kind of alchemist to turn this bread into a Torta. More specifically  you need queso blanco  beans  jalape o peppers  mayo  with lemon   and some meat. My preference is ham  but there are delicious tortas made with chicken fried steak  milanesa empanizada   or with hot dog franks and ham  cubana .  The result is unique  and  at least for me  delicious. So I was delighted to find out Do a Rosita has authentic  yummy tortas. I need to come back and try the tacos de bisteck  which according to the owner and chef  is the house specialty.  This is going to be my go-to lunch place near my new office. Expect an updated review soon.
Tacos Doña Rosita,3,This truck was ok. It is tucked in the back from the street. I tried a few of the trucks on the area. My one taco took about 10  mins but there were a couple orders in front of me I guess. They just seemed to be moving slow that day. The taco was just ok. Not bad but not particularly good either. Let s just say I would go with the other options in the area as my first choice for dining.   Happy Hunting Yelpers 
Tacos Doña Rosita,4,Mediocre tacos - The chicken fajita was pretty plain as if it weren t even seasoned. The salsas provided - green and red - were actually phenomenal though and made up for the lack of flavor in the tacos. Won t be my first choice for lunch  but will probably give it another shot.
Tacos Doña Rosita,5,Recently  went here on 06 14  A Friday night  and although the food was tasty there may be some seriously health standard issues. That night  my wife suffered from mild food poisoning  she skipped lunch because of work  and symptoms arouse about midnight.   It is apparent from previous posts the gentleman working behind the counter seems to neglect sanitary regulations  maybe different for food trucks . It might have also been the food  bistec and pastor  however  my symptoms weren t nearly as bad.   On a better note  the food isn t terrible but this will be the last time I eat here. Lastly  the gentleman behind the counter is also pretty rude  during our order he answered the phone neglecting any manners towards us.   Be careful if you decide to eat here 
Tacos Doña Rosita,6,Omg. Never thought to eat from a food truck before. This was so amazing I may never eat at a Mexican restaurant again. Best street tacos ever    
Tacos Doña Rosita,7,Come to this place if you want some authentic bistec tacos  My wife and her family are from Matamoros Mexico  and they were telling me these tacos are exactly how they make hem back home.  I m definitely returning to try everything else on the menu.  Also  the ingredients are quality. You can tell the difference.
Tacos Doña Rosita,8,The good  both red and green salsas were great  The red had a nice kick to it. Went there on a Monday afternoon  and parking was plentiful. This trailer is in the food truck park at 2222 and 620.   The meh  Ordered a taco de barbacoa and a torta de bistec. Service was just ok. The gentleman at the window was somewhat friendly but not really. After taking my cash payment  I watched as he took the torta bread out of the bag and assembling it with bare hands. My understanding is you have to wash your hands before handling food. The bread was not toasted  which was a bummer as it got soggy on the drive home. The torta had a sparse serving of meat  queso fresco  beans  2 slices of avocado  wilted lettuce  and pickled jalapeno. The sour cream was not evenly spread  throwing the ratio off. The taco was on store bought white tortillas  and the meat had a lot of fat in it. Paid  .50 for a side of extra jalapenos and received a salsa container with one of those pickled jalapeno slices they sell in a can with the carrots. I decided to check my order in the car  and I had asked for corn tortilla and received flour. No big deal  but the gentleman argued that I had ordered on flour. I think I know what I ordered since I NEVER eat flour tortillas. Just personal preference. Paid a little under  15 and not sure if I d go back as the drive is long. I can see the appeal of this truck in this neighborhood since there aren t a lot of authentic Mexican options.   Their menu is a little all over the place  but they sell tacos  specialty tacos  burritos  tortas  and breakfast tacos.
Tacos Doña Rosita,9,Nice taco truck that has a good mix of basic traditional stuff and some gringofied tacos.   We had the gringa  matamoros taco  and a breakfast with beans and  bacon chorizo  which was a nice touch with crispy bacon bits and chorizo mixed into the eggs.
Tacos Doña Rosita,10,Came here for the breakfast tacos. What a steal. 3 ingredients for  2 tacos.    Really good portions too.   Owner was really nice.   Great red and green salsas too.   I will definitely be back.
Tacos Doña Rosita,11,Have only been once but definitely going back. We ordered 2 breakfast tacos  egg  sausage  refried beans  cheese   and 2 al pastor tacos. Both were solid. The green sauce has a nice kick but not too spicy  wish it was though .  Beware - their listed open hours seem to be different from website to website  to actual open hours.
Tacos Doña Rosita,12,This place is legit. Rice and beans are excellent. I tried the barbacoa tacos - very tasty.
Tacos Doña Rosita,13,I ve been multiple times and the bistec is excellent in burrito or taco form. My wife complained that the shredded chicken was a bit gristly. Wish they had chips and a more regular schedule  but this is a great taco truck in authentic Mexican street food style.
Tacos Doña Rosita,14,Tacos were no bueno.  No me gusta.  Bistec taco was not good at all.  Location is good  right next to Mighty Fine and the Indian style kebob trailer.
Tacos Doña Rosita,15,Authentic and phenomenal.  Very reasonably priced with a friendly and attentive staff.  5  stars
Tacos Doña Rosita,16,I have to agree with that one comment from Hurah below. The guy at the window didn t wash his hands at all after he handled cash. Me and my friend visited them about six month ago. I remembered the food was acceptable  but nothing special. I have been to Mexico many times for business  his food reminds me of our company cafeteria s food. This time around the experience was just horrible. I should ve opened the tacos and checked before I left. I said no sour cream and flour tortillas  but instead  I got sour cream. The beef was so tough and dry. It also had a weird taste to it. I think since they barely had any customer while we were there  a lot of ingredients probably just sat there and getting dried  maybe being reheated over and over again   The chicken was definitely under cooked. It was still pink in the center. It was so gross  Check your taco at the window when you get it. Or better just eat them right in front of him and show him that his f   ing chicken is raw  This place has definitely gone from okay to unacceptable. Don t waste your time and money here 
Tacos Doña Rosita,17,Very good tacos very excellent service. But these are he tacos that make you Texas   well Texas.
Tacos Doña Rosita,18,i love this little truck. their bistek is deliciousness  tortillas too   customer service is always pleasant and they make tacos to order 
Tacos Doña Rosita,19,Looking for authentic Mexican food in the steiner four points area  Look no further my friends - Taco Dona Rosita has the solution. I have made multiple visits trying different meats and different entrees and I have never left disappointed or hungry. From the beans to the rice to salsas and the variety of main dishes - you can t miss. I have been looking for a place like this since moving from San Antonio over a year ago  and I found it in a truck. The location of This gem is tucked behind Mighty Fine off 620. See you there.
Sopa De Fideo,1,I ve been up off 183 Saturday mornings for the past few months and grabbing breakfast tacos.  I wasn t near the Sunoco on Braker east of Burnet and got worried I might not find a good taco to have.  Then I ran across Sopa De Fideo. I like chorizo  potato  and egg.  Looking at the menu  I saw chorizo  potato  bean  and egg.   Is that what all is in the taco  or those are choices     That s all in the taco .  Heck yeah.  One with chorizo and one with bacon.  The tacos were fat and went down very easy.  Only thing I could consider complaining about is the salsa.  It was okay.  The rest of the taco was so good  the salsa did not bring it down. Looks like they might have moved off to Hamilton Pool Rd 
Sopa De Fideo,2,We hit up Sopa De Fideo recently to get some breakfast tacos chalupas. Really good stuff  Only thing I d say is the sauces salsas were all extremely spicy and the chalupas were very oily. There was  however  some really great flavor in these chalupas and it was still very tasty.
Sopa De Fideo,3,First I would like to say that the workers here are the most friendly and polite people you ll ever meet. They have little cute picnic tables so you can enjoy your food after you order or you can take it home. They do not skimp on the breakfast tacos. They even have some specialty tacos to choose from. The brisket one is one of my my favorites because of all the protein in it. They have one specialty taco right now called El Chente  OMG      My new favorite     They have home made red and green salsa both are excellent. For drink you can choose from juices   water  or my favorite Mexican coke.  Over all  this little food truck area is cute a little hidden  but  you will enjoy   
Sopa De Fideo,4,Found this gem of a good truck on accident. Service was great and was greeted with smiling happy faces. She was patient with me and explained all questions I had regarding the menu. Tried x2 breakfast items  one chalupa and one taco. Both were fresh  hot and delicious and they are gracious on their quantities. So good I m went back again the next day   
Sopa De Fideo,5,Really solid breakfast tacos. Good flavor  and filling. I ordered a variety to bring to my friends. Including the fried puffy tacos  and that was a heat.  This is in a little alley way off 183.
Sopa De Fideo,6,I ve been wanting to find more authentic taco trucks and this was a gem  I love the small area of tables under the shade of the trees.  There s a Mediterranean food truck neighboring which I plan to go back for. I expected my chalupa to be bigger based on the photos  but it wasn t huge. The soup takes a little longer and the lady  owner   called us over  giving us the option to just dig into our chalupas first. The soup was simple and didn t seem to be super deeep stew  it was relatively clear soup  a little MSG-y  but still homey.   I will be back to try the actual tacos.
Sopa De Fideo,7,My friend lives nearby and I was in town for the weekend so we wanted to try this place. I arrived around 11 30 and placed my to-go order. It was a beautiful day outside so I didnt mind the wait  which was about 30 minutes  It seemed like they had a lot of online orders too. Got back and opened it and everything was packaged well. My friend and I both agreed that the tacos were missing some salt and a bit on the small side. Otherwise  they were very good  My favorite was probably the brisket. I really enjoyed the sopa as well. Will have to come back and try some other items.
Sopa De Fideo,8,Very tasty food  nice little picnic area to eat in if you choose  and very sweet people who run the truck    I got a breakfast taco with chorizo  potato  egg  and cheese. Loved this  They make their own chorizo and I love that it s not greasy and doesn t just drip oil everywhere while still being flavorful. The potato is a really nice creamy texture. It s not a super egg-forward taco  it s on equal footing with the other ingredients which I think is great. It s also a fairly large breakfast taco  Like  double the size that tacodeli would make.   I ordered the carnitas chalupa off the lunch menu and it comes with a side of sopa. This alone makes a very filling  and inexpensive  meal  The chalupa is puffy with a bit of crisp but not at all dry. The sopa is simple but flavorful  feels home-y.   The breakfast and lunch dinner menus are both served all day  so you don t need to worry about going before after a certain time and missing half the menu.
Sopa De Fideo,9,I had mini chalupas and fries w carne asada and . This place is soooooo good   Open for breakfast too   next time  . There are 4 food trucks next to each other. Go for the  one     I am coming back for sure 
Sopa De Fideo,10,Absolutely WONDERFUL. I was greeted warmly at the truck and decided on brisket chalupa with sopa. In the cold months  the sopa de fideo will be a wonderful comfort food. For those of you not familiar   Sopa de fideo  also referred to as sopita de fideo  is a stock-based noodle soup that is a part of the cuisines of Spain  Mexico  Tex-Mex cuisine  and Cavite  a province in the Philippines. It has been suggested that the dish may have originated in Spain.   The chalupa was bright and textured accompanied by their chunky artisan tomatillo and a red salsa. Fantastic.   I cannnot recommend more highly. Everything was delicious  beautifully packaged.  I even was introduced to the cook   This is a mother daughter operation that deserves your consistent support.  The best of the Austin food truck scene    Can t wait to go back 
Sopa De Fideo,11,Fantastic. Hard to find a place that knows how to do eggs just right. I got the Los Munchos waffle and wow. Better than any diner I ve been to in Austin. Tried a bit of my wife s taco and it was also among the best I ve had in town  and we ve been looking for a new place since our old favorites have either gone downhill or closed. Can t wait to come back 
Sopa De Fideo,12,My boyfriend and I both love this place  The tacos are delicious and my boyfriend said the sopa reminds him of the one he grew up eating that his grandma made. Simple and yummy.
Sopa De Fideo,13,I love this place - peaceful little outdoor area to relax  and they are always so nice and helpful   Oh  and the food is bomb. That helps too  right  I ve tried the flautas  quesadillas  amp  crunch tacos  would order all again 
Sopa De Fideo,14,We ordered the cinnamon crunch waffles without bacon  a breakfast chalupa and a breakfast taco. All great flavors  The Cinnamon Toast Crunch waffle really did taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch   7.50 The chalupa is fried  but doesn t taste like oil. The masa has a great flavor.  3.50 you get up to 3 toppings. I chose egg  beans and jalape os.  And the breakfast taco was on a flour tortilla which also had a very good flavor   3.50  You also get 3 toppings on these  The green salsa was very mild so if you don t like spicy  try the green salsa. I also ordered a biscuit with jam but nothing noteworthy there so not worth posting a picture of it. It tasted flat and was a bit stale.  Overall great place  Great flavors and very friendly people
Sopa De Fideo,15,I have never encountered Al Pastor that could match this. When you place your order  and the wind blows a little from the north  a wave of air instilled with a blend of carne asada  carnitas  and that magical pork  and just a hint of papas fritdas  will strike you plain in the face  and the last two times I ve had lunch there I was almost unable to operate the credit card machine because the aroma was out of control. The soup is superb and comes in wonderful little containers  and I ve just remembered that one of them is in my refrigerator and I m going to bring this review to a close and go heat that thing up and eat half a taco that we had left over because we d stuffed ourselves on soup  fries and tacos. Do not neglect this truck.
Sopa De Fideo,16,Erika  and the other lady  sorry I didn t get her name were so nice to me. Slammed on a Torta for sure best in Austin  the quality and presentation 10 10  Also Coffee was on point from flavor to the temp
Sopa De Fideo,17,This is my breakfast spot. The family that owns the truck are great and the food is even better. Bonus points if Ola is running around the truck.
Sopa De Fideo,18,Absolutely fantastic.  We were driving through Austin from DFW area. So glad we stopped here. Great picnic area that is shaded. We had tacos and chalupa. Both were great. Both salsas have so much flavor.  Red is spicier than green.
Sopa De Fideo,19,Oh  this is such a lovely gem. We were heading south on the access road along 183 and saw a sign for Hamilton Food park. We hung a little right and discovered one lone food truck...a lovely  bright orange food truck with the most amazing smells.  S had the carne asada taco on a flour tortilla. The meat was tender and crispy  the tortilla was fresh and so perfect. The red salsa was spiiiiicy. This is probably one of the best tacos I have ever eaten.  I asked whether they could do something with veg  even though it wasn t on the menu. They whipped up something with broccoli and onions. It was light and delightful.  On top of all this  the owner of the van is a delight. She s been there only 3 months and has taken to beautifying the lot in addition to making incredible...and if you can t come to her  get her food from grub hub.  As for me  we re already planning our next visit 
Sopa De Fideo,20,Best food truck I ve ever been to. Took my mom who is really picky and surprisingly she loved it everything she order was on spot I 100  recommend this place
Sopa De Fideo,21,This place is really awesome. We saw it driving by one day and decided to swing by for lunch. The food park is super cute and the staff were incredible. So friendly and nice and the food was DELICIOUS. We got the al pastor and brisket tacos  both very good and flavorful   the soup  which was different than anything I ve ever had but also so great   the carne asada fries  big portion    and the zucchini bread  which may have been my favorite of it all - fresh cream cheese icing included   . I can t believe this place has been here 5 months already and we are only just discovering it. We ll be back  probably very soon. Definitely check this place out  
Sopa De Fideo,22,This food truck is simply delicious  I went to get lunch for my husband and it was my first time driving through that street  so glad I saw their sign  It was a 50 degree weather so when I saw the name I got excited  who doesn t want Fideo on a cold day    I ordered three corn tacos  one of asada  carnitas  and pastor.  3 tacos come with a side of Sopa soup  I got an extra soup for  2 and salsas in the bag. They have can drinks and glass bottles. The tacos were so good   my family and I will definitely go back. The set up they have is the cutest  clean picnic tables with  small flower pots on the tables  a bottle opener on the tree  hand sanitizer table....and what can I say about their customer service  They were the nicest..try it  you won t regret it.
Sopa De Fideo,23,Great food truck find on the way to Trader Joe s Fantastic breakfast here    We had the Chulupas with chorizo  egg and jalape os.  Banana bread is so yummy too.  Absolutely amazing   Great way to take a break with peaceful picnic benches.  Highly recommend.
Sopa De Fideo,24,Great food  great service.  Awesome food truck area in between Jollyville and 183.  Highly recommend 
Sopa De Fideo,25,Very very delicious    I had carnitas and asada corn taco with sopas - it was very delicious and fast.  The picnic area is a fun place to sit and enjoy your meal.  I would definitely recommend to anyone 
Sopa De Fideo,26,I ran into this place while getting my car inspected and now I m going back for the food. Service is great  the breakfast chalupas are excellent  even the coffee was quite good 
Sopa De Fideo,27,This place is hidden on a street  Hamilton  that I  never knew even existed that is  right after the Shell Station before the Randall s off of 183. The food is awesome  The biscuit sandwiches and breakfast tacos were really good  the service was quick  the staff was nice  and you can sit outside on some socially distanced picnic tables and eat there if you want. You can tell the salsa and jams that come with your order are home made. We will definitely be back 
Sopa De Fideo,28,Soooooo good. Had the potato bean egg breakfast tacos and hands down best I ve had in quite a while. Very packed taco full of delicious goodness. Homemade flour tortilla  yay  Flavor of the beans and the amount they use  as in not too much to overwhelm  really makes this a delight to eat.  Staff is SUPER nice and the hot salsa is HOT and SO good. Will definitely be a repeat.
Taco Cabana,1,Taco Cabana is clearly fast food  but unlike national chains  tortillas are made in-house  the salsas are as well. Those tortillas--so soft  somewhat chewy  never disappointing.  My shredded chicken taco was surprisingly good  The flour tortilla hugged the shredded chicken  tomatoes  cheese  and lettuce. It was delightfully moist.  The chicken was nicely seasoned--this isn t  white people  watered-down seasoning. By the end  chicken was falling out--too much in the taco  I was very happy with my it. And yes  I will be back when I want a quick taco fix 
Taco Cabana,2,Do not go here. Bad restaurant. I ordered for pickup using DoorDash. When I arrived I parked in one of the spaces with sign saying it was for online order pickups. I called the number on the sign and after 30 rings no one answered. I redialed the number - no answer. So  I knocked on the door and the woman inside ignored me and then looked up scowling and waved me off. Finally  a man I took to be a line supervisor or day manager opened the door. When I asked why they had not answered the phone  he replied.  Well  we re real busy.  I said well  I am a customer too and one who had already paid for his food. Then  insult to injury  the order was wrong. I had ordered 4 salsas  I got none. I  had ordered 4 corn tortillas  I got two flour tortillas. I ordered 3 refried beans and 1 rice and got 2 of each.  This is not how you run a business. Get lunch somewhere else.
Taco Cabana,3,While visiting Austin I stopped in here just to try the queso and boy was it good  It s a nice little fast food spot near a shopping center and is great for a quick bite. Service was super fast and the food was delish  Stop by here if you re in the area and looking for a yummy meal 
Taco Cabana,4,They forgot my son s cheese quesadilla and served me the wrong enchiladas -which by the way were extremely salty. The dining room is a mess and it s well past the lunch rush. Their disposable straws are dirty and discolored as if drinks had been spilled on them and eventually dried. Trays and table numbers are left out and floor unswept. Lastly  their staff are slow and move with no sense of urgency. I m sorry for dining in here with my family. Don t waste your time or money here.
Taco Cabana,5,I write this after some 20 visits in the past 6 months as I have to meet someone in this parking lot to pick up my dog after work.  There is zero management of this location.   Literally 20 out of 20 visits they leave something off my order  if they even have what I want to order in stock.  The people working have bad attitudes and they just don t put the food together as the menu shows.  I have gone to the one by the domain and it is amazing- the food comes out as taco cabana should be and it s great.  The food at this one is the worst I ve ever had and it s all due to the employees and management working here.   This location is either being used as a front for drug dealing or will be out of business in a month or two- it s really that bad.  I would say negative 5 stars if I could.  I want to add  the guy on the grill is the common link- I ve seen a bunch of people come and go but he is always there and his attitude seems to leach into everyone else.  IThey all just do the least possible to get the food out.  If anyone cared  it would have been fixed months ago- I keep trying again only to be immensely disappointed time and time again. I ve asked my elderly parents about their visits and they said the same thing  they leave vital ingredients out of the order.  If you order quesadillas  you will get your quesadilla but no sour cream  guacamole or pico.  If you order a taco salad  it will come in a bowl with some broken up tortilla strips and some lettuce and maybe a little cheese- nothing else.  I could go on and on about the ridiculousness that goes on here but I ll spare you - just find somewhere else to eat.  ANYWHERE ELSE IS BETTER  
Taco Cabana,6,I waited for a while and no one took my order. They were just stranding talking to each other. Don t recommend dine in.
Taco Cabana,7,I recommend Taco Cabana at this location only  reason being  their staff  workers know how to make your orders taste   premium  and not fast food taste ... I LIVE IN ROUND ROCK AND DRIVE TO THIS LOCATION.
Taco Cabana,8,Wish I would have looked at the rating before ordering. Hard to understand the person taking my order. It sounded like she had the mic almost in her mouth. I pull up and she repeats my order which was correct. I get home to find that she didn t include one of my meals.   I usually go to a different Taco Cabana but I will not be returning to this one.
Taco Cabana,9,Honestly if it wasnt for beyond meat I would LITERALLY NEVER come here. Always rude  even when their out they are rude to me    Order is always wrong  staff is always rude  and they are usually out of beyond meat but I wouldnt know because they refuse to answer phones... managed restaurants for over 6 years  amp  can not understand how the GM here can continually accept below PAR customer service.. even if your understaffed  you can find many ways to provide excellent customer service. CAN YOU PLEASE GET A STAFF THAT GIVES AF SO I CAN GET MY TACOS FROM A PLACE CLOSE TO HOME       Tired of driving 20 mins from home just to get a decent taco served by someone that actually cares
Taco Cabana,10,Don t know what s happened to Taco Cabana  but this location has gone downhill big time.  We visited in 2020 during Covid and they had a very limited menu  which was understandable and the food was ok.  Our visit yesterday  August 12 2021 was worse- trying to order and they didn t have anything we wanted.  Finally settled on something . Heard they guy who took our order tell the other employee to put it in the microwave     Tortillas were old and dry  retried beans definitely weren t fresh  and my chicken fajita taco was a measly couple of strips of dry chicken on a sad tortilla.  My husband s cheese enchiladas   he wanted beef   but no beef in restaurant    were again sad tortillas with a little melted cheese.  This is our last time to visit this location. Far better fast Mexican food .
Taco Cabana,11,I ve been wanting to try this place for about a year because there is ALWAYS a line of cars. I figured it must be great despite the reviews. Well no...I was horribly wrong. I went inside to find a dead cricket next to the registers  chicken laying EVERYWHERE  and more messes. The menu boards were broken  the floor was filthy  the bathroom sink was falling off of the wall  one stall was out of order and the whole place looked like it hadn t been cleaned in 3 years. But I still ordered. I got the shredded chicken taco plate. Rice is so bland. The refried beans had the hard edges mixed in and the chicken was oily as frick. DO NOT EAT FROM HERE. I immediately felt sick and have been for the last hour. I don t know how they are still in business. Someone shut them down
Taco Cabana,12,Avoid at all costs. Nope. Between sweaty and angry cashier and overwhelmed manager you are guaranteed to have a poor experience. No napkins. No one busing tables. Salsas are request only. Order mix-up. Hygiene was also a general issue. Nope.
Taco Cabana,13,I ve been to this location twice in the past couple of weeks during the pandemic.  This location  hands down  is the worst drive through in Austin.  And outside of a few poorly run small town fast food locations  probably the worst drive through I can remember.  Let s count the problems.  SLOW.  As in glacially slow.  On the first visit  the order itself was accurate. Except none of the salsas we requested were in the bag.  Had to drive back around through the same drive-through to request salsa again -- which they argued about. And even on the second trip to request salsa  I still didn t get all that I asked for.  Yesterday s visit   I ordered two steak fajita tacos.  The exact same fajita tacos I ve ordered for 35  years.  They came out with lettuce and tomato on them.  They ve never had that on them.  Nor did I request them.  This time I was able to go inside the location to tell them.  They were nice enough to apologize and fix the correct order.  Again -- no salsa.  Finally  on both visits  the drive through team are all sullen  if not outright unpleasant..  It s obvious that the team at this Taco Cabana are very unhappy and they re taking it out on the customers.    Go elsewhere. Anywhere else.
Taco Cabana,14,Placed an online order for 3 breakfast boxes and it showed the order would be ready at 6 29.  6 45 and still not ready.  It looks like there are maybe 2 people inside.  I understand the help situation is bad  but make a business decision stop taking online orders and handle the drive-thru.  I pulled through the drive-thru at 6 50 and they seemed to have forgotten about the order.  The lady at the window said they only had one person come in and they just showed up.  How have they served over 20 cars at the drive-thru then    she asked me to pull back into the parking lot and she would bring it out in 2-3 minutes.  8-minutes later the food arrives.  No offer for a discount or anything.    i am calling on Taco Cabana to shut down this location  transfer the hard working individuals to locations that need help and take care of your customers and associates.  If TC is trying to lose customers  they have succeeded with losing me.
Taco Cabana,15,Very disappointed   I tried this location after I had 2 awful experiences at the location by where I live.  I give up.  I have gift cards from corporate  but I won t even use them.  Don t waste your time or money   
Taco Cabana,16,Terrible service kid on phone hung up on me mid sentence. Tear this terrible restaurant down already. They ve had their lobby under construction for 6 months. No one s educated enough to fix it obviously.
Taco Cabana,17,Not sure what I just attempted to eat  but it was not good. I threw out my whole order after the second bite  the taco bowl tasted like an ashtray mixed with propane and the street taco meat looked like it took a dubious turn toward a non binary mystery meat.  Fingers crossed I don t get sick from the two bites I had. I will not be returning to taco cabana in this life or the next.
Taco Cabana,18,HORRIBLE place. We ordered two tacos one beef and one chicken and they completely screwed up our order and gave us a box of guacamole  cheese and lettuce.. thanks for ruining my dinner and the sad thing is that I didn t notice until I got home because I trusted they would be able to take my order and hand me what I ORDERED. I was completely mistaken  don t go here the workers are incompetent.
Taco Cabana,19,Been waiting on my order for almost 15 minutes this is ridiculous no other customers were waiting or here so why is it still taking so long to give me this damn order the people are nice but that means jack if the service isn t there
Taco Cabana,20,Not much unexpected from this Taco Cabana.  It s location is convenient to nearby shopping at US Hwy 183 and Capitol of Texas Hwy   360.  It s our usual morning stop if we stay in nearby hotels as it is convenient and fast service.  Attentive staff at the register  never an issue with order accuracy or expedition.  A nice clean dining room with a TV  plus outside space to sit.  As you would expect from TC.  A nice touch these days that they bring the orders out to you.  Some minor issues experienced at times  the condiment bar was not fully stocked  out of things  and had to ask to be refilled.  Once the coffee carafe had cold coffee  Sunday morning mind you .  Both these were fixed when we asked.  Another time they were short staffed in the back and when we came in  they immediately apologized and said there would be a 20 minute delay  and asked if we still wanted to order .  Nothing major  just minor things.
Taco Cabana,21,I wish I could give this place zero stars. For some stupid reason I ve stopped at this location more than a couple of times  and EVERY TIME  my order is wrong. I sure hope the employees aren t wanting  15 hr  or worse actually making that  because they sure as hell don t actually do their jobs. The cherry on top  they just give some measly fake apology and no effort what so ever to fix the problem. Of course  they offer for me to get back out and come get the correct item  but I usually have hungry kids who don t want to stop eating  and shouldn t have to  to go fix the problem these idiots made. Complete imbeciles   
Taco Cabana,22,First time at a taco cabana  I really enjoyed the food. It was tasty and just what I was hoping for. The service was prompt and staff was friendly. An individual named Vincent served my wife and I with a smile and wished us a blessed day. I will definitely be coming back 
Taco Cabana,23,Horrible drive through service.  I have to go inside EVERY time I am foolish enough to think they may have hired someone who knows how to read what I paid for.   Order never comes out right and they always say i drove away.
Taco Cabana,24,Crap  trying to change their location info. They close early and employees don t care. You never know when they are open or closed. Don t Bother. Really obvious employees leave early or sleep in.
Taco Cabana,25,Went into this restaurant.  1 49pm 06-13-2020  Before hand..Placed online order. Then..Walked into the store forgetting my mask...Was told to get a mask when the dine in of this restaurant had none. I was refused service after going to get my mask and also told the cops where getting called by the manager.. who was running  Taco Cabana  store unsanitary   osha
Taco Cabana,26,Running short on time  decided to break my COVID rule and give Taco Cabana a try. Order at drive through  pay and drive off. Get home to find I just spent  15 on 4 corn tortillas with two strips of skirt steak each. Wow.   During times like this restaurants should be going out of there way for customers. Instead Taco Cabana is doing just the opposite.   Never was much of a fan but this is the last time Taco C. I ll be giving my business to those who want it.   Good luck.  Clint
Taco Cabana,27,Apparently they can t make a quesadilla with corn tortilla. I asked if it was possible and the reply was that they  stopped doing that a week ago because it wastes a lot of time.  Then proceeded to get my order wrong.
Taco Cabana,28,Ah Taco Cabana  how I adore thee.  I ll admit that my trips to Taco Cab rarely occurred during daylight hours  but no matter when I go  it s always solid.    For a fast food taco joint  this place is hands  feet  knees and elbows down better than Taco Bell.  It s in a dead heat with Bueno  but the fresh tortillas really make it awesome.    My personal favorites include   soft chicken tacos  cabana bowls  barbacoa tacos  any of the breakfast tacos  enchilada meals  pretty much anything you get there is good.    Folks are friendly... the outdoor patio will do  amp  the service  including the drive thru  is quick.
Taco Cabana,29,I don t mind process. But today I wanted a beer with lunch. I m 50.   We had to do these steps   1  Ask if it was alcohol 2  Create a line while we got the manager 3  Scan the drivers license 4  Swipe the drivers license  Sorry Cabana  I won t return.
Taco Cabana,30,This place has been providing such a great pick-me-up and easy quick bean amp cheese breakfast before work. It is one of my favorite north west Austin locations. The employees are always friendly and are doing a great job with the new sanitary requirements.
Taco Cabana,31,Love a good taco cabana margarita but we ordered a few frozen margs today and they were not frozen in the slightest. I m pretty disappointed that nobody was upfront about their machine not working when we ordered our drinks. Flavor was nice  but it needed ice.
Taco Cabana,32,Where to begin....I went inside. I like to be able to order face to face....and frankly  load up on salsa. I m in town from DFW where TC is hard to find. Anyway I walk in...nothing  I need to be and should be recognized  No one at the counter  one lady cranking out  to go orders  two young men standing around not doing much an older man warming tortillas. ..there in lies the problem  Someone needs to greet the in store paying customer not just the drive thru crowd  I stood patiently for 5 full minutes. Nothing an employee even came our of the restroom..we made eye contact but she offered to greeting. At this I left and went to Rudy s were I was greeted  tacos are ready to go and I spent  50...more than TC but worth the cost. A manager needs to step up at this TC or it will be empty like the TCs in DFW.
Taco Cabana,33,Two days in a row 2 11 21 and 2 12 21 I ve came here for breakfast on the way to work and waited in the drive through for a very long time. Not sure whats going on but this location has to be the worst one in Austin. I recommend you take yourself elsewhere.
Taco Cabana,34,A few weeks ago I bought enchiladas. They served it without any sauce over the enchiladas. The cheese inside tortilla was hard. I guess they had it lying around. I couldn t eat it. Yes  went thru the horrible drive-thru.
Taco Cabana,35,The worst in service  people and food.  Disgusting swill.  If you re in the mood for some abuse and people who will prepare your food with bout regard for your experience... this is your place 
Taco Cabana,36,I ordered a margarita at 926 and they refused it. They said nothing 30 minutes to close  which it was not. I ordered their big special menu item  barbacoa nachos and the kid said they didn t carry them while I was staring at the giant sign advertising it in their drive thru. Bad service. Food was edible. F- on my first taco cabana experience.
Taco Cabana,37,Waited in the drive tru for ten minutes at the window.  No one ever greeted me or say sorry for the wait. I never got my food. Horrible customer service.
Taco Cabana,38,Those happy hour prices are the bomb.  I had food and drinks here.  The service helped me through the new menu options.
Taco Cabana,39,Seems like something is wrong with my order every time I go through the drive thru.  I got a taco plate combo.  They gave me my bag and drink.  Got home and there was no rice and beans.  I called them.  Audrey said she is in charge.  She was rude.  Maybe they were busy and she was dealing with some restaurant anxiety.    Either way my option was to drive back tonight or come get free rice and beans tomorrow.  I said I would like the entire meal replaced if I come back because my tacos will be cold.  She said no.   Also  they quit serving ground beef for a while during Covid.  That s understandable.  My guess is they are now using a cheaper ground beef.  It s not very good.  It used to be excellent.   Taco Cabana should put a new management team in this location or close it.
Taco Cabana,40,Decent fast food tacos  although the salsa bar is pretty good by any standards. The raw onions and limes that came with my tacos were fresh  and you can see the corn tortillas being made by a machine inside. I didn t like the flour tortillas  and the tables were extremely dirty.
Taco Cabana,41,Literally the worst experience I have ever had. They made my order wrong. I went through the drive through and ordered a Beyond bowl I drove home and realized they put sour cream and cheese on it when it s not supposed to come with any of those items I couldn t eat any Of it as I m allergic to diary. I called and the manager on duty said they could not give me a refund. Stay away from this place. They don t care about your food.
Taco Cabana,42,I am soooo disappointed... 2 TACO CABANAS in less than 15 minutes with the worst experience.  First off I came into the lobby to order from the rain from driving from another taco cabana that said they had no flautas again  Corner of Mopac  than the kid with birthmark scar on his face that is taking my order gives me the look like he s annoyed with his job or something... he walks over to the register stands there and said nothing..no greeting just nothing...So I Ordered 2 Flauta plates which I m happy they have flautas go home and open our Togo containers and wow...it gets worse...  The refried beans were runny  the rice was cold and bland and the flautas were extremely over cooked. They didn t even bother to put lettuce and Guacamole like I we always get.   We were craving this all day and it was just flat out ruined. I now checked the hours for both locations and it makes more since now. I come from Houston where taco cabana is open 24hrs...these 2 locations are not  9605 Research Blvd Austin  TX  78759  12525 N Mo Pac Expy Austin  TX  78727-4226  Obviously the experience was bad because they were more eager to close down then to serve food.. I ll never go to either one of these locations they re both a joke.   Just a heads up if you like FLAUTAS don t go to either one of these locations. MOPAC always  runs out  and RESEARCH will do just as worse...serve you over cooked food with no flavor  watered down and cold crap.
Taco Cabana,43,I ve been going to Taco Cabana for 30 years. But this particular location is the worst  I just ordered two Carne Guisada tacos.  Every piece of meat inside the first taco I opened was far and gristle - serious gristle  I m afraid to open the second one. Don t come here for good food and don t come here for good service   you won t get it .  Especially don t expect one hot sauce per taco that seems to be too tall an order for this location.  They gave one half-filled container for 3 tacos and when I asked for 2 more  she gave me 1  then shut window.  Wow 
Taco Cabana,44,Well here we go again. I know it has been several months since my last entry however I again went to the taco cabana at 9605 Research and things went wrong on my daughter and my order. Order   178  I ordered the trio sampler again for my daughter and I. At first the cashier Ismael began to order nachos  I explained no I want the trio sampler that is 10.99 each. He cleared the order  proceeded to start again. He then orders me the trio for 7.99  I repeated the order and he assured that it was the right trio. When the meal arrived I asked another associate  where is the chips  and they put in the bag guacamole. I am again allergic to avocados. So is my daughter  so I make sure that it is on my receipt each time for my safety. When I was ready to talk to the manager in Pink  two other customers went back to the register and requested their orders to be cancelled  and refunded. When i got home the chicken quesadilla were hard and the taquitos tasted tough  kinda hard to bite into.  For several months things have been better since my last review  but tonight it was a reverse. It was like they went back to the horrible way. I don t like to complain about things  but I don t understand why it is so hard to get a order right and cook it correctly  I was willing to pay the correct amount but finding out that the order was placed wrong after 2 times of having to repeat the order  it is just bad service. I hope this review goes to the manager to get things ship shape better for future orders. I enjoy going to taco cabana with my daughter as a girl lunch or dinner but I guess I am having to return to the other locations again until things are better.
Taco Cabana,45,I love the food here  and I had great customer service today from Rueben. He made a special effort to make sure I received my order and was happy with it. Thank you Rueben 
Taco Cabana,46,Me and my family stood in line for a good 5-10 minutes with no one in front waiting to get our order taken. After  we waited around 20 minutes. When we finally got our food our chips and queso was missing and the worker kept cussing and had no gloves as well as kept touching his hair and hat while making the tacos. Lastly  when I went to bite into my taco there was a spiky hard thing I don t know what it is but certainly not food. I will definitely not be coming back to this location.
Taco Cabana,47,Decided to try their enchilda special.   HUGE MISTAKE   They are so hard  you can t even cut them.  I thought that at least I could have some bean and rice taco  but the cashier did not give me any tortillas  even though they are supposed to come with the plate.   Just wasted  8.
Taco Cabana,48,Disappointed on today s service. What is the point of  skipping the line. Order Online or by phone   -that right there is on their bag promoting the clause...if they aren t going to make the food til you get there anyways    Called in my order at 9 00am and I showed up 10-15 minutes later to pick it up and the food was not ready. They just begun to prepare it once I arrived and told them that I was there for a pick up...smh
Taco Cabana,49,This location serves bacon and egg tacos with RAW bacon.  Not cooked  not even a little.  Unsanitary and hard to believe such a simple order could be delivered so poorly.  It wasn t fast either  our order inexplicably took 25 minutes to come out with us the only customers in the building  and no one in the drive through.  No apologies from the staff for the long wait  the raw bacon in the tacos  or the missing salsa we ordered.
Taco Cabana,50,The ignorance of this place is beyond my understanding....every time I go there they get my order wrong and the attitude they have if you complain. How can you not care for your customers and trying fix the problem. I don t get it but I won t be coming back to you r place again.
Taco Cabana,51,Probably the worst of the area Taco Cabana s with regard to customer  service .  They are typical in the SLOWWWWW moving drive thru of all the Taco Cabana s  about 3 or 4 times the wait at a typical Taco Bell .  The most annoying part is the stupidity of the management  manager  regarding serving of the alcohol to go.  I literally waited 20 minutes in line only to be told  we stop serving alcohol at 9 30 PM .  It was exactly 9 40 when I got to the window.  I argued for another 10 minutes while the manager on duty called his  boss  to eventually agree to SELL ME A MARGARITA     The last STRAW was today  8-25-20 when I ordered a taco and margarita  you HAVE to order food with a drink .  After I paid and was handed the cup  I said I needed a straw to drink it.  The girl at the window said  we do not give straws with ALCOHOL drinks .  WHAAAT     The manager chimes in behind her that people mix their drinks and then drink them with a straw....well  YEAH  that is sort of the idea.... These people are NUTS   Since when is it their job to determine how or where or when people consume the items they buy at the drive-thru   This arbitrary nonsense used to harass the customer goes over the top.  When I asked for my usual water to go with my order  they complained I only wanted it for the straw....like they would know that I ALWAYS get water to drink with my meals.  Avoid this place....
Taco Cabana,52,I give this location 5 stars for quick and friendly counter service and an excellent Salsa Bar.  The black bean tacos on corn tortillas are a healthier option when I m on the go and close to my office.  They make fresh tortillas all day.  For whatever reason these choices don t make me gain weight.  I ve been a fan of TC for a while and watched their quality go up and down over the years.  I think that now that the family squabbling has subsided and the franchise has stabilized with time  their food quality has become very good and predictable.  I can stop by any TC and expect good food at a reasonable price.  Once I had one of their margaritas and it was surprisingly potent.  TC is a great faster food Tex-Mex option from Good Ole Folks in San Antonio 
Taco Cabana,53,The most disgusting enchilada EVER   They literally put cheese and chili sauce on a rolled up tortilla. Had a couple of the fajita chicken tacos which were good. Their regular tacos are horrible. Their breakfast tacos are ok. The food here overall here is not good at all  with the exception of the fajita chicken tacos 
Taco Cabana,54,I have had multiple bad encounters. The first they gave me 3 of 4 tacos I ordered and the drive thru guy was rude. As I was putting my card away in my wallet he had the bag out the window and said  uh here  in the most annoyed voice. This morning  I get my tacos and I asked for two salsas. On salsa was almost empty like someone had used it already AND there was a piece of receipt IN MY DRINK. Terrible.  Upside food is always delicious when it s right.
Taco Cabana,55,Poor service.  They lied and said they didn t have queso. We ask how long was the wait then they changed and said oh we have it. But then one guy tried to give me cold queso but the other guy said no and to warm it. They thought it was funny.  They got the order wrong too.  They forgot items and argued when I asked for them after.  The manager did not care about any of the mistakes and didn t make and eye contact or express any concern about our poor service and wrong order.
Taco Cabana,56,Seems pointless to review a fast food type place like this but wanted to point out how bad their online ordering and pickup service is. Ordered 2 chorizo egg tacos and two fajita tacos. Arrived about 20 minutes later for a 5 minute order usually. I ve been waiting here for 40 minutes with the only explanation being that  they re working on it. 
Taco Cabana,57,We went in for a quick snack  with our rowdy kids  and they were super fast and SUPER polite nice  even to our messy kids  .  Solomon  good looking younger black guy  was SUPER nice with a friendly smile    he took our order and even cleaned up some of the mess  that I missed  at our table as we were leaving.  Solomon is the main reason that I am writing this review.  HE made our stay visit very enjoyable  as we were waiting for a ride  since our minivan broke down at The Container Store next door.  It was a VERY cold windy night and the beef cheese and bean   cheese tacos really hit the spot     Thank you Solomon  and the cooking staff    .  Deeeelicious   
Taco Cabana,58,This location hustles  Kept the drive thru moving  amp  took care of every guest that decided to dine in. Stacy  amp  Jacob both greeted me in a reasonable amount of time. My order came out within minutes..  correct        Thank you gentlemen. God bless   
Taco Cabana,59,7 05 am  October 18th.  Sat at the drive thru speaker for 5 minutes  completely ignored.  then pulled up to the the window thinking maybe they just had missed the drive through signal on their radio  etc. so nope...they were open  they were inside cooking  sort of...mostly just goofing off....but totally blew me off and then the guy behind me as well.  Never came to the window  just ignored me and the person behind me as if they were closed. They were NOT.  Seriously  The least you can do is open your window and say you are temporarily closed or are experiencing difficulties  but nope  the d-bags in there just blew us off like they were closed and were laughing about it. I am not that hard to please  just a couple tacos and I am on my way  no big deal...but to blatantly ignore and ridicule people who are simply waiting in the drive thru line -- you know the people who give your business money   This store s manager should be fired.  They have lost a very repeat customer as a result  I buy a LOT of tacos for my employees each week  looks like Rudy s from now on...way better anyway . Great job Taco Cabana idiots 
Taco Cabana,60,Midnight  pipe burst in restaurant and no manager to help. Seems like all the Taco cabanas are going down hill. Hopefully someone moves in to replace them soon.
Taco Cabana,61,First time coming to a Taco Cabana and I was greeted very well. Everything was clean and pretty. Didn t have a hard time with anyone and employee checked up on us to see if we needed everything. Food was awesome  super delicious will definitely come back.
Taco Cabana,62,My few Taco Cabana experiences in Austin several years ago were so terrible that I stopped going for a long time--until recently.  This location was a pretty good experience   Pros  - Warm lighting gives cozy ambience - Not too cold like some places - Flat screen TV - Upbeat music in background - Lots of seating - Nice wooden rectangular tables - Lots of smaller two person tables - Outdoor patio to eat at - Nice salsa bar with cilantro and 5 salsas - Cashier smiled and greeted me - One of the best Taco Cabana experiences in Austin - Cheerful bright paint and wall decorations - Quick access from the 183 service road  Cons  - Ice machines out of ice - Not many customers inside  there were only two parties  me and another person 
Taco Cabana,63,Well my first experience going to a taco Cabana and they messed it all up I ordered 5 steak and cheese tacos and got 5 bean and cheese taco on top of that I waited 15 mins for two guys that hated their jobs to make my food.  trash experience and terrible customer service wish I could get my money back
Taco Cabana,64,Went through the drive through because I was hungry while shopping. The man who was working in the window was very passive aggressive and rude. Makes me not want to drive through or come back ever again to this location.
Taco Cabana,65,I have been going to this Taco Cabana for years  as a last resort   and they have always served the worst value in town BUT tonight I went by and the food was awesome  . The servings were no  mover meager and they even through in a few sides  . It is the Taco Cabana I remember from the 80 s  maybe they kicked out all the MBAs that were turning the servings into a chinch of hard meat with a smear of guacamole .
Taco Cabana,66,Who doesn t like quesadillas   I went to this place on my way out of Austin and since they area always quick and accurate on my order I gave them another try.  As expected  the food was on point and I will be back next time I m in Austin.  Thanks for the good food and quick service.
Taco Cabana,67,This location had friendly service  was very clean  and the salsa bar was stocked full 
Taco Cabana,68,My first time at this location   the employee   161708 I don t like it call her by    she was so friendly and make the time to get my order right. The only problem when they make the tacos they need to used a measure portion control   one of my tacos had so little potatoes and eggs. Hope you fixed the problem.
Taco Cabana,69,My first - and last - visit to this Taco Cabana. I ordered chicken and received beef  but asking me to stand by the counter and wait while they remade my order was insulting  made worse by the lack of any apology. Worst of all the restaurant was dirty  trash on the floor in the customer area and - why I will never return - trash and food on the floor in the kitchen and prep areas that I could see from the counter.
Taco Cabana,70,This location is near and dear to my heart.  My fiancee and I made this  our place.   When I am in Austin  you ll find us sitting on the patio by ourselves  we ve been here several times and we always chill on the patio alone somehow   sipping margaritas  and doing work on tacos.  The staff is always kind and friendly.  Food s always good.  Definitely come through if you re on the north syeed 
Taco Cabana,71,I love Taco Cabana  but this location is awful  they had no meat when I ordered  had to wait for it to be cooked. I was told it would take 15 minutes. Ordered at 3 20 and walked out at 4 15. Everyone who ordered after me  got their food and are gone. I just ordered fajitas....
Taco Cabana,72,the customer service is terrible     they never get my order correct. and wronly ring me for items
Taco Cabana,73,It was lunchtime when I was in the Arboretum area recently  sans credit cards and with only  3 in cash.  What to do   Where to eat   Taco Cabana came to the rescue.  For a grand total of  2.79  I had a tasty and relatively healthy meal of two soft beef tacos  marinated ground beef  shredded cheddar cheese  fresh lettuce and tomatoes  soft flour tortillas.      Their complimentary fresh salsa bar is a nice bonus.
Taco Cabana,74,I love coming here  I m at this taco cabana at least 3 times a week and the really tall gentleman at the front Register I think his name is Raymond. He always is so friendly and is super welcoming 
Taco Cabana,75,i wish i could give them zero stars my boyfriend and i each had a bean and cheese taco and an egg cheese and potato taco this morning  all we ve eaten at all today  around 10 30am and now we are both insanely sick and have been throwing up for several hours.  i wish i could somehow get our money back
Taco Cabana,76,I m really surprised that this location gets any bad reviews   When we first walked in we were greeted with a very friendly and positive staff.  This is rare I must say at any other location   The food was exceptional   I can t believe how good the food was....I was like   Is this really Taco Cabana    I guess I m used to sub par food at other sites.  Bravo to this location   I will drive out of my way to come visit you.    
Taco Cabana,77,I just went to Taco Cabana tonight  July 13th . Sullivan was working by himself he did fantastic at getting our order correct  prompt and delicious. We wanted to make sure that his job well done was recognized 
Taco Cabana,78,I d say I got what I expected for a  5 drive through burrito. Obviously not incredible food but cheap  easy  and better than Taco Bell.
Taco Cabana,79,Taco Cabana is one of my favorite go-to s however today  I have to give a negative review regarding my food. I am not the type to write a bad review on fast food because I understand how demanding the industry can be. I ordered the super nachos with chicken and had to pick out the chicken because it looked strange as if it were old  or just not cooked well. Then  when I finished my cheese and beans nachos  I found a grey hair in my food  I threw up  understandably  I wish the workers would wear hair nets.
Taco Cabana,80,Perfect place for late night breakfast taco jonesing. I am a fan of their tortillas   Definitely the best Mexican fast food  with a drive through  that I can think of.
Taco Cabana,81,The night crew freakin  rocks  They are always courteous  very clean  and very friendly and professional. They have never gotten my order wrong. I go 3 1 2 miles out of my way to go to this location when I am going to taco cabana between the hours of 1 AM and 6 AM because I know the night crew there does such a good job
Taco Cabana,82,I am really angry  I ordered lunch for my daughter and I today and the delivery was great  but the food was horrible. I had order   563065278  Chicken Flautas Plate in the instructions I requested NO Guacamole and no beans due to my allergies. When the food arrived it had both items in the Togo box. I am very allergic. In the order on top of it I asked for chips and Queso  that never was received. It took me 5 times to call the restaurant to inform a manager Mary of this concern. She in return told me that I would have a credit for the meal and chips. What I am angrier about is that I could not eat my meal due to my allergies and nothing was sent to me in the replacement. I had to simply throw it away since my daughter has the same allergies. We are allergic to avocadoes and red beans. When I opened my bad that had my tortilla shells the shells were kinda hard  and the little packs of condiments leaked. So my lunch was a huge mess  I am really angry I gave this taco cabana place a shot and they failed. I don t go to the one on 183 and the capital of Tx Hwy due to the matter that they can not understand my allergic concerns. I am not happy with finding out that I have a credit for 7 days at this location to come to get food when I have no car. This is why I requested a delivery. When I tried to call the customer service number 877-822-2262  all it did was ring  ring  and more ringing. No one was answering the lines. I hope I hear from a Real Manager ASAP 
Taco Cabana,83,I live in the apartments nearby and get food from here every week.  Taco Cabana is the best Mexican fast food. I love everything about the food and being able to sit outside. Staff is always pretty nice. Even the drive thru staff is wonderful and makes sure you got salsa.
Taco Cabana,84,Visited this place for a late dinner  around 11 00 pm. Everything was so clean. The salsa bar was full and clean. The food was good for fast food  and loved the sopapilla s   The staff was friendly  and service was fast.
Taco Cabana,85,I am not a hard person to please  but this place was kinda gross. My friend and I have been here on numerous of occasions and while the customer service is always pleasant  the presence of roaches somehow couldn t be smoothed over. We were told they were  from the palm tree and were looking to come inside cause they were bored  .  Look  for a super late meal  we aren t expecting 4star quality...we are definitely not expecting roaches as well. Again  the customer service was  great 
Taco Cabana,86,Writing this from the parking lot because my experience was just that bad. I ordered  everything seemed fine. Got to the window  and the girl had to ask me my order 4 different times. Each time I corrected her with the full order. Each time she repeated it back incorrectly. Either she wasn t listening  or she was high on something. That s what it seemed like at least. Immediately after asking me what my drink was. And immediately after me telling her a Dr Pepper  she asked once again if I got a drink. Hadn t even been 20 seconds since I told her. SHE STILL GAVE ME THE WRONG DRINK  The organization and service was so low that I m surprised they re still operating with that bullshit. I ve worked in fast food before  and I m very aware that low expectations should be held. Even so. This experience was a total shit show and the girl at the window should be making food or cleaning tables  not dealing with customers. I wanted to go a step above Taco Bell  but Taco Bell s service is undoubtably superior. Extremely frustrating and disappointing.
Taco Cabana,87,I just went in at midnight because I have a terrible stomach bug and wanted a Sprite and some plain bean tacos. I couldn t find my card and it was very obvious that I do not feel well and was panicked about not having my card in my wallet so the super sweet woman at the drive thru just let me have it for free. I don t know her name but she had red hair and absolutely made my night. Thank you red haired lady you re great. And the bean tacos were great as well as the Sprite.
Taco Cabana,88,Sauce Nazi s.....and I know it s a fast food spot but a robotic personality that is unable to think outside of the box is just an irritating interaction. I ask for two large sauces to go with 4 tacos  he gives me two small ones  I see it and ask for two more which he gives me with a look on his face like I just asked him to go out back and dog for gold. Then I ask if they no longer have the  large sauces  and he says...I m only allowed to give you one small one per taco. But don t two small ones equate to one large one  And if they went over a little is that really a big deal  Especially when considering the fact that o specifically asked for that  I mean charge me the dollar for heavens sake. Really   Ugh..and their food sucks anyways. I just went there cause it s late. Anywayz...
Taco Cabana,89,Decent Taco Cabana food at this location. It is always hot and seasoned well  and I swear the beans are made with love. Fast food Mexican here beats most other Taco C locations in the city. Moreover  the staff is friendly and nice to all people who enter the doors. I witnessed this staff and their random acts of kindness for individuals less fortunate this evening. Very impressive. The company should be very proud of the humanitarians who work at this location.
Taco Cabana,90,I used to love taco c but last time i went here my quesidilla was undercooked and i didnt get any chips with my order of queso. Went back last night for a second chance. Never again. The guy taking my drive through order had trouble taking my order but was nice and i was just repeating my order when a rude woman cut me and him off and took over and basically told me i was ordering incorrectly. Ordered the large steak nachos. No guac no sour creme and burnt meat. Got a side of rice that was mush. Never again very dissapointed.
Taco Cabana,91,Being new to Austin  I m always looking for good fast food alternatives. My husband saw a commercial for Taco Cabana and suggested we give  em a try. The line was short. The couple in front of us were very friendly. Like my husband and I  they re from California. They lived in Austin for two years and love it here  which I must say is true for us too. They raved about the food and restaurants  including Taco Cabana. My husband ordered tacos  I ordered nachos. However  I m afraid the couple got it wrong. The nachos were awful  The presentation alone made me want to bounce outta the joint. The nachos had a processed cheesy liquid poured over them  not shredded cheese like the picture . The sauce reminded me of chili from a can  but worse.  No offense to Hormel . The nachos looked nothing like the photo. It looked like a sloppy mess. I didn t have my phone with me  forgot it at home  so I couldn t take a photo. I tasted it. Trust me when I tell you  the food was awful. I ve never given a one star review  but that place was a total waste of money. We tossed the food  my husband didn t like his either  and went to P. Terry s for a burger  which was quite good.
Taco Cabana,92,THE best drive through Mexican cuisine in the world.  I have lived in a couple other states and I so miss my TC when I m away   There is no better cure for a hangover or a late night munchie.  And they serve alcohol  how awesome is that.  Love love love my TC 
Taco Cabana,93,I wouldn t even give this place a star  but to make a review you must. This is the absolute worst place it eat if you have somewhere to be. Slow as possible  they redefine to words  fast food  bc it s not  The bathrooms and dining room is always filthy- which says alot about where your food comes from and how its prepared.. please please please get a new manager and staff or just shut the place down all together  
Taco Cabana,94,I ordered a meal last week in drive-thru. I checked the bag  amp  had to go inside due to some missing food. Once I got home  part of my meal was missing. I was tired  amp  hungry  so I wasn t driving back  but I called out of frustration.  Pointless  right   I spoke with a gentleman who stated he was the manager. He took my name down  offered to replace my entire meal    amp  stated he d leave it for another manger on duty to find. Well  I went in today  spoke with the Asst. GM Yessenia who stated she couldn t find my name  amp  informed me she was the only manager on duty that night. I m frustrated  again  as I m retelling my story. She had no record of any of my phone call. She could ve ignored my request  amp  thought nothing of it. Did she   Absolutely not  she replaced my entire order  amp  offered me a drink while I waited for my meal. Yessenia  thank you  you made my night  
Taco Cabana,95,They have literally messed-up our order on 4 of the last 5 times we ve been by there.  They re almost always out of items that are menu.  They advertise breakfast starting at midnight but they usually don t have it ready.  I went by at 12 46am and they haven t even started preparing breakfast items  that are on sale at midnight .  When they do have it they get the orders wrong. Then they laugh and giggle about not having things.
Taco Cabana,96,Horrible customer service. Took over 45 min to get two tacos. Staff didn t seem to care. Last time Coming to this location.
Taco Cabana,97,Taco Cabana used to be THE place to come for late-night tacos. But over the years it has declined in popularity  and here s why   Management has compromised food quality to increase its profit margin. For example  in the past  it s chicken fajita tacos consisted of fresh  boneless marinated chicken thighs grilled to perfection. Now  the same tacos are made from processed chicken meat grilled to mediocrity. The difference is evident in terms of taste. The present products pale in comparison to their predecessors.   Hopefully  management will realize the deterioration and restore the quality of the past. If not  I predict that Taco Cabana will be half its size  in terms of cafe numbers  in 5 years  time.   I
Taco Cabana,98,Maybe it s  cause I m from CA  but for cheap and tasty Tex-Mex  I always enjoy a lil TC.  No  I m not saying it s gourmet or the best Tex-Mex by far.  But when you are a drunken college student at 3 AM and almost nothing is open  a bunch of those soft flour tortillas with a tub of hot  melty queso really hits the spot.  For a meal  I like the steak fajita tacos combo best.  Then I may get an extra 1-2 tortillas and toss the whole foil-wrapped package in my purse to nibble on later  my friends mocked me  but I had a drunk snack later didn t I  .  This was one of my must-stops on my trip last weekend  and my best friend said the exact same thing when she arrived.  So as long as you stick with the tasty basics and don t expect stellar quality  you probably won t be disappointed.
Taco Cabana,99,I don t know if I would agree that this place is  gross   it tastes like any other Taco Cabana......  I love Taco Cabana  how often is it that you can get fresh fast-food  Not to mention that Taco Cabana makes some of the best tortillas in the world.....  If you are looking for fast Mexican  I would choose Taco Cabana over Taco Bell any day...... but then again  is that saying much 
Taco Cabana,100,When I first moved to Texas  I didn t understand the obsession with breakfast tacos.  Maybe because the first breakfast tacos I had in this state came from here.  Brown  rubbery egg curds  potato cubes with no natural qualities of a potato  and a wet tortilla that smelled strongly of musty dishrags. That horrible smell turned me off after just one bite.  If you ever see me in here  the only possible explanation is that I was bashed in the head so severely that I believe I m an alley cat  subsisting only on garbage.
Taco Cabana,101,Soft chicken taco is delish. Brisket taco looks like crap but still...tastes delish. Also  it s 2am. So maybe keep that in mind. Lol
Taco Cabana,102,I gotta say  I m a big Taco Cabana Fan.  Back when I lived in Montrose  party party  in Houston  I d stumble from seeing a show at a club to Taco Cabana to home.  All walking distance.  Perfection.  Then on Saturday morning s my work crew  reppin  WEPCo Shepherd  and I would often choose Taco Cabana as our weekend breakfast treat.  Now the next chapter of my love affair with Taco Cabana leads me to Austin where I go with my family to grab tacos at any time of day.  I can t comment on anything other than the bean and potato tacos.  Yes  BEAN and potato.  I can t complain about how many times I ve been given BEEF and potato or EGG and potato.  There are vegans in the world  people  and we eat beans.  I m still not sure if I completely believe that these tacos are vegan  but I ve asked staff at so many locations that I m taking their word for it.  What can I say about their bean and potato breakfast taco   It s good stuff  nothing special.  My husband and I can both eat for about  5 and feed our little mooch  aka 10 month old  little pieces of potato and beans from our tacos. 3 stars for a run of the mill taco.    1 more star for their killer condiment bar.  I can make my tacos a lot healthier which is really important to me.  I don t particularly feel proud of the consumption of flour tortillas or potatoes  but when I can load it with fresh raw veggies I feel like it makes up for a lot.  Here s what you do -  using their smaller containers as measurement  mix all 3 salsas in one of the plastic containers  they lack a balance of flavors separately - too smoky  too spicy  and too bland   dump that whole thing on your taco  top with another container full of pico de gallo  grab a whole mess of cilantro  maybe 1 3 cup    and sometimes a squirt of lime.  You can just barely close the taco  but it ll blow your mind - promise.
Taco Cabana,103,It s hard to give a star rating when most of your complaints have to do with service  not necessarily the food.  Is it me  or does the Taco Cabana near the Arboretum have the WORST customer service ever    For that matter  the Taco Cabana up on 183  just south of Anderson Mill is just as bad.  Why do the  customer service  reps have such bad attitudes at these places   Seriously.  if you can t provide REASONABLE customer service  then don t have a customer service job   It s that simple.  The food is decent at these places.  Well as decent as fast food Mexican can be.  It s a step above Taco Bell  but even Taco Bell usually has better service than Taco Cabana.  That s just plain SAD 
Taco Cabana,104,Now  this was my first time here  and I plan on giving them one more shot to hopefully up the rating  but for now  it is what it is.   So we went today for lunch after a trip to Golf Smith. Parking lot jammed pack and line almost out the door.  which is normal for every place around this area    Go in with friend  he waits in the 10 deep line. I proceed to go to restroom to wash hands. I will say this is probably the dirtiest nastiest restroom I have seen since driving through Alabama and stopping at what look like Deliverance style hang out. I almost felt as if I was going to get my hands dirtier using the sink then not washing them at all.   Go back out to stand with friend. Wait at least 5-7mins to finally get an order in. Go to find a place to sit  3 tables open  all of which are filthy and food on tables. 10-12 mins pass and our number is finally called. Rush to grab it  and oops wait  wrong order. Another 3 or so mins and PRESTO our order is finally here.   Hungrily is an understatement at this point  I open my tacos up. I have never had such horrible prepped tacos looks like they got splatted in there with a paintball gun. Nachos were sloppy  and chips stale.   All in all this was one of the more horrible experiences I have had at a TC including late night drunk times at Riverside one. I won t give a 1 as I feel that should happen to places that serve a finger or mouse as a nugget. I hope this was just a one time thing  but it doesn t look so.
Taco Cabana,105,Gross.  I m writing this for the visitors.  I understand that on occassion  you just need to grab something quick so you can go see the sites or do whatever else you ve got planned for the day.  If that s the case  avoid this place.  You d think it s just like Taco Bell or some other fast food Mexican chain.  But it s worse.  I couldn t tell if the meat was beef  pork  chicken  or rat.  Plenty of other choices. Go to Schlotzky s.
Taco Cabana,106,Used to be yummy.  But then I think they started buying bagged lettuce and their pico and salsa tastes like it is right out of the freezer.  Sometimes their tortillas are good but lately they have been too salty.  The first time I went to a T C was in San Antonio about 15 years ago and I loved the place.  I now think they just started buying too many prepared items.  Fajitas go boing when you eat them.  YUCK
Taco Cabana,107,To start with  I love TC. delicious food and usually great staff. I showed up close to closing time  11 45 and they close at 12 . Both workers rolled their eyes and were very aggravated as I ordered TO-GO. it took 25 minutes for two tacos and a quesadilla. I also ordered two sides of queso and said that the second one is usually forgotten. They said they would get it. After I waited I got my meal basically thrown at me and asked about the queso which they assured me it was in one of the bags. Got home and guess what.... only 1 queso. Yeah. I m the only one there and they can t get my order right. This is the worst location ever. The guy leaving right as I showed up had his order messed up. Then they messed mine up as I was the only one there. Don t go to this location.
Taco Cabana,108,I enjoy Taco Cabana. I am reviewing the customer service at this location.   1. The employees are apathetic. My order is never 100  correct.   2. It is the only location that does not make fajitas in the morning. If you order and receive fajitas  know that it is left over t from the night before.   3. When one orders coffee and asks for cream and sugar  they should receive a spoon to stir their coffee. I have never received a spoon and often I dont receive cream or sugar either.   4. The coffee itself is revolting.   There are many other locations nearby with exceptional customer service. Leave this location alone. Please heed my warning.
Taco Cabana,109,The food delivery was fast  correct and very fresh.  The staff was super friendly and seemed appreciative of our business.
Taco Cabana,110,Kids working At this store  they do not pay attention to what you order then your order gets messed up and needs to be redone  can t wait no more wasting time really  a subway would been. A lot better
Taco Cabana,111,I usually write reviews when I m unhappy. I m sitting in Taco Cabana watching and listening and this is the most friendly staff I have heard in a long time. I m surprised I m rating a Taco Cabana but I m really impressed. There s a guy specifically for clearing off the condiments bar and cleaning tables. The iced drink  beer  cooler thingy is fully stocked. They acknowledge everyone when they walk in and when they leave  sincerely  not in a fake manner. The food is just regular Taco Cabana fare.
Taco Cabana,112,Not much to say about this place.   It s a taco cabana so it s obviously delicious.  Problem is its a tad understaffed after around 8 00 making the service terrible.   Still  it s one of the only taco cabanas open late and you can t expect too much.  3 stars for the service. My unhealthy obsession with the 2 taco combo steak fajita will forever keep my rating of food quality at 5 stars.
Taco Cabana,113,I love their Fajita Nachos  Beware of their sweet tea  as it isn t southern style  it has  mango in it  yuck . I find everything else to be a few steps ahead of Taco Bell and it is a bit more in coin.
Taco Cabana,114,Taco Bell is better drunk food.  Don t visit Austin and go to Taco Cabana thinking you are about to eat the best Tex-Mex of your life...because you are not.  It s fast food Tex-Mex  except when you order a fajita steak burrito  all you get is two pieces of meat  or is it meat   and a tortilla.  At least Taco Bell has bettered my life with Meximelts   The taco bowl thing is OK  but everything else is best described as  blah.   Part of me feels silly for writing a review about a fast-food Texmex chain  but I just don t understand why some people enjoy this place  and why so many recommended it to me when I moved down to Austin.
Taco Cabana,115,1 stars because its fast food and it always tastes the same. Minuse 4 stars because of the crappy service and constant mistakes. Im always greeted really rudely and i always order the half pound of beef fajitas for take out. This time i ordered beef nachos and a beef enchilada plate as well. I m Waiting for 15 minutes when the cashier comes up to me and says they ran out of steak and they ask if i want chicken. I say no and he says its a 15 minute wait for steak and i say okay. 15 minutes late another worker comes up and says that they are now cooking the steak and it ll be 15 minutes. And i say okay. 25 minutes later my order comes out and they apologize and say they gave me extra meat. Already running late i nod and leave right away. At home i realize they forgot to give me the lettuce cheese and sour cream that is supposed to come with the half pound of fajitas and they gave me an extra box of meat with half chicken and steak. Like i know you gave me free stuff but you could ve at least gotten my order right and not forgotten the sides. Im still debating calling them to complain
Taco Cabana,116,Keep driving  How is this place even in business  Hungry  I decided to give them a shot and ordered the chix and steak fajita style tacos. They lacked all ingredients other than the meat and tortillas...seriously  The chicken was definitely pressed and had come from a package.
Taco Cabana,117,Great staff and manager made sure that I got my large order of breakfast tacos so quickly.  I really appreciate how friendly and helpful they all were and of course their wonderful tacos to start our day off.  Thank you so much 
Taco Cabana,118,I came in hoping to use an offer in which was emailed to me  however the employee told me that the coupon was expired and he could longer accept it. I showed him my offer stating I received the email yesterday and it doesn t expire until July 20th. He clearly told me I understand what you re saying but there s nothing I can do since that coupon is not valid  even though the coupon stated otherwise  I guess this particular Taco Cabana doesn t believe in honoring their offers. It s not like I was trying to get something free or take advantage of the company. Very unhappy
Taco Cabana,119,I LOVE Taco Cabana but this one is a complete joke. 1st of all  I only ordered 2 beef tacos with meat and cheese only. I then wait in the drive thru for almost 20 mins with only 2 cars in front of me   Sooo I get my food  get on the frontage road  and what do you know  they couldn t ensure my order was right within 20 mins. Soo I go back to the drive thru  speak with the unpleasant drive-thru guy. I get to the window and hand him the bag to throw away  he takes it rolls his eyes  and slams the window as hard as he could. Thennnn when he comes back to the window to slide it open and hand me my food he couldn t even get it open because he had slammed it so hard  I couldn t help but laugh  he was on the other side of the window cursing trying to get it open. It finally slings open and I can t help myself but to ask him if he s ok  he will not even look at me so I take the food and say thank you  he slams the window in my face again. Just absolutely horrible customer service  but at least his ignorance made for a good laugh.
Taco Cabana,120,After multiple food poisonings I really can t say anything positive about this place. Just go to the grocery store and make your own.
Taco Cabana,121,I ve almost stopped buying breakfast from this location. Weekends you get attitude from whatever kid is taking orders.  Tacos are small or order wrong and they want you to pay for enough salsa for 7 tacos even if you ask for exactly the size amount of salsa you want.  If I pay  12 for food...give me enough salsa damn it. Weekdays are great though.
Taco Cabana,122,Seriously how do places like this survive and why do I think places like this would be good   Because sometimes they are   This chain should be ashamed they relate themselves to anything tex-mex.  They can t even serve decent eggs.  The WHOLE chain deserves the  Nasty  list    
Taco Cabana,123,Have military discount. I had special requests for my combo and they accommodated me with my requests. The only complaint was the pico was a little mushy  I like when it looks like its been just freshly cut.
Taco Cabana,124,The food was wonderful and the staff was super friendly an helpful  They even went out of their way twice to help me get something for my picky toddler. I ve never written a review before but after the stellar service here I had to make an account just to tell everyone how amazing this restaurant is both food and customer service. We will definitely be coming back.
Taco Cabana,125,The newly revamped TCs look great and are a huge improvement even as the staff struggles to get on board with the need to be friendly and accommodating. This was one of the worst TCs in Austin and the changes have made a huge impact. Keep it coming 
Taco Cabana,126,Food Going into to Taco Cabana  you know you re looking for a deal not a gourmet Tex-Mex dining experience. You get out of the chicken soft tacos what you put in them  a meager  3. Sloppy chicken with a mashed together lettuce  cheese and tomato glop. Perfect for the quick and dirty. Wash it all down with a cold Coke and this will be one of the quickest  semi-satisfying Mexican drive-thru experiences in the Austin area. Cheap alcohol and margaritas are available for the more risque.  Service I will admit the service was rather good. Maria at the front  was quick and accurate when taking my order and the food was prepared quickly  or rather timely handed to me from under the prepared food warmer. But they were friendly throughout nonetheless. Atmosphere For a relaxed Sunday afternoon  the chill mood matched the interior quite well. Only a few couples and other independent diners joined me for the 3 27 pm eat and run. And the uniformity between food quality and interior design quality was quite pleasing  mediocre through the whole restaurant.  Price Based off of my experience  you could eat here for no more than  8 and be full. The tacos are appropriately priced at  2.65 ea and drinks are modest as well. For  7.61  I can not complain about the price when compared to several other Austin Tex-Mex places. Cleanliness Although maybe not the most upscale place to chow down  this location was surprisingly clean. Tables  chairs  and bathrooms were spotless and all of the utensils were disposable giving you a fresh start every time.  For what it is  I would give this Taco Cabana a 4 out of 5. The food is not terrible  but definitely needs some improvement. Service  atmosphere  and cleanliness are all pluses  and the prices are nothing to frown at.
Taco Cabana,127,Very clean and fast service. Not the best Mexican food but still very good. Ill be back 
Taco Cabana,128,Went there for dinner with 3 friends. Ordering was difficult cause the crackhead working the register and taking the order was practically falling asleep  Food was good  especially since my order was right. My friend s order was botched and he refuses to ever go there again.
Taco Cabana,129,They ve improved everything here except the food. I don t really understand why people eat here  unless they re in a hurry and want this type of food. The store looks much nicer inside. The staff was attentive. I actually saw two employees sweeping the parking lot while I was leaving. I don t understand why the food quality remains so low  however.
Taco Cabana,130,Have been to other locations with way better experiences  first off before we even knew what we wanted to order the cashier shouted at us standing nowhere near he register if the order was for here or to go. He had a very negative attitude and responded rudely when we asked questions about the menu. Later when someone approached our table with a tray of food it was someone else s food which is understandable but he didn t even read back the order or check to make sure it was ours he set the tray down and walked away and when we let him know he seemed bother by it. When our food later came out it was disappointing as well our order was made incorrectly was not hot and the fajita veggies were 3 pieces for a whole order of fajitas with onions that were still undercooked and the side of tortillas were room temperature at best when we asked them to fix our order because it was not what we had ordered I was again responded to with a negative attitude and basically threw the right thing on top of it we didn t tell them about the tortillas or the veggies because we were fed up with the service. At the time it was not busy only about 2 other customers so there shouldn t be a reason for the awful service that we experienced. Will not be returning hopefully you guys get things in order
Taco Cabana,131,The one star is becuase my food was ok.   The service is...well...there is no service. I said thank you to both employees i encountered and the only thing that was said back to me was my total. Extremely rude at this location. STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION   Also  I was sitting in the front and i could see in the back of the kitchen. There was a male employee with a bucket of  something  on the floor  and he was dumping what appreared to be seasoning in the bucket.   He left that bucket with food in it on the floor the entire time I was there. When preparing food you NEVER under any circumstance leave it on the floor for even a minute. This is common sense right   BEWARE  there may be food poisoning in your near future if you eat here.
Taco Cabana,132,i came here one thursday evening around 430pm noone in drive through inside was pretty empty. the guy taking my order was extremely rude and rushing me. i order 2 beef enchilada neither had cheese. not again so i turn around and tell the guy says its not my fault adds the cheese with no apology and close the window. i couldnt beleive it. very rude staff members
Taco Cabana,133,i love taco cabana  good prices and awesome mexican food  but this location is different  i went in the drive thru and the cashier  who was also preparing my food  took my money with a large gauze bandage wrapped around her finger. no gloves    asked for the manager and a cook slide to the door and asked what my problem was...  i left. called the GM. he said he was there in the back and apologized but come on man...thats just nasty
Taco Cabana,134,When visiting Austin I eat at Taco Cabana at least one meal a day.  My family teases me about how addicted I am.  Favorites are black bean tacos  chips  amp  queso  and egg  amp  potato breakfast tacos.  All items are very reasonably priced  ready quickly and YUMMY.  Also  they carry my beloved Shiner Bock.  Heaven 
Taco Cabana,135,The worst taco cabana in Austin hands down. The spike haired kid at counter was struggling to count me change back to me and he had a bad attitude. To top it off the food was real bad. There is a real problem with management in this place.
Taco Cabana,136,They give quick service  the food is great and im almost always happy  Never had a wrong order.    My only issue was this one time when the lady taking my order was rude and wouldnt let me substitute something as they have asked me to do before. Other than that  very pleased 
Taco Cabana,137,Consistently the worst service in town.  I only go back when nothing else is a good option  late night  and they never fail to dis-please.  They get the order wrong 75  of the time and many times it takes forever to get someone to take my order.  Then they sell me a soda but don t tell me the soda machine is down...this happened more than once.  In fact now I ask if the machine is working before I buy one.    I have so many sad stories from these guys.    Find somewhere else when possible.
Taco Cabana,138,BEWARE  Horrible customer service.  Orders are frequently incorrect.  Drive thru is very unprofessional.  Order taker cannot hear person in the car  half of the time.    Before the remodel  the place was really dirty.  At the drive-thru window you could smell the filth coming from the kitchen.  I stopped going.    I tried again after the remodel  My friend and I ordered breakfast tacos.  The potatoes in his tacos were rotten...he had to spit out the food.  Uhg    He threw away the tacos and we will not be back.  The sad thing is that Taco Cabana seems oblivious or they don t care   Corporate offices must be out of touch with what is happening at the restaurants  or they don t care.
Taco Cabana,139,We just moved to Austin.  Saw Taco Cabana and decided to try it.  They had a sign on the side of the building that said  homemade .  This is what got us to visit.  We did the drive-thru.  They asked us to pull forward and wait.  We did.  They brought our food to us and upon inspection  there was no guacomole on two of the dinners which specifically stated they included guacamole.  No salsa of any kind.  We pull around to the front  park and go in.  The lady makes no apologies at all.  She just says  yes  they usually come with guacamole but we don t have any.  No apologies  offers of anything else  etc.  And no apologies for not putting salsa in the bags.  Got home  started to eat and it was horrible.  The only thing that was decent was the shrimp quesadilla.  The tacos were horrible  enchilada horrible  rice horrible  and the chalupa was tasteless. Couldn t eat it.  Honestly.  Oh  and the chicken nachos were also disgusting.  We will never go back.  Food and service were horrible.
Taco Cabana,140,  other than a corporate response  no local response.  So  it s fast  it s cheap  it s not always good  and your tacos may be little wads of dough mashed together......email Diana Smith on the Taco Cabana website...she will send you a lovely letter and that s where the customer service begins and ends   Yeah  tacos in Austin........lots of cheap delicious places to eat and they re local and maybe they care about their customer service more than these guys in San Antonio    I m gonna keep on truckin   right past these guys..........deadheadgrams 
Taco Cabana,141,Taco Cabana makes the worst tacos in town. Absolutely no effort. I ordered two steak tacos and I was given two tortillas with just a few pieces of over-cooked beef and NOTHING ELSE. No topics  sauce  anything. We ordered two shrimp tacos as well which looked absolutely disgusting... and they managed to only give us 3 tacos and we ordered 4.
Taco Cabana,142,Not only did they get the order wrong  but the tortillas were tiny and thick on one half and thin on the other. This is simply unacceptable from ANY mexican food place with a tortilla machine  They stopped selling the Chicken Flamante   Really   That was my favorite thing about this place b c you could feed 2 with it afford-ably. Recent Mother s day experience  drive through order  Ordered fajita dinner package. We ordered chicken and beef because mom looooves the beef fajitas. Got home and no beef  so we paid for mixed but got plain ol  chicken. Regular beans had WAY too much salt compared to the last time we ate here and were practically inedible. Black beans were all soupy with more liquid than beans  staff needs to learn to use a strainer or something when serving them.  Felt like a longer drive through wait compared to nearby locations. Until they bring back the chicken flamante I m gonna skip this place.
Taco Cabana,143,Brisket tacos are killer  family had the chipotle tacos which were also good  only downside are the tacos are light on the meat 
Taqueria Los Jrâs,1,Had the Al Pastor tacos. I ve had better  but the tortillas were really good and the standout. The red salsa was really hot and didn t have much taste at first  but the aftertaste was great. Friendly staff both times I went. They accept card too    Kind of overpriced  but I m probably going to go again. They were definitely worth the walk. I ll probably try a different type of meat though.
Taqueria Los Jrâs,2,Oh  boy. I do love me a good taco  and this place serves up some solid tacos  I had some breakfast tacos  the basic--bacon  egg and cheese   and they were delicious  The flour tortillas were pretty great and tasted fresh  I think I saw a sign that said they were freshly made .   I do wish the hours were consistent as I ve drove by a few times to see the truck closed during their listed hours  which was unfortunate. If you do happen to see it open  then stop by for some food 
Taqueria Los Jrâs,3,Came here for lunch on a weekdays. They serve lots of breakfast tacos  regular tacos  burritos  tortas and other food. I order two taco and burrito  and got myself a guava drink. The taco and burrito was good. But the star of the show was guava drink. I might come back in the future just for the drink at 2.50.
Taqueria Los Jrâs,4,The secret weapon here is the breakfast burrito. It s  8 but it s massive. Two people can easily split it. There s something about how creamy the beans are with the salty bacon and eggs.   Only downside is they have weird hours  but are dependably open on Saturday mornings. If you catch them open  stop in the food is killer and they finally can take debit cards.
Taqueria Los Jrâs,5,A nifty little food truck camped out near the Speedy Mart which is one of our better convenience stores around FYI.  I come here for the breakfast tacos which are great  the flour tortillas are savory and their red and green sauces are both really complex in their own right - nice and spicy and tangy. Their drinks are limited to lemonade and another juice of some sort but you ve got the convenience store next door for your drink options.   They have nice outdoor shaded seating too. Parking is limited but I usually ride my bike.
Taqueria Los Jrâs,6,Outstanding tacos. The verde sauce is amazing   Wish they d actually meet their hours of operation though. If you plan on driving here to try them  call first  dont trust their hours .
Taqueria Los Jrâs,7,I was really craving for some tacos and found this truck after dropping off my brother in law. First time trying them and were amazing  try their aguas frescas too 
Taqueria Los Jrâs,8,Breakfast tacos are so good   Homemade tortillas and homemade salsa   Give it a try if you have not tried this food truck.  I highly recommend 
Taqueria Los Jrâs,9,Yum   Walked up for breakfast. The breakfast burritos are huge   Wish I would have read the other review before ordering. Three of us eating burritos all took home leftovers  can t wait for lunch . Pineapple  mango  guava Aqua Fresca was refreshing and large. We will be back. Oh and friendly staff as well.
Taqueria Los Jrâs,10,This place is a gem.   We were looking for quick taco fix late in the evening and found this place while driving by.   The food is freshly made.  The price is great.  The owner is friendly.   We will definitely come back for more great tacos 
Taqueria Los Jrâs,11,We tried the torta  quesadilla  and burrito. Everything was DELICIOUS  The barbacoa was so good and the beef fajita had great flavor. The portions were great for the prices and the salsa was delicious and spicy. We also got the agua fresca which was super tasty and huge and they gave us a full refill for just a dollar. I ve tried a lot of taco trucks around Austin and this is definitely one of the best ones in north Austin. Usually I have to go all the way out to north Lamar or south Austin to get food this good. LAST thing - the tortillas are handmade and DELICIOUS.
Taqueria Los Jrâs,12,I keep coming here because there really is no better  more authentic place in the area. For the reviewer who panned them for not having tacos as good as Houston  sorry to say  but Houston is not known for having good tacos. My mother is Mexican and I grew up along the border. These tacos are legit. The tortillas are fresh and everything is made to order. The only feedback I have is that I don t like vinegar in my salsas and would prefer they either not use it or offer another option like pico de gallo. Otherwise  please check them out   
Taqueria Los Jrâs,13,Very nice customer service but unfortunately it s just not as good as houston tacos. I have been look for great tacos in north Austin since moving from Houston the beef wasn t seasoned the drinks were sour green sauce was bland but again the service was good. I will not be back
La Familia Mexican Market,1,Came to this little spot today hungry as hell.   MY GOD.  BREAKFAST BURRITOS. ONCE AGAIN  BREAKFAST BURRITOS.  As much as i love me a good breakfast taco  a breakfast burrito was a staple in San Francisco for me. These guys got it down. Same with there Carne Asada Burrito. My mouth was watering as I watched them make the delicious treat that I was about to consume. They are the gods among mexican food  the queen of sheeba  the conquestadors of cheese. I will be back  alot too.  Great spot to find today. BOOM.
La Familia Mexican Market,2,Wound up coming here with a couple of friends. They ve visited before  but it was my first time. It s a taqueria inside a gas station  very low profile. The meat market is on your left when you come in  and the place where you order food is to the right. They told me to get the burrito so I took the recommendation. I got the Pastor burrito  and it did not disappoint  They cooked the pastor different than I normally have had it  but I enjoyed it regardless. The burrito is grilled  which was a surprise  and its filled with the usual suspects to the BRIM  and evenly  might I add. Sometimes you get burritos and there s too much of 1 ingredient  not enough of the other  but they made mine pretty equally  and I appreciate that. Great taste friendly people  very nice sized burrito. I was definitely full when I finished  probably before I finished. The burrito was  9  which is kind of high to me  but at least it was a great burrito  so I won t sweat the price.
La Familia Mexican Market,3,Best breakfast tacos around for a song  So fluffy and delicious with terrific salsa- sooo good   Lots of choices  all made fresh  and everyone is a delight 
La Familia Mexican Market,4,This is a nice grocery store right off Research. Carries mostly Mexican food items  but also a lot of things you would not expect in a store this size. Baked goods  produce  and assorted frozen items. The best part is that you don t have to pay extra for the convenience. Prices are the same that you would find at the bigger grocery stores.   The meat market here has almost everything you can get at Fiesta and at the same price as well.  I highly recccomend their carnitas and the green salsa you get with it. That was some of the freshest salsa I have had in Austin. If you re tired of the parking  long lines and the large crowds then come here.
La Familia Mexican Market,5,Good place. Definitely a must if you live in the area. Not something I would make a special trip across town bit it s fine. Usually good produce too. Avacados  lemons all that stuff.
La Familia Mexican Market,6,You d never guess it from outside  but that was easily the cleanest gas station market bathroom I ve been in outside of a Bucees.  And I ve seen more than my share of gas station bathrooms.   Tacos smelled delicious but I walked in as they were shutting down. I ll be back on a lunch break soon.
La Familia Mexican Market,7,That I ve lived within walking distance of this place for 4 months and never set a foot inside is a great injustice.  What appears at first glance to be a medium-sized convenience store attached to a gas station is in fact a small grocery store  complete with produce  dairy  a meat market  basic staples and a decent beer selection. There s also an excellent and cheap short order taqueria within.  The offerings are overwhelmingly Mexican as the name implies  half of an aisle is dedicated to La Coste a products alone  but they have quite a bit beyond that too  just about anything you would need in a pinch in the way of canned vegetables.  Best of all  it s CHEAP. Grocery store prices rather than convenience store prices.
La Familia Mexican Market,8,I am Hispanic and got discriminated by Hispanics at the  restaurant inside.  Very upset with the experience.  First and last time at the place.  Would NOT recommend it to anyone. Hopefully the owners will address the issue with this employees because someone will sue someday if they keep doing that.
La Familia Mexican Market,9,Cheap meat here  And it is not questionable. Some of the vegetables are so you should be careful sifting through them. They aren t always as fresh as one would hope. La Familia doesn t just have the typical gas station junk food  although they do have it . It s like a mini grocery store. They also have a taqueria inside - get tacos  Get migas  Don t forget to get an Alligator Ice on your way out. Man.... so sugary and delicious.   I would choose La Familia over any Walgreens just to pick up a few groceries because as the others mentioned - everything is reasonably priced.
La Familia Mexican Market,10,If you re looking for a simple breakfast taco  as opposed the fancy stuff at taco deli   then you d be hard pressed to beat la tierra linda. Basic  amazing  cooked to order  tacos. Burritos are also top notch. Don t forget to get some of the amazing salsa. That avocado fire stuff is awesome.
La Familia Mexican Market,11,My favorite Taqueria  is located inside. Anytime you get pissed off and need good food for cheap  go here. Authentic Mexican food  Also their Gatorade selection is un matched. want soda  They ve got everything glass and plastic. need to be beered  theyve got most of anything you d want from a convenient store including local breweries.
Marisco Grill,1,First off the service was great  Love the one on riverside too.   My dad loves the Marisco soup  my mom loves the micheladas. I absolutely love the shrimp cocktail it s a must for me 
Marisco Grill,2,I had a pretty strange experience here. Last Friday night I was craving some ceviche  but was way too lazy to prepare it myself. Found this restaurant on the yelp  I never even knew this restaurant was here - it s blocked by Burger King from the road or something. Anyway the dining room was pretty dead at 6 PM - not a good sign. There was an elderly couple and one woman eating by herself. Probably at like 5  occupancy. The restaurant is dim and cavernous. There s a chalkboard where someone scrawled a half-hearted Bienvenidos along with a seemingly birth-defect addled rendition of their logo  a rainbow fish.  Perd name  echoed in the background  like some kind of preemptive apology.   The chips and salsa were terrible. Like probably the worst I have eaten all year  and it s almost December. The food on the menu looked ridiculously overpriced.  6.50 for a fish tostada is a couple bucks too expensive  why charge an extra  1 for mayo   14 al pastor quesadilla   16 ceviche  I guess the prices aren t that out there  but for the restaurant  it seemed out of place. At this point  I was just hoping the food was edible.  We got the fish tostada  a shrimp cocktail and shrimp ceviche and thank god the food was good. Pretty reasonable quality  but nothing mindblowing. The tostada had a heaping portion of fish which tasted fresh. The shrimp cocktail had a little too much orange soda  but was good  although the octopus chunks lacked flavor. My partner s ceviche tasted fresh but was pretty simple  served on a bed of lettuce with some tomatoes  herbs  oil and lime. A side of avocado  very nicely sliced and arranged in a bowl  cost  5.  All in all  strange vibe  overpriced  but decent food. You ll save a lot of money preparing your own mariscos and it will probably taste better.
Marisco Grill,3,Came here with my husband and we sat ourselves. We were sitting for 15-20 minutes and were never even seen approached. We walked out because we didn t want to continue sitting in a restaurant who doesn t want to serve people.
Marisco Grill,4,Pretty Fresh Seafood  Recommend if your def a seafood love and pick about freshness. Service is a tad bit slow but makes sense for a small business.
Marisco Grill,5,The good  shrimp cocktail and ceviche tostadas are on point    The bad  took like 10 minutes to get a round of waters when there were 2 customers there. The waitress didn t seem to know what each food was.  The micheladas were a disappointment. And they don t give you the beer w the michelada... which I didn t like. It tasted very watered down.
Marisco Grill,6,Hands down the best Mariscos in Austin. Most delicious camaron  shrimp  cocktail ever  Highly recommend
Marisco Grill,7,Decided to visit Marisco Grill and meet up with some friends from out of town that we haven t seen in years. After reading the great reviews and hearing they had good micheladas we were excited to try it.  The restaurant was empty when we got there around 5pm and it was silent other than two employees chatting. We sat down and started looking at the menus. Our friends ordered the micheladas  amp  we had water and a soft drink. They told us their drinks were okay  but they d had better.  The water first came out with a weird taste  but that s just what you get when your order water out I guess. The waiter was quite attentive at first  if not a little hovering  but we appreciated the prompt service.  For the table we ordered the quest  then our friends ordered the c ctel de camar n and the ceviche de pescado and some beef quesadillas for their kiddo  we ordered the ceviche de pescado and the carne asada.   Let me start off by saying that if you re looking for a meal where everything tastes like chorizo  you ve found the restaurant for you. Everything  from the queso to the c ctel de camar n tasted like chorizo oil had been poured all over it. It also seemed like the added cooked down green onions to the queso  which was a weird choice. The carne asada was flavorless and dry. I think the only thing we all agreed tasted good was quesadillas.  Our friends ordered a few different drinks including a pi a colada and said all of them were pretty disappointing. I also sat with an empty water cup for quite awhile before I finally had to ask the server for another glass  which was frustrating with the spicy chorizo flavor all over all the dishes. Overall the party was thankful for the decent service  but the food and drinks were very disappointing and we will not be back.
Marisco Grill,8,HORRIBLE    Walked in and the restaurant was completely dead. Ordered enchiladas de camar n and found a hair in my food. Waitress told me to order something else without saying sorry. Ended up getting ceviche and there was no flavor at all. Everyone at the table was unsatisfied with their food. The restaurant includes tip already with the meal.
Marisco Grill,9,The food in this place is pretty good and at a good price .. the place is clean and quite ... the service was ok the waitress that help me didn t talk at much mayb because it was kinda slow .. I order the fried whole fish it was super good  10 the best part I would recommend this restaurant to others
Marisco Grill,10,There shrimp tacos was basic. Ain t nothing amazing to go crazy about. If you are hungry and just trying to curve your hunger  I guess it good. This was my second time coming  and the only reason its my second is because I couldn t remember if the food was good from way back then. But I ll definitely remember next time to go somewhere else.
Marisco Grill,11,Visiting town for the weekend .. Had the fish ceviche and some lime  margaritas .. it was good. I love spicy the jalape os were a good plus. Portion size was good and pricing wasn t too crazy. My waitress was awesome  
Marisco Grill,12,I really want to give this place 3.5 stars. The service and location were good. I even got to practice my Spanish some and the waitress endured all my mistakes and such. The food was just ok so this was just another pit stop in my search for more authentic Mexican food in Austin that i probably won t try again. I had enchiladas  because they were out of came asada   and they didn t have much flavor. The portion size was good though and i left full. The margarita was the same deal. Not much flavor and not very strong. I did appreciate and enjoyed the free chips and salsa though. At the end of the day there just isn t much to have about with this place so i can t give them a raving review.
Marisco Grill,13,Try the nachos for the first time they were better than I thought they were going to be the service is always great the waitresses are always on top of refills or anything else you might need
Marisco Grill,14,I orders shrimp cocktail a horchata and chips salsa the salsa was good and the chips where hot my drink was the best horchata I have ever had sooooo good I got my cocktail it was ok I don t like how they cut the shrimp up but other than that it was good
Marisco Grill,15,Pretty good Mexican seafood. The bet I ve been able to find since I moved here.  Great service.
Marisco Grill,16,I love their Micheladas. I ordered shrimp cocktail and it was ok. My hubby got ceviche but I really did not like it. I think Micheladas is the reason for me giving a 3 star review.
Marisco Grill,17,One of my favorite places  I love their rice and tacos de tinga  al pastor  And their Mexican Martinis and fresh lemonade are delicious  especially during these hot summer days 
Marisco Grill,18,I wanted to like this place  but in our group of 5  the only person that didn t lament about their food being underwhelming was the 5 year old who had chicken nuggets. We had the shrimp fajitas  beef enchiladas  and another shrimp dish with rice similar to a paella. Friendly service and lots of TVs if you want to watch the soccer game.
Marisco Grill,19,Great food   i had a michelada and a cocktail shrimp and they were awesome  Waitress didn t check on us   but it was ok   i wanted to ask her about karaoke days to go back for that and the food of course.
Marisco Grill,20,I came to have dinner here with in-laws  I loved it. Great  customer service  the food did not take long to be ready and they were all super friendly as if they were your own family.
Soco Bar & Bites,1,Rachel is the best  Took great care of me and my old dad  Such a fun evening Good local cocktails Solid food and happy hour for the witching hour I ll stay at this hotel again just for the hotel lobby bar
Soco Bar & Bites,2,Travis makes a great Old Fashioned  Can t speak for the food but the cocktails were good.  My Man has outdone himself with a Reese s Peanut Butter Old Fashioned  Avant Garde 
Soco Bar & Bites,3,Need to update hours  at least for the restaurant. Came recently on a weekday for lunch and was not open until later in the afternoon. Parking is not the easiest   may need to find a paid option so very disappointing to go through the motions to get in and find out you have to change up plans.
Soco Bar & Bites,4,Late night tacos in my neighborhood and they do delivery  This place is located inside The Hilton Embassy Suites. You can grab a bite and have it in their nicely renovated lobby or you can just uber eats it like me. I ve tried every taco here and would recommend the fried avocado taco  al pastor  and the queso. I use my own sauce which is trader joe s jalepeno sauce. The fish taco and the pulled pork are bland and mediocre at best and even the sauce couldn t save them.
Soco Bar & Bites,5,I came here visiting from out of town and had the Croque Madame. We sat in the patio. It s a brioche bun topped with ham  cheese  a white sauce and sunny side up egg. It was deliciousness in my mouth     We also had a reasonably priced champagne bottle with cranberry juice. Our waiter  Justin  was amazing and funny.
Soco Bar & Bites,6,Ordered from here during the hours that yelp said they were open. My takeout order went through and when we showed up for pickup  they were closed. Had to call Grubhub support to cancel the order.
Soco Bar & Bites,7,Underwhelming and borderline gross experience.  14.00 for a short  watered down  cucumber filled drink at a renovated Super 8 and the manager will argue with you about it. Food and drinks was an overpriced Applebees experience. Bill was  70 for two drinks and two apps. Who you think you are  JW 
Soco Bar & Bites,8,This is a pretty cool laid back venue   It s not very busy and the restaurant can be seen from the entrance. The food was great and our server Stacy was so sweet   We sat bar side  the food came out prompt and they took careful consideration with each dish   Stacy even asked them to add extra veggies to my Caesar salad  because I m vegetarian  and it was SO tasty and filling  as well as very aesthetically appealing. This is definitely my new go to spot when I want a quick bite in a quiet environment.
Soco Bar & Bites,9,This place was well worth the walk  Our bartender was Ms. Rachel  she was a great conversationalist great service and gave us new comers to the city some places to visit during our stay in the Capital 
Soco Bar & Bites,10,Truly the pictures make it look awesome  however it is not that great  i would recommend somewhere else by congress. The waiter took about 20 minutes to show up  amp  we had to go get him. Food was alright  I mean eh just average
Soco Bar & Bites,11,Fantastic bartender. Extremely polite and knowledgeable of the menu offerings. The food is good  but what makes this place special and want to come back was the staff.
Soco Bar & Bites,12,Stayed here two nights and the evening reception is awesome here. Thanks to good management for giving great complimentary drink choices and to the great bartenders serving them  The bartenders are quick to serve and are very friendly.  The snacks are fresh and negate the need for an appetizer at dinner anywhere in the area. They have several people cleaning up after us drinkers  just like at breakfast. Excellent service overall. Tip your servers  Definitely the best ES evening reception I ve been too.   Big shame on all the business travelers I saw skimp out not giving tips to the bar staff    Your company pays for a nice hotel with free breakfast  drinks and snacks  you should be ashamed to not tip a buck or two 
Soco Bar & Bites,13,Ordered the shrimp tacos. Very good  very freshly made  and had a nice flavor. However  if you want tacos while visiting Austin  you should head to Veracruz All Natural on Cesar Chavez Rd.
Soco Bar & Bites,14,Wonderful service here   No matter the bartender or server it was always spot on when it came to service. The food was filling mostly appetizer food. So to me it is like alcohol food. But it was not bad at all. Mostly tacos and snacks. Love the service and promptness here
Soco Bar & Bites,15,I ve been staying at Embassy Suites for a very long time and walked in tonight to find a new bar.  Really nice   Christian is quite possibly the greatest bar tender EVER.  Apps were great and the drinks were amazing.  They have happy house and you can upgrade from free to premium for 2 bucks    it  
Mi Lindo Michoacan,1,My husband and I were extremely impressed by the food at Mi Lindo Michoacan. We ve ordered it for delivery twice and went inside once to eat and it s consistently fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the chicken flautas  but everything I ve tried so far has been great.
Mi Lindo Michoacan,2,Looking for a place to eat dinner after arriving to Austin and stumbled upon this place  A true hidden gem near Pflugerville    Great outdoor patio seating and we got lucky in this Texas summer heat by getting a nice breeze today    Fun cups accompany agua frescas - flavors change seasonally but we ordered the limon con pepino  cucumber lime  and melon   They were both delicious  Highly recommend    Authentic tortillas and homemade chips made in house accompany a delicious Bowl of queso with a dollup of guacamole   Also highly recommend the queso and the enchiladas verdes     I ordered the tostada  but sadly it was no bueno  The chicken inside the enchilada and the tostada were really dry...if they could make it shredded and more juicy it would definitely help    All in all  a great find in ATX   Friendly  great service by staff as well  
Mi Lindo Michoacan,3,Received great food and service in a charming outdoor seating area on a beautiful evening. The menu is large and everything we tried was awesome. We went on a Friday night and the place was kinda dead. I don t understand why all the people down the street waiting an hour for a seat at Chuy s don t come here. It s 10x better and family owned operated. This is my new favorite Mexican place in Austin  I would take pics of the plates but they are all scraped clean.
Mi Lindo Michoacan,4,Just came here for a mid-day lunch and have to say this place was so good. From the ambience  music playing and the service I was overly  impressed.  My family and I decided to stop and try this place on a whim. What a good choice it was.  From walking in and being promptly greeted by the nice waitress   and being welcomed was a good start. I had the Carne Asada plate and it came with rice  beans and cactus vegetable melody on top. The meat was excellent probably could be flavored a little more but overall good texture and taste. They re don t have homemade flower tortillas   but do have homemade corn tortillas which were excellent   and highly recommend.  The beans and rice tasted fresh and good.  My family each had different plates which they all enjoyed.  The prices were moderate and not overly expensive.  Looking forward to my next experience there and trying something different 
Mi Lindo Michoacan,5,First time trying this place out after driving by it so many times.   The food is really good  reminds me of my grandmas cooking. We will definitely be back.
Mi Lindo Michoacan,6,Great hidden little gem The aguas frescas are always a hit and never disappoints. The menudo is pretty good and also the tortas definitely recommend.
Mi Lindo Michoacan,7,Great food  clean restaurant  charming atmosphere  and friendly staff. The food tastes like well-made  home-cooked food. The coffee tasted delicious  smooth  and freshly made.  Authentic. Tastes like south Texas food.
Mi Lindo Michoacan,8,Homemade food excellent service family friendly couldn t ask for anything more Best tripas
