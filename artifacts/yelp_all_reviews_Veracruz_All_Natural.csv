T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,1,My favorite hot dogs in Austin.   A pleasant  shady place with a fan to enjoy them.   Always friendly service.   And we are offered some seriously yummy options. Check the menu       Parking can sometimes be a problem but it s worth the try.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,2,Delicious hot dogs and burritos. The highlight is the tortillas- i dont know if they make in house but they are thin and delicious making a fantastic burrito. The meat is well seasoned and cooked  and the queso is top notch.  The hot dogs are great  they are a great version of a  danger dog  or  dirt dog  for anyone familiar with the los angeles staple street food. They are far from your typical dog- with onions  peppers  cheese  etc.- delicious.  Highly recommend a visit 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,3,Well  first of all the owners are great   Zulma greeted us warmly and chatted with us. Miguel  the chef  came out of the trailer to talk the menu over with us  I would not expect this at their busy times  . So the service was above good  it was great  And the food -- oh my god   Miguel is a real chef  far above what you might expect from a food trailer operator. My wife and I split a Sonoran  and it was incredibly good  Delicious bun  filled with toppings  just all around delicious. We also split a chicken taco and a cheese taco  happened to be vegetarian . Both were excellent. By the way  we drove some 20 miles from our house to go visit T-Loc   and it was totally worth it. We ll do it again the next time we want some delicious food. Totally recommend    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,4,Was in the mood for a hot dog and got to try my first Sonora Dog at T-Loc s.   The Sonora dog is loaded  but the one I had at T-Loc s felt short of expectation. I didn t taste much in the way of bacon or pinto beans  which are the two twoppings that set the Sonora dog from all other dogs. Also  the stnadard hot dog that T-Loc uses sdoesn t have much spicy zing or snap in the casing. They offer dogs from Hebrew  National and Granzin s Market for  1 and  1.50 more  respectively. I would strongly recommend getting them  but it d be even better if T-Loc s were to raise its price and make the Hebrew National dog standard.  However  I really liked the Fresco dog  topped with mashed avocado  sliced cucumber  and pico de gallo. Perfect for endless weeks of 98  degree evenigns in Austin. The different  and more subtle  flavors in the Fresco dog worked better than the Sonora dog  I thought. The steamed bun  sourced from Alejandro s Tortilla Factory in Tuscon was top-notch and held everything together. Also appreciated Chef Miguel for taking the time to chat with me and telling me more about the business.  Overall  definitely worth a visit. Make sure you get one of the non-standard hot dogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,5,Why 5 stars  Because when hot dogs are done well  they really hit the spot.             Hot dogs are kind of the butt of the joke in the food world  but a fancy hot dog is one of my favorite meals. And T-Loc s serves up some fancy hot dogs.  Pretty much all of them sounded good  so it was painful to only choose two  but I ultimately went with the Yaqui and the La Sonora.   The Yaqui was everything I hoped for when I decided to come here. The bun was toasted and delicious. The toppings smothered the dog itself  beans  onion  steak and cheese. Every bite was a dream.  To be honest  the La Sonora was a bit of a miss for me. It was basically a birria taco in hot dog form. But the flavor was just a bit off from every birria taco I ve tried to date. I didn t hate it  but the other dog was definitely my favorite.  I also ordered some ranch fries  which were an ideal pairing with the hot dogs. They were heavy  which prompted the owners to question if I was going to be able to eat everything by myself  but I told them I had the heart of a champion and I finished every last bite. The ranch fries were fries covered in ranch  bacon  cheese and onions  which was as great as it sounds like it would be.  In my brief chat with the owner s   they were really nice people and hoping to open a brick and mortar location soon. Hopefully that will happen and I can swing by to check it out next time I m in Austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,6,Summary  I love this place. The hotdogs are incredible and the owning family is kind and friendly. I have never had a bad experience here. Recently moved from Austin  and it will be one place I genuinely miss.   Good  Gotta go  con todo . Hot  cold  sweet  salty  savory  ...  it s got it all. And 1 is usually enough for me  and I m a pretty big guy. Love their ranch fries as well.   Bad  Outdoor seating is nice  but the truck area has flies and bugs.  Ugly  Nothing to note 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,7,The Sonoran Style Hot Dog is quite  frankly  one of the best hot dogs that I ve ever had. Miguel and Zulma  the owners  were explaining their origin  story as we were placing the order at the food truck. They are from Arizona and trying to bring Tuscon style hot-dogs to Austin.   Get the Sonora Hot Dog  It really combines  salty  spicy  sweet so well. It consists of a hot dog that is wrapped in bacon and grilled  served on a bolillo-style hot dog bun  and topped with pinto beans  onions  tomatoes  and a variety of additional condiments  often including mayonnaise  mustard  and jalape o salsa.  SO GOOD. It comes with roasted chili pepper and some chips.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,8,This place never disappoints  Very welcoming atmosphere. The owners are very nice and proud of their business. The Agua Frescas  strawberry orange specifically   .COM  but all are really good. Food so good made me think about them all week til I went again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,9,These guys are my fav hot dogs in the whole city.   I dont think they have anything on the menu here that isnt just the best. From the Carne Asada Fries to the Sonoran Style hot dogs you just cant go wrong. Even the Tacos are legit -af.   If youre in the mood for something special and want a hot dog this is the place. Youre not going to have a better hot dog experience anywhere in the city.   Dont skip. T-Loc knows whats up.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,10,Let s be frank... these dogs ain t no joke   Highlights   Carne Asada Fries   Sonoran Style Hotdogs   Aguas Frescas   Review  This has become my new lunch spot which is conveniently close to work. I order the Yaqui Dog  carne asada fries and an agua fresca.  The Yaqui Dog was a rollercoaster of flavor with notes of sweetness from the saut ed onions  smokiness from the carne asada  nuttiness from the pinto beans  fattiness from the bacon wrapped hot dog  creaminess from the cheese and slight acidity to complement everything from the jalape o sauce. The highlight however were the carne asada fries  they had the perfect amount of asada  fries were cooked perfectly  creaminess from the crema added depth  freshness from the pico and the pickled garnish just took it to the next level. Everything was delicious and it was all washed down with a refreshing agua fresca. Can t wait to go back for another lunch adventure.   Rating  10 10  Yaqui Dog Bacon-wrapped S-Bar hot dog  pinto beans  sauteed onions  carne asada  Monterrey Jack cheese   amp  jalape o sauce. Served with chips. Chile guero available on request  Carne Asada Fries Crinkle cut fries  1 4lb of carne asada  pico de Gallo  mexican crema  japale o drizzle  monterrey jack cheese  amp  garnish
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,11,Hot dog  This place is tucked in at the 5000 Burnet food truck park. Been here several times over the years and they re consistently delicious  I ve tried almost everything on the menu  but tried and true is their Sonoran hot dog con todo. It has their bacon-wrapped dog  pinto beans  tomatoes  onions  mayo  mustard and jalapeno sauce. Sounds like a lot  but the flavors work so well together. The couple that owns the truck are super friendly. Pro tip  ask for the guero pepper. It s not super spicy but it s a delicious grilled pepper with salt sprinkled on it. Adds a nice dimension when you eat it with your hot dog. If you re a fan of Sonoran hot dogs or curious  stop in at T-Loc s 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,12,I know you see hotdog in the menu and think nothing can be amazing here but you re dead wrong. This is one of the greatest hotdogs spots as well as taco burrito they go all in on flavor. Nothing here is basic it s made with passion and quality ingredients stacked up to give you a mouth punch of flavor. Staff here is amazing ownership is passionate and wants to give you the best and by the way they are award-winning yes is a must try. Then you will just keep going back wake me see you soon 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,13,Okay wow talk about a yummy hot dog  Tried this once when my family was in town and have been back a few times since then  I really enjoy the flavors of their sonoran hot dig  though will say this is a better experience eating there. When I did pickup  it was a bit longer of a wait since I had to drive which left the bottom of the bun a bit soggy. Also really loved their carne asada burrito  10 10 would recommend  and everyone that works there is super nice too
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,14,A few months ago Way South Philly closed.  Being from Philly a quarterly visit will be missed.  Luckily I have found a new go to spot in T-Loc s.   The Sonoran dog is out of this world.   This dog hits all parts of the taste spectrum.  Outstanding.   Also the fries with the Aioli made me weak in the knees and broke my no fry diet.   It was worth it.   The owner has a great background having spent his childhood in Hawaii and loved to surf.  I really enjoyed talking to him.   The burrito is probably worth a try on another day.  It will be hard to order with the option of a Sonora.   Maybe I need to starve myself for a day and get both.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,15,This place is a food truck located in a parking lot with a bunch of other very tasty food trucks  too  They have their own seating right next to the truck  which is also lit at night  super convenient.  As for the Sonoran dog.. just get it. It is 100x better than the ones I ve tried in Tucson  where they re apparently very popular . Everything just tastes fresher and is more neatly put together than I remember having before. Nothing negative to say about it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,16,The hot dog definitely tasted special with the toasted bun  amp  fillings galore  but not mind-blowing or anything. I loved the pepper on the side. It definitely added some heat to every bite.   Also ordered the tacos a la plancha. Two small-sized tacos with corn tortillas. It came with beans and cabbage slaw. The beef inside was nicely grilled charred. Tortillas were also fresh and toasty. But yeah it s more like a snack than a meal.  Will try other items next time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,17,Truly I wasn t sure if I wanted a hog dog to start... BUT these are so GOOD. I got the Sonoran hot dog and Ranch fries. The hot dog was so yummy and flavorful. The ranch fries were definitely shareable and once again so flavorful.  Also the owner came by and was so friendly. Big thumbs up from myself and my friends.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,18,Revisited T-Loc s and he s still delivering the goods  Try them out for an out-of-this-world hot dog experience 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,19,My son brought me here. I had the Sonoran dog with everything and had some of the carne asada fries too  The Agua Fresca was very refreshing on a hot day in Austin. Everything was wonderful   Highly recommend . Go check this food truck out   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,20,A must if you re in austin  Love the food  You cant go wrong with anything. Been here several times and will continue to  Owner is very welcoming 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,21,BEST HOTDOGS IN AUSTIN        I hope that was loud enough. Because it s true.   T-Locs sports the most meticulously crafted hotdogs in Austin. They re main attraction  the Sonora Hot Dog  is absolutely  the epidemy of hotdogs. Soft steamed bun  the actual dog itself smothered in a wide range of ingredients that compliment each other in this extraordinary chorus of hotdog universe.  Not only do they have amazing hot dogs but they re sides are just as great. My fav side to pair with a hot dog is the ranch fries. Again  a collection of so many different ingredients to form an amazing basket of fries.   Service is amazing with the chef duo cranking out orders with care and love.   An amazing place  a must try in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,22,I love this crap  It tastes really good  Especially the hot dogs  The chicken burritos are really good too  Thanks
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,23,Deliciousness    Bacon Wrapped Dog  amp  carne asada fries were so good                    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,24,We got the Sonoran hot dog without the pinto beans and it was soooo good    I had the agua fresca it was strawberry and orange. It was so refreshing and good. It wasn t too sweet or sour it was just perfect  The fries were very crispy and a big serving enough for two. 10 10
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,25,Do it   Support local   You won t regret it  This little hot dog burrito french fries with garlic aioli place is awesome....o  M gosh.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,26,Been craving a good hot dog. Was not disappointed. Solid Sonoran dog was on point. Their papas Bravas were just the right side. Plenty of parking and night lights offer a good spot to catch a late dinner.   Coming back for the carne asada fries
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,27,I DON T EVEN KNOW  WHAT   WHO   The hot dog I had  was way to good to share. So I didn t. The carne asada fries looked good enough to snatch from my boyfriend  so I did  All the food we got was mouth watering. The food was not overly seasoned  I genuinely didn t feel bloated or felt sleepy when you eat cheesy goodness  instead I felt like I was missing a cold beer. I can not recommend the food enough  we re going back to try the entire menu. The only thing we forgot to do is take a picture of the quesadilla and that s mostly because we had finished the entire thing before we could  but the cheese pull... money shots all around  the food taste as fantastic as it looks  Great place  lots of places to sit and the vibe was awesome
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,28,Great Sonoran Dog and Carne Asada Tacos. Will be back to try other things on the menu. Staff were very friendly and gave me good insight on the inspiration of their menu ingredients.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,29,Amazing. Every single time. Whoever makes The Sonora dip is doing gods work. The fries are necessary y agua Fresca
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,30,Friendly chef   Thank you  Tastes so good and flavorful  hope set up  2 in downtown of Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,31,They are from Tucson  AZ and we used to live there when my hubby was stationed there in the Air Force. We found out about this place when my hubby was craving carne asada burritos - we are originally from San Diego where they have the best carne asada burritos. Ordered the carne asada burritos the first time we went and that was back in 2019 - taste just like the ones in San Diego - delicious  Miguel and his wife always take the time to talk to us when they re not busy and the food never disappoints. When family comes to visit from San Diego  we take them there and they agree that it s as good as the carne asada burritos in San Diego.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,32,This place is a favorite of mine.  Even though the husband and wife team that lovingly run this place are from Tucson  they placed in the Great ATX El Paso Mexican Food Challenge before Covid hit.  The Sonora Dogs are unbelievably good  but I had the opportunity to see their catering chops this Cinco de Mayo.   Drowned Taquitos Ala El Paso  are around 20 to 50x better than Chicos.  I ate several sober and wanted more  something I ve never been able to claim about Chico s.  Either at their trailer on Burnet or catering your next affair  I love T-Loc... both food and family.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,33,Got 2 Sonoran dogs. They were really good but neither dog was wrapped in bacon. Bummer.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,34,I think it s refreshing to see a product advertise and for once it is actually exactly as advertised and as you see in the photos  Having lived in Arizona and have had Sonoran hotdogs there I would say these are as authentic as they get  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu  Ah and the owner operator was very personable so that makes the whole experience that much better.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,35,Super friendly and funny owners  The main Sonoran hot dog is the best  The perfect balance of flavors. You guys are awesome  and your awards have definitely been earned.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,36,This place makes legit Sonoran Hot Dogs. Bacon wrapped dogs with jalapeno  mayo  mustard and beans. The cinnamon infused bread buns are shipped in from a bakery in Tucson  AZ. If you have never tried a Sonoran hot dog  you need to come here. Come with your friends and order a dozen of them. Make it a celebration to life 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,37,Every time I m missing home I make my way to T-Loc s. The Sonora Dog is AMAZING  Best food truck in Austin by far 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,38,Absolutely astounding hotdog. Would heavily encourage anyone to try it. Amazing service  remarkably delicious hotdogs. Love the cheese  jalape o sauce  seasoning  bacon  everything. 5 5
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,39,Great hotdogs. Great service. Great people. Highly recommend to anyone looking for amazing food with amazing people to brighten up your day. WILL be making this a frequent meal.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,40,Simplemente los mejores. Los due os tienen la mejor vibra siempre que voy me hacen sentir como familia. Y la comida ni se diga. 10 10
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,41,Super tasty dog.  Not a sausage on crusty bun with mustard.  Instead an amazing mix of ingredients.  Bacon wrapped dog on a soft squishy steamed bun with a pile of messy ingredients on top.  Beans.  Tomatoes.  Onions.  And then three sauces.  Might drip on you while eating so take care.  They also have tacos and burritos but I ve only ever had the Sonoran dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,42,Absolutely amazing   True authentic Sonoran hotdogs. If you re from Arizona and miss a slice of home then this is a MUST stop for you. We ordered two Sonoran dogs with a carne asana burrito. Authentic carne burrito with just meat  pico  and guac. Customer service was too notch  we met and talked with the owner for a bit  you can tell he s passionate about what he does. We will be repeat customers.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,43,My husband loves their Sonoran dogs but I am all about the ranch fries. The dill in the ranch sauce makes them crazy tasty. Burritos and tacos are solid and they have really good tortillas. Convenient order ahead options online w pickup at the truck  if you don t want to wait there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,44,I love their hot dog  Upgrade to the Hebrew National bc it really does make a difference. They ve added a bunch of stuff to their menu in recent years  so if you haven t been in a while  you should go  go  go again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,45,I ve been here about 5 times and every single time has been incredible. The owners are very kind and seem to know everyone by name  you can tell they care about their customers as much as their food. As much as I d like to recommend something specific  you really can t go wrong with anything 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,46,OMG the carne asada plate is the stuff dreams are made of. The line can get long but the wait is absolutely worth it. The hotdogs are amazing as well but the care asada is where it s at 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,47,We stopped by after a few years not coming due to distance. I looked at our last review which was the first time we ever came here in 2014.The place has changed.They added tables umbrellas decorations. Looks great   time has passed and we change .Could not remember what the female owner has a unique name.We come to the window  lady walks away does not say one moment to us. Comes back to window My husband says hi the friendly person that he is.Her response was a huh or something. My husband said does Sulma still work here she sarcastically said yes I live here.Come to find out 7 yrs have gone by we change you changed.Did not mean no disrespect.My husband said my wife has been wanting a CA burrito  I kept telling her this place may have it.We stopped by Sulema sarcastically said she don t need to come you could have came I don t know about her but she can you know. I was shocked of the unfriendly service we experienced and rudest as we were one of her first reviews and promoted by mouth. We love supporting small businesses. I get it you may be stressed as you were busy today when we came.However  our experience was very disappointing.I wish reviews could have the stars seperated. My rating is based off her rudeness. I guess we expected her same kindness we recieved in 2014.We have come many times before and there was no need for another review she has alwys been respectful.The food as always excellent .Shocked is all.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,48,A bit pricy but worth the flavor. My go tos are usually the Sonora and the Yaqui dog with their agua fresca. I didn t think I would get full with just two hot dogs but they fill them up with all the works  beans cheese  salsa  bacon  that it definitely fills you up. If you re craving something new or some hot dogs you have to give these Sonoran dogs a try. You won t regret it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,49,I AM OBSESSED  Best food truck in atx  The service is great the food is delicious  . Love this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,50,Amazing food - highly recommend everything on the menu. The flavors are amazing and the tortillas are super fresh. I have had the burritos  plates and tacos and nothing has missed. Super nice owners and great vibes.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,51,This is my buddy s favorite place to eat in Austin. So of course  I had to try it  And man was I blown away. I ve had bacon-wrapped hot dogs before. But this was a whole nother level. The toppings added so much extra flavor. But the real game changer here was the bun. Not only was the bun soft and sweet  it was strong enough to hold everything on the whole time. Nothing fell off whenever I took a bite.  This was my last going out meal before quarantine started and you best believe it will be my first when quarantine is over 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,52,I am obsessed with their hot dogs   Specially the Chile g eros they have. My favorite is their Sonoran hot dog. This is definitely a place I can eat every day at.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,53,Yes  yes and more yes. The only place I know where you can get authentic and delicious Sonoran style Mexican food. I miss these Arizona style burritos more than anything...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,54,If I could give this place all the stars in the world I would. The people that work there are as amazing as the food. Definitely one of my favorite places in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,55,We knew we wanted to try this place the first time we visited the Food Truck park. And  today was the day for T-Loc s. We all went Sonoran style and  WOW  firm believer in doing it the way the chef intends at least on the first round. Perfection  That bun  the crispy dog  fresh toppings... the jalape o sauce... and the aioli on the fries... fresh  not your ordinary hot dog.. plus we got to hear a little about the origins of the cuisine... great experience and we will be back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,56,As a Tucson local who just moved to Austin  TX  I was craving a good spot of Sonoran Mexican food. That craving was satisfied by T Loc s  Their carne asada tacos were amazing and very authentic  the Sonoran hot dogs were incredible and I couldn t recommend this food truck more 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,57,This is just one of those spots. IYKYK  Their hot dogs are phenomenal you just can t go wrong. Their ranch fries are also great so don t sleep on them like I did on my first visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,58,The Sonoran hot dog is great  The burritos and fries are also very good. Lots of flavor. The folks running the truck are very attentive.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,59,Truly authentic Sonoran Hot dogs  great tasting  lots of flavor. Staff was very friendly and attentive  place is very clean...but best of all great tasting food. Better than Gueros.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,60,T-locs is by far my favorite food truck in Austin  They ve got the best hot dogs  The buns are delicious  the sausage is wrapped with bacon  and don t get me started on the caramelos  it s like a quesadilla but much tastier . The people working the food truck are really friendly.  Unfortunately they re closed on Sundays.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,61,Everything we ordered was delicious  T-Loc s did not disappoint. The hot dog definitely lives up to the hype. I ve never had anything like it. I usually don t enjoy hot dogs but this one is on a whole  nother level. I would recommend upgrading the hot dog from the Bar S or else the hot dog meat will get overpowered by the other flavors which isn t necessarily a bad thing at all  I guess it s just what you prefer. The carne asada fries also tied for favorite dish. The spicy pickled carrots and jalape os are an excellent touch. The torta and the taco were also excellent. I recommend trying one of everything tbh  The customer service is on point too. Everyone seems to love what they do there. This place has a very welcoming feeling to it. I can t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,62,Friendly folks.  Good hot dogs.  I usually get the ones with everything.  I go during the week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,63,Yummy    Didn t think I would like mayonnaise on a hot dog but this was awesome   Great customer service 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,64,I m not sure why I haven t reviewed this place yet - the sonoran-style hot dog here is amazing  and it s better not just than other hot  dogs  which aren t many to be honest   but to most sandwiches and burgers in general.   It has a complex flavor and texture  which again is particularly impressive since it s a hod dog. It s fresh and creamy and meaty and toasty.  One thing I will note - I also recently went again and tried the burrito  and while it was pretty good  it was nowhere near as good as the amazing hot dog so I would recommend just getting those when you come  more than 1 if you want a bigger meal.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,65,The bun makes the hot dog. It s crispy and gives it a crunch. I love all the sauces they drizzle on the hotdog too and all the onions tomatoes.   It s a bit messy  so don t come on a first date.    Overall it s good  but I was expecting the sausage itself to be more unique.   I m torn between giving them 3 or 4 stars. It s hard for a hotdog to blow my mind.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,66,Love their Sonora style hotdogs.. The carne asada burrito is also great and it s the best burrito in Austin.     Mike and Zulma are really nice  friendly and even gave our pup a treat     When we had friends or family visiting from Cali I would take them to T- Locs.   If you re in Austin go check them out  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,67,This great little food truck right off of Burnet Road has some of the best hotdogs you will ever taste in your life  They also have super fast and friendly service. The hotdog bun was probably the best hotdog bun I ve ever tasted  and I understand they are flown in a couple of times a week from Tucson. You won t go wrong with a visit to this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,68,One of the best veggie hot dogs period. We ordered just 1 first and than before finishing it we had second one already being ordered which tells how much we liked it. Heard a lot of good reviews about them and this one lived out to the expectation. People who work here are also very kind and friendly. The cheese tacos were also good but beware of the side grilled
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,69,The best hot dogs in Austin bar none....we are repeat customers and it always a treat to be able to there.  You have to get a Sonora dog - all the way and a yaky.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,70,When you think of hot dogs  backyard barbecues and New York come to mind. Well  consider T-Loc s a part of that image now   I ordered the Veggie Sonoran Dog and the biggest difference is it s not bacon-wrapped and it s vegenaise instead of mayo. The most impressive part of the hot dog is the bun - perfectly toasted while still being light and airy. This is a seriously loaded hot dog  in the best way possible  so it feels like you get a new bite every time.   And their Chicken and Cheese Quesadilla was seriously one of the best quesadillas I ve ever eaten  The tortilla was beautiful looking and tasting because of the flattop they re cooking it on  something you can never exactly replicate at home .   I think the price for quality and quantity of food is great. The owners were friendly and my order didn t take too long to be ready.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,71,I want to talk soccer  but I don t wanna BORE HER I wanna go to sleep  but I still wanna EXPLORE HER I have to make sure that I don t come BEFORE HER But first I ll take her to T-Loc s SONORA  I found their business card in my sock DRAWER I come here when I m richer  come when I m POORER She doesn t like it much  but whatevs  I still ADORE HER And I ll still keep coming back to T-Loc s SONORA  Tastes almost as good as the late SEXY CORA It made me so sad  as I had so much love FOR HER No-one can deny I m the best food TOURER And one of the best hot dogs I ve had s at T-Loc s SONORA  WHAT  Sonora later you have to try T-Loc s Sonora.  Me and the sexy goddess have totally different opinions on this place which is fine because we often do.  If they sold Grease gang members  it d be T-Bird s Sonora.  I love these messy Mexican hot dogs and this one reminds me of the ones that they sell in Los Angeles and in San Francisco on the streets after the clubs let out and whatnot or in Downtown LA during the daytime.  If they sold steaks  it d be T-Bone s Sonora.  The people running this truck are actually from Tucson Arizona  but they must know how the Mexicans make their dogs because it s actually really good. I was honestly really surprised about how good it was.  If they were the best boba chain ever  it d be T-Top s Sonora.  You may think it s a little steep  price wise. But compared to some of the other trucks here it s not even overpriced. I mean it s not cheap but it s not ridiculously over-the-top like some of the others are - and you do get a huge delicious juicy Perfection product that will probably fill you up.  Speaking of hot dogs that will fill you up.  Anyway.  If they liked to molest you while pretending to check for contraband  it d be TSA-Loc s Sonora.  The guys working here incredibly nice too  and the girls as well. They were very inquisitive as to whether we liked it and asked us to spread the word - and little do they know that I have quite a few followers on Yelp LOL. So listen to me and go and give it a try because it s worth it. In fact  it s like L Oreal in that regard  but much  much better tasting.  And if they sold male chastity devices  they d be D-Lock s Sonora.  But I m really  really glad that they don t.  One of the best hot dogs in the country  maybe the best in Texas. When it comes to the best dogs in Austin  they ve got it on D-Lock.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,72,One of the best hot dogs I ve ever had  I grab pizza rolls over by Rockin rolls then I grab a Sonoran dog as well. They have great carne asada tacos if you re not feeling hot dogs. The couple who run this spot work hard and are always so friendly. I drive from San Antonio to eat here and it s worth it every time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,73,Was on my way back to campus when I decided to pull up Yelp and see what was good in the area. Found this place with a 5 star rating and delicious photos so my mind was set. Ordered the sonora hot dog first and then just had to try the carne asada taco.  For the hot dog  man that bun is just so so soft  All the ingredients come together with so many different flavors  one of the best hot dogs i ve had  For the carne asada taco  it has to be the juiciest carne asada Ive ever had. I had to balance the taco otherwise if I tilted it in either direction  the juice would just run right out  The owners you can tell absolutely love what they do and their passion shows in their great cooking    Definitely coming back here   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,74,I rarely update my reviews.  This is the first time in over 1000 reviews that I have updated twice.  Why the update here   Because there is news.  I normally am a fan of the T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog.  The T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog is my idea of a treat.  The T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog is how I reward myself.  If this is not the time or place for a long night of infused vodkas from Russian House  then I go to T-Loc and get myself a hot dog.  The world then becomes perfect.  Well due to certain conditions beyond my control - the astrological sign was wrong or something like that - I didn t go with my normal hot dog.  I went with the Carne Asada burrito.  I took the liberty - which is NOT house style - of reheating the burrito at home with the avocado inside of it.  I have had T-Loc s Carne Asada plates with cool avocado.  I have had the Carne Asada Burrito with warm mashed down avocado.  Trust me on this one - the warm avocado takes the dish to a brand new level.  The steak and the seasonings are already epic.   The steak has always been majorly majorly epic.   Their sauces are already outstanding.  The warmed avocado takes the dish to Godhead.  Normally - coronavirus is sad because we have to take all our truck food home.   And  by the way  people are dying too.   Coronavirus making us reheat food in the microwave is an awesome opening.  I have not been this happy with a burrito in a long long time.  T-Loc s Carne Asada Burrito is a wonderful source of happiness while all the world falls apart around us.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,75,OMG. Sonora Dog. With everything.  Wrapped in bacon  with beans  tomato  onion  mayo  mustard and I m sure I m forgetting things . Add cheese and carne asada. I could end the review there. But I won t.  So  this is the first time I have ever only eaten half a hot dog. Why you ask  Because it was so good  I want to have the other half for lunch or snack another day. I know that pretty much makes me certifiable. I don t care.  I have a theory about certain foods  finger foods of sorts such as dogs  burgers  sandwiches  etc. if it wasn t messy  it wasn t good. Or at least it wasn t made right. A good one of any of those should be more than sloppy. You should unquestionably be required to like not just your fingers after  but also the rest of your hand s . And THEN go wash them.  This hot dog not only didn t disappoint  it raised the bar. It is the gold standard. I can complain about only one thing. It needs more spice to actually be spicy. But that s not a real complaint because that thing was good. Very  very good.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,76,Hard to describe the sonoran dog. It s simply...delicious. And the staff is as exceptional as the meal. What a gem.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,77,The best hot dog and carne asada fries i ve had  might want to get it to-go or the mosquitoes will eat you
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,78,So amazing  I grew up in Tucson and was raised on Sonoran style food. This is a perfect slice of home. Very authentic and delicious  I always order at least two Sonoran dogs every time I come and their Agua Fresca tastes amazing and is refreshing.   Highly recommend ordering  con todo 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,79,This place did not disappoint -the owner and staff were very friendly and welcoming. This was my first time here -but it will not be the last. The food was outstanding well prepared and super delicious I had the Sonoran dog with all the extras it was delicious.My daughter and grandson both have the loaded Yaqui dog topped with a fried egg. Also shared a large order of their very delicious ranch fries. I recommend if you wanna great hotdog experience give this place a try .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,80,I haven t eaten a hot dog since I was 13. I m almost 23 and this was the best hot dog I ve ever had. Also the folks behind the counter are sooo nice  I haven t had such good food  amp  hospitality in a long time  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,81,The guy who makes the hot dogs is super nice and welcoming. I ordered the yaqui dog and carne asada fries. 10 10 recommend this place food is bomb. Going to try the eggsplosion next time I come.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,82,Everything here is great  you can t go wrong. Very impressed by the vegan dog. It s a flavor explosion. Everything is fresh and you can taste it. We haven t found a better Sonora style dog  The Owners staff are very friendly  Such a gem 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,83,Damn this was so good my eyes rolled back onto my head  I moaned out load that I got stares on first bite. We had the Sonoran hot dog which was the perfect combination of sweet  salty  sour and spicy. The carne asada taco and Baja burrito were perfect as well with super fresh toasted tortillas. Don t miss out on the unusual agua Fresca flavors which we had the strawberry Orange.  This place gets all the praise.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,84,Very nice owner. The hotdog was delicious. I also tried their pineapple aqua fresca. Probably one of the best I ve had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,85,Don t be fooled by the name of the truck. We had the Asada quesadilla and it was good as you can get. There s probably more Mexican food options than hot dogs. I d recommend the owners figure out to their guests about their amazing Mexican food. Be patient they were a little slow but worth the wait.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,86,Amazing food. Despite the rather small trailer  the food they put out here is amazing. We ordered two sonora dogs and carne asada fries and can t wait to go back. They even have a small and mostly socially distanced area for eating.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,87,DELICIOUS. Can t believe I waited this long to try this place. I am only halfway done with my hotdog and I m already sad in anticipation of it being gone. I got the Sonoran hot dog and a cucumber lime aguas fresca. Crispy bacon  soft but toasted bun  excellent toppings  delicious pinto beans. 10 10  I want to get another one immediately.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,88,Yesterday I had a life-changing experience.  New to the Austin area  I wanted a hot-dog  googled  and found T-Loc s Sonora.  Having once lived in the Los Angeles area  I was already familiar with bacon-wrapped dogs piled high with delicious additions  so immediately upon seeing pictures  my mouth was watering  and I was ready to find them.  As I was reading through the reviews  I noticed lots of enthusiasm around their steak burrito.  It was a tough decision to decide between the two  so I ordered one of each.   -   I had ordered online  and the food was ready well before I found their place  not hard to find  but being new here I just didn t know the area .  When I pulled in to their lot  one of their staff came to bring my order right away.  They were gracious and kind.  Great Service   Great service is good  but really  it s all about the food  right   T-Loc s Sonoran hotdogs are absolutely wonderful   Their dogs are flavorful with bacon-y wrapped goodness  the toppings are generous but balanced enough to be flavorful and not too too messy  just a little .  A true Sonoran dog isn t like getting a hotdog with stuff just slathered on top. It s got enough ingredients that it must be crafted well...no single item should overpower the flavors of the rest.  And then there s the bun...  Yes  the bun is very special.  It s something very different than your typical hotdog bun.  It s steamed instead of grilled  so it s soft  moist  ever so slightly sweet and delicious      It absorbs the ingredients enough to become an integral part of the dish.  Often I find myself discarding  extra  bits of bun...in this case  I couldn t get enough of it.  T-Loc s Sonoran Hotdogs are simply incredible   But there s more...  As good as the hotdogs were  and I will return for more   T-Loc s Carne Asada Burrito was the heart of the life changing experience.  It s deceptively simple.  It s a flour tortilla filled with steak  pico de gallo  and avocado.  Two bites into it  the second bite only to confirm what I suspected after my first bite   I realized that  although I ve traveled the world and eaten many burritos   I was eating the BEST burrito I have ever tasted   Again  perfect balance of flavors...but a Carne Asada SO bursting with flavor that just thinking about it a day later makes my mouth water again.  You may not associate words like food truck  hotdogs  and burritos with the word gourmet...until you visit T-Loc s Sonoran  then your life will be changed.  Food like this doesn t  just happen  by accident.  It s created and crafted by a deliberate act of art  love and passion.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,89,If I could design a perfect hot dog for myself  it would look nothing like the  con todo  served here... and it would taste nowhere near as good. It s not an especially big or especially cheap item  but its quality still makes it especial. And as with most food trucks  there are friendly people behind the counter to take and make your order. Conclusion  I ll be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,90,Burritos  hotdogs and carne asada fried were all on point  Fire  Definitely recommend if in the area
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,91,Food is awesome as always I wish I could eat here every day. Service amazing as always same with food eat a Sonora dog today.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,92,I can t stop ordering the Ranch Fries from T-Loc s. They are  as my husband says   stupid good.  The hot dogs are phenomenal  but now that I know about the fries  I have a difficult decision to make every time. Anyway  you really can t go wrong with anything here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,93,Okay  let me just start off by saying that their hotdogs taste just like the hotdogs back home  These are true AUTHENTIC Sonoran dogs. The ONLY ones I ll eat here in Texas. You truly will not be disappointed  Also  shoutout to all my Arizona peeps  Gotta represent
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,94,Shame on me for not reviewing this gem sooner  they deserve our utmost support and patronage for their outstanding mastery of the secret Sonoran treasure known as the hot dog.   Seriously  this is the ONLY place I ve been to outside of Tucson that does this right. Sonoran dogs are diamonds  rare  hard to find  and one of quality is worth more than gold.   The Sonoran Hot Dogs here are works of art. In a city obsessed with great food  T-Locs stands out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,95,This food is the real deal flavors of Sonora   Fresh  well flavored meats  we the tacos a la plancha  the carne asada and torta and Sonoran hotdog.   Authentic flavors  fresh bread  well seasoned meats.  I ll be back soon 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,96,The owner Miguel is so sweet and makes sure your experience is top notch. The Sonoran hot dogs are definitely something you can t get in elsewhere. The variety of hotdogs suits anyone s needs - traditional pork  Hebrew National beef  and veggie dogs. I also got carne asada fries which were loaded with 1 4 lb of meat along with great accoutrements. This food truck is always hoppin  and rightly so 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,97,First time trying this place and it was sooo good  For me the loaded fries were the best  It s a bit of a drive for me but will deff go again. Dk if he is the owner or who he was but love that he came out and talk to me asked how I was liking the food. Nice touch 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,98,I was craving dessert and decided as a nearby suggestion found this food truck park... and somehow convinced myself get hot dogs as well. The Sonora hot dog sounded quite interesting while passing by  and decided to try some. The people who run the truck are absolutely amazing  super friendly  funny  and passionate about their business. Mustard is something I usually avoid and usually ask to keep off my hot dogs  but after some convincing from Miguel I decided to keep it on. Despite being a super busy truck that day  it only took about 5 minutes to get both hot dogs.   For the food  the hotdogs are absolutely amazing. Honestly probably the best hot dog I ve had. There s so many flavors that I m surprised they all mesh together so nicely. I probably ate the entire hot dog in like 2 minutes. Highly recommend and will be my new stop for whenever I m craving a hot dog now. We also ordered the Carne Asada fries  but the meat was a little bit too salty for me to eat. But all around an amazing food truck 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,99,I love Sonora Dogs but really not had a proper one since El Guero Canelo in Tuscon. But  this place might be just as good or better  How could anyone not like a bacon wrapped hot dog with essentially taco filling inside a sweet fluffy toasted bun. Also add to the story that serve they have a Ranch Fries that are covered in bacon  cheese  homemade ranch with crinkle cut fries     This is a must have item for sure to go with your dogs you will for sure double fist.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,100,Their Sonora Hot Dog is exactly what I wanted out of a delicious  new flavor of a classic treat. The bun on this thing is so soft but holds it s structure  the beans are full of flavor  the sauces work perfectly together and the bacon adds to the overall texture and bite of the hot dog. This is a new favorite spot of mine.   This lot has about 8 food trucks all with a nice variety of things from ice cream tacos to Thai food and JewBoys Burgers. It s great  Got to check this out if you want a break from your normal routine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,101,Heard about T-Loc s through word of mouth and this is by far the best. Not only is the food amazing  the owners areal so awesome and friendly  the vibe is like friends all hanging out in the backyard eating amazing food. The hot dogs wrapped in bacon  with added ingredients I wouldn t think to add on makes my mouth water just writing this. The tacos are also fantastic but you must and absolutely must order the carne Asada fries  can t even explain how amazing those are   hurry  Asada sells out fast  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,102,Good food and the owner is a cool dude that takes pride in his product.  Can t really ask for more than that. And those hot peppers  ahhhh 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,103,They make you feel like family   VIP treatment and the food is always consistently delicious 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,104,From day one my family and I have loved this place   The owners are very friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious.  Best hotdogs in Austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,105,Absolutely the best burrito in Austin.  Locally owned and operated and community focused. Definitely give them a try
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,106,Hot dog this place is so yummy   I recommend it all.  It s a little truck in the food truck park off burnet.  Dessert is also really tasty.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,107,I didn t know a hot dog could be that good  I can t wait to go back to try more from the menu. Absolutely amazing 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,108,Every now and then I crave a good weenie. Who doesn t  If you want something really unique  to ATX anyway   visit T-Loc s and go all in by ordering a legit Sonoran  as in Mexico  hot dog with all its toppings  aka  con todo    dog wrapped in bacon topped with pinto beans  caramelized  onions  raw onions  tomato  and squirts of mayo  mustard  and Caribbean pepper sauce. It looks intimidating and sounds a bit confusing  but wow  what a mouthful of yum  Yes  the Sonoran style dog is as messy to eat as it looks. That s okay - the uber friendly owner  Miguel  won t hesitate to provide you with a big handful of napkins  is it sinful to ask for a fork  ...and tell you about his journey and explain exactly what the heck a Sonoran is. In short  it s tasty  it s different  it s filling  and it ll only set you back 5 bucks  add  1 if you prefer a Hebrew National .    If you re not feeling particularly adventurous  T-Loc s does offer some standard dogs  as well as burritos  quesadillas  some breakfast items and more...BUT please at least try a Sonoran once. Admittedly  my minimalist French s mustard only on hot dog hubby wasn t a huge fan. In any event  he can at least say he s had and knows what a Sonoran is. Culture - food - good.  D  Note  to keep their food as legit as possible  the buns and tortillas are shipped in from AZ. Now that s commitment to quality.   Tip  T-Loc s food trailer is located in the 5000 Burnet  food court   parking is a breeze  and you can BYOB. Cheers 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,109,Great service food is amazing     I had carne assada fries and hot dog   totally recommend
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,110,There s a reason why this place is 5 stars on Yelp. The people who run the truck are SO friendly  they informed us about everything and were kind and patient.   Me and my friend ordered the Con Todo hot dog and the Carne Asada burrito. The guy who runs it wiped down the tables for us because it was raining. Talk about caring for his customers  He brought out the food to us and it looked delicious. He even told us the origin of the name and where they came from. In Arizona  there s plenty of hot dog stands but none in Austin. How cool that he shared that with us.   Unfortunately I had to be on the phone for an insurance call  so I m not sure if the hot dog got a little soggy in the bread. Nonetheless  it was yummy.   But the burrito was amazing. I dream about it sometimes. Like  damn  The sauce is fantastic and the limes compliment it so well.   If you have to order something  get the carne asada burrito. You won t regret it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,111,I ve never had a better hot dog  The bun is so good  not sure what type of bread it is  but it s great. Just try this place  it ll become one of your favorites.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,112,If you want Sonoran style food come here  Absolutely the best Sonoran hot dog in Texas  Great food  Great service 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,113,Stumbled upon this place when we visited Austin. We ordered Sonoran hotdogs  carne asada fries  beef burrito  and agua Fresca. Everything was good. 4 stars because price was a bit high for hotdogs with added toppings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,114,Oh  gosh I loved their food. Their hotdog is so good  especially the bread. I also tried their fries  which was super good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,115,This dog is awesome. The toppings mix for an unbelievably tasty bite. The bun is slightly sweet and just perfectly dense.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,116,This is the carne asada burrito I have been in search of. No frills  just carne  pico de gallo  and guacamole. None of the other junk that everyone else seems to think they need to put inside burritos here in Austin.  If you are familiar with the  berto  chain of hole in the wall Mexican food places all over southern California and Arizona  this will remind you exactly of those burritos.  The carne here is better quality than what I remember the socal chain to be.  I will have to give the hot dogs a try next time but it will be tough to pass up the burrito so I might have to save my macros and go for both.   Now let s get the carne asada nachos going and my diet could be in for some serious problems.   Anyhow  if you are from Cali or the southwest I would definitely recommend you give this truck a try.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,117,Miguel still whips up the most amazing dogs in town  but now there are new options as well  including a quesadillas and a taco menu.  My favorite is the Tacos a La Plancha  grilled  with beans and sizzling cheese on corn tortillas .  Every time people see my order they want to know what it is because it looks as amazing as it tastes.  His location is now in a new trailer food court  partially hidden by a building in the front.  But it s easy access off Burnet Road and there s plenty of parking in the lot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,118,When my wife got pregnant  we looked for a local hotdog joint and was able to find this place on the road while cruising on Burnet.   This place is amazing  every food item is freshly cooked to order and the flavors are incredible. Each time we go we try to get something new.  The owners are incredibly friendly and helpful with any questions on orders.   This is now a regular place we go to when we crave hotdogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,119,Suuuuper delicious everything and speedy  Everything I ve tried I ve loved- I m particularly a huge fan of their strawberry agua fresca  they change them well tho . Will come again and again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,120, 3.5 star    FOOD   I had his Hebrew Hot dog and Carne Asada Burrito. I personally enjoyed the food really much  but was not certain for its price. The quality was mediocre personally  but do know I had these take out. For hot dog  the bun was perfectly toasted and blending of all toppings and its hot dog was incredible. The steak on the burrito was well cooked and could be more juicy than how it was.   ATMOSPHERE   This is one of 12 5000 Burnet Food Truck area.   SERVICE   To be honest  he wasn t going crazy at explaining and stuff as other owners that I visited around the food truck area. I got all my stuff and it was a typical service.  SURROUNDINGS   This is one of 12 5000 Burnet Food Truck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,121,Carnitas French fries are off the hoooook  My boo and I stopped here for lunch and this was the only option that seemed reasonably priced and looked appetizing at the time. We split the fries and a Sonoran hot dog.   Beans on a hot dog  Not my thing but I can see why people would love it. The ladies running the truck were friendly and quick  talk about hustle  Make it a point to stop at this food truck while at 5000 Burnet.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,122,I don t think I ve ever craved a hot dog before  but Jeff M. insisted on starting our Austin eating escapade at T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs  TLSHD . I kind of wish that we didn t start with it  since it s such a tough act to follow.   TLSHD s Sonoran Hot Dog was stupidly good. I saw pictures of the hot dog and thought   ehhh  it looks like a hot dog with relish and mayo. It can t be that good.  I couldn t be more wrong. The  relish  is a jalape o sauce that wasn t very spicy at all  but it added a great amount of flavor. My favorite part of the hot dog was the bun  The dog was served on a bolillo  a type of French bread  that they special order from Arizona every week. It had the slightest bit of crisp but was unbelievably soft on the inside. We tried to get the name of the bakery  but their lips were sealed. The dog also comes with a grilled pepper that s slightly salted and grilled. Delicious   The staff was pretty nice too. They came out and explained what was used in the dog  what made the dog a Sonoran Hot Dog  and they told us the proper way to eat the hot dog  take a bite of the dog  then bite the pepper .  I can t say enough good things about TLSHD  Everything was delicious and it made me want to get another one right away. Get yourself to TLSHD and get yourself one of these glorious dogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,123,These Sonora hot dogs are one of a kind  and once you try them you won t stop craving them   I definitely recommend putting this on your Austin foodie list 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,124,I  can see how a lot of people would miss out on the perfect hot dog by being picky or reluctant to try all of the ingredients. Do yourself a favor and get over it. Try the Sonoran hot dog  con todo.  It s perfect. If we lived in Austin  we would be here on the reg. The other items on the menu looked amazing  especially the steak fries. We tried to go back the next day  but they are closed on Sundays.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,125,This place is always a hit never a miss. From staff friendly and caring attitude to the bomb a   food. My wife and always keep coming back. The Sonora con todo is
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,126,Super friendly service and delicious dogs loaded with toppings. Were very accommodating with masks and mentioned how the buns are shipped in daily from Arizona. Got loaded carne asada fries that were big enough to share and then some. Flavorful and fresh with some great crispness to the fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,127,Fantastic hotdogs and buns  I m not sure how they get them to taste so fresh and light but they re delicious  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,128,THE BEST ESTABLISHMENT IN AUSTIN    The absolute nicest and kindest owners. Your meal is always served with laughs and good stories. I have been coming here for six years and have never had anything but amazing food and good times. Every single thing on their menu is phenomenal. When I get married I ll ask them to cater the wedding and probably perform the service. Seriously  I can t even convey how much I love T-Loc s. You are missing out if you don t eat here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,129,There is definitely something special going on here   I will be honest I have never ever been too excited about hot dogs in my life.  The ones I prefer are generally covered in chili and cheese  but that is not what is going on here at all   This is what I would call hot dog art   What is coming out of this food trailer on burnet is genius     I have mentioned in other reviews before how sometimes simple is perfection - this is the same for Sonora.  The menu is pretty simple - not many items at all - perfection rolling out to turn your world upside down     So here is how it works with the hot dog  - you choose your wiener - regular  premium or veggie  i got premium bc it s national Hebrew and those are the bomb  - and that s it ... you wait   What comes out is a bacon wrapped hot dog sitting in the beautiful fluffy cloud of a bun and all kinds of crazy goodness on top  It s amazing - I promise  Trust me.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,130,The Carne Asada fries are dank  The food was fresh and delicious. For sure going back. Thanks T-Loc 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,131,I was so happy to stop in here tonight. I had recently found out about it and ever since my introduction to the Sonora Dog in my birthplace of Tucson  I was making it a point to stop in sooner than later.   From the moment I walked up to the food truck window I knew I was in the presence of a fellow T-Loc  Tucson Local  with the owner operator  Miguel. Us Tucsonians somehow have a way of finding each other outside our hometown. Miguel was so nice and we talked the entire time he was busily making mad  crazy orders of sonora dog after sonora dog.  I got mine w o onions and yellow mustard and it was just as amazing and delicious as I remember it  I also got the  6 Hebrew National version because I get kosher whenever it s available and because you can really taste that  1 difference   I was also tickled that they had the orange Jarritos  basically the upscale version of a Fanta  and after popping the top I was immediately having flashbacks to my childhood in Tucson and Nogales  AZ.    So thank you  T-Locs for the delectable  nostalgic edible memories  Horale 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,132,BEST HOT DOGS in Austin   The burrito and carne asada fries are the best. Sulma and Mike are so friendly  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,133,The hot dog is so good    Fantastic quality and amazing flavor  I deeply recommend  I got the hot dog with everything  and they make a small one for children.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,134,Literally the nicest and coolest people  They have INCREDIBLE veggie hotdogs. I wake up in the middle of the night and my first thought is their ranch fries. They have special menus for special occasions like  national hotdog day   They always treat me like family. I downloaded the yelp app just so you can all know it s incredible  so go there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,135,Definitely a reason this place has 5 starts and almost 400 reviews.   How good can a hot dog get  This place has set the standard. I was a little hesitant seeing a bacon wrapped hot dog thinking the bacon would be messy. But the bacon is wrapped perfectly around the hot dog where it doesn t get in the way. If the toppings on the hot dog worry you  don t be. The flavors work wonderfully together. And the bun... just perfect.   Agua fresca is a great addition to drink along with it. Don t skip it.  Parking can be a little bit of a hassle on the actual lot  but there are neighboring park lots.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,136,I wore a mask while ordering but when I sat down i had something new on my face... The most amazing burrito I ve ever had. This place is the forking best location for food. Full stop. Period. End of story. Put the cattle in the barn. House slippers comfy comfort food. The flavors  the service  the food are all the best. Don t waste your time anywhere else  The carne asada fries were my favorite. Like walk a mile on hot coals good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,137,Love this place. Amazing service. One of the best burritos in Austin. The hot dog con todo also lives up to the hype.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,138,If you ve ever been to Tucson or the Sonoran region  you know that Sonoran hot dogs are something you can t find anywhere else. Even the bread that is used for these is a specialty  so these guys are making literal magic happen to deliver an authentic Sonoran hot dog all the way in Texas.  If you re asking yourself  how could a hot dog be that good   - check them out for yourself. Once you have one  you ll understand that yes  Sonoran hot dogs really are legendary.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,139,Love the dogs at Yo-Yos in Houston.  Read the reviews and had to try these out.  To say they are special is an understatement.  They have sweet  spicy  sour  and savory all in the same bite.    There is a reason they are too 10 in the US year after year.  Some of the nicest people you will ever meet.   Pony up and enjoy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,140,Always friendly. Always yummy. Always fresh. It s like going to a friends house for a special lunch or dinner in their patio. The carne asada burrito is the best. Especially once they taught me how to use the green sauce and lime 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,141,Great hot dogs. Hands down. Amazing taste. Not Spicey at all Even though it comes with peppers. Recommend peppers. and the papas bravas were the best fries with shrimp anywhere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,142,Best hot dog in Austin tx by far    And don t even mention their Asada Burritos just amazing   5000 Burnet rd go and try it   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,143,This place is a must try  Everything I ve had is amazing. Yaqui dog and ranch fries hit the spot  Definitely recommend you try to go at lunch. Dinner time on a Friday was a bit busy but worth the wait 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,144,Amazing food and people. The hot dogs and burritos de carne asada are the best  Can t go wrong with the fries either.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,145,Anticipation had been building for months. I could not wait another day to finally taste Tone Loc s Funky Hot Sonora dog. I had my parody rap review half written. Then Joe C. had to go all Urban Dictionary on me and ruin the dream by informing me that  T-Loc  in fact stands for  Tuscon Local.  Turns out the adorable proprietors have made it to Austin by way of Arizona.   Okay  fine  but oooh  that bacon-wrapped dog  Such a fresh  pillowy bun. Such tasty toppings  Such a flavorful meat  Such a pleasing texture  crispy where you need it  tender where you don t. And then there s that freshly grilled pepper... Oh my  do not miss the perfection of a bite of the pepper with a mouthful of the dog. Spicy heaven   I m watching my figure  or I certainly would have devoured 2 or 3 of these bad boys. You bet I ll be back. This week. Or tomorrow.

T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,146,Whenever we come to Austin we always search for amazing places with great ratings in advance. With a couple of weeks worth planing this was the first stop for food and boy was it amazing    We got the Carne Asada Fries and the famous con todo hotdog ALLL the way    My girlfriend and I split sense we plan on shoving more food down our goblets. Everything we ate was fresh and authentic.  So the Con Todo comes with  mustard  frijoles  tomatoe  onion  mayo  jalape os and a hotdog wrapped with bacon on a fresh steamed bun.  P.S. It Broke my heart to see people ordering from here and just wanted no jalape os  no mayo  no onions  no mustard and asked for...KETCHUP...people live and try new things. You don t see of find a lot of food trucks that are passionate about what they do.  JUST TRY IT  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,147,I m from Tucson but live in Dallas. This lunch was AMAZING and brought me right back to home. The owners are outstanding people who work very hard to make your experience great 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,148,This hot dog is pretty damn tasty. The bun is perfect too  toasty and fluffy. I m not a big hot dog person but wanted to try it and got it made the way they do it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We got fries as well and a nice mexican coke. The guy is really nice. Try it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,149,I started coming here around Winter 2014. Miguel  the owner  asked me how I found out about the place since they recently moved to Austin to start T-Loc s. I was craving for a good hot dog joint and that led me to their fabulous food truck on Burnet. Miguel s very personable and every time you meet him it seems like old friends reuniting again. This Sonora Hot Dog is my favorite hot dog of all time. Nothing I ve had in the past has compared to this hot dog. Everything on this hot dog fits perfectly together - the combination of flavors from the bacon wrapped dog to the diced tomatoes are amazing. The best part  the bun. My goodness  I wish HEB sold these buns. But apparently Miguel gets the buns shipped from a different region. The burrito is excellent too  I have introduced friends to this food truck and they have raved about it. When you talk about the food culture of Austin  food trucks plays a big role and T-Loc s is one of the best.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,150,To put it briefly  I AM HOOKED     This is the best hot dog I ve ever had. Get it all the way and ask for a Hungarian wax pepper on the side. Also have the carne asada fries they are over the top as well. To top it all off the owners are fantastically fun. Can t wait to come back    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,151,I sometimes feel funny saying this  but I now have a  favorite hot dog place.  I ve never been one to crave hot dogs growing up  but that s likely because I never grew up having a hot dog like the ones Miguel and Zulma serve up at Sonora. Others have described the famous Con Todo hot dog so I won t go into much here  but think of their signature hot dog like a gourmet hot dog with all the works and then some. Miguel is an accomplished chef and he brings that culinary experience and spirit to all of his menu items. Every ingredient on the hot dog is purposeful and is served in just the right quantity. And the bun is to die for. It gets shipped in daily from New Mexico so this is the real deal. Once you ve had the Sonora bun  you ll be wondering why all hot dogs don t get served in a Sonora bun. Trust me    I ve been a customer of theirs for nearly three years now  followed them across three different locations  and I can say the only thing that has changed is the menu now has more offerings  including fries  tacos  simple hot dogs for kids  and quesadillas. Remaining delightfully consistent over the years are the friendly owners behind Sonora  Miguel and Zulma  and the exceptionally consistent quality of their food. My wife and I always enjoy catching up with them  and since the very beginning  they have always treated us like family.  When the weather is nice outside  ask them about their homemade agua fresca. When they do have it  it sells out pretty much every day so get there early and ask for their agua fresca of the day   p.s. We also recommend their asada burrito  And did we mention the hot dog comes with this delicious grilled pepper  Man  sometimes I just crave that perfectly grilled and lightly salted pepper 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,152,A Sonoran hot dog    What is it  I must eat it  Those were the thoughts going through my head as a saw the food truck.   So a Sonoran dog is a hot dog  wrapped in bacon  with beans on it  tomatoes  onion  mustard  ketchup   jalape o sauce - hold the mayo - on a slightly sweet bun imported from Tucson   The dogs are grilled as you order them  amp  the bun is grilled to a nice crisp. It is one amazing dog   This is a must try food truck. You re going to be in hot dog heaven 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,153,I had a pleasant experience ordering here. It was my first time and the owner was super nice. I ordered the Sonora hot dog and it was delicious  I would definitely recommend trying this place if you are on the fence about it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,154,What can be said about this place that has not. Owners are friendly   get to know their customers  the hot dogs are fantastic blend of flavors and buns are spot on. I have eaten here at least a dozen times and the quality never fluctuates  even being someone who does not care for mustard it just works.   Would suggest trying the premium dogs and carne asada tacos    you can do one and one and get a nice plate that will make you want to walk home.   To the review on here complaining about the  hot dog  quality   exactly where have you eaten a Sonora dog off a cart that you questioned the hot dog used...pretty sure I don t want to know most of the times. The trade off here is good quality   good taste   good people and supporting someone that cares about who they are serving.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,155,The first time I heard of a Sonoran style hot dog was some time a few years ago on Man vs. Food. At the time I was skeptical of the combination. Mayo  Beans  Tomatoes  Jalepeno sauce  On a bacon wrapped hot dog  In a bolillo roll  There s absolutely nothing in this dish that resonates with any experience I ve ever had with a hot dog in my life. And now that I ve tried this combination  I can t help but wonder what had I been missing out on for so long.  The bolillo roll is really one of a kind - nothing like you find in any supermarkets here  almost a cross between a bolillo roll and a new england style hot dog bun but it just works. And when I saw that the regular hot dogs here were the Bar-S type  I was like eh but its salty punch helps balance out the rest of the flavors. I can t quite put my hand on it  but everything just works together so well in a soft but crisp roll. Despite that long list on condiments above  the condiments play a complementary role and don t overwhelm it. I can see why this place gets rave reviews.  That said  not sure I d pay  5 for the hot dog  I d think the Hebrew national would come default at that price but w e   since for most people I d feel they d need at least 2 to get full. Owner is super nice talkative guy too  Will come back to try out that carne asada and the burrito...and maybe another hot dog if I got change to spare.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,156,I ve eaten a lot of hot dogs. I m a self proclaimed hot dog connoisseur  with home grown NYC experience to back me up. Onto my review   I purchased the premium Sonara Hot Dog. This comes with a Hebrew National Frank instead of Bar S for  6. I was a little disappointed that it wasn t a longer size than your standard dog for the price  however the ingredients does make up  for it. The Sonara Hot Dog comes with bacon wrapped with onions  mayo mustard  chopped tomatoes  grilled onions  I got mine without these   jalapeno sauce  and beans. The ingredients meshed together really well taste-wise. You would need two to be truly satisfied given it s a regular sized hot dog. The bread was your plain ole Jane it was very tasty. I think the buns are a special order.   I won t be in a rush to come back here however  because I like the variety of Man  Bites Dog or Frank and I think you gret more bang for your buck in this price range however  you can t go wrong experiencing Sonara Hot Dog. The owner was very personable and he seem to have a good rapport with his clients. Sonara Hot Dogs does offer a couple of other items like a quesadilla and a burrito  but I kept it classic with what I believe it s known for.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,157,There was a time in the summer where I was obsessed with hot dogs. I ate a hot dog every day. I decided to try out this hot dog truck that everyone has been craving about. When I looked into it I was like wait  it has beans in it   Sounds interesting  I have to try it. My friend is quite the picky eater and was scared about all of the toppings on the hot dog  but she had to try the original one. The man that ran the truck was very accommodating and friendly. He suggested putting a tiny half line of mustard on her dog because she hates mustard. Turns out  the hype was real. Everything went together surprisingly well. The grilled pepper that came with it gave it a kick. It was pretty spicy though  not going to lie. I wish I could eat 5 of these  but I am at a point in my life where a  2 pack of hot dogs is all I can afford right now.  collegeprobs but hot dogs 4 lyfe
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,158,I ve been coming here for about 5 years and it s never disappointed me. Hard to imagine holding the same standard for such a long time  Hands down the best hot dog I ve ever had. I ll always seek you out and will drive hours to come see you  Keep it up buddy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,159,One of the many reasons I love Austin. This foodtruck is known for their amazing hot dogs  best in Texas for sure   but they also have the most yummiest  most perfect burritos.  The steak  the beans  the cheese  the tortilla...everything is perfect and magical. My boyfriend and I come here on average at least once a week.   A great ambiance too...a few other food trucks on the lot. Pretty clean area  a place for kids to play while you sit and enjoy either the best hot dog or best burrito in Austin . This used to be the only food truck on the lot...and now there are many after realizing it s perfect location.  Can t wait to have it again later this week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,160,Amazing Sonoran Dogs and Carne Asada from Tucson  Arizona. Very hard to find this type of food in Austin. Heads up the tortillas and hot dogs are much different than you normally see in town  which is awesome.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,161,They have the Best Vegan Dog EVER  Sweet bun  mayo  tomatoes  beans  hot sauce.  Wow.  My friends and I dream about these dogs often.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,162,I hadn t had a Sonoran hot dog in 4 years din r my last trip to Tucson. Upon arriving Miguel welcomed me and let me know these are authentic. The buns are flown in from Tucson and T-Locs actually stands for Tucson Locals. I fell in love with this dog again after first bite. I can t wait to visit again in October.

T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,163,Awesome. New way to eat a dog. The toppings and the bread are the stars of this show. The roasted   salted pepper on the side takes it over the top.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,164,I saw a review for T-Loc s in a Yelp email for National Hot Dog Month. I worked for a while in the Tucson area and was familiar with the Mexican style hot dogs T-Loc s is famous for. I just happened to be in the neighborhood so I stopped by to check  em out. Without any reservations  i have to say that Miguel and his partner have not only nailed it  but exceeded the flavor I held in my memory. They were so friendly and informative  talking about their struggles and successes and the love of what they re doing. I am absolutely rooting for team T-Loc    I went for the best  Their Sonora Dog Con Todo with a Lemonade Ginger Agua Fresca. Everything was exceptional. The bun is like no other and  while slightly crispy on the outside  literally melts in your mouth. I have no idea what kind of bread it is or the dough used  but it is almost like a sopapilla on the inside. They ship in the rolls because he can t find anyone to make it locally to his specifications. The layering of flavorful ingredients and sauces over a perfectly grilled bacon-wrapped hot dog still has my mouth watering. I advise getting it just the way they offer it - with everything - that s what sets it above the rest. I ll be back on a regular basis and  who knows  I might even try the rest of the menu offerings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,165,Perfection  The most unique hot dog I have ever had. The bread is brought in weekly and yummy. A perfect balance of flavors.  I m not much a a burrito fan normally but loved it  Very cute clean outdoor setting and prime location.  You can tell the pride and love that the owners chefs put into making the dining experience excellent. Can t wait to go back and sample more of the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,166,If you like hot dogs  there is no better place than This place  so unique and so delicious  You need to come.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,167,Hot dogs were great and very filling  My husband got the burrito with egg and loved it  was also a good size   Our girls got the asada fries and for picky eaters they also loved them.Great atmosphere as well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,168,First time here and this place was the bomb diggity       Had a hard time picking what to get only because everything seemed so good and couldn t decide. Decided to go with the carne asada fries and Sonoran Style Hot Dog. They had ran out the Mexican cream for fries but still decided to get without it and they were delicious. The Mexican cream is will be like an entry to heaven. Will definitely be coming back many more times  but with the intent of getting to hot dogs instead of one. Good find  great food
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,169,Let me just start off by saying I am a Tucson  T-Loc  native. This is the real thing. It does exist  fellow T Locs. Miguel  aka Mike  the owner  flies in the bolillo buns FROM TUCSON via fed ex. This is a big deal for anyone who doesn t understand how important the bolillo bun is to the Sonoran hot dog. If you haven t had a Sonoran hot dog yet let me make your mouth water...  You start off with a warm  toasty bolillo bun  has a hint of sweetness to it vs regular buns and is closed on the ends to hold all the goodies . Then you grill a hot dog with bacon ON A FLAT TOP GRILL. Yes people...on. A. Flat. Top. Grill. This is key and Miguel does this. You just have to go there to have him describe in sensual foodie detail the amazingness that is the glorious Sonoran hot dog.   BUT WAIT THERE S MORE     He makes the most legit carne Asada burritos and quesadillas too and they re freakin AWESOME. If I wasn t on a strict meal plan and only given one cheat meal a week I would be here every day. EVERY. DAY.   I haven t even mentioned the fact that the customer service here is way above and beyond. He and his lady Zulma  I think that s her name  are really friendly  and  amable . They recently took a quick drive to Tucson to buy supplies and he even asked if there was anything he could pick up for me. Whaaaaaat  I declined but today he gave me a small pack of some delicious tortillas. Amazing.   This place is also BYOB as of 2 2016 soooo bring some Modelo and lime and get ready to experience that which is Sonoran style food euphoria.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,170,T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs are amazing  It will change your life  Before trying their hot dogs  I didn t like anything if it wasn t a plane hot dog with ketchup and mayo  the end.. no more and no less . My hot dog tastes were extremely black and white. I surprised myself since it is unlike me but I love their sonoran hot dogs. Be open minded if you are a picky hot dog eater like me since it has a lot of ingredients  but all the different ingredients play together so well. To me it s not a hot dog  it is a flavor experience  And don t ignore the lightly grilled and salted pepper that comes with it  it greatly adds to the experience  I ve tried their other menu items as well and they are all delicious but the hot dog will always be my favorite because I can t get anything like it elsewhere.  Also  the owners are very friendly and always a treat to see  I am impressed that Miguel recognizes me every time I come by even after just 1 visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,171,Hotdogs and burritos  My... least expected combination of amazing food. It doesn t matter. It s 2015 and Miley Cyrus told me us we could do whatever we want.  The dude behind all this creation gave me to opportunity to eat the premium hotdog and the carne asada burrito. In exchange for some money.   Hot dogs  the regular is  5 and is not all beef. The premium is  6 and is all beef. Both hotdogs come with bacon. Yes  it sounds like a car wash but I assure you that it tastes much better. There are so many flavors in this hot dog that I wanted to get a second one before I was even done eating.   Burrito  the owner knows the real deal. No rice to fill you up with such nonsense. This burrito is just as flavorful and is out of the world.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,172,Being from Arizona and there being no carne asada out here  it was a little upsetting  until we found this food truck. Even though he is a U of lAme fan  his food was just perfect. The tortilla was fresh  my picky son LOVED his quesadilla  and the carne asada taco was perfectly cooked and seasoned   We will definitely be coming back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,173,I haven t tried anything else besides the con todo aka with everything hot dogs but they are  definitely the bomb    I have lived in El Paso Texas half my life and frequently when to Juarez to have a hot dog made this way and when I moved  to Austin I really didn t find a place that made them like home but this place is pretty close and now that I know it s here I ll be back for more. Definitely stop by and try this place great lil spot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,174,If your are from Southern California and have been on the hunt for San Diego mexican food then you found the right place for Carne asada burritos and fries  Super nice people and great carne asada.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,175,Short weekend trip from Houston and my cousin said I had to try out these hot dogs.  They have the best hot dogs ever.  Not too salty and the buns are amazing.  The toppings all come together well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,176,I Person I know took me overt there and I really like the hotdog even when I m not a fast food person .. I will recommend this place to all of you but the best part are the owner .. super friendly people and you can talk long enough with them .. and they are well know  travel
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,177,If I could give this review more than 5 Stars I would. The people that run this Food Truck are extremely friendly and accommodating and genuinely enjoy what they are doing and have a passion for the food that they provide.   I have never had a Hot Dog come close to what I had here and my one regret of moving to Houston was not being able to eat here as often as I d like. 110  Satisfaction with the Service and Food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,178,Mystified by all these 5 star reviews  which just goes to show that people in Austin will pay almost anything for a food item they are not familiar with. It s a hot dog with just more toppings than normal. Place uses the cheapest wieners  Bar-X  then charge you  6 bucks for the thing. Want to  upgrade  Hebrew National-style   7 is the entrance fee... still a single hotdog. Taste is OK but nothing compared to being in Tucson where one can pound these all the live long day for  2.75   pop   Flying in the buns daily from Tucson  Gimmick which sounds uber retarded  as Arizona water is even worse for breadstuffs than here in Texas. Maybe these dudes are  6 because the FedEx fees are wrapped into the amount   Inside crammed food truck court with crappy parking. Good luck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,179,I m not even sure how to write this review because all of the words i can think of to describe how good a Sonora Dog is  just seem to be completely and utterly inadequate. This hot dog stand is so  so  so  so AMAZING   I am totally in love with Sonora Hot Dogs   Highlights   -This is a food truck with a hot dog mission.  There aren t your average hot dogs  there are Sonora Dogs which means it it a bacon wrapped  grilled hot dog  on top of pinto beans  on a speciality made hot dog bun shipped in from Tucson  smothered in pico de gallo  onions  mayo  mustard  jalape o sauce  and served with a grilled chile on the side.  And in a word  it is DELICIOUS   -For non-hot dog people  there are also fantastic carne asada burritos and quesadillas.  I can t speak for the burrito  but the carne asada quesadilla was super tasty in its cheesy goodness  You can also order just a plain quesadilla as well.  -So  you re a vegetarian  You are in luck  They also have vegan hot dogs with veganaise.    -Mexican sodas and aqua frescos are also available to complete your meal here.  yummy   If you haven t tried Sonora Hot Dogs yet  get over here ASAP and stuff your lovely face   On a side note  they do offer Hebrew National hot dogs as the upgraded hot dog option.  This is a superior hot dog for all intents and purposes and I love them. However  as the upgraded option  it includes the hot dog to be wrapped in bacon.  This is amazing for me on all levels  but can be disappointing to others.   Why you ask   Well  we had some kosher people in our group.  I had told them that they also served Hebrew National hot dogs  so they could get some dogs too.  I hadn t been before  so i didn t know about the bacon.  I guess all of the kosher Hebrew National hot dogs are wrapped in bacon as part of the prep process.  So we had a couple people who couldn t try the dogs for kosher reasons.  I would suggest maybe keep a couple kosher dogs kosher.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,180,Excellent hot dogs  super friendly service. These things are expertly crafted and you can tell they take pride in their work. Haven t seen another Sonoran dog anywhere else in town  so I was excited about this place. Should have more umbrellas as eating in the sun isn t great and I m too much of a mess to eat these in the car.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,181,Tucson flair   Fly in their hot dog buns from Tucson  and their hotdogs are fabulous.  Their Ranch Fries are to die for   Thanks for making Austin your home and sharing all your greatness with us 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,182,I wish hot dogs were good for you  because I would like to eat most if not all of my meals at this place. Just WOW 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,183,I m from Tucson AZ. I love living in Austin but get homesick for the Mexican food I know and love and let me tell you  the first time I ate at T-Locs I had happy tears in my eyes. Sonoran hot dogs  caramelos  carne asada fries  and burritos are all so delicious and authentic to the area. Can t say enough about it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,184,This place was amaze balls. My husband has been craving a hot dog and the Sonora hot dogs hit the spot   We also had the carne asada fries that were beyond our expectations  Definitely coming back and trying other items on the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,185,The burrito is even better    How is this possible    My friend ate a Con Todo  bacon wrapped hot dog w  fixings and beans  while we were there and was so enamored she ordered another to-go. Shhh    You know who you are...  If you haven t tried this food truck across from Allendale HEB  go ASAP. You won t be disappointed.  And don t forget- those aguas frescas are not only refreshing  but they also make a perfect base for your favorite pool beverage 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,186,We ordered a little bit of everything the service was amazing and so was the food u guys are doing an amazing job    Sincerely    The Craft burger food truck couple 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,187,The best example of what a food truck should be  friendly and fast service  short menu with a focus on perfecting a few items  and the occasional long line proving how good the food is.   Do you know what makes a  Sonoran-style hot dog Sonoran  I didn t until I visited for my first time. Like everyone else has said  the bacon-wrapped dog with fresh  southwestern  toppings is stand-out  but it s not the reason I ll be returning again and again.   I ll be returning again and again for   the carne asada burrito and the quesadilla. Both are at the top of their class in terms of quality of ingredients and attention to construction. Yes  that s right  a burrito has to be constructed in just the right way as to ensure a series of  perfect bites  and to guarantee  as much as you can  preventing the dreaded  explosion --non-bite end of burrito opening up  causing the filing to escape. This burrito is one where you ll want to chew slowly as to savor  as much as you possibly can  the tenderness of the beef  the freshness of the avocado  and the genuine perfection resulting from an ideal combination of ingredients.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,188,No one is happier than me finding this place  I used to eat Sonoran dogs in Phoenix and hadn t had one in about 5 years until yesterday  I was looking on yelp for lunch and this popped up. I headed over and found the owner and his wife in the food truck. They were awesome to chat with  I excitedly told them about my previous experience with these types of hotdogs and turns out they came out here from Arizona just to do this type of food  Man  am I happy  I work close by and told them I d be seeing them often  The food was delicious and an even better rendition of the Sonoran dogs I had in Phoenix. Order it just the way they suggest it. You won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,189,Miguel was amazing     Everything was delicious     The flavors melt in your mouth  I am so happy that we found this place  Am I coming back  Yes I will           
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,190,I went here the other day and my god you can get a large fajita like thing for only a few dollars from here burning hot from the oven whenever you get there. Also their hot dogs are to die for and must be tried at least once from any casual austinite. They re so good and the ppl at the counter are extremely nice. Today I went there and the lady said I didn t need to tip them. Like for real  Nobody ever denies a tip. But I can at least tip them with this well deserved review. Give them a try if you re in the area.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,191,I finally got to try the famous hot dog after months of trying to make it there when they re open and I have to say I was not disappointed  it was definitely an interesting mix but would for sure go back again for another. Left me completely satisfied and full
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,192,This guys does it RIGHT    Yes the hot dog  Sonora  was really good. Cooked just rights  super soft bun with good ingredients and time taken to prepare. But what REALLY had me going was the  carne asada burrito  This thing ROCKS  just beef  Avocado and cheese. No rice  no beans or filler of any kind.   He even came out to talk to us about how he prepares and it was obvious he takes pride in what he s doing. I will be back for my burrito fix for sure and the sauces were home made as well. The red one does have some bite but not as much as I expected based on reviews.  Pros  Cool location  umbrellas  nice breeze. Good food and great people running it.  Cons  I shouldn t be eating a hot dog AND a burrito in one sitting but after trying my partners burrito  I HAD to  Dammit that means extra time on the treadmill this week. Worth it.   Tucson Locals - you got my vote  T-Loc s .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,193,Gosh damn. The best hot dog I ve ever had in my life. The fluffy bun. The perfectly cooked premium hot dog. All the perfectly portioned and distributed toppings. GOSH DAMN. Absolutely worth the  6.50. The roasted pepper is delicious too  Goes great with the hot dog.  Service was great too  it s pretty cold outside  so you can wait in the car and he ll bring your order to you  He s also a pretty nice dude   I d definitely come back for more  5 5.  Update  Just tried the Carne Asada burrito  very good  but the hot dog is definitely where it s at. Only complaint would be that it s smaller than what you d think for the price.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,194,One of the best hot dogs I have ever had  made to order and always hot and fresh  Fresh ingredients and great customer service. Not to mention they are located and a very cool relaxed location.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,195,I used to think mission dogs was pretty good but then found out about this awesome trailer   The couple that run this stand are out of this world personable and the food does not disappoint  The hot dog buns are shipped from an AZ bakery   The crema and beans with a charred pepper are unique and delicious.  Their cheese taco is also killer with some pickled onion.  I ve tried their Tortas too and only Dos Batos can compare.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,196,Great food and great people.  the sonoran hotdog and carne asada plate is my favorite. Will definitely come back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,197,The Facebook photos were enough to make me take on rush hour traffic for a hotdog. Totally worth the 1.5 hours it took to go 5 miles.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,198,Usually when I think hot dog I think disappointing and not very good. What they did with hot dog is on a whole other level this place is awesome. And my girlfriend found the taco she couldn t find anywhere else in Austin that she loves
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,199,The best hotdogs and quesadillas in Austin  no joke. The tacos are something else  also. It s all good and the couple that own the place are awesome. Eat here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,200,Super friendly services  the boss explained me throughly on some of the top sellers.  Items selected  hot dog all the way  without beans   steak burrito. It s about average  nothing stood out for a  5 hot dog. The bread was different  but the hot dog tasted like  3 a dozen pack from Walmart.  Steak burrito was very filling. Lots of steak  it was good for two people.   The place is a bit hidden  it s behind the buildings in a food trucks court. Plenty of parkings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,201,It s awesome  The best hot hogs in the whole state  I come every time I m in town from Houston  And of course the customer service is the best  And love the Atmosphere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,202,Awe finally  Coming from Arizona  I missed those Sonoran hot dogs. They are just simple hotdogs loaded with lots of goodies like beans  bacon  and the sauces lol...but they taste great  I used to love going to those guys pushing the little carts and ordering these hotdogs in AZ.  Well  we finally have one in Austin. I was actually searching for one last December but there weren t any. These guys just moved here about six months ago from Tucson AZ. So these are the real thing...  So  for all you AZ and Southwest transplants...we have Sonoran hotdogs...I just had my first two...lol   Thanks for listening...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,203,Oh man  the time that it took me to eat this passed by way too quickly   I kid you not as I was driving away it felt like a dream that never really happened.  I had to stop myself from turning around to get another one just to prove that it happened   I was a little worried about parking as with any food trailer park but  I easily found I spot in their tiny parking lot.  The food park is quaint and fenced in with 3 large picnic tables.  I walked up to the window and the nice lady  owner  explained to me how they do the hot dogs and I ordered it the way they do it and purchased a pineapple water  2.00  the flavor of the week    I opted to pay  6.00 for a Hebrew National hot dog as opposed to the  5.00 one.  They also have other menu items so it isn t just hot dogs   I am going to try to remember all the toppings here   hot dog wrapped in bacon  tomatoes  onions  beans  mayo  mustard  jalapeno sauce....darn I think I am missing one or two   I sat down and waited for my food and thoroughly enjoyed that pineapple water  so much that I probably could have drank a liter by myself.  The fruit was freshly squeezed and you could tell they made it themselves.  Also  enjoyed that they gave you a glass filled to the brim with ice which was nice and refreshing   The man  other owner  brought me out my hot dog and of course I took the obligatory picture   The flavors were so  good  this is the part where I start dreaming  I couldn t help but  take bite after bite.  I was done in a matter of 2 minutes and I could probably win some hot dog eating contest if these were involved.  The toppings were nice and diced and everything was well balanced in the way of flavor   Nothing was too overpowering  sweet  spicy and the beans really gave it something extra   I am normally not someone who lets people put tomatoes or mayo on a hot dog but  you won t be disappointed if you get it the way it comes   I also enjoyed the grilled pepper that it came with but  beware it is hot   The bun was also great and I loved the way it hugged the hot dog and the toppings the whole way through.  This way you don t end up with a mess all over you   I am glad this place is right around the corner from where I live but  that also makes me want to cry because I will keep eating it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,204,Wow is all I can say  Best hot dog I have ever had in my life. Seriously. Chef is an amazing guy. Really cares about what he serves. What a surprise. Come and have your taste buds blown away 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,205,I got to go back here again   The sonora hot dog was something special. Super unique and tasted amazing. The carne asada burrito...was so so good. I need to go back for this specific menu item.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,206,If you want to eat something that s gonna change your life you ve come to the right place. Order the hot dog con todo with an order of ranch fries  You can never go wrong with T Locs. The owners are super friendly and the food is so delicious you ll definitely be coming back for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,207,Fantastic hot dogs    I brought my husband here after seeing decent reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed. This place is a food truck  nestled just off Burnett next to two other food trucks. The owner is an awesomely nice guy who we talked with briefly while placing our orders. My husband got two premium dogs  and I got a regular dog sans the jalapeno sauce.  Honestly  I didn t think I d like everything on the dogs but I really wanted the authentic experience so I went with the flow  and I m glad that I did. All of the ingredients were very fresh and it all tasted great  even together. Kudos - we ll be back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,208,After a day of errand-running  my husband and I stopped by to pick-up a quick dinner. I had originally dismissed the trailer  parked across Burnet from the Allandale HEB  because it looked more like a slick state fair truck than the purveyor of deliciousness and hospitality that it is. Fortunately  I had noticed some Yelp love and made a mental note to check it out.  We munched our way through the premium hot dog  con todo   i.e.  beans  jalapeno sauce  mustard  mayo  diced tomato  and caramelized onions   oohing over the steamed bun  I know some find it soggy  but I loved it  and ahhing over the bacon-wrapped dog with all of the fixings. We also tried the carne asada burrito  which was equally flavorful  filled with nicely seasoned meat and mashed avocado  served with red and green salsas to your liking. You really can t go wrong with either savory pick  but I recommend going with a friend who likes sharing food so that you can sample both.  The service is so friendly. You just have to love a couple who made their dream a reality and somehow manages to work in very close quarters with smiles on their faces. I also appreciate Miguel s pride in his food - he made sure to show us our  to go  hot dog before bagging it so we could see how perfectly dressed it was in case it got mucked up on the drive home. Sonora s excellence really is in the details.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,209,I m in a great mood today. Let me share with you how I really think. I ll keep this short   I pretty much see food for its nutritional value  and no matter how beautifully crafted  seasoned  or presented it is  at the end of the day it s in one hole and out the other. Consume too many empty calories and you get fat. Sorry  we can t defy the laws of physics.  So when you re reading my Yelp reviews  and I m blathering how some place is so wonderful or whatever  keep in mind it s less about the food and more about the experience  Am I feeling welcomed  Am I having a great time  Do I enjoy being here  And if you text me with  Let s go there tomorrow  would I respond   Cya there   If you know me in real life  you know I m usually pretty easy.  So here s what I really think about Sonora Hot Dogs  It s a couple working a trailer living their dream. There is absolutely nothing I admire more than people who are so passionate and excited about what they re doing you can actually feel it. Do I really care about a hot dog or burrito  No. Would I go out of my way to come here for a hot dog or burrito  You bet. It s one small step for me  but one giant leap in my World of Mankind. Anything is as good as you want it to be. Everyone should be living their dream. An easy five stars from me.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,210,We really liked this place when we went for the first time on Wednesday afternoon before dropping off one of our moms at that airport  she wanted to go to a food truck for her last meal in Austin  so we took her to this park by our house and she picked the place .  We had never heard of T-Loc s before  but it must be some big thing in Tucson. We got two hot dogs  one Hebrew National and one veg  and all shared the buttermilk ranch fries. The buns were better than the typical cardboard stuff you get  they re allegedly FedExed in  and there was a good amount of toppings. The fries were seriously delicious--and they give you a massive amount. The moms enjoyed her torta.  Service was friendly and quick  and prices seemed on point with what you got. Overall  a big hit with the family and we d be happy to recommend it and go back again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,211,What makes a place five stars   It s not rocket science.  Generally  if I can t wait to tell the wife about it  crave it days later and need to return  and can t think of anything I would change there...  The embarrassing reality   When my wife wanted to stop at a clothing sale on Burnet last Saturday  just south of 2222 Koenig  I was initially sad that I couldn t find a parking spot  so I dropped her off at the door.  Then I made  lemon aguas frescas  out of those lemons by determining that I could get to Sonora Hot Dogs  and slam down a delightful dog before the wife even noticed I was gone     And folks say I lack vision...  Michael and his lovely wife   I wish I was better with names   who own the T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dog trailer  came to Austin via Tucson  AZ  near the Mexico border state of Sonora.  Hermosillo  Sonora  is where the sublime goodness of the bacon-wrapped dog was invented.  To keep things as authentic as possible  they even source their bread from Tucson.  And when he describes his hunt for just the right jalapeno  a white jalape o   his passion shows.  And you can t find more friendly service.    Every bite of the hot dog  with it s mayo and mustardy  jalape o-sauced  onion and tomatoey goodness  is eye-rollingly good.  And don t forget the beans which give it a unique edge as well.  When I described my poor gluten-free wife s inability to enjoy a hot dog in a bun  or a burrito in a flour tortilla  he said to  just bring her by .  On a cloud-cooled evening  we decided it would be a good time for a little roadside dining.  Even though I d only met him once almost two weeks before  as soon as we walked up Michael said he d be more than happy to throw together a couple not-exactly-on-the-menu tacos from the also very yummy burrito ingredients  paired with some corn tortillas he just happened to have handy.    Great food Cheap prices Local and friendly ownership Thirst-quenching aguas frescas and horchata Easy parking  What more could I ask for   Ok  maybe air conditioning.      4.998 stars.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,212,Just like they do it in Tucson but right here in Austin. Quality ingredients  quality people  quality food. So solid 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,213,Best Sonora dogs in Texas hands down. The bread is brought over from Mexico  and let me tell you it really makes this place stand out from any run of the mill hot dog spot. A Sonora starts at 6 bucks with the fixings and definitely a bang for your buck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,214,Carne asada taco  chuco taco  and Sonoran style hot dog are all phe-nom-enal    If you want authentic style Mexican look no further. This is as good as it gets y all. I will dream of this taco until I have it again. Remember the carne asada taco won the 2019 Austin National Taco Championship 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,215,Excellent tacos  The carne asada tacos were on point  The chuco tacos were amazing  Get off of your butt and go try this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,216,Got the fish tacos which is currently a special please please make them permanent  I m not going to lie I ve lived a good chunk of my life in California which is fish taco land and so I went in super skeptical but they were delicious   Also love the little side garnish of pickled veggies it made me feel like I was back in San Diego  The people who run the truck are super sweet and clearly care a lot about their food and their customers I will definitely be coming back to try to the whole menu. Also helped my friend devour his carne asada fries which were so good it was hard to be polite and only eat a few.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,217,I first had my first taste of a Sonoran Hotdog in Tucson  when I lived in AZ.  One bite and there s no going back. And no other hotdog will ever come close.  Street food at its finest and legend has it that it originated in Sonora in the 80 s. You could only find them in Tucson and in some areas of Southern Arizona...that is until now.... We stumbled upon T Locs when we were driving around in Austin  Texas.  I almost fainted when I spotted the sign.  This little food truck is LEGIT.  They have their Bolillo bread Fedexed everyday from Tucson for their particular  dog .   Yes  they also have tasty burritos and tortas but why would you not order their famous Sonoran Hotdog   I live for them   I dream of them   I obsess about them   I count them in my sleep   And Mike the owner remembered me from 2 years ago.  Yes  I was that crazy lunatic woman that inhaled 3 in one sitting all the while moaning like Andrew Zimmern after each bite.  Now about that GLORIOUS hot dog   Nope  not just any ole hotdog but one wrapped in succulent crispy bacon.  Oh yeah   Piled high with pinto beans  tomatoes  green salsa  jalape o  mustard  mayonnaise  avocado and cotija cheese on top.  TRUST ME   Try one.  You ll think you ve died and gone to heaven   I thought I did.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,218,Finally got the chance to get to this place. These hot dogs are amazing. Sonoran style and you have to try the ranch fries  amazing. I was really impressed. We ll be back for sure.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,219,At first I didn t want to try the Mexican hotdog but then Miguel told me just to try it  The hotdog was so good the combination of the toasted bun the beans the bacon it was the best hotdog I ve ever had I ve definitely go back
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,220,Miguel  Zulma and Mom are amazing. I ve been having these hotdogs for a few years now  never gets and never disappoint. Amazing people serving amazing food. Not only are they super kind but they remember who you are. Love them and will continue to come every Saturday.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,221,This food truck is absolutely amazing in every way possible.   From the moment I stepped up to place my order  I was greeted with a friendly  smiling face. The menu is simple  hot dogs  burritos  and quesadillas.On my first visit  last week   I ordered the carne asada burrito which included delicious and perfectly cooked beef  avocado  and pico de gallo. It came with a lime half  as well as salsa roja and salsa verde  both of which were fresh and tasty. The couple that own the business were extremely outgoing and friendly  asking me how I heard of them and explaining to me that they packed up and moved from Tuscon  AZ to start this new adventure here in Austin. They were genuinely pleased and grateful that I came to try their food.   After I ordered food  I saw that they offered aguas frescas  which I has never tried but knew my coworker loved  so I ordered one to bring to my friend. They have different flavors every week  and that week it was watermelon. As soon as she tasted it  she told me how incredible and authentic it was and insisted I try it. IT WAS HEAVENLY..crisp  sweet watermelon flavor with fresh sliced mint leaves. I could have kicked myself for not ordering one for myself  but swore I would get one next time.   Fast forward to to today  when I returned for yet another carne asada burrito  I swear I ll try the hot dog and quesadilla soon  . The burrito was delightful and satisfying as usual  and was enough to completely fill me up. I was surprised that the owners remembered me from my visit a week ago. I was greeted with a friendly   Hi  welcome back  What will you be trying today   I ordered the burrito because  dammit  I was craving it  The aguas frescas flavor of the week was mango  and even though I LOVE mango  I said I d pass and get it again when they had watermelon. They were so incredibly nice that they gave me a sample cup  very decent size  of the mango to try it anyway. It was delectable and I would certainly order it again.   They were thankful for my return visit and shining with delight that I has enjoyed their food so much. I couldn t find anything bad to say about the owners or the food if I tried. I m so glad I found this place  will certainly recommend it to everyone I know  and plan to return again with regularity. Thanks Sonora  Y all are great  and welcome to Texas 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,222,Amazing food. You got to get the premium dog and the cheese fries. Best fries I ve ever had in my life.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,223,The hot dogs are great. I had to have a second one. But the burrito is awesome. Tons of carne asada  great homemade tortillas  pico  and guacamole. Served with half a lime and salsa roja or verde. Just the right amount of heat.  This Mexican girl is happy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,224,Incredible place. Incredible Food. Incredible Owners. It s no accident this place is so highly rated.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,225,If you re already on here just stop reading and go.   Get the hot dog  con todo . You won t regret it. They ship their buns tortillas from Tucson - where the Sonora hot dogs originate. This is a serious stuff  guys.   Oh and their limonada compliments it perfectly.   Enjoy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,226,Legit AZ style carne asada. No frills  carne asada with smashed avocado and pico in a delicious tortilla. They get their tortillas and hot dog buns from Tucson  This place was worthy of taking the 5 minutes to write a review. You want good  legit  traditional AZ carne asada in ATX  this is the only place you can find it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,227,I really love this place  my favorite hot dog ever.  My wife always love the chiles g eros toreados that come with the food. Mike and his wife are super friendly. We will always come back to this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,228,A must go to destination in Austin.  Food is so amazing.  Gourmet dishes from a small little food truck.  The folks here truly put love into each dish they prepare.  If you can only choose one food truck to go to in Austin I highly recommend this one.  This establishment has been approved by the BIG KAHUNA.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,229,Finally passed by and noticed they were open  it appears this is week five of their opening. Super nice couple who are offering Austin the only actual Sonoran hot dog. I think there have been a few tries but never the real deal until now.  They offer a regular  premium and veggie dogs. Also a couple of burritos. So I ve tried the hot dog with everything. A Sonoran dog is wrapped in bacon  topped with beans  grilled onions  fresh onions  tomatoes  mayonnaise  cream sauce  mustard and jalapeno sauce with a roasted pepper. Mmm......bacon   The carne asada burrito with avocado was also just as good. I ll have to rotate what I get in the future. I was given a small tasting of an aqua fresca which they also have. She said melon  I was thinking specifically cantaloupe.    As of Tuesday  May 13th the new hours will be Tue-Sat 11a-10p. Closed Sunday and Mondays. This will make it easier to get a fix.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,230,Fantastic food and folks  My wife and I come here whenever we re in this part of town. The food is fresh and delicious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,231,I m going to be honest  my boyfriend and I were hesitant at first about trying this place out. We had the passbook and we were wondering if hot dogs were really going to fill us up  we re also not huge fans of what is usually considered mystery meat . We went to their website and saw their video  it convinced us to try it. We were so glad we did.  Their hot dogs rise above the stigma. They look beautiful  are packed with toppings  and are totally scrumptious. The special bread they use only elevates it s delciousness. We were impressed. Also the owners were so nice  You could tell they are passionate about what they do. They ship the bread from Arizona  but they plan to go there and learn how to make it themselves. They were also shocked about their high ratings online  They deserve it. Great Service. Great Food.  We got cups of their freshly made pineapple fresca. Oh my gosh  I wish I could have it everyday. We also ordered a burrito. It was packed with deliciously seasoned juicy meat. It s safe to say I love this food truck. I hope it sticks around for a while.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,232,The truck was a little difficult to find but it s worth it once you do. I had the Sonora hot dog and my partner had the Carne Asada and that was good as well. Very well seasoned. I would advise anyone to at least try it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,233,My wife and I were doing some shopping in the area and decided we were hungry. She looked on Yelp and said   there s a hotdog place close to hear that s supposed to be good.  I m not one to typically jump at the opportunity for a hotdog  but I like to try new things so I agreed. We went to Sonora hot dogs at an off time in the afternoon  so it wasn t busy at all. We were greeted by the friendly owner  can t remember his name . He chatted with us for a while as he prepared our food. We split the Sonora hot dog and the Carne Asada burrito. I was blown away by the hot dog. Every ingredient is extremely high quality which resulted in a perfect blend of flavor. The bun was the best bun I ve ever tasted  which sets up the flavor for the entire hotdog.  We ve gone back a second time and our looking forward to our next return. Give Sonora Hot Dogs a try and you ll be back for many more visits 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,234,My wife and I are from Phoenix so we know what a good Sonoran Hotdog is supposed to taste like and T-Loc s dogs are even better. Definitely the real deal. The owner and his wife are wonderful people and always the best hosts.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,235,I went for the the hotdog. It is awesome  wonderful flavor without being overwhelming  as much as I like Chicago style dogs  they can be a bit much . Served on a soft gourmet bun and with a perfectly grilled spicy pepper  If you are there for the hotdog  that is what it is  just one style of hotdog. If you are looking for a variety of toppings and styles  this wouldn t be the place. But that one dog  it is wonderful.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,236,This place has the best hotdogs you ll ever eat and the carne asada fries are really good as well. The guy who cooks the food is really nice and you can tell he cares about the food he serves just by tasting it. If in Austin you should really go try them out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,237,This place is amazing  Had the Con Todo and it was the best hot dog I ve ever eaten  The Ranch Fries were also great. Go to this trailer now 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,238,This place is fantastic  I am a vegan and Miguel was super accommodating. They were out of the veggie hot dogs and he instead made us a bean burrito and two vegan cheese tacos  which would have been much more expensive than one hot dog. He even took extra time to create a cute presentation on our plates. The food was amazing and came out very quickly. Miguel is incredibly kind and is very attentive and fun to chat with  This food trailer deserves to be much more famous. I highly recommend you check it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,239,This place wins on so many counts.  I had never heard of a  Mexican  hot dog and had no idea what to expect.  Also the idea of another food truck in Austin trying to do some fusion always makes me kind of skeptical.  This place really met my expectations all around and even surpassed them.   I had the premium dog  which taste wise was amazing.  I have never had such a unique and tasty hot dog.  But apart from the food which I think all can agree on here is really fantastic the service was great and very friendly.    I will most certainly be returning and I think this place might become a regular spot for me 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,240,Lived in Tucson for a little bit and this style dog is the number one thing I missed. This gem is tucked off burnet road close to 49th. If you miss the turn in...turn around. It s worth it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,241,Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Hot dogs are my favorite food. Born and raised in Chicago- which has hotdog stands on every corner. And this place was great. The owner was a sweetheart- great service and very friendly. The tacos and loaded fries were also amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,242,Hidden Gem  Small menu because they do what they do so well. Don t ever change  Owner is a great guy too 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,243,This is my place to go for Sonoran style hotdogs. Plus they do a mean carne asada burrito and fries  I definitely recommend them. You won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,244,Miguel knows how to throw down a hot dog and a carne asada burrito.  My hubs and nephew got the carne asada burrito and both stated they were excellent. Flavorful  meat was tender  avacado was delicious. Lots of meat. Tortilla was amazing.   My Sonoran Hot Dog I had to  try the  5 vs  6. Both tasted great with a delicious heavenly bun  beans  mustard  mayo  jalopeno sauce with tomatoes and onions. Both dogs were wrapped in bacon. But I think the hebrew national took the gold. It had a better flavor despite having the same dressings. I would go with the hebrew national.  My watermelon mint agua fresca was great.   I only wish for 2 things. The beans on the hot dog were delicious and I wish they were offered in a smaller item than a bean and cheese burrito. The second a fresh side to go with the hot dog. I wasn t quite full with 1  but the 2nd one was too heavy.   I will go back and tackle the other items. Miguel informative and our customer service was awesome 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,245,Lives up to the hype   The customer service blew me away.  Also  the wind did  as well.  I m not really a hot dog guy  to be honest.  That being said  I ordered a premium Sonora Dog and it was the best hot dog I ve had in years.  Now  the burrito was the real star  for me.  I love burritos with all of my being.  So. Good.  The salsas and concoctions that came with the burrito were also a special treat.  They re across the street from my apartment and I ll definitely be back.  I cannot stress how well the staff treats the customers.  They deserve 6 5 stars for the treatment we received.    Hot dog lovers  Do it up   Burrito connoisseurs  consume mass quantities 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,246,I ordered the hot dog with everything.  Very good.  The people running the trailer were very friendly and helpful.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,247,Now this is my kinda place  A food truck with hot dogs and burritos. Yes please  The hog dog was absolutely delicious nothing that I have ever had before every component was spot on. The burrito was very simple but less is more and in this case it definitely was. Not only was the food great but the service was awesome  The guy who owns this place was very welcoming and took great care of us. We will be going back for sure. If you haven t checked this place out yet your missing out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,248,Reminds me of Tucson.  The owner chef is a great guy. The price for a Sonoran Dog might seem high to the uninitiated... but if you ve had a Sonoran Dog before  it s completely worth it. On my second time back  I also picked up a carne asada burrito- closest thing to a burrito I d get in Tucson  Chipotle Freebirds falls more into the Subway category for me .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,249,There are two top hot dogs in town and Sonora is one of them.  Hot dogs n stuff by Lowes on Shoal Creek is the other.  But let s get to the point here.  I ve been several times  and ...  Gilberto from Houston - you re an idiot.    You bust out one star because the price is a buck too much for you   Stay in Houston  please.  We don t need more A  holes in Austin.  Did you actually taste the dog   Did you know the buns are fed exed in from AZ   Did you actually chat up the awesome owners to find out what they had to offer you salsa wise   obviously not.  moron.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,250,An absolute must. The hot dogs are perfect every time. However the Carne Asada Burrito is best in the City. The whole menu is a safe bet. I don t know about the veggie dog as im a true Texan.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,251,Downright amazing. If you enjoy great food and a taste that s too die for   you owe it to yourself to visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,252,Just had my first Sonoran Hot Dog this evening. It was one of the best hot dogs I ve ever eaten. The taste combination of the dog along with the roasted pepper was superb. This trailer might be hard to see from the road because it is set back from the road  but it is directly across from the Sonic Drive In.   Miguel was manning the trailer this evening. He s a pretty cool guy to hang out with too and talk motorcycles with.  Having a choice between Sonic and Sonora Dogs  I will always go to Sonora from now on.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,253,One of my favorite places to stop after work   Great food  fast friendly service  great food.... Yeah  get the Deluxe Dog all the way   Perfect    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,254,I highly recommend getting the veggie hot dog wrapped in bacon. It s like you re being healthy but with a little something extra. You haven t lived until you ve at least one of their hot dogs. And the carne asada burrito was really good. The meat was nicely charred and the tortilla was huge  So worth the  .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,255,Didn t disappoint. Hotdog is flavorful and the bread is incredible. Going in you think it s going to be a heavy dog but you ll want to get two  Owner is really nice and friendly. He explained everything really well and even gave up extra roasted jalape os to kick it up a notch. Highly recommend you try this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,256,One more five star review for Miguel. This hot dog cart is no joke   I got the Kosher dog wrapped in bacon...because Kosher. You don t really notice the bacon after it has cooked down except in the flavor of the dog.   I also got a burrito which was really good as well. There is homemade guacamole in there and the house salsas are really good too.   Each order comes with a Santa Fe pepper that has been appropriately seasoned and grilled. It s a great touch for a  simple  hot dog stand.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,257,Sonora Hot Dogs is the perfect embodiment of everything I love about local businesses. The husband and wife team who own this trailer are absolutely lovely and the passion they have for making good food really shows. There are no subpar hot dogs here as every hot dog served is carefully crafted with the utmost attention.   I got a premium dog because I am a sucker for Hebrew National dogs and got everything on it. Try the Sonoran style at least once - it might sound like too much  but everything just works. They cut the bun in such a way that stuff is not dripping out of either end while you eat - I LOVE this. Truly brilliant and I wish every hot dog bun came cut that way. The grilled pepper they give you on the side  So tasty. The cucumber aguas frescas was super refreshing and downright delicious.   I could spend my money absolutely anywhere  but it feels nice to know that I spent it somewhere local  helping to support a small business with kind  hard-working owners. There s just something I really love about supporting good people in achieving their dreams. Feels good  man.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,258,I ve been eating these dogs for a long time.  They are as good as I ve ever had. The ingredients are well thought out and the roasted pepper is purfect on the side. Can t wait until July 28th  National Hot Dog Day.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,259,I love that this place has veggie hot dogs and other vegetarian options  The customer service is excellent. We had their veggie hot dogs  ranch fries without the bacon and because it was our first time the owners made us their vegetarian taco to try and it was delicious  We will definitely be back for some more yummy food 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,260,I had the Sonoran dog and it was excellent. I asked him to give me their most traditional Sonoran dog and it did not disappoint. My buddy had the torta and it was fantastic as well.  Good spot to try on a nice day. The owner was very cool and chatted with us about the history and food in general. Very knowledgeable and nice guy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,261,Great loses up hot dog  great taco  very fresh ingredients  great service. I highly recommend this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,262,I LOVE THIS PLACE      The food is AMAZING  super delicious always fresh  fast  and the service is fantastic too. The owner  Miguel is awesome. He is a fantastic host. There s always good music and a nice ambiance. I recommend this place from the bottom of my heart
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,263,Be forewarned   two prime dogs  made with Hebrew National Franks  and two Topo Chicos commanded  17 . Yeah. For two hot dogs. Hmmm... this seems quite steep after growing up with the always delicious James Coney Island in Houston. Still....  they are delicious hot dogs. I ordered the  Con Todo.  Not sure what the beans add to it... the rest made a wonderful goopy mess  but the real star was the bun  which seems to be more grilled or toasted than merely steamed. I would like another hot dog right now  but next time I need a fork to scoop everything that fell off.  Friendly service  pleasant shady place to sit. A few flies  but at least no mosquitoes.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,264,Classic  authentic Mexican hot dogs. Staple food truck to expand your Mexican palette.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,265,First time here. Driving from McAllen back to Dallas. Nice people  good food  awesome pineapple Agua Fresca. Could not ask for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,266,This was literally one of THE BEST hotdogs I ve ever had    I had two of the Sonorans with all the magic. The glorious bacon wrapped hotdog  beans and the tomato  onions and hints of salt just to name a few... and all on a bun that is so perfect it defies description    I ordered two and thought I might have gone too deep... but a handful of minutes later and they were both gone without a trace. Light and delicious  I could have had 4 more. To top it off super cool people who run it and a real cool vibe  this spot just made my regular list
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,267,Delicious hot dog  I had the Hebrew National  wrapped in bacon  with the beans  and salsa. The bun was toasty and good all on its own. We came here with the Austin Passbook and we ll definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,268,Amazing hotdog  fantastic burrito made by the best lady i have ever met. Thank you for a great service  We will definitely come back for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,269,BEST HOTDOG EVER    BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE    COOKED WITH LOVE      We arrived just 25 mins before closing ... And not only did he not turn us away  he made us the best hot dog in Austin  and you can totally tell it was made with love to perfection. Anyone that is jammin to music while cooking is good wit us      Thank you     
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,270,The bun has to be the best part of their hot dog. Definitely the bacon wrapped around the weiner is a Sonora touch with the toppings  but the beans are such a Tucson  AZ thing  Overall  I d come back here con mis amigo de Mexico. Also  the staff here are so charismatic and they speak Spanish
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,271,Just finished one of their carne asada burritos and the kids had a couple of the hot dogs and we couldn t be happier. Delicious and slightly spicy they made us all very happy campers.  I also wanted to note that my battery died while sitting in the lot and the owner graciously gave me a jump and sent me on my way.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,272,If you have been to Guero Canelos in Tucson.....well you can get the same taste right here in Austin  Texas.    Definitely must check out and enjoy their Sonoran hotdogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,273,I visited T-Loc s Sonoran Style Hot Dogs last night as part of Austin s Truck and Trailer food festival Truck By TruckWest. Their signature entry into the competition was a simply phenomenal hot dog wrapped in bacon and served in the softest  most awesome bolillo-type roll I may have ever tasted. Topped with pinto beans  diced tomatoes and onions  mustard  a squiggle of mayonnaise. It may not sound amazing when I describe it like that but let me tell you  it is fan-F CKING-tastic    I mean it. This is hands-down the best hot dog I have had in years  bar-none.  It was served to us by the super-cool proprietor  Mike Kaiser  who graduated from Le Cordon Bleu and who used to work at Thomas Keller s renowned Per Se restaurant. He was way nice. Laid Back. Eager to talk about his beloved creation and all around an exemplary host. I learned from him that  T-Loc  stands for  Tucson Local. Which I thought was some pretty awesome representin  of his home set. And that those awesome rolls are FedExed in from Arizona daily  Seriously  Along with the special tortillas he uses in his burritos. This place is a must visit if you have EVER liked hot dogs. You gotta go get some. This is best new thing in hot dogs you can get 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,274,I think my friends like me a whole lot more after introducing them to Sonora Hot Dogs.  We pulled up right after open- it was easy enough to find and there was ample parking. As I inspected the menu board I overheard a patron exclaim   Man  that was awesome  You made a believer out of me   Oooh  good sign   I ordered a veggie dog con todo sans onions along with a bean and cheese burrito. Was I that hungry  No  but I had to try it all. The orders did take a while to arrive  but I m pretty sure it was the owner working by his lonesome. When the food did come  it was well worth it.  As I ve seen other reviewers remark  the extreme toppings stay in the bun perfectly somehow.. it defies nature  Although the plethora of ingredients seem overwhelming  the mustard  mayo  tomatoes  beans  and jalapeno sauce compliment the dog so  so well. The bun was PERFECTLY soft and chewy and every bite was perfect- even the ones outside of the realm of the regular sized hot dog. The pepper on the side was roasted and dusted with salt  the perfect spiciness that when shredded on the hot dog  really enhanced the flavor.  The burrito was okay. standard beans and cheese in a tortilla  but the tortilla was AWESOME. You don t find tortillas like this in Austin  This dish could be greatly improved with just an addition of salsa  I was given a side of the hod dog s jalapeno sauce  but it was much too watery for the burrito .  At the end of the meal there were many exclamations-  Good call Katie   and  OH GOD  that bun was good   They were right. Other sausage establishments may cater to meat craftsmanship or wow factor  but Sonora doesn t need that- they ve got the right flavor and they re letting it roll.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,275,OMG     Everyone NEEDS to eat here     You are missing out if you haven t had their food yet. My favorites are the Sonora Hotdogs and the Carne Asada Fries  The owner is awesome    Really makes the visit more enjoyable  Really a must stop if you re looking for the best food in town
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,276,I will drive from Leander for these   I ve had Sonoran hot dogs in Tucson and these are the real thing  Get you one 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,277,Do you like hot dogs  I hope so because why else would you come here  These hot dogs taste bombastic.   You can also get a quesadilla or even a premium hot dog that uses Hebrew national dogs instead of the bars type. And yeah they come topped with a lot of stuff so tackling even one hot dog will be a task.  They make hot dogs more yummy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,278,I grew up in Tucson on Sonoran Dogs  but somehow Miguel uses such better ingredients that you can totally taste the difference  which is why his are better than any I ve ever had in Tucson or Mexico  even Guero Canello and street vendors.   He s also expanded his menu to include ranch fries  think Eegee s but with real bacon  and AZ CA carne asada and breakfast burritos. I seriously missed breakfast burritos until t-locs came around  no offense Austin breakfast tacos  I love you too  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,279,This place is a must-go-to.  I love their quesadillas.  Best ever   The tortilla they use is very tasty and they aren t stingy with the meat.  The overall taste is really terrific.  I think the quality of cheese they use is part of the greatness.    The owners are really fantastic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,280,Trailblazing the frontiers of the Sonoran style in Austin. Truly pushing the envelope on what is possible.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,281,This may come as a surprise to some  but wienies are not on my regular diet.    I don t have kids and I don t eat fast food much so hot dogs and burgers are easily avoided to save my waistline.  However  this place keeps  starring   on my Yelp feed and it s in BFF s  hood  so we decided to try it.    Have I mentioned that BFF has a  touch  of OCD   So  he of course read each review and had a plan going in.  He was gonna get one Sonoran dog and one carne asada burrito.  I only wanted to eat one of those so I opted for the dog since I so rarely get to eat those.    We found the  tiny  trailer easy enough but only because it s a trailer.  There s no big sign saying what it is but it s in a parking lot with the Conscious Cravings trailer and some picnic tables so it s easy to spot.  We both knew we wanted the fresh agua fresca and the flavor that day was cucumber.  That was so good and refreshing and had me pining for some vodka to spike it  or  as suggested by the sweet cook  some Hendricks Gin .    The wait for food was not too long but just enough to know it was made fresh and to empty our cucumber waters.  I had some cash out to buy another glass when they said the first refill was on the house.  THANKS      Back at BFF s apt  we could not wait to dig in.  I will admit that  while I thought the hot dog was really good  I was blown away by the burrito.  And if you like heat  the grilled pepper that comes with the dog can be shredded and added to it for a nice kick  and the red sauce with the burrito will hurt so good  but I preferred the tangy green  tomatillo   sauce.  My only complaint with this trailer is I wish they would offer sides.  One dog was not enough  but two would have been too much  so I opted to get a couscous salad from CC next door.  And  I ll just reiterate  I wish Sonora would offer sides.  I choked down a few bites of that just to make me feel healthy and crunchy but blech.  So Sonora  even just a bag of chips would be sufficient.  Or  maybe a bowl of your beans  I did ask for a side of beans and they misunderstood and put my dog beans in a tiny cup on the side .    I have no doubt I ll be back  with a flask  for more of that agua fresca and a burrito.  I ll just pretend the guacamole in the burrito is my healthy helping of greens.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,282,What a taste treat   I enjoyed my first Sonora hot dog today and it was soooo good  the only problem was I ate it too fast   I got the premium Hebrew National dog with everything except mayo and it was very  very  very good.  I took a carne asada burrito home for later  but only half of it made it to my refrigerator.  The drink was a blend of orange juice  blended strawberries and a little sugar and it was perfect.  Very friendly service from the family run business.  Highly recommended 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,283,I was super skeptical the very first time I came here and a friend said....do you trust me  Oh my God it was absolutely amazing the best hot dog I ve ever had the burrito was to die for. So let me start by by saying not only do I not like beans which comes in the Sonoran con Todo but I don t like pico de gallo  which comes on the burrito. I have now referred at least 50 people to this place because it is that amazing I love his Sonoran hot dog and I love his burrito and his fresh pico de gallo and his roasted peppers are amazing
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,284,While I like variety  I also like places that have only a few items on their menu and do them well.  I got their premium hotdog which consisted of jalapeno sauce  mayo  mustard  onions  cooked or raw  I went with cooked   tomatoes  hebrew national dog wrapped in bacon  they have a veg dog option too  with pinto beans served on a perfect lightly toasted bun. After my first bite couple of bites I said   that s a damn good hot dog.  and it is. It looked like a work of art too. I was still hungry afterwards and while I really wanted another hot dog  I figured I d try their carne asada burrito too and it was pretty darn good in it s own right and they do not skimp out on the steak. They also gave me a little taste of their mango agua fresca which was very refreshing on a hot Austin day.  In addition to the hot dog  the stars of the show with out a doubt are Miguel and Zulma who make sure you feel welcomed  happy and full. They are the best   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,285,I see a lot of love in the reviews for the carne asada which I was not super impressed with but when a place has hot dog in the name  I only need them to do one dish well. This will easily be the best hot dog you ve ever eaten. Lots of places  elevate  hot dogs by serving sausages instead of hot dogs  looking at you Frank  and that s the easy way out. A sonora style hot dog takes ordinary hot dogs and turns them into art  or at least that s what they re doing in this truck. I ve never been to Sonora.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,286,Dang. Great hot dog. I hope these guys do well and stay around for a long time. Go for the signature Sonoran Dog  con todo . It was great. I wish I had gotten 2 cause now I m thinking about it all day    I added an aqua fresca  watermelon juice  that was a perfect compliment to the meal.    Really nice folks running the place too. I can t wait to return.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,287,My wife and I decided to give this place a try for lunch today.  The verdict   They re really tasty   Wrapping the hot dog in bacon adds some welcome chewiness and crunchiness to the texture  the condiments fit together well  and the bun has just a hint of sweetness.  It s definitely an awesome  unique  and valid approach to a hot dog  and I m glad I got to try it.  The pineapple water my wife got to drink was really good as well  lightly sweetened and with a touch of coconut.  So what s keeping me from giving it five stars   Value for money  mostly.  The Sonora dog with a Bar S hot dog is  5  but I suspect most people are going to pay the extra  1 to upgrade to a Hebrew National hot dog.  Based on the photos here  I was expecting the hot dogs to be a little bigger  maybe the size of a 1 4 pound dinner frank.  However  these are regular size hot dogs -- they don t cover the full length of the bun -- and if you re really hungry  one probably won t be enough.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,288,T-Loc hot dog all the way   -  Fantastic food  Great prices  very good service  Miguel made it feel more like a backyard cookout
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,289,I thought I hit up the Burrito and Quesadilla from this place being that I hadn t had solid Carne Asada in awhile. As soon as I unwrapped the Quesadilla and took a bite with some of the Guac I literally put it back in the box sat back and said  Oh hell yes  . Something so simple as a tortilla with cheese had so much flavor it was astounding. The guac  pico and salsa were on point and the burrito was a tremendous balance of ingredients. The quantity is spot on to because I had trouble finishing just my burrito but the food was so good I ended up eating the whole Quesadilla afterwards because I just couldn t wait  D.  The guy behind the counter  IDK if he was the owner  was very relaxed and easy going and there s a nice area to sit and chow down with umbrella s over the tables for shade. I can t recommend it enough and I haven t even tried the Hot Dog s yet  which looks just as spectacular . Great place 5 stars and I ll be going again .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,290,Awesome burrito. I had the Eggsplosion with cheese  and it was fantastic. Carne Asada  retried beans  some spice to it  and eggs that break while you re eating it. A great big  beautiful mess. Last week I had the loaded fries  which were also awesome. The guy who cooks it all up  T-Loc himself  maybe   is super friendly. I will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,291,Best Sonoran dogs in Austin. Are used to live in Tucson so I m very familiar with these and these are the best I ve ever had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,292,The best of the best   I m not a big fun of hotdogs but I will admit am addicted to hotdogs after today   the bun is yummy and taste is sweet spicy it s amazing   The guy that serves the fun  Miguel   I think he sure knows about a good customer service    Awesome guy   Great vibe and the music made me feel like home  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,293,If you like hot dogs  definitely come here and try that. A hot dog with onions  tomatoes  jalapeno sauce  beans I don t like beans actually but it fits to that hot dog   bacon and beef frankfurter. It is expensive for a hot dog  6.50  but worths it  Best of Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,294,Best hotdog I have every had in my life. Cool place to eat nice environment great place to have a nice lunch. Really recommend trying it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,295,Miguel and crew make a spot on Sonoran Hot Dog that would compete with the standards from our former home Tucson. The twist is he offers premium beef and vegetarian option for you fufu Austinites.  My only complaint would be I think the price point is high. Specifically for the Bar S dog    5. Then again  he sources the bun from AZ so the costs probably represent that.  Represent Miguel 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,296,Just finished scarfing down my Sonora dog and carne asda burrito... it was great   It was my first time getting food from there  and was extremely pleased to put it mildly.  It s a small little food trailer with a dining yard and 3 picnic tables.  I got a Sonora Hot Dog  which has a  bacon wrapped wiener  you can choose the type of wiener you want Bar S or Hebrew  with onions  mayo mustard  chopped tomatoes  grilled onions  jalapeno sauce  and beans.  This dog was out of sight.  I thought is was one of the absolute best hot dogs I ve ever had.  The presentation of it was pretty too.  The mayo and mustard are squeezed on  in a nice zig-zag-type way  instead of spread.  The roasted chile on the side is a great contrast to the hot dog s flavor.  After eating that  I could have been satisfied hunger wise... I went moderately hungry.    Of course  I also ordered the carne asda burrito b c when i go somewhere new  i order eat way too much b c I m afraid I may never make it back.  The burrito consists of a 1 2 pound of chopped steak w  mash avocado and fresh pico.  It was was equally pleasing in a totally different way.  My meat was very tender.  It came w  green and red sauce on the side.   The couple working were very welcoming and friendly.  I was offered a free sampling of the daily flavored water  today was hibiscus  I believe  I didn t clearly hear what flavor it was.  I will go back for sure.  You should go  NOW 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,297,As a Tucson native  these hot dogs are famous and not sold anywhere else. However  I have found them here in Austin. If you have not tried them  you MUST DO SO ASAP. They re absolutely delicious and t-locs does them perfectly. With amazing Tucson favorite foods served here  it s seriously not to be missed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,298,My girlfriend and I are regulars here for a reason they have the best hot dogs and carne asadas. Miguel the owner is a great dude and excellent chief same with his significant other. Highly recommend people try their food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,299,Any bad review has obviously never had an authentic Sonora hotdog. This place is amazing. I wish I could eat here for every meal. The burritos are to die for. The bread used in the hot dogs is all the way from Tucson  and there s a reason for it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,300,What is a Sonora hot dog  I don t know but it was ah-mazing  Ok really it s this delicious style of hot dog that s popular in Arizona. I ve never had anything like it in Texas. They ship the bread in from AZ to keep it authentic. Light fluffy  slightly sweet bread  loaded with saucy beans and topped with a hot dog grilled in bacon then covered in mayo  mustard  ketchup  and diced tomatoes onions. I think there was something slight spicy too  maybe. Party of flavors in your mouth. I got hints of that classic childhood dish  frank and beans  but with a little zing. Topped mine off with a Mexican coke for  7. Mmm-hmm. Open till 10pm 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,301,I ve sampled everything on the menu now and I regret only that I can t rate them even higher. The Sonora hot dog that gives this place its name has a wonderful balance of ingredients that come together perfectly. Don t skip the grilled pepper - it s got just enough salt sprinkled on it to bring out the flavor delightfully  And yes  it s noticeably better with the Hebrew National hot dog  although still tasty with the Bar-S dog. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla are full of just-right beef and fantastic guacamole with no cheap but flavorless filler. The bean and cheese burrito is tasty  very filling  and somehow manages not to fall apart when you eat it. The cheese quesadilla is yummy and a perfect vehicle for allowing their flat out spectacular pico de gallo to shine. And the watermelon agua fresca I had with my order tonight was absolutely amazing - I can t imagine a better drink.  Wonderful food made with care. A glowing example of how truly magnificent a few humble items can be when prepared with the best ingredients and attention to detail.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,302,BEST HOTDOGS EVER. I was looking for a place that did a good street dog for a long time and AT LAST T-Loc s or Tuscan Locals is hands down the best hotdog around. This place is kinda hidden in a little food truck lot. Do yourself a favor and Visit Miguel for a hotdog  I had the  Con todo  premium dog. I would have taken a picture if I didn t inhale the hotdog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,303,If you haven t been here  please just go.  The food was delicious.  They know what they are good at and do it with excellence.  Service  cleanliness  quality  fun.  They don t currently offer sides simply because this is a traditional  Mexican  style street food vendor which don t serve sides  just delectable main dishes and refreshing drinks. Even the simple bean  amp  cheese burrito on homemade buttery  thin  amp  flaky tortillas is de-lish   But keep coming back  they ll add specials each season and you might even find a creative side dish  soup or Mexican Hot Chocolate for cooler months show up.  Zulema  amp  Michael are the perfect hosts and welcome you warmly to their casita.  Thanks you two for making a lovely date night with my prince so fun  - Richard  amp  Cobi  PS  Make sure you grab your wristbands for Truck by Truckwest and come check out Sonora Hot Dogs from Tuscon  AZ.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,304,I went here to eat try one of their hot dogs on a warm Saturday night and I was NOT disappointed. It was to die for   Nuf said. If you haven t gone here  please do yourself a favor and try it out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,305,This trailer is great   The owner operating couple really love their food and it shows.   They serve best hot dog in Austin.   The bun is a wonderfully light  slightly sweet bread - not your standard bready hot dog bun.  You get your choice of dog including Veggie dogs.  The condiments range from the usual to tasty beans  onions  and  best of all  a roasted  amp  steamed blond pepper.  A perfect combination of ingredients which are seriously addictive. They have other options such as burritos and quesadillas but we cannot get past their veggie dogs   Also  their homemade aguas frescas are some of the best we have had.  They change weekly  this week was horchata and tamarindo - next week peach .  The aguas frescas alone will make us visit this trailer each week.  The couple that runs this trailer take the time to introduce themselves  discuss their food and its origin with previews of what is coming next week.   They remember what your preferences all while greeting you like old friends. They make a stop at this trailer truly extraordinary.   Very much worth a stop  you will be hooked - we are 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,306,Very very good    I tried the carne asada on a burrito and tacos  and it was very good  Have to return to taste the famous burrito... can t wait 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,307,Excellent  very very good    The hotdogs and the burros are awesome and authentic  Try the  aguas frescas    Im from Sonora   Mexican state  and this are the real deal  the bread is very good and the tortillas too  the food is delicious...everything is very clean  the service is awesome. Si tienen ganas de pasar un rato agradabe y comer muy rico no dejen de ir  los due os son muy amables  todo esta limpisimo y la comida los har  volver  Exito  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,308,This has quickly become my favorite trailer in Austin.  Miguel and his wife are great hosts who put customer service first.  Living in Tucson  I ve come to miss sonora dogs.  T-loc s satisfied my need to go back for a visit. The aqua fresca is amazing.  The Carne asada maybe the best burrito in Austin. The dogs are just like walking out of Guero Canelo in Tucson. Get to this trailer.  You won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,309,Wow  This little trailer really packs in the flavor. Hubby got  the best hot dog of his life.  Special bun with a bacon wrapped grilled hot dog topped with special mayo on a bed of beans and pico - add a grilled jalape o and you have a winner. I had the asada burrito and it was delicioso  The steak was grilled to perfection paired with guacamole on a fantastic tortilla. To be honest I didn t want to stop eating but I could not finish it- it is huge.  You won t be disappointed or hungry either.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,310,The guy manning the truck was super-friendly.  Truck was new  amp  super-clean.  I got the plain dog  no bacon   but with everything else.  It was good.  The onions were nicely grilled  amp  the dog was served with a very mid grilled pepper.  The bun was soft  too soft in my opinion as it made for rather a soggy dog with the beans.  Free sample of the Pineapple Horchata agua fresca was muy deliciouso - I could not stop gulping it.  I wanted to love this place  but like is the best I can give it.  Paid  5 for a dog  amp  I m still hungry.  Think I ll have to go back to my old reliable  chili-cheese dog next time I m craving a hot dog fix.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,311,The food here is great because the owners believe wholeheartedly in their product. Great ingredients  attention to detail and they love their customers. And not just because we are paying  they really like our southern open arms  y all  .   Their menu is well thought out. They have quesidillas for the kids and veggie dogs for those that don t  ya know  eat the meat. The salsa s good and pinto beans done to my liking. This is after-all the make or break of any joint selling Mexican cuisine.  And while I liked the Sonora Dog my shout-out goes to the carne asada burrito. That with the red sauce reminded me of my favorite southern californian joint  Juanitas.   Glad they moved to my hood. Try it  or just go buy and say howdy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,312,Yo  That hibiscus aqua fresca is no joke. I want forty of them.   This is my new favorite food truck. It s quick  it s damn good. The hot dog was great  and the burrito is a hidden gem. It s the perfect balance of carne asada steak  some guac and pico de gallo. The owner operators are a great addition to Austin -- super friendly and putting out great food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,313,OMG Yes   For anyone who s lived in Tucson  or Sonora  this is a must when in Austin. I was a bit skeptical when reading they ship their bread in from Arizona  but upon trying it I was convinced. They don t make bolillos like that in Texas. The people who own it are super friendly too. Bear Down 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,314,This ain t no fast food dog  it s more of a culinary work of art. The bacon wrapped dog and toasted bun are excellent  and all of the other ingredients work perfectly. Nice clean food court off Burnet Road  easy parking  fast service  nice tables. It s a winner 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,315,meh.  I tried a Sonora dog  everything on it as recommended and thought it was decent. I d had plenty of worse hot dogs  but quite a few better ones as well. It s nice to have an option in Austin to get a Sonora-style dog but I ve had some this same style in Seattle that I thought were better. Worth trying if you re nearby and curious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,316,The food was fine. But  I feel like they should drop the  s  at the end  because it s misleading. They have exactly one hot dog. They have the same number of quesadillas and burritos - exactly one.  The guys were super nice. Their food is good. Still...  Our favorite hot dog joint went down about two months ago  and there s nothing like them anymore. We found Sonora while looking to fill that  hotdog partaking void   seeking the options of Sriracha  fried egg  chili  jalape os  sour kraut  bacon  or something like that.  There  you can have a Sonora  or a plain hotdog. So  a bacon wrapped dog with beans  amp  cilantro  or without  so  plain . Or  you can have a quesadilla or a burrito.  I can t say I won t go back  I very well may. But  I wish I d known what to expect before I drove there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,317,Delicious   Not your average hot dog.  The bread and the mix of flavorings make this the best hot dog I ve ever had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,318,I am from a city in Baja California that is an hour away from Sonora where they have this kind of hotdog everywhere. So when I found this place I thought it was too good to be true but this is as close as it gets to the real Sonora hot dogs and they taste amazing  The owner told me he brings the bread from Sonora  and I gotta tell you this bread is legit  The only downside is they re kinda expensive  like  6 for a hotdog con todo. I am biased though cause back home you get a hotdog WITH fries with all the toppings for  30 pesos  1.50 USD  lol. But everything in Austin is expensive so I probably will come back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,319,Wow. Loved the sonora hotdog. The bun was light and crispy and the sausage had the right amount of saltiness and flavor. I really enjoyed the sauces they put on.  It looks like one man operation and the wait can be long  but i would say it is worth the wait. I wanna go back and try again soon.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,320,My new favorite hot dog  my boyfriend and I eat here weekly. The owner is so personable and obviously loves his job. These dogs taste like straight up happy. The buns are delish and the carne asada burrito don t play it will punch your appetite in the face  it s Good  amp  hearty
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,321, Much too good for children    Matilda - Ms. Trunchbull   That is how I feel each time I devour these hot-dogs  because I want them all  All to myself  They re SO frickin  tasty    I am all-things hot-dogs. Hot-dogs from Man Bites Dog  Chris  Little Chicago  R.I.P   Dog Almighty  Evil Wiener  El Salchichon  LOL - that cracks me up every time   Sonic  meh...   7-11  I know - why would I  right   - you name it  I ve have it. Seriously. There s no kind of sausage that hasn t been in my mouth. I ve had them all.  LOL    Once  a friend from Arizona  who moved to Austin  prepared a few of these for me and I got the sense of what they were  but - unfortunately for him - I was not heavily impressed and didn t understand the hype. It because there was something missing  is what he said. It was the bread. There is a special kind of bread which is ordered specifically for these hot-dogs  I was told by the owner  which means it s not available in Austin. IT IS  ALL  ABOUT THE BREAD.   Oh - and to keep you going back - they change up the fresh water with new flavors weekly. Yesterday  I got a sample cup  4 oz.  of melon juice...oh  my gosh  I loved it. You remember that scene from  Ace Ventura  When Nature Calls  when Jim Carrey walks into the room where all the body-less animal heads are mounted on the wall  and the camera is going around and around as he makes all those creepy and funny faces - with the loud mouthing he makes as he cringes and screams  THAT was how I reacted...in public. Ha   OK  so you better go try one. Or two. Or three. I m having three for dinner today.   - A member of the Wachati Tribe
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,322,Had my first Sonora Hot Dog and fell in love. It was fantastic. My only complaint is that the menu could use some smaller side dishes so that I don t completely wreck myself with an order of carne asada or ranch fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,323,These are some damn good dogs. The guy that runs the joint is super nice and the food  while it may sound a little weird  is so damn good.  That s all I have to say. Go eat here  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,324,Awesome dog. The flavors come together very well. I also grabbed a steak taco which was excellent.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,325,This place is great. My wife and I have been twice now  and it doesn t disappoint. The Carne asada tacos are amazing and so is the Sonora dog. We are from California and missing GOOD Mexican food  and now we have found it. Sorry  but we are not fans of Tex Mex. This place is is a must.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,326,T-Loc s is now serving breakfast and I may have found a replacement for a breakfast taco in the eggsplosion burrito. Carne Assada  received beans  pico and an over easy egg in that fabulous tortilla is now my go to breakfast. The new location on Burnett is super cute and has plenty of parking and a nice new playscape for the kids. There are a few other dining spots but why do you care when T-Loc s is right there 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,327,My wife and I found out about some Tucson Locals who decided to open up a Sonoran style hot dog stand out here in Austin.  Being someone who enjoys a good dog on a regular basis  I decided to check them out. Absolutely amazing  so much so that I had to get a second dog just to enjoy that taste again. The guy who runs the store does a great job with customer service.  I plan on going back when he opens up for lunch with a few guys from work.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,328,best Sonora dogos i have tried outside Sonora. worth the drive from home
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,329,Coming from AZ this place hits home. Sonoran hot dogs are a favorite of mine and this places does it right. If you have never had one of these fabulous dogs YOU MUST try this great place out   I will definitely be a repeat customer   This is a great addition to the Austin food scene.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,330,I had lunch here the other day and I dig it. Where else can you get a quality dog and a burrito at the same time  Well  I do miss my old hot dog stands in Chicago  but this will do for me  Still very unique and creative dogs to say the least  -Ed
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,331,Finally got to try this place  Two dogs is more than enough food for a large hungry guy. Get the dogs fully loaded  So much flavor packed into a handheld meal. Can t wait to come back. Didn t get the name of the lady behind the counter  but she was super nice and explained the food to us 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,332,The best hot dog place in town. The Sonora dog all the way is the only way to go. A mouth full of awesomeness in every bite. I don t get to make it down in this area too much but when I do it s on my list to eat at. There s several other things on the menu that look really good as well but I always go with the Sonora dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,333,Delish   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a   if this place was closer to my house I would probably be here daily.   Carne asada is fresh and the hot dogs are soooooooooooo amazing...... best dogs in town.  I challenge anyone to these amazing hot dogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,334,Wow the are awesome  the food and the people. I will always be looking forward to coming back again and again. The sonora hot dogs here are even better than the place I went to in Chandler  AZ. The owners are the friendliest people and superior customer service.  If you don t go here at least once  well you will have missed the best experience ever.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,335,DELICIOSO   I LOVE food trucks and wish that the world would hop onto the craze like this city but ohh well.  I was looking for a semi quick bite to eat while letting a friend nap at the hotel before we headed out  for SXSW  but still wanted something unique to the area.  Happy that me and the rest of my crew stopped here because it was AMAZING. Literally finger licking good  The owner is a really cool guy who makes sure you feel comfortable and I love the outdoor seating.   It s in a little parking lot with some other food trucks so that s cool too. Only reason it isn t 5 stars is because seeing that it s a food truck  not all the food handling is as wished  perfecto but it s still safe to eat  not dirty or anything. Just don t like how some stuff is kept warm   Happy eating   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,336,The Sonora-style hot dog is what the trailer is named after but the carne asada burrito is not to be missed. This is NOT the type of burrito bomb you d find at Chipotle. Here  it s a very thin tortilla wrapped around tender marinated steak  pico de gallo and avocado  and served with both red and green sauce and lime. The hot dog is awesome but the carne asada burrito steals the show. And don t miss the agua fresca. Just delicious 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,337,Went there today for the first time not knowing what to expect. Boy was I up for a nice treat  These hot dogs are something else. The presentation  amazing and when I took my first bite  I was blown away. They serve it with a freshly roasted chile of some sort and it was  hands down  the best hot dog I have...ever had  I got to talk to the owner  Mike  and he is super nice  took his time explaining everything about those hot dogs. Incredible.  Highly recommended and will be going back for sure.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,338,Exclusive 5 for the carne asada burrito. I was nervous about  smashed avocado  with  chopped steak  by itself. Every solid burrito I know has some essence of bean and rice. The cook modified my order for a fusion Sonora burrito and it was AMAZING. Lime on my burrito is not a new concept  but it s fresh and revived here at Sonora Hot Dogs. I was too distracted by satiation that I didn t even bother to savor the hot dog. I m not a fan of skinny dogs anyway. The burrito was much worth every delicious penny. Double the hot sauce next time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,339,I almost cried when they moved locations. But  Here they are and I m ecstatic  Are you from California  do you love carne asada burritos  I do. And here they are. In all their delicious  Robertos glory  No beans  rice  queso  nacho cheese  gravy  sour cream. It s just meat  lots of meat. Guacamole and pico. It s the best  8 I spend. Are you hungry yet 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,340,The carne asada burrito was BADASS    The green sauce is pretty amazing as well. I will definitely be coming back many many times in the near future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,341,Delicious best hot dogs iv had so far love it can never go wrong with the sonoran hotdog
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,342,Met the owner  very nice guy who chatted us up for a long time. It s cool to see a restaurant where the owners work so hard and are humble people. The food was fantastic and authentic. I ll definitely be back
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,343,This is our absolute go to spot. I love the food here. The service is great. The vegan vegetarian options are really good. Always go  con todo  on the dogs. It s the best. We are regulars and come weekly. Be sure to pickup a loyalty card. Try this place  you won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,344,Owner is Hella friendly and funny.  My dude loved their hot dog so much he had to have two.  That s alot of weiners for one man...  I think the bread is what makes it so special.  It s really toasted and chewy u just gotta try it to know what I m talking about.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,345,The pepper on the side is weird but i hate cooked peppers..hotdog itself is good...nothin special
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,346,Never thought I d be able to have a good Sonoran hotdog in Texas until I saw the name followed by a U of A sticker. Absolutely loved the Sonoran con todo. We also got hot chocolate from here  and it was better than any other I have tried. Great customer service as well as quick turnaround times. Highly recommend 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,347,This place totally sated my hot dog craving this afternoon. And that bun  Nice picnic tables with umbrellas. Will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,348,HOT DOG  This place is legit. It s been on my list for awhile and Mark M. has had nothing but rave reviews for this place. Mark  my husband and I were on Burnet hitting up happy hour. I was getting irritated because Mark and I were 2 for 2 on some pretty terrible interactions with service staff at two places we hit up. We were hungry so we decided to go to Sonora Hot Dogs. They have moved from their location on Burnet and now in front of this beautiful house which by the way is a place where people play Magic the Gathering a few times a week. No offense but that s so weird to me. Beautiful house but what a waste of space.   We pulled into the lot and my husband hopped out of the car quickly and asked if there was restroom we could use. Miguel was super friendly and let us in to the house. So now down to business. We walked up to the window and we were ready to order. Miguel had recognized Mark M from yelp and from his visits previous. Miguel is the epitome of hospitality and service. Hubby and I ordered a premium dog and a carne asada burrito. I was so happy that he had topo chico and gave us limes for it too. There s plenty of seating when the Magic the Gathering geeks aren t there. I imagine that when they re in session there s only a few picnic tables that are in front of the trailer. We were enjoying the nice weather and Hubby had walked over to the near by gas station to get some brews. He bought some Tecate and Miguel gave us limes for that too  Shortly our food was coming out piping hot. I didn t get a chance to taste the hot dog because hubby demolished it but he enjoyed it very much. Come on a bacon wrapped hot dog that s constructed in such a way that makes every bite perfect and even with all the toppings. My carne asada burrito was THA BOMB  Little beef morsels so tender and perfect with avocado. Every bite so perfect. I wanted to take the carne asada and throw it on top of french fries for carne asada fries but that s a totally different story  Everything is made to order with so much love  care and precision. Gotta appreciate a place that really takes the time and care in what they re doing.   I was so happy to finally come here and meet Miguel. Definitely need to come back and try the hot dog since it disappeared before more eyes. Come see Miguel  chat him up  taste his food and give him some Yelp love 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,349,This place was found by complete serendipity. I came specifically for another unnamed island food truck as I noticed their ratings. I arrived early to beat the lines. 10 minutes after the stated opening time  the proprietor arrived and said it would be awhile. New opening time 90 minutes later posted. I digress. I ve never had a Sonora style hot dog  I was already in my lunch hour and decided to try. A bacon wrapped hotdog with assorted other delicious additives in a toasted bun  Hell yes. Bacon and hotdog cooked perfectly and blended well with the toppings. And I thought I was a ketchup hotdog guy. Sonora style hotdogs are now my new go to. Every time. Friendly owners add to an already great experience. One day I will again try for the aforementioned and unnamed island food truck. That day was not today.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,350,Very good hot dog   I got the regular  con todo  .  It comes with a toasted bun  bacon wrapped hot dog  beans tomatoes  onions   pickles  ketchup   mustard and mayo.  Very fresh and good. Price was  5.  Check it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,351,Everything is awesome  The hot dog is the best everything else is second.owner is truley kind and awesome. Im totally coming back can even byob 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,352,My husband and I come here on the regular...these hotdogs are to die for  We ve introduced them to our friends and they ve become regulars too. Burritos and tacos are also fantastic. Both the veggie dog and veggie taco options are top pics of mine. The chef and mastermind behind T-Locs is actually highly trained in the culinary arts so you can bet this won t be just your average food truck. Seriously  you won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,353,My only regret is that I have worked less than a mile away for 2 years and just had a sonora dog today  Out of this world delicious  I will be going back again and again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,354,Excellent  We loved the bread  the toppings  and the service. Such a great little spot  and we ll definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,355,Amazing hot dogs and an awesome guy making them     The bread is amazing and they offer really good hot dogs   The quesadilla was pretty damn good too. It doesn t hurt that the owner is super cool and down to earth. I hope these guys to far   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,356,Always good when I need my fix.  Owner is a cool dude and the hot dogs always hit the spot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,357,had the carne asada burrito which I noticed everyone is raving about.  flavors good  tortilla and guacamole excellent.  Meat was nearly inedible.  few things will detract more from a meal than having to spit out large  tough gristly pieces after almost every bite.  knew I should have just stuck with a hot dog.  oh  and I m really beginning to fervently dislike these credit card swiping machines which pressure you into tipping someone for handing you one small 9 dollar burrito and a napkin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,358,At first I was skeptical about a blazing five-star review for this tiny little food truck  but I decided to give it a try and from the very first sip of their agua fresca  I was already blown away. I had a pineapple one and it was amazing - just sweet enough and bursting with fresh pineapple flavor. The attention to detail makes this place special. Think I will be a regular for the foreseeable future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,359,Miguel is awesome. These are the best hot dogs in Austin. If you like hot dogs  look no further. I used to work for Oscar Meyer and Nathan s  trust me I know my hot dogs. I was a taste tester for hot dogs for 19 years. If you want a hot dog that will make you cream your pants and scream daddy  this is where it ends.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,360,Best hot dog ever   I m not kidding. I have had a lot of hotdogs through the years and this one is exceptional. The bun is perfectly cooked and it is a great design. It is uncut on both ends to keep all of the goodness in. They say they have a great burrito which I will try on the next visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,361,I love this place  The staff is so nice and friendly  One of them even gifted me a water bottle trying to cure the spicy green pepper  Great food. Great people. Great atmosphere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,362,Such a delicious mouth watering beautiful brown grilled bun served with everything you need. Devoured mine in less than 2 minutes. I got everything but the mustard and jalape o sauce. I ve got to say Im impressed. Being that I am from Dallas  always searching for the best hot dog can often leave me disappointed. This time I was not. This is a great spot anytime. Service was amazing  everything was so neat. The playground was definitely a plus. My daughter was able to play on her own at a safe distance and we were able to enjoy our masterpiece.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,363,Just like home   We were so happy to discover this place after missing food from Tucson   Everything was amazing  520 style   Not to mention the owners were so welcoming and accommodating to celebrating my birthday with them.  We will be back time and time again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,364,The carne asada was utterly delightful  it was like a major flavor fiesta was happening in my mouth. Miguel was very friendly and attentive. This is hands down  my favorite food truck in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,365,This place is AMAZING  I had left my purse there and drove all the way home before I realized it. At least an hour.  I returned and they had my purse with everything inside. I tried to tip them and they refused.  The service is amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,366,Great Frank s with all the fixings. Great upbeat attitude matching the flavorful goodies  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,367,This is legit the best hotdog I have ever eaten  remember to upgrade to the premium meat  haven t had the other one  but the Sonoran hotdogs are one of my top four favorite foods in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,368,So delicious   Tried the hot dogs at Trucklandia today  they immediately accommodated our gluten-free dietary needs and served us a  taco  dog. Best customer service at Trucklandia  and one of the most authentic Mexican food experiences I ve had in Austin so far. Completely recommend.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,369,The hotdogs were out of this world    The bread was amazing  they use really fresh vegetables  I totally recommend this place  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,370,The carne asada burrito is just as legit as the dogs...you can t go wrong with either choice.  Heavily suggest the Premium dog.  They re tucked away from street view  so look for the signs and banners.  Definitely going to swing by here for breakfast to see if it s as good as the carne asada burrito 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,371,This hot dog definitely hit the spot. Friendly staff  nice shaded seating.  I had the regular sonoran hot dog. Next time  I ll try the premium.  Also looking forward to trying the carne asasda.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,372,Can t believe I waited so long to try these guys. Not just because the owner is from Tucson  I m a Wildcat myself   but because it was THAT good. I had the Carne Asada Burrito  and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. The steak was tender and it s one of the best tortillas I ve had in Austin. The two salsas were really good  too.  The red salsa reminded me of the chile we use to make tamales  so it was like eating at home. If you ve seen them and are on the fence about stopping  just go   You won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,373,Normally  I go there for the excellent bacon wrapped hot dogs known as Sonora Hot Dogs. Today I branched out and got the carne asada burrito. BEST DECISION of the day and maybe month. Following the sage advice of pouring a bit of salsa and a squirt of lime on each bite alternating the salsas  I had one of the best meals of the month. Quick friendly service and great food are worth every penny. The short wait for such great food prompted me to write my first review of this place after nearly 3 years of going to the various locations this trailer has been parked.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,374,The perfect hot dog  If you re familiar with Sonoran style hot dogs you ll know this place knows what they re doing. The grilled pepper on the side adds to the awesome flavor of the hot dog. Will be back a millon times 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,375,Still have yet to try their hot dogs but the carne asada burrito I got was simply amazing. It reminded me of the burritos back home in Cali  well seasoned carne asada  pico de gallo  and mashed avocado packed into a fresh delicious tortilla. The red hot sauce it came with was spicy and complimented the whole thing perfectly. Not a fan of green sauce in general but it was still pretty good. The guy working the window was very friendly and the food came out lightning quick considering it was all cooked to order. I ll definitely be back to try their famous Sonoran hot dogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,376,Best food truck in Austin. Hands down. Hot dogs are out of this world. Owners are super duper chill and the story is just so awesome. Cant recommend enough.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,377,Super friendly service and awesome hotdog  Coworker  got the carne asada burrito and said it was also on point. Bonus the seating area is clean and relaxing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,378,By far the most delicious hot dog in town. The burritos are amazing. Breakfast is amazing. Ugh it s so good
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,379,A little bit of Tucson in the middle of Tex-Mex country. It was what I always grew up calling  Mexican food. 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,380,I rarely give 5 star ratings but this place was SO AMAZING   These guys nail a hot dog.  I m a bit of a hot dog conniseur with high expectations and these guys delivered.  Lets start with the bun...the most critical component to a great hot dog.  These guys fly them in fresh every day from a bakery in Tucscon that specializes in hot dog buns.  The toppings were fresh and the mayo was money.  And lets not forget about the dog great bold flavor and texture.    If you are from California or the west you are well acustomed to the disapointment that is Texican Mexican food.  FEAR NOT   This is legit mexican flavor and taste.  I lived in Mexico for a while and got addicted to their hot dogs and these guys replicate it perfectly.    The owner is awesome and is a true craftsman in his execution.  I LOVE the small menu.  They keep it simple and deliver awesome food every time   To the clown who posted a 1 star review on this place...give a real review.  If you are complaining about a  6 lunch you need to start cooking at home for yourself.    I m hoping they will open a downtown location so I can get my fix more often.  Can t wait to try the burrito as well.  Can only imagine how good that will be.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,381,This place is amazing  I m from Arizona and ever since moving to Austin I ve missed Sonoran style Mexican food - Tex Mex just doesn t compare  This is exactly what I was missing  The food is phenomenal - the Sonoran dog they re famous for is a MUST  Additionally the carne asada tacos are fantastic. Great service  friendly people  AMAZING food    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,382,This place has one of the best quesadillas ever  the owner was very attentive and very quick attending customers. My husband and I came here on a quick trip  but definitely coming back to this food truck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,383,If you know anything about food trucks in Austin then you know that most of them are amazing. This place is one of those places. This was by far the best hot dog I have ever eaten. The burrito was amazing as well. The price was a little high if you think of it as just an ordinary hot dog but well worth it once you start to eat. This is no ordinary hot dog. The staff was also amazingly helpful. It is a little hard to find unless you are looking for it but once you find the place you will defiantly be coming back for another bite.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,384,It was very different  The man was very nice and informative about the food  All super fresh and soo good   Definitely would come back again and recommend
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,385,Best hot dog ever. No seriously. I m not joking. You have to go all the way and get your Sonoran dog Con Todo. It s delish. I m a plain dog  amp  bun kinda gal  because I love the taste of a hot dog. I wasn t sure I d enjoy it Con Todo  but it s the only way to go. Toppings are just the right amount. Oh and the bunsyou could eat those just by themselves too. Owners are super friendly. Good food  good service  good ambience.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,386,I just tried the Sonora Dog yesterday and it was amazing. Interesting mix with the beans  bacon  hot dog  and jalapen  sauce. I can t wait to go back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,387,Delicious con todo hotdogs  Went with my girlfriend and brought my dog. Nice seating arrangements. It was clean and convenient  The hotdogs were worth the drive.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,388,T Loc  you blew my mind. I m speechless. This food is SO BOMB guys... we drove all the way from Killeen to try this food  WORTH IT. We are from Tucson  so our expectations were high. And man you went over and beyond  You need a truck in Tucson  you need a truck EVERYWHERE  Thank you for bringing a little bit of our home to Texas  I wish you the best 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,389,I  love this place. Great Hebrew national hot dog with beans celery mustard and tomatoes. Could not bring myself to get the mayo on a hot dog. The speciality drink was great. Watermelon   so good. I got a refill.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,390,One of the best hot dogs I ve ever had  Very friendly people as well  They use these special sweet buns that just tie it all together. Must try 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,391,Great food  never a let down. If you haven t eaten here   you are truly missing out. The hot dogs are the bomb   So good  I think I can enjoy 5 in one setting  I ordered 3 today. My gosh I still have that wonderful taste in my mouth.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,392,Location has moved to 2308 Hancock Drive. Tucson Locals was the bomb  The Sonoran Hot Dogs were terrific. Buns are brought in from Tucson are terrific. The new location is shady and spacious. Look for the blue UoA food truck and take a taste trip to Tucson 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,393,Really tasty hot dog via Arizona  the Sonoran hot dog is the way to go. Bacon wrapped enough said  Well they ve got more than bacon on the hot dog  get it fully loaded for a truly wonderful experienced in hot dog heaven 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,394,DAAAAMMMNNN    That s a good Hot Dog  I ve been craving a mexican hot dog for a long time now and this place NAILED IT  Do yourself a favor and come revel in this savory hot dog amazingness. I got the Sonora Hot Dog- Con Todo. Totally loving this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,395,The first time I came through here  the owner made me a great carne asada burrito with no frills but delicious  4 stars . I made the mistake of ordering the  11 steak fries on Friday night thinking they would be like the burrito . The crinkle cut fries were not crispy enough  the cheese was good but lacking  he 1 4 lb of steak seemed a lot less  coming from a mostly pescatarian eater  and overall it was very BLAND-not what I want from steak fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,396,Got the carne asada plate and it was SO good. Could eat here every day 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,397,T-Loc is such a rad dude and makes the meanest hot dogs. I go for the buns. The new location is much better than the old one on burnet. I recommend this truck to my friends often 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,398,This foodtruck is a one-trick pony and it s one trick is very polarizing. Either you ll love a Sonora Hot Dog and it s beans or you ll be meh. I m meh. It s really just not my thing. I might just not be a fan of this style of hot dog. I love plenty of other kinds.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,399,An excellent hot dog   Good service  other options  but this is a great dog....best with Mexican Coke 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,400,Pretty good hot dog  I was in Austin for a day and wanted something new. Glad I tried this food truck. I am ready to go back to Austin to try this place again. The customer service was also very good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,401,The dogs are amazing   I am contemplating another trip back to Austin just to eat here again  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,402,Came here just the other day to try out their sonoran dogs. They tasted exactly like the sonoran hot dogs in Tucson  AZ where I grew up  I think it s great that someone has brought the sonoran dogs to ATX. Miguel is from Tucson and knows what Tucsonians look for in their sonoran dogs  I look forward to coming back to this food truck in the near future. Enjoy   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,403,I like traditional hotdogs.  Steamed buns  chili  yellow mustard  onions.  But if you need a good hotdog this spot it tasty even if a little wacky.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,404,After hearing amazing things about this place  from more than one person  I decided to give this place a try. The food is amazing  and the owners are wonderful people. The carne asada burrito is delicious  but their staple item  the Sonoran hot dog  is where it s at  You ll never look at hot dogs the same way again  and that s a very good thing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,405,Just had an amazing hot dog at Sonora  Super fresh  slightly crispy dog wrapped in bacon with an awesome grilled bun and all the toppings. Owner was nice enough to get me a sample of the pineapple agua fresco and let me just say that I m not sure why anyone would ever drink anything else.   Can t wait for the new location as I m sure it will be a bit more shady and with less drive by traffic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,406,The Sonoran was absolutely delicious   Hit the spot after a day of hiking. They have moved to a nice shady little spot off Hancock.  Super nice and friendly 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,407,T-loc s was my first introduction to the Sonoran  veggie  hotdog when they were located a bit further north by Conscious Cravings  and now that they ve moved to the new Burnet Rd. food trailer park  I m even more excited  The owner and employees are super nice  and always remember us  even when it s been a while. The new location boasts plenty of seating  a play area for kids  and even more food trailer options if you have a diverse group who may not all want some t-loc s  though really  you should be convincing them to try it at least once . Oh  and try the fresh flavored water if they have it  you won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,408,I must have been to the wrong Sonora...their much touted special hot dog was Not. It was nothing beyond a small frank on a  non heated  regular bun. They added pico and bacon - but that doesn t make it special IMO. Highly AVERAGE 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,409,Honestly  I was hesitant the eat here because as a pescetarian  hot dogs are usually near the top the list of places to skip  but friends encouraged me to check it out. T-Loc s exceeded my expectations  I got the veggie dog with jalape o sauce and it was delicious   They use Smart Dogs for the veggie dog and the bread for the bun was fluffy and toasted to perfection. That little roasted pepper on the side sealed the deal  The hot dog game has officially been raised.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,410,As a self-proclaimed Foodie Snobby food critic  I have to say these hot dogs are the best I ve had.  Hands down.    My husband and I had lunch at T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs on Burnet.  Not only are the hot dogs insanely delicious  the owner was as personable as they come.  This truck is beyond worth coming back to.  If I can pull myself away from the hot dogs I ll try the burrito.  It looks amazing also 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,411,These are some of the best hot dogs I ve had  I m not big on hot dogs so that s saying a lot. Great service too. They ran out of the fresh fruit water when I showed up 30 mins before closing  but the owner said that their water is made fresh every morning and they have been running out. I m going back tomorrow just to try their water.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,412,I loves this place. Honestly  best hot dogs I ve ever had. I haven t had a single bad meal here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,413,This hotdog beats any other hotdog in the world. Chicago  New York bring it. You can t stand against this dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,414,What the hell  There should be a line of people here. Let s go people. Great after work stop in. Home made fresh fruit drink and quick great food. The couple who own run Sonora Hot Dogs is so sweet. Great simple food with a Sonora flair. Come before the place is discovered and the lines get long    I m back for a second time in less than a week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,415,At first I was a little worried about having mayo on my hot dog but decided to try something new. I have to say that this is the best hotdog I ve ever had  Totally worth visiting 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,416,Pure deliciousness. My wife is from Arizona and loves coming here any chance she can and as a New Mexican  I love this place as well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,417,A great food truck find with the friendliest owner  We had a Sonora hot dog-loved that it was wrapped in bacon and that the bun was so soft  the carne asada burrito with pico and guacamole  the beef quesadilla-their tortillas are so good  and the peach aqua fresca. We loved it all   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,418,Been there a couple times and the dude is total badass  both times he came over and chatted us up for a few minutes. He noticed I was speaking spanish with my fiancee and he busted out in all Spanish so props for that as well. Very attentive and really into his food and cooking you can see he has a passion for it. He also gave our dog Bobby some treats.   The hotdogs were excellent but dat burrito doe  Seriously just writing about it makes me want to go eat there. Good thing he s within walking distance.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,419,After the first time I ate here  I made a yelp account specifically to give Miguel and Zulma five stars.  This place is the best.    I stopped by yesterday for a quick and delicious dinner  and Miguel told me yelp wasn t giving my review much weight or something because I don t review enough places.  So I m writing another one just for Sonora Hot Dogs   My boyfriend and I have stopped by several times  and it s now one of our favorite places.  The owners seem like old friends now   We found out they got a review in the Chronicle  which was of course very positive - yay them   Anyway  in my last post I talked about how great the food is  and how happy I was to find it in Austin after having lived a while in Arizona.  This time  I have to rave about the aguas frescas.  I am a huge horchata fan and that s usually what I get here.  But the boyfriend is a  real  Mexican who loves cucumber.  I m a  fake  Mexican who doesn t - I actually kind of hate cucumbers.  But when Zulma offered a taste of her cucumber agua  I obliged.  To my happy surprise - It was delicious    So refreshing.  She does a great job getting creative with these drinks and I hope she continues to make the cucumber one   It tasted like the most refreshing mint lemonade-ish beverage imaginable.    As I told the owners  the only thing that could improve this place is carne asada fries     Keep up the great work and congrats on the growing business 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,420,To start off with the location is clean  warm and inviting. Plenty of parking in the lot or at the car wash next door. There are 3 large picnic tables for a nice outdoor eating experience. The owners Michael and his wife  offered a warm greeting as I walked up and were very friendly. I ordered my food which was an authentic  Sonora Hot Dog with everything on it. I was even offered a cold horchata while I waited. The horchata was delicious. After a few minutes wait my Sonora Hot Dog was ready and looked amazing. I think I had only a few bites in and had decided that I had to have another one. The combination of the bacon wrapped hot dog with the homemade specialty sauces and fresh chopped veggies on top in the specialty bun all come together in your mouth for a tasty delight. The second one did not disappoint me. It was just as awesome as the first. So if you are in the mood for the best hot dog experience ever stop by and pick up a few of these. I did not try the burrito but I plan on it my next trip to T Locs Sonora Hot Dogs.  I also noticed that they offer 3 types of hot dogs including a vegetarian hot dog for all of you vegetarians and vegans to enjoy. They also serve a variety of beverages including bottled cokes from mexico  horchata and coconut water.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,421,A co-worker of mine tried this place for the first time last week and was nice enough to bring me back an agua fresca. The flavor for that week was watermelon  and it was AMAZING  Im originally from El Paso and have not had any aguas frescas that compare to what I had back home  until I had theirs. It was exactly the way my mom and abuelita made it  a little bit of pulp and just the right amount of sweetness. They added some ribbons of fresh mint which I thought was the perfect compliment to this already refreshing drink. Yesterday  I took my fiance to finally try the food. We shared a burrito de carne asada and a hot dog  con todo.  The burrito was perfect.  Carne asada  guacamole  and pico de gallo wrapped in a thin flour tortilla. In my opinion  great Mexican cuisine follows a simple rule  a few simple but good quality ingredients orchestrated just right together provide the best flavors. The hot dog was also delicious  with just the right amount of toppings. I am not a ketchup lover myself and was overjoyed that the  con todo  hot dog did not include ketchup. The flavor of agua fresca I had was mango-also delicioso. Its great to see that they were using real fruit to make them  and not artificial flavors.  The couple was extremely nice  and seemed genuinely happy that we enjoyed their food so much. My fiance decided he want to try the quesadilla with carne asada  he eats like a horse and never seems to gain any weight . I had a bite and it was also delicious  crisp tortilla and gooey cheese on the inside. I m so glad this food truck opened up in Austin  and it s right down the street from where I work  And to think  my new found obsession all started from an agua fresca 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,422,Been trying to come for a couple of weeks  finally got a chance today. Got here and the people working were very polite  and even apologized for being closed the previous times we came. Totally worth the wait  these dogs are amazing  Had been wanting one since I saw this style on Man VS Food. Will be coming back more than a few times 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,423,Wow really good hot dogs.  I got the sonoran dog and it was really really good.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,424,Wow that carne asada burrito hit the spot. The Sonoran Style Hot dog had great flavor and I wanted seconds.  What I really needed was stretchy pants and someone to roll me out of there. The owner was really friendly and made it worth going back in the future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,425,I brought my husband today for his first Sonora hot dog. I had my first a couple of weeks ago  before the trailer moved to it s new location   it s hard to find  but it s basically in the parking lot directly across the street from Sonic on Burnet . These hot dogs are really good  and made fresh by the owner on the spot. It will not disappoint. I will be certainly going back  and maybe next time I ll try something else from the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,426,They forgot my tortilla  my food was cold and it did not taste as good as everyone said
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,427,How do you eat a hot dog anywhere else after having one from here  I love this place and so does my bank account   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,428,Great hot dog with lots of flavor. I should have gotten two. If you have a vegetarian in your party they can eat at the vegetarian stand next to this stand.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,429,This place is hard to park for when you are in a rush but the hotdogs themselves are worth the hassle. I need to give fellow yelpers a shoutout for their reviews too  this place is the real deal. I got the hotdog con todo and it was simply amazing. The Great Food Truck Race started my interest and yelpers only encouraged it more. Try it out  the staff is superfriendly too  make you feel welcome.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,430,I had the Con Todo the  regular  way and I must say it was awesome    I ve never had a hot dog prepared this way but it was really tasty.   I will check these guys out again and try some more things on the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,431,Good place  Owners are friendly and love what they do. I had the Sonora Hot Dog which was great. Then had a carne asada was better then most but this is hard to find in the ATX. So with that they come pretty close. The tamarindo agua fresca was just perfect  Service a 5  Hot dog a 4  burrito a 3  water a 4 so overall a 4.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,432,I ordered the Sonoran hot dog and also a burrito which I split with a friend.  The hot dog was good however I think the burrito was better. Owner was very friendly I definately recommend you try this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,433,I discovered what a Sonoran dog is while driving through Tucson two years ago  and have been talking about it since. This place is a great local spot to get your fix. Bacon-wrapped hot dog  beans  tomatoes  grilled jalapeno  a bun flown in from Tucson....  The staff owners are really friendly and the outdoor picnic tables allow you to eat it on site  i.e. get a second if you love the first one like I did.  For those with dinner companions who don t eat meat  the adjacent trailer specializes in healthy veggie options.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,434,Heard about this place online and you tube so  thought we would try it. Delicious   The hot dog was really tasty and the carne asada burrito was the deal. It all the right taste buds   Chef owner was incredibly sweet  friendly  and welcoming. Definitely would recommend this place and we will be back. It s a lil piece of Arizona in Atx  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,435,Born and raised in Austin and this is by far one of the best hotdogs I ve ever had here. Seriously. I didn t know a hotdog could be that good.   The atmosphere is awesome and laid back and Miguel treats you like family  I had their signature T-LOC Con Todo... Alright  I had two  but they re really that good... especially when you pair it with a Mandarin Jarritos and a bag of Fritos.   I d recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious meal if they re short on time. Or kickback and enjoy the picnic table setup. Either way  you won t be disappointed. I m glad these guys came to Austin  because they sure represent Tucson well   -  K 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,436,Best hot dogs in town with the best customer service  I always recommend this food truck to anyone who visits.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,437,this place is excellent.  run by friendly  competent people who have passion for what they do.  the sonoran dog con todo is sublime.  crispy yet juicy hot dog wrapped in bacon.   warm grilled bun roll.   every ingredient is perfectly conceived and place.   go here.  you will be addicted.   i love this food.   i won t eat a hot dog elsewhere.  best hot dog in austin.   thanks for bringing this to austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,438,WOW       Never had a hot dog quite like this- freaking awesome     Mayo on a hotdog  Wrapped in bacon  Yes please
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,439,Got the Sonora hot dog. It was so juicy and the buns tasted like donuts without the sweetness. The bun pretty much tasted like fried dough. And the guy was really nice  which is always a plus.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,440,I d say get the carne asada burrito or get the hotdogs wrapped with the bacon. The taste and flavor is so good. The tortillas are delicious and the buns are like a fluffy sleeping bag.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,441,This is now our favorite food truck in Austin. How do you choose between a hot dog or a burrito  You don t  you get one of each. My hot girlfriend and I each took a bite  looked at each other and said  yep.  Food is great  atmosphere is great  and the owner is great. We will come back often.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,442,Oh T-Loc s  where have you been my whole life  This ladies and gentlemen is their  con todo.  A bacon wrapped dog on a bed of beans  topped with sweet tomatoes and onions. With creamy mayo  mustard and  a jalape o sauce to boot. The only thing missing is the kitchen sink. They get their bread from their hometown of Albuquerque  I believe  can t recall if that s right  which adds a bit of sweetness. All balanced by a salted charred chile for a little heat. This is what a food truck is about  a small menu that they do right. Check it out  Food-gasm rant over.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,443,Easily the best hot dog I ve ever had. Hebrew National  Con Todos . From the bun to dog itself  unique and delicious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,444,New location....yelp address is wrong. Great space with Picnic benches. Had the Sonora dog which was great- best hot dog I ve had in a while  Good casual lunch or snack spot...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,445,OMG the best veggie hot dogs around. The bun is mouth-watering good. The only problem was I ate it too quickly and wanted another. Forget the calories and enjoy. Yum 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,446,My wife being from Tucson  these hotdogs taste just like the ones from Guero Canelo.  Had to buy several for my pregnant wife 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,447,Dang good dog.  Got it loaded and glad I did.  Fantastic flavors mingling together in hot dog heaven.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,448,Pretty tasty hot dog  Just wish they had a little more variety with the different hot dogs. Otherwise great and the staff was cool too  High five 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,449,Let me start by saying I m not much of a hot dog fan  but drive by here all the time so decided to give it a try. So glad I did  Hubs  amp  I both had a con todo  amp  split a cheese quesadilla. This was plenty of food  amp  we are not dainty eaters  The dog was great  amp  I loved the grilled pepper on the side. Plus our dogs got treats which is a nice touch. Owner was super friendly. We ll be back fo sho 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,450,You d be a fool not to try this place   I got two of the bacon wrapped dogs  and they were crazy good   Also  tried some fresh pineapple water that they had that was great  too.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,451,The Sonora hot dog is an Austin must try. So delicious. Best hot dog I ve ever had in terms of bread  weenie  and toppings. Their carne asada tacos are excellent too. Great prices. Main dude in charge is very nice and makes you feel like family. Excellent area too with lots of choices. Your new go to for indecisive groups wanting a taste of Austin cuisine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,452,Ok... just had to have my Hot Dawgg Fix... so I stopped by this littke  itty-bitty food truck  Sonora   Sonora style Street fare hot Dogs  the way the make em in Arizona   so I was educated by the Owner Mike  whom by the way was an Awesome cool guy along with his lady and partner Ms Zuma ... I am putting in adoption papers right now  because this 60 yr old Mama is gonna adopt  Best dogone dawgg I have had yet here in Austin  I swear I had Menage et toi Sex  with me  my mouth and hot dogs ...   NOT only was it devine Sex  it was  Orgazamic Sex  July flavorful and had so many yummy goodies that made me feel I was having a meal not a snack...i gulped down TWO....  KEEP it UP KIDS  LOVE... MOM 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,453,Staff is incredibly polite     The food is even better. Not a long wait     Loved it    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,454,The best Sonoran Dog I have ever had and I live in Tucson   My son moved to Austin earlier this year and we decided to stop by while visiting him for some home cooking.  We were not disappointed.  They were a bit pricy but worth every penny.  Next time I will have to try the burrito.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,455,Yes  the carne asada burrito really is THAT good  and the people who run the trailer are delightful. I ll be back  but don t know if I ll ever try the hot dogs  because the carne asada is divine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,456,If you ve never had a flat Arizona tortilla  you ve got to try this place out   Back story  My wife s family is from Tucson  AZ  and we have visited a few times. The Mexican food there is pretty amazing  although pretty different from Tex-Mex  which I love . The flour tortillas in Tucson tend to be big thin ones instead of the fluffy ones we see most often in Texas. This is the only place in town I ve seen use the Tucson style tortillas  and it s nice to get my fix.  Also  I like to judge my Mexican food joints based on bean and cheese tacos burritos. If you can t get your beans right  you re not the place for me.   So  going back to the review  I got the bean and cheese burrito with my Tucson style tortilla and it was delicious  The beans tasted great and had a nice consistency  the cheese was real cheese and not american style nacho cheese  and the tortilla was perfect. Very very good burrito. The only downside was the price - a bit steep for a simple burrito. But  I will be back. Looks like I need to try the hot dog next.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,457,I don t know if I went on an off day or not  but I found the Premium Sonoran con todo  to be a bit bland.  I was really looking forward to trying this famed dog.  It was just ok.  Too much mayonnaise  beans were bland and even the jalapeno sauce was bland.  The bacon and dog really didn t have too much sabor either.  The bun was soft  but in a way threw the whole dog totally over to the bland side. They were super busy when I was there  and forgot the grilled pepper as well. Were my taste buds just off   I don t know  but I m willing to give them another try some day.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,458,I love this place  His food is spot on to what you would come to expect from Sonoran style Mexican food  The burrito is perfect and the Sonoran dogs are amazing  I even love the charred chile     This should remind you of home  Tucsonans.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,459,I have been wanting to try one of these sonora dogs for a few years now.  When I passed by this place I got really excited and stopped by.  Pretty happy I did.  This dog  with everything  is pretty amazing.  I only really have a craving for a hot dog once in a while  but I would have one of these a week.  Very Good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,460,I had to try this hot dog truck with 5 stars.  I m not really a hot dog fan  but... these are worth going out of your way for   Order at least two  you will want another.  As a bonus  T-Loc is a really nice guy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,461,Great food and great service. It holds up to the food cart standard of being slightly overpriced and having servings slightly under sized. Though the buns are better  this place is outdone by Its competitor El Salchichon  off of Pleasant Valley. Granted  El Salchichon isn t perfect either - with its less than desirable location and its raging compressor noise but the bottom line is this puppy gives the nod to El Salchichon for bringing the heat and laying on the cheese. Don t get me wrong  if you are in the area give it a try 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,462,Yum yum yum     They know how to serve up a hot dog    And the service is fantastic. Really nice folks from Tucson. Try their homemade agua frescas.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,463,This was my first experience with this style of hot dog and I ll definitely be coming back. I m not completely sure what was on the dog I ate but it was quite tasty. The guy also gave me a free agua fresca because it was so hot and I had mustache sweat  I assume . Thanks guy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,464,Today  we finally broke free of cold grey weather that had blanketed Austin it seemed like for weeks. I m sure its only been a few day s but that s how Austin winter weather wimps feel  This day had glorious  Texas blue sky s and sun. Today would be my day to sit outside and reward myself with a Sonoran Hot dog  My only fear - would this dog live up to the hype in my head  As I had not read any yelp reviews.  Not only did it exceed my hype but it seems also the other 101 5 stars reviews here on yelp. Miguel Kaiser was a delighful and personable as could be. Order the dog all the way  trust the chef as each tasty element builds a mouth bomb of deliciousness. The grilled pepper along side the dog with a wash down of tamarind soda was a bingo. Stay Hungry My friend s and get on over here quick.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,465,The Sonoran Hot Dog  con todo  is the best dog in town   The owners are from Arizona and bring this style from the state if Sonora.   Super friendly service   Always good    I can t go back to a plain hotdog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,466,So yummy  I went to U of A and these are just as amazing as the originals in Tucson  maybe better. The bread is FedEx d in and unlike any other boring hot dog bun. The sauces are delicious and the whole dog tastes so fresh with all the toppings  Will be a 1x a week visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,467,I had never experienced a Sonora Hot Dog until last night... Simply amazing  I was blown away by how delicious it was. Only advice I d give for first timers... Get two  They were so good my boyfriend and I had both wished we d ordered another 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,468,The food here is tasty   My  Con Todo  hot dog was fresh  had plenty of flavor and didn t make me feel heavy afterwards. The couple running the food truck was very kind and enjoyable. I look forward to dragging my husband there soon    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,469,I don t even like hot dogs but they have a veggie dog that s amazing. The picture on the truck is exactly what the real thing looks like. The dog comes with layers of toppings and a grilled pepper that has just a little heat. The bun ingeniously prevents any drips and it s delicious too. There are also a bunch of other food trucks nearby  Gourdoughs is one   in a nice space where you ll want to sit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,470,The Sonora dog is excellent and reminiscent of the Guadalajara hot dog at Pink s in LA.  The owner  Miguel  is welcoming and knows his cuisine.  He s Cordon Bleu trained  and knows how to treat a customer.  Miguel has worked at the top of the culinary world  think Thomas Keller  yes that Thomas Keller  and has built a reputation for knowing how to put together an outstanding meal and his disciplined approach to meal preparation presentation.  I ended up ordering a second hot dog  because it was just that good.  Somehow  the crispy tomato and onions offset the bacon just right to make the Sonora a refreshing treat.  I m definitely coming here again.   I can t visit Miguel s food truck without ordering at least two Sonora dogs.  It s definitely among my local favorites in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,471,Uh.. As someone who had a true sonoran-style dog in Mexico.... For me  I think it s just an overrated hot dog place.. I was expecting their dog to be much bigger... but it is not. It s just too small for 5-6 bucks. However  the dog was not bad  that s why I had to give at least 3 stars. I hate to say this  but I d rather get 7 eleven s...which is much cheaper.. only  2  and you have a variety of topping selections.. japape os..onions whatever you want .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,472,Austin-ites YOU guys don t know what a gem you have in your own back yard    Family and I were visiting Austin and just noticed this place as we were exiting HEB across the street on Burnet Road.   The menu is short and simple but the food is GREAT    If you want a LIGHT meal then go for a Sonora Hot Dog  wife and grandma got one and loved it  and an agua fresca   Limeade and Horchata on this visit.   If you never had a sonora hot dog  please try its original format before you start taking away or adding toppings.  If you want to go away on a full satisfied tummy  then go for the burrito  It is perfect   Owner very nice and friendly and keeps a clean truck  Speaks English and Spanish. Takes cash and some credit card.   I know there is an army of food truck services out there in Austin and this one may not be listed on Austin s top ten list of food trucks  but hopefully it will make your list    Update June 13  2014  We were heading back home out of Austin and the wife had all the food options that we had already experienced  chain  mom n  pop  amp  other food trucks  but she decided on Sonora Hot Dogs   Plenty of shade to sit down and enjoy a great meal  Friendly  friendly owners   Granted I came back the next day  but was greeted as if it had been year 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,473,You think a hot dog is something just for Sunday afternoon  Don t be fooled. These are actually professionally trained chefs weaving together a sensory blend of never-forget flavors from a mass of ingredients. Great personality too.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,474,I can t stay away from this place   If you ve ever lived in SoCal and miss your carne asada burritos  this is the joint   The tortillas are exactly what you d expect from SoCal  too   They even wrap it in the traditional yellow paper   Go now 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,475,I m a Chicana from San Diego  CA  a.k.a. home of amazing carne asada burritos . Californians know a good place based on the quality of their carne asada  and this place definitely passes the test  I have lived in Austin for almost two years now  and T-Loc s is the first establishment that immediately delivered the taste of home. I highly recommend this place and I am excited to try the rest of the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,476,Best hot dogs ever  great agua fresca  and even better service   What more could you ask for   This place is awesome and their new location has a cute and shady outdoor seating area.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,477,I got the Sonora dog  regular  con todo .  That dog was so good and juicy  the bread was nice and fresh  and the beans and bacon and garnishes made this the best hot dog I ve had in Austin by far   We also tried the carne asada burrito  and all I can say is it was sick...in the best way.  The meat was juicy and well-seasoned with a good tortillas  and that s all it had.  It was simple and delicious because that was all a truly good burrito needs when the product is excellent quality. Sprinkle some salsa and lime on the side and you re good to go.  The agua fresca of strawberry was nice and refreshing and not syrupy.  Plus I got a free refill.  Also  the chef was really friendly and you can tell he takes pride in making his food taste great.  Definitely try to this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,478,Fist time to visit today and will not be my last.   The hotdog looks like a work of art and taste just as fancy.   The perfect amount of spice and sauce in between a fresh bun.   The service was friendly and fast.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,479,By far the best hotdogs of Austin. They are delicious.  They even bring the bread from Arizona to keep the taste authentic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,480,This place is hands down one of the best food trailers around. This husband wife duo are passionate  clean  and consistently on point. This is amazing food  everyone should have this unbelievable hot dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,481,Hot dogs on another level. This simple food truck is a welcomed addition to the diverse food scene off Burnet Rd. The service was fast and friendly and the veggie dog easily filled the hot-dog shaped hole in my heart. Vegetarian or not  you have got to try the veggie dog w  all the fixings fixing to fixins. Also  grab a refreshing Topo to wash it down.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,482,The owner is incredibly friendly  the food is super tasty  everything is as good as it gets. I love this place and I ll be back asap.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,483,I had my first Sonoran hot dog in Tucson  AZ and thought that I would never be able to have one unless I went back. When I first arrived in Austin  I was starving and immediately looked up the best food joints in the city. Sonora Hot Dogs came up first and I felt elated that I could fix my craving. The food truck is set up in cute location with a small parking lot  a few spaces   a tree covered eating area with picnic tables and umbrellas. The owner was incredibly nice and fun to interact with. The Sonoran hot dogs were perfect - just like Tucson. All of the flavors from the bread to the sauce were delightful. If you have never had one  I seriously recommend you take the opportunity because these hot dogs and the service are amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,484,I thought I died and went to heaven    Ate there twice on our 3 day visit to Austin. Burritos are amazing and the service is friendly and quick
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,485,Ok  I used to live in Sanora. One day at work I had a craving.  Need I say more   This place nailed it. Great  bun   great taste. Felt like I was back at the hot dog cart roadside in Nogales.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,486,I just happened by this food truck and was glad I did.  I went with the veggie option which can be hit or miss.  This was my first visit and it seemed like it took a long time to  which it does in comparison to a pedestrian street dog .  This is by no means a complaint as it was well worth the wait.  What you are given is an unusually flavorful treat with many flavors.  It was delicious and I will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,487,I can t wait to go back   My husband and I split the con todo and Carne Asada Burrito. Both were excellent. I don t eat hot dogs all too often but this was off the charts. I could eat here every day of the week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,488,We stopped in here because it was close by in burnet.  We were definitely surprised by how good this was.  Very fresh ingredients  and great tasting hot dog.  The owner was great to talk to.  Recommend you try this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,489,The best Hot dog ever. Try it one of my favorite places to go and eat. The sonora hot dog is one of a kind.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,490,Had heard lots of good things about this place and finally had a chance to try it today. I was not disappointed. Tried the premium Sonora Dog and it was delicious. As kind of an after thought I also tried the Carne Asada Burrito. Man  It was so good I almost ordered another. The picnic tables shaded by large trees made for a perfect outdoor setting - even in 90 degree weather. The staff were super friendly too. Made for a great all around experience. Definitely check this place out - and I m gonna keep my fingers crossed that they open up another location down south a little closer to my work.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,491,Wow  I m so impressed by this food truck  I had the Sonora style hotdog. The buns are shipped from Arizona. If you haven t eaten here  you re missing out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,492,Recently spent a month and a half in Austin  and this was one of my favorites. I was actually surprised with how delicious the hot dog was. It seems like a weird combination of items and condiments  but they all go together so well. The owners were extremely nice  gave us a bit of a background on the joint and the food they were cooking up. He told us they bring the buns in from Arizona since it s a specific kind you apparently can t get in Texas. Definitely worth it. If there was a food truck serving this up in Chicago  I d be there all the time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,493,Cheap  filling  and delicious. Perfect 3 3 for late night eating and in a prime location on Burnet. Great service as well too. The cook was very nice and even offered to bring my order to my car while I waited. Never had one of these dogs till today and i can honestly say i ll be back soon for another. Really interesting combination of flavors and would totally recommend this place to others.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,494,There are very few things good about Tucson  but one is the Sonora Hot Dog. We ve been in Austin a few years now from Phoenix and thankfully we d discovered T-Loc s.  Man is this a great hot dog   In fact it s so good I ll forgive the University of Arizona stickers on their trailer  Go Devils  . My lunch companion had a burrito too and said it was outstanding.  T-Loc  you put out a great dog...I ll be back...more than once 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,495,was passing thru texas heard about t-locs . got the asada quesadilla kinda bland also found what looked like a hair. wont be going back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,496,Had great expectations based on the positive reviews.   Sitting at a picnic table in the middle of a huge slab of concrete  SHD is right next to a car wash  just 10 yards from Burnet Rd isn t the greatest atmosphere esp if it s hot outside.  Not to mention this is right across the street from the HEB at Burnet  amp  Koenig so the traffic is heavy almost all the time.  But I didn t hit SHD to relax under a shade tree.  I came for the dog dawg.  SHD delivers a good quality dog on a good quality bun with good quality ingredients.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  All served with a postive attitude.  I was expecting to have my socks knocked off based on all the buzz.  The ingredients on the dog were creative but not anything you couldn t accomplish in the privacy of your own home for a lot less.  Wait time seemed kind of long too considering only one couple was in front of me  amp  I was ordering 2 dogs to go for us.  If I was the kind of guy to pay top dollar for car washes  amp  I was hanging out waiting for my car to get cleaned at this particular car wash  amp  I was craving a gut bomb SHD would be on my radar.  Since I m not that kind of guy  amp  don t go that way I wouldn t go out of my way for another SHD.  In other words if I was dropping  10- 15 bux on a car wash  amp  was stuck here I d be cool with dropping  5- 6 bux for a hot dog.  If that sounds like your bag then you will love this place.  Did I mention everyone working here at SHD was really friendly 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,497,Unbelievably good  and addictive   These hot dogs are absolutely delicious  and I could tell that they are made with top quality ingredients. If you like hot dogs  or even if you don t  get one of these 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,498,I ordered two premium hot dogs without bacon and an agua fresca de pina pineapple water . I paid about  15. That is the most I ve paid at a food truck. The food was decent and I would come back sooner if the hot dogs costed a little less.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,499,I m not a hot dog guy BUT these are amazing.  Other menu items are equally as amazeballs.  The owner is extremely cool and Wednesday nights are the best since the D amp D place is closed.  Check this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,500,After leaving U of A and moving to Austin  I ve been homesick for a good Sonoran dog. After a few lousy imitations I had low expectations here. T-Locs blew me away    the bread is right    Those of you from Tucson know what I mean  it was a classic sonoran  everything I ve missed since leaving tucson. Great find  An extra star for the A on the trailer - and theres an Amys right across the street for dessert
Veracruz All Natural,1,In a city of breakfast tacos  Veracruz rises above all others. It s a top 5 breakfast taco in the city.   Sincerely   A man who has eaten too many breakfast tacos
Veracruz All Natural,2,  5.5 out of 5 stars  Holy Moly Veracruz is a gem    My second time here in three days and my mind is blown even more this time by their migas taco.   We came to the park to get coffee from Desnudo  which is also a gem BTW. During our conversation  the Desnudo staff strongly recommended the two migas items  migas taco  amp  migas poblanas taco  from Veracruz. He also mentioned that Veracruz migas taco was listed as one of top 5 tacos in the US. So I decided to start with the migas original.   It is AMAZING    Packed with texture and flavor  the migas taco contains egg  tortilla chips  cheese  avocado  and vegetables. It was a feast by itself. When I saw the  5 price  I was surprised because it s definitely on the expensive end for a taco. However  the moment I saw the portion and had a bite   5 felt cheap.   Absolutely gonna try the migas poblanas soon 
Veracruz All Natural,3,I love tacos. When done right  they can be one of the simplest and most exciting bites in the culinary universe. But when they get over-complicated  it s easy to miss the mark.   The folks here were really kind and seem very passionate about what they do. I wanted to like these so much but they just felt a bit overstuffed  a bit overpriced  and didn t quite hit the spot.   I realize that some people like this style  and it may just not be for me. But we ve had street tacos  elevated tacos  and everything between  and these disappointed us. Austin has so many tried and true local places and we ll probably support those next time.
Veracruz All Natural,4,Veracruz is a staple for Austinites  they have several food trucks around town and a brick and mortar downtown.  Their menu has options for vegetarians and being a newbie vegetarian gal myself  I appreciated the fact that they had 3 vegetarian tacos on the menu.  Super fresh quality ingredients with amazing homemade salsas  I devoured the tacos I ordered. Highly recommend  you can t go wrong with them 
Veracruz All Natural,5,Stopped by to this small food truck park to get Veracruz taco with a friend and ordered all three vegetarian tacos on the menu. The tacos are potatoes-mushroom  el diferente   cauliflower  furioso   and egg white - mushroom  La Reyna .   I really liked the spiciness of the Furioso taco because of the saut ed cauliflower  carrots  corn  and avocado. The size is pretty good too  this was the taco I ordered with double tortilla because of the filling. This was my favorite taco of all three. It could get a bit messy while eating.   I found the egg white taco better than average and it reminded me of the breakfast tacos. Though the mushrooms were really surprising in this one and got along well with the egg texture. I think you ll need some spicy sauce to got with this one.   Finally  my least fav was the el diferente which is potato and mushroom taco. This seemed very low flavored for my taste buds as the potatoes and the beans didn t carry much flavor. So even after 2 pours of sauce on it  it wasn t really tasting very appealing to me. I d rather get 2 furioso then one furioso and one diferente.   Overall the ambience is good. The wait is pretty long for tacos  like 45 mins. So I recommend to order online before reaching here because even at the venue when the wait line get long they ask everyone to order online.
Veracruz All Natural,6,One of the best taco spots in Austin. A great menu full of different items  kind staff  and an easy ordering system. Every taco I ve had here is perfect. Their quesadilla is great too  And don t sleep on the vegan queso -- it s phenomenal  This review is simple  just like Veracruz...give it a try 
Veracruz All Natural,7,I think about these tacos sometimes and reminisce how amazing they were. Highly  highly recommend visiting this place for delicious tacos with the best meats  fresh tortilla       and toppings. The carne asada and al pastor were my favorite. I liked this location a lot because of the outdoor vibe and the colorful trailer.
Veracruz All Natural,8,Some of the best breakfast tacos in Austin  Our office orders from here every Friday morning and it never gets old  I always get the Migas or the El Sancho taco. The one downtown at The Line Hotel is in a great location and right by the lake 
Veracruz All Natural,9,Number 1 or number 2 of all the taco joints we visited  about 20 or so ... I thought every taco version I had here was at the very least a tie for the best I d ever had. I even include the taco joints in Mexico that we visited...  We tried almost every taco version on the menu. And my only regret is not trying the ones we missed.  Don t be like me- try them all.
Veracruz All Natural,10,Veracruz All Natural has a great selection of tacos  breakfast tacos  and smoothies. The food is inspired by the cuisine of the Mexican state of Veracruz. The branch at Congress Street always has a crazy line  so keep driving to this spacious spot in East Austin.  Grilled Steak Taco  The grilled steak is cut into little strips that are well seasoned and mouth watering. The taco is topped with cilantro  onions  elastic strips of creamy queso fresco  and slices of avocado. The green avocado salsa pairs well with this delicious taco.  Shrimp Macha Taco  The shrimp is sauteed in garlic and butter  and are cooked perfectly with a nice snap. The amount of shrimp that they stuff in the taco is astounding and mood enhancing. There is a layer of rice in the corn tortilla that is soft and dense with a texture similar to masa that readily absorbs flavors. The taco is covered with salsa macha  which is smoky  spicy  nutty  and insanely tasty. Green onions and avocado garnish the taco.   Ordering  Steep up to the platform and order your food and drinks. They ll text you when things are ready.   Dining  There s a large open space with lots of lunch tables with multiple food trucks at the edges.
Veracruz All Natural,11,Super solid taco spot. The tacos are excellent. The salsas are quite good  with spicy options available. The fresh juices and drinks are very refreshing.   The queso on the other hand is disgusting. Tacos are a bit on the pricier side for a food truck  but everything is pricier these days.
Veracruz All Natural,12,The best breakfast tacos in Austin  I always get the different versions of the migas tacos at this truck because they knock them out of the park. They are never soggy and are even on all of the ingredients so nothing overpowers the taste. The tacos are decent in size  filled pretty full  and are appropriately filling. Really 2 to 3 a person and you will be full. The green sauce is my favorite and not too hot   I love this location because they have a large semi fenced outdoor area by the truck and other food trucks with picnic tables with umbrellas to eat on. We ordered ahead on the website and only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Sunday morning from the order to get the fresh  hot tacos at the bus.
Veracruz All Natural,13,Best migas eggs in Austin  Texas no questions asked. So hearty I always have to take a nap after it. Their green sauce takes everything to the next level. I have frequented this location and they are consistent and the tacos are always of quality. I also love their agua frescas  they are absolutely scrumptious 
Veracruz All Natural,14,The photo might now look as much but try the Barbacoa taco. I wish they didn t wrap it in foil when dining in because it makes the photo less appealing.  But I want to suggest the barbacoa if you re a regular and a bit skeptical since where the meat comes from 
Veracruz All Natural,15,This place is a MUST if you re in Austin. I came here for breakfast tacos  and I was blown away at how delicious they were. Lots of great tacos to choose from. I also loved the whole outdoor dining and seating atmosphere. I also tried the mango Agua Fresca  not pictured  which was super delicious. Out of the tacos the el sancho was my favorite because the chorizo was extremely flavorful and not overpoweringly salty. Can we also talk about how cute their branding is  The menu  the stickers  etc. I loved that the stickers on the tacos actually list out all the ingredients  Highly recommend    Note  there is a long wait  up to 30 mins or so. But it s well worth the wait  I stopped by next door to grab coffee while I waited.
Veracruz All Natural,16,At Vera Cruz All Natural Restaurant. We tried the vegan queso  not worth it   guacamole  not good  and chips  was ok   kids quesadilla was good  El Diferente Taco without mushroom was good  Migas poblana and Furiosa Taco was not good. The best refreshing ones were the pineapple juice  freshly squeezed orange juice and Mr. Verde juice. The Flan was average.
Veracruz All Natural,17,This food truck came highly recommended and did not disappoint. It s located with its own private gated picnic area complete with picnic tables.   Tacos were the bomb  We ordered a slew of tacos- steak  chicken  shrimp  and grilled fish. They re a good size  all are deelish  but our fave was the shrimp. At least 4 large size juicy shrimp per taco accompanied with rice  avocado  and some kind of chipotle topping. Messy to eat  but super yummy    Ordered agua frescas to accompany the tacos. Fresh  fresh  fresh  Mango and watermelon. Large sized  blended with fresh fruit and containing pieces of fruit. Super refreshing.  I would definitely come back.
Veracruz All Natural,18,I came for breakfast tacos after doing way too much research on  best breakfast tacos in Austin.  So this is purely a review on the breakfast tacos.  All in all  it was a let down. When we got there  we were second in line  and they had an iPad to order from. So when it was our turn and we re ordering from the iPad  a worker comes to the window and is taking orders now. The iPad ordering takes forever  so the worker took like 4 orders from people behind us in the time we ordered from the iPad  which was annoying. I have an iPad and am well versed in technology  so it wasn t me being clueless  it s just slow like placing an online order.  Anyways. I got a migas taco and chorizo taco. Migas was decent  and the chorizo and egg was a total let down  no flavor at all. Thank god for the salsas which encouraged me to finish the meal.  The workers at the food truck were friendly and happily gave me extra salsa when I went up to ask for more.  I don t think breakfast tacos are that hard to make good. For sure harder to make very good  but just good  I wouldn t go back to this place unfortunately.
Veracruz All Natural,19,I have been several times but don t write many reviews..why ...I let the stars  talk for themselves...from the amazing customer service..All the food ...Bomb made scratch tortillas...I will say breakfast is still my favorite..that red sauce is smokin good ...Best part of this visit we had In Laws visiting from  Kansas   and needless to say they were blown away...thank you Veracruz for being you  
Veracruz All Natural,20,Came for lunch around 12 30 on a Wednesday. Not busy  Plenty of seating.   Had to wait awhile for the tacos but they were freshly made and individually wrapped with labeling stickers.  The el tradicional is a classic breakfast taco. Eggs were well seasoned and bacon added great flavor. Cheesy too  Really tasty on the corn tortilla.  Furioso is a cauliflower and veggie taco. I liked the flavors but wish the vegetables were cooked down a little rather than left as raw as they were. This was also the messiest taco.   The migas poblanas taco was a nice change of pace. Loved the peppers. I would recommend getting this on flour tortillas because the corn chips softened and in combo with my corn tortilla  it was a lot of corn tortilla flavor instead of the rest of the filling. Still a fun taco.  The red and green salsas are tasty and very different from each other.
Veracruz All Natural,21,I can t say enough good things about this place. We had some amazing tacos at this unassuming joint and the aguas frescas was just as amazing. We tried four different tacos and each one was a flavor bomb  The migas taco was awesome and my husband absolutely loved the Al pastor taco. Make sure you make it out to this area and try this place.
Veracruz All Natural,22,We woke up in Austin Texas  and felt a craving for a killer taco.    We found this place.    Trust me  just come try it.
Veracruz All Natural,23,Great picture worthy food truck with a nice outdoor seating area for eating with company. Their tacos are bigger than expected and I got very full. One breakfast taco could have held me over for a morning hike. Maybe blame it on me being half asleep  but the tacos didn t blow me away.   Got the breakfast  shrimp  fish  and mole. The star of the show was the fish  Perfectly seasoned and light. Should have ordered 4 of those. The mole was well flavored but not something I would order again. The breakfast taco is just that  a breakfast taco. Nothing fancy but does the job. Unfortunately the shrimp was too salty.   Make sure to grab the sauces on the table when getting your tacos. They re delicious 
Veracruz All Natural,24,A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet but a Veracruz taco at any other location would not taste as good. Somehow  someway the tacos at this location always tastes the best. The look and feel of the place of this location is also closest to the roots of Veracruz - as a simple food truck.   The Agua Fresca here is not to be missed  Pineapple is my personal go-to . My personal favorite tacos are the Al Pastor  Schrimp Macha and of course  The Migas they re famous for.
Veracruz All Natural,25,I love this place but is typically pretty long wait  recommend ordering to go and going to the window next to the congress bridge rather than go inside.   Ordered barbacoa breakfast taco and while delicious  was pretty oily   Has outdoor seating
Veracruz All Natural,26,Been here twice in the last two week  and I cannot find one thing negative to say... I tried their Mr. Verde drink and it was so very refreshing.  So far the favorite taco is the shrimp Macha.  2 thumbs up
Veracruz All Natural,27,I came here wanting to try breakfast tacos in Texas. These tacos did not live up to what I had expected a delicious breakfast taco to taste like.  First off we waited at least 45 min for our 4 tacos at 8 30 am. They were fresh when we received them  but for ordering off a taco truck  I was very surprised to find the wait time so long  especially when there were about 4 people before us . Where I live  tacos from a food truck are ready within 5-10 minutes...   Anyways  the flavor department was definitely lacking in these tacos. I tried the Migas poblanos  which was probably my favorite  el tradicional  el diferente  and the Al pastor. The Al pastor was not what I would consider normal al pastor. The seasoning seemed off and definitely different  in a bad way. If you re alright with bland tacos  this might be for you  as the tacos and ingredients did seem to fresh.
Veracruz All Natural,28,This place was legit  Awesome little area with a couple other food trucks. Tacos are great  but the chips and guac stole the show. Best part about the meal and that s saying a lot because the steak and al pastor tacos were some of the best tacos I ve ever had.
Veracruz All Natural,29,I spent a little bit of time living on the Mexican border  but these are some of the best tacos I ve ever had.  Hit Veracruz late AM for some breakfast tacos and went for the migas taco and the migas poblanos taco  as per the recommendations of most all other reviews and websites I ve seen that tout them as some of the best. Was not disappointed. Cooked super fresh in the truck with phenomenal flavor and ingredients  I can t recommend them enough  because who doesn t love breakfast tacos. As you can see by the attached photos  the tacos aren t the prettiest to look at  but you can t judge these books by their covers.  This particular location is in a little park type area with benches surrounded by independent vendors selling their miscellaneous products  this was on a Saturday  not sure if that s the usual .  Go here if you want to get your taste bud s day started off with a bang.
Veracruz All Natural,30,I didn t think tacos for lunch could ever take 2 hours to enjoy. We arrived just before noon on July 5th. It was raining and we stood outside in line for about an hour. Many people left the line  moving us closer to the front  but it was a very very slow moving experience.  We finally got to the front of the line and I ordered  chips  queso  salsa  and 3 tacos  chicken mole  al pastor  and the vegan taco.   30 minutes later  our tacos are ready.  Their mole is delicious. I m glad I got to try it on two. The chicken was ok. It was a little dry. The vegan one was the best one of all. The al pastor was dry and crunchy  which we all found weird. Everyone in my group got one of those. It was the one we all equally hated. Every element of the taco was dry and crunchy.    This wasn t a good experience. I felt like I should give the restaurant grace because it was a holiday and maybe they didn t plan for the masses of people  but then I spoke to my doctor about it right afterward. She also said that she doesn t go here because it s too slow  so I suppose it s what s expected and I just didn t know until I experienced it.   Making the all the meats  salsas  and moles are time consuming arduous tasks  but assembling tacos is fairly fast. I don t know why this took over 2 hours from start to finish. Luckily friends were visiting and we were happy to use that wait time to catch up.  My favorite was the vegan mole taco and my friends  favorite was the chorizo. Enjoy 
Veracruz All Natural,31,If you re looking for some solid tacos in Austin  search no more    There are a few Veracruz locations throughout the city  but my friends and I stopped here for some quick food on the way to meet up with the rest of our group. We arrived about 40 minutes before they closed  were able to order pretty quickly. Veracruz uses the electronic buzzers to alert folks when their orders are ready  so it reduces any accidents around missing when their food is called out. The location in general is a great vibe  and the school bus is quite an aesthetic.   The menu is straightforward and there are some solid options  The folks inside the bus are really helpful with making good recommendations  especially around tortilla selection for the various tacos. You really can t go wrong with any tacos  just pick based on your interests  I d recommend getting 3 tacos if you re looking for a standard meal. Their drinks are also fantastic    The outdoor seating is great  and there are fans which are always appreciated in the Texas heat. One caveat... the flies in this area were awful for some reason. Not sure if it is where Veracruz is located  or if it was just the day we were there  but we  could not  get the flies to leave us alone  As a result  it turned into a mad dash to finish eating as soon as possible  which did detract from the eating experience. Additionally  it took 25-30 minutes for us to get our orders which was a little disappointing as well  since there were only a couple of other folks getting orders ahead of us.   Overall  I d say Veracruz is definitely worth a try  especially if you re looking to get some food and head to another location .
Veracruz All Natural,32,I had high expectations for this place. I thought the tacos were just ok. To be honest I thought the tacos were a bit bland. Maybe I came on an off day. I did enjoy the fresh juice  it was a refreshing and not watered down.
Veracruz All Natural,33,Best tacos we ve tried in the Austin area. And the seating situation  with large trees providing shade as well as the charming tables with high top seats  etc.  Our only criticism was no alcohol license and man  a cold beer would ve been a great accompaniment to those amazing tacos  Get the Agua Fresca instead. So good  
Veracruz All Natural,34,Delicious breakfast tacos  I went on a Monday and there was little wait. You have to order the Migas taco. It was my favorite. And their salsa is delicious too with a kick.
Veracruz All Natural,35,Within minutes of the airport  these tacos are the real deal. The corn tortillas are handmade and the taco selection is extensive. We went with an el diferente  barbacoa  steak  and a macha shrimp. None of which disappointed. Do yourself a favor and run to these tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,36,If I could just tell you what these tacos mean to me maybe you could understand. You must eat them. They re just the best in town  they just are. Consistent all the way around. Yes there s a line get over it. They are what I live for every weekend. Sometimes the east side one has this market saturdays with a live Latin music dj which is cool .
Veracruz All Natural,37,Love their tacos  The wait can be a little long but trust me it s worth the wait  Their cashew queso is pretty tasty too 
Veracruz All Natural,38,Fantastic tacos. Some of THE absolute best in Austin - hands down. Service is friendly  honest and upfront about wait time and they  work to get order completed for you as soon as possible. I ve had chicken and veggies tacos here as well as chips and queso. All of them were delicious. Love that it s a food truck with lots of space to sit and shade for hot days.
Veracruz All Natural,39,Funny place  you pull up to this little park and there are like 5 different trailers you can order all different things from but I m assuming owned by the same group. All the food is bomb. I m use to street tacos in LA which you can eat in 2-3 bites. These tacos are A LOT bigger.   Pro-tip - get an agua fresca and mix flavors.   I went when it had recently rained and all the seating and tables were wet so you may need to grab extra napkins to dry stuff off.
Veracruz All Natural,40,So many vegetarian options. Super friendly. The one with lots of veggies wasn t my fav but the potato and egg frito one was amazing. Would recommend. More expensive than other taco places but I love. Juice was pretty good too.
Veracruz All Natural,41,Couldn t leave Austin without grabbing some breakfast tacos  This location was close to our airbnb and I had heard good things about this business. We grabbed 4 tacos and waited a picnic table on a chilly morning. They stay pretty busy between people walking up to order and people placing orders ahead of time. We probably waited about 15 minutes. There was a coffee place around the corner we could ve walked to or we could ve tried one of their juices  but we just waited for our tacos. They came out warm and wrapped in foil  perfectly labeled which I thought was really great  Nothing is worse than having to open a taco and look at what s inside to determine who s it is. I don t remember all the tacos we got but I do know we enjoyed them all  I do remember I got the Migas and that was really good  They have coolers with 2 different salsas for you to grab as you need which is convenient. This is a great place for a quick affordable and delicious breakfast. If you re in a pinch be sure to order ahead of time 
Veracruz All Natural,42,Huge tacos with all the flavor  The chips and salsa should be free for dine in tbh. But it s nice that you can order and sit by the pool if you re a guest.
Veracruz All Natural,43,My favorite place to get tacos  I visit Austin every other month or so and Veracruz is always my first stop for tacos and queso.
Veracruz All Natural,44,Well today was our second visit  My husband who is the self proclaimed  barbacoa connoisseur of Texas   Said that it was the very best he has ever had  Believe me he is a big boy and loves barbacoa     From Brownsville to Amarillo and everything in between   
Veracruz All Natural,45,THIS PLACE IS EVERYTHING    best location too... such a vibe and gave me total Austin  TX sense of how awesome the community is  WARNING  you will wait a LONG time even during off peak hours...  local friends brought us here and it had an awesome vibe with Veracruz tacos AND fresh drinks  plus a little random empanada truck with lots of outdoor seating for all types of occasions  upon arrival we ordered the tacos around 1 40pm and received them at 2 15pm... between then we ordered drinks at the verzcruz drink truck  you can also order at the taco truck   and we found a seat  waited and enjoyed   THE ORDER  -watermelon fresca  22oz though I think frescas come bigger than standard 22oz -  7.50  - listen to the reviews and the staff  they will recommend this drink. IT IS SO REFRESHING and blows every fresca ive had out the window. omg... it was so refreshing on a hot day - perfectly sweet  not overly  and comes with so much. they only have one size per the person taking our order for frescas even though their menu has two sizes  -pink panther smoothie  22oz -  7.50  - orange juice  strawberry  banana  mango... look I dont know what happened here but in theory it sounded like a sweet refreshing drink but turned out to taste very  healthy  LOL and other smoothies friends had also taste healthy and less sweet. just an FYI - still solid  but not my cup of tea  -al pastor  corn -  4.25  - GET - delicious and one of my favorites out of the 5. could appreciate a bit more pineapple and onion but it was bomb   -la reyna  flour -  4.25  - meh  I d skip this one. vegetarian which is a great option  but it was TOO much veggies even my boyfriend who loves healthy things said it was too much. comes with egg  mushroom  carrot  spinach  cilantro  onion  bell peppers  cheese  and avocado  -migas poblanas  corn -  4.25  - another vegetarian taco  but id recommend this over the la reyna  comes with egg  tortilla chips  peppers  onion  black beans  quest fresco  and avocado - this combination gave different flavors that went well together. I surprisingly enjoyed it.  -shrimp macha  flour -  5.25  - BOMB  but warning the salsa will have you sweating if you don t do well with heat. recommend  shrimp was cooked perfectly and was overall together great with the ingredients   -migas originales  corn -  3.75 . BOMB - must get. great  breakfast  type taco... but good for lunch dinner too. everything went really well together and is also vegetarian.... do it   PROS  -delicious food -BIG taco and drink serving sizes -loved the straws  agave.... no paper wilting  -had some chips and they had a very unique crispy texture -total vibe  decorations  different seating  lights  etc.   CONS  -long wait - I waited 30 minutes -the smoothies aren t your average sweet fruit smoothies... taste very  healthy   OVERALL  go here  you won t regret it 
Veracruz All Natural,46,THE BEST TACOS IN AUSTIN  I know I m no local  but I made it my mission while I was here for the weekend to eat all the tacos  and these were the BEST for sure - entire group agreed. All tacos were stuffed generously  seasoned to perfection  and fresh as hell. Super long line wait time  so make sure to order online or plan for a wait time. Extremely fresh ingredients too  But...BEWARE  hot sauce is SO hot.
Veracruz All Natural,47,Excellent food and great folks. Got here early on a Thursday morning with no line and quick service. Try the El Traditional for that Austin style breakfast taco that hits the spot.
Veracruz All Natural,48,Really enjoyed dinner here. Two corn tortilla tacos with vegan fillings. I was expecting the Furioso to be spicier but it was good. The chips and salsa was my favorite - the chips were thick and the salsa was really flavorful. The best was the hibiscus drink which I order everywhere I go. Sometimes at other places the hibiscus flavor is stale or it s too much ice and the drink is gone in two sips -- not this one   Not only is this one delicious  you get a giant cup of it     The order system and pick up went smoothly.  Sat at the picnic table under the tree. Super great.   Garbage and recycling bins available.  Dog friendly. There is a small station with dog waste bags and bin. So the place was very clean.
Veracruz All Natural,49,If 3.5 were an option that s what I would give it  It s tasty food with a long list to pick from  The service isn t super fast and it wasn t outstanding for tacos in Texas  The barbacoa was really good but left me feeling a bit sick. I got the vegan option with retried black beans  the mole chicken one  barbacoa  and grilled chicken  I liked the grilled chicken best  then barbacoa  then mole  then black beans because that one was too spicy to bear for me personally. It s a really cute atmosphere and tasty so I wouldn t not recommend it because it is a nice Austin experience but it is not the top of my list for food in Austin IMO.
Veracruz All Natural,50,Wonderful  with not tonnes of toppings  and you can actually taste the meat. My fav was al pastor  so juicy and delicious. They take cards and food came very quickly.
Veracruz All Natural,51,Good food and drinks and the ambience is nice as well. It s a nice spot  would recommend.
Veracruz All Natural,52,I m sure many have heard of Veracruz  one of Austin s most popular taco spots in town. They have a few locations around town and have a robust menu that is sure to satisfy all taste preferences   The taco here that surprised me most was their Shrimp Macha Taco. Macha is a nutty  smokey salsa and when paired with the butter  amp  garlic shrimp and avocado it makes for a great contrast of flavors    5.25   Another great one is their Grilled Steak Taco. What I like about it is that the beef has a lot of flavor  It s tender too.   4.25   The last one I ve tried is their Grilled Chicken Taco. There was nothing particularly different about it  but it still tasted good.   4.25   All in all  they re a great spot to visit and I give them a 4 5  I definitely suggest you try the shrimp macha taco.
Veracruz All Natural,53,The tacos are good but their fajita meat was overcooked. Took 25 mins to prepare our tacos. Still great environment to grab some tacos. Also  some of the pictures here are not accurate. They don t have anything other than tacos and juice.
Veracruz All Natural,54,SO GOOD  We are going to have to fight the urge to just come back here on our last day in town instead of trying the rest of the places I have marked.   The staff was very friendly and orders came out quickly. The free salsas are all great and the area is very cute. Lots of picnic tables for seating and easy street parking. We had never been before and asked her to help us pick a sampling of tacos and we re not disappointed at all.   The Migas poblano  el traditional  and fish were some of the favorites. Highly recommend you stop by 
Veracruz All Natural,55,Great Tacos...a step above  We would put these tacos up against any in the Austin area for quality and taste. Note  We went to the Windsor location for lunch. I ordered 4 different Tacos so my wife and I to give this eatery a holistic test. Each taco blew us away  I ordered the following  El differente Taco  veggie option   a Fish Taco  a Carnitas Taco and a Chicken Taco. All tacos were seasoned well with a generous amount of avocado and other fillings on each taco . The tortillas  corn and flour  were very good as well.  These tacos are made with very good ingredients and you won t remember you ate them a few hours later  if you know what I mean.  Fresh  Fresh  Fresh  ....so  run don t walk to this exemplary taqueria.
Veracruz All Natural,56,I had the grilled fish taco  the migas and the mango agua fresca and they were all really good  I would highly suggest the grilled fish taco  it was slightly salty for me but their agua fresca made up for it it was sweet but not too sweet and you could taste the fruit in it. The line was pretty long and the food took 20 min to make but the wait was worth it 
Veracruz All Natural,57,Best tacos we ever had . This place has great vibes and super great food. They also have a juice bar. There are 2 more trucks in that space . It was a great experience .
Veracruz All Natural,58,They re currently doing all their ordering online which makes it easy to order before you get there  or you can just scan the QR code and order when you get there. The migas breakfast taco is so yummy and filling  you really only need one  but definitely get the double tortilla   I crave their chips and guac  The chips are super crunchy and the guac is chunky which to me is the perfect pairing. Definitely worth getting as a side or even to take home and enjoy later.
Veracruz All Natural,59,Veracruz has the BEST taco in Austin... the migas. We ve tried a loooot of tacos here and that s the best. I don t even get anything else anymore. I don t love that they often have odd hours and at several locations you can t order in person. Most of the time the wait is extremely long too  especially for a small order of tacos... . That being said  if you order ahead online and then go pick up  it s worth the hassle.
Veracruz All Natural,60,I used to eat here all the time.    So many businesses not accepting cash.  It has been over two years since I quit eating here. I ve heard of many people  doing the same.  Makes no sense not to accept all forms of payment.
Veracruz All Natural,61,Amazing tacos - the best I ve had in Austin all weekend long. I could go here everyday and be happy. I got the migas and traditional with chorizo  yummmm. The green juice was great too 
Veracruz All Natural,62,It was ok. Not sure why you would need 30-35 minutes for three tacos when there is no line. Tried the barbacoa  al pastor and migas. The barbacoa was 8 10 so I would recommend. Tacos are small and expensive. The mango agua fresa was good. What made the trip was the empanada stand next door which I ll write a review for too lol
Veracruz All Natural,63,I ve been a customer of Veracruz for about 6 or 7 years and I m sad to say it s gotten very hit or miss in the past year specifically. The tacos are sometimes bland or missing ingredients. Today I waited 35 minutes for an order of chips and salsa. The salsa keeps getting more expensive but the container gets smaller and smaller.   I m very sorry to be leaving this review  and I hope to see them improve. This used to be one of my favorite spots.
Veracruz All Natural,64,The best breakfast tacos in town  I always get the El Sancho taco and it never disappoints  I could rave about it all day. I also just recently tried their watermelon agua fresca and it was so delicious  I ve been to multiple locations too and each one has a great ambiance and fantastic staff. I will always recommend this place to anyone who is visiting 
Veracruz All Natural,65,Omg. Yum. I ve heard a lot about this place and finally came and it lived up to the hype. We had to wait about 20 mins which was fine despite how cold and windy it was haha -- no Veracruz s fault. I ordered a migas and an el sancho and 100  will order them again. Go here
Veracruz All Natural,66,This is a great spot on a nice day.  The portions are very generous and priced well for what you get.  I had the grilled steak taco and was surprised by how jam-packed it was. Everything was seasoned well. Also ordered the salsa and loved the chunks of avocado in it. The tortilla chips are also next-level. They have heft and hold up well  not like those flimsy store-bought tortilla chips.   Veracruz definitely tops the list of tacos in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,67,Wow tried every taco all were amazing   Favorites were shrimp and pastor   This place is a must visit 
Veracruz All Natural,68,I ve been meaning to revisit Veracruz because I feel like I gave them an unfair shot last time. This time around  I loved it  Their tacos are delicious. I got the Al Pastor  Shrimp  and the two types of Migas. My favorite was the Migas Originales  The Al Pastor was also amazing - the pineapple really does it.   The only downside about this place is that the tacos took a whopping 45 minutes to come out because they were having issues with their ordering system  written during COVID times . They had us place our orders through their website even while we were at the physical location. The wait was insane so hopefully they fix this issue soon because I d love to come back here regularly 
Veracruz All Natural,69,What a great start of your day  You can get anything you might wish for breakfast in Austin. The amazing Veracruz breakfast tacos and some coffee from Fleet caf . Smoothies are also delicious. You should give this a try. If you are rushing  this might not be the ideal place for you  tacos are prepared fresh specially for you and take a little while to prepare  so be patient  it s worth it 
Veracruz All Natural,70,Bruh. Over AN HOUR wait for tacos and an horchata  which was way too sweet  Tacos were pretty good. But damn.   The system they have in place is absolutely ridiculous. We did not know they ONLY took online orders walking up.... We said  oh ok. no prob  lemme put that in right now . Email notification comes through saying  45 MINUTES until your order is ready . WHAT  as we laugh   can it be true  ....    YUP. Sure the fuck is. Beware of this. Hopefully this is eliminated soon  but no telling. Def going to order 3 weeks in advance if I ever go back.    Hey Veracruz  I d put several big ass SIGNS letting customers know it s only online ordering and HOW LONG it ll be  in big red lettering. This will prevent cancelations and refunds.
Veracruz All Natural,71,Stopped by today and got a couple of tacos and a quesadilla. Some of my favorite street tacos were from SoCal but these are by far the best tacos I ve ever had  Both of the sauces they give you to put on it were also very good  Definitely saving this spot for the future. Location was cute too
Veracruz All Natural,72,The quest was disgusting   It didn t taste anything like queso   I bought chips and salsa along with 4oz of flaun for  18   The flaun was good but the rest was so disappointing.  I know it s locally owned but ... never gain.
Veracruz All Natural,73,10 10 outdoor seating. I ve felt the safest eating out at this restaurant compared to any other. The Migas Originales taco was incredible  really enjoyed how thickly they cut the avocado slice bc some places can get skimpy w it. Not the best value of taco  granny s taco still got this place beat  but very delicious none-the-less. Had a bite of the shrimp taco and it was good too  kinda too spicy if you re weak like me.
Veracruz All Natural,74,Spent one weekend in Austin and I m pretty sure I made a point to go here every day. This will be my first stop on my next trip without a doubt. The shrimp one was my absolute favorite - has a really nice smoky element to it.  The hot sauces are also actually hot and flavorful as well - the perfect combo for a spice enthusiast. The juices have a lot of sugar in them though so watch out for that
Veracruz All Natural,75,A must in any Austin taco crawl  I would definitely try the flour tortillas here  they re thicker and have the perfect amount of chew to complement any filling. The Al Pastor taco has a unique spice blend that makes a traditional taco really interesting. Each piece of pork was fatty and rich  and the whole taco was packed with flavor  no salsa needed  Every ingredient in the Migas taco is incredibly soft. From the eggs to the flour tortilla  the entire taco is extremely fluffy and light.
Veracruz All Natural,76,Absolutely the best tacos in Austin. Agua Frescas at the east side location at so delicious I always get one. The vegan queso is SO good - great consistency  taste  and texture. I love this place and take everyone that visits me here 
Veracruz All Natural,77,Went after hearing its  Number 1 Tacos in Austin  title. Make sure to get their famous migas tacos. It is one of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had and lives up to the name. They don t do any crazy fusion tacos like other restaurants but perfect the traditional dish.  After ordering  they give you a buzzer which notifies you to pick up your order. Everything is made fresh so expect to wait 10-15 minutes for a small order.  A minor point- their smoothies are mediocre but I will let it slide because their tacos are superb.
Veracruz All Natural,78,Solid breakfast burrito  Order ahead of you can. Salsa is so friggin good. We got the classic with eggs  Bacon  potatoes  cheese. Tortillas were good. We ll be back. Next time we ll try the ones rec d by other Yelpers.
Veracruz All Natural,79,The best breakfast tacos we had during our short stay in Austin. A little pricey but worth it
Veracruz All Natural,80,Migas Migas Migas   Heard so much about this taco truck and I am damn glad I made the trek to the new location on a pretty drizzly Monday morning. But the rain was no bother when I got there  as the picnic area has plenty of umbrella covered spots. And  I mean...the tacos are worth the weather alone  So  with a Terry Black s visit planned later that day  I opted for the 2 tacos  the Migas Poblanas and the Fajita Steak.  Fajita Steak - served with cilantro  onion  queso fresco  and avocado.  I know it sounds simple  but it s perfectly-well excited  and when you slather it in some of their green sauce...glory.  Migas Poblanas - served with egg  tortilla chips  poblano peppers  red onion  queso fresco  black beans  and avocado - holy mother of god where has this been my whole life  While I was worried I m miss a meat-protein in the dish  wow...all the flavors just melded so well into pure bliss. And the tortilla chips add an amazing textural contrast...just so good. Winner winner.  Veracruz was easily the cheapest meal I had in Austin  but it was also easily one of the best meals I had in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,81,It was good but the chips could have been better but overall good I love the energy of the park
Veracruz All Natural,82,4 Stars for fabulous Migas breakfast tacos  but I d give the chips and guac a skip    We grabbed a Lyft from our hotel to find this gem we found on Yelp and we were not disappointed  It s a food truck that appears to be permanently parked in this location.   We went for a very late breakfast so we didn t experience a line or any wait to find a spot at a picnic table. Right away I appreciated the shaded picnic table area. That Texas sun can get verryyyy real  Just a word to the wise-- watch out for the birds  They re very curious  mostly about ways they can grab that taco while you go to get some salsa .  We started with the chips and guac. The chips were really nice and crispy- obviously made in-house  in-truck  . The one thing my partner and I both noticed is the lack of salt. Or any seasoning for that matter. Both the chips and the guacamole would have been really good with some salt.  As for the tacos  I couldn t complain about my very first experience with Migas tacos. It was filled with scrambled eggs  black beans  some avocado  tortilla chips  and queso fresco. Crunchy  flavorful  and a definite great start to my Migas taco journey around Austin.  I also got the al pastor taco  which was equally delicious. What sets it apart  of course  is the sweet surprise in every few bites. Love me some hidden pineapple   The one big bummer was that they didn t have any juices  aquas frescas  or smoothies available. Maybe they had a big rush before us and ran out  But they only had bottles of water or coke. Again  a bummer...  Overall  a great little detour for some great food.
Veracruz All Natural,83,This location is a food truck with a little patio carved out right off a Caesar Chavez. There is a parking lot out front but the paving isn t finished and there are huge potholes so be wary.  The breakfast tacos are definitely popular so expect a bit of a line even if it s early. I was a little confused at first as to why they needed a name and phone number at the time of payment but it s because they send you a text message when your food is ready  No more standing around the truck. It made for a way better experience when waiting in line to order and being able to sit and enjoy the patio while waiting for your food.  I had the migas originales breakfast tacos. I had a choice of corn or flour tortillas and when I asked the gentleman taking my order for his recommendation  he suggested flour so I went with that. Apparently they make their corn tortillas in house and the flour is locally sourced. I definitely recommend getting 2 at a minimum to feel full. We also had chips and guac to share for the table. The chips were thick and crunchy. Just perfect the guac. A good start to the morning 
Veracruz All Natural,84,Awesome breakfast tacos and great outdoor atmosphere makes this one of the better places in Austin to grab a taco. Always goo and they make their own tortillas. There is also a coffee truck there as well.
Veracruz All Natural,85,Came here with a friend for the first time on an early Saturday morning and it was just soooo relaxing. It almost feels like its own little pocket  like just sit and eat with your good company and everything will be alright lol. I like that the food trucks are surrounding the picnic tables and chairs that are in the middle  but with just enough distance so that it does not feel crowded. Because we went around 9 30am  we definitely beat the crowd and got a nice table right in front of Veracruz. I got their speciality taco  the  Migas Originales   an order of their chips and guac  and an  Agua Fresca  mango-flavored. All of it was super yummy and tasted low-key homemade  which I love. The only thing I don t like is that they are way overpriced. Parking might be a bit hard to find  but my friend and I scored a spot right in front of the place. Go  go  go if you haven t. It s a definite Austin-famous spot and rightfully overhyped.
Veracruz All Natural,86,MIGAS POBLANOS  5 5  all the way. Delicious in-house corn tortillas   MIGAS ORIGINALES  5 5  also delicious  although I did enjoy the MIGAS poblanos a bit more  FISH TACO  3.5 5  I got it with a flour tortilla based on another YELP recc which was spot on since the flour tortilla held up really well. Overall  it tasted very fresh but the tilapia didn t seem to fit. Maybe if it was mahi mahi or another neutral white fish it would ve been better   CHICKEN TACO  5 5  simple in the best ways. Flavorful  nice balance of salsas  not doing much. Tasty without being drowned in a lot of sauce  like they do at Tacodeli . Perfect on a corn tortilla.   Definitely prefer this spot over Taco Deli. The smaller menu at Veracruz allows them to do what they do really well.  NOTE  THEY WILL BE MOVING FROM THIS LOCATION TO ANOTHER ONE IN APRIL 2020 check their website for location details     a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.veracruzallnatural.com amp s 6d08505a04890d3d072370f0f798c3ff3355a2a121b701cce99ab233e140f497  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  veracruzallnatural.com  a 
Veracruz All Natural,87,The seating area around the food truck is really cute  The queso chips were pretty good too but the tacos are absolutely amazing.
Veracruz All Natural,88,If you are looking for great tacos for breakfast or lunch or dinner  look no further.  We came for breakfast in a Saturday morning. The lines are loooong and sitting is on benches outside. First  you need to order the food  you give them your cell number and you are called when it s time to pick up the food.  I had the poblanas and fish tacos. The fish was very tasty but a bit too salty. My daughter had tHe original for breakfast and I think it was a bit better than the poblanas. The chips and guacamole is very good too.
Veracruz All Natural,89,Love this place. Great options for vegetarians and vegans  beans can be without lard. Nice breakfast tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,90,Cauliflower taco Furioso is a must-try here   It is so good that you won t miss  tacos with meat  and their fish taco is really great too  There is a juice truck next to the taco truck which is very nice. They have great smoothies and juices as well.  Love the atmosphere here  It can be crowed on weekends though.
Veracruz All Natural,91,Top 3 taco spots in Austin. Great spot in Mueller park  family friendly  and quick lunch break. Grab yourself a taco and have a little picnic in the park. Tacos were flavorful and filling  An array of different options  something for everybody.
Veracruz All Natural,92,When I asked my native Texan friends what food spots to visit  many of them said I had to get some Veracruz tacos. Maybe my expectations were set too high  but I thought this place was decent but nothing amazing. Came on a Tuesday afternoon for a late lunch and there was practically no line.   Ordered the Migas Originales and La Reyna. Both of them were pretty good but I can t say this was one of my favorite spots during my visit to Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,93,Migas breakfast tacos are everything  This place definitely lives up to the hype and is one of my must visits in Austin. They have hot sauces out for you but make sure you get a little taste before putting it on the tacos. I remembered some being quite spicy while others weren t. The seating is outdoors and pretty busy but people seem to not hang out for too long.  I was on a food adventure so after eating breakfast at Veracruz  I walked over to grab BBQ five minutes down.
Veracruz All Natural,94,Amazing breakfast tacos.  It is a food truck but had good amount of parking.  Honesty all the options were good. Good service  good food.  Can t go wrong.
Veracruz All Natural,95,Came here for Texas breakfast tacos. Love the outdoor seating and you can only order online now so they have a QR code you can scan.  Chorizo and Eggs - very decadent and very tasty. The avocado salsa cuts through the fat well  Migas Originales - this was my favorite and I officially love breakfast tacos. Loved the crunch of the tortilla chips in the soft pillowing egg and homemade flour tortilla  Grilled chicken - very standard  very Tex mex  super spicy with the red salsa
Veracruz All Natural,96,Completely walked passed this walking to Radio coffee shop but I got it togo and forgot to take photos as I dug into them. I got their furioso  barbacoa and steak tacos. The barbacoa had the most flavors and very tender. I was delightfully surprised with the Furioso taco  vegetarian taco   Would get this again for sure. The steak tacos were good. Traditional but honestly may try something different next time. Would ask for extra hot sauce if you like things spicy as the containers are pretty small.
Veracruz All Natural,97,While visiting from the Bay Area of Northern California we had to stop at this place after hearing and reading about it.  Glad I did. Not only is it cute is appearance but they were all very friendly too. Their setup isn t like just a taco truck. They have a school but outfitted as their main truck and then side trucks for the butcher  I think  and a separate on also for the juice bar. How cool. They had beepers that told you when your food was ready also which was nice. They had plenty of seating and even a little deck with a tent on it with chairs under it. How cool. With napkin dispensers and sanitizer near by for cleanliness.   Now. For the food.  I got some micas tacos and pastor taco. To drink. Ahuja Fresca strawberry drink. All were great. Micas were awesome. Had a billion tacos in my life but these were unique. Pastor was good too. Had pineapple in it which makes it very tasty. Not the best pastor I ve ever had in my life as in Oakland California where I live  there s still a place that is my favorite all time. But. Pastor was still good. Veracruz has awesome homemade tortillas which were superior tho.   The micas taco was a very unique sort of breakfast taco and it was awesome. Comes with a Alvarado lime salsa  I think. It was soft and green and had those flavors  and a red more spicy and bold hot sauce. That s the one I preferred. That woth some lime squeezed. Wow. Lovely beautiful place with good food. And honestly. Pretty cheap too. Like 3.25 or something for each taco. These days if you find then 2  a price that s great and the atmosphere here and level of taco they made. Worth more than that i would say. They could easily charge 4  a taco and be fine. Anyways. I highly recommend.
Veracruz All Natural,98,A solid four star for my first lunch in Austin this time  9 22 2020 . We ordered three different kinds of tacos for two of us  which were just enough and so we would have enough space for another meal at night. Migas original and finish tacos were two of the three. They use fresh ingredients  cook them properly  serve the right away which push the taco to a formal dish  if you will. Their tacos are not what you d expect from a street food truck  I d love to come back here at my next visit to Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,99,Went here for lunch on a Friday. The tacos were pretty good but a little pricey. The Grilled Steak taco was very good with amazing flavor. The Al Pastor taco was just ok  I prefer more pineapple  there were maybe 1-2 pieces in the one taco . Overall  decent tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,100,Best tacos around if you ask me. The online ordering is pretty sweet on weekdays  and they seem to be doing fun events on weekends. I ve enjoys pretty much everything I ve had  although the smoothies could use a bit more flavor. Still  I can t complain  tacos are legit.
Veracruz All Natural,101,Awful wait. Even worse service. Don t bother for mediocre taco with dry beef and soggy chips...
Veracruz All Natural,102,Been here plenty  food is fine  but has steadily gone downhill in terms of service. Most recent visit resulted in a 50 minute wait for three bacon bean and cheese tacos that we never actually picked up because we were originally quoted a 20 minute wait time and had a spot to be. Tons of signs around this place that read  please be patient  we make fresh food  not fast food  but when there are 10 minute periods where nobody s order is put out on what seemed to be an average Monday lunch  you have to question if they re appropriately organizing themselves in the kitchen. There are plenty of places within 5 minutes of this spot that can be the same level of busy and deliver food on par with this spot  but with 7-10 minutes of waiting at most.
Veracruz All Natural,103,Our group of friends were visiting Austin and heard this place was one of the best for Breakfast Tacos. We went near 11am  so it was the peak of sun hours. Unfortunately Veracruz is a food truck with a few picnic tables and some umbrella overhead covers so we were baking under the sun while in line.   Menus are on the right hand side of the small order window hole  where you tell the cashier what you want and then they will give you a buzzer for your drinks  and will text you when your food is ready for pick up at the window on the far right hand side. The sauces and utensils are also on the far right hand side.  Migas Originales   3.50   Really great flavors going on here  and I love the texture difference with the tortilla chips. The sauce that s used with this taco is delicious     Fish Taco   3.75   When I saw this was Grilled Tilapia  I was hesitant as I m used to battered fish. However  the flavor on this fish was super good. Definitely don t sleep on this. I got this with a corn tortilla as most fish tacos I ve had are on corn tortillas  but I think I would ve wanted it on flour instead.   Berry Strong Smoothie  16oz -  5.00   First taste - all peanut butter. Definitely didn t taste much of any of the other fruits. I tried Pink Panther from my friends and I liked that better. Still refreshing regardless.  Strawberry Agua Fresca  32oz -  4.00   This was absolutely worth the price  I loved the strawberry flavor but some of my friends that got other flavors like watermelon...too many seeds.
Veracruz All Natural,104,Great tacos  hit the spot. Not much more to say - def recommend and the habanero salsa is amazing.
Veracruz All Natural,105,Although it s been a long time since I visited  this place absolutely deserves a 5 star review from me- and that I feel compelled to 2 years later should tell you something  I went here to recover from my birthday party in 2018 and while the tacos were delicious  I m still dreaming about that mango agua fresca.
Veracruz All Natural,106,Tacos are delicious  I got a chorizo  amp  egg taco plus a migas poblanas taco  the migas taco definitely surpassed my expectations. The corn tortilla was OK on each of them  I would probably do flour next time for more texture. My only  complaint  would be the service  the girl who took our order was a bit short and didn t seem very helpful. I ordered a cantaloupe water and was not instructed that I had to pick it up on the trailer beside it. Also noticed some confusion for people picking up online orders but I think they were slammed during that Sunday morning.
Veracruz All Natural,107,I did not think the tacos here were that great. Nothing worth waiting for in the heat.  Ordered a Migas Originales and an Al Pastor taco. I felt like both tacos lacked flavor and nothing stood out.
Veracruz All Natural,108,Okay so since I can t find the right location this is a rating for the truck at Radio coffee and the location at the Line Hotel downtown Okay let me start by saying I always felt the north location  that is now closed  had the best flavor. Why  I don t know. But when I had their vegetarian tacos  no cheese  last year it blew my mind. Wonderful bean  to spice ratio. Wasn t over the top oily and it had plenty of salt  but not high blood pressure kind ... So then I had their green salsa and quac and was sold even more.  Go to now.. I have had both locations and no salt  too much oil and honestly no flavor. I am so sad too because I really wanted to love this place. Now the quac is still good  but their chips are too oily too and hurts my stomach.   I think for many that eat meat this place is great or maybe some people find things they love better than I  I am not saying don t try this place  I am just saying my perspective is that if your eating a taco the oil shouldn t be the thing you taste the most  even with hot sauce on it . The customer service is still great.. unless they are super busy at Radio and you can tell they are like.. don t ask questions.. just order online and go please lol.. The Line Hotel has been a wonderful customer service experience 100  of the time for me. Please remember to wear your mask and order online ahead of time. They both get packed and normally takes about 45 min to fill an order. So save your self some time and just show up when the email says so   .
Veracruz All Natural,109,Ordered tacos  quesadilla and guacamole to go. Everything was packed poorly and sour cream that was advertised on the menu wasn t added.   Also  the fly on the picture speaks for itself. We almost ate it. Fortunately we weren t very eager with the guacamole.
Veracruz All Natural,110,Last year  after spending a month in Mexico  I went to another Veracruz location and had the best tacos I ve ever had. Of course I had to come back--and folks  they ve done it again. Had a potato and cheese  fish and al pastor. All phenomenal. Just out of this world. The balance and explosion of flavors is just to die for. Sauces are simply the best. Plus the outside eating area here is super huge and cute. I also got a yummy Orange juice. If you re in Austin  GO. P
Veracruz All Natural,111,Awesome tacos and drinks  which in itself would make it 4-5 stars. But... They are doing away with online ordering  So now you have to wait in a long line then wait for food after that. People take awhile to review the menu when they get to the front of the line  then order  which is sooo inefficient. Unfortunately  this makes it way too tedious for us. We live in the neighborhood and loved VC being our incredible local taco truck. But having to go back to very long lines is in effect excluding local customers who are busy or have small kids to instead focus on tourists. Ouch
Veracruz All Natural,112,This food truck is a  so cute b  SO TASTY.   We came on a Saturday morning after spending way too long looking at lists of the best breakfast tacos in Austin and these clearly made the list for a reason.   There was a pretty consistent line  but not too long  the whole time we were there  but they were pretty quick and we got our food within  10 minutes. I got 1 La Reyna and 1 Migas Poblanas and they were both GREAT. Their salsas definitely add a little kick too so I d add them.   Seating options are some picnic tables so if it rains it might get a bit wet  they just have light umbrellas   but honestly I d still try to come because these were the best brekky tacos I had during my trip 
Veracruz All Natural,113,MIGAS AND AGUA FRESCAS.  After a kinda disappointing meal at the very hyped la BBQ down the street  we stopped by Veracruz for a 2nd lunch to satisfy our tummies. Boy were we glad that this also very hyped place hit the mark for us  Coming from SoCal  I do call myself a taco expert so that s saying a lot   We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and waited around 40 minutes until we ordered at the small trailer. The whole time in line  we debated leaving because it didn t seem like these tacos would be that delish. But sooo glad we waited it out   Migas Originales was by far the favorite at our table. Filled with egg  tortilla chips  monterey jack cheese  cilantro  tomato  onion  avocado  this was savory  tangy  and fresh. This pretty hefty taco was filling  I slathered on some of the salsa and was in a perfect foodie heaven.  I also tried the La Reyna and a Bfast taco with Sausage and Potato  but both of those didn t really stand out. Sure they tasted good but were easily overshadowed by the Migas.  We also got the Mango Agua Fresca and were shocked by how delicious it was  It was the perfect refreshing pick-me-up we needed on a warm day of lots of walking. You can literally taste how fresh it is with the mango pulp. It was so good that we came back 2 days to get another one   Tacos here are a bit more than I expected to pay  but for these made-to-order delicious tacos  I m very willing to shell out  4 for these. ILYSM Veracruz 
Veracruz All Natural,114,The breakfast tacos here are delicious. I especially love the migas tacos. I ventured outside of it  la reyna   and was wondering why didn t I just get more migas tacos. I like my taco tortillas double layered a bit more  but this was good still.  I loved how simple it was and the tortilla chips in the migas tacos. Felt light  simple  and focusing on the limited ingredients. It s not super complicated  but it sure as hell is delicious.  The agua Fresca was also great  and huge  . I would recommend getting one for every two people.
Veracruz All Natural,115,All the tacos I had in Austin were good  but Veracruz was super good. Well  I ve tried a few of the tacos but I think the breakfast tacos are the best ones. I prefer the Migas Originales and Migas Poblanas to the La Reyna. Each taco has a perfect mix of flavor and texture  from the tortilla chips . The cold avocado goes perfect on top of the other warm ingredients.   The Agua Frescas are LARGE and great on a hot day. I really enjoyed the watermelon one. I tried mango too and wasn t as good.
Veracruz All Natural,116,Oh come on  Our first time at this  over  hyped place.  You re supposed to get a text you when your foods ready  but after an hour and 10 minutes still no text. We went up to ask and they told us it was made already. Huh   Tacos were fine but no taco is worth over an hours wait. I like taco deli and it took 5 minutes. Over rated.
Veracruz All Natural,117,Not only one of the best things we ate in Austin  the best breakfast taco I ve ever had  Wow  Cannot say enough about how good Veracruz is. If we lived here  I would so come here everyday for breakfast  Migas Poblanos was our go to. Also had a chorizo taco which was spicy and delicious but the Migas was our fav by far  When I think of the Migas Poblanos I think of fresh  fresh  fresh  From the fresh made corn tortillas  to the fresh chips in the eggs  to the fresh avocado and fresh salsa s.  I can t forget their Aguas Frescas  Love  love  love Aquas Frescas  In fact over the course of a few days  and in the best interest of science  I took it upon myself to sample all of their flavors. For the record they were all excellent with my favs being the watermelon and cucumber. They do have other tacos here that unfortunately we didn t get to try because we were too busy eating their breakfast tacos. We would so come back to Austin just to eat these breakfast tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,118,Poblano Migas Taco was amazing and the salsas are great  Go on the weekends for a cool flea market as well.
Veracruz All Natural,119,Looking for some bomb tacos this is the place  Probably the best fish taco I ve ever had  Also tried the vegans cauliflower taco and pastor also were solid tacos. The salsa is packed with flavor. It has outside seating so you can even bring your dog along.
Veracruz All Natural,120,A taco truck in a parking lot shared by Kerlin s and pretty much nothing else  I arrived to find a line on a late Friday afternoon. Good signs  usually. Waited in the furnace of heat from the Austin sun to put my order in for three tacos and a mango juice.   I got my Al pastor  fajita chicken  and fish tacos after a reasonable wait considering the crowd. Overall very interesting flavor descriptions but the execution just fell flat. The expectation is built up with the list of ingredients  but the flavor combination just feels like it s missing something that would pull it together better. Side note  the meat could ve been drained a little better to parent a soggy taco.  Juice was refreshing.
Veracruz All Natural,121,When I got there I wasn t wearing a mask because it was outside  but instead of kindly asking me to put on a mask  the lady abruptly said  We can t serve you without wearing a mask  order online.  As I turned to put my mask on she already left the window and I had to wait for someone else to take my order. I entered my phone number for them to contact me when my food was ready  but I noticed everyone that was after me in line getting their food  so I go up and ask for my order. It was ready several minutes ago  but they never texted me. I double checked the number on the receipt and it was right  so I was bummed I didn t get the text  As a result  my tacos were not hot and fresh  so I didn t get the hype of this place. Bummer.   
Veracruz All Natural,122,Enjoyed and would come back again  Love the food and scenery here   Definitely recommend to friends and family 
Veracruz All Natural,123,First breakfast tacos I had since I moved from San Antonio. I ve always heard SA tacos were better but damn ... they got nothing on Veracruz tacos. Amazing flavor and portions  will not disappoint
Veracruz All Natural,124,For many years this was one of my favorite taco places. I have been to most of their locations  but my favorite used to be the location adjacent to Radio Coffee. The food is good  but it s a nightmare to get your order and then if it s incorrect you have to wait in a long line behind others putting in their order and then wait another 40 minutes to get the corrected item s . That means others in your party are long done eating. It s just not an enjoyable experience anymore at Vera Cruz. They used to be efficient  had friendly face to face interactions with their customers  but now they keep an iPad on the counter so you walk up and self order. Due to this change  I just order before leaving my home which is twenty minutes away and still the wait upon arrival was another thirty minutes  then on my last visit was when my order was wrong. The one visible employee tucked back to the side behind the counter  the same one who had just given me the corrected taco became too busy prepping to go orders and refused to pause for a second to give me napkins. He literally told me he was too busy and I would just have to wait. So after five minutes waiting in front of him  I gave up. Vera Cruz has absolutely lost ALL touch with their clientele.
Veracruz All Natural,125,There is nothing like living outside of Texas to make a girl miss a good breakfast taco. And Veracruz definitely satisfied that craving--so much yum  I first tried a Veracruz breakfast taco  bacon egg cheese avocado  when I was staying at the LINE hotel downtown. I loved it so much that I had  multiple of  the same thing for lunch at the Mueller farmer s market literally the next day. Now that I m back in Texas and living in the Mueller area  I know that I ll be a regular 
Veracruz All Natural,126,Cool location they have their own food truck courtyard with lots of tables.  Their migas tacos are the best don t bother getting anything else. We got the traditional but the beans and potatoes weren t very well seasoned.  The chips are made with their had made corn tortillas but a little thick when made into chips but guacamole was awesome. Great food and atmosphere but migas tacos are the winner here.
Veracruz All Natural,127,I am almost positive Veracruz uses A LOT of MSG in their egg seasoning. I ve got a keen tongue for that  and knowing the Mexican meat markets I frequent in Kansas City that showed me how they make arranchera  the MSG in their meat matches the sodium profile exactly to the migas I had at Veracruz. If you don t mind premature cell degradation  then their migas are wildly flavorful  clean  and well made wonderful tacos.   The chips in the Migas especially were such a welcomed  novel addition. With such flavor and texture  I really liked their migas - but I don t think I d ever return  at  4.10 each  they re absolutely NOT a good value - quite the contrary to what a taco is  especially when coming out of a broke-down school bus in a gravel parking lot. I don t care how many umbrellas you put up - your tacos are not worth almost  5 a piece - even with all that Avocado. And with no meat  Nope.  One of Food Network s best tacos in America  Well  I ll stop considering the Food Network an authority after that.
Veracruz All Natural,128,The migas originales is absolutely delicious with freshly fried crispy tortilla chips in it. The chips are home made and the green and habanero salsa are delicious.  They forgot my order even though I was the only customer there and they kept mispronouncing my name  first time being called  Jova   so minus 1 star.
Veracruz All Natural,129,Came here on they recommendation of a friend who ate here last time in Austin. We came here after a hike so rest assured  my friends and I were really hungry here. We came around 1pm and there was quite a line to order   I wasn t bothered really because that just means it must be worth it  . You go up to the window  order  amp  pay  then get a number and wait around until your order is ready at the next window.   Steak fajitas taco - simple  good and tasty  Fish taco - I m a sucker for a fish taco  fish was fresh and tasty and the slaw it came with added a nice crunch  Al pastor taco - the best of the bunch  kinda greasy but oh so much flavor  I also recommend getting both types of hot sauces they offer  they really add a nice heat to the tacos ...  TLDR  very very good authentic tacos in Austin and I would 100  come back
Veracruz All Natural,130,We went on a mission to the Veracruz food truck after a friend recommended this spot  and my only regret is that I didn t get two migas tacos. I thought I would just customize my other taco. No  just get the migas taco. Or two. Or three. And get some chips and guac to snack on while you wait for your tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,131,I walked miles to get here  We came for the breakfast tacos and I fell in love with the regular lunchtime tacos.  It s a short and simple menu with a couple of different breakfast taco options and a few lunch taco options.    I was with a large group and each person s food came out pretty quickly. Everyone else was equally as pleased with their tacos  breakfast and regular. If you re in the area I highly recommend this place.  Try a breakfast taco but think you ll be very happy with the lunch dinner tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,132,DELICIOUS  I m not kidding when I say this is hands down the best tasting breakfast tacos I ve EVER had in my life  I ve tried the el sancho  El tradicion  and migas problamos  If you ve never been or curious to try it out  this is your sign to check it out  You won t regret it Migas PoblanasChorizo and Eggs
Veracruz All Natural,133,My favorite breakfast taco place  Their migas has good seasoning  a nice crunch from the tortilla chips  juicy  and fresh. I kept thinking about it and wishing I had gotten more than just one migas  also wishing that we didn t only just go once during our trip  cry  
Veracruz All Natural,134,Best migas tacos in Austin and some of the best tacos period. Enough said   Just watch out for the line. It s outrageous. If there s more than 10 people in line  just forget about it and leave. Once you get to the counter  it ll be another 40 min to get your food.   Pro tip  they open super late so come for dinner instead. Don t bother on a nice weekend morning brunch lunch
Veracruz All Natural,135,This is an absolute delight. Fresh ingredients and freshly prepared  great out door seating. Great way to start the day with a breakfast taco   
Veracruz All Natural,136,If I could only choose to eat one dish in Austin  it would be the migas originales taco from Veracruz. I don t care if it s 100 degrees outside  I will sweat it out for migas. Their green and orange sauces are also fuego  literally  hot and delicious.  I usually like to start the table off with some chips and guac. You can ignore the salsa since you can just get some salsa from the table. Then I ll usually get 1 or 2 migas originales tacos and another meat taco - I prefer the al pastor over the chicken mole  but I might just start only getting migas from now on. I have also tried la reyna  but that one tastes a tad too  healthy  for me. I m a corn tortilla gal  so I love their house made tortillas  Their quesadilla was also delish.  Make sure to order your agua fresca early too or else you might have to wait long. Sometimes it doesn t come until all of your food is out since it has a  separate line.  Orange and watermelon flavors have been good. Mango was not good last time - I think because they were pretty much out of fruit at the time.  If it s hot outside  you might wanna bring an umbrella to block the sun. The line can be brutal but it s worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,137,Overall  amazing meal. My only complaint is their hours. We had to drive 30 minutes there and back to get the food because this was the only location that was open. The food was mostly warm by the time we got back  but it wasn t super convenient since there s one closer to us and it took us so long the worker was calling asking where we were.  The chips are super thick and filling. The Al Pastor quesadillas are what have me on an Al Pastor kick right now because they re amazing. Flavorful  tender  and delicious.   I also reached out to who ate with me to ask their opinion and here s the review  Vera Cruz - I would literally die to keep this place in business. The best tacos I ve had in Texas  hands down. The al pastor was marinated perfectly. It reminded me of tacos I used to have from my friend who caters Mexican food for a living.  And then  because we were talking about it  he ordered it again. That speaks for itself 
Veracruz All Natural,138,Wow  this was my favorite meal in Austin. This was a permanent food truck location with picnic tables for seating  and our group was lucky enough to snag an unoccupied table. I took pictures of the menu to share with the group chat  so people securing our seating area could order while the other half of the group waited in the long line.    I shared chips  amp  guacamole with the group  and we all loved the guacamole. It was seasoned to perfection with fresh ingredients. The chips were crunchy but didn t hurt. The salsa was readily available to add to tacos in a little sauce bar. It had small bits of avocado in there too  The hot sauce was amazing and also located at the sauce bar along with utensils  napkins  and small containers for whatever sauces to bring back to the table to-go.   Even though it was breakfast  I ordered an al pastor taco  pork marinated with pineapple and spices  cilantro  onion  grilled pineapple  and fajita steak taco  with cilantro  onion  queso fresco  and avocado . Those tacos were deleted fairly quickly despite coming out fresh  hot  and steamy  I still think about the tacos and the hot sauce  and I wish we had food items like this more available in my area.
Veracruz All Natural,139,First time here  and last. I can not do bad customer service.  Came in to place a border  which clearly was an inconvenience to staff from the stern looks and eye rolls I received. I asked a question about if the full menus is available or breakfast only which lead to more annoyed looks and eye rolls and snappy responses. I proceed to place a order which included a smoothie. Another representative who was a little less irked responded   ma am we aren t doing smoothies.  This was not one of the items on the menu board marked  not available . If I were not short or time I would have moved on but it definitely will not recommend or revisit.
Veracruz All Natural,140,Ate here while on a trip to the area a while back. I keep thinking about how good the breakfast tacos and agua fresca were. I want more   Popular place. When we got there the line was only about 15 people but by the time we left it was closer to 40 or more. Worth the wait  though.
Veracruz All Natural,141,Came here for lunch a few Sundays ago when the bf and I were in town. It was fairly busy when we got there  but the turnaround is relatively quick  and we were able to secure seating by the time we had ordered and gotten our food. I opted for one of their migas poblanas and of their la reyna tacos. The bf got one of their fajita chicken and one of their al pastor tacos. There was a bit of a wait  but there is a pager system where you ll get a text message when your food is ready  and things are churned out quickly enough. As for the tacos  we both thought they were quite good  and I would say that the tacos I had here were arguably the best breakfast tacos I had during my trip. The hot sauces salsas they had on the side were great  also. Would definitely come back here or to one of their other locations if I happened to be in Austin again.
Veracruz All Natural,142,I used to really love their tacos but I think several places in Austin make better ones.  2 tacos with chips  salsa and guac will run you  30.   That s more than you will pay at most brick and mortar taco shops.
Veracruz All Natural,143,While visiting Austin from New York  my fianc  and I made an agreement to avoid eating at the same place more than once - we wanted to try as much as we could during our weekend trip.   After trying Veracruz for breakfast  we knew we would be back the next day...   We stopped by on a Sunday and Monday morning. While Sunday was a bit more crowded   9am   we didn t wait too long for the food. While we waited  we shared a Do a smoothie  a blend of orange juice and mango. It was really delicious  sweet  tangy  and refreshing. We ordered it both times.   The most impressive menu item is probably the Migas breakfast tacos. A corn tortilla is a must - each one is handmade and stuffed with scrambled eggs  tortilla crisps  onions  avocado  and more. I personally enjoyed the Migas Poblanos more. It has roasted poblano peppers and black beans in addition to all that other good stuff in the Migas.   They usually have the full menu available at any time of day. We tried the steak  chicken  and fish tacos all at 9am  so much to eat  so little time   and everything was excellent.   The service is on the slower side  but while waiting  you can load up on sauces and salsas from the cooler nearby. I loved their green sauce and spicy salsa. Thanks Veracruz for the great Austin experience 
Veracruz All Natural,144,Best tacos in round rock  Love their agua frescas    I went there when I worked closed by  but still go there after the pandemic 
Veracruz All Natural,145,My favorite Tacos of Texas. I ve been many times in the rain - it s that good. This specific branch is the taco truck site. I recommend the Migas tacos  fish tacos  or... just any taco.   There s some picnic tables in their closed in area and they re adjacent to a lot. It s a bit gravelly but you won t have trouble finding a spot to either pick up or eat there.
Veracruz All Natural,146,We ordered the Al Pastor and the Fajita Steak. Both were yummy  but the Fajita Steak was my favorite    There was a line when we arrived but it was pretty quick. It was raining but they do have umbrellas over their tables which helped.   Overall  great place to stop on our road trip 
Veracruz All Natural,147,Came here hung over in the morning not hungry but i was soo glad i did. It doesnt really look like much just a trailer with some tables but the wow the food is amazing. Also a good sign that there was a line when we rolled up around noon on the sunday. Got the migas taco  steak  and bacon and egg. My favorites were the migas and steak. The steak is so juicy soft and flavor ful and the migas taco as someone from SF is nothing like ive had before but sooo good. A must with all the tacos are the salsas  try them all cause they all have something great about them. During my visit ate plenty of breakfast tacos and this place is one of the best that i will definitely come back to 
Veracruz All Natural,148,So  so good. I truly wish we had a place like this back home. Everything we had here was exceptional  we got a whole variety of tacos  as well as some of the agua fresca. Definitely a wait to get your food and drinks  but it s worth it. A pleasant outdoor environment  too 
Veracruz All Natural,149,Amazing food  peculiar location and set up... the chicken tacos are AMAZING.  I also ordered the la bomba juice which took time to make  now I understand. It was refreshing. My table of 7 all ordered a variety and had zero complaints. We found this place via buzzfeed. I m so happy and full.
Veracruz All Natural,150,Veracruz was recommended by many of our friends so had to give it a try. We first tried to go to Franklin s bbq but the line was outrageous so we went to Veracruz. This was around 1 30 so figured the line wouldn t be too bad.. wrong. We were about 10th in line and a lot had sold out by that point. We ended up getting a Migas poblano  chicken mole and al pastor. The highlight for me were the salsas. They were absolutely divine. The hot salsa had a kick but soo flavorful and packed with heat. The corn tortillas on the tacos were delicious and filling as each had two tortillas per taco. I would definitely go again but if there was a lot sold out  It wouldn t be worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,151,This was also on our must-eat list in Austin and was kinda disappointed.  When we came  there was probably 7-8 people ahead of us but we still waited about 40-50 minutes.  It looks like they make everything fresh to order  which is nice  but for a food truck  they may need more employees as there were people who left because the wait was too long.  We got the breakfast tacos with eggs  potatoes and sausage  a steak fajita taco  chips and guacamole and salsa and a watermelon fresca. -Breakfast tacos with corn tortilla  very filling  eat bite  things would fall out.  The tortilla was very weak and flimsy  probably need 2.  Flavor though  was very good. -Steak fajita taco with flour tortilla  the flour tortilla was way better.  The steak was ok  a little chewy but flavor was also there.  Not as filling as the breakfast tacos but still pretty filling. -chips with guacamole salsa  chips was very good  you can tell it is freshly made.  The guacamole and salsa was standard. -watermelon fresca - probably one of my favorite thing on the menu.  Very big  two people can probably share one.  It is fresh and refreshing for a hot day.  Price wise  I thought it was pretty reasonable except for the chips and guacamole salsa.  For chips and guacamole  it was  5  and to add the salsa  it s an extra  2.  However  you can order chips and salsa for just  3  and they even have salsa at the condiment table that you can grab for free...so I wasn t sure why they did that.  Otherwise  I thought everything was good  just nothing spectacular. The wait is usually 20-30 minutes after you order before you get your tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,152,We had to wait in line for about 30min and the line kept getting longer after us. We had the fish taco a chicken torta and the migas originales. The fish taco with corn tortilla fell apart  but the fish was actually really good. The chicken torta was ok my bf rlly liked it. The migas was just not memorable for me. It was just like another breakfast taco so i don t get the hype over that. Everything was just average and i wouldn t come back to try anything else
Veracruz All Natural,153,Best breakfast tacos in Austin  Migas are a must. I personally like the migas poblana best but most people prefer the original.
Veracruz All Natural,154,I moved into this neighborhood so I couldn t wait to make Veracruz my regular taco spot. But every time I tried to go  there was a line to even order- which means like an hour wait.  I finally went on. Monday at about noon when there were only 3 people in front of me in line. My order still took about 35 minutes to come out. They make their food fresh and seem pretty efficient with a dedicated person taking orders  another one calling names and expediting.  The food itself is still great  Got my usual migas and fish tacos but also tried the La Reyna breakfast taco and they were all delicious as before.  I m not always in the mood to wait 40  minutes but when I am  I ll be back 
Veracruz All Natural,155,BOMB ASS TACOS.  2 tacos  with a lot of different flavors. This food truck gets a lot of foot traffic from nearby construction workers so sometimes there will be line. Cheap  delicious tacos. You can t beat that 
Veracruz All Natural,156,We were visiting Austin for the first time and craving breakfast tacos. This place was suggested to us and I m so glad we went. I myself had the two different Migas tacos and chicken mole taco. The Migas tacos were super tasty. Lives up to the hype. Chicken mole was pretty good as well. Each taco is decent sized and about 2 - 3 would fill me up. This place was packed when we went NYE morning and finding a table can be hard.
Veracruz All Natural,157,Got delicious breakfast tacos. You have to order online  no walk ups. I also got the el pastor taco which isn t technically a breakfast one but it was delicious. Great little seating area outdoors too.
Veracruz All Natural,158,The breakfast taco  the steak  and the shrimp taco were amongst the best I ve ever had  They all had robust flavors and tasted as they were composed of fresh ingredients.  Next time I m in Austin I will definitely give this spot another visit - 5 stars   
Veracruz All Natural,159,I came in with high hopes but was disappointed in a couple ways. For starters  this seems to be consistently packed and since it s outdoors the seating is limited. I will say though their service seems quick but they don t tend to the condiment table often enough. They also didn t have their drinks  limes  or the salsa they serve with their chips  which they don t give refills for cause they re homemade . For  3 the fajita steak taco was good  coulda went without the one slice of avocado they throw on there  but the Al pastor was what threw me off. The consistency was mushy  amp  although I firmly believe pineapple elevates an Al pastor taco  I think that s what made the meat too soft  amp  wet  I couldn t finish it cause it was so off putting .   As a Mexican Houstonian  I was hoping for more but I guess this wasn t the spot to expect above average from. I really wanted to enjoy the experience cause they felt authentic  but looking at their dominant customer base  I m not surprised their food seemed to be dull in flavor and spice. I also wasn t too wild for the salsa - which can sometimes be a teller as to how much a chef cares for their food cause a good salsa can really elevate a taco.   All in all  I wish it coulda gone better but I m grateful it was easy to find and a decent hot meal at the moment.
Veracruz All Natural,160,Tasty tacos  quite unique flavor also.  First of all the homemade corn tortillas were great IMO  they re a bit moister than I m used to but slightly thicker.  If you re looking for a  neater  taco that you can hold then i d rec the flour tortilla  but my money is on the corn.  Tacos tried   Migas - 5 stars Migas Poblanas - 4 stars Fajita beef taco - 5 stars Fish taco - 4 stars chorizo egg taco - 4 stars  All the tacos we tried were great and the salsas they create compliment them very well.  The orange sauce was pretty hot  my favorite.  We also had chips and guac along with their salsa  can t go wrong.  Only bummer was the line  but thats just a sign of a good establishment.  The people that work here were all very nice.  Would I wait an hour again  hmm maybe not  but I d wait 20 mins for sure.
Veracruz All Natural,161,If you re going to get THE breakfast taco of all time then you have to stop by here.  I was recommended to go here by a couple of locals and even though I had to stand in line under the blazing hot sun for what felt like hours   realistically it was like 50 min  sweating enough to fill a kiddie pool  I still can say it was worth it.   1. You have to get the Migas Taco 2. You have to get the Agua Fresca  Watermelon or Mango   The Migas Taco here were incomparable to other migas tacos I had around the area. They just do it better here. If I could go back  I would have ordered 5 of these. Instead I got one of their fish tacos and though it was delicious  still preferred their migas taco. Nothing was soggy  everything was full of flavor  and their corn tortilla was perfect   As for their Agua frescas  you ll want a large one all to yourself to combat the heat. I m not from Texas  so heat is not a concept I m familiar with  I don t deal with heat too well  and their agua fresca was the only thing keeping my body sane.   Seating is all open patio seating and most of the tables are covered with umbrellas but definitely lay on the sunscreen during the day. There isn t too much seating available but the because there s usually a wait  the tables rotate out pretty quick.   If I m dreaming of Austin  I m dreaming of this place and their tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,162,Migos is what it s all about. Apparently  breakfast tacos are the IN-thing in Austin. Awesome because I love a simple egg  avocado  cheese wrapped up for a big bite.  Food trucks are also a thing in L.A. but not like Austin. I really like how you ll randomly find a parking lot shared with a few food trucks. I think that s part of what makes Austin so great to visit. In a white converted school bus is Veracruz. And in it are hard working ladies. Order at one window and pick up at the other. Picnic benches for seating.  When I saw that watermelon juice was an option  I had to have it  and in a large  please  So refreshing and delicious  not too sweet for a warm day. The migos taco was perfect  I really wanted to get another one  but we had other spots to eat at. I d love to come back here when we plan another Austin trip in the future.
Veracruz All Natural,163,Veracruz All Natural has solid migas and a great atmosphere.   This Veracruz is tucked in a nook next to a bbq joint. The parking lot was pretty full when we visited so we had to go on a side street.   There s some seating and we didn t have too much of a problem finding a seat  although we did share a table with another party.   The aquas frescas was really refreshing  We had the migas too which were very good and the steak quesadilla was another great pick.   Veracruz has a cozy  clean atmosphere and good food 
Veracruz All Natural,164,One of the strangest things I discovered about food trucks in Texas don t actually move around to different locations. Unlike those in Los Angeles  food trucks in Austin stay parked in the same location- strange  but convenient.   Before coming to Austin  I heard good things about the Tex-Mex food here and especially great things about Veracruz. My friends and I headed here for lunch on a Monday and luckily didn t run into a huge line. Veracruz offers a variety of tacos  quesadillas  and drinks- making it enjoyably difficult to decide on what to eat.   After having an internal argument between my brain and stomach  I decided to limit myself to ordering 3 tacos  migas breakfast taco  al pastor taco   amp  fish taco. I also ordered a watermelon  sandia  agua fresca.   Of the tacos I had  I would highly recommend the migas and fish  but pass on the al pastor. The al pastor was too fatty and oily for me. The migas taco was flavorful and I loved how the tortilla chips were still crispy. The fish taco had a generous amount of grilled fish and was refreshing to eat. The watermelon agua fresca was the perfect drink to wash it all down.
Veracruz All Natural,165,Okay I know everyone raves about their tacos--don t get me wrong  they re freakin  bombdotcom BUT honestly let s talk about the salsa. You can order a portion with chips OR scoop some in side containers  although they re tiny af which I don t blame them for . Their salsa and sauces  along with everything else on their menu from corn chips to tortillas are homemade. Not only is their salsa so yum but it s got fresh a v o c a d o chunks in it. I m hyping it  it s worth it though just try it you ll get it. If you re a spicy fanatic like me you ll love their homemade hot sauce  and if you re lame and plane jane mild you ve gotta try the green sauce  jk you re so not lame--do you boo boo     All the above on top of the tacos  along with the homemade authentic everything this literally trailer has to offer just makes it one of a kind  We went twice in one weekend--migas and steak fajita is the way to go
Veracruz All Natural,166,Amazing -- our favorite breakfast taco spot in our week in Austin. First visit  we got two migas tacos  two al pastor  and one migas poblana  plus chips and guac  a berry good smoothie  and a mango tango. The migas tacos were basically perfect  some of my favorites I can remember eating anywhere. The chips and guac were very good. We also liked both smoothies  with a slight preference for the berry good  but I wouldn t say either are musts next time around.  We loved the migas so much we ended up coming back at the end of our trip and getting four of them  plus chips and guac .  Needless to say  the migas are amazing  and I ll be thinking about these until next time we re in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,167,These tacos were awesome. We tried a few places in Austin while we were in town and these were easily the best. From the quality of the meat to the sauces  we couldn t have asked for a better taco. At  4-5 per taco  these are well worth the price.
Veracruz All Natural,168,best tacos of my life go here asap   new favorite taco restaurant i ve ever been to  
Veracruz All Natural,169,Great food and vibe. The fresca is extreme refreshing and the tacos are value for money
Veracruz All Natural,170,Great taco place in Austin  the fish tacos are the best I ve had so far during my time here. The Al Pastor is also great  Veracruz has their own take on it and adds pineapples in it. You might not think this would be good  but it s definitely something you won t know unless you try it. Definitely worth the price and the tacos are slightly bigger than tacos I ve had from other places  like tacodeli and taco shack.
Veracruz All Natural,171,The best tacos I ve had in Austin so far. Loved the shrimp and egg tacos  still reeling  in a good way  from the spice of that salsa  and can t wait to go back 
Veracruz All Natural,172,First stop in Austin was a huge success  minus the line  Although  it was a Saturday afternoon... around 11 30am  so okay you pass.  Taco Trucks are a must in Austin  so of course we decided to try this out  Especially  breakfast tacos... hangover food  much  Outdoor seating w  umbrellas and covered seating. It was slightly drizzling  so don t expect dry seating. The line to order was long  maybe an hour   but receiving the food was a short wait  Takes CC  amp  good luck with parking. We walked.  Tacos  MIGAS  V  - YES. My friends loved it   La Reyna  V  - YES. Healthier option than the migas  amp  Same price. Egg whites  carrots  spinach  avocado  mushroom  bell pepper  pico de gallo  monterey jack cheese  Fish - YES. The Chipotle Mayo Salsa is different  amp  I wanted to put it on everything. Al Pastor - Decent. MEH. Pass.  I think we also got the steak taco  but not sure. Green sauce is just straight spicy  but would recommend the red salsa   Drinks  Agua fresca - Mango or Strawberry were not too sweet and definitely fresh  Must get   Orange apple carrot juice or something and my friend said it was great 
Veracruz All Natural,173,Whats to say that hasn t been said  Best tacos in Austin      Love the Al Pastor.  Their salsas are so good too. Drool.
Veracruz All Natural,174,Truly fantastic tacos from the tortillas to the fresh ingredients and the flavor combo. The add-your-own sauces on the side are solid  too.   I really enjoyed my migas poblanas  egg  tortilla chips  poblano peppers  red onion  queso fresco  black beans  avocado  on flour tortilla  and chicken mole on corn tortilla  though I think the migas were the standout. The mole sauce is really well down though.   The strawberry aguafresca was spot on. So refreshing  perfectly sweetened with cane sugar so not too sweet  and ginormous.   The line moves fairly quickly and they ll tell you the wait time when you order.  On Saturday at 9 45  the wait was about 15 min to order  and another 20 min for the tacos.   This is the OG location though I ve been told all locations are consistently excellent.
Veracruz All Natural,175,Great food but get it to go unless you like fighting with birds for a taco. I got a make your own breakfast taco with chorizo  eggs  and Monterey jack cheese  and a chicken taco. My total for the two was  6.50. The tacos took about 10-15 minutes to make but this was on a weekday around 1 30 pm.
Veracruz All Natural,176,Delicious vegan tacos are featured alongside their traditional taco offerings.  Cheers to their creativity for making healthy Mexican food taste great. Salsas are amazing too 
Veracruz All Natural,177,I am so sad that I only came here once during my trip and only had one taco.   FoodRegrets - I can t stop thinking about that amazing breakfast taco.  So delicious that I want to come back to Austin to have a few more of their migas originales.
Veracruz All Natural,178,THE BEST. The poblano migas is divine  so is their melon smoothie. The food can be a bit of a wait  but is always  always  worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,179,On a very cold and blustery day  I headed to Veracruz  hoping to get some yummy breakfast tacos. To my surprise  there was no line  I ordered a breakfast taco with bacon  potato and avocado  as well as an al pastor and fajita steak taco. To drink  I ordered a Mexico lindo smoothie.  First  the smoothie - DELICIOUS. I loved the subtle lime flavour. I wish I had grabbed the larger size. 5 5.  Now  the tacos. I started with the Al Pastor. Preeeeettttyyyy good. The pork was juicy  the pineapple added some sweetness. 4 5.  The fajita steak was okay  I wasn t a huge fan of the steak. Didn t really have a ton of flavour. 3 5  The breakfast taco I ordered was a custom creation. I don t eat eggs or cheese  so the Migas was out of the question. When I was eating my taco  I realized that there was beans added to it  which I didn t ask for. It was still good  just wasn t in the mood for beans first thing in the am. 3.5 5.  For the price  you can t beat Veracruz. You can get a filling meal of a few tacos for 10-15 . Seriously don t sleep on the smoothies either.
Veracruz All Natural,180,Got the Migas which is their staple and it was delicious  this should be your go to if it s your first visit. Also has their al pastor taco which was unfortunately a little dry but still decent. On the whole though  my favorite was the mole. It can be hard to get right and pretty poor if not done well but it was fantastic and if I went back it would be my first choice. Also had a mango agua fresaca  32oz for  4  which was delicious  just right to offset the earthy flavors of the tacos.   Weather was too cold and windy to sit outside and enjoy the food but they do have a nice small area with picnic tables and umbrellas to enjoy in nice weather. My only complaint would be the lack of hot sauce available to grab and add to your tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,181,These tacos are worth waiting in 100  weather for. There are breakfast tacos  veggie options  and authentic al pastor and carne asada to die for. I would ve loved fish tacos  but I didn t love that tilapia was the fish used so I passed. There is a huge variety of agua Fresca to choose from too. The cantaloupe was my choice because it s hard to find  but the pineapple was so refreshing in the heat. In three days  I ate here twice.
Veracruz All Natural,182,This place is elite. E-LITE. I visited the food truck version but I m sure the food is amazing at every location. I got tacos de pastor  veggie  and one of the breakfast taco options with chorizo. I also got a watermelon Agua.  Man...everything was phenomenal. Seriously amazing. I think the pricing is a bit high for your average tacos...but these aint your average tacos. 100  worth a trip.
Veracruz All Natural,183,Best tacos in Austin. Lots of vegan   veg options.  Make sure to order ahead online so you don t have to wait 
Veracruz All Natural,184,Always great food and great service. Parking is accessible and seating indoors and outside as well
Veracruz All Natural,185,Veracruz All Natural is a food truck known for its Street Tacos  but my friend and I visited for the freshly made drinks.  Veracruz offers lots of other different bites like quesadillas and tortas  which I definitely need to try the next time I m in Austin.  Because of its popularity  the wait times can get pretty long.  It took us about 15 min to order and receive our drinks  so I assume the wait for food takes even longer.  We picked up a banana-berry smoothie  pineapple aguas frescas  and a small black coffee.  The fruits in the drinks are so fresh and bright  you can tell that everything is freshly made with real fruit and ingredients.  You get a huge 16 oz drink for under  5  and the larger drink for cents more.  For a refreshing drink to take with you while you walk through the streets of Austin  stop by Veracruz All Natural for a fresh pick-me-up.
Veracruz All Natural,186,Prepare for a line any time on the weekend  and limited to no parking but what great Austin food has either  Haha but so worth it. Al pastor had pineapples onions and cilantro  was some of the freshest tasting ingredients you can expect from a food truck bus. Migas were crispy and also really fresh. Might be taking over taco joint as my favorite bfast taco in town. Gotta make it out here on a weekday next. Please go 
Veracruz All Natural,187,My wife and I really dig this place.  Our first time here ordering  we just got a smoothie  migas taco and a breakfast taco.  We promptly received the taco  took a few bites and I immediately got up and lined up to order some of their other tacos.  It was really good     I ended up ordering another migas  a carne taco  a veggie taco and a chicken taco.  Everything was really good especially the smoothie    We came right as it opened so there was ample spots to sit.  There are plenty of street parking.  The tacos are  3- 4 dollars each and smoothie was about  8 dollars.  I didn t pay too much attention to the price because we wanted to try most of their offerings.  Would recommend 
Veracruz All Natural,188,Veracruz is my kind of food - cheap and tasty. We really just wanted to try some local Austin tacos that weren t Torchy s  and Veracruz was perfect. As a plus  we got to soak up more of that Austin food truck vibe.  We did our Yelp research and got the Fish taco and Migas taco since they were both highly rated  The Migas taco is probably the BEST taco I ve ever had. It s rated in the top 5 tacos in the US by Food Network  and it rEally lives up to that. In addition to the typical egg  avocado  pico de gallo  and cheese  there were even tortilla chips for that extra crunch and flavor. This was so good I ordered a second one  The Fish taco was also great  but the Migas was definitely my favorite. Don t forget to try their salsa as well   Lines weren t long at all for me  but we came at around 1pm on a Friday. It s also a bit out of the way  but it was so worth it. Definitely builded on my already strong impression of Austin foods 
Veracruz All Natural,189,YUM. The fish tacos we re so fresh and had a huge slice of avocado on them. Chips were homemade and super crunchy. So good with the guac. Didn t get a picture of the agua frescas but the pineapple one was like a liquid dole whip. AH-MA-ZING. The wait was pretty long  but it was worth it. I suggest ordering online before you even get to the truck because we waited a long time. The salsas were way too for my liking. A little pico for added flavor would have been nice because I feel like the fish needed a little more salt. Personal opinion. Other than that  thoroughly enjoyed  My friend said she had the best breakfast taco she had ever had. That s a bold statement 
Veracruz All Natural,190,This is a solid breakfast taco place. I didn t know what migas were and had to google it. Apparently  it is tortillas fried with veggies  cheese  and eggs and I read that it is a HUGE deal in Austin. This place boasts of its migas tacos and you will see that everyone is pretty much ordering it  so you kind of HAVE to order it. When I got it  I thought to myself that it looks like chilaquiles  I love chilaquiles. I read that the difference is that chilaquiles is cooked with salsa and migas are cooked with eggs. However  for me to look at that migas taco with salsa and eggs inside  my untrained eye could not differentiate.   The tortilla tasted homemade and I think I could eat that tortilla just for fun without anything. The migas taco was good and I topped it with some salsa at their salsa bar  which made it more delicious. The al pastor taco is different from how I typically experience al pastor in Los Angeles and that is  rotating on a spit slowly while glistening in its juices. Nonetheless  the al pastor taco had very tender  flavorful chunks of pork. One thing I cannot argue is that Austin knows how to do pork right 
Veracruz All Natural,191,Had to do Breakfast Tacos in Austin.  I was told it was a must.  So we waited in a line in the rain  yes - in the rain.  Then we ate our meal on one of their picnic tables under an umbrella that was dripping all around us.  It was wet  chilly and uncomfortable.  Was it worth it   A resounding YES   Loved their breakfast tacos.  We tried their Migas original and two of our own concoctions.  They were all fantastic.  Loved their salsas.  Their tortillas  which can make or break a meal  were the bomb.  Both the flour and corn tortillas were done to perfection.  It was a great meal   We were so hungry that my photos are half eaten  haha 
Veracruz All Natural,192,Long time Austinite  and I can safely say these are the best breakfast tacos out here. Maybe a little overseasoned at times  but overall  incredible. My mother s side is from mexico and the migas tacos remind me of breakfast as a kid. Besides that  the Fish Tacos are some of the best Ive had. I cant speak for anything else on the menu  because im completely addicted to what I ve had.   P.S. Your to-go salsa cups  especially the green  are half-filled at best  I need that green sauce and lots of it  please  Maybe sell portions on the side 
Veracruz All Natural,193,Grilled Chicken taco 5 5 Steak taco 4 5 Chips with guac 3 5  A little pricey at  4 taco but that s Austin for you. The house made corn tortilla was excellent with the chicken taco. The chips were good but the guac was lacking a little flavor  although both were of good quality. The sauces were fine not too spicy.   Will try the breakfast taco Migas next time I think that s the famous item here.  UPDATE  Tried the breakfast tacos the next day. I had the Migas original  Migas poblanos  and El Sancho. 4 5 for all of them. My favorite was the poblanos bc the beans gave it a nice texture.
Veracruz All Natural,194,Apparently their tacos are great... but I m here to talk about their monster quesadilla. I went here with my mom and I m not even kidding or exaggerating when I say that she did a prayer to universe afterwards thanking it for giving her the chance to have such a cheesy quesadilla. 10 10 coming here for their famous tacos later.
Veracruz All Natural,195,As far as breakfast tacos go  their Migas is pretty darn good. It s fairly priced and surprisingly filling. It s simple  but you can tell the ingredients are fresh and freshly prepared. Hopefully next time I m in Austin I can try their Al Pastor.
Veracruz All Natural,196,Honestly the best breakfast taco i ve ever had  ever. None of that dry rubbery eggs   bacon on a limp cold tortilla. This Migas taco was the best ever...so flavorful and filling and warm. I could eat this every morning.   I also had the chicken torta  fish taco  and al pastor. My favorite was the fish taco--it was fishy and gamey  which I enjoy. Tasted like they fished this fish right out of th waters before cooking and serving.   The salsa is AMAZING...never had salsa this good. Chips had substance to them  something to really chew on. But at the same time  crispy and dense. Awesome pairing with salsa.  I also had the watermelon fresca  which hit the spot after so many of these salty foods...Seemed fresh and nothing but fruit and juice and ice.  Due to the food truck nature of this place  I can t rate the interior or whatever  but it certainly still looked cute and put together  the public seating spaces .   The service is nice.   Disclaimer  I m a NYC girl at heart who has never been to Central America so my standards have been relatively low.
Veracruz All Natural,197,We ate here today and were impressed...multiple food trucks  all Veracruz.  Coldbrew and churros at one  queso at another  tacos at another  juices at another...and I kmow there was yet another.  The watermelon water rocked  as did my chicken taco and quesadilla...great hot sauces  too  and some nice shaded area with tables.  It s worth coming back.
Veracruz All Natural,198,Definitely get the watermelon aqua fresca- so refreshing  I got the chicken and steak tacos. They were pretty good  We shared some guac and salsa which was also quite tasty.
Veracruz All Natural,199,Either we wrote a review for the wrong location last time  which was on Cesar Chavez  or they ve updated that one to here. We ve actually been to Veracruz a bunch of times since then  but to their north location  now closed  because it was near our daughter s daycare. We mainly go for the agua frescas  which we love. That was the impetus for our trip yesterday.  We each picked our own flavor  cucumber  pineapple  and mango. The best was pineapple by far. Against our advice not to get the mango--even though it s a family favorite flavor-wise--our daughter insisted. This is the only flavor that never tastes fresh. The cucumber is great  but our chief complaint is that we had ordered ahead and by the time we got there  all the pulp had risen to the top and it was a pain in the ass to restir the drinks with their paltry straws.  We also got their chips  the crunch  the freshness   and a side of guac and a side of beans. We loved both  but they needed salt. The barbacoa taco was solid albeit greasy and the breakfast one  El Tradicional  was as good as it gets.  Everything was no-touch and since we arrived close to 3  there was only one other picnic bench occupied  so distancing safety was easy. We like this place  and apparently it s the only location doing frescas now  so we ll be back at some point.
Veracruz All Natural,200,Perfectly solid grub. Poblanos breakfast taco got five stars. Pastor four. Mole three - oof  never seen chunk chicken in mole. Fantastic juice as good as Juiceland at 5 stars. Nice staff  cool outdoor area.
Veracruz All Natural,201,This place has some yummy tacos and the homemade chips were delicious. We ordered the grilled steak tacos and they didn t disappoint. I m giving it four stars because we also ordered some drinks and the way they were distributing the drinks seemed disorganized since it took a long time. The food also took longer than what we were told but that s understandable. Overall  great place for some pricey but good tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,202,It s taken me a while to tacobout it  but I finally found the right words to describe Veracruz  fancy-ass tacos.   I came here on a whim  really. I was en route to Downtown on the MetroRail when I saw that I was near one of my bookmarks  so I got off and trekked down the few blocks because I was STARVING. Although it looks sketchy  this area seems like it s growing  and I m sure Veracruz brings in a pretty hip  young crowd.  For a food truck  this place is ballin --it has its own space  patio seating  umbrellas and picnic benches   a ramp--the whole nine yards--even call buzzers  It took about 20 minutes to get my two tacos  but they seemed busy even for a weekday morning.  I had a Migas and an Egg  amp  Chorizo taco off the breakfast menu. The Egg  amp  Chorizo Taco was too spicy for my  mild  tolerance  but flavorful. You ll probably like this if you like it saucy and spicy. Like many people  I absolutely loved the Migas Taco--an explosion of flavors  it was such a fun treat to eat  especially with the crunchy pieces of tortilla chips in the mix. All the ingredients were fresh and made from scratch  so that made the wait worth it.    Not sure if the pricing is standard for tacos in Austin  but they were a bit pricey. Then again  they are a well-known taco spot in Austin and their fresh ingredients justify their prices. Would totally come back here again to get the Migas Taco and try their agua frescas 
Veracruz All Natural,203,Good food but they only do online ordering and it s not easy. You have to sign up and register for a website just to order  even with Apple Pay.
Veracruz All Natural,204,Overall pretty damn good tacos.  In love w the corn tortillas. Huge fan of the migas taco. The chicken mole taco is a great change up.  I d take a pass on the al pastor taco.  Absolutely loveeeee the green salsa spicy af 
Veracruz All Natural,205,The food here is incredible. The Migas tacos are probably the best in the world. Seriously. Then there are the fish tacos  chicken tacos  etc. It s all amazing. I also like that you can order ahead online and the projected pickup time has always been fairly accurate. The only gripe I have is that it s in the Mueller food park which means  hot  eating prime times make it an incredible pain to find a quick spot to park so you can run up and grab your order due to limited parking spots. It s not at all a knock on Veracruz  but it has impacted the frequency for which we would otherwise like to order from them. Other just as amazing food trucks like Paprika and Granny s have easier access where you can at least find a space to park your car for a hot minute while you jump out to scoop up your order during high volume dining times.
Veracruz All Natural,206,You know when you re at a party and someone tells a joke and everyone starts laughing and you don t get it but you laugh anyway because you don t want to be the one person who doesn t get it  Well  that s me trying to understand the hype of this place. I want in on why everyone loves it but I m just over here like   I don t get it. It s not that good.   I love tacos. And I ve been lucky enough to eat tacos in some pretty amazing places. I was informed  however  to truly experience tacos  I must eat at Veracruz All Natural. Even Lonely Planet had this as a must do. So I forked over  20 in Uber rides and took myself to the Veracruz All Natural trailer. Here s what I did enjoy   1. the fact that I showed up at 11 00 and beat the INSANE line that formed at 12 00 while I sat still waiting for the taco order I placed 45 minutes ago. 2. eating outside and the general vibe of the place 3. the watermelon aguas fresca - but what s not to love about watermelon mixed with a metric shit ton of sugar  What I did not love  1. The tacos Allow me to explain - I don t get the hype. The tacos were just ok. I ve combed through reviews about  chew  and  flavor profile.  Here s what I know. I ve had homemade corn tortillas. I have a friend that s kind enough to make them for me for a six pack of beer or if I feed his cat when he s gone for the weekend. His are better and have a lot more flavor. They also don t cost me  5 a piece. The  flavor profiles  of the tacos here were bland. I had the al Pastor  one of my all time favorite tacos. It was the first one I opened and I blindly picked it up and started eating  I m an animal like that . I literally stopped chewing and mouth still full  opened the other tacos to figure out which one I was currently eating. That is how much taste there wasn t. The holy grail of breakfast tacos  the migas originales  also just didn t do it for me. My egg was overdone and the taco tasted more like avocado than anything.  So there you have it. I ll nod and laugh along  but actually  I don t get what everyone else is talking about.
Veracruz All Natural,207,Best food I had in Austin. The breakfast tacos are huge and packed full of so much flavor. I got the poblano Migas and a smoothie. I wish this was closer to where I lived and k would probably eat here daily.
Veracruz All Natural,208,Let me tell you  BEST breakfast taco I ever had  Do yourself a favor tomorrow morning and order a original migas taco  Looking forward to go back to Austin and eat there and try other items on the menu too 
Veracruz All Natural,209,Wow  these tacos were pretty amazing. It s a food truck  and the line can get long. I waited in line for about 30 minutes  but it was definitely worth it    I ordered the Migas taco on a flour tortilla  the fish taco on a flour tortilla and the al pastor taco on a corn tortilla. I also ordered the mango aguafresca. The fish taco was my favorite and it was just so  so good and fresh. They grill the fish right when you order the taco. All of their corn tortillas are homemade. I usually don t like corn tortillas  but I actually liked these. They were softer than the non-homemade ones. Food network has also had Veracruz on TV  and their Migas taco is pretty famous. I would probably add chorizo to that taco if I ordered it again. Finally  the aguafresca was amazing. It literally tasted exactly like mango  and I m sure they blend it fresh  but it s not like a smoothie or juice. This wait is definitely worth it 
Veracruz All Natural,210,One of the better taco places I ve ever been to and a great ambience that builds to the experience   I came to Veracruz because it was close to where I was staying in the area. Veracruz is a white school bus converted to taco-manufacturing machine  basically. It s in a fenced off area with picnic tables with large umbrellas shading the space. I came here twice in the morning  in two days   because it was so delicious the first time and was not disappointed either time. I tried the migas originales and migas poblanas  breakfast tacos  and was surprised at how flavorful these were despite not having any meat. These tacos were fairly large and well-priced too. They have a selection of sauces sitting near the pick-up window as well which are tasty. The salsa looks home-made. They also serve smoothies  which looked pretty popular and tasty  although I did not have a chance to taste any of these when I visited. I also tried the el pastor and fajita steak-- these were a smidge smaller than the breakfast tacos were equally delicious. The meat really packs a punch and is incredibly juicy.   Service is very friendly and there s a small parking lot you can park in if you have a car. I really liked the vibe of this place in the context of East Austin. The vibe here is especially relaxing if you come early in the morning  with the quiet of the surrounding neighborhood and the hustle and bustle of the hunger customers ready to eat here  there s always someone waiting for tacos here . Will definitely re-visit this place if I am ever in East Austin again.
Veracruz All Natural,211,I tried this place many years ago on a trip to Austin.... fell in love with the tacos and breakfast tacos. Now that I live in TX  I visit Veracruz every time I m in Austin. I don t know what their secret is  but this is hands down the best taco place 
Veracruz All Natural,212,Yup  Amazing  Fresh  big portions  gluten free friendly  quick  delicious  I ordered two tacos and could only eat one  The breakfast veggie taco was full of egg whites  carrots  spinach  peppers  mushrooms and a bit of cheese. It was like an egg scramble wrapped in a tortilla and was a great start to the day. My boyfriend tried the Migas  fish and chicken tacos  which were all great. My friends were disappointed by the mole taco  so maybe skip that  otherwise  I recommend trying one of each  but maybe not all at once. The location of the truck is a bit out of the way  in a poorer part of town  but there is a cute patio  perfect for a bite on a nice day  I would definitely come back and prices are spot on  especially for how generous the portions are.
Veracruz All Natural,213,Ordered 5 tacos and a juice to share between me and my boyfriend. We had the El Pastor  Migas  La Reyna  Fajita Steak  and Fish tacos  and the La Bomba juice  orange juice  pineapple  spinach.  If you order La Reyna  definitely recommend eating it first because the cooked vegetables soak the tortilla. We saved it for last and the tortilla was completely soggy.   Our favorite taco was the El Pastor. It was the most flavorful out of all of them. The other tacos lacked any flavor - definitely need sauces so you could taste the tacos  and this is coming from someone who s extremely sensitive to salt and strong flavors.  Overall the tacos were good  but not worth the hype and the hour wait. We ve had better tacos in Mexico City  though that may be an unfair comparison.
Veracruz All Natural,214,Great food    As someone who cannot process dairy I love that they offer a vegan queso that actually tastes like queso   Also  the aguas frescas are
Veracruz All Natural,215,I was here for the breakfast tacos  obviously - and they are totally legit. I don t normally get excited about paying  3.75 for one regular taco-sized taco  but the poblano miga  while made on a base of a normal soft taco-sized tortilla  though I believe made fresh  as it s super fluffy and tasty   is then just completely jam-packed with stuff  so yeah  worth it on size  and obviously also on quality. It is absolutely delicious. I also tried a regular breakfast taco of egg  cheese and cactus  and it was also fantastic - I d be willing to eat vegetarian for a week with no complaints if I were eating food like this.   So  two tacos is a pretty good amount of food  but they actually gave me a free third one by accident  with bacon - I found their bacon too salty  so even more likely I d eat vegetarian if I were here  which  if I lived in the Austin area  I would definitely do frequently . I also tried a bite of my wife s regular not-breakfast pork taco  and thought it was just ok. I definitely recommend sticking to the breakfast tacos  which are what they re known for  for good reason. And make sure to grab some of their delicious creamy hot sauce  which is unfortunately hidden in the back  so it s easy to miss.   I also tried their agua fresca  which is totally worth 4 bucks  because it is  huge   and also clearly fresh made .   I wouldn t be nearly as excited if I d had to stand in a huge long line  though - I was here a little after 2 PM on a Friday  and there was basically no line.
Veracruz All Natural,216,Not Celiac friendly - suceptible to crosscontamination. There are websites that lists vera Cruz tacos as celiac friendly and it is not.  It s a small food truck and they not have a separate grill for their  wheat  flour and corn tortillas and grilled meats.   If you re really sensitive to gluten  I do not recommend this place.  I had a piece of each of the meats and I like the Al pastor was the best. The fish was just as great. The flank steak reminded me of lengua and was much softer than most carne asada I ve had. The chips were crunchy and salsa was well spiced and a good amount of smokey.
Veracruz All Natural,217,Veracruz has possibly the best tacos in the city  but their ordering system is a dumpster fire. It takes too long to make an order  so the line is really long. They say you ll get a text message  but the text came 20 minutes after my order was ready. My drink wasn t included. I had to track people down  show them my receipt and wait another 5 minutes while they made the drink I d ordered 50 minutes before. Dumpster fire.
Veracruz All Natural,218,The migas breakfast taco is so so good with the free salsas on the side. Simple ingredients but executed well. Definitely going back and trying out some from their lunch menu 
Veracruz All Natural,219,Yummy yummy yummy Sooooo gooooood These tacos were fresh  delicious  flavorful and the perfect quick bite for a friday night.  I got the al pastor taco which was pork with pineapple. Alittle greasy and heavy but so tasty  Not too sweet where the pineapple overpowered which is good and the pork had alot of flavor.  Than i got a grilled chicken taco which was with el fresco  avocado and onion and it was perfect.  Tacos are alittle small but they fill it with all the goodness.  We also got a chicken quesadilla. One of best quesadillas ive ever had. Super cheesy and crispy but soft at the same time.   Environment wise  cute outdoor seating in a closed off park type place.  Its alittle out of the way in the back streets of nowhere but definitely high on the list for taco places to try  Def recommend  Didnt take pics cuz i was hungry and it looked so good so thats tellin ya somethin  Phone did NOT eat first this time
Veracruz All Natural,220,Waited for 30 min for my food to come home and find out that I did not received everything I ordered    Very disappointed.
Veracruz All Natural,221,Best tacos EVA  Wow so good. Usually get the al pastor and a chicken quesadilla. So much food. Can never finish but my stomach is full and happy.   The place gets crowded but sometimes you can find a spot. Apparently this place is known for its breakfast tacos and maybe it s bc I m not a huge fan of bfast tacos or migas but I go for the regular tacos.   The wait is about 20 min or so  If you re starving get chips and guac. I remember the guac being ok. For some reason coming from CA the guac here is very liquidy and mas o menos
Veracruz All Natural,222,Tried the Migas  Reyna and al Pastor.  I wanted to try the Migas on both flour and corn  but when I got them  I got 2 flour  though I ordered 1 of each .  I guess I could have told them to correct it but I didn t.  Add some of the salsa that is under the tent - be careful bc some pack HEAT
Veracruz All Natural,223,Delicious food. Nice seating area with shades  Price is very decent  There is a juice bar next to the truck with delicious thirst quenching selection
Veracruz All Natural,224,Trust their reviews. Best food we had in Austin. We got the chicken steak and pork taco and the quesadilla. Sooo good. Great proportions plenty of food and not stingy on the sides of sour cream guac or anything. We also got the salsa and queso with chips and their was plenty. Definitely a must try. Also there was plenty of tables and space to enjoy your meal 
Veracruz All Natural,225,Came here with some friends for lunch  The seating area is beautiful and had lots of shade which is great especially for the incoming summer heat ..  We all ordered tacos which you have a choice of either corn or flour. You can t go wrong with either of them  so pick what you like. I tried both the original Miga s and al pastor. They were booooth delicioussss.   Both of them were adequately priced and filling  so I definitely got my money s worth. The pineapple in the pastor was sweet and juicy with the meat being tender. The migas was good toooo. Try not to let it sit for so long or else the chips will get too soggy   .   For salsa  you have the red sauce and the green sauce. I strongly prefer the green sauce for the underlying heat while the red one is like a punch in the face.   I can t wait to come back  I m probably going to try the Agua s Fresca.
Veracruz All Natural,226,My favorite taco place in Austin  I love love love the Migas Poblanos taco. I think getting it fresh from the kitchen is way better than getting it from take out. The crispness of the chips they add into the taco is so good. I really wish they kept the 183 location but glad they opened the Tarrytown location. Wish they were open late as well but I ll take what I can get 
Veracruz All Natural,227,I don t know about waiting in the hot sun  but it was certainly worth waiting in chill drizzling weather. The migas taco was divine and the el pastor was tasty too.
Veracruz All Natural,228,While my group and I were waiting to order and eat at la bbq  we saw there was a nearby taco bus dishing out apparently a top 5 taco marketed by the food network. Located in east Austin we ordered 4 diff tacos between our group to hold us over this 1 hr wait. First off the top 5 rated taco called the Migas.....it was good. Don t think it is justified by the ranking  rating  or hype....just was a good vegetarian taco in my opinion  I thought the al pastor taco was way more flavorful. We also got the chicken mole and fish tacos which were just ok. Chicken was nothing special  taco you could probably save money and make at home and the fish taco was a bit too fishy.   Those working at the east Austin location were rude too. Maybe the guy was irritated with the questions being asked....it was our first time  of course we will have questions about the food were about to order...  Also asked for water and if there were any sauces or hot sauce and he definitely seemed frustrated or annoyed....anyway  for the price  not really worth the food or experience. They also offer corn or flour tortilla options. There pretty quick with making the tacos food as well but there s only two guys who speak English  so if you have a question  be prepared to wait until they free up from what there doing or who there  helping 
Veracruz All Natural,229,The migas are worth coming here alone. I don t even like migas  but this blew me away. Fresh egg and avocado  crunchy tortilla chips  a onion tomato mixture that tastes homemade  and just the right amount of cheese to tie it together.    The pastor was good  but not quite what I m use to. They were cubes of pork rather than grounded. The pineapples were there  but much more in the backdrop than in the forefront. Some pieces of pork were chewy  while others were melt in your mouth.    I don t normally order fish tacos  but I decided to give this a spin. The description I saw on the menu said  minimal masterpiece . They re not far off. There is a serene harmony with this composition. The tilapia stands firm  yet in contemplation amongst its subtle yet enhancing sides. The creamy avocado gives it depth  the fruit and pick de Gallo gives it a bright freshness  while all blending into the tilapia. Don t e Percy this to be a crazy flavored  fusion fish dish  but rather a reflection on the simplistic majesty of the tilapia.    The flour tortillas are done right. Firm yet pillow soft. They provide a structure while never burdening the jaw with weight or density. They also take on the oils of the dish quite well.     I walked in expecting the usual  but I was pleasantly surprised. Swing by and grab yourself some tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,230,Amazingly amazingggggggg      Can t wait to return  This will be our go to spot when visiting Austin. Definitely a favorite    
Veracruz All Natural,231,Amazing food  Every time I come to Austin I have to make a stop. I love the aguas frescas they have.
Veracruz All Natural,232,The fish taco is my absolute favorite here.  We also tried the migas poblanos and la reyna.  The chips and salsa were great additions but wasn t spicy so I added their smoky red sauce to mix it up and it was the perfect amount of spiciness.  Service was a bit slow for a Friday lunch but  we still got our food within 20-30 min after ordering. Parking is small but quick turnaround.
Veracruz All Natural,233,Holy breakfast tacos  Batman    The line moved much slower than I expected  and the order got a little messed up but hot damn - these are the best breakfast tacos ever. The migas was really good but I think my personal favorite was the Al Pastor. Or the chorizo. Or the bacon and potato. Crap.  Go here 
Veracruz All Natural,234,This place was a quick 5 minute walk from our AirBnb so we decided to check it out around 11am on a Saturday. Food truck in a pretty deserted lot with a good amount of tables. Line looked pretty long  wrapped around to the gated entrance  but we decided to wait it out thinking it would be 20 mins tops. Little did we know  we would be waiting for OVER AN HOUR. The best part  We went to the liquor store before and I was stuck holding the case of White Claws...   It was too late to turn back now and we were discussing how these better be the BEST tacos we ve had in our lives... and it did not disappoint.  Among the three of us  we tried the grilled fish  steak  al pastor  and Migas originales. Corn tortilla is definitely the star and they fill them up quite a bit. Definitely go for 3. While the tacos were amazing  the real star are the agua frescas. I got the mango and my sister got the watermelon. I d go back and wait in that line all over again just for the drinks....maybe.  If you re with good company  the time passes fairly quickly. Worth the visit  just be prepared to wait   Ps. It was a freak weekend and we were waiting under comfortable overcast skies and 65 degree weather. This review may be a lot different if we were baking under scorching Austin heat...
Veracruz All Natural,235,Dropped by around 11am  Saturday. There were no parking spaces available on the lot so we parked on the street next to the gas station that is near.   There was a line. We probably waited about 35 mins. They text you when your order is ready. Food was ready within 5 minutes.  They have a sauce station on the side so be sure to pack your to go sauces   Indoor seating is limited but it s all shaded. If you want to eat there  be prepared for some community seating.   I ordered the mijos originales  mijos poblanos  fish tacos  beef fajita  and the pork.  Everything was excellent     Well worth the wait 
Veracruz All Natural,236,They were out of the chicken mole tacos but they had enough options. Go here solely for the tacos. They are absolutely delicious. The guacamole  not so much.
Veracruz All Natural,237,I have been a loyal customer for a very long time  Today I was extremely disappointed and treated horribly  I have yet to speak with management and have not received no call back  My whole order was messed up and The lady who took my order doesn t want to admit that she made a mistake and insisted that I bring in my tacos for a full refund. Why should I have to drive 20 min out of my way to get my refund   I was talked with disrespect and attitude  I will never be back  
Veracruz All Natural,238,Straight up  one of the best taco trucks I ve ever had. I m extremely impressed by the food especially since I am from Chicago. The  chicken mole was so flavorful and an intense sauce I ve never experienced. Definitely need to try because I was a little afraid to try it after hearing it was mixed with spices including a chocolate flavor but it was amazing  one of the best chicken tacos I ve ever had. I also got the fajita steak taco which was with cilantro  onion  queso fresco  and slices of avacado   Also super good. Definitely need to drizzle with the light green sauce  free  which adds a lot of flavor  also a sauce I ve never tried before. We also got the appetizer with salsa and chips and the chips were AUTHENTIC AF. Can t wait to visit Austin again and come here again   
Veracruz All Natural,239,This is a taco food truck with interesting outdoor seating.   Good but not great  unpopular opinion .   Would put taco deli above Veracruz due to the variety  price  and seating options.
Veracruz All Natural,240,I liked that all ordering is done online due to COVID. The Migas breakfast tacos were a hit along with the green juice. Classic Austin food truck vibe. No frills  just great food and service.
Veracruz All Natural,241,Oddly enough the next three times I have had their fish tacos left me disappointed. Its almost as the first time was a run of good luck. The fish tacos were skimpy and shoddy. Perhaps it has to do with the timing or of how busy they are.
Veracruz All Natural,242,Great stop for delicious full of flavor tacos. We got a grilled chicken taco which was with el fresco  avocado and onion and it was perfect. Tacos are a little small but they fill it with all the goodness. We also got a chicken quesadilla. One of best quesadillas ive ever had. Super cheesy and crispy but soft at the same time. Good service  good food.
Veracruz All Natural,243,MIGAS  MIGAS  and more MIGAS.  Scorchin  heat  fire tacos. Absolutely loved having breakfast here. Wish I d shown up earlier to skip the   45 minute wait  but the tacos were 1000  worth it. There s not much seating available while you wait and picnic tables are quickly taken by large parties so stake out a spot as soon as you arrive   What can I say that hasn t already been said  The Migas are amazing and I still dream about them  etc etc. They re so good  they almost make Al Pastor  one of my go-to s  look bad.   The smoothies  amp  aguas frescas here are so underrated  The Ms. Maritza Smoothie is crazy refreshing and a unique flavor combo  watermelon kiwi . Order a large  you ll love it   Can t wait to stop by next time I m in Austin 
Veracruz All Natural,244,The best part was the Traditional breakfast taco. Queso and salsa verde was not worth it. Way better queso and salsa so many other places in Austin. The red salsa they gave for the tacos was actually gross. I have never had a red salsa I didnt like and mistakenly put it on my taco before tasting it. I ended up scraping it off. The aqua fresca definitely had fresh  real fruit in it  so if you like that kind of thing  it might be worth it for you.
Veracruz All Natural,245,I came here for my last night in Austin. It was online order only at the time. I had two tacos  they are not that big for the price  but delicious. I also got a quesadilla and a blended drink. Overall the food was a good size  but not really for the price. More for a diet. But I would come back here in a heart beat.
Veracruz All Natural,246,Have to post another five star review for my favorite taco place. They offer delivery and the tacos arrive hot  neat  correct  and delicious with the right amount of salsa and limes. Guess I have a new weekly lunch habit.
Veracruz All Natural,247,After a night on Rainey Street  this place is insanely good for recovery food. I had to try one of their agua frescas  I went with a pineapple agua fresca and knew this place would be delicious after the first sip. It was cold  a little sweet and the perfect summer beverage. The Migas taco is good  especially with extra sauce. The al pastor was even better  It had a little kick.
Veracruz All Natural,248,Breakfast tacos are a must in Austin  Texas and eating them from a food truck just reinforces the fact. The best in the city are from Veracruz All Natural  don t sleep in too late because they are only open through 3PM.  Walk up assess the menu and order  you ll be handed a buzzer.  Get the  MIGAS   they will change your life. Eggs  tortilla chips  avocado  pico de gallo  and Monterey jack cheese for  3.50  these masterful creations are consider one of the top 5 tacos in America. Crunchy  creamy  a little spicy  and obscenely delicious. Well worthy of their title  be sure to adorn them with your choice of salsa. Don t forget the bebidas. Nothing follows a spicy salsa like a Mango Tango smoothie  made with low fat yogurt and fresh fruit so you don t have to feel so bad. There is no way you ll leave here feeling anything but amazing.
Veracruz All Natural,249,Seating is cool. Aqua Fresca is YUM. Tacos are decent.  Tacos gotta be damn good for another star and I wasn t blown away by the flavors.  3-3.50 for a little taco. Gotta order 3 to be full...
Veracruz All Natural,250,When I rolled into the unpaved lot where Veracruz All Natural s bus was parked  I was a little bit apprehensive. It was early  I almost missed the turn because the blue sign had very light lettering and was a bit small  and the crows on the trees were so loud and aggressive that I was afraid I would lose an eye trying to eat my taco.  Seriously  scary.   But the migas are not to be missed. This was my first time ever having migas and now I know what s been missing in my breakfast taco life - tortilla chips. And handmade tortillas. These breakfast tacos were good. Because the tortillas are handmade  they are resilient to the sogginess that a typical taco is. It was able to soak up all the juices from meat  pico de gallo  eggs  and salsa and create juicy but intact bites. The tortilla chips give it a crunchy texture in one bite and a chewy texture in another  making it interesting to eat from the beginning to end. You will definitely want to get more than one.  I also tried a cactus and sausage breakfast taco. And by sausage  they mean hotdogs. Just so you know. The texture of cactus is a lot like green pepper  only the flavor is a bit more sour with a sweet aftertaste and the texture a bit more slimy. I liked it. It s like green pepper s more complicated cousin.  The tacos are a bit small  I d definitely recommend ordering more than 1. The line really builds up  so go early if you don t want to wait too long in line or for your food. They make everything fresh  so it s worth the wait.
Veracruz All Natural,251,Veracruz has great tacos. They are a bit fancier than your average fare so they are priced accordingly. Service is quite slow but you can always order ahead online. Their aqua frescas come in a super sized cup.   I m not a fan of their masa for the corn tortillas. In the fish taco  one of my tortillas broke apart almost immediately. Their flour tortillas are much better. But  it pains my heart not to eat corn tortillas as I grew up on LA street tacos. I wouldn t consider these to be authentic but they are tasty.   Lastly  I think their presentation could be better for dine in  as they come wrapped up individually in aluminum foil -- which is both wasteful and ugly. It would be easier  more environmentally friendly  and aesthetically pleasing  to have the tacos fanned out on a plate. Not to mention for 3-5 dollar tacos  they should look pretty darn good as they say   you eat with your eyes first    notigworthy
Veracruz All Natural,252,I give it 2 starts cause of the food being good and the first two times visiting and it being perfect.   Let s say we went for our third time and now see that  they charge the same amount but cut the quesadilla portion by 75 . Then I go and very nicely and discreetly  I ask what happened to the portion size. The young gentleman responded with  that how it s always been . So basically my asking that question was just waiting breath.   Don t got there if you want a lot of food. Portion sizes are reduced drastically  and they will act as if that s how it s always been  I won t be returning and pissed that I spent my money with them.
Veracruz All Natural,253,Incredible tacos   I got the al pastor  chicken mole  and steak tacos and they were all super good. Their salsas are delicious and have a nice kick to them. The guac was so fresh and full of flavor.   I have no complaints about this place I just wish I was able to have it whenever I want 
Veracruz All Natural,254,Hands down  the best tacos I ever ate in my life. I ordered the Fish  Migas  and Fajita Chicken tacos. While all three choices were delicious  my favorite taco would have to be the Migas. I only managed to take one picture of the food  because I couldn t stop eating  I would highly recommend checking Veracruz if you re visiting Austin. I m still thinking about those tacos and it s been two days since I ate there  I also ordered a mango orange smoothie and it was the perfect drink to wash down the food. I would warn people that there is limited seating at this location  so please arrive early if traveling with a large group.
Veracruz All Natural,255,They only do online orders and be prepared to wait an hour for your taco to be made on a Sunday morning. Canceled order. Got refund after arriving. The original location on Cesar Chavez seemed to handle more people with minimal wait.
Veracruz All Natural,256,Yes yes yes.  Vegan tacos are close to the best in Austin. Wow.  Great menu.  Great staff.  Great startup and success story.
Veracruz All Natural,257,Absolutely top notch tacos. Homemade tortillas  awesome salsa and hot sauces. The steak fajita taco and El Pastor would stack up against any in the city. Grab a Mexican come and enjoy.
Veracruz All Natural,258,I was under the impression that these were going to be life changing because my brother had told me so many years ago when he was at UT that these were the best tacos in Austin. They re good don t get me wrong  but certainly not the BEST. I got the al pastor  a torta as well as a fish taco and one of the break feast tacos the la reya. The fish taco was excellent  but the al pastor was not to my taste  it was too saucy. But the torta was very well worth as it had ham. The sauces are A1 though  recommend the avocado.
Veracruz All Natural,259,Tacos are easy to make well  but hard to make exceptional. This trailer parked by a parking lot off Cesar Chavez manages to make some freakin  amazing tacos for like  2- 4 a pop. There s a nice mini-picnic area right outside the truck with a few covered tables to help fight the relentless Texan heat. If that doesn t work  one of the large agua frescas will do the trick for sure.  The tacos are seriously large  2-3 should be good for most people  and come individually wrapped in tin foil. Oh  and don t forget to grab some of the hot sauce from the counter -- the habanero one is dope. I had the Migas  Fish  and Steak. All were solid but the fish and migas were exceptional  and I wish I had space in my stomach for one more of each.
Veracruz All Natural,260,First breakfast taco but best breakfast anything I ve ever had. I don t like scrambled eggs  but this stuff is so flavorful. The chips mixed into the eggs offer a really nice crispy texture.   The smoothies are also really nice. The Queen had a lot of berry seeds. Definitely fresh.
Veracruz All Natural,261,Honestly  this food truck has completely changed my mindset toward breakfast tacos. As someone from Texas I grew up with breakfast tacos every Sunday morning...so I thought eh  what could be special about that. The migas orginales breakfast taco shattered that thought completely. Hands down the best breakfast taco I have had  ever. The flavors and different textures are so wonderfully balanced  I never knew I needed this in my life until my visit  and now I understand why people wait in lines in 100  degree weather for a breakfast taco. I highly recommend and will definitely be back.  Pro tips  1  if you re starving after that wait  make sure to order the chips and guacamole. They give them to you as soon as you order so you have something to munch on while you wait on the tacos  2  you can ask for one agua fresca  highly recommend the mango  to be split into two cups so you can share that goodness with someone you love. Or you can always just get the one 32oz fresca for yourself  because treat yo self. 3  If waiting in lines in the Texas heat isn t your thing they also have 2 brick and motar locations in Austin  so you can at least wait in the AC.
Veracruz All Natural,262,Tacos are pretty good but the quesadillas are amazing. I could really eat one every day. The people working there are friendly and the service is consistent. Great place for a quick lunch or breakfast tacos
Veracruz All Natural,263,Saturday morning in Austin and I had to get some breakfast tacos.  Veracruz All Natural appeared on my radar so I had to try it out.  I got one breakfast taco and one classic taco.   For the breakfast taco I went with the egg and chorizo.  Eggs are slightly overcooked  I prefer my eggs soft and slightly runny  but these eggs are slightly rubbery. Chorizo is okay  but doesn t pack a potent spicy and savory flavor. It was also very finely minced  which made it stand out less as an individual ingredient. Taco is handmade with great corn flavor  but was falling apart under the moisture of all the filling. Despite its shortcomings  this is a satisfactory taco  just not a superior one.   Al Pastor is smothered in sauce. Pork is juicy and tender. Fresh cilantro  onion and avocado add herbal and textural nuance. The corn taco held together here  and again has a great homemade quality. This is a good taco  and gets a solid recommendation.    Overall  Veracruz provides a good taco and is worth trying out.
Veracruz All Natural,264,Visiting from San Diego  where we OBSESS over our tacos  amp  I LOVE THE MIGAS TACO. THE FLAVORS  THE TEXTURE - all breakfast taco dreams came true this morning. Everyone here is friendly  amp  patient  even though I came hella early in the morning. I wasn t even hungry but I had to order a second one for the road.   THANK YOU SO MUCH VERACRUZ 
Veracruz All Natural,265,Look no further because this is the best place for breakfast tacos. Everything about  their food is excellent. But the handmade tortillas is where it s at  The green salsa is delicious as well. If you re not from Austin and you re hesitant about trying a Migas or a breakfast tacos  take it from  a skeptical tourist like myself  give this place a try. I crave it everyday that I am back in Cali and it s so sad that we can t find a place comparable to Veracruz.
Veracruz All Natural,266,Good tacos not worth the wait   There s been a lot of hype around this place so I had to check it out  it s a cool little food truck nestled in east Caesar Chavez. I ve been twice before to check it out but was disappointed to find a 45 minute wait so I left. Today I thought I would wake up early and brave the cold.   I arrived around 9am with no line   just one person in front of me ordering. I over heard her say it will be 25 minutes. Now Their motto is there is fast food and then there is fresh food.  But 25 minutes for breakfast tacos is a bit much.   I ordered one of each of the breakfast tacos. Don t get me wrong they are good tacos but no where near the best breakfast tacos in town. They do have some healthier options  lots of fresh veggies  chilies  avocados  and egg whites. But nothing too special here.   To sum it up again   Good Tacos just not worth the wait.
Veracruz All Natural,267,Didn t disappoint  Migas and the tradicional were soo good. Painless ordering online as well. This is a must for anyone looking for authentic breakfast tacos. Will be back for the rest of the menu for sure 
Veracruz All Natural,268,My husband said  these are the best but there s going to be the a line at this time of day  Miraculously we found a shaded parking spot at Radio and there was no line at Veracruz I tried the LA Reyna and the fish tacos. The  LA reyna was so Savory --full of mushrooms  pico  red peppers  egg whites and spinach. It was just a perfect combination and the fish taco was very good also. About 5 minutes into our tacos the line was 10 long so be prepared to wait. This place is no secrer.
Veracruz All Natural,269,We walked past this food truck and got a whiff of whatever they were cooking. On our way back  we decided to give it a shot since it smelt amazing. Not sure how long we were in line but it did take awhile.   We got the steak fajitas with corn tortillas and they were  awesome. I did find it a bit dry but they have a bunch of house made sauces that paired perfectly.
Veracruz All Natural,270,All their breakfast tacos are Vegan. They tasted alright.. the salsa was what made it. There are better taco trucks out there if you re not on restricted diet.  Service was fine  but the wait was a bit long.
Veracruz All Natural,271,I m not sure what the hype is about but it tasted like average tacos. I stopped by on an early morning around 9 00 a.m. I ordered a few breakfast tacos. I did not find anything special about the tacos. It is something that I could ve easily made  at home. The tacos were also a bit messy to eat because it was falling out everywhere. The stand out of this meal was the fresh watermelon slushie. That was the M.V.P. of the meal.
Veracruz All Natural,272,Food was healthy and delicious. Loved the vegan queso  and I m not vegan . Fresh juice and breakfast tacos...fav breakfast and the food park it is in is really cute as well. Look forward to dining there one day when it s not so hot and covidy outside. I ordered online and they had orders on a table under a heat lamp...easy to grab and go.
Veracruz All Natural,273,Migas poblanos - YES get this. Yum    Migas originales - it s a breakfast taco... nothing special or mind blowing. Don t get the hype.  But the migas poblanos -- so much good flavor  I highly recommend 
Veracruz All Natural,274,CHECK YOUR FOOD IF YOU HAVE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS      My fianc  and I ordered a mole chicken taco and instead of chicken they gave us steak   We didn t realise until after a few bites. After asking the employees what happened  they said they substitute steak when they run out of chicken. This is completely unacceptable and eating steak is against our religion. Unacceptable mistakes and explanation and terrible customer service.
Veracruz All Natural,275,I think I loved the aqua frescas more than my tacos. I had the pineapple agua fresca and it was so refreshing and naturally sweet. They also had mango  strawberry  cucumber  orange  etc and even smoothies.  For the tacos I had to try the migas which some locals in line told my friends and I we have to try while in Austin. It had a scramble egg with avocado  pico de gallo  and then tortilla chips.  The fish taco is another recommendation where the tilapia is lightly breaded. And served with a creamy maybe chipotle sauce on the side. And chopped mango salsa and cabbage.  Then I had to try the steak taco with the works on top.   The sauces on the side is what makes the tacos even better. I loved the green sauce. Creamy with a kick  I put it seriously on everything. My friends got the barbacoa quesadilla.
Veracruz All Natural,276,Migos original taco   flavorful  delicious Berry smoothie   delicious  refreshing  great size
Veracruz All Natural,277,10 10 would recommend. 5 stars. Yes. This may be my favorite review yet I was excited to write it the moment I ate there. I researched the must eat at places in Austin and this was a frequent name on most lists. We stopped by for breakfast and joined the line  long but not terrible . We looked at the menu while we waited and I decided on a Mango Aguas Frescas  Migas Originales and Migas Poblanas  chips and guac. The Migas Originales was definitely my favorite between the two but I loved literally everything I ate. The chips were fresh and homemade  still warm  and tasted like heaven. The guac was amazing and also clearly home made with hearty chunks of avocado.  The corn tortillas are house made and they source their flour locally. Both are toasted  warm  and delicious. The Mango Aguas Frescas...I will dream about this drink until I make it back to Austin. it was indescribably good. It was like a fresh squeezed juice with small chunks of mango and I just honestly couldnt get enough.    I in fact loved it so much that I went out of my way to make a second stop while in Austin for lunch one day. I again got the Mango Aguas Frescas  of course  I split a chicken quesadilla  a fajita chicken taco and fajita steak taco and some more chips and guac. I recommend lunch to but breakfast was definitely my favorite.   There is a decent amount of seating outside at picnic tables and under umbrellas. If you go at a hot time definitely plan to wait but it is worth it. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did 
Veracruz All Natural,278,This was our first stop in Austin  While I thought the bbq was going to be the thing I missed about Austin its actually the tacos  Migas are an Austin staple and Veracruz does them right. They also have a nice variety of fresh juice which is perfect in that Texas sun
Veracruz All Natural,279,Tacos are great  but is it a must  Not too sure  maybe it is because I did not get breakfast tacos  Hardly folks right before closing on a Saturday afternoon. Food took a bit longer than expected  so prepare to wait. There are picnic tables to sit and eat  but I am unsure what it would be like when it is really busy.  Chicken Taco tasted great  but texture wise the chicken was a bit too dry for me. Al Pastor was way better  I could have eaten 3 of those. Watermelon Agua Frescas was perfect in this Austin heat  so definitely get one to pair with your tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,280,I was looking for authentic tacos when I came to Austin and so glad Yelp lead me here. Absolutely delicious tacos and so incredibly cheap. The tacos are on pretty large tortillas and absolutely stuffed with ingredients. I ordered a fish taco so g with the mug as taco and while both were fabulous  I actually preferred the fresh flavors of the fish taco. Highly recommending stopping here but do beware be parking situation is pretty tight.
Veracruz All Natural,281,The tacos from this food truck were the best tasting taco I have ever had. They have breakfast tacos that are unbelievable I couldn t even tell you what was on it. A mix of eggs. Potato s avoxados and more. I got 2 tacos the 2 most popular and a mango drink they make by hand. Line was out of the gate and wait was about 25 minutes at about 11am. Worth the wait. A place that you must try. Tacos are about  3.50 and they are damn gooD. Very impressed.
Veracruz All Natural,282,I ve had breakfast tacos before and didn t like them but I m SO GLAD I tried again  Veracruz has THE BEST BREAKFAST TACOS  I miss them so much  You can choose what goes in  sort of a la carte  Great size got full of of two. I didn t exactly love the outside seating. Lots of birds and weathered  but the food is definitely a go to      ALSO  The directions are off. It will get you close but we had to do some circling to find it 
Veracruz All Natural,283,My friend said that Veracruz is a MUST in Austin so we came early for breakfast tacos right before going to Hamilton Pools. They were worth waking up early for  I ordered the migas and the al pastor. Both were great  but I was feeling the migas more. The mix of eggs and tortilla chips were the perfect combo. Also  I loved that each of their tacos came with a slice of avocado. Even better than that  were their salsas. They have a couple creamier sauces and one salsa with chunks of avocado. I ve never seen that before but anything with salsa and avocado can t be bad and it wasn t   Veracruz is located right next to a Shell with limited parking spaces. We ve driven past Veracruz several times during the day and there was always a long line. It seems like early mornings are the best time to go since there was hardly anyone there when we went. Overall  I think Veracruz  may be some serious competition for nearby Juan in a Million for breakfast tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,284,I came here for breakfast tacos and I ordered a juice. Everything is delicious. I don t think you can go wrong here. Arrive early and be prepared to wait. It is worth it  
Veracruz All Natural,285,Steak tacos are  thumbs up emoji  Strawberry agua fresca are  bomb emoji  AF All their salsas are  100 emoji   Really can t go wrong w Veracruz tacos. The taco was perfect  just the right amount of steak  cilantro  onions. Not too big and not too small. You know how I know this  The taco was a substantial size while still allowing me to wrap the tortilla  not just fold  and almost nothing fell out  only an onion or two .  The Agua Fresca..... Oh my Lord. Sooooooo refreshing and not too sweet and no artificial taste at all. And they serve it in a huge cup. You can get a Starbucks drink  half the size  for the same price or more.  So worth.
Veracruz All Natural,286,We came here based on the yelp reviews but these tacos were overrated in my opinion.  Barbacoa was the best I had but was bordering on being too salty to eat.  The steak taco was pretty tough and not tender at all.  Our experience here was pretty ordinary and would not return.
Veracruz All Natural,287,First Austin food truck experience and what a great choice we made. I mean come on  breakfast tacos   What a revelation.  Naturally we had to try the Migas taco  eggs  crushed tortilla chips  avocado  cheese   which has been recognized in the  top 5 best tacos in America . What an achievement  I m don t think I will every forget that first bite... these tacos are legit     MUST TRY.   The fish taco here is also pretty damn good. Sometimes a fish taco can lack flavor as typically tilapia is a bland fish  but this was far from that However  the Al Pastor taco was a bit disappointing.   Next to the pick up point is a little table where you collect sauce. One is green  the other is red and there is also a salsa. I ve had both green and red said with Mexican food before but there are something else. So punchy and full of flavor. They really complete the taco. And the salsa is unreal.   To summarize  those Migas tacos are so damn good I came back the next day. To fulfill all your breakfast taco dreams  go here  
Veracruz All Natural,288,Alton Brown ranks this place as the best Migas taco in America and he isn t wrong  I like that the food truck has plenty of shaded seating around it. I also think it s a perfect combo of the wild flavors of Torchy s but without the grease  amp  keeps the ingredients fresh with great tortillas like Taco Joint.
Veracruz All Natural,289,I have to say after viewing quite a bit of travelers blogs before coming here I m super pleased with the experience.  Even though we waited quite a bit of time for tacos  it was worth the wait.  Highly recommend this place if you are in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,290,MOST WHOLESOME TACOS IN ALL THE LAND.  I had the pleasure of trying Veracruz All Natural the other day when I stopped by one of my favorite coffee shops that was serving their breakfast tacos - Fleet Coffee - and I was blown away. Their tacos are so soft and it tastes like every ingredient has been picked fresh from a garden that very day and used in your taco. The Migas Poblanas taco stole my heart with its soft eggs and sweet peppers  among other ingredients   but I m sure there s much more to love on the menu  and I can t wait to give it a try. This place is certainly a 10 10 for me  but if you don t trust my judgement  just know that their Migas taco was named a Top 5 Taco in America   
Veracruz All Natural,291,Decent tacos  I m normally a meat taco gal  but I decided to go with the more breakfast friendly tacos when I came around Austin for a friends birthday. Tacos are a bit small for what you pay  3-4  for a breakfast taco  usually a tiny bit cheaper elsewhere  but you can definitely tell the level of care they put into making them. Not the first place I would go when the craving strikes  but definitely up there 
Veracruz All Natural,292,I found my favorite tacos here  They are authentic and flavorful. This place has 3 unique home made sauces to add on  salsa  green chili sauce and red chilli sauce. I can t handle much spice but they were so tasty on their own. The tacos I tried were the fish taco  pulled pork taco and beef taco. The fish taco has more ingredients than the other two and I ended up ordering this twice. The other two taco s are also really good  I liked the beef better. The beef quesadilla was our favorite  and would highly recommend trying along with the tacos. In regards to drinks  the agua fresca drinks I tried was cucumber  watermelon  and mango.  They make it fresh and tastes like flavoured water. In terms of strength of flavor from strongest to least  it would be cucumber  watermelon and lastly mango.
Veracruz All Natural,293,Gimme all  Yes  all their tacos  with guacamole and chips. I m not sure how torchys is more popular. This food truck is the answer to tacos . Period. Please do yourself a favor- order guac and chips. I never ordered them until a friend did and I tried. I was momentarily ashamed of myself for missing out on all that guac the n number of times I was here. Praise the person who establishes this food truck  
Veracruz All Natural,294,Great tacos that definitely are a bit pricy but well worth the costT. Be prepared to spend a good amount if you want to be full   2-3 tacos   Migas Poblano Taco was hyped up on Yelp but honestly fell a little bit flat - the egg was not that flavorful unique  and I think I was supposed to dip it in a sauce to give it the flavor that it needed rather than eat it solo.  Every other taco  Ranging from the La Reyna  vegetarian taco was really well-cooked vegetables   to the Fish Al Pastor Fajita Steak  the tacos are absolutely delicious. Probably some of the best tacos I have had so far in Texas  unless you re talking about  1-2 Mexican street tacos which are honestly in a different level of competition.   Tip s   Parking here is very limited  several spaces   and it can take a while to get food. Be ready to get here early if you want to avoid the line  Also  if you re getting the agua fresca  ask if they can split it in 2 if you re with another person - the single drink by itself is a lot more than you think.
Veracruz All Natural,295,Veracruz All Natural has some pretty good tacos  but I ll admit that mine didn t quite compete with what I m used to in Dallas.   Star 1  How were the service and atmosphere   It s difficult for a food cart to really portray an atmosphere  but Veracruz has friendly people and reasonably fast service. I ordered  got my number  was seated  and had my tacos maybe ten minutes later. What more could I ask for  Star Granted.   Star 2  How were the portions relative to the cost   Some of my favorite tacos back in Dallas come in just under the  2.00 mark  and my favorite street tacos from Sugar Skull Cafe   a href  http   www.yelp.com biz sugar-skull-cafe-dallas  yelp.com biz sugar-skull   a   come in at  2.25. Veracruz upsells things a bit by charging  2.00 for breakfast tacos and  2.50 for regular tacos  which  in all honesty  is a bit expensive. Sure  these tacos are sizable as you can see in the pics  but in that I m not receiving an atmosphere of any kind am I really getting what I ve paid for here  After much deliberation  I decided that had Veracruz charged a cent over  2.50 for their street tacos I d have a real issue  but with the breakfast tacos being only  2.00  that brings the average down to  2.25  which is fine. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4  How was the food   So I snagged two tacos  and one was good while the other not so much. I ll start with the corn tortillas  which I was a big fan of. The flavor and fact that they were freshly made complimented my first barbacoa taco nicely  and kudos to Veracruz for using generous portions of tasty meats in addition to the standard cilantro and onions.   The breakfast taco on the other hand  sausage and egg  was a real disappointment. The eggs were flavorless and a bit runny while the sausage tasted no different from standard cut up oscar meyer sausage. I won t claim that was actually the case  but this was a weak taco. One good one bad  Single Star Granted.   Star 5  Would you eat here every day if you could   Veracruz isn t bad  but in a state where tacos are king  my experience didn t quite live up to the competition. Either a better price point or stronger breakfast tacos  mix it up with some triple ingredient options   would really do the place some good. No Star Granted.
Veracruz All Natural,296,Great service  very covid conscious safety measures  and polite. Got my order on time and both the horchata and carne asada tacos were amazing  I also tried the vegan queso and it was delicious although there s no beating real cheese. Definitely recommend 
Veracruz All Natural,297,Hands down the best vegetarian tacos in Austin. They just tasted so authentic and the burst of flavor in every ingredient was what I needed. I was skeptical about the lack of black beans in the taco but I didn t even miss them. The veggies went perfectly with the flavors even the roasted carrot pieces  We went here twice in the span of two days because these tacos just couldn t be beat anywhere else. My mouth still waters just thinking about them.... I know that sounds made up but it s actually the truth.
Veracruz All Natural,298,So. Good.  Food  Delicious. All the breakfast tacos  so cheap too    steak with the works  migas migas migas  and the chicken mole. Everything is good. And fresh. And good. Cannot emphasize how good this place is. Having only been to Austin twice  and in both trips  I ve made a trip to this truck. And I can pretty much foresee all my future trips to Austin with a stop at this place. Brought the boyfriend from SF  who has had his fair share of endless tacos in every neighborhood  and even he can t stop talking about the migas. The drinks too  The Berry Good smoothie is so fresh.  Service  Friendly  They ll let you know the wait time before you order so you can see if you want to stay. STAY.  Ambiance  Outdoors with picnic tables and huge straw umbrellas. Cute place  The wait is no joke for just some tacos though. Like others have mentioned  it can range from 15 to 30 mins. On a Saturday  brunch time  the wait is about 35-40 mins for 3 tacos... which is a little sad considering we devoured the tacos in five mins... But yes  when you order  definitely get 2 tacos for each person  That way you can try more  and leave feeling full minorly stuffed. We had plans to eat elsewhere very soon afterwards so we only ordered 3.  Go   Go  
Veracruz All Natural,299,My favorite breakfast taco spot in Austin  I always get the el tradicional which includes egg  cheese  bacon  refried beans and potato. The sizes are pretty big...Two tacos get me full    I also recommend the green salsa and a horchata to keep you cool from the spice 
Veracruz All Natural,300,Lives up to the hype. The migas breakfast tacos are the real deal  so much so they d make Guy Fieri blush. Big fan of their salsas and chips as well  always fresh  hot  and perfectly crispy. Never had a bad item here  and if you go to their location at Radio  nice patio while you wait for the food  does take a minute  but can t rush perfection  and you can grab a beer or coffee from the lovely coffee shop. A   10 10  bravo 
Veracruz All Natural,301,Fantastic migas and breakfast tacos. I really wanted to come back on my last day in Austin  but alas  it was closed due to  severe weather   come on guys  don t be such wimps .  The 32oz watermelon aqua frescas were also awesome  not sure if you can request less ice... .
Veracruz All Natural,302,One of my favorite taco spots in Austin. Their migas are the best in Austin by far and they make their own tortillas. Amazing x 1000  Love their natural juices  horchata   are a must too. They don t have queso but I love their guacamole 
Veracruz All Natural,303,Always hits the spot and brightens my day. Fresh ingredients  great service  sometimes there s a wait but good things are worth waiting for.
Veracruz All Natural,304,Got the Migas Originales  Poblanas  La Reyna  and did the Chorizo w eggs for breakfast. Nothing memorable. Had the La Bomba juice and La Ley smoothie too. The drinks were the saving grace. Did not see what the hype was - would not last in LA.   Pulled up to the parking lot and knew this wasn t it because of all the patrons being gueros. Hipster gringo approved.
Veracruz All Natural,305,Probably the best tacos I ve ever had. The mole tacos are so good. Sometimes they re all sold out but when they have them  they re super good.
Veracruz All Natural,306,Best tacos I ve ever had. 40 min wait was worth it.  Migas   MUST get. Single best taco in the universe. Add some of the yellow-ish pepper sauce on top and you re good to go.   Fish taco   Also SO SO good. I wasn t in the mood for it  but I got it anyway bc the reviews said it was one of the best. I have to agree with that. Fish was cooked just perfectly. Chipotle sauce and a squeeze of lime added some nice extra flavor.  Chips and Guacamole   Chips were thick and amazing. Guac was good  but nothing super special. Perfect snack to keep my belly happy until tacos were ready.  Tried a bite of my parents  Al Pastor and Fajita Steak tacos and I wish I had gotten the Steak  only bc I was more in the mood for that vs fish . Meat was so tender  with great flavor.  See you again when I m back in Austin  Veracruz Tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,307,Best tacos ever   Beware  this place always has a line and it can sometimes be hard to find a place to sit. But the tacos are so worth it  Everything I have tried here has been amazing. I took my brother here when he visited town and he was super impressed as well.  Their meat is tender and the flavors go together so nicely and beautifully. And it doesn t make you feel gross afterwards - everything is fresh and delicious. I don t think I ve had a better taco in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,308,You gotta try the Migas tacos  It says Migas is one of the top 5 tacos in America and I really think it s that good   I usually don t crave breakfast tacos much  but this is exception. Tortilla chips and pico de gallo add so much flavor to this taco   There could be 10-30 mins wait depends on the time you go but I don t mind. I went in at 8 am on Saturday and there was no line. When I went on Saturday noon  there was bout 30 min wait total. It s still cheaper and faster than going to the restaurant and satisfy me enough   
Veracruz All Natural,309,Got here on a Sunday at noon and the line was 12 deep. Line moves fairly quickly. If you can t find parking  which you probably cant in the lot  there is parking on the street to the left of the gas station.  The migas is definitely the show stopper here. It is loaded with a bunch of goodness. I love the tortilla strips inside that give it that crunch. Portion size is pretty big in my opinion. 5  5  Another good taco was the fish taco  The wife loved it more than the migas. 4.5  5  Fajita taco 4  5  Al Pastor taco - Was not flavorful. Tasted bland. 2.5  5   Chips and salsa was good. Chips are thick crunchy and homemade. The salsa was really good. You can get more salsa at the condiment station where you pick up your food.  Mango Aqua Fresca was a let down. It tasted like water  except it was an orange yellow color. Not sweet at all  They claim they use real fruits  well if they do  they need to taste the fruit to make sure it s sweet or in season. Waste of  4   The Berry Good smoothie was really good though  I d order that again or try another smoothie.
Veracruz All Natural,310,Looongggg wait.   First  stood in line about 15 minutes.   After ordering  it was another good 25 to 30 minutes before our food was ready. I m glad we had ordered the chips and salsa  because they give those to you first  so we munched on them while we waited.  This location is outdoors with limited seating  so either be prepared to Harper and wait for a table  or eat in your car.    The food itself is great. The Miga was voted top five taco in the US by Food Network.  It s a breakfast taco with egg  tortilla chips  avocado  pico de gallo  and Monterey Jack cheese. I thought this was the best taco  though they were all great.  Taco al pastor-flavorful marinated pork  enough marinade that you might not need any of the extra sauces.  Agua Fresca- this is essentially free juice. We got the mango. It looks like the watermelon was also very popular.  Fish tacos-Four of us got fish tacos  and we all thought the Pork al pastor tacos were better.  Steak taco and steak quesadilla-both were good.    I m tempted to take away one star because of the long wait  but really  this place is five stars.
Veracruz All Natural,311,OMG  could there be tastier tacos  The breakfast tacos here are to die for. The most tender egg  yes  I never thought egg could taste different  but it can. The most velvety  tender eggs and soft tortillas danced in my mouth as I enjoyed my breakfast taco dipped in their homemade sauces. I also got the al pastor  which was good mmmm...tender pork  juicy pineapple and a slice of creamy avocado. I m salivating just writing this review. I brought a few friends from out of town who tried the chicken and steak tacos and a torta. Both said their choices were spectacular and there were definitely no leftovers from any of us. We finished our meals  off with a big glass of aqua fresca. Very refreshing on a hot summer day.  My only piece of advice  do not go in the 100 degree afternoon heat. It is by a little gas station and outdoors so if you are not going to take it to go  it will be miserable eating your delicious tacos outside. I cannot wait to go back as the weather cools down.
Veracruz All Natural,312,This place is amazing. The best tacos I ve had in Austin.   We tried the Agua Fresca - mango flavor  ask for less sugar.   The guacamole - very nice freshly fried chips. Suggest mixing in the red hot sauce to make it a bit spicier.   The Migas breakfast taco with chorizo added. Nicely prepared and the tacos are large. They suggested 2. But I was fine with just one.   Ample outdoor seating  but I m sure it s very busy in the summer. They also have  radio playing Latin music which is a nice touch.   Lastly be mindful of the birds   They are someone s meal while they were getting napkins. They also tried quite a few containers of hot sauce   Which was funny but probably unsanitary.   Definitely worth the excursion from downtown 
Veracruz All Natural,313,Went to the food truck on a Sunday for breakfast tacos at the Mueller location. I got the Migas taco and the El Traditional taco. The man at the register was very helpful in helping me decide which tacos to get so I appreciated that. I LOVED the migas taco. The eggs were not dry at all  it was super flavorful  and just an overall good  yet non-greasy  breakfast taco. I didn t love the El traditional taco for a couple reasons  1. the flavor of the bacon overpowered the entire taco  2. the refried beans were part mushed and part whole and I wish they all would have been mushed. We waited about 18 minutes for our tacos which was expected given the fact that it was Sunday and the farmers market was right next door.  I wish they would continue online ordering on the weekends   
Veracruz All Natural,314,Really great tacos  Went for breakfast and beat the crowds by getting here a little bit before 10 on a Saturday. We got the migos poblanos breakfast tacos  chorizo potato egg  chicken mole tacos  and an all pastor  all on corn tortillas and they were amazing. So filling  amazing sauces  and quick service. Also got chips and guacamole  amp  a la bomba juice which were very good  Definitely a good place to stop on your visit to Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,315,Hard to believe I ve been in Austin this long and finally got around to trying Veracruz. Heard so many great things  so today the wife and I took the trek out to East Austin to come grab some tacos. They re really fast about making the tacos and having them out but its clearly freshly made.  We tried the fish taco  an al pastor  and two migas tacos with a watermelon agua fresca. Gotta say these are really good. The migas particularly you can tell they make it with a lot of pride - freshly fried tortilla strips make a world of difference in the tacos. The egg and avocado play backseat to that in a nice textural medley. Add some of their smoky salsa and you re good to go. Hard to believe something that good could be vegetarian.  The fish taco is also pretty good - rare to have a non-fried fish taco  but it tastes clean  not too salty with the cabbage providing the crunch. The al pastor comes topped with avocado too - not used to that  but it has definite smoky notes. I wish there was a bit more charring on the al pastor though - it tastes more strongly of braised pork shoulder than it does with the crispy edgy bits that I ve come to love on it.  Agua fresca comes in a big gulp type cup and it s fresh as can be. Not too sweet and about as refreshing as it gets especially as Austin approaches summer.  That said  great as these tacos are  contrary to what some other reviews say  they re not actually all that big. Not the cheapest lunch if you need 3 to fill you up but once and a while  I d be happy to pay that for lunch.
Veracruz All Natural,316,Not a fan of tacos  especially street tacos.. I just don t understand eating meat and onions wrapped in a tortilla.. but  this place has changed my opinion about tacos in general  LOVED IT. Veggies were cooked perfectly  their sauce was amazing  chicken was very yummy too. Vegetarian options are available  They were able to adjust the proportions of ingredients in my smoothie to my liking as well  without giving me a side eye for being a  complicated  customer . Easy parking and cute wooden tables to sit at. Definitely one of my go to spots in Austin now  
Veracruz All Natural,317,The Perfect migas was well worth the absurd wait  there was a small line  too .  Migas  CORN   3.50  Subtotal  3.50 Sales Tax  8.25    0.29  Total  3.79
Veracruz All Natural,318,I finally made it to Veracruz All Natural. My verdict - the migas TOTALLY deserve all the hype. Tied for  1 for me amongst Austin migas. What makes these migas so good are the house made corn tortillas - both the chewy crisp chips cooked in with the eggs and other ingredients and the fresh tortilla wrapped around the hot  tasty ingredients.  As an aside  these migas share a trait with my other favorites at Cocina de Consuela. Both cook the chips to just the right consistency  kind of al dente  like you d find in chilaquiles  which are a close cousin of migas . Of course  it also helps that the tacos are freshly cooked to order  a fundamental to any good taco.  Like any good migas  these don t really need salsa because the salsa s all included inside - jalapenos  tomatoes  onions and cilantro. Nevertheless  I had to try all 3 salsas and they were good. For you Taco Deli fans  Veracruz s green salsa is basically the same as La Dona. My wife concurred on the excellence of the migas. I also had a taco al pastor. It was good  but nothing out of the ordinary  especially in the shadow of the migas.  At  3 each  the migas tacos are almost free  Next time  I ll get two for sure  maybe even 3. There was a bit of a line when we arrived about 9 45 and it grew steadily while we waited and ate. I m sure it only gets longer as the morning goes on but it s totally worth it. Veracruz is about 20 minutes from my house but it s definitely going to be a regular destination from now on.
Veracruz All Natural,319,Best breakfast tacos  Ever. And the smoothie I got was also amazing. Ok Go. Stop reading this review and just check it out yourself. And maybe take a walk back to downtown Austin as you will likely eat too much.
Veracruz All Natural,320,Even on a cold December morning  it s worth waiting for a meal at this centrally located taco truck. Veracruz usually has a line but it was short today  and food comes out fast once you ve ordered. They take cards and there s a little seating area outside the truck  We decided to try the famous Migas taco  breakfast tacos  and el pastor taco. They re all cheap and additional toppings cost 50 cents. Everything was good  but I felt the breakfast taco with egg  cheese  potatoes and bacon was the best. Of the hundreds of breakfast taco varieties here  this setup is my favorite. They also offer fresh made fruit drinks which would certainly hit the spot in the summer.
Veracruz All Natural,321,pulled an all-nighter to go early. I tried their famous migas breakfast tacos and they re famous for a reason  Everything was delicious and hot- definitely worth the lack of sleep. Some people say it s a bit pricey but it s definitely worth the price and they re very stuffed. Only downside is that they close early   
Veracruz All Natural,322,Talk about a high class taco truck - it s equipped with its own buzzer system  On top of being at the top of its game when it comes to logistics  the tacos are near perfect  and the flavors are elevated to an  out of this world  category when it comes to its house made roasted green chili salsa w chunks of avocado. If only they provided larger cups... the scooping of the sauce into the tiny cups can be be cumbersome but ohh soo worth it   Get the migas  al pastor  chicken mole and any combo of breakfast taco - you won t be let down - and make sure to try the different sauces. We weren t asked whether we wanted flour or corn tortillas  instead all of our tacos came on flour which is the default vessel of choice. If you have a preference  make sure to speak up.  NOTE  Given the size of the  kitchen   it takes a good 20-30 minutes before you receive your order if you happen to go  during the major meal times. Just like any other sit down restaurant  the buzz will ring  and you should proceed to the window on the right side of the motor home  to pick up your order. If you order a fresca  those will will be called out of the window to the left of the ordering window whenever they are ready. The drinks are huge and  4  they ll surely quench your thirst after consuming multiple tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,323,In need of tacos after a long night of drinking and in need of some hangover grub  In need of a quintessential Austin food truck experience  In need of a semi-quick breakfast but still up there in quality  This place has you covered. Delicious  fresh tacos with seating outside for you to enjoy. It is definitely an Austin favorite  for seldom you come here without there being a line. But the wait goes by quickly and is well worth it.   Came here with friends for an Austin food trip and it did not disappoint. Will come back again.
Veracruz All Natural,324,My very fav taco place. I crave these. They got tha recipe game down   Super covid informed services. I m a regular and it s fantastic every time. I just wish they d bring their regular salsa back online.  5 Star  Best vegetarian tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,325,Really freakin good. There was a 20 minute line on a Friday during lunch hour. We got several tacos but the best was the steak fajita. 3.75 5. Great seasoning and fresh. Skip the chips and get an extra taco. The mole one is fun but intense and rich. The fish one was not that great. The tilapia had an intense seafood taste that I always think of being associAted with thawed seafood that s been sitting in that liquid for a bit. Sure it wasn t spoiled or anything just not 100  fresh. They have some seating that can get limited but turnover on the tables is quick. Also some seating in the back near the bbq food truck. Afterwards walk a couple blocks down and catch the lady bird loop trail to burn off some of what you ate. Or do the total opposite and walk a couple blocks in the opposite direction and grad some brews at Zilker brewery
Veracruz All Natural,326,Legit breakfast tacos aka Migas. Queue was long and also slow but what do you expect for a food truck. Can t say it was worth the wait considering I m from the capital  SD  of monster breakfast burritos but it was a nice experience. The service was great and the people working the window were cool AF and accommodating to the patrons with questions. If you don t mind waiting Veracruz is legit.
Veracruz All Natural,327,This place has some of the best tacos that I ve ever had.  I m a California native  spending many years in the Central Valley and in Southern California.  So I good Mexican food.  These tacos...are actually pretty damn amazing.  My friend from Austin recommended that I try this place during my visit and I m so happy I did.  I ll be back 
Veracruz All Natural,328,They use QR code to see the menu and only allow online orders. The food is really good and the outside patio is great. I also ordered a Pineapple Agua Fresca  and it was amazing. The only downside was waiting 15 minutes for my Agua to come out after I got my food. Luckily I had water.
Veracruz All Natural,329,Hands down the best breakfast tacos  the Migas and the poblanos migas are my favorite. Right now with Covid you can place your order online and then just pick it up and eat on the picnic tables. The guacamole was just average but everything else was delicious.
Veracruz All Natural,330,Tried two of the Migas Originales for breakfast and found them to be highly mediocre. There wasn t enough egg or protein  and they weren t very savory. This was all after a 20 minute line and subsequent 35 minute wait. I m also convinced this meal was also responsible for significant digestive issues the next day. The only bright side was the chips  amp  guac. I wouldn t return.
Veracruz All Natural,331,Another food truck with its own little garden in the Austin area  The sign touts its migas taco as being one of the top 5 tacos in the US  so naturally the place can get kind of busy. We arrived around 9 45 for breakfast  and just missed a long line.  In addition to tacos   3  they also do fresh juices and smoothies   4-6   which are really great value as they are huge.  Taco wise  I had the migas  fish and pork.  Migas - I can legit see why this is one of the top 5 in America. I ve no idea how they get so much flavour into the egg  which is the main player in the dish   but they manage it. Seriously delicious  flavorful  and also pretty hefty in its own right  2 of these could easily fill you.  Fish - this is made with tilapia  and is definitely one of the better fish tacos I ve had in my life. Great texture and crispy  with a good zesty flavor. Not as good as the migas  but a great taco.  Pork - slightly disappointed  given that I m a lover of all things pig. Not that it was a bad taco  more that the migas was so good  and I expected my love of all things pig to compound that even further. For me it was lacking slightly in flavor and just didn t have that punch I was expecting.  Overall  great little value spot. Good selection of tacos and really tasty fresh juices - If you re serious about tacos  honestly I d go for the migas - although the other fillings are worth a try.
Veracruz All Natural,332,Finally finally finally made it Veracruz  I ve heard the buzz about this place and have been wanting to try it out since moving to Austin. Every time I ve driven by on the way to work the line has been so long and I d read reviews that mentioned 45 minute wait times  Not going to lie  this dissuaded me a bit. Were these tacos really worth waiting for 45 minutes in the Texas summer heat  In my experience yes  but also no..  I convinced my coworker to make the walk to Veracruz hoping that I didn t just make her walk ten minutes to stand in line and then wait. But  when we got there we were able to walk right up and order. We were told that our wait time was about half an hour  but it ended up being just over 10 minutes. I ordered the migas and the al pastor. From what I d heard the migas was what they were so famous for and al pastor is a go to for me. I honestly have never understood the notion of putting tortilla chips on a taco but wow that migas was amazing  And the al pastor was one of the best I ve had  And I feel like I can say this confidently since I order it every time it s available   I ll definitely be back to try more of their tacos and maybe a smoothie as well  However  I ve got to be honest  if it looks like an hour wait in the sun  I d probably keep driving..
Veracruz All Natural,333,Fajita tacos  amp  Al Pastor tacos were on our plates today and gone in a flash  You will not be disappointed. We wanted the salsa but they were out today. Perhaps next time we will try it. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did 
Veracruz All Natural,334,I was visiting Austin with a friend and since we were staying in the neighborhood  we stopped by Veracruz to grab some breakfast the first morning we were in town.  I was a little hesitant as we were walking up.  I had never gotten a taco out of a school bus before  but there was a crowd and line so obviously there was a reason.  I got a super basic breakfast taco.  Literally just eggs and potatoes in a flour tortilla.  Place my order  grabbed a seat and waited to have our number called.  We got a little packet wrapped in foil and it was a decent size. I hungrily dug in and my eyes lit up.  The tortilla had so much flavor and was warm and delicious.  The potatoes were soft but seasoned nicely  and the eggs were very obviously cooked to order.  I loved every bite and had to to back the next morning to get another one.  By far the best  5 I spent the entire trip.  Yes  that is  2.50 per taco.  Run  don t walk.
Veracruz All Natural,335,My favorite taco spot while visiting Austin. I m so glad I made this place a priority and you should too  I ordered the Migas and La Reyna and the flavor and freshness from the natural ingredients delivered in every bite. I didn t even stop to take a photo because I didn t want to stop eating. Don t forget to add the salsa from the coolers   If you can  beat the lines by coming on a weekday.
Veracruz All Natural,336,When in Austin  you have to get breakfast tacos  This food trailer was amazing  This was our last bite in Austin before we went to the airport  and it definitely did not disappoint.   The food trailer is located in a trailer park with another bbq trailer. They have their own tables for their section. They have a pretty extensive menu of tacos  so there s bound to be something for everyone.   The homemade corn tortillas were delicious  Warm and fluffy and went so well with the taco filling. You can opt for one of their taco creations or you can build your own  either way  it will be delicious  And don t forget to get some homemade agua frescas as well    They have mild and spicy hot sauce that are all made in-house and taste delicious  Get the spicy one as it gives the breakfast tacos a really good kick    Definitely a must try when in Austin 
Veracruz All Natural,337,Yummy tacos for really worth the price   We ordered the breakfast taco  migas taco  fish taco  and steak fajita. I would say you can pass on the steak fajita because it was overcooked. The fish and breakfast was my favorite. For the breakfast taco you can choose two items and we chose chorizo and egg. Yummmm we ll be back for more  
Veracruz All Natural,338,When you wait 35 minutes for some smoothies  the cashier will not be kind or willing to give your money back. This is actually a pool bar  and the bartender is responsible for all the drinks. It is right off the street and seems like a good place to cool down but DO NOT GO HERE if you are thirsty.
Veracruz All Natural,339,Migas is everything. All the food here is great  but the breakfast tacos is where they really shine. And do not miss the amazing salsas.   You can walk right up on a weekday at 1 pm. Saturdays are a completely different story. That aside  this is a must stop breakfast place in Austin and the wait is worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,340,This is actually a review of the Veracruz Food Truck outside of the newly opened Radio on S. Lamar. I am not 100  sure if it is the same truck as the E Cesar Chavez or an additional  but I am guessing the food and offerings are the same.    I had actually heard a lot of good things about the tacos here  especially the tilapia  and when I found out they had mole tacos  I had to try them for myself.  I ordered 3 tacos  their infamous Migas  lived up to the hype   their tilapia fish taco w chipotle sauce and mango salsa  also lived up to the hype   sadly the only taco that was disappointing for me was the chicken mole. The mole was a little on the bland side and a bit pastey  but I am a mole snob  I like my mole with a creamy texture and the perfect balance of spice and chocolate.     The prices are a little pricey for the size of the taco you get  my 3 tacos came to  11.92  however  you can tell they use quality ingredients and everything tasted fresh.    My only other complaint was it took FOREVER for me to get my tacos. I was given a number and went at sat at a nearby bench outside  but literally after almost 20mins I finally had to go up to the trailer and ask what the hold up was. The guy was nice  but seemed to be overwhelmed and acted like my order had either been backlogged or forgotten altogether as right when I was walking back to my bench a couple who had ordered after me were being served their 4 tacos  2 each  respectively   so that was a bit off-putting. But  when I finally did get my tacos almost 30mins later they were hot and tasted freshly prepared.
Veracruz All Natural,341,Please  can someone wrap these tacos up and bring them to NYC    I m originally from California and it s was so easy to get delicious tacos. Now  Deprived of good Mexican food in Manhattan. Veracruz was my first taco stop and I honestly didn t even care for the breakfast tacos. All I wanted was Al Pastor.   The boy and I got the migas taco  al pastor  and an agua fresca. There s just something about these little tacos that is currently making my mouth water even just thinking about them.   The show stopper  The GIANT Agua Fresca that renewed my sense of self. Jk  I don t know what that means but really  it was incredibly delicious. Exactly like the agua fescas I had way back when I travelled to Mexico City.   Highly recommend you stop by 
Veracruz All Natural,342,Veracruz All Natural has some delicious tacos at this truck location. I got the fajita chicken and fajita steak since I had already had eggs that morning and I really do wish I had gotten the migas because I had a bite of my husband s and it was delicious. The tortilla chip inside the taco is genius if you ask me. The chips and salsa were delicious--the chips were crunchy without being greasy and we had a great meal overall. My only complaint is that they need to put some tread on their platform to from their ordering window because it was muddy and a ton of people were slipping. It was really dangerous  Other than that  we had a great experience.
Veracruz All Natural,343,Barbacoa tacos and cantaloupe aqua fresca was amazing  The meat was flavorful and tender  tacos were like two tacos in one.
Veracruz All Natural,344,Breakfast tacos were good. Enjoyed the salsa and chips. Also got some decent quesadillas.
Veracruz All Natural,345,I have not had a breakfast taco prior to this visit and Veracruz has probably ruined the ability for ANY other breakfast taco to compare. I wasn t planning on getting a breakfast taco  but a friendly stranger shared that she was visiting Austin as I was and was making her second trip to Veracruz since she landed the day before. She recommended both breakfast tacos and I ll never forget her. I shared a breakfast taco on corn tortilla  fish taco on corn tortilla  steak taco on corn tortilla  and a watermelon-cucumber drink. It was all incredibly tasty. They all were packed full of flavor that taco trucks do well  but maintained a juicy cleanness about them that most don t. The corn tortilla was perfectly fresh and hot. The size were new to me  but very appreciated as they were on the larger side. I regret not getting more or going more. Highly recommended  everything was good.
Veracruz All Natural,346,Came here with a friend in the afternoon and there was no wait   We got Migas  fish  and chicken mole tacos and I was blown away. The Migas is phenomenal. I ve been waiting to find the best taco in Austin and I know that this is it. The different textures with the tortilla and chips is delicious. Super flavorful.   Bonus  the Skinny smoothie is also super refreshing 
Veracruz All Natural,347,Veracruz is  without a doubt  one of the better tacos in Austin. The al pastor is delicious  breakfast tacos are good too.   Having said that  what really stands out to me as an underrated or underreported bright spot on their menu is their Torta with fajita steak. Wow  Great flavor  super tasty and honestly a better value at 8 bucks for a much larger and filling portion of food than a 3 dollar taco. It s definitely worth a try if you re looking for something new to try from a familiar Austin food truck bus. I highly recommend it.   Another important thing I have to give them credit for. The offerings of salsa are all so good. That s one thing a lot of other places neglect  watery  bland and flavorless. Veracruz salsas are always well seasoned  with varying levels of heat  and they actually enhance and brighten the flavors of the food you put them on.   I gotta ding one star on cleanliness  numerous times I ve visited  the tables eating are can be a little sticky and unkept. Salsa is kept in a small cooler  which I appreciate  but it can get a little messy sometimes as well. Parking can be really rough... not an exaggeration here. Their lot has like 6 spaces and seems to have been the victim of a meteor shower at some point. There are more potholes here than flat ground. Park a block behind and walk around.
Veracruz All Natural,348,Best breakfast taco in Austin  come for the Migas  Call in your order ahead of time to avoid the wait.   Came here during lunch once on a Sunday and was told 25 minutes til my tacos would be ready. I learned for the next time and called ahead - no wait  But tacos are well worth it   
Veracruz All Natural,349,Extremely delicious  I love everything about here  If you go to Austin definitely to have to eat at this place  very clean and they are really fast with the food.
Veracruz All Natural,350,Maybe my favorite taco place in town. Heard it had good ratings but needed to try for myself..literally the best migas taco I ve ever tried  Good value  good guac  good vibes. Freshly squeezed agua Fresca is pretty tasty. Although  seating and lines can be a problem if you get there at the wrong time. If you don t want to wait around  it s right next to kerlins bbq  flat track coffee  and not to far from Juan in a million.   Definitely coming back here soon to get more migas tacos
Veracruz All Natural,351,Only open from 7-3pm  Wished we these in California too   These little foil packets of heavenly goodness were so delicious. I m drooling just thinking about them again.  Migas Poblano Taco- egg poblano chili chips  black beans  red onions  cheese  avocado  Original Migas Taco- eggs  chips cheese  pico   Habanero sauce adds a nice kick where it gets your lip tingling.  Green Sauce adds another layer of flavor to the tacos.  So affordable and fulfilling you can t pass it up.  Dog Friendly. Has a small parking lot.
Veracruz All Natural,352,We came on a Sunday at 10am.. I know I know.. this is optimal breakfast taco truck time and we should ve come earlier  but still.. we waited in line for 1.5 HOURS  It was unseasonably cold when we were there in December  and we were standing there with no protection from the elements.   The tacos are really tasty and they have a few vegetarian options which is great  but I don t think it s worth a 1.5 hour wait.
Veracruz All Natural,353,We came here for breakfast on our first day in Austin and this was a great first experience.  We ordered the cucumber agua fresca  the al pastor and the breakfast taco with egg  cactus  sausage  jack cheese and potatoes. All seating is outdoors  but it is shaded so that was a nice relief from the Austin heat    The cucumber agua fresca was very refreshing  and not too sweet  which we appreciated. The al pastor was delicious  but we didn t like the breakfast taco as much. It could be the toppings I picked  but it was a little too bland.   The price was definitely unbeatable and it is quite amazing that we could have breakfast for two under  10. Overall  we enjoyed Veracruz and our verdict is if we lived close by  we d probably come here every day for breakfast lunch 
Veracruz All Natural,354,The line was long  but worth the wait.  I died over the barbacoa tacos  I know  I know  everyone loves the fish  and I tried that but  man  I loved that pork.  Guac was good. Service was even better. The guy behind the counter was pretty sure he knew my friend and made us laugh.  This place kicks every other tacos ass...  And how do they fit 8 people in that truck making tacos...  
Veracruz All Natural,355,These tacos were incredible   In Austin there are so many taco places that you don t want to waste your time getting an average taco. These tacos were definitely not that- definitely 5 star worthy and worth the wait on a 107 degree summer day.   I got the Migas taco and the chorizo and egg breakfast taco. I had hear how popular the migas taco was so I knew I had to get that. It definitely lived up to expectations but what I was even more wowed by was the chorizo and egg taco. The chorizo was so flavorful  Also  all 3 salsas were delicious. Definitely spicy but that s what I love   My friend ordered the mango aqua Fresca and she always raves about them  Definitely an excellent option for a large refreshing drink on a hot summer day.   I ll definitely be back for more tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,356,My friend and I tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was a bit of a disappointment.  The tacos were super small  comparing them to Torchy s .  The salsa was interesting to say the least  it was runny like they stuck everything in a blender until it was a watery substance.  I will say the ingredients were fresh and the quac was delicious.  You can get twice as much for your   at Torchy s and Torchy s tacos or more flavorful too.  The barbacoa taco had a few pieces of cilantro and a couple of cut up radishes.  No sauces are proved with the taco either unless you pay extra to purchase them.  This place will probably do okay if they only open restaurants a long way from Torchy s.  Personally  I would drive the extra miles to get Torchy s 
Veracruz All Natural,357,Not my favorite. I tried the al pastor tacos and they were just a bit too sweet for me. Hoping to redeem this place I came back to try the migas originales tacos which were far more filling than the al pastor and I only needed one. The side salsas are good as was the service but I probably wouldn t return.
Veracruz All Natural,358,Based on all of the reviews  I came out on a Sunday morning to order their famously-known Migas taco.  As always  the line for a place like this was around the corner into the small parking lot - mostly sunny standing  so if you re sun-sensitive  wear a lot of sunscreen or a hat.  The wait to order is approximately 30 minutes.  The ordering process was very smooth  the menu was quite streamlined - so even if you didn t want the Migas taco  you can still browse and find something you like.  As for the Migas taco itself  it was good  but I wouldn t consider it life-changing or to die for.  I think that it is more novel  the combination of ingredients in a taco   moreso than the flavor.  I have a preference for traditional street tacos  so I found myself liking their steak taco moreso than anything.  Overall  I think that as a stop - it isn t a bad one  but if you re in any kind of rush - take a pass on the place.  If you re here with a group of people who haven t come to Austin before and have time to spare  I think it s a great place to stop by and try - as the ambiance is very chill and great for catching up.  I wouldn t recommend the Migas taco  but I think the other items on the menu are perfectly good.
Veracruz All Natural,359,Currently trying to plan another trip to Austin just so I can get my hands on these tacos     ok I might be a little dramatic but they are seriously so good. I am pretty big on tacos  I love them so much and if you do too then you gotta hit this spot especially for breakfast tacos    My best friend who lives in Austin recommended this place praised it highly as one of the top taco places for quality  price and size. Their tacos are decently sized after 2 of the breakfast tacos and guacamole and chips I was decently full. I got the migas breakfast tacos and added bacon to it and one with sausage both were good  The sausage wasn t the pork sausage I expected  it was close to a hot dog but hey it still tasted good. What made it even more banging was the sauces they have. They had this creamy jalape o sauce that i highly recommend it really adds a medium kick  But the tacos without it were just as good. With the guacamole  it was so creamy and so flavorful i was a huge fan   I ordered the mango Agua Fresca drink which was a really nice cooling drink in the Texas heat especially while you re waiting for your food. It wasn t too sweet and was not as concentrated as regular mango juice. I also tried their steak quesadilla which the steak was really good and juicy and super cheesy  It s nothing too special but still taste great    Warning if you do come at it s peak hours when there s a line it can take a while  Even for the drink but it s worth the wait. I even returned the next da because I just had to take advantage of that place while I was there.
Veracruz All Natural,360,The Short  This place lives up to their name.  Not only do they use quality ingredients  but they re cooked well   Tacos - how good can it possibly be   If you really understand how quality ingredients interact with one another and strategically place them on a tortilla  you ll get a taco from Veracruz All Natural.  This place doesn t do it flashy or fancy  they do it right.  All the tacos are classic and will blast you right into their culture.  From the reviews  I had to try the Migas Taco and the Fish Taco.  Thank you fellow Yelpers  these two tacos were dead on   No one ingredient overpowered the others.  I absolutely love the small tortilla chips in the Migas tacos as they gave it an excellent crunchy texture.  Never before had I truly enjoyed a taco without red white meat until now.  As for the fish taco  the tilapia was flaky and seasoned well  much better than many fish tacos that I ve had before.  As I was eating  I could see eggs and mangoes being wheeled into the cart  no shame to say It was applause-worthy.  I can t wait to come back to try their other tacos.  The wait tends to be long during the rush hour  I had to wait 30 minutes   but the tacos are definitely worth it.  Their Aguas Frescas are worth getting too  super refreshing on a 100 degree day 
Veracruz All Natural,361,The migas taco is the highlight of this taco joint. Go for the migas poblano if you enjoy beans and pepper  and be sure to get a corn tortilla  they re made fresh . The tortillas were flavorful and the toppings plentiful. All things considered  perhaps the best tacos I ve ever had outside of Mexico -- tied with some other spots in this neighborhood.  Don t go expecting a quick bite  though -- at 8 30 on a Friday it took around 25 min to get 4 tacos. If you re not in a rush  though  it s quite relaxing to hang out in the shaded picnic area.  The surprise hit of our two visits to Veracruz were the ultra fresh juices  go for the Good and the Burner and you won t be disappointed.
Veracruz All Natural,362,The Al Pastor was really  really good - the chicken fajita was better than ok to good  but I d get the pastor again  hands down.  The guac was just good  but  5 - not a great value there  I also like mine a bit more flavorful - it seemed to lack lime and salt.  The salsas were nice and hot  and tasty.
Veracruz All Natural,363,Veracruz knows how to make a killer breakfast taco  From the the fresh made  locally sourced four tortillas to the house made salsa and sauces  it s easy to tell everything is made with love  hard work  and impeccable flavor. I got to try the Migas Taco and Migas Poblanos Taco. Both were delicious. The crispy tortilla chips and the fresh slice of avocado in both provided a nice contrast of crunchy and creamy textures. It s hard to pick a favorite  so I would honestly suggest going and trying both   The Migas Poblanos is a little bit hearty due to the black beans  so just be aware of that. I paid about  7.85 for two tacos  which I don t think is too bad considering it was enough food to fill me up for most of the day. Parking is free on site  so go give them a try if you re in the area 
Veracruz All Natural,364,I call myself a novice when it comes to Mexican food  how you ask  That s because I Live in San Diego and we have the best Mexican food in the world. However when you re in a different city and one of the best things to do is try breakfast tacos  you have to give it a try.  We usually would look for a breakfast brunch joint if we decide to eat out in the morning  however we love trying new places.  My wife and I were surprised by the quality of the breakfast tacos. This has to be one of the best breakfast meals in the morning. We ordered three different types of breakfast tacos and all of them tasted fantastic   even my seven-year-old son ate his whole taco. The hot sauces were amazing  this is definitely a spot that y all must visit while in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,365,This really suffers in comparison to Rositas al pastor  where id eaten the day before. The al pastor tacos were amateurish. The fish were a solid four and the small taste of mole I had was decent. The chips and guacamole were REALLY good though.
Veracruz All Natural,366,These tacos were change your life kind of tacos. I still dream of them tacos. A white lighted beacon of hope in the land of crappy flour tortilla Mexican food-land tacos.   Coming off of a bachelorette party in Austin  my only request to my local friend I was staying with was breakfast tacos. Former Californian and half Latina that she is  aka extremely picky about tortilla quality   she took me here.   Affordable. Delicious. The corn tortillas were INSANELY fresh. I got two breakfast tacos  one with potatoes and chorizo and the migas. I dumped both kinds of salsa on it  they are definitely spicy but not too much.   Be warned  the line is long and it does take a while. But they re totally and completely worth it. It made me sad I hadn t ordered more or ordered a burrito - I have dreams about what the al pastor burrito might taste like.
Veracruz All Natural,367,I probably just ate the best tacos I ve had so far in Austin. The ingredients were so fresh. I ordered the vegetarian and the fish taco. They come on flour tortilla and come individually wrapped in foil. I picked up one green salsa to go and boy was it hot. All you need is a couple drops of that to spice up your taco. They also have a large selection of juices and smoothies which seemed very popular. Next time I would like to try that. The only downside is not enough parking spots and the tow truck constantly coming to tow cars away since there are two food trucks sharing the lot with a convenient store and gas station. Definitely will come back to this place but at less busy time.
Veracruz All Natural,368,Best tacos I have ever had in my life  hands down. Didn t know breakfast tacos were a thing  but now that I ve discovered them there s no going back. The la Reyna taco is good  but the al pastor is absolutely fabulous. I highly recommend it  and also to get  the works  so it comes with guac.   I walked from my hotel downtown and it took about half an hour. Passed through some fun and funky areas and I definitely would suggest it.   They have a bunch of picnic tables and a few covers for when it rains. I regret not getting a smoothie too  considering how cheap everything is.
Veracruz All Natural,369,OH MAN OH MAN BLESS ALL THE TACOS FROM THE PLACE  This place is so good  I can t stop thinking about it. Their menu is small  but packed with flavor and a great mexican punch   I ve been here at least five times  and this place never fails to fill up my stomach every time   I always get the Migas  Al Pastor and Steak tacos  and it s the best around  that nobody is ever gonna get you down   The sauces really complement the tacos well  except they re really spicy  So if you have a good spice tolerance  not like me who cries when I eat hot Cheetos   give it a try   I have not had their Aguas Frescas  but I hear that they are the bomb  Go try it tonight 
Veracruz All Natural,370,Love me some Austin tacos  5 stars      I was in Austin for ACL weekend one and had to have me some delicious Austin tacos.   FOOD  I got the breakfast tacos with potato and chorizo  Loved    I ll get this every time if I could      LOCATION  I can t describe this any other way but to say it s SO AUSTIN. There s tons of sitting space and there might be wi-fi because people were out there with their laptops. This place shares sitting area with a coffee shop brewery  surprised  It s comes in clutch when you just wanna order your tacos then head over to the brewery and get yourself a nice cold beer.   SERVICE  It s a food truck... I just ordered it from the guy at the window and that was it 
Veracruz All Natural,371,One of the best breakfast taco joints in Austin. Normally I get BEC tacos but here the play is the migas tacos. Soooo good
Veracruz All Natural,372,This review isn t about the food  but the customer service. I m not one to write reviews or complain but wish I knew this before we went and wasted our afternoon. So wanted to like this place  The reviews were great and I heard good things about the food  We went after kayaking this Sunday and waited for an hour and a half to leave with the guy working handing us a bag of chips and saying  sorry we lost your ticket . AN HOUR and A HALF later. I have worked in the restaurant industry and totally understand this happens but it was so dismissed. The guy honestly seemed he could have cared less that we never got our food after waiting so long. I checked in multiple times on our order and he told me multiple times it was being made and  15 more minutes  about three times until finally I said we needed to leave soon and when it would really be done. Then he found out from the kitchen the ticket got lost  they never got our order and it was actually never made. So  he gave us a bag of chips. It was disappointing this wasn t taken more seriously that we had waited so long to then leave with nothing after spending our afternoon waiting there. Again things totally happen but was handled just so poorly. Really bad customer service the kid working seemed nice but clearly hasn t been trained well on customer service or it should have been brought to a manager earlier when they cancelled our order after almost 2 hours of waiting outside their restaurant.
Veracruz All Natural,373,The steak taco and fish taco are really tasty. Super fresh ingredients and the fish tacos has mangoes in it for an extra kick    The steak was fresh and tasted incredible with the avacados and onions. I also got the chips and guacamole and chips and salsa. The chips were very fresh and didn t taste like regular Tex mex chips. Authentic and def would go again  I went the day after to get the same thing  
Veracruz All Natural,374,Probably ranks among the top 3 tacos I ve ever eaten  and I live in San Diego. Sadly one of the last meals we had while visiting Austin  so we could not eat it again before we left. We will return   If you like chorizo  I recommend ordering the migas tacos with chorizo added 
Veracruz All Natural,375,Awesome migas and la rena tacos   The migas had a combo of migas  tortilla  salsa. The la rena taco has egg  avocado  spinach. Excellent flavor  We had a chance to eat before the rain  limited seating near the food truck. The smoothies were delicious too. The food was definitely worth braving the rain.
Veracruz All Natural,376,Unlike Torchys and Taco deli  the tacos here don t have any crazy names or ingredients. What they do have is fresh ingredients and homemade tortillas. The salsas seemed mild to medium in intensity.  Coming here after a long run  I devoured my barbacoa and migas tacos without even taking the obligatory picture. I can reassure anyone that they are deee-licious though. One thing I want to edit is the number of yelp dollar signs on this business. I think I could eat  15 worth of food here given how tasty the tacos were.
Veracruz All Natural,377,5 stars for me all around. There tacos are incredible I tried almost all of them during my visit. My favorite were the migas breakfast taco and the steak taco. But probably the best aspect about there tacos is the corn tortilla. I highly recommend getting the corn instead of the flour. They have so much flavor and to me there corn tortillas make the whole experience.  Come here for breakfast tacos. Come here for lunch tacos come here for dinner tacos. At Veracruz you will always be satisfied the food is made with quality ingredients  care and love. Please be aware that this can mean a nice long wait depending on when you arrice. Weekends are very busy    Come to Veracruz for all your taco needs
Veracruz All Natural,378,Tacos on corn is a must and these are awesome. Migas are a must in Austin and theirs is the best to be found. I m halfway between their restaurant in the northwest and this one. If it s nice and sunny this one is better. Seating is limited but the pace of the line is enough that there s enough tables to share.
Veracruz All Natural,379,The Migas Originales and the Migas Poblanos are my favorite breakfast tacos in all of Austin. La Reyna is also a fantastic taco packed with healthy veggies. If you haven t been to any of these trucks  then you are missing out on Austin s best taco truck.
Veracruz All Natural,380,Pretty decent tacos with some better than others. The migas taco  which is their claim to fame and featured on  the food network  is a breakfast taco with eggs  cheese  fried tortilla chips and avocado. It s definitely one of those tacos that tastes better as you eat it. And their sauces help a lot  by adding that much needed heat and creaminess.   Their al pastor was tasty but not as good as it looked. It has this bright red sauce all over it but the flavor didn t have as much depth as most a pastor and didn t appear to be slow cooked since the pork still had a bite to it.   Lastly  their Carne taco was just okay. I prefer my carne to be cooked over the grill vs soft and stewed.   The highlight of the meal is the tortilla  it taste so fresh and the consistency and texture was so good. It definitely taste freshly made and fresh tortilla just elevates the taco up a few notches and is probably their saving grace.
Veracruz All Natural,381,OMG  the tacos    I only had the breakfast tacos  but they were awesome  They are so good we went back for lunch   I only had the migas and migas poblanas tacos. The migas were perfect little breakfast tacos. It s kind of like chilaquiles but in taco form. Putting tortilla chips in a taco adds that crunch that elevated the texture of the taco.  The migas poblanas is like the migas but with poblano peppers and black beans. These were great too  but too much stuff in a taco. The filing to taco ratio was off that it was starting to get messy. But the flavors were all on point.  I also ordered one of their berry smoothies  which was nice.  They also have fresh salsas you can add to your tacos. Some mild  the orangey looking one will definitely add a little spice to your taco. All of them really good. If they run out  ask them to replenish.  There s going to be line for these tacos  the length depends on the weather. But you will understand that it is worth it  it was so yummy. Great cheap eats and out of a food truck. I wish they had a truck here on the East Coast 
Veracruz All Natural,382,Some of the best tacos I ve ever had  I wish I lived in Austin so I could get some more often. I used to think that all tacos were about the same  but I changed my mind after coming here.   The tortillas are so important  Veracruz makes their own corn tortillas  which are just sooo much better than normal corn tortillas from other taco places. The corn tortillas here are more tender  less dry and crumbly  and hold the taco together pretty well instead of just falling apart. They actually taste like corn...super delicious. I would definitely recommend getting corn tortillas here  but the flour tortillas are good too   .   The fillings are also generous for the breakfast tacos as well as the street tacos. The bf and I ate 5 tacos between the two of us and we were really stuffed. We tried the migas  fish  chorizo and egg  la reyna  and al pastor tacos. My favorites were the migas and the al pastor. The tortilla strips in the migas taco were still crunchy and added texture to the taco  which I really enjoyed.   The wait was a little long because they make everything to order  but it was worth it. I can t wait to come back again 
Veracruz All Natural,383,I really  really enjoy the food here.  I d give it 5 stars based on that fact alone.    But I have to knock it down a couple of stars for the experience  aka trying to find parking.  I pulled into what you would think is the food truck parking lot  only to get yelled at and berated by the business owner employee in the adjacent lot.  I had no intention in parking in their designated spots but that did not stop him from yelling at me and then staring me down until I left the lot.    At the end of the day  it s not worth the stress to deal with their  get off my lawn  neighbor and there are plenty of other Vera Cruz locations to enjoy their delicious food.
Veracruz All Natural,384,The corn tortillas are amazing since they are made by hand. The guacamole is good and fresh but needs a little lime to add some more flavor in there. The tacos were good. More specifically the fish taco was amazing. The pastor tacos were well seasoned but something about them doesn t seem right like it s missing something. I also got a breakfast taco and that I can say that I would not get again  I know better places for that. Coming from a humble Mexican  I can say this place for the most part is legit even with all the gringos.
Veracruz All Natural,385,The best Taco Truck ever  I was invited there by a friend who was telling me how amazing this place was. I had the Migas Taco and it was great very tasty and good quality I definitely will come back to get more tacos anytime. Place was clean and plenty of space to seat and enjoy your food. This place is always crowded so be prepared to be waiting in line for a little bit to place your order but trust me the wait is worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,386,Destination tacos   Came by here the other morning and was very happy to try it.  I got a couple migas tacos and it was definitely the best migas I ve ever had in Austin.  I even got a bonus potato and bacon taco  which was also delicious  since they made an extra one accidentally and gave it to me for free.    This is now my go-to for tacos and will also be where I bring friends from out of town.
Veracruz All Natural,387,One of my favorite taco places in Austin. Love their breakfast tacos. Everything is so fresh and full of flavor. They also cook the flour tortilla shell slightly which makes it a little crispy  which is a great touch that the other taco places don t do.  Also the aguas frescas are da bomb. You can pick from about 6 different fruit flavors. They are so refreshing on a hot day.  The only downside is the tacos are on the smaller side so will probably need to order more tacos to fill you up.  Can t go wrong at Veracruz All Naturals.
Veracruz All Natural,388,Best breakfast tacos in Austin    Get the Migas poblanos. The orange salsa is super spicy.
Veracruz All Natural,389,Hola amigo  the migas tacos at Veracruz All Natural are nothing short of extraordinary. Upon first bite  I can see why they re consistently at the top of all rankings. Situated in a gravel lot  their converted school bus also churns out amazing agua frescas. The workers are friendly and the food comes out hot and fresh.
Veracruz All Natural,390,There was a lot of hype behind this taco truck but the tacos were just good nothing special. I must say the sandia water was sooo good and the red salsa had the perfect kick to it.  Ps the parking sucks.
Veracruz All Natural,391,Cheap and delicious breakfast tacos. Get a few different types here to try them all. Only negative thing about this place is the birds are addicted to the tacos here too so watch your food carefully 
Veracruz All Natural,392,Amazing  An absolute must do  It was busy on a Sunday at 8am...that should tell you enough. I got the migas and la reyna...so flavorful. I was in love at the first bite  The tortilla was so fresh  soft  and chewy. The avocado and pico de Gallo was fresh  the tortilla chips added great crunch and varied the texture of the dish. The spinach  carrots  mushrooms  bell peppers in la reyna were grilled and charred well...so fresh and delicious. They have sauces on the side for your helping....they are delicious. The extra hot sauce and pico de Gallo is a must 
Veracruz All Natural,393,Really great tacos and great salsa  we got there right around 9 00 on a Sunday  morning and it wasn t bad but it definitely got busy after. Worth the wait 
Veracruz All Natural,394,I love these tacos. Always have to make a stop here whenever I come to Austin. They are definitely worth the wait  Can t wait to go back 
Veracruz All Natural,395,The saying that sketchy places make the best food  holds true for this little place. Its a school bus permanently parked in a dirt lot next to a pinata party place.  You d miss it if you weren t looking for it  and maybe even if you are looking. I passed it my first time by.  All the rave about these migas tacos. I couldn t leave Austin without them.    I went with 2 after the girl s suggestion  if you re hungry get 2 .  They are large and filling  I could have eaten 1 with my coffee and been fine. Although it is a ton of chips  I took a handful out and there was still enough.   The eggs are scrambled with cilantro and maybe some other stuff.  They were tasty on their own.  No dry rubbery stuff.  There were too many chips for my liking but I just took them off.  The salsa was WAY too overpowering vinegar.  Pass the TUMS.  It ruined one taco -good thing I got 2.  The red sauce is hot  but is a nice flavor.  The tortillas are made in house.  I watched these ladies make tortillas at the window as I waited for my tacos.   The tacos were good but I personally would have liked to try it without the chips.  I bet it would have been great still.
Veracruz All Natural,396,Ohhhhh man  this place has the best breakfast tacos that I have ever had. I got both versions of the Migas and wow  Highly recommend  Also  I like that they had picnic tables to sit at. Also  try the salsas  they were all delicious 
Veracruz All Natural,397,Before coming to town  I had heard about this place and made it a must eat for my visit to Austin. So we pulled into town and went straight here for lunch. I wanted to go to the original location  so there we were  in the larking lot  at the school bus  ordering from the window. There was a good amount of seating and the general area was shared with a BBQ truck. The grounds were not kid friendly as there was broken glass everywhere  intentionally . Parking lot was full so we parked a few blocks away. The line fluctuates in length.  Now onto the food. We got a handful of taco  broken down below   Fish - good amount of fish  sauce complemented the meat well Steak - My favorite  Meat was in strips and chewy  flavor was bold Al Pastor - too much marination in my opinion  tortillas on all tacos were amazing  I was surprised they did not have horchata and the salsa bar was pretty basic. We also got a side of chips and guac that was small in size for what you pay. Still a four-star review because the tacos were so good 
Veracruz All Natural,398,Not sure how in the world it took me so long to finally try Veracruz  its been bookmarked for over a year   but I finally did.  I had some friends in town and wanted to get some good breakfast tacos but also wanted to try something new so Verazcruz it was.  We showed up around 11am on a Monday and there were a couple other people sitting at the outdoor tables but no line to order. I ordered the veggie breakfast taco and the migas. Let me start by saying there is rarely a meal that I get with out some type of meat and leave feeling full but that has not been proven all wrong.  Both tacos were extremely hot  as in to touch  and also massive.  Two tacos was the perfect amount of food  although I could have probably ate more.  The veggie taco had so much flavor in there that you would think it wasn t even real. Not much to say about the migas taco that hasn t been said already  its incredible.  I WILL BE BACK   Many more times.
Veracruz All Natural,399,Waited in line for about 30 minutes for the food. Got a migas taco  fish taco  chicken mole  and al pasto. The fish taco was really delicious and I also liked the migas but the other two were underwhelming. Definetly try the fish taco.
Veracruz All Natural,400,This place is AMZING     The breakfast tacos were orgasmic  the sauce soooooo delicious  the mango juice bomb dignity. Definitely recommend this spot
Veracruz All Natural,401,Came in here with high expectations but I think the service ruined the food for me...literally.   I ordered the famous Migas Taco  named one of the top 5 best tacos in America by Food Network  and the Fish Taco  named a minimal masterpiece by Rolling Stone magazine.  Food took forever and tons of people who came after were served before me so I don t know what made my order take so long. When I did get it  it took so long  I had to switch my order to to go. They gave me a tiny paper bag. Not sure why because other people had bigger bags. Then the bag started to leak so I had to get a plastic bag and clean it up. The sauce that leaked  I now see  reading these reviews  was the famous spicy sauce for the Migas Taco. It was incorrectly sealed and placed in the bag by them  not me. By the time I caught it  all of it was gone. The lack of this sauce  when I ate it  might explain why I didn t think it was AMAZING. Good but not amazing. The fish taco was better  in my opinion. Juicier and heartier.   Maybe the Migas sauce would have made a difference but since I didn t know and it spilled everywhere  I ll never know.
Veracruz All Natural,402,I probably eat Vera Cruz tacos 10 too 15 times a month. The food here is so delicious  especially the fish tacos  It s always fresh. And unlike other places   they give you so much food 
Veracruz All Natural,403,I was visiting Austin with my sister and we had to stop by at the Vera Cruz food truck   We were super excited and knew it was going to be good seeing how long the line was and how many people were there. I got a steak taco and a fish taco. I would have to say the steak was very soft and melts in your mouth  However  it was kind of bland to me. The fish taco on the other hand was amazing    The mango salsa that was on there with the cabbage  lime  and red sauce was DE-LISH  I will be dreaming about that taco... great place  Friendly staff  they were pretty fast  and everyone seemed happy to be there too 
Veracruz All Natural,404,Someone needs to sit down with me and explain why breakfast tacos are not a thing in the Bay Area. Breakfast burritos are delicious  alright  but they also make you want to take a nap after instead of beginning your day. Correct me if I am wrong  but isn t the point of eating breakfast to fuel us and give us energy to start the day  Breakfast burritos seem to contradict this logic since I always feel like I do not want to move an inch after finishing one  you can say I could opt not to finish a burrito  but burritos are delicious. Why stop eating    Now that the rant is over  Veracruz is one of the places where we tried breakfast tacos. I read that the line can get very long  but we were lucky as there was only one other guy ahead of us in line when we arrived. Score  The service was incredibly friendly and patient as we narrowed down our choices from everything in the menu to just four.  We ordered the chicken mole  chorizo  migas  and a concoction of bacon  avocado and cactus. Our order took about ten minutes to be ready because they cook to order. But the wait was worth it. All were so incredibly delicious. It was evident that the tortillas and the ingredients were fresh. And my most favorite part  They were just the right size  They gave me enough energy to carry me through the busy day and I did not even feel a drop of sleepiness.   I really wish we had Veracruz in my neighborhood. I am now a big fan of breakfast tacos and they make really good ones 
Veracruz All Natural,405,Well worth the wait if you are a fan of migas tacos  I love eggs and I love tacos so the combination just works perfectly especially the way that they prepare this dish. I do love mole and I was expecting to be blown away by it but it was no up to par to other restaurants I have had mole at. If you want mole  go to Habanero. If you want migas tacos and delicious agua fresca  go to Veracruz   
Veracruz All Natural,406,This review is solely based upon the breakfast tacos  so if you want to know more about anything else they serve  skip my review.    I had the Migas Poblana taco  as well as a basic egg and bean taco  both on corn tortillas.  Pros   Fresh made corn tortillas  Not every spot does that - important  Yum   Lots of tables - all covered with umbrellas or under a canopy - nice place to eat outside if you don t sit close to the street   Very good salsas  Tasted very fresh   Tacos served nice and hot   Parking was easy  They recycle   Tasted fairly healthy - not heavy at all    Beans are made with canola oil instead of lard or pork fat  so no need to worry about this if you or your dining companions are vegetarian  Cons  -Sigh - their beans are  well  just OK  -  this keeps me from wanting to come back for breakfast tacos for sure -Takes a while to get your tacos  that is not unique to this food truck bus  so it s almost a moot point  but you should plan for this when making time to come here -Lacked that special something-something flavor texture that makes me crave coming back for another round tomorrow  like some other places are able to do. There are just too many breakfast taco options out there to settle for less than phenomenal tacos  I guess I have a very high bar for tacos   Overall impression  I ll come back for lunch 
Veracruz All Natural,407,Excellent and definitely worth the wait. The migas was probably my favorite migas breakfast taco I ve had  and I ve had a couple. Just the mix of fried tortilla and egg and peppers was really good  and the tortilla really kept it s crunch. Also the fish taco was fantastic. Maybe one of the best fish tacos I ve ever had  and I ve had even more of those than migas tacos. I d happily go back and try other things  but more likely I d just get more fish and migas.
Veracruz All Natural,408,What looks to be your typical food truck tacos turned out to be some of the best food we had on our whole trip to Austin - and that seems to be the general consensus with Veracruz. From the selection of breakfast tacos to your more standard fare  the menu checks all boxes. I can t even say a favorite because they were all equally delicious and far superior to what we have in Chicago  getting depressed just writing this . My only complaint about this place are the long lines that form relatively quickly each day - choose your time carefully or be ready to wait a little bit before chowing down. Trust me  it s worth the wait 
Veracruz All Natural,409,Bien Bien Bien     Choo choo  I m all aboard the breakfast taco train. I grew up i the southwest and I was indoctrinated to the breakfast burrito from day one. I didn t know the glorious invention of breakfast tacos existed until I visited Austin. Thankfully for us  we stayed right by the best b-fast taco joint in town   I honestly don t know where to begin -  the migas  migas poblanos  la reyna  and adding freaking cactus to my taco    Thankfully there were no thorns in this cactus  but it sure did  spike  my appetite. The migas was probably my favorite and it coincidentally is their most popular taco.   An underrated menu item here is the agua fresca...POW...that s the feeling when it hit my tastebuds. Fresh fruit blended together to create a cool  sweet  and refreshing feeling as you enjoy amazing breakfast tacos.  Pro Tip - Veracruz is very dog friendly and has a good amount of patio seating. Put on some sun screen and bring your pup 
Veracruz All Natural,410,Holy cow man. This has to be one of the best taco places on Earth  Had the migas and the fish taco and they were both out of this world. Migas is so full of flavor just makes you want to have more. Fish taco has a bit of a kick to it which isn t that bad but adds something to take it up a notch. If you re ever in Austin come here. Definitely recommend   
Veracruz All Natural,411,We haven t had the food  we stopped by for some aguas frescas and they didn t fail us. They were delicious. Very refreshing  not overly sweet. Just perfect    Will definitely come back to eat
Veracruz All Natural,412,I m pretty snobby when it comes to tacos after living in Austin for years  but this place continuously blows me away every time I have the privilege to eat their food. The Migas Originales is  dare I say  the best breakfast taco you ll find in Austin. I usually get it on corn because this place makes a fantastic corn tortilla that won t fall apart and will taste incredible. Their other tacos are very good  and I really enjoy the Tacos Al Carbon as well. Their guacamole is unreal  and don t sleep on the sauces for your tacos that they have tucked away in the corner. If you re really feeling adventurous  try a freshly made Agua Fresca which is equally on par to the rest of the menu items. Overall  I wish I could give this place 6 5 stars. If you haven t given this place a visit  do yourself a favor and go. Even if there s a line  it s for a good reason.
Veracruz All Natural,413,When visiting Austin  top of multiple to do lists was getting breakfast tacos. A quick Eater search led me to Veracruz which was a short walk from my hotel.  Short  as in 15 minutes in the Texas heat. The food truck had to be hotter because there was a line about 12 people Deep and packed seating on the picnic tables. I ordered two tacos from the choices--potatoes  eggs  and cheese on both with ham on one and bacon on the other. The potatoes we soft and flavorful. The Cheese was gooey and the eggs fluffy. Pair that with the spicy salsa on the side and I was in heaven. I thought to order the Watermelon Kiwi juice but almost forgot the water. Don t forget the water 
Veracruz All Natural,414,I had a lottttttt of tacos while on vacation in Austin and these were the BEST. They beat Torchy s Tacos for me and I thought Torchy s was amazing too  We each ordered the famous Migas taco  Al Pastor and the fish taco with chips and guac and the freshly squeezed watermelon juice. This juice was so delicious that I was craving more even after finishing the huge cup they give it to you in  theres only one size  . These tacos were honestly life changing and I haven t eaten tacos since I ve gotten back to New York because I know it won t be the same. I can t even pick a favorite because they were all equally so beyond delicious. I wish I went one more time while I was in Austin. If you re in the area  do yourself a huge favor and go get yourself some tacos from Veracruz 
Veracruz All Natural,415,This place is amazing  I love the breakfast tacos  I love the chicken tacos  I will be going back again and again
Veracruz All Natural,416,Sadly  this will be my last time eating here. The tacos are pretty darn good  amp  clean-ish as far as eating out goes  they do use canola oil  amp  no -organic . I wish they would take food intolerances more seriously  I was served flour tortillas after Indicating a gluten intolerance. I also witnessed an employee using a bare hand to dip a chip into the large container of guacamole that is used to serve all others from and then chow down behind the register. From a sanitation stand point this is concerning. This was my third experience and every time my order has had an issue. Every time the ticket has been correct  items have just been made incorrectly or forgotten all together.
Veracruz All Natural,417,There will certainly be a line if its close to lunch time or a weekend BUT its worth it. Try the Al Pastor tacos  migas tacos  or any one of your favorite flavors of  huge  Agua Fresca.
Veracruz All Natural,418,MUST GO HERE. The Migas breakfast tacos are incredible  and filling . I ordered one of those   a breakfast taco with egg  potato and chorizo  super delicious. I recommend the flour tortillas as they are thicker and sturdier than the corn  and keep everything together.  You definitely should try the agua fresca. Never had one as flavorful as this. Not watered down  just straight fruit. Between my friend and I  we had the cantaloupe   strawberry  my favorite   mango  and watermelon. All were delicious  and we went back multiple days. Great for a hot day.  The line can get long quickly  but always found table space to wait under an umbrella. It s worth the wait.
Veracruz All Natural,419,Solid spot for tacos and juice. Line was pretty short on a Sunday afternoon. Tried the fish  al pastor and migas taco. I quite liked the fish  very tender  although my mom noted that it was very fishy in taste. Al pastor came nicely spiced and meat was very tender. The migas taco was an interesting surprise - I liked the crunch that the chips added to the dish.   The aqua frescas were also amazing. Watermelon juice was refreshing and pineapple was very yummy as well.
Veracruz All Natural,420,Eating the Migas tacos is an existential experience. Like how did life exist prior to knowing the deliciousness of the Migas taco. Ranked top 5 breakfast tacos in the USA and for good reason. Go here. Just do it.
Veracruz All Natural,421,Solid and quick tacos for the price. We got 5 options - fajita steak  fajita chicken  al pastor  fish  and a black bean with bacon and cheese breakfast taco with drinks  and still kept it under  20. Each taco was a nice size with a yummy tortilla keeping it all together. The meat in the pastor and steak was cooked well  not too dry and definitely a lot of flavor. The only one I wouldn t get again was the fajita chicken - the chicken was cut a little too think and chunky for me  but nothing to get too worked up over. They also have a nice selection of salsas - nice big chunks of avocado in the mild one  which I was a big fan of
Veracruz All Natural,422,After reading Yelp reviews  and noticing Veracruz was mentioned by Food Network as one of the nation s top 5 tacos  I was intrigued. I came here on a weekday around lunch with my boyfriend. There was not a long wait at all  but plenty of people coming in and out.   During lunchtime  they were still offering breakfast tacos  and since Yelp raved about the  Migas  taco  naturally  we ordered two. We also had the al pastor and the carne taco  with an order of watermelon agua fresca.   The ingredients in the Migas were simple  but fresh and worked perfectly together. The tortilla chip crunch with the soft handmade corn tortilla was an excellent and delicious play on texture. Overall  a solid taco that I would get again. 5 5.  Both of us agreed the carne taco was better than the al pastor. The beef was great.   Don t forget to try the three sauces salsas. The two sauces are both pretty spicy  but I don t like spicy  so try it anyway bc they re still great   and the salsa has real and big chunks of avocado in it. WOW. This was all included at the area near taco pick-up window.  Overall  MIGAS taco is a must here  and the agua fresca watermelon was HUGE and worth the   to wash down the delicious  homemade lunch we enjoyed here.
Veracruz All Natural,423,We found this gem while in Austin  and I kid you not  we went twice in one weekend. They are that good. I m Mexican by birth so I hold a high standard for tortillas. To me  they are the base of a taco an thus an important part. Veracruz tortillas are excellent. No two ways about it  if you arrive mid morning  you will stand in line and your tacos will take a while. Well worth it  and I don t wait for much. Just come prepared to wait but to know that the Migas taco  the fajita taco and the mole taco are well worth the wait. The mole taco is not something I would order regularly but this one was delicious  Don t skip it  if you are a mole person like me.
Veracruz All Natural,424,The food is really great. The service was really really slow  especially compared to other places we went to that day. The drinks options were plentiful and very much needed on a hot day. Definitely would go back 
Veracruz All Natural,425,Have to try migas tacos    3 taco but they are the size of a breakfast burrito  Have 2 of those and you re set for the morning. Salsas are amazing  green  red and mild. Wish I could try all their menu  Might go back for more soon  Tortillas are fresh and the chips are soooo yummy  crunchy and freshly fried  Can t go wrong  A must try in Austin
Veracruz All Natural,426,We ordered carry out for the breakfast tacos. The amigas were delicious and my friend enjoyed the bits of nachos in them. I liked the steak fajita tacos because they were cooked appropriately and were seasoned well. We ordered about ten various tacos. However  the restaurant would do well to mark which tacos are which  maybe premade stickers or just simple abbreviations . Someone in my party has an allergy to some ingredients so we had to open each taco to see if it had those ingredients  which was inefficient  difficult to tell  and potentially dangerous for her.
Veracruz All Natural,427,The long line and wait are quickly forgotten after the first bite.  These are supreme tacos.  Cannot go wrong with the fish  al pastor or the migas originalles     Watermelon Fresca is ice cold and refreshing and the perfect chaser   the hipster parade and overheard conversations  in line  make for good amusement while waiting in line  but once your order is called  prepare for transcendence.  Enjoy  
Veracruz All Natural,428,Migas taco was really good. I regret only getting one. The taco ingredients were really fresh. Took a while to get our food even though we were one of the only ones there on a Saturday morning.
Veracruz All Natural,429,Crazy good tacos. Be patient with the line though - I recommend coming with coffee if you re there for your Sunday hangover cure.
Veracruz All Natural,430,Took a RideAustin to get to this parking lot food truck... next to a Shell gas station so a really weird location. Not near much else. 35 degrees outside and I had all my luggage  having just flown in. Tired and cold. But. So. Worth. It. Ordered the 2 versions of the migas tacos and the pineapple agua fresca. They had a heated tent but I wanted to eat in private so braved the outside picnic table. Those tacos were amazing. You need at least 2 because they are small. I used the corn tortillas and they came wrapped in foil -- opening it and each steaming bite in that cold November weather - the avocado  the sauces  everything mixed in  too cold and hungry to really study all that care that went into it ... flavors melded together. I loved the crunchies added in there also. Need to eat right away to keep that crunch. The sauces were also great. Agua fresca so cold but en pointe to balance the tacos. Would definitely go back again and again. I can see how they do so well  even in a weird parking lot location.
Veracruz All Natural,431,I went to seven different taco places during my four day stint in Austin and this was my favorite  This little food truck is an amazing place for fresh food. I loved my al pastor taco but the fish taco was the real show-stopper. The mango salsa and avocado topped on the fresh grilled fish was the perfect combo  I also ordered a watermelon agua fresca which was so perfect. The portion are huge  both tacos and beverages   so I left very full given the fact that my bill was only  10.  I came here with three of my friends so sitting down was a little hard in the prime lunch hours but I definitely thought it was worth the wait   30ish minutes from waiting to being served . The outdoor space that they have set up is great and perfect for a sunny day 
Veracruz All Natural,432,Food in Austin is just too good. I m only knocking off a star because the food took 20ish minutes  though she did warn us that it would  and the steak taco was just so-so. The migas were above average. But the star  the star my friends is the al pastor taco with the works.   GET THE AL PASTOR TACO.   Okay  my work here is done.
Veracruz All Natural,433,I m coming back to Austin simply because I want more of their breakfast tacos. Being from Los Angeles  these tacos are unlike anything I ve ever had before in. my. life.   At first I was against breakfast tacos  but I tried it and wanted to go back to Veracruz the next day for more. Next time I m in Austin  I ll be at Veracruz grabbing breakfast 
Veracruz All Natural,434,OMG     Worth...the ....wait  I ve tried so many migas tacos and this one is life changing. Lived in Austin for 4 yrs and currently live in SF where there s no such thing as a breakfast taco. I come here at least three times within my Austin visits and it s amazing every time  Thank you Veracruz  y all really know how to do migas right   
Veracruz All Natural,435,Ok i just e scootered 10 minutes back to my east austin hotel room  washed my hands and face  then got down to my undies amp  turned off the lights- so i could rely only on my tastebuds. I began putting the most delicious flavors in my mouth. One mouthful after another i have never tasted anything so  perfectly tasty- salty  fresh  zesty  so satisfying. These are the best Tacos. I had all the tacos on their menu and washed it down with some sweet pink juice  watermelon. Jeez we  can t say anything these days. Take it easy 
Veracruz All Natural,436,What a great place that represents the best of Austin. Great food made from natural ingredients served from an old bus with a vibe unmatched. If downtown this is a must.
Veracruz All Natural,437,This place was absolutely great. The tacos are phenomenal and the staff was super friendly. Really great green salsa and red salsa options. We had everything from breakfast tacos to regular tacos and all of the options were A . Would definitely go back again.
Veracruz All Natural,438,We came here a little bit before noon on a breezy Thursday. They are located near the shop with hanging pinatas and another food truck nearby. The lot looks sketchy but just park and walk toward the white school bus. Their menu is pretty big  you can customize certain tacos. The prices threw me off because it s pricey for street tacos but you ll see why in a little bit. I asked the lady how big the tacos were since one taco was about  3  and she made them seem like they weren t too big. I ordered two with the thought of coming back and ordering more if I was still hungry. Man  was I wrong.  I ended up getting 2 al pastor tacos on flour. Another perk about this place is that they don t charge you extra for flour. They don t charge you for not eating it authentically  They give you a beeper and you can wait and eat at picnic tables nearby. There are even porta-potties so don t stress that you re eating at a food truck. It didn t take too long  once it beeped  you pick up your tacos at the other end where all the sauces were. The tacos were HUGE. They were each wrapped in foil paper to keep them warm and I didn t even time to take a picture after opening up the foil. These tacos were the biggest street tacos I have ever seen and the size of the pieces of pork were giant cubes. It is definitely worth the  3. The al pastor does stain your hand so have hand sanitizer handy or you can grab some near the sauce. This place looks out for you.  They also have a wide drink menu. We tried cucumber juice which is super fresh and light. We also tried the mango juice and strawberry smoothie. They all tasted super good and come in large containers. I would definitely come back to this place and I recommend it to anyone visiting Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,439,Super delicious  Get the migas  the juices are so big  You can definitely share one with a person  Sooo good 
Veracruz All Natural,440,I stopped early for breakfast one morning to try their breakfast and migas tacos.  Their trailer is located in the trendy  hipster  eastside.  Along with the tacos  I ordered the ubiquitous Topo Chico mineral water to wash it down. Neighboring the trailer food park  is a craft coffee spot where I picked up an Americano.  It took a long while to receive the order. I would hope that the reason was that they were making my tortilla fresh to order. There weren t that many people ahead of my order.   One bite and I was in breakfast taco food heaven.  Of the two tacos  my favorite was the migas tacos. The portion size for each taco were larger than your average street taco. I loved the combination of the crunch inside the taco and pillowy softness of the fresh tortilla on the outside. I was sad that I didn t have to revisit this place again or try other breakfast tacos spots during my visit to Austin to compare.
Veracruz All Natural,441,Can we please taco bout this food truck   Hands down the BEST breakfast tacos in Austin  and I ve had my fair share of them . Fresh  authentic  always piping hot ingredients   amp  fluffy  thick  homemade tortillas make for absolute PERFECTION in the form of taco. The tacos here are reasonably priced  especially for the great quality and decent quantity of their fillings.  Aside from their awesome build-your-own breakfast tacos  I enjoy potatoes and egg   their migas taco is fresh and flavorful  and their fish taco is AMAAAZING    You know how at some places the fish inside of their tacos are overcooked and way too fried crunchy  There is none of that nonsense at Veracruz. The tilapia is wonderfully tender and fresh and MELTS in your mouth  the mango pico adds a lovely sweetness that contrasts with the tanginess of the lime  and the chipotle cream sauce adds a flavorful kick. The cabbage is super crisp. The fish taco is a wonderful blend of flavor and texture  I think probably the best fish taco I ve ever had     crying tears of joy because delicious   Boyfriend and I have ordered the watermelon agua fresca in the past  and it tasted great but was a little sweet. Although it is pricey and definitely a treat  it s a perfect ending  or accompaniment   to a wonderfully-seasoned and flavorful taco  or two...or three .
Veracruz All Natural,442,meh the ham and cheese breakfast taco was okay but the carne asada and pork were blegh
Veracruz All Natural,443,Austin  stahp with the amazing food. I can t handle. So much indulge. Veracruz blessed me with the BEST FISH TACOS I ve ever had. So good we went back for seconds.   The mango juice was also so fresh and not from concentrate. Not to mention it came in a huge 32oz cup  their only size  thanks Texas  
Veracruz All Natural,444,Pros  Really really good taco. Cons  Wait times.  I had some of the best Breakfast Tacos of my life here. The Migas Poblanos is glorious esp. if you add their salsa to it. Not doubting their claim about being one of the nation s top 5 tacos -- so good 
Veracruz All Natural,445,Unwittingly stumbled upon Veracruz for our first meal in Austin on a recent trip  and ended up visiting a second time for a final breakfast taco before flying out of the Great State...two visits in two days was very necessary.   This unassuming food truck nestled next to a Shell and a pinata blow-out store  could anything be better   was a veritable extension of Austin International Airport before our flight out. Three-quarters of customers had luggage in tow before flying out of ATX  and we brushed shoulders with most after reaching the airport.   Pro tip - order the fish taco with mango pico de gallo  but eat it last. Anything that follows just can t compare. Breakfast with the migas  rated the best breakfast taco in Austin and one of the best in the country  or poblanos helps after a night of heavy drinking for an easy  3 a pop.
Veracruz All Natural,446,They hype is real. I m a first generation Mexican immigrant I know tacos. I was raised on tacos. I make my own tortillas  salsa  all that shit. Veracruz is legit  authentic  and freakin delicious. The tortillas are made to order I had a taco that was a little fuller and that tortilla for that taco was a little bigger and thicker. They get it. And YES the migas taco is one of the best I ve ever had. Everything else is good too. Mole on point  fajita is lit  pastor to die for  and the salsa is a masterpiece. Give these guys your hard earned money  they won t disappoint.
Veracruz All Natural,447,Overhyped in my opinion. The tacos were good but not amazing. There are just so many other taco places in Austin that I don t think I d come back again. Maybe I just had high hopes for the place  Or maybe I didn t get the right tacos  The tortillas are okay but not the best I ve ever had.  I got a chorizo and egg taco and the chicken taco. My fianc  got a steak and a chicken taco. The chicken taco was pretty flavorful and everything overall tasted good. My fianc  said the steak was really tender but didn t have a lot of flavor. I really like that the tacos come with avocado  but overall everything seemed kind of pricey for a food truck but I don t know maybe I m just cheap. Hope with their new brick and mortar location the prices don t increase by much    We also got the watermelon aguas frescas  good but again overpriced.  4 for a cup of aguas frescas  I think I d rather go to mi tradicion for aguas frescas where it s less than  3 for a large cup and I can get a variety of foods.   SUMMARY  way better than torchys yes  and it is very authentic. I have no regrets about coming here and recommend checking it out  but for me I didn t find the best taco of my life and wasn t all that impressed. I d rather try another taco place I haven t been too then come again.
Veracruz All Natural,448,This place was highly recommended to us before our first trip to Austin. We stopped for breakfast one morning and it was better than we ever could have dreamed. Bestttt breakfast tacos in town and the guac is sent from heaven  We would go back to Austin just for Veracruz.   4 minute drive to Convention Center  Parking on site Very cheap  very delicious
Veracruz All Natural,449,Migas Poblano all the way. Their fish tacos are pretty good too.  Although their Agua Fresca s are pretty good  they are way overpriced.
Veracruz All Natural,450,The Migas tacos truly are one of the best I ve had   The migas are hot and always fresh and has the right amount of crunch  The line is always pretty long so be ready to wait. The choose two tacos are also good. Make sure to get some of their homemade green salsa.
Veracruz All Natural,451,Hands down the best breakfast taco I ve ever had. And them s fightin  words  I know.
Veracruz All Natural,452,After lots of research before heading over to Austin  TX on where to go for Austin s famous breakfast tacos  I have concluded that Veracruz was the spot to go to. I tried the Breakfast taco with Sausage and Chorizo  but it was only after I got back to LA  that I realized that I got the wrong breakfast taco... The breakfast taco I had was pretty good  but nothing special. I will definitely be back to try the correct taco next time.  Helpful fact  get the Migas taco  voted top 5 in America 
Veracruz All Natural,453,Beef cheeks and lingua were amazing over corn a la dente amazing  Good ppl up front too 
Veracruz All Natural,454,Won t say I m a taco expert  but boy are the tacos good here  Veracruz was just two blocks from where I m staying at Austin  and naturally given I live so close by and all the rave reviews I ve been hearing  I HAD to make a trip here. We had the El Pastor  fish taco and guac  amp  chips - all were excellent. Wish I had room to try out more tacos. We went to a highly-rated Mexican restaurant for lunch that day and Veracruz was much much better. Don t believe they open for dinner so definitely come earlier in the day for Austin s best tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,455,I don t know what I liked more about Austin  how much their people love their tacos  or THESE tacos themselves   After walking back from the ACL fest  my friend and I decided we needed to eat something nearby our hostel - what better than the truck down the block  I ve never seen this type of establishment  a food truck that seconds as a pop-up restaurant and semi-permanent where it s located.  Hands down  the best tacos around  and probably ever.
Veracruz All Natural,456,Wow  this place is as good as all the reviews say.  Mia  Fish  and made my own chorizo egg and cheese on corn tortilla.  Worth eating here.  It s in a little food truck park with minimal parking.  Worth the wait.  I was not a fan of the smoothies.
Veracruz All Natural,457,One of my favorite taco places I have ever been to  This is a MUST try when coming to Austin  TX. I have tried several things and all have been amazing.
Veracruz All Natural,458,O M G  This was probably the best breakfast tacos I have ever had  I want to move to Austin just for this  Trust me  just go and try this out  You won t regret j
Veracruz All Natural,459,We hit up Veracruz and it was truly one of the best taco food trucks we ve had on our trip. I highly recommend eating here  we also really really enjoyed the Aguas Frescas try the strawberry banana    The tacos were packed  and super delicious. I m sad that we only experienced this once  but we ll definitely be returning. Also the chips and salsa were bomb    Great service the staff were really nice too 
Veracruz All Natural,460,Ho-ly SHIT this place was amazing. I should ve read more reviews before I went because the tacos were HUGE   we ordered 7   chips guac for 2 people and ended up taking 2 home.  The tacos are all delicious  cooked very well  amazing seasoning toppings and as noted below are OVERFLOWING. My first impression was the tacos were expensive   3- 4  but after seeing how big they are a great deal. Each taco is definitely twice the size I expected.  MUST TRY  Al Pastor Taco - flavor was amazing  the pineapple and avocado were also delicious with the super tender pork Fish Taco - HUGE fish portion  very fresh tasting  loved the mango pico Salsas - try both. They are craveable.  Agua Fresca  watermelon  - some of the best i ve had. Not overly tart or sweet. and a HUUUGE portion as well  so while  4 seems like a lot you are getting almost 2 portions really. I guess everything is bigger in texas   We also had the migas poblano which was very tasty. And we have yet to eat our steak because we are so full    I really want to try more places in Austin  but I could also eat here every day   
Veracruz All Natural,461,Unfortunate wait time still does not compensate for their amazing migas tacos.    Went to Veracruz last weekend for breakfast.  The good  Their migas tacos are pretty damn good. The bad  Their salsas are kind of  meh  the pastor as well The ugly  Their wait times    45  minutes for some migas tacos... What s going on here   I m not sure what is happening inside the trailer but natural selection should have removed Veracruz from existence a long time ago.  Their saving grace is a cult-like following and lore for their migas taco  which  by all accounts is very good.  Velvety eggs and pillowy fried Tortilla chips  wrapped up in a handmade corn tortilla -- You get it.  Tasty.  However I m pretty sure that  everything  there is hand made including growing the corn for my corn tortillas.  I understand  this is not fast food  however somehow all other restaurants manage to turn out tacos in a decent amount of time.  ...  It s not even like there was a huge crowd waiting for tacos.   A handful of people   Operationally  Torchy s and Tacodeli put this place to shame ... but there always is the migas taco.  I was quoted for 10 minutes for coffee because everyone was busy and instead I ordered an agua fresca.  You know how long it took to pour   ... 10 minutes.  Pro tip  Call ahead  be less disappointed.
Veracruz All Natural,462,There s a reason this place is known for the migas. Best migas tacos I ve ever had. Don t get me wrong the rest of the tacos are great too  but you must get at least one migas if you come. This food truck has a decent amount of seating and is located just off 35 so it s not too hard to find. The staff is friendly and proud of their tacos- as they should be. My friend got a fresh cucumber drink that was delicious and it looked like everyone around us had some sort of fresh fruit drink that I assume were also great. Also  the line moves fast and tacos will come out quick  so don t let that scare you.
Veracruz All Natural,463,Came in after a night on 6th street  except I was the DD so I guess that doesn t mean anything haha. For everyone else who was aboard the struggle bus  the Migas Tacos  the avocado slice makes the difference  seemed to bring them back to life. I also got a breakfast taco that was ham and egg and I could eat 4 of them with the sauce that was in the metal container. I would want to definitely try different variations of the breakfast Taco s though because I usually have breakfast burritos  not tacos so this place claimed my breakfast taco virginity.   I think I got the one that was strawberry banana blended with OJ  may be called the feel good  and that was delicious  I wished I had order the large instead of the regular.    The day that we went it was freezing but they had a tent with a heater inside and a picnic table to sit on so that was really nice while we waited and ate our food.
Veracruz All Natural,464,I ve been here a few times but only ever gotten the migas tacos  so I m only reviewing the tacos and the incredible wait times.   The migas are super delicious  The egg is the right consistency just before you hit dense  the corn tortilla tastes like a homemade grandmother s  and the slice of avocado is  the perfect amount. There s really no reason to eat anything else here. The red salsa pairs with it really well. One taco also fills you up. It gets seven stars out of five.  The wait times are super ridiculous  One star bad  Y all  That s BAD   Delicious  had never been before Thanksgiving weekend  so we phoned in our order ahead of time and were given a thirty minute estimate. Fine  not El Chilito s 5 to 10 minute normal estimate  but way better than the 45 minutes I ve waited before for a breakfast taco  so I ll take it. We asked for coffee when we arrived and was told that there would be a small wait. I asked exactly how long and was told ten minutes. Y all  Ten minutes to brew coffee   Do you have to buy the machine first  WTH  Also  the couple we sat next to complained that they d been waiting over an hour for their order. They eventually left with three bags of tacos  but seriously  very very little is worth that kind of waiting time. Orgasms and iPhones. That s probably it.   I don t think I d ever come here spur of the moment  and every time I try to call in an order and the phone isn t answered  I rule out Veracruszfor the day. But if you can place an order over the phone  this place s migas tacos are well worth the try.
Veracruz All Natural,465,Two words... BREAKFAST TACOS.  My bf and I visited Austin for the first time in September and Veracruz was one of our favorite places. The truck was super close to our Airbnb and so we would start our mornings here. Since we re from Socal  we re used to breakfast burritos and really good Mexican food. Veracruz does not disappoint. I wish we had breakfast tacos in LA   SD  I loved the bacon breakfast tacos and he loved the Barbacoa  only available on the weekend . We both really liked the al pastor. Honestly  I m sure everything on the menu here is delicious. The food comes out in a timely manner because it s all made fresh. There is a good-sized seating area and the prices are decent. Most of the people dining here are locals so you know you are truly eating delicious food   I highly recommend Veracruz if you are in Austin 
Veracruz All Natural,466,Will not be back .  I Ordered the vegan taco and it came out with all veggies and egg  I took it back up and told them no I can t eat the egg .  Got called up again for my new Taco and low and behold this one was nothing but a handful of cheese and veggies .  Took it back another time to say I cannot have the cheese .  Finally got called up once more and this one was just drippy oily spinach and nothing else . No other veggies or anything . I took one bite threw it away and left . Not only that but they were out of every beverage . Nothing to wash down the oil they heavy hand pour on everything .  I had high hopes for this place coming in and I left really disappointed .
Veracruz All Natural,467,Not sure what to do for food .. not a bad option here and the quesadilla is on point  Breakfast tacos are on another level too ..highly recommended 
Veracruz All Natural,468,Best fish tacos in Austin and I love fish tacos and try them all. Best salsa      The one in the scoop it out yourself big pan. I want to drink it like Gazpacho. My daughter also loves the fish tacos as much as me   She s 11    yum yum yum and yum
Veracruz All Natural,469,An early morning walk took us to Veracruz for some breakfast tacos. I tried the Migas and Migas Poblano. Both were very good. The three salsa options were able to add some freshness and spice to the tacos and really brought some flavor 
Veracruz All Natural,470,My boyfriend and I visited Austin last week and breakfast tacos were on our to-do list. Veracruz was highly recommended to us by a friend that lives in Austin  he hyped it up and we decided to try it our last morning there.   The tacos and juice were worth every minute we waited in line under the hot Texas sun   20 minutes to be specific.  We ordered 4 tacos  chips and guac  and one watermelon juice. I think we would ve been okay with just 2 tacos  chips and guac. The tacos come full packed with avocado  chicken  cheese... just delicious  The guac was very simple  which to me is the best. The watermelon juice was one of the best I have ever had  very refreshing also.  Only con to this place is that it is outside so during the summer you do get a little hot but it s worth it. I will definitely be back.
Veracruz All Natural,471,This little school bus makes magic in a tortilla  Chips and guac are made fresh. The guacamole is more of chunky consistency than smooth aka the best kind. The mango fresca was hands down one of the most delicious drinks I ve ever had   Even if you re not a mango fan  which would be weird   grab one of their frescas    And for the tacos....heaven in a rainbow blanket. I ordered the migas poblanas and chorizo egg. I normally don t even like peppers but that poblano though...grilled to perfection  You can order your tacos with either corn or flour tortillas  but if you like tasty food  go with corn.
Veracruz All Natural,472,Damn good tacos.... but only if you can avoid the wait. I went one day and there was at least an hour wait... line was barely moving. No thanks. I don t like to wait hours for food.   I came super early another morning and still had about a 10 minute wait. We got the migas and al pastor tacos. I thought migas was the star  everyone else does too .   These were not life changing tacos but tasty options.
Veracruz All Natural,473,Like many others in Austin  I am here to say that the tacos at Veracruz are the best tacos in the city. What separates them in my eyes are three fold. 1.  Their corn Tortillas. Every great taco starts with a great tortilla  and the corn tortillas are the best I have had in Austin so far. 2. They have the freshest ingredients  and you can absolutely taste it. 3. The quality of their meat and how tender and flavorful the meat is....is unbeatable. The meat here separates its from the rest. I have had all of their tacos  and their migas taco is award winning  but I find myself ordering the pork  Al Pastor  and steak tacos...even at 8 00 am. i just cant get enough of them.
Veracruz All Natural,474,Very good tacos. The pastor had the texture of a pulled pork with little bits of pineapple and was both light and tangy. The migas were highly touted by food reviewers and held up as a rock solid rendition of eggs  potatoes  poblanos  cheese  and avocado perfectly mixed together. There s a coffee stand inside that does good work. You can come here and eat a healthy and large meal and get great coffee.
Veracruz All Natural,475,Closed at 1 pm     No phone number to contact.  What a waste of time and gas.  There was no explanation as to why they were closed at 1 vs 3 pm like it says online. NEGATIVE STARS ON MY END.
Veracruz All Natural,476,This place is amazing  Best tacos  breakfast and regular  that we ve ever had. Our favorites were the Migas and el pastor. Their fresh juice was good too 
Veracruz All Natural,477,The tacos were good but I felt like this place was over-hyped.  I had a miga breakfast taco  chorizo taco  and fish taco. They were all good  but the service was really slow and unorganized.  I get that it s a food truck  kind of  but it has 2 windows and clearly they have a system down.  One of my friend s orders was so messed up  she ended up having to order 3 times to get it right.  Once she got the receipt in her email it was like  ok that s not what I said....And then when I went to get my food  I got someone else s order and we had to figure out that mess.  The wait was fairly long  maybe close to 30 minutes.  For tacos.  I was just visiting so I am no expert on the tact scene  but it s Texas there are lots of taco options right   But they weren t as overpriced as food trucks usually are  so if you re in the neighborhood and the wait isn t crazy  go for it.  The tacos were way more filling than I expected  I just tasted me 2nd two tacos because I was full but wanted to know how they were.
Veracruz All Natural,478,Best. Breakfast. Tacos. Ever  Came to Austin for the weekend and left so satisfied    Got the migas. Changed my life. I ll never be the same woman after these tacos and they gave me all the energy I needed. The freshly squeezed orange juice was divine.   Overall  just incredibly delicious. If I was a local  I could certainly eat here multiple times a week.   TRY THE MIGAS 
Veracruz All Natural,479,Came in late Sunday morning with a bunch of friends  craving breakfast tacos on our last day of our trip in Austin. Ordered two tacos for myself  and tried cactus for the first time. YUM. It wasn t as crunchy as I had expected  but it had absorbed all the juices from the chorizo that I had ordered it with.  The line was a little long  and the wait for food was even longer. I suppose this is to be expected as all food is made to order. We did see many people before and after us ordering watermelon drinks  which sounded delicious in the summer heat  but I just didn t want to wait in line again. Turns out drinks come out a lot faster than food  oh well...
Veracruz All Natural,480,The migas breakfast taco is hands down the best breakfast taco I ve ever had in my life. The tortilla is never soggy. The tortilla chips inside are always crunchy. The cheese is always melted perfectly. The peppers  avocados  and onions all taste so fresh. I ve eaten at this Veracruz and the others  and I have never had a subpar migas breakfast taco. Sometimes I get the migas poblanos  which is also great. The poblano really adds another layer of sweet crunchiness. I love all three salsas  but my favorite is the spiciest one.
Veracruz All Natural,481,Authentic and delicious Mexican food. Hard to find here in Austin.  rale   Lot of love put into everything.  Thank you 
Veracruz All Natural,482,Sunday morning and waiting 45 minutes for our tacos once we placed our order.... Ordering online requires you to create an account and password.  Clunky and painful process just to get a few breakfast tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,483,In from out of town and the wanting true Austin breakfast tacos  the Yelp guided us here last Saturday. We were not disappointed.  Between the two of us  we tried a chorizo  pastor and steak taco. All were good  but the pastor was amazing. I usually order corn tortillas  but opted for flour. A serendipitous change  as their flour tortillas were spectacular.  If I had to guess  I would think they were made to order.   The hot sauces and salsa were a great accompaniment and the guacamole was perfect.   Took some restraint to not go back on Sunday.
Veracruz All Natural,484,We had Migas originales and poblanos. Also had chille relleno. Loved it all. They could with little less sodium  that s the only thing. Everything else- hygiene  decor  staff  wait time etc. was very good. I recommend this place.
Veracruz All Natural,485,Some of the best food I ve put in my mouth   Be prepared to wait but so worth it   Migas taco a MUST 
Veracruz All Natural,486,If you need your taco fix this is definitely the place you want to go. The ingredients are fresh and the flavor is bold. There may be a long line but it goes fast and is worth the wait. Pictured is the migas and the fish taco  both were amazing but if I had to choose my favorite it would be the fish taco . Also had the Al Pastor and chorizo and egg. Cant go wrong. They also have fresh fruit juices and smoothies that looked refreshing
Veracruz All Natural,487,Honestly  I didn t think it was possible. When something has been so overhyped and your expectations are so astronomically high  you always have that tiny voice in the back of your head saying  prepare to be let down . Even when you temper your expectations because you re a food-realist  you still can t shake the opinions of throngs of hipsters  foodies  and bloggers who stake their reputation on this particular hill. As it turns out  I have now been to the mountaintop  and it was  better than  good.   In all seriousness  these were potentially some of the best tacos I ve ever tasted in the US  rivaling the best I ve had in San Diego  San Antonio  and Chicago  side note  if anyone tells you San Francisco has the best tacos  just walk away  there s no known cure for sure delusion . Honestly  I couldn t find a single flaw in Veracruz All Natural s taco game. The tortillas were doughy without being undercooked. They had the perfect pliability. The size was right. You didn t feel like they were throwing street tacos at you to mask cheating you out of tortilla. But  you also didn t feel like you had to tuck the ends to keep from having leftover tortilla butts. The content was proportioned right and cooked perfectly. The migas poblanas did an excellent job of ensuring the chili didn t overpower the eggs. The la reyna blended the ingredients well  ensuring you tasted the flavor combinations instead of tasting something different in each bite. Even the make your own combination couldn t miss.   The only real critique I have is that the wait was ridiculous and the patio space was gross. They really should hire someone to just maintain the outside  clear tables  restock salsas  sweep the patio  keep away birds  etc . But  the food was that good  it s easy to forgive the lack of general maintenance. If you want the best breakfast tacos out there  give this place a try.
Veracruz All Natural,488,We arrived before they even opened and were expecting a long line but we were the only ones there. We order the migas which were pretty good but not as amazing and awesome as we had been expecting. A bit bland and a bit over priced.
Veracruz All Natural,489,Don t click on the map because it gives the wrong pinpoint   Anyway  after going in circles to different locations  we finally found the place.  Line isn t so long and is worth maybe a 10 minute wait.  Since it is a truck  you ll be seated outdoors.  There s shared shared tables  around but the majority seems to be near garbage and dumpsters.  So you will have flies around you while eating.  Other than that  all tasted great.   35 for 3 tacos  a special  agua fresca  coffee  and bottled water.  The al pastor was my favorite among the tacos.  The watermelon fresca was good too.
Veracruz All Natural,490,Yes  the tacos  the tacos -- but have y all tried their chicken quesadilla  It is huge and giant. You can split that and a giant aqua fresca  so good  so freaking good  with a friend and call it a meal.   I don t understand people who complain about the wait. Why is it OK to wait 15-20 minutes for your food at a sit-down restaurant but not a food truck  I don t expect food trucks to be like fast food. In fact  I don t want them to be like that.
Veracruz All Natural,491,All I can say is having lived in Austin 10 years and eaten taco nearly every day  Veracruz is by far and away my first choice and favorite spot. Their natural ingredient tacos are better than homemade.
Veracruz All Natural,492,Stopped here with my family as we were on our way back to Dallas and omg  Best decision ever  We happened to run into it and we said what the heck let s try it. My fiance is from San Diego and the whole vibe around here made him feel like he was back in Cali  The food and the aguas frescas were amazing  We had the Taco al Pastor Fish Taco Steal Taco and some chips and guacamole. Everything was superb  I even took another Sandia Agua to go  Will definitely be coming back here again 
Veracruz All Natural,493,I have been on Austin for 6 years now and this has by far been my Favorite place for tacos  I know strong to say but best tacos in Austin  Always fresh  great flavors  great sauces  I could live off of their tacos everyday all day 
Veracruz All Natural,494,These tacos are as good as people say they are    On my third trip to Austin I finally had the opportunity to grub on some Veracruz  the other two attempts were made on a weekend and there was no way I was waiting in the crazy lines . We came on a Monday around 11am and there were only a couple people in line. There are a few parking spaces in the adjacent lot but street parking is probably easier.   I had a migas taco and an al pastor taco. My husband had a migas and a egg cheese chorizo. They were allllllll soooooo goooooood. That migas  man it s tasty    I feel like there s sazon or some kind of msg-something it in cause the lingering savory flavor in your mouth is not of this world. Thinking about it now  I wish I had 6 in front of me    I recommend 2-3 tacos per person. I wish we didn t have a juice somewhere else before we arrived cause the frescas looked oh-so refreshing. Next time....
Veracruz All Natural,495,I was in Austin for a weekend and had read that I must try the migas breakfast taco here. BOY AM I GLAD I DID  Truly the most delicious taco of my life. It was so full of flavor and seriously the perfect combination of spice and ingredients- eggs  pico  avocado  and oh goodness those tortilla chips  Literally oozing with flavor. Now if only they could bring this tastiness to Los Angeles 
Veracruz All Natural,496,The truck has finally landed on Manchaca  And all I can say is that I wish it were closer to me.  But it sits right next door to my cousin s place on the lot of Radio Coffebar and that s a good thing. Radio and Veracruz make great synergy  A match made in hipster heaven.  Just imagine the best tacos ever with some cool coffee people right next door. OK  if that isn t specific enough  the roll this in your tortilla and drink it....  The Migas taco  Perfectly textured and tasty.  The Chicken Mole taco  Earthy and streety. The corn tortillas  Fresh and toasty. The salsas  They have that really authentic pale green stuff that rocks  Absolutely Rocks. I wish I knew what it was called. And their red. Ohh...almost tastes garlicky. Very cool They both mix mex exceedingly well.   In addition to those tacos I also accidentally took receipt of a chorizo taco. The idea of eating chorizo by itself is...strange...to say the least. Not sure what to say other than  I didn t ask for or pay for it so....thanks  .  I would say that 2 and a half tacos make a very filling meal.  You will not find a huge selection of meat options such as lengua  but what you do get is very fresh  very hot and very tasty. I have decided that I WILL sit out under the hot summer sun in South Austin to enjoy it. Time and again. Oh  and the hibiscus mint tea next door is great too....but that is another topic for another day.
Veracruz All Natural,497,Every time I go the employees are so rude to me. I don t care how cheap and good something is. I don t need to be talked down too. Atleast this is the Round Rock Store.
Veracruz All Natural,498,So  I tried 3 tacos  the Veracruz Migas didn t really move me. I found it dry and while I liked the crunch  it was pretty bland. You shouldn t need salsa to make a taco have flavor.     I did enjoy my combo breakfast taco that I stuffed with all sorts of fillings. I also got the Al Pastor -- those were my favs and I left the Migas uneaten.  Pretty straightforward  they have a few tables next to a gated up plot of green land so it s a bit picturesque. It can be tough to get into out of the driveway given traffic and it s only a 2 lane road. Parking lot is a dirt patch with a handful of spots so  it can be a little tight. Pricing is pretty good.  The buzzer system is weird -- sometimes it buzzes  sometimes they call out your number. And  the condiments -- were not checked up on   kept tidy and they were running out  scraping the bottom of the containers running out .
Veracruz All Natural,499,Both the fish taco and the steak taco were amazing here  The steak wasn t over cooked and tasted really good with the light green salsa that had a good kick to it. The fish taco had some chopped up mango pieces and it was super fresh  10 10 recommend
Veracruz All Natural,500,The wait for well worth it. The tacos are wholesome and delicious and the Agua frescas  I had cucumber  during the summer was a godsent   Must go
