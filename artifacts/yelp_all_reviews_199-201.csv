Bulevar,1,Wonderful new restaurant  Beautiful decor  great service and the food is amazing  I can t wait to go back 
Bulevar,2,I went there With my family we got the chips and dips of all kinds. The food took a very long time to come out and the portions were very small. I got the tacos two of them and each of them you could eat in one bite . Very pricey
Bulevar,3,Wonderful service  Thanks Jake  and delicious plates  The stripe bass and bone in filet were outstanding. We ll be back 
Bulevar,4,One word to describe this place AMAZING.. okay maybe two words INSANELY GOOD. Hubs and I tried this place and let s just say from drinks to appetizers to main course everything was phenomenal. I had their LA SIRENA drink and the PASION Y PARAISO both were amazing.  We also had the salsa tasting  tuna tostada  and Hamachi collar as starter and they were all flavorful  good starter portion and delicious. For main dish i had the chicken  full of flavor and so moist and hubby had Mixto Pibil which was juicy and so flavorful.  Highly recommend this place. We loved it so much that we will be going back next week to celebrate a friends birthday  amp  bring our friends end of the year when they are visiting ATX. The service was also exceptional  our waitress Monica was so sweet and nice.
Bulevar,5,Great new spot  with plenty of dishes to try. We came by on a Wednesday during HH and by the time we left  the place was packed. I definitely recommend getting a reservation. Make sure to note  if you want to take part in the HH  you need to be sitting in the bar area  bar or tables .  We ordered the following  Salsa Tasting Hamachi Taco De Trompo Fish of the Day Sweet Potato Corn Churros  We were definitely stuffed by the time we left. Hands down favorite was the Tacos de Trompo. They were filled with an explosion of flavor in every bite. I easily could have ordered 3 orders of just those and been very happy.    Biggest disappointment were the salas and hamchi. Both were on the expensive side and simply just not worth it  taste or cost .  Definitely should have stuck with the queuso.   All that being said  the chips and tortillas were great  and the sweet potato was a surprise gem. Lastly  if you are going for happy hour  make sure to order the Hielo Mescal. It may look small  but it packs a punch   We ll be back to try some additional dishes.
Bulevar,6,If I could give 10 stars I would  My fianc e and I chose Bulevar for our weekend date night. We made reservations for a Saturday around 5 30pm. When we arrived there was a very short wait . Everyone was so so nice and accommodating  We had three separate waiters  which is a great touch since they got busier as the night went on  I started out with a drink  the PASION Y PARAISO. Be warned   Their drinks are STRONG . I m not a heavy drinker so I couldn t make it through that drink so I orderd the LA SIRENA. She was a STAR and I managed to finish the entire drink. Lastly   yes I ordered 3 drinks  I tried the MARGARITA DE LA CASA with added mezcal  I believe  to make it spicy  Winner Winner as well   On to the food  to start  we orderd the SALSA TASTING and the DON FRIJOLE Y QUESO  The salsa s were all delicious. My favorite was the spicy one   don t remember the name but they ll tell you which is which . The queso was very good as well  but I personally didn t like all of the refried black beans. There was a thin layer of cheese and and after two or three scoops the queso is over powers by beans.   Our main course consisted of SOPES DE TROMPO and SHRIMP  each were so flavorful and delicious. I can t say enough about  how much we enjoyed this restaurant   If you don t go for the food and drinks  at least go for the immaculate ambiance  The views are breath taking.  The entire rest is beautiful decorated and gives a sense of calm and whisks you away to some paradise   Bulevar  thank you for one of the best dining experiences I ve had in months 
Bulevar,7,Gorgeous view  they really changed this place up from its Z Tejas days    While I tried my best to not compare this place to ATX Cocina  it was a little hard. I think Bulevar is on it s way  but not quite to the level of excellence its  older sister has achieved.   We got the bean dip to begin with  and unfortunately the texture and flavor were a little off - slightly sour    After that  we noticed we had to wait a very long time for service food  and spent much  much longer at dinner than we would ve expected.   We split a few other apps and the chicken dish. All of it was well cooked and seasoned  but I still didn t find myself enjoying everything quite as much as ATX Cocina. I do prefer this location AND this stunning view  though    While normally I d put this at a 3  I know there are some growing pains involved with a new location. I REALLY look forward to coming back and seeing this place blossom into its  own 
Bulevar,8,Finally  A GREAT restaurant in Austin that lives up to the hype. Part of the red ash group we wanted to give this restaurant a try. Everything about ambiance  service  to food was amazing    Our favorite dishes were the hamachi  sopes de trompo  and the fish split with two sauces. I hear all the fish dishes are all good and out of this world so I definitely recommend it    We definitely be back although reservations are now tight  However  not surprised...
Bulevar,9,Great services from the host  manager  server  to assistant servers. We were there on a Saturday at 7 30pm. They seemed hustling and bustling.   I highly recommend the bone in ribeye  tender and juicy  and Esquites  corn . We also had the guacamole with gumbo lump crabmeat and hamachi for appetizer  but the hamachi ended up coming out with our entrees. Their seafood items all came out much later for some reason including the scallops. We also ordered the half roasted chicken  Pollo a las Brasas   which was nicely done with the creamy sauce.   The drinks were ok  Artnom 1146 Anejo tequila with agave  Manhattan  Dirty Martini  and Campo de Suernos.  Giant props  the seats are comfortable   Always a BIG positive in my book.   It s a great place for dates  friends  etc. I actually saw a guest with a baby carrier  I didn t hear the baby cry though.
Bulevar,10,This place is fun to go with a big group of friends. The restaurant itself is very loud and there s a lot going on at all times. If you want a more romantic and pleasant experience you definitely want to eat outside. It s almost like two different restaurants in terms of atmosphere. Party inside and chill outside. I didn t sit at the bar  but it seems like a cool spot to grab a cocktail and quick bite.  Food was good. Cocktails were decent.  The crowd is mostly 30 . I don t know if this is a fair comparison but the vibes on the inside are similar to Fonda San Miguel and the outside is like The Oasis  Just in terms of the place not the food. Food is better here.
Bulevar,11,I really enjoyed my first visit to Bulevar. They opened in the space where Z Tejas used to be. Same restaurant group  Larry Foles   just new concept.   Aesthetically  The space is gorgeous  They made the bar much bigger and added tons of additional seating. Probably seats 20-30   Service  15 10    The staff was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. Everyone we interacted with from the hostesses to the servers  it was flawless. Each table has 2 servers to ensure great customer service and no delays.   Drinks  15 10    They have an extensive tequila  amp  mezcal list  which is to be expected  however their most popular margarita on the menu was so tasty we had quite a few each. Pricey but worth it.  Food  10 10 - Upon initial glance at the menu  I didn t see anything that caught my eye. However after speaking with the server  he recommended quite a variety of things to try. We shared everything we ordered   Guacamole  12 10 - exceptional flavor without being too spicy  salty  lime-y  etc.  Salsa sampler  the verde salsa was hands down the best. Next time I go back I ll just ask for that one.  Bone-In Filet  16oz   15 10 it was to die for   So tender  already cut off the bone. Perfect amount for 2 of us to split with everything else we had.  Shishito Peppers  6 10 - They were flavorful but honestly too smokey for me  and I typically love shishitos  Hamachi  10 10 - fantastic balance of flavors with tons of meat to enjoy  Elote  8 10 - I personally didn t try  but my friend said it was a great accompaniment to a main course  Empanada  9 10 - the fact that it has goat cheese in it is what sold us on trying it. I found it to be perfectly balanced flavor wise and definitely worth a try.  Churros  10 10 - who doesn t love homemade churros   They had a perfect crunch and came with both a caramel  amp  chocolate dipping sauce.   Overall the visit definitely warranted 5 stars and I ll be back. I recommend making a reservation as they re starting to get much busier. Luckily we had one  but for a Tuesday evening at 7pm they had an hour long wait for a party of 2 without one.
Bulevar,12,Super stylish place. Fun atmosphere.  Para La Mesa   Sopes De Trompo - 5 5 Machete - 4 5 Coal Roasted Sweet Potato - 5 5 Brussels - 5 5 Elote - 5 5 Coal Blistered Shishitos - 5 5  Raw  amp  Cured   East Coast Oysters - 5 5  Mains   Mixto Pibil - 4 5 Scallop - 5 5  The sopes are delicious  my favorite appetizer. All the veggies are amazing. The sweet potato has a nice sauce and flavor  so do the brussels and elote. Oysters are really good  and so are the scallops. The machete and pibil were a little too mushy for my taste  and lacked flavor.
Bulevar,13,Food  Yes. Ambiance  Yes. BUT THE SERVICE  HELL YES.  I made a reservation online and put that it was my wife s birthday. They wished her a happy birthday when we sat down and then at the end they gave her a hand written happy birthday card as well as dessert on the house. Make your reservations now   P.S Sammie is a vibe
Bulevar,14,The food and drinks were delicious  but what made the experience great was the service  The staff made us feel right at home and made sure we had everything we needed.   We really wanted to try the machete but they were sold out for the night. We had the duck carnitas huarache instead  per recommendation  and it did not disappoint. It was super tender and did not have the gamey taste I was expecting. The real highlight of the night was the pollo a las brasas. My husband typically does not like chicken  but this dish may be the exception. The chicken was perfectly cooked - juicy and tender and it also had a unique smokey flavor.   There are so many other dishes I d love to try. Can t wait to go back 
Bulevar,15,Delish new spot in north Austin  It s very fancy for the area  imo  but seemed to be hopping when we went early evening on a Saturday. Love the parking lot and gorgeous patio overlooking some hills. The chicken and machete were delicious  Machete was less flavorful for me but it was still super tender and good.
Bulevar,16,One of the best happy hours in Austin  if you enjoy mezcal tequila .  Bulevar is located in the old Z Tejas building  nestled in the hills off 360. The architecture was always gorgeous  but Bulevar has managed to elevate it with great artwork.  The bar is front and center as you walk in  with plenty of seating. This is key  because you can only enjoy HH at the bar  the small lounge  or on the patio. I d recommend the patio if it s available  the hill country views are absolutely gorgeous.   The happy hour menu is relatively limited  with one mezcal cocktail  a house margarita  beer and wine. Both the boozy drinks were great  but for me  mezcal is a one-and-done affair. I just can t tolerate that much smokiness in a drink.  The small plates on happy hour are all solid  but the Machete stands head and shoulders about the rest. The wife and I ordered it three times.   If there was any complaint  when we walked in we were told that we couldn t sit at the patio as it was  fully booked.  It was never more than half full the entire time we were there  we actually took a lap right before we left and there were only 4 or 5 parties out there. Oh well  our tab for several drinks and multiple small plates was just over  60  which is extremely reasonable for Austin in 2022.
Bulevar,17,All I can say is believe the hype--my meal at Bulevar was hands down one of the best meals I ve had in 2022  probably longer. Add great service and a beautiful ambience and I was BLOWN away     We had  -House margs--not too sweet  tasted like real lime -Herby guac--great   -Don frijole y queso--will want this ALL the time no question -Shishitos--sooo good and a huge portion  unlike any shishitos I ve ever had and I loved them -Tacos de trompo--incredible flavor and texture  I wanted more than just one to myself  -Tuna tostada--tuna was super fresh  loved the sauce too -Pollo a las brasas--one of the best chicken dishes I ve ever had at a restaurant  so juicy and flavorful and omg I could drink that corn pur e -Tres leches--I m calling it  this is MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT DESSERT I VE EVER HAD   literally teared up after the first bite. I want my birthday cake to just be a giant version of this. If you go for nothing else from this review  get the damn tres leches.  ALREADY LOVE U BULEVAR    
Bulevar,18,Loved the ambience and overall atmosphere. The food was great. We were looking forward to trying the bone marrow dish  however it was no longer available at the time for some reason. Hope they bring it back so we can try it next time. Everything else we had was delicious and can t wait to be back 
Bulevar,19,EVERYTHING IS 100  GLUTEN FREE  and delicious. I deeply appreciated how I could eat anything I wanted on the menu and worry-free. They even had GLUTEN FREE churros. My favorite dish was the Scallops -- so well executed.  Even though the food was fantastic  the main star of my experience was the staff. My waiter  Daniel  was probably the best waiter I ve ever had at a restaurant. He was patient with my party of 6  thoughtful  attentive  cool and just on top of things. On top of that  the hostess Abby just had the best energy as well and was so helpful with helping my party get seated. Top tier customer service from genuine people 
Bulevar,20,Had the Machete  Himachi  Sopes Taratarand the Chicken entre. Everything was fantastic. The service was antentive  friendly and eager to answrr quuestions about menu items. The interior had a modern chic vibe with open kitchen. I live in Rough Hollow 25 minutes away amd it was worth the drive and I will go back.
Bulevar,21,everything was so good  our server was knowledgeable of everything and recommended the dishes that we thoroughly enjoyed. there is a complimentary valet parking available 
Bulevar,22,This place was great. If you have celiac disease like myself or a gluten allergy  I would 100  recommend.   Everything on the menu is gluten free down to their sauces which made eating out a  normal  and worry free experience for me. Everything we had was so delicious. Salsa sampler  machete  hamachi  steak    One star off for two reasons  quite pricey  didn t know how much it would be until the end since steaks vary   amp  because it did take about 2 hrs to complete the meal. They are new so it totally makes sense that they got slammed this weekend and they offered us a free duck app when noticed we had been waiting so long. That was very kind and we appreciated the service.   Staff was very kind and knowledgeable about all menu items. We can t wait to come back on a weekday soon 
Bulevar,23,Food was impeccable  Service was great as our server was so knowledgeable from food to cocktails. The ambience on the patio was cozy  back drop was beautiful. We made our way through the menu so the time in between was great for us.
Bulevar,24,Finally  a swanky spot up north for cocktails and apps that s not in the domain   This spot is where the old ztejas used to be and back then I ve never seen it this full.   The vibe is what you want for a nicer dinner and the views outside are gorgeous.   We ended up getting a few dishes to share which includes the guac  sopes  oysters  bone marrow and churro to finish the night off.  The sopes came with 3 and the meat on top was tender  the masa base was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. 10 10  The oysters came out with a chimichurri sauce that made your tastebuds dance.   The bone marrow was good  but I will admit it was small compared to the other ones I ve had in austin. It also came with a side of beef tips which was super tasty but seemed to be there to offset the size.   I loved how scrumptious the churros were  just like the sopes they were crispy and fluffy. The dolce de leche dipping sauce was a perfect match and it also came with chocolate dipping sauce  The guac was just guac. We ended up getting the herby version. Nothing to write home about   Overall the vibes were great  drinks were strong and really enjoyed the service.
Bulevar,25,I have to say what a snapshot of what real authentic Mexican food with a twist of Texas looks and taste like   Tonight I enjoyed a bit of the HH menu and the regular menu. I stated with there Margarita De La Casa which was fresh non sugary and super light.  Followed that with there Heirloom Ayocote Bean Ensalada  which consisted of greens chickpea pur e nopales but really couldn t say I tasted nopales in my salad with a nice under-bearing lime vinaigrette. I then went back to the HH menu since I was almost a bit full and order there twist a street tacos  called Taco De Tromp ....talk about so many flavors exploding       Pork belly  flank steak adobe pineapple habanero in a corn tortilla....the sweetness of the pineapple lighten the spice but it still has a bite to it.....having said that...it s a must order for 2 as an appetizer or for one as a dinner option.  The service was spot on  My waitress was knowledgeable on every item and how and what it consisted of  Great replacement to the previous establishment- Z Tejas
Bulevar,26,I would like to let you know our experience last night at your restaurant. We had a reservation for 6ppm at 7pm and the waiter started off amazing telling us we should order our food and it will all come out at a great flow.   We got our drinks and the guacamole and then THAT WAS IT   We didn t see our food again for a very long time  then my husband waited even longer for his 2nd drink.   The food finally came by the manager but it must have been well over 30  40 minutes and that was it. I feel like maybe they could have taken care of an appetizer or something after waiting that long  It was a very expensive meal with not matching service. I m sad bc I brought my whole family in to celebrate my sister in laws 40th.
Bulevar,27,This is really Mexican food for people that like their food to be quiet and polite  and not have any sort of loud flavor. We were very excited to come here  because we like ATX Cocina  but wow the disappointment.  We started with the salsa tasting  which I don t understand how it can be in the menu. No heat  no flavor. Basic  salsas   if you can even call them that   like the stuff you get with 2 dollar empanadas in any truck. Their salsa roja is particularly offensive. Tastes like oil and nothing else.  The  herb-guac  is smashed avocado. That s it. And hey  we love avocado. But you  1  can t call that  herby   and  2  you should not call that guac either. Again  no seasoning  and we kept looking for the salt.  The duck huarache was fine. The meat was very tasty. Lacked any sort of surprise  though. Where s the acidity  The spiciness  MIA. The hamachi was the same thing. Nice  but I want something more  All very one note  pretty bland.  Then we get to the tuna tostada. This fish died in vain. Absolutely no seasoning at all. No salt  no acidity  no nothing. As a lover of tuna tostadas  I found this dish offensive. It should get rethought or taken out of the menu.  Finally  we had the shrimps. I ll recognize I thought they were tasty  but unfortunately they had probably been sitting out for 20 min when we got them. They were cold and stuff was soggy  not great for texture.  Drinks were good. I always enjoy a spicy margarita  and the eucalypso was great too.   In terms of service  for what they are aspiring to  they ve got a long way to go. When we get there at 8pm for our 8pm reservation  the hostess is very rude and tells us that our table is not ready and that we have to wait. She sends outside  without offering to take our drink order or anything  and we sit there for a while until they are finally ready  still the coordination doesn t seem to work  because we are asked again inside whether we have a reservation . I will say our server was very nice and on top of things.  Overall the whole night was pretty bad. Food was beyond disappointing  ambiance was not good  and it all started on the wrong foot thanks to the hostess. Will not be coming back.
Bulevar,28,Okayyy this place really surprised me  There are a lot of good  high-end Mexican restaurants and this might be at the top or very close. Everything we had was so good  Duck carnitas huarache  mixto pibil  tuna tostada  and sopes. Ambience is also great and service was fast. The drinks were okay  and strongg .
Bulevar,29,We had an excellent time last night at Bulevar. Decided to sit at the bar which in my opinion had the most potential for the best experience. We were honored to meet Larry  the owner of the restaurant. What a generous and kind person. The staff and service entirely is on point  5 stars 
Bulevar,30,Food I m sure is great doesn t cater to vegetarians  thanks but not coming back   .    My party also had entrees come out could as well. The service wasn t bad  very attentive and helpful but over all not the greatest.  I got sick the next morning  cross contamination for sure. I realize this isn t a restaurant for vegetarians  but I was just going to dinner with my family they wanted to eat here. Regardless of the focus of a kitchen most places accommodate for veg or vegan people. This place does not  the waitress we had convinced me they had the ability to accommodate   I got some burnt Brussel sprouts and cold corn for dinner because she forgot to ask the chef to accommodate  gave me some fake excuse  she said the chef was unwilling to accommodate   like a big middle finger on top of already being disappointed about not being able to really order anything.
Bulevar,31,Still a new restaurant working out kinks. A lot of staff members waiting on the kitchen. Food production is slow. Waited 30  minutes for our appetizers. Some foods were salty and sounded better on the menu vs. upon taste. Great location and good for groups.
Bulevar,32,Bulevar has very quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Austin  ATX Cocina  their sister restaurant  has some friendly competition  The atmosphere is absolutely breathtaking  the design is phenomenal  and the food is incredible  I highly recommend the sirloin  the tuna tostada  and the frioles con queso. You really can t go wrong with anything on the menu  I can t wait to go back again 
Bulevar,33,Loved our experience here and plan on returning very soon. The scallops were cooked perfectly and most likely the best I ve ever had.  My partner s oysters were also noteworthy. The mignonette sauce was very bright and just begging to dress up every oyster. My cocktail was also flavorful  but I d like to try the others on the menu next time.  Overall  I could rate the service and the food more than 5 star. Very pleased.
Bulevar,34,Wow  what an amazing restaurant. Bulevar checks off all the boxes  wonderful atmosphere  delicious food  excellent service. The scallops and bacon was absolutely amazing one of the best dishes I have ever had  nutty guacamole and salsa tasting so tasty. La Sirena also one of the best cocktails and the frozen mezcal was exquisite. Our server Itzuri was amazing  every staff member was very friendly  thank you for the epic experience 
Bulevar,35,Somewhat disappointing given the price.   Went for dinner last night for my wife s birthday. Party of 5. Very happy they fit us in at the last minute  so thanks to the hostesses.  Total meal took  2 hours  of which 90 minutes was waiting for our mains. The beans and queso were very good but did not include enough chips to finish it  and the servers did not notice we had 1 2 left .   The mains   135 porterhouse - perfectly cooked  but lower quality meat than I expected for the price.   28 chicken - perfectly cooked. The corn pur e was way too sweet.  14 Brussels sprouts - delicious  with an Asian flare.  Service was somewhat lacking during the meal  with little follow up and no interest in how we were enjoying our meal  or not .   In the end  not bad  but I don t anticipate ever coming back.
Bulevar,36,Top notch steak spot. Be prepared to order one steak and split it because they re huge. Be prepared to work your way through the small plates and finish with a bang.
Bulevar,37,Who knew a building could be redone so well   The food is absolutely delicious  Flavor galore  The plating is beautiful  drinks were unique and tasty  I wish I could give more stars   Everything was perfect  I can t wait to go back   Don t miss the Mixto Pibil was my absolute favorite  and I didn t get a photo  but you should Definitely get it  
Bulevar,38,We had their Gulf Snapper  Duck  Salsa sampler and Mixta Pibil. We really like Mixta Pibil and the Gulf Snapper.
Bulevar,39,The food was amazing  the space looks really pleasing  the staff was very friendly. The only thing that was less than 100  positive was the wait time. Our reservation  8pm  was close to closing time  9pm   so that might have has a factor in it. And we got a free tostada for our wait.  Food-wise I was blown away. The crab-meat guac was so tasty. The Japanese sweet potatoes were unlike anything I ve eaten before. In a great way. We got an NY strip steak which was within my top 5 of steaks ever eaten. So well cooked and seasoned. I would definitely go back   
Bulevar,40,Went with 4 friends to celebrate birthday. Restaurant is beautiful  Service was impeccable  We tasted many dishes on and off of the happy hour menu. First  a salsa sampler. Three of the four were tasty but the sweet one had a weird aftertaste and none of us liked it. The herby guacamole was delicious  Oh  the HH margaritas were really great - not too sweet. We also had the Don Frejol bean queso but none of us thought it had flavor.  Adding the salsa helped. We tried the tacos de trumpo and they were delicious  Next  the shrimp dish  yummy  the crab tostada  amazing    and the empanada  just okay . Now we re full  Oh  Oysters  Briny and wonderful  I d come back  It s really quite nice 
Bulevar,41,A friend and I grabbed dinner at Bulevar on a Thursday and it looked busy  We shared the chips  amp  salsa and the Brussels sprouts. I got the bone in rib eye. For the beef  you pay per the ounce. It came out with onions on the side. I wish there was some rice but I got some tortillas and it tasted just as good. The views were really nice outside. It overlooks a bunch of trees. I would highly recommend this place for dinner and make a reservation. Parking was easy. There s a big parking lot but if you can t find parking  there s complimentary valet.
Bulevar,42,Really good food   I tried the sea bass and it was honestly the tastiest fish I ve had in a very long time   We also tried their Hielo Mezcal which is tiny but mighty lol all you ll probably need is 2   I will definitely be back  10 10 
Bulevar,43,Great ambiance  delicious food  and the service was superb. We tried a lot of items of the menu starting off with sopes de trompo which were flavorful but so tiny I would hesitate to order again. We also tried Don Frijol and Queso and the Lump Crab Guacamole which were quickly devoured as they were paired with delicious homemade totopos. Machete was enough to share among four adults  the duck huarache  chef s kiss  and a must try in my humble opinion. As far as main dish the mixto pibil was my favorite. The swordfish was also good and filing but if looking for something lighter highly recommend the shrimp dish instead. Each dish was delivered by a different runner while describing dishes main ingredients. To cap our dinner we tried the flan br l e that was topped off with berries  Overall we all loved the food and experience and excited to find elevated Mexican cuisine in Austin 
Bulevar,44,This place is beyond phenomenal. There was not one thing I ordered that I did not like. The cocktails are amazing. I am from Mexico and it s very hard for me to enjoy Mexican food here in Austin but I have to say this hands-down it is so good. I would definitely get a reservation starts if you have not been here. And the atmosphere and there s so beautiful And the employees are so nice.
Bulevar,45,Perfect place  Everything I ordered blew my mind. The staff truly cares and I never felt like they forgot about me. If you love interior design you will respect all the big and small details that went into making the restaurant beautiful. First impressions are important and they successfully have my respect.
Bulevar,46,Great ambiance and even better food. Took awhile to come out but worth it imo. The salsa  bean sampler is definitely recommended as an app. Order the tomahawk. You wont be disappointed.
Bulevar,47,Good food. Great view. Nice concept   Went there for my birthday dinner. The service was wonderful. And for a new place it s was great. Tried a lot of food
Bulevar,48,Everything about this place was wonderful. Great happy hour at the bar- frozen mezcal margarita is a must  We then moved to a table at the air conditioned patio and enjoyed the salsa tasting  machete  think delicious quesadilla   hamachi  so fresh and flavorful   and pollo a las brasas which may have been the best thing I ve eaten in a long time  They even had a high chair for our little one and were able to edit a few things on the menu to accommodate for him. I m so glad to finally have a wonderful restaurant in a beautiful space so close to home 
Bulevar,49,My partner and I were excited to try the this place out after it launched to good buzz. We arrived to our 6 30 reservation and were seated promptly on the balcony. Our servers arrived and after a rocky introduction from one of the servers who was clearly in training we put our drink and food orders in and settled in for the night. The first item to come was the Crab Tostada  which ended up being more of a crab tartar which was tasty but not what a tostada is. Next up was the Empanada  also tasty but was actually a Tetela and not an empanada. The Sopes de Trompo were next  again very tasty three small bites  I wish restaurants would portion things out in either 2 or 4 pieces and not 3 to fit common party sizes  but what can you do . This is where the evening starts to really dip. At this point we re about 30-40 minutes into service  and we have the Lechuga salad and Duck entr e coming. At about 7 40 the Lechuga arrives without the Duck  and it s huge for a side salad. Up until now the portions have been small and manageable  what you would expect from a mid- to upscale restaurant in line with their pricing. We wait  and wait  and realize after 10-15 minutes that we haven t seen our servers since before 7 30. At 8 15 I m finally able to flag them down from an adjacent table and ask for our check and to get our Duck entr e wrapped up to go  as they assured us it was on it s way. We are able to leave  entree uneaten  at 8 25. We won t be coming back. They didn t really try to apologize for anything  or even offer to comp anything. I get it  new restaurant  pandemic  etc. But in making the sale last night  they lost any future sales. In being so short sighted  they ve shorted themselves in the long run  and now they ve got this hit to their reputation to boot. We were so excited  we didn t want them to fail like this. The food was tasty  they just needed to be honest with themselves and with us. Such a shame.  Tl dr Inattentive  slow service  upper-mid level food at upscale prices  1 55 dinner service and we didn t even get to eat our entr e.
Bulevar,50,Outstanding service  food  atmosphere and all around excellent place to dine. Great selection of appetizers and extensive drink menu  not to mention the selection of tequila and mezcal. Highly recommend Bulevar
Bulevar,51,Loved the lump crab guacamole and excellent wine list   Great for date night up north  
Bulevar,52,The staff was super nice and very accommodating  It was a special occasion or us and we were running late  but everyone made us feel very welcomed.  The food was delicious and comes out as it s ready. The restaurant is beautiful. I can t wait to come back and sit on the patio during a sunset  Thank you Larry and Kevin for making this night extra special  The only downside was there is no kids menu  but my kiddo  age 3  devoured the chicken and a pineapple juice from the bar
Bulevar,53,The best restaurant I ve been to in Austin in a long long time. Crab guacamole was delicious to start. The lechuga salad was huge  and as a group of 3 we couldn t finish it. The chicken was the absolute best dish with creamy sauce that was to die for. The shrimp was great as well.
Bulevar,54,Bulevar is like ATX Cocina s young  pretty suburban sister. It s very inviting  from the dim lighting to the decor  it s organised  and there is a beautiful patio space to watch the sun go down. As expected  fantastic tequila list  nice selection of small and large plates  attentive waiters waitresses who thoughtfully describe dishes when placed down. House marg was solid altho ATX still does it better  sorry . Crab guac was refreshing but v salty especially when paired with their house tortilla chips. Hamachi  elote  don frijole  all tasty. Plantain in the crab tostada was thick  cold and dry- would be a lot better if it were thinner and crispier. Duck was phenomenal - never had mole amarillo before- total stand out. Will be back to try more of the larger plates before winter sneaks up on us
Bulevar,55,Had a great time and the staff was very attentive and friendly. Absolutely loved the Arbol salsa. Will definitely be going back. My friend told me I had to go get a selfie in the men s room. I was like what you talkin bout. Went in and found out why. Lol.
Bulevar,56,INCREDIBLE OMGGGGG I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS SPOT ENOUGH. Soooooo freaking good  Literally everything we had. Chefs kiss. I already want to go back. Can be pricey but my gosh it s so worth it. The Don Frijole was amazing.
Bulevar,57,Not much to say. Everything was spectacular. The Mixta Pibil has to be one of the great dishes in all of Austin. They have a great mezcal menu and they carry that smoky flavor successfully through the food menu as well.
Bulevar,58,The patio is great  the service started off attentive  but then fell off after ordering.  The appetizers were excellent  and we had high hopes  but then the entrees did not arrive at the same time  one guest sat for 15 minutes waiting while others had their food  drink order was forgotten and had to ask several times  probably took 30 minutes to finally get that margarita.  I understand they ve only been open a few weeks and have some kinks to work out  but overall the food and drinks pale in comparison to ATX Cocina  the flavors are just not there and we were pretty underwhelmed for a meal that cost over  200.
Bulevar,59,We have been twice in the last Month and already have reservations for a few weeks from now  Fantastic modern Mexican with great cocktails  an amazing view of the hill country and a fantastic staff - order the sweet potato  elote  and any of the meats cooked a las brasas 
Bulevar,60,Finally   A really good restaurant at the Arboretum   The food  the service  the ambiance.. it was all great   They fully took advantage of the space in the remodel. There s always been so much potential- I m glad someone finally tapped into it. I can t wait to enjoy the patio in warmer weather. The food was so well done and although they don t have a kids menu  I felt like there were plenty of options for my kids  they enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did.  Most plates are meant to be shared so it worked well for our family to try it all. The wine list was good and reasonably priced- we had a very good Spanish red blend. The service was great- attentive and knowledgeable staff  good pace on bringing out the dishes and all very friendly.   Please don t ever leave us Bulevar  The people of NW Austin need you    
Bulevar,61,Excellent food and service. The rohan duck  the striped bass  and the hamachi crudo were all amazing. Churros for dessert  best churros I ve had.
Bulevar,62,Excellent service and food. We enjoyed their happy hour. Loved their margaritas  Brussel Sprouts and chips and salsa were delicious.
Bulevar,63,Walked in at 5 30 on a Thursday to try this place. Snooty host said they would not seat anyone with out a reservation until 9pm but that I could sit in the bench out front for a drink. What a joke. Half the restaurant was empty. Bring back old Austin. Never coming back - this place will fail
Bulevar,64,It s been over 2 weeks since I wrote my review on the horrible experience I had.  Not 1 word from the the management   This was the first time at Bulevar.  It is SO OBVIOUS that the management does not care AT ALL.  REALLY SHAMEFUL 
Bulevar,65,Great Restarant  Starts with very nice landscaping of the front of the building First time tried a few appetizers and decided to comeback for more Second visit we had other appetizers one better then the other the lamb cheek stood out. One of the managers  Chad   gave us a whole presentation on their steaks  he was quite an expert We had the grilled chicken dish which was outstanding as well great service Going back for the steak which my friend the steak connossoir    Loved
Bulevar,66,Restaurant was a sold 5 out of 10. Great ambiance but the flavors of the actual food could use some work.
Bulevar,67,The old ZTejas location is now this upscale Mexican restaurant specializing in steaks and seafood. We sat at the bar because we didn t have a reservation. Our bartender  Rich  told us it was the busiest night they had had yet. Even though it was busy  our food came out pretty fast. We tried several small plates and a sampler of salsas. Cocktails for two of us and Mezcal for one. We were happy with our drinks. For entrees we had the scallops  the mixta pibil and the striped bass. All delicious. I would have liked just a little salt for the fish but it came with two sauces and it really was good. We shared flan and churros for dessert. Complimentary valet parking rounds out a very nice experience in North Austin.
Bulevar,68,I went here Sunday for the first time  and I absolutely loved it. We sat at the bar  and Alice  and all the bartenders  were absolutely lovely. On top of that the cocktails and food were superb. We got the herby guacamole and scallops and loved both. I get the feeling you really can t go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have a frozen mezcal margarita that is delish and is a must try  if you like mezcal . The last thing I ll say is that they did a really fantastic job with the decor and overall aesthetic  it is so polished and modern  esp as compared to Z Tejas that used to be in the space . I will definitely be going back as soon as possible 
Bulevar,69,Maybe an off evening  Long post warning. I normally don t write bad reviews but our experience was one for the books. Made a reservation for a friend and I to try out this restaurant after the rave reviews. The evening started off promising as we were able to get sat earlier and that s pretty much one of two good experiences here. First  our waiter greets us and gives his recommendations for their drink menu and regular menu. We decided on the margarita spicy  hers  with tajin mine with regular salt and a couple courses from each portion of the menu as suggested. Well... my drink was wrong the waiter was nice enough to re-submit my drink order and after thirty minutes it was still wrong. Oh well  must have been the bartenders. Food wise  we chose the sopes  lamb  and salsa sampler. The lamb was delicious  the salsa a sampler was ok and the sopes  Well... fast forward to an hour and fifteen minutes later the manager comes to our table to tell us the food wasn t up to standards and they are making fresh sopes for our table that should be coming out within a few minutes and for the wait it will be on the house. Well  they came out and where was our waiter you ask  No quite sure but when he came over to check on our table he told us the kitchen made a mistake and for some reason the order got lost   When we informed him the manager came over to talk to us and let us know what happened he said  ok  let s go with that  and walked away  Anyways  we decided to order their house old fashioned instead  which never came out  and we were told quite matter of fact that the gentlemen who took our drink order simply forgot to put it in. The rest of the food ordered was just OK oysters were fresh  snapper ceviche was ok  the scallops were not good  and the duck was a bit tough. When we asked about the tortillas which we assumed accompanied the main dishes the runner simply stated he didn t know if our dish came with tortillas. At this point we just start laughing because the service was so terrible. Fast forward to our tab  the sopes were not removed of which we had to tell a random waiter to remove from our check. After we received our tab without the sopes included  our lovely waiter graces our table with his presence to tell us he also comped one of our drinks for the wait and guess what... NOPE still charged for the drinks. We would have mentioned it but given the course of the evening we would still be there the following day waiting for service. The whole experience was like an episode of the twilight zone where you don t know what s true or not. On a last ditch effort to try and salvage the night  we decided to stop off at the bar hoping for a different experience. NOPE as we walk up we re are met with a look of disappointment as apparently they closed at 9. BUT the bartender was since enough to let us have a drink which was the second saving grace of this evening. Sooo if you want subpar food  disastrous service where wait staff isn t briefed on the menu  then go here I suppose.
La Piscina,1,Mikayla is amazing  my reservation was not found  but she still found me a table. Her hospitality and service was phenomenal.   Justin at the bar  was friendly and welcoming. My friend from Mexico City is visiting  and he made us such specialized and personalized drinks.   Anna was amazing  she kept checking up on us to make sure we re  all good.  The food was an orgasm in my mouth.   This team here deserves 100 stars.
La Piscina,2,What a pleasant experience we had here at La Piscina  Located on the 5th floor of the Austin Proper Hotel.  20 for valet or street parking available.   I loved the vibes and decor of this place  But I mean it is part of the Proper hotel so you can t expect anything less.  The food  drinks and service were superb. For two people we ordered shrimp ceviche  agua Chile  and the no.1 10 oz prime steak arrachera al carbon fajitas. Let me tell you... this isn t your average  sizzling fajita plate. They place the plate on top of this table top stove thing so it stays sizzling lol. The steak was tender and flavorful. Oh and there s also a pool of cheese served alongside your protein of choice. I would let the cheese sit for a bit on the sizzling plate to develop a slight crispy bottom. Like can it get any better    
La Piscina,3,Overall I d give it 3   but not quite 4 stars. I met my friend Julianna here for drinks  snacks and a catch up. It s one of her favorite places and I imagine that on a night when you can take advantage of the patio not in the heat of summer  it s a delightful location for a rooftop bar. We were inside and the AC just didn t seem to be able to keep up with the windows and the opening   closing of the doors to get to the patio area.   Parking  There is valet  but they were slammed when I drove up  so I ended up parking at the Austin Library Parking garage  which is just a short walk to the Proper Hotel. You will likely encounter homeless in this area.  Drinks  We got the Texas Sandia and it was nice and refreshing with watermelon agua fresca and the glass had spicy tajin salt on it.   Food  The chips and salsa that come on the table are good. The salsa is quite flavorful and very fresh tasting. We also ordered the piscina nachos with achiote chicken. They were good - I think it was 6 nachos per order. Be warned that as a fajita place  which we didn t eat   the restaurant is rather smoky inside as they are sizzling tableside and the ventilation is not that great. If that s something that you re sensitive to  you may want to prioritize patio seating.  The service was attentive and friendly. We had to get moved midway through our visit as they needed our table to make a larger table for a group of 15. I ve never experienced that at a restaurant before  but they were helpful in moving most of our stuff for us and apologetic  but I think they didn t have a ton of flexibility given how small the space is . On the note of the space being small  it does get loud in there if there are large groups - there were two large groups they night we were there  so it was pretty lively and noisy - with some guests opting to brave the heat on the patio for a slightly calmer vibe.   I d like to return when the weather is better for outdoor seating and to try some other food given the strong reviews I ve seen from others in Yelp.
La Piscina,4,It s inside the hotel on the 5th floor. If it was not my friend who told me to check out this place I would never know... the vibe was really nice  I love the interior and the patio of the restaurant. Cocktails are pricey and taste just average. The tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole were pretty good. I like their salsa and guacamole. The fish taco was meh. Oyster was really small... the sizzling shrimp was fine  but tbh  I was not impressed by the food or drink. Also it s hard to find parking during dinner hours.
La Piscina,5,Checked into the hotel and heard great things about the poolside restaurant. Staff was great  ambiance was nice - there was inside or outside seating available. Complimentary warm chips and two salsas came out with water as soon as we sat down. Two of us ordered Al pastor fajitas - came with all the fixings  rice  beans  lettuce  guacamole  sour cream  and served tableside for full experience. This was  38 and we had enough leftover for dinner. Would highly recommend - this would be enough for three to share no problem 
La Piscina,6,This is slowly been becoming one of my favorite spots to go to in Austin and the reason why  is there fajitas. Yes looking at the price tag can be a little shocking it is not a cheap meal whatsoever however just know that it s large enough to split between two people so the cost really isn t as bad  and I guarantee it will be the best fajitas you ve ever had in your life. I always get the steak the heat is the steak melts in your mouth and is marinated so well. Beans and rice are delicious  the queso is delicious  the tortillas the HOMEMADE are SOOO good.  Most recently came here for brunch and had their brunch fajitas. Game changer    It s now all I want for brunch. I highly recommend you make this on your go to list for Austin.   Pros  food      Cons  prices   beware  20 margs - yikes  
La Piscina,7,Location  On the 5th floor inside the Austin Proper Hotel. Take the elevator   Parking  Valet or nearby parking garages  Food  Poached gulf shrimp soaked in coconut tiger milk  Lobster Quesadillas and the Table Top Sizzling Fajitas -- 10 oz. Prime steak arrachera al carbon fajitas  enough food for 3 people  with Bacon wrapped gulf shrimp. We also added scallops  but they tasted a bit odd. The flour tortillas are thick and soft... perfect with the tender prime steak  The cheese though... must be the secret ingredient that makes everything tastes so good   Drinks  Try the La Fresa if you like ros . Elote Cobbler is interesting with bourbon and almond milk.  The cocktails are very pricy.  18 for a cocktail  but the  44 meals come in great portions. Worth the try.   Service  Seems understaffed  but we weren t in a hurry  so it was just fine.   AC  Wasn t keeping the interior space cool enough bc they kept the door to the patio open. Would ve preferred the strong AC system downstairs from the hotel s first level.
La Piscina,8,Justin the bartender was simply phenomenal. Very knowledgeable on the menu and bar. Lovely ambiance.
La Piscina,9,I was treated to a birthday dinner here tonight and I gotta say it was worth every penny and then some. Ok here s my complaint.... Too many damn beautiful people  ok      Lol   Sometimes I feel out of place in my town now that I m a year shy of 60 but who cares     My friend and I were treated like royalty and we thoroughly enjoyed the trendy atmosphere and divine food and drinks   We started with queso flameado and shared beef fajitas with 4 huge shrimp and we ended up bringing a bunch home. Not even kidding  I can t wait to go back 
La Piscina,10,I came here for drinks and appetizers. Very cool spot  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  It s very nicely decorated and the outside seating on the fifth floor by the pool was great. The vibe was chill and I made some friends at our neighboring table.   I had the Old Fashioned and then switched to a Tito s and soda to honor Austin. I should have had a Topo Chico too in hindsight.  -   The food was very good. The guac and chips were flavorful and the crudo was fresh and both went fast.
La Piscina,11,Loved the restaurant  food  staff  and decor. Can t ever go wrong coming to La Piscina. Hands down the best fajita in town. Parking to valet is  20. Best if you find street parking elsewhere 
La Piscina,12,We ate here on Sunday afternoon for brunch.  The chips and green sauce were AMAZING and we enjoyed our spicy pepino margaritas.  Our party of 4 ate the No 2 and No 10 fajitas and we had plenty of food left over   The tortillas were nice and fresh and the fajitas were yummy   We ordered our steak fajitas medium but I think next time we will order medium rare.
La Piscina,13,Hit and miss dinner at La Piscina. Let our experience help guide you.   Skip the guacamole and queso fundido appetizers. The queso was separated and just not good. The guac needed spices  salt  and the curtido vegetables were too vinegar flavored.  Needed more oil and water and less vinegar when cooking the vegetables. Also  the fajitas  you need to get fajitas  comes with a proper queso fundido  a good creamy version  AND guac on the side anyway so no need to order those appetizers. The chips and salsa  brought free to table  were very good.  The tuna crudo was a hit but a small 5 bites for  21. The beef  no 1 on the menu  were excellent  flavorful  juicy  tender. The chicken  no 4 on menu  was very good also. The rice and bean accompaniment to the fajitas was okay but could use more salt and rice cooked in a chicken broth instead of water. The flour tortillas for queso and fajitas were just okay. They were kind of stiff and lacking flavor  need some lard perhaps . After a few minutes they get very stiff. We also ordered the snapper tacos which were good but the tortillas didn t hold up and broke apart which is not good. These 2 fajita items were enough for 3 to 4 people easily.  The waitstaff uniforms are cabo beach vibes but in a high rise hotel are more papillon prison vibes.  Nick  our waiter  was awesome. Very helpful  friendly  fun.  We did have a cilantro issue though. We asked for all cilantro garnish to be eliminated from our food  after seeing other yelp photos  but only a bonus mistake guac had it removed. The pictures show everything else covered with it.  The total bill with no drinks before tip was  32 pp so very manageable. So skip the duplicate apps and add another fajita dish would be the right move. Fajitas are 5 star but unfortunatley too many other things just not good enough for an upscale place in Austin for this native Texan  
La Piscina,14,They gave us complementary salsas and chips that were amazing  We ordered a house limonada  Baja oysters  octopus aguachile negra  bacon wrapped filet  amp  jumbo golf shrimps fajitas  and tres leches. Everything arrived quickly and tasted amazing. The Baja oysters were so fresh. The octopus  bacon wrapped filet and shrimps were cooked perfectly. We raved about the Monterey Jack cheese that was served with the fajitas. The grapefruit that came with the tres leches paired perfectly. I already made a reservation to come back with my family 
La Piscina,15,My husband got a reservation last night for my birthday dinner. We were promptly greeted with waters and chips salsa which was great.  Our server took our drink order and asked if we d like to place the food order. We said we wanted to wait to space out our meal. He assured us that he would  course out the food properly  and it wouldn t all come at once.   Sure enough  all the food showed up at once  exactly what we didn t want. We had no room on the table for all our food. The server brought over a side chair  placed it next to our table and proceeded to place dishes of our meal on a side chair. This is unacceptable. Completely ruined the vibe and experience of eating food off a chair.   After our food made it out and we ordered another drink  our server vanished to never return. We ended up foregoing any birthday dessert at all because he never came back. We had to track down another server to bring us Togo boxes and our check.   The food was amazing but sadly won t return due to the awful service. Not exactly how I wanted to spend a birthday dinner  especially when it was a  200 meal.
La Piscina,16,I am a huge fan of Peacock and now I can add La Piscina to my list of things I love about The Proper Austin. The rooftop location next to the pool just make for some great vibes  atmosphere and definitely some great photos. We dined here for lunch and really enjoyed the shrimp aquachile  tuna crudo and lobster quesadilla minus the tropical salsa. Will definitely be back for one of their ten options of fajitas.
La Piscina,17,Fajitas are the move here. I prefer the arrachera over the filet. Skip the guac and queso fundido - order nachos as an appetizer before. They doctor up a fried half tortilla with all the toppings so it prevents all the toppings on top and dry chips on the bottom.   The sandia margarita with mezcal is also amazing. It s a whopping   20 for a drink but worth every penny.
La Piscina,18,I was blown away  I had such a great experience at La Piscina for a work meeting. The ambiance was great and had a high end feel to it. This restaurant has a rooftop view near the pool. The entire restaurant was clean and all of the staff was dressed very professionally.  We opened up with some appetizers. We ordered the Bluefin Tuna and Nachos. For the entree we ordered the beef and chicken and the ribeye. It was all so good the mix of corn and flour tortillas were so delicious. The meat was cooked to perfection and pre-sliced for our tacos.  I can t say enough about how great everything was and topped off with amazing service. The views were also a nice touch while enjoying dinner. I recommend this place for anyone with an important business meeting or a special night.
La Piscina,19,Very fun vibe with lots of beautiful people and great drinks and food. We sat outside with the pool nearby. Very relaxing.
La Piscina,20,Great atmosphere and vibes  The food is amazing as well as the drinks  Nice lil place to feel like you re away from the hustle and bustle. Staff are super chill too. I will definitely be back.
La Piscina,21,Visiting Austin from out of town and a coworker recommended La Piscina to celebrate our friends birthday - I did not make a great first impression  due to human error I had messed up our reservation but the staff was so kind and accommodating  it was as if nothing went wrong at all. The space was stunning and the views were beautiful. Our server Nick was excellent and made our friend s birthday so special and fun. We got the local veggie fajitas and the bacon wrapped filet mignon and both were phenomenal. Definitely will return next time I m in Austin 
La Piscina,22,Best sizzling Fajitas in Austin  We tried the chicken and lamb fajitas.. they were really good. Great food and nice ambiance.
La Piscina,23,I really wanted to love this place bc my friend had spoke so highly of it  and the food was good which was why it s getting three stars. But there were so many other things that went wrong  I m left here wondering if it is worth going back or recommending.  To start  the oyster were great. Really fresh and you could tell they were good quality.  Next we had the seafood cocktail. Shrimp  octopus and grouper in a spicy seafood sauce. I m sure that the fish in this dish was fresh and of a good quality also  but it was difficult to tell from the overpower taste of the tomato sauce. It took away from what could have potentially been a great dish.  For our main we ordered the bacon wrapped filet and gulf shrimp fajitas. And so we waited... And waited... And after 45 min our server told us  the food is taking a while bc the filet takes a long time to cook... Or at least that s what the chef said . You could tell even she wasn t sure of what she was saying.  When the food arrives  it s delicious. No doubt about it. But I paid for shrimp and steak and two pieces of shrimp just isn t going to cut it.   To top it all off  a gentleman comes over to check on us and asks if we are done. There was still a good amount of food left so I said   No we are still going thank you . He paused for a second and just like that took our plate away... it all happened to quickly for me to even say anything before he was out of sight.  So as you can imagine  from my experience I write this review with very mixed reviews. Good food  disappointing experience.
La Piscina,24,Tasty and strong margaritas but overall the food is overpriced here. Nice atmosphere inside a boutique hotel.
La Piscina,25,What a beautiful restaurant to celebrate a memorable Valentine s Day this year. Located in the Line hotel we were able to grab brunch before the snowstorm hit Austin. The interior and cuisine take a very modern approach to Mexican food but it s executed tremendously well. We started with the Baja oysters as an appetizer with a delicious margarita. For entree I went with the the fajita breakfast and my partner got the tres leches French toast. Forewarning the fajita breakfast is a large serving so make sure to order this if your really hungry or want to share  The tres leches was sweet and indulgent but we ended up sharing everything so it helped balance things out. Overall great experience and service. Would love to come back here when it s warmer to enjoy the outside seating.
La Piscina,26,Terrible service. Pitiful. Food was good  but the experience was so tainted by the poor service that it kind of gets lost. To start  we called to see if a party of three could get in any time soon that evening  called about 6 15 pm . We were told yes  but there might be a wait  fine . There was no wait   but they could only seat us at very uncomfortable bar seating  long tables and stools . We had asked if they had any seating outside. No. Also could not have a table inside. This all despite the fact that there were many open tables  both outside and inside  all throughout the evening. They certainly were not saving some waiter from too many tables  since our waiter had tables outside  inside  and us at the bar. So...why not let guests sit where they want  This paled in comparison to the lousy  inattentive service from the waiter. We must have waited 30 minutes before he took our entree order. Then he never came around to ask for more drinks  had to flag him down . Not sure If it is the waiter or management  as he clearly had too many tables all over the restaurant. It s not like it s a diner - this is billed as a  luxury  hotel. Ruined the meal.   We had guacamole  fancy  but meh   queso fundido  good  but came with three tortillas - like there is a shortage   and chicken and steak fajitas. Chicken was good. Steak was fantastic.   Bottom line  with so many choices in Austin  I d skip the bad service.
La Piscina,27,Fajitas are the BEST    staff is amazing. Some of our favs Justin  Alex   amp  Gabby  We are always greeted amazingly. Margheritas are perfect. Service on point 
La Piscina,28,I m a regular here at this joint and it s really delicious. I love to sit at the bar- the bartenders always give great recommendations  they are so helpful  The margs made by justin are on point - my fav is the watermelon  Any of the fajitas are a great choice- I love the Al Pastor one 
La Piscina,29,We came here for my birthday dinner with a reservation for 2 and 6 15pm and it did not disappoint   I do recommend making a reservation as it did get very crowded on a Thursday night but the service was great and so was the food     To drink  We ordered the house margaritas  Jamaica margaritas  and blood orange Paloma s    we were given complimentary chips  amp  salsa   ordered 2 sets of the Baja oysters  amp  the gulf snapper aji Amarillo aguachile as an appetizer    split the pork Al pastor fajitas which came with rice and beans and tortillas  plenty to split for 2 people for sure 
La Piscina,30,I grew up 15 minutes from Mexico  down in The Valley. I know authentic Mexican. Not this Tex Mex craze people get their fabricated fix on.  La Piscina  outside of the Sunday brunch at Fonda San Miguel  is the most legit Mexican restaurant in town. Their ribeye fajita is extremely high quality. Their lobster fajitas is worth the splurge. Oysters are tiny but pack a phenomenal fresh flavor. Tortillas are quality. Even the chips and salsa is on point. For dessert and a show try the flaming crepes.  Lobster quesadillas are also delish.  I ve been coming here now so many times. They ve gone through a few ups and downs with various chefs. Most great  one or two poor but they re back again with a great one.   Do not miss this hidden gem 
La Piscina,31,Really cool place. Would give 4.5 if I could. First  the atmosphere is cool. Its up by the pool at the Austin Proper. The food we had was tremendous.  We started with the queso fundido. It was very good. Then we got lobster fajitas with lamb chops and bacon wrapped shrimp added. It was all outstanding. And then we finished with the tres leches - that may have been the best part of the meal.  Highly recommend and would definitely go back again.
La Piscina,32,I made a reservation for  5  a few weeks before and requested to be seated outdoors. They were accommodating and we were seated outside on a bench style type seating. The views were spectacular of the city. Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu list. Most plates were family style and we got nachos  shrimp fajitas and ribeye steak fajitas. We also tried the ceviche which was yummy. With a limited menu  the flavors were delicious and the wine paired well with the dishes. We finished the night with churros which were light and fluffy on the inside. It was piping hot with a sugary coat and came with a side of chocolate to dip in.
La Piscina,33,Our server was amazing  Victor. Loved the lobster fajitas setup. But giving this 3 stars due to their super rude food runner Evelyn. If that was even her real name. I politely asked her for a serving spoon for our appetizer she dropped off and she kept walking and rolled her eyes. I then watched her to do the same thing to another table right next to us. She could be bothered by anyones requests. I could see our waiter was trying to make up for incapabilities. She dropped off another dish to us that we ordered and was very smug and short. We were confused as we had no prior interaction with her. I finally had to ask for her name. Terrible hire for a person with even a worst attitude.
La Piscina,34,I agree with some of the other reviews below when it comes to general service attitude here at La Piscina. The vibe was a little standoffish and inattentive. However  nothing I m not already used to  being from LA.   Long story short  the food  ambiance  and presentation were all spot-on... definitely enough to justify coming back. My friend and I each got our own fajitas  chicken  amp  steak for me  gulf shrimp for her  as well as the watermelon cocktails.   The presentation was excellent - they bring you the fajitas on a sizzling plate suspended over this flaming cauldron     thing. Definitely a crowd pleaser and would highly recommend.
La Piscina,35,This place absolutely slaps. Get the breakfast fajitas. If you end up moving to Austin  don t blame me.
La Piscina,36,killer margs  amp  fajitas.  will definitely come back. at the Proper hotel so valet is pricey.  nice upscale patio dinner at sunset  will definitely come back. great service  great food.
La Piscina,37,Food here was amazing. I stayed at the hotel with my partner and everything was delicious. We got fajitas with shrimp and filet mignon wrapped in bacon as well as the lobster qusidillas. Everything is as absolutely amazing 
La Piscina,38,The brunch here was amazing. Loved the ambiance. The steak fajitas and the breakfast fajitas were fun to eat. The corn tortillas were the best I ve ever had. The dulce de leche French toast was absolutely delicious and so moist. The guacamole was ok. The chips and salsa are awesome too.
La Piscina,39,We had a bad experience with the food runner Alex. He came to bring us our fixings for our fajitas and we asked him to refill our drinks and totally ignored us. Then he went to get our plate of fajitas and we could see them sitting on the window but this guy was just standing in front of it messing with his phone which looks completely unprofessional  he waited a little longer and after like 3 minutes or so he finally decided to bring our food to the table all the time while being on his phone just killing time. I have no complaints a about the food but the service is terrible. As he brought our fajitas we tried again to ask him to refill our drinks and once again he completely ignored us. We know for fact that he heard us because we called him multiple times. I wouldn t bother in coming here because for the amount of money you pay you should be treated better.
La Piscina,40,Such a beautiful place with yummy food  I had the tres leches french toast and it was delicious and my friend had the fajita plate. Also have awesome drinks 
La Piscina,41,I am disappointed to have to give this restaurant 3 stars because it has so much potential. This hotel is beautiful as well as both restaurants. We went for my birthday and it was not even acknowledged even though my husband put it on the reservation. We got the chicken fajitas and the chicken was as bland as could be. No flavor at all. My drink was watered down and  20 for something that tasted closer to water than a cocktail. I will say the chips were the best thing there. Perfect. We spent over  100 and left hungry. I would suggest going for the experience but plan on going to Torchys next door for some real flavor when you are done.
La Piscina,42,La Piscina makes you feel you were transported outside of Austin with it s beautiful decor and ambience. It is on the 5th floor of the Austin Proper  right by the pool. Like the entire hotel  the attention to detail is impeccable. We went for appetizers and cocktails and everything we had was delicious. We got the guacamole  tuna crudo  churros  and cocktails. The guacamole and chips were fresh and a little spicy. You could tell the chips were just made and were the perfect amount of salty. I don t eat seafood  but my friend ordered the tuna crudo and absolutely loved it. The house margaritas were fresh and not too strong. We finished our meal with the churros  and they were definitely our favorite part. Definitely the best churros I ve had. While we only came for appetizers  I am looking forward to going back soon for full dinner service. The fajitas and other entrees looked incredible. Definitely one of the more fun dining experiences I ve had in Austin in a long time. Major kudos to the Austin Proper for creating beautiful dining experiences across the board.   Didn t get the best photos  but snapped a quick photo of the guacamole and churros.
La Piscina,43,Third visit here and far from the last. Fajitas are great to split among two people but the quesadilla is an absolute MUST. Atmosphere is amazing especially during sunset. Can t say enough good things about this place. Currently in my top 3 in all of Austin.
La Piscina,44,We came here for my girlfriends birthday brunch and we had the best time. We sat on the side patio and it s the cutest patio with a great atmosphere. We were there for a solid 2-3 hours and had great service. I wish I would have taken more pictures of the food. The only picture i got was the gulf snapper ceviche and it was so tiny. That was disappointing but it was good. It is expensive so be ready to drop some cash but that s to be expected in a hotel  Also  the valet service was a breeze and  10 which was so awesome because the parking is atrocious. Our waitress was super fun and gracious  She took pictures for us and gave us great service  Also  I did want to note when you order guacamole it doesn t come with chips  You have to order that separately  That surprised us all but the guac was so bomb  Between the 6 of us 3 of us got the Caesar salad which was so good  I love a good Caesar salad  And 3 others got chilaquiles. That s not my style but everyone seemed to enjoy it. Overall I think this is a great special occasion date spot or a girls brunch 
La Piscina,45,If looking into making reservations for a restaurant this is your place  The ambiance was very nice and food was delicious   
La Piscina,46,I see mixed reviews here about service  but our experience was great. The girl at the front was friendly and accommodated us adding an extra person to our reservation. Our server  Malia  was awesome. Very friendly  attentive  and knowledgeable about the menu. She ev
La Piscina,47,If I could give this place a 0  I would. The service was absolutely horrible. The staff was extremely rude and we had a big party and spent  2000. The food was amazing but the service was HORRENDOUS.
La Piscina,48,I really struggled between giving La Piscina 3 and 4 stars. If we had not gone for our anniversary dinner then I may have been a little forgiving. This brings me to my first point of disappointment. The restaurant was so loud it was difficult to have a conversation with my husband. We were inside and it was a cold night so the glass doors were closed and given that much of the restaurant is concrete walls  sound bounces everywhere. Not a super pleasant experience to start. Next  it was clear they were understaffed and I am not faulting the restaurant for that. I know the service industry is doing the best they can and I do appreciate that. Our server appeared to be helping about 10 tables  both inside and outside  which is too many for 1 person. Not once did they approach our table without being called over and no one bothered to even check if our food was ok. Our food did quickly come from the kitchen by runners and the expo person in the kitchen kept it moving. I found the bill to be expensive. We came out around  200 for 2 people after tipping and I m not sure it felt  worth it.  The drinks being the most over-priced part of the menu considering the 3 we ordered weren t that good. It s never great to not serve a high-quality margarita in Austin  especially when they are  20. We got the queso fundido  watery which is odd   the caesar salad  and the pineapple and ribeye fajitas plus churros for dessert  undercooked . Nothing blew us away and I do not believe I would go back any time soon.
La Piscina,49,I loved this place so much  After trying other Mexican restaurants that had no tables available we got lucky and got a table here. The service was a 12 10. Nicest waitstaff and so attentive. The food was also amazing. Would definitely come back if I ever make a trip to Austin again. Will be recommending this place to all my friends   
La Piscina,50,11 10.  Excellent drinks  flavorful dishes  super kind and accommodating wait staff.  I will absolutely go back.
La Piscina,51,We come here at least twice a month. Justin and Jason at the bar are wonderful and always make sure we have a great time. Margaritas and red snapper tacos are the way to go.
La Piscina,52,The restaurant was cute and the food was good. The table side Caesar salad was sooo good and big enough for the whole table.   The service is why this gets 3 stars-- I went in a group of 4 to celebrate my friends birthday and brought our own cake. At the end of the dinner  we asked if we could have a knife plates for the cake  that we brought    and they said it would be  12 per person for a  cake cutting fee . So  48 to eat a cake that we brought. What if we were in a group of 10    120    Their own dessert on their menu is cheaper than this  fee . We were all rubbed the wrong way and obvi just went downstairs and ate the cake in the bar for free. On top of that  they didn t even acknowledge my friends bday which is totally fine but typically you expect a little something. Just FYI if you re celebrating a bday-- maybe don t choose La Piscina.
La Piscina,53,Place is epic. High quality food with a great vibe  and  it keeps  authentic Mexican flavors. We have been a bunch now and it s very consistent and delicious. Fajitas is the way to go  filet and ribeye and get the shrimp and jalape o add ons. Nachos are a must as well  Great cocktails and staff as well. Highly recommend  
La Piscina,54,While the food is generally pretty consistent and good  it s the absolute WORST service. I don t understand  if you don t want to work  please stay home. We are excited restaurants are in full tilt  but it s not fun to go to a nice place  spend a ton of money and time  to have staff that is un-attentive  slow and with generally poor attitudes  Not worth the money or the time. Go elsewhere  or get it to-go 
La Piscina,55,Worst service in Austin. Hostess was rude  waitress took 15 minutes to bring a single straw  they were not busy . For the price  there are way better options in Austin. Take your money elsewhere.
Taquerias Arandinas,1,Stopped by for a quick drink and I was here for the first time so we decided to sit at the bar.  I ordered Chamoy rita or something. It was soooo good.  Their chips and salsa was so good too. The salsa has great smokey flavor and the spice level is just right.   The service is great   
Taquerias Arandinas,2,Fantastic family owned Mexican restaurant. Top notch friendly service. Excellent food at a very reasonable price. Food comes out quick and is always fresh. Great place to catch the games and relax at the bar.
Taquerias Arandinas,3,This is my first one star ever and it s not even about the food  it s about the management. This was my second time eating at this restaurant  and we had just paid and stop by a bar in the same shopping center. We come back and my car was towed. Even though there are no distinguishing marks or signs to separate the bar parking lot from the restaurant parking lot someone called the tow company anyways. We go in and talk to host and even though he wasn t the one that called he confirmed it was a person hired by the owner just to call the tow truck. I tried explaining the confusion but the host couldn t do anything  the dispatch couldn t do anything and the tow company obviously wouldn t do anything unless I paid. It s a shame cause I though I would make this place a regular stopping area before this cost me  300 so I guess I won t be back
Taquerias Arandinas,4,Great food  great service and it looks like they have a nice bar scene. Very clean inside and attentive bartender and waitress. Will definitely be back.
Taquerias Arandinas,5,This place was kind of like a hole-in-the-wall. It was also one of the only places opened during the winter storm.   The food was decent and served in a large portion. However  the tacos were slightly dry and burnt. The water was tap water with a very interesting and distinct smell of mildew. As an alternative  I would suggest trying Rosita s Al Pastor food truck nearby instead.
Taquerias Arandinas,6,I was visiting my son in Austin and he was craving Mexican so we decided to try this place since it was close to where he lives. We had a party of 13 and we just showed up they were so nice and pulled tables together and sat us right away. And they were kinda busy. We had one waitress and she did her thing  She allowed us to split up our tickets and they got everything out out fast and right   They good was good and there green sauce and Chile con queso was amazing everyone loved their food I would say if your near the area definitely try this place out 
Taquerias Arandinas,7,Service was slow from the start. When a friend asked for a custom order  the waitress literally said  idk if the cook wants to make that . Not sure if that s protocol for the cook to have discretion over what they want to make but definitely not acceptable
Taquerias Arandinas,8,I came on my lunch break to get a margarita on happy hour and some food. I sat at the bar. A couple sat at the bar minutes after I did. The bartender completely ignored me and served them with drinks  chips  and salsa  without even looking at me. Another five minutes went by and still no one has offered me a water or chips and salsa. Another few minutes and the bartended finally asks what I want.. well nothing anymore  Haha 
Taquerias Arandinas,9,This review is for the service and staff only  as I never received any food. I placed an order on DoorDash  and the order was cancelled because the restaurant told the Dasher that someone else had picked up my order. Okay  it happens. I get it. DoorDash was awesome and quickly gave me a refund.   So I decide to try again  but this time I place a pick up order. I drive to the restaurant  and they tell me the same thing they told the Dasher--that someone else picked up my order.   It should be easy enough to clear up the confusion. I did  after all  place the exact same order as the delivery order. But none of the staff speak or understand a word of English  making communication impossible if you don t speak any English. From what I could gather  they were trying to claim that I didn t pay for my pickup order  but I showed them my email receipt for when DoorDash charged me for the pickup order. Nope. Not enough.   They call DoorDash  and asked DoorDash to explain to me that my order was picked up my someone else. I explained to the DoorDash person that they are confusing the delivery order with the pickup order. They took back the phone and spoke in Spanish. Based on my Google Translate app  it appeared they were disputing with DoorDash about payment. I think they then put DoorDash on hold to answer other calls. I waited around 10-15 minutes and spoke to DoorDash via the chat feature on my app. I asked the staff if they were planning to give me food or if I should just leave. They didn t answer me. So I left.  NEVER coming back. The place looked like an unsanitary dump anyway.
Taquerias Arandinas,10,Very good restaurant. The mole is on point. Service is great. The chips and salsa go well together. Been multiple times and never disappointed
Taquerias Arandinas,11,Walking in you can immediately feel a time warp into Mexico. The smell of carne gasada and corn tortillas. I ordered the carne gasada plate. I hadn t had beef in some time and this was extremely juicy and full of flavors. The waitress was attentive and the music playing in this clean establishment was spot on with the Hispanic I atmosphere.
Taquerias Arandinas,12,It s kind of hit and miss with this place. Sometimes it s super good  sometimes below par. The service is good. The food is a tad under-flavored. The margaritas were decent. It s a spot I would go with a close friend and just have some drinks with chips and queso. This wouldn t be the spot I would bring a tourist.
Taquerias Arandinas,13,Finding authentic Mexican food can be quite easy if you know where to look  You can t really rely on apps like Yelp as they are oversaturated by popular spots which tend to lean to Americanized or TexMex joints  which are good too  but they mostly aren t authentic   A good place to start is to drive to Riverside Dr and you ll see many. Taquerias Arandinas is one of my favs. My favorite plate to get is the Alambres Especiales which comes with beef fajita  sausage  bacon  onion  bell pepper  and cheese - as well as beans and rice of course  Absolutely delicious  They have a big menu with tons of options so you can t go wrong with anything here. My Mexican mother loves this place  so I know it s legit.
Taquerias Arandinas,14,The best Mexican food I ve eaten in Austin  Everything is absolutely very delicious. Everything I ordered was amazing. The staff was very friendly as well  very clean place too. I will definitely be back for more. Let s just say it hits 
Taquerias Arandinas,15,I don t usually do reviews but this was a must  we had a party of 4. To start off the waiter was really rude  when we ordered she had a annoyed face. When we did get our order she only gave us 5 napkins so we asked for more and she added 3 napkins  she didn t return after so we had to call her across the restaurant for refills which also took a while. When we were almost done we found hair on 2 of the plates but we decided to just leave. While paying I informed them about the hair to the cashier  just as a comment for them to be cautious  she said  ok  sorry with an attitude. Will not be back
Taquerias Arandinas,16,no blacks allowed   i stood at the front door for 10 minutes not a single person greeted me. a caucasian man comes in right beside me    and is instantly greeted and sat. when i asked what s going on she replied she doesn t speak english and referred me to some guy who was clueless of the situation. i promise i wish i could do something about these places that hate people simply because of appearance. it is not right and ruined my day. i would starve to death before eating here
Taquerias Arandinas,17,Betty   Look for Betty  she is one of the best server. I always ask for a crispy Fried Tilapia 
Taquerias Arandinas,18,I was informed of this place when a guy asked me to meet him here for a date. In all honesty I was very taken back and sketched out upon arrival  but the experience made up for it. I think this place is a whole in the wall that is very underrated.  I think they did a fantastic job at implementing social distancing rules and regulations during this stressful time. They had several tables marked off and people spread out throughout the restaurant which helped promote safety and distancing. Even though they had tables marked off for social distancing they still allowed their guest to pick their table  which really assisted the guest in feeling like their dining experience is all about them.  The service was okay. I definitely feel like their is room for improvement. I had the Cheese Enchiladas and they were delicious  I have found that the farther you get from San Antonio the less delicious the Mexican food is  however this restaurant proved that statement wrong   Their margaritas are huge yet so good  The chips and salsa add a great touch  Don t be intimidated to give this place a try even if it doesn t look like a five star a restaurant on the outside.
Taquerias Arandinas,19,I came here after a show at 2 AM and didn t know what to expect. The place has amaaaazing tacos for about  2 each. You can ask for free chips and salsa and there s also a sauce bar. There s four cats walking around as well  it s great.  I got the carnitas and the los famosos tacos. So so so good  Also tried my friend s queso and it was cheesy and full of flavor and hot.  The chips are a great texture and just tasted perfect.  I want to come back and try all of the food again  I m impressed by the good food quality at 2am 
Taquerias Arandinas,20,When I first walked in it was like I was transported to Mexico. The music  decor  and the smell all stimulated my senses. Hostess was amazing  we were brought a complimentary basket of tortilla chips along with salsa and a creamy avacado sauve  both of which were perfect complements to the chips. I ordered the combo plate which came with a choice of 2 meats  rice  salad  beans  and tortillas. I got the Al Pastor which was a little rough but the spice and flavor was amazing. I also got the barbacoa which was absolutely mind blowing  it was so juicy and flavorful and melted in my mouth. The portion was huge and I was well satisfied. I finished the meal was a tres leches  it was nothing special the cake was not as moist as other tres leches I have eaten.
Taquerias Arandinas,21,Terrible service  awful  nachos  and the worst margaritas you can ask for. I understand this new normal makes running a restaurant a little harder than before  but the service is inexcusable. 30 minutes to order a margarita  Fug that
Taquerias Arandinas,22,Before the quarantine  we d just moved to the neighborhood. Good food at GREAT prices   The service was friendly  amp  fast. We speak VERY little Spanish     but they translated  amp  helped us order a tasty meal. We got Crispy Tacos for everyone  4 people . Authentic Mexican food.   
Taquerias Arandinas,23,Came here due to seeing so many cars always parked outside. The outside is a little off putting and the inside is nothing special  but WOW. The salsa was spicy but just so much flavor that my girlfriend and I could not stop eating. We ordered the Enchiladas Texanas and the Taquito Plate. The enchiladas where amazing  the queso was ok since it seemed store bought but the rice and beans where definitely not. The chicken tasted great as it was charred and not dry. The tacos where out of this world and so far the best I have had in Austin  a 8 out of 10 in my taco rating. Definitely coming back due to the price  and the authentic tasting food. Our server Oscar was extremely attentive and staff overall seemed friendly. Happy hour also has to be the best in riverside with  3 domestic and imported beer. Hope more people try this place out.
Taquerias Arandinas,24,This is my go to Mexican restaurant when I m at riverside and not at a taco truck. For the price that you re paying  the food portions are really decent. I love their chips and salsa  which comes with two types of salsa  one of which is really spicy . I love getting the combinations plates as I get to have a little of everything. Their tamales are a little too dry for my liking  but the nachos and taquitos are so good  I appreciate that Parking is never an issue  especially because not everyone likes walking in riverside at night. Having said that  you might want to have a friend who speaks Spanish to go with you if you don t speak Spanish  as the waitress kept trying to converse in Spanish with me 
Taquerias Arandinas,25,Tried Torta Cubana for the first time. It was good and filling. The prices are quite reasonable  the ambience is nice and the servers are friendly.
Taquerias Arandinas,26,Came by one Sunday morning for breakfast  you know one of those mornings for menudo.  It was ok. not the best  not the worst. decent.  My husband ordered chilaquiles. again  not the best not the worst.
Taquerias Arandinas,27,Let me start off by stating how clean this establishment it is  The staff was so wonderful and the food is so die for  Thank you for the excellent service  Keep up the great work
Taquerias Arandinas,28,Recently moved to the neighborhood and love Mexican food so it was just a matter of time before I was going to make it in. On my way back from Downtown late and made the move. Tons of room  greeted when I walked in  seat yourself. Chips and salsa made it out super quickly and my server spoke no english really so I had to dust off my Spanish. I ve been trying to do that more  especially living in ATX.   Ordered without incident. Food came out very quickly and looked appetizing. Very good price to value  tacos were very big and enchiladas made a great lunch the next day. Guisada could have been a little more tender  but the ground beef had great seasoning. The enchiladas could have been better with more flavor on the chicken. Chicken was a little dryer than I d like.   Service was friendly and even when a ton of people rushed in after a concert across the street  my server never got swamped and disappeared. Will definitely be back to make my way around the menu. Solid place for the price point.
Taquerias Arandinas,29,Arandinas is clearly the best local casual taqueria chain-like joint. I am chiefly comparing it against Arandas  Jalisciences and La Tapatia. The food is fresher and has a higher quality. This is all merely anecdotal  like essentially everything I post on here. I actually shied away from Arandinas for so long. I thought I was an Arandas guy. Arandinas is a step up  for sure. Plus this location is open until 3 AM   Amazing  
Taquerias Arandinas,30,The food is good the service is BAD BAD BAD.  I like going there with my husband but always forget that their service is bad.  I wish they would ask for our drinks first and give people time to decide what they want to eat  instead of taking food orders for 2 people and coming back for the other 2 that weren t ready to order.  then we are not all eating together    my husband had to wait for his been 10 minutes and we were told it s the process     It s a CANTINA   
Taquerias Arandinas,31,I ll start this review off by saying that I usually enjoy the food here and have ordered from here multiple times. so that s why the 2 stars  I ordered food Togo from here today and they overcharged me. I don t know if they changed their menu prices  but they should update their website if they changed their prices and let the customers know. NONE of my dishes were the same prices as listed on the menu online and on yelp. After tip  I paid almost  40 for 3 dishes at a Tex mex restaurant and 2 agua frescas which is really too expensive for cheap Tex mex... No one wants to feel like they were cheated out of their money. PLEASE update your menu if prices have increased and other customers beware of being overcharged    Menu said Huaraches cost 5.99 WITH meat  I didn t want meat  only avocado and I got charged  6.99 for no meat... also they charged me  9.99 for cheese enchiladas  it says 7.99 for chicken enchiladas on menu     9.99 is the same price as the SHRIMP enchiladas and I just got cheese. Vegetarian quesadilla was also  2 more expensive than the listed price. Pretty disappointed and unhappy after this   
Taquerias Arandinas,32,El Taquito tacos taster fresher.  I had the Al Pastor tacos and the meat tasted like it d been microwaved. Too overcooked. The tortilla was too doughy. They were great but now  I don t know too much about that.
Taquerias Arandinas,33,Where do I begin   Smh..if you want high blood pressure  high cholesterol mixed in with a mini heart attack this is the best restaurant in town  I had the steak quesadillas and some queso. The quesadillas were really good EXCEPT it was full of grease. The queso was okay but again it was full of grease. My partner had been to this restaurant a few times and says his food has never been that greasy. He said maybe  it was due to it being a to go order.  Which to me doesn t justify this behavior lol. O and the customer service wasn t bad or good. Nevertheless  I will give them the benefit of the doubt. I d really like to try them again but HOLD the grease. My partner says  we re not going back after this review  lol
Taquerias Arandinas,34,Good portions  good prices. This is definitely great authentic Mexican food. There was some miscommunication because of a language barrier but they were really nice about it 
Taquerias Arandinas,35,Wow  I would ve never guessed this place was this freaking good lol.   Very authentic Mexican food and drinks.   I don t drink but snapped a photo of what they have on the table.   Their Gordita which I haven t had in over 8 years due to my diet  wow it wasn t greasy  it was super delicious and for  4.99 you get filled up really good.     This is the only place I ve been to in this part of Austin that the restaurant and even the customers look and make you feel like tour in a border town in Mexico and with American terrorist.      I totally recommend this one
Taquerias Arandinas,36,A walk in group lunch around 2pm on a Friday  no trouble getting seated.   Chips and 3 types of salsa arrive quickly  chipotle and tomatillo based were the best.  All of the group ordered some type of chicken dish  salad  enchiladas  Monterrey style and Chipotle style.  The Monterrey and Chipotle dishes were the best  all of the choices were very large plates.  The charro beans were excellent  very flavorful and meaty. The accompanying corn tortillas were very fresh and gad perfect texture.  Kitchen at that time of day was very sequential   meaning as each person s dish was fininshed  that single dish was brought to the table.  I m definitely OK with getting hot food to the table as quickly as possible  but it was just a bit odd for a restaurant that was less than half full.  Strong 3.5 stars rating  but since no half stars  they get a four  though I would not call this a 4 star place.  Friendly service  large portions  fair prices  a good value stop in place.
Taquerias Arandinas,37,Nice  authentic Mexican food restaurant and bar. Quite humble storefront and somewhat challenging location in Class D strip center on E. Riverside  but don t judge a book by its cover.   Neat as a pin inside. Staff super friendly staff and responsive. Great mariachi music playing and obvious loyal customer base. I ll go back.
Taquerias Arandinas,38,If you want to have true Mexican food  Arandinas is the place. You know the place is good when you see Mexicans in most tables.   I am a regular at the East Riverside location. Overall  the food is excellent  but their chilaquiles en salsa verde and enchiladas are superb  almost like being in Mexico City.   Their prices are fair and the service is amazing. I hope their keep it that way. Arandinas has the right combination of quality  quantity  and price.
Taquerias Arandinas,39,super rich food.  don t hesitate to eat here.  horrible service.  the cashier very rude and unpleasant.  I ordered take out and got the wrong order.
Taquerias Arandinas,40,My roommate and I were in the mood for a Mexican dinner so we decided to try this place out for the first time. We ordered the parrillada mixta and let me tell you the seasoning and tenderness of the meat was very good. Very pleased with the amount of food you receive for the price you pay. Very cheap. The only thing that made this a four star instead of five is that the tortillas are not handmade. Also the  agua de melon  was not fresh either it was definitely store bought. So make sure you ask if the type of agua fresca you are ordering is made fresh from scratch.
Taquerias Arandinas,41,OMG  Can somebody say  authentic     Tacos were so yummy. Still don t know what type of fish they had though. We asked and they said  fillet.  That s not a type of fish. Get your animal kingdom knowledge down bruhs.   Margs were garbo. Also got a brain freeze. Damn. But I can t turn down a marg. Just can t.   Hot authentic chicos. Ish authentic chickas.
Taquerias Arandinas,42,Came here to eat dinner. They towed my car. Do NOT come here. My  30 tab turned in  300. No help no one gave a shit. DO NOT EAT HERE  Worst place ever.
Taquerias Arandinas,43,If you re looking for quick  authentic  no frills tacos  you will be completely satisfied. Extremely delicious and spicy salsas  fast service  and consistently solid food. The price is ridiculously inexpensive for such a tasty product.  I am so happy I live so close to this location. Much better than the south 1st street Arandas one  though I love it there as well .
Taquerias Arandinas,44,Some of the best Mexican food I ve had  Service was amazing  food was hot and fresh  and all for a great price.   The chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious  as was my meal. I could tell the charro beans were freshly made  they came out hot and the flavor was 10 10.   Can t recommend this place enough 
Taquerias Arandinas,45,I am so tired of this place - we went here regularly but in the past few months EVERY TIME we order they screw it up. I just don t get it. These are simple taco orders and they will simply leave out whole parts of your order and double up on others. It s either laziness or stupidity but either way so t go here and expect to get what you ask and pay for   
Taquerias Arandinas,46,This is my favorite little restaurant that I go to for lunch. And I ve never experienced the service I got here. The male worker who was ringing me up was not listening to me.  So I had Called in to make three separate orders.  First one was two tostadas de Res  Second order was one tostada de pollo The third one tostada de res and one taco of chicharon  not sure if spelled correctly  with melon water and horchata.  So I go to the restaurant and tell them I m here to pick up and that I wanted to add a drink to the first order. And the worker kept interrupting me mid sentence saying  I know I know  but he wasn t listening to me I kept telling him but he would stop me mid sentence. So I left with the food ended up over paying     I only got one tostada de res and payed for a drink I didn t get cause he wouldn t let me talk    I am not coming back to this location
Taquerias Arandinas,47,Great food and a lot of variety. Portion sizes are very generous and the service is great. We went right at lunch and got a seat for 5 it was a great time with good food. The salsa is amazing as well. For sure recommend it
Taquerias Arandinas,48,I can no longer  in good conscience  recommend this place.   I used to work at a building not far from here  and I would insist on coming here when my co-workers wanted to go to Taco More. They all thought I was nuts.  Bear with the chipped plates and ghetto ambiance. The food here is great    I went a few months ago  ordered the same thing I always get  and noticed it just wasn t the same.  Maybe they had an off night   I said to myself  forgivingly.   Went again last night. Not only was the food terrible  I woke up sick to my stomach this morning. Apparently this is their new low standard. I think their kitchen staff changed. I would like to find out who hired the old staff  so I can go there.   Skip this place and go to Baby A s.
Taquerias Arandinas,49,Cheap. Fast. Delicious. Authentic.   Best Mexican breakfast I ve had since I lived in San Antonio. Get the chilaquiles verdes.   Skip the icy margs  they aren t smooth like polvos but they are cheap.   I ll be back. Ugh I ll be back.
Taquerias Arandinas,50,Hola amigos  So... no me gusta  first off. I didn t like an item and asked to have it removed  the gentlemen serving us said he d take it off  went to talk to his manager and CHARGED me FULL price for it anyways. I m not sure if his manager said no or what  but that wasn t communicated to me as he handed me my check without remorse. So not only was the food mediocre at best  the service was horrendous. I do not recommend this establishment.  No volvere aqui.
Taquerias Arandinas,51,Taqueria Arandinas with the TACOnnoisseurs.  Welcome back everyone  to another tacoventure with JazzOne and I.  This time we went to a place that many of you know  Taqueria Arandinas.  At first I was told that it was a late night place to go after too many drinks  and not to expect too much. I have to say that I was delightfully surprised.  We ordered the barbacoa and al pastor as usual and both were good. The barbacoa was very rich and had the slightly sticky texture that I m told comes from using the cheeks like the original recipie calls for. The pastor was well seasoned and just a little fattier than we d like. Both varieties were very respectable in size and satisfaction.  The tortillas were flour and maybe a bit better than average. Our tacos came with onions  cilantro and both red and green salsas which were good but not great. The menu also lists a few vegetarian options for the days when beef  pork or chicken just won t do so there should be something for everyone.  Jazz and I had a tough time with grading this one  it was so close to an A but not quite there so we re giving it a B  . The bang vs. buck  Jazz s scientific value scale  is high and the price is right  earning them a single  .   If you ve got one near you  check them out and let us know what you think.  Special thanks to our guest TACOnnoisseur DonnaJean.   TACOnnoisseurs   TacoQuest2016   bestfoodaustin  Caruso4510   Jazzone   TArandinas
Taquerias Arandinas,52,Yes I am a fan..finally after being here for almost a year..my husband and I moved here from California...we found a real Mexican food ..yummy burritto..its fresh lengua..its the California burrito lol..and it was huge ..the price was really good too..they charge extra for chips and extra salsa but it s okay..We will come back to have a taste of their other dishes..the restaurant was packed too..the food was 5 rating because really it was perfect..but the service..they failed miserably with me..but I dont care I love the food..the service was 3 should be 2 lol but anyway its generous 4..next visit it might be 5 if their service is better...we will see..
Taquerias Arandinas,53,My friends and I were at Emo s for a show. I looked online and saw this place had 3.5 stars. This may have persuaded  Austin types  to stray but not us. I ordered the taquito plate with al pastor and campechano tacos. They were delicious. And the beans were incredible too. Ignore the star issue at this place and get here.
Taquerias Arandinas,54,Me and my friend Rufino went to eat at this place. The food was decent and in a pretty good amount. He got the street tacos and I got the pork chop breakfast. Food came pretty quick  drinks needed more flavor though.
Taquerias Arandinas,55,This is the best restaurant my mom works there. They serve the best food and it s cheap it s tasty I recommend you to go here it is the best Mexican food. The best service.they are funny too very friendly
Taquerias Arandinas,56,Breakfast was ok however it was hard to enjoy because some girl  whom I think had a mental condition  was yelling at the customers and confronting them for no reason. She must be related to the owner because she went in and out the kitchen yelling. Sad that management let that happen. Spent my time listening to this person yell at everyone and harassing the staff. Not good for business  get her some help  Very disruptive.
Taquerias Arandinas,57,We were served right away. The Al pastor was alright but the service wasn t what I was looking for. We needed water refills  salsa for the chips  amp  I wanted to order something else. By the time my friend finished her food 10 minutes passed and no visit from our waiter.  If you have time to spare  sitting at a table doing nothing for 20 minutes come here.
Taquerias Arandinas,58,You know  I was going to give this place a 3 star based on my most recent visit  but then I remembered what it was like when I was living in Austin  and it deserves 4 stars. Let me elaborate  the problem with the Austin Mexican food scene is that its all Tex-Mex  I blame San Antonio   and the truth is that there s a substantial difference. Taquerias  relatively speaking  is a 4-star Mexican restaurant  even though its a 3-star compared to the selection in places like El Paso.   Allow me to extrapolate  Mexican food is the only thing El Paso is better than Austin in  the score is like 999 999 999.9 to 1.
Taquerias Arandinas,59,We live north and we always drive to this one bc of the service   Felix the bartender always take care of us really attentive  food always good fresh and hot  drinks are so good we recommended this place 100 
Taquerias Arandinas,60,The portion sizes are good - they use much larger tortillas than at most taco trucks. However  the taco fillings left much to be desired. I didn t think the blend of shredded lettuce and tomato complimented the beef fajita taco at all. The barbacoa taco was decent.
Taquerias Arandinas,61,I ve only been here twice but I just revisited and let me just say this is as authentic as it gets. Very good service as well as the classic chips and salsa were very nicely spiced and the aguas frescas tasted like my own grandmothers mix    Anyways the dish I got wasn t the best but I m sure it s just wasn t my style. The only reason I m giving it a 4 star is because out tortillas got cold really quickly which is always disappointing other than that everything was fantastic  A little pointers b4 u go it s self seating and once you re done with ur meal u pay at the front  
Taquerias Arandinas,62,When it comes to tacos  especially the breakfast variety  I am picky. There are too many variables that can take a medicinal hangover meal from  Let s start drinking again   to  I think I m going to puke   This place does not mess around. They are just the right amount of grease  melted cheese  soft tortilla  and perfectly spiced salsa.   As if that wasn t enough to make you a believer  you can call in and grab it to-go all in like 10 minutes. It s the perfect motivation to actually get out of bed in the morning.   I ve been a couple times to sit and dine in  too. They have specific breakfast items that aren t available all day  but mostly serve their full menu all hours. The service is attentive  but not too friendly. I personally don t mind missing out on the chit-chat  so this isn t an issue.   One more perk  before I find myself drooling  the parking situation is great. Plenty of spaces and easy to get in and out of 
Taquerias Arandinas,63,After a run  and running in cold weather at that  I decided to go to this place because I wanted some comfort breakfast food where I don t have to wait long. More importantly  it s cheap. So I sit down and it takes a bit long to get a waitress to take my order. I ordered the eggs  potato and refried beans plate. I just wasn t in the mood for some bacon or sausage. Ironically  I was craving for some refried beans. I will tell you one thing they didn t charge me for chips and the three types of salsa and I finished it quickly. I spared the two salsa. After I finished my food I asked for the check. Time goes by  then I asked another waitress for the check. Then I had to ask another waitress for the check and finally I got my check. I have to say the food was okay but the service was slow.
Taquerias Arandinas,64,While on a business trip to Austin   I went to this Mexican place not once   but twice.   Both times it didn t disappoint.  The tacos are perfectly seasoned.  I tried the tacos al pastor  barbacoa  chicharr n  and adobada.  All were very tasty and I highly recommend it.   I had two different steak dishes and both were on point.  The tamarind agua fresca so good  Their service very good as well.  Affordable prices and big servings.  I really recommend this place if you re in Austin.  Do not let the outside fool you.
Taquerias Arandinas,65,Beware   Unsanitary    My girlfriend ordered the fried Tilapia.  She was served raw fish.  Cold. Raw. F   ing. Fish.  The cook had evidently breaded and fried a frozen filet.   The server seemed to be annoyed that she was asked to exchange it for something less dangerous  and never even offered any sort of apology.   My girlfriend s food arrived fully one half-hour after mine.  When it came time to pay  I informed the owner  who was working the register  of what had happened.  He was unconcerned.  I suggested that some discount might be in order... Owner  No.  You changed the plate  so... Me  Yes.  Did you expect her to eat the raw fish  The owner refused any sort of discount.  Bad for business. Food  Awful. Customer service  Worse.
Taquerias Arandinas,66,Second time having a bad experience. Make sure if your food is cold  expect it to either be reheated as stated by staff or they ll have you take it to go. Either way  if you try your food to taste  you are expected to pay for it right out.
Taquerias Arandinas,67,How long do I have to make this so that it s not just a tip  And how long does it have to explain just how horrible this place is  HORRIBLE    The food was mediocre but the service was horrible  Horrible  I wouldn t come back here if they paid me to eat here. One of the worst places I ve been to in Austin.
Taquerias Arandinas,68,If I cannot come up with dinner options because I get off work late this is where I go. They have delicious cheap tacos. The beans are good  with dash of salsa  and while I am not a rice fan the Spanish rice here is quite good.  I generally order the pastor tacos  they are generally spot on  sometimes it doesn t have enough pineapple flavor. I can also get them on flour or corn tortillas. I have found the pastor to be good on flour while I prefer the barbacoa  or guisada on corn.  I don t really care for the chips they use  but the salsa is thick and flavorful. Also  I think they should switch from can soda to fountain drinks but that is just a reflection on their business model.  I think the most underrated item on their menu are the burritos. They are massive and super cheap. I was really surprised at the amount of meat which was inside  when I saw the size I assumed I was going to be overwhelmed by filler. Definitely something to consider if you are starving or considering getting something you can get 2 meals out of. And they conveniently cut it in half for easy rationing.  Recently they have added mini tacos which you can get with any of the meats on the menu and they are just as good as the full size tacos but you get 5 of them so you can really diversify.  These have become a new favorite.  I have also had the torta and while it was quite good it was pretty much a standard issue torta  but then again that s why it is essentially a Mexican hamburger.
Taquerias Arandinas,69,I don t understand the rating on this place.  A group of us went for lunch  amp  everyone enjoyed their meal.  Some of us returned for breakfast the next day.  Parking can be tough because the do so much business.  Corn tortillas are hand made.  The pineapple cucumber agua fresca is amazing
Taquerias Arandinas,70,There s not a ton of authentic Mexican food in Austin  but this place is mostly good. I love their green salsa  It s so good and super spicy which I love. But not a bland spicy it s very flavorful. I LOVE their flautas and quesadillas. Their queso is alright  it taste like velveeta queso which isn t bad just not the best. Their tacos are 50 50 some days theyre great some days they re super crispy and the meat is dry. But I guess it depends on the cook. Overall  it s a good place for a quick meal with great service.
Taquerias Arandinas,71,If you like COLD enchiladas  this is the spot can t  believe they would serve A cold dish then the Manager Felipe refuse to correct the problem No Beno
Taquerias Arandinas,72,I am rather disappointed with the overall experience. The wait staff was horrible. No one came to fill water or anything.  m currently in the restaurant now and there are 4 other groups of people here and 4 waitresses.A bus boy cleared my plate 15 mins ago and no one has been back with a check or to ask for anything.  The food was okay... Nothing to write home about. The mole sauce was good.  ... Honestly still can t believe I m still sitting here waiting. I see them in the corner just chatting.  I won t be back. There are way too many amazing Mexican places to settle for this one.
Taquerias Arandinas,73,Right off of Riverside close to 35 this spot is legit. Likely my most frequented Mexican restaurant that isn t on wheels. Everything I ve had here is on point and delicious  from tacos to the enchiladas  and the best Chile releno I think I ve ever had. Cool it all down with a horchata to beat back the raging flames of deliciousness. Better than taco more across the street by a landslide.....and I like taco more......but more for their soup and not their tacos strangely.
Taquerias Arandinas,74,Well  the food is decent  I ll give  em that.  However  I was charged on three tacos for cheese we didn t get.  I know she understood me  I saw her write  con queso  on the ticket.  Still  we didn t get it.  Why   I did get a bit of the  I don t know English  attitude  and it took forever.  I don t know  this kind of thing doesn t happen anywhere else I ve been  and my friend here tells me she had the same experience with them more than once.  I don t get that reverse racism paranoia as a rule  but I wonder  man. . .
Taquerias Arandinas,75,I came here late at night for some tacos. Tacos were great  Home cooked Mexican food vibe  I really want to try their steak or shrimp upon my return. The best part is their prices  Good Mexican food that is friendly on your wallet     Will return
Taquerias Arandinas,76,We were scammed last night at this Riverside location. We ordered a Caldo de Res   7.59   a Plato Combinado   8.99  and a soda   2.49 . The total on the register clearly said  20.65. The man verbally told us it was  30.65 and we objected. He haltered  stammered and objected back and we added the total up from the menu  plus tax and it totaled  20.65. He relented but he still charged  30.65 to my debit card for the meal. I had left the restaurant by this point  and my fiance did not catch it when he signed the receipt. I am furious 
Taquerias Arandinas,77,This place is terrible not sure how it s still open. I got the enchilada Texana and it s basically just cheap queso thrown on some chicken in tortillas  the rice was bland  the Beans were dry. The kids quesadilla is just one small tortilla folded in half
Taquerias Arandinas,78,This place has very good service and they never mess up on my order. The festive music from the juke box is loud  but I find myself dancing to the music and enjoying myself. Love the environment  love the food.
Taquerias Arandinas,79,Can t say enough great things about how sweet and sincere the staff is  The manager is so personal and on top of all the great hospitality  the food is so tasty  Coming from south Texas  I m always looking for a good caldo that matches my grandmas...this is the place  Check it out ...I m in love 
Taquerias Arandinas,80,Don t judge this place from the Outside...it s not all trendy like downtown Austin  but I doubt that it s trying to be. Once inside  IF you can find a table  cuz the place is constantly busy  Tacos are Incredible. 3 x for  2.99  the Taste  amp  Quality is worth every penny  The hot sauces are actually Hot  soooo Gringos Beware of the Hot Sauce   LOL    If you like HOT Hot sauce  try the Green Avacoda-colored one it s tasty and packed a hell of a Kick in the Heat Department  The Red Sauce is equally as tasty would fare about a Medium heat. The Dark Brown sauce would equal the Mild one and has a lime-like tangy flavor to it  I don t like it  but again I think the invention of Mild sauce should be Outlawed on the planet Earth     even though it doesn t look like it would be..    ALSO  I Highly Recommend trying the Horchata drink....it s just plain Damn Good  for those of you who have never tried it  it s kinda like  cold Chi Tea   cinnamon Deliciousness    GREAT PRICES    GREAT TACOS    COLD BEER WHENEVER YOU WANT ONE    LIMITED ENGLISH BUT WHO CARES  You re not there to order a hamburger and french fries   
Taquerias Arandinas,81,With all the Riverside after-hour crowd I always see here  I m surprised no one s written a review yet. Anyway  food quality first. I ll be honest  its not healthy for you - but its authentic Mexican tacos  quesadillas  chilaquiles  and more. None of this I m-still-buzzed-Taco-C crap. Arandinas has the best authentic burritos  huge   my brother swears by their chilaquiles  and their Horchata  rice-milk drink  is almost as good as in Mexico  awesome.    You ll have to point to what you want to eat  since most of the help doesn t speak English. The girls that wait are always up for a laugh from indecisive gringos  including me at times  and seem to enjoy chit-chatting among themselves. Not attentive about refilling chips or drinks  but its hard to care when the food is quick and the drinks are large... and you re in the process of sobering. Oh and the owner is friendly and cute as a button.  Extra  nice patio seating  and their jukebox has Latin Pop as well as that old Ranchero-accordian-based tunes. Take your pick.
Taquerias Arandinas,82,This place is sooo good    Very authentic. Great barbacoa  al pastor  and salsas   Definitely a 5 star hole in the wall   
Taquerias Arandinas,83,I used to hate on Austin s Mexican restaurant selection until i was referred to this wonderful place by a Hispanic friend of mine that used to live in Aus and I must say I m starting to feel a little more at home      I had a meal here this past Friday  Saturday and Sunday   I ve tried so far   Pozole- freaking legit  good  home flavor.  Chilaquiles regular- they were aight  where I m from in Mexico they re made a little different.  2-2-2- two pancakes  two eggs  and two slices of ham  Bistek Ranchero- good flavor  meat was a hard     Sincrornizada-  like a quesadilla  yummy   I also picked at my BF s food  he had   Torta de carne asada Cubana style  Taco de Pierna  Beef Quesadilla- same thing meat was hard.  hard meat was on Sunday    Most of the servers do not speak English  i played translator     On average our meal was bout  22 w  tip.  The place looks hood  especially the bathroom but its all good. Its my type of place.  Try it  I give it the beaner approval.
Taquerias Arandinas,84,The Torta Hawaiian  was too legit to quit    Visiting Austin for the first time and this was hands down one of the best places. I ordered the torta hawaiian  hueracha and a chorizo taco because I couldn t choose only one   They were all super yummy and tasted like something one of my Tias would make on a Saturday morning
Taquerias Arandinas,85,Disappointed in the manager they didn t have steak so they gave me chicken instead. Owner wouldn t give a discount even tho the bartender pleaded. If it wasn t want for the bar tentenfef it would of been a horrible experience. Thank Felix the bar tender with an awesome tip he made the experience better.
Taquerias Arandinas,86,We went here last night after our son s graduation.  Places open late was limited. I saw it got decent reviews. We were very disappointed. Service was slow  which I can deal with for good food  but the food was bad. Our daughter ordered pork chops and the pork chop had a funny taste to it as to be spoiled. Our other daughter ordered pancakes and eggs. When we cut into the eggs to mash them up they had an awful rotten egg smell  needless to say we paid and left.
Taquerias Arandinas,87,This place is cheap and damn good. You get three salsas and complimentary homemade tortilla chips before you can even settle down in your seat.  The menu is both in English and Spanish  used to be just Spanish  and even has pictures in their menu in case you don t know what barbcoa looks like .    I recommend the burrito  regulare  because 1  it s cheap - less than  5 and it is guaranteed to fill you up   You can be brave and add queso to it but I guarantee you you ll regret it later.  Tortas are the way to go here too. I recommend the al pastor or the barbcoa. Tortas all have fresh guac  shredded lettuce  tomato  mayo baked in the fresh bread  and jalape os.  Also  this is the best and non crowded place to go to after an evening of drunkenness in Austin. Sure beats the hell out of those overpriced and overcrowded late night counter food places after 2am.
Taquerias Arandinas,88,I ve never rated something 2 stars. I am now. and I like that when you click those 2 stars it says next to it...  Meh. I ve experienced better.  CUZ ITS TRUE.  I dunno. it s a huge menu. I m vegan I KNOW I CANT BE PICKY i went here with two regular omnivorous friends. they were also like MEH. one said his barbocoa was not good. but did say he s had it amazing there before. so maybe it s hit and miss    THEIR TORTILLAS ARE FUCKING BOMB THO.  I got those on the side with guacamole which was okay and A TINY PORTION for just tooooo much money. and my pico de gallo  dear lord it was maybe 1 8 of a cup and i got charged for it. and it was more jalepenos than tomatoes. literally i was dying. but all their shit is hella spicy. THAT FREE GREEN SALSA IS A SNEAKY BITCH  it s good and then all of a sudden WHAT THE FUCK OUT. but then again i m also pretty wussy when it comes to spice haha. Oh and my friend got a margarita it was just that shit out of a frozen blending machine and it was gross he said. Serive took ridiculously long as well. It took them 5 minutes to come back and tell my friend they were out of the daily special. like really  5 minutes later   Any who  I DID NOT HAVE A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE but omg i have had WAY BETTER MEXICAN FOOD. and i like all mexican-- from hole-in-the-wall no english speaking mexican food where it feels like someone s grandma is cooking for you and you re like YES  -- to chipotle. haha.   i dunno i feel compelled to say it was nothing special and i just felt like i wasted money and i don t like that feeling cuz i m a broke college student.  but other reviews seem to be positive so maybe it was just when we were there. none of us left particularly happy.  ok done.
Taquerias Arandinas,89,Okay I just left that restaurant and I will never go back I have black skin I sat down and a minute and a half later two other gentlemen sat up right across from me as soon as they smear down a waitress attended to them and did not even acknowledge me. If you have black skin please do not ever go there
Taquerias Arandinas,90,This specific location is like a Mexican IHOP  very generic food. Only  I ll choose this Mexican IHOP over an American IHOP any day. However  it s just not as good as the Taquerias Arandinas on North Lamar and Rundberg. The food is a hit or miss.  I don t recommend the California Burrito. Justno. But I had to go with three stars because their salsa has been consistently fresh  They offer the red salsa by default but you can ask for the green salsa also. Both are delicious but I think I like the green salsa more.   Also  they open til 3am on weekdays  Nocturnals  add this to your list 
Taquerias Arandinas,91,Sign on the front says homemade tortillas.. but they definitely taste store bought. They never refilled our small bowl of chips even though we ordered queso. Also my tamale was burnt so much it stuck to the husk so I couldn t even eat it. It s nice that they are at least open until 2am  but after a while they just microwave old food from the day before. So good luck if you go to this place.
Taquerias Arandinas,92,This place is just awesome when you have a good server I get the quesadilla with chicken breast and a side of barracho beans and rice the rice is ok but always seems as if it has been sitting they also have a steak dish which is just awesome it starts with a T today I learned that Saturday is the best day to come I definitely recommend this place
Taquerias Arandinas,93,Amazing food  I ve grown up working in the service industry for a long time and I ve never seen such an efficient restaurant. Everyone was so friendly  and quick to seat me help me figure out what I wanted to eat  immediately. I wanted a custom order  and they made sure to make it happen without question. I haven t even asked for my bill yet  but I could care less what the price is- the quality of food and service was unparalleled.  -Kyle
Taquerias Arandinas,94,I went at 2 pm today Sunday to get breakfast. I waited for 15 minutes before a server brought menu. I wanted a machacado plate which the menu says breakfast served all day. The waitress told me they don t serve breakfast in the afternoon. I showed her the menu where it says served all day. She then told me that s only weekdays. I asked her where on the menu it says and she could not because it DOES NOT SAY THAT   I left upset and will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE. LIARS AND CHEATS. READ THE OTHER REVIEWS.
Taquerias Arandinas,95,So the food was good  but the mole was not authentic at all it was overly sweet and really just tasted like sugar.  the first dish came out 10 min before the other meal did.... and then when my order finally came out it was totally wrong.  The service is AWFUL as in you may get one glass of water the whole meal because you can never find your waiter again.  I m also not sure why they would put someone as a server who couldn t speak any english whatsoever  luckily my mom is bilingual and could translate but the server still messed up the order.  At first we sat against the wall  until I saw about 100 ants walking along the window sill right at table level.  We were there for 2 hours  it was not busy at all  and it was overpriced.  They didn t take off any of the meals they messed up I actually think they charged us for both.   Would never come here again unless it was take out and I don t even know if I would trust that.
Taquerias Arandinas,96,The chile con queso was incredibly good.  Almost like cheese soup.  If you like mole  the mole enchiladas are the best mole I ve ever had  and at  8  one of the best valued meals in Austin.
Taquerias Arandinas,97,I love their calde de pollo  it comes with 2 huge pieces of chicken  corn on the Cobb  Avacado  etc. it s delicious 
Taquerias Arandinas,98,This place is disgusting     Upon ordering a plate of barbacoa  I was amazingly surprised at the speed of which it came out. It was lightning fast only because it appeared as though the plate had been sitting under food warming lights all day long. Everything was dry and old looking.   Plus it was the worst service ever and it seemed to us that our waitress was having a difficult time keeping her tiger striped thong in her pants. All in all bad food  bad service and bad experience with all the Raff Raff  coming in off the streets. To top it all off my wife stayed sick for days due to her meal.....
Taquerias Arandinas,99,I used to love this place. The food is amazing but the service was HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE  I m in the service industry and completely understand the whole server job to a T. I am the most understanding guest when I see my server busy or overwhelmed and will TIP always at least 20  for good service. I understand the service is NOT going to be as good as another restaurant but this was different. First  our server was attentive enough to greet us in a timely fashion and bring us drinks. Then we got our food... my order was WRONG I ordered CHICKEN not STEAK plus our food was COLD. But we let it go and continued to eat it because it happens at times. Then our server never came back. I watched her EAT at the bar  never prebussed our table  never checked on us  watched her talk to another table chatted for 10-15 mins and then proceeded to go back to the back. We literally waited for 30 or so minutes... I even pressed the button for service  which I did NOT want to do since I see it as rude but come on    . No answer. None we had to flag our lady down for the check and as we were paying she hovered the entire time.  I loved this place but I can t give my hard earned cash to someone who does a poor job.
Taquerias Arandinas,100,Most everything is good.  Just don t get the tacos to go.  They are so tiny   I d understand if I ordered taquitos  but regular breakfast tacos...no vale  The tortillas are legit and soft.
Taquerias Arandinas,101,I miss Mexico so much and went to eat the pastor tacos  is not exactly like Mexico but omg they were good  the milanesa torta was the one that didn t fulfill the expectations but the tamarindo water covered it
Taquerias Arandinas,102,I liked this place. I ve been here a couple of times. The waitresses don t speak english  but knowing a few words in spanish was all I needed.  I really enjoyed my tacos. It was under  10.
Taquerias Arandinas,103,The best thing about this place is that it is open early and late. I ve tried several menu items and all of them are better elsewhere.
Taquerias Arandinas,104,Lived in Austin over 30 years  over 20 in south Austin  can t believe this was my first time here.  It s a Big Al kind of place  hole in the wall  not trendy  no hipsters  real Mexican food.  Had the Tampiquena plate with carne asada.  Decent flavor on the meat  the beans tasted great.  took one bite and say  wow  these are good beans.  A lot of menu choices  will def return.
Taquerias Arandinas,105,I love their tacos and chile salsa a lot. Took my friends there and they found bones in there chicken tacos. Finally tried their barbacoa taco and found a piece metal in it.
Taquerias Arandinas,106,Authentic and delicious mexican food  Have not failed to impress every time I show this place to Latinos and non-Latinos
Taquerias Arandinas,107,I give this place probably 4 stars  maybe 5 depending on the day  for the food and maybe 2 for the service.  The food is amazing depending on what time of the day you decide to get there  salsas are delicious too . If it s busy  not so much. Parking can also be a bit of a hassle.   I love getting the Burrito California  Enchiladas  Chille Rellenos. WOULD RECOMMEND.   The manager seems to have some kind of complex and can be a little rude but maybe it s due to the stress  I m not sure. Otherwise  service can take a bit of time and servers can take awhile to come back to your table once they leave.  Lastly  it s open until 3 AM on weekends so it s a great place to stop by if you re not a fan of El Taquito.   Regardless  I think this is probably as close to authentic Mexican food as it gets.
Taquerias Arandinas,108,Having been to Mexico a number of times  this place felt authentic to me. The food was good  spicy and not too much. The green sauce blew my socks off. So much flavor and spice mixed together. I had the huevos con nopales since it s not something many places have  and it was made wonderfully. I finished my plate  and even had some of my girlfriends migas    The only downside is the wait staff is not very good. No one came to our table after the food was brought  but we were done before long anyway  so it s not that bad of a thing. I would definitely recommend.
Taquerias Arandinas,109,I ordered the steak and it came with Spanish rice  pico  avocado  beans  french fries  and lettuce. The food was great  enough for one meal. I accompanied my meal with the pineapple cucumber juice that was DELICIOUS. My guest drank the melon juice and he enjoyed it. The meal was relatively cheap and matched the quality. Keep in mind  for TexMex it was realllllly good.
Taquerias Arandinas,110,Ordered a carne asada burrito but sadly the meat was fatty and tasted old. The tortilla was good and probably the best part of the burrito. Service was friendly and nice but for  7  I ve found way better burritos in austin and won t be back.
Taquerias Arandinas,111,I ordered two tacos to-go right before they closed. The first taco was what I expected. Had nice flavor  juicy  and tender. The second had a FUCKING USED BANDAID. Which means all the tacos they served with that pot of fajitas was soaked in BANDAID JUICE. I just wanna know what the bandaid was for. A small scrape  A wart wound  Or a blood test for Hep A  I m even more angry that I can t get a refund for the DISGUSTING and TRAUMATIZING experience of biting down onto a used bandaid.
Taquerias Arandinas,112,The food is good but the staff here need better communication skills on how to address issues like stale chips and stale attitudes   I did love the barbacoa taco and the nachos   Delicious 
Taquerias Arandinas,113,I was really craving for some mexican food last night so my roommate was super nice enough to go and try this place. I REALLY wanted some taqueria  like the one in houston  taqueria cancun   but I never really ventured out for authentic mexican here in austin... I dont know why    When we got there  the inside seemed pretty legit. Unmatching chairs  weird paintings on the tables  music that comes on spontaneously throughout your meal... everything seemed so homey..     Last night  I decided to get 1 enchiladda  a bowl of rice  and some queso for us to share  my roomie had already eaten dinner before   . But at first the waitress didn t quite understand my order..   They weren t too great at english  but for some reason that makes me want to give it more kudos points   Other than that  they were very friendly  and super awesome    The enchildad was pretty good  and the rice wasn t bad. The rice was a little.. different than what I was used to back in houston  but not bad.   The green sauce was VERY spicy  but really good when you mix it in to the queso.  The BEST part was the chips  very light and crispy.   I give it a 3 star because it was good  but not exactly the best... price is definitely a plus  cheap cheap cheap . But it wasn t exactly a place that I felt the urge to want to come back again and again...
Taquerias Arandinas,114,So first off  this place has great food. The problem I have  and what s driven me to make this review  is that the service here is horrendous. It s happened again and again  I ve lost count. Sometimes the food is worth it for me to go through the ridiculous hurdles this place has literally set up almost 98  of the time. I live right down the street from this restaurant  and I ve had to go through leaps just to get an order. The food is not as entirely spectacular as I may make it seem  but it is worth it to me to go through obstacles on those days I need my fix for a good home cooked Mexican feel. It s genuinely good  I ve been desperate on some occasions I ve visited  to be candid. I have  on over at least over the last five encounters  experienced the following  phone line is dead  being hung up on  having someone put me on hold for over ten minutes  having my order completely butchered  been hung up on for phone orders for speaking English  Spanish is my first language  but being Tex Mex  I speak Spanglish sometimes so that can be my fault . Overall  I love this place  I just wish it was a more positive experience when I ordered from here. It s the awkward human experience element that makes me hesitate  I love the food  but I can t let these horrible customer experiences go unnoticed. Hopefully it gets better  Thank you for reading.
Taquerias Arandinas,115,Not a TexMex place its much better.  They serve great Mexican food and the service was terrific.
Taquerias Arandinas,116,It doesn t get much more authentic than Taquerias Arandinas.  I mean  if you can t speak Spanish or can t handle spicy  this place may not be for you.  It was my friend Janessa s birthday last night and all she wanted after a couple of beers was some authentic Mexican Tacos  she is originally from Utah .  We gave this place a shot and it was great.  She loved her tacos and I thought the chiliquiles con pollo y salsa verde was rocking.   For two beers  two meals with chips  salsa etc. our bill was right around  15.  You can t beat that anywhere.    Our server recommened the mole  and fajitas for next time.  I really can t wait to get back to try it 
Taquerias Arandinas,117,I came here on a cold and stormy day with a massive hangover. The hangover that requires a good food fix to get your head right. The world was spinning and I was pretty damn annoyed and to compound the problem the waittress didn t speak english but gave us some bad ass chips and salsa. The three types of sauces hit the spot and I was ready to go back home and pass out but we hadnt ordered yet   I had the huevos rancheros and they were the shyytee. Its mexican food thats homely and doesnt weigh you down. ...I still went home and passed out. I m almost definitely sure I was still drunk...  Looking forward to spending more hangover mornings here 
Taquerias Arandinas,118,This place is cheap  and good.  I went for the second time yesterday because it s cold in Texas and they make a very good caldo de res.  Once again  I was not disappointed.  I took one of my friends there who had the cheese enchiladas  and he said they were also very good.  Our total check was  16.    The staff is not the most attentive  but we really didn t have to wait long for anything  although it s probably better to go with someone that speaks Spanish.  I d definitely go again and try other stuff  they have a really expansive menu.
Taquerias Arandinas,119,This place doesn t look like much from the outside  or from the inside really...there s not a lot of ambiance to speak of   but  holy shit  the chilaqulies   Get them with green sauce and over easy eggs  and you ll have a plate full of sloppy mess that will surely satisfy.    My better half is a huge fan of their mole enchiladas  which toe the line between bitter and sweet  and their cinnamony horchata.    We live pretty close to this location  but I m pretty sure that if we moved to Georgetown  we d still make frequent visits.  Highly  highly recommend.
Taquerias Arandinas,120,Two words.  Barbacoa Burrito.  You ll thank me later.
Taquerias Arandinas,121,Friend who recommended this place  I LOVE YOU   I have had the hardest time finding a decent Mexican food restaurant in Austin that was worth a damn.  Yeah  I said Mexican NOT Tex-Mex.  I moved to Austin at the beginning of the year from South Texas  where delicious Mexican food is a-plenty.  I knew my plight would not be easily remedied  as I had lived here before  and I had never found a decent place to consume my favorite kind of food.  Until today  that is.  Let me start by saying  this is not the same as the type of Mexican food that I am accustomed  but it is damn good   I ordered one of the combo plates for myself.  It came with a crunchy beef taco  a cheese enchilada  and a chicken flauta  as well as rice and refried beans.    The beans weren t much to write home about  but I didn t have to ask to substitute borracho beans  eew   for refried  which made me feel right at home.  They let me substitute my cheese enchilada for beef  no questions asked.  The chicken flauta was delish   Unfortunately  it was stolen from me by my two year old  son who usually won t eat anything  because  eeeeeww  that s nasty       He inhaled it  Then there was the crunchy taco. Ooooooh  the crunchy taco   It was great   Home made taco shell STUFFED with meat and cheese.......I m sorry  I was just daydreaming about that taco   Mom  AKA Partner in Crime  ordered the tostada ceviche and the beef fajitas.  The fajitas were tasty  but a little dry.  They came with bomb-ass home made flour tortillas  though   The tostada was okay  but I wouldn t recommend it.  The service was similar to any Mexican restaurant.  The server comes  takes your drink order.  Then she comes back with your drink and takes your food order.  When she sees that you are done eating she brings the check  and you pay at the counter.  By the way  did I mention that for the combo  the fajitas  the tostada ceviche  a kids cheese enchilada plate  and a medium horchata we spent under  25 prior to the tip  I could eat that  right there   Bottom line  I am coming back.  Unless you can find somewhere better here in Austin  I am going keep coming back again and again 
Taquerias Arandinas,122,The best Al Pastor tacos by far in Austin 
Taquerias Arandinas,123,This review is just for breakfast.   Chips are out of a bag.  Salsa is so-so.  Egg plates are quite reasonable and standard Mexican fare.  Beans are a bit bland  but fine.  Jamon with your eggs is a big but thin slice of lunchmeat ham.  Tortillas are advertised as freshly made and they are pretty good  but not great - a little dry.  Very very nice service.   Best part of the meal is orange juice  they squeeze it fresh and it is delicious.  2 breakfast plates  chips  salsa and tortillas   2 coffees and one very large orange juice will run you about  16.  They have chilaquiles - I should have tried those.
Taquerias Arandinas,124,When you visit  you might notice that that not only does the service not speak english but most of the customers don t speak very good english and the place is packed everytime I visit.  This is ok though  in fact  I consider this a good thing.    The pozole is very good  but usually sold out   try the lengua  it s tongue but it s quite tasty   and the horchatas are good too.  I have also enjoyed their menudo and barbacoa and I believe they also sell cactus - but I ve had that at the north location but it was good anyways.
Taquerias Arandinas,125,Based on the flies on windows and the horrible service...this adventure is not gonna turn out very good...  And know the gloves come off..This by far has been our WORST trip yet...We have never seen customer service so BAD....First was the filth...windows  floors  and  the bum in the parking lot asking for money. The flies were really bad  sitting by the window I counted at least 8 at one time  and having to swat at them constantly make the whole meal suck..The only time we saw our waitress it when she brought the apps and food.  Wife had to get up and ask for chips  but what do you expect for a half serving of chips  then to charge you .99 cents for each refill...Wife ordered enchiladas with green sauce on the side  no beans double rice...out comes enchiladas with red sauce on top...wife explains what she wants  and out comes enchiladas with green sauce on top...several review for this location and other comment on the lack of understanding orders..Its not my job to explain my order  its yours to understand it  will make for a successful company  trust me...And it was obvious they had put beans on the plate as well  scraped them off and covered the mistake with rice. When my wife found the beans  meal over. Combo plate for me..crunchy taco  cheese enchilada and chicken taquito...With was the driest thing I have ever had in my life  with NO flavor. The enchilada sauce was weak...over powering tomato flavor  border line spaghetti sauce  with little or no  mexican  flavor. I mean really  canned enchilada sauce tastes better. Same with the meat  same type of flavor. Beans were decent at best. I dont get the good reviews...I have been to over 25 different place like this  and this falls SO short...One word that sticks out in a lot of other reviews is the word cheap...and We will take good over cheap any day....
Taquerias Arandinas,126,HOLY HELL this place is good  Damn good   I m originally from Amarillo  TX  which is why I moved to Austin  and had a small restaurant there where I could get my chilaquiles fix. It was great. I ate there twice a week for a year. Well  I moved here a year and a half ago and STILL had not found a stand in for my chilaquiles  That is  until now. The red sauce is perfectly spicy  the tortillas are still crisp  the cheese is copious  the beans are just right  and the carne asada  which is the meat I ALWAYS pair with my chilaquiles  is delicious and tender and big. I can safely say that I have not only found my stand in  this place surpasses the old shack back home  Hell yeah   Apart from that  the salsas are awesome. They covered all bases and I can t imagine anyone not being able to find one that they liked  green is my fave because it is hot hot hot . The tamales are also freakin  amazing  and cheap. Got a dozen and took that shit home.  If you haven t eaten here  do yourself a favor and go. Now. You ll thank me later.
Taquerias Arandinas,127,My little brother refuses to eat at any establishment claiming it s Mexican if the name doesn t contain the word  Taqueria  in the title. This place will only strengthen that thought in him. How do you beat food that is served that fast  tastes that good  and is so ridiculous valued   We walked in yesterday and we were the only non-Latins. Check. We sat down after a nice afternoon on the GreenBelt and they gave us HUGE glasses of water immediately. After I vaccuumed mine up  they even immediately refilled it. A second person quickly brought us chips and salsa. The darker chipotle salsa was good and flavorful but had a nice kick to it. The flavor of the other salsa was good and fresh. The salsa verde was creamy and surprisingly spicy. I also had an appetizer michelada which probably was my least favorite thing here. It just didn t have the right spices for me and way too much salt.  Our meals  I had an Al Pastor Torta  my brother a Torta Cubana with Lengua and Fajita and a barbacoa taco  my girlfriend the Menudo soup. The al pastor I had was now by far the best pastor I ve had in Austin. Spicy  flavorful and tender in every bite. Combined with the other ingredients  it was an amazing salad that was tasty and refreshing smashed in between two pieces of freshly baked bread. The barbacoa was not just the typical fatty stuff but this was flavorful and not dripping in grease. The lengua was so tender it simply melted in my mouth. The menudo was the best menudo I ve had in a LONG time. The tripe was tender enough to break down in my mouth and not be too chewy. There were tender pieces of beef that simply melted with soup. The flavor of the broth tempted me to pick up the bowl and just sip.  Our waitress was nonstop catering to our needs. She quickly gave us more salsa  chips  water  and everything all with a smile. On top of that  even other employees were making sure we had a good experience. BEST PART WAS THE BILL though. All that food and service was under  20.
Taquerias Arandinas,128,Pretty chill place  food was pretty good and was served nice and pretty quickly. Sauce is super hot  would more than likely visit again
Taquerias Arandinas,129,The food sucked. They messed up the order and they wouldn t fix it. Worth the extra 5 minutes to drive to a better taco place.
Taquerias Arandinas,130,I was trying to take my boyfriend to eat at El Taquito  but couldn t remember where that was located. So  we ended up at Taquerias Arandinas. As far as Mexican food goes  it feels pretty authentic. The primary language spoken is espanol  and they have lenguas and chicharron on the menu. The service is pretty bare bones  they take your drink order  your food order  and then leave you alone. You pay at the counter after you finish eating. I had a lengua taco and a chicharron taco  and my boyfriend had the combination enchilada place.   I hadn t had chicharron before  and wasn t too impressed with it. It s pork rind that has been braised in a spicy  tomato based sauce. The lengua was more to my liking. Tender beef tongue on a freshly made flour tortilla with cilantro  onion  and a squeeze of lime. Yum. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his enchiladas. Our lunch cost a grand total of  11  so take that.
Taquerias Arandinas,131,DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PASS THIS PLACE  continue another 30 seconds up Riverside and go to Rosarita s Al Pastor  either the restaurant or the food truck  in the same lot . The food here has gotten worse and worse during the last few years. The service has never been good. Can t wait until gentrification destroys them  They don t really deserve to exist any longer. By contrast  Al Pastor has home made tortillas  amazing pastor and Barbacoa.
Taquerias Arandinas,132,Man  as a broke college student this is the Mecca for my wallet  though not my waistline . They bring you out 3 kinds of salsa  all great  but the tomatillo avocado cream one is AMAZING. Their barbacoa taco platter is to die for  and one of the best authentic Mexican dishes I ve ever eaten. Amazing tortas  tacos  quesadillas  etc. Really easy to get 2 meals out of  5.  Don t come here and expect to have your     kissed by the waiters. They ll fill up your drinks  bring your stuff out  but like another reviewer says they don t fake the pleasure of serving you  but as long as my food gets out I m fine.   Also  the place is open 24 hours. Can it get any better 
Taquerias Arandinas,133,I had the Carne asada which was really good. My friend pretty much had to order for me since the waitress didn t speak English to well. Wait times were very short great atmosphere with music playing.
Taquerias Arandinas,134,There is a good kind of greasy  and a bad kind of greasy  and this place falls under the category of  bad greasy.  After having an okay breakfast taco experience here  decided to try it for a full on dinner. Ordered the barbacoa taco plate  and there was so much grease on the plate that the tacos were floating. Mostly flavorless on their own  but I was able to choke one down with the green sauce which happened to be the highlight of the meal . The queso was so watery that it wouldn t even stay on the chip  although it was cheap and served in a fairly large portion. Service was prompt  and I credit that to the fact that there was only one other table seated.  With so many great choices for Mexican food in this neighborhood  I don t really see a point in visiting this place again unless I was drunk and it was an emergency.
Taquerias Arandinas,135,This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  I like the salsas and the food is cheap.  Also  it s open late.  I went in at 11pm on a Sunday night after an unsuccessful trip to Chipotle to find the restaurant buzzing with activity.    The atmosphere and service can be a little sketchy  so if that really bothers you  get your food to-go  although  2 for to-go chips .  My meal came out fast and hot.  I will definitely be returning soon.  For the same price as a Mc Donald s meal you can get chips  salsa  and a meal.  WIN  Edit  They gave me for poisoning. Not so win. I will now be enjoying my tacos across the street at taco more.
Taquerias Arandinas,136,Best Mexican food in Austin.  I ordered the combo plate  2 every time  and my boyfriend gets the bistec a la Mexicana.  Absolutely amazing - one of my favorite places in town.  Their tamales are the best - and always a surprise.  Spicy sauces and dips.  Wonderful prices  too.  We love all of the candy at the counter too - Lucas for life.
Taquerias Arandinas,137,Straight talk  this place does not mess around. This is one of my go to spots in Austin for an always perfect meal at a beyond reasonable price. I have been coming here for years and have seen the place go through some changes but some things always stay the same like the great food and very friendly service. Seriously  try anything on this menu and you will not be disappointed  There is a great jukebox in the back and the ambiance is usually always very chill. I love to come here for a late dinner because they stay open late most nights.
Taquerias Arandinas,138,The chipotle chicken is my go to  and I don t think I could ever get anything else. The homemade tortillas are ON POINT. I always leave hating myself for eating way too much  but it is so worth it. Cheap Mexican food at it s finest. Unfortunately  my Spanish is very minimal  and most of the staff speaks no English  so be prepared to have at least the basics so you don t seem like a jerk.
Taquerias Arandinas,139,Gosh I just love coming here for breakfast.  When I am in Austin this is my place for some Mexican breakfast plates. My fianc  enjoys their fajitas. This place is a casual setting. Nothing fancy but just good Mexican food.
Taquerias Arandinas,140,I eat here several times a week... generally just breakfast tacos  sometimes some enchiladas or ceviche and a michilada.  For those who haven t had one  it is a tasty drink made with your beer of choice... I recommend Corona. It s  sort of like a bloody mary  but with beer instead of vodka.   The staff is always friendly and I love the song selection in the juke box.     Fun place to hang out for a bit.
Taquerias Arandinas,141,BEST Mexican food.... so authentic  amp  yummy  
Taquerias Arandinas,142,This is my favorite place for Mexican food. The staff is very friendly and they remember that I usually order the Huevos Rancheros. They bring chips to the table with 3 hot sauces. The red sauce is my favorite and the Tomatillo and Jalapeno are blazing hot  My red sauce is hot but cooler than the other 2. The coffee is great.. fresh  and not too strong. My Huevos rancheros  are always cooked to order  and they come with fantastic papas fritas  potato squares perfectly browned  and refried beans that match the best I ve ever had and three home cooked flour or corn tortillas.  I can never resist saying  Mmmmmm   over and over. I live out of town but I always try to eat there whenever possible. I have to try more selections from their extensive menu. The parking area is small but it s well worth a short walk to dine there. They should be rated Ten Stars       Lo Mejor   Gracias 
Taquerias Arandinas,143,First time we went there  Everything was great...The food tasted the best  service was great...but yesterday their service and food sucked ..Food wasn t fresh. server didn t check on us and we were on our own...It was a total disappointment  ...Totillas were cold  fajitas meat was pink...I would think twice before I go there again...
Taquerias Arandinas,144,It s not every day I end up in the back of a town car asking the driver to find me the best available burrito  an emergency landing and associated flight delays had left me both stranded and famished . I do kind of wish every day of my life was like that though  minus the emergency landing part. Anyway  the Burrito California was delicious  super fast and super cheap and I enjoyed the assortment of salsas that came with it. Should fate ever bring me back here I want to try the enchiladas  as I saw some coming out while I waited for my burrito and they looked amazing.
Taquerias Arandinas,145,Food is delicious  service is really bad. We hardly ever see our server after our food is dropped off... meaning no drink refills after that
Taquerias Arandinas,146,Amazing food. Friendly service. Great environment. Good parking. I m definitely coming here again. Oh  and they serve breakfast all day.    I had some of their breakfast tacos. YUM.
Taquerias Arandinas,147,Food is great.. Our server was really sweet and attentive.. Prices are reasonable. And the Melon agua is so good.
Taquerias Arandinas,148,Great tasting  authentic Mexican food. Huevos rancheros fit the bill nicely  and the service was excellent.  The breakfast special lricIf you haven t stopped in yet  check it out 
Taquerias Arandinas,149,I ordered the cheese quesadilla and I asked the server how big was it  her having a hard time speaking English she said that the big was huge so I thought I would get a small and it was just 1 tortilla. My husband ordered the beef fajitas and he said the beef was cold  chewy   amp  hard. Would not recommend this place.
Taquerias Arandinas,150,Quick  easy and cheap  The food is  authentic  and greasy as ever  but it s good enough for a quick breakfast or dinner. The frozen margs aren t bad  either.
Taquerias Arandinas,151,This is one of the better Mexican food restaurants.  The chicken chipotle is my favorite.  It s been a few weeks since our last visit.  The chips are fantastic and the refried beans have a wonderful smokey flavor.  We were pretty disappointed that they have cut their meal portions In half.  I even asked the waiter if it was supposed to be so small and he said yes.... The cup of salsa was a 1 3 of the usual cup they used to offer.  About 6 dips and it was empty.  You can get another small cup if you ask.  They did not refill our chip basket.  Still good food but much less for the price  which is a shame.
Taquerias Arandinas,152,I love their tacos al pastor    Very simple place and very reasonable. Staff is always friendly.
Taquerias Arandinas,153,When I first came to Austin this place was wonderful. Could not get enough of it. Until  I had several HORRIBLE experiences. To name a couple. Let me start off by saying that most employees here do NOT speak English. Which is completely fine with me. I know a small amount of Spanish and can use hand gestures to get the rest figured out. One particular time I was here with family friends that were in from out of town. This was a goodbye lunch before their long 5 hour treck back home. It was embarrassing.  Not only was every single order wrong  but my food as well as another TODDLERS food did not come out until an hour after ordering  not to mention the 30 minutes it took us to get our order in placed in the first place. Not a single person even got their meal at the same time. It was ridiculous. The parents ended up having to give the meals they had just to keep the poor hungry boys at bay. -There was no screaming coming from them  not that could be heard over the roar of people and the juke box we were next to anyway. The second incident  despite leaving without my food at all previously. I was with 3 of my friends. It was around 9pm when we all arrived. We were very patient with the waitress. However  she was CERTAINLY not being very patient with us. It took us pointing and trying to use hand gestures about 5 minutes each to explain what we wanted. She did not pay attention to the hand gestures at all. Or even really bother to look at what we were pointing at on the menu. Once my food finally came it was not right at all  no one s food was btw  and on top of that... it was stone cold. I ordered cheese enchilada s and It tasted like it had never even been pushed through the oven. Honestly. Good food. But if your not Hispanic  You should certainly avoid it. As the look on anyone s face there when trying to ask a question isn t a look of confusion  but a look of total anger and annoyance.
Taquerias Arandinas,154, 2.75 beer   I had to start with that  cause it is just awesome. Definitely a language barrier  but not insurmountable. We had  Barbacoa  amp  Al Pastor Tacos  Cheese Enchiladas Verde  Queso  and chips and salsa.  The Al Pastor a standout  Barbacoa OK  queso quite yummy  cheese Enchiladas  real cheese  solid. The Salsas as stated were awesome.  I could dip a shoe in the green sauce and be happy.  Any-who  all that food and 6 beers for 42 dollars including tip. Lively and happy atmosphere  good service. Their Torta s are my next goal. Muy Bueno 
Taquerias Arandinas,155,Came for lunch and like it so much we came back for dinner. One of the best lengua and barbacoa tacos I ve had. Also had the pork burrito. All were excellent. Chips and 3 types of salsa as soon as you sit down. Again  one of the best salsas I ve had. I m still trying to figure out what the verde creamy salsa is made of. I can have just that for everything. Prices were very reasonable   1.69 for good size tacos . Service is excellent. Highly recommended restaurant   
Taquerias Arandinas,156,Great food  So sad to see chain Anglo-owned restaurants coming in when there is such great local authentic food like this in the area to go to instead. Get the alambre plate.
Taquerias Arandinas,157,This is by far the best  Mexican  food I have ate so far in Austin texas one of my friends told me about it and I would say GO there green and red sauce instant mouth gasm
Taquerias Arandinas,158,The BEST SALSAS in austin.  No flaws in this place. Tamales and breakfast are second to none
Taquerias Arandinas,159,Nice traditional Mexican atmosphere  friendly staff  and very low prices for decent food. I got the chicken torta.
Taquerias Arandinas,160,Crappy neighborhood  but this place is on my way to work.  I ve driven by here over the past many years thousands of times  never stopped.  Until this week.  Yum.  Got 2 breakfast tacos to go.  They were a little smaller than expected  but packed a powerful taste punch.   And no yellow cheese here... white gooey queso goodness along with homemade red salsa and creamy green.  WILL be back  
Taquerias Arandinas,161,This place doesn t look as appealing on the outside as it is on the inside.  It is no showplace by any means but the inside was definitely more inviting than the outside.  Migas.....decent.  Waitstaff......very attentive.  Prices.....very affordable.  I took my laptop in with me to work on homework while I ate breakfast.  They did not rush me and were attentive for the entire 2 hours I was there.  It was quiet when I got there but they turned the music on mid-morning which was too loud.  Otherwise  it was a good experience.
Taquerias Arandinas,162,Had the huevos rancheros and the tamarindo and it was very good. Also the salsa provided complimentary with chips is solid  great taste and a nice slight kick.
Taquerias Arandinas,163,Delicious food  quite cheap  open late.  The food  while it may be kind of greasy and generally not the healthiest  is delicious. It s significantly more authentic than most of the other tex-mex places around town. The chille relleno is my personal favorite. It comes with tortillas and often turns into chile re-tacos or chile re-nachos too.   The portions are generous. Often  I can share a meal with another person. We feel bad for only spending  7-8 for two people  so we end up tipping them  5 .   I haven t had a bad experience with the service yet  They re always tolerant of my terrible spanish  and usually  I can communicate with them just fine.   The atmosphere is my favorite part. Usually  there are spanish soap operas playing in the background and the customers are all hispanic. For some reason  that makes me feel like it s especially authentic. There s also a jukebox. Every time I ve been there in the last couple months  there is a cop in the parking lot. Before that  I would always get barraged by pan-handlers in the parking lot.
Taquerias Arandinas,164,My boyfriend and I go here all the time and we always try something new each time. We ve never been disappointed. In fact  while we re eating it  we catch ourselves saying   Gaaah this is sooo goood     We ve had the quesadillas  pechuga de pollo  carne guisada  fish tacos  and beef tacos. They are all full of flavor that can t be beat. The only disappointment is you can t get a good margarita here - only frozen  but they have a decent beer selection. I highly recommend this place  and don t be fooled by it s outside appearance  
Taquerias Arandinas,165,I thought the food and atmosphere was very authentic and the wait staff were all very friendly and helpful.
Taquerias Arandinas,166,Great food price is good as well it doesn t look like much from out side but don t let that fool ya cuz the food is awsome
Taquerias Arandinas,167,Food is usually decent - tho it s obvious when it s a different cook. Recently chips have been stale - even when we would tell them and ask for new ones. Most of the waitresses are okay. But be sure to watch what they charge you on check out    Very inconsistent   We have  HAD  been regulars for a while - using the coupons from the back of HEB receipts. Cashier yesterday would not allow us to use 2 coupons even tho we were a party of 4 paying separate AND she over charged for one item. Hope they enjoyed our business while it lasted   
Taquerias Arandinas,168,The food is great for the price  stay away after 2am as you will not be able to get a seat. Will say you should know a bit of spanish to order  but other then that  you can t beat the food for the price you pay.
Taquerias Arandinas,169,Cheap cheap cheap and good. Would have to say try their tortas. Simply heavenly combination of rich flavors for a quick lunch  The fajitas for two are very good too.
Taquerias Arandinas,170,Yes  I agree  it s ick food.  Don t go back.
Taquerias Arandinas,171,Being from south Texas  I had a craving for some really good authentic Mexican food. When I left here  I still had that craving because this food was crap  as was the service. The waitress rarely asked if we were in need of anything  and the only time she did  she dropped our drinks on us. No bueno. I will not be returning.
Taquerias Arandinas,172,Maybe I m too gringo for this place or order the wrong food  but I don t like it.  I really wish I did.  I work the night shift  and this place is one of my few options.  I found the service to be friendly.  The language barrier didn t matter much.    I remember eating here years ago and leaving with the same impression.  This food sucks.  On this most recent trip  I ordered beef fajitas.  They weren t as cheap as I expected at twelve dollars.  I was optimistic this might have been a good sign.  It wasn t.  The fajita meat is scrawny and well over half fat.  It tasted ok if you like fat.  Most of the plate was onions.  The rice and beans were about what I would expect from any taqueria joint.  The salsa was pretty good.    I just couldn t get over how horrible the quality of that meat was and to charge normal restaurant prices for it is absurd.  I received much better and cheaper taqueria food than this from Taqueria Chapala when I worked at the Y in Oak Hill  and I didn t think that food was anything special.
Taquerias Arandinas,173,Good food  chips  amp  salsa come with two types of salsa and spicy guacamole...really good   Had the torta cubana de milanesa  it was goodand so was the service  
Taquerias Arandinas,174,My family and I ate here last night while visiting Austin. Our experience was horrible. They got our order wrong. When we got our food it was cold  My carne guisada was ice cold -_- My husband s enchiladas had very little sauce and were dry. They advertise that they serve homemade tortillas but the tortillas we ate were obviously from a package. They were tiny and rubbery with a funny taste. Never again    That food was a insult to our Mexican culture 
Taquerias Arandinas,175,When you order a parrillada they should bring it to you with the meat sizzling hot  smoke in the air of how hot it is. But it was anything but sizzling. It wasnt even that hot..the meat did not appear freshly cooked..more as if days old. We ve really enjoyed this place in the past but with each time its getting worse.
Taquerias Arandinas,176,It s not healthy  but it is cheap  I ve only been here for breakfast  but the food was quite good. The tortillas tasted homemade  the verde sauce was amazing  and the huevos rancheros were a delight. It s a greasy spoon  with a hole in the wall type atmosphere  but I like that about it. Expect your more-than-filling breakfast plate to run about  3.99. You can t beat that 
Taquerias Arandinas,177,Salsas will light you on fire.  Service not so good  waited forever for a second basket of chips and a drink refill.  I ordered the combo plate  1.  The food was pretty darn good. Price was reasonable.
Taquerias Arandinas,178,Delicious. Cheap. Eclectic Ambiance. And that spicy Yellow Sauce  mmmmmmm.
Taquerias Arandinas,179,So this place is pretty authentic Mexican food at a tremendous price. However  this place tends to be a hit and a miss for me quite often. I find that when Carlos is cooking the food tastes the best  but the other cooks tend to make their food really bland.  The waitresses can be a bit scattered and unattentive sometimes  but I usually never complain because the food comes out quick anyways. I d recomend the Burrito California and the Tacos al Pastor  wayyyy better than any place on Riverside for sure. I ve been here over a dozen times and you can t beat the price for the quality on Mexican food anyday.
Taquerias Arandinas,180,Best AUTHENTIC mexican in Austin.  My husband grew up in mexico so he is really picky about his mexican food and refuses to eat  tex-mex  or anything that resembles it.  This is one of the only mexican restaurants in Austin he will eat. We visit central Mexico at least once a year and this place comes the closest to that style of mexican food.  Excellent agua frescas and salsas. Delicious. cheap.
Taquerias Arandinas,181,This is one of the best and most reliable chains of Mexican food in Austin. Arandas and Arandinas are always good. I see a couple people have complained about service. That s not something you worry about in a truly great Mexican restaurant  you focus on whether or not the cooks turn out consistent and delicious product  not whether you got a water refill. It s basically counter service  so you go to the register to pay  get a to-go box  ask for a refill and consider that when you leave your tip. Simple. You definitely get a little more help if you speak Spanish in the Riverside location  a couple of the waitresses are shy when it comes to speaking English to the customers  I ve noticed. The food is absolutely always outstanding and the staff there is incredibly friendly. Their Chilaquiles with fried eggs  chicken breast  and refried beans is possibly the best thing I ve ever eaten.
Taquerias Arandinas,182,Oh taquerias arandinas  how I love thee  Always my late after party meal spot  i am so hooked and so are my friends. What s not to like about this authentic interior Mexican gem   I ve yet to have a bad experience here. Don t go by the looks  this is a great little spot for a great time w friends   The owner is the nicest guy ever and so are the servers. Just try it 
Taquerias Arandinas,183,My favorite little restaurant in Austin  I ve been coming here since I moved from NYC and it never disappoints. The Burritos California is amazing and so huge that I can never finish it. Their homemade Chicken Tortilla soup is to die for. As with most places there is complimentary chips and salsa and their options of three salsas are spicy enough to make anyone sweat.  The beverage options are pretty basic but their food goes well with a nice ice cold negro modello. I ve never had a problem with the service and you can get a really awesome dinner for 2 for under  25 can t be beat 
Taquerias Arandinas,184,Checked this place out on a whim one day  and so glad I did   It has an authentic feel and the food is great.  The service is pretty good  too.  Very reasonably priced.
