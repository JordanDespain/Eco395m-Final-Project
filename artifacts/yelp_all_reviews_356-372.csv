Taqueria Hugo,1,You can taste in each bite it is home made  the tortillas  the marinated meats  everything down to the different daily special fruit drink. No mass production  just you and your taco. No caniving  swindling  or tricks... just a good business  making good food  at a good price. I will be coming back soon with new people  hungry for more. Like their tacos there is no need for fluffy or modifying the truth of the delicious business.
Taqueria Hugo,2,Was so excited to try this place as we have been craving something equivalent to Mexico City street food. The food was good but we definitely got ripped off.  10 piece for a Gordita is insane.  40 for 4 gorditas and they don t tell you the price until after they make your food. Will never consider this place again and steer anyone we know clear of it.
Taqueria Hugo,3,You might drive right past this blue trailer and picnic tables because there are usually several cars parked in front. And don t confuse it for the one around the block  use pics for reference  this is truly a hidden gem  Easily the best tacos I ve had in Austin. I m from Southern California and have loved authentic Mexican tacos for years. The kinds that don t really need salsa because the meat is so well cooked and seasoned. They come with cilantro and onions and you can add Grilled onions too. They come in 5 types my favorite are the Chicken  carnitas  and suadero  brisket . They make killer quesadillas  fried quail  menudo and their breakfast tacos are choice as well. They have some killer cantelope  pineapple  and strawberry jugos that are delicious. They only accept cash  but if you are kind and ask  you might be able to Cash App. The family that runs this stand is so nice and mostly speak Spanish  but the daughter speaks English quite well. I have fallen in love with this place and you will too after that first bite 
Taqueria Hugo,4,The barbacoa quesadilla dorada was 10 10.  A little pricey but good af. Great Mexican food
Taqueria Hugo,5,On the hunt for the new location of the El As del Taco truck  I traversed the entire length of Burleson Rd. Alas  there was no El As. But there were other opportunities to get my taco stalking fix.   In the lot of a Tejano club stood an unmarked taco trailer  emblazoned with posters for a boxing match. Several scantily-clad mamacitas lingered about. Key variables which are highly associated with great tacos. And another one  Handmade corn tortillas - check. And a surprise treat on the menu  Quail enchiladas. Already full from another taco run just an hour ago  I had no room for the quail  so I ordered a mere beef fajita taco. I fell for it at first bite. There was a certain astringency to it that was beguiling and led to the heat from a pickled mix of onions and habaneros. The meat was expertly charred and deep-flavored. The mid-thickness corn tortilla  hecha a mano  was flawless. Before I finished it  I had already ordered another with suadero. A repeat of the first  with unexpected sauteed onions pushing the experience onto another level.   The ladies who run it are from Michoacan  but they don t serve carnitas  I ll return to see if the quail makes up for that.
Taqueria Hugo,6,Chicken tacos on corn tortillas are awesome  amp  for me that is a lot to say.  Im very picky. I got one  amp  had to come get two more. Must try. Delicious. Exited to try some of the other menue items.
Taqueria Hugo,7,Best bacon and egg tacos in town. Get them on corn tortillas 
Taqueria Hugo,8,Convenient taco truck right off the highway. Service is always great  The al pastor taco is my go-to  amp  I really like the flavor of their salsas. Also  the club next door provides good ambiance. Andddd they re open until 2AM for those late night munchies- major bonus.
Taqueria Hugo,9,Great goat  chivo  tacos. Only available on Saturday and Sunday before they run out  around 1 or so . Best stop near the airport for authentic tacos. Owners are from Michoac n.
Regios Al Vapor 3,1,Their tacos al vapor are the best I ve ever had  I do recommend getting the 5 taco combo since its a better deal than getting them individually  Tacos are a little small but still not bad for the price.  Get chicharron and deshebrada  you wont regret it 
Regios Al Vapor 3,2,The  1 al vapor--5 assorted tacos and a MX Coke   My life will never be the same they are so good.  Pull in right off of Lamar and change yours.
Regios Al Vapor 3,3,In search of tacos for lunch  I spied this truck in the corner of the HEB center at N. Lamar  amp  Rundberg. It strangely faces the busy road instead of the shopping center  with picnic tables in front  so if you park in the HEB lot you have to walk from behind the truck around to the front. Odd. Anyways  the electronic menu wasn t working  and there is no other signage or menu online. Hmm. Guess I ll just ask if they have Al Pastor  though the painting on the truck indicates that they are known for their asada tacos. Yes  they are mostly Spanish-speaking there  but my order-taker and I did just fine with Spanglish. Yes  they have Al Pastor  which I got on flour with the requisite cilantro and diced onion  along with salsa verde. The tacos were served on a paper plate covered with foil  with a slice of lemon instead of lime  and 2 containers of salsa  one small and one larger.   The Pastor meat was very flavorful  but somewhat chewy.  Maybe a smaller cut would help   It was spiced and marinated nicely. The tortillas were good  but I m thinking not homemade at the truck. The toppings were fresh. The salsa was a bit different than the usual verde or creamy verde--kinda something in between  with definite heat and a tang  perhaps from lemon. The tacos weren t expensive  per se  but maybe a bit pricey for that area of town  but they were of a generous portion so I feel they are priced right. Besides  something has to pay for all that extensive  attention-getting painting on the truck 
Regios Al Vapor 3,4,I came here today after I took Thing One to get his second Fauci Ouchie inside of HEB  off of Lamar  amp  Runberg . I usually never come to this part of town as there is truly nothing I cant find over here that I cant find closer to my home.   On the way back to the car  Thing One noticed the food truck and decided it may be worth a try.  We ordered 5 taco asada s. Wow  color me impressed. The tacos are authentic and the meat was tender and flavorful and the green sauce is slap your mama good  If in the area  I will definitely stop by and try other menu items.    This is a Spanish speaking only truck  So  for those que no hablan Espa ol  yah betta brush up on your skills.    apoyarlosnegociosLatinos  supportminortyownedbusiness  supportlocal
Regios Al Vapor 3,5,The tacos Al vapor here are amazing. They are authentic to what you would get in Mexico. The price is pretty good for what you get. They give you toppings  salsa  and lemons for you tacos. I ve come here two times and have had great experiences. Im not 100  sure if they only speak Spanish. As I speak Spanish so I ve had no issues ordering here. I ve been taking my tacos to go and every time I arrive home they are very warm. They package them securely which I appreciate. I highly recommend this place. If you re looking for tacos Al vapor. I haven t tried their regular tacos  but they re al vapor is so good. 10 10 
Regios Al Vapor 3,6,Best Lengua and Asada Tacos  Quesadilla are bomb  definitely get 2. Salsas are good and spicy 
Mariscos Los Jarochos,1,The jury is still out on Mariscos Los Jarochos.         What scares me about this place is the disrepair of the physical plant.  My bench was kind of falling apart.  In the men s rooms  the pipes were twisted and coming out of the wall at an angle.  Lack of maintenance in dining rooms and bathrooms makes me worry about how well maintained things are in the kitchen.         On the plus side    I had a shrimp cocktail that was perfectly lovely.  Both the shrimp themselves  the produce and the sauce were just fine.  And yes they were fresh.  Service was excellent.   I did come off hours when the place was not busy.          The other Yelp reviews note either lack of freshness or poor service.  They also note high prices.  The price complaint is real.  There were no issues with freshness or service on my watch.  But if they are charging all this money    And not fixing the building   Might they also be cutting corners on the fish 
Mariscos Los Jarochos,2,Place was recommended to us by a friend. My husband was not very pleased by the atmosphere but wanted to give it a try. Food was blah  service was horrible we waited about 10mins for our waitress to even acknowledge us  on top of that she didn t even bring small plates or any sauces. We had to keep asking for stuff and she never came back to check if we needed anything. We were told their oysters were good but I have to disagree they weren t the best but just ehh and the fried shrimp were over cooked and dry.  Way over priced   Definitely won t be back.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,3,Guadalajara was packed  so I thought I would give this place a second try. I tried it about 8 years ago and was quite underwhelmed. But since it had been so long and they were still in business  I thought perhaps they had improved. Nope. If anything  it was worse. The seafood is not fresh. The food was all over cooked and yet  not actually hot. To add insult to injury  it was really expensive. I could have eaten at one of several upscale Mexican restaurants for what I paid here. Save your money.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,4,Food is overpriced and the waitress was horrible     We asked her if they had tacos and she said  No  only de asada y de pastor     So do you or do you not    We order the tacos and choriqueso.  When the waitress brought the choriqueso and the tortillas  she didn t gave us plates or utensils  we tried flagging her several times without luck. We got the wrong taco order and once they fixed it  the carne asada was dry and no taste to it    The pastor didn t had pineapple and the meat was dry too   The agua de Tamarindo was diluted and to top it off the waitress didn t even check on us until the bill came  I almost fainted when I saw the bill  I thought I had eaten a steak or something. When we questioned the waitress on one item on the bill  she gave us attitude and a dirty look    WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,5,This place was good but also kind of pricey for what you get. I ordered the seafood soup and really enjoyed the presentation of the food and how it was cooked. The staff was really nice and the food was delivered in a timely fashion. I would definitely go again.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,6,Overpriced food that would be worth it IF THE WAITRESSES paid attention to you. We had to wave our server down for everything. We had to ask for a menu and then silverware  and then food  last but not least the check. We literally kept making eye contact with the waitress across the room  bc she was hanging out with the rest of the waitstaff just laughing it out . The worst part of it all  the waitress made us pay for something we didn t order. We really couldn t believe it. My boyfriend ordered red enchiladas and they brought out green ones. We told the waitress and she said she couldn t take them back bc she would have to pay for it. So we just sat there and looked at my plate on disbelief. We tried to eat some of my plate but it was just uncomfortable for the rest of the stay. Definitely not recommended. Enchilada Plate
Mariscos Los Jarochos,7,This place was ok. it definitely had its pros and cons.   PROS  ambiance for soccer games. pretty cool.  CONS  Regulars just walk past the servers and seat themselves. We waited for about 15 minutes  but finally the waitress interrupted another and told her no  the next table is for that couple. Thank you unknown waitress.  Prices. were a little high. my love ordered a molcajete.  21. it was a lot of food but ive seen those for half the price  and taste a lot better.   When the check came my love game them his debit card  the waiter asked for cash. My fianc e said he didn t have any cash  because this is 2014 and everyone carries their debit card. its like visa  everywhere you want to be  He said he didn t know how to work the machine.  uh... that sounds like a waiter problem  not a customer problem . He finally did run his card since he had to  and he included his own tip  which he added  4 to the total which is fine  but he ll never know what he would have gotten if he wasnt trying to be sneaky.   Sucks b c he was ok before that. I ordered the carne asada platter which he said he didn t recommend b c it was very dry  only knew this b c my fiancee translated this for me  I love the authentic places but I also wish I wouldnt get crazy looks when I m not bilingual. Do they do this to other nationalities or just me b c they figure I should know spanish. I get it  I am mexican american. but I am a 3rd generation TEXAN  that I know of could be farther   sorry i speak English  I was born here  sooo. this is where I learned to speak. Now if I was born in Mexico and didnt know spanish  now that would be a shock  but please dont judge me for my lack of spanish knowledge  I came to enjoy your delicious food. be nice.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,8,Amazing food  great atmosphere   My son-in-law brought me here trying to get me to try something out of my comfort zone and I will admit  I was a little hesitant but my GOSH the food was so delicious and the staff beyond excellent  I will definitely be back 
Mariscos Los Jarochos,9,I would give this place Zero Stars if that was an option. The place was loud and dirty. The bottled beer was just cool and the fried shrimp was over cooked to the point of being inedible. The prices were on the level of a legitimate seafood restaurant like pappadoux s but the quality is one of the lowest I have ever had. 20.00 for 6 small  over cooked shrimp  some frozen french fries and some hard  crispy  old rice and a warm beer. NEVER AGAIN.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,10,First time visit today I was starving but let s start with the service the person who receive you very dry and u would think is upset as same as most of the staff- Food is not even good is just okayish price is    this is better for a night with drinks with some friends since there s a Karaoke space ... since I m pregnant and went in the morning was not much to choose from I order 3 beef tacos ate one came with beans I didn t like them at all   chips was good not the sauce it come with but got the green salsa and was tasty pretty much infilled myself with 1 taco and chips and salsa  I m going back  No thanks
Mariscos Los Jarochos,11,The food was good at this location. The parking is horrible they don t have enough parking for the amount of people that fit inside the restaurant. Our waitress took forever to attend us and the food took a long time to come out as well . Be on the look out on your receipt it was a group of 4 that went and they precharged the tip saying  the system automatically generates that  that is BS if you tell me
Mariscos Los Jarochos,12,Me and my husband had lunch here. Crazy expensive for the food quality. Cheap fish. Not flavored well. Salad had old lettuce and mushy tomatoes. Mixed drinks were not good as well. I do not recommend this place.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,13,My God No. Never Again.  DON T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.  I struggled to not use profanity in writing this.  This place absolutely sucks.  Simply put in bullet points   - The music is too loud to hear someone across the table from you... in fact  you can hear it through the wall of the next door restaurant  Together... which I would recommend going to by the way.  I might need to call the police on Together s behalf because they re too nice to complain about the obvious noise violations.  - The staff is straight up ignorant.  They ignore you and ignore your table pretty regularly.  - The Prices are WTF expensive... basic Mexican stuff is  14.99...like something that should be no more than  9... so you re not getting out of there under  50-60 for 2 people for Mexican food... and I didn t even bother to see how expensive drinks were.  - The inside at best looks like your creepy uncle s basement.  Please don t waste your time here. I beg of you.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,14,The worst Mexican restaurant  the food is overpriced and taste awful  I couldn t eat anything it was disgusting the flavor of the soup  I told the waitress since she asked  but she doesn t care . I will never return to this place.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,15,Service is ok. Could be better. Party of five... Found this yelp list of and decided to check it out despite its negative reviews. Well... Big mistake. Someone in my group had a fish entree. Right away you could tell the fish was old and possibly had gone bad. Not fresh fish. We told our waiter who was nice. He went to check with management. Management supposedly tasted the fish and said it was ok and refused to correct the issue. Never again. Actually going to consider reporting them to the health department in Austin. Huge fail on their part.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,16,Very traditional Mexican environment. Very loud music and football playing on TV. Huge bar with lots of selection. Some waitress didn t speak English.   Chips n Salsa was good. Ceviche was too sweet. The empanadas was oily but filling was generous.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,17,The service was prompt and courteous but the food was overpriced and lacked taste. I ordered the shrimp tostada and it was loaded with tons of mayonnaise. I then ordered the shrimp cocktail. The medium is big enough to share between two people as an appetizer. The taste of the tomato sauce was far too sweet for me . The main entree that I ordered was the Jarocho de alambre  it too was not too appetizing. Will not be coming back for seconds
Mariscos Los Jarochos,18,This place was the worst seafood place I ve been to in Austin. It was pricey and the food wasn t all that great and the service was even worst. I ordered the fajitas which normally come with rice and beans but it brought none of that and the waitress failed to even ask if we wanted to add it.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,19,This place has a jukebox playing out so loud. I asked them to lower down the volume and said no.  The waitress was very nice  but her English was very limited.  Now for worst thing about the restaurant is their return policy. I order some tostada with shrimp off the menu and there was no mention the tostadas came mayonnaise. I brought up this to the waitress and she said that it could not return. Her excuse was the order we ll be deducted from her check if it gets return...that s bull   
Mariscos Los Jarochos,20,If there was  0  stars that s what i would give them   We been waiting for our food for about 30 min  they brought out 2 plates out of 7 then after 20 more min brought out he rest  waiter didn t bring any of the sides with the caldo soup  keep asking for refills instead of her checking on us. Worst service ever  the restaurant its not even busy..
Mariscos Los Jarochos,21,The other reviewers hit the nail on the head with their assessment of the music in this place.  It is LOUD.  You have to holler at whoever is sitting across from you to carry on a conversation   Other than that  no complaints.  Everything we ate was excellent.  I had some spicy shrimp dish  my fella had a breakfast dish with eggs and tostadas in some fantastic sauce.  The shrimp had been deveined  yay  and tasted fresh.  Perfect     The chips  amp  salsa are great.  Menu is in Spanish  though  so brush up on food terms before you go there or check out their menu in English online if you aren t a speaker of Spanish.    Will definitely go back  
Mariscos Los Jarochos,22,I would not recommend you go there. I ordered a plate of alambres  shredded meat  bell pepper  onion and cheese . I cannot make this up  half the meat was huge chuncks of beef fat. I mean HUGE mouth fulls of fat chunks. It s almost as if they gave us the scraps from other meats and just covered them in cheese. I ate one taco and could not stomach anymore because almost every peice of meat was connected to even bigger  not exaggerating  strings and chuncks of beef fat. we ate about half of it  I shared with my bf . The meat also had a fishy taste.  I complained and they gave me a 50  discount because we should have returned it before eating any of it. I feel cheated. At those prices  or at any price  this is pretty disgusting. I am never going back.I would have been happy with a full refund on just that dish  would have been happy to pay for the rest. I m so grossed out my stomach is upset. I have literally never had this happen anywhere else. It was ridiculous.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,23,My sister freakin  loves this place so of course we had to go when my husband and I visited her recently. It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon and the place was buzzing because FC Barcelona is playing and you know futbooooooooooooooooooooooooooollllll.   With this big menu of wonderful seafoody goodness  I thought I might have trouble deciding  but there was a seafood rice dish  whose name I unfortunately don t remember  that was sounding really good  and it was super nice. A little more saucy than a paella  and more of a tomato based broth instead of saffron  but otherwise kind of the same thing. Lots of shrimp and octopus  with some mussels and fish as well. I kind of loved it. My husband had the camarones a la diabla  as he does  and he approved highly. My sister got her usual seafood soup and my brother-in-law got what appeared to be seafood fajitas. All were pleased.  And I ve talked about the entrees before the appetizers  how dare I   We got ceviches and  camarones diablas   not to be confused with the entree my husband got . These were shrimps wrapped in bacon and stuffed. The ceviche was definitely near the top of ceviches that I had. I approved highly.   Portions were astoundingly large. Prices were reasonable. Service was good enough  our server kind of disappeared near the end  but it s all good . A  . Would eat again.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,24,I will NEVER again return to this restaurant ever again.  1. We walk in and we were not greeted by the lady at the hostess stand. Not even a smile   2. The place was beyond dirty and smelled  3. The music is way too loud.   4. The staff is ignorant and rude. They walk around with a miserable look and are annoyed with customers. I m sorry but you are a SERVER and your JOB is to serve your customers. I shouldn t feel how annoyed you are to serve me.  5. The food is beyond over priced. There is nothing special or formal about this place so a basic Mexican dish shouldn t be 20.00.   6. The food taste horrible. Everything taste old    7. We go to cash out and the waitress brings the bill. A table of 5 is considered a party  which is ridiculous  and the waitress already added her tip. One ticket was 60.00 and she added a 15.00 tip   The other was 50.00 and the tip was 16.00   When she was asked why the tip was already added she caught an attitude and said  I didn t give myself a tip  she continued to roll her eyes and be rude. She had no customer service skills and didn t try and figure out why we were unhappy.   8.As we are walking out she was taking bad about us and did not care if we heard   THIS PLACE IS A JOKE  Do not waste your time or money on this shit hole  
Mariscos Los Jarochos,25,Here is your Mexican sea-coast vacation  right here in Austin. Get ready to party with the natives as they serenade you with pretty good  and loud   Mexican Karaoke. Drink like a fish as you eat several.  The menu is extensive and inviting and all spanish. We treated ourselves to the Seafood Grill for two. Think  tasty seafood fajitas. A huge portion of food for two for  27. Accompanying corn tortillas were store bought  but soft. There was all kinds of flavor in here. Even bacon  And all of the meat  including octopus  shrimp and catfish      were cooked perfectly and tasted great. Do do not know if the shrimp was from the Gulf  but it didn t taste like it. Always a plus for me   The chips  are very authentic and homemade thick delights served with a tasty  spicy and fresh salsa. And the chips work well broken on top of the entrees for super texture   Our daughter danced heartily to the music and was rewarded with a cute pink balloon animal anime sculpture.  This place really looks like a  local s  place after a certain hour on a saturday night. And that helps  in my estimation. Because the locals always know.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,26,The food is good. Authentic. My daughter s enchiladas were lacking chicken  it was as if they filled them in with the sauce. But the green sauce was good. We loved the chips. The salsa could have been spicier. But the waitress took a while when we asked for things. For the price I think you need to be served better.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,27,I ve been passing this hole in the wall for well over a decade and had never stopped to try it until today. The interior is much bigger than the facade suggests. Loud Latin music greeted me and there appears to be a stage for karaoke. It s clean with a full bar  lots of wood surfaces. I had a hard time choosing what to get  since everything on the menu looked amazing and authentic- no tex mex here. I decided on the ceviche tostada with fish  the pescadillas and the Camarones Jarochos. The tostada came out with a mound of fresh tasting ceviche and a slice of avocado on top. It was tasty. The pescadillas were amazing. Think chicken flautas  but with folded tortillas  rather than rolled  and with tuna filling. I m nut sure what variety of tuna it was  but it had a pleasant fishiness. The Camarones Jarochos was the star  though  consisting of a parrillada of small  sweet shrimp tossed with diced tomatoes  onion  peppers  BACON and covered with MUENSTER cheese - toasted and buttered French bread on the side. Light years from tex mex. It was an amazing meal and I can t wait to go back and try some of the other offerings.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,28,Looking to get some seafood  that wasn t Asian or New American-ish fare  wife and I hit Mariscos Los Jarochos.  We read up on some reviews but didn t have a lot of expectations. As somewhat infrequent Mexican dishes eater  Tochys don t count   it was more of an adventure than anything else.  Well  we had the Parrillada de Mariscos and the Mojarra a la Veracruzana  and both were excellent. The meats were perfectly cooked  just the right amount of spices  and being Koreans  right amount of spices usually means hot-to-burning-fire   and attentive service.   Perhaps the most interesting part of the experience were the looks we got when we walked in. I don t think too many Asian couples frequent the place  and lot of the regulars had what I d call an  amused  look on their faces. Mind you  I know that look since I also sport that face when non-Koreans walk into a  real  Korean joint and try order from a menu with no English on it.   Don t let that discourage you though - we ll certainly be back  and perhaps soon.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,29,Nice place good food great service music and good drinks chips and salsa is delicious
Mariscos Los Jarochos,30,The best Mexican seafood in town.  I d call it a hole-in-the-wall but the inside is actually huge.  They also have a gigantic full bar.  Also  if I remember correctly  there aren t even any non-seafood entrees on the menu  so don t take your vegetarian or seafood-hating friends.    All the seafood here is very  hi  Monica   fresh  and everything I ve eaten here has really nice  complex flavors.  Also  they make their tortillas and tortilla chips in house.  Hooray    Also  portions are huge.  Seriously.  If the menu gives an option of small  medium  or large -- go for small unless you are a member of the UT football team or have a LOT of friends with whom you d like to share.  The first time my husband and I went there  we made the mistake of ordering the large shrimp cocktail.  Okay  maybe not a mistake -- it s delicious -- but it was the most hilariously large shrimp cocktail I ve ever seen in my life.  I have no idea where they got a glass that big.  You could have easily bathed an infant in it.    My favorite thing here is the caldo de mariscos.  It has a thick  somewhat spicy tomato based broth with lots of fish  squid  octopus  shrimp  and crab.  Add a bit of lime  some cilantro  and onions  and you re good to go.   I order the  small  bowl and can never  ever eat the whole thing  even though I really want to.  In fact  it s so great that I haven t actually ordered any other entrees  though my husband has and I always have some of what he gets  Tonight he ordered the stuffed red snapper -- whole fish stuffed with various seafood  onions  tomatoes  peppers  and general goodness  cooked  and brought out  in a foil pouch so all the flavors steam together into an amalgamation of delicious.    Also  if the menu doesn t say otherwise  chances are  when you order fish  you ll get a whole fish with the head on.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,31,I m pretty picky about eating shrimp out as I got Hep A once prom eating shrimp at a chain restaurant. Its a hot day and wanted something cold so ceviche was the word of the day and a yelp search turned up this place that was near to us at the time. The reviews suggested this was the place to come and while it s not a fancy setting the reviews are spot on. The ceviche was very tasty and quite the great value. Just as important to me  the shrimp were super clean..All perfectly devined.  Same held for the  Camarones jarochos great taste and prepared with clean fresh ingredients.  As far as atmosphere is concerned we came early for dinner so for us it was quiet and the service was awesome.  Also just looking around the tables  floors and table condiments were all clean. Overall a Very pleasant experience.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,32,Mi Hermano   Hey man  you wanna grab some lunch   Me   Yeah  but i m low on time and money  so it has to be fast and cheap.  MH   Just like you  Pinche Gordo    Me   Shut up. Hey  What about that seafood place you wanted to try    And we failed on both cheap and fast. BUT we discovered a whole lotta tasty.   The prices are not super expensive  and you ll get well fed for what you pay  but they re pricier than going to a normal taqueria. Mainly because of the seafood  which is understandable.   The service was also pretty laid back. Like WAY laid back. Don t go if you re in a hurry.   Their Margarita on the rocks was definitely using  Finest Call  margarita mix  which isn t much for quality. They were ok  but not thrilling.  Chips and Salsa are always a way to tell if you re going to have a lot of flavor in your meal  and these didn t disappoint. in addition to the house made chips and nicely spicy salsa  they gave us two fried pockets filled with something that was seafood-like  and tasted.... You know that smell by the sea  You know what people are talking about when they say something tastes  fishy   That.   Moving on  we opted for shrimp empanadas and their sizzling seafood platter. I was expecting more in the way of sides to be served  but I don t know if we could have eaten it all were that the case.   The empanadas were flavorful  but a bit runny on the inside. I might try chicken or cheese next time.   The Parillada we had was full of flavor. Grilled onions  peppers  tomatoes and bacon all sauteed with squid  talapia  shrimp  and...something else I couldn t recall. The only thing that took away from this dish was that they used bell peppers. I hate green bells. I d much rather have fewer poblanos  more onions and keep the same food cost than have a heaping mound of bell peppers that I won t touch.   Still  as it was  it was a great meal. All that  plus 2 margaritas set us back about  36 plus tip. Not bad.   I ll likely be back to try their cocktails and their happy hour  which has  1 specials from 7-8pm monday through thursday. Maybe I ll see you there 
Mariscos Los Jarochos,33,This place is SUPER OVERPRICED. The service is the worst and don t even mention the accommodations  they are primitive. Place looks dirty over all and the food is not that good. I am from Mexico  and am used to going to Mexican seafood restaurants and this is in True  the worst I have been to.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,34,Dinner wasn t bad. Left and forgot my sleeve for my computer. They gave me my computer sleeve back  but stole  100 stylus out of it.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,35,I was somewhat skeptical of all the good reviews of this place. Just like all the yelpers said  it was really good. I had the seafood parrilladas with octopus  squid  catfish  and shrimp. All perfectly cooked. It is hard sometimes not to overcook squid and octopus. Not a single piece of my seafood was rubbery and it was flavorful. No one else in my group was willing to order seafood  though my FIL tried a piece of shrimp at the end of my meal and pronounced it excellent. The grill plate meant it was still hot at the end of the meal.  My husband and FIL had the enchiladas. I was a little shocked that my vegetarian husband was willing to eat the cheese enchiladas.  My husband pointed out that it was rare to eat an enchilada plate and not have leftover beans  but there were more enchiladas than beans on the plate. The enchiladas also came with a salad with avocado slices instead of rice. My MIL had two fajita tacos for something different. She said the fajita meat was tender. The guacamole was fresh with big chunks of avocado and the pico di gallo was just the way she makes it at home.  The atmosphere fascinated my 16month-old. It was loud. I think they had Spanish music Karaoke going along with several screens of soccer. I m not usually a fan of loud  but anything that allows me to eat in a restaurant without struggling and chasing a toddler is good for me. Granted  we were all wanting to copy her at times when she had both hands covering her ears for some of the singers. We did all come out singing praises for the food at least.  I should also say that I have a really delicate stomach and it is rare these days for most restaurant meals to agree with it.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,36,SUPER LOUD       They have a jukebox that blasted super loud Norte o music competing against a soccer game and the news in Spanish .. All while an array of seizure inducing light strobes and lasers blare out from the karaoke stage right next to the dining area..  THE MARGARITAS     I could forgo the terrible music and the soccer game and the karaoke room with the lasers.. Bad margaritas with Mexican food I cannot.. I ordered a lime margarita  which are made to order mind you  and was brought the most inedible acidicly tart drink I ve ever put in my mouth.   I like to drink and rarely will turn down alcohol  I firmly believe it can greatly improve your dining experience.. Not in this case... This painful frozen concoction totally obliterated any other favors in our meal and made my whole body shake and tremble every time i had a sip... Too bad  cause I think the food itself was decent..   The service was friendly... The chips were really good  the salsa was decent.. The food itself was actually not bad  my friend had the crab enchiladas  real and fresh tasting crab meat  overall very tasty.. I had the seafood soup  decent flavors  very large portion even though I ordered the small size.. So the food wasn t bad.. but I just couldn t deal with all the combining factors at play in this restaurant..
Mariscos Los Jarochos,37,Went there because my boyfriend said they had al pastor. Once we sat down he realized it was a different restaurant  but we thought we d give it a shot. I m not easily off put by how a place looks  but after eating there I can say that it looked filthy in there and that should have been a warning. The food was inedible. The sauce on my octopus ruined the flavor and there was a water park inside the burrito with some shrimp floating around. Gross.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,38,Generous portions Really good food.  They also have non-sea food dishes like the  Molcajete de Cantina   fajita  chicken  sausage  and cheese .  The salsa is actually a bit hot and tasty.   REAL MEXICAN style seafood.   Great place to watch a soccer game.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,39,Mariscos Los Jarochos is about as authentic as it gets   Great food and very friendly staff. I highly recommend the Ceviche   All the seafood was very fresh and tasty. Plus they offer a pan fried whole red snapper that gave me flashbacks of Costa Rica   I will be back 
Mariscos Los Jarochos,40,So good   A little bit expensive but real Mexican food   I definitely I would go again  
Mariscos Los Jarochos,41,Worst service ever and they couldn t even get the food right. My mom said the servers and managers were rude and didn t care.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,42,Service is bad. The waiter messed up our whole order  there was 5 of us  and we had already waited for over 45 minutes  it wasn t busy either.When we were telling him this wasn t what we wanted he started to argue with my dad about it which isn t a perfect example of how to manage a situation. Personally this is my second time coming and it s my second time being disappointed. WE ALL ENDED UP JUST EATING WHAT THEY BROUGHT OUT FOR US because we didn t want to wait any longer. In all honesty food is good but I much rather go somewhere I m going to be happy being at and not needing to speak very loudly in order for my brothers to hear me
Mariscos Los Jarochos,43,The absolute worse seafood I ve ever tasted in my life... I ordered the Aguachile... for those who do not know what it is... raw shrimp cooked in lime juice with serrano chiles... with cucumbers and red onion.... the best hangover cure... when my food was presented to me it was cooked shrimp in what looked like wonton soup  chunks of jalapenos and tomatoes... the worst experience ever. Never eat here... only thing good about this place was their micheladas... why do they use lemons    it s suppose to be a mexican place  which means limes   
Mariscos Los Jarochos,44,What an authentic surprise  So  so good  Homemade tortilla chips and fresh salsa  huge fried pescado  fish  and delicious shrimp seafood mix... Everything was cooked perfectly.  2.50 Corono s and a tasty Peloma.... Great service  interesting atmosphere.  If I lived in Austin  I d eat here all the time 
Mariscos Los Jarochos,45,Don t be a scaredy-gato-gabacho. Hit this place up  get a michelada  share a big ceviche with your friends  and get a platter of shrimp  octopus  bacon  cheese  peppers in a rich red sauce.. and share that too  because it s huge. Good customer service. Let RuLa be your Soco.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,46,the BEST marisco place in town    i love the atmosphere. the food is incredible. happy hour from 4-7pm.  edit  i haven t been in a few weeks and apparently  i ve missed a lot. they ve remodeled a bit  just enough to make the seating more comfortable. they have new stuff on the table and the menu. i wasn t sure anyone could improve on what this place was before  but i was completely surprised. i m not going to try to name the dish i ate  but it may be the best dinner i ve ever had. seriously. fish fillet  stuffed with seafood  wrapped in turkey bacon and served with an olive oil parsley sauce. oh. my. god. i tried to eat the whole thing. i got through about 90  of it and then asked for a box. yes  it s that good    the staff is always friendly  though sometimes overwhelmed  so don t go in a hurry. the mariachis come around on occasion to serenade. there are happy hour specials on tuesday  wednesday and thursday  on top of the regular weeknight happy hour. and i ve recently learned about karaoke on friday nights. lunch buffet from 11-4 monday throught friday as well.   and... i m pretty sure it s world cup madness in there when the games are on 
Mariscos Los Jarochos,47,It was the  Inception  of restaurant experiences  it was a nightmare within a nightmare within a nightmare.   We first decided to come here because of the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FRestaurant.com amp s 0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  Restaurant.com  a  coupon. Well  that and the fact that I m a pescatarian on Atkins who thought   Mexican seafood  Finally  Food I can eat   When we walked in and presented the coupon on the app  there was mass confusion  and we were told that it had to be printed. I protested a little  because I ve redeemed these things through the app previously at other places  but whatever. We decided to get to a printer  and try them again another day.  We should ve swapped our  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FRestaurant.com amp s 0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  Restaurant.com  a  coupon for a different restaurant.  A week passes  and we finally sit down with a server who says that the printed voucher will be fine. The place is loud. It s Tejano music karaoke night  or something to that effect  and there are huge speakers near a stage. Various televisions dot the place. One was displaying static  another was showing  Naked  amp  Afraid.  When they went to take our drink order  I asked for a vodka soda. Panic ensued. Our server didn t understand what I meant  there s a major language barrier here   and brought 3 different people to our table. We even said it in Spanish  but I guess this place  which has a very large bar in the middle of the establishment  can only make the cocktails listed on their menu. Every time they heard the word   soda  they asked me   What kind   At this point I gave up  and said  Vodka with whatever doesn t have sugar in it. I m on a special diet. I can t have any sugar. Diet coke   So the manager  who s there to help translate what I m saying to our server  I think that s why he was there    suggested that I get a vodka Sprite or a Mexican martini. The man clearly doesn t know what the word sugar means  or is very confused and thinks I asked for... Actually  I have no clue what could have possibly lead him to believe I wanted Sprite or a Mexican martini. I see a regular martini on the menu  and point at it.  That. I want that.  He also asks if I want Sprite in that  or if I wanted the Mexican version of a martini.  He was really set on those two drinks   When I get it  it tastes sweet  which is a huge no-no for my strict diet  and I realize that even in their regular martini  they use triple sec. Pretty sure it was a glass of vodka  olive juice  olives  and triple sec.   My partner tries to order from the breakfast menu because it indicates that there s a certain price before 11  and then the price goes up after that time. Turns out  you can t order from it. No big deal  we settle on crab ceviche and some sort of meat dish. The ceviche is meh at best. Actually  it was worst than that. I m pretty sure it was canned crab in citrus and tomato juices. It was limp  and extremely watery. It was kind of like a fishbowl full of water  with little bits of stringy canned crab meat here and there. My partner was less than thrilled with his dish  and admitted he regretted eating there. As painfully loud music blared  we struggled to talk to kill time during the painfully long wait for the check. I remember seeing my server dart around the mostly empty restaurant doing everything but dropping our check  and freeing us from our Hell. I stared at 3 dust-covered Mexican Barbie dolls that sat atop a shelf over our table. It was a nightmare within a nightmare within a nightmare.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,48,So I never realized the entire menu would in Spanish until I was presented with it. Not being able to read it  I went with y servers recommendation  which was a fantastic seafood platter. The food is all tasty and spicy. I just have to come back with a friend who speaks the language so I can explore the menu a little more.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,49,This place is amazing   Really authentic  haha. They don t give you an english menu until you request it. I really don t care for seafood  and I got the tilapia and literally licked my plate clean. The Jaimaica  sp   drink is really good  and the corn tortillas are the bomb. They have good ceviche too.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,50,My roommate and I stumbled upon this restaurant after a very stressful day in search of a good margarita  We went to the Mexican restaurant across the street and they didn t serve alcohol so we ended up here  It was such a fun atmosphere with loud music and a dance floor where it looked like maybe they did karaoke  Our waiter was really nice and kept apologizing for not speaking English well  it obviously didn t matter but it was sweet that he cared  The food was amazing  but a little too pricey for my liking. Food prices were definitely more expensive than the drink prices. I for sure plan to come back here and visit again 
Mariscos Los Jarochos,51,Shrimp cocktail was awful  greasy and very sweet   salsa was only good thing
Mariscos Los Jarochos,52,Everything we ordered was amazing  Forgot what the dishes were called  but they were great. They also have happy hour after 7 Monday thru Thursday .
Mariscos Los Jarochos,53,i entered the restaurant to hear the owner cussing at his employees  when i finally recieved my drinks it tasted expired  the food came out cold  enchiladas  my friend got sick and top it off the owner yelled and humiliated me when i rejected his food.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,54,Delicious   I ordered the mixed soup  the other two had the camarones jarochos and a beef dish plus three margaritas and a ceviche tostada.  All of the food was VERY good.  Whatta find   Will be back and will probably order the ceviche tostada each time.  The margaritas were whatever  but they were big and strong.  Good service  too.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,55,We were a party of 9. A family birthday dinner. One waitress assigned  she took our order and the order was repeated the times...when we got our food it was all wrong...i asked for limes for my cocktail three times and she never brought it  We asked for extra chips and she brought us a tiny portion.   when we were done we waited at least 40 minutes until one of us got up to ask for our bill. The staff was rude  the manager worst and tho top it off we had teens with us and they have a couple of women soliciting at the men sitting at the bar. The music was loud and the prices were outrageous.  Think twice before taking your family to dinner here and spending your hard earned money. Doesn t look very clean either. By the way complaining tho management is useless seeing as they get disturbed and the Wait staff will gather around you and attempt to intimidate with their glares up tho the door when you re leaving.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,56,The food was horrible. They sale you the calamari as octopus. I got tricked with all the good reviews. I wouldn t recommended at all  or go back ever.
Mariscos Los Jarochos,57,terrible rubbery shrimp...owner came out when I complained said all shrimp is like that...don t waste your time
Tacos Juanita,1,I had a California burrito with chicken  and I was absolutely blown away. It was absolutely delicious  beyond words. The tortilla was so soft yet crispy and the contents of the burrito were just perfect. This is the best California burrito I ve ever had  and I live in California so I ve had quite a few.   My one small note is that I wish the chicken was cooked just a tad bit more -- it looked a little pink on the inside which made me wonder if it was fully cooked. It tasted delicious though   I will MOST DEFINITELY be coming back and recommending this truck to friends. Thank you to the people working inside who were so kind and friendly.
Tacos Juanita,2,Lesser known  but should be more talked about.  This is one of those taco trucks that you may think is random  but they whip out some really good tacos. If you ve had trouble finding a place that does good chicken tacos  not a speciality at most   this is the place to go get them. They re super simple with fresh corn tortilla  chicken  onions and cilantro- but with their sauces just really hit the spot at first bite. It s juicy and not dry  You can enjoy them fresh there as you re hopping around on East 6th.  Took a star away because sometimes you have to wait a little bit and the tables are full  especially since they re in a busy intersection on weekends.
Tacos Juanita,3,Heart be still  Taqueria Do a Juanita  just wow. Conveniently located on the Eastside where all the new bars are located  Taqueria Do a Juanita shines like a beacon on E 6th. I love me a good Torta  and Juanita did not disappoint   The buns on the torta are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Everything on this torta  chef s kiss. So very flavorful and comforting. Highly recommend  whether inebriated or not.
Tacos Juanita,4,I ve been on a quest for the best tacos in Austin  and Taqueria Do a Juanita is at the top of my list.   Perched right outside La Perla bar on East 6th you can find an array of delicious tacos. The flour and corn tortillas are incredible  and the pastor is the best I ve found so far. Their roja and verde salsas are both amazing  and all tacos come with a side of lime. Honestly  just the best taco experience.   Next time you re on East 6th  plan for a visit to this wonderful food truck. Heck  don t wait until you re in the area  make a dedicated trip just for these tacos  You won t regret it.
Tacos Juanita,5,First time here and from California and I was impressed with the food. The quesadilla Al pastor was absolutely delicious as were there salsas. Everything tasted very fresh  I highly recommend this place if you re looking for a late night meal.
Tacos Juanita,6,The food was great  Service was nice   It s a very welcoming small business.  U know the food is good when I say  half bite in   I m glad we came here    The seating area to the side was somewhat dirty but not too bad.
Tacos Juanita,7,Update  Still love Tacos Juanita  especially for its convenience and late hours on weekends. There are times when I get tacos here where I d put them up against some of the best I ve had. The problem I ve come across recently is the quality of the food is inconsistent. I highly recommend any of their breakfast tacos  the lengua tacos  barbacoa  and al pastor. All delicious and some of their more consistent food items.
Tacos Juanita,8,My favorite taco truck  The barbacoa tacos are to die for. I m addicted. Also loved the Al pastor and chorizo.
Tacos Juanita,9,Slow service. Bad burrito. I was told 10 minutes but 35 minutes later I was still waiting. Burrito was super greasy and barely had anything other than the fatty cuts of meat. I was not sure if I ordered a Philly cheese steak sandwich or a burrito SMH
Tacos Juanita,10,Ordered 2 beef tacos on corn tortilla  it was so delicious. They use authentic Mexican corn tortillas  I ve been looking for tacos this good in Austin  The lady that took my order was very nice. The salsas were so tasty  I love spicy so I recommend the red one but the green one is also good. Definitely going there again.
Tacos Juanita,11,These tacos are absolutely mental. If you are walking down sixth and you think you might need a taco here...or anywhere in Austin...do it. Eat these tacos. I promise you...you don t know me...I m just a guy on Yelp...why would I lie to you...what do I get out of that   Would have taken a picture but we devoured it too fast...personally we got the fajita beef quesadilla 2 tacos.
Tacos Juanita,12,Absolutely excellent tacos and burritos. I m that jerk that didn t want to write a review until I moved from the Eastside because I was afraid my favorite taco spot in Austin would get raided with too many Chads at all times of the day. But hey  better late than never    Seriously  this place is awesome and centrally located in the heart of the Eastside  next to Volstead  White Horse  and so many other great bars. They got everything from quesadillas  tacos  burritos  gorditas  and nachos. Swing by 
Tacos Juanita,13,Happened across this place on a Saturday night. The tacos were TO DIE FOR. Fairly priced. Had the pastor  lengua  and chorizo. Every single one of them was an explosion of flavor. Still think about them everyday since...
Tacos Juanita,14,One of the best taco places in Austin. A must try spot here for delicious breakfast tacos  quesadillas  really the whole menu. I would highly recommend it  It delivers so well every time too. And they have the best sauces  I always crave them 
Tacos Juanita,15,My boyfriend and I LOVE this food truck  This is our go-to spot when we want tacos quesadillas. We love this place so much that we will refer to this place as  our girl s tacos .  We have only tried the vegetarian items  so I cannot speak for the items on the menu that have meat. The vegetarian tacos are delicious and so are the carrot empanadas. They haven t had the carrot empanadas in awhile and it s a shame because they are unique and tasty  I hope they will make them again soon.   This is the only food truck that will make my quesadillas on corn tortilla instead of flour. Those that work there are accommodating  and very sweet.  What I order the most are the veggie quesadillas on corn tortilla with lettuce  avocado  and lime.   I think my only complaint is that my boyfriend and I haven t really been able to figure out their hours. We ve driven by a handful of times with the intention of ordering meals  only to find that they were closed.
Tacos Juanita,16,Seriously legit food. Best lengua I ve ever had after 5 years in Texas.  Grabbed a quesadilla because I wanted something that I knew would fill me up. Perfectly fried tortilla and the lengua is absolutely incredible. Texture is on point  exactly like homemade lengua  and the seasoning is perfect.  I can t vouch for anything besides the lengua but I wouldn t imagine anything else on the menu wouldn t be well worth the price.
Tacos Juanita,17,Better then any tacos Iv had in austin as of right now   I m outside right now and had to leave a GOOD review  Taste is great  juicy  I had the beef fajita  Definitely get it as is 
Tacos Juanita,18,Extremley irritated that I stressed multiple times for no cilantro  and I still get cilantro. Not cool at all.
Tacos Juanita,19,In the top 2 best tacos on the East side. Definitely best on 6th street. The people that work there are super nice and their food is so good. I m always down for a campechano taco or 3. Breakfast tacos are also on point. I m a bartender on the east side and eat here all the time. If this is where your bartender eats  you should probably eat here too. We know what s up.
Taqueria El Picante,1,We actually went to the  1 location just to clarify.  They clearly attract a loyal customer base  and it s clear why  because they serve some absolutely amazing food. Their carnitas are amazing as is the pork in the el pastor tacos which are served in homemade corn tortillas with some hot ass salsas. So thrilled to have such a wonderful place so close to home.
Taqueria El Picante,2,They ve opened a second food truck on the corner of 45th and Duval right on the corner of the Hyde Park Market. The food is delicious. I ordered a carnitas plate which comes with Mexican rice and refried beans. I ate everything including the three homemade corn tortillas. The carnitas were cooked to perfection and they charred them a little bit more on the flattop. It also came with two salsas. The red is the spicier of the two with a very good smokey kick. My favorite was the green salsa which was a avocado and green chili based. Just enough kick to wake your senses up. I m glad to have a taco truck within walking distance and excited to try more of their menu. They also have breakfast tacos.
Taqueria El Picante,3,Incredible tacos  kind people and amazing value. Their taco truck in Hyde park Taqueria El Picante  2 is also always on point.
Taqueria El Picante,4,I used to come here every day before I moved out of town. Every time I crave tacos  I miss this place. Best taco truck in Austin. I m coming to town today  so I LL SEE YOU SOON  Pro tip  don t be scared  try the lengua  it s unreal
Taqueria El Picante,5,This is my favorite taco truck  I know there are a lot of great spots in the area and this one should be added to the list. It is consistent  quick  delicious  and has good prices. My go-to order for lunch is chicken tacos with sliced radishes and limes on the side  plus grilled onions and jalape os. So so good. For breakfast  it s all about the chorizo  potato  egg and cheese for me. Both the red and green salsas are excellent but be sure to toe-step in because they bring the heat 
Taqueria El Picante,6,Went back for a second visit. It takes some planning for dinner since they stop taking takeout orders by around 5 30 but it s more than worth it  especially for the price. Got the carnitas again with the campechano and tripa this time and they maybe matched or outshone it. The tripa is a bit on the chewy side but the flavor is tremendous. The orange  habanero   salsa is quite spicy for a taqueria salsa  the verde is still my fav.
Ram Indimex foods,1,Update  Ram Indimex is now called Mousam Spice House  just fyi 
Ram Indimex foods,2,I learned so much during my delightful time at the Ram Indimex truck. Radhey is so hospitable and accommodating  and happy to speak about this recent business venture with his uncle  Thapa  It s truly a family business  being named after Ram  Radhey s grandpa  They even hope to open up the Ram foundation and do some good if the business goes well.  Radhey shared some of his story with my friend and I  and I learned that Thapa has 7 years of experience crafting mouthwatering Indian dishes in NYC which he now brings to Austin  Texas. It definitely showed  We had creamy Chicken Tikka Masala - perfectly paired with garlic naan  samosas  gulab jamun  and 2 mango lassis. The food was beyond satisfying and Radhey continued to serve us by tying a trash bag to the outdoor table for us  getting us extra utensils  and offering to supply extra plates    Go check out the awesome food  and better yet  ask to hear some of the story behind the stove.
Ram Indimex foods,3,This food truck has only been open a month and it s already both our favorite place to eat in the neighborhood and our favorite Indian food in Austin. The menu isn t big  but every single thing we ve had has been amazing. The ingredients are so fresh  especially the hot peppers   it s done fast  and it s surprisingly cheap. The tortillas are delicious  all the tacos are flavorful and satisfying  and the biryani was stellar. Right now the truck is kind of hidden behind a gas station  but it s worth finding. Highly recommend 
Ram Indimex foods,4,Ordered on Uber Eats and I got the chow mein  tacos  garlic naan  palak paneer curry  and samosas. I was blown away  This is one of the best restaurants I ve had in a long time. Everything was fresh and presentation was nice. I will be ordering here again and will definitely be paying the truck a visit. I m an instant fan.
Ram Indimex foods,5,Very yummy chicken tikka masala  and  french fry creamy  is a delicious innovation
Taqueria Don-Emilio,1,Best breaky tacos in all of Austin TX  I get 4-6 every weekend day and they get better every single time. The location at Gunter and Airport blvd has a shave ice truck run by the same family rt next door. Do not sleep on Don Emilio.
Taqueria Don-Emilio,2,Solid tacos.   Takes a minute  but worth it. Still faster than Vera Cruz.  It s definitely a plus that Live Oak market is right there. Go grab a heady soda and chocolate bar while you wait.
Taqueria Don-Emilio,3,This Taco stand is the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a    The tacos are fresh  delicious and made to order  The owner and his wife who make the tacos are friendly and kind 
Taqueria Don-Emilio,4,Excellent and friendly service from this family owned business  as well as delicious tacos made to order at a very reasonable price. Call ahead and go get something from Strange Brew while you wait for the goodness 
Taqueria Don-Emilio,5,They make some damn good breakfast tacos here.  1.50 per taco  That s it  Try the Papa Ranchera and you won t be disappointed. The salsa is amazing as well  but be careful with the red one. I like my food spicy  but it caught me off guard and packs a punch for sure. I highly recommend eating here 
Taqueria Don-Emilio,6,I was sad to see that they had moved.  Well I just found them again.  They are still on Manchaca but further south near Stassney.  They are parked in the lot of the store where Full English is located this is also near Strange Brew.
Taqueria Don-Emilio,7,Stopped by today on a whim and in a rush  had 1 al pastor and 1 beef fajita  they were hot  TASTY  loaded w  plenty of meat  the fajitas were actually marinated and tender  the salsas nice and spicy  and service was fast and friendly. Waaaaay better than the other taco stand half a block down  Michoac n I think it was called .  Cons  Not much of a variety for non breakfast tacos and closes so early. And to be nitpicky I m used to 50 cent tacos in Mexico so  2.00 felt steep especially for my appetite. On a normal day I would have had 5 or 6.
Taqueria Don-Emilio,8,One of the few taco trailers in Austin that sells tacos at a reasonable price. Pop into the convenience store to get a beverage while you wait a couple minutes for your fresh tacos. Take a seat at the picnic table under the shade tent and enjoy a great South Austin establishment 
Taqueria Don-Emilio,9,Went here to get some tacos for my daughter and I before I dropped her at her bus stop. The owner was working the truck and was incredibly rude. So rude that I canceled my order and went into the convenience store to get something instead. The convenience store owner informed me that he has heard often that the owner is rude. I ve heard the breakfast tacos are amazing-unfortunately I ll never know due to the owners terrible customer service skills.
Taqueria Don-Emilio,10,Best breakfast tacos in SW Austin  Don Emilio s takes some time so call ahead  but the order is always fresh.
Mi Cabana,1,Delicious breakfast   My favorite part of traveling is finding places off the beaten path.  We were in Austin for the Grand Prix and looking for breakfast in the vicinity of our hotel.  I found this place near the Marriott complex on Yelp.  Another Yelp victory  Great food  great service  basic but scrupulously clean restaurant.  This place appears to be somewhat new - but I would expect it to continue to be highly rated as it racks up more reviews.  We had the Huevos Mexicanos and the Migas - both were delicious   Served with perfectly fried potatoes  not at all greasy   and refried beans. The freshly made corn tortillas were fantastic.  It was a filling breakfast at a very cheap price  The menu was extensive  with color photos of each dish.  The lunch dinner options looked great too 
Mi Cabana,2,First time visit for a late lunch  jonesing for Cabrito since El Gallo closed.  Strange building looks like an old Weinerschnitzel. Quite clean and we had the place to ourselves.  The menu is a see and point variety with a photo for each dish  so many colorful pages   We started with fajita nachos that were the highlight of the meal. A minute later our entrees arrived  way too soon.  The Cabrito was a nice portion but was much more mature than Cabrito. I have no problem with goat but Cabrito is much more tender and succulent.  The other dish of cheese relleno and beef enchiladas was hit and miss. The enchiladas hit but the relleno missed like so many others.  Rice  beans and salsa we are all fine  nachos very good  but not exactly jonesing to return for the relleno and goat.
Mi Cabana,3,Brand new restaurant in town right next to the days inn off of IH 35 and HWY 71. First of all the menus is 6or7 pages of food. They serve everything from traditional Mexican to your basic Tex-Mex and some traditional American favorites. The wait staff are very friendly and ready to serve you. Very fresh salsa and homemade chips to go along with delicious entrees.  We had breakfast there and would like to go back and try the lunch or dinner menu sometime. Check it out if you would like a new place to eat  I think you will like it.
Mi Cabana,4,Authentic delicious Mexican food. The corn tortillas are house made and so are the flour.  The plates are served well and it is very affordable for the quality.  Don t let the exterior of this place fool you.  The food is great 
Mi Cabana,5,I believe this is a change of name. Now Catedral de Mariscos. Try the Raise the Dead Seafood soup.
Mi Cabana,6,Ate there recently and the food was excellent.  Had the migas plate  good size portions  it came with home fries and refried beans.  the beans were good and thick.  sometimes restaurants thin the beans down with water to stretch them on weekends.  the tortillas seemed home made.  The service was just okay though  but I m not looking for five star service at hole-in-the-wall places.  I ll def be back for breakfast and will try happy hour-dinner sometime.
Mi Cabana,7,Very authentic Mexican food. Spicy salsa but very tasty. Glad they had pic. The guacamole was excellent and huge portion for 5 dollars. It s not fancy but if your looking for real Mexican food and yummy this is the place to try. It s close to the airport area and near a lot of hotels and a business park
Mi Cabana,8,This place has a plethora of flavorful options.  As it is often uncrowded  it is easy to get a seat and food comes rather quickly. Big fan of the mole. Hidden gem around the intersection of 35 and Ben White.
Mi Cabana,9,Huge menu  very authentic. We went for breakfast and had the Migas  and an El Aztecs plate  scrambled eggs with a green chile sauce . Superb  Service was great too  coffee was diner-style average  but obviously you re not coming here for the coffee...
Mi Cabana,10,I shouldn t be surprised it was horrible since I was the only person eating there at 7 00 pm.  Carne Assad was as thin as pre-cooked bacon served at a cheap hotels free breakfast.  Really. It really was.
Mi Cabana,11,We came for breakfast and it was really good. My husband and I ordered from their Mexican menu and my kids ordered from the American menu. Prices are reasonable  but I must highly recommend their  Aguas frescas ....my kids had the cucumber water and the melon water.  I liked that they seemed to be homemade or natural not from powdered mixes.
Mi Cabana,12,Authentic Mexican restaurant above my expectations. Great service too. Speak proper English. Price is reasonable too.
Mi Cabana,13,This was THE worst food I ve ever had  amp  I m Hispanic   The food was dripping in grease  amp  they used fake process cheese food. The waitress was extremely rude because I didn t speak Spanish and over charged my sweet little mama out of spite. I am so disgusted that we even stayed 
Mi Cabana,14,The waiter   cashier very rude  impatient and stubborn guy...  So I ordered enchiladas suizas to go...   OMG worst enchiladas I have ever had  they didn t put melted cheesed on them like they are supposed to be  it was a nasty mix of cream and maybe green salsa  Something green with avovado slices on top. The taste was BAD .. The chicken was red like cooked with red Chiles or something but didn t tasted good either... It was a to go order so I was in my hotel when I tried them... I asked for an extra enchilada when I placed the order cause I intended to share the plate with my kid but they didn t added it to the plate  they forgot to put it but they charged me  2.00 for it. So I called and a guy named Esteban agreed to give me something else next morning. Next day I went and Esteban wasn t there but the rude guy was and I explained what happened and instead of apologize  he was just asking why I didn t called HIM and I was like  I called the restaurant phone and Esteban answered I don t know your name. Then he wanted to give me an enchilada and I declined  I needed the enchilada a night before not now... So I took a couple cookies for the  2 bucks and left. Never going back to that place.
Mi Cabana,15,Best authentic Mexican food  everything fresh. The shrimp we cooked to perfection. Nothing from a can here.
Mi Cabana,16,Great service  awesome suggestions and unbeatable beer prices. So glad I stumbled upon this little taste of Mexico
Mi Cabana,17,Came in from out of town. My family and I were very hungry and wanted to try something we don t have where we re from. They took 10 mins to get our drink order. Once they finally brought our drinks we gave them our order. Took another 50 mins to get our food. Once we got the food there was a lack of flavor on the tacos and they were very greasy. They told us they were slammed with people but it looked like there was about 4 tables. there was no apology just excuses for why they took so long to bring us our food.
Mi Cabana,18,Not a good experience  the chips they brought us were just bits and pieces... The taco shells were so stale they were inedible... And to top it off near the end of our meal they mopped the floor right next to our table and the smell of the chemical cleaner killed what was left of our appetite.
Mi Cabana,19,I dined there for the first time yesterday.  The food was excellent   which made up for the terrible service. I will definitely get food from there again. Takeout   
Mi Cabana,20,homemade corn  credible machacado...nice potatoes  will have to go back and check other items ....extensive menu
Buddy's Mexican Grill,1,Kens Taco on Rundberg Cameron used to be my staple for Breakfast Tacos  but I hate parking there so I came to Buddy s...ordered Egg Sausage   Pico and Egg Bacon   Pico thru drive thru came under  5.    Superior Breakfast Tacos to Kens.   Pico is incredibly fresh for fast food and the meats were excellent as well.   Buddy s Burgers and now Mexican Grill is non-pretentious non-hipster awesome place for FOOD.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,2,Waited an hour for my food only to be told they cancelled my order. Ridiculous. Don t take orders if you can t fulfill them.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,3,I recently have been back here a few times for breakfast and lunch  usually using the drive-through .  The breakfast tacos do not scrimp on the scrambled eggs and are solid.  I personally like the egg and chorizo.  At most places  I will order three breakfast tacos but at Buddy s I get two  they are huge.  On the last visit  I ordered a  chicken burrito with everything.   It was awesome  the chicken was cooked perfectly  the ingredients all blended well and the seasoning and salsa were delicious.  This update is well deserved  this place is solid for fast Mexican food.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,4,Got another bowl because it was delicious the first time  Still 10 10 recommend Buddy s to anyone
Buddy's Mexican Grill,5,Leave your inner Yuppie at the door here.  Imagine you work on a paint crew.  Besides you  the truck has your supervisor and two other painters.  You have half an hour for lunch.  If this is your life  Buddy s Mexican Grill is terrific.        Buddy s is a Mexican cafeteria that takes up one third of a giant convenience store at the corner of Cameron and Ferguson.  Buddy s is about value.  Prices are low.  The food is great for what you paid.  The servings are large.  They get you your food fast.  Food is served on an assembly line basis. You walk down the line having the staff add the ingredients you want. You get your lunch within ninety seconds of arrival.  They have standard ingredients that they can give you in a bowl  in a taco  in a burrito  on a quesadilla or in a salad.  The barbacoa is homemade. It is very good.  They have homemade tofu and veggies if you are feeling healthy.  Everything else is standard but fully acceptable.  I had a massive bowl of barbacoa  rice  beans and vegetables that fed me well for the rest of the day.  My wallet barely noticed anything was missing.          And if you are on the paint crew  take note.  The convenience store has a first run collection of energy drinks.  With all of that good Mexican food    You might want to take a well deserved nap after lunch.  Have a Kick Start or Monster as your lunch time beverage   And you won t even think of taking a nap.  After you paint five times as much as the rest of your team   You are looking at becoming supervisor  or maybe even  owner.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,6,This new place happens to be down the road from where I work and that is good news for me.  I stopped by today for a quick bite to bring back to work.  Yes  this is inside of a gas station convenience store but its a really nice store and the restaurant is set apart from the store with a very clean and large seating area. When you walk up to the counter you see all the amazing choices of food they have to offer. It all looks so fresh and delicious.  I was greeted warmly by a young woman who I gave my order to  as I was not that hungry I just wanted to try their Green Chili queso and chips. She asked if I would like to try any samples and I replied not today but I would like to bring my husband back to try.  I took my chips and queso to work to enjoy my lunch. All in all it was decent queso - not the best but definitely not the worse. I would like to go back and try those amazing meats they have  it all looked so fresh and yummy.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,7,This review is for the salad   bowl options only  since I haven t had anything else. For about  7  you can get a really big salad with a ton of flavor  including roasted fajita veggies  beans  cheese  etc. It s big enough to feed two hungry people. They even have a delicious tofu option if you want to keep it completely vegetarian. For a quick  healthy  cheap meal  this is a great option.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,8,I can not recommend this place the one and only time I ordered food from here  everytthing was canned and had been sitting in the warming trays for so long there was a film on my refried beans and I got so sick after eating I was hospitalized for several days. Definately worth skipping this place and treat your taste buds to mexican food froma place that makes real food for real people. I only tried this place because it was alte and I was hungry and wanted something fast. Taco Bell is better
Buddy's Mexican Grill,9,Wow. Was not expecting this from a gas station plaza. So delicious. Very authentic. Huge portion. Staff very helpful and friendly.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,10,I feel so bad  I lived in San Antonio for over a decade so I know all about Tex mex. Well I ordered a bean and cheese taco only   My favorite food ever  well the beans were literally unsalted pinto beans...no refried  and they used white cheese  It was bland  I feel bad I want all businesses to succeed  but even taco cabana has seasoning  
Buddy's Mexican Grill,11,Food is a 5 but price is a 3 so that s why they earned a solid 4. Burritos and burrito bowls are amazing. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than Chipoople. I definitely reccomend stopping by and grabbing some great tasting food.   On another note their Texas jalapeno green sauce is fire   
Buddy's Mexican Grill,12,Regardless if it s a gas station or not  I expect at the very least flavor from any type of Mexican restaurant grill. I ve only ever had their bowls  which are similar to the line-up at chipotle but about 1 2 the flavor. They also don t have any limes...  Mind blown. The one thing I do really enjoy is the jalape o sauce. Maybe the breakfast burritos are better ... You are better off going to a real taqueria up the street if you re in the area and you ll end up spending less money for better food.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,13,Not the best tacos for me. The cheese I asked for was white I like white cheese but that one wasn t the best . I order 2 carne gui the meat was larger pieces and still needed a bit more cooking. This is all my opinion don t knock it till you try it  best of luck  And that your experience is better then mines.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,14,My staff have gotten food poisoning from this place TWICE. We ve tried to give them the benefit of the doubt...but stats don t lie  The breakfast tacos are sure to give you butt pee and they don t honor the sign for lunch starting at 10am. Whatever you do... DO NOT ORDER BREAKFAST TACOS UNLESS YOU RE CONSTIPATED AND NEED A GOOD CLEAN OUT FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS  GROSS    
Buddy's Mexican Grill,15,Best burritos and the lady s that work there are always super friendly. The drive through is always super fast and easy 
Buddy's Mexican Grill,16,Thisplace is supposed to be 24 hours now  which I thought was awesome since its down the road from work where many of us work NIGHT SHIFT  which  could  bring in a lot of business  but not from me now. Read on to see why.   You are 24 hours. You advertise as being 24 hours. The two times that I ve stopped here  YOUR DOORS HAVE BEEN LOCKED.   This time  I decided to get the attention of someone inside. He unlocks the doors  and I go inside. I ask why the doors are locked if you are 24 hours. Instead of apologizing  he gives EXCUSES. Not once  not twice  but THREE times. Then  on top of that he says it s to keep the homeless out  SO  you want to be 24 hours  but also want to willingly admit to discrimination against customers  Oh  that s great    Then  I try to get coffee. A supposed  wide selection . Nope. The one I wanted had no coffee. I was then pointed to the one PLAIN one available. Was not apologized to  was not offered to brew it  just pointed at like I was a damn dog or something  He couldn t even be bothered to step out from behind the counter  I left without purchasing anything. I don t want to give my business to such a place    Worst experience ever. If you are going to accommodate night shifts  then ACCOMODATE NIGHT SHIFTS   This is how you lose business. TAKE THE HINT.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,17,I go to Buddy s at least once a week... whether it be for gas  snacks  or lunch at the Mexican grill inside of the gas station. I work near here and was so excited to have a place to grab food at  since we don t have many options around here .   Buddy s Mexican grill is kind of like a Chipotle. Everything is fresh and cooked in their open kitchen. You can order tacos  burritos  salads  or a bowl. They have similar meat options to Chipotle and even have tofu. The employees do not skimp on the scoops. They want you to be full  happy  and satisfied  And I am all three of those every time I eat here.  The employees are nice and they smile and ask how you are doing. I appreciate friendly faces. This gas station is clean  large  and convenient for me to get in and out of. I m very glad Buddy s is around 
Buddy's Mexican Grill,18,So you first tell me that you need to make the pico and guacamole... but then decide you re out... not very impressive
Buddy's Mexican Grill,19,If you ever have the displeasure to work or live in this part of town  then ya might as well try Buddy s at least once. Honestly the food is cheap and portions are large and let s be honest  there s literally no where else to go  4 stars bc it s the only option out here lol
Buddy's Mexican Grill,20,Excellent  Fresh ingredients in a Chipotle-style buffet where you can build your own burrito or burrito bowl. Will definitely come back.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,21,Very plain and overpriced Tex-Mex. if you re desperate for so-so food at high prices  then give it a try 
Buddy's Mexican Grill,22,I don t ever  EVER write online reviews  but I ve ordered from this place several times off of Uber Eats for breakfast and I feel the need to warn other Austinites. This place is basic AF. When ordering sausage on a breakfast taco they cook a circular patty and cut it in half. It takes literal seconds to chop the sausage up so that it integrates better with the taco  but that s apparently too much work. I ordered  sausage  and cheese tacos  there was no cheese. Or  if there was  it was so little that I could not taste it. I ordered potatoes added to my tacos  they were bland  dry  and tasteless. I ordered a sausage and cheese kolache  I got a mild hot dog wrapped in a store bought croissant. After a few unsatisfactory orders several months back I decided to give this place one more shot  but nothing had changed. Bland  overcooked  lifeless food. You could get better LITERALLY ANYWHERE.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,23,It s like a Chipotle that is personally owned. I m working right down the street now  and hit it up twice a week. It may be the heart of lunch  but they do have a drive through. It s all been good  but after 2 00 pm it sort of gets cold.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,24,Buddy s Mexican Grill is great. I come about twice a week to eat  The service is very fast and the staff is very friendly and the food is made fresh everyday  It s a great place to come during your lunch hour.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,25,Ordered through GrubHub never heard of this place before and was very happy with my order  2 steak burritos and chips with salsa. The red salsa is absolutely amazing on the burritos and the meat was cooked perfectly. The price was very reasonable as well We will definitely be ordering again 
Buddy's Mexican Grill,26,Legit breakfast tacos and kolaches. Regardless of the  inside-a-gas-station  set-up  they serve quality grub for breakfast and lunch. The grab and go tacos and kolaches are huge time savers in the morning.
Buddy's Mexican Grill,27,A line from a joe Pesci move.  They mess you up at the drive thru. I won t put in the swearword. Seriously how do you make a taco and not put the meat in    And seriously why would anybody put tofu in a burrito  I either got someone else s order or the girl needs to go back to drive thru 101.  She wasn t even friendly or personable she just had this crabby look on her face.  I could overlook if she was old LOL but she was a young one
Buddy's Mexican Grill,28,Nice because it s close to where I work  we have 0 options  If I could make it better I would improve the chicken- mystery pieces in my bowl are a turn off.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,1,So I waa needing to do laundry a couple of doors down from this place and I decided to check it out for a fruit cup snack. I was pleasantly surprised to see that their menu included some savory items as well  so I decided to also try their Cuban torta. It was a good decision    They had a variety of different fruit cups  but I went with the first one they had on the menu. It had watermelon  shaved coconut  mango  cantaloupe  grapes  strawberries  jicama and cucumber.I told her to add chili to it. So darn good  My mouth is watering as I type    I guess I m going again today    The torta was delicious as well. I thought it was a littleon the small site for a torta  but once I opened it it looked like it was basically just wrapped tightly which shrank it a bit  LOL The bread was toasty and truly stood out with great flavor in every bite  The way it should be. That s why it s super important to always have fresh bread for these babies  This place is doing it right  Comes with a small green salsa.  They have their own condiment add on station in case you re interested in more chili  chamoy  ir lime juice in your snacks  Try them out 
Crazy Fruits Riverside,2,Love this place   The fruit is fresh and they take care to make each piece is coated in Chile and lime. I like jicama and cucumber so I decided it was ok to order in my fruit cup. That was a big mistake on my part. The flavors differ so much from the sweetness of the fruit that I didn t like it in my fruit cup. I will omit it the next time I go there. The place is clean and colorful. I also ordered the chicken flautas. They were made fresh and served with a small side salad of lettuce  tomatoes and avocado along with two small containers of green salsa and a container of sour cream. The tomatoes in the salad were not fresh so I didn t eat the salad. Staff was not overly friendly  but they were polite. I will return  And if you haven t been there  you should go.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,3,Fresh Fruits are the ultimate snack. Love their Hospitality and their mangonadas are delicious.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,4,The Service Here Is So Bad They Give You Attitude When You Clearly Explain What You Want On A Specific Item Or Don t Want On It . They Older Overweight Lady Blond Hair Can t Hear You Correct She Got Upset After You Try To Tell Her She Made A Mistake And If They Could Pls Fix It . JUST HORRIBLY Ugly Attitude They Give You . And I m Hispanic To They Think They Are Better Than Anyone
Crazy Fruits Riverside,5,I just paid  6 for the shittiest mangonada on the face of the earth. It had like 5 pieces of mango and tasted like off brand Jumex. Based on the girl s excessively dour look  I should have seen this coming. I feel personally insulted to have been served this. This place blows  0 stars  go to Elotes Fanny  I love you Elotes Fanny.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,6,Love everything here   From the fresh food you order to the frozen treats  Try this place
Crazy Fruits Riverside,7,If you re looking for truly authentic Mexican food and dessert - I recommend coming here. I got the Cubana Torta  beef  ham  sausage  and cheese  and it was pretty good. They taste just like the ones I ve gotten in Mexico. I also got an Elote  corn in a cup  which was very cheesy and creamy - so good  If you aren t wanting food - they also have a good selection of fruit to choose from with tons of toppings  cream  hot sauce  chile lemon  etc. Had a good experience here and will come back 
Crazy Fruits Riverside,8,The food is actually disgusting the way the burritos are put together is just gross and the way they put their meat and season the chicken  the only decent thing they have is their aguas frescas and elotes. Other than that the food doesn t taste fresh.  and the meat is absolutely gross you can t even bite through
Crazy Fruits Riverside,9,In case you weren t sure  the crazy lights around the door welcome you in. Great place to grab traditional Mexican fruit treats. Of course  both my kids went for straight ice cream  in crazy colors of course . My husband and I were tempted by the mangonada but were too full to get one. Service was good. I wish it had a palateria selection  but those aren t always combined.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,10,Fruit was not so fresh ripe. Selection of fruit was mediocre. Customer service was eh... they couldn t understand me  amp  Vice versa. They seemed frustrated with me. Probably won t return nor recommend
Crazy Fruits Riverside,11,We just left your location and you made the wrong drink just for you to tell us that we need to pay extra for your fuck up. Definitely not coming back. We ve only been here twice and the first time the ladies that were working there were great but the manager of the store just made us not want to come back. He told us to take it or leave it or pay. What kind of business is that where they make their customers pay extra for their mess up  Can t wait to see you close down a year from now. Also never had to write a review for anything till now  thanks for being the first 1 star review in my life  you ll always be remembered as such.  Update  Found a sharp pointed object in their strawberries n cream drink. Do not buy from here in risk of bad and dangerous business practices  it s most likely unsanitary as well.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,12,My boyfriend  amp  I visited for a dessert night out tonight  this is definitely one of our new favorites   The service was friendly and the kitchen seemed very clean. Our drinks came out immediately and were to die for  absolutely wonderful    The fruits were fresh and the flavors were perfect  we will be back to try the rest of the menu.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,13,We bought a Groupon to randomly try a new local place. Crazy Fruits is in a new looking strip mall within the super ghetto Far East side. The store itself is clean and well put together with generally friendly employees.  We got a burrito and quesadilla. There was nothing technically wrong with our food  other than my browning little pile of lettuce and lack of pico de gallo  but it was far from special. Like maybe on a Taco Cabana level and I think that s a stretch. This joint is clearly in the business of putting food in your belly without a ton of concern over how tasty it is.   In a pinch I would try them again for the fruit cups or maybe a dessert of some kind.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,14,Before Crazy Fruits  I hated mangonadas and chamoy. Holy moly I m glad someone brought me some to try  otherwise I would not have tried this insane place.   I ve now had the mangonada on countless occasions  the elotes  the crazy fruits  and the craziest concoction possible  the Dorilokos. If you get the mangonada  make sure you let the flavors meld together before you suck down the entire cup. The elotes was exceptional as was the fresh crazy fruits. The highlight here though has to be the Dorilokos. I have had walking tacos in the Midwest but never have I seen someone mix all these random ingredients together and make it taste so good. It also has the insane benefit of making my stomach hate me pretty instantly.   I think I want to try the food here next time. If I can ever get past the snacks and desserts.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,15,Great elite  Clean environment.  Staff is very pleasant. Definitely a hidden treasure.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,16,I think this restaurant would be better served with a name change. That being said  Groupon led us to this restaurant for lunch today. I ordered the fajita burrito and an  elote compuesto  cup  Mexican corn concoction . The burrito was nothing special and the refried beans were not hot and had a  straight from the can  taste. The fajitas were flavorless and I got a chunk of chewy gristle.   The corn fared a little better. It was piping hot and their hot sauces were on point. That being said  there are far  far better Tex-Mex restaurants out there. I can t speak to the fruit or smoothies since I did not partake  but the savory foods we ate were not good enough to entice me to make the trek to this east Riverside eatery again.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,17,So I got the Groupon and went to crazy fruits. The place is new. The interior looks new and fresh. The first time I visited  I had a burrito and an  all crazy fruits  which is a bunch of different fruits with a smidge of mexican fruit spice. The second time I had a burrito and a strawberries n cream  the  cream  being a pink yogurt like substance that was thinner in consistency and very sweet.   The food was prepared fast. The fruit was fresh. I will be returning here soon  They have some ice cream and othersuch things.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,18,Great selections of fruits and snacks. Sour Cheetos were delicious. I really just love the fresh fruit with chili and chamoy.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,19,Great elote  You get a 12oz for 3.50 which is a lot cheaper than I ve had other places. The decor is very cute 
Crazy Fruits Riverside,20,Overpriced bad food. Lady at register was not happy to help us order. She got our order wrong. The prep ladies on the back were talking about how picky I was  thinking I wasn t understanding their Spanish. All I asked was for no Valentina - bc to me it doesn t make sense to mix it with chamoy.
Crazy Fruits Riverside,21,Amazing little joint  Stopped by for a fruit cup on a Kolache run and I m quite amazed at their menu selection  from fruits and desserts to tortas and elotes 
Crazy Fruits Riverside,22,I had a bad experience there lady took my order after telling her please no chicharrons on my meal it s like they still put them on my meal so I complained to manager and he told me sir we prepare meals the way they are on the menu real rude and then in front of me gets mad at the lady who took my order that she had made three mistakes with orders for the day very unprofessional and then the people preparing my meal were not wearing gloves and no hair nets I mean just disgusting I mean I will not be going back to that restaurant.then just because I made a complaint the owner basically tells me okay sir I will not be preparing your meal over and over so make up your mind I mean what ever happen to the customer is always right
Crazy Fruits Riverside,23,This place is my new favorite thing. Crazy Fruits is my life force. Omg. So many great options  fresh fruit  delicious desserts--incredible. 10 10. Please support this great local business  
Crazy Fruits Riverside,24,Great Food  Great Service   had delicious fruit on a cup with lime and chile.
Taco Cabana,1,6 trips through the drive through 6 wrong orders. Drove through today  was loud and clearly spoken. When the order showed wrong on the screen  I just drove off and down the street for Tacos. All done with this location. Never again.
Taco Cabana,2,Even as a foodie who likes to try local Austin spots I still have my fast food fast casual restaurant cravings and recently I tried out a spot I surprisingly haven t been before  Taco Cabana   I got their   - Cabana Bowl  as I got this it occurred to me that I had yet to ever buy a taco bowl in Austin. You don t find these very often and this one was pretty good. The taco bowl shell has a different texture than you d expect. It s not as thick and crispy like a nacho  but more of a light thin crispy texture you d get from a puffy taco for example. This one surprised me.   5.79   - Cabana Salad  anytime I go to a build-your-own burrito bowl spot  I usually do salad bowls anyway and if I can find a spot that s more affordable than the other guys than you ll catch my attention and that s what was done here. They have a specialty Salsa Ranch which combines the best of both worlds to give you a tomatoey-buttermilk combo that is worth the try.   4.69 without meat or  7.19 with chicken   - Chips  amp  Queso  I m a sucker for some chips and queso. You get a more than generous amount here for just  2.99. Pro-tip  get this and put it in a bowl or salad for an extra kick of creamy  cheesy flavor   - Margaritas  y all I had no clue until now  but they sell margs for  2 each  I said   hell yeah  and got two of em  mango and strawberry. These make a good time into a great time   In conclusion  if you re in need of something good to eat that s quick and affordable then you can t go wrong here. I personally give a 3.5 5 for a good first experience  but just given the quality of ingredients I don t think they re 4 5 material but they re still decent 
Taco Cabana,3,Ordering take out or delivery from here is a gamble. Check your bag  Then check it twice  I have NEVER EVER received a correct order from this establishment. One time I ordered a watermelon margarita  flautas  a taco bowl  and a quesadilla.  Meals plentiful for two    They instead gave me 2 cheese enchiladas and a couple of containers of rice. And no  it was not an order mix up. It was just plain wrong 
Taco Cabana,4,On Tuesday 4 5 22 it is understaffed and training is going on as well . Had no margaritas apparently and I received nachos with no sour cream or lettuce just beef and bean   and my coworkers quesadilla was skimpy . Never have I seen this at taco cabana
Taco Cabana,5,With out doubt the worst Taco Cabana ever.   They have nothing out and available to guests because they are afraid the homeless will come in and take it I guess.   Taco Cabana is no gourmet restaurant but this is terrible.   I ordered shredded chicken enchiladas and the taste is okay but it came out as just a jumbled mess on a plate.   They don t even have napkins out for guests you have to go to the counter and wait for them.   I do not recommend this location at all.
Taco Cabana,6,Look.. I get this is fast food so my expectations aren t high but this place hits a new low even.  Like to grab a few tacos and some to go margaritas on a Friday night with many places closed with COVID.  Have been here multiple times and each time seems to get worse.  They don t know their own menu - asked for menu item they told me didn t exist despite it being on their sign and website  couldn t use my reward dollars because they didn t know how to work  wrong order last two times.    Cheap - yes   Margaritas to go - yes   Worth the hassle - nah.  Go elsewhere if even to another location.
Taco Cabana,7,Second time in one week via Uber Eats our order was wrong but receipt was correct. Tonight  we received all meat items instead of the Beyond Meat combos  missed a few items. I called the restaurant and try to find out why. A lady answered sternly and said they were closed. I got her attention to tell her about our order  she did not care. She said if they are out of an item  the replace it. I explained that does not work and we now have no dinner to eat. She got very angry and our discussion got heated to which she called me a bitch before I hung up on her screaming at me. No more Taco Cabana every for us. I don t recall her name but she was closing the store on 7 24 2021 at Riverside.
Taco Cabana,8,First time visiting Taco Cabana  just know it s a must visit whenever you re in Austin  Texas   Steak quesadilla was delicious  Great nachos  Huge servings   Green apple margaritas delicious
Taco Cabana,9,Their shredded chicken tacos were FIREEEEEEE BRUH. I regret not ordering more than 2.
Taco Cabana,10,This is consistently the worse Taco Cabana TC and I will no longer be coming back. I have had problems every time I came to this location. Either they got my order wrong  forgot to give me an item  food was cold  didn t give salsa that was requested  and this last time their computers were down. Don t get me wrong I normally love TC but this location has done me wrong for the last time.  I have filled out several of the surveys that you get on the receipt in hopes of this location improving but it never has. Sorry TC but you you ve got to clean up you act before I ll return.
Taco Cabana,11,I ve been having lunch here for the past 4 years. I work nearby.  Although it s been hit or miss in the past because of staffing issues. For example I ve seen them run out of beef fajitas because of a large group and a full house  seen a manager walk out in frustration and I ve too waited for half an hour for a salad   They have been working at keeping a trained staff. Here lately they ve gotten my beef fajita salad spot on. You can t been the food for the price   See my awesome salad pic. Im giving them 3 stars for now but hopefully I can change that to a 4  
Taco Cabana,12,I ve lived near this Taco Cabana for over 4 years and I give it a chance randomly every now and then to see if they ve finally got their shit together  but it s always the same annoying experience.   They must be giving kids a chance to try working for the first time or something because nearly every time I order there  I get some brain-dead loon taking my order  and then have to wait 20-30 minutes  not an exaggeration  just to get to the damn window.   This location misses orders  doesn t pay attention  works extremely slow  doesn t care about the customers at all and just overall is NOT worth your time. If you want Mexican food  try the dozens of food trucks surrounding it  because it will be faster  a friendlier experience and wayy better tasting.   Shame on you Taco Cabana.
Taco Cabana,13,I could have sat down and had a meal for how long I had to wait in line.  I m done with taco cabana used to love them but this place sucks so bad tortillas were old and the tea tastes moldy   So sad
Taco Cabana,14,Very friendly.  Good value for your money.  I like the  choose your own  adders bar.  You can pick and choose what you want on your dish.  Rapid  friendly service and well maintained premises.  Been back many  many times 
Taco Cabana,15,Service is the down side of this place. I ve been here several times and can t remember ever getting exactly what I ordered. And asking to get what I wanted is only slightly more successful than making the initial order. While I m sitting here writing this  there have been two other separate customers complaining.  The attitude of the workers is just that -  it s work .  I can say this about Taco Cabana - the food is consistent  I like it  but about this particular Taco Cabana so is the poor service.
Taco Cabana,16,Didn t get the guy s name who was giving the directives to the other employees today  5 28 2020   he may be a manager supervisor of some sort  but he s heavy set  Latino  about five feet and seven inches  late 40s early 50s  short gray hair  with poor customer service skills  and zero professionalism. The way he rudely spoke to customers was surprising to me  as he was short and blatantly rude to one gentleman who was deciding what he wanted to order. When he got to me  I made mention of an item  and he mumbled something and started walking off. I walked right after him  cut him off from whatever he was planning to go do and told him what I wanted to order. He seemed a bit surprised  as if he wasn t expecting me to speak up  or walk him down and make sure he took my order. Guess he s use to being rude to customers  but he met the right one today. Also  the other employees were scrambling to get orders prepared  wrapped and packaged for customers that were in the drive-thru line  and this guy  the manager supervisor  was just talking to them like they were stupid  and clearly they all knew what they were doing as I could see people in the drive-thru were getting their orders as fast as possible. One of the employees he said something to  an older Hispanic lady  just shook her head in disgust after a brief interaction with him  and walked back to the area where she was working to finish preparing orders. Not sure what his problem is  and I don t care. I spent almost 11  years in the military  and I learned at a young age to keep home at home  and work at work. And to be make sure those that I m in charge of get things done  but I also ensure they have a respectful environment to work in. I now work in hospitality  and could never conceive of ever getting an attitude with colleagues  or customers who have nothing to do with whatever issue I have going on. I definitely won t be coming back to this place  and with the  new normal  coming about after this whole pandemic  that gentleman better be careful  or he may end finding himself amongst the 40  million unemployed in the U.S.
Taco Cabana,17,HORRIBLE   Food was sloppy. Girl with white headband plating it was complaining  amp  had a bad attitude. Then she mentioned she s  not messed up just doesn t feel good   Enchiladas hard as a rock  sauce slopped  all over the plate  everywhere except enchiladas  amp  it was like water. Crunchy taco was sitting in the sauce and completely soaked.   Dr pepper was flat.  BATHROOM a whole story on its own. Smelled like a sewer when I walked it. I could barely breathe. The. Noticed feces in  amp  on the toilet. Not flushed. It was so bad.  I ve been to Taco cabanas my whole life. So naturally before we left Austin we wanted to get it. Honestly it was so bad and the girl was so rude I ll prob never go back to one again.  My husband agrees.
Taco Cabana,18,Food is great for the price point. Far exceeds Taco Bell. As far as the customer service goes - GREAT. I didn t catch her name  but the young lady that rang me up  black  maybe 18-22 years old  beautiful thick braids  was so sweet and attentive. She was walking in right for her shift as I was placing my order and instead of going and clocking in  she intentionally walked to the computer to ring me up so I didn t have to wait - and did so with a smile. Made my trip a pleasant one.
Taco Cabana,19, 28. Long ass slow line. Old expired tasting food. If me or my kid get food poisoning  whoever manages this place and the food inventory is going to get a face to face.
Taco Cabana,20,This place sucks. The service is so slow if you come here fully expect to waste your time.
Taco Cabana,21,Avoid it.  This is their idea of a chicken fajita taco.  Consistently poor food and service.  Later evening choices may be limited on this street  but this is the worst.  I have periodically stopped by to see if it has changed since I m local  but I guess I m being idealistic.
Taco Cabana,22,All I can say is I m am very hopeful for this restaurant now that tameka is now gone. This restaurant has very high potential and now that there s new management I am eager to return and edit this review
Taco Cabana,23,Vegan way to become more friendlier..a little more less sweetener..b sweet everyday..thank you for taking the effort to read my review..
Taco Cabana,24,Worst one ever  takes forever in the drive through. Avoid it all cost. I ve been waiting in line for 30 minutes with 2 cars in front of me. Go someplace else.
Taco Cabana,25,I wrote a wonderful review on this Taco Cabana a couple of years ago. It was so positive that YELP thought it was too good to be true. They removed it because they thought I knew an employee or was asked to write a review. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE  I KNOW NO ONE AT THIS LOCATION OR ANY LOCATION.  Bottom line  it was the most friendly service I have received from any location of Taco Cabana.  Don t remove this one-_-
Taco Cabana,26,I just love pulling up to the drive thru and waiting at the menu to order. No one has said hello or I ll be right with you. It s been like five minutes and I m just sitting here waiting....I mean customer service should be to at least say hello how can I help you  Nope. It s just awkward and makes it seem like no one wants to help you. I mean if your 24 7 and it s only ten at night. I would think someone would at least be helpful and take your order. Guess not  
Taco Cabana,27,I was hungry for a late night snack  so I went to  this Taco Cabana around 10 00 on a friday night. After waiting at the drive thru for over 10 minutes I was asked finally what I would like to order no greeting. I was told that because they are getting ready for breakfast items I couldn t order anything else on the menu or anything grilled.   Mind you its 10 00  P.M on a friday night  In a place that boasts about being open 24 hours. After trying to find something else on the menu I could order and everything I said they could not make because  They were getting ready for breakfast .   The lady at the drive through window started getting a really rude attitude and was argumentative and not helpful at all. She could have even started the conversation with sorry we cant make you food at 10 pm  but nothing. Was just rude and made me wait for no reason what so ever.   The manager of this location obviously is pretty incompetent if they can t have food prepared like the rest of the locations. I have seen kid lemonade stands managed better than this place. They need to learn some customer service and respect for customers. Instead they allow their employees to be hostile and negative to patrons.  Don t eat here  save yourself the hassle. Totally incompetent and slow slow slow.
Taco Cabana,28,I don t think this location is capable of getting an order correct. Plus  they always seem understaffed and their manager should take a look at what is going on if they re trying to save on labor costs. It just makes you and your employees look lazy and like you don t care. Take some pride in yourselves for once. READ what the screen says and make it that way  What s so hard about that   Also these folks will close at random times so be warned. They have no reason other than they just don t want to deal with customers. They obviously hate us as customers at this location.
Taco Cabana,29,This TC location is a tricky to get into  but like all the other TCs the food is always good. I think someone was sleepy on this day.... Otherwise  I can dig a good fajita taco and margaritas from TC 
Taco Cabana,30,Just went through the drive through and some guy was making noises and saying the names of our meals weird. I really enjoyed it and hope he is paid a livable wage. Last time we went there they broke our card and I m headed to pterrys now but this guy deserves a 5 star review  so this is for him and based solely on this experience.
Taco Cabana,31,I was basically born and raised on taco cabana  a fast food staple in San Antonio. That sounds super douchey but it s a good preface for me to say that the soft chicken taco tastes and looks nothing like the original. It s bizarre. It s not bad... but crazy to me how two totally different items are being served up. The bean and cheese was served up so fat  I really can t complain. Especially since I feel like most TCs have been downsizing their tacos anyways. The drive thru guys were incredibly nice and upbeat and I got my tacos in a minute or less. The only reason for my three stars is that shredded chicken taco. What gives  
Taco Cabana,32,This has to be the worst taco cabana in Texas. Doesn t matter when you come. Day time  night time... Always out of something and always a 30 minute wait with some lame excuse or another. Don t even try to use the app. You still never get your food. Just go to the Ben White store and save yourself the headache.
Taco Cabana,33,I wish I could give this location 0 stars. Waited over 15 minutes for my food. Go find some authentic  better tasting Mexican food somewhere else.
Taco Cabana,34,This was our late night choice  and the woman said that they were closed. It s a 24hr establishment...how are you closed  But she didn t have an answer for that.
Taco Cabana,35,Have you ever spent 25 minutes waiting for food at a fast food restaurant  I have. Thanks Taco Cabana for lowering the already short bar for fast food service.   They say don t write reviews when you re angry  but I m not angry. I m more impressed that I stuck it out and didn t just waste the  10.
Taco Cabana,36,To begin my review lets start with welcome area   Walking in to the restaurant  I start my order on Sunday they are out of fajitas yes fajitas can you believe that.   Well I try to get some salsas from the salsa bar and all I see there was a big mess all the spot were Enty and salsa all over the place  I think this people is maybe is changing the container or something but the salsa bar stay like that for a good time during my visit  so I ask for fresh salsa at the line serving and they told me they are out   Well I guess this one was one of the best taco cabana  long time ago here in Austin. Since the company was sold I see lots of mess on this restaurant all over Austin   Look at the photos. Sorry photos are here now
Taco Cabana,37,The tortillas and queso is simple but always a hit. Love the tacos. Felix behind the counter is a blast  Super friendly and helpful.
Taco Cabana,38,This Taco Cabana location can be best described as an abusive boyfriend who you keep coming back to in hopes they change but instead disappoints you and reminds you it s over.
Taco Cabana,39,If you eat at this place your just a disgusting human being taco cabana is just gross in they got homeless people working here
Taco Cabana,40,This is probably THE worse location I have been to.  Waiting in the drive they for over 15 minutes for 3 bean and cheese tacos is RIDICULOUS.  AND it s not like I could step in since the doors were locked.  Something really needs to be done about this location.  Sadly my son loves these tacos.  I ve given this location plenty of chances  but it seems as though they are trying to set a record of who takes the longest to attend a customer.  I normally do not complain but this was just ridiculous.
Taco Cabana,41,Taco Cabana service really sucks. You have to wait forever for your food and no one has any customer service skills. I went again on 1 27 2019 walked in stood at the counter waiting to order for almost 3-4 minutes. No one acknowledged me at all even though three employees made eye contact with me including the manager. I just walked out 
Taco Cabana,42,I ve been here a few times in the last six months  amp  it seems to be getting worse. The first time I went it took a while but at least my order was right. The second time I went for breakfast  amp  the female running the drive-thru said she was the only one working because everyone else called-in. Yesterday we ordered online then went to pick it up via drive-thru  amp  were told we needed to come inside where we were told they never got the order. You re better off going across the street to H-E-B  buying the ingredients  amp  making it yourself.
Taco Cabana,43,When did this location start shutting the dining room   I thought the restaurant was open 24hrs     I showed up at 5 15 am and the parking lot was dark  amp  the front doors were locked.  P.S.  I m sitting in the parking lot typing this with a loud truck and my lights on  and for the few minutes it has taken me to type this   no one has bothered to come to the door.
Taco Cabana,44,Okay  so it s 4 AM. Still the worst service ever. Andrew - the guy in the purple shirt - has the worst attitude we ve ever dealt with. They deaf shit in our food. Chole makes me happy  and if there are diseases in our food  we both caught the plague. Totes worth every second. Andrew told us he was  training  a new employee. It s now 4 15 AM  and we ve been told we still need to wait to order. There are now 3 cars behind us. Upon taking our order  Andrew did not make us feel welcome  in fact  I lost my appetite at the sight of his look of disdain. I understand it might not be the most fun thing to do  making cheese enchiladas and 2 bean and cheese tacos  but Chole and I love taco C  but not this customer service. I hope the necessary adjustments are made or we won t be returning.
Taco Cabana,45,Terrible service and very slow. Sloppy food. Awful employees and customer service. It s like they took a bunch of crack heads off the street and put them in one kitchen together to try and work.
Taco Cabana,46,This place is near my work so I drive thru there often. Normally it s no problem but there s one girl who doesn t know how to ring up a black bean burrito so every time she s on the drive through she says they don t have any black beans.   At 11am...  On a weekday...  And only mysteriously during her shifts.   People like her give fast food workers a bad rep- I called to talk to the manager after the third time it happened but nobody even bothered to answer the phone.
Taco Cabana,47,Worst service  We waited a half hour to order get our food. When we got to the window the quality of service was a disaster. All we order was one item. Ridiculous service  but the staff seemed like they were having a fun time inside as we waited in the drive thru. This franchise owner should be ashamed
Taco Cabana,48,Ate here several years ago and called it The Worst Taco Cabana in Texas. Tried it again last night and well  they sure are consistent 
Taco Cabana,49,I walked in the door. The people at the counter finished with the customer ahead of me and the walked away. I wasn t going to wait around for my order to be taken nor wait around for the food to be cooked.
Taco Cabana,50,A couple of friends and I went to grab something quick to eat thinking this would be a quick and easy choice.  The experience was horrible  We ordered second in line after deciding what to order. We ordered for about 10 min after having to explain what each plate came with to the cashier.   Our friends received their food as we still patiently for ours. After they had their food for about 15 min we decided to go see what the hold up was. Our tray was sitting under the warmers with only part of the order. As I was waiting for the rest of the items a lady appeared complaining she had been waiting and she had the same number has a customer that just came in. Another lady walked up saying her order was wrong and also had to explain what her meal came with to both the cashier and line prep. After seeing multiple angry customers up complaining about their orders I decided to stand up there and make sure mine was correct. While standing and waiting on my order a man came and asked if he could wipe some tables down so people had a clean place to eat.   We finally got our food after our table had finished their food and are now waiting on us to start eating ours. I started looking around and noticed the employees joking around the kitchen while customers were still waiting on there food. I saw food on almost every table  the trash were overflowing so bad they people stared setting things on a nearby table.   There were flies swarming the drink station and their was soda spills on the ground where no one including the manager cared to even wipe it up. The sauce table ended up being all one sauce because they were all mixed together. There was trash on the floor that customers had to step over. The manager was running around trying to help while all his employees just stood around doing nothing.  There is a huge management problem at their place. 1- they would never pass inspection to even be open with the amount of trash  flies  and cross contamination issues they have going on. 2-the bathroom doors do not close all the way  and the trash hasn t been touched all day. The toilets are disgusting and the toilet paper was just sitting on the ground.   While we were leaving there were having a team meeting and all he needs to be telling them is safety and sanitation  customer service  and simply just know the menu.  Very disappointing experience 
Taco Cabana,51,Hour long wait for breakfast tacos   I understand that you had a lot of large orders  but you are a fast food restaurant not a caterer
Taco Cabana,52,I ve never had more incompetent drive thru service in my life. A couple nights ago it took us about 15 mins to order. Then about 15 more mins to get our food. When we got our food my enchiladas were made wrong so they remade it  amp  it took like 8 more mins. Thought it was supposed to b fast food. Then got home  amp  the salsa wasn t in the bag OR my burrito. I m back today because the enchiladas are SO yummy. Best fast food enchiladas I ve ever had. Tried to go to the drive thru but it wasn t working. 3 stars bc HORRIBLE drive thru but yummy food. Except when I went inside they still made them wrong the first time.
Taco Cabana,53,Simply put  it s the worst. Don t think they have ever gotten my order correct. Also don t think they have ever gotten my order to me in under 10 minutes
Taco Cabana,54,I frequent the Taco Cabana on Riverside after my waitressing shifts on a regular basis. No matter what time I have come in or gone through the drive thru  the staff is always working incredibly hard. If food times are taking longer than normal  the staff is always quick to inform me of the wait time and extremely apologetic. Laura is the sweetest lady and always extremely polite and professional. I can t recall a time I have been in and Laura was not hustling around to take orders  prepare food  and answer guest questions. She is awesome  I never mind waiting for my order because my food always comes out fresh and correct. I appreciate they take the time to provide quality  correct food. Whether I am ordering two tacos for myself  or entire dinners for my family  the food and service are always five stars at this location.
Taco Cabana,55,This business is so unprofessional and nasty everyone don t look like they know what they are doing. I went and bought two egg bacon and cheese tacos and they forgot the cheese so I go back and they ask can I just give you cheese to put on the side like no re make them but that didn t happen. Needs to be closed down. And it s really no stars they made me put something
Taco Cabana,56,A bit better than Taco Bell I d say. Not sure about all the food poisoning reviews. I survived without even the slightest stomach ache. And mine is sensitive. Huge box platter thing for a quesadilla  which is kind of weird. Decent fast food.
Taco Cabana,57,I would give this Taco Cabana ZERO stars if I could  I order 2 breakfast tacos  very simple stuff  blackbeans  potatoes and cheese. It was 9AM  you would have thought the potatoes were 100 years old  they tasted and felt like rocks  They were freezing and so hard that I think I chipped a tooth  This was 9AM  not noon or a later time. Not acceptable for the breakfast rush  I m pretty sure they were old as hell  They also did not give me a receipt  therefore not able to leave a proper survey for their management.
Taco Cabana,58,Food was standard mediocre Taco Cabana.    This one-star review is because of the bathrooms.  I had to use the restroom on my way out of the restaurant and it was just the most disgusting thing I ve ever seen.  It looked like it hadn t been cleaned since the mid-2000 s.  Both toilets were just repulsive.  Not flushed.  There was urine on the floor.  Dim lighting.  Some shit straight out of a horror movie.  And this was the woman s restroom     I will never go back.    
Taco Cabana,59,First off  customer service was great. They were out of change and a few main menu items but still nice. Luckily  I had exact change  not that I would ve minded giving a dollar or so but not  5.   Got home  started chowing down. There was the top broken off from the edge of a plastic knife IN MY FOOD. Maybe not such a big deal if I would ve spotted it  but I didn t until I was chewing and thought I had found a random bone at first which also would ve been out of place. It was about a half inch long  I guess someone broke it somehow while working and didn t care to pick it out. It couldn t have been mine because I used my own silverware when I got home.   That really left me with a horrible impression. Great customer service but apparently too lazy to find the tip of a knife when it falls in your food.  It s cheap tex mex so don t expect wonderful quality but sometimes it works.
Taco Cabana,60,Honestly screw all the people w the bad reviews. Like whatever. We all get it. It s a fast food kinda chain. But like honestly I would never put this on the same level as Taco Bell and shit. I m vegan and I can actually eat here      I think the food seriously tastes pretty damn good. Granted I ve only ever been at 3am completely smashed but still      And okay I m not at all saying Id chose this over one of the amazing locally owned food trucks but when it s 3am on a Thursday your options are seriously limited and I will always chose this. Like you can go inside at 3am    And the staff is sooooo nice and accommodating. Again  vegan here  so it can be difficult. One dude named Richard and all the ladies that make the food the nights when he s on the register are so legit. They always hook it up. I never know what I order  I still don t  I just tell them what I like I pay a fair price and I get an ass load of dankness that my drunk munchie binge eating ass can t even finish in one night     That s not an easy feat-I f cking eat like a 300lb man when I m drunk . Also DONT BE A DRUNK ASS HOLE AND YELL AT THE PEOPLE THRU THE SPEAKER. THEY ARE PEOPLE TOO. DONT BE A PRETENTIOUS ASSHOLE AND THINK YOURE BETTER THAN THEM. Jesus Christ.   Anywhoooooo for what it is it is fucking legit. I do not eat fast food  but I eat Taco Cabana. It s cheap  delicious  and oh... Did I forget to mention.... THE MUTHAF CKING SALSA BAR          I m broke so I usually fill up 3 of every single salsa and take them home muahahahahba 
Taco Cabana,61,I just wanna say  every single time I go to this location everyone  is courteous  polite  and friendly.
Taco Cabana,62,Tacos cabana was like a worst version of Taco Bell. Would not recommend. Service was slow and food was not fresh.
Taco Cabana,63,I feel silly writing a review for a fast food joint  but this rating is abysmal and I understand why - when I first moved to the neighborhood they were obviously dealing with staffing issues. Taco C is my guilty pleasure fast food and I was happy to move near one  but I stopped coming pretty quickly. The wait was always obscenely long. They were consistently out of what felt like half the menu and they were always really rude about it. There would be a new face at the window every time I came who hadn t been trained properly  was overwhelmed and panicking  and didn t know how to ring anything up. Half the time they d get so frustrated they d just throw random things in my bag - which was kind of fun  I m not going to lie. I m into Taco Roulette. After the second or third time they let me wait in line and then abruptly announced they were closed I took the hint and quit coming back. But I m an exhausted college student and bartender who keeps weird hours  and eventually I tried again. I m glad I did  Everything has been great lately. The staff is kind and calm  the guy who s worked drive through around dinner time the last two Mondays deserves a raise  he s awesome   they seem like they re helping each other out  everything is freshly prepped  and the wait is non-existent. I m really pleased they re back to being an option when I m too beat to deal with HEB. Thanks for fixing the management issue 
Taco Cabana,64,I had a really rough night bartending and I m on my last limb. Andrew was so incredibly nice and seriously made my night so much better  Food was ready fast  it s super fresh  and I got great service... sometimes it s the little things. I never come here  but will be back all the time now  Completely changed my mind about this place.
Taco Cabana,65,Interesting staff. I walk in and the cashier yells at me saying it will take 20-25 minutes to get food. Goes on a rant of how many orders he has backed up. Someone should retrain.
Taco Cabana,66,Don t eat here. Saw one of the cooks throwing up in the parking lot. I ve had bad experiences at these places before and didn t want to stop here but everyone was hungry and it was open. I d rather eat tasty cakes and go to bed than eat Taco Cabana.
Taco Cabana,67,This Taco Cabana should quite frankly be shut down. We have gone to this location about a dozen times in the last 8 months and EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. We have received terrible service  we wait 15-30 minutes  and the orders are always incorrect. It doesn t matter the day or time. The staff is incredibly poorly trained and rude to no end. The last time we went at 10 30 am they informed us after walking in it would be a 30 minute wait. So we stood at the counter for another 15 minutes just waiting to place the order before realizing although the staff was right in front of us  and we were the first ones in line it would take half an hour just to take our order so we may be seated at a TACO CABANA for an additional half hour. Numerous times we have gone through the drive through while people are inside and they don t care enough to even take drive through orders. Why spend  20  on mediocre at best Mexican food with so many competitors in the area  Please TC reevaluate who you have managing these stores ALL the TC in the Austin area have 2  amp  below stars that should say enough.
Taco Cabana,68,The staff was very nice and I love how the salsa bar is always full no matter when you go. They have happy hour 4-7 with  margaritas for less than 2 dollars 
Taco Cabana,69,Currently sitting in the drive-thru line  just as I ve been the last 24 minutes.  I wish there was another restaurant on my way home...   The greeting I received   can you hold on for a min   Ok. When he came back   I m sorry  we have to run around a lot.   He was exceeding apologetic  but we re now at 30min and I still don t have food.
Taco Cabana,70,This is the worst food joint i have been too. Waiting over 30 minutes to eat. And when we got our food  it was cold.   After reading all the reviews it is apparent that management or owner has given up on this location. Will never go to this location again and i will think twice before going to taco cabana. There are many other places in the austin area that taste better with better prices. Stay away 
Taco Cabana,71,Drive through does not have any customer service skills. They act like freshman high schoolers  thinking they re funny  amp  get your order wrong 9 10. I ve worked at fast food once  amp  it s really not that hard... they don t take anything seriously  amp  just take they re sweet ole time since they re making money on the clock. I thought maybe it was just me w  all the bad experiences but after looking at yelp  it s everyone.
Taco Cabana,72,I ve eaten here multiple times and every time it takes a unreasonable amount of time for the food to come out. Today I went in for breakfast tacos and it took 40 minuets to come out. Granted it was 36 tacos but only with steak and egg as well as bacon and egg. With a fully staffed kitchen in the middle of the day for me this was unacceptable.
Taco Cabana,73,Yesterday I spent 25 minutes in the drive thru for my food. The order was wrong and I was over charged for what I got. Obviously I didn t noticed til I got home. Never again this place is awful. I should have listen to the prior reviews.  The negative reviews are true. If you want to wait for a long time and receive a different order come here.
Taco Cabana,74,Laura was super kind. Went above and beyond in taking care of me and treating better than I even expect while visiting. So  five stars here. Food was good.
Taco Cabana,75,Went to get breakfast tacos   the lady in drive threw was nice but when i opened my bacon and egg i found a tiny piece of broken bacon on top of eggs. It almost looked like they broke a tiny piece of a strip n just put it there.. Like wth. Will never go back or at least ALWAYS check your food before driving off at the window so they can see for them selfs.
Taco Cabana,76,If I could give it no stars I would. They take forever every morning. This morning I went at 7 48 and the doors were locked. You re 24 7 doors shouldn t be locked. Pick up the pace and get some new management. It ridiculous how long you wait in this drive thru when it should take a minute.
Taco Cabana,77,Felix was awesome  He was very friendly and went above and beyond when we requested some salsa ranch  he went to the back for us. So nice to have service and a great attitude like this when it s so late    
Taco Cabana,78,2 words. Shit. Hole. Wait  1 more. Duh    I try to give the benefit of a doubt. It s a chain. You can t possibly go wrong with a staple  right   Wrong. I guess certain requests are above their pay grade... Or  perhaps their comprehension.  Whatever the case  it s not satisfactory even as  drunk food.     Ewww.
Taco Cabana,79,This is one of the few taco cabanas that actually lets people come inside late. It is 3 26am and I am ready hungry. A cabana bowl is under five bucks and has all the stuff you want. Friendly staff and a stocked salsa bar.
Taco Cabana,80,They forgot my BBQ and limes. I m highly disappointed because these tacos would probably have been delicious. Just dry without the sauce. Not worth the  20 I spent by any means.
Taco Cabana,81,I hate this place because of an experience I had a long time ago with a rude drive-thru person but I returned because my daughter insisted on their tacos. I sat behind a car at the drive through for 15 minutes then they pulled off without ordering. Then we pulled up and someone said they would be right with us. We waited for another 15 minutes then someone behind us started honking so I honked my horn and someone said they would be with us  again  so I said what s going on in there and he responded that they only had two people working. We waited another 10 minutes then I honked my horn again and they finally took my order of three beef tacos. When we pulled up to the window  I counted at least six workers and a manager. We sat at the window for another 15 minutes  then they finally gave us our food minus the sauce my daughter had requested so I had to honk my horn to get the worker s attention again and repeat that I asked for sauce and we wait another 10 minutes for that  The service is slow and the workers are rude 
Taco Cabana,82,I keep ordering from here hoping it will get better  but in two in a half years it hasn t  either the food is sub par or I only get half of my order. I am a kitchen manager sous chef downtown off 6th street so I know what it s like but honestly I find myself just wanting to come in and ask management   what the H  L  are you guys doing back there and why the H  L  did you take this job if you don t really care   .... you are wasting both of our time . Upper-management  please help me- I understand that mistakes happen and I don t want a bunch of stuff for free I just want EVERYTHING that I ordered and PAID FOR at a respectable quality.
Taco Cabana,83,This is undoutedly the worst Taco Cabana I have ever been to. The only thing that is consistent about this location is how terrible it is.   I have lived in multiple Texas cities and have always been a supporter of Taco Cabana  but Corporate NEEDS to take a close review of this location. The severity of this substandard location ranges from not wearing gloves while preparing food to serving stale food.   Do not eat here  plenty of other late night options.
Taco Cabana,84,To preface  service here is always a hit or miss so come here at your own risk. Went through the drive-through for breakfast this morning and they forgot the drinks for my order. I didn t realize this til I was down the road so I came back and went inside to get them. Once down the road again  I looked down into the drinks and there was a long strand of hair in both drinks...
Taco Cabana,85,Got steak street tacos and each piece of steak was hard and chewy like jerky. It looked like they put there tortillas down and dumped onion  cilantro and steak on top. The entire drive thru experience took 20 minutes. Not worth even worth the  9.
Taco Cabana,86,They re always out of stuff. Guacamole  lettuce  sour cream etc. Sometimes they don t even tell you they re out. They get the order out slowly and almost always incorrect. In addition they are always rude as heck like they expect you to knw what they are out of  btw they can t make burritos tonight.... isn t it a tex mex place  That s like a steakhouse being out of steak.
Taco Cabana,87,I don t know if it s just this location  but they are always out of basic items  I ll get up to the speaker to order and they ll say something like   Just so you know... We re all out of tortillas and beans.  No joke. I have been craving their sopapillas lately. My bf went there a few nights ago to get them for me and they were all out of dulce de leche dipping sauce. I went there tonight for the same and they said   Just so you know  we re out of cinnamon and dulce de leche dipping sauce.   _   Thinking of talking to the manager owner corporate office as this is a common theme there.
Taco Cabana,88,Smelled like shit. Food was not hot. Told the manager the food wasn t hot. They didn t care. Smh...
Taco Cabana,89,Food is always so bland and it never tastes fresh. It s never clean inside  especially the salsa bar. Customer service leaves much to be desired. With so many excellent Mexican locations in Austin  this one should be avoided.
Taco Cabana,90,The food is good but I wish they could improve their service on the drive-thru. Every time I stop through the drive-thru I m missing the napkins  utensils and salsa. They just put.the food and expect us to eat it with our fingers and use our clothes as napkins. Common sense.
Taco Cabana,91,Family was visiting and went here for some bacic rex Mex food made an order and paid 47 dollars check the bag missing chips for my queso no big deal. Take the bag inside showed them and put chips in the bag and left. Get home and the took the queso out and put chips in and forgot to put the queso back in plus ordered a variety of tacos nothing to complicated a total of 12 tacos and I get 12 bean and cheese tacos when I ordered 2 so I paid 250 a piece for barbacoa tacos and got 99 cent tacos don t feel like going back and forth between a place multiple times to deal with ignorant people. Customer service was horrible and simple guess u can hire who ever u can get so will not be going back to this location rather drive further away then go to this SHIT HOLE again
Taco Cabana,92,I just came from this Taco Cabana and I am very disappointed. I come in to the restaurant  and stood there for about 2 mins while no one greeted me. I get that it s busy but still acknowledge the customer. I am 23  and have customer service experience since 15. Back to the point  as I am standing there Joseph comes from the back with no smile  or any emotion and stand at the other register and tell me  Come over here  I was beyond shocked. Joseph spoke to me like I was a child  and was so rude. I asked him if he was okay  because his attitude was so bad. I asked him to get his manager  and told his manager that he needs to have a word with Joseph. I feel that if you hate your job that much  then quit  Don t take it out on paying customers. I will never go back to that Taco Cabana location again.
Taco Cabana,93,I have never been to this location when they have gotten my order right. Tonight was no different. I waited forever for my order and when it was handed to me  the woman who works the drive through said  I m sorry it took so long but I promise it s all in there.  That was an empty promise because I ordered two different types of tacos  crispy chicken and the street style and neither type were in the bag  yet two mushy soft tacos that I did not order were in the bag. This happens to me EVERY time. I like the food and the price and location is good but I waste my money constantly  tonight being  10 that this location stole from me and I didn t get to eat my dinner  It s just not worth the risk and the wait anymore.
Taco Cabana,94,Make sure you specify if you want the happy hour margaritas  4-7pm  versus normal sized ones.
Taco Cabana,95,Waited 27 minutes for a  12 order  time stamps help for accurate reviews   so I approached counter to inquire and the prep lady looked at me like she already knew I was going to be wrong with whatever I was about to ask. Showed her my ticket. Sure enough  they  forgot about that one  so they started then. Saw families and large orders get served who ordered after I. Good job guys. Keep up the smiles and solid customer care. Sarcasm is necessary for  1.5 tacos. Even the manager who took my order was rushing me and mumbling  I d never been there before   as I asked. The only girl that came up to me was the same prep lady to apologize. So kudos to her. Avoid this place. Go to taco truck on Riverside by Walgreens
Taco Cabana,96,I have been coming to this TC location for a while and while the service efficiency is often under par  the food is quite good. The last two times I have visited  it seems the inside of the restaurant has improved. The cashiers have been more polite  my orders have been correct  the food has been hot  amp  fresh  the salsa bar is better stocked and the dining area is cleaner.
Taco Cabana,97,we were the only car at the drive through. the worker said they couldn t take 2 separate orders for our car because they were  understaffed . we get to the window and all of the workers are just making conversation and laughing. the guy giving us our food asked us what sauce we wanted and i said  just mild  he then laughed at me and said  this isn t taco bell  as if he doesn t know what mild sauces they have. he then shoved our lopsided food at us out of the window while containing a conversation with his coworker. we got home and our food was completely effed up. they didn t give us the 2 tortillas  guacamole  or lettuce that came with either of our 2 taco plates  and due to how they half-assed packaged it all of our rice and beans were falling out of the box and mushed together. literally never go here unless you want to be ripped off.
Taco Cabana,98,This place is slow and the don t have their hours of operation placed correctly on their doors. Was going inside to order and the hours clearly say  dine in until 12 am   but the doors were closed at 10 pm. And there was a long line in drive thru.
Taco Cabana,99,Don t go here. This place is a rip off and the food is awful. Let me explain    First of all  I was yelled at and sarcastically spoken to at the drive-thru.  Secondly  I ordered  Steak Street Tacos  and the meat literally looked like a turd  the meat was supposed to be chopped up beef and looked and tasted like garbage.  Third of all  I paid  10 for this piece of crap meal that wasn t even decent.   Needless to say I won t be returning  there are a lot of other better options to eat at in Austin.
Taco Cabana,100,This taco cabana is the worst. Always a long line. The employees are usually rude. And they re literally always out of flautas. Like seriously out of flautas every single night. Obviously they re in high demand so make some more. Not hard to figure out.
Taco Cabana,101,Taco Cabana is pretty inedible all around  but I honestly think this one is the worst one in Austin.  I got tea from here for lunch once  through the drive through  on my way to work or school when I lived on Willow Creek.  I opened the lid and the whole car smelled like sulphur.  The tea was rotten or they needed to clean their tea spout - something was undeniably WRONG with that tea.  So I pull up front  go inside  and tell the folks there that their tea is rancid.  The woman at the coutner assures me they ll take care of it and gives me a coke.    The next week  I decide to give them another shot  this is before they put in the WonderLand of fast food places on Riverside at Willow Creek .  I drive up  place my order including tea  pull around  pay  get my order  and of course they re still selling repugnant tea.    As G.W. says   Fool me twice... won t get fooled again .
Taco Cabana,102,Good food  horrible service. It takes them literally over 30 minutes to make basic tacos. The staff is also extremely unprofessional
Taco Cabana,103,so slow. each time i come i wait 20 something minuets for 2 bean and cheese.    then u look into the window and they are all literally standing around doing nothing. i never write reviews on places but it s so annoying to come here
Taco Cabana,104,It s too bad Yelp won t allow 0 stars.  1. I once had a large cockroach appear in my drink from the ice dispenser 2. If your ice tea smells like sulphur rotten eggs  it means that someone hasn t scraped out the nozzle on the dispenser in months.  Which is extremely gross. 3. I ve never had one Taco Cabana meal in my entire Austin life  3 years  that didn t involve something terribly wrong with my order that involved 10  minutes to fix.  Don t go to Taco Cabana.
Taco Cabana,105,Today I went to get breakfast tacos they hit the spot...  Good  my taco taste fresh...no reheat....good been  amp  cheese  good potato taco. Need better Customer service in drive-thru.
Taco Cabana,106,Bunch of rude high schoolers bathrooms are gross food was not what I ordered
Taco Cabana,107,This has got to be the filthiest TC I have ever been in. Scared to death of what the kitchen looks like. Also  worst shrimp Tampico quesadilla ever.
Taco Cabana,108,I am a fan of the Taco C. After reading some of the reviews below me from previous years all I can do is thank my lucky stars I stumbled upon them NOW instead of four years ago.  There are a few Taco Cabanas you have to watch out for because they consistently suck   cough  Taco C off 360 183  cough   but the one on Riverside is probably decent for 3 reasons I can think of   1. Mexicans live here. Not being racist in the least  but if you tell someone you live off E. Riverside you re basically saying   Yes  I live in the new Mexico of Austin.   2. Mexicans live here. The apartment complex I live in  sucks so hard core... but that s a different post  is sometimes littered with Taco C bags floating through the air. My complex is 85  Mexicanso  Taco C   my Mexican neighbors   a happy and gassy Mexican. Should I eat there  Probably.  3. And finally  Mexicans live here. If you re Mexican and you have a hankering for tacos at 3 am and roll up to Taco C and your tacos blow  someone is gonna fryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Mexicans work here and they predominantly serve Mexicans  it s gotta be like mama made it  yo.  My usual order  Combo   4   2 Bean and Cheese tacos add onions  pico  salsa queso with chips and usually a sweet tea  Bam. Done. Yeehaw.
Taco Cabana,109,Had a very bad experience the other night where the cook supervisor was touching the tortillas and grabbing the meat with her hands which yes she had gloves on but was touching money as she was giving the cashier change a few times while waiting for my food which we all know money has to be the most dirtiest  infested thing in life and yet here she is touching money then handling the food with the same hand and as I confronted her about it she said she s been doing so for years and nobody has gotten sick. For me to deal with it...So I left which I blame myself for putting myself in a position to eat that garbage anyways.
Taco Cabana,110,This is the worst location ever. How long can it take for a flauta plate  45 min  they are always talking to each other n not paying attention  rude ass ppl.  45 min wait  a friend of the employee arrived   amp  what a surprise  her order was ready before mine.. Shitty service would not stop there ever again  They also need to put their hair in a pony tail  disgusting worst experience  couldnt even enjoy my meal.
Taco Cabana,111,Went to TC on 10-14-11 at about 8pm. Had a coupon for  5.99 worth of free food. Went to the drive thru and no wait. Ordered 3 brisket tacos. Order was ready in less than 30 seconds. The tacos were obviously pre-prepared. They come completely plain with nothing besides the brisket and the flour tortilla. They were flattened and had the taste and texture of pot sticker dumplings because of the warmer steamer they were sitting in.   Once I got over my expectation of having a fajita brisket taco with at least one condiment  I enjoyed the tacos. I was hungry. The brisket was flavorful and did not have chunks of fat. Probably will not go back considering all the taco places I have not tried.   Overall 2.5 stars.
Taco Cabana,112,I usually really enjoy eating here  but today I had a very unpleasant time. First off  when I went to the bathroom  both of the toilet seats were disgusting and one of the stalls didn t even have a lock on it. I ordered the steak burrito  that comes with Spanish rice . When I unwrapped the burrito it completely fell apart. The steak was burnt and there was too much lettuce. Next I tried the rice  which had no flavor to it at all. I will not be coming back.
Taco Cabana,113,Went at 12 10am to get breakfast tacos and they told me that they weren t serving breakfast. I pointed out the time and the cashier  whom took over a minute to take our order because the manager and the employees were talking and joking around  and she stated that they were running behind. I asked her why do they tell customers no breakfast until 12am if they aren t going to serve it. She didn t answer my question. We walked out and she went back to joking around with her coworkers.
Taco Cabana,114,This location is horrendous.  I had received the wrong order  on 3 occasions in a roll  when I drove back to have my order corrected.  Asked for the manager to have my food remade. The order was made wrong  yet again  while I was standing there. The employees were rude  and the downtrodden manager basically admitted that there were serious issues within his restaurant. Will eat at other locations  but will never again visit this one.
Taco Cabana,115,Line is too long of a wait. Drive-thru has conversations with the staff instead of ordering food. Orders never come out right. This place needs new management. Nothing like a 30min wait to just order food and then another 15min to get the wrong order.
Taco Cabana,116,I have been to this location 3 times for breakfast around 10 30 so far  and every time I come in   there is this lady wearing a pink shirt working the cashier with the worst attitude towards the customers. I don t know if it is because it is to early for her to work  or she just hates her job. I heard this customer ask for a manager  and she told him there was no manager working the shift. That would explain the bad customer service that this store is providing.
Taco Cabana,117,Diarrhea on a black styrofoam plate. Even the lettuce has the consistency and taste of having been lodged in a rectum.
Taco Cabana,118,This is literally one of the worst Taco Cabanas ever. I have been to over 10 Taco Cabanas in Texas. This location messed up my order the past 5 times. We went today and they had no chicken or steak fajitas.  Friday at 6 30pm . Last time we went for breakfast and there out of eggs and chorizo   Friday at 5am . They are rude  inconsistent  and a true shame to the Taco Cabana name. They always mess up your order when you order the chicken bowl and add sour cream even though I told them no. This location has been the worst. But only this location.
Taco Cabana,119,I must stay Im giving this location a 5-Star because the manager employee Mel who attended us was great  She was really funny from as soon as we walked through the door  when she served us  and to us leaving the place. Don t let her tattoos fool you. She made our a experience a great one with such a sweet and positive attitude  We will be coming back that s for sure. Thanks Mel 
Taco Cabana,120,I don t get all the horrible reviews  It s taco cabana. I ve been to this location a few times. The staff is usually pretty friendly and the food is consistent  far superior to taco bell . I love that it is open after I get off of work and they have a fully stocked salsa bar. If you re expecting authentic Mexican food this is not your place  but if you need a decent late night plate of tex-mex goodness stop in  They are open 
Taco Cabana,121,The food can be really good if they get your oder right. I ve gone multiple times and have gotten messed up orders  only to have to drive back to try to get it right. And it s also worth mention that they have a tendency to run out of certain items from the menu.
Taco Cabana,122,I m about to stun the world with a Good Cabana Review.  It s important that you follow my directions carefully.  It will work at any of the locales  I think .  Get the Rotisserie Chicken.  Eat it with your Hands.  Do not attempt to  improvise .  This Yelp will self destruct in 5 seconds.
Taco Cabana,123,Absolutely awful customer service.. No employee  including guy who appeared to be the manager  smiled  greeted me  nothen.. Complete blank stares.  Will never set foot in this place again...  Gave it one star because not able to do a negative...
Taco Cabana,124,Omg I just wanted a dang quesadilla  Ugh they clean the stupid grill at 2 00pm and it takes 20-30 minutes...they always do this to me. I m going to William cannon location now.
Taco Cabana,125,It s a Taco C so the food is what it is - late night noms  but my issue is that they never get the order right.  Drive thru is stupid if I just have to park afterwards to get my order corrected.  When I ask if it s everything they say yes rudely  amp  they re always wrong.
Taco Cabana,126,This is really an in between 2-3 stars.  I ordered the flauta combo  which are just three short flautas and some chips with queso.  Man  I dont remember taco cabana being so greasy  Also  it was a tad bit spicy  and I don t do well with spicey . Glad I went through the drive-thru.  For 11 pm it was packed   All I can say is.. bring on the indigestion 
Taco Cabana,127,This is a general review for all Taco Cabanas.  Probably really a 3.5 star review...but I do like it  just not as much as a non-chain place .  Taco Cabana is indeed a chain  but it s really a pretty good one.  They make the tortillas there  not sure where the dough comes from  but they run it through a machine in front of you   as well as their salsas  rotisserie chicken etc...  Breakfast tacos are a delicious and tasty value.   Order what you want  it s all pretty decent  especially for the price.
Taco Cabana,128,By far the worst service provided in town... Most of the employees have below average communications skills and not enough IQ for simply taking customer orders...I would have to repeat my order several times.. Many times these employees would be playing around and not wearing gloves.. The place is not well managed and needs to be shut down in my opinion..Just a total disgrace regarding food service..
Taco Cabana,129,Bad health safety practices.slow service . Food isn t at a safe proper temperature. Last time I was in there some teen was making my order. Saggy pants I literally could see his buttcrack from where I was. Didn t wear gloves. Was digging in his butt while making my order and played with his cellphone while making my order. Teen left station then eventually came back. To finish my order. It took him  over 45 minutes to make two fajita tacos and a side of beans and rice. no there weren t any more customers in there It was cold when he rudely plopped my tray on counter also it was a to go order too so he didn t pay any attention didn t handle my food well the tacos were totally crushed and I really mean ugly they were demolished and looked like an angry gorilla made em it s pretty bad when food gets served like that and the employees don t care.  The manager on duty didn t even try to make things right.didnt offer money back or offer to remake my order. Also they need to stop sitting on top of where food is being prepped and sitting on the line where food is being made..as far as the customer service there it s hideous  the employees don t seem to care at all. I wound up leaving with no food or refund. After that I never will eat at that taco Cabana again..ever....I definitely wouldn t recommend it to anyone either.....
Taco Cabana,130,Terribly slow. We waited over 40 mins for a very small order for our family of 4. The 2 parties ahead of us ended up leaving without their food. Will not return to this location.
Taco Cabana,131,Worst service I have ever had  asked the girl for a ranch salsa and she was too busy chewing her gum and checking her phone to acknowledge me. I have been to this location so many times and all the workers make me feel like Ike I am too much of a bother any time I walk in. I have also waited at the drive through for up to 15 min when they were clearly open. Lazy staff and sad work ethic
Taco Cabana,132,Went here on Sunday night and tried to order a family meal of chicken fajitas  and was told they didn t have any so I changed my order to beef fajita and was told they were out also so I proceed to change my order again and ordered some flautas and then was told there was a 10-15min wait  I decide to just go home. The next day I go and repeat my order and was told the exact same thing I changed my order twice and was told they were out again. Employees are rude  amp  cleaning of women bathrooms is very unpleasant.
Taco Cabana,133,I wish Taco Bell would have been open. The drive-thru was closed.   My rice was crunchy.  The enchiladas  I  was told   are pre-rolled.  It was close to impossible to get tacos in flour tortillas...as i watched them being made...but the manager finally made it happen.   She was really nice. Not my favorite experience.  But its close to my home   so I may find myself there again... after I forget about tonight.
Taco Cabana,134,The service here was so bad  I m debating buying that location an out of service sign. If you want fast food  don t come here. 45 minutes for 2 meals and they still came out wrong.
Taco Cabana,135,Wow...gross. Never going back. The tortilla man was coughing all over the food and everyone was rude...I love Taco C but this location blows.
Taco Cabana,136,Least reliable taco cabana ive been too. Sometimes it s okay when I just want cheap  quick tex-mex. But my order has been messed up several times and the staff isnt always the friendliest.
Taco Cabana,137,I have been to this Taco Cabana three times in the past week  I know--weird--but I have been craving the queso for 11 years after moving here  and they have not ONCE gotten my order right   I don t understand how hard it can be with such basic items   And do you have to ask for salsa these days   Once I received it and twice I didn t. Confused. At least their queso and tortillas still taste the same as they did 11 years ago    Their chips are horribly stale.   But it really is dumb to go here when the real deals are all up and down Cesar Chavez.
Taco Cabana,138,Ive been visiting here for over 15 years and I rarely ever have any issue and when I do its always corrected with a smile. The staff is friendly and will take the time to get to know regulars. The store is always well stocked and clean. A great place to take out of towners.
Taco Cabana,139,Terrible experience both times  Will not go back to this location.Drive through wasn t moving so went inside. It was very busy. They were out of desert I ordered. Food took 25 min after I ordered  It was not right had to go back inside and they threw one together in 2 minutes. Terrible  
Taco Cabana,140,Went at 5 26 pm for a chicken flauta plate and she stated they didnt have any. Then as im taking off she yells we do have a few. So I pull around to the window and she says that I have to get back in line thru the drive thru to order again. The food was sloppy.
Taco Cabana,141,Third time in a row that my meal wasn t what I ordered in their drive-thru     Quality is ok  but not great. I ll just say everything is marginal...
Taco Cabana,142,I would give them 0 if I could. I came in for lunch today and the drive thru line was pretty long so I decided to go inside. I was waiting for my food for 10 mins and then the lady shows another customer the screen of food to be made and mine wasn t even on the screen yet. Basically there are at least 8 ppl ahead of you still if not more. So tonight I want dinner and decide to try it again. Go through the drive through and ask for salsa ranch. The lady gives me an attitude the entire time and says we don t have any over here. I asked if she could get some from the salsa bar and she said she couldn t leave her station. That girl needs to take her lazy ass over there and be respectful to customers. I m over that place.
Taco Cabana,143,very very disappointed with this taco cabana      very rude drive thru employees what the hell happened to treating guest customers with respect     and talk with any common  sense they should count there blessings that they have a job....and how hard is it to split up orders     i will be calling your district office....thank you
Taco Cabana,144,Ever had food poisoning     Its not fun. I got 3 Carne guisada tacos because I m a fattie  well about midway through my evening I started burping up my tacos and then oh what s this severe tummy cramping after that started I was sick for 3 days....3 Days      Never again ever especially when I can make that whole dish. Funny thing is I got food poisoning from there when I was 13 and 17 years later same crap. No thanks I like my food not to kill me.
Taco Cabana,145,I dont know why fast food takes 35 minutes  especially when it s not busy  it s not hard to make 3 street tacos while only 15 orders before that.never coming back  literally the worst service I ve ever encountered ever. Hire more people to do the job corporate  maybe your stock won t be down so much this year
Taco Cabana,146,I ve only visited this particular location one time.  I was actually blown away with the professionalism and kindness of the staff.  I love Taco Cabana for late-night TexMex cravings.  Riverside isn t my usual stomping ground  but I can safely say that this particular TC is clean  professional and quick.
Taco Cabana,147,Just tried to go through the drive thru on a Saturday night around dinner time. The guy in front of me took 15 minutes to order-not joking. It was probably a combo of his ignorance plus the employees inefficiency. You can imagine I was a little aggravated but still super polite as I waited an additional five minutes before anyone answered the speaker. I asked what was in the sampler  actually listed it out to her and she said umm I guess so...so then I said can I get chicken in the enchilada and immediately rude-no maam you can t. We haven t had that in years. I said I m sorry I don t Come here often and didn t know. I commented on the guy in front of me taking long and she said leave I m refusing your order  So I pulled around the drive thru and she slammed her hand on the window at me and flipped me off    So unprofessional and rude-will never go back here. Shitty food anyway.
Taco Cabana,148,I just recently moved to Austin from Dallas  where I ate at Taco Cabana quite frequently and was always extremely pleased with the taste and quality of the food. That is definitely NOT the case at this location    My first experience at this location was the day I was moving in  on the 1st of February. I dined in  ordered chicken fajitas  and was somewhat disappointed by the lack of freshness. No biggie  I was too hungry to care   My second experience came about 2 weeks later around 3 00am when I was on my way home from work. I was hoping that this time I would have a better experience with the chicken fajitas. Not only did I receive beef instead of chicken  but they did not give me any grilled onions  peppers  pico  or salsa  All I received was a dried out pile of what appeared to be steak strips  a small pile of lettuce  black beans that looked like something which had already been consumed  and rice that was crunchy. Of course I didn t discover any of this until I was already home  and far too tired to drive back and attempt to have it fixed.  My third and final attempt to salvage my faith in Taco Cabana came the next week on my way home from work. The girl said something through the speaker that reminded me of the teacher from Charlie Brown. I began to order and very clearly and rudely she exclaimed  I am not ready yet  Stop ordering   Really  Really   There were no other cars in front of me yet I still was forced to wait almost 5 minutes before Miss Attitude was ready to take my order. I should have simply headed home  but my rumbling tummy and guacamole craving prevented me  Once again I ordered chicken fajitas. I also ordered chips and guacamole and an iced tea. I actually received chicken this time  but it was hard and somewhat resembled plastic. Once again  all the gave me to accompany my meat was lettuce. WTF  The guacamole was turning brown as if it had been sitting out in open air  and the iced tea just tasted kind of dirty.  To say that I am disappointed by this Taco Cabana is an extreme understatement. I am not one of those pretentious Dallassholes who wants everything handed to them on a gold serving dish  but is it too much to ask for my food to be edible  At least there is a Thundercloud right down the street 
Taco Cabana,149,All Taco Cabanas are great - sit-down fancy Tex Mex food for fast food prices - but I especially love this location  which has exceptional management.  Well worth stopping in.
Taco Cabana,150,This is probably THE MOST disturbing  nastiest Taco Cabana I have ever stepped foot in. Considering Taco Cabana isn t that great in the first place  but this one has to be the one at the bottom of the list. The employees are rude as heck. The manager was an ass hole.  Pardon my language . The staff isn t using proper gear. I heard one of the  cooks  talking bad about a customer who refused to eat his food and wanted his money back. Saying he was and again pardon my language a piece of sh t.  Also the dude waited 30 minutes to get 2 tacos. Oh yeah before I go on. I ve been waiting almost 40 minutes for a LARGE STEAK QUESADILLA . I would complain but I honestly don t think they would care. So maybe I ll just write it on here so that maybe an actual manager will show up and put this place in good order  but I doubt it. This place use to be decent. Now it s just a run down dirty old crap  pile. Oh and the drive thru is always down because the computers don t work....  I don t want to go on with this review anymore cause I don t think it s worth it anymore...  Thanks.
Taco Cabana,151,Wow late night food in east Austin is not easy. After a failed attempt at The Burger King drive-in  we decided to check out the Taco Cabana right across the street. Had heard this was one of the better fast food spots in the area. This food was hardly fast.  The restaurant seemed a little understaffed and the few emloyees there were scrambling to get the orders down from the drunken clientele. After about a 20 minute wait we received our order. The quesadilla was cold but tasty. Burritos were fine but slightly unbalanced with the meat settling at the bottom of the burrito while the rice and beans sat a top. Stay away from the shrimp taco. For desert we had the sopapilla  a strange cinnamon bread that was little soggy n flimsy. Probably a decent restaurant during regular hours just beware after 3 am.
Taco Cabana,152,Well... this is probably the ONLY Taco Cabana location i like   they have never let me down the entire time that i have been going there  I do have to say i think there prices are a little too high for some of there dishes because you really dont get that much but... oh well  I think since the staff there has a  kick butt  manager they make sure all of there meals are good    Way to go Riverside Taco Cabana  
Taco Cabana,153,I love Taco Cabana. Particularly their breakfast. This one was bad though. The beans were very watery  they were out of half the salsa bar  and nothing was very hot. A big disappointment.
Taco Cabana,154,It s Taco Cabana folks. The food is pretty consistent at this location and they serve breakfast later than other locations on the weekends.
Taco Cabana,155,I am always satisfied with how quick I receive my order  the freshness of the food. I have noticed they lowered their portions a tad. The employees are always accurate with orders. There are just a few cashiers that could seem a little more welcoming. Otherwise I enjoy this location over any other local TC.
Taco Cabana,156,The clerks in this place mess SOMETHING up  every time I come in.  The food quality has declined over the years  the clerks are usually overworked  and sometimes unpleasant.  This last time they messed up my order TWICE  its fast food  I take it like it is on the menu...no special orders.  I will not go back anymore...enough is enough.  If there was a negative star  that is what I would put.  I like to support Native Texas companies  but Taco Bell on Riverside is always great.  They get my fast food business.  I hope Taco Cabana closes.
Taco Cabana,157,I went to this taco cabana around 11 30 p.m. on a Wednesday. I went inside to order so that I could take advantage of the salsa bar and I am glad that I went inside because it gave me an up close view of what was happening in this restaurant. First  as we were waiting for someone to take our order  I saw a HUGE cockroach come scurrying out from the kitchen towards the salsa bar. My boyfriend stepped on it and kills it   a disgusting crunching noise I will never forget . At this point  I lost my appetite and just ordered chips  while my boyfriend went ahead and ordered a meal. As we waited for our food  we see ANOTHER HUGE roach climbing the wall behind the soda machine    gross     and to top it off we see the employee making our food  pour a beer into a taco cabana cup and drink it as he continues to make our food   Not to mention the pico de gallo at the bar was so sad looking and the tomatoes were yellow  not that i had any plans to eat anything from there anyways.
Guatemalteca,1,Really glad I found this place  Really random location but the food was awesome   I ordered the 10 tacos for  30  empanadas  and fries. They re all made to order  so they were hot and fresh when I got to eat them. The meat was seasoned well  tortillas were tasty  and the sauce was something else. Def recommend this place.  The only knock is that the waiting area has a lot of mosquitoes  so you gotta keep that in mind. Also because it s made to order  the wait was on the longer side  so it s understandable
Guatemalteca,2,Food is so tasty. They use fresh ingredients in their cooking. The cocktail is big enough for two people.
Guatemalteca,3,Almost didn t notice this place  it s behind the vegan yacht and has a Guatamalen flag by its entrance. Everything was savory and fresh. Chicken empanada plate came with 3 empanadas  sauce  cabbage and queso fresco  it was delicious. My fianc  got the taco chapin and garnachas which had beef on them and also delicious. Definitely will be coming back.
Guatemalteca,4,Authentic  delicious Guatemalan food tucked away on a small side street. We ve been a few times now and all the food has been super unique. I admittedly don t know much about Guatemalan cuisine  so some of the sides are a bit unexpected  pasta salad with sliced ham and mayo . Excellent service as well- the man in the truck even brought us a free taco while we were waiting. Best recommendation  get the taco chapin  Some of the most tender meat I ve ever had.
Guatemalteca,5,Just caught these lovely people on their first day open  Excellent Guatemalan food  especially the tacos. The beef fajita and Taco Chapin are both outstanding and on homemade corn tortillas. Can t wait to try more  Open for breakfast  lunch and dinner.
Quinta Caporales Meat Market,1,I read about this place online and had to take the journey West to taste for myself. This place is worth every penny spent. I got the Carnitas plate  the tacos were  loaded  check out the photo. The people were very friendly and very helpful. Their meat department looked stocked with good meat unlike HEB meat market. Take the trip to check them out you won t be disappointed.
Quinta Caporales Meat Market,2,Be prepared to use your Spanish    but you will be rewarded with fresh and bountiful tacos heaped with meat  Order at the grocery register before approaching the meat counter  then hand your receipt to the senora behind the counter.
Quinta Caporales Meat Market,3,Do not underestimate this meat market   produce market.  It is seriously cheap  good  and always stocked up even on Sundays  they re busiest days .   All produce is displayed nicely  looks and tastes good  and seems slightly cheaper than major grocery stores in the area. Everything is labeled nicely and there are specials of the day depending on what date you come in.   The meat market has plenty and a variety of meats to purchase here. My first time coming here I saw a gentleman walk out with a large pig over his shoulder straight to the cooler in his truck. I was impressed with the amounts and types of meat they had including the specials listed in front of the meats. Everything is in English and Spanish so no need to worry about busting out a Google translator. The butchers are super knowledgeable and professional in offering cuts for your meat s .  The rest of the grocery store offers Mexican branded beans  tortillas  spices  cereals  candies  breads  etc all for you to browse and look through in the clean aisles. There is even a panaderia  mexican bakery  with fresh breads and pan dulce for you to indulge on.  The cocina selling tacos  tamales  cooked meats  etc is right smack in the front of the grocery store and it is the busiest  There are about 6-8 tables that you can sit about 4 people at each to enjoy your freshly made hot tacos  plates  and food. There is also plenty of salsa  green and red  as well as onions  limes  mexican hot sauces  etc for you to load up on your said tacos  plates  etc.  Easy parking in the lot and plenty of food and items to browse through  like pinatas or mexican news articles  while inside QC Meat Market. I highly recommend just stopping in when you are hungry and seeing what you can taste have that is new for you.
Quinta Caporales Meat Market,4,Love this place  Fantastic tacos and menudo. I get the cheap ribeye steaks to make melt-in-your-mouth Chicken Fried Steak. Great selection of meats and gorgeous fresh produce.
Quinta Caporales Meat Market,5,This is a Hidden treasure  I can t recommend this place enough. When it comes to eating Authentic Mexican Tacos this place never let s me down  Also there cheap 
Quinta Caporales Meat Market,6,If you want some authentic tasty tacos and all around meaty goodness  then come to the QC Meat Market. Once you walk in go directly to the left and there before you will be a a variety of different freshly cooked meats to choose from and they all look succulently delicious.  I went with their carnitas taco and it did not disappoint. The meat was tender and juicy resting atop two tortillas. The  portions were perfect as the meat filled up the entirety of the tortillas There are three salsas to choose from and all were good. They also have bins of fresh unlimited cilantro  onions  limes and roasted jalapenos.  This was a great place for me to practice my Spanish which I enjoyed doing and the woman who took my order and prepared the food was very sweet. I ll definitely come back here and try more of what they have to offer. Oh and their tacos cost  1.99 each.
Quinta Caporales Meat Market,7,I love that they have homemade tortillas and fresh tacos they make them on the spot. I can always say every time I been there I ask for special order with egg white only and they make it with out questioning why. I strongly recommend this place.
Quinta Caporales Meat Market,8,A hidden gem in south Austin  with maybe my favorite carnitas in town. Generous helpings and oh-so-cheap.
Taquerias Arandinas,1,Ya know it s deep-rooted aut ntico when for the whole 4 hours you re there  the only people you see are Hispanics. A very good sign. But an even better sign is when you realize you re speaking Spanish after you leave.  I came here for a late lunch with a friend and  the service was one of the best I ve had. If you re lame and can t order in Spanish--no fear  some of their waitresses speak English. In addition the manager checked in on us a couple times to make sure the food was alright. They were attentive  genuinely nice  and didn t rush us out of our seats. That s simply the best part. They tended to us until we finished our food and refilled our water cups often.  When it became clear we were gonna occupy their table for a while after they cleared our plates  they left us alone and never once did we feel unwelcome even when the dinner crowd started picking up. No vexing up-selling tricks  no slyly laying down our check promptly after we finish our last bite  no going back and forth by our table to pry our asses out of our seats with their side glares. Nope. None of those. These folks were genuinely hospitable and welcoming.  Now onto the food  I guess that s important too. I played it safe and ordered the beef enchiladas with the salsa verde. I was not disappointed. Everything we asked for in addition to our meals were brought out promptly with our food  extra sauce and jalape os   The price was great for the portions that we got--humongous   ...Yeah  I guess I ll be back soon   
Taquerias Arandinas,2,I have frequented the Grand Ave. Pkwy location often  so I thought I d get the same quality here. NOT. I ordered cheese enchiladas with red sauce  after learning that they only offer chipotle on weekends  and they were dry  dry  dry. I wondered   Where s the cheese    I cut them open in the middle to look  and was surprised to find a small amount  but when coupled with a topping of crumbly cotija instead of melty cheese--dead dry. I added onions  which helped  and I ordered a cup of salsa  so thought I d add that...but when I opened the salsa I was disappointed to find a smooth processed chile liquid with no character  and a bit vinegary. Ugh. I d have been better off opening one of the jarred salsas in my pantry. Their green salsa was of the standard variety and fine  thank goodness. That and the refried beans were the only redeeming qualities of this meal  unfortunately. Live and learn  for this will be my first and last visit to this restaurant  especially with so many good Tex-Mex joints in this town.  My review recap   NO BUENO.
Taquerias Arandinas,3,Recently had some crispy chicken tacos  and enchiladas from here. Disappointing. I love TexMex because  generally  wherever you get it from  it s pretty good. Well  my food was way  way too salty.
Taquerias Arandinas,4,COVID-19 IM ABOUT TO EXPOSE THIS RESTAURANT      THIS RESTAURANT IS THE WORST    i use too work there and all of the employees are disgusting they dont wash there hands dont wear hairnets and also the chips you eat are picked up by peoples dirty hand and glove the manager whos name is  gustavo  has sexaul intercourse with the employees he even had a date in there getting drunk  a women named  jessica  whos a bartender harassed me more then once and even screamed at my mom while she was eating there just because i put a few bottles in a trash and there where too loud she has anger issues she scares the other employees but she gets a pass because she had sex with the manger and the manager alos had sexual intercourse with a women named  aida thats why hes never there because he feels awkward twords the employees and also trys to play with employees tips by keeping half of of your hard working tips trying to leave you with 3 dollars to take home also leaving some of them employees forgetting about the tips ohhhh and the boss who s name is  Pablo  is even worse hes aggressive towards the employees flirts with the employees and also has sex with some of the employees in that restaurant stopped working there because i was getting criticized because im white by the employees and the women  jessica  screamed at my mom trying to even fight my mom  the people in the back messed with my food by dropping it and putting it back on the plate and i was super hungry i had to throw it away and also some of the employees did witchcraft on me trying to leave me homeless with no money to take home and by lowering my hours            for your saftey of covid i would suggest to just go to dominos pizza is right next to the store    IMA PUT YALL ON BLAST    yo tambi n trabajo all  y todos los empleados son repugnantes  no se lavan las manos  no usan redecillas para el cabello y las patatas fritas que comes son recogidas por la gente con las manos sucias y los guantes. gerente cuyo nombre es  gustavo  tiene relaciones sexuales sexuales con los empleados  incluso ten a una cita all  emborrach ndose  una mujer llamada  jessica  cuya camarera me acosaba m s de una vez e incluso le gritaba a mi madre mientras com a all  solo porque Puse algunas botellas en la basura y all  donde demasiado fuerte tiene problemas de ira  asusta a los dem s empleados  pero obtiene un pase porque tuvo relaciones sexuales con el pesebre y el gerente tambi n tuvo relaciones sexuales con una mujer llamada  aida   por eso  l nunca est  all  porque se siente inc modo con los empleados y tambi n intenta jugar con las propinas de los empleados al quedarse con la mitad de las propinas de trabajo duro tratando de dejarlo con 3 d lares para llevar a casa y tambi n dejando a algunos de los empleados olvid ndose de la ti ps ohhhh y el jefe que se llama  Pablo  es a n peor  es agresivo con los empleados  coquetea con los empleados y tambi n tiene sexo con algunos de los empleados en ese restaurante dej  de trabajar all  porque los empleados me criticaban porque soy blanco y las mujeres  jessica  le gritaron a mi mam  tratando incluso de pelear con mi mam  la gente de atr s se meti  con mi comida tir ndola y volvi ndola a poner en el plato y ten a mucha hambre  tuve que tirarla y tambi n algunas de las los empleados me hicieron brujer a tratando de dejarme sin hogar sin dinero para llevar a casa y reduciendo mis horas            para su seguridad de covid  sugerir a ir a Dominos Pizza que est  justo al lado de la tienda.
Taquerias Arandinas,5,The bar and the staff and food is very good only thing is that hours aren t accurate website and staff say they close at 1 am 2-25-22 going on 2-26-22 but managers wants to close early.. that s fucked up
Taquerias Arandinas,6,Do NOT eat here   Ordered on Uber Eats. Ordered enchiladas and ceviche bowl. Enchiladas were super old and ceviche bowl had a hair in it. Took two bites and threw away enchiladas. Obviously didn t even touch the ceviche. Just don t even try anything he
Taquerias Arandinas,7,Maybe the best late night hidden gem of all time. Came in late  I ordered three margaritas  and fajitas for two for only  56. The bartender was friendly  the food was great and the margaritas were fantastic
Taquerias Arandinas,8,Rude waitresses  don t say excuse me   roll there eyes   had me wait for a order that was already ready   ignored me   disappointed in service
Taquerias Arandinas,9,My son invited us for lunch at this place yesterday.  I will never return.  First off  the service is awful. The waitress came for drink orders.  Brought us a very small basket with crumbled chips and two tiny cups of green and red salsa.  The cups were filled with salsa only to a quarter of the cup  and this for four people.  I asked the waitress for more chips and salsa  and she just stood there and gave me a dirty look.  They do not like you to ask for more chips and salsa.  Food was not great either.  Me and my daughter got beef fajitas for two.  The meat was hard and very thin.  not tender at all  like fajitas should be.  They brought the food items out little by little.  First it was the rice.  My daughter finished her rice before the fajitas came out.  When  the fajitas came out  we had to wait almost 15 minutes for them to bring the flour tortillas  so the fajitas got cold.  But if you looked around the restaurant  the employees were just talking to each other  laughing and having a great time while the customers were waiting.  We are used to leaving great tips  but this time my son left a 10  for this waiter  and I even think he over tipped her.  She did not deserve any tip.  I do not recommend this restaurant  and for sure will never return.
Taquerias Arandinas,10,An associate and I were in Austin  TX last week on a business trip from Los Angeles we came by Arandinas for dinner and were extremely pleased by the service provided by Jessica. She was very courteous and attended us beyond our expectation. Giving this feedback is not enough to give back to her but do hope her work is acknowledged. We go into restaurants all the time in different cities and states and by far this was the best experience.
Taquerias Arandinas,11,Expect to have your system cleaned the fuck out for days after you eat food from here. I ordered steak fajitas through UberEats. The portions were good and it tasted ok. Just made me horribly sick and damn near shitting my pants for 3 days after. Also I was pretty pissed off that I spent  6 on chips and queso and received no chips with the order. Like wtf am I supposed to eat it like soup  Still awaiting a refund from UberEats for that shit right there. Quarantine is a perfect time to eat this garbage  cause your ass isn t going to feel up to leaving the house for days after.
Taquerias Arandinas,12,DO NOT GO HERE.  They have a sign - in two languages - on their door that says No mask No service  but this apparently does not apply to the employees.  Counter clerk  maskless  walked close by me on their way to take coffee to a customer  and I could see another employee in the kitchen  making the food   with no mask.  Not even around their necks.  If you are an anti-masker  knock yourself out  I guess  but all others should stay away.  Employees wearing masks is THE LEAST a business can do at this point.
Taquerias Arandinas,13,This was the worst Mexican Restaurant I had ever ate at. I ordered enchiladas with red sauce and they gave me some disgusting Picadi  enchiladas and which tasted like mole sauce.I would not recommend this restaurant to nobody. The wait staff was just standing around  it took them about Three minutes to even take our to go order and when I called to complain the lady answered the phone speaking Spanish  look guys not everyone here in Austin speaks Spanish.
Taquerias Arandinas,14,Their food and drinks are always on point. I have yet to leave dissatisfied. Their bartender tender Dulce definitely knows what she is doing. If you re ever in the area make sure to drop by you won t be disappointed. I highly recommend it. The only negative thing I can say is that some of their waiters can be a bit moody but I guess it depends on who you get.
Taquerias Arandinas,15,Food is great       But service is SUPER BAD    I get the wrong order and the lady returns all mad   and takes the plate all rude to another table. I COULDNT EVEN EAT MY FOOD THERE..  ..i ask for to go boxes and took my untouch food home      To make things worse  They give me the wrong ticket . And the cashier lady take it from my hands ..she didnt even ask please or apologize  and ask for it.
Taquerias Arandinas,16,Hubby and I were headed to a different taqueria but  fortunately  could not find it.  There is not much open early Christmas morning and we had a craving for breakfast tacos done the authentic way.  The menu is in both English and Spanish which told me the tacos were the real deal.  Right away I noticed the menu states  La Sabrosa de Austin    I got ready to prove them wrong  but  my egg  bean  cheese and avocado taco on a corn tortilla was perfection at  .99  before 11 a.m. .  I am fond of pico de gallo or chunky salsa to doll  up my BT but the salsa served here was a smooth and spicy concotion that surprised and delighted me.  Hubby enjoyed a chorizo and egg plate with beans and flour tortillas finishing up with a clean plate.  Even though this little taqueria is a drive  we will certainly return.  They have a full bar  televisions and conjunto music that fooled me into thinking I was in El Paso again. Yo tengo mucho amor para Taquerias Arandinas 
Taquerias Arandinas,17,Service sucks and so does their food. You re better off going to the Arandinas off 620 in Round Rock. The waiters expect to be tipped and not work for their tip. The beans taste like can refried beans. This is my second time coming and both times they suck.
Taquerias Arandinas,18,Excellent late night dinner...about 4 to 5 tables having dinner At 12 30am on Saturday night  ... They serve until 1am ...  Great staff  very friendly...  I Ordered the tortilla soup... My friend ordered Chicharron en salsa Roja  my friend is from Mexico City  and says that it is the best in Austin... My first time here and I am very impressed with the food and service .... Great atmosphere ... Jukebox with Authentic Mexican music ...  Restaurant is very easy to fine... Across from H-E-B... Behind Whatabuger....
Taquerias Arandinas,19,Disappointed.  I ordered the stuffed chicken burrito and it was nothing special. Not memorable at all. The rice was bland and the beans weren t bad but they weren t good either.  My boyfriend had some fajitas and they tasted like they had lots of soy sauce. It was really off putting.  The flour tortillas sucked. They had a store bought taste to them.  Also the service wasn t too great.   I really wanted to like this place but I won t be back. In hindsight people may have been adding positive reviews for another location.
Taquerias Arandinas,20,The food is great most time. I go because I m a vegetarian and crave their kekas most times. I ve gone about 5 times and 4 out of 5 I had terrible service. One time I was never checked up on. Had to get up to ask for a drink and they expect a tip  The food is good. One time my food was half cold but rest it was delicious. Expect to be here at least a half our because the servers don t know what they are doing. They are always running around like chickens with no heads but takes them forever to take your order. And they don t even check up on you half the time.
Taquerias Arandinas,21,Love there new upgrade . Drinks awesome chips and queso yummy my favorite just service needs to be better that s why I did not put 5 stars waiters need to remember to give there best service
Taquerias Arandinas,22,Went here  amp  was so pleased that they had hand made tortillas but not enough meat on the tacos    everything else was great 
Taquerias Arandinas,23,This place is as good as gets for Austin  that s a good thing . I ve been here several times. for Breakfast lunch and dinner. The Carne Asada plate is awesome  I just love the Nopales. Today I had a couple of avocado tostados  and was blown away. One of the best things about this place is the Salsa  yum  the darker roasted pepper salsa is the best I ve had. I can t wait to get more. Arandinas is worth a visit.
Taquerias Arandinas,24,So Taqueria Arandinas is a chain  and it s pretty much the same place as Taqueria Arandas as far as I can tell.  That means that as taquerias go  it s better than most and worse than some.  I don t eat at taquerias often  so I m not terribly qualified  but my definitely Mexican boyfriend likes the place  so it must be at least somewhat authentic.  I had the carne asada plate  which was pretty tasty.  The nopalitos were yummy  and properly spicy  but the skirt steak was a little overcooked to me.  It s worth saying that I prefer the restaurant to ride the cow to my table - I ll cut off what I want and ride the rest home  thank you very much.  They have pretty darn tasty  and reasonably priced  micheladas as well.
Taquerias Arandinas,25,Best potato  egg  and cheese breakfast tacos in Austin. 3 for  4.77    I also like the fajita tostadas and make the meat extra crispy. Have a good one 
Taquerias Arandinas,26,It really is good coffee. The waiters and waitress work hard. As for the food  it s good. You have a lot of different things to eat. The one thing I see  they feed you well. You will walk out full.
Taquerias Arandinas,27,We had a very poor experience. Both of our food was burnt and it had a very odd taste to it. Neither of us could eat more than a few bites. The environment seemed nice and the wait staff were very friendly though.
Taquerias Arandinas,28,I DON T RECOMMEND  this restaurant if you are expecting good customer service.  I also DON T RECOMMEND  the Huevos Rancheros. I asked for over medium eggs I got over easy and a small serving of home fries. I flagged  the waitress down and I told her that my eggs weren t cooked how I had requested  and also if I can please get a regular serving of  home fries.  She reluctantly took my plate back.  A different waitress brought my plate to me with out saying a word to me.  Terrible Customer Service.
Taquerias Arandinas,29,Best breakfast taco of my life. Tender  corny tortilla  delicious machacado  and I asked for peppers and onions and they threw them in the eggs with fresh tomato like a delicious charred hash. Incredible  perfect salsa. I may become a fixture at this place. Everyone else in there was Latino and the cold case was full of delicious-ooking desserts. Run don t walk to this hidden gem.
Taquerias Arandinas,30,I was at a show at Emos with my guy and we were hungry before it started. So we parked and walked from Emos to this place. I noticed there were pretty good reviews and being from San Diego I miss some good authentic Mexican food. Now I read the reviews about this place being good for tex mex so I stayed with something I knew would be authentic  POZOLE   AND OMG. IT WAS AMAZING. seriously. Can I just eat here everyday  I had been craving Pozole for some time now and this beyond cured that. My dude got a chicken quesadilla and it was delicious. I had a few bites and I was sold. I would definitely recommend this place  Don t overlook it. I think our bill came out to 28 dollars. We had Pozole  chicken quesadilla special  side of French fries  and three dos Equis. Not a bad price. I will definitely be coming back for more Pozole and I can t wait 
Taquerias Arandinas,31,Food is very quick.....good service if u know Spanish...but OK for English speaking too...they understand.....very reasonable..... Large portions
Taquerias Arandinas,32,Store bought tortillas.  Poor customer service.  Manager refuses to accept valid restaurant dot com certificates.  Loud cluttered atmosphere.
Taquerias Arandinas,33,My husband and I enjoyed it A LOT.  Extremely good authentic food.  The best Mexican food in Austin    I recommend breakfast as well.
Taquerias Arandinas,34,I go here alot and i always get the tostada plate and its alwats amazing no place can beat. i am a big fan of their tostadas i always get for takeout though
Taquerias Arandinas,35,The especial quesadilla with barbacoa is the bomb  Also their Tostadas are yummy too  amp  the price is cheap.
Taquerias Arandinas,36,Food was horrible asked to speak to a manager because my food was burned so bad I couldn t eat it and my wife s food looked hideous.  The bill was   32 for a single order of beef fajitas two soft drinks and chicken alanbres the manager said that he could adjust the price even though it was very clear that neither one of us had taken more than just a couple bites of everything.  He said if he did that then the owner would take it out of his check. So I paid the full total. The food was overcooked and extremely bland definitely not mexican food.  It wouldn t even had gotten a star if I had a choice.
Taquerias Arandinas,37,This place is a great place for lunch.   The food is good and the service is fast and they always have good lunch specials.  Tip   Order the beef enchiladas with the red sauce  it s tasty and filling 
Taquerias Arandinas,38,Good and cheap my kind of place love it  Service was quick but our waiter could habe been a bit more attentive. Still good prices Mexican food made up for it. I eat Mexican at least 3 times a week 
Taquerias Arandinas,39,This is an interesting little place. I ve been to the chain before. This one is kinda strange because of the location facing away from the street. Been there for a long time. I went because it was the first place I ever tasted Machacado many moons ago.  Sad to say its no longer on the menu.  Service is good  people are nice.  Food is fresh and pretty good. And cheaper than a pair of socks   It s certainly not the prettiest or cleanest place in town. But the food was good enough.  Was a long trip though to find out the Machacado was not there. However I discovered something along the way....I ll write about it in a minute.
Taquerias Arandinas,40,not too swuft     was very disappointed in the salsa....absolutely no flavor and way too hot and I like hot  The beef and the cheese enchiladas were both aweful and all the prices were too high. the beef fajita taco and the beef fajita chalupa were just ok. only thing I would recommend would be the horchata.
Taco Cabana,1,The last time I ate at taco c was was with my stepson. He s gone now.  I allways loved the salsa counter. Delicious  but you can t get it go.  When I go to the caba a I allways get the quesadillas authentic-o. But why not shrimp tampiquo all year  I love shrimp and it s really good. But why do I allways half to wait  Hello    If I were the owner of taco caba o I would always do shrimp even if it s not the right time.   Also I like floutas. I allways get them when I can t eat the shrimp meal.  My wive said too much shelled fish is bad for my lungs. I may be allergic but not much. My wive allways telling me what to do  but sometimes I don t like. That.  I want to go to taco cab more but my wive allways wants longjohn s silver. May be when my step son Brayden gets back from Houston camp next week.  I miss shrimp
Taco Cabana,2,Absolutely the worst   Management was more worried about proving me wrong to even notice that the ice was out. Pepsi was totally out so I opted for root beer. It was watered down and tasted horrible so I let management know while asking for a cup of ice bc ice machine was out of ice. So he comes out and tries it and proceeded to tell me it was fine. I said it s watered down to which he replied  well it is mixed with water    Bc I didn t want to stand and argue with him I just said whatever. So yes I am well aware of how a soda machine works. I m also well aware of the turn down the syrup to save money  That s also probably the reason you were out of everything  Also still waiting on that salsa ranch   But hey since y all are on top of your stuff.....the mold problems in the women s restroom needs to be addressed. That is black mold and not healthy or safe for your employees or guest. Seeing as how it is around the ac vents it s in your ventilation system which is now going through the whole building.  The dirty looks during my time in your restaurant didn t bother me  But I m sure they made you feel better.  You sir are failing as a manager and failed terribly at customer service 
Taco Cabana,3,Anyone who remembers taco cabana in the 90s remembers that you got a lot for the money and it was really good. Well  those days are long past  but the food is still relatively decent for the money. I ve been to pretty much all the locations in the Austin area and they re very much the same. I d say this particular location is one of the better establishments. The lady behind the counter was very helpful and nice and my order came out pretty quickly. I was bummed to see the salsa bar permanently closed because that was half the fun of dining there. Next time I come back  it ll be for the breakfast tacos.
Taco Cabana,4,Drive-through tacos  That ALONE deserves 3 stars. Granted I m from Boston so appreciate the little things  but Taco Cabana delivers on speed  convenience  and taste. The meat in the steak fajita tacos is grilled and tender. The refried beans and queso are both great accompaniments. And did I mention that you can access this deliciousness without even leaving your car   Quit your complaining  and two-step it over to Taco Cabana.
Taco Cabana,5,I ve been here enough times to know that this location needs help. Too many things wrong  terribly rude drive-thru customer service  incorrect orders poor execution  bland condiments and burnt chips. I ve experienced enough.
Taco Cabana,6,Breakfast tacos are always perfect   Other meals are made correctly. Chicken is tender. The salsas are fresh.
Taco Cabana,7,Tried to walk in for a quick lunch and was told their dine in area was closed. That s not a problem. The problem is there was no signage whatsoever indicating that matter  along with the uninterested service. Basically was just turned down and offered no alternative.  i.e. placing a to-go order  using the drive through  mobile order  etc . Taco Cabana used to be pretty busy when they were 24 hours and I liked it better then. It seems after Covid  their attention to dine in experience has gotten very lackluster and that s an issue.
Taco Cabana,8,This location will tell you that they only accept cash  and then when you get to the window and have no cash  then all of a sudden they will take a credit card. This has happened several times. Seems like someone is pocketing the cash.
Taco Cabana,9,Don t bother with this location I could even finish cheese enchiladas they left them in the microwave too long couldn t chew thru the Last of it
Taco Cabana,10,I had driven 30 minutes out just for this mess  it s not worth it . I ordered a cheese quesadilla with pico and sour cream on the side just for them to give me a chicken quesadilla. Once i got back into my car to start eating  I notice that there was barely no cheese or pico inside it. By then I just was over it  bad enough I was super hungry  I just took it back and got a refund. Please go somewhere else or just head over to H-E-B and cook it yourself.
Taco Cabana,11,Pandemic review  SAFE  CLEAN  Employees wore masks and gloves. The dining area appeared closed and everyone seemed to be using the drive-thru. Will be happy to return to grab family meals to go. Highly recommend   We used the app to order our meals and also some pantry items. We were pleasantly surprised that they included extra condiments even though we did not ask for them. Also  it is good to know  but we were able to add a few items to the order at the freaking window. We do not know if this is the norm  but it was extremely nice of them to do so to make our order more complete.  For this location  we tried their new flavor margaritas as well. You get a mini bottle of the tequila to add to the frozen mix so you know exactly what you re drinking.
Taco Cabana,12,They barely filled the tacos. Such a rip off. I m so bummed and still hungry.  yoquierotacobell
Taco Cabana,13,My friends and I were dreaming of taco cabana margs to go. The website and their drive thru screen said they close at 12am on Thursday and we were at the drive thru at 11.10pm. No one answered us on the drive thru  we went to the window and there was no one there. we stayed in the drive thru for thirty minutes and NO ONE appeared ever. We received no service at all and decided to leave  after we sent a message to taco cabanas customer service website but got no answer from them. Not satisfied with the service at all  from the location or the overall customer service.
Taco Cabana,14,Horrible. I went inside for a to go order because the drive thru line was really long. I only wanted 2 tacos and a small queso but the girl talked me into the combo meal saying it s cheaper. It is not. I paid  2 more for a drink that I didn t want. Then I waited 20 min and when I asked for my money back the creepy guy taking food to tables said  why    Because it s taking way too long and I need to go  So the girl just shrugged and said  I told her . I don t know what that means. Horrible customer setvice  Update  I tried again and when I ordered my usual chicken tacos at the drive thru I was told they don t sell them anymore. So I needed a moment to look over the menu and the girl seemed really annoyed and took a long time to get back to me.   Never again 
Taco Cabana,15,Dropped by for my usual two breakfast tacos and an Ice Tea. Let me be very clear do not get the ice tea.  Wait let me say that just one more time..............  Do not get the ice tea.   After my transaction in the drive thru was complete I headed to work. Got to the office and sat at my desk took a large gulp of tea. That is the moment I thought to myself there was a very large problem. The tea tasted bad  not it s been sitting around to long bad. Not the tea was brewed to strong bad. The kind of bad where you wonder if someone left cleaning products in the contained on accident bad.   I am not really not sure why the tea would have such a chemical like flavor. Ice tea is not hard to make and there is no situation where unsweetened tea should have such a flavor.  On a side note the breakfast tacos were fine.  Now I no longer trust this restaurant and that is the real issue.
Taco Cabana,16,I wanted to choose NO stars  but it wouldn t let me.. I placed an order on the app and asked for some additions to my tacos. I waited in the drive thu for 30 minutes to pick up my order. When I got home the tacos were incorrect so I called to let them know. The young girl   shanae  I belive  started to scold me and said   you weren t charged for the extra stuff  so I don t know what your problem is  . I stated my problem was that I didn t recieve the correct order. She kept arguing with me stating that they  dont control the app    so I asked for a manager. We came to the conclusion that she would refund my money  never mentioning to return the food. I waited  again   in the drive thru  as the front door was locked   gave the middle aged Hispanic manager my receipt and was then yelled at   where s the food . I stated that she didn t ask me to return it. After she kept yelling at me  I asked for my receipt back. She started to hand it to me then SNATCHED it out of my hand. I drove off startled at the service I just received thinking I would just go home and access the complaint line......yeah  good luck on that one. I proceeded to sit on hold for over 30 minutes with no one ever answering. Don t go here  Customer service is horrible and corporate is even worse   I wouldn t of complained except this is the 3rd time I have tried to contact the  Help  line and left sitting on hold for over half an hour each time. Are you guys getting that many complaints  Maybe it s time to revisit your businesses plans  if that s the case.
Taco Cabana,17,5 24 2019 - It s 8 27am and the doors are locked. After a few minutes and after I took a picture  a worker asked if I was there to pick up an order. I said no then she said they are only taking drive through orders. I guess Taco Cabana doesn t want my business today.   When going through the Taco Cabana drive thru  it s not enough to make sure I got the correct number of tacos I ordered  now I I have to make sure there is food inside my breakfast taco. Here is my plain egg taco purchased 2 20 18 around 8 
Taco Cabana,18,Their service is the absolute worst I ve ever received at any kind of take out place.  Something is missing from my order every time.   A taco I got during my last visit had a piece of grill brush in it and I bit down on it and chipped a tooth. I was really unhappy that I had to go there again today but I had 2 kids in the car and I needed to get them food quickly. I explained that my last visit was not up to par and they told me they would double check my order and it assured me that they would get it right.  Like a fool  I trusted them. I got home and realized that 2 fajita chicken tacos with peppers and onions were missing. I was charged for them and I am livid that they are missing. They won t even answer the phone to make it right and I have tried calling 5 times. Ughhhhhh JUST THE WORST.
Taco Cabana,19,We love TC. Yes  they sometimes forget a part of your order. Yes  you kinda get variations on a theme of what you ordered. But the kickin nachos and the margaritas to go are delicious  and where else can you get dinner for two for  20    We do stan TC 
Taco Cabana,20,I had to order 40 breakfast tacos for work. I submitted the oder online but I put 7 30pm instead of am  I called the store directly and the manager assured me that they would have it ready in the morning. He was very polite and kind. I called in the morning to confirm and they had the order and knew the situation. The tacos were ready when I arrived and pick up was a breeze. They were a hit at work too 
Taco Cabana,21,Although a clean place to eat  the food quality is poor and the staff is far removed from being excited to work there.   This is the McDonald s of  Mexican  food and the underwhelming atmosphere left me hollow inside due to underwhelming portions and taste.
Taco Cabana,22,They put a few drops of salsa in the cups  max.  Sure.  That ll save less than a penny per order  and maybe shareholders will get a few pennies more on their dividends while I get shitty flavorless tacos   Also they understaff like most places so you have to repeat your order several times to a worker who is being expected to have several conversations at once.
Taco Cabana,23,Do not  I repeat DO NOT order a TORTA here. 30  mayo  20  tomato   40  we don t care  I think possibly a pice of meat  on a stale and slimy bun. Imagine an irritated Chinese speaking Italian hungover making your Mexican torta blindfolded while someone is slapping the back of their head.
Taco Cabana,24,It s been a while since I have been here and I was hoping they had improved since I didn t feel like cooking and just wanted a quick bite that was fast food fried food.  We stopped in and walked up to the counter to a gal who definitely wasn t interested in doing her job at the register.  This became further evident when we asked if they had barbacoa since it was a little later in the evening and we know this is a breakfast item.  She blank stared at us  checked her phone and then proceeded to the kitchen to ask the cooks.    As we stood there waiting she slowly came back to the register and stood there and stared at us.  My friend had to ask her if she found out if they had it or not.  She then proceeded to say   yes we have it but  not the way the Mexican people like it made.   Um ok we both looked at each other and we weren t really sure where to go with that.  My friend was already annoyed so he walked out and after a minute or so  I walked out because I realized he wasn t coming back in.  We decided to go to the Burnet location because we didn t want to order any food from someone who had such bad customer service or have them prepare our food.  I can t believe the seriously awful level of customer service at this location and if it wasn t the second time in two years that this has happened to me I wouldn t be as upset.
Taco Cabana,25,Dont go today  bad service. They give you a number  But don t tell you you still have to pick up your   When I got my order I had Ask for ground beef nachos they brought me tacos.   20 minutes later they Brought me the ground beef nachos I ordered but the chips were stale the beans were smoking hot but the whole thing was just bland. My bank statement says that the charge me  9.87 but when I asked for to refund the owner gave me  6.05 definitely the last time I go to this taco cabana
Taco Cabana,26,when i opened this up  it gave me a vague memory of when my daughter was just born. you know what i mean. look at this picture. i fed this to my dog after i vomited it up on my linoleum floor. the odor was that of an unwashed asshole. i wish i could have my food reimbursed as well as the medical procedures for my darling Sparky  that i m going to have to fly to Belize to get for her. Would like the plane tickets reimbursed too  but this shitty corporation won t even answer my phone calls  PATHETIC. After i vomited up this actual slop  i knelt in the shower and cried for about 20-25 minutes  wondering why my life came to this. My wife also just left me  so why did taco cabana  on top of this stress  have to serve me this JOKE of a meal  I can t trust anyone anymore. Goodbye cruel world.
Taco Cabana,27,We saw this chain all around Austin and decided to give it a try for breakfast.   Pros   Food was fresh and tasted good.  It was a cheap breakfast.  Portion size was big.   Cons  Atmosphere felt like any other fast food chain.-boring.  Employees did not seem happy to be there.  They take a minute to handle ringing up a simple special order.  When they bring the food to your table  it was just plopped down on the table.   Would I go back   It would not be my first choice. Food - 3 stars  service - 2 stars.
Taco Cabana,28,Actually I can t stand taco cabana anymore. After being spoiled by so many good taco places in Austin I just don t think I could ever come back here again. This is just taco lite. True trash taco fast food if there was such a thing.
Taco Cabana,29,Warning  Wild ride ahead. The manager here  Ferdinand  is absolutely psychotic. While I understand  this sounds dramatic  he did everything from puff his chest up to my friend like he was going to fight him to raise his voice to me. I M NOT LYING  YALL. THAT HAPPENED. Note  this is all because we waited 37 mins for our food and simply asking for an update of when it may be ready. I am still floored by the experience. I always give credit where credit is due and about four months ago I stopped at this location and had a terrific experience with Christopher and during this ordeal there was another employee Max that also had great customer service. The district manager reached out to me and I appreciate that but I still can not believe they have someone like that working for them. Do not bring your children here. This whole ordeal happened in front of a 5 year old little girl.
Taco Cabana,30,Okay  I m a fan of the food but not in the slop like way they put it together . I have repeatedly had my order messed up and called them out on it every time  calling customer service twice and they took my information and offered me a 25 dollar gift card on 2 separate occasions only to never have the cards arrive. I am done with Taco Cabana for good.
Taco Cabana,31,Kudos for hiring special needs staff but the clueless guy with the creepy smile is not helping your business. 30 min to get 2 tacos  Understaffed and no appologies. Orders handed out to the wrong people. Just avoid this location unless the drive thru.
Taco Cabana,32,Asked for soft tacos and I got crispy deformed tacos instead. And cold meat. I walk to this place like twice a week. Hopefully next time will be better.
Taco Cabana,33,Very rude manager. An older Hispanic lady that was the manager on duty denied my boyfriend and I service because we walked in with our skateboards. We skated through the parking lot and when walking in she denied us service and said we weren t allowed to come back. It s not the first time we ve been inside with our skateboards. Her demeanor was very rude and not professional. She wouldn t give me the GM name or a corporate number either. The skateboard is a form of transportation since neither my boyfriend nor I have cars. We ve never been discriminated at taco cabana and now I feel unwelcome to step foot inside any of your stores.
Taco Cabana,34,What are ya ll smoking   Child please  me and my co worker come here every week for those bomb ass chicken quesadillas.  Always hits the spot.  Also we drink a couple of their margaritas and they are pretty good and strong given that it s a fast food.  Sheesh y all better get out your feelings and get yo life.  Leave my taco cabana alone okaaaaay......  Go pick on taco bell dusty self  Check please lol
Taco Cabana,35,Skip a stand in mgr here doing an awesome job. Very attentive  My brother and I noticed hom walking around outside making sure everything is nice and clean
Taco Cabana,36,Just not good.  wait time  - slower than slow  food quality - bland and boring  Staff - underwhelming  all in all just sad.
Taco Cabana,37,Went in for an early lunch and the service was horrible. After waiting 22 minutes for my simple to go order  I had no choice but to leave. I was not the only person dissatisfied  numerous people had waited longer than I and had used their entire lunch break waiting on their orders.  I don t know what s going on there  but they better get it right soon or they ll have no customers.
Taco Cabana,38,They mess up your order every time.... don t waste your time. It s also as if they hate their job  if you hate it that bad to get a new one. You do not have to be rude and have such an ugly attitude with customers.
Taco Cabana,39,As someone who has been a die hard Taco Cabana fan his whole life I am truly disappointed. My girlfriend and I both had black bugs crawling in our tacos. One is a fluke  but 2 different orders is a serious problem. I brought them up to the front to show the employee and he asked if we wanted more tacos. It made me more ill than before. Please address this issue immediately.
Taco Cabana,40,I arrived 25 minutes before breakfast was supposed to close. However  the 4 car line seemed to be to much for the staff to handle as I proceeded to wait 30 minutes to be able to order and by then breakfast had closed. The staff then told me that I was unable to order breakfast now that they had wasted my time to the point where almost all other restaurants no longer served breakfast either. Taco cabana is good  do not go to this location.
Taco Cabana,41,It took 35 minutes to receive my food. When I received it  the guy said  Sorry for the wait  it won t happen again.  By the look of other reviews here  it s happened more than once. Plus  my rice and chicken tasted stale.  To sum it up in a few words  they over promise  and under deliver.
Taco Cabana,42,It s Saturday breakfast and they are out of queso. You gotta be kidding. Avoid. You can do better in ATX
Taco Cabana,43,I just moved to North Loop a month ago and I come here for my breakfast tacos.   They have always had great service.   On my way there now for some potato  amp  egg tacos.
Taco Cabana,44,Service was fast and friendly  but the quality of food was not that good.  I stopped by out of convenience one early afternoon to pick up a quick breakfast burrito.  I got the potato  egg  and cheese taco and a brisket  egg  and cheese taco.  I wasn t all that hungry and ended up only finishing half of each of those  I d rather save my stomach space for something more enjoyable when there are so many options close by.
Taco Cabana,45,The overall ratings of every Taco Cabana is always a solid 3 stars or less. Personally  I ve had pretty good experiences with Taco Cabana because I don t expect anything mind blowing. I ve been through the drive-through here twice and have never been disappointed. The service has always been relatively fast. I got the chicken flautas both times  and they were always crispy and delicious. Dunk those babies in some queso  guacamole  sour cream  or wrap them up in a tortilla stuffed with rice  beans  cheese  and lettuce and you ve got a pretty cheap  substantial meal. A diverse salsa bar and fresh flour tortillas definitely don t hurt its rating either.
Taco Cabana,46,Everytime I go to this location   its a fiasco. I had decided to never come back after I complained last time but I got a call from a manager so I decided to give them another chance. Shame on me.. Cashier Georgiana is the worst. Extremely rude and short. Im not asking to be treated like royalty but this girl literally said   do you want your change or not  and then threw it at me. Im done with this place.
Taco Cabana,47,Since my last 5 star review for this place....management has changed.  Very slow service and unhappy workers.  I ll be sure to stop at another TC on my way into the office.  Three stars because the tacos were good and the tortillas were fresh  not reheated from the day before.
Taco Cabana,48,Waited almost 30 mins for a burrito Togo  I thought this would be a quick stop. It looks like a fast food restaurant. One patron went to ask about her order and moments later the restaurant employee scream the patrons number... it was startling to put it mildly. You d think someone was being stabbed.   I figured after the long wait the burrito would at least be okay. I had about three bites of my burrito and threw it out. There was no chicken  rice was undercooked  and over all the burrito was a gross sloppy hot mess. I ended up having to get something from some where else just to get the taste out of my mouth. First and last time taco cabana. Waste of time  money and bad food.
Taco Cabana,49,This is generally a nice location. The staff are always super courteous so I assume the issue is with management. On a few occasions when I ve walked over they re out of certain ingredients. Not at the end of the day. They ve run out of ingredients multiple times around noon. I m vegetarian so sometimes it s a deal breaker and I just settle for finding food somewhere else.   Today I walked over around 7 30pm  and there was a sign on the door that said the lobby was closed until 6am. There were other patrons inside so I walked in to order. An employee let me know they shut down the lobby because there were only two of them working at the time. That s not their fault. The employee offered to take my order anyway before she locked the door behind me but it was just another example of management not being on their game.
Taco Cabana,50,I had the cabana bowl with the chicken fajita and it was very good. The service was fast and the staff was friendly. The place was mostly empty at 11 30 AM  but the food and service were really good. The place was very clean even around the salsa bar. The salsas were full and fresh tasting. I really liked the new hot sauce in the bottle. It tasted like a spicy enchilada sauce with a vinegar tang. It went well with the fuego salsa on my cabana bowl. My dining companions had the taco plate and some beef fajita tacos  which looked good. They said they tasted good as well. I will definitely return to this cabana location.
Taco Cabana,51,The thing that makes this Cabana special is the attention and care of the employees  especially Honus. He always makes sure to ask how I m doing  to ensure that my order is correct and to my liking  and does it all in a timely manner and with a smile.
Taco Cabana,52,Augh  This is the worst managed Taco Cabana. During the morning hours on weekdays  you have to sit in the drive thru forever  and when you finally get to window the ladies inside are chatting it up and laughing  NOT serving customers nor are they concerned about the drive thru customers.  AND  practically every time I get the wrong order. Monday ordered 2 chkn fajita tacos ... got 2 chorizo  amp  egg tacos instead  Thursday ordered 2 bean  amp  cheese tacos ... got 3 egg  cheese  amp  bacon tacos  following Monday ordered 2 chkn fajita tacos ... got 2 egg  cheese  amp  bacon tacos.  I GIVE UP    This place is awful and the service is so slow. They can t get the orders right for anything and you ll need a good 20 minutes to sit in the drive thru to get your wrong order.  PITIFUL   
Taco Cabana,53,I love crispy tacos and tostadas and crispy tequitos  I do not love the burning hot lava dump I have to take the next day after eating at  what I call   Caca-Cabana.   Caca-Cabana  if there s no other options   Caca-cabana turned me into a Bernie bro beacaue after eating there I was totally  feeling the burn.    Caca-Cabana  smells like diapers throughout. 
Taco Cabana,54,Dudes. Cut this joint a break. I just ordered a couple of combos and everything  EVERYTHING TURNED OUT FINE.   Great quesadilla. Great tacos. The SALSA is some of the best I ve ever had. I m picky and even I am impressed.   Great deal for a good meal.
Taco Cabana,55,Completely understaffed on a Friday night. It seemed like they had about half the staff working that they needed.  Came in right before 10pm and had to wait 15 minutes to order because nobody was working the cash register. After ordering  it took another 30 minutes to receive one plate of food that was to-go. Ridiculous. We asked the employee that was working the cash register  who had been working the drive-thru  if she could refill the salsa  which was almost all out down to the last bits. She seemed very put off by this request and rudely responded that they were out of salsa  which didn t seem true. The tacos were fine  but definitely not worth a 45 minute wait.  Overall  2 out of the three people working  one man and one blonde-haired girl that was cooking  were very polite and apologetic about the wait. The girl who took our order however  as long as the insane 45 minute wait for  fast  food  is what will make me think twice before coming here again.
Taco Cabana,56,Really good food for a excellent price. If you want to have good food really fast  this is the place. Inside the restaurant is really really clod  be prepared to eat inside. The employees and waitress there are really chill and they always help you.  It s a good place to eat  chill and talk to your friends. The food is most like Mexican food.
Taco Cabana,57,Wow  is service at this location always so slow  Based on other Yelp reviews  the answer is yes.  I went through the drive through around 10am on Sunday morning. I just finished up at the gym and didn t want to go inside because I was all sweaty. I pulled up and there were only 3 cars ahead of me. The voice on the intercom asked for my order. I started ordering and was interrupted  asked to hold on a second. I waited for about five minutes  and then the person came back to take my order.   I ordered and it took about 10 minutes to make my way up to the window and receive my food. Luckily I checked the bag before driving away because they forget to include the salsa that I specifically asked for. I drove around  parked  walked in  got some salsa and napkins  which they also failed to include   and left.   The whole purpose of going through the drive through is so you do not have to go inside. Their failure to complete my order defeated the purpose.
Taco Cabana,58,I would first like to say that this review is specifically towards the Management  amp  Staff and this specific location. I very much LOVE the food at Taco Cabana and was very excited about fulfilling my bean  amp  cheese taco craving. The place itself was very clean  very nice and welcoming so there was of course no issues with that. I m giving 2 stars to rate this specific location  1 Star based on the way things were handled and 1 Star for the place being very clean and nice.  I have never gone into a Taco Cabana and experienced such unfriendly attitude from both an employee and management. I went through the drive through and asked if they did the  .13 bean and cheese taco promo and the guy said yes but only one per person  so I ordered 4  2 adults  amp  2 kids . I also ordered a 3 pack of flautas as well. My total came out to over  7 and I asked him why my total was so high because the flautas were only  2.99. He told me that the bean and cheese tacos are only per order. Ok...well you just told me at the speaker that it was per person. I asked if I could just make separate orders at the window and he said he would go ask his manager. He came back and said his manager said no  so I asked if he was new and he told me that s he s been there a while. I don t fully understand why I couldn t just place another separate order at the window like I have done at several other fast food windows before. I told him I would just come inside and make the order.  I parked and came inside to place my order and the Manager  Daniel Vergara  was at the register. First of all there was no welcoming attitude  no smile  and no greeting whatsoever. Maybe he was having a bad day  maybe something happened and he s in a funk  but of course you re still at work and still representing Taco Cabana in a negative way. I immediately told him that I was trying to order the  .13 bean and cheese tacos at the drive in but the guy wouldn t let me make separate orders and I wasn t sure why. He just looked at me and asked what I wanted to order. Daniel had no care whatsoever about the drive through issue. Then he told me that I had to have a coupon to get that deal. Why the heck wouldn t the drive through guy mention anything about a coupon  Then I asked Daniel where I get the coupon and he said he didn t know and went and grabbed a paper and started reading it and then said it gets sent to me. I asked through email  Or through an app  Could I just download the app and get it  He was unaware and said it might get mailed to me. I ran out to get my phone and downloaded the app but he was still unsure. Then proceeded to ask me if I still wanted to order so I stated no and decided to leave.  I m not frustrated about not getting the deal but more frustrated about how things were handled. He did not seem to care about the situation at all or even offer me any other current promotions or deals they had instead.  I hope he has a better attitude in the future. I will not be back at that Taco Cabana again but I will definitely be enjoying my bean and cheese tacos at the other friendly locations.
Taco Cabana,59,I love Taco Cabana but this location has been the worst experience I have ever endured  The place is a complete mess starting with Staff from the mistreatment from the management to customers and staff. You can tell from what I saw his name was Daniel Vergara sets the whole negative atmosphere idk if he was having a horrible day or that this is how he typically runs the restaurant on a daily basis. Judging by the previous poor reviews it s a usual setting. As mentioned I do love Taco Cabana so please fix his attitude 
Taco Cabana,60,I ll remember this taco cabana experience on my death bed. My man Ferdinand served me so well. I love him and this taco cabana forever.
Taco Cabana,61,I wish I could give less than one star. The service here is awful. The employees don t care and it shows. I live nearby so I often go for its convenience. My order has been wrong on multiple occasions and on top of that  they give you a fraction of what other locations give  see picture 
Taco Cabana,62,Nicely clean food is hot  amp  good good service  the restrooms are clean  amp  the service is pretty fast
Taco Cabana,63,Over ten  10  minute wait to get one burrito at 9 pm  hardly any customers and at least five staff  clueless .
Taco Cabana,64,Horrible location with the absolute worst customer service  including corporate. Never place a catering order with this place - you won t get it anywhere NEAR the specific time you included on the order  making you late  and you won t even get an apology or any kind of acknowledgement from the restaurant or corporate. Why provide a customer care email address if you won t even respond  Wouldn t even give this place 1 star.
Taco Cabana,65,Every time I go the potatoes are undercooked and COLD. There is so much completion out there Taco Cabana needs to step up their game 
Taco Cabana,66,I m just adding to what a lot of people have already yelped about...the customer service here is horrible  I get it  you don t like your job. Get another one. Quit taking it out on me. Thursday  November 29th  2018  6 40am   We don t have sausage.  he muttered into the microphone. Sounded like I would expect someone on death row to talk.
Taco Cabana,67,Ordered chicken flautas and black beans rice - the flautas were alright  but the black beans were almost refrigerator cold and had a whole top of a tomato  green part where stem attaches  in it. The rice was gross and crunchy - perhaps over re-heating  Pretty hard to miss these things if anyone would have been paying attention while plating. Will not eat here again.
Taco Cabana,68,Eating at this Taco Cabana location is like living in the movie Idiocracy. Ridiculous wait time for  fast  food  it s dirty  and the staff seem to have no idea what they re doing. I ve come here maybe three times only because it s close to where I live and it s been bad every time. But today was the worst. I waited 35 minutes for three tacos which  not surprisingly  were pretty awful. They were no more busy than any typical day at the lunch hour. Everyone in the place was waiting on their food and some people were asking for their money back. Needless to say  I won t be back to this location. Avoid at all costs.
Taco Cabana,69,I received great service at this specific Taco Cabana location in north Austin. Ferdinand was incredibly helpful and patient when servicing my friends and I. The food was fresh and service was efficient. It is rare to receive fantastic customer service at a fast food restaurant and I definitely recommend this location. Thank you for a great experience 
Taco Cabana,70,Has to be one of the top cabanas we ve been to  And we ve been to multiple in different cities and states. The cashier last night 2 22 18 was so friendly and upbeat. There was a girl running around cleaning stocking and taking out food and the manager was in the back helping his kitchen make food  The food was out fast and fresh  We had an overall great experience. I even told him how awesome his staff was on the way out the door  Not sure why this store only has two stars. Keep up the great work 
Taco Cabana,71,Absolutely horrible.  The person taking orders at the drive thru was rude and difficult to understand. At the window  probably the same person  it was the same story. No one spoke clear English and they were pissy if you asked them to repeat themselves. The cook apparently speaks for everyone working there and answered every question I had instead of the person at the window. Maybe he should focus more on cooking and not serving cold food.... I definitely won t be trying this location again.   It seems like the worst location in the entire chain.  Plus  it was a 15 minute wait at the window for the cold 3 pack of flautas I received. 
Taco Cabana,72,Always bad service.  And I have been coming back  hoping they will get better.  We walked in at 9 40 there was a long line nobody was at the cashier to take orders there s no ice in the ice machine to get sodas I like coming here but it s just been bad service for about 2 months now and they need to get new people or new management or something
Taco Cabana,73,Store hours 24 hours  Went twice this weekend after midnight  workers were present but drive through was ignored. Being in the industry and working late hours it is extremely frustrating to be lead to believe that a place is open 24 hours.
Taco Cabana,74,Ordered my food which was 2 bean and egg and 2 bacon egg and had to repeat it four times. I then asked for my receipt. The guy working as a cashier half attempted to reprint a receipt and then decided to rummage through the garbage for my receipt. I said  never mind  Dude.. you are dealing with my food and you didn t even wash your hands after rummaging through the trash and then you  dealt with the line behind me.. gross. I don t want a dirty a   reciept.. besides this they forgot my order and we had to remind them to make it. Worst taco cabana ever.
Taco Cabana,75,Aweful service. Not any music playing  dead silent other than the employees in the back laughing. Nobody was around to even greet us when we walked in to order. They messed up our order 3 times  and laughed and joked the entire time.
Taco Cabana,76,First thing in the morning and the pick de gallo is old and wilted - clearly from last night. The people did not attire me as friendly  or even clean. Eat here at your own peril. I can t inshore l imagine that the kitchen is in any better condition.
Taco Cabana,77,This is the worst Taco Cabana I ve ever been to   and its not my first time at this location .  I have had time to download the Yelp app  write a full review   post and I am still 4 cars behind. This is my first ever yelp review and I feel it is worth it if someone else doesn t get trapped in the same situation I m in  regretting every moment that led up to this one. Why did I come here     Why     Drive to another location. It s not worth it.
Taco Cabana,78,People here are very nice. Always chill and happy. Orders are made well and the salsa bar is just about the freshest I ve seen at a Cabana.  Been an rough road since opening  but I think they hit their stride. Good on ya TC.
Taco Cabana,79,Slowest service ever.  I ve been there twice and each time waited about 20 minutes for just two breakfast tacos. The lady in front of me asked for a refund because it was so slow.    I got a salt packet tore it open and nothing came out because the salt was all wet and clumped together.  This happened both times I was there.    They should fire the whole staff and start fresh because the only people with any urgency were the people waiting for the food trying to get to work on time.  I ve been to other Taco Cabanas so I know that I should get my tacos in just a couple minutes.  They have no excuse  this TC is not nearly as busy as the other one I go to  and the other one is literally ten times faster.
Taco Cabana,80,THe manager there is an A  . I placed an online order at 8 13 and it was supposed to be ready at 8 39am. I showed up at 8 30 and waited patiently and the manager goes  please wait your orderisn t done you just placed it.  my clock says 8 30 at this point . I did nt argue  just patient. At 8 40 I ask again what the status is and he gets annoyed and upset. He then accuses me of stealing a soda cup  when I clearly paid for it  and didn t even say sorry. I finally get my order  or I should say  he just plopped the bag on the counter and goes here it is. I get back to my office and my order is wrong. I ordered a bacon egg taco. a chicken fajita taco and a bacon egg buritto with guac which is extra. I got 2 bacon egg tacos and a potato burtito with extra cheese. I would call the restaurant but theire messaging system is booked. This location has Sucked since the day it got here. Never again   
Taco Cabana,81,This is the worst Taco Cabana I ve ever set foot in. Stale taco shells  horrible service  people working here don t give a shit   I hate this place.
Taco Cabana,82,Ok  I give up. I like Taco Cabana and the fact that there is one on my way to work is a bonus. However  the last couple times I have been there have been disappointments. Each time it was something  understaffed  computer not working  something going on with the drive thru. On top of that the food has been tasteless and barely warm. But the thing that really did it for me was watching the cashier move through the kitchen as if to prepare food with the same gloves she had on to take money.
Taco Cabana,83,Zero    Negative ten    Worse      Every bad review here- I have experienced and this is a just some icing on the cake ....  Get THIS                Bill is  14.01  I give her  15.    Wait for it....                  SHE USES A CALCULATOR TO FIND               HOW MUCH CHANGE TO GIVE ME BACK         I was so disgusted with this store that I arranged a meeting with the regional manager.  Went to meeting  no one there  no one even by that name     This place is a front for something.   It freakin  Twilight Zone    
Taco Cabana,84,Jason must ve been in line with me on Halloween night... The boyfriend and I were driving home down South Lamar when we noticed the new Taco Cabana was open. Having drank a lot earlier in the night  a pile of sour cream chicken enchiladas sounded like just the thing I wanted in my belly.   We pulled up into the drive-thru with only a few cars ahead of us and proceeded to wait for FORTY-FIVE MINUTES. This is seriously unacceptable for a fast food place. It was 2 in the morning and they are new  but they should have been compensating people for the incredibly long wait or at least apologizing for it..  Good thing I had someone with me or it would ve been way more irritating being literally stuck in line that entire time  you can t even change your mind and leave the line if you want  you re stuck there .  When we finally made it up to the ordering speaker  I discovered they no longer even HAVE the sour cream chicken. Not this location s fault  but a big annoyance that they didn t even have what I wanted after waiting for so long. Got the beef enchiladas instead and didn t realize that meant ground beef.. not my favorite from fast food places for obvious reasons.
Taco Cabana,85,Great location and for fast food great experience the staff were very pleasant. We are from out of town so the lady at the register explained how the menu and salsa bar worked and she had a great attitude about it and was so patient. And for that it gets five stars  
Taco Cabana,86,Came here to order a dozen breakfast taco box and was told it was 10.99  came in to order and it s 13.99  rude ass customer service. NEVER AGAIN. And they never gave us our second salsa.
Taco Cabana,87,We don t normally have problems eating here but today was the exception. They sold us soup but they were out of spoons to eat the soup with. Had to take the enchilada plate back because we couldn t we cut them with a knife. Lots of attitude from the staff like it was our fault.
Taco Cabana,88,Was so excited that Taco Cabana was opening at a location near my house as it s one of my favorite fast food places.   Been to the location four times  and while the food is the same  the customer service is AWFUL.   Drive-thru way too long and employees seem to have received little to no training in basic customer service and order taking.   Went inside early one evening and the girl cashier was squatting down under the register texting on her phone while I sat there wondering why no one was manning the register. Where was the manager  A few feet away  seemingly unconcerned or clueless. Oh but good news... he did have to come over to assist her in punching in my order because she didn t know how to do that.
Taco Cabana,89,I ve had no bad experiences with service here.  No encounters with homeless men and no rude cashiers.  However  I try to stick to the drive-thru.  I live across the street  so this location is particularly convenient if you just want something quick to eat.  The food is standard fare.  They make everything fresh with the lowest-quality ingredients money can buy. The pricing is good on some items  and outrageous on others.  The drinks  at least  are abnormally huge and you certainly won t be thirsty.  Best thing I can say is that the tortillas are fresh.  Everything else just reminds me that this place is only one very small step above Taco Bell.
Taco Cabana,90,They have a sign stating 5 dollar menu  but when you go in no one speaks English. No one knew about the 5. Menu. Orders are never right you ask to see the manager and they pretend that they don t understand. Buyers beware
Taco Cabana,91,I visited today at lunch  there was a long line  1 cashier and the food was prepared slowly. My friend and I ordered exactly the same menu item to go and her food was prepared and mine was not ready at the same time. When I questioned the cashier after waiting a while for my order  she rudely told me she was doing something and to go talk to someone else. The cashier should be terminated based upon rudeness  the kitchen staff needs more training and the dining room attendants who seem nice bit slightly challenged  need supervision. Taco Cabana is running a horrible operation at this location- avoid if possible  To the owner- you should refund me the cost of my meal and time.
Taco Cabana,92,Worst experience ever here this morning while hungover from the new year. Waited at the counter for 5 minutes before they were done talking in the kitchen and realized there was a customer waiting. Took 20 minutes to get me 2 bacon  egg  and cheese tacos. Two tacos. Twenty minutes. The tacos were not hot - not even close to warm - they were cold. The bacon was burned and each taco had a tiny pinch of cheese. A pinch  I paid for them to basically give me no cheese on my tacos. The tacos were too cold to even melt the cheese  or soften it  so it was pretty clear how much was actually added. How in the world can a business who sells tacos push such garbage  I ve been coming to this location for three years because of the proximity of my home. Never again.
Taco Cabana,93,I love TACO CABANA  but when I was visiting my friend in Austin  this location was just disgusting me. Extremely salty food  and dirty ingredients. Here is the pic of unwashed cilantro.
Taco Cabana,94,Just went here for the first time and they got my order wrong. I just moved here from California so I don t really know what places are good so when my boyfriend asked me to bring him a burrito at work I figured I would give this place a try because it has a drive-thru. There was one person ahead of me and they had already placed their order but it still took at least 10min for them to get their order and then I still had to wait a good 5min for my 2 burritos. I m assuming they got my bf s steak burrito right but I simply asked for bean  amp  cheese burrito with rice and sour cream  and they simplified it further by just giving me a damn bean  amp  cheese burrito  and it honestly doesn t taste that good-I wouldn t say it tastes bad but it s just off. Oh and the girl basically threw the bag at my face and mumbled have a good night as she slammed the window Depending on how my bf s burrito was I may give them another chance  but after this first time experience and seeing others  reviews I may not.
Taco Cabana,95,Im a frequent customer of this restaurant being that I live next door. On this recent visit the manager Daniel employee   920690 was highly rude and unprofessional to me. Upon ordering my food he first left in the middle of the transaction to do something in the back without having the courtesy of excusing himself. This was already highly rude then i asked for a water cup  he seemed hestitant so i began to grab the FREE water cup myself. He grabbed it out of my hand and placed it on the counter. Feeling completely humilated i simply took my ticket number and proceeded to get water. I see in the window that he was staring at me in the most unfriendly  odd  and uncomfortable fashion for no reason.To which I asked was there a problem or did i do something he went about saying  your food is coming out . I was like um okay and told him out of all of the times ive been coming here with him staring at me like that ive never felt so uncomfortable and i would definitely let someone from corporate know.  As I said before I live next door  and I will not be made to feel uncomfortable in my own neighborhood especially over a watercup and to an unprofessional employee who seems to hate his job to begin with  totally unacceptable
Taco Cabana,96,Since this store opened up  I ve come here three times  just to make sure I wasn t giving up on them too quickly. I wasn t. First time  well let s just say if you try and order anything in the drive through  that s includes any substitutions or special requests forget it. They seem too dumb and confused to get anything right. The first time I ordered nachos  all I did was ask for black beans and no meat  and they gave me black beams on plain tortilla chips without cheese or any other toppings  even after I specifically told them I wanted sour cream  guacamole  etc. the second time I ordered the same thinking it might have been a bad day. They got it better this time but I ckd my bag before I left and they forgot the cheese  Again  Then they made me wait 15 minutes in the parking lot and brought them out for me  again with no cheese So I had to wait another 10 mins for them to put cheese on and bring them back out. Wtf   Ok  so I thought I d give them another try but order inside thinking maybe they would do a better job if I was looking them in the face and explaining in no uncertain terms what I wanted. Ok I explain my order  come home and I swear  they put about 5 shreds of cheese on my nachos this time and gave me crumpled  bottom of the bag chips  I was outraged. I mean  it s not as if these things are cheap. I gave them three chances to make a good  loyal customer and they blew it. Three strikes and you re out  Taco Cabana. I Will NEVER eat at this or any other TC again. I can see from other reviews  I m not the only one. Why  out of all the great Mexican food in Austin did TC have to be the one to move in right next to me  
Taco Cabana,97,I typically enjoy taco cabana  but at this location I received bean and cheese tacos with no cheese and hard beans. I m used to having a good experience and I m really disappointed with this location.
Taco Cabana,98,Terrible customer service at the drive through. I was being very nice and the lady on the intercom was so impatient and rude. I canceled the order. Yeah it s a fast food place but if the employees openly show their disdain for customers simply placing orders  management needs to clean house.
Taco Cabana,99,I don t like this place. They were angry because I took like 2 minutes to decide what I want but I was the only person in line    Then they didn t even give me my rice and beans and that s what I really wanted. I had to go to bed with only mediocre chicken flautas in my belly and no rice and beans wtf is wrong with this country    
Taco Cabana,100,Disgusting cold tacos greeted me on my first visit to this dump. I ve had bad food. This was worse. Please don t eat here under any circumstance.
Taco Cabana,101,Taco Cabana   More like Diarrhea Cabana   I actually got decent service  whereas I was standing in line a minute and the dude rushed up to take my order.  I waited less than five minutes to get my food  which was a crunchy chicken burrito bowl  sans the tortilla .  I only ate half of it  since it was so greasy and was something like you d get at a cheap Mexican restaurant  which is actually what this restaurant is .  I called it Diarrhea Cabana since after I finished eating I felt my stomach get a bit upset  and I figure tomorrow I ll need to answer when I use the bathroom.  I stood at the counter and asked a chick working in back for a to-go box and she was polite and got me it promptly.  I m in no rush to return  but the service wasn t as terrible as others mentioned  luckily .
Taco Cabana,102,Will never go here again. They refused to serve cyclists through their drive thru  which is the only thing open at midnight  stating  safety reasons   which is obviously the opposite of using common sense   a  I can t conceal anything on the bike compared to a car.  b  I can t steal something and  drive off.  I m on a freaking bike   c  If I get really mad  I can t damage the store in any fashion. I would damage my bike first.  I m completely harmless on a bike  but they refused to serve me stating their  no cyclists  policy and even stated that people have gotten fired for serving cyclists   I will not give any restaurant my business for discriminating against people who can t afford a car or choose not to help create traffic 
Taco Cabana,103,There was not much cheese in my cheese enchilada. Seems like false advertising to me.
Taco Cabana,104,Love Taco C but the place hires some crappy late night staff. Haven t been there once late at night without one of the drive through tellers giving me attitude for NO reason.
Taco Cabana,105,I don t know why this location has bad reviews  this location is by far the best in town  always clean and amazing food when I visit. To all leaving bad reviews all I can tell you is to go to the 620 2222 location and see a really bad taco cabana. This location rocks 
Taco Cabana,106,I placed an order for a large group  11 pounds of chicken and 10 pounds of steak with the accompanying tortillas  beans  rice and toppings.  The food was ready when I arrived  the manager helped us load the containers into coolers and our vehicle.  The girls at the UT ADPi House loved the food   We received delicious food and attentive service  Great food at a great price  Would definitely go back   Thank You 
Taco Cabana,107,Just got back to my hotel room with my quesadilla and I am upset. Dude made me wait 5 minutes before taking my order  and then acted like I was the one taking too long. When I opened my meal in my room  no salsa  no guac  no sour cream. No utensils. Dude didn t even bother to ask. Unacceptable.
Taco Cabana,108,I ordered the enchilada plate that came with two crispy enchiladas.  Yes I said crunchy    Horrible.  I called the restaurant and informed them of the state of my food.  They could not care less....
Taco Cabana,109,I like TC  but this location isn t worth it. The drive thru takes forever and closed at times  the staff is rude and the orders are rarely correct.
Taco Cabana,110,Well idk where to start usually me and my girlfriend love taco cabana but this one we came inside no one was at the front cash register we waited for about 5 minutes then went to the side and the girl was just chatting with the cook then we order our food my gfs chicken cantina bowl looked disgusting and even tasted worse the beans were as hard as Plado and they barely put any rice in it and I believe the tomatoes were no longer good to serve I m just praying I don t get sick from this place and also the soda has some black material in it that we found not quite sure what that was I m just looking out for everyone else who loves taco cabana I would avoid this one for sure and I think the managers should really get a better girl to work the cash register and check there food before serving it to people have a great day everyone
Taco Cabana,111,I love Taco Cabana usually  but this is the slowest and most incompetently run location I have ever been to. The staff seems constantly overwhelmed  and there is never anybody at the counter when you arrive. There are tortillas all over the floor  which is unsanitary and sad because it s a beautiful brand new building. They have screwed up my order on multiple occasions. Taco Cabana corporate - notice all of these complaints on Yelp. It s ridiculous 
Taco Cabana,112,I m with everyone else--this place seriously sucks.  Don t even bother.  This is definitely the worst Taco C location in Austin  which is so disappointing  since I live right down the street.  The customer service is horrible.  The employees are rude  and every single time I ve went there  they get my order wrong and I wait at least 20 minutes.  Last Thursday  I went--and ordered a very simple order.  Small chips and queso  large size cheese quesadilla  and the sopapillas.  What i ended up with was  chips and queso  yay   a STEAK quesadilla  personal size    and the sopapillas without the dulce or the honey.  Taco C Fail.
Taco Cabana,113,This place is terrible and needs to be shut down. After swearing to never eat at this new location I broke down one evening after being sick and desperate and as expected it was horrible. The food was so bad that I couldn t even eat more than two bites. I won t even mention the less than par service. Please close down Taco Cabana.
Taco Cabana,114,Believe the reviews  Service sucked     Cashier was rude for no apparent reason. The food was not good and happy hour ends at 7.
Taco Cabana,115,This is the worst fast food place I ve ever been to. The staff is surly and rude  and it took 10 minutes for someone to step over to the counter to take my order. Then when I tried to get a margarita pitcher for happy hour I was told they didn t have any available pitchers  but there were no pitchers on any tables in the restaurant.   Having had a pitcher at taco cabana in the past  I knew you get 3-4 small cups per pitcher. So I asked the cashier Also the manager on duty  if we could just get 3 small cups for the price of a pitcher. After he took my money  he insisted a pitcher held only 2 small cups of margarita. When I tried to politely correct him he rolled his eyes and said that it wasn t true.   I would highly suggest going literally anywhere else but here...anywhere.
Taco Cabana,116,Looks like they re open at 1105 pm but doors are locked. No sign about hours or what the situation is. Seems to be closed. Total waste of time. This brand is taking a dive as I have many memories of late night meals.
Taco Cabana,117,I swear  I m pretty sure the cashier we had was on drugs. I went to this location last weekend. When I got to the front of the line  my girlfriend placed her order  the cashier gives a completely blank look  stares at the register for about a full minute  presses about 10 buttons and says  uhh  what did you want again  . After repeating the order 3 times  and the cashier still didn t put  no onions  on there   we finally got our order in. The order was  12.xx  so I gave her  23 to get a  10 back. Standard thing to do  right  Apparently not. She takes the  23  stuffs the 3  1 bills in the register  takes out a  5 and two  1s and hands them to me.  Uh  no  I gave you  23. I should get a  10 back.   Oh  really  Oh  uh  okay.   She then proceeds to take out what looks like almost all of the money from the register and counts for at least a minute  then hands me back incorrect change AGAIN. I tried to correct her  but she insisted that she was right  since it was in my favor and I have better things to be doing than holding up the line by arguing with someone who doesn t understand basic math  I let it go.  So  we finally sit down. We wait for about 20 minutes for our food  this was not even during peak hours   and  wouldn t you know it  my girlfriend s order is wrong. And to add to the entertainment  we observed the same cashier wandering around the dining room aimlessly  and at one point trying to give food to a table that had already gotten theirs  and didn t have a number sign on their table.  Despite the comical story that I ve had the pleasure of telling family and friends  I don t think I ll be back anytime soon.
Taco Cabana,118,Unacceptably slow  and the manager had the damned nerve to tell me after i had informed her that i had been in line for 45 minutes that i had only been waiting for 13 minutes. So apparently i am a liar. Nice. If this is how business will be conducted  i can assure you this place will not be around for long. This place has been open for less than a week and if i want TC i will make the drive the 15 minutes out of my way  even though this one is less than two minutes from home.
Taco Cabana,119,I was completely sober and in normal working condition  so I can honestly say that I had no part to play in the events that take place next  It was just before midnight  there was nobody in line in front of me and when I told the lady my order  she repeated it back to me entirely wrong  never realized I said flauta plate and not 3-pack  amp  thought I said quesadilla with pico instead of without   and I had to repeat it back to her twice. Then before she gave me the food  she repeated the order back to me wrong AGAIN and I had to correct her AGAIN  and THEN the worst part is that she forgot the queso for my flautas and the Guac for my friends  quesadilla AFTER WE HAD A 2 MINUTE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW I WANTED QUESO WITH MY FLAUTAS as opposed to guacamole. So I had no dipping sauce for my flautas which are good but dry as hell. So basically  we were mistreated and did not at all get the service we deserve and hope for. Needless to say  you messed with my queso  so we will not be returning to this location.
Taco Cabana,120,This place sucks.  Got trapped in the drive thru line for 35 minutes only to get an incomplete order.  This place can t go out of business fast enough.
Taco Cabana,121,So I hate coming here but sometimes it s just so egging quick to pick up   which it takes forever to get your food so not too quick  the employees are so rude I drove up and no one was in line and she made me sit and wait for awhile before a man got on there and he said welcome to taco cabana never apologized for making me wait and then I had to wait forever for my food 
Taco Cabana,122,If you were to take any poor service story ever written   from any restaurant ever.. Then multiply it times 10.. thats what you are going to get here. If you intend on going through the drive through give yourself a sold 35 minutes. Especially if you are on a lunch break  just go ahead and tell your boss you will be late before you even leave.
Taco Cabana,123,TC is great. It s consistent  tasty  texmex. It s food is nearly the same everywhere and this location is exactly like the ones I remember from back home. Some others have commented on the poor service  I am here on a busy Sunday morning and I received great service  The cashier Jaliyah was very attentive and helpful. She did a great job maintaining the dining room and taking care of customers. I will definitely be back to this location 
Taco Cabana,124,Where s the option for zero stars when you need it  I digress... First time to this location  it looks nice and clean on the outside but inside there weren t any clean tables on the indoor outdoor patio space despite there only being 2 other customers there. Salt was all over the counter next to the soda fountain  cashier was just ok but forgot the sides to the nachos then brought out warm sour cream  pico looked gross. Never returning to this one...

Taco Cabana,125,These guys really made my day a lot worse. I run a crew of eight guys. I ordered the food 30 minutes in advance so I can swing by and pick it up and get back to my crew. When I got there they hadn t even started on my order. I had to wait 30 minutes in the store just to get the food. A late lunch makes unhappy crew. They told me it was because they were too busy. They didn t seem too busy to put all the people ahead of me with higher priority. If my order came in 30 minutes before then they should have made it a priority
Taco Cabana,126,Worst taco caba a  ever I had to get my money back after waiting 40min for my food to add  insault the girl that servces the food threw my food with anger on my plate f-that if iam Pay for food i should aleast get good service i wish could give it a big fat fail  this place really really sucks I will tell all my office freinds never ever go thire i only feel sorry for the owner that his place us going down because of the pepole he or she hires
Taco Cabana,127,Be prepared to wait a few years before your food is ready.  This goes for dine in and drive thru.  At first I I figured it was a one time thing  but nope.  For instance  Im in the drive thru with my car turned off right now.  Been waiting about 10 minutes so far with only 2 customers ahead of me.  The dining room appears to be vacant. The store is clearly not managed well.
Taco Cabana,128,Will never eat there again   The hours of the restaurant are clearly posted outside the door of the restaurant and indicates that they are open every night until midnight.  I had not yet finished my meal when at 11 40 pm  20 minutes before close    on Saturday night  Sep. 23  2017  an employee rudely and without warning turned off all lights of the dining area.   One other customer was also in the restaurant at the time.   This left the restaurant nearly pitch black with the only a little light coming from the kitchen.  When I asked the restaurant employee for confirmation of the store hours  he rudely turned his back towards me and refused to give me an answer. -  Additionally  the restaurant employee refused to let me out the main door which had been locked from the inside.  Instead  I had to walk back through the dark restaurant and let myself out an auxiliary exit on the patio.  HORRIBLE 
Taco Cabana,129,Oh gosh  well I just left a movie after spending all day driving from Oklahoma for Christmas break and Taco Bell down the road closed early at 9 45  very odd . so I cruise around til last on the options comes taco cabana. Now after eating at over 12 different locations I came to ends meet and swore never again would I step foot in a taco cabana as I have never recieved such poor service or quality tasting food every time I went  but this was a new location looked very clean and when it s a new location  the food should look as good as the restaraunt  right  it s 10 53  I walk in really in the mood for some late night breakfast tacos. I ve always known they serve breakfast from 11p-11a  so I ask if I could order tacos now or wait 8 min til it is finally 11. Some businesses really take the order service times seriously with no before or after. this is one of those places. the cashier walks up and without even saying hi  how are you or what can I get started for you. it s just  this for here or to go  ...ahhhh..here. I guess. I mean why the hell not the place looks nicer than my living room. I ask if I can get breakfast and she doesn t know if it s 11 or 11 30 start time  so she goes to ask the cook. I thought when your work register your supposed to know these types of things  it s like if a mom asked if the nachos had jalepenos she would need to know more importantly than the cook. she comes back to say he doesn t know if he ll be ready by 11. If I was with corporate TC  secret shop  eating here this place would be f cked due to that it s supposed to start at 11 not when the cook feels like it or has the proper materials to cook so. Ok  so the chickens forgot to lay their eggs last night and they forgot to tell Jose breakfast is 11-11  not just 6-9. So I order a small enchilada plate. I get the plate I order a cheese enchilada  I get a beef enchilada. not only that the tortilla that came with it was stale as well as the enchilada being hard as rock. What the hell happened to TC  They spent a lot of money remodeling all the stores  but it s still sloppy service and awful tasting plates that don t taste hand made fresh. You couldn t entice me back to this place if you had Heidi Klum and her VS Angels cooking up the food or a year of free food. Corporate really needs to fix this other than cleaning up a few of the stores otherwise I don t think they are going to survive the Mexican food battle that has been going on for the last 5 years in Austin on where to find the best Mexican dishes. A Manuel s Express restaraunt would be nice as the service and the food every time I ve been in the last 15 years has always been superb top notch  Nothing has really changed about this place other than your high hopes and expectations for what was once a great place to eat in the  90s.
Taco Cabana,130,When this place first opened they never got anything right.   If I werent obsessed with TC I would have never been back.  I think they might be under new managment because they are doing much better now.
Taco Cabana,131,I was in a hurry and needed something quick and being mostly vegan I dont eat meat hence the reason i come here to taco cabana instead of other fast food places because they have things I can actually eat. well i ordered two black bean tacos and waiting for my food i seemed to catch a funny vibe like i was the center attraction for some kind of joke... well I got my food and pulled away i was wondering before i even opened the tacos if i should even eat them because i felt that someone did something to my food the way they were acting and looking at me. Well as i pulled away I checked my tacos and at that point i knew what was up the tacos we re both steak tacos with meat only. I felt horrible that they would think someone being hungry and needing some food is an opportunity to play a joke on someone. i never called back in and from now on I go inside to get my food. Ill just say that taco cabana is lucky i still eat there sometimes but I know I will never come to this location on N Lamar ever again
Taco Cabana,132,arrived at taco cabana all excited about getting my food it was 9 25p  6 16 2014 i drove up to window to pay and i see 2 employees playing in the background and then to top it off they were playing with the styrofoam plate that they were about to put my enchildas in and the girl had flour all over her cause the guy was playing with her in the kitchen hell they just needed to book a room then the cashier was playing also chasing each other come on man i dont have time for that just wanted my food and go home i have never had a problem with this taco cabana newly built excited that it was close to the house but the service has gone out the window then i wrote about this and got no response from taco cabana themselves
El Huarache 2 Food Truck,1,Amazing food. Had their carnitas  barbacoa and carne asda tacos - delicious.   Family had time to play a quick game of jenga while our food was being made.   Must try if you re in the area.
El Huarache 2 Food Truck,2,Love this spot  The carnitas were bomb  tostadas were tasty. 15  for 3 tacos and  3 mini tostadas a steal 
El Huarache 2 Food Truck,3,I ve lived in Mexico City so the bar is a pretty high for tacos. This location is great for late night tacos. I enjoyed the al pastor tacos and the added potato s were unique. Really hard working  nice people. It s worth your time going here
El Huarache 2 Food Truck,4,Exceptional tacos and at a reasonable price  A great addition to the Domain  Came by for dinner and tried the El Pastor and the Carnitas. The pastor was good  but those Carnitas tacos SLAP  The flour tortillas were homemade and they actually finish the carnitas on the plancha to give them a little bit of crisp. Two homeade salas  a sprinkling of cilantro and onion  and a squeeze of lime makes these tacos   chef s kiss   perfect 
El Huarache 2 Food Truck,5,My husband and I went here a couple nights ago. He ordered the Tuesday Taco deal  5 mini tacos  and I had the burrito bowl with chicken. They brought us the three sauces salsas and after a freak accident  the lid popped off and ALL of the salsa went all over his tacos. They ran right over with napkins and offered to clean it up. And then they gave him free replacement tacos--yay 
Ole Taco,1,Outstanding taco truck. I had the Barbacoa and al pastor and both were very flavorful  freshly made  and hot. Great service as well. Definitely one of the best food trucks I ve been to in Austin.
Ole Taco,2,One of the best Carne Asada tortas I ve had in a long time  Full of flavor and so fresh 
Ole Taco,3,Top notch taco truck   Friendly  to boot   Alambres taco rocks. I got a bean  cheese  ham    amp  egg also. Great salsas  
Ole Taco,4,I ve been going here for about 2 years. I feel bad but I didn t want to share this badass taco spot with the public because I m selfish and don t want it to become a notable place on Yelp . After deliberating I feel this dude deserves this little taco truck to become the hottest place in town. If you re looking for a drive thru speedy pickup for tacos this isn t your place. If you can plan ahead  give the dude 30 min.  or more to make your breakfast lunch before showing up. They are piping hot every damn time. The salsas are both legit which is a must for a go-to taco spot. Everything is so inexpensive for what you get and the attention and time he puts into each persons meal is crazy - I tend to tip extra fat  He deserves this review because this man works hard  has a great attitude  and makes awesome food.
