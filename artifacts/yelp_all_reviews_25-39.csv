Radio Coffee & Beer,1,This is a great spot to hangout with friends with a cup of your favorite coffee. Not too noisy so you can hear each other and indoor outdoor seating so you can chill here in any weather   Great coffee and drink options to choose from as well.  The barista screwed up my macchiato order and gave it to me a small espresso cup but immediately fixed it when I told them that it was not what I ordered.  Not quite the neat leaf design that I wanted on my coffee but I wouldn t hold him to it.
Radio Coffee & Beer,2,Cool vibey coffee shop.   Quality service and quick with it.  Tried the matcha latte with oat milk - I like that it s not too sweet. Very authentic matcha    Very popular place so parking is hard.
Radio Coffee & Beer,3,This was my first time visiting Radio and I can t wait to come back  The gentleman that took my coffee order was very pleasant as well as helpful. I asked for his suggestion for a coffee that would make me want to come back  no parameters. He nailed it. I got a vanilla latte with whole milk and it was so smooth with a hint of sweetness.  This is something that I never would have ordered on my own  as vanilla is normally way too sweet for me  but this was really good   So much more to try  more coffees  teas  beer  amp  cocktails. They have a huge patio too  I can t wait to come back with friends 
Radio Coffee & Beer,4,Love the vibes and the ambiance of this place  It s has generous seating inside and also has a pet friendly and spacious patio  I m not too familiar with their coffee offerings but I did have their chai tea and it was really good  although it was quite sweet for my liking. All the staff are very friendly and offer their honest opinions on each of their menu items. This would be a great place if you re WFH but inside dining might be a little noisy if it s busy so bring headphones  Overall  a really great experience for those wanting a chill afternoon at a coffee shop 
Radio Coffee & Beer,5,So far I ve only had a coffee  but it was perfect. What kind of coffee was it  No idea  I asked for a large super sweet iced coffee  they delivered brilliantly. I received a super chocolate iced heaven that woke me right up before I even got half way through. Highly recommend 
Radio Coffee & Beer,6,Great vibe  full bar menu  and cozy atmosphere. Parking can be a little tough  but there is street parking nearby and additional parking around the back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,7,I came here for a Yelp event and it was a super quaint and hopping venue. I ordered a hot chocolate on this cool fall day and it was delicious. The service was super fast and the people were friendly. I will definitely be back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,8,This is one chill spot. I ve been here twice  one to see Mama Duke and later for a Meetup. As a sober person  their drink menu is unparalleled. They offer nonalcoholic beer  and can make a virgin version of many of their cocktails. I went with a Virgin Phantom Mood. Refreshing and light  perfect to sit outside and sip on their expansive patio.   The patio is very comfy even in summer  with chillers and outdoor fans circulating the air. They have food trucks on site  I enjoyed amazing tacos from Vera Cruz Tacos.   This is just a homey and local neighborhood spot with frequent events  a trivia night  and a bluegrass night I can t wait to check out. My only caveats are  the flies and mosquitoes are insane. They bit me all night  and it was just not fun at all. The patio would be well served by adding citronella candles or offering Off Spray - something to abate the bugs. With the great outdoor circulation  they did just feast on my legs but it was just awful.   One other minor issue  I ordered one NA drink and closed and tipped at the end of the evening. I checked my credit card next and they had a pending prehold of  25  an extremely high authorization hold  honestly. It was pending and never posted  but it did take 4 days to drop off. Just something to keep in mind  I m not sure if the hold applies to debit cards  and no it didn t post  but it was certainly a little frustrating since my drink was  8. I d be reticent to use a credit card again if that were the authorization  and certainly something to keep in mind if you use a debit and aren t expecting a hold that high.   These small issues won t stop me from returning. I m a pedestrian and had no idea to park  the venue is located right next to the Westgate Transit Center and an easy walk. It s just truly a chill and inclusive spot with an old Austin feel. The most expansive sober menu I ve ever seen  numerous events  a community board with many tantalizing other ideas including a ladies  night. I ve been by a hundred times but never stopped by. I won t make that mistake again  it is truly a community center bringing together all walks of life with sober and alcoholic drinks aplenty  truly all are welcome. I am so happy they are here to bring Austin together.
Radio Coffee & Beer,9,Radio is what you think of when you want to hang out on a nice patio. They ve got everything you need   Covered cooled patio - check Coffee and or beer - check Dog friendly - check  Great people watching - check Telework practicality- check  Book reading feasibility- check Delicious food options - triple check b c they ve got Briscuits  Vera Cruz tacos and Dee Dee  I had Vera Cruz tacos- SO AMAZING  I ordered a chorizo  egg  amp  cheese taco and added potatoes and it was quite possibly the best I ve ever had.   Easy ordering of the food by ordering online or at the counter  Easy drink ordering via QR code or at the counter. I ordered a lavender latte and they had mushroom milk  Breve as an option. First time trying it and now I wish I could get it everywhere.  There are also a ton of boozy coffee options if you re interested.   It should be noted I went here during the late morning  early afternoon. I ll have to return to check out the night time and live music vibe.
Radio Coffee & Beer,10,Nice to grab a coffee or mixed drink and depending on time some live music. Feels very Austin 
Radio Coffee & Beer,11,The coffee was good. Operationally  they could do more to get drinks out faster. I went on a very busy day  and the wait was about 20-22 minutes for coffee after waiting in a long line. It was definitely a fun atmosphere. But the baristas seem stressed  and possibly overwhelmed. Looking at their flow  I could see areas for improvement  to help their staff and the customers at the same time. But good tasting coffee and their outdoor seating environment is definitely very Austin  And very cool. Food trucks had great food as well.
Radio Coffee & Beer,12,Such a happenin  spot to grab coffee  cocktails  coffee-cocktails  food truck eats  hang with the dogs  work study  listen to live music  watch live comedy  play trivia... all the things  This indoor-outdoor and covered and tented patio venue offers a lot  including parking  so if nothing on this list appeals to you  errr  try Starbucks    My GF and I dropped in with two dogs  and we ordered up a carajillo  they put cinnamon on theirs  and an espresso martini. Both great. The only downside of that particular experience was the QR code ordering from your table was down  so we had to order at the counter. Not heartbreaking  just a minor inconvenience with pets in tow.   Check out their calendar of events.
Radio Coffee & Beer,13,Cool outdoor seating--open late--came here after lighting it up at Easy Tiger.  Great drink selection and nice bartenders.  You can dwell inside too for a seat  but I like being outside.  Dog friendly outside.  There s a food truck too.  Pretty local feel--genuine.  5 stars.
Radio Coffee & Beer,14,This is one of the first places I stopped to get coffee at in Austin. The inside is so adorable. The coffee is strong and delicious. I was so shocked that you were able to bring dogs inside  there were dogs everywhere.   There are food trucks outside with the most amazing breakfast tacos - my friend had the pro tip  that you can order your tacos from the food truck online so when you get there  they are already ready for you   When I think of Austin  I think of this place.
Radio Coffee & Beer,15,I was confused for a bit on how this placed worked but after walking around I quickly figured it out. Placed perfectly in front of a couple of food trucks. Loads of outdoor seating with fans. Pet friendly and kid friendly. The atmosphere was superb. Coffee was delicious 
Radio Coffee & Beer,16,I love this place   I spent a day here working remote and enjoyed their coffee  beer  and the taco truck outside.  I plan to come back again soon.
Radio Coffee & Beer,17,There s a popular saying among locals to  keep Austin weird  which is fine and all  but where does one experience weird  What defines it  Well  I have been on a crusade since moving here in June 2021 to experience Austin with a fervor of exploration akin to that of a high school boy on prom night. I ve been to several places and some are close to capturing it but I think I ve found the very essence of the phrase  Radio Coffee  amp  Beer on a Monday or  blue grass  music night was a treat. This was the most eclectic group of individuals in one place which filled in my thought bubble with  a modern melting pot of Americana .  First parking sucks  I drove around several times until I found a space which I debated if I would be towed or not  but I decided to throw caution to the Texas wind. Walking up  I can t recall what hit me first  the low-key fa ade of brick  tents and wood for the establishment  the plethora of individuals sitting at picnic tables or standing in food beer lines or the amalgamation of smells from different foods. Oh I did love the big trees in the courtyard  not only does it bring shade but an element of heightened nature in the middle of town.   Generally I m flying solo or with a date for the night  but this was a bit different  I was meeting a group of likeminded individuals I hooked up with on the meetup app so I was a bit apprehensive about mine own company. However my group was a microcosm  running parallel  to the overall assembly. Different groups of individuals juxtaposed each other with perfect harmony. Young hippies next to older business patrons  elderly in flip flops hanging out with body builders  artistically and free minded laughing with middle class families and their kids down to strollers. Oh and dogs  lots of nice  well-mannered cute dogs of all sizes. It all worked in a  keep Austin weird way  of which I think I m starting to understand.   As for the food and drinks  the lines are brutal.  I saw one lady in the burger line as I came back with a nice  cold pint of Hefeweizen. I had to work Tues so I nursed my beer however when I got up to get another  I noticed the poor young lady was still in line  teased by the tantalizing smell and hope she d soon be served. Inside was rather barren  other than the long line for coffee and drinks. One can order ahead via an app  but regardless it takes a while. My suggestion is get two or more rounds while in line  trust me.  Normally I d pontificate about food since I have a culinary background but alas  I wasn t about to spend my night in food lines. So  please read other reviews on that  but it smelled great    The music was down home  toe tapping  relaxing and allowing people to forget their troubles  creating a perfect ambiance to talk to stranger or get lost in the vibe. The 4 person blue grass band really fit the spirit of the venue or vice versa  either way a match made in Austin. I found myself intrigued by my group and their various backgrounds while chatting with others whom I just met. Oh there was the typical dancing and I was disappointed as I didn t see any devil or fire stix get broken out  but perhaps I ll try that next time.    I m a people person I love to watch  observe and meet people and hear their story. Radio Coffee and Beer is a great place to accomplish this in a safe  friendly setting. The music is wonderful and maintains the vibe so diligently created by the owners and patrons alike. Rustic yet trendy  grounded yet edgy this is a great place to hang out minus the lines. If they could put a few food trucks up and an outside bar this might solve that issue. However  if you plan ahead  problem solved. So  if you re like me and want to experience Austin  give this place a shot and enjoy a well-crafted atmosphere and or beer 
Radio Coffee & Beer,18,Absolute madhouse  trying to park here. It was so busy... and all s we wanted was a decent cappuccino...  Mission accomplished  Definitely worth all the troubles. They make an excellent cappuccino. Great roaster in a city full of great roasters.
Radio Coffee & Beer,19,A good place to chill and work if you want  in a group  There was a lot of spaces outside to sit and they have two lots for parking. I also like that they have qr codes to order from outside     The coffee was yummy  service was fast and wifi was fast enough to work from  I would come back here to check out their cocktails and events.
Radio Coffee & Beer,20,I have been here a few times  but I have not reviewed it. Weird.   I stopped here to meet up with a friend for some coffee. Parking has always been a pain here. Luckily I have handicapped parking  so I can park right upfront.   My friend and I opted to have our coffee inside the bar area as it was quite hot and humid outside. She ordered a latte  and I ordered an iced coffee. Overall the drinks were good  and the service was great.  There is some food available at the drink counter  but your best option is to check out the food truck. We didn t eat anything  but I would definitely think about ordering some tacos in the future.
Radio Coffee & Beer,21,As someone who grew up in Dallas  Radio is what I always imagined when I thought of  Austin . To me  this place is one of THE quintessential Austin experiences  up there with South Congress  Homeslice  Toyjoy  bats  the capitol  etc.  Radio has consistently great coffee  and a vast selection of other drinks and cocktails. Also not to be missed- the food trucks in residence in the same lot. Of these  Briscuits is such a standout  One of my favorite places to grab a drink  chill outside  and just soak it all in  Only a couple downsides  parking SUCKS and there s usually really long lines.
Radio Coffee & Beer,22,Espresso is good. Parking is horrible. Irritating to find a spot. Will not go back. Had to park in back next to a fan from a smokehouse. Now my car stinks.
Radio Coffee & Beer,23,I love the coffee and the ambiance. Parking can be tricky but worth it to me. I usually go after the gym and get an iced latte and people watch. The folks working there are very nice Abdo friendly as well.  There s live music on the stage outside occasionally which only furthers how great this place is.
Radio Coffee & Beer,24,Food was delicious  coffee was strong  which I love  and environmentally it was friendly
Radio Coffee & Beer,25,There are so many great things about Radio   The inside is pretty spacious and I love the extensive outdoor seating.  I went on a super hot day  but was able to sit outside because they had cooling sprinkler fans going. They have lots of coffee beer options and pastries.   Downside  the parking is awful  There is limited lot parking and lots of cars competing for the same spot that opens up. Parking lot road rage anyone   There isn t much street parking either. So plan to loop around for awhile or walk from a ways away.
Radio Coffee & Beer,26,I absolutely adore this place and try to visit when I am in town. The whole establishment just screams Austin.   I love that it is in its own section with food trucks outside in case you are hungry. I was lucky enough to have came about an hour before sunset so I was able to enjoy the Austin heat  Sunset  and then nightlife of Radio Coffee  amp  Beer. And just as you would imagine  you can get coffee and Beer. I know that sounds like a stomach ache but I was absolutely fatigued and got a thai tea upon arriving. We didnt plan to stay long and I needed a caffein boost. As I finished my drink  a band was getting ready to set up and the sun was setting and at that point I had all the energy I needed to get a cocktail.   Their beverages and atmosphere is great for an after work happy hour.
Radio Coffee & Beer,27,had breakfast tacos here last Sunday..food was incredible..so good..never had breakfast tacos before...fresh tasty spicy if u want it...prices awesome..fun spot with outdoor tables enclosed with heat lamps if needed..worth the visit again and again..thank you
Radio Coffee & Beer,28,Coolest place on the planet. This is a rhetorical statement as I have not yet been to every place on the planet. Quintessential Austin. Great lattes  beer and food trucks. Lots of outdoor seating and parking in back. Great mix of young and old patrons.
Radio Coffee & Beer,29,Love it here  Stopped by for a coffee and to read my book during a lunch break. The iced mocha with oat milk was delicious. Lots of seating inside and outside which is good since there were tons of people working   studying. Great decor and cute vibes inside and out as well. There s food trucks as well to grab a bite if you re hungry. Parking can get tight  but there s more around the back. Will be back 
Radio Coffee & Beer,30,TLDR  some really awesome vibes and a great tap wall.  Came here with some friends for the weekly trivia night. The back patio area was really nice. we got to enjoy it both before and after the event. it s really well spaced and has good lighting for an outdoor area. I didn t get to try any of the coffee  So I can t testify to that. however  they do have a great tap wall  mostly local  with a lot of variety. I also got to try a couple of the cocktails  and they did a pretty solid job with them.   all in all  a great place for a low key couple of drinks. 4.25 5.
Radio Coffee & Beer,31,First and foremost  don t let the parking situation scare you. There s two other lots around the property--don t ask me how to get to them--and on Sunday you can park in front of Tire Man  cool guys  btw .   As soon as you walk onto the premises you realize it s about twice as big as it looks from the street. The coffee aspect was simple but efficient and the food truck selection was perfect for a Sunday morning  biscuits and tacos  what else do you want   The people watching was great and the everyone I ran into was nice and friendly.
Radio Coffee & Beer,32,This is a cool spot. I had a bad espresso drink from another cafe that required immediate rehabilitation so I stopped by Radio. Lovely outdoor seating. Folks behind the counter chatting with customers but I got noticed and served pretty quickly. They have solid espresso. Crisis averted.   Only downside  and not worth taking a star  is limited parking. Even on a Wednesday early PM the parking spots were all taken  this town appears to have a lot of young retirees . I didn t have a problem finding a spot down the street but if it was genuinely busy I could see parking being an issue.
Radio Coffee & Beer,33,A friend mentioned bluegrass night at this place  so we came to check it out. Purchased tic through Eventbrite  pre-ordered some tacos from the Veracruz taco truck  bummed the Cajun and Thai trucks weren t open that evening   and got drinks from the bar.   We checked in  told to find a socially-distanced-table with the number of chairs we needed  then sat back and enjoyed. The music and ambiance were fantastic. Will be back   Parking was a little crazy  but I think some of the shops next door allow you to park in their lots after hours.
Radio Coffee & Beer,34,Is there anything better than sitting on a patio with your dog and a nice cup of jo  Maybe a frosty pint. It s a great spot when the weather decides to have a good day that you can sit outside with your pups and enjoy the sunshine and live music.
Radio Coffee & Beer,35,Went here for breakfast and coffee. Really awesome vibes  There was a lot of outdoor seating and they provide water bowls for dogs  so super pet friendly. There were two food trucks open at the time - Briscuit and Veracruz All Natural  but we got Briscuit. As for drinks  my partner got their kombucha on tap and I got a cold brew. Here are our thoughts   Briscuit - brisket sandwich -- my partner really enjoyed this flavor combination of a buttery biscuit that sandwiches brisket and peach jam. He said it wasn t too greasy and was refreshingly unique take.  Briscuit - tomato  egg and cheese biscuit sandwich  -- I thought the sandwich was very good  but what makes it is the great soft egg scramble and the smoked strawberry jam I ordered on the side. Great option for vegetarians   Kombucha on tap - my partner says it was refreshing and not as sour as other kombuchas he has had  and recommends it   Cold brew  black - I thought it wasn t anything special. Definitely had better cold brews in the past that tasted good and had stronger caffeine effects. It tasted kinda watered down.  Ambiance - looks like a great place to just hangout  study and work. Again  love the vibes 
Radio Coffee & Beer,36,This is a cute cozy place but parking is horrible  hit or miss  - best to car pool or Uber. I stopped by with a friend for lunch - small bites and drinks - overall solid experience.
Radio Coffee & Beer,37,This was my second time at Radio Coffee and it was even better than the last time  The owners have truly built something special  I love their outside area with the seemingly unlimited amount of seating  fairy lights strung above and just the overall vibe that I get here. The staff are super cool which is always the first thing I take note of  I appreciate when someone has great people skills.   Parking isn t too bad  they have space out front  as well as behind the building. However  on really busy nights  prepare to find street parking.   The drinks  10 10. I m really picky when it comes to mixed drinks and the bartenders and Radio Coffee definitely understood the assignment  every drink I ve had here tasted amazing and was 100  on point.  It was in the high 90 s when we went but luckily there are tons of fans spraying mist everywhere  it was AMAZING.   Honey Made played for a couple of hours on the stage outside and it really tied the experience together nicely for me. Radio Coffee is definitely somewhere I m excited to visit again.
Radio Coffee & Beer,38,I ve been going here ever since I moved back to Austin  5-6 years ago. I ve been through it s ups and downs but am glad to leave a new updated review of 5-stars.   Yes  this place gets busy  especially on weekends. The parking  the wait times  the lines--you should expect it. But I don t see it as a lack of service  it s just because this place is so good  They have tons of space and staff  it s just always full of customers. So prepare yourself for that ahead of time to have a better experience.   Anyway  I love this place. There is tons of outdoor seating with gorgeous trees for shade  a tented area  a covered area  and inside seating as well. There are three different food trucks to choose from  Veracruz being the biggest and most popular. The coffee bar itself is great with lots of drink options  both coffee and alcoholic. They also have some baked goodies    I ve had spotty customer service in the past  but it seems to be a thing of the past  Everyone working the register and bar were super friendly and helpful. Like so kind and made a killer mimosa and dirty chai. So glad to report that    They got gf df options  the ambience is great  and the service is sweet--what more can you want for your saturday morning  
Radio Coffee & Beer,39,Radio Coffee is such a cute place and has the perfect beer garden vibe. I went in to grab a quick coffee on my way to work and know I ll be going back for drinks at some point. I got a lavender vanilla oat milk latte and it was really good but I d probably try some of their other menu items in the future. It s in south Austin  so if you re in the area definitely add it to your list for a coffee or beer stop.
Radio Coffee & Beer,40,Visiting my daughter in Austin and came for coffee and the mandatory breakfast taco from a food truck. Online ordering was great at both but coffee took a while and food took longer lol. I really enjoyed the atmosphere  Coffee was good and the burrito taco was amazing  
Radio Coffee & Beer,41,I love to meet up with friends here for breakfast and a coffee. They are packed on weekends  but don t let the tiny front parking lot fool you. They have a back parking lot with the entrance located just north of Radio Coffee  past the small house.    Once inside of their large indoor coffee bar  their baristas will whip up anything within their power  using their house RCB Roasters coffee. From experience  they make a mean macchiato and iced espresso.   Radio Coffee is not just for coffeetotalers  they also serve libations. For weekend mornings - that means mimosas  They will mix up one of their signature Cocktails  with local spirits like a Sotol Silver  Rita featuring Desert Door and a Paris  TX mixed up with Still Austin Gin. More into wine  They have a small selection of respectable wines that will satisfy an array of palates  2 reds  2 whites  1 rose  1 sparkling-Stella di Notte Prosecco  and 1 Sake . If beer or cider is your jam  you will be pleased with the 14 they have on tap  including appearances from 512  St. Elmo  and Austin Beerworks.   If sitting indoors is not your style  grab your beverage of choice and an outdoor table in their massive kid- and dog-friendly outdoor courtyard with plenty of options for sun or shade and large or small tables.   Hungry  They have three food trucks surrounding their outdoor courtyard including Vera Cruz All Natural and Briscuits. Vera Cruz is always busy. Pro-tip  get there before 9 AM on a weekend  and order your food first to avoid a hangry long wait.   Radio Coffee is that perfect slice of Austin showcasing the best of Austin s relaxed quirkiness  coolness  and eclectic local vibe. So grab an outdoor table and relax while enjoying the Austin ambiance only Radio Coffee can provide.
Radio Coffee & Beer,42,Stopped by on a whim  the atmosphere drew me in. It s very much an Austin vibe  coffee is fantastic  I had the ch vre and mushroom danish  which was perfect. If this place can lift even my mood  they re doing something right.
Radio Coffee & Beer,43,Very cool venue  If you re looking for a place to chill outdoors in a big group or small  this is the place for you  They also have the indoor option  but limited space and only small group tables.  I tried their coffee and it was good  I didn t try anything at the bar  but it was very busy on a Friday afternoon  lots of people in line for both bar and coffee.  I was a little disappointed that only Veracruz taco truck was open  but I presume that s not radio coffee s decision. I was looking forward to a variety of options from the other 2 food trucks.  I think overall radio coffee and beer is a good vibe for any occasion  such as social  business  study. The parking is limited so just pray that a spot opens up when you arrive 
Radio Coffee & Beer,44,didnt lov  e the parking  but otherwise this is a cute spot  met a coworker to get some work done here. great weather. seemed like they had a lot of good food truck options. would love to come when they have live music. I got the chai and it was amazing. my coworker got a kombucha and she loved it  I ve been wanting to take my husband to review the night vibe. will report back   
Radio Coffee & Beer,45,It s a nice ambiance  with live music and really enjoyed the coffee drinks especially the carajillo. The staff was great as well.
Radio Coffee & Beer,46,Love radio  lots of good options and great drinks  Patio area is nice and spacious  food trucks are delicious  and their staff are always very kind and helpful  Lots of shaded seating and good for larger groups. I love visiting this spot on the weekends and spending time here with friends. Parking can be tight so be prepared to circle around and hunt for a spot. The zucchini bread from Misty Morning Bakery is my favorite pastry  Good music  fun atmosphere  and a great place to read a book  grab drinks  or get an afternoon pick me up. Veracruz Taco is one of my favorite taco places and always hits the spot 
Radio Coffee & Beer,47,I like the vibe  it s quintessential  Austin  vibes. Quirky  good coffee  dogs everywhere  sunshine as you work from your computer  staff is friendly.   What I love about Austin coffee shops like this is that you go both for the goal of getting work done  or hanging out  or whatever it is   but the ambience adds a layer of  THIS IS SOOOO AUSTIN     which is always fun.   Check it out  if you re like me and work from your computer  you probably have made the rounds to many coffee shops in Austin. Make sure you don t miss this one  too.   CONS  Very difficult to find parking during some phases of the day.
Radio Coffee & Beer,48,Sometimes these coffee-shop-by-day  bar-by-night spots can feel off-kilter or forced. The dim-lit bar vibes throwing off a morning coffee buzz or the smell of espresso disorienting for night-time drinkers. Radio sway between both outfits seamlessly. What works for daytime  works for drinking time.  The espresso coffees are great and I love that they do soy milk - a rarity these days.   There s also a few different areas you can get work done or get some downtime. An outside beer garden for sunny days or a cozy indoors spot that s perfect for coffee dates or remote work.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the very good taco truck  Veracruz parked outside. Another operation that can satisfy morning  noon and night.
Radio Coffee & Beer,49,As someone who has spent her fair share of time at day to evening coffee beer bars  I don t know how I was sleeping on Radio  Currently open for curbside and they have a takeout window so you can enjoy a coffee beverage or pastry  or food from Veracruz or Dee Dee Thai  as both both trucks are on-site  on their gorgeous  lush garden-like outdoor seating areas.  All safety precautions seem to be implemented and followed.
Radio Coffee & Beer,50,Visited Radio Coffee  amp  Beer for the first time while on a short break  awaiting a family member pick-up from nearby St. David s. I only grabbed an Iced  Americano    3   but I was very impressed with the extensive menu of beverage options  Their cocktails looked especially tempting in the middle of a run-of-the-mill workday     The staff was friendly  efficient with a short line of folks waiting 6-ft. apart  and they had plenty of outdoor seating that accommodated all the recent COVID-19 CDC guidelines. Appreciate them all taking the extra precautions with signs and suggestions for their patrons.  Would definitely come back to visit and enjoy some sun while either working remotely or meeting up with a group of friends  There seemed to be plenty of parking available in the front  but on an more crowded day  I d recommend a carpool 
Radio Coffee & Beer,51,I went there at 7 10 am today  google says they open at 7 am  door is closed and there s this gurl behind the bar running around. Another lady come and stands right next to me and we are like door is closed and she waits next to us  another guy goes there and he is like don t they open at 7 am  And we are like yeah  and then two dudes also come and just stand and wait. 10 min later home girl comes with a super rude attitude opens the door and just yells I just want you to know that today we probably will be opening 10 30 ish.....We ve been there 10 min  like why   she just close the door and don t even look at us.   I m not a Karen  I actually tip 25  and I m never rude. Is just that that s not the way to treat someone at 7 am in the cold without the first cup of coffee.   I probably will be back  not in the morning tho.
Radio Coffee & Beer,52,The Corona virus has made ordering at restaurants difficult  but Radio has this thing down to a T  Ordering was super easy and came out in just a matter of minutes   What I ordered  I got a small iced coffee with sugar free vanilla and soy milk. It was good  but a little pricier than I would spend at other places  which is why it s 4 stars instead of 5 .   I m not sure if there is an inside area  but the outside has plenty of seating    Right now they require face masks while ordering  but not when sitting at the tables outside. 
Radio Coffee & Beer,53,I love this spot not only because they have fantastic draft beers but because I met my current boyfriend of a year there on our first date  This is a great date spot and a wonderful spot to meet up with friends. This is like the miniature version of Cosmic but with more draft beers and whole lot of ambiance. They have indoor seating and plenty of outdoor seating as well. Additionally they have some good food trucks on hand for when you get the munchies.   While I ve only been here once  I ve been dying to make it out here again  so maybe I ll see ya there  10 10 would recommend you check out Radio Coffee  amp  Beer 
Radio Coffee & Beer,54,By far and wide the WORST Old Fashioned I ve ever had. It was the worst diluted wells Whiskey combined with the most basic B     stirring ever. Save your money. And the food trailers are mediocre.  They are ok. They are centric  but their drinks are made by people who ve never served people who aren t trying to impress their dates.   You can do much better.
Radio Coffee & Beer,55,Just noticed that Dee Dee food truck is right next to this coffee shop. The staffs were so friendly and interesting  they have plenty of seats on the patio and some food trucks. Ordered espresso and matcha latte  they were both pretty nice. The vibe is definitely impressive 
Radio Coffee & Beer,56,This is one of those spots in Austin that you look up on yelp  hope for the best and are pleasantly surprised when you get there. Thought the outside area was full when we got there it wasn t terrible and everyone was still able to social distance. The coffee was smooth and the taco selection was something else all together. Only downside was we ended up waiting about 40 minuets for the food so when we finally got it  I ate it too fast to get a photo
Radio Coffee & Beer,57,Like this place  it s kinda retro style  nice outdoor seating  they haVe limited seating inside  and a small covered place at the front porch. Bathroom was ok clean for so much crowd. Cappuccino  coffee and hot cocoa was good  good for groups  families with kids and they have Veracruz and Dee Dee food trucks  it s just perFect  nice food with cappuccino  can t ask for more  Definitely worth a visit  if you haven t.
Radio Coffee & Beer,58,One of my favorite Austin activities is going to Radio on a Saturday Sunday morning  getting a breakfast taco from Veracruz and a coffee  or mimosa  from Radio. The outdoor seating is plentiful  cute dogs everywhere  friendly people and great food beverages. Radio is one of my Austin staples that I always take visitors to. Recommend getting there early-ish on the weekends as parking can be a challenge and wait times at Veracruz can get long.
Radio Coffee & Beer,59,Love the drinks  coffee and music. I also had fun at the trivia event and there was a food truck with good food nearby
Radio Coffee & Beer,60,Five stars for the courtyard seating with beautiful string lights and two food trucks onsite to choose from  Veracruz Mexican and a Thai food truck whose name I don t recall. Mix of people hanging out and working  lots of tables to choose from   The coffee shop itself has a coffee  amp  beer menu  and a few pastries from Easy Tiger  a local restaurant. The beer selection looked awesome   I m only giving it 3 stars because I got a decaf americano and it was pretty boring.   I learned after my friend gave up her parking spot in the main lot to me  I had my baby with me  that there s also a secondary lot. So if you don t have luck finding parking in front of the coffee shop  check out the back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,61,I tried Radio when I first moved to Austin. They served me a decent latte but it was nowhere near one of my favorites as I searched for the best coffee in Austin. But 5 years down the line and Radio is one of my favorite places. Why   Well a lot of things changed. First was the addition of Veracruz and Dee Dee. These two food trucks in one location is why I love Radio so much. My wife craves Veracruz and I crave Dee Dee  we would check the hours of both and if they were open  problem solved. This is by far the biggest reason why I love Radio.  Secondly  our lifestyle changed and we are now dog parents. Radio gives such an awesome outdoor space for the dog to roam around in.   Thirdly  their beer selection is pretty decent. There are other places I would rather get a beer  but read my first reason above. Veracruz   Dee Dee   Beer   Total Win.  Radio does get crowded  it is hard to find parking though they have made significant improvements in my opinion  and their coffee is not really the greatest. All of this really cuts down Radio from 5 stars to 4. Still I love this place so much.
Radio Coffee & Beer,62,Greg W.  I didn t get a receipt but paid with my card. Here s the charge and it was a lavender latte -the guy making it said it s what he makes his mom.   Love this place  amp  haven t been during COVID-19  GOOD- They have always had such a cute spot  amp  great services. They are definitely doing their part for pandemic.  BAD- I was shocked to pay  8.26    10 with tip  for a small coffee  even overpriced Starbucks would hand me a grande for that price.   I can t help wonder if they are over pricing to keep the house less OUT.  Unfortunately  they are 1 2 block from the new skid row in Austin.  It s unfortunate  because I live in area  amp  would happily sit on their huge patio more but can t afford those prices for a cup of Jo
Radio Coffee & Beer,63,It s a vibe here. It s mostly outdoor seating with indoor as well. The service was quick and had a clean area. I got a matcha which I wouldn t get again
Radio Coffee & Beer,64,This is a go-to spot in Austin for locals and visitors  I ve taken every visitor that s come to town and it never disappoints  It is such a wonderful location to sit on the patio with an ice cold beer and eat tacos from a famous ATX food truck.   COVID-19 update  They are still selling their coffee and beer  canned  as well as to-go cocktails w  a good purchase  Currently it s a drive up tent to take your order and they re following social distancing quite well while still providing great service.   I stopped by just the other day for a cold brew and daydreamed of a time when I drank that coffee on their patio... Once this is all over I HIGHLY recommend coming to Radio for any time of day beverages but also  support your local ATX restaurants during this rough time if you can    Side note- Order Veracruz Taco  Their migas are TO DIE FOR 
Radio Coffee & Beer,65,The Radio Coffee  amp  Beer yard houses some of the better food trucks in Austin -- Veracruz Tacos and DEE DEE. It s like the perfect little food playground and you can mix and match your dining options then eat it all out on the benches situated under twinkling patio lights strewn across the coverings. Radio offers you a rotating tap list of beers and or a hot concoction of coffee or tea. Their coffee roasters seem to rotate too. They even serve some traditional cocktails.  I just wanted something warm sans caffeine on a chilly night so their  House Chai  for  4 sounded stellar. This was definitely on the spicier side probably made with a heavy helping of ginger. Loved the extra touch of cinnamon drizzled a top the foam. It certainly was packed inside on a Friday night  but still against a charming back drop as it was an eclectic mish-mash of chairs and tables amongst the chatter. This certainly isn t the best study spot  but great for conversation really especially over a choice beverage.
Radio Coffee & Beer,66,Radio is a solid coffee shop choice. The property has lots of outdoor space for you to set up at and enjoy your drink. They have several food trucks as well  namely Veracruz  so you ll be well fed too.   The baristas can be a bit snooty but in general they mean well and are respectful. But they re almost always busy so they are operating at a faster speed mindset and sort of expect you to know what you want and to move along. So if you re less experienced in the coffee realm and need a little help I suggest reading up ahead of bringing a friend who can help you with your order.   Otherwise they make a great cup. Their chai is also killer if you re not a coffee lover. Super spicy and warm it s amazing.
Radio Coffee & Beer,67,A fabulous neighborhood hang. Family and dog friendly. Great coffee and beer. They have wine and mixed drinks too. Lots of live music and excellent food truck options. Mostly outdoor seating and the parking lot is small but you can park on the surrounding streets and it s a short walk.
Radio Coffee & Beer,68,Welcome to the most Pretentious headquarters of Austin.If you don t have a tattoo or piercings all over you than your not welcome at this place. Total millennial  hipsters heaven. NOT old Austin at all   Really a buzzkill of a place. Thanks for ruining my South Austin neighborhood. Also  pleas lose the attitude  shut up and do your job  Thanks Nerds
Radio Coffee & Beer,69,First one of these coffee slash beer and cocktail places I ve been too. Super busy so it must be trendy. Had to wait for a seat inside  outside seating was nearly as full.   Parking is decent for the size of the place  I was able to get a spot up front upon arrival. I settled in with a car club buddy to discuss social media management over two Irish Coffees.   Here s where Radio lost me... 9.50 a pop. Folks  I ve had them made table side with a french press  same premium liquors  and real whipped cream for less. Y all a little too high on the hipster tree for me.
Radio Coffee & Beer,70,Cute coffee and beer spot. Lots of outdoor covered seating. Definitely recommend ordering ahead when it s crowded. I like their matcha lattes and Thai iced tea. Wednesday nights are crowded because they host a fun trivia night.
Radio Coffee & Beer,71,Love love love this place. Great vibes  always friendly service and awesome atmosphere both inside and outside. Coffee is the bomb diggity  My go to lately has been iced vanilla latte. Yum  Live music is back  yay   Plenty of outdoor seating with yummy food truck options. A stop at Radio Coffee always makes for a great day.
Radio Coffee & Beer,72,Really cool place  So much outdoor space. And the cold brew and chocolate croissant was delicious 
Radio Coffee & Beer,73,So I love this spot  as does the rest of Austin. My only gripe is the confusing happy hour policies that are now in place. I  think  it is from 3-6  the rest is unclear. Apparently what beer is on happy hour changes based on what is available    . And you have to ask  which makes you  that  person. Considering beers are  7- 9  I feel it would be a better policy to have a consistent happy hour that does not waste the bartender s  and my  time.
Radio Coffee & Beer,74,This location perfectly exemplifies the spirit of Austin.  It s such an inviting space  with plenty of seating and a few food trucks with which to enjoy your drinks.  Where else can I get some nice coffee with tacos and some Thai food and have all three be really good   This review is for Radio Coffee and Beer.  I had some tacos too  but that s a separate review.  Radio Coffee  amp  Beer has that  hipster  vibe to it  but still remains really inviting.  There were some people on laptops  but there were also families with kids there.  Although I don t drink alcohol  it was cool to see coffee and beer in one place.  Their taps have local beers as well as a nitro cold brew.  I went with the nitro cold brew so that I could have some sort of  brew  that came from the tap.  I really enjoyed the nitro cold brew.  It came to a nice head.  The flavor of the coffee was excellent  crisp  and refreshing.  They managed to bring out all the good qualities of the coffee.  It didn t need anything added to it.  I also had them make me an Arnold Palmer since they served both iced team and lemonade.  Here s where I was a bit disappointed.  The lemonade isn t made in-house.  The iced tea is made fresh in-house  but the lemonade is just from a plastic bottle.  They have lemonade on their menu at a somewhat steep price and I d expect them to make the lemonade.  The drink was okay.  The iced tea that they made fresh was overpowered by the lemonade.  I would definitely return for the nitro cold brew and for the atmosphere.  Although if the other food trucks did not share a space  I m not sure I d go out of my way to just go to Radio Coffee.
Radio Coffee & Beer,75,My favorite coffee shop in Austin  Super spacious with great atmosphere  Delicious coffee plus several food truck right on their premises. It s hard not to love this place.  They conveniently located right off of I35. The location and design remind me a lot of Truck Yard in Dallas. They do have plenty of seatings. Not too many seats for indoor  but perfect for when the weather is nice outside or when your laptop is already fully charged  we didn t really see any outlets outside . 1 star  Radio Coffee  amp  Beer is a 1 stop shop for everything you need. They have delicious and beautiful coffee latte. Plenty of beer wine cocktails to choose from. 2-3 food trucks right outside for you to get a snack or a full on meal. We didn t try any alcohol or food  but saw many people did. The fact that they encourage people to come  get food from the food truck  then chow it down a drink or 2 from Radio is enough to keep people coming back.  they even have happy hour  3 stars  The vibe is more of a bar type at first  but you ll soon see most people getting busy working surfing away on their laptops once you step inside. With the place being so busy  they always have several baristas bartenders working at any moment. Everyone seems pretty hippie-ty and nice. Plus it doesn t hurt that some are kinda eye candy 1 star.  They do stay open late until midnight and often have different events. We ll for sure be back next time we re in Austin   This is the break down of my rating for coffee shops    Offering latte art consistently  1 star   Quality of coffee drinks food  up to 2 stars   Atmosphere  1 star   Customer service  1 star
Radio Coffee & Beer,76,Always love this space  and cool to see they now have cocktails. I hadn t been since they got a liquor license. We enjoyed some live music the other night  the set up was nice. They were sold out of almost all pastries  though  and when they say they close at midnight  they mean it  We pretty much got thrown out. I guess I don t blame them for wanting to get home.
Radio Coffee & Beer,77,A great outdoor bar  especially if you want personal space. Let s are welcome  drinks can be pricey  but the scenery is worth it 
Radio Coffee & Beer,78,Radio coffee is a great hangout spot for foodies and coffee-lovers alike. It has a nice  covered outdoor patio and accompanying food trucks. I typically get a mocha or a matcha latte  and the quality is always consistent and delicious. This is a great place to meet up with friends or study. They also allow dogs on the patio which is nice if you are an animal lover like myself.
Radio Coffee & Beer,79,Always love coming to work at this spot  it s got a ton of small tables and single spots at the bar. There are a few group tables inside  and outside is large picnic tables - great for groups.  Drip coffee changes  but has been mild and good - nothing too crazy  that I ve found .  Kambucha on tap is nice  as well as quite a few beers. They also sell wine.     Happy hour offered on drinks.  Taco truck outside  huge bonus because who doesn t love taco trucks   Free WiFi  Friendly staff.  Great  South Central location  small parking lot in front and big one in back.   See ya next time 
Radio Coffee & Beer,80,I think this place is vastly overrated. Every time I ve ever been here parking has been a nightmare. Whether that s out front or in the back. It s all just awkward and almost always full.   The drip coffees I ve had here are just mediocre. I hear their lattes are good but I ve never tried them. But  to me  a real coffee shop first needs to have a great drip coffee on point just as a standard foundation. Then lattes and all the rest.   The place is always loud every time I ve been. I ve had trouble conversating without straining to hear or feeling like you need to yell. Bring noise-canceling headphones if you want to study.  Because it s one of a tiny number of coffeeshops serving south Austin  it s a nightmare for introverts. I ve never had that  cozy  comfortable  quiet enough  relaxing  ambiance you long for in a great coffee shop. As this place seems to bring in all of south Austin south of Ben White and just north of it.  I see it as more of a hangout spot where south Austin converges to commiserate but not a great coffee shop in its purest sense.   I do like the rustic decor inside and out though. They got that going for them.
Radio Coffee & Beer,81,Plenty of outdoor seating  Radio has some great selection of beers  teas and coffees. They also have some pastries from easy tiger. Veracruz and dee dee food trucks are within the same property which makes getting a bite very easy. Covid protocols are strictly followed.  The crowd on the day I visited was very respectful of Covid protocols which is a huge plus.  the outdoor seating has table configurations for groups from 2-8 people which makes it great if you are planning to come with a bigger group. Plenty of pups on-site to make you feel good 
Radio Coffee & Beer,82,Delicious cappuccino and cold brew here with lots of outdoor seating. If you need a more substantial meal  there are multiple food trucks to choose from  one of which is Veracruz tacos. We also asked about dairy-free nut-free bakery options and to our surprise  they had a zucchini bread that hit the spot. Lots of doggos here 
Radio Coffee & Beer,83,We ve been here multiple times to enjoy both coffee and cocktails. Everyone is always friendly and the drinks are always good  Their outdoor area is set up nicely and there are fans that make it enjoyable even on hot summer days. Highly recommend 
Radio Coffee & Beer,84,We ordered the oat milk latte and a dirty chai. The  oat milk latte  picture left  had no coffee in it  it was just a cup of oat milk with ice. The chai latte tasted a bit better but tasted like a watered down chai mix with coffee. Total waste of  12. I think they were understaffed because the line took like 20 minutes and there was one cashier and one barista. We were going to go in and return them but the line was too long and we had to get to work. Super disappointing.   I will say  Radio has a cool spot and great hangout vibes.
Radio Coffee & Beer,85,I ll admit it  I am a coffee snob. Too sweet  too bitter  too weak  and I m immediately not into it. The espresso at Radio is pretty dang good- nutty  roasty and toasty tasting  There is no bitter   I m talking to you  Starbucks  espresso in this place    The flavor syrups are not too sweet and don t taste artificial  you can t go wrong whether you choose hazelnut  vanilla or caramel.  My go-to order is the iced hazelnut latte with oat milk or the nitro cold brew with a splash of oat milk  big oat milk fan here  in the summer. In the winter I m a classic latte fan. Also love the Thai tea with black tea and the cocktails are all pretty great too  especially the Bloody Mary for a Sunday brunch   or Monday- who s judging    The only reason I can t give 5 stars has absolutely nothing to do with the coffee  it s the fact that half the time I come here to work  the WiFi either doesn t work or is spotty. This is annoying but it s also something I m sure they could easily fix. The outdoor patio is glorious  with plenty of shaded or covered seating  hell yes for misters in the summer   and trees and plants galore. There s also picnic tables and sometimes on weekends they have local vendors selling art  soap  jewelry  all sorts of cool stuff. Oh- and if you re not sold on the sweet patio alone  they have two of the best food trailers in town  Veracruz All Natural for the tacos of your dreams or Dee Dee for the most authentic and crazy delicious Thai outside of Thailand itself.   So yeah- Radio  I like you a lot. Please keep doing what you re doing and thanks for keeping Austin caffeinated and patio d 
Radio Coffee & Beer,86,Fine coffee  but way  wayyy crowded on Saturday morning. Parking was limited  even in the back lots.   Parking is free if you can find a space  though there wasn t much room by 10AM.   Cashier refused to heat up the almond-buckwheat cake and mushroom-chevre tart I ordered. Understandable since there was a big line  but she didn t even give me a plate. The tart and the cake both turned out to be really tasty even unheated.  Probably a better bar than a coffee shop
Radio Coffee & Beer,87,Some of the best coffee I ve ever had is in Austin  Texas. Radio Coffee  amp  Beer is the best of the best. When I visit my son in Austin  he generally brings me to this place. Radio Coffee serves the best cappuccino I ve ever had outside of Italy  I kid you not. The park-like setting is open-air and conducive to intimate conversations with friends and family as Texans like and enjoy. People bring their dogs and small children who play in the kid s area but are always visible to mom and dad. A few food trucks around the perimeter of the outside area offer all sorts of food ranging from carnitas to tacos and sandwiches to desserts.  Nighttime is especially lovely in the warm Texas summer evening so long as you can stand the mosquitos that will bite every inch of your exposed body. I highly recommend using a repellent  or you will be bitten to within an inch of your life. Come and enjoy the coffee here and the friendly and cordial Texas atmosphere.
Radio Coffee & Beer,88,This is my new go-to coffee spot     great atmosphere with plenty of seating and food trucks. I highly recommend
Radio Coffee & Beer,89,Radio city makes its really easy to order during covid they have a system that s pristine with masks upon entry if you forgot or don t have one. There s a door you use for entry and a door you use for exiting. They have an incredible patio space with Veracruz tacos that you can order from. They have really great lattes and Americanos. I was pretty pleased with my experience and cannot wait to come back and have their beers  amp  cocktails and listen to live music. Dope place 
Radio Coffee & Beer,90,I needed a place with WiFi so I could take a zoom call for work  amp  I had heard from my boyfriend that this place was pretty cool. It wasn t too far from my new home in Austin so I decided to go today. At first site it was spacious with a lot of outdoor seating. They are enforcing masks when you re inside to order which I appreciate. I had never been so I asked for a suggestion while ordering  amp  the barista there asked all the right questions to get me something I was sure to like. Like I said it s spacious so there was plenty of spots to take my call. The coffee was great  amp  I can t wait to go back for more. Going to have to check out the beer selection in the evening  Great vibes and friendly staff.
Radio Coffee & Beer,91,Nice place to hangout over coffee Chilled out place Nice outdoor seatings  Best Thai iced tea
Radio Coffee & Beer,92,I ve lived in Austin for close to two years now. And this place is like my second home. The staff is incredible. The coffee drinks are excellent. My partner works from here 2-3 times a week. Great ambience for really any occasion. When friends family come to visit  this is the place I bring them first. Cannot say enough good things about Radio.
Radio Coffee & Beer,93,There is just something so magical about Radio.  Maybe it s because it was one of the first spots my family and I visited when we first moved to Austin  so it has major nostalgia value for us.  Whatever the reason  it is a family favorite.  My husband and I love Radio because we can sit and relax with a beer.  My son loves it because there is always another kid to play with and a tree to climb.  The ambiance it great - very chill.  We come to relax and just take our time.  Also  between Veracruz and Dee Dee s food trucks on site  there is no shortage of delicious food.  When we have guests visiting from out of town  I usually take them to Radio for breakfast so we can get Veracruz migas tacos  best in town   and coffee and watch the grackles.  Though I had frequented Radio pre-pandemic  last week was the first time I d been back since 2019.  The charm of Radio is definitely still there.  The only real noticeable difference is you need to order online from the food trucks now  which I actually think is a bonus.  No more waiting in line to place your order     We ll be back again soon I m sure.  We just love Radio so much 
Radio Coffee & Beer,94,I love the atmosphere at Radio. We got coffee and breakfast tacos today. I didn t like the iced mocha that I ordered but they cheerfully offered to make it again or help me find something I liked better. I suggest getting your food before drinks because the drinks come out very fast.
Radio Coffee & Beer,95,Great greenery. I am surrounded by plants. I am also groovin to the music. What more do you need  Oh  right. A nice cup of coffee. Mmmmmmmmm
Radio Coffee & Beer,96,love you so friggin much radio  they gave me free cold brew...im gonna cryyy tysm    
Radio Coffee & Beer,97,Just coffee today  no beer. With breakfast that I got from the food truck.  This is a super location with a busy interior of tables and counter. There are also outside tables  some of which are inside a canvas enclosure which sure helped on a rainy morning that was pushing 45 degrees.  A simple drip coffee with a refill that was excellent.   Review 10150 overall  1736 of 2018. 
Radio Coffee & Beer,98,Well  it pains me to write this  but this place just can t get 5 stars cause of the  vibe  -- I have been coming here on and off for years  but when it comes to actually being able to sit and work...it s impossible  b c 4 out of 5 times the Wi-Fi doesn t work. I had to connect to my hotspot just to write this review. The pastries are terrible  the coffee is great  the food trucks are BOMB  the live music is bomb  but if you can t use the Wi-Fi - what s the point 
Radio Coffee & Beer,99,Brought our computers and did some co-working outside here  The heat beat us out eventually but was fun to have some coffee and enjoy some queso from truck vendor in the back. Recommend    Feel like the night scene would be fun too with drinks instead of coffee -- excited to check that out
Radio Coffee & Beer,100,I found out through social media that the new MLS Austin FC was handing out swag and tried to rush here to get some.  Never heard of this place and using maps to navigate my way.  I was already planning on doing a coffeehouse tour in Austin so excited to check this place out.    I see the cool looking sign and pulled into the parking lot quickly finding an open space.  At first the place looked like an old ranch house.  I saw a lot of outdoor seating and a food truck  but sadly too late to get the swag.  I was surprised how many people were outside working on their laptops in the shaded 100 degree heat.   I walked inside and see a very nice setup with even more seating full of remote workers. I ordered an iced tea and a bag of whole beans.  It was too hot for coffee but planning to return and try it. On the menu showed a full selection of beers.  I noticed a bunch of people having beers.  It was a very cool relaxing atmosphere.  Turned out since I bought the coffee beans my tea was free.    With no seating availability inside I went outside to find a seating spot under an overhang.  I stayed a bit until the heat got to me and my iced tea went dry.  Overall it s a very cool hangout and even better when the weather cools down.
Radio Coffee & Beer,101,The chai tea here was so good  it s normally hard to find spicy chai tea in planned but Austin seems to be the city for it. All my friends really enjoyed their coffee and having the Veracruz taco truck came in clutch  wait for the tacos is normally very long but the wait for coffee was not. Nice baristas and really big outdoor space. Fun place to visit and take friends.
Radio Coffee & Beer,102,Love radio. The people are great and it s a perfect work away from home spot as long as my laptop is fully charged. I usually sit with a coffee  micheleda and taco or come in the evening for some chill outdoor vibes.
Radio Coffee & Beer,103,Not sure why they don t take cash orders while Radio House Coffee does. Confusing and frustrating.
Radio Coffee & Beer,104,As a native Austinite  I ve always had high hopes for Radio...yet it seems that time and time again I leave there feeling like I m just not  cool enough  or deserving of my iced latte with almond milk. These are the kind of establishments that make native Austinites angry. Excuse me...but you re in MY hometown...can you be a little nicer  That was the general vibe of Austin before all the transplants came here. I ve had to change to Radio for my morning coffee for the past few months due to a job change  and every morning  without fail  the baristas behind the bar are casually chatting while those of us trying to get coffee in before the workday our biting our nails waiting for them to stop flirting so we can get on with our day. Initially  it was their  large  to go cups which are so very small that turned me off to Radio  but having to use Radio as my morning AM coffee spot has forced me to accept the tiny larges.  I know and understand that Radio is technically a  cool Austin spot  but  it has always been their attitude for me.  Do they only hire people who seem to be annoyed with the fact that you re even there  Do they hate my money  Is it simply that they re only nice to technically cool looking people   Whatever it is  it is EXHAUSTING and frustrating.  I hope Radio gets better in the future  but if you re a regular looking person who doesn t want to feel like someone is annoyed with your very presence as you click the  add tip  function on the pay pad  then I m not sure Radio is your jam.  My regular shop is Irie Bean if you re looking for suggestions for a non-pretentious vibe with good coffee.
Radio Coffee & Beer,105,Me like.   Coffee  beer  wine  baked goods  non alcoholic dranks  live music some nights  taco truck  deedees Thai food  indoor outdoor seating  dog friendly  south austin. Am I missing anything  They covered their bases pretty damn well and meets most austinites needs.
Radio Coffee & Beer,106,Very fun location for a boozy coffee and some awesome food trucks.  Helps that the place is overflowing with locals that have dogs and families on the weekend.   Worth a trip to try some Thai food at Dee dees truck  the drinks and atmosphere were great 
Radio Coffee & Beer,107,I ve been coming here for years... love this place. I know covid has definitely changed us all... but the last few times I have come here  even before the 2020 lockdown  staff here smile less and act like the don t care to be there... or maybe they all are now emo hipsters that don t make eye contact. Either way - delicious coffee.
Radio Coffee & Beer,108,I ve come here a few times on 2 separate trips to Austin  and it delivered each time  Great vibe  very cozy on a dreary rainy day with a warm latte. Also great on a beautiful spring day with plenty of outdoor space for your dog to come along   I had an oat milk latte today and it was the best I ve had. The cute latte art just takes it to the next level too. Very friendly baristas.  The Vera Cruz Tacos food truck on property is also phenomenal 
Radio Coffee & Beer,109,I got a large lavender honey latte with oat milk and it was excellent. The coffee was smooth and strong  I could really taste the espresso   and the lavender was refreshing. The amount of honey was perfect too - not too sweet  but the flavor was noticeable. I love how the online ordering menu allowed me to customize my drinks at a granular level. The outdoor seating was distanced  all ordering was online  and I felt covid-safe during my entire experience. I will definitely be back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,110,This review may be biased bc I haven t had a solid cup of cappuccino in a while.. but theirs with oat milk was solid   Indoor and outdoor seatings were mostly occupied when I went early Sunday afternoon. It got progressively busier as the afternoon went on. Also veracruz taco truck is right outside  perfect taco coffee combo for your weekend morning treats   BE WARNED  they turn off their wifi on weekends  and according to another review after 5pm on week days also    so it s a good hang out spot if you wanted to quietly read or chat or people watch.
Radio Coffee & Beer,111,You can t go wrong with Radio a Coffee  amp  Beer. The staff is always friendly  the service is always prompt and the coffee is always great  What more can you ask for   They even have blue grass night every week which is always a good time. They have plenty of outdoor seating and indoor too.   Food trucks in the back to feed your cravings - all in all it s a good stop for all 
Radio Coffee & Beer,112,I believe this has quickly become our  1. The beans are really flavorful and the latte is a large cup. Their gf zucchini bread was a really nice snack too.
Radio Coffee & Beer,113,Cute spot with a lot of shade but the parking is horrendous. There is a small parking lot and the side streets have no parking signs all over. There are a lot of people there with laptops which means they are there for a loooong time hence the parking does not turn over.  On a positive note they not only serve coffee but beer  They have a pretty good selection and 3 sizes to choose from. The Veracruz taco truck on site serves quality tacos.
Radio Coffee & Beer,114,Radio Coffee is currently my favorite place for my beloved Nitro Cold brew. Its not made in house and just Stumptown but it comes off their tap light and with a hard caffeine hit that makes me ready to tear into my day with the zest of a tiger.   I ve never had bad service here and I always get what I need quickly efficiently and everyone is great.   They also have a rather serious local beer selection and some of the best movie nights in town    I m here at least every other weekend so stop and try the Nitro Cold brew and see me sometime 
Radio Coffee & Beer,115,Loved the oat latte  and nitro brew at Radio. Plenty of outdoor seating with a super laid back vibe. A couple of hours later we ordered some house margaritas and beers yeah we were still here enjoying Veracruz tacos  loved them too  Especially the spicy rimmed ones. Saturday well spent catching up with old friends here.
Radio Coffee & Beer,116,Simply my favorite patio to sip delicious assortments of espresso  amp  coffee beverages. Bring a book  enjoy a taco from the truck  amp  take in all the great vibes. Thank you RCB for doing exactly what you do. Always excellent encounters with the laid back  informative staff 
Radio Coffee & Beer,117,Wonderful and spacious coffee shop in Austin  Great vibes  drinks  and location. I had a lavender latte and it was fantastic. Would highly recommend for work  casual conversation  and wonderful drinks.
Radio Coffee & Beer,118,The music. It used to be a reason I came here. It would be semi-random but interesting  even if I didn t necessarily like it. High points for playing Wire for an hour. Now  Radio pummels its customers with corporate programmed dreck for the California crowd. It s like being in a Starbucks and sucks the life out of everyone. Save Radio against corporate programming 
Radio Coffee & Beer,119,I tried this place based on a recommendation.    First off  I don t know if we went at peak time or not  but parking was a pain. We circled their lot a few times before finding a place. There are food trucks in the same area.  When you walk in you get the impression of a beer garden  not so much a coffee place.  I personally feel like their emphasis is on the beer and not the coffee.  They have tables inside and out which gives you plenty of options for meeting friends. I also so a couple of people with their dogs.  I ordered a mocha which was just ok  kind of had a burnt taste to it. The place was ok  but not really my type of place so probably won t be returning.
Radio Coffee & Beer,120,I like this place. I didn t want to do a review until I went a couple times.   I ve had coffee variations each time. It s good. Definitely not Starbux  a great thing  by the way.  I like the atmosphere. Great place to meet people.  Oh  parking sucks. I always end up parking on the street or a block away.  However  while I quite like the place  there s nothing that makes me want to go here versus other places. It s simply a good meeting place in my opinion that has decent drinks and an ok decor.
Radio Coffee & Beer,121,Bomb.  That s all there is to is. Our lattes and cold brew rocked. Hoping to go back for cocktails 
Radio Coffee & Beer,122,Hey Radio Coffee and Beer. You are a purveyor of my three favorite things and I love your place so I wrote this song to show my gratitude  Cheers Reginald  Doctor  Sandpaper  This is the link to the song  a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.youtube.com 2Fwatch 3Fv 3DLPwBM8-vKeQ amp s 3a0020ea12ebfbdd3cd3bcbd2736bf1ccdbf2b54b12629398d4b8b15411cf96e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  youtube.com watch v LPwB   a 
Radio Coffee & Beer,123,Love this spot. Wood everywhere. Ppl are super nice and chatty. My Cortado was good. Pastries smelled great. A little pricey but what s not in austin. The host helped me pick my drink. Only bad thing is parking. Plenty of seating outside with shade.
Radio Coffee & Beer,124,I really enjoyed my visit to Radio Coffee  amp  Beer Garden. This fun  hipstery place combines the coffee scene with the availability of alcohol  as many places in Austin seem to be doing  resulting in a cool  low-key feel. There is a rustic interior bar area where you can order your coffee or beer  and there is some seating inside as well. But on a nice day  the real action is outside on the covered patio. It is a beautiful spot where you can find a table  enjoy your beverage s   and visit the food trucks that are conveniently parked nearby. I ordered a cappuccino  and my friend got a nitro cold brew. Both drinks were excellent. We also got some chips and salsa from the Veracruz taco truck  and holy homemade awesomeness  those chips were delicious  At the time  we were too full from lunch to actually get tacos  but looking back  I regret not trying at least one of the Veracruz tacos.   All in all  I seriously wish this spot was in my town and not halfway across the country. What a cool place to relax and unwind  have a snack  or to sit and get some homework done. The coffee shop  bar scene that Austin has going on is seriously the coolest. What better way to chill out on a weekday after work than with a beer  a coffee  and a taco  And EVEN BETTER if you can get all of those things  at A  quality  in the same place.
Radio Coffee & Beer,125,Radio is a gem. Bluegrass Mondays  curated tap list  and the best nitro coffee in South Austin.   During COVID-19 they ve adjusted their business and made a safe patio with outdoor walk-up orders. And there are always food trucks like Veracruz nearby when you need a some tasty tacos while you hang-out and or work.  Radio is alive and well and I m glad you guys are here serving the community.
Radio Coffee & Beer,126,What a cool spot   Once I stepped in I got confused is this a bar or coffee shop     It s both so cool place to set and relax  work and listen to good music   Coffee drinker they got you  Alcohol drinker they got you   Order your drink and enjoy setting outside or inside while you re waiting for the delicious food you ordered from the food trucks outside   I was lucky enough to be there by the end of they day to enjoy my drink watching sunset   Just loved it  Awesome vibe 
Radio Coffee & Beer,127,I really like this place- coffee AND beer mimosas plus a taco truck  Heaven.  Don t order a chai latte though- it tasted really  really strange. I ll stick with a Live Oak or regular cup of Joe next time   
Radio Coffee & Beer,128,This place is busy busy which  to me  is always a good sign.  If people are willing to camp out and stand in line  there must be something to a place.  We went with our kids to enjoy a beautiful Austin Saturday afternoon with good food and drinks.  We actually had tacos at the Veracruz food truck but a line was also forming at the Dee Dee Thai Street food truck.  Radio offers a nice air conditioned room and seating with mixed drinks  beer  sodas  tea  and coffees.  I enjoyed a yummy margarita  none of that pre mixed nonsense and our son had an Aperol spritz  nice and refreshing  our other son had a beer. The outside seating includes several covered picnic tables and small tables with seating for up to 4 with tree shade.  It s a nice and easy way to spend an hour or two with good conversation  nice drinks  and good munchies.  It is dog friendly.  Veracruz offers a nice selection of tacos  chips  and guacamole.  We ordered several different tacos from veggie  fajita  and fish.  All are nicely portioned  very tasty  and quite filling. Enjoy
Radio Coffee & Beer,129,Dropped in to get some vera cruz tacos and decided to start off with a latte before I indulge in the tacos. The large latte had a heart nice latte art but a little disappointed when I took my first sip. I saw that they had stumptown roast coffee which I would have hoped they made their own coffee beans. Perhaps I m a bit too picky because I have a love for coffee and everywhere I travel  I try to get the local recommendations. The latte didn t have a strong coffee flavor and the froth milk was not heavy velvety as I expected. I would give it another shot next time and try their draft beers as well. The place is very clean with a nice outdoor area  even an area enclosed with a heater.
Radio Coffee & Beer,130,There are limited menu items in my opinion as well as limited indoor seating. Plenty of room outside with a fire pit and even an area that has three makeshift walls to keep the wind off.  Plenty of room for you to bring your four-legged friends. You can even bring your two-legged friends if you want.
Radio Coffee & Beer,131,Always a great spot to visit. We love sitting outside and ordering taco s from the amazing veraCruz truck. The drinks are always delicious and the vibe is fun. So glad we can still visit here safely 
Radio Coffee & Beer,132,One of our go to place for work lunch time. Another go to place for evening hang out spots. Beer  coffee  desserts and tacos - I believe that s most of the population s staple items. Make sure to stop by earlier than your lunch hour due to the fact that this place gets so crowded. Veracruz All Natural has the Number 1 ranked Migas Tacos and it takes about 20 mins to get your order - worth the wait though. See my review of Veracruz.   Good selection of beers. High quality coffee - Cold Brew. Only issue is the crowdedness but the business as address the once parking issue and has expanded their parking arrangement. Great place to recommend to friends on a nice day  hang out and catch up.
Radio Coffee & Beer,133,Radio has turned into one of my favorite places in South Austin to stop in for a drink or food.  It helps that one of my favorite food trailers is on their property - Cazamance     They serve coffee and beer and other random drinks.  They have nice local beer which make my husband and I happy.  They also have a variety of different teas  which makes me even happier   I love their iced hibiscus tea   It s about  2 and change and you get a free refill.  Not bad at all.    Radio has plenty of seating inside and lots of covered seating outside.  Some evenings they have live local musicians playing which is a blast too.  I have been here for lunch  dinner and after hours and been pleased every time   Radio will continue to be one of my favorite South Austin stops.
Radio Coffee & Beer,134,The atmosphere and setup inside is very nice and the bathrooms are well maintained. The coffee for a standard cup of black was priced a bit higher than expected  even for a smaller local shop.  Having live music really fits the austin vibe scene.  My reason for the negative strike is the staff. A staff member had bumped into me spilling coffee on my pants and shoes. Not only did he not get towels to clean up the mess on the floor and myself  but he would not reimburse with a new cup of coffee  and continued to set up chairs instead at a table.  Supposedly a long staple with the company I am disappointed to see this is how he reacted while I spent money on a product he got all over me.
Radio Coffee & Beer,135,Wouldn t regularly visit but was worth stopping in since I was in town. Only had a chai tea so nothing crazy or that specialty. Clean place  quiet so I could see working in the early morning  few food trucks outside that I hear are delicious. Plenty of unique beers on tap. Heard they ll play vinyl and have open mic type events too.   Just walked in with a friend. Coffee. Tea. Left. Pretty normal place.
Radio Coffee & Beer,136,I always prefer mom  amp  pop coffee shops as opposed to chains like Starbucks and Radio was impressive. Their vanilla latte and GF zucchini bread were good enough to ensure a second visit.
Radio Coffee & Beer,137,Awful awful coffee  amp  cocktails. Always too packed. They didn t proactively figure out a way to make that place function properly  amp  it s reflecting in the drinks.   Overall   burnt coffee  amp  overpriced weak drinks   no thanks. There are some amazing coffee spots in Austin that have it figured out. This place is a no go. Wouldn t recommend.
Radio Coffee & Beer,138,Someone recommended that I check this place out so after my hair appt I headed straight over. It looks like a chill vibe there s food trucks and plenty of outdoor seating. I went in to order a mocha with oat milk  the girl taking my order didn t acknowledge me at all as she stood there doing nothing  I had to walk up and say hello. There was only 2 others who were waiting on their drinks. She never asked me what size and charged me. Which was not that big a deal but she was just not nice to me at all and almost kinda seemed annoyed. I thought that maybe it was one of those Gen Z things where they don t know how to be social. But then a couple girls walked in after me who were greeted in a very friendly manner it s like the girl had 2 personalities. The two girls got their iced lattes before me and they even looked at me like ohhh you ve been waiting longer... lol. I made eye contact with the guy who was making the drinks and it seemed he realized he had forgot my drink. For a first time customer this was not a good experience for me. I won t count them out completely I want to try the bar drinks at some point but they def need to work on their customer service skills.
Radio Coffee & Beer,139,Great customer service. From ordering drinks and the barista making the ordered coffee drinks. Great place to work or get school work done. The outdoor space is great to seat with friends or your dog. Very dog friendly. The out door space does have nice areas that are covered so there is shade for those hot days here is Texas. If you are in the area  I would recommend this place for a good cold beer or coffee.
Radio Coffee & Beer,140,Love this little coffee shop. The service is amazing. They have great coffee  chai tea and tea  beer  and baked goods. Parking is a bit small. There are plenty of seatings and food trucks on site  It was a nice  relaxing atmosphere and I ll definitely be back
Radio Coffee & Beer,141,Prototypical 2010s South Austin eclectic coffee beer food truck music venue with sprawling and varied outdoor seating and charming old house interior. Approve.
Radio Coffee & Beer,142,Wow  I m still having dreams about this place. Truly my favorite coffee shop of all time. A must-see in Austin.  Nitro cold brew on tap is just delicious. So smooth  silky  and rich. My friend ordered an iced vanilla latte with coconut milk and that  too  was just heaven. Truly well-done.  Also love the interior. Feels like you re in a warm cabin in the woods even though there s a lively food truck patio just outside.   Maybe I was happy that M xico beat Germany  maybe it s just the best place ever  maybe both. But it s worth your visit.
Radio Coffee & Beer,143,Radio is still open  They have fresh bread  pastries  bags of coffee  coffee  lattes  draft beer in 2 different sized growlers  wine and some cans. They also have to go bloody Mary s and mimosas   Come support local
Radio Coffee & Beer,144,Very cool spot for any occasion- whether you wanna hang out with friends or get a quick bite to eat. Radio Coffee  amp  Beer has a parking lot and if it s full there is plenty of street parking along the venue. You can get food either from two food trucks- Dee Dee  Thai- SPICY  or Vera Cruz  tacos . If you want any drinks from either trucks you have to get them from the bar- such as we wanted to get Thai ice tea from Dee Dee  but you have to order from the bar. There s always something going at Radio  such as live music  comedy night  trivia night  karaoke  e.t.c.   A friendly place for any groups- they got long wooden tables outside if you have a relatively sizable party.   I haven t had their coffee yet  so I can t comment on that  but they have a solid section of beers to choose from.
Radio Coffee & Beer,145,We frequent Radio Coffee  amp  Beer for their Wednesday night Trivia. We have a good time having a drink and hanging out with our Trivia buddies. It s always crowded and hard to find parking and a table. There s long lines for the taco truck and the beer. Yet we keep coming back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,146,Coffee shops in Austin are Weird.  I saw in the news recently a variant of this kind of shop - a place that sells coffee AND booze  wow my favorite things besides hanky panky LOL - Stouthaus  got into hot water when some employee told some nursing mom to put her tits away. The nursing mom network went ham on Stouthaus  and the co-owner wife  who claimed to have breastfed her kids  announced a new policy  breastfeeders welcome. Come one  come all.  A couple days ago  some maniac apparently suffering a terrible episode with reality trespassed into the pastries of Bennu South  snatched a mug  fled  and bashed some geezer s head at a nearby bus stop  got restrained by customers  escaped police  ran into a nearby Freebird s and promptly murdered an employee prepping for that morning s lunch scene. And not long before that  some weird  race  issue popped up involving a miscommunication between employees and some nonpaying customer of color. Love to turn everything into a race war.  And on New Year s Eve  a lawyer went into Radio and served some papers on a musician with the same name as an alleged debtor in a lawsuit. Apparently  a journalist  friend of the musician and the owner of Radio  was present and went on the warpath for his buddies. He published it here  and it has some nice insults.  a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.austinchronicle.com 2Fdaily 2Fmusic 2F2020-01-03 2Flawyer-mistakenly-delivers-summons-to-austin-musician-at-gig 2F amp s 5a13c2acb442af1c80c4a62eb8aa7a9eef41ce88b7cb45daef7f8dbeb5f5165d  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  austinchronicle.com dail   a   I think it s funny the lawyer fucked up like this but I think it s really weird that the journalist asked the owner what he bought...and the owner told him. I ve never heard of that. I think I ll still come to this place  it s got good shit  last paragraph . I ll just be packing cash. I hate this world with all of its fucking apps tracking every single purchase and indecision. Can t wait to get the Bumble for tippers app out there that pairs you up with people who tip like you.  My most recent coffee trip I got a mocha and read some of The Female Man  good book for you feminists wannabes. The mocha is overpriced like everywhere in Austin. I don t understand the obsession with pricing mochas at six bucks a pop. I just want an americano with some choco and froth  man.    The staff are a kind bunch  if looks cannot deceive.   Radio is a good place to eat some grub while sitting on chairs situated on uneven ground. Love to tilt backwards and almost fall smack on my head.   The patio space is family friendly  and people love the shit out of this joint. So I don t like coming here during peak hours.   I ve got some fond memories of this joint in recent history. I remember sitting here one night last year while a couple asked me to  direct  their homemade porno. I remember realizing I missed my first job deadline  while sitting outside on the porch.   Sometimes  they have open mic nights and you can get your chuckles on with the chuckleheads at the shop      Ho ho ho everyone happy new year.
Radio Coffee & Beer,147,Visited three times. Not inclined to return. Here s why   1. Bought food at 11 30p. The fast food truck didn t have it ready till 11 55p. Worker closes bar  amp  kicks everyone out at 12 05  Literally sat down and 1 minute later they yelled over the patio that everyone had to leave - regardless if you have food or not. There s no reason the 30  patrons eating drinking couldn t have been allowed 15-30 minutes to stay sitting outside on the patio to finish consuming what we bought.   2. Sunday lunch. Family of 4. Ordered tacos. Took 75 minutes to get food  And that s not including the time waiting in line  20  minutes.   3. Barista refused to make latte in 8oz  would only put it in a 12oz. No common sense or customer service.   4. Parking is awful.
Radio Coffee & Beer,148,This place is way busier than I thought. Plenty of seating  not enough parking. Be prepared to park a block or so out during the weekend. There is more seating outside than inside  making it a great spot when the weather is nice.  They serve coffee and beer  so pick your poison. I did not get coffee  but got a chai latte instead. Their chai is not sweet  but heavier on the spice side. Still good   There is also a Veracruz food truck...so why not pair some awesome breakfast tacos with your coffee...or beer 
Radio Coffee & Beer,149,I absolutely love this spot  Both the indoor and outdoor areas are wonderful. Radio had a ton of outdoor seating and is also dog friendly   The vibe here is so laid back and great  Also  you can grab some delicious tacos from Veracruz all natural which is a huge plus   There is a good amount of parking in the parking lot behind radio. I love this place and will continue to visit 
Radio Coffee & Beer,150,Good amount of seating and coffee was good. Knocked off stars for price - I paid just under  9 for a latte. That included  1 tip and extra shot of espresso  but that still seems absolutely absurd for bean water with milk -  6   . It was iced  so much space is taken up by ice and no skill is needed to throw it together since there s no latte art  foaming involved.   Maybe will return for food trucks but will get my coffee elsewhere for more reasonable prices.
Radio Coffee & Beer,151,A go-to outdoor chill spot in a low-key area of Austin. Grab some delicious food from Paperboy  I recommend the Buffalo cauliflower and the hashbrown  or some tacos from Veracruz  a drink from Radio and you are set   They serve Stumptown beans  quite a variety of beers  and have DELICIOUS Kombucha on tap.   A lot of families come here with kids  but there is a huge blend of people- ultra hipsters reading poetry books  laptop people  dates  friends  you name it. Highly recommend stopping by if you are vacationing in Austin for a real taste of what the culture is like.
Radio Coffee & Beer,152,It is Hip  young and crowded  during the weekday 8 30 am to 11 am slots  ... Have visited twice.  Had their expresso  and house coffee. My family  college  had tried their cappuccino and hot chocolate. The atmosphere is very casual  rustic and the team behind the bar are pretty Friendly  plenty of outdoor seating but during the mornings I have visited  the inside is loud and crowded... Unfortunately  the flavors I tried were not to my liking. Parking out front or in the back  so good luck if the wave of the crowd hits  10am rush . I can t recommend this place to anyone.  While obviously it is neat  they have food trucks outside and lots of outdoor seating  some with heat for those cool mornings   I can t see myself returning because I did not enjoy their brews.  Neither did my family .  So  we will pass on this establishment for the future.
Radio Coffee & Beer,153,Great cofFee and fun environment    the espressos were smooth and rich   Fun food trucks in the yard  Great vibe
Radio Coffee & Beer,154,Cons  1.  Coffee is expensive and bland. Not worth the prices you pay or the 20 minute lines.  2.  You must get there early for the breakfast food truck or else the wait is 45 min.  3.  Limited parking spaces as it s always so crowded.  Pros  1.  Plenty of outdoor seating space where you can bring your dog.  2.  Live music in the evening.  3.  Breakfast from the food truck is amazing 
Radio Coffee & Beer,155,This place was dope. Great atmosphere   loved the staff. Coffee what top notch and the pastry i had hit the spot. Worked here for almost 2 hrs while traveling through and ao glad i picked this place to camp out for a bit. A   
Radio Coffee & Beer,156,Great location for food  Veracruz   coffee  beer  kombucha and live music. There is ample indoor and outdoor seating and lovely gardens. I know this place can get super busy for lunch and the wait can be around an hour or more so get there early. There are large rows of picnic tables outside if you go with a larger group of people. Parking is always difficult but worth the walk if you have to park down the street.
Radio Coffee & Beer,157,Great little coffee shop.  As someone new to Austin  I was excited to check out what I was told is the best coffee shop in Austin.  I was pleased with the coffee and the atmosphere but it didn t blow my mind.  Maybe my expectations were out of wack but it was still a good experience.    One point I missed was the Tacos at Veracruz.  I was told Radio had the best breakfast tacos so when I went to order food inside  all they had were pastries.  Once I got my coffee and scone  I went outside and later saw the food truck.  Would have been helpful if the barista mentioned that when I asked for tacos but oh well.  Maybe next time 
Radio Coffee & Beer,158,Indoor. Outdoor. Shade. Food trucks. Beer. Coffee. Tea. All very very good.. The staff is happy and funny and attentive. What s not to like  The Vera Cruz tacos are sooo good. The organic tea comes in a super cute pot. Self serve water for that 106 degree day. One of my fav revolver beers. This place always sparks excellent conversation. I like it. Alot.
Radio Coffee & Beer,159,This is a very popular place and just like anything popular  the popularity tends to destroy the original concept of the place. It s now a super crowded bar  with communal seating for the masses.   Pros- good taco truck- pet friendly- local beers- good coffee and some wine options.  Monday night is blue grass and that s super fun.   Cons- overly crowded-hard to find parking-kids running around-all the patio is a smoking area    Dogs all over-not enough food options. WiFi not available after 5pm.
Radio Coffee & Beer,160,The service here has been much better here the last few times I ve been. With all the extra outdoor seating  it s a good place to meet friends for an evening drink or have a relaxed business meeting.
Radio Coffee & Beer,161,Quite a lot of beer on tap on top of what they list online.  Looks about 20 taps and range from type  but always a few IPA.  Pretty reasonable prices at around  6-7 and offer much more in terms of cocktails and coffee and tea for those not into the beers.  Of course Veracruz and great tacos out back and Thai food coming soon.  Dog friendly patio and good WiFi without password  love it  .  Parking a little small in the actual parking lot but plenty of street parking int he neighborhood down the road.  Really nothing negative to say about Radio.  Tons of events offered throughout the week and although seats inside do get taken rather quickly  especially on weekends  there is a huge sitting area outside that s covered.  One of the best spots for a real Austin experience.
Radio Coffee & Beer,162,Went on a Wednesday afternoon  while it was pouring outside. The employees were very sweet and everyone wore masks when inside the establishment. There s no seating inside right now due to Covid but there s plenty of outside seating  and food trucks around so that you can get some food with your coffee. It s quite a large place actually. The bathrooms were clean which is nice  Will be going back and definitely recommend
Radio Coffee & Beer,163,I had iced coffee  I wish the gentleman had asked if I wanted room or not. I ended up pouring the iced coffee out of the glass cup and into a plastic water so I could have room to put cream and sugar in it.  But no worries. Partner had hot coffee  I tried it  very flavorful.  Friend had a blood and honey. Friend said it was delicious and that Radio had a wonderful large selection of beers.
Radio Coffee & Beer,164,I can t believe they turn off their WIFI over the weekend. Not only that  they turn off the WIFI after 5pm on weekdays. What a joke  That is just ridiculous.  Are we back to 1980s or something    I much rather go to Summermoon.  They have better coffee  good tacos  although not as good as Veracruz s   and... wait for it..... free Wifi    Haha
Radio Coffee & Beer,165,We came here twice the weekend we were in Austin. Partially because it was close to our Airbnb but then the second time because we liked it so much  They have coffee and beer on tap  what more do you need   with a huge outdoor space and an awesome taco truck on site  separate business - I think it s called Veracruz . Great local beer selection. Super friendly staff  great music  really typical Austin vibe - loved it  On one of the 90  degree days they had little pools out for cooling   sitting  Super fun.
Radio Coffee & Beer,166,Love the setting and atmosphere of this place. Every time I visit from California I stop by here. The staff are not the nicest. This past time we visited  left a bad impression.
Radio Coffee & Beer,167,I absolutely love Radio  I only knocked one star because I think their pasties stand to upgrade .  Overall for ambiance  the taco truck  the lattes and a really fun trivia night every Wednesday  I recommend that everyone visiting Austin stop by Radio. It s just fun.
Radio Coffee & Beer,168,Love this place  always have always will...took me virtually three years to do this review though. The thing that makes this place so great is the people that work here  they always have a spirit about them that is unmatched by other coffee shops around town.   The expansive outdoor seating is very inviting and offers ample space to sprawl out. Whether you re enjoying a simple cup of coffee or you need a place to focus  this place is great. The indoor area is also very well done  with a very low key chill vibe  wood walls  good music and artwork everywhere.   The food options are also great with two food trucks onsite as well as a decent array of pastries inside.   Definitely one of my go to spots and will remain to be as such for the foreseeable future.
Radio Coffee & Beer,169,Lots of great outdoor space  so if the weather is good  worth a visit. The yard by Manchaca is fenced and has a tree where kids can run a bit which is nice too. Don t book a business coffee here on a summer day though  unless you want to get drenched in sweat -- the indoor area is small  perpetually crowded  and loud.  Good coffee. Disappointing chai. Very small pastry selection. Yummy taco truck  but also slow and crowded during busy breakfast hours.   Overall I really like this place  though honestly I don t understand the cultish buzz that leads to crazy crowds and impossible parking. There are plenty of other good places nearby too that aren t such a crush of humanity during peak hours.
Radio Coffee & Beer,170,Lots of great things to say 1  this super nice person with short hair and a striped shirt saw my coffee get knocked over today and got me a new one   So above and beyond 2  the music today is BOMB make this person do the music everyday   
Radio Coffee & Beer,171,This place is so cute  It s like a little house with a big patio. I love the taco truck outside. The coffee was delicious and they do a cute job on lattes. It wasn t too busy when we went but it filled up fast. This is definitely a great place to meet up with friends or just chill
Radio Coffee & Beer,172,The outside space was amazing  The staff was helpful  since it was our first time there.
Radio Coffee & Beer,173,Space  The building and the outside patios  and lights  are all beautiful and well constructed. It s very modern and it s not a converted strip mall  like Strange Brew down the street. The space is clean  well-designed  and in a part of town that is starving for coffee shops. There are flowers and actual landscaping  etc.   Food  There s a Vera Cruz taco truck with some of the best tacos in Austin right in the parking lot  and they serve East Side Pies pizza inside by the slice until it runs out. I tried the migas tacos and really liked them.    Coffee  There are lots of coffees  draft coffee   and beers  and I look forward to coming back. It s less down and out than Strange Brew  which seems to have switched gears to live music  which is fine.   Noise  The outdoor music was a little loud  as was the construction noise happening around us at 2 00 on a Saturday. But I went the first week and I m sure these issues have all resolved themselves now.   Issues  The only issues are 1  the parking. There seem to have been lots of complaints about that already. 2  good space for the kids. There are lots of families visiting  and so it would be neat to have a little slide or toy area or something that more and more places have these days.   The spot sort of reminds me of the Thunderbird on Manor Road. I would recommend it to anyone  and look forward to going back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,174,Pretty cool place. Lots of outdoor seating  adequate parking  pretty good beer selection  they do have some red white rose bubbles.   NOTE  you can open a tab inside at the bar  but they keep your card  so then you have to close out your tab if you want to use your card to order tacos at the taco truck outside .
Radio Coffee & Beer,175,Radio has some great qualities  but it s time I broke up with her -   I d be remiss if I didn t mention her finer qualities - the outdoor space is great - kid and dog friendly. Casual. Very Austin. The food trucks are great. If you don t try the migas at Vera Cruz  you don t love food or tacos  so do us all a favor and move to Dallas.   BUT.......  The service here is consistently poor. As in  do you enjoy walking up to the counter to order and get a  what do you want  barked at you  With  no eye contact  No smile with a side of a complete uninterested and unfriendly vibe  Sadly  it s not just a barista having a bad day - It s been like this for the few years I ve been patronizing Radio. I won t go on and on about how important customer service is and how the people you hire can make or break your business - I mean  I hesitated writing about this because well  maybe it s not something others value  but I believe it s REALLY important they know care stop.    Bottom line is there are too many other great  local coffee shops in Austin to settle for being treated crappily  so I ll protest with my money and this review which I hope is taken to heart. Farewell Radio  it s been nice knowing you.
Radio Coffee & Beer,176,Came here once for coffee and beer  and I like it. The patio is pretty  the inside is warm and inviting  the staff are quick but friendly  and I enjoyed both the coffee and the beer. Would certainly go back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,177,Cool place to hang out. A smoking spot  2 food trucks  a bar  and some coffee. Lots of seating  fun bartenders baristas.
Radio Coffee & Beer,178,Great coffee  The in-doors coffee-house is full of people working away on their macs. The shady patio has a bit more of a chill vibe. Veracruz taco truck on-site earns this place an extra star 
Radio Coffee & Beer,179,We stopped in here after we had some lunch. It has a cool vibe and many beers to choose from. I was astounded at all the people working on laptops. There weren t any seats to be had inside  and it was 2 30 on a Wednesday.......crazy. I would definitely visit again.
Radio Coffee & Beer,180,Fist time visiting this place  parking was a bit of a hassle but then I did go when it was a weekday during the afternoon rush hour traffic. Very spacious area with so many places to choose from  I decided to check out the inside and got myself a cappuccino. It was made really fast and it was delicious. Inside it s a great ambience go read a book  people watch or have a conversation with a friend. Definitely will be going back  Great customer service and friendly staff.
Radio Coffee & Beer,181,Friendly staff  plenty of seating  both indoors and out . Pastries looked amazing  but we did not try any. Iced lattes were perfect. Eclectic customers made for an enjoyable experience.   Grabbed breakfast tacos from the truck that were delish   Outdoor dog friendly.
Radio Coffee & Beer,182,I ve been going to Radio for five years  and am pleased to see its growth. I love the live music  food trucks  and the atmosphere. It s super close to the bus stop as well  so I don t have to worry about parking. I think the staff has been fairly quick  even when it gets busy  which is not a small feat.
Radio Coffee & Beer,183,Positives  great atmosphere vibe. Outdoor seating. Excellent coffee beer selection and staff overall pays attention to detail in making your drink. Veracruz food truck is also amazing  some of the best tacos quesadillas  and conveniently located here as well.  I live close by and come by all the time.   Negatives  No WiFi on the weekends. Can get ridiculously crowded sometimes and parking will most likely be a challenge.   Conclusion  An Austin favorite  in my opinion  You should pay multiple visits to this establishment.
Radio Coffee & Beer,184,Picnic tables  Pick Nick s table  Coffee and drinks  Jane Fonda hasn t visited here  Didn t see a radio
Radio Coffee & Beer,185,What isn t there to love about this place   The only thing I can think of is that it isn t located closer to North Austin.  Thankfully it isn t  too  far to get here from my dog s southerly located groomer.  I will drive the extra few minutes further past my former  coffee wait spot to head here.  It s just that good and everyone else knows it too. Just a few months old  and yet it had an endless line of patrons waiting to order drinks throughout my several hour stay here.    This is no shabby coffee shack. As you drive up the first goal is to just find a parking spot. While there is a small parking lot  I never once saw a free spot  and down the road the neighborhood street was completely full.  They have a great well kept up outdoor seating area  with a Veracruz Natural food truck serving up fresh tacos. Inside is inviting in wood tones  but not upscale modern.  The staff are super friendly and talkative.  The next goal is to find a place to sit  their are plenty of outlets for your computer along the wall  but not many smaller tables  you might need to ask a neighbor to share something.  They should invest in some outlets along the bar.  They offer a variety of eating options  pastries  pharmacy caf  gluten free pastries  the ones wrapped in plastic   Veracruz Natural Tacos  or East Side pies.  They have a great beer selection well paired with their amazing Stumptown coffee.  It s not surprising that the owner while a native Texan  spent sometime amongst the coffee gurus in my hometown Seattle.  It s like bringing the best of both worlds to Austin.  I couldn t believe they even served the Stumptown nitro draft style right next to it s neighboring beer friends.  After some of that  I am forever ruined.  I can t have Stumptown cold brew any other way now. They even had some decent loose leaf teas that they served to you in a tea kettle.  Just go up front to check out the plastic menu s off to the side at the cash register too order  and wait for your order before sitting down.  Rare to say you have a favorite coffee - beer joint.
Radio Coffee & Beer,186,During our week in Austin  we came to Radio three times  which I guess is a testament to how lovely it is. All of those times were in the morning in search of a caffeine fix  and their nitro cold brew definitely did the trick. The place was always busy  and there was always a long line  but it always went quickly.   A couple times we got breakfast tacos from Veracruz and sat outside on the benches in the sun  enjoying watching all the people stopping by  families playing with their little ones  freelancers hurriedly typing away  old friends leisurely catching up  folks en route to work swinging by for coffee to go...  I love how much space this place has  both inside and out  and the casual and relaxed vibe is so great  especially when paired with the good coffee and incredible beer I saw was on tap. They have a lot of parking too  so big ups for that. Next time I m in town it would be awesome to catch some live music or a movie.
Radio Coffee & Beer,187,This place is cute with lots of seating both inside and out. I just went for coffee and because I wanted one of those gorgeous lattes with a foamy white heart on top. They did not disappoint. The only downside was the looooooong line. I guess a lot of people want something more fancy than just a black coffee so it takes awhile. That said  it was worth the wait.   Also  great place to meet someone for a first date. Not too loud  but a decent sized crowd and spaced out enough that you don t feel like anyone is eavesdropping on your awkward conversation.  Man  I hope that particular  someone  reads this review and takes me there again   
Radio Coffee & Beer,188,Austin has many great microbreweries and coffee bars  so I wasn t quite sure how Radio would measure up  but I have to say this place is my number one go to for coffee and beer and they have game nights and live music and plenty of outdoor seating. I must admit I am a bit of a coffee and craft beer snob  but Radio Coffee and Bar definitely measured up and I come here almost daily for my daily coffee fix.   This place is absolutely amazing  the prices are decent and the staff is so friendly  the atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable. Their is plenty of seating but unfortunately not very much parking so by prepared to park a block away on weekends. That is the only negative that I can think of  but a lot of people have complained about the tab at the bar.   To keep a tab open which I highly recommend  they keep your physical credit card with them  not uncommon  but I understand how that can bother some people. I personally had no issues with that because I planned on getting another beer or coffee when I go there. I just use cash or my other credit card for food  They have paper boy food truck in the mornings and that is what I get in the mornings when I am there and I go to Veracruz at night and get the fish tacos. Both food trucks serve phenomenal food for a decent price. I recommend the espresso  or an iced mocha for coffee and my favorite ale would be the zoey ale. But they have great draft choices so even a beer snob will find a beer.   It is pet friendly. Everyone is so friendly and kind  if I had to go get another beer  other customers would stop by to keep my dogs from crying or to just say hi  which my dogs as puppies greatly appreciated. Luckily everyone was very patient with one of my dogs as she would cry if I left to use the restroom or get another beer  her separation anxiety has gotten worse  so bringing her here or anywhere is not possible any longer but the one time that I did  I had many generous people offer to watch her while I went inside.
Radio Coffee & Beer,189,I ve been coming here lately for the outdoor space   which is nice and casual  but I honestly haven t been that impressed and think I ll try a new spot  too many to choose from  soon. Parking is an absolute nightmare and happy hour prices are insulting  especially for Austin. I paid  9 for a 6oz tap margarita... on happy hour... in Austin  I don t like places that really think they are something and can take advantage of their status. I ll be finding a more humble spot soon.
Radio Coffee & Beer,190,I originally came here on their opening night and had what I came to dub  3-Layers of Heaven  which is an off-menu concoction of Guiness  Espresso  and chocolate syrup  I know and you re welcome    which is exactly as delicious as it sounds  However  it is a  7 treat because they charge you for the beer and reg price of a double shot...it is what it is.  I also had some nice  rare bottle beer choices  but had some  sticker shock  here as well as they were not published anywhere that I could find.  But  other than the price tag surprise at the register  this is a hip little coffee shop with a bar and I can already tell after a completely fully occupied interior on my second visit that this place is a S. Lamar hit.   I had their on-tap Kombucha my 2nd time around and it was pretty good. It made a nice accompaniment to my Veracruz tacos.  There is ample outdoor seating  but beware  as with every other new restaurant bar attraction to pop in Austin  parking is an issue. You will have to seek out either residential street parking or wait until nightfall to park in the back of the auto-parts store which I was told is  allowed  by a fellow desperate parking seeker.  They serve pizza inside  but I am not exactly sure what kind  they are outsourced from a local place  or for how much as I did not see a menu to this effect.  I don t see myself going out my way to come here  but it is a decent spot to grab a brew  amp  brew when my accompanying my friends.
Radio Coffee & Beer,191,This place has an amazing atmosphere.  Came here the other night to hang out for a friend s birthday and to grab some drinks.  Unfortunately it was about to rain  so we decided to hang out inside but the outdoor space looked like so much fun.  They have lots of covered seating and food trucks every night - definitely want to sit out there at some point during the summer   The inside was not disappointing by any means.  They had a great live band that brought in a great audience.  The music was awesome and was not too loud to have a conversation. I bet they have great bands all the time here.  Oh and the best part is that they have Left Hand Milk Stout on Nitro  It was like having an adult milk shake - so creamy    I d definitely recommend this place to hang out with friends - it s a bit dodgy to find parking but after you get over that hurdle it s smooth sailing from there 
Radio Coffee & Beer,192,Good drip  on the lighter roast side . Nice outdoor area for hanging out while still social distancing. The owner is a really cool  helpful  down to earth guy... out in parking lot helping us maneuver the lot. Looks like it would be fun at night too.
Radio Coffee & Beer,193,I really enjoyed the Ice Mocha it was delicious. I love how you could taste the shots of coffee. It was a right balance.   The environment is lively and enthusiastic. Right for studying if you don t mind background noise or to hangout. Planning on returning.   Not giving it a five because need to return again.
Radio Coffee & Beer,194,My favorite coffee shop in Austin   Highly recommend  if you can find parking
Radio Coffee & Beer,195,The Coffee  the beer bar  the people  the food trucks  the coffee  oh did I say that already ... the  and last but not least...THE COFFEE  Get over there ASAP   Shout out to  pacificfoods for the  baristaseries nonmilk used at Radio   We love that coconut  rice  and almond milk.
Radio Coffee & Beer,196,They have the best tacos from the Veracruz truck and they re like  3. They also have this breakfast truck that has cinnamon toast and cheesy hash browns. Huge patio and mimosas  beer  or coffee. Always a good time.
Radio Coffee & Beer,197,Food trucks available for some delicious breakfast. Only had the coffee which was just fine. Will have to go back for drinks. They have an outside area which is great for bringing your dog.
Radio Coffee & Beer,198,This place is so awesome  Great beers and a fun Bluegrass Monday night. We didn t try the coffee  but I hear it s great too. There s a taco truck on site with tasty food  so that you ll find what you need for a good time.  PLUS  it s dog and family friendly... people can hang out with their families and pets  in a chill atmosphere.  Definitely recommend it 
Radio Coffee & Beer,199,I love this place. Chai tea is phenomenal  the place is comfortable  the food trucks in the back are great and the pastries are super tasty. The beer list is good and the staff are friendly. I could hang here every single day and never get bored.   Brew  amp  Brew would normally be my go-to but it s more than twice as far as Radio. Parking can be a challenge  but that s city life.   _   _    The people who come here are pretty chill  which makes it easy to look forward to returning.
Radio Coffee & Beer,200,More parking added  Just behind the coyote mural.  Great coffee. Super staff. Quiet in the mornings until around 8 45. I love that it s an old house  and how can you beat a place that you can both start and end you day  Events after hours from live music to movies and trivia night. Did I mention a great happy hour   
Radio Coffee & Beer,201,One of the classiest coffee places in the city - hands down.  The coffee itself is outstanding.   Many places when they offer a  premium custom gourmet special  espresso -  what is often offered is an indifferent not-worth-it coffee.    This means you  Houndstooth.   Here  the premium beans are worth it and they are expertly brewed.  The location is spectacular.   Everyone hangs around outside like they do at the Draught House Pub -  But the outdoor setup is much nicer than that at the Draught House Pub   More greenery  more room  more space  heaters   Two excellent food trailers don t exactly hurt the outdoor ambience.  Indoors there is a ton of room and a lot of seats. Big tables to work at and the chairs are actually comfortable. Decorating is dark but with fine windows to bring in the light.  One quirk. They only have internet monday thru friday bankers hours.  They do coffee by day and beer by night and weekends.  although both are available at all times   But they really take seriously the idea of work 9-5  play nights and weekends.  I was there on a weekend afternoon and there were plenty of tables with some people drinking coffee and others drinking beer.    A few people were drinking both. Hey  keep Austin Weird.   I did not need internet this visit  but normally no internet is a deal breaker for me.  However  I have gotten so used to the internet cutting out from overuse at prime office coffee houses - that I now travel with my own MyFi just on general principles.  So Radio can t stop me from using the internet       BWAH HA HA HA HA        Maniacal laughter followed by a wild eyed impersonation of a mad scientist in the movies.   The bottom line here is that the quirky internet policies here are not a problem.   That opens up Radio s other serious positives as something to be taken seriously.  The crowd is massively cool.  Both the coffee menu and the beer menus are first rate.  The food trailers are a great addition.  The physical ambience can t be beat.  And the place has plenty of room.  So what more do you want   A great place to both work and play.
Radio Coffee & Beer,202,Hmm...where to start. The only redeeming aspect of this dive is that it has ample outdoor seating that is well shaded. That is  of course  if you can find a parking spot  good luck with that . I try to stay out of south Austin as much as possible and this afternoon was a good reminder of why. It was busy  not surprising for a lovely Saturday  but the staff was just miserable. No playful banter or talking to guests  they all kept their heads down and avoided eye contact. The drinks are terrible here and I  was astonished that I paid  11 for 3 sips of a weak Mexican martini. I then ordered a frozen sangria margarita swirl. The drink I was given was purely frozen sangria  when I told them it wasn t what I ordered and asked if they could add frozen margarita to it  they refused  Bad energy at this place. What happened to the old Austin with laidback vibes and happy hippies  First and last visit. Oh  and the food trailer is overpriced as well.  20 for two tacos  guac  and a bag of chips.
Radio Coffee & Beer,203,Veracruz Taco Truck - delicioso salsas                                        Cozumel Curry Truck - healthful fabulous flavor for all kinds Basically always happy to visit Radio.  See someone ya know  Tasty beers   coffee  wine  Apple commercial inside  3 separate outdoor spaces Always chat with others at the picnic tables Hipster service  Weekly events Its legit
Radio Coffee & Beer,204,My absolute favorite place to grab a capucino and a beer at the same time. Easily the best patio for a coffee bar combo. I usually come around 11am  so I am always undecided whether to get a 512 or coffee  so I end up getting both. Working as a nurse at night  I don t feel any shame in this.   So  let s talk about the man buns. This is a hot Austin spot with lots of prime time Austin people watching. You will not be diasappointed. This is where I learned about men with man buns and the new trend...braids. And of course  there are lots of beards and women who look like the 60s never went away.   Last thing  fun dogs to look at. Dog friendly is a major plus 
Radio Coffee & Beer,205,The female barista with the curly reddish hair just made me the best Caffe Mocha I ve ever had. The temp was perfect and allowed me to drink it right away. It also wasn t too sweet or bitter and she took the time to paint a heart with the cream. I love the vibe and coffee here.
Radio Coffee & Beer,206,Solid and steady. Good beers and coffee. Excellent staff. Indoor and outdoor seating. No WiFi on the weekends is odd.   Parking can be tight  there is a second lot behind the building.
Radio Coffee & Beer,207,From a coffee drinker s perspective  This place has a lot of outdoor seating so it s nice for good weather and possibly a change of scenery when working  minus the smoke and as long as you don t have any qualms about sitting close to hipsters and the like consuming alcohol in the middle of the day . While I can t say that anyone was particularly rude or that the coffee was bad  I also cannot say that I was all that impressed with either.  I like to give everyone the benefit of doubt so will preface the following by saying that it s possible I misunderstood but on my second visit yesterday  the vibe was not exactly warm when inquiring about ingredients in a coffee drink that I planned to order. When it comes to the coffee itself  I have not been impressed with the flavor either time. I don t know what it is but just not what my taste buds prefer. Perhaps the focus is more on alcohol sells than anything else.
Radio Coffee & Beer,208,If I lived in Austin this would totally be my local.  You ve got craft been and chai on tap. Yes. Dog friendly.  Yes.  Food truck.  Jesus are you trying to trap me Here   Stumptown roasters here. Highly recommend.
Radio Coffee & Beer,209,Stopped in here for a cup of coffee and was hoping for a dessert.  My wife got a hazelnut latte and I got a cold brew.  We both thought our coffees were great.  The only thing missing  really nothing to offer for dessert or a pastry.  Now if they could get a dessert food truck to park in the back  this would be a spot we would frequent more regularly.
Radio Coffee & Beer,210,This place is terrible     don t go near it         Of course I m not telling you the truth.  As an out-o-towner with a few mobility issues  I found Radio C amp B to be delightful and accommodating.  I took in the Monday night Bluegrass  amp  enjoyed everything about it except the late-June heat  I ve lived in Wisconsin for 40 years .  I hope the lazy amongst you see the headline and stay away b c it was crowded.  Despite that  there was a place to sit w some pretty nice people near the front  so it s all good.  There are craft beers to drink  coffee for you c-achievers  and Great taco truck  bar food   amp  breakfast fare for morning stops.  Great Place  um  y all    
Radio Coffee & Beer,211,We needed our morning fix  amp  didn t have much time  amp  radio was en route.  We were happy we stopped   This place is legit.    That said  the next day we stopped in  amp  my cortado was too hot  amp  bitter.  It was a different barista  so     Not the Top in Austin  but close enough   A little hit-or-miss  but I ll still get coffee here if my other faves aren t available.
Radio Coffee & Beer,212,One of my all time fav ATX coffee spots. Great environment to work  meet up with friends  or just go enjoy a beautiful day. Lots of outdoor seating and some indoor and bar seats too. Their Desert Tea is my absolute favorite and I d definitely recommend trying it. They also have beer  wine  and some baked goods that are pretty good. If you re there long enough to need a real meal  there are food tucks in there outdoor area. Parking can be somewhat tricky if the lot s full but there is some street parking super close by. They often have some interesting evening events so be sure to check out the calendar while you re there. I really want to go during one of their trivia nights. We ve caught the tail end of one on accident and it looked like a blast   Can t say enough good things about Radio. Love this place.
Radio Coffee & Beer,213,This place has a cool radio signal logo and the sign outside is great. I had a capp and it s pretty tasty. There is a lot of wood floor and the raised stage means entertainment. It s very very dark which is no problem when the sun is up but before sun ..... not sure how these folks iPads  books  newspapers readers can see too well. Music is chill. I like it very much. There are patio tables outside for enjoying the air. I ll be back 
Radio Coffee & Beer,214,Parking is tight and it can get very busy  However  they have great coffee  chai tea  beer  a Bloody Mary  various baked goods and more.  There s seating both inside and out  Veracruz and Paperboy food trucks on site for tacos  sandwiches and more   I enjoyed my experience here and I can t wait to go back   The staff is friendly and helpful  which is always appreciated 
Radio Coffee & Beer,215,Cool coffee shop with chill vibe and both indoor and outdoor seating. Very popular around 1 PM on a Friday. Great coffee. Veracruz taco truck in backyard. Heated outdoor patio
Radio Coffee & Beer,216,I absolutely love this place. Good vibes all around. Before COVID their live music and comedy nights were the best and are greatly missed. However  they ve done a great job since with things being open  spacious  and clean.
Radio Coffee & Beer,217,I m in love. It s so perfect. In every way     First of all  there is plenty of seating inside and outside and you can even just bring a blanket and sit on the grass...with your dog. Like the good old days.  Second  they have equally good coffee and equally good beer. It s a rare occasion I drink coffee past noon  but I needed it. Had an iced mocha with almond milk  delish.   Decided to order a healthy taco from the food truck  Veracruz which was also delish  smart move  guys . Read my review on that one  next  -   I played some musical chairs in different areas outside until fellow Yelper Benigno A. arrived. We ordered some beers  Live Oak  a fave  and briefly watched a band play  which was excellent.  Everyone was so laid back and relaxed. An all-around great place. You won t be bored here...it has everything you need    
Radio Coffee & Beer,218,Great cafe bar spot. Awesome neighborhood vibe  especially on Bluegrass Mondays which is a total scene.  They have all types of nifty  trendy coffees and beers on tap and brew.  I just wish they had hard alcohol  The ambiance inside is a study chill vibe whereas outside you have picnic tables  lawn and food trucks.  I guess it s kind of a something for everyone type of place..... Unless your something is booze.  Lots of hot guys too  should I add a star for that 
Radio Coffee & Beer,219,Love the atmosphere of the place. Food trucks are great outside   the salsas are good   the only thing I wish they had was matcha. They have teas though  green tea  etc   Another thing that is great here is the kombucha on tap  
Radio Coffee & Beer,220,What a cool place. Parking is funky. Seating is erratic outside but plenty of room. Food trucks outside.  I love this place   
Radio Coffee & Beer,221,Trendy  hipster coffee and craft beer spot in south Austin. The inside is loud and full of laptop people. However  there is plenty of outdoor seating with food trucks if you are hungry. I had an iced vanilla latte that was good but not remarkable. Cool spot if you are into this kind of thing. Warning  Parking is limited and the layout is chaotic 
Radio Coffee & Beer,222,This is a pretty neat place to listen to live music. Monday s they have a bluegrass group that is really good.   Inside you can order beer  coffee  or teas. If you are hungry they have Veracruz food truck and recently added paperboy food truck. Both are really good   Oh can also bring your own chairs and your dog to sit outside  but they do have picnic table seating throughout the outside.
Radio Coffee & Beer,223,Great stop for anyone who likes coffee or beer. Pretty great atmosphere as long as you don t mind bringing some noise canceling headphones for your laptop. Potentially a great place to meet people or meet with people    Cortado is smooth and silky. Highly recommend.
Radio Coffee & Beer,224,Hands down this place makes the best cappuccino in Austin  I ve had many cappuccinos from many places but radio has them all beat by far  I don t think I d like cappuccino so much if it wasn t for radio. Love love love
Radio Coffee & Beer,225,Let me start by saying  I don t live in Austin  I never have.  I have visited this city twice on the taxpayer s dime and both times I have been immensely impressed by this city s food and music scene.    Radio Coffee and beer is no exception.  The environment of this establishment rivals any coffee shop or bar in the area.  I would be distraught if I were to visit this city and not spend a few hours at this fine establishment.  Not only do they understand how to make a proper coffee drink  but the understand the importance of a well poured pint.  The beer selection is local and delicious.  The coffee is beyond reproach.  The only bad time to visit is mid afternoon  and the only reason it s bad is you have a tough time deciding between coffee and beer  based only upon your plans for the rest of the day.  If the coffee and beer wasn t enough  they ha the BEST. DAMN. TACO. TRUCK. in Austin parked in their own backyard.  If you don t love Veracruz Tacos  then you don t love tacos.
Radio Coffee & Beer,226,I wanted to like this place. Went here to do some work but was told they don t offer WiFi after 5 pms. This is the owners policy to try to bring in a more  hangout  vibe  aka sell more alcohol. I get it  but to take away WiFi to try and change a crowd seems like terrible business to me.   Anyways  decided to get my 16 oz latte to go. Once poured in a to go cup  it was obvious that I was getting cheated on the drink size. The latte filled up a little more than half of a 12 oz cup. Resisting the urge to be that guy and complain  I decided to leave and share my opinion here.  And maybe I m projecting my bad experience into my Chai  but it tastes awful.
Radio Coffee & Beer,227,Espresso  excellent  Wi-fi  don t know  because they kill it  after 5pm   Outlets  close to most desks along walls  Seating  good number of tables.  Great outdoor space.  Additional taco truck.  Cafe  clean  woody feel  Baristi  very good   Notes  Lighting is terrible for working after sundown.  Parking is tough  as it s so popular  and you have to be careful not to park in the permit-only street parking areas.
Radio Coffee & Beer,228,A awesome versatile spot  Morning  noon  and night it s got a low key vibe. Seating inside or an eclectic smattering of tables  benches  and chairs outside. 2 food trucks.  I dig the hell out of the tacos.  Staff is always great   Cons  has free WiFi  also a pro...   but people hunker down and sit for hours  mostly single individuals  making seating and parking an issue sometimes. I would never take a star off for that  seeing as it s not the fault of Radio  just more of a heads up to fellow Yelpers.
Radio Coffee & Beer,229,My fianc  and I decided to make a pit stop here on a day of wedding planning to recenter and reenergize. I didn t partake in the coffee drinking as it was a little late for me to be caffeinated  but fianc  enjoyed his cold brew. It was pretty crowded for a Saturday around noon  we found some seating inside at the bar overlooking their front yard. It was really dog friendly and had ample seating outside  they even has some tents out due to the off on rainy weather which I thought was nice. I don t see this being a place I would come to get work done or anything but it would be a nice place to catch up with friends.
Radio Coffee & Beer,230,Best mocha ever  And the food trailers outside are both YUMMY  It s a bit out of the way for me  that whenever I m in this area I will definitely stop in
Radio Coffee & Beer,231,Delicious beer and I fell in love with the courtyard and the lil foodtrucks they have.
Radio Coffee & Beer,232,Updating my review to 5 stars because they added more tables and put a freaking Paperboy food truck out front  my fave   heck yes   I love you  Radio.
Radio Coffee & Beer,233,This is my favorite south side hangout. There is always a nice variety of beer on tap  and the bartenders are very friendly. They have an awesome outdoor space  and it s very dog friendly. Love both of the food trucks there. Recommend the fish tacos at Veracruz.
Radio Coffee & Beer,234,This is located on the other side of town from where I live  but it was worth the trip. Love the outdoor patio area as well as the indoor space.
Radio Coffee & Beer,235,Laid back environment with dogs  outdoor tables  shady areas  wooden patios  inside seating  cold beer  pizza  coffee and deserts.  I see pie hats  tattoos  hipsters  piercings  funky sideburns   plaid shirts  a food truck and folks fooling around on their computers. All in all a cool SOUTH Austin and a great  place to wait for new tires from TIRE MAN.
Radio Coffee & Beer,236,This is my favorite place in South Austin to hang out with friends. Excellent food trucks  coffee  beer and plenty of outdoor seating.
Radio Coffee & Beer,237,This is everything you could want in a local hangout.  PROS  Every seating configuration known to man - tables  communal tables  bartop  outdoor covered  outdoor uncovered  outdoor bartop  greenhouse  didn t know that was a thing .  There s heaters in many areas. There s live events  music  trivia  local stuff  etc. They make their own Chai. It s spicy - the perfect sort of thing for winter throats. They have good coffee at reasonable prices. They have good beer at reasonable prices. They have a happy hour. 4-7 every day.  CONS  You may have to interact with other people. Parking can be a challenge as Manchaca doesn t have a dedicated turn lane for the side street or main lot. But that s a city issue  not a Radio issue.  In closing  If you live in South Austin  there s no reason to not use this as a staging area or meetup point  or daily coffee fix  or daily happy hour decompression beer and taco fix. In essence  I can think of 15 reasons to stop in off the top of my head  and zero not to.
Radio Coffee & Beer,238,This was my dad s local haunt and she brought me here when I first moved to Austin. While I was job searching and living off my savings from a previous job  I spent weeks at Radio unwinding from a previously toxic job as I gathered myself and looked to start working again.   I met so many interesting people and made so many friends at Radio  and always felt comfortable making art and socializing.  As a queer individual with a trans parent  Radio always made us feel super welcome and a part of the family.  I ve since moved to Clarksville to make my bike commute to work shorter  and I m constantly missing this wonderful establishment  If only I could easily bike there...
Radio Coffee & Beer,239,I m so late to this party it s not even fashionable.. but holy coffee  this place is uhmazing. I hosted a little work from home party here  fingers crossed that the space would be conducive to said WFH. It was perfect - not only for some internetting but also for anything you d like.   Their craft beer selection  great coffee  lightning fast wifi and partnership with Veracruz tacos makes this a great spot to do a bit of work or go on a date  meet with friends or play some board games. It s beautiful  functional and the baristas are  get this   actually really nice.   The parking is kind of a pain but if you re not there during peak times  you should be fine. Note  They do turn off the wifi at 5pm so don t plan to camp out Bennu-style after that time.
Radio Coffee & Beer,240,This is tied for the best espresso I ve had in Austin since moving here a year and a half ago. Granted I don t get out a ton being a dad  husband  and holding down 2 part-time jobs  but I ve got to say when I order an espresso and close my eyes to simply enjoy it  it makes part of my coffee snobbery life complete    So  do yourself a favor and order a breve latte  admire the latte art  close your eyes and take a sip of liquid heaven. Smile  wipe the crema foam off your beard and repeat  You should not be disappointed.   Oh  when I come here in the evening I order an espresso drink  followed by a great dark breakfast porter  chased by another espresso drink.      Y all have a great day 
Radio Coffee & Beer,241,I wish this place was closer to our apartment   A laid back atmosphere coupled with an extensive craft beer selection  well made coffees  and a large  and for the most part covered  outdoor space makes this our new coffee spot of choice  Lots of large tables outside would make this a nice spot for a small group.  The crowd was constant as expected for a late Saturday morning but it never felt overcrowded and service was quick.  Every sip of the Nitro cold brew coffee on tap is worth the  4 price tag  and my wife had to conscientiously pace herself taking down her latte because it was so good.   We ll definitely be back for one of their comedy nights or to check out some live music.
Radio Coffee & Beer,242,We love going to Radio to get coffee with our goldendoodle and we also love grabbing breakfast tacos from the Veracruz Food Truck. My fianc  always gets a cold brew and I get a vanilla latte. We also love to go to some of their events like trivia night and live bluegrass music.
Radio Coffee & Beer,243,Great central location. Good food trucks immediately available. Great outdoor space. Decent parking. This has become my go-to date place. Try the thai tea  green 
Radio Coffee & Beer,244,Met family here to catch up while I was in town. The coffee was great and the large outdoor space made it nice to hang out with the kids. The taco truck outside was  and there were other great trucks as well 
Radio Coffee & Beer,245,I absolutely love this place.  The vibe is fantastic  whether you re there for breakfast  lunch  dinner or drinks. I was only in Austin for a day-and-a-half and I went here three times.  Breakfast - fantastic coffee in the cafe plus amazing breakfast tacos in the taco cart. Atmosphere is great and plenty of seating in the morning  where you can just relax with your tacos and your coffee.  This is also a great place to do some reading and chill.  In the evening  the parking lot does get packed  depending on the day that you go. Unfortunately  there isnt much street parking because it s mostly reserved for residents. So plan ahead.  Beer selection - pretty good. Tacos  guac  nachos from that taco cart - AMAZING. Service - chill. Space - lovely. Long hours.  Whether you want to go alone and people watch or study  or with a group of people to catch up  this is a great place to go. I highly recommend it  This will be my first stop when I go to back to Austin 
Radio Coffee & Beer,246,Best Caramel Latte in town     In the evenings  there s a younger guy who has a totally cool curly haired mo-hawk thing going on.  He is the one you want to make your latte.  I have no idea what he does to make it so creamy and flavorful  but when you only allow yourself one coffee a week you are very picky about the where  when  who of it all.    So let me tell you...IT IS WORTH IT     I tip him almost the full price of the latte itself and refuse to let anyone else make it except him.  Others have tried  he s the winner every time.  Only reason it s not 5 stars... - parking stinks  - no gluten free options for someone who is required to be G free  and  - the mosquitoes are awful since all of the rain.  Oh  if you need internet any other time other than from 8-5  M-F  it is not available.  I get why they do it  but that can be stinky when you really want to study after work yet you don t want to go home.  But who wants a wet blanket around    So  go try it out and do so on Monday when the regular band is there and people watch and pet some dogs.
Radio Coffee & Beer,247,Visiting Austin Texas for the day and stopped in quick to grab a cafe Mocha and it is the best Mocha I have had in the US  Highly recommend this coffee place 
Radio Coffee & Beer,248,I thought this place was just ok  especially for someone who wanted to do some studying work. I may have come during a busy hour but parking here was pretty terrible. I kept circling around for at least 15 minutes. When I got there  no sitting inside  just the outdoor sitting. I got the nitro coffee and sat on the outdoor bench for good 30-45 minutes until I found an empty table inside. The coffee was alright  a bit bitter. The verdict  I would recommend coming here for socializing but not for studying. The place itself isn t so bad  good atmosphere and all.
Radio Coffee & Beer,249,Still not great coffee and I hate their lazy curb cuts that grab my bike tires but the outside space and food trailers are awesome.  Nice wine options.  I hear the beer taps get a lot of kudos. It is much better for happy hour than as a coffee place.  Another update   still trying to like Radio but they make it so hard.  It is proof of  location location location  as the key to success. Every few months I swear to give up on the luke warm coffee and uninterested hipsters who serve it.  If only we could get a better place nearby.
Radio Coffee & Beer,250,for a non coffee drinker to review a place like radio coffee  you know that it has to be memorable. i went once while in austin for five days and i regret not having gone every single day. i loved it so much  i bought a t shirt and now drive around with a rcb sticker on my car.  i can t wait to go back.   what is it that i loved so much  i loved the vibe  inside and out. i loved the beverage and pastry options. i loved  loved  LOVED the taco truck options  cause for separate review of what are clearly the best midges tacos i might ve had anywhere     i didn t find any of the staff to be rude. it was busy  height of the morning coffee rush  when we got there  but they seemed to have a system and handle the crowd just fine. i went back in to buy a t shirt and the guy who helped me was patient with my asking him to see two sizes.  as with any review  there are the people who will rant and the people who will rave. i ll be heading back to radio coffee on the first day of my next trip to austin  as well as any other day i can fit in some time.  a great place to hang out while on vacation and i surmise an equally great spot to do work if you re a local--my god  the place looked like an ad for apple with the number of people on their laptops 
Radio Coffee & Beer,251,Dig this little spot  I live way the eff east but it was worth the drive. Huge patio. Many beers  and a decent cider selection. Two damn fine food trucks. If I lived close by I would go to write or read all the time.   The guy at the register was unnecessarily gruff and angry looking. But perhaps he was just having a bad day  I d go back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,252,Such a cool place to hang out with friends or for a meet-up. So welcoming and delivering the goods to match. Atmosphere  A      Coffee      I don t drink it. Tea  Perfect 
Radio Coffee & Beer,253,get the vegetarian tacos.  oh and also beer. always get beer. The tacos were the absolute bomb. They don t have a wide variety on the menu  but that s totally okay.   Update  breakfast is also really good. We had coffee and breakfast tacos. And we got a free Radio Coffee  amp  Beer sticker
Radio Coffee & Beer,254,I was excited to try Radio Coffee and had a decent experience here- until I went to the counter to order. The barista was one of the rudest and couldn t be bothered to utter one word to me. Her attitude is enough to get me to never return. It s unfortunate that their staff is so unpleasant  when the patio and general ambiance is so inviting.
Radio Coffee & Beer,255,My favorite patio in Austin. You ve got two amazing food trucks to fill your stomach. A grassy area  a covered area. Large picnic tables or round metal tables or folding chairs  you pick. String lights all around. It s a wonderful atmosphere.  I normally get the coffee  which is legit  or kombucha on tap when I m here. You can also get beer on tap as well. Good selection all around.  There s usually some sort of event going on inside. Live music or trivia or whatnot. It s fun  but it doesn t dominate the whole place  so you can always find yourself a spot on the grounds to do your own thing.  Parking can be a bitch  but you can park at the neighboring businesses after a certain time so I ve never found it too difficult.
Radio Coffee & Beer,256,Great place for quality coffee  The coffee menu is extensive and they have a lot of great baked goods. The barista was super sweet and gave me a heart in the foam of my latte because my husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary.
Radio Coffee & Beer,257,Pretty cool place to be. This is like  the spot  if you ask me. Comfortable outside seating and good beverages 
Radio Coffee & Beer,258,This was our first trip to this eclectic hipster coffee beer establishment. There is plenty of outside seating and lots of folks with their kids  plus ones and dogs. As we were driving back to DFW  we opted for coffee while the folks we met enjoyed samples of the many craft beers on tap. There is at least one food truck in the back of he property that is so good that it no longer had tires to relocate it.      We hung out in the balmy evening air for About 2 hours  drinking some of the best coffee I have ever had  visiting with our loved ones  and generally people watching. The people watching alone could be worth the trip. But the COFFEE- this guy spent an apprenticeship in Seattle and rally knows his beans. The drip coffee was sublime and my latte was heavenly. I tried a few sips of our people s pints and was impressed with the selection. Beer snob heaven.      This is a great hang out and socialization locale and I encourage anyone spending more than  a day in Austin to go check it out.
Radio Coffee & Beer,259,Came in early morning for coffee and a pastry. The iced mocha was delicious and the blueberry cream pillow was truly exceptional  Quick service  although there were almost no other customers because of how early it was . Very chill  huge yard.
Radio Coffee & Beer,260,This is a spot that I take all my friends family that visits Austin.  Such a neat vibe     Was a little bummed about their wifi restrictions but kudos to them for creating a place that matches their vision.  Now that I know they don t offer Wifi on the weekends  I think after 5 as well  I will go else where.   Overall good coffee beer  cool events  and one on my favorite spots in Austin.
Radio Coffee & Beer,261,Lola Savannah makes a better cappuccino   however   Radio is a different vibe  South ATX laid back.  Grab a beer and a taco and hang outside with your amigos and dog.
Radio Coffee & Beer,262,Great venue  live music in at night and amazing taco truck.  Downside- the music choice tends to be super random  amp  slides into metal  acid rock...way too often. Keep it cool.   This is the third time I had to morph off to cosmic for either a better work space or chill out space because the music got too intense.
Radio Coffee & Beer,263,Coffee  4.8 stars - stumptown are excellent beans for coffee lovers. I wish they had cinnamon  amp  sugar-free almond milk.  Beer  Looks like they have  12-15 taps. Local Austin  amp  Texas beer is where it s at here.  Food  they have some good options  pastries and pizza slices  plus excellent food trucks on the patio area.  Wifi  Free until 5pm.    I wish I knew that before I sat down with my latte.  Patio  Beautiful. A green garden with hanging lights  plenty of seating while drinking a beer or fresh local kombucha  what more do you need   wifi after 5pm  I know.. I ll live.  They have extra seats  amp  little tables available for the lawn  so grab your friends for an afternoon or evening of relaxing. Patio area is dog friendly for your leashed four-legged friends.   Parking  This place gets packed  so be ready to walk a little down the road on a nice night or weekend.
Radio Coffee & Beer,264,This is one of my favorite places to have coffee and listen to live music. But sadly i can only give it 3 stars bc without fail the piped in music is so loud i have to almost yell to have a conversation with someone inside. That shouldn t be the case in a coffee bar. They do have fabulous coffee though.
Radio Coffee & Beer,265,A great coffee  and wine and beer  bar.  Starbucks has nothing on this awesome original place.  Very crowded - always.  Great vibe and great drinks. Free wifi
Radio Coffee & Beer,266,THIS PLACE IS BOMB AF    For many sad years I lived in the dark  Starbucks  but in an effort to expand my horizons and escape the  Westlake Bubble  I have ventured out to try the many coffee shops Austin has to offer. Throughout my culinary journey this has by far been my favorite. I give it a 9 10 simply because I think there should always be room for improvement and I wouldn t want RC to see this  become cocky  and slack off. Not that they would ever do that  we re in a committed relationship and they ve always treated me well  Gov and Econ online class is absolute hell and makes me want to bash my head against the wall but working on it at Radio Coffee  amp  Beer makes it manageable. If all else fails  switch from coffee to beer to ease your pain. Keep up the good work
Radio Coffee & Beer,267,Great place to bring friends especially out of towners to show them a part of the Austin vibe without getting into downtown. There are plenty of picnic tables and a shaded area to enjoy the outdoors and food trucks if you want more than coffee and pastries. People come here during the week to work on their laptops and tend to stay for long periods of time so snatching a table inside can be tricky. Overall I give it 5 stars  I m happy to have a unique place like this close to home.
Radio Coffee & Beer,268,LOVED this spot in Austin  We stopped by for breakfast and coffee one morning - and it did not disappoint.  The coffee was DELICIOUS - really well brewed and fresh.  They have a number of food trucks out in the back - but be warned - the lines and wait can get long if you get here at peak breakfast   brunch hour.  The tacos were DELICIOUS though - and the granola and yogurt I got from the African food truck was honestly the best yogurt and granola I have ever had.  The tables outside are a great place to hang out and enjoy your morning - and there is a flea market on weekends    Have a lot of love for this place - I ll be back if we swing through Austin again.
Radio Coffee & Beer,269,Great beer selection Coffee drinks are fantastic Great music  especially Monday night bluegrass  Staff has always been very friendly Cool atmosphere inside and outside Two food trucks with great items
Radio Coffee & Beer,270,Incredible coffee. Amazing patio. Delicious tacos. What more could want   Blue grass with your craft beer under party patio lights on a cool texas night  Oh  they have that too  
Radio Coffee & Beer,271,I can t believe I haven t reviewed Radio yet. Every single time I go here I am just put into a mood that I can hardly describe. Everyone is always happy  the seating options are great  and they are one of the best coffee shops in Austin in terms of knowing how to make incredible espresso shots  and I have been to almost every coffee shop in Austin .  Right now they are serving Wild Gift s Adado on espresso  and if you ve never tried straight espresso before the place is here  amp  the time is now  because the fruity blueberry pomegranate flavor that it has is so noticable that anyone who is skeptical of espresso having these kinds of qualities would immediately start to understand how complex espresso can really be.
Radio Coffee & Beer,272,Great atmosphere   Veracruz food truck on point  Good draft beer selection   Local hot spot  Mostly outside  Definitely recommend
Radio Coffee & Beer,273,Walking in the parking lot at first it s a bit odd to distinguish where the coffee shop is. They have a cute little patio that is dimly lit and very relaxing. As you walk in there is a food truck with awesome food and then to your left the coffee shop. It s really nice in there it was about to close  but they had a lot of seating and lots of cool drinks including alcohol. It s open late so it s a nice place to go and have some drinks or coffee with friends or even a casual date night. My Carmel Latte was to die for and my other half s Dirty Chai was on point. They also had a Zucchini bread that caught my eye as we were about to pay and of course I had to try it. Well it was delicious  probably about the best piece of bread I ve had in my life  and trust me I ve tried a lot. If you are in Austin stop by it s really unique and quite relaxing 
Radio Coffee & Beer,274,This place is a great stop whenever I visit Austin. They would receive a 5 star rating  but despite how delicious the coffee is  their staff are rather unfriendly and not customer oriented. I usually get an iced mocha or a black coffee and they are both delicious. If you can ignore the staff  this place is pretty great when combined with the food trucks that sit at the building 
Radio Coffee & Beer,275,Had this little gem coffee shop bookmarked for months and months. I thought parking onsite would be very little and crammed and it was.   Nightmare parking unless you don t mind parking offsite and walking is a major deterrent  because the chai tea lattes I got were bad and expensive I would have to say just don t.   Starbucks shouldn t be better  but it is. I m so saddened to even say that. I wanted to like this place. It looks so hip which is probably why parking is a nightmare lots of the clientele were hipsters having beard measuring contests or asking what is the most vegan drink.
Radio Coffee & Beer,276,I like the vibe of this place  although it gets SUPER busy and it can be challenging finding parking.  Lots of seating  the food trucks are good  coffee is good  nice selection of beers on tap  and live music.  Great place to study  meet up with friends   amp  eat some food.    They turn the wifi off after 5pm  I think  to encourage a more social atmosphere.  I get the idea  but I ve definitely been frustrated after having the wifi shut off in the middle of my research....had to pack up and go to another spot.    I definitely enjoy this place and come here a lot.
Radio Coffee & Beer,277,Excellent coffee..great service  The layout and atmosphere at this place is fantastic 
Radio Coffee & Beer,278,I m a remote worker  like 80  of folks in ATX . This place throughout the day is fairly packed - so beware people  Parking can be tight and you ll more than likely need to share your table.   That being said  Radio Coffee has a solid coffee tea selection and most importantly  there s a Veracruz Al Natural right outside. You can get your order of Migas or Al Pastor  a dose of caffeine and get to workin 
Radio Coffee & Beer,279,Well  I can t give 2 stars to a place I choose to go back to often  can I  So 3 stars it is.  Let me start with the good    Good coffee  amp  Beer   Great for kids - not all places in this town are good for kids   I love the events. We ve gone here for a couple of bluegrass concerts now.  Now for the bad    While accommodating  they don t seem to care to do so with a smile  regardless of how I show up  with wife and kid  with a friend for a beer  with a laptop to work . This is somewhat of a systemic problem in Austin  and they are only enabling the issue.   This place is only a good place to work when they want you to work - which is not after 5pm. Wifi shuts down at that time.  tip for Radio  you can set up multiple routers  and cut internet off to 75  of the place rather than entirely - if you re goal is to focus attention on the live music and change the environment  I work non-traditional hours as many do in this city  but Radio seems to give zero f s about this.  I will continue going here mostly because it s a great place for my family  and since that seems to be how they want me to show up - to hang out chill and not to work.  My suggestion is to take a note out of Strange Brew s book  and make area s of your place that are accommodating to everyone.
Radio Coffee & Beer,280,If you re looking for a place to study just go somewhere else. They turn off the WiFi after 5 on weekdays and don t have it on at all on weekends. It makes sense when you think about the type of vibe they want to pull in on the afternoons but for a college student as myself  this sucks.
Radio Coffee & Beer,281,Wins  - Great selections of beer  wine  coffee  etc. - Two very tasty food trucks on site  Cazamance  amp  Veracruz All Natural  - Welcoming vibe - Good people watching - Dog friendly patio  Opportunities  - Parking can be challenging - If you arrive at peak time  it can be difficult to find a seat  BLUF  A great place to get a coffee or a beer while visiting with friends when you are in the Ben White Manchaca area.
Radio Coffee & Beer,282,Awful coffee. Rude owners. Will never come again. If you want to support gentrification and a staff that looks down their nose at you this is the best place to go.
Radio Coffee & Beer,283,I really like this place it is walking distance from my house.  i love that they did keep the frame from the greenhouse that was there before.  Staff was friendly   the seating area was great lots in or out  The selection of beers  seem to be enough for your average beer drinker.  We sat outside and saw kids running around on side fenced  in never bothered  us.  Prices are comparable  to any or for that matter all the coffee houses   There was a food truck there  I assumed it must be good according to line of   people I saw buying food.  Will I go back   Sure why not.
Radio Coffee & Beer,284,It would never occur to me to combine a genuine coffeehouse with a hip beer place - I m seeing a lot of these lately - but if it s working  cool. At 1 30 in the afternoon on opening day  half of us here were doing coffee  and the other half doing craft beers. I m pretty sure they were craft beers.   Think Buzz Mill plunked on Manchaca  with less flannel and Veracruz All Natural instead of Blue Ox. The parking lot is geometrically interesting  they re still tweaking the large outside patio area  and I think this is going to be one popular place. I am slightly discomfited when I see children having a grand old time inside a beer tap environment  but they re your kids  not mine. Whatevs.   Radio was doing a killer drip Stumptown from Portland at  2 a pop  with fifty-cent refills. I could camp on that stuff all day. The barista guy was getting a serious workout  and so was the guy pulling beer. They had slices from East Side Pies at the counter. Opening day buzz is always exciting  but I also think Radio needs just a little time to settle in  and literally let some grass grow around the place. And then we can all settle down as they become the next South Austin icon.
Radio Coffee & Beer,285,This place is trash. Bathroom disgusting  bartenders rude and sketchy. Skip this place for sure. If you re here for the tacos they re the best and super nice
Radio Coffee & Beer,286,Awesome service  awesome menu... Just awesome. This place is great for a drink and or coffee. Has indoor and great outdoor seating. Pet friendly.
Radio Coffee & Beer,287,This is a quintessential south austin coffee house. Anyone from Austin knows exactly what I mean. When you walk inside to order the aroma of their coffees instantly put you at ease.  Plenty of seating outside  but somewhat limited inside.  Staff was nice  amp  efficient. The traffic flow of getting our orders was a distorted  amp  seemed to add unneeded wait times.  Overall I d recommend this for coffee or beer
Radio Coffee & Beer,288,Excellent lattes  As in my wife and I had two large lattes a price this morning. The flavor of the beans is most excellent and the microform in the milk and the latte art make this spot a cut above most places. Could drink this coffee every morning. Would be a great way to start the day.
Radio Coffee & Beer,289,Radio Coffee and Beer pulled a lot of the baristas from Flipnotics so that s cool.  If you loved that place you will like this place.  They have a food truck with the delicious Veracruz All Natural which brings a nice touch but if you don t want a taco you can buy East Side Pies food from inside.  Lots of beers on tap and the biggest tap of all which is the Stumptown cold brew nitro.  That is probably the biggest thing that sets them apart from other coffee and beer combos floating around Austin.  You can also buy Stumptown beans here  hello lovely Hair Bender   If you are looking for space they have tons.  A big patio area with fans  picnic benches and room to run around.  This place is kid friendly and dog friendly so get ready.  Parking isn t downtown level of annoying as they do have a small parking lot but it fills up quickly and street parking is limited.  One TV set that is on mute that is crammed in the back corner by a couch so don t come here to watch sports.  This is definitely a hang out place.  And people are hanging out  on laptops  getting work done  eating tacos  chasing toddlers and dogs  having conversations  ect.  This would be a good meet up spot for a job interview for something since it has so much room.  Less so of a date spot.  But definitely a neighborhood bar and coffee house.  Thanks for joining the scene Radio Coffee and Beer.  Note   Front door says they close  late  which usually means midnight
Radio Coffee & Beer,290,Let s lay out the facts   -24 beer taps including the Austin Beerworks Karl and the 512 Tripel   -a Stumptown cold brew nitro coffee on tap served up in a 10 oz glass with a frothy head like Guinness  -Veracruz All Natural truck serving up tacos  -Stumptown beans with some of your favorite baristas from Flipnotics and even my personal favorite barista from Medici  -ample indoor  amp  outdoor seating  with a cozy cabiny feel  Clearly  this is your new favorite place to hang out before work  after work  and instead of work.   Thanks for existing  Radio  We welcome you with open arms and empty cups.
Radio Coffee & Beer,291,Austin staple of S Austin and great atmosphere. Always see someone I know  Live music at times but not so loud you cannot meet or talk 
Radio Coffee & Beer,292,Cool place for coffee or beer. Would rate higher but they turn off the wifi at 5.. may as well turn off the lights too if they want customers to leave so bad. Ohh and I m pretty sure they do not have AC.  Hopefully management changes some things  would make for a great establishment if they fixed the above.
Radio Coffee & Beer,293,Veracruz tacos. Coffee is great  Free wifi is available. Can get packed often  but outdoor seating is available....
Radio Coffee & Beer,294,Lots of outdoor seating with a couple food trucks on the lot. One is called Cazamance and is African cuisine  another is Veracruz Mexican. Indoor seating available too. They play music both outdoor and indoor at a medium level  not too loud. Great place for meeting friends and they have a wide variety of coffee and beer.
Radio Coffee & Beer,295,Love this quaint little coffee shop   I come here often.  Definitely  an Austin local stop for getting with friends during the day or having a mug of local beer after work.
Radio Coffee & Beer,296,RadioCoffee  amp  Beer  has the best atmosphere to get work done and enjoy good conversation over a nice latte    Ps. The veggie tacos at the food truck next door are simply To Live For 
Radio Coffee & Beer,297,After a single visit  this has become my favorite place to drink on Manchaca that isn t Moontower Saloon  please ignore for a moment the fact that  until Strange Brew finishes remaking the remains of the Bakehouse  currently this is about the only place to drink on Manchaca that isn t Moontower Saloon .  I grew up a few blocks south of where Radio is now on the other side of Ben White  and it s been awesome to see this stretch of road gradually acquire more and more cool new businesses. Radio does both coffee and beer  which are two things I appreciate greatly in life.  As far as coffee is concerned  the prime draw is the Stumptown cold brew nitro. Apparently it s from Portland or something  it s delicious  and is easily a match for Cuv e or any other local cold brew.  2 gets you 10 oz of some of the creamiest cold brew coffee you ve ever had.  Their beer selection is also legit  two dozen taps  ranging from local staples like Fireman s  4 to more eclectic choices like Brother Thelonious or 512 Tripel. Sadly they won t let you get a pitcher of the Tripel or some of the other high-ABV drafts  but 5 straight pints of 8   beer is just asking for trouble  console yourself instead with an  11 pitcher of Magic Hat  9.  But good coffee and great beer need a congenial atmosphere  and Radio delivers here as well. There s a nice modern interior with ample seating via tables and couches  and outside the beer garden has a nice mix of smaller round tables and larger benches for bigger parties.   A hidden upside of the Austin food truck boom is rather than each coffee shop or bar having to make their own mediocre food  they can just outsource it to the pros  this beer-food synergy is a big draw for places on E 6th or Rainey . Radio brought in Veracruz All-Natural for their food  which is awesome. When I was there I had a quick chat with the wife of one of the owners who said they were thinking of bringing in others as well  which is even better.  It s a great addition to this stretch of Manchaca and I m looking forward to checking it out many more times.
Radio Coffee & Beer,298,I thought I d love this place. The line to order was long  indoor seating was limited  and the real line in the sand...no WiFi. We specifically came here to knock out some wedding planning with a change of scenery from our house. Bought two mediocre coffees  tried to settle in  and had to leave since they didn t have internet access. Staff was a bit unpleasant as well.
Radio Coffee & Beer,299,Love the lattes here  So much so that we usually order two 16 oz. cups to get us going. The beans are of high quality and taste great along with the microfoam which is perfect. Nice latte art too  Would have a cup here every day but alas  we were just visiting. We did go everyday during our visit though 
Radio Coffee & Beer,300,This is a staple stop for me whenever I have friends and family visiting me from out of town. The coffee and beer is on point and the food truck is really great as well. Lots of outdoor seating so it s very conducive for catching up with folks I haven t seen in awhile.
Radio Coffee & Beer,301,I love radio  great coffee  great beer  and Veracruz tacos won t disappoint. However  don t come here in a hurry. It s almost always packed in the morning  especially on the weekend. Hard to park  lines  and waits on tacos. It s a great spot if you have time. In the evening you can catch some great live music and it s usually not as packed.
Radio Coffee & Beer,302,Love this spot.  Plenty of outdoor seating with a coffee bar and semi-permanent food trucks next to the courtyard.  Coffee was great  gingerbread muffin was killer and the crowd was new-wave hipster people watching a go-go.  And their logo is awesome.  Wish we had this spot in LA 
Radio Coffee & Beer,303,Anyone who brews Stumptown is fine in my book. Radio even seems like the kind of hipster coffee joint you would find in Portland  minus the awesome tacos. No one does tacos like Veracruz.   It s a great setting as you can choose between sitting inside at the polished  wooden bar  lounging on lawn chairs outside with your dog  or sitting with a group at the benches near the food truck. You will see lots of Macbook Pros  beards  and plaid at this casual hangout. Service is friendly and pretty quick despite their using post-it notes for order taking.  The worst  and best  part of Radio is that you have to decide between breakfast tacos or Eastside Pies. But technically  you could just eat both. It s an easy place to stay awhile and make the seamless transition from coffee to beer or beer to coffee. Your choice. They ve even got cold brew and kombucha on tap. Yep- South Austin just got more awesome.
Radio Coffee & Beer,304,This should be a 5 star review but I d hate to be wrong and be labeled a premature evaluator.  Friendly and attentive staff. Beautiful interior. Excellent atmosphere. Lots of outdoor seating. Really good coffee. Good pastries.  This place has amazing potential.  Oh yeah. Dog friendly too.
Radio Coffee & Beer,305,My go-to neighborhood coffee shop to have meetings or get work done. The coffee is excellent and the staff is friendly  efficient and chill. Indoor seating is limited  mostly because the place is so popular  but the outdoor seating is plentiful.
Radio Coffee & Beer,306,Radio wine coffee is a great place- they have an awesome beer tap selection as well as wine and coffee. They have ample outdoor seating as well as indoor. On Wednesday nights they have trivia which is a lot of fun.   There is also an awesome taco food truck on the property  The staff are pretty chill too 
Radio Coffee & Beer,307,Great service  great coffee  and a great place to hang out in the morning  100  recommend  
Radio Coffee & Beer,308,Radio is a solid spot for a cup of coffee when you want to hang out in the afternoon breeze.  The coffee shop boasts great coffee  craft beer  and kombucha on tap. I like to post up with a drink and soak up the sun--the large open area seating outside is perfect. They have two food trucks  tacos and African cuisine  to satisfy any food cravings  though the wait can be lengthy. They recently added more parking in the back to alleviate the past parking issues. Prices are reasonable for coffee and while there can be a line  it usually moves pretty quickly. Sometimes Radio feels a little too cool for school  and not super welcoming  but the staff are helpful enough.  My only real complaint is they turn the Wi-Fi off in the evening. I understand they re trying to change the atmosphere at night into more of a bar with music  but it just relocates me to another coffee shop. Overall  either during the week or the weekend  when I m looking for a great outdoor patio  Radio is high on my list.
Radio Coffee & Beer,309,Love this place  It s in my hood and always offers a great space to relax and hang with small or large groups.
Radio Coffee & Beer,310,This place is great.   We go almost every Monday for Bluegrass night. There s lots of outdoor seating at tables  or bring a blanket like we do and watch the music picnic style. Radio has a great selection of beer  and let s not forget that Veracruz tacos are legit if you get hungry. Being so dog friendly is also a big plus. We are lucky enough to live within walking distance and bring our pup here weekly.   Be warned  like others have said  that their WIFI shuts off at 5pm and on weekends. It s only annoying if you don t know about it. Otherwise  there are plenty of other coffee shops to get work done after hours. As a small business  Radio can set whatever rules they want  and I respect that.   There is extra parking behind Radio  off Manchaca. We can usually always score a spot in the back if the front is full  which it usually is .   We haven t been to any of their other weekly events  they also host Trivia night and movie night   but it s definitely on our list.
Radio Coffee & Beer,311,I ve lost my edge.  I ve become a hermit  and even more bitter. bet you didn t think that was even possible.   when I first began going to Radio  me and my fellow chef boys would get day drunk after a long shift. we would laugh and be rowdy and they would harass pretty girls. it was a special time.   now  I sit alone  with a beer  and judge everyone. silently  now. the beautiful young woman  sitting on the grass  doing yoga. wtf. yoga  do that shit at home.   maybe that ol  neckbeard in the corner. what s he browsing on his macbook  porn  I hope.   or that new mama  with her tiny baby in a classic moby wrap sling. she got her figure back the day after giving birth to her new baby. fuck you.   oh  look at that smiley toddler  walking around  learning about the world  and grass  and butterflies and dumb shit. annoying.   radio is full of beautiful and interesting people. great coffee  delicious beer  amazing food trucks  and then there s me  all drunk and angry in the corner.
Radio Coffee & Beer,312,I ve been coming to Radio for their spicy chai and the taco truck for years now and the wait staff in the coffee bar gets more rude every time I m a patron. Idk what the deal is but it s ridiculous. Lose the attitude and perhaps people would tip you more or tip you at all. I work in the service industry  like the majority of Austin  and there s no reason to be so disrespectful to your customers for NO reason. If they didn t have Veracruz they would ve went under long ago.
Radio Coffee & Beer,313,I  ve been going to Radio for at least 3 years. Always top notch. Sometimes crowded  but worth it  Staff is always cool. Trivia and music is also great.
Radio Coffee & Beer,314,I wish my stars could go higher than a 5  becuase this place is a solid 10. Radio opened shortly after my husband and I moved to ATX and it soon became our  spot.  The people of Radio have become our great friends and always have treated us like family. Tane is nothing but a ray of sunshine  we ALWAYS look for her beautiful face  The fun is always unlimited when we re here. Great beer  trivia  movies  bands  and more.  ALSO   The tacos at Veracruz are a bonus  hands down the best you will ever eat. I almost want to keep this place a secret.    
Radio Coffee & Beer,315,Good coffee  check Good beer selection  check Live music  check Good atmosphere  check The best taco truck in town  double check If you ve never been to Radio  you re missing out. Go now 
Radio Coffee & Beer,316,The coffee is great  and if you re feeling something a little stronger  they have a great assortment of beers on tap as well.   Parking can be a little bit of a challenge if its your first time and its busy  but keep an eye out for signs because they do have extra lots.   Inside  they have a few pastries  but the shining star when it comes to food are the trucks out back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,317,Fun atmosphere  solid selection  pretty good coffee.  They recently expanded their parking and outdoor area which was a GOOD CALL.
Radio Coffee & Beer,318,Since I only come to Austin to see my son and DIL I don t really keep up with the best places to grab a beer. But they do. So  when it came time for father and son to catch up on things  he suggested Radio and I m glad he did. It s in an older house and not too large on the inside  as best I could tell. But there are picnic tables  a fire pit and performance stage outside. Also outside is a taco truck which  my son says  has the best tacos in town. That s good because the menu inside is pretty much Starbucksesque --  coffee appropriate carbs. Didn t try the coffee offerings but did have a pint of 512 Pecan Porter charged with nitrogen. -- think Guiness. What an unexpected treat. As one other reviewer noted  parking. Can be a PITA when the place is busy. But we were there on a late Saturday afternoon. So  no problem. Casual  comfortable and friendly service. For me  the holy trinity.
Radio Coffee & Beer,319,I went on a Monday night to listen to bluegrass.  Band was great  ambiance was great.  Only complaint is that they and the food trucks didn t seem well prepared for the crowd.  50 minutes for a taco   I don t think so.  And items would be forgotten and server would forget to come back. I m sure I d enjoy it more with less people.
Radio Coffee & Beer,320,YO BEST PLACE 3V3R   Great beer selection and chill environment. They occasionally have live music so check the calendar. This is a great place to hang out alone  one a date  or with a group of friends    VERA CRUZ TACOS...yall...  Guac is yummy  Chips are gluten free and are still bomb. I ordered a chicken and steak taco  steak wins. Very yum. I will be coming back probably once a week.  Add lime and the green sauce.   You re welcome    p.s. I ate it too fast to take a pic.
Radio Coffee & Beer,321,I love this local coffee house because of its coffee  beer selection  and the nightlife. I ve come here many times since its thankfully in the neighborhood and I have never had a bad time or poor service.  It s a great spot for after work happy hours  a coworker of mine had his birthday here  and it s also a really good option if you need a casual date idea. If the music is too loud in the evening step out and enjoy the picnic table seating on the patio. If Texas Summer pop-up rainshowers hit  just duck under the awning.   It s both family friendly during the day  as well as kid-free after around 9pm. I think they allow dogs outside. And if I recall they may serve food  but don t take my word for it  go check them out for yourself 
Radio Coffee & Beer,322,One of the best spots in far South Austin by far. Super kid and dog friendly  great staff  very chill atmosphere. Good live music oftentimes. Love my Radio
Radio Coffee & Beer,323,A favorite and regular hang when we re craving a good coffee and live music. Very Austin-y place when guests are in town too 
Radio Coffee & Beer,324,Added parking  thank God  and the coffee and baked goods are always good. I don t extend that to the pizza reheating they did in their early days  as I was food poisoned from that once  but I m not sure they do that anymore. They may have had that not work out for other people as well.  It s about 50 50 on finding somewhere to sit  you may end up getting your coffee to go.
Radio Coffee & Beer,325,Great place to hang out on a nice day.. have a coffee or a drink and relax with your bf or gf and it s dog friendly  My local go-to place 
Radio Coffee & Beer,326,I checked this place out the first week they were open. The cold nitro coffee is an absolute must. I love cole coffee but I never drink it straight black. However the flavor of this coffee was so good and rich it would be a crime to dilute it with anything.  This place has an all around cool South Austin vibe  so authentic to the neighborhood and something we ve needed down here for a long time. There are some kinks to work out but I trust these guys are going to listen to their customers and adapt.  All in all  a fantastic place to day-drink  didn t even mind the kiddos running around because this place has created space for kids so they are entertained and not underfoot.
Radio Coffee & Beer,327,Love Radio a local place to have a beer meet and greet make a new friend or connect with an old one.The house made kombucha is some of the best I ve had.Love the outdoor seating on a cool night  they also have local musicians performing.
Radio Coffee & Beer,328,Great place to hang out  get a coffee  chat with the bartender or whatever but if you re planning to work from Radio don t come after 5  or on weekends either.   They recently began turning off wifi after 5pm and don t turn it on at all on weekends.   Being self-employed I work A LOT and sometimes it s nice to hop down the road to get out of the office and work from a different environment  but I can t anymore since Radio decided to cut their wifi  I have been a loyal customer for well over two years now but it seems I won t be returning.  Bleh  what a mistake  Radio 
Radio Coffee & Beer,329,Awesome coffee shop with a huge  lovely courtyard. I had a delicious spicy chai and enjoyed sipping it leisurely outside.
Radio Coffee & Beer,330,Radio is such a great south ATX nook with a chill ambiance and good tunes  The food truck options are spectacular and their kombucha on tap is a must  Great for afternoon tea pots and lattes under the trees solo or with friends. All good things here- treat yourself to this radness and... Enjoy   -  ps- heads up no wifi on Monday during bluegrass night- so you can leave the computers at da-Casa  - 
Radio Coffee & Beer,331,Excellent coffee and tasty GF baked good.   My husband loved the regular baked goodies.
Radio Coffee & Beer,332,I really liked this coffee shop--they made a great latte and had whole milk and almond milk to choose from. The coffee was smooth and really tasty. My two friends and I stopped here to grab coffees then sit outside at picnic tables and have breakfast tacos from the excellent Veracruz. There was a covered area and an open area  for sun lovers and sun haters  equal opportunity   and another non-taco truck  that I didn t try . It was chill  I noticed the beer on tap for something other than breakfast  and it was a fun space to sit outside and start the day.
Radio Coffee & Beer,333,The environment is the centerpiece. Little coffee shop vibes with pretty good coffee. Not quite a traditional bar but certainly an establishment serving fine craft beer and finer craft cocktails. Vera Cruz taco truck is worth going to just for itself. Excellent excellent music  both live and recorded  always fill up the background. The aesthetic holding everything together makes this a sweet South Austin hang.
Radio Coffee & Beer,334,Love the beer selection. In particular  love that they carry Blue Owl sour mashes. So good  The kombucha is fantastic.  Great vibe. Dog friendly  and there s plenty of ground space where you can throw down a blanket for music nights. Really like this scene. Very Austin-esque.
Radio Coffee & Beer,335,If you re reading this as  8 00a on a Saturday - I m probably sitting under the giant tree with my one year old and Golden Retriever chowing down on my FAVORITE breakfast taco in the world  Migas Poblano from Veracruz  while sipping on draft kombucha.  heavenisRadioonaSaturdaymorning
Radio Coffee & Beer,336,Coffee and beer are two things that make any work week better. It s hard to review this place without taking into consideration the amazing food truck on their property    I was impressed with the amount of beers on tap including my favorite blue owl  They even had many different varieties from the various craft breweries.   Inside is small and dark but there are so many picnic tables for seating outside  Its an easy place to meet up to chat with friends.   I ll have to go back soon to check out their movie nights. They had school of rock playing when I left 
Radio Coffee & Beer,337,Guys  if you re in Austin and you need to work  but you re hangover and you want a beer or a Bloody Mary  and a decent internet connection and nice staff and good local people around you.. look no further.. this is The Place   I m used to start my days at 6am or something and it was a relief to find people working at that time in the morning with such a good attitude. So  in every aspect  awesome   
Radio Coffee & Beer,338,If you re expecting to use WiFi after 5 00 PM on weekdays or anytime during the weekend  you are in for a rude awakening.  Radio has a policy of turning off their WiFi after a certain time to force their patrons to interact with each other instead of their devices.  However  this defeats the purpose of going to a coffee shop for many people  including myself.  I m a student living in south-central Austin with somewhat limited coffee shop options in the area.  Hopefully their policy will be reconsidered.
Radio Coffee & Beer,339,Yeah  I like it. Came here to meet some friends and actually enjoyed it. Love the food trailers here and the place is nicely done. Parking is a bitch and a half  but you know  growth in Austin   Come and hang out at the picnic tables  there s lots of them. Bring a dog  but on leash please. Have a beer you think is Shiner  but is really a delicious 90 shillings creation. Enjoy the company and chill atmosphere. Done and done. Like it. We ll be back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,340,The coffee is good.  The service staff seemed a bit overwhelmed when we went on a Sunday to get some work done... WITH NO WiFi ON WEEKENDS... WHAT   I live close to Bennu and Cherrywood here on the Eastside where it s always available  so I ll stick to my home turf and skip the drive next time.  If your South  though  and don t have work to do  it s a nice spot  crappy parking  but pretty cool environment.
Radio Coffee & Beer,341,I was fixin to write a complainey review about how I m consistently frustrated by the parking here.  This fact remains true  but I ve shifted course.   Instead I m going to write a review about the friendly staff. I just had a particularly lovely interaction with a sweetheart barista who kindly asked me how my morning has been. When I told her honestly it was pretty crappy  she told me a cute story and cheered me up. She also wished me a better day in a way that felt sincere  and it totally changed my outlook.  I got an awesome coffee and a pep talk for about  5. Thank you  red head barista with the bangs  You exemplify what I think are important qualities in this line of work.   Beyond great coffee and kind people  Radio has a very welcoming atmosphere inside and out. There are both communal tables and smaller ones for individuals or pairs. They have several delicious food trucks stationed outside  an herb an veggie garden and a fire pit. The place almost feels a bit like a ski lodge  save for being at the intersection of two highly trafficked roads. But from the interior of the courtyard or sitting in one of the comfy leather couches inside  it hardly feels like a roadside stop. It s quiet and calming.   Radio also has some great programming in the evening. Several of my local musician friends have played here and they have a calendar of movies and other fun stuff. My kind of place 
Radio Coffee & Beer,342,Nothing exciting.  Just a typical coffee bar. The lack of parking is a huge turnoff. The food trucks are alright  but again nothing screams amazing.  Yeah they might have beer but I will enjoy one at home.
Radio Coffee & Beer,343,We will definitely be returning. I got a cider  honey got a latte  amp  the kid got hot chocolate. We loved the vibe  We would love to come back with our dog. Great concept  Super nice staff 
Radio Coffee & Beer,344,What a fun place to spend the afternoon  We enjoyed beer  music and the occasional passing dog to love on. Food trucks on property kinda made my mouth water but we couldn t sample the goods as we were whiling away the afternoon waiting on an early dinner engagement elsewhere.
Radio Coffee & Beer,345,So I ve just returned to Austin after 6 months abroad  and I m cranky I have to drive everywhere after living in walkable cities and even crankier there s no coffee shop within walking distance of where I live. I tried going to Bouldin Creek but there was nowhere to park and remembered a friend had told me Radio was a cool joint  and it was close and even closer to home  so I drove on down.  Found parking even though it was clearly insanely busy at 2pm on a Sunday. Couldn t find a table inside  so I decided to sit outside at a picnic table under the cozy warm heaters protected by the wind by plastic walls  but then I realize I need to go inside to the counter to order and notice a table had opened up. Score.  I sit down  only I m in front of the window that has no blinds and I can t see my laptop monitor and there s nowhere to charge my laptop. I move to the only other place to sit which is a chair that has an electrical outlet behind it. Fantastic. I plug in and go to the counter to order my Americano and sit back down. I couldn t locate wifi  so I go wait in line to ask about it.  I m told there s no wifi on weekends  but normally there s no password and I d be able to easily connect.  There s no wifi on weekends. Unbelievable. I asked for a to go cup and took myself to the Austin Public Library.
Radio Coffee & Beer,346,This is an Oasis in the city - as good as any beer garden and better than most  Austin Style 
Radio Coffee & Beer,347,Great coffee  great atmosphere  great service. I got an Americano and my sister got the cafe latte. Both recommend. Dog friendly too.
Radio Coffee & Beer,348,Great coffee-beer place in Austin. Convenient for me other than parking. Great staff and nice indoor and outdoor area for hanging out. Some good food options make it a relaxing place to come with some good options.
Radio Coffee & Beer,349,I never write 3 star reviews but this is just one of those things...   Radio would get my 5 stars if  1   they decided on one policy about Wi-Fi.   I get it  it s your place do what you like.  But this is my review so really figure it out either provide Wi-Fi or do not provide it.   But please don t have arbitrary rules about when it is available.  2  get off you high horse about  1.   No I don t know all your policies.  I don t know that you have Wi-Fi access only before 5.  If I ask you about it be polite.   Please.
Radio Coffee & Beer,350,Cute atmosphere  gave us the lodge feel. I didn t quite enjoy the cold brew nitro coffee they made  but that s not what perked me to write a review. Everyone has different taste.   The people that worked there weren t friendly. They were out of napkins  so I asked for more. They acted as if they were annoyed that they had to put out more napkins. I didn t think of anything since they were really busy. But when my girlfriend asked if they do bluegrass on Mondays in August  there was July calendar in the bathroom and every Monday  there s bluegrass playing   their response was sarcastically  well  yeah I guess so  we ve only had it every day since we opened .  She said  well  we re from out of town so we wouldn t know that . Do you know what time it starts   He said  still sounding annoyed  I don t know  8      Welp  we won t be going there on Monday. No way would I like to support a business that are rude to people.
Radio Coffee & Beer,351,We got some coffee at Radio and tacos from their food truck. Sitting outside was prefect. One word  awesome.
Radio Coffee & Beer,352,Found this coffee shop on a whim last week  and fell in love with it. We came at night and it had such a nice Austin ambience to it  with lights strung around its patio and a great throwback soundtrack. There s plenty of seating outside  but it s more limited inside.  They also had a live band playing inside  which was neat. We didn t get to hear them since we were enjoying the night air outside  but they have little events or activities every night.   I got their hot chocolate and it was delicious. Wouldn t say it s the best since trying this amazing place in Chicago  but it was a good cup and warmed the night.
Radio Coffee & Beer,353,The idea of this place is great  but everything else falls short. Their lattes taste burnt  and their chai had no flavor. The parking is awful  you feel like you re in downtown Austin SoCo. I also never enjoy their customer service  wait  I don t even think you could call it that. All in all  it s over rated and I ve stopped making my friend take me there. I d rather go to Jo s off south congress  and experience better service and coffee is I m gonna fight for a parking spot.
Radio Coffee & Beer,354,Warning  this is a policy rant.   There s a Starbucks very close to my house that I go to every Sat morning to get some work done  but I thought my money would be better spent on overpriced coffee at a local establishment.   So  this Saturday I went to Radio Coffee  amp  Beer for what I thought might be the first of many times. After getting my cappuccino and pastry  I asked the barista how to access the wifi and was shocked to find out that they turn it off on the weekends. When I expressed some confusion and dissatisfaction I got one of those not-my-problem f-off sort of looks and a  sorry man.  Why take the time to explain the policy and make it seem reasonable when you can adopt an air of bored disdain     So  now I m out  8 and headed back to the soulless but wifi-providing competition. We could have had something special  Radio Coffee.
Radio Coffee & Beer,355,Loved the atmosphere here  I stopped here for breakfast and coffee  two days in a row because i liked it so much  while in the area for the weekend. The vibe is really young and fresh but  welcoming to young families with it s outdoor seating and space to hang around. The food trucks outside are convenient and give it the authentic Austin feel.   I tried the nitro  basically a cold brew coffee that tastes like guinness s coffee sister  the first day and a latte the second day. I enjoyed both a lot - I was really hoping for a traditional iced coffee the first day but was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the nitro.   My one caveat about the place is definitely that the line can become massively long. Waves of people come in on the weekends so be sure to leave yourself some time 
Radio Coffee & Beer,356,I love Radio  but I was disappointed to learn that they turn off their wifi on the weekends...I like to choose locally-owned establishments like Radio over commercial places like Starbucks  but I really only go to caf s to get work done in my computer  I work remotely . I don t think I ll be coming here on the weekends anymore.
Radio Coffee & Beer,357,Very cool little spot. Great options for beer and coffee. It s a solid place to relax alone or with a group of friends. Outdoor seating is great  If I didn t live so far up north I would definitely hang out here more often.
Radio Coffee & Beer,358,I only come here for Veracruz tacos  which are amazing  because the parking here is absolutely trash.
Radio Coffee & Beer,359,Great coffee. The patio is big  and there are plenty of food trucks to choose from. Parking is limited. I ve tried to come back here and left because I couldn t find parking at least a couple of times. I wish there were more coffee bars like this within walking distance from my home 
Radio Coffee & Beer,360,Rated one of the best in Austin  More tattoos  more piercings  more Hipsters  more old farts  more toddlers dancing  and more great Bluegrass than you ll find anywhere. Damn I like be this place 
Radio Coffee & Beer,361,Great cold brew  Good staff. Nice atmosphere during the day or night. Kid friendly as well.
Radio Coffee & Beer,362,I ve only been in Austin for a few weeks  but I ve already visited this place several times for a beer or coffee. Their beer on tap is a good selection  the staff is knowledgeable and personable  and they have great hours and seating. Parking can be a bit tricky  but that s not a knock against them. It s worth finding a spot to see this place.
Radio Coffee & Beer,363,This place is great  Beer or coffee  indoor or out. Such a relaxed setting and a lot of space outdoor. They have food trucks set up now for food options 
Radio Coffee & Beer,364,Despite my usual disdain for Stumptown Coffee...Radio s Coffee is fine. Not awesome  but fine. I m a little put off by the dirty hippie vibe  which wouldn t be an issue of it we re just the clientele  but it is the staff as well. And also if it were just an appearance thing it d be ok...but it s a smell issue. It distracts from the coffee.   I also feel like their queueing process for orders is inefficient. Ex. I was the first person in line...no drink orders ahead of me. I ordered two espresso beverages and a bottled drink.  I went to the restroom...took my time...and still waited 7 minutes for my drinks as I watched 4 orders that came in after I paid  get prepared.  Barista was super chatty with others  not so much with me. I felt like she forgot to check their printer or something...except all those drinks after mine. It s disappointing...I m in the industry so I try not to be harsh. This is a popular place and I feel like they are resting on their laurels instead of striving for better customer service.
Radio Coffee & Beer,365,This used to be my favorite place. I have been a loyal customers for 3 years and I come hangout on a weekly basis.   However I ve noticed that the atmosphere behind the bar has become frigid in the past 8 months  particularly due to the baristas  unfriendly attitudes during evening shifts   1 tall red head man   2 blond haired man w ponytail and  3 short dark haired woman  who have little inter-personal skills  poor decision making  not much self-control and have been extremely rude and out of line on a several occasions  not only to me  but also to my friends.  As a loyal customer it saddens me to write a negative review  but when the owner of Radio is away  these individuals abuse power  discriminate and most importantly  they make derogatory and insulting remarks to their customers.   I love Radio s beer selection  coffee  patio  music events and their engagement with the community  but some of the baristas they hire behind the bar leaves a lot to be desired since they do not embody the values of this establishment.  PS  regarding the ID comment below    1 I was with 3 friends who are 4 to 7 years younger than me and who were NOT carded. For 2 of them  it was their first time at Radio...this is WHY you should probably review these gentlemen s ethics. I urge you to do so.   2 Meanwhile  i get carded by the same gentlemen  and the same unwelcoming attitude  every week  sometimes twice when I go and grab a beer.   3 I did not even seek any argument with the bartender and only told him that he cards me every week and that I am a long time customer. When he told me to go get my ID  I responded  alright I got it  I understand  turned around and walked out ... there is no point for me to argue  I understand and abide by the rules.   ...30 min later He came all the way to our table outside while I was sitting with my friends eating my tacos. He made a scene in front of ALL the other customers  YELLING at me because there was beers in front of me and he saw me drinking  yea my friends were drinking  He told me I was a  jerk  and I m  nasty  and that he was going to call the cops if I didn t leave.   The funniest part is that my ID was in my car all this time and I showed it to him and the other bartenders.    3 BUT the story does NOT stop there...when I left  feeling hurt  abased  disrespected and mocked by your crowd of bartenders after I showed my ID and asked for these gentlemen s names  Jack -redhead- and Matt -blond ponytail- as I was told ...  THE STORY WENT ON  .... They tracked down my 2 friends after they came out of the bathroom. They harassed one of them being forceful  THEY cornered her  asked her to hand over her phone and accused her of recording or taking pictures of the scene  maybe too scared she videotaped and had evidence  I doubt YOUR bartenders reported this part    Sooo no  these gentlemen are not worth another minute of my time and are far from being deserving of working at Radio. I ve known the place for 3 years and I m even friends with one cool and kind of your past bartender   Looking at the reviews below and seeing how many complaints and negative reviews you ve had about them in the past few months  I still don t understand why they are still bartending.   The bartenders  servers and workers  at  Crepe crazy  are all deaf and mute and manage to express way more respect  kindness and are far more welcoming than what I have seen unfolding on a weekly basis at Radio.
Radio Coffee & Beer,366,Not sure why anyone on here has not mentioned the fact that Radio doesn t have any WiFi after 5pm  That seems unheard of for a coffee shop. There should at least be an option to pay for WiFi. I came here to do some work and was disappointed that I wasn t able to do so.
Radio Coffee & Beer,367,This is a great place to hang out at night.  They had live music  good selection of beers and coffee and a great vibe.  There is a food truck in the parking lot connected to the outdoor patios.  Dogs are allowed on the outdoor patio.
Radio Coffee & Beer,368,LOVE RADIO  why you ask  awesome coffee  hubs loves the cold brew  Veracruz tacos  dog friendly  covered patio  AND awesome chocolate croissants. Deliciousness all around and super laid back. One time veracruz told us it d be a 45 min wait for the tacos we ordered. But they are worth it.
Radio Coffee & Beer,369,Got a mocha that was good. A decent chocolate croissant. Unfortunately their WiFi is public and has no password so I can t work there for security reasons.   Would like to go back at night.
Radio Coffee & Beer,370,The beer menu is extensive  but all of the beers are listed as pints. Certain beers are short pours. Even though the menu doesn t say that.
Radio Coffee & Beer,371,This is my go to spot for business meetings. Great atmosphere  great coffee  and dog friendly. Baked goods are good too.
Radio Coffee & Beer,372,Coffee shop  bar  music venue  this place is worth checking out. They serve Stumptown coffee  so that should make any coffee hipster happy. The place is pretty large and has a great patio section. They cover it to keep the elements out so you should be fine most any time of the year.   The VeraCruz taco trailer is right outside too so you can hangout for a few hours and get work done. The staff is super friendly as are the patrons. I find it easy to just start up a conversation with people here.  Once nighttime hits  the WiFi turns off and it becomes a bar with live music. Their beer selection is pretty legit I must say. A lot of craft and local breweries are represented here. Would be great for a laid back date night.   The only major downside is the parking. Place is popular  the lot is small  and that area is challenging for street parking. Otherwise  pretty awesome place 
Radio Coffee & Beer,373,I live nearby so frequent this establishment often. A bit pricey for wine although Veracruz onsite helps significantly.
Radio Coffee & Beer,374,Fantastic place to hang out and grab a coffee or beer with friends  do some work  or just enjoy beautiful Austin. Great coffee and beer menu. Veracruz is on the property  which has hands down  one of the best Migas taco. This only makes it better 
Radio Coffee & Beer,375,Great place to grab a coffee or something stronger. Open outdoor seating with great people watching. Plus Vera Cruz Tacos on site  makes it one of the better spots in South Austin.
Radio Coffee & Beer,376,Great place. Love that it s on the south side. I only give 4 stars bc the parking lot does not accommodate the size of the venue and you have to worry about parking in the residential areas 
Radio Coffee & Beer,377,I ve been here a couple times and really enjoy it. They sell my favorite coffee- Stumptown  which is a huge bonus   Great outdoor seating area and delicious food trucks. Weds eves are trivia night which is pretty fun.
Radio Coffee & Beer,378,Stumptown coffee  plentiful indoor outdoor seating  free parking  and two great food trucks on the grounds. Great spot.
Radio Coffee & Beer,379,Ideal location for where I live  nice place to meet up for conversations --  However  while it s nice for conversation  the speakers are ALWAYS way too loud. I can never hear my friends.
Radio Coffee & Beer,380,Radio is one of those hidden gems in Austin  I love the coffee and tea selections  the staff are always wonderful. If you want some great tasty tacos try the Food truck outside. Don t forget about the bluegrass Monday s and movies on Wednesday when the weather get warmer. If you have anyone visiting you  bring them to this place for a coffe or beer  and enjoy the great patio it has to offer. Love Love this place.
Radio Coffee & Beer,381,Atmosphere is good but this place literraly turns off the Wi-Fi on the weekends or after 5 on weekdays. They only have a handful of  electrical outlets as well.
Radio Coffee & Beer,382,A must if you re in Austin. Coffee is the best around and I make it a point to visit every time I m in Austin. Cappuccino  or a beer  and the tacos from Veracruz are amazing. Can t go wrong.
Radio Coffee & Beer,383,Cool place to hangout. The service is shit though. They act like you re bothering them by ordering. They don t even smile or pretend to have basic social skills. Not to mention they have wifi hours 6 30am- 5 00pm like what in the f-.
Radio Coffee & Beer,384,This place is honestly the best  It has an extraordinary beer selection along with amazing coffee  music  environment and even the food trucks are incredible. Some people complain about the wifi policy but to be honest  it s posted right on the door... It s actually painted on. So to rant on those who are complaining about it... That s like walking into a business and asking why they are not open past regular hours just for you   Why even bother writing a review... Don t be a little bitch about it and just show up during wifi hours.   Check out bluegrass Monday s and this fiddler guitar player guy on thurs... Sooooo good   Best coffee  beer place in Austin  And amazing vibes all the way around  
Radio Coffee & Beer,385,One of my favorite coffee shops in Austin. Great selection of coffee  tea  beer  and wine. Staff are friendly and the shop is very cozy. That said  it can be very difficult to find a seat inside  most days  and parking can be a real challenge  now that this place has gotten super popular.
Radio Coffee & Beer,386,Best hangout place and my current favorite  Coffee  Beer and the Tacos  Veracruz Food truck - everything is so good here  In fact the best Tex-Mex Tacos I have eaten  You can find me here on Saturday mornings sipping a hot Cafe Mocha enjoying the Live music 
Radio Coffee & Beer,387,We went here Sunday morning at 11am. Waited 20 minutes for a Latte. The food Truck was worse. The wait for a Taco was 30 to 40 minutes. Spending  6 on each and waiting that long is annoying. There was not enough staff to run the Coffee bar. Plus it wasn t packed. I would hate to see what s it s like when they are busy. Latte was not hot. Probably won t go back. Super cute place but you ve got coffee and beer. Get it right.
Radio Coffee & Beer,388,It s a cool  casual spot  with plenty of outdoor seating  and good food trucks. Good selection of local beers  too  as well as live music and open mic nights.  Too bad the service is so poor. The bartenders there act like you re bothering them just by ordering a beer at the counter. It s been that way every time I went there  which is 3 or 4 times.  Last time I was there  the bartender was straight up rude. I was out for a drink with my friend  and he went inside to grab a beer for each of us. I was drinking Blue Owl sour beer  but friend friend couldn t remember the name when he got to the counter. He simply asked the bartender what was the sour beer on the list  not like there would be 36 of them to name  there was only one . The bartender rolled his eyes at him and said  beers are on the menu  pointing at the menu board on the wall. But the menu lists brewing companies and beer names only  not the type of beer they are. Was it so hard to answer my friend s question  That s not even going the extra mile  it just freaking basic customer service. What are you there for  dude  Midnight came and they told us we had a couple of minutes to finish up our drinks quickly  which is totally fine . But at 12 04  a bartender came outside yelling at everyone  GO HOME SO WE CAN TOO  repeatedly. Could you get more obnoxious  I ve worked in the service industry for 15 years and I have never seen anything like it.  Too bad  because it is a sweet spot for drinks  in an area where there isn t that many good places.
Radio Coffee & Beer,389,Worst customer service in Austin.  Possibly the state.  I ve been to most coffee shops in Austin at some point or another and the pretentious barista game at this joint is next level.  Mastery of the grinding beans and pouring liquid into a cup has gone to these guys heads I guess.  Walked into the empty coffee shop one morning and was quickly welcomed after 4 minutes of standing at the counter 5 ft away from a slightly occupied barista  welcomed   stared at blankly like I was the one who had made him wait without notice .  The rest is of the experience was more of the same.  Maybe these baristas moonlight as doormen at elite coffee clubs at night or something.  I don t know  but they must be famous in their own mind.  As far as the product goes  the coffee was mediocre.  Nothing special.  The best thing about this place isn t really this place at all.  It s Vera Cruz tacos outside in the trailer.  I ll continue to frequent the trailer but there s nothing to be had at Radio Coffee for me.
Radio Coffee & Beer,390,Great place to have a casual meeting  get work done or hang with friends.  Love taking my pup relaxing with a DELICIOUS coffee.  Must try the Migas from the food truck 
Radio Coffee & Beer,391,Last time I was here the day staff was awesome and the vibe was chill with great music. I guess that was a while ago... Things do change....Disappointed with the atmosphere and bad music this afternoon. Good coffee though.    Waiting for another Strange Brew     to reopen... or any place other than this one.   
Radio Coffee & Beer,392,They have really good coffee  but it s majorly overpriced 
Radio Coffee & Beer,393,It s great to have another coffee shop in south Austin  In addition to coffee and beer  they have kombucha on tap. When I went  it was a sparkly ginger lime. Yum   They seem to have added additional seating both in and outside since first opening  when it was impossible to get a seat   Parking is still a problem  but what cha gonna do   I am particularly fond of the giant photo of a fox under a rainbow hanging on the west wall.
Radio Coffee & Beer,394,I m giving this five stars in huge part because they have a Veracruz taco truck on site.   The coffee is great quality and they have a really good selection of beers as well.   The best part is that hipsters haven t completely taken over this place quite yet   They have a really nice grassy lawn area that s fenced in with big tree the kids can play on... Great for families   I suggest a cold brew coffee  a short pour if beer  and two Al Pastor tacos
Radio Coffee & Beer,395,Great coffee  great beer and great music.  What s not to like   This is my second office on some mornings and I am a big fan of their Bluegrass on Monday Night.
Radio Coffee & Beer,396,Drinks  fantastic Food  fantastic Music  person playing this basic country should be fired...possibly into the sun. I just heard a song about some one being poor because they drink soda and nicotine  now a song about a hot girl named Loretta. That s just not possible. Loretta is a 45 year-old mom that asks for the manager.
Radio Coffee & Beer,397,I love this place  but no internet after 5pm- so it can feel more like a bar.  It s like you don t want me to work too much or something.  p  LOVE it during the day. Parking is okay.
Radio Coffee & Beer,398,This place is extremely frustrating. It s a beautiful addition to the neighborhood  the coffee is good and the beer is reasonably priced. However  they do not offer table service. It takes forever to get anything here. I just had to open a tab for a cup of coffee bc refills aren t free. Then I had to wait in a long line for the second time in order to get said refill. The service is very very slow  everyone works at a snails pace and they aren t very friendly.   The wifi is another source of frustration. They shut it off at 5pm bc according to them that when the business day ends. Excuse me  Who are you to dictate when I clock in and out of work  What about us small business owners who trying to get things done after our day jobs  This will be the last time I come here.
Radio Coffee & Beer,399,Nice  mellow coffee shop bar.  I came here a couple of times during my trip. They have plenty of seating inside and out. Service were was great and prompt. I also like that they serve Stumptown coffee.   Would defintely come back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,400,I m a tourist in Austin  and Radio made me feel like one of the locals. What a cute spot  Loved the indoor outdoor seating options and laid back vibe. Enjoy some tacos from the nearby taco truck and you ve got yourself a solid Austin experience  I ll definitely be back next time I m in Austin 
Radio Coffee & Beer,401,We were so excited to try this place after all the rave reviews but it was really nothing special.  It is basically a smoky bar with outdoor lawn chairs.  We went on a Saturday and were disappointed that there was only 1 food truck.  We ordered 4-5 different tacos and most were not edible.. meat was tough  gristly.  The coffee at radio city was mediocre and they were out of almost all the specialty beers that we were interested in trying.  We ended up ordering our third choice beer .  There is no designated  smoking section  outdoors so the entire lawn is smelly and full of smoke.    If you are young  like crap beer  and want over-priced  average tasting  tacos you will love this joint.    If you are a non-smoker  beer connoisseur  foodie  or are looking for a family-friendly place... GO ELSEWHERE  Austin is literally filled with places that are better than this one.
Radio Coffee & Beer,402,Austin s own 512 Pecan Porter with a shot of espresso and chocolate in a cool almost cabin like atmosphere with super nice service and Veracruz tacos outside. Need I say more 
Radio Coffee & Beer,403,I may not be a coffee lover  gasp  I know  and I don t drink my coffee black. That said  the latte I got here was not sweet enough for me. My friend with me got an iced chai  but that was also not that sweet  so he had to ask for extra syrup to be added. Maybe next time I ll get a sweet donut to complement my coffee.  The atmosphere is nice  but is crowded because the place is popular. There is plenty of outdoor seating  which I can imagine would be very nice on a cool fall day. Not so much right now in the sweltering heat. There s a food truck outside and I saw many people eating their food along with their coffees and friends  which I thought is unique and nice 
Radio Coffee & Beer,404,Pretty cool place it s not cheap but it is a fun cool atmosphere seems like a good place to hang out if your a local  Latte was great 
Radio Coffee & Beer,405,This place was recommended to me as it is close to where we are staying.   I went to the website and it provides little information  like no food but Veracruz taco truck near by but no dayy time to find the truck. I found this out form YELP.   Beer list was long and interesting but no indication whether there was any real beer    cask conditioned  . How can Zagat call it a great beer place when no cask beers  the original beer live beer that takes effort to brew anbd serve properly with no deadbeer revived by co2 gas to bringit abck to life.  Coffee looks good but no list of types and description of coffee available.   I was hoping for music during the week but seems to be quiz night.  Even the website contact has no email just a phone that no one seems to answer.  Is it me or should Zagat places be outstanding and lifting the bar just a little.
Radio Coffee & Beer,406,This has become my go-to coffee hang-out spot thanks to its consistently delicious assortment of drinks  nearby breakfast tacos  and patio sunshine. Plus the folks behind the bar are helpful with recommendations.  On the flip side...parking  seating  and outlets can be difficult to find since this place is so popular. There are also occasional days when the  radio  is too loud for laptop work focus.
Radio Coffee & Beer,407,This place is always bustling with the largest group of hipsters you could imagine. The menu is limited pretty much to only coffee  and alcohol   only tea drink I saw was is Chai  I think. The coffee itself isn t the best  typical acidic-as-hell third wave coffee that you can force down and pretend it s good so you don t seem unrefined or get some sugar or cream in it like the uncultured swine we all are. Anyways  jokes and exaggerations aside  this place is just OK. Not great  but not terrible. Oh and also didn t have wifi for some reason while I was there one a Sunday morning. Overall good for socializing and bad for study.
Radio Coffee & Beer,408,Decided to give them another shot for lunch with my adopted shelter puppy who we are trying to socialize more. Ordered tacos and ran in to grab a coffee  but was told no dogs allowed inside. There are food and drinks served so I m guessing it s a health code thing  which I understand... but still. Obviously I could have tied up the little dude outside and run in  but wasn t too keen on leaving him alone while we work on his reactive issues.   It s not the policy that I m most frustrated with  but the lack of effort. For such an outdoor  dog friendly  place maybe a take-out window of sorts could be effective. Or hell  the place was empty after all with four  baristas  behind the counter  how about a  Hey what do you want  I ll bring it out to you.    Oh well  live and learn. Fool me once  shame on you. Fool me twice  shame on me.
Radio Coffee & Beer,409,The Cold brew is amazing and will put hair on your chest lol. Strong  Great spot to meet up  chat  and have a drink 
Radio Coffee & Beer,410,Really fun vibe. Although the parking can get a little hectic this place is a cool hangout spot.
Radio Coffee & Beer,411,This is a great date spot.  The beer and coffee selection is very good.  The staff is very friendly  
Radio Coffee & Beer,412,Bluegrass band every Monday night rain or shine  The Vera Cruz taco truck also has an amazing el pastor torta. And radio makes a great Bloody Mary
Radio Coffee & Beer,413,Great place to meet friends. Great drinks and food.  Wonderful staff.  Check out Radio.
Radio Coffee & Beer,414,I love meeting friends here for coffee  bucha and tacos.  Baristas are always sweet.  My kids love to meet their friends here as well.  It s a jewel in South Austin and I am grateful for it.
Radio Coffee & Beer,415,No Wifi on the weekends     Their latte s are double shots and pretty good though.  We went mainly to do some work at a cool place. And this place was a cool place but not work friendly on the weekends. Haha. We went on a sunny day  so inside was pretty chill and quiet and the patio was packed. Music was pretty loud too. Definitely a place to hang out with friends more than a place to get some work done.
Radio Coffee & Beer,416,This is a place where the coffee and service are funnier than the entertainment on offer.  After pouring out my coffee I went to Starbuck s out of desperation....and was grateful   A good place to gauge what it s like to live in Austin now   Radio will make you want to move back to California  even if you re not from there.  Yelp made me give them an undeserved ONE STAR.
Radio Coffee & Beer,417,Radio is my favorite coffee shop in Austin. I love the decor  vibe  coffee  my favorite taco truck in town and their wide variety of entertainment and events they have on their calendar. Radio is great to hang out with your dog  family  a first date or to work remotely from.  The stumptown cold brew is expensive but my favorite coffee treat in town.  Did I mention they sell Rose out of a can  Love Radio Coffee  amp  Beer  so happy it s in South Austin.
Radio Coffee & Beer,418,Radio has a sprawling property with a smallish indoor cafe and tons of outdoor seating  much of which is covered. I enjoy the chai and the gluten free zucchini bread. Great place to study or work in the open air or hang out with friends. WiFi works okay outside.
Radio Coffee & Beer,419,Such a great hang out space. There is so so much room outside to sit and hang out with your friends which I love because sometimes you go to a coffee shop and the only seat left is the one in the creepy corner by a trash can. I have always had the pleasure of having an awesome Coffee man helping me out at the counter to decide on my drink and explain things to me  prior to having my now coffee brewing obsession  which was always really kind  I will say I got a chai latte once and it was so spiced up that it was making me sneeze but after adding more milk it was all good. The vibes inside are sweet as well. Definitely a place to get work done during the day or chill at the end of one 
Radio Coffee & Beer,420,Love love love this place. The vinyls are always amazing rocking this house.  If they don t have a local artist performing. Double awesome   the beer selection is fantastic. Coffee on tap is always a plus and the food trucks outside are Delish. Do Yourself a favor and go NOW 
Radio Coffee & Beer,421,I liken a visit to Radio Coffee like putting on your favorite boots. You put them on because they look look good with your best jeans  but once on they feel oh so comfortable.  That is what Radio Coffee is to me. It is a hip cool looking spot and once inside it is super comfortable and inviting.  The ambiance is laid back and a great spot for conversations. The coffee is excellent while the beer and cider selection is thorough.  There are pastries inside with a selection of pre wrapped gluten free items.  I have been known to conduct an interview or two here  be super productive on the wifi  and also decompress at the end of the day with a nice cider.   The parking is atrocious especially at busy times. They have offsite spots.   I have yet to try the taco trailer out front and I am looking forward to spring when I can enjoy the outdoor seating.
Radio Coffee & Beer,422,Great place to meet and hangout. Coffee beer food. Good Austin feel. Not starbucks. Great outdoor patio. Kid friendly.
Radio Coffee & Beer,423,Coffee and pastries are the bomb. Awesome food truck selection. Loses a star for the truly abysmal parking situation.
Radio Coffee & Beer,424,The food truck lines are long so I would recommend ordering immediately and then going inside for your coffee. Although I wasn t drinking beer this morning their selection looked fantastic. I did have the nitro coffee with soy and it was great  By far the best nitro coffee I have had so far.
Radio Coffee & Beer,425,Before Radio opened  I read an article that detailed their strategy   craft beer  incredible coffee  Stumptown    and Veracruz tacos.  I actually shot off an email to my boyfriend with the subject line   ALL OF YOUR FAVORITE THINGS IN ONE PLACE    I don t always write subject lines in caps  so yes - I was excited.  But did Radio deliver   Heck yeah  guys.  The coffee is legit  the beer selection is awesome  the tacos are divine - my favorites are the migas and chorizo egg cheese.  The music they play inside is GREAT--somebody with insanely good taste is queuing that stuff up.  There s ample outdoor seating  but a word of warning about parking   it sucks.  This place is POPULAR and the parking lot is always full.  You can park along the street that it s on  but even that gets insanely crowded.  If I remember correctly  they might be turning that street into residential parking only.  In which case  I m not really sure how often I ll be visiting Radio.    
Radio Coffee & Beer,426,Always packed and it is always for a good reason. Great coffee  and definitely an Austin vibe. Great pastry selection as well  Highly recommend and suggest this for a great coffee or meeting spot 
Radio Coffee & Beer,427,Pros- the taco truck is amazing  Best breakfast tacos around and they serve them all day. The baristas always make great cappuccinos and lattes. The place has a fun atmosphere. Cons- parking can be a hassle and no wifi after 5pm
Radio Coffee & Beer,428,So I only come for the latte but it is the best latte I ve had  I think  ever. Terrible parking but great lattes.  Later Edit  they have added more offsite parking but I haven t had a chance to check it out yet.
Radio Coffee & Beer,429,Great coffee and vibe. Best hipster watching in Austin. Often times overcrowded with people  working  that it s tough to get a table.
Radio Coffee & Beer,430,I don t understand why dogs are not allowed in here.    Sometimes service is slow  despite a line out the wazoo.   And also wish they would have the band that is playing inside on the outdoor speakers.
Radio Coffee & Beer,431,I love the vibe at Radio. Inside and out. It s just ... perfect.  Beer  Kombucha  coffee  wine . The perfect hang out.   I m from the Pacific Northwest and Radio reminds me of home with a Texas twist.  I always end up here when I m missing my people. I drink coffee without the frills and Stumptown was what I cut my tastebuds on when going frill-less. I was beyond excited to see that Radio uses this amazing roaster as their one- amp -only.  There s a great taco truck in the lot too if you re there at lunch time.
Radio Coffee & Beer,432,I love this place   The vibe is so chill and the food and coffee rocks   I really loved the service I was given and I also enjoy all of the friendly people I met during my visit.
Radio Coffee & Beer,433,The fact that they ran out of brewed coffee at 9 50 am on a Saturday AND don t offer wifi on weekends makes this quite the fail for a coffee shop.  I ll stick to a couple beers on weekday evening  but only once every couple months moving forward.    The taco truck is still good but that s a different business. 
Radio Coffee & Beer,434,The coffee is decent and I love the taco truck outside.  My biggest gripe is the WiFi cuts out at 5pm on weekdays and is completely unavailable on the weekends.  I like to grab a cup of coffee and work for a while out of the office sometimes.  I see people studying all the time there... that s what coffee shops are used for.  I think the idea is to run off people that are camped out to free up more spots for music  trivia  etc.  I get that  but other coffee beer spots in Austin don t do that  Opa  Buzzmill  etc. .  I ll come back for tacos or wine with friends or something  but not for work anymore.
Radio Coffee & Beer,435,I loved this coffee house  Originally stopped for a quick coffee and ended staying a couple hours.  Loved the outdoor patio and my coffee was delicious.   My only complaint was the rude brunette Barista.  She was not friendly at all and lacked customer service skills. I kindly asked her from the doorway if my small dog was welcome inside with me to order my coffee or if I needed to tie her to the fence.  She rudely voiced  no dogs allowed .  When I came inside to order my coffee  she did smile or seem approachable . I almost felt scared to order.  When my friend asked if they had sweetener for her coffee  she stated they were out and just stood there and did not offer any alternative.
Radio Coffee & Beer,436,I m writing this review from Summermoon because Radio turns off their wifi at 5p on weekdays. I understand that they don t want people camping out forever taking up valuable real estate  but on the Monday evening when we were there  the indoor tables were almost completely empty. We had already bought tacos and drinks by the time we discovered there was no wifi and ended up having to slug them down and leave for someplace technology-enabled. I guess in the end  Radio got our money and we didn t linger  just as they d hoped - but they also lost our future business on days when we need to be productive.  This is a very sweet place to hang out and drink  eat delicious tacos from Veracruz All Natural  maybe listen to some live music or have conversation. But not a place you can use wifi after 5p - and on this day  that was a dealbreaker for me.
Radio Coffee & Beer,437,Fun place to hang or to have a business meeting.  Love the goat dish at one of the food trucks and Trivia Night in Tuesday s is a blast   
Radio Coffee & Beer,438,A poorly executed smattering of hipster cliches  drowning in it s own sepia tone  retro looks  and twinkling cafe lights. It s sad to see another business in severe identity crisis  one part coffee shop  one part bar  good at neither. They turn their wifi off at 5 00. Austin is a college town full of students. It would be less insulting to just have a sign that says  laptop people go away .   If I want to go to a bar  I will go to a bar. If I want to go to a coffee shop  I ll go to a coffee shop. If I want to hang out in a purgatory of beverage consumption that looks good in Instagram photos  I ll go to Radio.
Radio Coffee & Beer,439,Definitely my new hangout  Great coffee  large yard to find your own space to chill and oh yeah THE BEER   The ownership and staff are the nicest people you will ever meet   The building shows that reclaimed materials was a thoughtful part of design and ambiance.... Well done   The nitro-coffee is a real home run.  This place is what makes Austin  Austin.....
Radio Coffee & Beer,440,Monday night is bluegrass night 8 to 11.     Sunday  a group I am in  called Austin hoopers have  hoop church . From 12 30  to 2 30 we hula hoop in the grass and share tips on tricks  hoops provided   donations suggested  . For more info on austin hoopers look it up on  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fmeetup.com amp s 077f03ca6fcbacbd8626f92bdc3557d252b3b93aff296ea2aa3ca0c4cf2ca2c5  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  meetup.com  a  .  Parking can be tricky  may I suggest you carpool. Taco truck is good but be prepared to wait. I don t drink coffee so I have no opinion on that. Good beer selection. They have some non alcoholic  non caffeine choices  but I would like to see that expanded on  because that s what I go for most of the time  and it is a kid friendly place.
Radio Coffee & Beer,441,Love spending time at Radio with friends  but the music is too loud for it to be a good spot to get work done. Love their drink selection  but their Chai latte is one of the worst I ve had in Austin. I recommend their iced coffee and kombucha 
Radio Coffee & Beer,442,Coffee  beer and killer tacos...YES  Have been lucky enough to know this place since they opened and seen them grow in popularity. Super big hipster hang  so if you want to be cool  this is your shtick. But  if you want some killer tacos and a coffee or rotating craft beer  this is why I go. Either way  I say check it out  you won t be sorry.
Radio Coffee & Beer,443,I love this place. Don t come here.   Radio is best suited for  - People that work on Macs during the day - hah  - People that live nearby and love Veracruz tacos  great beer and cold brew coffee on tap - People that like sitting outside at picnic tables and playing a boardgame on a Sunday night - People that like chatting with  strangers  at the bar or sitting outside - People that are OK with riding their bike here or parking a few blocks away.  - People with beards  Who Radio is not for   - People that want a quiet coffee house after 5PM to do work - People that scoff at little kids running around having fun in the evenings on a school night - People that generally dislike craft beer - People that get annoyed if their food takes over 30 minutes to prepare - People conducting business meetings on headsets - People that get grumpy about tricky parking situations - People with aggressive or yappy dogs  Pro Tips 1. They have kombucha on tap. 2. They have cold brew coffee on tap. 3. They carry Duchess  sour beer  although by the bottle.  4. Veracruz tacos are sold outside. They take 30-40 minutes to prep. Be patient.  5. They have old school lawn chairs. You can set up  camp  under a giant oak tree around the side on a nice night.  6. There is street parking that is underutilized near the Long John Silver. You only have to cross at the light versus circling in the parking lot or ticking off neighbors  not a through street .  7. Buy a Nitro Porter pint. Also get a coldbrew pint. Sip each down a little. Mix. Have a Topo Chico on the side. You re welcome.
Radio Coffee & Beer,444,Ehh.....it s super convenient to where I live  but I ll be honest  service is NOT their strength. I come here a lot and have witnessed a customer try to bring in dirty dishes to the employees  only for the employee to respond   uh the bus station is down there   as he pointed to the opposite side of the room. She responded that she didn t work there  and won t be back again if that is the attitude she ll receive. Employees rarely bus tables  I ve noticed this to be a common theme.    Wifi is cut off at 5 and they won t turn it on during the weekends. MAJOR problem. Never seen that at other coffee shops.    I wish they were more customer friendly  because it is a nice place and has great potential.  It s also conveniently located. I guess we ll see if they value customers or not.  If not  there are plenty of other coffee shops  nobody is desperate  as a customer. 
Radio Coffee & Beer,445,Sadly they can t even take orders correctly. I ordered an iced soy latte and they made an iced chai. What s even worse  the chai tasted like milk with tons of spice  mostly masala   without any chai in it.
Radio Coffee & Beer,446,it seems nice  until you realize they TURN OFF the WIFI at 5pm during weekdays and is totally off during the weekend... please someone tell them it s 2017. useless ps  the music it s also very loud... even in the morning outside and inside...
Radio Coffee & Beer,447,Totally in love. The patio is absolutely amazing with lots of trees  picnic tables  and lawn chairs.  I m sure the coffee beer are great but the tea wine are better. My iced tea was beyond delicious and even came with a bonus refill.  They have happy hour daily from 4-7 and it s just a couple of dollars off but hey  that s taco money right there 
Radio Coffee & Beer,448,My first Friday morning in Austin- this place is packed at 9 am.  I asked for ice coffee and the gentleman at the counter misheard me and gave me hot coffee  which is also much cheaper . In my sleepy haze it took me a minute to realize the price mistake. When I mentioned I wanted iced coffee  he was more than happy to replace it and wouldn t let me pay the difference even though I offered.  This place smells like it s supposed to  sounds like it s supposed to  and is clearly well enjoyed by its patrons.  The nitro cold brew is the perfect blend of dark and strong without being bitter or harsh. They use stumptown coffee   Originally a Portland local roasting company   They also have a cute variety of pastries  including a very tasty gluten free tart and delicious gluten free chocolate chip cookies       Yay.  I will definitely come back on this trip and again in future trips to Austin.
Radio Coffee & Beer,449,Coffee was great  customer service was good. None of that matters though    An employee who works at the bar did not wash their hands. They were in a stall since before I had walked in and they just walked out and back to the bar. That is not acceptable.
Radio Coffee & Beer,450,What a great place to have within walking distance of our digs. I feel like this place is going to become a regular stop for us. I mean  what more could you want  It s a coffee and beer bar   Here are the things I love  Great coffee and an impressive beer selection. The bartenders baristas actually care about the drinks they re making and take pride in their work. There are clearly regulars here  and the staff knows who they are  what they like  and a bit about them. The kombucha on tap is a new addition  but every flavor I ve tried has been delicious. They ll fill a growler for you  and it s only  15. The atmosphere is very cool  and there is plenty of seating  indoor and out .  Here s what I don t love  and there s not much   Don t expect to get any work done here -- it s always really noisy. The wifi cuts off at 5 p.m. I found the cold brew on tap a little weak  but the flavor was good nonetheless.  Seriously  check this place out  There s a reason it s always busy 
Radio Coffee & Beer,451,So so.. wasn t impressed.. horrible juke box.. staff wasn t very attentive even sitting at the bar. May be a good place for locals for 1 drink or coffee on the way home  but it isn t the type of place that draws you in or keeps you there.
Radio Coffee & Beer,452,Great setting how they have it. Food truck with homemade tortillas  Went here for breakfast enjoyed the tacos and coffee
Radio Coffee & Beer,453,Probably my favorite place to have coffee and read a good book in the morning. Always good seating outside  amp  it s super convenient to have the two food trucks off to the side.
Radio Coffee & Beer,454,All the people who work there are super helpful and friendly. Parking around here is very tight. They are a bit expensive. But all in all it s a good place.
Radio Coffee & Beer,455,Finding a good coffee shop is a lost art  perhaps even obsolete. With all of the information in the world shifting to technology as opposed to word of mouth  speakeasy s are dying  blogs with lists of  hidden gems  are less read  and worst of all  coffee shops are getting more crowded.  I make the observations above because there was a time when South Austin had no quality coffee shops  slinging out shots of single origin coffee  whether in the fashion of a flat white  trending  or a manual pour-over  old news in Austin .  Barring the cessation of wi-fi at Radio after 5PM on weekdays  I still find this new favorite spot of anyone south of Riverside to be meeting all my coffee  beer  and ample work space needs. Wood-centric design with a touch of communal seating round out the welcoming environment.  Not really needing the mention this addendum  I want to promote Veracruz Tacos right outside  for its quesadillas  everyone goes for tacos  but never gives the  dilla a shot   phenomenal tortillas  and no-frills ingredients.
Radio Coffee & Beer,456,This place is very close to our house which is awesome. It is a great place to go on the weekend  listen to some live music and have some coffee or a beer. They have a good selection of beers on tap and their employees are well trained and know what they are doing when making espresso drinks. They carry Stumptown coffee which is okay - my husband and I prefer Cuvee. The outdoor area is dog friendly and there is a lot of seating. There are two food trucks which we haven t tried yet. Parking can be a little iffy  due to a small parking lot but the business across the street  car repair   will let you park there on weekend nights so we ve found a spot every time. There is a nice community and family vibe about this place - I ve seen the owner with his baby walking around and talking to the people every time we ve been in.  There are a few coffee shops in town who also have beer. This is more of a bar that also serves coffee. I ve heard that they cut the Wifi in the evenings so it really is more of a bar at night  which I think is great. They often have live music at night - so disconnect and enjoy conversation with friends and some good  free   live shows  Highly recommend it 
Radio Coffee & Beer,457,This is my favorite spot to hang out with friends and talk  go solo and read a book with a good cup of coffee or IPA. The outdoor atmosphere is cozy and we love bringing our dog here to socialize with us. I would definitely call myself a  regular  here now that I live in the area    it s awesome.
Radio Coffee & Beer,458,I originally stopped by for the highly recommened tacos from Veracruz taco truck outside  but wanted to get a beer to go with. So  I walked into Radio and see that one side is coffee and the other  beer.  I sat down at the bar with my tacos ready to order a nice  local IPA  but the douchebag bartender that was standing two feet away was ignoring me while talking for minutes to this girl two seats away.  It s as if I was supposed to get in line behind is little iPad and order in his face instead of being like a real bartender and move down the bar two steps to give me some service. I ve been a bartender for over 35 years in the hottest clubs in Dallas  Atlanta  Tampa  Vail and LA and this dweeb thinks he s a bartender   Pssh  The guy was a douche and nothing more than an order taking beer tender.  I won t go in there again because of this slack-jawed putz. I ll be back for the Veracruz tacos however.
Radio Coffee & Beer,459,I just moved to Texas from California  so I ve been searching the area for some good coffee and beer places  and I stumbled across Radio Coffee  amp  Beer  As soon as I got there I could tell they were a very popular location because there were lots of people there. There is a lot of seating  both inside and outside   which was super nice. When I went in I was wondering about a beer they had and the lady  I didn t get her name  offered me a sample without me even asking  It is a great place to go with your laptop and do some work  or read a book. But also a great place to have any social gathering  I loved it and will definitely be back
Radio Coffee & Beer,460,Nice  chill place to have coffee or a beer. Vinyl often playing inside  movie nights  and friendly staff. Veracruz All Natural food truck is awesome. Only complaint is parking  which is horrible.
Radio Coffee & Beer,461,LOVED it.  Coffee is great  great concept.  I will be back.
Radio Coffee & Beer,462,Love these guys coffee... taco truck on the premises is pretty banging as well   When there in the evenings that have gluten free beer for those of us that can t have gluten
Radio Coffee & Beer,463,Radio Coffee Bar.  Founded by musicians who love coffee  amp  beer. 2 of my favorite things   amp   the coffee was okay.  Stumptown  but I like Cuvee better.  Could use a better selection of pastries and eats.  The ambience was cool. Like a log cabin filled with bearded hipsters and business people.     The beer selection was great. Word of warning to you laptop-squatters  Wifi free and available only 7 30-5 or 5 30 on weekdays 
Radio Coffee & Beer,464,Radio is so superbly casual that you feel like you could walk in in loafers and code away. Their beer selection is local  fun  and not too pricey. And if you re looking for something a little bit more caffeinated  their coffee is well-balanced  not all the rage  but on the mark for nice sippables for the long haul. We love to hunker down here and get some work done among the cover music playing on the stereos  enjoy in good weather outside . Their picnic tables are the ripe location for last minute hangout with friends and the next-door taco truck makes Radio an excellent late dinner spot as well. Radio equals chill  work  hang  repeat  definitely a neighborhood regular pit stop  check it out 
Radio Coffee & Beer,465,Super chill spot for coffee and enjoying a great outdoor patio with ample space for enjoying al fresco.
Radio Coffee & Beer,466,Any place serving both beer and coffee gets five stars. Thrilled to see this spot in South Austin.   Not a huge selection of beer but what they have is good   Traditional coffee bevies but also cold brew on tap  whoop  Inside is decent sized  three times the room outdoor  good  cuz it gets crowded  Just added a canopy so now much of the outdoors is covered  -  Veracruz taco truck ftw. Parking is pretty terrible during peak hours  deal with it.
Radio Coffee & Beer,467,I will be singing the praises of Radio a little less loudly after today.  Since this place opened  I have recommended it to friends in Austin and those visiting  because it seemingly had everything  tasty coffee  a great beer selection  occasional live music  and a fantastic atmosphere for working or socializing. I am one of many students in Austin who work during the day and spend the evenings doing homework  and this was a fantastic place to set up in the evening to do homework with a cup of coffee  followed by a tasty beer or three as things wrapped up.  However  Radio recently instituted a new practice of turning off wi-fi at 5 00 PM sharp. This is demeaning to customers who made use of Radio s previously versatile environment  and was accompanied by rude comments from the employees  who blew me off when I inquired about wi-fi. By shutting down the network before many people even leave work  Radio has effectively made itself unsuitable for doing any sort of evening work that requires Internet connectivity. Good thing we live in a city with enough other options  Strange Brew  Irie Bean  and Cenote  to name just a few  that we do not have to deal with such a policy and negative environment.  Perhaps I will have a rare occasion to visit Radio on an evening free from school work  but in the mean time  we live in a city saturated with more suitable bars  coffee shops  and combinations of the two.
Radio Coffee & Beer,468,The drinks are delicious  and Radio Coffee has created an excellent environment for work  study  or meeting a friend  Their prices are as expected for that part of Austin and the atmosphere is cozy. Great spot 
Radio Coffee & Beer,469,This is my usual hangout spot for just chilling  board game nights  and brainstorming ideas with friends   Radio automatically gets five stars for being close to Veracruz tacos.   I usually get the nitro brewed coffee. It s pretty strong in my opinion but just right. When it gets cold in Austin  their covered patio seating feels awesome with their heaters.   They also have stand ups and live music throughout the week so that s definitely a plus.
Radio Coffee & Beer,470,Just went there for the first time and seems like a cool place  however I was looking for a coffee shop and this is not it. Walked in  bought a  4 nitro brew  opened up my laptop and no WiFi. How can you be a coffee shop without WiFi    Was told they turn the WiFi off on the weekends  which is an unusual choice  but at least put a sign up at the register so people know or apologize to your customers when they ask about it.
Radio Coffee & Beer,471,The LOUDEST coffee shop I have ever set foot in  bar none. Mediocre customer service. Fantastic soy cortado. Important note  they turn off wifi on the weekends  Little to no cell service inside  due to metal roof. Between the volume level and lack of connection to outside world  do NOT come here to study. If you re looking to sip some great coffee while slowly blowing out your eardrums  this is your place 
Radio Coffee & Beer,472,The coffee isn t bad  but you definitely come to Radio for the food truck s  and outdoor space. The taco food truck is really yummy  Plenty of seating. Parking can get full but pretty easy to find something close enough. There s a parking lot in the back that s a bit hidden. Dog friendly. I ve heard they have live bands on some days  but I ve only been for breakfast on the weekends.
Radio Coffee & Beer,473,I ve been here twice.  Coffee is yummy and ambiance is cool.  NO PARKING   Last time I went in  though  I walked in and there were 4 baristas behind the counter.  Not one acknowledged me.  I had time to send out a tweet about how I love being ignored by before anybody actually did say something to me.  Then RC amp B never responded to my tweet.  That s just poor customer service.  I will return if a group is already going  but I will suggest other spots first.
Radio Coffee & Beer,474,I love this place to meet up with a friend or two for a casual beer or coffee  regardless if it is in the evening or during a lazy weekend. The wibe is casual but not dive bar. Very dog friendly too.  Beer selection is decent and coffee is great. For a weekend brunch I d probably stay away from their mimosas though.  The two food trucks used to be good unfortunately the taco one is way too crowded to bother with and they switched out the good one for Paperboy that is so sub par it s ridiculous.  But if you come for a beer or a coffee to just hang this is an awesome place  but being bug spray the amount of flies and mosquitoes may have you leaving otherwise  maybe it s time to invest in some fans outside .
Radio Coffee & Beer,475,Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew. Basically cold brew on steroids. IT WAS SO GOOD. It wasn t cold as they didn t put any ice in it  probably not to water it down  so don t expect a cooling drink. Do  however  expect an acidic free perfect brew that looks like beer  and dang just writing this review makes me want to go back. Albeit what other reviews mention  I thought their service was friendly and quick    Also  I got Vercacruz tacos -- al pastor and chicken mole. I chowed those down in minutes. Their green sauce is in a red cooler on the side  and it s spicy. Like spicy to the point where you re debating whether or not you should put it on your next taco  but know you will because it s just too good to resist. Reasonably priced for the meat you get  too. I only paid  6 for two tacos  
Radio Coffee & Beer,476,I just don t get it. It s ridiculously loud. Kids running around everywhere. Picnic tables in dirt. And literally the worst chai latte in the world. It taste like dish water. Why not go to a bar if you want beer  I ve tried three times. Are we this desperate for a place to hang out  I m giving it two stars instead off one because they carry Moonlight Bakery. Even the breakfast tacos from the food truck are mediocre. I truly wonder how many of the five star reviewers even hang out here still 
Radio Coffee & Beer,477,Coffee  beer....interesting combination  not as a drink of course . I was pretty pessimistic about this concept. I guess I m used to the idea of a coffeehouse only serving coffee  tea and other non-alcoholic drinks.   When I got out of my car  I automatically loved this place. The patio itself was welcoming. I walk inside the rustic interior of the place away from the brightness of the sun. It is nice and welcoming.   I ordered a iced coffee and the interesting thing is they gave it to me in a glass which is used as beer. I thought it was a mistake but I thought maybe okay I get beer instead. It was good iced coffee and a great place to have it in. Wish I brought my laptop. I would have stayed longer.
Radio Coffee & Beer,478,The best breakfast tacos you ve ever had await you in the truck outside. Try them  So good    The coffee is stumptown  very good stuff. I Live in NY where lines move really fast and servers are very efficient and don t take time to chat unless it s relevant to the job  so i am not used to the timing of lines moving slow. But that s ok  it s maybe kind of awful to feel rushed ALL OF THE TIME as we get pushed through lines in NY. So I m happy to wait a bit longer. The porch is great for outdoor seating  I wish we d had more time to go back for evening live music  Inside is good coffee house atmosphere. I could see getting some admin study work done here. I will be back 
Radio Coffee & Beer,479,Overall it s a great place for food and coffee. If you re looking for a quiet place to work at don t come here. Music is super loud  outside and inside. Parking is not easy to find either.
Radio Coffee & Beer,480,I looove this place. COFFEE  amp  BEER  Sign me up  Lol  jk.   Beer coffee  my girl friend had the cold-brew iced coffee... so good  no milk necessary. Mm... And they serve it in a beer glass  so that s fun  Great selection on beers  I had their Founders IPA... LOVED it  Crispy and really nice aroma.  Service  everyone s so friendly and helpful. I had a thousand question on the different types of IPAs they had and they answered every single one of them haha  Ambiance  so cutes with all the  christmas lights  or whatever. The indoor seating is just like a cafe. But theres plenty of seating outside also  on the grass  on the side on a little deck or picnic tables.  Anyway  just a calm chill place to enjoy something good to drink. And theres also a food truck that serves really good mexican food so... PERF  Definitely will be coming back to this cutesy little spot.   Parking  not so great but who kurrs.
Radio Coffee & Beer,481,I m not as impressed with the coffee as some other commenters. It was good coffee  but I feel like I could get the same coffee further North  closer to home . I happen to be in the area for a meeting and I m not familiar with S. Austin nor the parking situation at Radio. Apparently those who know the area  know where to park   Don t park on neighborhood streets  If there s a next time to meet down South   I ll find a Starbucks that has plenty of parking to avoid another ticket
Radio Coffee & Beer,482,We ve been here several times now  and have been less impressed with each visit.  The good   decent  if overpriced  coffee  decent  if slow  breakfast tacos  fun people watching  and great location for South Austinites.  Their pastries are also very good.  Dog friendly.  The bad    6  tiny   cappuccinos.   4  tiny   glasses of OJ.  I could understand that if it was fresh squeezed on site  but it s not.  Breakfast tacos from the food truck outside took over an hour on a Sunday afternoon when the place was moderately busy  but not slammed by any means.  There was never a line at the window of the taco truck  and many of the tables were empty.  No idea how breakfast tacos could take this long.  The parking situation is pretty bad too  but there is some street parking in the surrounding neighborhood.  The ridiculous  No WiFi on weekends     Come on guys...  If your current connection can t handle 50-100 simultaneous devices  spring for a better connection like any other business.  WiFi would seem to be a pretty basic amenity to offer your customers  especially at these prices.
Radio Coffee & Beer,483,This place is a great addition to the neighborhood  The aesthetic is lovely and I like that they encourage computer go-ers to share tables  also that they shut off the wi-fi at 5 to make the transition from work to play .   The staff is great and even a seemingly long line moves quickly. It s a bit cozy for some of the musical acts they have  read  wino vino  but it definitely leads to a very intimate experience.   Coffee is good  beer selection is great and varied  and the taco truck out front is great.   I love the folding chairs and tables for a choose your own adventure seating experience.   Overall a great place to check out whether it s just for a cup of coffee or to knock back a few beers with some friends.
Radio Coffee & Beer,484,So  it s been a few weeks and I ve been to Radio about dozen times at this point. I ve worked there  had business meetings  met friends  hung out and picked up tacos.  Radio gets 5-stars because they have awesome tacos and food  East Side Pies  YES. Vera Cruz taco truck  AMAZING. Delicious pastries that are not wrapped in plastic wrap  WIN. Also  they use Mill King milk  AWESOMESAUCE.  Service has always been solid to me. Always nice friendly folks.   The only con... Parking. Sucks.  I think it s only a matter of time before the neighborhood street turns into  Resident Permit Only  which will only make parking worse.  The parking situation shows how desperate people in 78745 want awesome places in the neighborhood. Granted  this place is in  04  but everyone I see here lives in  45. Anyone who opens a business with quality stuff will do well in 78745.
Radio Coffee & Beer,485,I want to love this place. I really do. I want to like this place even. The coffee is actually good.  However  when I go to order a couple of lattes with an extra shot and then get sassed by the barista about the number of shots it already comes with  it makes it impossible to enjoy. I do realize I had gone in on a day when it was full of ACL amateurs. And sure  it was busy as hell. I ll give them that much. But  please  do not be the caffeine police. I m a grown-ass human. I can t even park my damn car in the parking lot.
Radio Coffee & Beer,486,This place is the TITS   The cold brew nitro tap coffee is a one of a kind cold brew and fantastic.  Creamy and earthy and amazing.   Great beer selection.  Parking sucks but it s an awesome thing to do in Austin  so that makes sense.   Lots of outdoor space and the indoor is minimalist and rich and woody.    It s a place I m glad is in the neighborhood.  My other options were Black Sheep  too crowded always  or The Park  I m not a douche nozzle .   Get a cup of coffee and you shant be disappointed 
Radio Coffee & Beer,487,I LOVE this place. The tacos  the coffee the Kombucha on tap  and the ciders. Both the food trucks are a must and the environment is unmatched.   Beware  if you are going there to get work done and need wifi it gets turned off at 5pm.
Radio Coffee & Beer,488,Delicious coffee and one of the best taco trucks on the premises  but the owner turns the WiFi off on the weekends  because they get  too busy . Boo  I will help them not be too busy.   
Radio Coffee & Beer,489,Nice place to relax and read a book or work off site. A little noisy from time to time  and parking can be a bear  but there are food trailors and gourmet coffee
Radio Coffee & Beer,490,Coffee is great.  My only complaint was that the cashier I dealt with was a little uppity.  There was a miscommunication about what I ordered  I wanted a Cafe Latte  he though I wanted a Cafe au Lait .  When I got it from the barista and he said it was a Cafe au Lait  I said I had ordered a Cafe Latte.  The barista immediately went to correct it  however the cashier overheard and had to come over and proceed to tell me   For future reference  it s calld a Latte .  Well  Mr. Cashier  actually  Latte in Italian means  milk .  So  go to Italy and order a Latte and see what you get    I wish I had thought to say that but instead I said  Well  I normally order it by Latte  however when the place I go to lists it as Cafe Latte on their menu board  up there behind your head   I call it Cafe Latte.   Yep.  Don t try and tell a customer how to order - especially when you are the one who is wrong.  I will go back and give it another try because the coffee was great and I d like to try the beer  but if I get an attitude like that again  I won t return.
Radio Coffee & Beer,491,This place was not my vibe but I will not knock it for that.  Its a really nice place I just never felt really comfortable while I was there.  I love the outdoor patio.  It is spacious enough that the tables are well spread out to allow for conversation without feeling like you are at a bar.  Speaking of bar they have a solid beer selection to meet even the snobbiest of beer snobs expectations at a very reasonable rate.  I am not a coffee drinker so that whole menu might as well be in French.    Also they have one of the best taco trucks in town parked out back.  You cannot go wrong with any of the tacos here.  Two things to note though  the tacos are pretty large so 1 did a pretty good job of filling me up and they make everything fresh so it can take 30 minutes or so to get your food.  Since you are at a bar coffee shop just order another drink and have some good conversation and the time will fly by.    My only real knocks are the parking and the lack of Wi-Fi at night.  What kind of place shuts off their Wi-Fi during business hours     I will come back again and see if the vibe is better  maybe it was just my mood on this particular evening.  This is a solid addition to the neighborhood and I wish them all the best.
Radio Coffee & Beer,492,It s a cool place to hangout and drink but if you re looking to work or use WIFI - stay away. They recently decided to turn it off after 5PM on weekdays and no wifi on weekends.   I used to love to come here and work on projects but no I m unable to do so. Really annoying as I used to come here quite a bit.
Radio Coffee & Beer,493,First time customer.. Staff was stuck up  long lines and overpriced for an only okay product. The iced chai is absolute trash. I took one sip and threw it away  all i could taste was ginger and no chai  I saw quite a few reviews also saying the chai is nasty so maybe y all should take that into consideration.. Probably won t return since there s many other amazing local coffee places here
Radio Coffee & Beer,494,Good stuff. The best part is the vibe. For sure. Also the taco truck in back is wonderful. Almost spiritual.
Radio Coffee & Beer,495,Very cool place in a converted house.  Great beer list  with fair prices. Taco food truck  as well as East Side Pies pizza slices.  Wine list is good  coffee is wonderful.  Staff is a bit hipster  but not over the top. Clientele on our visit ran the South Austin gamut  and we liked that  Can t wait to try out the awesome fire pit and or hang on the great patio during sunny days.
Radio Coffee & Beer,496,Won t be going back.  I m a block away and I use their place for many of my meetings.  The coffee is awful but the convenience has always been the reason I go.  The atmosphere has been pretty good as well.  For some reason  they had an entire section of their yard closed today.  Every table in the place was occupied. My client and I sat at the only table that offered any privacy for our meeting.  Word of advice to the dude in the orange  unkempt beard.  When all of your tables are full  don t act like an ass to the people who are sitting at a picnic table in your completely empty section. I won t be back  I won t promote your business to my clients and when YOUR customers leave their cars in my parking lot  they will be towed.  I m hoping it s a really nice car I get to have hauled out of here. You sir are an awful neighbor.
Radio Coffee & Beer,497,I feel lucky to have such a great  chill coffee house walking distance from us. The food trucks are just ok  I m not sure what I m ordering  and btw  they are not owned by Radio- just fyi  wrong  but it doesn t matter  I m not going to Radio for the food...their coffee is SO good  Love to sit on the patio with our pup and just relax and chat with other locals. The other amazing benefit is that if you re not feeling coffee  they also have great beer and wine  A serious  win-win-win 
Radio Coffee & Beer,498,Easily the best  most unique coffee shop I ve been to.  The coffee is fine.  I m not here for the coffee.  It s a bonus but id rather have a mimosa or taco.  It s way too fun and vibey to be a boring coffee shop.  It s always a mixed bag here and my go to spot for business  hangover   and mom meetings .  Try the tacos or a mimosa  if you haven t heard.
Radio Coffee & Beer,499,If you feel like winging a night out-Radio Coffee and Bar is a cool place to check out on a Friday Night.  It has everything from a chill atmosphere  awesome patio seating  live band and hula-hoops   Yes-I said hula-hoops.  This trendy bar that is located within blocks of family neighborhoods-literally was a diamond in the rough.  Seeing how laid back the atmosphere was made it really inviting.  With the chill outdoor seating area  this is a great place for a group of friends to meet up and catch up on the weeks events.  There is also a taco truck located out back-havent had their tacos yet  but plan on checking it out the next time I visit.  Inside has an elegant feel.  All drink items are listed on the chalk board behind back.  Great selection  that highlights the best beers in Austin and around the area.  If you are not craving a beer-they have a decent coffee and tea selection that pair up great with the yummy desserts.    I honestly think this place is a good place to grab a beer and chill with friends.  Couldn t have asked for a better experience and would definitely come back again.
Radio Coffee & Beer,500,Great spot  I swung by during a work trip and ordered an iced chai which had a nice amount of spice and later  a local Pale Ale. The place is laid back with plenty of room to work or hang out. I can see how parking could be an issue
Tyson's Tacos,1,24 hours  any tacos you want and they re actually good quality. Does it get better than that  No. No it does not. Did I mention the service was quick   I d like to suggest everyone try the  dirty horchata   which is 75  horchata and 25  coffee. Give it a mix when you get it and enjoy.   After reading the reviews about the bathroom being out of service  I had to check it out. The bathroom was clean and was working although the employee at the front wasn t sure if it was working. I can confirm it was indeed working.   Overall  a great place to try any time of the day if you re in Austin.
Tyson's Tacos,2,Live down the street.  Last experience made me write this review.    Ordered online at 12 46AM on a Wednesday through Tyson Taco website.  Wait until 1AM and text message alert my order should be done to check at window.  Go to window and the lady isn t checking on me even as I stand there for 5 minutes.    Then I wait she finally opens up the window and calls 5 orders from people waiting on the patio from the microphone. Each person quickly comes up gathers there order and leave.  After this I finally get to her ask her about my order  2 tacos  I ordered 20 minutes ago and give her my name and she doesn t see my order.  Asks for my name again and still doesn t see it.    She asked me which app I ordered from and I said the Tyson s Taco website  and said if I don t have an order number it means my order was rejected   Seemed like bs because I checked my receipt and it shows it billing my mastercard  and I don t see a 4 digit order number like everybody calling out.  Surely this isn t the first time she has been working the window and this has happened   Maybe ask what my order is   Maybe be more concerned - no her quick rushed response was let me work on some things and I will come back to it.  After waiting maybe a minute I said I have already ordered online  listened to the text message telling me to check the counter  waited 5 minutes while she calls other orders and ignores me to only ignore tracking down my order.  At this point the food is so slow getting out nobody is in line - the patio is packed.  I go to the cashier and ask where my order is  I see I have been charged on my mastercard and text message says it is done.  It is only 2 tacos - he goes back and finds my order.  I said that the lady working the counter the service is so poor because she wanted me continue to wait while she works on other things.  Poor wasn t my exact words...  So the lady who is slow getting food to come out hears me complaining and comes over asking to talk   All of a sudden she cares about my customer experience   I mean if she cared I think she would have been able to track down my 2 tacos.  As I tried to explain why I was dissatisfied she kept interrupting me saying can she talk.  She kept saying can she talk while I continued talking to explain why I was upset in a very argumentative way - It was like we were in Junior High... I thought this was very rude as she wasn t letting me finish  but probably shouldn t have really let it get to me as it did - it s just 2 tacos and she really just didn t care if I waited all night.  But  to then act like you did care  Man who is this lady    I have lived about 5 minutes away from this establishment and late hours there isn t much game in town  but man after this lady really tried to stand up and check me over her wanting me to continue to wait to get basic service.  How long do you want me to wait to track down 2 tacos that are already made   Maybe 15 minutes   Ok...  What is the point of ordering online if ordering through the line is faster   In the end my name is displayed different in the app as my initials rather then my name I gave at the counter  its not like I order from Tysons Taco daily and know this   but the lady was very rude throughout didn t care to ask me what I ordered and would have me continue to wait all night for 2 tacos.    Then give me an attitude saying its my fault and that she was doing everything ok.  Talk about customer service   I ended up getting my tacos at 1 15AM from my online pickup order placed at 12 45AM.  Think about that for a minute...30 minutes to get 2 tacos from the time you place the order    Talk about ordering online  avoiding the 2AM rush  and still getting treated poorly every step of the way.  Welcome to Tyson s Tacos   Do you really want to go here   They were good tacos - but not worth all the bs.
Tyson's Tacos,3,This place is open 24 7. Great place for a late night snack or even a taco heading into work.   You walk up and place your order at the window  and grab a table. They will call your number once ready  and you ll grab it up from the pickup window.   Pro Tip - Grab a seat before ordering because it fills up fast 
Tyson's Tacos,4,Y all  this place s been around FOREVER. And I ve been going here FOREVER.   And it s one of the FEW remaining 24 hour ACTUALLY 24 hours day open places in Austin   I know staffing issues are everywhere     I m going through a bit of an obsession lately - how did I never realize that they lightly fried your exterior corn tortilla before  How did I never realize how GOOD their bacon and potatoes were  How did I never realize how absolutely flawless the chips and queso are    Really recommend the rage 2.0 and the bean and cheese. Fantastic.   Love coming here after a late night out  or any time  really.
Tyson's Tacos,5,Wow   Open 24 hours     Great food   My wife knew about this place and we dropped by around midnight.  There was a friendly officer hanging out front which I thought was nice  though I don t consider this area  or any really  dangerous.  I got the 3-taco plate that came with rice and beans and was honestly floored by how good the rice and beans were.  The mark of a real authentic place for sure.  I tried a brisket taco  surf n turf taco and a chicken taco and all were stellar   This just became my new go-to to end any evening.  Nice vibe  covered seating outside  easy to park  friendly people at the order window.  There is nothing here not to like.  5 stars.
Tyson's Tacos,6,Tacos tacos  Came here with a friend after a sudden change in plans  the name mentioned tacos so the choice was an easy yes. Tyson s tacos is a quaint small shop  but don t let that fool you the menu is pretty big  there s surely one kind of taco to suit your fancy  and apparently it s open 24 hours...so perfect if you have cravings and live near by.  Atmosphere  Small patio with a local older business vibe. Not the prettiest or cleanest  but there is a certain charm to it all in terms of being Austin-y and a small food business.  Food  The real shiner of this story. With such a massive selection of tacos one is surely to suit your fancy. They have the traditional beef and chicken type of tacos  but expect to see more premium style ingredients like  angus beef brisket  burnt ends  or even crispy duck. I ended up getting the crispy duck  pork belly  and one of the burnt end options. As expected  so good and pretty filling  the tacos are all a decent size. Stand out being the crispy duck  something about having the right sauces and the right crunch of the duck with the right type of tortilla bread.   Service  All counter service style  you go up to the window and order and then they ll call your name. Mostly self serve but simple enough.  Let s taco bout it  and there s certainly a lot of tacos to boot. A nice small patio location good for a small outing to sate those cravings.
Tyson's Tacos,7,Sooo...part 2 of the Taco tasting was here at Tysons Tacos.  While I ve heard a lot about this quaint spot and their play on taco fare...I was honestly not impressed...maybe it was a bad day ...the damn Austin heatwave ...but it was just not good.  I can see where it has some alluring combinations ...and most seem to rave about the breakfast tacos...I m still having a tough time calling anything in a flour tortilla a  taco ...but nonetheless me and my boy went in on the lunch and dinner tacos  Tasty Basterd  5.25 a play on surf and turf...I can t say it was memorable...there was a decent amount of shrimp..the fajita meat was a bit over done and the Diablo sauce was lacking in heat rating - 2.5 out of 5  Burnt Ends  4.99 pretty basic brisket  fried onion strings and cilantro.  It is available daily until they run out...again not memorable...really small pieces of brisket...didn t truly look like burnt ends ...I did see them pulling real brisket off the smoker...so I can attest to the fact that they smoke their own  Big plus there...the onion strings got lost in the sauce..but overall rating - 2.5 out of 5  Scooby-Doo  4.99 I was so looking forward to this one...its chorizo  burnt ends and pineapple with queso fresco....it was cool...but I couldn t taste the chorizo at all...whatever sauce that was..tasted like it was heavy on oyster sauce..but it masked the chorizo flavor.  Overall rating 3 out of 5  Al Pastor  4.99 welp...gotta always have something like this on the menu...good ol reliable...as long as you can treat the meat properly...this was the best of the ones we tried...the only knock I would have is  the grilled pineapple with the pico...probably would be better as a grilled pineapple salsa Overall rating 4 out of 5  All in all I m gonna have to try it again...I believe every restaurant has bad days...and maybe it s all about the breakfast tacos...but we ll see on the next go round
Tyson's Tacos,8,Tyson s Tacos is currently  4 on my list of one hundred and forty taco locations.  AustinTacoMojo.com  Favorite Tacos  The Hank  veggy-chorizo  scrambled egg  avocado  queso fresco  and The Rage  egg  black bean  fried avocado  pepper jack  creamy Sriracha . The salsas are incredible  be sure to try  em all.  The Hank is no longer on the menu but can usually be made for you upon request.  Arrive hungry and be prepared to fight off the grackles  cause they re gonna want to eat your tacos just as much as you will.  Outdoor seating only. 
Tyson's Tacos,9,My friend  a UT grad  said that this place was one of her favorite taco places because of their pork belly tacos. I would agree.  I was excited to try the brisket taco but it was unremarkable compared to the tender pork belly. Pork belly taco was the best  There were some crunchy bits and meltingly soft bits. Every bit was delicious   Bonus points for not overstuffed super messy tacos and a cool outdoor seating area. Grungy chill hipster vibes. Bug spray might be necessary for this time of year
Tyson's Tacos,10,My last review blasted a very burnt pork belly taco that was a lazy attempt at fusion. I think they ve since taken it off the menu   I came back to bring a coworker from out of town to a tried and true taco joint. I got the diablo shrimp again and tried the scooby - which was soso good  I didn t know what burnt ends was but this is my new go to. I do wish it had some kind of fiber in the taco.   Diablo was not what I remembered  seemed a bit on the salty side.
Tyson's Tacos,11,This placed is opened 24 7 and you can get breakfast all the time. What more could you ask for  The tacos are delicious and good. My favorite is the King George it has migas  bacon  sriracha mayo  and wait for it...fried avocado. It s everything you could ask for in a breakfast tacos. Great and place tacos the Al pastor and Barbacoa  heavy on the oily side . What s also delicious is the side sauces they give you with the tacos.  The red salsa and a green sauce are so good with the tacos and if you ask for extra  it s free  they are great dips with chips. Overall recommend 
Tyson's Tacos,12,3 Taco Plate with beans  amp  rice for the WIN WIN WIN   1- Tasty Bastard  Surf  amp  Turf   Ribeye  Shrimp  Queso with fried avocado  onion  cheese  amp  peppers on flour tortilla.   2- King George  Migas  Bacon  fried Avocado  cheese  onion  peppers on flour tortilla.   3- The Bond Girl - sausage  egg  amp  Cheese on flour tortilla. King George  Fried  Breakfast    1- Large   DIRTY HORCHATA   if you ve never had one  amp  you like Horchata and you like coffee then you will be strung on this match made in heaven.. Heaven being Tysons tacos in Austin it s absolutely insane I have places make them for me elsewhere but here is the real freaking deal  Every time we come visit from NB which isn t very often anymore we stop here for sure no matter what time or day it is. Conveniently they are open 24 7   the only thing that sucks is every time we come through now they are usually out of my most favorite item. The chicken Tinga  and there isn t anything in the world as bad ass as it is I promise you. Chicken Tinga
Tyson's Tacos,13,Pretty solid place.  My big complaint is that I don t think the tortillas were fresh. It s not that they were bad  they just weren t good. And I think that is actually really important.  It might seem like the tortilla is just there to hold the meat and add-ons  and who really cares how good the tortilla actually is. I don t agree with that though. I think it s important. Probably even the most important part of the taco. Same with sandwiches and bread  pizza and dough  and dumplings and the noodle.  Anyway  the meat and add-ons did happen to be awesome  - Scooby  Had chorizo  burnt ends  pineapple  and queso fresco. Man was this good  Really good  I would definitely go back to get more if I lived in Austin. The chorizo was super flavorful. And it went so well with the pop of sweetness and acidity you get from the pineapple. I love that combination. - Brisket taco  It was fine but not great. The brisket was tender  but not juicy or flavorful. A little dry. - Burnt ends  Pretty good. - Breakfast taco  As I write this review  I realize that it isn t actually what I ordered. That s ok though. It had eggs  cheese and some sort of crunchy fried onions maybe. I really liked the eggs. They cooked  em well. A lot of people overcook eggs  and they come out dry and fluffy. These were slightly underdone  which gave them a nice egg-y creaminess.  Still  I gotta knock  em for the lack of fresh tortillas. I was in Los Algodones Mexico a few weeks ago. They had people on the streets making and selling fresh tortillas. SO GOOD  I d take one of those with some cheese over one from Tyson s  even though the quality of the meat was way better at Tyson s. But having said that  I d still recommend stopping by Tyson s if you re in the area  especially for the Scooby.
Tyson's Tacos,14,When I pulled up to this spot I wasn t impressed but that sentiment changed very quickly once I tasted the food  These were the best tacos I ve had in Austin  Cooked to Perfection  Steak was tender  Very flavorful and presented well. The menu has a lot of variety which I like in Tacos. The more choices.. the better. And to say I stopped late at night the wait was pretty short and for a good price  Would recommend this place to anyone who visits. Get there 
Tyson's Tacos,15,I live right down the road  and shame on me for not giving Tyson s more of my attention. I love this quirky little building that s a walkup  but still with a deck and seating area. The vibe is so Austin  my sister and her out of town family loved it when we went there.   We got 4 breakfast tacos- the King George  the Rage  the Avocado Abogado and the B is for Bacon. They were DELICIOUS. The King George  which is a migas  definitely won out over the migas we had at Verac  z  and it s a dollar cheaper. I loved the Avocado Abogado and the salsas provided. If I had to critique  my sister couldn t really taste the creamy Sriracha on her Rage taco  and no  it didn t send her into a rage .  The price point is  well  on point for what you get. I can t wait to go back and try from their lunch and dinner menu 
Tyson's Tacos,16,Perfect for late night food. We came in late and we re hungry. Decided to Uber eats tacos. Queso dip w meat was amazing. We had the 3 taco dinner. Brisket taco was lacking flavor and too greasy. Pork belly was more belly than pork. Al pastor was delish. Barbacoa was yummy. Tasty bastard was not tasty  I didn t like the flavor But they have so many options and are open late. Definitely a great option
Tyson's Tacos,17,This place is delicious  Really love the potato and the rib eye in the Avocado Abogado taco  and the Bond Girl is a classic if you love sausage  egg and cheese breakfast tacos.   The orders come out pretty quick even if there s a long line ahead of you which is nice because I m pretty sure they used to take much much longer. Hang onto your receipt because they ll sometimes want to verify your order number before letting you grab it 
Tyson's Tacos,18,Vibe is great  Wish they had some sort of heating outside but come costed up and you ll be good. I got the brisket taco on flour which was good I loved the combo of flavors and the crunch from the picked onions. The flour tortilla was really sub par  they tasted like processed tortillas you buy at the store that can last on the shelf for months on end. Same thing with the corn tortilla. The fillings are super tasty  Just the tortillas need work. Find a local vendor or change the one you work with now because there not giving you good quality tortillas.
Tyson's Tacos,19,Came here late on a Saturday  11 30pm  and there was a line but wait took about 15-20. The tacos were underwhelming. They were out of the crispy pork that I wanted to try. The 3 stars is mainly for the drinks. We tried 2 and they were just not good so we tossed them out  the horchata and a hibiscus tea . The tacos we tried were decent but def overpriced for the size. We did have to wait about 10-15 min to get our food. Decent spot for afterhours if you re not wanting fast food.
Tyson's Tacos,20,We a fun looking little joint. This place came highly recommended so we had to give it a go. As we drove up we realized that this place had caught our eye before. The decor and unique set up is quite fun and stands out. And the tacos  they were just as good as we hoped they d be. Unfortunately the rib eye hadn t arrived yet so we couldn t try the Avocado Abogado  but next time we re in the area we ll try for it again.  They give you a green sauce and a red sauce with your order. The green sauce has quite the kick to it and I highly recommend trying out. The red also was good  not my favourite  but I still used it with a few of my tacos and it was yum. They also have complimentary cucumber water or orange water. The cucumber water was more refreshing  the orange water tasted like flour was mixed in  which honestly  I like dumpling water so I didn t mind the flavor too much.  What we got   Fried Egg  amp  Brisket - 5  OH. MY. This brisket was gold. This was the first taco I tried and I was nervous that it would set a very high bar for everything else.  B is for Bacon - 5  the second taco I ate and WOWIEEEE. Delicious   Matador - 3  it tasted a bit bland  especially compared to the others. I don t know if I would have had a different opinion if it d been the first taco I had. Overall an average taco  but an average taco at a REALLY GOOD JOINT.  King George - 3.5 4  another more mild in flavor taco but still really yummy.  Rage 2.0 - 3.5 4  another more mild in flavor taco but still super good.
Tyson's Tacos,21,Summary  24 7 place  Great place for a large group late at night in need of a bite  Great tacos nonetheless  Not terrible of a wait either   FOOD  three taco plate with rice and beans  tasty basterd  puffy chicken tinga  brisket taco  is very filling and quite delicious  Very much worth it    PRICE   12 is not bad for all the food you get   SERVICE  very courteous and patient for being 24 7  Cheers
Tyson's Tacos,22,Everything about this place is pretty freakin awesome   Tacos almost 24 7     What a freaking score   They have these smokers out back near the kitchen  and man are their brisket tacos a must   Off to the side there is a small patio with chairs and a couple tables.    Every time I come here I try and get something new  but it can be difficult  cause you will definitely find yourself ordering the same thing next time.  Get a Taco plate  you will be paying about the same for 3 tacos  except this will come with rice and beans.   The Crispy Pork belly was exactly what I needed tonight  crispy  juicy  not over cooked.  The Diablo shrimp was the bomb too  perfectly spiced with a verde sauce. It wasn t to overwhelming or anything  but it certainly packed a punch.  The Brisket Taco   and the King George Taco are ones I usually always order.  I love the combination with the avocado and the Fried egg.  Their brisket is pretty damn good  moist  fatty.  Some of the best tacos in Austin I have found hands down.
Tyson's Tacos,23,Lots of options on the menu. There is only outdoor seating.   Crispy duck   kinda dry  but the hoisin sauce saved it a bit. I feel like it needs more greens to balance out the duck skin. Wouldn t get this one again  Diablo shrimp   nice spice and well cooked shrimp. Tasted good overall  Scooby  good balance with the pineapple  kinda tastes like ground beef though  Crispy pork belly   also a bit dry  but adding the green sauce is really good  Service was average  but they were slow in getting our order out and it wasn t a busy night at all for them. The sauces that come with it are pretty good. The tables were dirty. If you are to get the three taco platter  I would try to get the most expensive ones on the menu  otherwise it s not worth it. The rice and beans is such a small portion that it doesn t really add much. I just got it because the 3 tacos I chose were all close to  5.
Tyson's Tacos,24,I ve learned to be leery of places open 24 7. Food quality usually takes a hit for the always-open convenience. Loved this place   Pick up was easy. Great beef fajita meat - well marinated and flavored  tender. I liked the chicken fajita taco but not on same level as the beef. Al Pastor taco also the bomb  packed some flavor. The Rage egg taco was killer as was the more basic bacon egg n cheese. And the salsas were excellent- so key to me for any Mexican food and these were all on point. Props on the prep  we ordered a few items without cilantro and got each order correct
Tyson's Tacos,25,These tacos are bad ass  No wonder Tyson s Tacos are open 24hr. We can t get enough of them. Personal favorites are the King George and Burnt Ends. Can t wait to try others.
Tyson's Tacos,26,Great ambiance and chill time  Tacos are gourmet with great flavors  Definitely recommend to try. It s a tad on the pricey side  but the quality is good 
Tyson's Tacos,27,After landing at the airport  I knew I wanted to eat as many tacos as possible on my trip to Austin. Fitting since I consider Austin to be the taco capital of the US. I love that the tacos in Austin are a mixture of Tex mex and many places with great breakfast tacos as well. I ve been to Austin a handful of times and had never been to Tyson s before but I m glad I came on the recommendation of multiple friends.   You can get a taco plate  3 tacos   rice and beans  for  13.50 which is reasonable. And don t forget to check in on Yelp for a free iced tea  The tacos I ordered were the  burnt ends and brisket  senor ranger fajita  potatoes  bacon queso fresco  and bell peppers  and the tasty basterd  shrimp and ribeye with sriracha cheese . My favorite were the burnt ends and tasty basterd tacos with senor ranger coming in a distant third  although some of my friends really enjoy the senor ranger. The burnt ends is a nice sweet and savory taco with the caramelized bbq sauce and burnt ends. The tasty basterd tasted very fresh and the shrimp was cooked very well. I would definitely recommend dropping by here to fill your taco cravings 
Tyson's Tacos,28,Good food  rude service  The best part here is you can find vegetarian options and the tacos are good but really did not enjoy talking to the people them as I found them rude while taking orders.
Tyson's Tacos,29,I was in town doing an Airbnb renovation and a friend of mine swore by Tyson s for breakfast tacos.   It is an unassuming location where you order and wait outside for your food to be ready. On the menu they have a lot of variety in both breakfast  lunch and dinner.  As you wait there are tables underneath a strobe light and music playing  all in sight of a monstrous bbq pit. My friend and I were interested and stiked up a conversation with the grill master  he said the pit can get up to 30 briskets at a time   Breakfast tacos were delicious and definitely worth the wait. As we were waiting  my friend was telling me stories of spending many a late nights here. Food is definitely five star.
Tyson's Tacos,30,Great meat in the tacos and especially good dirty horchata. Really good if you need a good pickup.
Tyson's Tacos,31,If your looking for a place that s open late  Tyson is the place. They have good amount of variation of taco and pretty good. I usually get the plate as you can get 3 tacos and rice and beans.  But be warned  sometimes they are very slow. Wait can be up to 30-45 mins.
Tyson's Tacos,32,The wait is always long around mealtimes  but sooo worth it. The best pricing and quality tacos near me 
Tyson's Tacos,33,Tyson s definitely has some delicious and unique tacos  My favorite is the tasty bastard. It s got tender juicy steak  shrimp  and cheese. It s definitely worth the  5 price tag. Their queso is also bomb  Note these are  gringo  tacos and on the pricier side. I took away 2 stars because the service and ordering can be a real hassle. They never answer the phone for pick up orders and when they do they put you on hold for 5  minutes then just hang up on you. The online ordering system is always down too. So basically you have to come here and battle with the crazy lines. Especially during peak times and after hours.
Tyson's Tacos,34,Kinda greasy but flavorful. One of few food places that are open late. Worth the wait. It s outdoor seating.
Tyson's Tacos,35,Nice ambience and decor  but pretty bad tacos.   We tried the al pastor  diablo shrimp  barbacoa  scooby  and duck. The scooby was probably the most interesting  and the shrimp were well-seasoned. Everything else was extremely bland and salty  and the tortillas were soggy and falling apart. The salsas were pretty flavorless as well  which I found puzzling. The duck taco was extremely bad.  Prices are super high for the area  especially given the quality. I ve had better tacos for cheaper downtown.  One highlight is the decorvery unique and fun approach  and nice lighting choices.
Tyson's Tacos,36,This is the only taco place open late in the area. Perfect place to visit after late night parties. Everything tasted good  even though they messed up one taco on our order. Mind you  there a huge huge huge wait in the night at least 
Tyson's Tacos,37,Hot take  Tyson s Tacos has the best breakfast tacos in Austin. I know everyone has strong opinions here but I will always suggest Tyson s as my top pick for anyone that asks. The bacon is always perfectly crispy  the eggs are always fresh  the cheese is perfectly melty  and the potatoes are the perfect combo of soft yet crispy. I typically stick to the classics for tacos but they also have a ton of funky  more adventurous options when it comes to their menu so there s something for everyone. As far as the location  it s a nice outdoor spot in the Mueller area and there s always plenty of parking either in the lot or on side streets. Also  it s open 24 7 so you can literally get breakfast tacos any time you want. What more could you need   COVID Precautions  Since there is no indoor seating  there are no mask mandates and minimal precautions.
Tyson's Tacos,38,Probably some of the best tacos in Austin.  I ve been here quite a few times now and this is probably one of my favourite  taco spots in Austin. They fuse the 2 major Central Texas food groups of BBQ and tacos.  What I like  - the meat in the tacos  especially the bbq meats like brisket is smoked on site and is absolutely delicious and is unique experience you don t find at many places - the fact that they re open 24 7  there is a severe shortage of restaurants that are open in Austin after midnight apart from Whataburger  and Tysons adds some variety to the mix - the ambiance  Tysons has a cool ambiance with tons of interesting stickers everywhere and cool club like lighting at night  What I disliked  - The service time  it can take a while for you to get your tacos even when it may not appear to busy  the cashier tends to disappear while taking orders so you may wait some time to order  after ordering they will up to 40 mins before you get your food - The parking situation  there are only a few marked spots in the lot and at times it can be a challenge to park  pro-tips  - order ahead  it can take them ages to get your order ready so if you re in a rush  this ain t the place for you - my favourite taco is the scooby  brisket burnt ends an pineapple  - get the 3 taco plate  it s more cost effective if you go for the premium tacos - their dirty horchata is awesome
Tyson's Tacos,39,Super yummy and open 24 7   Say no more.   Decided to stop by for some tacos and was very satisfied. I came on a tuesday evening and there were still some parking spots around. only outdoor seating but very dog friendly    the crispy pork belly taco is a MUST. the mandarin oranges were a great touch and balanced the flavors well. the al pastor with pineapple was a similar taste. I recommend both. I plan on coming back to try their breakfast tacos one day.
Tyson's Tacos,40,This one was disappointing. I had high expectations based on the reviews.   Pros- - Open 24 hours. Great as a late night option - Nice seating area - Price   Cons- - Took forever to get the tacos   - Taste was average  -  Packaging for to-go was bad  Not sure if the day I visited was just one of their bad days. The space was definitely crowded and there seemed to be a lot of delivery orders being placed. Might try during the day next time
Tyson's Tacos,41,Best tacos in Austin. The crispy duck and brisket are out of this world. These aren t no wimpy filler tacos either. Although they are  5 a piece they have at least a quarter pound of meat in them with just enough garnish to add flavor.  Plus they are quick  chill  and serve tacos fit for any time of day. At breakfast I m a fan of their vegetarian options  not available on doordash .  Their dirty horchata is also delish 
Tyson's Tacos,42,I ve eaten a lot of tacos around Austin so I can honestly say these were the worst I ve had.  I ordered the brisket  duck and bean and cheese tacos. The duck taco was the only one that was warm when I got it and the only one that tasted mildly ok. All the other tacos I had were cold. I took one bite of the brisket taco and threw it out  it was that bad. The bean and cheese was tasteless and I had to add a lot of hot sauce to make it taste like anything. Very disappointing.
Tyson's Tacos,43,Stopped in because Tyson s was open even though it was pretty early on a weekday.  A simple stand with a couple windows to order pickup from - we saw several people picking up call-in orders while we ate our tacos  so obviously pretty popular. We can see why - the tacos were great   They have options for everyone for any time of the day. Since it was early  we got a few breakfast tacos but would love to come back for lunch  too. All the tacos were good  but the one the stuck out to me was the King George - loved the Migas in it combined with the other parts.  Super reasonably priced and pretty fast to get the fresh made tacos out to us. They also have all kinds of drinks  from coffee to soda to cider   so really can t go wrong here any time of day
Tyson's Tacos,44,To preface  I would give the vibe and the food here a 5  however the staff here lower my experience.  The cashier up charged us because she imputed that we ordered different tacos than we had that were much more expensive. Furthermore  the tacos do not come out labeled. From the outside it s all just aluminum foil  how are we supposed to know what is what.  The vibe of the restaurant was super cute - I appreciate the heart theme going on. The tacos are RAVE WORTHY. I got the Yoda - would highly recommend to vegetarians and non vegetarians alike. I love the pairing of the potato s and the beans and the sauce really push it over the top.  The new la chona taco is also delicious. The tilapia is fresh and breaks apart in your mouth. Paired with mandarins and finer sauce gives it a heavy asian taste. Super delicious   
Tyson's Tacos,45,Best hole in the wall patio Taco stand. Had a lot of options for pescatarians and vegetarians as well as meat eaters. They also have a breakfast and brunch menu  Authentic Mexican desserts  sodas and sides as well. Will definitely be back 
Tyson's Tacos,46,The green salsa was huge and extremely spicy. The tortilla chips were large and plentiful. The dirty horchata was too sweet  but it did the trick to calm the spiciness of the green salsa.    I got the Avocado Abogado and Tasty Basterd tacos. The red salsa goes great on top of the tacos  The Avocado Abogado was really tasty  but the brisket was a bit tough. The Tasty Basterd was flimsy and soggy.  The seating was very limited and small. There was an unpaved parking space in the back.
Tyson's Tacos,47,I am so glad we got time to stop by Tyson s during our weekend in Austin. We tried a few other taco places like Torchy s and Velvet but they did not come close to Tyson s. Located on the side of a busy road. This place gives out quite a unique vibe  especially at night.  We were disappointed because initially we came for the Crispy Duck taco but they ran out of duck and a whole bunch of other stuff  e.g. Avacodo  when we were there at 8 pm on a Sunday.   So we ordered the Al Pastor  Crispy Pork Belly  and the Tasty Basteted. They are all delicious. The crispy pork belly came with small slices of mandarin oranges  surprisingly they go really well together.   The line can get long at times but the order goes out fairly quickly. Our only complaint was that we couldn t try the crispy duck. Coming to Tyson s is definitely a highlight of our Austin trip. I highly recommend coming here for some real Tex Mex 
Tyson's Tacos,48,Dangit guys - I recommend this place to all humans who are in search of regular-hour tacos and tacos for humans who live the life of  sleep is optional.  I went around 4am today  not even 45 minutes ago  and ordered 3 crunchy tacos. The wait was minimal and it wasn t busy at all  ... they called my number  threw in the salsa  and I drove home. I got here  unwrapped the trio and arranged any rogue ingredients that had come out of the taco shells. All was lovely and then  one of the tacos wasn t even halfway filled up with anything  I ve never had any issues with anything I ve picked up here so this was sad ... I ll still recommend Tyson s to anyone wanting lovely tacos but man... that ended up being an expensive 1 4-full shell
Tyson's Tacos,49,Honestly if I could give this place zero stars i would. Trust me I know what a good taco taste like.   1. Tacos are OVERPRICED- 5  for ONE taco  2. Tacos are lacking flavor and meat is chewy and hard 3. Service is slow Also was forced to give them a 15  tip after spending 60 . Who forces their customer to tip them   It s literally a grab and go place. Anyways don t recommend it at all.
Tyson's Tacos,50,RACIST       This is the first time I ve written a review for a restaurant  but I felt like my experience should be shared. I order food online around 1am because it was one of the few 24hr restaurants still available post Covid. When I arrived my food was supposed to be ready around 1 30 AM. Upon arrival I walked up to the front cashier and she refused to acknowledge my presence. A Hispanic male and a white male walked up behind me and she immediately spoke to them and disregarded me. This made me extremely mad but I kept my composer. I stood at the counter for 5 min as she looked me dead in my face and ignored me until I began to wave at her Consistently saying  hello I m here to pick up an  she rudely  slid the window open and said  it ll be ready shortly  then called out a number on the Intercom and slammed the window in my face. While standing I noticed there was a black woman speaking to another clerk in regards to her treatment and how the lady was acting racist. Regretfully I didn t step in or speak up for her because her situation occurred before I arrived but I still should ve said something. They handed her an order and asked her to leave which she did. She didn t create a scene or act belligerent. I waited 20 additional minutes before going back to window and attempting to explain   I m here to pick up an online order  but she refused to slide the window open and literally just stared me in the face while I attempted to talk to her. This woman looked at me like I had      on my face and spoke to everyone but me. She even sipped on a drink while looking at me. I immediately went to the second counter and asked for a refund and explained the situation the clerk wrote the woman s name on a piece of paper and gave me the number to a supervisor pictures will be provided. The workers name was Belen and the supervisors name is James. To make matters worse I receive a text from them telling me to pic up my order that should ve been ready at 1 30am at 6 30am. A few days later I reached out to James and explained the situation over the phone. He apologized and issued a refund. Some of our post conversation was via text and a screen shot will be added. If your a black man or woman do not support this establishment and if your one of those people that claim black live matter or marched for George Floyd don t spend your money here either. I literally had to contemplate if I wanted to maintain my composure or snap on that lady. Instead I remained respectful and decided to write this. To make matters worse I m come to the review section and see other reviews from black people commenting a similar or worse experience. I hope this effects Tysons Tacos business because you deserve every dollar lost and to the black woman that was disrespect before I arrived I apologize for not speaking up.
Tyson's Tacos,51,Food was great but cashier was rude. I would go back just to order another dirty horchata though  Hopefully the cashier is a different person   
Tyson's Tacos,52,Wish I found this place sooner  This 24 hour taco stand is a must to try. I got the three taco plate  for  12 dollars I felt it was very filling. You can sub toppings for others  or even build your own. They are friendly  I will say  while the tacos was great  the potatoes lacked some seasoning. However  the salsas they provide elevate the taste of these tacos. You need to try the salsas you won t regret   I got the three vegetarian tacos  Yoda  Tre s Garden  subbed mushroom for veggie chorizo   and the Rage  sub fajita veg for egg . Also - if you re vegetarian and don t eat lard. Ask for black beans instead of refried   This isn t a place people really eat for a long time at. People normally eat and dip. Also only outdoor seating but it is covered 
Tyson's Tacos,53,I went to Tyson s Tacos on a weekday night. The parking spaces are very tight  I d recommend street parking and walking a few blocks.   They were quite busy so the wait was around 20 minutes to get my order. I got The Rage and Yoda and the horchata. The horchata was very tasty and refreshing in the heat. The tacos were quite disappointing. They were small  3-4 in.  and not notable in any way. I wouldn t recommend this place for vegetarian tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,54,Absolutely amazing tacos. Highly recommend the crispy pork belly taco  which is topped with mandarin orange and tastes AMAZING. The line moves quickly. The outside seating makes it easy to seat larger parties  and it s open late.
Tyson's Tacos,55,This place has some of the best tacos around. They have some of their own unique tacos  as well as traditional breakfast tacos. I love their food and the service is great.
Tyson's Tacos,56,Tacos were legit. It s go time  IPA beer avail plus the authentic menu can t go wrong. Tacos are savory and delicious. Tacos in Austin  sounds amazing to me.
Tyson's Tacos,57,THE VIBES WERE IMMACULATE. My friend called this a  nightclub with a taco restaurant.  I came on a Wednesday night around 7 30  so there was no line  but I ve heard it gets really busy at other times. The outdoor patio nighttime ambience with the disco ball and lights is so vibey. The taco plate is a good deal because it is three tacos of your choice with rice and beans. I had the tasty basterd  crispy duck  and al pastor tacos. The al pastor was my favourite  and the crispy duck was too crispy hard for me. The free water they have tastes disgusting  but everything else about this place is perfect.
Tyson's Tacos,58,I really like Tyson s. My absolute favorite that keeps me going back are the puffy chicken tinga tacos. They are heavenly.   I d give them five stars  but you are absolutely rolling the dice each time you order. Will you get what you order today  Mostly  especially if you make no changes to your order. Ask for something simple like no lettuce  good chance you re still going to get lettuce. Thank God I m ambivalent about lettuce and flexible with my orders. It s something they really need to work on  but I love it so much I keep going back. Ack  sounds like a bad relationship. But seriously  go to Tyson s.
Tyson's Tacos,59,Came here for brunch- it was about a 15min wait for 6 tacos but it was well worth it  My boyfriend and i shared all 6 by cutting them in half  3 tacos ea  and honestly couldn t finish them because we were so full    The steak they use for the tacos is great- flavorful with great texture- not chewy whatsoever. Their ingredients taste fresh. Don t be fooled by the portion sizes- these are super filling but not heavy. These weren t oily greasy at all. Can t remember which tacos we had but we did 3 breakfast  3 lunch tacos- definitely recommend the bacon  egg one  brisket  and fried avocado one 
Tyson's Tacos,60,New breakfast spot  My boyfriend ordered to go    We tried 4 different tacos  On Corn  - Al Pastor  - Vals Classic Migas  - King George  - BAC  Bacon Egg and Cheese    Really enjoyed the variety of flavors. My personal favorite was the King George.  We do wish the tortillas the tacos came in were less oily.   They have a huge menu that looks delicious and would like to try more 
Tyson's Tacos,61,I love Tyson s tacos. This was a regular stop for me when I lived in austin  so it was a must-stop on my taco tour of Austin. I always for for the breakfast tacos  the White Girl taco I think  Anyways  Tysons has a cute outdoor seating area and a fun  laid-back atmosphere with fabulous tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,62, Delicioso  Don t know Spanish but the tacos are good in real life. Believe the hype 
Tyson's Tacos,63,This is my second time coming to Tyson s Tacos and actually dining in this time. They only provide outside seating in a patio that is covered for shade. They also have plenty of fans for a nice breeze.   You can only order from one window that I know of. Then pick up your food from around the corner. They always package your food to go regardless if you re dining in or for takeout.    The tacos are huge and stuffed   The salsa here is amazing especially the hotter one for all the hot heads out there.   I ordered the Rage 2.0 and the brisket taco.  Rage 2.0 is a breakfast taco with eggs and bacon. The brisket is under the beef category  which comes with avocado and onions.   Just be ready depending on which taco you order it may be a little greasy from my experience.   They have plenty of taco options here for all of you. I would definitely recommend Tyson s Tacos. The food  the atmosphere  and the service.
Tyson's Tacos,64,Amazing tacos and good pricing  Love the outdoor seating  and the staff is so friendly. The horchata is delicious too  
Tyson's Tacos,65,AYE BRUH how the hell y all gone charge me mf  4 for chips and queso and not even pack it fuck you mean  this some whitewashed ass shit bro I m taking my ass to casa Maria or torchys cuz I ain t even gotta pay they ass for the chips. Seriously never trying this place again the only thing good DRUNK at 1 45AM was the beans smh. Cancel the whole business  UPDATE  I stand by this after careful thought
Tyson's Tacos,66,As of late  they stop serving individual orders and individuals  to complete large corporate orders.  You are lucky if they acknowledge you at the window.  Unfortunate  I did like the early morning taco or tacos and coffee.
Tyson's Tacos,67,I have written bad reviews for this place  but today I need to give 5 stars. I go to work early and this is one of the few places near my work open early. The service has been pathetic until this morning. A very friendly young lady acknowledged me immediately and gave me online order with a smile and thank you. I hope she is there every morning  I would begin to enjoy getting tacos from this place.
Tyson's Tacos,68,The breakfast tacos where amazing  I had the double bacon  the Bond girl  and the egg and brisket.  Very cool spot  the coffee was good too.  Didn t try any of the lunch tacos  so can t say but the breakfast tacos were out of this world.
Tyson's Tacos,69,Came here for some late night tacos and they did not disappoint. I ordered the Matador and the Crispy Duck tacos. The Matador was easily my favorite- I loved the creamy sriracha and they gave a good amount of chorizo. The Crispy Duck was also really good- it had an Asian taste because of the hoison sauce. Only complaint was that some of the duck was really crispy and I couldn t taste the actual duck itself.  They only have outdoor seating and since we were there at night  there were a ton of bugs flying around and on the tables. We ended up just taking it to-go to avoid the bugs while eating.
Tyson's Tacos,70,I am so so so glad my friend introduced me to Tyson s  We would literally make plans to go here every other week after one of our classes as a treat-ourselves-for-surviving-four-hours-of-torture treat. I m going to miss Tyson s deeply when I move out of Austin. Don t forget to check in on Yelp for a free iced tea    
Tyson's Tacos,71,Tried Tyson s Tacos for the first time as my friends were talking about it constantly   Sadly  it didn t meet my expectations  and I think there are so many other taco places in Austin that are better than Tyson s    The server wasn t very welcoming and the food was just okay overall. However  it does open 24 7 so if you are craving late night tacos  I would give it a try.   I got the taco plate with brisket taco  King George  and Crispy Pork. Crispy Pork was the one everyone recommended me  but I personally didn t like it because it was too greasy. My personal favorite was King George. Although it is a breakfast taco  they serve it all day. It has fried avocado  egg  migas  and creamy sriracha  kinda like spicy mayo   and it was one of the best breakfast tacos I ever had  The brisket taco was just like a classic taco  nothing special. After I finished the whole taco plate  I still wasn t feeling full because the tacos were pretty small     Their horchata was pretty good  but I wouldn t recommend it if you don t have a sweet tooth. Overall  not the best taco place in Austin but not the worst.
Tyson's Tacos,72,Chicken fajita tacos where boiled chicken breast that were bland and overcompensated for by mounds of bell peppers and some onions.   Puffy chicken tinga was a bit better but not by much. Soggy  bland  some flavor from the fried tortilla but needed a drench of salsa to mimic Hispanic flavor. Unfortunately the puff couldn t handle so much moisture and fell apart.   I d say... don t try the chicken.
Tyson's Tacos,73,Visited while seeing family in Austin for the first time  and they insisted we go here. I thought the prices for tacos were high at first  but these are seriously awesome  custom  large tacos with meat they grill on site. We love every single variety we tried plus the funky atmosphere in the covered outdoor seating area. Can t wait to go back some day 
Tyson's Tacos,74,Great foods and great service   I had two tacos  one Brisket and the other Barbacoa  both well made and full of flavor  The green salsa was amazing  Not too spicy but just enough for your mouth to tingle.   The only down side of eating here is the lack of wheelchair accessibility. The seating area is on an upper deck and the only way onto it is by walking up the stair. They have seating outside of the deck but it s not covered and is very limited.
Tyson's Tacos,75,Dame fine quick and quality service. Open all night and barely a wait after ordering. The burnt end tack was delicious and the queso was great as well. Prices were acceptable and it s 24hrs
Tyson's Tacos,76,This is easily of my favorite taco spots in Austin. The wait usually isn t too long and there s nice outdoor seating with good Austin vibes. If you go here you HAVE to get the horchata...it goes well with everything on the menu and is some of the best horchata in Austin. All the tacos are pretty good and there s parking on premise too
Tyson's Tacos,77,I ve come here quite a few times not and it s become one of my go to taco spots. Between the wide variety of options  affordable prices  and being open 24 hours its pretty hard to beat.   There s a fairly wide range of prices for their tacos given they re all about the same size  but the any 3 tacos plus rice beans for  12 is an absolute no brainer.   Some of my favorite tacos I ve tried are the flash  anything with their ribeye has been great   tasty bastard  surf and turf with just the right level of kick   and the king george  hadn t tried fried avocado on a taco before but it balanced the sriracha so nicely .   The only somewhat negative experience I ve had is with their chicken tacos  the chicken was pretty dry and I found myself dousing it in their delicious green hot sauce.   Covid wise it seems pretty questionable  the tables on the patio are pretty tightly packed and there s been a few times employees will talk to patrons with masks not covering their nose. On a take out only basis pre-covid experience this would definitely be 5 stars  but that level of neglect is too much to not dock them.
Tyson's Tacos,78,Update  decided to order for myself one more time and my abagado has no avocado.... Instead a lemon wedge. This is getting ridiculous.
Tyson's Tacos,79,DO NOT EAT HERE   Their workers are EXTREMELY DISRESPECTFUL AND RACIST  They messed up my order three times and then gave me an attitude about it. I will be calling corporate. The food isn t worth the terrible attitudes and customer service.
Tyson's Tacos,80,The food wasn t very good to me. There was no seasoning flavor on any of the tacos I had. I have never had nasty bland brisket. The Al pastor taste like they boiled the pork in water and that s it. All of our tacos were cold and my friend order queso and even that was thick and lukewarm. My friends and I were very disappointed  but we wanted to give them a try.
Tyson's Tacos,81,Not the bestttttt place for vegans. They have only one vegan taco  tre s garden  which is not that good in my opinion  but you can make your own. My favorite combination to get in a taco is mushroom  fried avocado  onions  and rice  Wish they had more vegan options cuz my non vegan friends love this place and always want to come here 
Tyson's Tacos,82,Not worth the 4 star review.the ribeye steak was very chewy.  It was ok food. The place is very dirty. I would find another joint
Tyson's Tacos,83,Another Taco Tuesday place to try that was on my list  but I wasn t too happy with this decision. Granted  it is a small shack like place where you walk up and order  but I feel there could ve been more to this place. I ll explain.  The menu seems like they have tons of options for tacos  including breakfast ones you can grab early morning  or any time for that matter. Lunch and dinner tacos seem pretty limited for my taste  but the cheap prices do draw people in. Keep in mind there might be a little bit of a wait if it s busy  and it seemed like they don t start preparing your food until they finish with delivering the previous guests  order. I waited about 20 minutes.  I got the flash and barbacoa tacos. The flash was tasty  peppers  onions  great beef fajitas  and more spices made this taco my favorite one here. I ll come back for this one only as of now. The barbacoa  on the other hand  was sort of a disappointment. The skirt steak was a little over cooked  and it felt hard to finish this one because it tasted too charred. I think I ll put that one off and try more breakfast tacos in the future if I decide to come back. I d call the taco options mediocre on this one.  Look  it s not a bad place  but they seem to not have enough for what a good taco truck shack should have. Plus they were out of a few beers that I wanted to try  but they do have cheap prices  so you can t deny that. Not good enough for 4 stars  but the food offsets me giving them 2. 3 it is 
Tyson's Tacos,84,Great spot  will definitely be back  Got the chicken fajita taco  fine  standard but not noteworthy -- good tortilla   and the crispy taco  this was excellent   chips   salsa   queso. Food took an oddly long time  but the vibe is awesome and it s reasonably priced  good Mexican food. Recommend 
Tyson's Tacos,85,The best tacos I have ever had  This place is the perfect example of  Don t judge a book by its cover.  The 3 taco plate is a must and you can t go wrong with any of the tacos. My favorite are the puffy chicken tinga and tasty basterd. Also  it is open 24 hours so that is awesome. I definitely recommend going here  You will not be disappointed  The parking can be a little tough depending on how busy it is though.
Tyson's Tacos,86,Their tacos are so good  I had the crispy duck and burnt ends and loved them both. Cute and laid back atmosphere 
Tyson's Tacos,87,I agree that the size of the taco is really small for the price. However  the queso is delicious and most of the tacos I ve had so far are yummy with some flavor. Salsas are good. Food comes out pretty quick. Highly recommend the queso  fried egg w brisket taco  it s huge compared to the others and yummy  and the tasty bastard is pretty good along with the el Diablo. All in all  I will keep coming back as it s a pretty good late night taco place. It s just hella pricey for a 3-4 bite taco.
Tyson's Tacos,88,Really good and 24 7  I love it and good vegetarian options. Love going here late at night. Just wish they had heaters.
Tyson's Tacos,89,Great tacos and service. You can play a ukulele and or sing for a free taco  and you can get as many as you want. My favorite taco might be the new scooby  The queso is amazing   B is for bacon is pretty good.  Grime time is super yummy Matadors are really really good.  The al pastor is a great basic taco with lots of flavor.  The crispy duck is so sweet and might be a new favorite  Senior ranger has too much going on. The scooby is good and might be better than the al pastor but similar. The crispy pork belly is amazing
Tyson's Tacos,90,I ve heard about Tyson s for years and I finally got the chance to check it out  They didn t disappoint. Excellent tacos and I really think that everyone should give them a try  They do really pack the tacos  so it s really worth the price  I got 2 to-go and they were bursting out of the tortillas when I opened them.   My only issue is that they were a bit slow with my order. My friend and I placed an online order beforehand and arrived around the time we were told our food would be ready by  and we waited an extra 15 minutes before receiving our food. Aside from the wait time though  I thought this place was great.
Tyson's Tacos,91,The meat was too dry and the tortilla fell apart as soon as you grabbed it. To be honest just go to One Taco and save yourself
Tyson's Tacos,92,This was a fun place to try but I don t think I would return. I ordered carry out  which was a great option  The food kept fairly well too. However  I don t think the flavor or portions are great enough for the price here. - al pastor - lacked flavor overall but it was ok  - brisket taco - flavor was great but brisket was extremely fatty  - tasty bastard - queso and shrimp were awesome together but the steak meat was tough
Tyson's Tacos,93,Amazing  and super generous serving size on the chips and queso. The tacos are super flavorful  they have good options if you re vegetarian  and being open 24 7 made it a great place to stop before we had to leave Austin.  My suggestion is to go with someone  get one taco each  and share chips and queso. Plenty of food  about  25 if you get drinks with it  and it tastes amazing.
Tyson's Tacos,94,I m new to Austin and tonight was my first time getting Tyson s. I was so excited and heard great things about it and I left unsatisfied. The tacos were okay  not worth the price at all  but the customer service was awful. Aurora B. Took my order and she was rude as all get out. She looked at me and talked to me like she hated me. Not to mention she didn t get my order correct. I had to repeat it   and I speak very clearly  so it felt disrespectful and like she was typing my order wrong on purpose. The gentleman that gave me my order was also very rude in our exchange when I showed him my receipt because I didn t receive what I ordered. He acted like it was my fault and that it was inconvenient for him to give me what I ordered. I will not be eating here again or recommending it to anyone. No over priced food is worth a s     experience and absurd wait time. I have worked for many different restaurants in my life and there is no excuse for employees to have attitudes like that especially when expecting a tip.
Tyson's Tacos,95,Tysons was kinda good like two years ago. Now they will just shove large cold chunks of cheese in your tacos. I m not complaining though because it was so funny i burst out laughing when i saw this.  I am complaining bc I asked for corn not wheat tacos though . I think most the employees were laid off during Covid or quit and that s why they re understaffed now.
Tyson's Tacos,96,4.5 For being 24 hours  These tacos are pretty good  You can ask for extra toppings on any taco  I would recommend the   3 taco plate   You get to choose 3 tacos and comes with rice and beans on the side.  My favorite go to is The Avocado Bogado  The Flash  brisket skillet 
Tyson's Tacos,97, Horrible food and dirty kitchen  this place needs to be shut down by the health department   Probably the worst tacos I ve had in Austin.   My fish taco was so bad I had to throw it away. The fish was undercooked and tasted like cleaning chemicals bleach. Not to mention the portions are tiny. The other 2 tacos I had were tiny  greasy and flavorless.   It took nearly 20 minutes for them to make 3 bite size tacos so I didn t bother asking for another.  I took a picture of the kitchen so everyone can see how dirty disgusting it is.  Avoid at all cost 
Tyson's Tacos,98,15 minutes ago I ate some tacos and it was a very good experience. I just arrived in Austin to visit a friend and our first order of business was to get us some tacos. We arrived at Tyson s Tacos at around 11 30PM and the place was pretty. The large menu is posted right in front and features a ton of different options like vegetarian  breakfast  and then just some regular taco options to please any taco fan. I ended up going with a regular crispy taco and the vegetarian taco with potato  I totally forgot the name . How were the tacos  Pretty darn delicious if you ask me. The vegetarian taco was on a soft shell and was my favourite of the two. The crispy beef taco was pretty standard for what it was but also enjoyable. What I liked most about this place was the look of it. Inside this place is filled with bright glowing lights  cool decorations  and did I mention the colorful lights   Overall  Tyson s Tacos was fantastic and a real comfort style place if that makes sense. The food was good  the service was quick  and the place itself was awesome to be at. Big thumbs up too this place 
Tyson's Tacos,99,I hade the crispy duck taco and it was mouth watering. I had to get two more   People who don t like this taco simply don t have a pallet or perhaps caught them on a bad night. This taco hands down was one of the best I ve ever had and trust me I take my tacos seriously. Definitely should give it a try.
Tyson's Tacos,100,Queso was amazing  So worth it and should definitely get it each time. Tacos were unique and flavorful  love the different fusions takes. However  we came on a weekday night and it took us two hours for our food because an event happened. Would recommend ordering online prior to coming
Tyson's Tacos,101,These tacos were such a great lazy Sunday treat. We ordered these tacos for pick-up and had them at a nearby lake for breakfast brunch. The tacos were filled  and delicious  and the salsas were flavorful. They were some of the best tacos I ve had in Austin
Tyson's Tacos,102,I think this place isn t great for vegetarians. Went here at 6pm on a Monday night. I m vegetarian and ordered a taco plate - 2 Yoda tacos and 1 Tre s Garden taco  and I ordered black beans as my side since their rice and refried beans contain meat products. I also requested no mushrooms in the Tre s Garden taco. It took about 20 minutes for the tacos to come out. When I got home with the food  they had given me rice and refried beans as my side and there were mushrooms in the Tre s Garden taco. I was overall disappointed with not following my requests and the taste of their tacos was average.  Also  my boyfriend ordered three different meat tacos and about 30 minutes after he finished eating he felt sick  nausea vomiting  diarrhea  stomach upset  so I m suspecting one or more of his tacos contained spoiled meat.
Tyson's Tacos,103,Ate here last week for the first time in a couple of years. I got two tacos and a cup of water and the total was  14 with tip. The tacos were average and quite small and did not fill me up. I generally like the feel of this place even though it s outdoor seating only and I was sweating my ass off. And I know restaurants are strapped right now with the cost of food and labor but I can t help but feel like this place just does not provide good value for the price.
Tyson's Tacos,104,A hole in a wall .. hidden gem   What a cool joint to hang out at anytime   Late night hunger taken care - they are open 24 7    Nothing fancy  but a patio converted into beautiful place   A shed converted in a cool eating joint. At night the shiny lights and pretty decore look amazing   Their Tacos are great and queso is on point and they are cheap   Love the salsa .. specially if you like spicy - try their verde sauce its amazing   They have so much to try on their menu and everything has a distinct taste. The atmosphere here is open and free. The patio seating is clean.. The staff is nice and it feel so good - like a little spot away from your busy life  I went at around midnight . Guess if you are open to trying stuff they definitely won t dissapoint .  I can say this place truly a hit spot and you cannot go wrong    Self service and good parking space   depending what time of the day or night you are going 
Tyson's Tacos,105,The day was hot and muggy and having read about Tyson s Taco we decided to try it. The jack hammer sounds was playing in the background on Airport Blvd. No more pigs with wings from an old picture on line  steady stream of customers after 1 30 PM.  We ordered at the window  an order of Nachos please   and two  3 Tacos Plates   with drinks  oh and an order of  Nachos.  The lady with the tight pulled back hair staff member said   I got your nachos.  Oh  I did say   Nachos   sorry about that I didn t remember. I wanted my mom and son to try the Nachos since I read they were good.  So the receipt printed out and we didn t read it  until our food was called out from the side window by another male staff. No nachos .  We sat close to the back of the porch  no indoor seating that we can tell. A large and red smoker grill sat by itself next to the porch visited frequently by birds. We decided to move to under the fan since the couple finished their food. There were some food stains on the long aqua table so I used the roll of brown paper towel and Fabuloso purple spray and light yellow spray to wipe up the spot. We saw room temperature sliced lemons and cucumbers infused water containers perched at the front. Our Yoda  Rage with Chicken Tinga  Tre s Garden with Beef Fajitas came out with the sides of refried and seasoned rice. The other tacos we ordered were Princess Leia  White Girl   Puffy Chicken Tinga  and Brisket Taco with the same sides. The food items were tasty  meats were tender  some potato cubes were undercooked. Black beans were good. Flour tortillas were good  red and green salsas were delicious and spicy .   Our drinks were Small sizes of  Dirty Horchata   just-the-right-level-right-sweet and a shot of expressio  and Fresh Lemonade and Tropicana  Or Minute Maid   only available bottled orange juice from concentrate.  Refreshing for a hot day. Maybe the heat is affecting people s ability to concentrate  staffs  because it was kind of hard to enjoy the food  customers  and we didn t even stood up to order the missing item.  Overall  I have mixed feelings maybe we ll come back  but first impressions in the Austin food business is a good measuring stick of recommendations that one would share with their family members and friends. My mom liked it that Tyson s is 24 7 so she can take her clients here so maybe there will be better overall experience next time.
Tyson's Tacos,106,Came today and super disappointed... came with friends who knew the owner. Ordered the three tacos with rice and beans plate. Was given potatoes instead of rice. When asked they said we have no rice. So why are you selling this as a plate    I don t like breakfast potatoes and was excited to try the rice. The tacos were meh 
Tyson's Tacos,107,I was super excited to try this place but ended up being disappointed. 3 of the tacos we wanted to try on the menu were sold out  it was 9pm on a Friday night  and the steak in one of the tacos I got was super tough and pretty unenjoyable. A couple of the other tacos I took bites of were fine but was just a bit bummed about the experience overall. Would prob give it another chance but I had better luck with food elsewhere in Austin.
Tyson's Tacos,108,So-so tacos in a dirty spot made for a three star affair for me. I met a friend at Tyson s  and I was excited to try out a new taco place. It was a little cold  so I give them credit for putting up some plastic around the seating and having heat lamps.   First the tacos  with so many great places around  you d better bring your A game to an ATX taco fight. Tyson s did not - solid B minus tacos. I had a brisket taco  and all I could think about was how great Valentina s brisket taco is. Tyson s had cilantro  pickled onions  avocado  and chunks of  not shredded  brisket. Disappointing. It s like the Pluto of tacos - at one time maybe it was considered a bona fide taco  but based on new information  the deliciousness of Valentina s  it had to be downgraded and taken off the list. I also had a taco called the Flash  and it had skirt steak  sausage - maybe another meat - and Sriracha. It was weird  and not in a good way. Not very tasty  and odd consistency. I would not do either taco again.   Now the place. As others have pointed out  it is overrun with birds  and it s not very clean. No bird actually came on to our table  but they were all around. At one point something fell from the ceiling on to our table  thankfully not bird poop  . I looked up and then saw the filthiest fan I ve ever seen. Really made me lose my appetite. They need to clean the place up.    I would not do it again - so many great taco choices out there.
Tyson's Tacos,109,It just wasn t good. Waited way too long   overpriced  and tacos were not tasty. I normally don t leave reviews like this but it was bad.
Tyson's Tacos,110,Super hard to believe this place has 4 stars. Like impossibly so in a city where Vera Cruz is less than a mile away. Passable I guess if you re wasted with no options but the tacos are peak average at best
Tyson's Tacos,111,A 24hr taco stand  man I wish we had one of those in NOLA. This was my go-to breakfast taco spot in Austin. Breakfast tacos are a big thing in central Texas and these were excellent. They also specialize in great horchata and hibiscus tea. Another great Austin find.
Tyson's Tacos,112,Great spot still  but wish they kept some of the character of the old decorations aesthetic  flying pigs  -- it s a bit bland sterile now. Tacos are still good though 
Tyson's Tacos,113,I would easily give this spot more than 5 stars if I could. So many flavor options - breakfast  beef  chicken  duck  shrimp  EVERYTHING  Got the platter for  12  which is a good deal if you pick the more expensive tacos bc you get 3 tacos   rice and beans . Perfect quantity for one person meal to feel full but not too full. My favorites were the basterd  crispy duck  and barbacoa. I will say  they don t travel well  they get cold quick  so either reheat them or eat them soon after getting them. Definitely coming back here   
Tyson's Tacos,114,Torchy s was closed by the time we got into town a couple of weekends ago during our trip to Austin. The bf and I were hungry  so we decided to stop by here as it happened to be be open 24 hours a day. We got here at around 11 00PM on a Friday night  and while it wasn t absolutely packed  there was a steady line for the entire duration of our meal here.   I decided to get the Princess Leia and the Val s Classic Migas  while the bf got the Al Pastor  the Burnt Ends  and the brisket. It can be a little hard to hear your name when your order is ready  but besides that  we thought all of our tacos were amazing. Mine were a bit on the simpler side  looks like all of the vegetarian options are on the breakfast menu   but they were very tasty. The bf also loved all 3 of his tacos  especially the Burnt Ends taco  which he said was a great mix of Tex-Mex with Texas style bbq. The salsas they had were also quite tasty  and if I ever happened to be in this part of Austin again  I would definitely return.
Tyson's Tacos,115,Don t get their chicken fajita tacos  unless you like bland  rubbery  dry pieces of chicken and unseasoned bell peppers and onions and watery salsa.  I ve had their breakfast tacos in the past and remember them being really good  so I thought I would try their regular tacos. Perhaps I made the wrong menu choice  but really  how hard is it to mess up fajitas in Texas   At least some salt  plz   The only redeeming thing was their homemade corn tortillas.  I won t be going back here or recommending this place to anyone. Their business was brisk  however  so maybe I m missing something 
Tyson's Tacos,116,So. These guys just became my favorite taco place in Austin. Every single taco I ordered had amazing flavors
Tyson's Tacos,117,First time trying Tyson s Tacos and they were so good    Definitely top on Taco Places in Austin. I ordered the 3 taco plate which I think was a pretty good deal. They ran out of Crispy Pork Belly unfortunately but I ordered the King George  Crispy Duck  and Al Pastor and all of them were amazing. The Crispy Duck definitely has a hint of asian flavor  the crispy avocado   spicy mayo in the King George is perfect  and you can t go wrong with an Al Pastor. The sides of beans and rice were good too. Really good  I ll definitely be back for more 
Tyson's Tacos,118,Fried egg and brisket taco changed my life. Horchata is also awesome. Can t go wrong.
Tyson's Tacos,119,I wanted so badly to like this place but unfortunately its mediocre with tiny portions  see attached pic   I waited 40mins for my order with 4 people in front of me  and it was way over priced   The ambiance is very Austin and decent but it s made for drunk college kids who don t know any better.  I was in Austin working and had a night off.  Decided to try Tyson s at 2am and was excited about it...  I ordered 6 tacos and chips and salsa with the idea to eat 2-3 tacos and save the other tacos for lunch the next night.  I spent  51.42 and anticipated decent sized tacos.  The tacos are PITIFULLY SMALL   In the pic the salsa is the size of a jello shot for reference.
Tyson's Tacos,120,I live around the corner from Tyson s and have been coming here for several years. Tyson s used to be one of my favorite spots in Austin. I don t know what happened  but Tyson s is awful now. Not sure if they got a new cook but there is no consistency in how they make their tacos  and they taste old. Don t bother calling to place an order because they won t answer the phone  and they admit that .  Last time I went there they were out of 70  of their menu. On sad to say  this place is a waste of time. I used to come here 4-5 times a week but not any more. Won t be coming back to Tyson s.
Tyson's Tacos,121,This place serves 24 hours and was suggested to me by a local follower of my Instagram blog  theVeggieConsultant. There was a long queue outside the place which shows how famous the place was. We ordered tacos  I got all 3 veggie tacos on the menu and waited for the order to be prepared. We had to wait at least 50 mins before we got our order of 5 tacos. I thought this was a really long wait for tacos. I asked for some extra sauce and was denied  they said one sauce per taco and gave me 3 green and 2 red ones  for additional sauce I had to go back and order as sides which was weird. The tacos did taste awesome once we reached back home  I d surely recommend the place if there is a shorter wait  it s a good place but not for an hour long wait. I d rather pickup quick orders from the other my fav taco places.
Tyson's Tacos,122,I went this morning around 8 45. I liked the patio seating. It was all patio seating. You order at the window and are given a number. When your order is ready  they will call your number at the window. I ordered bacon and egg  and an al pastor. The pastor was very dry  almost jerky like. It was also served on flour  which I thought was weird. The bacon and egg was fantastic. I m going to try it again another day since it s walking distance from my house.
Tyson's Tacos,123,Good food. Not so good service. I ordered online and the website said ready at 12 15am. I arrive at 12 10am. They were supposed to text me. At 12 30am after no text I got in line. After additional 10 minutes in line I get to the window and I m told I was in the wrong line. Go to side window. I go there and wait and additional 5 minutes while watching the guy bagging food but not checking on the people by the window. Finally he checks and I ask for my food. It was already bagged and sitting among many other bags. It obviously had been ready for awhile. They shouldn t have online ordering without much better service for pickups. I never received a text.
Tyson's Tacos,124,I had high hopes. I specifically went to Tyson s because they had vegan options. I ordered two tacos on corn tortillas and a lemonade. My first taco was called Tre s Garden and the other was a build your own with vegan chorizo  potatoes and grilled onions and peppers. Both tacos came on flour. I asked for corn but thought...ok...no problem..I ll eat the flour. The wait time was long so I didn t want to take the tacos back. I ate the Tre s taco first. I can say with all honesty  this was not a tasty taco. I opened the second taco it was also on flour. It was truly THE worst taco I ve had. The vegan chorizo was burned...not just toasted...it was burned. See picture. It boggles my mind that the person that made my taco thought it was okay that the main ingredient was burned. I m talking crunchy burned...hard to chew burned..It wasn t edible. I threw it out.   My friend who is not vegan or vegetarian ordered nachos. We ordered separately. When she got her nachos there was no cheese on them...not a shred in sight. Again...they were busy...we both agreed to suck it up because it took over 10 minutes to get chopped onions when my friend asked for them when she received her meal. For  10 and a tip I expect two-taco perfection. There was none to be had. The best thing about the meal was the lemonade. We both agreed a review was in order.   The first photo is my friend s cheese-less nachos. The second is my burned vegan chorizo.   Tyson s won t be an option again.
Tyson's Tacos,125,I didn t see the appeal of the place and the food other than the aspect of it being open all of the time. The wait for the food took nearly half a hour  The food was mediocre at best. The location has easy parking though and like I said  I think it s a decent place to go to since it s always open. I ve had better tacos in the area. They were also out of the first few items that we wanted when we went.
Tyson's Tacos,126,Pros  -Legit delicious tacos -Perfectly spiced salsas -Fun ambience   Cons  Hard to find any cons really  but if I had to fault them  I d say they could improve their beer selection. This may be a result of covid  so I didn t remove a star for it.
Tyson's Tacos,127,I had the fiery shrimp taco. It was delicious. Very spicy. I added guacamole and potatoes and eliminated the cheese and cilantro. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I d be back 
Tyson's Tacos,128,I have a low rating when I heard his  alleged  political bent... but the tacos are  in my opinion  better than Torchys.... so they re better than v  damned good      I HAD TO COME BACK.   Favorites are Al Pastor  amp  LA Chona.... but i haven t had one I didn t like.   We ll agree to disagree if he s a Trumper.... as long as he keeps pumping out the TASTY TACOS    AND try the  dirty horchata  
Tyson's Tacos,129,I ve lived in Austin for four years for school but never heard about this place... not until I went back to Austin recently that someone recommended this place.   And wow... I ve been missing out    They have such interesting tacos  I wanted to get the duck taco but they had ran out around lunch. My guess is that one is a popular one - so come early  My friend got the crispy pork belly and the Tasty Basterd. I got the diablo shrimp and la Chona. I was having such a difficult time picking what tacos I want because they all sound amazing and unique.   The crispy pork belly was life changing for my friend. You don t get to try this kind of taco anywhere else   And that s the same with a lot of the tacos here... very interesting    I would totally recommend eating here. Definitely going to come back next time I visit Austin   Tip  they do have outdoor seating so I felt safe just dining there but I see a lot of people doing takeouts also.
Tyson's Tacos,130,Driving around after 9pm in search of food  Everything seems to be closed  Not Tyson s Tacos  which is open 24 7. Even if you aren t looking for a late night eat you have to give this place a try. Even late at night  this place is super packed  which is how you know it s a gem. I just wanted to play it covid-safe and order online for takeout.   First of all  this place has such an interesting variety of tacos to try   From Al Pastor and Barbacoa to a few more interesting flavors like Crispy Duck and shrimp. I had the Al Pastor  Crispy Duck  and shrimp tacos on corn tortillas for the three-taco plate meal  which comes with rice and beans .   The Al Pastor tacos had pineapple chunks  which I enjoyed as it isn t typical of taco places where Al Pastor is offered to have pineapple  The shrimp tacos were probably the  lightest  option I had. I spiced it up with the green sauce that comes with all the taco meals...but that ish is SPICY. I can handle spicy food well but their green sauce is something else. My favorite taco was the Crispy Duck  so full of flavor and not too greasy. This is definitely a 10 10 meal.   Ordering online for takeout was super easy too  and the order was ready at the exact time the website said it d be ready   Parking situation  on-site
Tyson's Tacos,131,Came in at 2 18 and ordered my tacos. A.M. mind you. Didn t get them until 3 14 A.M. I ordered one taco. I mean the taco was alright I guess.   One star for the setting because it was cool.   One star for the tacos because they were alright I guess.
Tyson's Tacos,132,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER... LITERALLY        Would give 0or negative stars if I could   Vegetarians BEWARE- Hindus  Muslims  amp  Buddhists too   I ordered 2 create-your-own tacos tonight  as I have about a million times before  because this WAS my favorite taco spot in Austin . I got black beans  EXTRA cheese  amp  fresh jalape os  another fail was that they barely put any freaking cheese on them   If you re gunna charge ppl for extra anything  then GIVE IT TO THEM  So  after eating one taco  I find two giant chunks of some fajita steak bs while starting on the 2nd       I m sure the workers don t care and more than likely one of them saw that crap in my tacos as they were making it  but didn t care enough to do anything. So I d advise you to not even go here if you re vegetarian or part of your religion is you can t have a certain meat etc. I m beyond pissed  I give y all 0 stars now    This is just sooo WRONG  I want a refund... and my tip back  -- at Tyson s Tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,133,Just found a hair nestled in my Barbacoa taco. Pretty disgusting. I generally like this place and stop by when I get my oil changed next door but never coming back.
Tyson's Tacos,134,The ONLY problem I have with this place is that it s purely outdoor seating. Not that I mind the 100  degree weather in Texas  jk I hate it   despite huge ceiling fans blowing water mist in your face  but more disgusted with all the crows hopping around the pick up area and trash cans. There is no mesh or tarp wrapping around the covered patio area  so they fly in and out as they please. These crows got some balls too because they will simply take a small hop aside when you pick up your tacos  then hop right back in to pick at the mouth of the sauce jug and whatever fell off your tray. Needless to say I didn t touch that sauce. Sanitary concerns aside  tacos were good  but I wasn t really feeling the mandarins with my pork belly. The crispy duck was pretty much fashioned after the Peking Duck  with cucumbers and hoisin sauce.    232
Tyson's Tacos,135,LOUSY     Visiting from out of town. Ordered from hotel. Order arrived but was incomplete. They refused to correct the problem. Manager didn t even try. No refund either  TACOS WERE NOT GOOD. Do not recommend. Much better places in town. What a waste   
Tyson's Tacos,136,Got the chicken tinga and duck tacos and while I think they re fairly priced they really weren t all that great.
Tyson's Tacos,137,This is my go-to 24 hr take out in Austin  Delicious tacos  queso  beer cider and great Austin vibes
Tyson's Tacos,138,Why don t we have one if these in Houston    This place us reminiscent if Torchys Tacos   ut completely different at the same time.  Found this gem via Google on the  late night munchie   ride from hanging out in 6th street.. I was a little upset they were out of brisket though.  The surf n turf taco have shrimp  and hearty cuts of ribeye...  the al pastor rib meat was .. I was trying to be different and the duck taco   why did i do that  .. Needles to say  that one didn t get finished.. At 2 30am  their business didn t seem to slow down.. I m definitely coming back when in Austin  
Tyson's Tacos,139,A 24-hr taco joint off the frontage road close to a major highway  not that brightly lit except for the piggy lanterns hoisted on top of the roof that made the restaurant suspiciously Chinese. I ll have to bitter-sweetly report that my friend who took us here was right  when you can have delicious  ass  tacos like the ones at Tyson s  no need to look for Chinese food...  The entire establishment was dimly lit  perhaps so guests can enjoy the neon-galaxy painting of the ceiling  and before long  you can t help but notice all the exotic plants surrounding you.  We didn t start of the greatest - they wouldn t let us redeem the Yelp check-in offer  claiming the manager wasn t around to do it. Well if you re open 24 hours  shouldn t there be 3 managers on site  Also  they were out of the top 2 meats on our list to try. What s cool  I noticed  are the lime and lemon water dispensers next to the register  guests can help themselves out to their hearts  content.   I thought the 3-tacos platter was pretty worthy  until I saw how big the portions are. Woah  it s definitely cheaper than any I ve had in Denver. So much meat filled each taco and the shrimps are pretty good in size as well. The flavors were phenomenal. I knew because my husband and I shared one 3-tacos platter since I didn t have an appetite. That says a lot if I still thought the tacos tasted amazing. Even the beans and rice were full of flavor  or seasoning  but whatever  I didn t care .   Service was as streamlined as any 24-hr operations. I m so glad we checked this out  I sent all my friends back home a picture of the  wish you were here  sign. Great tacos  affordable as hell  not pretentious  and so easy. Thank you  Tyson s 
Tyson's Tacos,140,Most of the time if you re calling or picking up for after hours food you ll have to wait a longggg time in line or call 30  times but I am willing to do it not bc the customer service but bc of the food quality and the hours. Love hate relationship with Tyson s 
Tyson's Tacos,141, Success  has ruined this once great 24-hr taco joint. The last 9 times I ve been here after 9pm  old habits die hard  they have been sold out of at least 4 different types of their best tacos. Do they post that on the huge outdoor menu  Nope. You stand in line staring at the menu  choosing your options  only to get to the window where you are told   nope  outta that . How about Pork Belly  Nope. Burnt Ends Brisket  No. Crispy Duck  Nope. Crispy Tacos  Gee sorry.  Then you re compelled to ask  well  what DO you have  Then they treat you like you have a problem   Everything else   that you don t want . I wouldn t complain if this didn t happen every single time. So if you go to Tyson s  only go during the day - since whoever does the ordering obviously doesn t order enough to last past 6pm.  And Tyson s - when you habitually run out of your most popular tacos  note it on the menu instead of having everyone stand there  make choices and the poor cashier has to delver the same story over  and over  and over all night - as this is not a habitual  chronic issue. Which it certainly is.
Tyson's Tacos,142,Best late night taco decision I ve ever made   The grilled chicken was seasoned to perfection and falling out of the taco.  The Diablo shrimp was   but not overbearing.  I will be ordering again.
Tyson's Tacos,143,We can give the award of worst customer service to tyson tacos  counter people with ugly attitude and cannot smile to save there life. I don t even care for great customer service  just be a decent human being and I wont complain. Now the reason I was compelled to write this review is my experience at this place. Came in and ordered 3 taco plate  since I dont eat pork I asked the counter girl if Refried beans have pork. She says no and I confirm again to make sure she understood  I was kind of doubtful still. I ordered and waited for my food.   When my food came  just to make sure I asked the lady in pick up window if Refried beans have pork. She says yeah it does  The stupid counter girl was standing there looking at her phone  I said you know I asked her twice  serving lady says something to her in Spanish. I say to the counter girl didn t I ask you twice if they have pork  She literally looked back at me and turned around and ignored and got back to her phone. No acknowledgement and no apologies.  Such is the attitude of people working here. I will not set foot in this ugly atmosphere again.
Tyson's Tacos,144,Tyson s reminds me of what Austin is supposed to be about. 24.7 Tacos  My favorites are the duck and shrimp taco. Minimal seating so be prepared to fight for a table.
Tyson's Tacos,145,Very bland tacos. Definitely would not recommend this place. We were very disappointed with the flavors. I gave it a 1 star for the lemonade which was the only thing we enjoyed.
Tyson's Tacos,146,I ordered two bacon egg and cheese breakfast tacos through Uber eats  and they sent me two tortillas filled with refried beans only
Tyson's Tacos,147,I was initially super impressed by the variety and how fun the decor of the restaurant was  but the food was super meh and definitely left something to be desired.  We got the chips and queso  wild feminist  diablo shrimp  al pastor  and spicy brisket tacos. Chips and queso were the highlight of the meal  but still couldn t compare to Torchy s for me -- needed more salt and flavor complexity. Tacos were really  really sad. The Diablo shrimp was alright  with pretty good flavor  but the ingredients didn t really complement each other well. Not sure how to describe it but something was off. I took two bites of the wild feminist and didn t touch it again  was not a fan of the lack of flavors -- super boring. My boyfriend s al pastor was cold and tasted stale and like it had been sitting out.  Tacos aren t exactly super cheap here  but service was fast  efficient  and friendly. Probably won t be back just because flavors were really missing and there s so many other options in Austin that are better and cheaper.
Tyson's Tacos,148,This place has really gone down the shitter. I used to be able to walk up to the window and place an order and be out in less than 20 minutes. Now  I put in an order online 30 minutes in advance and show up 15 minutes late and I still sit there for for another 20 minutes waiting on food. They don t staff properly  their food is mediocre  and their cleanliness level is essentially non-existent. At one point in time Tyson s did quick tacos right. Sadly  I will probably never go here again. Before it was purely out of convenience  not quality. Now it has nothing to offer.
Tyson's Tacos,149,Drive-in taco spot that s open ALL DAY ALL NIGHT  What  Yes.  Came through with a few friends who are also taco connoisseurs after a fun night of playing arcade games at a nearby brewery. We came from East Austin area  and loved that Tyson s was a mere drive away. The setup is pretty easy--right next to Mrs. Johnson s Donuts and classically under a transparent tarp to shield customers from rain. HOWEVER  this does not keep you safe from the frigid cold during the winter--so the three of us and all the other diners basically were shivering while we ate. No biggie  just uncomfortable. They have their own customized Mexican candles at each table which made our winter visit more special.   Let s talk tacos. Their menu is easy to read and in large font  so while you re waiting in line you make your decisions. I usually ask for corn  when prompted  but the sweet man at the cashier didn t ask so I ended up with flour. As a pescatarian  I was psyched to see seafood options and some veggie ones too. Although it seems like they re famous for their meat tacos  GET THE DIABLO. Their shrimp is very flavorful and juicy  and that was definitely my favorite. I also ordered The Hank  which is a breakfast veggie chorizo taco. The soyrizo was not great  and a little darker and drier than I like it. However  I appreciate having that option on the menu  Be sure to get yourself some of their salsa though--it s on the spicier side  and the flavor keeps your mouth warm in the winter.  Parking is a-plenty late at night  but I can see how parking might get difficult during peak hours. I d recommend stopping by if you re in the area  but for me...it s quite a drive. Plus  there are plenty of great taco spots that are closer to me and the same price. Thanks for the late night munchies Tyson 
Tyson's Tacos,150,Awesome Tacos duh  them shits is gud   Tysons tacos make me feel kinda funny like when I used to climb the robe in gym class.
Tyson's Tacos,151,Best tacos ive ever had and im mexican I think that should say something    will be coming back for more  May need to become a regular customer
Tyson's Tacos,152,The foods good  but if you do an online order they probably won t see it and they ll start it when you get there
Tyson's Tacos,153,24 hour spot  great food  well seasoned   especially for austin   Prices very convenient to the portion of food  Well the Taco Plate.
Tyson's Tacos,154,Someone told me about the burnt ends taco at Tysons.  I d been to Tyson s quite a bit but never tried this taco  and I m a fan of burnt ends.  So in I went  and out I came with the taco I had been seeking.  Succinctly  it s good.  It s different from a typical steak  pork or barbacoa style meat-filled taco  in that the crispiness of the burnt ends give it a texture difference you don t normally find  even with a menu as expansive as Tyson s.  If I get it again  it ll be with some sort of really hot sauce  because hot and crunchy fatty meat seem to go together so well  salt  fat  acid  heat anyone  .  As a bonus  someone had taken up the mandolin challenge  so they were literally singing for their supper - entertaining the crowd and earning a free taco for every song they sang.  The test for this privilege is showing that you can TUNE the mandolin  so only folks that know that instrument should apply.
Tyson's Tacos,155,The food here is good  but what you get are gourmet tacos  not your classic street tacos.   THE COST   7.15 for a taco  horchata  and my share of chips   guac with a group of 7.    Horchata - 3 stars. A bit too sweet      Chips  amp  Guac - 4 stars. Guac was chunky and great  Chips were light.     Crispy Duck Taco - 4 stars. Good  tasty tender meat  but I was basically eating a Peking Duck Wrap. I didn t fill my craving for Mexican food  because I basically wasn t eating Mexican food.
Tyson's Tacos,156,Delicious tacos. Open all day   Delicious horchata.   One downside is the lack of beef tips each time I visit.
Tyson's Tacos,157,Passed by to try it. Especially since they re supposed to be 24 hours. It would be nice to have a place to go for those late night taco cravings. Register girl who took our order was very uninterested. She was more interested in her phone. Ordered 3 tacos. Bastered  surf and turf  shrimp had flavor but beef was just bland. Al Pastor  the pork was like boiled shredded pork  and Barbacoa  which had no flavor at all. But worse of all  the tortillas was store bought and was very chewy. It was like chewing gum and sticks to your teeth. Portions are tiny and not worth the price.
Tyson's Tacos,158,Sometimes absolutely delicious  at other times  lacking substance. Tysons can be a dice roll on quality  but they win the late night local taco game by being open 24 hours. Plus they have dang good  consistent queso and guacamole in a large quantity that keeps me coming back. Rage 2.0 is the most reliable breakfast taco choice in my experience.
Tyson's Tacos,159,Love their Horchata but wish they d give you two tacos instead of one per order because it gets very expensive. One time they didn t even have the duck we ordered. Yes they warn people but they should reduce the price then or update their website so people don t order it.
Tyson's Tacos,160,I m wondering why the man helping at the register decided to substitute pork pibil for my tacos Al Pastor without first inquiring if I wanted that. He told the girl at the register three times that he could make two tacos Al Pastor-- while she is saying that they don t have any left. I m not a tourist. Two stars because it was good and I ate it anyway  two stars because I don t appreciate the dishonesty.
Tyson's Tacos,161,We came to Tyson s Tacos after seeing it on a friends page. I got the Rage 2.0 and Matador on corn tortilla with chips and guacamole. Corn tortillas were soft and the green sauce was super spicy which was really good. Guacamole needed some salt and pepper. It kinda hard to hear our number being called and there were a lot of birds  but those are the only complaints. Really good taco place for the price if you re wanting to try something new 
Tyson's Tacos,162,The tacos here are decent but not worth the wait. We ordered online and showed up at the designated time to pick up our food. However  they only started preparing our food after we arrived so we had to wait another 30 minutes before it was ready. With so many great taco places available  I am just not willing to wait an hour to get my food.
Tyson's Tacos,163,Well  I may be a little biased when it comes to tacos. I didn t think these tacos were horrible  but they sure weren t worth the price tag. Out of 6 tacos  we only liked two. The prince was my favorite. The raspberry pico and goat cheese were the perfect combination of sweet and savory. The crispy duck taco was the second favorite. The rest of the tacos were just ok. I didn t try the beef fajita meat  but the boyfriend was disappointed. Maybe the tacos would be much better on homemade corn tortillas.  For an appetizer  I had the chips and queso. It was a pretty big order. The cheese was good and warm.  They offer a variety of beers and ciders. Surprisingly  a topo Chico was the same price as a cider beer.  I loved the free infused water. It s perfect for a warm Texas summer night.   seating is open to air. They have a covered patio. Parking is available
Tyson's Tacos,164,Seating is dirty  flies everywhere. Tacos are alright  but nothing special from what I ve had elsewhere.   Extremely offputting from the beginning of coming here. If I got my food to go  I think it might have been alright  but I can t enjoy my food when there are massive flies all over me.   Portions are really big  but the guacamole I ordered had basically no salt. Pretty bland and mediocre.
Tyson's Tacos,165,I think it s only 4 stars because not a lot of places in Austin are open 24 7 and a lot of the people who review this are wasted when they have it
Tyson's Tacos,166,This place used to be the best tacos in all of austin. Unfortunately the original owner is gone and whoever is running it now has retained prices while diminishing portions to 1 4 of the original size. Three taco plate was absolutely tiny and all three tasty bastards had a pitiful amount of brisket and shrimp. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU THINK ITLL BE LIKE IT USED TO. OVERPRICED AND TINY PORTIONS
Tyson's Tacos,167,TYSONS TACOS IS WHERE ITS AT IN AUSTIN WHEN YOU WANT THOSE LATE NIGHT TACOS       i seriously have never had a bad taco when I go and I love the ladies that work there  they are super sweet  And the food is such an affordable price I mean you can t beat it   
Tyson's Tacos,168,Okay so I think tyson s has good tacos  however THE SERVICE AT NIGHT. OH MY GOSH. We ordered at about 8 PM  the online form said 25 minutes  so we went and stopped at HEB and went over there. Easily at least 30 minutes later. We show up and they say oh it ll be another 10 minutes... 15 minutes later  our food wasn t even being made    We were behind two other orders. They rudely offered a refund and we left. No food in hand.  Make sure your online ordering forms reflect accurate time when you re busy  It s not hard
Tyson's Tacos,169,The crispy duck taco changed my life. I take all of my friends here and I always tell them to get the crispy duck taco. When it s 3AM and my friends and I are pulling an all-nighter and starving and there is nobody else for us  Tyson s is there for us. I wouldn t go for their more  traditional  tacos like barbacoa and pastor  although good  but they have unique tacos that are definitely worth trying. You cannot beat the three tacos plate combo  but it s hard to choose just three  Scooby  El Matador  Crispy Duck is my go-to . Their nachos with ground beef is also a very good choice at like  8 for those who aren t taco people but are starving. They also have really good horchata and dirty horchata. Overall  my quality of life has increased ever since I took my first bite of Tyson s.
Tyson's Tacos,170,Some of the best tacos EVER. The  dirty bastard  is an absolutely gem - flavorful shrimp  amp  ribeye in every bite. Reasonable prices and cool vibe too.
Tyson's Tacos,171,It s slick that this place is open 24 7 even during the pandemic. I liked their puffy chicken tinga taco a lot  but the chicken fajita and la chona seemed a bit bland.
Tyson's Tacos,172,Welcome to the land of Austin restaurants that don t give a shit. The list is short but does stink. Besides all of the Satanic posters all over the wall advertising Satanic shows and concerts  the service here is deplorable. Nice blaring satanic music too BTW.  I come because who cares about all of that propaganda  they USUALLY have good tacos.  I m used to the service here.  Try getting a smile in the morning out of one of the  ladies  greeting you. I m checking my food for rat poison. They re happy to flip around the tip pad  and expect that without giving you a smile a greeting or thank you they should get a tip   Two days in a row two different  ladies  with the same exact crap attitude  Oh and forget trying to call in an order ha ha they are  too busy.   However when you arrive there s no one there.  So yesterday despite the crappy service I really enjoyed my chicken Tinga taco....I had to wait about 20 to 30 minutes even though no one mentioned this  but boy was it worth the wait  crispy puffy and delicious  Today  the taco arrived quickly. I still trusted in the quality so I drove on down the road. 10 minutes later I opened the foil  should a crispy puffy taco be in foil or a box   to find a soggy greasy oil-soaked mess      Talk about  9 of nastiness   Totally inedible.  So I call.  It rings 100 times.  Wow  some  lady  picks up.  Inaudible.  Hi  may I please speak to your manager   No.  No   There s no manager.  You don t have a manager  no one is in charge   No.  Well let me tell you about the service and the taco.  Nothing Nothing Nothing  Talking to someone in the background in your ear. Nothing.  Call back later........  Good Saturday to you too.   Wow.  Good luck with this  place....good bye class  caring  giving good service  goodbye having to earn your tip or demonstrating that you WANT people to come back    All a figment of the past...at THIS PLACE    What s tragic is there will be no reply to this.  No one DOES care.  No one will call me.  WHY   Because she ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO TAKE MY NUMBER...  I asked  begged  several times.  What s more tragic is that my company buys large amounts of tacos EVERY WEEK -  and we re not going to any more.  But who cares   
Tyson's Tacos,173,In all honesty  if you re looking for decent gentrified tacos  Tacodeli is a much better taco stop than Tyson s will ever be. As if their unflavored meat  unclean kitchen  and unmemorable tacos aren t bad enough  the employees that work there are absolutely intolerable. If it was possible to give negative stars to a place  this would be the first time in my entire life that I would. This is a restaurant that has completely forgotten about the quality of service and seems to think that openly mocking its customers  who are the only people supporting it in the midst of a pandemic  is acceptable behavior for any establishment.   I ve never had a problem with people disliking me or insulting me  but it becomes an issue when they do it openly and proudly in my face because they think I can t understand the language they re speaking in. I ve also never had an issue with employees making faces at me either  because at the end of the day  I like to understand that we all have bad days and aren t always as nice as we d like to be. However  for the employees at Tyson s to laugh at me when I came to pick up my food and call me a f ggot fudgepacker in Spanish  which is a very offensive and bigoted term  and sling numerous other insults at me because I asked for some more sauce  I m a sauce guy  what can I say   is ridiculous.   I took the high road and pretended I couldn t understand them because I didn t want to engage  but why  as a customer  was I even put in a position to do that  Why does this place hire bigots and how has it become acceptable for employees to cross a line and without prompting insult their customers right in front of them  I m lucky I ve learned Spanish  but I can t imagine how many other times they ve done this to their customers without ever getting caught. If their tacos were decent  that would be one thing  but their tacos are dry  unflavored  and made in one of the least sanitary kitchens I ve seen.   If you re looking for good tacos from service workers who have the decency to treat their customers like humans and not target members of the LGBTQ  community with bigoted insults in 2020  in an already divisive climate   Tacodeli  Las Truncas  or the hole in the wall taco stop right along 35 are all great options. I m never stepping foot in this restaurant again  and I will tell everyone I can about their intolerance for LGBTQ  members  I frankly wouldn t feel safe eating here or bringing my friends to eat here again in their homophobic and bigoted climate.  Literally anywhere but Tyson s  is going to be my new motto when it comes to getting tacos or recommending places to my friends out of town. However  if you re in the mood to be targeted and mocked for supporting an establishment during this time  Tyson s might be for you 
Tyson's Tacos,174,Went there for the first time today  and the food was great  and the service was good as well. The only minor...minor....MINOR...issues are I asked for 2 Al Pastor tacos  and 1 B is For Bacon taco  don t judge me   and they came labeled as Barbacoa. lol. The only other frustrating thing was that the pick-up window was obvious  but there was a sign the read  order around the corner  so I ended up walking all the way around the shack until I realize  around the corner  we just the  front  of the place. Could have just said  order to the right  or order that way with an arrow  but  around the corner  makes it sound like you have to go on a little walk....not just take three steps to the right. lol.   But anyway...the food was really good  and it was near where I live  so I ll definitely be back...and know to not walk all the way around the building and don t worry about what the labels read...so long as the contents are tasty. lol.
Tyson's Tacos,175,Probably the worst pastor I ve had in Austin  if you would even call it that. The consistency was mushy like pulled chicken and had absolutely no flavor reminiscent of the adobado pork marinade. I won t even get into the brown old pineapple chunks added. As if that wasn t bad enough the Diablo shrimp taco is the biggest rip off on the menu. The taco is literally  5.40 and you get three of the tiniest shrimp on a soggy tortilla. But the brisket was good so I guess I ll give em that. I don t really write reviews but the shrimp and pastor taco are an absolute joke. Bruh I should dispute the charges on the pastor taco cause whatever they gave me was not a pastor taco
Tyson's Tacos,176,I love this place  They have one of the best tacos in Austin. There is a pretty large variety of tacos on their menu. I would recommend getting a taco plate  which lets you choose any 3 tacos on the menu and includes beans and rice. It s a much better deal than individually ordering the tacos and you can definitely get your money s worth here. This place is similar to Torchy s Tacos just way better and with more variety.   The taco on the top is the Queen Barret breakfast taco and it s pretty good. On the taco plate  the one of the left is the Senor Ranger fajita taco. This was my least favorite and I probably wouldn t order it again. The middle one was the Crispy Duck  which was AMAZING  It s like Peking duck on a tortilla. If you re used to authentic Chinese food  you won t be disappointed  The one on the right is the Avocado Abogado  which is my FAVORITE breakfast taco that I ve tried from here.   The beans and rice were ok. The beans had a little kick to them and had a smokey flavor.   We enjoyed the tacos so much we ordered another plate with 2 crispy duck and 1 avocado abogado. And another queen barret on the side since it s a good deal.   I love how it s open 24 7 and their service is great. I also checked in and got a free ice tea which is really large. I d highly recommend going for tacos 
Tyson's Tacos,177,How can this place serve Mexican food but they don t wanna serve Mexican people. My friend and I waited 20 min in line and as soon as we get to the window the guy doesn t even greet us and slams the window shut basically in our faces. We then wait a few mins and knock on the window he rudely answers and In the rudest way says to hold on  No greeting at all again. If your brown you may want to think twice about eating here. What a shame 
Tyson's Tacos,178,The best scenario is at 4 am and you pull up to tyson s  get 3 or 4 tacos. The tacos here are really good and the vibe is super chill.
Tyson's Tacos,179,Honestly it s hit or miss. Depending on the time you go and how busy they are hugely impacts the food. The fried egg and brisket is pretty good..let me elaborate  the brisket is cooked perfectly  very tender and tasty but the egg is supposed to be fried and left somewhat runny but it very rarely is but when it is it s amazing. I ve had this taco 3-4x in the past couple weeks and the presentation is always sucky which doesn t matter because it s going to be chewed up anyway but after waiting 30-45 mins for a 4 taco order you d expect a little more. Personally I suggest adding cheese  that puts it over the top. I ve also tried the avocado abogado which was good the first time the 2nd time not so much. The meat was tough and flavorless and the b is for bacon is good but whether it s double is questionable.
Tyson's Tacos,180,I love the atmosphere here. Completely outdoor setup  but good structure over the head. Lots of quirky stained glass  rusty paneling  and gardening foliage. Don t be surprised if birds come and try to pick food from your plate.   The puffy chicken Tinga is fantastic  although o can t help feeling they make inferior puffy tacos to San Antonio. Not that the taco was bad  but it could have been pudgier IMO. The indie though is creamy  script  fresh magic. This gets messy  but it s like sloppy sex you mind cleaning up afterwards. The tinga is moist  well spiced  and has its vegetable marinade counterparts bowing in the back for their credit. The green sauce here is bomb. Fresh  green  and has a delightful kick that s stronger than you think  but nothing daunting.  The rage 2.0 is also a sloppy mess  that hits home on a base satisfying level. Cheesy  greasy  meaty  and starchy  yet not the ingredients stand out. At some point  the potatoes to bake at some point  I didn t even taste the onions and bell peppers. Although it feels like a rushed set list for a reunited band  it still strikes plays the right tune for my stomach. I wish the tortilla was toasted  but the doughy blanket does a better job of grabbing the more liquidy aspects of the inside.  This is definitely a hipster taco joint that s worth your time.
Tyson's Tacos,181,Solid B tier taco. The key niche they serve is late night reliability. I think theyre open 24-7. They are decent on value  depending on what you get. Their quality leaves something to be desired compared to other options  but its still above average.  Their breakast tacos are good value and good taste. Its hard to screw up bacon eggs and beans. Migas and ranchero are go to options. Obviously you can get them late night. The brisket is very lack luster though. Hard to compete on brisket in Austin.  Other good options are crispy duck and fried avocado. One thing to note  get flour here. Usually i reccomend corn  but their flavors usually go better with flour. The tacos have different prices. Some are more than 4 dollars. If you get a taco plate they average out plus you get rice and beans.   Im terms of atmosphere  its kind if cool. Just a patio. The seating is all outdoors so dont come midday in the summer. They have water coolers with lemon and lime. I think thats a nice touch.  The sauce game is not exceptional. Theyre tomatillo is pretty spicy so be warned. Use sparingly.  Aside  ive heard the management has some unsavory political views. Not something i care about  but thought i would mention it
Tyson's Tacos,182,my favorite place. always saving the day in the middle of the night with 24hr service  the green sauce is my fav
Tyson's Tacos,183,I like that it s 24 7. After hearing about this place from a few people I finally got myself to go after a late night at work. I got the 3 platter plate  you get to choose any tacos you want from the menu. I got   2  Carne Asadas    1  barbacoa and it comes with rice   beans.  Everything tasted delicious and I will definitely be back to try different tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,184,When I first visited Austin  I was on the hunt for delicious tacos  because where I m from  that s what Austin is known for   and stumbled upon Tyson s Tacos after a quick yelp search. This soon became my barometer for a good taco  e.g.   on a scale from 1 to Tyson s Tacos  where would you rank this taco      This place truly embodies  Keep Austin Weird  with its eccentric decorations. But I always feel like I m on a mini vacation when I make a stop in. The outdoor eating area truly feels like a place you may find on a tropical vacation  only you re in Texas.   My favorite tacos are the diablo shrimp. I swear they keep increasing the heat on these bad boys. Even my boyfriend  a heat daredevil  was wincing a little the last time we stopped in to grab a bite.   My one  concern  is just the level cleanliness of the eating area. I mean it s outdoors  so there are bugs and birds. It s more so a minor inconvenience more than anything. If that bothers you  get your tacos to go 
Tyson's Tacos,185,Amazing breakfast tacos     We tried several different ones and they were all great. The only thing that wasn t that great was the wait - over 45 minutes and when it was ready they didn t even call our number. We went up to ask and they handed it to us. I feel like they need a better system or more staff to accommodate the number of customers. There were some people coming for pick up orders which seemed like a little less of a wait.
Tyson's Tacos,186,I would normally give this place 4-5 stars  but today s order left a bad taste in my mouth. I usually place online orders and have no issues. Today  they forgot my queso  the food was cold  the guacamole was browning  and the chips were stale. I would still forgive this normally  as I usually have a great experience. When I called the store  I was greeted by an employee who obviously did not want to speak to me  followed by another who didn t seem all that worried about fixing my situation. All in all  a very lackluster visit. I m sure I will give them another shot  but not anytime soon.
Tyson's Tacos,187,This place is inconsistent with their food or lack of. Our staff works overnights in emergency surgery and do not have time to go out and retrieve food for ourselves. The first time we ordered we were missing one taco  which is forgivable but tonight we re missing 3 tacos  the nachos look a day old and they were made incorrectly. There s not suppose to be lettuce or guacamole on these nachos and it s missing the sour cream. Definitely going to have to reconsider ordering from this establishment going into the future from our hospital. While others may have the time to try and reconcile this issue  with assignments lined up though the night in the O.R. were just going to have to take a loss. Beware of ordering food in the evening from this establishment.  UPDATE  someone from out staff called to complain and while they did offer to replace our food  they still Incorrectly made the nachos. This evening has been nothing but a comedy of errors from this establishment. Being busy is no excuse for continuous errors and our staff directly talked to the person making our food  Alex.
Tyson's Tacos,188,Love this quirky Austin spot. One of my favorite quick bites before tailgating or game watching. All of their fun taco names live up to the explosive and interesting flavor combinations. I m a sucker for the crispy duck. Not a great option to sit and eat if it s raining or if the outdoor heat will get to you.
Tyson's Tacos,189,Wow how did I miss this place  A tucked away taco stand with a great variety of eclectic choices. Not your typical Tex-Mex tacos  more of a taco fusion of multiple cultures. Came in on a Monday with some friends  the taco stand had a rustic bar like feel. With a steady stream of patrons our order came out pretty quickly. There was the pork belly taco  crispy duck  and the tasty basterd. The other plate had crispy taco and senior rancher. Hint  if you order the 3 taco plate make sure your tacos cost  4 or more for a good value.  Don t forget to check in for a free drink
Tyson's Tacos,190,We loved the tacos- the outdoor seating- the freshly brewed tea- extra lemons  amp  the cool people who also enjoyed tacos for a late lunch.. everyone was extremely friendly to us.. we had our dog with us and chose this spot because it advertised pet friendly   
Tyson's Tacos,191,Tyson s was a hit for my friends and I multiple times during our trip. Luckily they re open 24 7 so we could have both a filling brunch and a tasty snack after a night out.  The tacos do not disappoint in portions and flavor  and a popular taco is the avocado abogado.  Make sure you check-in for a free iced tea   One star down for us wishing that some part of this establishment could be indoors for the AC  but that s out of our control  The fans and mist spray was a bit much  but was very necessary due to the heat.   
Tyson's Tacos,192,First and last time here  Did the online order and will never order anything from here again  I guess it was just my bad luck  but I don t know what the hoopla here is about  I was better off going to Torchy s    I ordered the 3 taco plate for  10.99   12 w tax and online order fee . My food was ready when I got there  but two of ky tacos were a joke    I ordered the MahiMahi  which is the only taco that came as described     but the mahi tasty way to fishy  like it was old  so I ended up tossing it to avoid potential food poisoning.   I had also ordered the Tati  amp  Pants on fire. The Tatis had no avocado  crema  or cojita   It was basically some sad strips of pastor w mostly pico   The Pants on Fire was the saddest of all...no pineapple  just a literal single strip of disgustingly dry overcooked meat that they are trying to pass off as duck  And some black beans w just more pico   I had to call for a refund because I was going to be damned if I was paying a single penny for this crap they are trying to sell as  4 tacos   U can see the pics.  So disappointed because I had only ever heard good things about this place. I didn t even eat the other two tacos since they were just basically flour tortillas and pico. The beans and rice were pretty nasty too.   Never ever again. I wasted my time  money  gas  and am still starving. What a way to make a first impression  
Tyson's Tacos,193,What can I say  this place is as low and dirty as it gets. My brother-in-law  sister  and I are from Dallas and were in Austin for a concert. We had drove from Dallas  same day  attended the Saturday night concert and were ravenously hungry afterwards. We walked a mile to and from the concert in the Texas heat and of course enjoyed the outdoor concert too. After being energy depleted and deciding to drive back to Dallas the same night we definitely needed to make a food fuel stop. By the time we drove from the venue onto the main highway we searched of where we wanted to eat and regrettably and disgustingly chose Tyson s Tacos. As a 24-hour restaurant opened in Austin  I imagined the business being up to par with what s on the menu. Everything was  sold out  and my brother in law was definitely priced gouged for building his own tacos. Mind you  my sister was a UT alumni and raves about how great Austin is and was for it s late night opened food joints. Tyson s is definitely not one the of those. Only the college students of today s world  millennials  hype up what is not worthy at all. I should ve taken a clue when they had satanic stickers and posters plastered on their walls and windows  and next to baby Jesus and the Virgin Mary  Praise Jesus that we did not eat our tacos that were scooped up like animal dung into the pathetic looking tortillas that sat up on top of their counter waiting for the food poison to kick in and for us to finally consume it. But NOT TODAY satan  My bro in law and I sat and watched the whole episode of just that  Our food being grotesquely prepared and just the rude staff sleeping on us. I can confirm that this was all done on purpose too because of asking why we were getting charged for building tacos when they were out of basically every topping. I m not exaggerating  After asking the rude cashier  I STILL tipped 20  and made sure and know that she peeped over and saw that. It still did not fix our worse restaurant nightmare of an experience. My brother in law had asked the rude  jefe  with glasses and backwards baseball cap when our food was going to be ready and said and pointed    37 I think that s our food.  He just slammed the sliding window right  in his face and completely ignored him  It was outright astonishing and appalling  Well after waiting about an hour and seeing our tacos just sitting there and waiting 5-10 more minutes for the guy to redeem himself we decided times up  We got a full refund  explaining the entire situation  and are never returning to hell again. God forgive them  To all who read this review  this is was no joke. It really happened. Also just go take a good look of the photos on here from other people and read the 1 star reviews from others  this place is revolting  in all seriousness. I only mean well  don t risk being food poisoned 
Tyson's Tacos,194,Food is great and affordable great people and a beautiful atmosphere have to go try it out
Tyson's Tacos,195,Tyson s Tacos is an Austin institution and is often recommended as a top location for tacos. My husband and I gave it a try the other night in order to see for ourselves if Tyson s Tacos are indeed as good as they claim.  At 3AM on a Saturday night I expected to find some drunken loudmouths at the taco shop but Tyson s was surprisingly moderately quiet  clean and well tended. Clients had visibly gathered to the taco shop after bar-hopping  but everyone was civil and noise level was moderate.  We ordered five tacos in total  all vegetarian  because that s how we roll . Tyson s tacos are rather traditional in terms of taste and all came in flour tortilla by default. While they tasted slightly better than most  they did not rock my socks. They lacked a little je-ne-sais-quoi that would make them unique  memorable. Except for the flowers laid in the Virgin taco which was a nice touch  everything else was pretty standard  including the sauces.  The tacos by themselves deserve 3 stars.  Where Tyson s shines I found is with its newly extended hours  making it a 24 hour taco shop. Located only a mile away from where I live  it acts as a successful lure for my occasional nightly taco cravings. And for that they deserve one extra star. Their jamaica drink is also fantastic  so much so that I would seriously consider returning for it alone.   In conclusion  Tyson s Tacos offers tacos around the clock at an accessible location in Hyde Park. You can pick from the menu or build your own taco. Prices are affordable and fair and the outdoor patio was mostly clean and welcoming.  My heart still belongs to Torchy s  but should I crave tacos in the middle of the night  I now know where to go.
Tyson's Tacos,196,I had a HORRIBLE experience at Tyson s today. My friend was not allowed service because they thought he was too inebriated to serve him a Lone Star with his meal. He is Iranian and has a thick accent. It was his first time eating there and he was just asking questions about the menu. He was absolutely not drunk. He was denied service and did not get a meal. We tried to talk to the manager  who proved to be a RACIST bigot. They made him feel horrible  they wouldn t serve him  and overall I am completely disgusted with this place and will never come back. There have been rumors running around the city that the owner is a  racist piece of shit.  I didn t want to believe it  but it proved to be true. I am completely HORRIFIED by the behavior I witnessed tonight and I will NEVER eat at Tyson s again. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS RESTAURANT.
Tyson's Tacos,197,Do not come here after 5pm. It s amazing until then. Horrible staff  food subpar  and wait is forever. 45 min for a taco plate is horrible
Tyson's Tacos,198,So been going to the place for almost 6 months and each time is nice Customer service at the front taking the order and receiving the order when it s called by the order number or the name. The menu is very clear in many places to see it in available at. Each time the tacos come out differently in Mount ingredients in Each one is different and not consistent so sometimes I ll have four pieces of potatoes and mostly black beans and five little pieces of cilantro and one piece avocado most of the time there is no extra oil but the last time this week it was 30 minutes Waiting for three tacos And customer service lacked could have been better
Tyson's Tacos,199,Best 4am tacos   nachos and queso I ve ever eating    Will be a new after bar   wake up In the middle of the night whatever spot
Tyson's Tacos,200,Hole in the wall    My kind of place   We drove by looking for a burrito and saw a line outside of this place and stopped in.  So glad we did.  Everything is made to order  so you re going to wait a bit.  Don t worry it s well worth it   We ordered the  scooby  which is a chorizo taco with their spin on it  and the puffy chicken taco tingas.  Couldn t tell you what they put it in it  but  it s wonderful.  The rice and beans have great flavor.   If you re in Austin get yourself in here
Tyson's Tacos,201,I have to stay out of all the times that I have been and given them trial. Different times throughout the year I m getting disappointed each and every time I keep missing the food orders and also it takes them a long time to pick up the phone even if you call them ten times sometimes you miss and hit them on the phone calls hardly ever reach anyone for very long time I feel that Steve you need to take more I guess approach to to go containers little better and to go bags I think that can be improved
Tyson's Tacos,202,I looked past the owner being a racist but WTF why do y all close the online store and not answer my phone calls when I m drunk at 2am    it s really upsetting and I feel like I m being ghosted. Stop being so shady when I just want some tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,203,Sooo I m new to Austin and came from Chicago where our Tacos were pretty amazing. Tyson s was on the top of my bucket list to try. Well this week I was sick so I left work early and I got up super early so I was starving. I decided to head to Tyson s. I originally was going to get some regular Tacos but decided I really wanted to try their Breakfast Tacos so I got three different Tacos to try.  The place to me is in the middle of nowhere  kind of on the side of the road. But  it s 6 minutes from me and open 24 7    No way  The place was so cute. You order at a little window with a huge menu behind you and then go up one step where there s an additional patio with seating and they call your number there. I got 3 Breakfast Tacos and my total was just around  12. Which to me is worth it for Breakfast.  I got   The King George-Migas  Fried Avocado  Bacon  and Creamy Sri Racha. I m not crazy about Bacon but I love Avocado and FRIED AVOCADO    Yess  With the Creamy Sri Racha. This Taco was really really delicious.  Avocado Abogado-Egg  Ribeye  Avocado  and Skillet Potatoes. This was yummy but probably my least favorite. I don t eat steak much and never had steak in Tacos. But I wanted a variety. Still very delicious the steak was just a little chewy and it was the boring Taco out of them all.  Rage 2.0-Egg  Potato  Refried Beans  Bacon  Pepperjack cheese  Saut ed Onions and Peppers  Queso. This was my second favorite. I love Onions and Peppers and I think that combined with the cheesy eggs  bacon  and beans just had a blast of flavors. They also gave me one Red Salsa and one Green I m pretty sure it was Avocado Salsa . I should have grabbed more.  So I LOVED Tyson s and I will be back to review all of the Tacos. So happy Tyson s is right down the street from me.
Tyson's Tacos,204,I ordered the Burnt Ends taco but think I was served the Brisket one instead. Meat was dry and leathery  and the tortillas were bland. Could have used more sauces  herbs  veggies...something to taste it up. Same critique with the chicken fajita taco - pretty basic and not spectacular.  The place itself was a ramshackle food truck patio contraption that obviously was filled with lots of history and love. Not a ton of seating  but high tops and a few other tables you can push together. Wouldn t recommend for large groups or on a hot day. Not clean  and yea  I know it s a food trailer  but still - comparatively speaking  and the food takes a while to come out.   Of all the taco places in this fair land of Austin  I am sad to say Tyson s just doesn t cut it for my tastes.
Tyson's Tacos,205,Being a true  yelper means that you jave to be as real as possible when it comes to posting reviews...With that being said I must tell the truth about this visit.... When I go to a place to eat I at least expect to be able to eat at a clean table without bird s    on the tables and chairs and I wouldn t expect birds to be flying your food while eating... My first visut here was at 2 30 in the morning and maybe that was the reason I thought this place was on point  I had a lot of alcohol in the system .    The brunt end brisket taco were my go to tacos they were really good the first time  not so good on the second go round.. There was nothing hot or warm about the tacos..So I would have to say that my continued business will be slowed because of the inconsistency of the food.
Tyson's Tacos,206,Some of the best tacos in the nation  For the prices  it s a steal  The crispy duck is tender  and has a flavor profile that is slightly Vietnamese. As my new found favorite taco  I m excited to try it again on my next visit. True to Texas taco form  corn or wheat is stuffed full with the good stuff. Don t forget to pair the crispy duck with the green sauce offered at the self service  where you pick up the taco. This is the first duck taco I ve ever had. The menu is broken down between beef  pork  or bird. The chicken tenders taco was slightly too salty  not a show stopper  but all around still awesome.  The best time to visit Tyson s Tacos is at night  since the ceiling is filled with painted cute glow in the dark animals. Though a small seating area  the walls and tables are very artistic. Mostly frequented by locals  I think this establishment should be on the tourist list too. They also have Mexican sodas   Awesome hole in the wall taco spot 
Tyson's Tacos,207,Was very excited for my food and everything looked great  I ordered it through DoorDash and delivery was great.... until I went to eat my taco and use my salsa... there was lonnnggg piece id hair in my salsa. Instantly turned off. I m so sad.
Tyson's Tacos,208,The tacos themselves are decent  and the prices are reasonable. I tried a taco plate with all 3 vegetarian options from the menu  but the rice and beans don t seem vegetarian. I taste either bacon grease or lard in the refried beans.  However  you really should take the tacos to go because the place simply has a bird problem. I sat in the tarped area because of the cold and so did flocks of different types of birds waiting around for scraps and pooping from the ledges onto tables  food  and other customers. I don t know how this passes health code.
Tyson's Tacos,209,A taco shop open 24 7     My friends and I always find ourselves here after studying late at night and it has never been a disappointment    They also have horchata for  3   Yes please.  Outdoor seating but the area is covered so rain won t be a problem 
Tyson's Tacos,210,Food  The mandarin slices elevated the pork belly taco while the Avocado Abogado was edible  the ribeye a little on the chewy side. The cilantro avocado sauce gave my tacos that extra added spicy kick. The chips and queso was pretty good. Warning  all my friends thought the sausage in their tacos was really salty.  Service  They need a better system of taking orders as there was a line and only one person was taking orders. Getting our food took about 30 minutes...how long does it take to make tacos and chip and queso    Atmosphere  A very hippy vibe with only outdoor seating that s covered. It would be nice to have an indoor seating area. We were lucky to have cool breezy weather as I can t imagine what it s like eating here in the summer   Take a pic in front of their  Taco About Love  flower fence sign  I wasn t able to unfortunately being there was cars blocking it.
Tyson's Tacos,211,My experience with calling in your order before you get there was a horrible experience. The employee pick up the phone to tell me to hold  helps a total of 10 customers before not even coming back to take my order  i get there an ask the employee why they don t treat call-in orders important like the walk-in orders. The female employee then says WE DONT HAVE TO ANSWER CALL-IN ORDERS. I thought that was so rude . This restaurant is very dirty  amp   unsanitary I arrived an immediately seen multiple large flies flying through the pickup window  amp  ordering window  when I approached the counter I then seen 2 large rats running inside the establishment. I WOULD NEVER EAT HERE  EVER 
Tyson's Tacos,212,Amazing tacos. I ve been here 7-8 times and I have not been disappointed.  Well  I once asked for no peppers and they accidentally served some super super hot habenero. Which I understand happens. But  tonight I mentioned that hot unholiness in passing and dude made it up to me. I love love love when you talk to an employee about a less than stellar experience and they take it upon themselves to make things right. This is why I will always come here before taco c post midnight.   Update   The Senor Ranger is my fav so far. The Hank includes a veggie chorizo which is too hot for me.   Love love love this place 
Tyson's Tacos,213,Any place where you order food from a little hole in the wall is good in my book. When I saw the hole  I got excited   I knew it was gonna ge good  insert  that s what he said joke  here .   I was right   I ordered a variety of tacos  beef and chicken. Both were excellent. The queso was good too. I really like the casual vibe as well.
Tyson's Tacos,214,Featured on Cheap Eats on the Cooking Channel  Tyson s Tacos brings a bang for your buck. This place brings some awesome quality tacos for your average college student  The best deal there is the 3 Taco Plate  choose 3 tacos  comes with rice and beans  and get a Lone Star Beer for  1    I have been here a couple of times  mostly for lunch dinner  but went there for the first time for breakfast last week  The tacos have a great variety of toppings combinations from build your own s to already set tacos.   Here are some of my favorites  Breakfast - Robinsonian  Wild Feminist  red salsa is a good pairing  Lunch Dinner  Al Pastor  Burnt Ends  Pork Belly  Crispy Duck  Brisket Taco  all sooooo good  
Tyson's Tacos,215,My favorite taco place in Austin. The tacos tasted fresh and of good quality. I will definitely be returning. The horchata is awesome as well 
Tyson's Tacos,216,Wow   The best tacos I have had in a long long time. We went around 10am and there was a small line. Plenty of seating outside in a really cool space. You order at the counter and then they call your number when it s ready at the pick up window. We had a total of six tacos between two people and it was plenty filling. Total was about 24 bucks with a coffee. Be sure to check in for the free iced tea  free refills as well   They also have cucumber water and orange water for free in coolers near the condiments. We got the matador  the rave 2.0 and another one that had chorizo and potatoes in it. The rave 2.0 was AMAZING. Truly delicious. Fresh creamy fried avocado slice with eggs etc just perfectly cooked and seasoned. The matador was rich with the cheese melted and queso as well with potatoes and bacon. Straight to the belly  Our least fav was the one with chorizo but it was still super good. I totally want to come back and try their other tacos    They do offer the plate deal which is three tacos with rice and beans for 11.99. We missed out on that because we thought it may just be a lunch dinner offering. Lastly  they have two sauces at the counter. The green one is creamy and crazy spicy. The red one is some of the freshest and most delicious salsa I ve had.   Do yourself a favor and check this out ASAP. I felt so bad for the people waiting at an omelette restaurant down the street. They need to read this review and become enlightened. Visit ASAP 
Tyson's Tacos,217,I m obsessed with this spot  Honestly  I ve only had the tasty basterd taco  but it s one of the most delicious tacos ever. It s a surf and turf taco with a bangin  sauce drizzled all over.   I love that it s 24 7 -- great for late night munchies 
Tyson's Tacos,218,Soooo good  Brunt ends taco  Yes please  Chips and guacamole... move over chipotle. Service  Fast  amazing  and bomb dot com 
Tyson's Tacos,219,Very good  I came from out of town and this place came very highly recommended  Had their  King George  breakfast taco. A unique flavor and blended taste I have never tasted before and very good 
Tyson's Tacos,220,Fantastic tacos with a flair. Great ingredients  can t say enough good things about this place. I will definitely be going back sorry it took me this long to stumble onto this awesome taco stand.
Tyson's Tacos,221,Used to love this place but after our last experience  probably won t be coming back. I absolutely love their tacos and  I was sold at the fact that this place opens 24 7. Service is TERRIBLE. Guy checking us out was on his AirPods and did not even bother to do the bare minimum. No greeting  no goodbye  no thank you... nothing. Awkward silence the whole interaction. I m not asking you to go above and beyond here.. just a greeting and a thank you would suffice... Basic customer service  It was like he didn t even care about the place which honestly makes me question about the quality of the food. No matter how good the food  is  I m not coming back if service sucks.
Tyson's Tacos,222,Update  the more I eat here  the more I fall in love. Every taco is delicious  from the simplicity of the Brisket Taco or the Burned Ends  to the vegetarian potpourri of the Rage. AND they are open 24 7. Yes  you read that right          I don t come here enough because of crossing I-35. However  I ordered pickup online today  and it did not disappoint. The salsa  house and do a  satisfied my cravings and were hot enough to take out a herd of elephants. My mouth was so on fire I could not finish my last taco. It s the kind that of flavorful hot that makes you want to eat more even though it burns. You know what I mean.   Overall this place has more authentic offerings than Torchy s  and the food seems less restaurant-supplier-y. I really should get here more often.
Tyson's Tacos,223,As far as atmosphere goes  this place is adorable. It has a kitschy  quirky vibe that makes it super  Austin-y   but keep in mind there s only outdoor seating. They do have parking available  but not a lot.   Tyson s has a lot of different choices  and you can even build your own tacos  if you want to . My first time at Tyson s  I had two breakfast tacos  the  Fried Eggs and Brisket  and the  Matador.  Both were amazing  I ve also had the Brisket Taco and have heard from others that the Puffy Chicken Tinga is really delicious. They offer two types of salsa  green and red   both were good as well.   They have both flour and corn tortillas available  but I would definitely ask for confirmation. I usually go with whichever type of tortilla they recommend  but if you have a specific preference be sure to let them know.   Another plus about this place is the hours -- it s open 24 7  The prices are also pretty reasonable. They also have vegetarian options. Overall  Tyson s is a really solid taco place. I may or may not currently be obsessed with it.
Tyson's Tacos,224,Setup  late night  The better  large variety of tacos with some interesting options  freshly made  decent queso  The lesser  cash only  Observations  misters were being used to keep things cool  but with no sun at night to help evaporate it just made all the seating wet. When it started getting more crowded the staff did go wipe things down at least.
Tyson's Tacos,225,Just ordered via Door Dash two breakfast tacos - The Rage and The Rage 2.0 - ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  I wasn t sure the size of these tacos and I wish I would have got a third.  It was delicious  I may even try this place for dinner before heading back out of town.  Too good to stop and take a photo.  Maybe next time.
Tyson's Tacos,226,SOLID taco place. Now I wish I had been here sooner   Menu is extensive and the 3 taco plate is a good deal.   Per Yelp s suggestions  I got the duck  pork belly  and pastor. I will have to say  while these are the  more expensive  and you may get more bang for your buck  the traditional tacos are tastier. To me  at least. They were still delicious but I prefer my traditional tacos without any twists or fusion.   Will return  amp  would definitely recommend. OH. Their horchata is amazing - must try.
Tyson's Tacos,227,Yes  some of their food is really good but I can t believe how stingy they are with their first responder discount .. EMT-B National and Texan  One of the lady customers was so disrespectful and rude  Sandra   asking me to show her where it says first responder military and then saying stuff like  whatever  and after I told her that she s so disrespectful and showing her she deflects and says  whatever I m giving you your discount  I even had my National certification ready to show her and had shown her from the start. Wow  I hope the manager gives me a call back so I can tell him about that bad experience..
Tyson's Tacos,228,Tyson s is is my  2 taco place in Austin.  The owner is so wonderfully sweet and kind. The folks who work to take your orders and make your food are golden.  The menu is extensive. I LOVE that they have legit vegan taco options for breakfast. Like...amazing. Not boring  nothere s some beans and potatoes  though....I love that combo but options where they actually took time to create something vegans would enjoy   Their shining star though are their lunch and dinner tacos. Here the vegan options are slimand I would looooove to see this grow. Though you probably could just build your own. But seriously-their Diablo shrimp    Their Hoover   There fish tacos.....SOOOOO GOOD. And pretty reasonably priced.   It s not a waste of your time to come over here. And their patio area is super cute and comfortable during every season. Love this gem of a taco place.
Tyson's Tacos,229,Tyson s was fine   _   _   after many years of hearing high praises  I knew I had to try Tyson s before moving away from Austin. But  I didn t find them to be anything special  and likely won t return to Tyson s anytime soon. There are other great taco places much closer to my house  and cheaper. The wait was LONG  though it wasn t crowded. The tacos weren t exceptionally great  and the prices were higher than I anticipated. Not super sure what all the fuss was about.
Tyson's Tacos,230,Really enjoyed the meal deal.  The fajita and shrimp was good  chicken Tinga great and the pork belly outstanding .  Disappointed that the burnt ends were sold out.  Hot sauces definitely had some zing.  Definitely would recommend a visit.
Tyson's Tacos,231,I ve heard a lot about Tyson s and we finally got to go.  I wish I knew I needed to study the menu before we went.  They have a bunch of choices  and many hard decisions had to be made. The deal is getting three tacos  beans  and rice for around  11.  It s not old school taco cheap  but better than what I m paying downtown for lunch.  The beans were not your normal refried beans.  They were obviously made on site and I enjoyed them a lot. For tacos  I ordered the Sr. Ranger  burnt ends  and al pastor.  I wound up getting barbacoa instead of al pastor.  That was the only dud taco.  The Sr. Ranger and burnt ends tacos definitely did the trick. Seating is all outdoors  so prepare appropriately or take it with you. It s hard being on Airport and not wish you were at Tamale House  but lacking that option Tyson s certainly isn t going to disappoint anyone that wants a quality taco.
Tyson's Tacos,232,Came here the day before Thanksgiving after my one true ATX taco love  Mi Madre s for yall still in the dark  was closed for the day  with low expectations. This place is low-key and almost zero thrills decor-wise  at least from an outsider s perspective. But once you let go of your bourgeoisie  privileged  firstworldproblems-having ass viewpoint  the delicious edibles  offered inside will truly open your eyes. You ll become tacWOKE  taco   WOKE  fam.  I had the Rage 2.0 and the B is for Bacon  which were both filling and crazy good as hangover food. We also got chips and salsa  which were authentic af and plentiful  and a cute girl eating there wasn t wearing pants. Five stars all around.  Go here fam.
Tyson's Tacos,233,I stopped here to get tacos but they were out of everything so I was charged extra to get a taco plate because not one taco I wanted was available.  I had to build my own tacos on the plate with less expensive ingredients than the tacos I wanted and was charged extra.  Don t charge your customers for your poor planning  that s horrible customer service for a business that works in the service industry.  Then they have my tacos sitting on their counter in boxes for over 15 mins  when I tried to ask about my tacos the window was closed in my face.  We ended up getting a refund and leaving because we waited almost an hour for them to hold onto our order.  All their food is pre-made and just scooped onto a tortilla.  There are plenty of late night taco spots in Austin that will have whats on their menu and not price gouge you.  Literally the worst experience I have ever had at any food service.  Don t support a bad business like this one  plenty of taco spots deserve your money.  Go somewhere else 
Tyson's Tacos,234,Paid for my yearly reminder of why I don t eat here this morning. Ordered online  two Queen Barrett s  migas  queso  avocado  house sausage  fresh jalape os  and received two Barbacoa tacos  which is obviously a completely different taco  and quite frankly not one that I like. So that was disappointing. I also ordered chips and queso and the container the queso came in was only half full. I ve gathered from other posts here  as well as past experiences w trying to get them to correct a wrong order  and it s just not worth it. Take the L. And then don t go back and give them more of your money. I do hope they enjoyed the 25  tip I left before I knew they d totally f--d my order up though   _   _  
Tyson's Tacos,235,24 hours of deliciousness  Yep  they re open 24 hours. So many tacos to choose from and enough time to eat them all. On my first visit I had a taco plate with the Mahi Mahi taco and the Diablo Shrimp taco. The Mahi was good but the shrimp was great  A taco plate has 3 tacos beans and rice for  10.99 Nice   Plenty of food for a reasonable price.   On my second visit I got another taco plate  this time with all Diablo Shrimp tacos. Again I was not disappointed. I recommend you bring some patience because they make your food to order...OR you can phone it in if you cannot wait to dig in.   Grab some Jamaica to was it all down and you ll be singing Tyson s praises too 
Tyson's Tacos,236,The service is to bad and takes a long long time to get my food and is very cold   taco is to hard to eat is not soft
Tyson's Tacos,237,Probably my favorite Taco spot in ATX at the moment. Their brisket tacos are so on point.
Tyson's Tacos,238,Ok-My first time there today-I read the Patio was dog friendly-always appreciated to be able to bring my chill dog  The most unfriendly girl swiped open the window -2 crunchy beef tacos and a fajita taco-iced tea -with a 15  tip about  14-after finding a table and scooting away all the leftover trash bags around my table-about 15 minutes later I got my order-on the way to my table I questioned if they had shorted me-the bag was So small  Everything was there -just small-the crunchy tacos were very so so and dry -the beef fajita-had 4 little bits of what appeared to be dry tasteless baked tough meat with some raw green bell peppers and a tiny bit of onion  I m sorry Tyson s I can go to a much nicer Mexican Restaurant Patio-be waited on-have free chips and salsa and a more complete lunch for less  -I don t think I ll be back 
Tyson's Tacos,239,This place is a great option for late night food. I work in a hospital near by and this place always hits the spot for graveyard shift food. The food is fairly consistent with good quality and taste so I cant complain as its late night. The selection of tacos to choose from is pretty broad as well. Only gripe i have is their refried rice is crunchy   its like eating a spoonful of tic tacs.
Tyson's Tacos,240,We found this hole-in-the-wall restaurant based on online reviews and decided to try them out.  I ordered the Three-Taco Plate which consisted of a Barbacoa Taco  Senor Ranger Taco and  Burn Ends  taco.  The Senor Ranger taco consists of fajita meat  potatoes  bacon  queso fresco  lime and sauteed bell pepper folded into a corn tortilla.  The  Burned Ends  taco features  premium angus beef brisket   onion rings and cilantro folded into a corn tortilla.  The barbacoa taco was nice and moist  and flavorful  barbacoa with cilantro y cebolla folded into a corn tortilla.   Tyson s Taco s offers 24 hour  7 day a week counter service off of Airport Blvd.  You can also order online  but its more fun to order in person  -   They serve bottled sodas  as well as beer and Mexican drinks such as Horchata. Seating is all outside under several canopys  but no fear -- there are fans that lightly mist guests so that everyone stays cool  even on the hottest of days.  The taco meat is all moist and flavorful  and have ample meat filling.  If you order a 3 Taco Plate  you also get rice and refried beans included.  The rice was flavored well and the beans were to die for -- just the right amount grease and jalapeno flavor.  I would seriously go back just for the refried beans    Overall good solid food that ranges from traditional Mexican to Mexican with a touch of  Austin flare .  Seating is somewhat limited  so keep that in mind during mealtimes.  They also serve breakfast tacos -- which I definitely want to try    I will be back 
Tyson's Tacos,241,Tyson s tacos is the best taco place in Austin  and I stand by this     24 7 - it s my go to place for after drinks or before a super early morning flight  My go to order is always the shrimp diablo and the matador  both have a good punch of flavor  If you decide to dine in  be ready to be enchanted by the quirky decor and neon bugs on the ceiling reminding you again to  Keep Austin weird    
Tyson's Tacos,242,So far my favorite taco place in Austin. I got a breakfast taco with rice in it. Soooo good. And the sauce in the tacos were amazing. I am obsessed. Unfortunately the outside seating has a bird problem where if you walk away for two seconds the birds will dive bomb your tacos so you need to be careful 
Tyson's Tacos,243,This was my first time trying Tyson s Tacos.  I have seen so many good reviews and along with the menu selection  I decided I wanted to try this out.  I had ordered online for a meal to go.  They offer so many different types of tacos  and not your everyday run of the mill kind. Don t get me wrong  they do have the standard fare  but they also serve items on their tacos such as Duck  Fried Egg yolks  fried avocado  shrimp  fish  brisket and much more.  When I arrived after placing my order online  I walked over to where the arrows pointed for online ordering to the second window and told the woman I was here to pick up my order.  She was not the  welcoming type  but she was doing her job.  Kind of a no nonsense type of person who is just trying to push out some awesome food.  But a smile would not have hurt for sure.  Today I decided to try out their Queso and I customized a couple tacos.  They have soo many yummy items to fill your tortilla with it was a hard choice  but I went with simple.  The tacos I built were  -Beef Fajita and Avocado  the beef is of very good quality  seasoned well  and cut into nice chunks  the avocado was a fresh vibrant green and perfectly ripened  -Chicken Fajita  Avocado  and Sriracha Cream Sauce  the chicken was decent - cannot complain but it did not have the wow factor the beef fajita meat did  the avocado was perfect on this taco also  the sriracha cream sauce was meh... I probably wont order it again  was kind of messy and just not something I personally enjoyed.  The queso was rather good  not over the top like some other places I have had before  but better than lots I have had. I would order this again. The chips were standard grocery store chips  or so it seemed.  The salsas  - They have both red and green. The red is a bit milder and more flavorful in my opinion and the green salsa was rather bland but spicy.  I usually like green sauce better  not here though. They offer these salsas in condiment baskets which are scattered throughout the patio and seating area.  The restaurant itself has outdoor seating and offers plenty of shade for those sunny Texas days.  They have cute decor and flowers around the patio area which is a nice touch. The place itself is pretty colorful with a  feel good  kind of ambiance.  The food and atmosphere of this place will bring me back for sure. I would like to try some of the menu Tacos they offer such as the Duck or the Pecan Crusted Tilapia  or.... So many to choose from as well as being able to build your own.
Tyson's Tacos,244,Wow      These tacos have great flavors and are a good size. We got the three taco plate with rice and beans. We got the al pastor  the brisket  the barbacoa  surf and turf  shrimp  amp  steak   and chicken fajita. The rice and beans tasted great  and the salsa  green and red  were a great addition to the tacos    
Tyson's Tacos,245,Tyson s is honestly 5 stars for our family for the quality  menu variety  value  convenience and efficient staff. HOWEVER  they continue to use STYROFOAM for everything  even salsa. We usually boycott restaurants who use styrofoam but we are pleading with you  Tyson s  please show some love for Austin and Mother Earth and replace the evil  non- biodegradable  material with a happy  compostable one.
Tyson's Tacos,246,Went here at 4 30 a.m. the other morning. Absolutely fantastic breakfast tacos. Good size tacos with a lot of egg  cheese  amp  bacon. The salsas were very  very tasty. The seating here is very groovy. Disco ball  dayglo paint and black lights. One cool spot.
Tyson's Tacos,247,My GOD  6 stars if I could. Too many taco places in Austin offering this and that  they all taste the same. This place  you have to try it. The brisket and fried egg taco came beautifully seasoned with potatos and with a runny yolk. The crispy pork belly taco  slightly dry  with mandarin pico was a flavor high  from one savory end to the sweet sweet other.  The fajitas chicken taco came moist yet firm to the hold as any taco should be. I ordered this at 2AM and the food was absolutely phenomenol.
Tyson's Tacos,248,This is my go-to spot for tacos. They ve raised the price on the 3 taco plate which is a shame  but the tacos never disappoint. I don t know why no one has mentioned the water they put out there which is flavored and actually really good lol. I also LOVE what they ve done to the place  adding several plants  flowers  and glow-in-the-dark stars to the roof which make for a totally dope vibe at night    The picture doesn t do it justice. If you haven t been here  try it 
Tyson's Tacos,249,Had a few bad experiences with Torchy s  so we were weekly regulars here for over a year. While dealing with the pissy counter girls who can t fake a smile to save their lives is annoying  we still came for good tacos. Recently I ve found the owner is a raging Trump supporter. He owns a taco shop and employs mostly Hispanic people and supports trump. Let s think about this contradiction. We switched over to Paco s and I regret wasting all of my time at any other taco shop. Best tacos in austin by far    Most of these tweets are deleted  please see 6 pictures  but please feel free to check out more of the trump supporting fun at the owners twitter  ChefTysonB
Tyson's Tacos,250,Delicious tacos  Quite a few vegetarian options  not vegan . A little bit of seating inside   outside. The music was SO loud though. Couldn t hear myself think.
Tyson's Tacos,251,Tyson s Tacos are hands down the whitest tacos I ve tried in Austin. Okay atmosphere here and convenient because it s open 24 hours  but I wouldn t recommend anything beyond the horchata. Do not get the Senor Ranger or Diablo Shrimp tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,252,You wanna know how to get a free taco in Austin  Texas        Play a song on a ukulele at Tyson s Tacos  Seriously  and if they don t tell you about this awesome deal  ask them about it and they will hand over the Ukulele    Also  this is a taco joint that is open 24 7     I don t know if anything in Austin can top this because it s always a challenge for me to find decent food open past 11 on week days     I ordered the B is for Bacon taco  it has potatoes  double bacon  cheese  and eggs. By double bacon  they really only mean 2 strips of bacon haha  so don t have high expectations of getting a taco full of bacon. The 1 con I have to point about this taco was that the potatoes were kind of hard haha... I like biting into soft potatoes. For our free taco  thanks to my amazing boyfriend for playing the FUN song from SpongeBob  we got the barbacoa. It had a strong smokey flavor that was very scrum-deliumptious  Try this place out next time you re up late and craving a taco 
Tyson's Tacos,253,Cute little taco spot with old Austin vibes. Pretty outdoor patio that s perfect for enjoying your breakfast tacos. My go-to is The Rage and Queen Barret. Their fried avocado holds up much better than what you ll get at Torchy s. Great salsas as well.   My only complaint is their flour tortillas are grocery store quality. Definitely not freshly made or even left to warm on the griddle before they fill them.
Tyson's Tacos,254,this is my favorite taco spot in austin. Great tacos  nice staff  cute dining area  Open 24 hrs is the best part though. If I could give them a million stars I would.  Favorite tacos here in no particular order Spicy brisket  Pok pok Crispy duck
Tyson's Tacos,255,Decent tacos  but honestly you could get them at any standard Austin vendor. Nothing super special here. I wasn t blown away by the tacos I got  and I prefer other spots like Taco Joint or Las Trancas. Also  I hear the owner of this place is anti-immigrant  which is ironic  seeing that tacos aren t from the US. Oh well. If you re going to steal a culture s food  at least make it good  
Tyson's Tacos,256,Let s face it  24 hour taco spot that has the best variety and combos in town. Enough said.  Update  The taco is up   The owner got in touch and we are working on bringing a custom taco brought to you by the scarlet speedster 
Tyson's Tacos,257,The service here is literally terrible and the workers are extremely rude  I can not even believe how aggressive and rude the cashier was  I feel violated  Much less there is garbage everywhere and it s completely unsanitary
Tyson's Tacos,258,fav place to get tacos in Austin. hope they bring back the brisket  amp  egg taco  but great choices nonetheless 
Tyson's Tacos,259,The breakfast tacos are pretty good. I like the avocado abogado especially. However I m giving them 3 stars because their online ordering process is terrible  I arrived 15 minutes after the order was supposedly ready and they had not even started it yet 
Tyson's Tacos,260,Quintessential Austin taco place  order at the window  grab a shaded  misted air seat and let the sounds of a uke take you away.  Yep  you can sing and strum for free tacos  how cool is that   Our group had Matador  recommended   Burnt Ends  Diablo Shrimp  Ranger  Chicken Fajita  Potato and Egg.  Everyone was happy with their choices.  Great flavors  green sauce was perfect heat  tortillas were excellent.  If you havent been  just go  you will be glad you did.
Tyson's Tacos,261,This place went down hill. The last few times I ve bee here  the food has been awful  rubbery  overcooked beef  bad tortillas  dry chicken.  Also--as has been documented on Twitter--the owner is a trump-loving anti-immigrant nut job.
Tyson's Tacos,262,Ohhhh my goodness   Tyson s did not disappoint   I had an early flight to catch out of Austin  and needed to feed my taco habit one more time.  A quick search found Tyson s..  highly rated  amp  open 24 7   All the breakfast tacos sounded great  but the King George stood out.  Deep fried avocado  bacon  scrambled eggs with pico  and some spicy queso   Breakfast perfection   I highly recommend this place  amp  hope to sample some lunch tacos one day 
Tyson's Tacos,263,This review isn t about the food which was good until I saw a German cockroach on the window near the pickup window. This is about the owner who was busted deleting very nasty tweets which were pro trump and vile. If you don t believe it just type in Tyson blankemeyer in google and you ll see. In this country you re allowed free speech but don t forget the repercussions of it.
Tyson's Tacos,264,So the food was a 5 star only reason entire restaurant gets a four is the whole experience.  Pro s Great food Lots of options Well priced   Con s Menu can be selective served  Sunday they might have a restricted menu    Took a long time for the food and when ordering chips they came with the tacos.  Normally you kind of want to snack while you wait.   Overall this place was great and I will be back for more 
Tyson's Tacos,265,Avoid this place. So nasty.  10 for 2 tacos and a drink and a side of someone s hair  The lemonade was good and I had already taken a bite of the diablo shrimp when I saw the hair. My stomach hurts now cause I m so grossed out or maybe cause the shrimp was rubbery 
Tyson's Tacos,266,I am obsessed with Tyson s tacos. It s a little bit embarrassing. I think I went there four times last week. The crunchy tacos are absolutely to die for. I went on a Tuesday and it was less expensive and so I don t know if it s a taco Tuesday special or what but I can t find anything about it on the website. I highly recommend this place it s freaking delicious
Tyson's Tacos,267,I ve only been once.  The tables were dirty  there s a huge menu  which made me wonder how fresh everything is   and the tacos are all very expensive. I had to wait a long time for my order to be prepared but it wasn t  cos they were busy. I was the only person there.  I haven t been back  but I came to leave this review because the owner recently started advertising his business as  safe for LGBTQ  and I found out he s actually a major Trump supporter and a bigot. Manipulating the gay community while putting political power into discriminating against them is the same thing Chick-Fil-A does.  If you have a look at his Twitter page  ChefTysonB  you ll see what I mean.   Bad and overpriced food in a dirty environment just made me walk away. When he decided to lie to the gay community and hustle our support while being a Trumper  that pushed it over the line.  I rarely give a bad review. I don t usually say anything when it s bad. But this is the worst of the worst.
Tyson's Tacos,268,Let me preface this review by saying how much I LOVE Tyson s. It s my favorite taco place ever and it s my go-to when feeding friends from out of town.  That being said  today I had the worst experience I ve ever had in my 20  times going there. My friend and I were  greeted  by a rather rude young lady who took our orders  which consisted of 5 tacos and an order of guacamole.   The guacamole  served by the same young woman  was half the size that we are usually given  so my friend went back and politely asked why it was so much smaller of a portion size than notmal. She was told  the policy changed   to which my friend asked  since we last got it 5 days ago    and the girl said  yes. The price of avocados went up . This is understandable I suppose  yet incredibly frustrating that they didn t tell us when we placed the order or couldn t just give us more this one time and let us know that going forward it ll be smaller portion. My tacos came and had the smallest amount of filling I ve ever had there  see photos  and were very disappointing overall for tacos that were almost  5 each. These are also my go-to tacos so I have something to compare them to as recently as last week.  I m just so sad. Our service and experience were terrible despite the fact that the place was practically empty. I m now conflicted on whether or not I ll ever go back.
Tyson's Tacos,269,Hard to find a better taco  or queso and chips  in Austin  with obvious apologies to Torchy s .  Quirky  inexpensive  and delicious. Plus  the Austin institution  Mrs. Johnson s Donuts is right across the street. It s well worth the short drive from down downtown  but prepared for the weather because all the seating is outside or in a small enclosed patio area. Definitely one to add to The List.
Tyson's Tacos,270,We stopped by Tyson s this morning for breakfast tacos to go. They were super fast and easy to pickup and so so delicious    We loved the King George taco and Rage 2.0 taco. They had so much flavor and a great sauce. It looks like there are tons of great options for lunch and I can t wait to come back and try more  
Tyson's Tacos,271,I used to really support this place and frequent it when I lived in Austin. However after learning that the owner is a Trump supporting bigot  I am not interested in supporting this place. Support places owned by people of color instead.
Tyson's Tacos,272,Good tacos  with HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The last three times I came here  it was after 11 pm and it was always the same RUDE girl with a TERRIBLE attitude. When I discussed her terrible attitude to another lady working here  I was informed that the girl s name is Aurora. The first time I encountered Aurora  I asked her for another small side of salsa. Aurora declined to give me another side of salsa and suggested that I go back in line and wait 30 minutes behind 10 or so people to pay 20 cents extra for a sauce. When I told her that I didn t like her attitude  she retaliated by holding on to my tacos  suggesting that I get a refund for the tacos  and by telling me NOT TO COME BACK. The second and last time I encountered Aurora  she still had a terrible attitude and she was charging me random prices of 60 cents to  1 for the tiny amount of salsa that come with the tacos. When I asked her why the pricing was inconsistent and why she was charging me EVEN MORE than last time  she said she doesn t know how much extra she is supposed to be charging me and that she was just charging me whatever she wanted. She just has a terrible careless attitude and is aloof enough to charge customers random inconsistent prices. Anybody that has the audacity to treat customers this poorly should NOT work in customer service or even be employed at all.
Tyson's Tacos,273,Open 24 hours  Tyson s Tacos is a classic spot to grab original Texas style tacos. Size is what you d typically expect. Price is on the higher side  4-5  a pop on average . Staff is usually pretty friendly. The seating is all outdoors  but they have a pretty good setup going. Restrooms are around the back. Parking is plentiful. Pro tip  ask about the ukulele challenge. You play and sing a song and get one free taco for every original cover your perform. Doesn t have to be good but has to be authentic  must actually be able to play . Swing by the donut shop next door for dessert 
Tyson's Tacos,274,I stopped in Tyson s Tacos this morning for some breakfast tacos.  My friend  who recently moved to Austin  told me that I can t leave town until I ve tried some breakfast tacos  so I whipped out my trusty Yelp app  and it recommended Tyson s as a nearby place to get some good ones.  As usual  the recommendation didn t disappoint.  Similar to many SoCal taco shops  the format is to walk up  order and pay  and then come get your tacos when your number is called.  Tyson s has about 10 different breakfast taco options to choose between  including vegetarian options.  I went with the  B  is for Bacon   2.99   which consists of a double portion of bacon  eggs  and potatoes topped with cheese  and the King George   3.50   which consists of migas  fried avocado  and bacon topped with creamy sriracha sauce.  In addition  I ordered a small horchata   2.25 .  My order was called less than 5 min. after ordering.  The tacos were quite generously sized  and were well-filled.  I had the  B  is for bacon first  and it was as filling and greasily delicious as you might imagine.  The bacon was definitely prominent  consisting of two thick and crispy slices positioned prominently on top of the eggs and potatoes.  The flavor of this taco was nicely enhanced by the red salsa  which I applied generously.  The King George was a more complex affair  the textures of the bacon and fried avocado complemented one another nicely  with the sriracha adding heat and a touch of sweetness.  I put a bit of salsa on this one  but it wasn t necessary due to the already complex medley of flavors.  The horchata was milky  cinnamon-y  and sweet  making for a refreshing palate cleanser when the greasy  savory deliciousness of the tacos became overwhelming.  Tyson s seating is all outdoor  situated on a porch to the side of the building.  One amusing fact about the place is that  upon learning that his shop is rated the number one taco shop for musicians in Austin  the owner devised a clever test to determine whether customers are musicians.  Apparently  it involves requesting a ukelele behind the window and playing pleasing music for other customers  with the compensation rate being 1 song 1 taco.  I d love to know how many customers have successfully taken advantage of this offer--my guess would be quite a few  given that Austin is a destination for live music   Overall  I was extremely pleased with my experience at Tyson s.  While I can t directly compare their breakfast tacos to others in Austin  given that I don t live in the area and that this was my first breakfast taco experience  I can say that they were super-delicious and filling  and that I d definitely return given the opportunity 
Tyson's Tacos,275,I love their tacos  If you re into tortillas stuffed with tons of amazing ingredients  this is your place  I always get the 3 taco plate special which comes with 3 of ANY of their tacos  yes that includes breakfast tacos   as well as rice and beans for  11.99. My favorite tacos to get would be the Rage  avocado abogado  and senor ranger  but honestly all of their tacos are good. I recommend anything with steak or anything with creamy sriracha and fried avocado. They have red and green salsa as well as cilantro and onions  you just have to ask  PS  this place is now open 24 hours so you can satisfy your taco cravings any time.
Tyson's Tacos,276,Some of the raddest tacos west of 35. Don t get me wrong  I know brazas house is around the corner as well as a host of others. But these dudes do it right  they ve got the ambiance  the right price  the booze  the rad seating area AND...they re open 24 freaking hours a day. So your taco needs are always met.   Low on funds but need a taco in your belly  Come by and try your hand at playing the ukulele and singing a song. In their eyes that earns you sweet sweet  glory. They have the rules posted by the window that you order from if you were interested.   I also love this block because it makes for a rad night. Tysons tacos  followed by I  Video then across the street is the 24 hour donut shop.. if you still need more  Barflys to cap of the evening less than a mile away.
Tyson's Tacos,277,First let me say that I loveee that this place is open 24 7. I ve tried the breakfast tacos  the matador and Princess Leia.  both were good. Check this place out.
Tyson's Tacos,278,I haven t really eaten here but I love their dirty horchatas the small size tastes better.
Tyson's Tacos,279,I really wanted to like this spot. Cool vibe and nice staff. I also love the convenience if online ordering. But...the food. I ordered a steak taco and a chicken fajita taco. Neither had any type of seasoning on them. I added tons of their salsa and was still underwhelmed.   I also had the rice  which was really good . I added that to my tacos to spice them up. I mean  it wasn t bad but it was so far below what I m used to getting at an authentic taco spot.
Tyson's Tacos,280,I d give these guys like  4.5  but I decide to lean into the 5  What I had   BREAKFAST TACOS - The Bond Girl  The sausage was great  nice  salty  crumbly  and I really enjoyed the cheddar sauce  It s not like  shredded cheddar the melts over the warm ingredients  but it s a cheddar sauce that isn t overwhelming or overly processed  so it s not like a velveeta . I d totes get this again   - Lara Bonita  the chicken was kinda dry  and it was like  a thick slice of chicken stuck in the taco. It was fine  but the chicken was dry  bland  and overwhelmed everything else about this taco. I d have preferred shredded chicken. I wouldn t get this again.  - King George  this was soooo good  you could eat this anytime  not just breakfast. The sriracha mayo mayo with the fried avocado was great and the bacon added a nice  salty crunch for texture. Dem flavorful migas was perfect to round out the flavor and texture. Love it  I d get it again   OTHER TACOS - Crispy Duck  this was pretty good  I don t remember it truly impressing me  but I did enjoy it. I recommend it.  - Brisket Taco  I thought that the brisket was kinda dry and unflavorful. I wouldn t get one again.  DRINKS - Cold Brew Coffee  yummy loooove.  I d def grab some new tacos from these guys again  I think they win out over Taco Deli  actually  who is otherwise my current fav next to the Royal Grocery tacos .
Tyson's Tacos,281,An Austin institution. Doing tacos before millennials existed.  -  Recommend trying the Rage and a horchata on the patio. Friendly staff and consistent quality.
Tyson's Tacos,282,If you do anything today go to Tyson s tacos. You can order online and pickup at the window for those Saturday mornings you re running a little slow after a long night out. So many comfort food options and unique twist on favorites. Not to mention it s such an unique cute place. When you think of Austin this shouldn t fall short on your list.
Tyson's Tacos,283,Omg....the crispy duck  Another reviewer did not steer me wrong with the crispy duck.   In pic  crispy duck  king george  rage 2.0
Tyson's Tacos,284,First time having breakfast tacos ever and I don t think I ll be a convert. Matador taco was good. Queen barrett I didn t like Cool environment though Nice patio for the pooch
Tyson's Tacos,285,Outstanding tasting tacos   We came in a Sunday and there was a line that took a good 15-20 minutes to make our way through. However  if you phone in your order  you ll be in and out in a jiffy. We had a 3 taco plate that you could mix and match along with rice and beans. You can t wrong. Casual seating and luckily pets were allowed since we were heading back to Houston and had the pup in tow. Really great tacos. My favorite was the Matador  then the Barbacoa  I made some at home 2 days later bc there s left me hankering for more. Of the 3 my Carne Asada taco ranked 3 of 3  but it was tender and tasty too.
Tyson's Tacos,286,Hands down  best taco joint in Austin. Authentic  flavorful  unique tacos that accommodate anyone s tastebuds. Super friendly service. The rage  amp  hank are my favorites.  Call ahead during lunch because the line is so long you won t get your food on time if you have only 30 minutes   They offer 5stars rewards  and I always get free stuff  which is cool.  The chips and salsa are amazing and their unique sauces just take these tacos to the next level.  This is a must-see if you re visiting from out of town 
Tyson's Tacos,287,Just like a lot of things that get cool in AUSTIN  ends up getting played out... Tysons Taco has lost it s yummy and cool factor because they can t handle the customer demand.  This morning it took 45 minutes to get our order which was wrong. They left out my son s bacon and didn t melt his cheese on his quesadilla.  Everyone else s tacos were cold.  These problems were a clear result from them taking online and over the phone orders. In between each order that was placed at the counter there was four or five virtual orders.  That s what happens when you get greedy and you don t have the operations to maintain your product and customer service.   Disappointed and lost customer  Rangel Familia 
Tyson's Tacos,288,Great tacos here   Tysons comes highly recommended by locals. Had the Brisket Taco  amp  Chicken fajita taco. Both had great flavor.  Queso was the bomb   Wish there was more seating 
Tyson's Tacos,289,I love Tyson s  Im from Houston and I always got to make a stop and have a Dirty Horchata and Matador  Remember these are Austin inspired tacos so dont be expecting authentic these are unique and delicious   
Tyson's Tacos,290,The best tacos in Austin. Without a doubt  good menu  the three taco combo plus a lone star is almost too good to be true.
Tyson's Tacos,291,A 24 hour legit and delicious taco shack. They only have patio outdoor seating  but don t let that steer you away if it s cold out. They will enclose it with tents and heaters  and you can always take your meal to-go as well. Tyson s has been a good option for breakfast tacos since it s right down the street from my home. I ALWAYS order the King George taco   another one that I will change every time just to try something new. The King George cannot be beat though    Their queso is great  and I love the two salsa sauces they have at the counter as well. The green is SPICY and the other is a good flavorful mild. Tyson s also has chameleon cold brew on tap as well as a few alcoholic cans. I belong to their text rewards program  so I love randomly getting a text with a BOGO coupon  I bring a lot of my visitors here and they always love it. The staff is so friendly and helpful  this place can get packed and I don t think I ve ever received my order wrong. There s fun decor  and a sign at the register challenging  musicians  to play the ukulele for a free taco. Look for the sign with the sparkly heart  and the dancing pigs in tutu s on the roof. Also  watch out for the grackles  they are ruthless and will steal your taco if you get up for napkins 
Tyson's Tacos,292,This place was amazing      Service was great  Order was on time and food was hot and delicious.. our kids love the glowing Ceiling with glowing bugs.. this will be one of our stops when we visit Austin Tx again ..
Tyson's Tacos,293,This is song is for you Tyson s.  a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.youtube.com 2Fwatch 3Fv 3DfmtMfzZ2zNk amp s b2017d3d8c8970ecd5451293c91075970a7827283f5df510d4b1fbfba5915878  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  youtube.com watch v fmtM   a 
Tyson's Tacos,294,I like Tyson s  They re laid-back  fun  and reasonably priced. The vibe is everything I d want from a funky Austin taco stand. The food is decent and reliable but nothing more. It s a fine choice if you live in or find yourself in the neighborhood and have a no-nonsense breakfast taco-sized hole in your stomach. It s not worth a special trip  however  and it isn t quite the place I d want an out-of-towner to go to judge Austin s taco cred.  The people are nice  the selection is good  more gringo-hipster than hyper-authentic   and the vibe is fun. The creamy green sauce is legit and freely available. Stick with reliable breakfast taco options and you can t go wrong. The more-ambitious taco offerings are the ones more likely to sound better in description than they taste in execution. Cheers 
Tyson's Tacos,295,My favorite taco place of the ATX     This place is SPECIAL  They are so versatile with their taco selections. Their Crispy Duck taco was amazing  I can t wait to come back and try more  Let s just say it HITSSS   
Tyson's Tacos,296,24 7 access is the best thing about this place   My personal rec is robinsonian which I think is a fancy migas based taco that is no longer on the menu. Also don t forget to check in on yelp for a free iced tea  which is actually better than most iced teas at restaurants  
Tyson's Tacos,297,Awesome tacos horrible service. With the horrible service  the tacos must have been so amazing that it did not impact me that much. Really can t go wrong with any of them  they have a bit of everything for everyone. It was really busy for a Sunday morning  so you will have to try to stake out for a table. I got the Avocado Abogado and Robinsonian which were both tasty.  Service can improve. My friend was asking for no cheese on his breakfast taco. What do they do  They add extra cheese instead and charged him extra lol. Once it was rung up he told them the mistake. The cashier fixed his order but would not refund him and even copped an attitude with him. Granted it s only 60 cents  but I think it s the principle that matters. It was poor service and she was extremely rude about it. She was not sympathetic and simply said  I can t do it because it s too complicated. 
Tyson's Tacos,298,I live around the corner from Tyson s but never went there much til lately and became obsessed with their salsa. I just picked up my to go order and could cry. What changed since last week   Omg please bring back whoever was making salsa cuz I what I got today was flavorless soup. So sad 
Tyson's Tacos,299,Once again the team got tysons tacos and once again getting 2 of those without cheese was too bug a challenge for this place.  The tacos are fine  it s a breakfast taco how can that not be fine right   But you better be willing to eat whatever they give you cuz getting it right is not their goal.  Shove out some random tacos that are just ok and move on should be their slogan.   Go to Dan s  it s a burger joint but at least you will get the taco you asked for.
Tyson's Tacos,300,No long review needed here   I have been 2 times in 3 days   Once for breakfast  amp  once for dinner and I would totally go back for lunch tomorrow  I love everything from the outside seating atmosphere to the menu to the  1 Lone Star Tall Boy  got with my dinner  Everything is so good    This is a must try and go back again often 
Tyson's Tacos,301,This is my favorite taco spot in Austin  Everything I ve ever gotten here over the years has been fantastic and you can t beat that it s open 24 hours a day 
Tyson's Tacos,302,A rainy day  one car outside I finally got th e chance to Try this always busy place. Ordered the Tasty Basterd and the Brisket tacos. Quick service  open minimal interior. When they arrived they seemed slightly underwhelming. The tasty basterd I definitely liked more but both just seemed.......uninspired. These are decent tacos fast  but tax in these are definitely not  5 tacos. I think they garner good business being on airport  right off the interstate and open 24 hours. For half the price for better street tacos I ll remember to easily go to Taqueria La Canaria two streets north.
Tyson's Tacos,303,Absolutely delicious tacos and awesome hipster atmosphere   Loved their crispy duck and Rage 2.0 breakfast tacos. They have a lot of creative and interesting choices  so I plan to come back and try more. A couple more things I really liked  - There is a 5  charge for whining  Good job  Funny  creative and cool  Loved it  Way to go  - If you know how to play ukulele your tacos are free. 1 taco per song  no limit  While we were there I saw at least one person taking advantage of the offer and it was a great addition to the atmosphere. - The staff was friendly and helpful. Our order showed up fast and was very tasty. A couple of things I would improve  - B is for Bacon taco was a little too salty for my taste.  - The coffee was a disappointment  but I am sure we should have known better and ordered a Topo Chico or a beer.  Overall my impression is super positive and I know I will be back.
Tyson's Tacos,304,I came here for lunch during a week day. It was fairly busy. It is all outdoor seating but it s covered  it was fairly chilly on the day that I went so it was a little breezy in there.   It s a walk up order at the window thing and then you get your order number called. We got the chips and queso  the order was huge  Well a giant bowl of chips and a smaller bowl of queso. It was okay  not the best queso I ve had but it s okay. There was a lot of tomatoes in the queso  if that s your thing.   I got the pork belly taco  but I wasn t a fan of the onions  mandarin orange. I took it out and really enjoyed the taco then. I also ordered the B is for Bacon taco and that was pretty delicious. I would recommend getting that.   The food was okay  the price was alright.  The parking is sort of a pain  there weren t that many people there but there were few spots to park at.
Tyson's Tacos,305,This place is 24 hours so a lot of people come here for hangover cures. Everything about the taco is really really fantastic except for the tortillas. Having store bought flour tortillas just really makes a difference. I wish they had some homemade butter tortillas but maybe I m just asking for too much. I highly recommend the breakfast tortillas since they re a little cheaper and stuffed with delicious eggs and egg. I ordered one with chorizo and it was absolutely deliciously. I tried the carnitas tacos also which had a deep smoky flavor but was kind of dry. Nonetheless  another great taco joint in Austin. Also  if you can play the ukelele you get free tacos. I unfortunately am not that talented but I got to watch my friend do it 
Tyson's Tacos,306,The fact that I can get amazing tacos  chips  and queso has made 2020 bearable  My favorite is B is for Bacon add brisket. Can t go wrong at this place.
Tyson's Tacos,307,YUM YUM YUM. It s our first week in Austin so we don t have much to compare  but we ve already ordered breakfast tacos twice from Tyson s so you tell me. I don t eat meat and my fave is the Hank - the veggie chorizo is spiced perfectly and absolutely to die for. My boyfriend  the carnivore  said  the brisket is the best I ve ever had and it s not even a BBQ place.  Also  the cold brew is great  We will be frequent customers 
Tyson's Tacos,308,After reviewing their menu on yelp it looked really good. After arriving it s a nice taco stand with lots of parking  outdoor seating and a walk up window. They have a nice selection of salads  appetizers  breakfast and lunch tacos  build your own and taco plates. The prices are very reasonable.   We decided to order the crispy duck taco  cucumber  green onion  hoison sauce  Burnt ends taco  onion rings  pickled jalapenos  Valentina cream  Brisket taco  Pickled onion  fresh jalapeno  avacodo  cilantro    The crispy duck taco was crispy alright I almost chipped a tooth. Even the hoisin couldn t help it. The brisket and burnt ends were so dry they were completely uneatable. Seems that the meats were not very fresh and lacked any flavor.
Tyson's Tacos,309,This place is so cute and whimsical  Love the garden vibe if you re planning to dine on the patio. It s also open 24 hours  I got the Ranger taco and it was DELICIOUS 
Tyson's Tacos,310,This place is amazing. Their breakfast tacos are my go to. The staff is always so nice  Huge recommendation for tacos in ATX 
Tyson's Tacos,311,Not sure what happened  but my last visit was quite a letdown. It d been a few months since I stopped by  but I was still expecting the  A  tacos that I d had in the past. For starters  they no longer have the beef rib or duck confit tacos  which were my favorite items  and they also increased the price on their 3-taco plate. The tacos that we did order were just not great. The amount of meat seemed lacking  and the meat that was there was poorly prepared. My pork belly taco had giant  inedible chunks of chewy fat  and my friend s mahi-mahi taco was so dry  it felt more like fish jerky.   I used to love this place and have had a handful of great meals here. This last visit was easily the busiest I d seen the restaurant  so I m hoping their increasing popularity hasn t affected the quality of their tacos. Maybe they were just having an off night.
Tyson's Tacos,312,In full disclosure  I ve only stepped foot on the property once  but I ve ordered to go more times than I m willing to admit. Tyson s is the BEST Saturday afternoon hangover cure  diet cheat  food craving in Austin.   Don t go here if you re looking for authentic street tacos. This place is the epitome of a true Austin Taco. The kind where they re so good  you have to order more than you can eat because you want to try something new without cheating on your old favorites.   King George is so good I may name my first born after it. The creamy fried avocado is something you have to experience. B is for Bacon is another breakfast classic  for bacon lovers obviously  . I haven t tried something I didn t like and the tacos are affordable enough you can try them all. 2-3 should fill you up. And don t forget the green sauce  
Tyson's Tacos,313,Great tacos  Every chance I get I swing by. Burnt ends  peking duck and the chicken tinga puffy tacos are some of my favorites. The staff is super helpful and friendly always a pleasure to deal with. Looking forward toy next visit
Tyson's Tacos,314,This is one of my favorite spots for yummy tacos on corn. I highly recommend the Rage 2.0  the Feminist  and the Greybeard.  Everything is delicious. Can t find too many spots with free unlimited water options on the patio. They offer complimentary water infused with limes  cucumbers  and oranges 
Tyson's Tacos,315,To start off i ordered the taco plate. Three tacos with rice and beans. Since it was my first time here i wanted to skip getting the beef tacos because  there s no way to mess that up. I ended up getting two tacos that looked like carnita tacos with over powering pineapple slices. The second choice meat i got was barbacoa. They were smothered in grease and had no taste  some what bland. I will say on a positive note the rice and beans were good. So if you want to go to a place to take pictures and hangout after a night of drinks. This place is where to come.
Tyson's Tacos,316,Oh my  probably the second best taco place in Austin  in my opinion  only behind Veracruz. Even then it was a fine line. This taco joint has such a unique flair and I love finding the little decor pieces that are so eclectic - for example  a giant picture of George Castanza in his underwear on the wall in the kitchen. You order your tacos at a window and can sit anywhere you want. It s a small area but very lively at night. I got the taco platter which comes with 2 tacos  beans  and rice. It was so filling for just 2  It s not the typical street style tacos that are miniature  so beware when ordering. The average price for the tacos are about  3 each. The reason I took off a star is for their menu. I personally am not vegetarian  but a couple of my friends who were with me are. They do have a vegetarian area on the menu  but first of all  it s called  vegetarian-like tacos . I m not sure what that s supposed to mean. It didn t help that one of the tacos had chicharron in it. We always thought that s fried pork skin  but thought maybe it was a vegetarian knock off since it s under the  vegetarian-like  section. But no...my friend asked the cashier and he said it s indeed pork skin. He also didn t seem to understand why this was a problem when it s under the vegetarian menu. I m so glad I eat everything  but I do feel for my vegetarian friends and would highly warn you if you re one too  Ask what s in your taco.
Tyson's Tacos,317,24 7 tacos.... MUST I SAY MORE    And they save your card info if you place a to-go order online so that you can place future orders on the fly. If you decide to give place a shot  you should consider ordering The Prince  secret off-the-menu taco .   P.S. you can get a free taco for every song that you can play on the uke that they have accessible at the front of the line
Tyson's Tacos,318,They had great tacos. I have no clue what they were called but we all ate them without hesitation. They have a little parking lot in the front and they had weird setup where it s mostly outside. It wasn t too bad to be sitting out in the cold but just keep it in mind. They do this thing where if you sing you get a free taco. But at 4am...they  let someone sing for 3 minutes as we were freezing and craving food.
Tyson's Tacos,319,The combination of good tacos and being open 24 hours makes me and my fellow college student friends come here often. The place itself is very unique with it s dancing pig roof and neon splattered ceilings  definitely come at night to get the whole ambience . Get the pork belly taco    I recommend it to all of my friends and they all love it. It seems like everyone else must love it too though because they sometimes run out if we come late so please more pork belly 
Tyson's Tacos,320,Amazing Tacos  It s our new go to spot. They offer a wide variety of things and some creative options. I love the duck taco and great breakfast taco options. Don t be put off by the interesting dining space it adds to the experience 
Tyson's Tacos,321,Ever since I discovered TT I haven t been going anywhere else for my taco fix. It s about a once a week thing at my house. Favorite is the Chicken Tinga  and close favorites are the Grime Time and Barbacoa. Can t go wrong with the pork belly taco either. These tacos are so simple  fresh and flavorful   Plus  so far every time it has delivered to my doorstep. I ll be coming to come visit in person very soon 
Tyson's Tacos,322,I loved this place SO MUCH. Great menu  fair prices  large portions  helpful and friendly staff  cool seating area  plenty of parking and seating and most importantly delicious food with late hours. One of my favorite places when visiting Austin 
Tyson's Tacos,323,Yoooo these tacos are DOPE  There are so many different options  I only wish I could try them all   The ones I have tried are the Rage 2.0  the Wild Feminist  lol   and Tati s Perfect 10  and all of them were incredible  My favorite of those was definitely the Tati s because I am a huge al pastor fan  but the breakfast tacos were all great too. It s insane how many ingredients they can pack into one taco.   ALSO  free cucumber water  Orange water  What is this  a spa   The outdoor patio is so cute and it s such a fun lil environment  I ve only been during daylight hours but I want to come back for one of their cool events at night 
Tyson's Tacos,324,26 100 Yelp 2017 Review Challenge  I have to give it to Tyson s Tacos for changing my life. I am a big taco fan - no  lover - and I did not know that breakfast tacos  or migos  were a thing until Texas. So yeah  shoutout to Tyson s for being the restaurant to serve me my first breakfast tacos and migos     Everything is bigger in Texas  even the tacos. I definitely underestimated this concept before coming to Texas. I wanted three tacos because they all sounded so good but my friend assured me that 2 would leave me pretty satisfied. I ordered the King George because FRIED AVOCADO and then the Range 2.0. Love at first bite. So flavorful and filling. The sauces and salso added a nice heat to them. I could taco bout this all day.
Tyson's Tacos,325,The tacos sound great and the prices are decent  but flavor was an issue. All I could taste was the tortilla. In addition  I asked for flour and got corn on all. Last but actually the worst   Do Not get seafood. We got the diablo shrimp and I swear  the shrimp tasted and smelled like it s been sitting out for all dang day in the 105 degree heat. I do a fair amount of fishing and the shrimp tastes like the bait I buy from academy....at the end of the day.   The lemonade was good though.
Tyson's Tacos,326,The hype is real guys.  Believe me  I love a fancy taco just as much as everyone else but found this place to be quite lackluster.  I ordered the three taco plate today and the Pork Belly was moderately interesting. The Barbacoa was wet and bland and the Brisket was saved by the picked onion and avocado but again  bland. Although I loved the cute salsa bottles the liquid inside was not worth stealing. Rice and beans were definitely two star.   It may or may not be worth noting that the bathroom was flooded and had no tp...   I ll wait until I learn to play the ukulele to return for a free taco.
Tyson's Tacos,327,First off  a friend and I came here because they were pretty much the only place open at around midnight after we had an event nearby. That already made it a cool place to go.  My friend and I each ordered 2 tacos and the chips with queso. They aren t huge or anything but it was too much food  And man were they good.  Now I m back with my wife and we split the 3 taco plate  which comes rice and beans. We had the diablo shrimp  burned ends and al pastor plus added chips and queso. We pretty much finished everything. But it was plenty.  Each taco was AWESOME  Were they the best I ve had  Probably not. But I don t think I ve had better. I m a bit of a queso snob and I love this queso. On par with any of the good ones I ve had.  I will be returning. Again. And again. And again. Will refer everyone I know. Definitely one of the best hole-in-the-wall type places I ve been for tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,328,Just Doordashed this place. Omg. So good. Maybe we re drunk  but this food was on time. We ordered queso  salsa  shrimp taco  chicken fajita taco and brisket taco. It was all legit. I ll def order again.
Tyson's Tacos,329,their tacos are ok  good for the late night since theyre open 24 7 the chips andqueso is good too. huge portions
Tyson's Tacos,330,This is a cute little taco place  Came here on a Saturday and had our food within 5 minutes. Great food and we loved the atmosphere  Nachos are very large serving and could easily be shared.  There were a lot of options for tacos  both wild and tame.
Tyson's Tacos,331,My husband and I are visiting Austin and we were told to give Tyson s a try. Glad we did  The tacos are really delicious and perfectly seasoned. He had brisket tacos and I had a chicken fajita one and a crispy taco. We ll definitely go back before we return home.
Tyson's Tacos,332,I m not a huge fan of traditional tacos so I was thrilled to find Tyson s. I ve been several times now over the past year and have never had less than spectacular food. I wish the drink selection was a little more varied but that s definitely not going to slow me down. My favorites are the Scooby and the Tasty Basterd. The queso is excellent. I can t say enough great things about Tyson s. If you forced me to come up with a criticism  the only one I ve got is that the d  m grackles are as annoying here as they are everywhere else in Austin. Be prepared to defend your feast.
Tyson's Tacos,333,Great tacos open 24 hours  Among the taco spots in Austin Tyson s is definitely overlooked but is definitely worth the stop. The place itself is nothing fancy just really good tacos at a reasonable price. Dog friendly with plenty of parking 
Tyson's Tacos,334,Best tacos in Austin. Period. I don t know how people could write a negative review about this place honestly. I drive 20 minutes sometimes just to come here.
Tyson's Tacos,335,Great tacos and great environment on a nice day. Would have given them a 5 star if they made their own tortillas. They Tasty Basterd was our favorite.
Tyson's Tacos,336,First time here. Ordered my go-to breakfast taco  potato  bacon and cheese. The potatoes were mushy and flavorless. The cheese was shredded velveeta. The bacon was raw. Everyone loves this place and I wanted to love it too  I did enjoy the tortillas  though. That s why they got 2 stars instead of 1.
Tyson's Tacos,337,FYE-YERRRRR These tacos have been so good ever since I was introduced to them back in  17. They recently just added a new taco to the menu  the  Scooby   5 stars  My go to s are the king george  the shrimp Diablo  the tastey basterd  and the barbacoa. And that green sauce  That first chew 
Tyson's Tacos,338,I love to eat at Tysons when visiting Austin. It is such a cool little place with great taco variety. They also have beer and nonalcoholic beverages there is plenty of parking out front. The tacos are fresh there is plenty of seating
Tyson's Tacos,339,So before coming here please note that it s not a fancy restaurant with ac   it s a rustic hole in the wall spot that makes the best damn tacos I ve had in a while  I had the Tasty Basterd  surf n turf with rib eye   Crispy duck  which was my favorite   and the burnt ends taco  was disappointed with honestly   . Overall the vibe of this place is really laid back  yes there are birds flying in and out BUTTTTTT they literally won t come to you until you leave the table . Best tacos I ve had so far 
Tyson's Tacos,340,Love their tacos and one of it go to for taking out of town guests. It has a cute seating area with colorful decor and they have heat lamps and plastic offering in case of cold and rainy days. I enjoy all their tacos and mix it up everytime I go there EXCEPT for the chicken fajita taco which I found very dry and bland on multiple visits. The best deal is their 3 tacos and rice plate since you can choose from the whole menu. Also don t forget to ask for the onion cilantro mixture when you get your tacos  it s a great addition to your tacos.  Also they are open 24 hours except on the major holidays where they can close earlt.
Tyson's Tacos,341,Of the hip looking taco places in Austin  Tyson s is by far as Austin as you get. From the decor to the ukelele policy  this place screams Austin. Oh and open 24 hours can t hurt either.  The tacos themselves are big  look very interesting and pass visual appeal - taste wise I think its just ok personally. I tried the taco plate - cheap for the number of tacos you get  with rice and beans. I tried a burnt ends taco  crispy duck and pork belly and at the end of the day they were all ok  but nothing too special. The duck is very crispy and at first I thought I just got all skin in my bite  but its actually the meat - was a bit dry today. Burnt ends was alright too - its rich and fatty for sure  but no peppery bite that I m used to in brisket - the green sauce helps to cut the richness so I d recommend that. And the pork belly is also surprisingly bland tasting despite such a rich meat. The mandarin oranges provide some sweetness and acidity but felt out of place on the taco.  The rice and beans are pretty standard  nothing to write home about.  Maybe I just got the wrong things  but gotta say this place is just average...
Tyson's Tacos,342,This place is awesome and I hope they stay open. Been going here for years and can t express how great it is to have delicious tacos at my 24 7 convenience. Along with a cute aesthetic in the seating area and generally decent new different music- not the typical pop crap you hear everywhere else  this little spot is a gem. I travel a lot and promise you  most places don t get lucky enough to have places like this one.
Tyson's Tacos,343,Omg this place has...wait for it....UNSALTY Guacamole  Super fresh. Very Delicious  and lots of options. And filling 
Tyson's Tacos,344,Tyson s Taco is a very unique taco place  Their seating is technically outdoors  but they ve kind of built half a house around it so it s like indoors and outdoors. Besides from their decor  their menu is one of the largest I ve seen for a taco place  Be prepared to spend some time browsing the menu  there s so many good choices.  I got the Hoover  Wild Feminist  and Avocado Abogado tacos. You can get tacos individually or the taco plate for around  10 which comes with three tacos of your choice  retried beans  and Mexican rice. I thought it was really worth it  Very filling for sure  The Hoover was a crispy duck taco which was definitely unique. The Wild Feminist and Avocado Abogado were breakfast tacos. The AA had ribeye steak which was cooked perfectly   Don t overlook their sides either. The Mexican rice was one of the best I ve had at a taco place and redress beans were good as well. Overall  great taco place  I would definitely come again 
Tyson's Tacos,345,I cannot believe I haven t written a review for Tyson s     If you love tacos  you ll LOVE Tyson s.   Let me start by saying I work at the other Heavenly Taco place. This place ranks  for sure.   If you order corn tortillas  they give you double corn so you have a solid tortilla that doesn t break apart. The Yoda plus Bacon is my go-to  The black beans  Sriracha sauce  avocado  and cheese plus that crispy bacon is just OH so good.   The King George is another favorite. That fried avocado is bomb  It s not soggy at all. Eggs are cooked perfectly.   Can you play the ukulele  Play a song and they will give you a FREE taco.   The sides of salsa and guac and chips is good and plenty.   I just CANNOT get enough of this place   Update  New faves   King George and Diablo Shrimp   You also must try the Pork Belly
Tyson's Tacos,346,Tacos where ok just a little greasy   had a bad first experience but the owner made up for it by apologizing and offering a promo code  I would say if you have had a bad experience to let the owner know   The workers are rude but I m sure mr. tyson has gotten on to them     Especially after my long email to him  I may come back soon for a second try
Tyson's Tacos,347,So I ve eaten here about five times before writing this review. Every time I was welcomed well  received great food and left satisfied.   My orders don t change too much. I usually order the three taco plate  and I ve gotten the queso before as well. The queso and chips are good  You won t be disappointed if you order it.   On my most recent visit  I ordered the crispy duck  pork belly and fuerte fit. The taco plate doesn t limit which tacos  so I usually get the pricier ones.  Crispy duck is just what it is. The duck isn t overcooked  and cucumber with sweet sauce all join together for a rather interesting mix of flavors. The pork belly has a generous slab of well flavored fat and meat accompanied with mandarin oranges to balance out the savory pork belly. This one is by far my favorite one  but if you are one that avoids high fat content  this might not be the taco for you. The fuerte fit is just huge. There is double chicken and it s served with two tortillas. My girlfriend and I actually shared that one and it s basically the amount of two tacos.   Bonus for infused water  free taco for musicians and fireplace when it s cold. Oh  and they are 24 7 now. So when you re craving tacos any time  any hour  there is one less excuse for you to come here.
Tyson's Tacos,348,I love the Tyson s location it s quirky  part mobile  and slapped together  I also really enjoy the menu options  which are vast and delicious.  Mr. Tyson  I really miss the ball of sunshine taco.  based on my visits to the store  I would give a 5 Star... however  my rating drops hard and fast based on consistency of the  grab and go  tacos I purchase at various coffee shops. One day I ll get a great taco  the next day the same type of taco will look like the taco itself is starving  barely any ingredients filling it up. Another day it may be extremely heavy on the salt or missing the spicy mayo... I m sure large catering style orders are hard to fill  I ve done some catering so I have a bit of an understanding of production on a larger scale..   Obviously his review is both good and bad. My opinion  want a good experience with a Tyson Taco  go to the location.. want to roll the dice  pick up a taco at coffee shop the serve.
Tyson's Tacos,349,Food is fabulous  Great staff but I do find it a little overpriced. I always get the puffy chicken tinga tacos which are extraordinary 
Tyson's Tacos,350,I come here way too often  love these tacos and love the ambiance. Interesting menu  including duck  which is very good  never disappoints  little expensive but all good 
Tyson's Tacos,351,Tyson s was one of our go to place to grab food since we work overnight  and have never had a problem with them before  but today was such a mess that I doubt I ll be back.   We used the online ordering to order our tacos at 6am  were told they would be ready in 6 20  then once we got there they were out of two of the tacos we ordered. Okay  not a big deal  I took a refund for mine and my boyfriend ordered a replacement taco. We were told the one taco would be ready quickly.   35 minutes later  after two other patrons had ordered and received their meals  we finally received our one taco.   I work in food service and have a lot of sympathy for service workers  but our experience today was beyond something that I can justified. I have worked with an online system at a taco place before  and it should be directly connected to their system  so the item should have been 86 d. They also had my phone number and could have given me a call in the 20 minutes before we arrived.   But besides that  we should not have had to wait an extra 35 minutes for one taco  and should have at least gotten our order before the two people who came in after us. The tacos are definitely not worth the experience.  EDIT  just looked at other reviews and an article about the owner s racist views and will definitely never be back  and will make sure everyone I know doesn t go either  no need to give money to a racist 
Tyson's Tacos,352,Love these tacos   Best breakfast tacos I ve had in Austin. Their ribeye steak and their bacon are the best taco ingredients in town. You can order one of their popular named tacos or build your own. The prices are great also. I had a ribeye steak with bean and cheese for  2.50. The Greybeard  egg  bacon  bean and cheese  was less than that. I could barely close the greybeard due to the amount of filling. Both tacos were extraordinary. The tortilla was really good also. They have two salsas  a red and a green. The green has a great heat to it and the red is just darn good. They re very good mixed together. They also give you cilantro and chopped onion with the salsas  great for al pastor.   The only negative is that there is no indoor seating. They have a covered patio  with covers they can roll down in bad or cold weather. In summertime  it can get warm. But the quality and value of the food outweighs this single negative.
Tyson's Tacos,353,I treated my office to Tyson s for breakfast  tacos and everyone was amazed  I am so glad I discovered this restaurant on Door Dash. The Yoda taco is my fave and I was happy to see veggie chorizo on the menu. Thank you  Tyson s  for being open and for helping make our state critical staff have a wonderful start to our day  We will visit often 
Tyson's Tacos,354,Fantastic tacos  but WHAT is with the sour cream here  I make sure I keep a tub of it at home so I can bring Tyson s home without this consistent        moment when I open a side of their sour cream. Neither sour nor creamy. Small complaint when compare to the tacos. They have crispy beef tacos. I can live on these. I cannot  however  resist having them throw in a Diablo shrimp taco in as well. The queso is incredible.  I would say get it to go or have it delivered. One time a friend and I tried the shack patio full of birds. Hand to god  they not only swooped down and stole tortilla chips straight out of the basket  but one of them pooped in my friend s hair while we were eating. It s basically a food truck with covered seating that doubles as a giant birdhouse.  GREAT TACOS THOUGH MAN
Tyson's Tacos,355,The tacos are awesome   I love all the different options and that you can get breakfast tacos at any time.  I m kinda a plain jane with my tacos so I usually get the chicken fajita.  One taco is pretty filling so you don t need to order a ton to be full.  They have plenty of options to satisfy a number of dietary restrictions.  I do wish they had a taco in a bowl kind of option like Torchy s has for those of us watching our carb intake.  There is no indoor seating  it is a restaurant with a large patio.    They have online ordering  but it doesn t seem to have ever worked for me as the few times I ve used it  they told me when I went to go pick them up that they hadn t received it so ymmv with that.  While you are in the neighborhood  check out Casey s for snoballs  in the summer   or if you are there later at night  walk across the street to Mrs. Johnson s for a doughnut.
Tyson's Tacos,356,I m a food delivery driver and as such I get to try many places around central Texas  with that being said  these have been the best damn tacos I ve had  I had the taco plate comprised of crispy duck  diablo shrimp and burned ends. They were so delicious I didn t even need to add salsa to them  although I tried the salsa and it also was delicious  Also do yourself a favor and get a dirty horchata  it s an horchata with a shot of espresso    Genius    Oh and I almost forgot  they re open 24 hrs and they sell breakfast all day as well  these guys are doing it right    
Tyson's Tacos,357,I placed an order over the phone for pick up and the guy over charged me for chips and Queso  when I just ordered queso -  2.25 Price difference  and charged me for two more expensive version of the tacos I ordered. When confronted he gave me back a  refund  in cash which after driving away and counting it-- Was still shortchanged by  2.   Not the kind of business I will continue to support.
Tyson's Tacos,358,Yum    Just love this place. It was recommended highly by a friend and I know why... everything was delicious  freshly made  the sauces are dele table and the atmosphere was beautiful and boho chic with a Mexican flair and sense of humour   The shrimp tacos are  epic   
Tyson's Tacos,359,Hands down best tacos in town. I always get the same 2  Rage 2.0 and Yoda. With their green salsa  warning  it is VERY spicy. I almost always regret it about an hour later but it s worth it  . The line can get long but it moves quickly.
Tyson's Tacos,360,Love the style and would highly recommend the breakfast tacos. Served all day  Always have been one of my favs  and is a staple Austin taco place.
Tyson's Tacos,361,Best breakfast tacos in Austin  Love their extras - fried avocados  creamy sriracha  veggie chorizo  etc. you can also customize any of them or create your own. Coffee is decent also  and they re on DoorDash and I hear open 24 hours. Dangerous  Haven t tried their regular tacos but absolutely love the breakfast ones. They re my go to - I love the Rage 2.0 and Wild Feminist
Tyson's Tacos,362,Tried Tyson s for breakfast today. Food was just ok but the price was too high for the quality. Had the avocado abogado. This is a potato  amp  egg taco with 1 strip of meat and a thin slice of avocado  about 1 16 of an avocado maybe    on a store bought tortilla for  4.50. Flavor was nothing special  just competently cooked basic ingredients. I wouldn t go back only because there are much better options for a  10 breakfast.
Tyson's Tacos,363,Very yummy tacos  anything with jalape o is super spicy  The wait on weekends is pretty long  so I tend to avoid Tyson s then.
Tyson's Tacos,364,An absolute rip off. I ordered the three tacos  rice and beans plate and got TWO tacos. Ok  maybe it was an accident. We all have accidents  that s fine. My friend who also ordered the same option also got TWO tacos. This is theft  no other explanation  never eat here. While Torchy s might cost a few dollars more  at least they do honest business.
Tyson's Tacos,365,Tacos are amazing. Cute little hole in the wall spot. I legit crave their tacos all the time. You have to try the Rage 2.0 breakfast taco. My fav. Nothing bad to say about the food. What i dont like.... theres bird in there.... crows. Legit. Just flying around and staring at you. Creepy and annoying. And everytime we go  someone new is always in training i feel like so we legit wait 20 minutes on line with only one person in front of us... makes no sense as to why it would take so long to order. But besides that  love this place. Its the spot
Tyson's Tacos,366,This is the place for Tacos on Austin   I really like their pork belly one and the one with shrimp.   They re open late night which is clutch.  If you play a song on the Uke  you get a free taco 
Tyson's Tacos,367,3 taco plate for less than  10  Tacos are a good size  I would recommend this place over torchys. Fusion between street tacos and more fancy tacos like torchys.
Tyson's Tacos,368, Imagine you re a wasted  amp  shit-faced taco making genius   Obviously being wasted  you would say something like  ..um put some f ing TAKIS    But don t forget that you re also well-versed in food and flavors  so you think of  Crispy Duck and soft-boiled miso egg  -- you re all about amplifying that taco on another level.   Tyson s is that shit-faced  well-versed in flavor chef that provides all different kinds of unique combinations in a taco.  We ordered the    The Pharr East - a carnitas taco that has Takis in it  son. Who knew that Takis can provide the perfect amount of spice  tang  and crunch to a single bite. To me  that s beyond genius.  Crispy Duck - we were actually drawn to this establishment by this duck taco  but unfortunately it was wayyyy masked by hoisin sauce. If they were to slightly drizzle that as opposed to drenching it along with cucumbers  I would like it. Peking duck tacos  basically.   Miso Egg - screw your breakfast tacos with scrambled egg  a soft-boiled egg inside a pork belly taco is so hearty and great.  Al Pastor - had to try a classic. there were pieces of pineapple inside this  and it was also a tasty taco.  Expect a short-ish line and take photos with their  heart  murals while waiting.
Tyson's Tacos,369,This is usually a good experience off hours or late at night. This morning not so much. I made an online order at 9am this morning so I didn t have to wait in a long line. When I picked it up  I was given the wrong drinks at first and had to argue with them to get the right ones because the receipt on the online order was printed differently than the receipt on the bag.  There were so many people there was no where to open up my tacos and check them. The area to pick up online orders is the same place all people pick up orders and I got literally shoved out of the way by someone picking up a Favor order.   I got home and every taco was on the wrong tortilla type. The potatoes were barely cooked. I am pretty disappointed.
Tyson's Tacos,370,I love ordering the combo taco plate and choosing three tacos off the menu to eat. Their outdoor patio is also great on a beautiful day.
Tyson's Tacos,371,I m a sucker for tacos so when we passed by Tyson s on Airport BLVD  I knew we had to try it. Came here on a Sunday so their menu is limited to the brunch stuff. I had the Skywalker and the Little Pony. The Skywalker is better than the latter  the highlight being that fried egg yolk. The tacos are filled with black beans that I had to remove some because if not  I d be  holding it in  through the rest of our 4hr road trip back to HTX.   I couldn t identify what was so spicy  burning     about the Little Pony. It was almost unbearable. Still good  but the veg sausage with it was overwhelming.   Anyway  it s still a cool taco joint. A break from Torchy s  ya know   Am I sinning for even comparing the two right now  Forgive me  I m not an Austinite  the best part is the very large menu 
Tyson's Tacos,372,Meh. Tacos are small and overpriced for what they are. Tortillas are store bought  nothing special in light of places like Tacos Veracruz. Also they have a grackle problem  birds pooping on tables inside. Funky cool Austin ambience but I won t be going back anytime soon. I did really want to like this place...
Tyson's Tacos,373,Love the atmosphere and  food here  Pretty speedy service. My friend accidentally dropped her tacos and they gave her a replacement free of charge  Love supporting local 
Tyson's Tacos,374,Came for lunch on a Tuesday  Really cute spot - perfect for a warm  sunny day. Ordered a Diablo shrimp taco and a pork belly taco. The Diablo Shrimp was really tastey  It s definitely spicey  so would only order if you like heat. Unfortunately  the pork belly was super tough  which made it nearly impossible to eat taco-style. I would definitely skip the pork belly next time  and opt for a different meat or breakfast option.
Tyson's Tacos,375,I tried out this hole in the wall taco place for the first time. I was a little disappointed because I was having high expectations from it.  I ll start off with the positives. The chips and queso was really good. Definitely up there with all the good ones I ve had. I wish we could have gotten it before our tacos came out instead of after.  Now I ll talk about the tacos. The razzmataz was SUPER salty. All I tasted was salt. I ate this one first and I think it ruined the rest of my meal. The al pastor tacos were good though.   Even though I was a little disappointed with my first visit here I still think that this place has a lot of potential. Their items on the menu sounds like they would taste good. I m guessing I might have ever caught them on a bad day. I would give this place one more try and maybe I can bump up my rating next time. I hope they fix the saltiness of the food though.
Tyson's Tacos,376,Overpriced. Really greasy and low quality. You d expect something amazing for the price. The place is dirty and the staff is rude. I m not sure what could be worse. Highly recommend you avoid this place.
Tyson's Tacos,377,Yelpers are right  Tyson s Tacos are the bomb. There serve traditional tex mex tacos alongside original tacovations - unique combinations for the adventurous taco afecionado. thanks  On my first visit this weekend  I ordered the avocado abogado  steak  scrambled eggs  and fresh avocado . I also tried another taco with turkey bacon  fresh spinach  queso fresco  egg white scramble and toasted pine nuts. Both were tasty  and two tacos were definitely enough for me.   Patio seating is pleasant - a nice spot for a sunny weekend breakfast. And there s coffee  including espresso drinks.  We ll be back for sure. Highly recommended for Austinites and visitors alike.
Tyson's Tacos,378,These folks have terrific  innovative tacos. They are conveniently located and plenty of parking. They have a limited menu but what they make is terrific and very flavorful. They have vegetarian choices such as offering eggs as a protein all day. They don t get 5-stars because their eating area is somewhat makeshift  a patio surrounded by thick plastic hanging sheets . There were very aggressive birds that literally came up to people s place and stole food right in front of them  Try this place--just protect your food   I will go back  
Tyson's Tacos,379,Don t let the 24 hour service fool you  Tyson s should be among your go-to taco joints in ATX. There s stiff competition out there  but if it s variety  customization or flavor explosion you want  go for Tyson s every time. My significant other and I eat here no less than 2-3 times a month. The corn tortillas are great and there s options for gluten-free  vegans  meat lovers and everyone in between. It s our  cheat  spot and our go to for tacos every time.   Favorites  Matador Puffy Chicken Tinga Rage 2.0 Burnt Ends Taco Robinsonian Either brisket tacos Tre s Garden  vegan  Rage  vegan    Try something new every time  I ve never been disappointed 
Tyson's Tacos,380,I ve eaten at Tyson s 3 times in the last two weeks. Chances are  if you re reading this  I m there eating. I cannot stop ordering 3 taco plates. My blood is essentially congealed rice and beans at this point.   Screw this review  go there right now and order everything. Order queso  order horchata  order lemonade. Just go.   If you see me in line  lets high five. Get the ranger.
Tyson's Tacos,381,It s not what s on the outside that counts it s what s on the inside.  I m not talking about the building-it s a cute upgrade to a taco stand.  I m talking about the food.  As far as taco fillings go-Tyson s has the variety and quality of ingredients that can t be beat.  This isn t your traditional taco stand.  It s gourmet and anything but traditional.  I loved their crispy duck taco and tempura fish taco.  The duck taco is deliciously crispy pieces of duck and hoisin sauce with cucumber.  The duck fat  Icing on this taco   Every taco we had was super delicious-the veggie chorizo is good  loved their breakfast options  and their crispy beef taco is a great childhood throwback.  The problem arises with their tortillas.  They are not homemade and taste like the saddest grocery store tortillas.  The flour tortillas are dry and thin.  Taco Cabana makes their own...just saying.  The corn is better but if Tyson s upped their tortilla game...they d be hard to beat.  They lost a star for that.  Their taco insides are beautiful but their taco outside  tortilla  unforgivable.    Get the 3 taco plate deal.  8.99  for any 3 tacos and they through in rice and beans.  Best deal.  Some of their tacos can be close to 4 bucks so this for sure is the way to go.
Tyson's Tacos,382,I eat here at least once a week and have tried most of the tacos. I love the outside eating area and the general vibe of people that seem to go here.   I usually go with The King George  The Queen Barrett and a pastor taco. Sometimes I go with the queso suprema. Not really a fan of the fish tacos but I m usually picky about those so I won t fault em for it.  As previously said  I go here on a weekly basis at the least. That being said  I ve never had a bad experience. That s not an easy thing for an eatery to accomplish.
Tyson's Tacos,383,Incredible food     I m very picky when it comes to tacos  but these are some of the best I ve had. Will be back soon 
Tyson's Tacos,384,Tysons Tacos has  hands down  the best breakfast tacos in Austin. I know that s a bold statement  but I stand by it. Their tacos are unique and the menu is always changing. They also hand out salsas and onions cilantro with every taco. My only comment is that I wish their guacamole was a bit more flavorful  but I appreciate that it s not filled with cilantro  I ve said it before and I ll say it again - cilantro is truly the worst .  Parking is easy to find  and if the lot is full you can park on the street nearby. Although there could be more seating  I ve never been without a chair even when the line is out the  door   in quotation marks because it s less of a door and more of a deck . Plus  this place has that cool funky Austin vibe I ve grown to love and expect from my dining establishments. Also  you can apparently play the ukulele or another instrument and get a free taco  although I ve never seen someone do that...   Never change  Tysons 
Tyson's Tacos,385,This place is fantastic  Amazing tacos. But don t go here in a hurry  even if you order ahead. I have always ordered ahead  like hours ahead and scheduled a pickup time and it has never been ready when I show up. I always have to  wait 5 minutes  which hear means another 10-15 minutes. 5 stars for food  3 stars for service.
Tyson's Tacos,386,The tortillas aren t fresh. They are overpriced and the queso leaves a lot to be desired. Take your money to one of the better places in town that are more authentic.
Tyson's Tacos,387,Im from So. Cal which is the mecca for tacos mexican food in the U.S. So basically my bar is high. My buddy asked me to check out this 24 hr taco joint near our house and says the place always has a line. Again  I wasnt excited because i been all over austin to try tex-mex and i hate it. This place takes the cake. In ordered their 3taco combo w  brisket taco  diablo taco  and chicken tinga. Omg it was amazing. Flavorful  filled with deliciousness  and clean. The rice and beans were great and the salsa  green and red  were perfect spice. I have been back several times after and tried the surf and turf  al pastor  chicken fajita. Im consistently getting wowed and wont stop til i try them all. The best part is that this place is 24 hr. Finally Austin     
Tyson's Tacos,388,I guess this is what you get from a 24 hour taco place.  A large selection  but the tacos are barely even warm  much less hot.  The flavor is decent  but the lack of heat and the crude preparation really detract from the overall experience.  I suppose it s a good choice when everything else is closed  but I would assume you can do better in Austin.
Tyson's Tacos,389,The tacos were terrible and I feel like I m sick. Never eating there again. You should avoid this place because it s not worth it. Underwhelming food and your dollars will support racism most likely.
Tyson's Tacos,390,Do what you wish with your money. Detached service  passable food  questionable value. Funky atmosphere and competetive grackles. Never personally witnessed a table being wiped by an employee.   Nice soundtrack.
Tyson's Tacos,391,Hard pass. Mediocre food and terrible service. Also  really long waits for aforementioned food. Finally  turns out the owner is an awful person.
Tyson's Tacos,392,Don t support this place   The guy that owns this is a racist Trump supporter. Just look at his Twitter.
Tyson's Tacos,393,I love Tyson s. This has been one of my go to taco spots since my freshman year in college. I love that they are open 24 7 and that I know I m always going to get a great taco when I go. I don t love the prices here and frankly think they could be a little more reasonable  however  the tacos are really good. I used to go breakfast all the way  but recently got more adventurous and have not been disappointed. I recommend any of the tacos. They are all unique and tasty in their own way. The atmosphere here is subpar  but usually has enough seating to accommodate my party and I. Another huge plus at Tyson s is that Mrs. J s donuts is right next door. I highly recommend this combo if you are looking for a great food coma.
Tyson's Tacos,394,By far Tyson s Tacos is the best place in Austin Texas better yet central Texas to get your taco fix from  The menu is amazing from meat  vegan and pure epic. It s never a dual moment while eating here. The random songs that get played make this place even more enjoyable 
Tyson's Tacos,395,Open 24 Hours  Always SO GOOD... versatile and affordable menu. You should ggggggtry the crispy duck with extra hoisin- and every other 4   taco. Soooo many sauces too 
Tyson's Tacos,396,The only issue I have with this place is that is closes at 8 30PM  The food is great and so is the vibe. I haven t been there in the scorching heat  which I think could be quite a problem   but overall it was a great casual taco place with take out and seating. There is quite a range of tacos  which all taste good  but they are more expensive than you d like them to be. I didn t think there would be a bathroom  considering how small it is  but they have one  Not the nicest  but it gets the job done and this isn t a place you go for a nice dinner anyways.   I tried the mango dessert thing but it wasn t sweet  it s not supposed to be sweet but I prefer sweet desserts  and we couldn t finish it. If you are familiar with the taste  maybe you ll like it since I think it was made from scratch right there  but I wasn t a fan. The patio seating area is also pet-friendly  which was nice.
Tyson's Tacos,397,Either we went on a bad day or this place is totally overhyped. I got the chicken fajita  amp  brisket taco  and my bf got shrimp diablos and a fish taco.  Only thing I liked was the queso  It was creamy and reminded us of the queso at tacodeli.  Fish tacos were good  but the shrimp diablo was almost all sauce...shrimps were small. He could barely taste them. For the chicken and brisket tacos...both meat were very dry. But my least favorite thing was the tortilla. Just as important as the stuffing in a taco is the tortilla itself and ours was just cold and stale.
Tyson's Tacos,398,Two words  VEGAN BEANS. Okay  I know it s not really difficult to find vegan beans anymore  but how often do you find a place that advertises it  Plus  the black beans are pretty delicious  once you add a tad bit of salt. Personally  I don t mind adding salt  because I get that everyone likes different amounts of salt  so I d rather just flavor it myself over having overly salty beans.   My go- to is the black beans and avocado. They have a fried avocado option  but I wouldn t recommend it. It was pretty mushy. Yuck    Tyson s is open 24x7  which is nice when we are scavenging for food late at night  The staff is always pleasant and the line usually goes fast 
Tyson's Tacos,399,Delicious taco place for  11.99  Left to right Rage 2.0  Se or Ranger  and King George with double rice instead of beans.
Tyson's Tacos,400,I have waited until I have eaten here several times to review it  because I really want to like this place--creative combinations of good ingredients--what s not to like   But unfortunately  the rampant fuck-up-fest which is their order make process leaves no choice but to dock them several stars.   Why   Because every time I order  I get something I didn t order--in some cases something I SPECIFICALLY asked NOT to have. Every. Single. Time. There s nothing that sucks quite as hard as getting all the way home with your food and finding out it s wrong or  worse  inedible.   Just a couple of examples  I ordered five mecanico tacos and got bean and egg--no sausage. What s the point   Or today  probably my last visit  when I asked very clearly that NONE of my  more than a dozen  assorted tacos contain onions or cilantro. Would you think that  bean and cheese   again  with a SPECIFIC REQUEST for NO cilantro and onions  would contain both  Look at the photo of their menu. Do you see onions listed on the ingredients for Fat Coves or Bond Girl tacos   Me either. But guess what nasty-ass shit I bit into in both   Kids without breakfast because they can t eat bean and cheese with onions and shitty Mexican ditch-weed in them  disappointed family looking hungry after eating the few things that WERE as ordered  and having to chug OJ to get the taste of cilantro out of your mouth.   Really sick of this crap. Get your shit together  Tyson s. With a 20 minute wait when only four people were in line ahead of me  there should have been PLENTY of time to get the effin  order CORRECT.   El Rauncho Grande
Tyson's Tacos,401,Great tacos if you can catch them when they re open. They say they re 24 hours but I ve come in twice and they ve been closed. Super annoying.
Tyson's Tacos,402,Finally made it over to Tyson s    Had a great experience. One MahiMahi taco and one veggie one. Both were great and my order was ready really quickly.   My only complaint would be that I d love it if the patio area had some misters. I had lunch and it was incredibly hot on the little patio - not that they or anyone can tame the Texas Summer heat - but some misters would be great.
Tyson's Tacos,403,I placed an online order and was quoted 15mins  but actually took 30mins. Ordered a beef fajita taco and the avocado beef and egg taco.  The beef was really dry and the most unpleasant part was biting into a hard crispy thing.  I have no clue what it was but could ve mistake it for a nail  cartilage  or bone.  Not tasty at all.
Tyson's Tacos,404,This place is amazing.  24 7 and very quick service.  I d say I m not a fan of all the taco combinations and some are quite bad but there s enough good ones to satisfy most.  My brother says try the crispy beef tacos.  4.6 5
Tyson's Tacos,405,I m gonna go out on a limb  here  Tyson s Tacos is probably a great contender for great tacos with cool names  I also like the fact that they smoke the brisket and other meats as fillers for their tacos. Tortilla do not taste homemade and if they added that to their lineup then it would make a big difference-at least with me  Make your own or order their house-made combinations  you won t be disappointed.
Tyson's Tacos,406,I m giving this place 3 stars because it is open late and I will probably be back just for that reason. By the way I don t think the kitchen is 24 hours because as I was leaving they had a sign said closed until 6AM at the register. They didn t stop anyone from entering the eating area there though.  But the actual food at this place is not impressive. The food was very bland. Barbacoa is supposed to be one of the tastiest meats but it had no flavor. Same with the brisket taco. I added hot sauce and that was about the only flavor I got.  Also ordered chips and queso and the chips were store bought. Pretty sure they were HEB brand. The queso was decent.
Tyson's Tacos,407,We went here for lunch today. Quirky place. Not big party friendly. We actually had 5 people and we got the biggest table that seats 6. All the other tables will sit 2 or 3. We ordered queso  pork belly  crispy duck tacos  fajita tacos and BEC  amp  potato tacos.   The prices for the tacos are comparable for what you get. Honestly  I think they could get away with charging more for the pork belly duck tacos.   I would def recommend this place  Delicious and great prices
Tyson's Tacos,408,I came here after volunteering right up the road and I was thoroughly pleased with my experience. The restaurant had a really good atmosphere. It was very quaint for being pretty close to downtown. They have a wide range of selections at a reasonable price. I got their special which was 3 tacos rice and beans for 11 dollars. It was an excellent meal  at least on par and probably better than other local taco places  at a better price.
Tyson's Tacos,409,I got there at 6am today and I was the only customer there ordering tacos. At about 20mins another customer gets there and they immediately get their tacos. So I m pissed now and go to the window to ask where my two tacos are.  The lady said that they lost my ticket..... How is it that you lose a ticket and it is the only ticket there      You lost the only ticket there. The tacos are mediocre at best and they just lost a customer from this terrible customer service.
Tyson's Tacos,410,If disappointment is your preference in what appears to be  as original as possible AUSTIN independent haunt set dressed with cool so cool it runs into cold  this place has it in spades and you are probably as happy as a treed opossum grinning at a nest of yellow jackets. Yep they got the big board message right there at the order window so my journey is now complete.   Build your own taco  2 items minimum 4 items maximum  I rattled off 4 items exactly what I wanted. The order taker told me that equated to  a chicken taco w real cheese. Whatever I picked  up was about 2 1 2 items short if you call American  cheese real cheese. The chicken was so dry it resembled cardboard. Some might consider these quibbles persnickety but over 40 years in this town  the 1st 20 spent burning up the night life so I could finally settle into a career. I have seen a lot of fine eateries come and go. Some of them were exemplary  others ran mediocre. Tyson s is neither of those. Their faux hip not withstanding.
Tyson's Tacos,411,Build your own taco   Goat cheese is an option   Done and done  take my money and any hopes I had to have a beach body.  But for real I don t know who I m busy discovering this place. I ve only done the byo tacos and  queso so far but they slam  Highly recommend checking this place out  It feels super Austinie too with the outdoor seating and free fruit infused water. Love it 
Tyson's Tacos,412,Trying to figure out what I just ate. The surf and turf was like a bad dream. The Tasty Basterd wasn t tasty. Had the puffy chicken taco. It came in a bowl and had the consistency of soup. Wondering when I ll wake up. That was an odd experience.
Tyson's Tacos,413,Always delicious tacos  The people that work here are friendly and helpful. I ve never been disappointed. Cool funky atmosphere too.
Tyson's Tacos,414,Great tacos and great drinks    Super convenient to get to and the staff is always helpful and friendly
Tyson's Tacos,415,There are lots of great tacos places in Austin.  So why do I keep coming back to this one all the time it s open 24 7. There are tasty vegetarian options. It s quick - You order at the window  pick up your food  and take a seat anywhere on the covered patio area. The glow in the dark decorations are quirky  super austiny feel.
Tyson's Tacos,416,This place just does their own thing and keeps on going. They re more than a trailer but not quite a full-blown restaurant  and more than usual tacos but not quite franchise-happy like Torchy s  amp  TacoDeli. Incidentally  I kept looking around for some Anglo guy named Tyson.  The bottom line is if you can find a place to park  you won t go wrong with the all-day breakfast tacos here. They re cheap  amp  good  and use strips of bacon instead of bacon pieces. And I should probably disclose that s pretty much all I ever get at Tyson s Tacos  because I m just not all that Yelp-excited about pork belly or duck in a tortilla. Sorry.  But if you re going to go that route  their  Pick three tacos with rice  amp  beans for  9  is a good deal. And on Sundays  there s a special brunch menu in lieu of all their pork duck fish tacos. And I ll eventually get around to trying them. But in the meantime  there s always room for one or two more egg  amp  bacon to go.
Tyson's Tacos,417,This place is value for money  For less than  10  you can get a plate of three tacos  rice  and beans. If you check in on Yelp  you can also get a free cup of iced tea. My favorite is the burned ends  It s super yummy and full of flavors.  As for the atmosphere  the restaurant gave an East Austin-y vibe. It s outdoorsy  so I recommend you to come here when the weather is nice.  One thing I like about Tyson s Tacos is that it is open 24 7. I noticed that a lot of taco shops close by 3pm  and many times  I crave for tacos late at night... so I m really glad that I found a 24 7 taco shop  I can tell I ll be coming here quite often.
Tyson's Tacos,418,This was my first stop once I left the Austin Airport. We came here around 1 Am and I was surprised anything was open at that time on a Thursday morning. Apparently this a 24 hour taco place  which can satisfy your taco cravings at all hours of the day. Taco s here range from  2-5  highly suggest you get three tacos to feel fully satisfied. We ordered a mix of breakfast taco s and dinner taco s. All came out within a few minutes and were all delicious. The breakfast tacos in my opinion were a lot better than the dinner ones. All in all a good first stop for our first tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,419,Ordered online.  This is the second time I had to cancel my order with them.  When you order online  the option to receive your order is by 20 mins.  So even though last time I waited over 70 mins.  I figured this time I would leave an hour later just to make sure I dont wait again.  False.  I got there an hour later and waited another 30 minutes for an online order.  I asked them to for sure call my name out when it was ready and they never did.  Went up to the front to ask again and my order still wasn t ready 90 minutes later.  That s too unreasonable.  Horrible service  but at least they cancelled my order  right 
Tyson's Tacos,420,NOT CURBSIDE    COVID19 risk. Got an text that they were going curbside 24 7 due to COVID19. TOTAL SCAM  It s the same takeout place it has been where you have to walk up and stand around another 20 people waiting for their food.
Tyson's Tacos,421,Horrid. Hope I don t get sick.  Ordered the Fuerte  Tati s Perfect  Se or Ranger.   The pastor had chucks of cartledge in it  fajitas look like a dog nugget  all tacos cold  cold potatoes.  The green salsa look like slime but tasted better then it looked. Tortillas tasted store bought. Had high expectations with the reviews on here. Super basic.    Not sure what s the hype   coming from a Mexican dude please don t... hit up Tacos El Chilango up north Lamar for real tacos and they re open late.
Tyson's Tacos,422,I came to Tyson s for the first time at midnight in late July. This was my first Texas meal after landing home to Texas and had been bragging that I don t eat BBQ and Tex Mex out of state. I was expecting the best and unfortunately  I was sorely disappointed.   I ordered the  shredded brisket nachos.  The meat was overcooked and cubed pot roast. The queso was cold and runny and lightly drizzled. There was no guacamole on it  although it stated this on the menu .   I went back to the window and waited 5 minutes before finding the cook  who offered me guac and stated that the beef has always been cubed  despite the menu stating shredded . The guacamole turned out to be good but everything else was mediocre. What a huge disappointment 
Tyson's Tacos,423,Please keep your hours where they are  and this post will stand     Austin has almost a million people and you guys are somehow the only non-fast food option for us night owls.  Curious   I would recommend not deviating from the tacos on the board  especially the Burnt Ends  Senor Ranger  and for breakfast anything bacon.   Late nighters keep in mind they sometimes run out of burnt ends al pastor etc. and if you re ordering online they will just throw you a brisket taco but if you re hungry  that ll do pig    
Tyson's Tacos,424,When you pay  4.60 for a taco -after taxes- and tip  1 cash you expect that it be at the very least  decent. The taco I ordered today was not. It came out cold and skimpy as hell with only three baby shrimp that were smaller than a quarter. When I asked the guy at the counter if this was typical of Tyson s he just shrugged and said yes. Call me old fashioned but I feel that you get what you pay for  in this case I didn t. I included my extended middle finger in the photo to symbolize the nature of my transaction and also to reference the small size of the shrimp. I won t be going back.
Tyson's Tacos,425,I went to Tyson s Tacos earlier this week and fell in love with their food all over again  Every time I go to Tyson s I am always impressed with the food  easily one of the best taco spots in Austin. In my opinion  Tyson s is a hidden gem that the locals don t want to surrender over to the tourists   amp  I d like to keep it that way  .  Very casual  outdoor dining experience. The staff and the cooks are friendly and genuine  they want you to have fresh  high-quality food and a great dining experience.  I highly recommend this place to everyone 
Tyson's Tacos,426,Y all know I m not a Torchy s fan.   Hipster tacos don t do much for me.  But tacos that I can totally customize   Hell yes.  Rib eye steak and cheese tacos for breakfast   You bet.  If I had any negative  it d be that there s no indoor seating.
Tyson's Tacos,427,Tyson s has a vast menu amp budget-friendly prices. I ve tried many of their tacos and have loved every single bite  You can taste the freshness of their ingredients. There is covered and uncovered patio seating  the atmosphere is super laid back. The best part is that they re open 24 7  so when you re craving that late night taco or want a bite after a night out - you can count on Tyson s.
Tyson's Tacos,428,Tyson s is the best. I m lucky to have such a great place nearby that has an interesting variety of menu items made with care and taste delicious. The friendly service is the icing on top. I love the Wild Feminist and The Hank  as well as their salsa  the red and green  and guacamole.       One word of warning  don t leave your food unattended unless you want to encourage the local cannibal birds to swoop in. Tyson s does provide spray bottles for a little help combating the opportunistic grackles  so be vigilant or bring a friend.
Tyson's Tacos,429,If you want to wait 45 minutes for tacos or a hour and half for delivery this is your place 
Tyson's Tacos,430,Their taco selection is nearly as interesting  albeit more extensive  as Tacodeli s  but you get a lot more taco for your dollar at Tyson s  and best of all  they re now open 3x as much as Tacodeli  Meaning  when you want Tacodeli tacos  you gotta plan ahead  but when you just want tacos  Tyson s is  always  there for you.  Bonus  the free-taco-per-song offer posted next to the order window is precisely what they mean when they say  Keep Austin Weird. 
Tyson's Tacos,431,Tacos here are just okay. The al pastor was dry  avocado brown  and the corn tortilla was too thick. There are too many good taco places in Austin to make a visit to Tyson s worthwhile. I much prefer Taco Deli  Veracruz  and Taqueria Los Altos.
Tyson's Tacos,432,This place was super good  Got 3 tacos  rice and beans and chips and salsa. Great prices for the servings  quick service  cool music  and plenty of seating. Forgot to take pictures of the food I was too hungry. Wife had 3 tacos and her were good also.  I highly recommend this place.
Tyson's Tacos,433,My new fave taco joint in Austin  Definitely a no frills sort of place but full of character and flavor and reasonably priced for the large tacos you get. It s counter service and fast. I d fill up on 2 for a typical meal  maybe 3 if I was super hungry. Their full menu is available all day and night if you re in the mood to mix and match. My fave is the King George which has a fried avocado in it  I asked to add cheese and they put queso in it    . An interesting one was the crispy duck  a taco version of the traditional Peking duck bao . They had complimentary fruit water out for drinking and you can see their smoker out on the patio filling the air with delicious smells of smoked meat. Seating is all outdoors but covered. Somehow this magical place is 24 7   Definitely returning and bringing friends.
Tyson's Tacos,434,This review is strictly regarding their online ordering process. The food is great and I ve sat and ate in the restaurant before with little issues of getting my order. However  the last two times I have ordered online  the order is not ready upon arrival. After giving a curve of 5 minutes last time my order was ready after I inquired about it. Tonight  I arrive 8 45 with my order to be ready at 8 40. At 8 50  my name hasn t been called so I inquire. Order hasn t been started nor were they aware of the online order. Plenty of laughing and playing while I waited  however.
Tyson's Tacos,435,I eat here every time that I go to Austin. They have such a great variety of flavorful and unique tacos  and their drinks are good  too. They have a customer for life 
Tyson's Tacos,436,Good customer service. The food came out quick. Open 24 7  Feels like a taco truck  but has shaded patio with fans. For my meal I got the Brisket Taco and the Tati s Perfect 10  which was my favorite taco. It had al pastor meat  pineapple  mango  habanero  avocado  pico  and cotija cheese. It was both sweet and spicy. They have unique flavors of tacos and I ll definitely be coming back more often. I was highly satisfied with my visit. This may now be one of my new favorite taco joints.
Tyson's Tacos,437,I ordered through Favor which was not an issue here. I ordered guacamole  the Crispy taco on corn and the Crispy Duck on Corn. The Crispy taco was solid. The corn tortillas taste and feel like they have flour in them  left me wondering  but tasted good.  I don t have celiac  just like corn tortillas.  The cheese in it did a wonderfully melty thing and held it together fairly well. Classic  uncomplicated  tasty.  The Crispy Duck taco had problems  seriously. First  they put it on flour. Then I opened it up to find not much duck. This would have made me sadder except the duck was dried up  hard and jerky-like in texture--in no way crispy. I couldn t even eat it properly since when I bit down the jerky duck would not tear. There was a good bit of cartilage in there too which was awful to encounter. I couldn t finish it and I m a good eater. I was disappointed for sure  The guacamole was ok. Chips not impressive  could be bested by Tostitos  and I don t like Tostitos.  I want to give it another shot. I probably just ordered the wrong things.
Tyson's Tacos,438,Tyson s is a staple for me-- always fresh  always delicious  always open. Buuuuuuut they recently redid the menu and literally took all the good stuff off. No more fish tacos  not as much variety  especially in the breakfast menu   mostly beef options. Kind of a bummer.
Tyson's Tacos,439,I have a bit of a love  hate relationship with Tyson s Tacos. The pros of this place are that it s open 24 7  and luckily close to my house   there s covered patio seating  which is nice on good weather days but not so much on rainy ones  and they offer great service. On the flip side  their tacos can be hit or miss sometimes. I tried one of the tacos that had duck meat and it didn t float my boat at all  but then I ve also had the Prince which was pretty good. I ve never had a taco here that s blown me away  but the ones I ve thought were good were definitely above average. If you go  definitely ask as many questions as you can before ordering because it can be hit or miss. Also  I wish there was an option to tip -- I used to work in food service and feel like it s the only right thing to have that option available. Nonetheless  I d still recommend this place and give it an 8 10. It s a great  laid back spot to go to.
Tyson's Tacos,440,Got horrible food poisoning from here. Tried it again after many disappointments and got violently ill. Its so sad. I used to love this place so much.
Tyson's Tacos,441,Finally tried Tyson s Tacos and my only regret is having waited so long before doing it  They re delicious   The Pastor isn t like any I ve had before  and everything was very fresh. HUGE tacos  too.  Give them a go  they won t disappoint you.  I recommend the Tasty Basterd  amp  Pastor tacos 
Tyson's Tacos,442,I loooooove this place but like many Austin institutions it has taken a bad turn. On a Saturday night I had to wait easily 30 minutes for three tacos  that they got wrong . They have a new silly system with stickers to identify tacos  super time waster  and they started wastefully including strange checkered sheets of paper under the tacos. Some impractical management going on here. Super slow kitchen crew and the cashier was busy eating and drinking - just a ground change from the normal experience. Needs better management - stat 
Tyson's Tacos,443,I was very disappointed with Tyson s Tacos. I expected super delicious tacos with juicy  tender meat  full of flavor  but I didn t get that. I have to say I enjoyed my tilapia taco  but the carnitas I got were dry and flavorless  and the duck taco my partner got was drowning in duck sauce and all in all  made her sick before she was even done eating.  I felt gross and bloated after eating here  and I hate to say that because I know the rest of our group was fine  but this was our experience. It s cool and convenient that it s open 24 7 but I d literally rather eat Taco Bell.   _   _  
Tyson's Tacos,444,Long lines during busy hours  not sure when these are though  but it s 24 7 so go at 3pm or 3am  The amount and range of options can be overwhelming  it was for me  at least . The flavors are good but not great  and I was not impressed with some of the tacos  e.g.  fried duck . It does have great ambience for late-night eating if you re into that.  Also  doughnut shop next door is a plus  I m not a huge fan of doughnuts  but I like to get a fresh one every once in a while 
Tyson's Tacos,445,My favorite Taco place in the United States.  Sure - the birds can be annoying  but I just blow a SBD and they go away.  Some yelpers  in their reviews  state there are better Taco Joints in Austin but neglect to state them.   Please let me know  and please don t say T--hys.  Thanks
Tyson's Tacos,446,Ran into this place looking for just another taco stand  and it exceeded my expectations. There was a long line  but it didn t feel like it took us much time for our order to be taken. Their were plenty of choices to choose from all looked good only one I didn t like that I ordered was the taco with duck  it tasted amazing just the duck was fried a tad too hard  but other then that the overall experience was great 
Tyson's Tacos,447,Amazing tacos.  Really bad service.  While waiting for 40 minutes for 4 tacos I m wondering How can a place that pretty much just makes tacos take so long to make a taco  Also  A woman ahead of me ordered a vegetarian taco and it had meat on it.  Hilarious.  However  I will return cuz the tacos are that good.
Tyson's Tacos,448,I usually do not give food places in the city where I don t live 5 stars. But I really enjoyed the food here. I ordered the pok pok taco and chips amp  guacamole to go. The taco was omg in my mouth  It had a great balance of flavor  sweet and salty  and the chicken wing was nice and  crispy  The guacamole looked fresh and tasted great as well. I was pleased. Next time my bf and I will come here to sit down.
Tyson's Tacos,449,I had 3 tacos  The Tasty Basterd  Burnt Ends  and Brisket Taco. Each was better than the one before.  This place is far from fancy  but very good 
Tyson's Tacos,450,Don t underestimate the look of this shanty town-food trucky looking place.  Look for the heart on the sign and then experience the heart they put into each taco.  We tried about 8 different tacos  the nachos  which were a huge shareable portion   and horchata.  To say it all was DELICIOSO would be a understatement.  The brisket was flavored and smoked to perfection   all of the herbs and seasonings and sauces and salsas were on point.  Each taco was a small tapas style yummy burst of creative culinary flavors. The place is open 24 7  the staff is super friendly and my teenagers loved the eclectic chalk graffitied bathroom.  We will definitely be back 
Tyson's Tacos,451,First of all  this place has a Ukelele Policy. Really.  And none of the furniture seems to match. And they give ample wall space to local performing artists. The tacos are fancifully named and originally built. The picantes will give your tongue a saucy pinch. And apparently  on cold nights  you can buy and build smores   Tyson s has kept a low-profile  old Austin sense of things and obviously does not take itself too seriously. No  hand-crafted  references to be found anywhere here    This is not  however  the   git it and go  meal you d expect from a taco stand with a seasonally enclosed patio. It s an  order and wait...and wait some more  kind of place. Bring a book or your people-watching shades and stay awhile. You ll be rewarded  eventually  with an affordable  zesty  and off-the-beaten-path Aus-Tex-Mex experience. Just make sure to set your watch to Taco Standard Time...
Tyson's Tacos,452,I absolutely fucking loved this place. I love that it is open 24 7  I loved their dirty horchata. I would have given it 5 stars if the al pastor tacos were actually al pastor. I ordered 3 al pastor and it had shrimp  bacon  potatoes..Those are not al pastor. But their rice and beans that come on the side was bomb. Will definitely come back 
Tyson's Tacos,453,Tyson s Tacos follows in the footsteps of taco places that cater to people who don t want to have to pronounce anything in spanish on the menu. That is to say  Austinites. And that s okay because the food and the salsa  the salsa   is quite good   -- There will probably be a line if its a weekend -- They ll likely be out of something -- The food pickup system is janky -- It s BYOB -- The seating is limited but good for groups -- Check out the gold bathroom -- Their non breakfast tacos are super creative -- If torchys and taco deli weren t already doing their thing  Tysons would be  It s a great local neighborhood spot with good  creative  inexpensive food. Definitely think of this next time you re on a taco hunt
Tyson's Tacos,454,Me and my friend Dylan were hungry at 3 in the morning.  We decided we were hungry for tacos but nothing was really open. So I journeyed through the internet to find Tyson s Tacos. I read some reviews and decided to give it a try.  This place is always open. 24 hours. When we parked in front of a sign that said menu I thought this place was a taco truck. It was and wasn t. It had covered seats and the coolest decor. And some tables were set on top a trailer.  I had the Tasty Basterd and the Rage 2.0.  These were probably the best tacos I ve had at 3 in the morning. The service was fast and there was some cool dudes there.  I hope you all adventure to Tyson s Tacos whatever time in the day and grab some tacos. Cause they are good. I d sum it up to a more authentic Torchys with lower prices. There wasn t a taco more than  5.  Thank you for your existence Tyson s.
Tyson's Tacos,455,Well  if you were heading to Tyson s to enjoy one of their delicious  distinctive tacos like the Prince  fried fish with a delicately sweet beet  amp  goat cheese slaw  or the Pok Pok  Vietnamese-inspired chicken taco   save yourself the trouble. After months of consuming tacos like this at an alarming rate  I visited last week to find that somebody decided to change the menu--to make all the tacos variations on the same ones we can find elsewhere  all over town.  Yawn . Everything changes. Fun decor  nice hours  but nothing particularly noteworthy now.
Tyson's Tacos,456,One of my top favorite taco places in town. Even better  they re open 24 7    They have outdoor seating arrangements. Very Austin like if you ask me.   Their all-day menu is vast  serving from breakfast tacos to dinner entrees. Their tacos are normal size and I would suggest grabbing two or even three if you re hungry. I highly recommend their guacamole and queso as well. Note their chips come in huge baskets   I got their crispy tacos and Senor Ranger  res . Everything was very well seasoned.   It s very close to airport and 35. Perfect for a pit stop regardless of the time of the day. Parking is somewhat okay. There are many more behind the restaurant if you don t see any out front.
Tyson's Tacos,457,Tyson s is quite simply the best taco place in Austin. Nothing beats open 24 7  consistent exceptional quality  awesome customer service  and an aesthetic as hell outdoor seating area under giant mist fans. Get the Rage 2.0  It s my go-to.
Tyson's Tacos,458,Come eat tacos here  I know Austin has so many good taco spots you can choose from  but these are really great tacos. Went here for lunch  and had a crispy duck taco and a burnt end taco. Both were delicious.  They also have more  ordinary  options if and some really yummy-sounding veggie ones too.  Don t miss out on the homemade salsas either. Overall fun atmosphere with cool decor.
Tyson's Tacos,459,I want to give this the 5 stars it deserved mostly every time I ve been here. But I had one experience that was so bad I have to put it out there. My taco had so much oil grease in it that it was literally inedible. I can understand some oil grease. I actually usually like that  but this was on a new level. Like a pool of it. Weird thing was my mom s tacos were fine. Every other time here has been so good but that s a huge oversight to serve a taco swimming in oil.
Tyson's Tacos,460,Checked out Tyson s today and it was delicious and packed with flavor  I loved the decor--cozy and hip with fireplace. The breeze comed in from the outside because its like a patio restaurant that is sealed but has heaters inside to keep you warm. Their creamy Sriracha sauce is to die for. The only thing holding it back from 5 stars is I felt it being slightly too salty. Otherwise  great bargain  great flavors  and many choices. And hippy  tex-mex  austin-y venue   I had the following  Balls of Sunshine  a fried egg yolk taco with bacon. I loved the half runny yolk that popped as I ate it. The Rage  fried avocado vegetarian-friendly option.
Tyson's Tacos,461,Background  I eat tacos on a daily basis  of course being Mexican I ve eaten them all my life...  That being said  this place is truly impressive. I had a  Balls of Sunshine    The Rage   and a Barbacoa taco.  The  Balls of Sunshine  is truly inspired  fried egg yolks with cheese and bacon on a flour tortilla. Rich flavor  great bacon and a mound of great cheese   The Rage  was the only weak link here  but only because I m a chili head  fried avocado with eggs  beans  pepper jack  and a creamy sriracha. Flavorful combo  but wish for a bit more heat  Barbacoa  honestly it s hard to find traditional and good barbacoa in this town outside of legitimate Mexican food trailers. This rendition was spot on  it s supposed to be a bit fatty and a good balance with corn tortillas  yes plural  old school style with 2 for one taco  and great fresh chopped cilantro  amp  onion  Would definitely recommend again  and again  and again 
Tyson's Tacos,462,This is a local funky hole in the wall - if you ask for no bacon  don t expect them to care  BUT the food is amazing  Queso  even the basic one  was hot and outstanding  Honestly one of the best queso cups I ve ever had. The tacos were also really great  I tried the avocado abogado  mr george  and senor ranger.   The taco plate comes with a really small portion of rice and beans  and I can see what people are saying about the  soggy or runny  tacos but I only noticed that with the egg avacado taco - and the queso and hot sauce make everything a thousand times better 
Tyson's Tacos,463,This place does have a few pros   - open all night so you can get food no matter what  - byob  I believe so have a beer or wine with our tacos - tons of outdoor seating   However the food was super lacking for me.  The tortillas were stiff and I was super excited for a late night al pastor but my pork was superrrr tough. Got the crunchy taco which was like getting Taco Bell it wasn t bad but one bite in and the entire thing fell apart you needed a fork to eat it.  Queso was decent. All in all  would I go back  If everythhingggg else was closed and it was 3am  probably. But id try maybe something with chicken.
Tyson's Tacos,464,What a great taco place. I had the rage and my husband had the ribeye w bean and cheese. Well I had to try the ribeye. It was tender and very flavorful. It went perfect with the bean and cheese. The Rage was also yummy. It had fried avocado on it with sriracha sauce. I love stiracha sauce on everything. It went great with the egg and bacon. One of the stars here is the Green and red salsas. They are some of the best I ve ever had. Made everything even better. I could just eat both sauces with some chips. Yummy. Only reason I didn t give it 5 stars was the tortilla. Doesn t seem homemade. But don t get me wrong. It s still good. Will be back soon. Yuuuummmmy.
Tyson's Tacos,465,Homie let s talk tacos.   Are you team Torchy s   Authentic Mexican Truck    Fancy-downtown 6-bucks-per-circle-o-corn   Those all have their place.   But what is an Austin taco  The best argument can be made for a few places  El Chilito  Pacos  Torchy s Tacodeli  etc. .  That argument is incomplete if you aren t mentioning Tyson s.  Outside decor  weird  hip  relaxing and stimulating at the same time. Decorations covering one another like a layer cake of cool.   The menu  One of the more creative things at any stand like this. All the staples  plus really cool ideas  fried egg yolks   queso  and really... out-there ideas  duck and mango salsa  .  Service  Austin kind-and-casual. Salsa   onions cilantro come standard on the side.  Hours  24 7. Beautiful.  If you get enough tacos  they ll name one after you.   Also  the tacos are good  For those who wonder or miss what Austin was  Tyson s is.
Tyson's Tacos,466,These tacos are great  I had the disable shrimp  pork belly  and burnt ends and was satisfied with all 3. Great flavor  great service  and price was about right. Would come back again 
Tyson's Tacos,467,They absolutely have the worst service ever. They gave my food to someone else right as I walked up to the window then claimed to have not called my number tryna make ME look stupid then said wait we already gave it to your friend when I was alone. Then they had such an attitude about having to remake my food and didn t even give me the right quantity that I ordered and the old blonde lady was acting like I already took one out when I was right there in front of her and one of the salsas they gave me is literally in the shape of the container like jello. I even poured my own salsas and she took them all out of the bag and only gave me a couple for 6 tacos.
Tyson's Tacos,468,Love Love Love I live in Dallas and visit Austin frequently for work. I heard about this place on some tv show  can t remember exactly-Good Eats or something like that  and it sounded very interesting. It s just down the street from the office so very convenient. I ve had two of the breakfast tacos and the Brisket and burnt ends. All four  2visits  were fabulous. I m not a big fan of their hot sauces  but I m very particular. I do wish they had a pico.  One issue-outside seating  which is the only seating has a bird issue. Not like the movie as they don t peck your eyes out  but it s weird having birds watch you while you eat and try to get a nibble when you re not looking. I think birds are kinda freaky so it may just be me.  Try it  You ll like it   
Tyson's Tacos,469,I decided to give this place a try for lunch after having a so so brunch experience.  The parking lot was packed at lunch time and it does take a bit to get your order whether you are eating in or taking it to go.  I opted to take mine to go   I ordered the 3 taco plate with rice and beans for  8.99.  A really great deal seeing that some of their tacos are a few dollars each. I selected the crispy duck  steak and chilorio tacos for my plate.  The crispy duck came with plenty of meat  green onion  hoisin and a large slice of cucumber on a flour tortilla.  This was by far the best taco on my plate   I loved how crispy the duck was and the cucumber really blended all the flavors together.  I think this one was worthy of 5 stars and may have been the best taco I have dined on to date.  The steak taco was made with ribeye and served with saut ed peppers and onions served on a flour tortilla.  This one was really spicy and I felt the steak was overdone.  I think this one was worthy of 2.5 stars.  The chilorio was made with shredded pork  pico de gallo  pickled red onion and pico de gallo served on a flour tortilla.  The shredded pork and the pickled red onion were my favorite parts of this taco but  it still was a 3 star taco to me.  I would recommend getting the 3 taco plate so you can sample a couple and find the one you like.  For me the crispy duck will be my go to choice.
Tyson's Tacos,470,I got the 3 taco plate that comes with this amazing rice and beans  I opted for the al pastor  brisket and pecan fish taco. I loved each but wish I got the corn tortilla instead of the generic white wheat tortilla 
Tyson's Tacos,471,Not too bad  tacos had good taste meat was cooked very well. Tacos were not skimpy. Parking and seating are limited so during busy times could get over packed. Staff was very friendly. All and all not bad at all.
Tyson's Tacos,472,Do not get the hype... It is a cool place  with pretty friendly service. They have solid beer options and the horchata is pretty good too  though a bit too sweet to me. I think the tacos are ok  but nothing special for Austin. The tortillas were definitely the most disappointing part  tasting like typical store bought tortillas. The fillings were ok though a bit greasy. The seasoning were a little sparse and I needed salsa to get some flavor. Fortunately the salsas are pretty good  but again nothing special for Austin.  The saving grace for this place is the price to portion ratio is pretty good  but with so many good taco places in Austin I just do not see a reason to go to Tyson s.
Tyson's Tacos,473,This was my first time here and we came because my husband is OBSESSED with tacos  so let s try it  I hate tacos honestly  Today I had the best tacos I ve ever tasted in my life and I will definitely be back over and over again  
Tyson's Tacos,474,This is my favorite taco joint especially for breakfast  The king George  robinsonian  and Miya s are SOOO good and so unique  Also the guac is so fresh I ve seen them making it there it s amazing. Must try in Austin  
Tyson's Tacos,475,Tyson s Tacos is such a great place for late night taco cravings. They offer a wide variety to choose from  and I some of the offerings are very unique  The crispy duck taco is probably the best one I ve tried so far. I would recommend ordering the three taco plate  It comes with any three tacos of your choice  and rice  amp  beans. The people working were really nice and my order came out quickly. I d say this place is my top choice for a 24 7 taco spot 
Tyson's Tacos,476,Came here with my roommates in the afternoon after a night on the town - let me just say it definitely hit the spot and we were all salivating reading the menu. I only deducted a star bc the wait was much longer than expected  at least compared to other taco joints I frequent . However  the atmosphere was nice  mist fans were an excellent move for that TX summer heat  and we had queso so didn t mind the wait. Also the orange and cucumber infused water was a nice touch. I will say the queso was a bit disappointing and didn t hold up to the high bar set by torchys or taco deli bc it was very runny and didn t have a lot of flavor  maybe mix some salsa in . I had the Hank and King George. Would def order the King George again - the fried avo  bacon  siracha sauce combo was truly A1  The Hank was a bit out of my comfort zone but I wanted to try something new  and it was pretty good but not anything to write home to mom about. I mean the veggie chorizo was good but it didn t pack the same flavor as the King George so I had to add a lot of the spicy green sauce. Also I realized avocados just taste better fried. Also attached are pics of the tacos my roommate ordered  the Rage and Chicken tango. As such  I can t speak to their quality myself but according to her the Rage had an excellent balance of flavors and the tortilla held up well. She said the chicken tango was subpar as the fried puffy tortilla it was served on made it feel like  biting into a deep fryer   which may sound good to some people but in this case it wasn t. Anyway  overall we were satisfied with the food and experience at Tyson s and will be returning.
Tyson's Tacos,477,Not my first time here and not my last.  Tyson s Tacos has some of the most unique and tasteful tacos in Austin  with numerous choices available.  This hole-in-the-wall type restaurant is located near Kome on Airport and man oh man is it a sweet dive.  Menu  They really do have a wide selection of some pretty out-there tacos  today I ordered the three taco plate with rice and beans that comes out to be  8.99  a really solid deal for the amount of food you get.    Side-note - they have a ukulele at the register and if you play a song they give you a free taco  I played a song  and got a free one and oh my it tasted great.  Food   For my tacos I ordered the  - Miso Egg taco  soft boiled egg  fried avocado and crispy duck- not super seasoned but rather provides a rich  creamy butteriness that is hard to replicate.  7.5 10   - A La Tierra Taco  steak and cremini- not my favorite but still solid  a bit oily.  6 10   - Tempura taco  fried fish with a mango habanero sauce- quite refreshing and flavorful.  7 10 .  - Crispy Duck taco  free   duck  vegetables  cilantro- my favorite  really flavorful and comparable to Chinese Peking duck.  8 10   Service  Really nice people that were very warm and welcoming. The manager even came out to take up our plates  praising our singing abilities.  Overall  loved this place  satisfying meal and really unique flavors that make me want to come back again and again.
Tyson's Tacos,478,Amazing tacos. I was honestly surprised I never had tacos so good. Definitely a must go to in the Austin area. Horchata was the best one I ve tried yet. I plan on trying every last single taco on there is on the menu.
Tyson's Tacos,479,Best tacos in town   Robinsonian is bomb. Also  I m a queso snob and this place had THE BEST QUESO. if you use five star you ll get a free one on your bday and I got a free Mexican coke float too. I go here all the time so I can say with confidence that they know how to make quality food 
Tyson's Tacos,480,Really good tacos  Love that they are open 24 hours. Fun flavor combinations and names of tacos. The atmosphere is pretty cool  you may want to bring a jacket if it s cold outside. I love the additional sauces that you can get here  They are amazing. I would suggest ordering ahead during breakfast or other busy times to avoid the line. Though you can play ukulele to get a free taco.
Tyson's Tacos,481,I ve been to Tyson s before and had a small wait  but today was the worst experience I have had at a taco shop in Austin. We ordered tacos and was informed that the wait time would be 20-25 minutes  however I am still sitting here waiting for my tacos and it has been over an hour. On top of that  they called everyone up to the window to ask  what tacos they needed to make .   TLDR  decent tacos but DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT.
Tyson's Tacos,482,Very good tacos impressed  the meat is good and their decor is super cute blah blah blah bllah
Tyson's Tacos,483,Visiting Austin. Daughter s  favorite taco place. Delish is what I have to say. I had al poster on flour tortilla. Very nice flavor. For 3 of us with drinks... 18.00
Tyson's Tacos,484,Update  since finding out about the owners s tweets. Though the tacos were good  I can t support this business and won t be back   
Tyson's Tacos,485,I stopped by around 9 00 am  Sat  to grab a bite to eat. Tacos are a little over priced in my opinion  otherwise a pretty solid taco  I didn t take a picture of their menu but I m sure you can find one on here somewhere. While looking over the menu another consumer asked if we have ever tried their tacos with takis.  If you don t know what they are   they are spicy chips. Apparently this person said you can add takis to your tacos for a small fee. I might have to try a taco with takis next time  When your tacos are served they serve you two mini salsa bottles. I prefer this method of salsa dispensing. Definitely not your typical salsa  to go  containers when you decide to dine outside there. They also serve raw onions and cilantro for you on the side. Tacos are pretty tasty. Good customer service. Oh -apparently they are open 24 7   
Tyson's Tacos,486,They fuck up my order just about every time  I always order the same thing and there s a different screw up  so it s kind of turned in to a fun guessing game. still really good.
Tyson's Tacos,487,One of my top 3 taco places in Austin  Such a cute atmosphere  always get your order quickly  great flavors  Super nice staff also.
Tyson's Tacos,488,This is a great local dive with great Tacos. If you really want an authentic Austin Taco experience --any time day or night-- you can t do better.  Could use some clear vegetarian and pescatarian alternatives.
Tyson's Tacos,489,How much do I LOVE  this place    The tacos are divine  the Vibe is entirely Austin-licious  Ukulele-playing  anyone ... see photo   AND THEY RE OPEN 24 HOURS...
Tyson's Tacos,490,Stopped by to grab a taco last Sunday morning before a hike at Turkey Creek with the dogs. I ordered a Hank  which I ve ordered and enjoyed many times in the past  and my boyfriend a Migas taco  both on flour. We ordered them to go  but ate them immediately in the car before we drove away.  Both tacos were flavorful  as always  and I ve always loved their salsas  but the tortillas were cold  which makes a tortillas taste kind of raw  it was as if they hadn t been heated at all prior to adding the ingredients. The Hank was also super salty  and I usually like things salty    which I ve never experienced there before. That really ruined the tacos for us. I ve always loved their breakfast tacos over the years  and I ve given them 4-5 stars in the past  both as Tyson s and Jalape o Joe s   but I wonder if their eye toward quality and or consistency in their products is decreasing as they increase in popularity.   FYI  looks like they re filing for a beer and wine license. So beer coming soon....
Tyson's Tacos,491,Had the burnt ends and duck w hoisin sauce tacos . Great execution on both cultural crossovers. Pro tip  learn to play a song on the ukulele  play it at the register  and enjoy a free taco  thanks again  .
Tyson's Tacos,492,Just ordered from here from Favor since it s national taco day and they re offering free delivery which is pretty cool. I got the B is for Bacon and Barbacoa. I really liked the breakfast taco but I mean.... It s bacon egg and cheese... What s not to like   However  the Barbacoa was not very good in my opinion. Opening it up from the foil I felt right away how GREASY this thing was. I know it s meant to be a pretty greasy meat but my fingers were drenched and my taco just felt... Slimy. My throat actually feels clogged after finishing it    Low key worried that my arteries are already clotting up after this one taco  Also  it seemed like they chopped up an entire onion just to top this taco with. I mean I like onions as much as the next person but this seemed a bit excessive to say the least.   All in all  as a first impression Tysons seems alright. I m not digging the overly greasy taco but I wouldn t be opposed to trying the other things on their menu if I were hungry.
Tyson's Tacos,493,I m addicted to their breakfast tacos  their horchata is sooo good and prices are affordable. Down side is it s outside so obviously Texas summer heat makes having a sit down meal here not the greatest but I usually do online ordering and pick up anyways 
Tyson's Tacos,494,Well  it says closed today   Sunday  but its open  -  Brunch options also..I ve been here a couple of times and really enjoyed it. The baja     fish taco was scrumptious last time I had it   I think I added avocado and subtracted the spicy sauce   and these guys are good about adding subtracting ingredients to your liking. I am not only a white girl  hot spicy kills me  amp  it s the name of a breakfast taco here    I am also persnickety about my food so applaud establishments that don t adhere to a  no substitutions  policy.  My PEC was divine this morning  potatoes cooked just right-not greasy at all..I tasted their salsa  amp  it was too hot for me so I used my own white girl salsa. Great flavor though   roasted tomatoes maybe  and cilantro..my guy loves it   I do wish they would put a menu here on Yelp though- I know my persnickitiness can be a pain to people so I like to peruse menus before I go places. That way it sounds kinda normal when I rattle off  one PEC  extra crisp tortilla extra cheese  blah blah on the side  lettuce  couscous  maybe a tomato   etc...etc..
Tyson's Tacos,495,My go to taco place. Yeah the outside seating sucks  but other than that  the food is fresh  there are a ton of interesting options and variations  the portions are right for the price  and service is fast. Also  open 24hrs   You get a star for that alone. I haven t met a taco at Tyson s that I didn t like. I much prefer Tyson s over Torchy s or Tacodeli. They don t even compare.
Tyson's Tacos,496,I recommend going with at least one other person who likes to share as they have such a wide variety of delicious and interesting flavor combinations that its hard to choose. I liked really liked the Mahi Mahi taco I ordered and the pork belly taco Husband ordered  the latter had a nice Asian seasoning. I did find the fish and meat to be a bit dry. They also offer an interesting range of drinks although we chose to stick to the horchata  which was good but definitely on the sweeter side. The seating is all outdoor but its plentiful and nicely shaded and the decor is nice. As a bonus they have a bunch of old cookbooks to peruse while you wait for your food.
Tyson's Tacos,497,Tyson s  let s get real for a second...  When this place is actually open  amp  fully functioning  the tacos are delicious. The guisada reminds me of the best I ve had in my hometown on the border  especially if you add beans  amp  cheese to the tacos. The Sunday brunch is tasty  amp  worth the line that might form periodically at this little hut on Airport Blvd.  But I ve driven by at 7 45 pm on a Tuesday  6 50 pm on a Saturday  8 20 pm on a Thursday and they are NEVER open when they say they are. Closed right at this moment even though the Yelp page says  open until 8 30 pm . How can you expect consistent business if you don t keep consistent hours  Really disappointed.
Tyson's Tacos,498,The queso was awesome until the hard  cold piece in the center was discovered.   Tacos - just meh... had an interesting flavor to the tacos and eggs - almost like they had been washed in dirty water.
Tyson's Tacos,499,Not bad. Had the burnt ends taco. The brisket was burnt for sure. Not much flavor from meat. Guacamole was fantastic. Clean bathroom. Lots of birds in rafters pooping all over the place. Has charm.
Tyson's Tacos,500,This is 100  the best tacos I ve had  ordered them through favor and they re unreal. Cheap as well. Definitely recommend  We ve ordered them for the past 2 weeks now atleast every other night 
Donut 7,1,It s good food fast especially if you call in an order. My favorite is the sausage egg and cheese croissant for five bucks you can t beat It  Yum yum yum    I was curious and wanted to know what the 1 star reviews were about. They seem to be from dog owners who think that they should be allowed to bring their dogs into whatever restaurant they want.  Most restaurants don t let pets in.
Donut 7,2,I am absolutely floored by how much I like their cake donuts. They aren t greasy or have a small crunch on the bottom.  They are truly cake   I cannot speak to other donuts  because  well  obviously.   The employee I interacted with was very friendly.  The store is surprisingly spacious for a donut place. Plenty of seating. It s very airy. Parking isn t very difficult either.
Donut 7,3,I honestly am unsure why this place is so highly rated.  The donuts are fair but leave an odd aftertaste.  The filling i had in a Bavarian-filled was extremely tiny.  I was already home when I discovered it  but would have asked for another or a refund.  I haven t tried their tacos or kolaches but as far as donuts  there are better places nearby.
Donut 7,4,Perhaps I can see the love this place gets since they offer a number of beloved items and do them all well. I won t say that this place is magical or worth singling out  like round rock donuts . If you re in this area and want donuts  then this is on top of the list. If I actually lived by this place  I d probably give it 5 stars.   The migas taco is pretty good. They load these up  I wish the veggies were a little saut ed or grilled but they were definitely fresh. The tortilla is soft and fluffy in texture  but doesn t have that much flavor.   The donut holes are textbook standard. Nothing you haven t had before but still satisfying.
Donut 7,5,I LOOOVE this place      Too much all at once   What can I say   let s start with hidden gem  amazing owners and staff  delicious simple and resonalby priced quickly made fresh food. At first glance you might think   well there are hundreds of these Kolache donut shops around Austin what makes this place better or worth the drive    I ve been eating breakfast before work or school on weekdays at Donut 7 since 2014 and it was just such a part of my routine for several years I completely forgot to review the place . My deepest apologies lol I didn t mean to keep it a secret . Not that it hasn t made a name for itself there are lines to the door for one special thing they make better than anyone else . Blueberry Donuts    Yes they have amazing Kolaches big and small sizes spicy jalape o and regular kolaches along with some of the best breakfast tacos this side of the Domain but OMG the blueberry donuts are amazing and usually sell out .         If you don t want sweets I did mention tacos yes I will say it s hard to resist a good taco especially with so many to choose from . A simple bacon egg and cheese with their homemade green or red salsa is always a winner with bean cheese and chorizo a close second . They also have loaded homemade breakfast croissants and Biscuits if your not in a taco having mood. Either way you will leave asking yourself what you ve been doing for breakfast all your life . Not really but had to get the point across haha have an amazing day shop local and explore more often   Cheers ...
Donut 7,6,I come here just about every weekday. I get the same thing 99  of the time  Mexican steak breakfast tacos. If it ain t broke  don t fix it. Always greeted with a smile and respect.
Donut 7,7,Great croissant breakfast sandwich and tacos  but wasn t a big fan of the donuts here. The bavarian cream donut barely had any cream in it  and the cake donut seemed a little off to me. I have a  donut lady  back home that makes the best donuts  so I am spoiled as its hard to find anything that compares. I do love how they have fresh coffee  plenty of seating  and tons of options though  So  it s surely worth a try at least.
Donut 7,8,Had chorizo and egg taco and later a raspberry filled donut.  All were delicious.  I waited a while before eating the tacos and they were still hot due to how they wrapped them.  First time trying them out and I ll be back
Donut 7,9,Picture this  you re six years old  your parents took you to your local donut and kolache place as an early weekend treat and your little face is pressed up against the window drooling... that s how I feel every time I go in here.   The softest kolache dough and donuts that aren t over glazed  chefs kiss . It s dangerous having this just around the corner at any given moment
Donut 7,10,For such a popular place  I thought there d be a line out the door but luckily no line on a sunny Sunday morning  but there weren t a ton of donuts left to choose from. I got the Apple fritter  blueberry  chocolate and chocolate sprinkles as well as two sausage  egg  cheese croissant. I would have gotten the one where they can fill it but they didn t have any normal fillings I like like custard or jam. Maybe I ll try it next time.   All were delicious  fresh  thick and fluffy. The blueberry donut was my fav. I do wish the donuts were bigger but then again  they are a good size for not over eating. The croissants were so good too    Service was friendly and fast. They had no issues with me carrying my dog inside to order. I ate outside  I just wish there was more seating outside in case it s busy. I highly recommend and will be back 
Donut 7,11,Super solid yummy donuts  exactly what you re looking for in a classic  cheap donut. Breakfast tacos are surprisingly fire  specifically the bean and cheese.
Donut 7,12,Yummy breakfast tacos and the coffee is good. We forgot our wallet there on accident  called and they kept it safe. Thank you 
Donut 7,13,Friendly  fast and clean donut shop. You can tell the owner cares a lot about this business. Thank you for the great service 
Donut 7,14,Food is okay. However customer service is the worst. And I noticed them acting racist too. Never coming back again. Change your attitude we are all humans. I asked my donuts to be warmed and I believe she is the owner  she put it in for 5 seconds when other clients of the other race got 25 seconds . I noticed it myself.
Donut 7,15,Great atmosphere inside  and the place was extremely clean  Classical piano playing in the background gave superb vibes  The kolaches were very soft and delicious. The donuts did not disappoint either  The cake donuts were soft and flavorful  no dryness    specifically liked the blueberry and chocolate  Was not very busy when we first got there around 7 15am Saturday morning  but when we left around 7 45am there was a small line.
Donut 7,16,Perhaps the best donut shop in all of Austin. The doughnuts are superb  with a wonderful selection baked fresh each morning. Coffee is delicious and everything on the menu is very reasonably priced.   What has kept me coming back to this donut shop morning after morning is most definitely the atmosphere. The place is family owned and clearly shows it in the friendly greeting I get from the owners and staff when I walk in. Classical or seasonal music plays at a soft volume in the background. Tables and chairs are comfortable and welcoming. All aspects of this donut shop are tailored to give you that classic  morning donut shop  experience. I have enjoyed every time I have visited this place and intend to come back frequently in the future.
Donut 7,17,In a town that loves dogs  Donut 7 doesn t like our furry family members  and they don t want your business.   I ve been kicked out twice now while stopping by on a dog walk. The first time after I ordered  but this morning I was kicked out as soon as I walked through the door. A very aggressive employee yelled at me twice from behind the counter while waving their arms   NO DOGS   NO DOGS     With so many options in or near the Domain  there s no need to stop here. Dog lovers aren t welcome.
Donut 7,18,They re just as pleasant from when I first came here 4 years ago. I haven t been in a while and I mean a WHILe but my husband went recently and said the main lady asked for me and how I was doing-- now if that doesn t speak for their customer service and how well they try to get to know their customers then I don t know what does  The food is still as good as it always is   Try the Mexican steak taco   I also got my friends into their kolaches. Love this place and glad they survived through the pandemic
Donut 7,19,Fantastic donuts  really good breakfast tacos... a great place to pick up a casual breakfast 
Donut 7,20,If you re not from Texas  you re probably going to say Shipley s or Dunkin s is the best you ve ever had. But  if you re a true Texan  you know for damn sure LOCAL ALWAYS WINS. Donut 7 has instantly become my favorite in Austin.   The tacos are made to order  so you ll always have a fresh hot taco within minutes. The Glazed Donuts  Perfection  soft  doughy. Kolaches  YUM. I can t even form full sentences because those were my exact thoughts while eating ALL OF IT.   This is also one of the few spots in town where they take covid seriously  They have deli paper for you to open the door with  the drink fridge has been blocked  and tables have been set aside.
Donut 7,21,I love this place  they aren t the best kolaches I ve ever had but they are super consistent  the place is clean and the couple that run it are always the sweetest  This place is a giant YES from me 
Donut 7,22,We live in the area and seriously cannot stop going here.   - Their breakfast tacos are made fresh and so tasty.  - The breakfast ham  egg  and cheese croissant is seriously addicting  not sure how they get the cheese to taste like this but please keep doing it.  - My fiance loves the sausage  egg  and cheese biscuit. - Any kind of donut we ve tried here is so fresh and melts in your mouth.  If you re in the area  must try  Also  since we are mid-COVID  they are taking a lot of precautions such as plexi glass  to-go only  social distancing and all of that fun stuff to make you feel safe 
Donut 7,23,To all the folks complaining about how dogs are not allowed at this place and then proceeding to give the place 1 star.....WHAT IGNORANT IDIOTS      First  Texas law prohibits live animals  including dogs  in restaurants where food could potentially be contaminated.   Second  there are people allergic to dogs and pet  hair dander. I don t want your dogs breathing near me or my food. I love animals and have pets  but glad they are not allowed in a restaurant.   Third  yes  there might be 100 different restaurants that will allow your dirty dogs in there but you won t find one that has donuts as fresh and delicious as this place. It s a clean and tidy place  and glad they are keeping it that way. So have fun eating at one of your dog friendly  dirty restaurants that have no regard for the cleanliness  sanitation or  law food safety.    So before you start giving 1 stars to a 5 start restaurant  check yourself. Don t be such a selfish narcissist  Love this place. It s top notch.
Donut 7,24,Donut 7 is a hidden gem  They have fresh  delicious tacos  my favorite is the chicken fajita. Their coffee is by Texas Coffee Traders and is better than their competitors not too far away.. The staff is friendly and cheerful and you can tell the owners take pride in their business. It s always clean inside and they have classical music playing. You should check it out 
Donut 7,25,Amazing food  donuts  kolaches and fajita tacos. Great to dine in and enjoy the experience with such fresh food.
Donut 7,26,I am always for mom and pop donut spots. This place appears to be super popular and the lines can get long  but that s probably because they have more options than just kolaches and donuts.  They are very efficient fast in getting those lines moving though. I only ordered their cold brew and donuts kolaches so I can t speak for their tacos...but if it s anything like their donuts  I bet they d be delicious.  Super soft donuts and delicious. Definitely worth stopping off at this place if you re grabbing breakfast for yourself or your family  because OPTIONS  baby   
Donut 7,27,I ve been dropping by for almost a year now and it s still consistently the best little spot by my home  I love it  Keep it up donut 7     
Donut 7,28,Donut 7 smacks  We picked up some donuts  cold brew and tacos this morning for my job and it was great  Coffee was local  delicious donuts  and beef fajita was bomb  Thanks guys  See you soon 
Donut 7,29,Great spot for a quick breakfast run. They have donuts of course  but also breakfast tacos and sandwiches. The donuts are pretty good  the blueberry cake donuts are my favorite  The breakfast croissant sandwich so good but can be on the greasy side sometimes. I like the iced cold brew coffee too. If you don t want to wait  call ahead on weekends because they get busy 
Donut 7,30,Usually really like this place but I just went and there was so many egg shells in my tacos. Definitely won t be going back.
Donut 7,31,I was just there a few minutes ago and had two fresh made bfast tacos and donuts. Great food  great coffee  great service.  I also observed previous person who just posted with a 1 star review. He walked in with two dogs inside the store. By Health Code you can t bring pets into enclosed areas. Staff person was kind and said you could put the dogs outside while you ordered and you chose not to. She was just following the rules.
Donut 7,32,My Favorite breakfast shop. There breakfast tacos and breakfast croissants are delicious. Sometimes I get lucky and walk in while they re playing musical compositions from The NutCracker  Mozart  or Beethoven. Great way to start my day. Highly recommend.
Donut 7,33,We ve been going to this place for quite a while now and the service and food have always been amazing. It s our go to spot whenever we have to provide breakfast for out of town guest. Absolutely love their food.
Donut 7,34,If you re in the mood for delicious breakfast tacos  donuts and or kolache  get thee to Donut 7. Nice size breakfast tacos made fresh on site.  Well priced and 2 tasty salsa options.  The hot jalape o salsa  the green one  really is hot which I appreciated.  Husband and I had the Migas  local veggie mix specialty with egg  amp  cheese   amp  a yummy jalape o sausage kolache.  Both were really good and the bread on the kolache was soft and fresh. My husband also said the donuts  are very good and he s a donut connoisseur. Super clean inside and friendly service.  2 thumbs up
Donut 7,35,These people are the sweetest couple ever   The person on the cash register is almost always the wife and the husband is always grabbing the donuts. They make a very good team. They are so friendly  I always feel welcomed when I come in.   Donuts    The donuts are reasonably priced and are delicious  warm  and FRESH    They always taste fresh no matter what time of the day it is. The thing that is weird about this place is that when you purchase donut holes  they charge you per donut hole which is unlike any other donut place I ve been to  it still comes out to be pretty cheap for like 6 donut holes.   Tacos    Alright I recently tried the tacos for the first time ever and it was probably the best decision I d ever made. First of all  the egg  is real egg. It s none of that imitation egg bs that some fast food restaurants love to use. The bacon is so crispy and salty and just perfect    The TORTILLA is what I loved the absolute most  it had a crispy crunch to it but not like a tostada. It had the perfect combo of crispy and soft  you have to try the tacos  for  2 a piece  they re def worth it    If you re in the neighborhood  give this place a go  They are awesome.  D
Donut 7,36,This is a great taco shop.  They have great donut holes and a nice selection of drinks but can we talk about the tacos   This little donut shop makes fresh to order tacos.  What a difference and SO yummy   Even the salsas are legit.  I get it delivered most weekends but occasionally pop in and eat there.  Not a bad little donut taco shop 
Donut 7,37,Really wonderful local breakfast spot. I ve gone here twice and both times I ve ordered a Bacon  Egg and Cheese Croissant and a Sausage  Egg and Cheese taco to split and enjoyed my meal. We also ordered a large to-go jug of coffee and the server was kind enough to fill a large cup of creamer for us along giving us with cups and stirrers and anything else needed.  I lucked out both times as I had no line when I walked in and by the time I walked out there was a line to the door. It seems fairly popular with people eating in and taking their orders to go so I ll take that as a good sign. With no line and my order above  I was in and out in roughly 5-10 minutes with freshly cooked food. I m usually tentative about ordering eggs from quick-serve breakfast places as they often look like airplane food  but Donut 7 cooks them fresh and is worth a few extra minutes spent waiting. Service has been wonderful both times as I ve been greeted by the same woman and man with large smiles who seem genuinely happy to be helping you.   I d absolutely recommend this spot for a quick  quality breakfast 
Donut 7,38,Good food  The coffee is nice and strong and the donuts are fresh. They re not super fast for grill orders  but they are very polite and it s worth the wait for made to order food. The migas tacos were the best I ve ever had  I added potatoes . The bisquit sandwich was good but overpriced at  4  it s smaller than McDonald s .
Donut 7,39,All of the staff is extremely friendly which is why I m giving 3 stars but today I was just so grossed out by my sausage and egg biscuit that I had to throw it away. It had a weird chemical taste to it like it was cooked on something that didn t have all the cleaning products washed off of it. The store also had a strong chemical smell too and I think they were trying to air it out since they had the door propped open on a snow day... I get that we need to be extra sanitary because of covid but it shouldn t be to the extent that my food tastes like chemicals.
Donut 7,40,Came in here for a quick bite before shopping - wonderful service and great food  Will be coming back again
Donut 7,41,been going here for 3  yrs. Tacos are so fresh  service is great  and love that the owners are there.   My kiddo and husband love the kolaches and tacos. And i like that I can get a healthy taco option.
Donut 7,42,I ve been loving this place for the past 2 years or so since I first set foot in here. It is a husband and wife team who run this business and they are very personable  and always remember us and our super non-changing orders. If I remember  I prefer to call my order in  that way I don t have to wait once I arrive. Highly recommend this as sometimes it can get pretty crowded depending on what time of morning.   I usually get breakfast tacos and they are always good. The salsas offered are also excellent  if you re into spice. Doughnuts are good when you want dessert to go with your breakfast. Iced coffee is strong and a solid option. I always come back to this place  they re great 
Donut 7,43,So I went in there this morning to order donuts and chicken taco and as soon as I walked in The lady owner said oh no sorry you have a dog I can t let you order   What does this lady thinks gonna happen    The dog going to jump on the counter attack her I m not sure why I can t order food to go But would love to her explanation and reasoning behind behind her stupid Theory   Guess what lady there s 100 donut shops right around the corner    Don t go here not dog friendly     
Donut 7,44,Donut 7 is a nice donut place owned by a Korean    Couple. Donut 7 has strange opening hours that are reminiscent of Nervous Charlie s. From 7 AM to 2 PM. Be prepared for donut 7 to not have flavors of your choosing by 11 AM.   Their donuts are solid  and better than most of the donut places served at East Austin or downtown. The glazed donut was only  0.75 without tax  and  0.90 with tax. You can t beat a donut that s cheaper than a dollar.   In interior is quiet  but clean. The napkin holders at the tables are cute  and the bag your donuts come in are cute too. Agreeable too because I DO deserve a break with a donut.   There s plenty of parking at the shopping center Donut 7 is located at. At least by late morning. The parking will be terrible early morning because Summermoon Coffee is also next door. If you can t find any parking at the shopping center  then tough luck because street parking isn t available.   Donut 7 has a wide mix of people. I mostly saw families with teenage children or college students looking to satiate their sweet tooth.
Donut 7,45,Listen  I don t know what addictive additive is in the blueberry muffin doughnut   but I don t care. That s the doughnut talking. DELICIOUS  GRATIFYING  ADDICTING. How about that maple long doughnut  Hello  I love you. Donut 7  I heart you.
Donut 7,46,Whoa  this place is really good  I don t normally rate donut shops  but this one deserves it.   Mom and pop run business  and you see the owners working here day to day. That means that you will get quality and love in everything made here because they won t let any punk kids ruin their product that they worked so hard to create.   I stopped next door at Summer Moon for a coffee and came here for donut holes  kolache  and a migas with bacon taco. Everything came out fresh and quickly. The donut holes were better than what you d get at Shipley s  I consider them the standard . There s even a chocolate version that was really tasty  though I preferred the glazed- they did half and half for me. The kolache has an almost sweet bread with a nicely salted and juicy sausage inside - perfect blend of meat and bread. Don t get me wrong though  it s no Czech Stop kolache with giant sausage  but I would get it again for sure. Finally  the migas with bacon taco was solid. They had it out to me within 2 mins - you can see them cooking it immediately after I ordered. Good taco  You won t find a better one in this strip  not even at Summer Moon.   So support this mom and pop  they ve worked hard and it shows. Would gladly come again.
Donut 7,47,This is an awesome spot  Not only are there fresh baked donuts  amp  kolaches but made to order fresh breakfast tacos and croissants   Plus freshly brewed yummy Texas Pecan coffee. The owner and his wife are super friendly. They made us feel right at home and the customer service is exceptional. There is soft music in the background for a relaxing dining experience. The restuarant is very clean and with just the right amount of seating. The prices are very reasonable  With breakfast tacos  flour or corn tortillas  only  1.95. Donuts 0.90 to  1.05 each  kolaches are  1.35. My husband  amp  I are visiting town for 4th of July weekend and found this neat little spot right around the corner from our hotel   So good      
Donut 7,48,I come here almost every week to bring in a quick breakfast for coworkers. The service is so kind and friendly. There is sometimes a line but it moves quickly. Their donuts are fresh and delicious and great breakfast tacos. So inexpensive-check it out 
Donut 7,49,A combination taco and donut place  It doesn t get any better for one stop breakfast shopping  The tacos were hot  tasty  plentiful  and made to order. The filled donuts were a real treat - select a plain donut and they inject it with either raspberry jam  bavarian cream  or lemon cream. A very nice donut variety  Found a new breakfast place 
Donut 7,50,The donuts are ....well donuts. Nothing special but still tasty and unfortunately unhealthy.   Also had quite a variety of breakfast tacos which were really good.   Staff was nice and they got my to go order ready pretty fast.   When I went  there was about 10 people in line and it went pretty quickly.
Donut 7,51,Nicest staff ever. This little mom and pop donut shop is run by a very nice couple that make some of the best and affordable breakfast food you can find.  When you enter and sit down you may get the vibe that you re kinda like in someone s home and they re serving you a comforting breakfast. Notable are certainly their donuts which are made fresh and are not greasy  great with a cup of coffee or milk. Their kolaches are equally as good  part of me wished I had a bigger stomach so that I could buy more  because they re all very affordable  Not many places cane you get a nice breakfast for under  4.  Of course again the couple that runs this tops it off  they make this place feel like a very welcome and homely place.  I certainly will have to make a trip back one day for breakfast.
Donut 7,52,If you re reading this  you re probably like the many others who have listened to the other Yelpers out there who ve already scoped out this place.  The people at the counter are seriously friendly and cheerful  korean lady took my order and korean man warmed up my kolache    chipper and fun it s alarming how happy they are in the morning.  Must be waking up to various breakfast foods everyday that make them so happy.  I clearly need to realign my life goals to aspire to be as happy as they are every morning.  Ordered myself some migas breakfast tacos and giant sausage and jalapeno kolaches and husband got himself some chicken fajita tacos.  They have different selection of tortillas where previously it was just flour  I got corn  my favorite and saw for slight surcharge you could get it on wheat and added cheese.  Droolage over the donuts  got ourselves some bottled water and coffee and we waited on the tacos to be made for 5-10 minutes.  Counted only 5 small tables to sit around so it s a small place  but their food is to be taken seriously.  Is it dangerous that this is just a 5 minute drive from my home  
Donut 7,53,I can t say much for the donuts here since I ve only gotten the plain glazed  but what I do come her for are their breakfast tacos. They re cheap  made to order  super hot when they come out   and super delicious   The store is run by a super nice Korean couple that seem to have a ton of regulars. They re also next to Summer Moon which is one of my favorite cafes so you can get some tacos donuts and pick up some coffee next door.
Donut 7,54,Came here on an early Saturday and tried a jalape o cheese kolache. Tasted great  service was quick  food was heated in a microwave to make it warm and soft. I m so glad I don t live closer or I would want to eat one everyday.   Saw several other types of donuts  but I already knew I needed fuel for the day since I d have a late lunch. Kolaches come in small 3-4 inch sizes and also something like a 6-8 inch.
Donut 7,55,Not only do they have great tacos and donuts but they are actively trying to prevent the spread of COVID19.     They put wax paper dispenser  amp   a sign on the door to use a piece of the wax paper to pull the door handle.     There are many big businesses and food establishments ignoring this common point of contact transmission. As a pharmacist working on the front lines I would like to applaud their extra efforts. Thank you 
Donut 7,56,I love the tacos  donuts  and the friendly folks who work there. It has a little dining area  and I enjoy people watching while waiting for my tacos  which always come out hot and well made.  Some taco places just throw premade eggs in a tortilla. Everything here is cooked in demand. Anyways  good tacos. Good donuts.
Donut 7,57,Best donuts and breakfast tacos in the area  I work close by and love to stop in for a donut and a freshly made breakfast taco. Sometimes my husband  who also works in the area  orders the croissant sandwich and apple fritter. You can t go wrong starting your morning here 
Donut 7,58,We love Donut 7   It s by far our favorite place to get breakfast tacos.  Our daughter loves the donuts  too.  The staff is so friendly.  We visit there almost every weekend because our experiences there have been so great.  We highly recommend it.
Donut 7,59,I love this place  Their donuts and tacos are delicious. They are very kind to let people drink their lates from Summer Moon while having their breakfast from here. And their customer service is great  They are very friendly. Definitely recommend this place 
Donut 7,60,This is a great little place and the employees could not be nicer  I have enjoyed everything I ve ordered here  but the jalepeno kolache is a favorite 
Donut 7,61,Cute mom and pop shop with great breakfast tacos and they have pecan coffee   The salsas are great and the prices are reasonable  
Donut 7,62,Checked out this place out after reading the reviews and I m so glad we did  Clearly a local favorite  we each had a sausage cheese kolache and the bean cheese and bacon breakfast tacos. PHENOMENAL. They cook breakfast tacos to order and that freshness comes through from the first bite. If you want a different kind of bite  add their house green salsa.
Donut 7,63,Great Tacos  Biscuits  Croissants  Donuts  Coffee and so much more   Love their small location  wish we could have a dine in experience ever since because of COVID-19 we haven t yet. But still a chill  fast and easy to order place. I ve gone around 11 am and it s been chill  no long lines and staff super friendly  Always great to visit 
Donut 7,64,The blueberry donuts are AMAZING. Easily the best thing they do. Great bacon egg and cheese breakfast tacos too. Just a simple everyday donut shop  but it s the best one around. Also love their cinnamon roll  cinnamon sugar  old fashioned and glazed sprinkle donuts. Plus the staff are super friendly. Love this place.
Donut 7,65,World class breakfast tacos with even better salsa.  Everything we ordered was fresh and excellent.
Donut 7,66,Hands down the best croissant bacon egg and cheese EVER  Seriously too good for words. The best breakfast in town.
Donut 7,67,Incredibly good breakfast tacos. Scrambled eggs like mom makes. Thick cut bacon. The red and green sauce has just the right amount of heat. Fresh tortillas. Not to mention a price that can t be beat. What more is there to ask for 
Donut 7,68,Perfect  2 taco   I got the Potato amp Egg Taco and it was quite substantial...A very good and generous amount of filling and taste for the price. If you are looking for a quick bite and a store that s up early this is your Togo place. They have traditional House Coffee which also was brewed really we ll for the  2 cost.
Donut 7,69,Not sure why I have never reviewed this place as I was a regular customer for years when I worked nearby.  I began going when an elderly couple ran it and then when they retired a young couple came on  and I was worried  but the donuts are still great.  You get a hearty greeting when you walk in the door and it s almost always bustling with regular customers.   The donut holes are airy  bite sized  morsels from heaven.  As a person that took a long time to come around to kolaches  I have to say their rolls are delicious and so is the weird little hotdog sausage.   They have a cake donut that s glazed with coconut shavings on top and it s an absolute fave of mine.   This is the better of the two donut shops on Burnet between Anderson and Duval.
Donut 7,70,Super happy with this experience. We got there and no line. And after we ordered there was a line almost to the entrance XD that s how locally popular they are   I m a kolaches girl so I m pretty picky. Well this place takes the cup   Perfect meat to bread ratio and taste sooo goood. I did get the jumbo tho to be clear. Pay a little extra so worth it. Normally other places too much bread...usually by the end of the kolache I just rip the bread off. Nope  not here totally ate it all. Also got custard filled donut Mmmm. Variety of tea choices. I m a Hot Tea kinda gal but they def got fresh brewed coffee too.   I m not from Austin so as I was leaving for my long drive home back to Houston well I definitely went back. Oh did I mention they got breakfast tacos   Which are also bomb. Super good homemade tasting salsa. Overall best low-key mom and pop breakfast joint. Oh and it s Cheap     Also note you wait in line  order then pay and sit and wait for your order to be made.
Donut 7,71,Underrated taco and donut shop  Their tacos are made to order and are honestly so good especially for the price. It s an unassuming breakfast joint but they really do a great job with everything. Huge fan of their donuts as well 
Donut 7,72,This is a great shop run by great people. I ve seen a number of reviewers comment on the nationality of the owners  but I don t see how or why that matters in a world where 23  amp  Me knows more about our heritage than we do ourselves ..  Customer service  experience  efficiency and the food itself are what I care about.  I love that this shop is across the road from my condo. They open early enough to fit my schedule. I don t keep much food on hand at home simply because I m only home for a few hours each week and we have plenty of food at my office so groceries tend to expire before I m able to consume. Even though donuts  kolaches  tacos  croissants etc aren t healthy by any means  there are some mornings  especially as of late... pregnancy cravings are real  where I just don t care about the calories - Mama wants kolaches  They re consistently delicious and  exactly what I need in my life.  I used to come here on my way to client appointments  yes  I used to bring breakfast  and all of my clients always had positive feedback on the donuts.  I also love that the staff is able to recognize me whether I ve just rolled out of bed or am fully made-up and they know my go-to order. They re great people. They re also able to get orders out with amazing speed. I m so grateful for these people and their business.
Donut 7,73,The owners provide a big smile and a spirited greeting for customers  every single time.  You cannot walk out of here in a bad mood.  Coffee is a generous pour.  My go to donut is the chocolate glaze with sprinkles  it comes in a cute paper bag imprinted with   You deserve a donut . And yes.....yes I do  
Donut 7,74,This place is GOOD  Such amazing flavor  super kind staff  and great menu. We ordered potato egg and cheese tacos - they were so incredibly good. Maybe the best I ve had in north Austin. Certainly worth stopping at this place.
Donut 7,75,What a gem  I recently visited Austin for the weekend  and a local friend raved about the donuts and breakfast tacos at Donut 7. She said she loved to start her morning off with breakfast tacos and snack on the donut holes and coffee through the morning  dream morning  right     so I knew I had to try them out    Each taco is  1.95 for scrambled egg   sausage  bacon  chorizo  migas  or potato. Cheese is an additional small charge  but you should definitely add the cheese  I ordered bacon  egg  and cheese and potato  egg  and cheese. These tacos were no joke  Let them rest just a few minutes if you can resist after they come out so the cheese is super melty. My favorite was the bacon taco since it added a perfect crunch to offset the egg and cheese. I also really enjoyed the potato taco. Next time  I would add bacon to it also   healthy  to give it a little more texture. Everything is so affordable  so you can mix and match however you like. Make sure to grab a few of the little cups of salsa they have at the counter to dip your tacos in    Now for the donuts. We split one old fashioned donut  which was delicious  I will definitely try the blueberry cake donut next time since it seems super popular. As suggested by my friend  I grabbed a dozen donut holes on the way out for  2. Holy cow  These were perfection. You could tell they had just made them as they were super light and fluffy. They were a perfect treat. I also loved drinking their Texas Pecan coffee with the donut holes    Check out Donut 7 asap for delicious donuts and tacos. Our order came out super quickly  so you don t have to worry about being late for work  Make sure you grab a  2 flat bag of a dozen donut holes to munch on for the day. Of note  they also have fajitas tacos if you re looking for lunch 
Donut 7,76,Just left from this location near the domain  I found a long hair in my breakfast taco. I m a black male  I know for a fact it wasn t my hair. I am very disgusted and will not return  Make sure you check your tacos  
Donut 7,77,Great service and good coffee. Awesome place to pick up doughnuts before work and if you re looking for something a little more filling they have breakfast tacos too. Really love this convenient shop.
Donut 7,78,Come here often than most...enjoy the location near my house   good parking even tho i visit very early mornings.. Great service   yummy cinammon rolls they are soo addiciting  fresh coffee   they as have tacos and breakfest croissants as well kolaches .. Nice decor .. Fast service   will be back  Thanks dnut 7  
Donut 7,79,This donut shop is my go to donut place. I love it so much  The owners are always greeting you with a smile when you come in. I went there 4 times a week before... Kinda ashamed but hey  a girl s gotta get her breakfast  They already knew my order.   Breakfast tacos. The bomb.   I still remembered the place before it expanded  This place is great      
Donut 7,80,Donut 7 is a donut shop ran by a super nice Korean couple  it s in the same complex as Chilantro and Summer Moon Coffee Shop.   I have to say that this is my favorite donut shop in Austin  My tummy is really sensitive to oily food. But the donuts here aren t oily at all  so even if I stuff my mouth with 3-4 donuts  my tummy is still fine    I don t end up going on a trip to the restroom after haha.  Chocolate glazed donut with coconut flakes on top is my favorite  Workers are all so friendly and welcoming. Love this place 
Donut 7,81,Love the bag design  and a pretty solid donut. Sweet and fluffy as it should be    Also quite inexpensive  You can buy dozens and mix-and-match them as you please.
Donut 7,82,Stopped in this morning and was greeted by the lovely couple behind the desk. I ordered a small kolache which was warmed and served immediately to tide me over while I waited for the made to order breakfast taco.   To me the small kolache was good  nothing amazing  but a solid product for sure. The thing is it s stature was immediately dwarfed in my mind by the fresh hot breakfast taco. Served almost immediately after being prepped it was warm and delicious and the contrasting temperatures of the cold mild salsa against the piping hot breakfast beast was a welcome battle. Ultimately taste ran supreme.   I d totally go back if I am ever again in the area.
Donut 7,83,Great food and coffee. Staff is friendly. Wish there was a vegetarian option for kolache and sandwiches. Can do sandwiches without meat  but would like to see avocado or something else besides egg and cheese.
Donut 7,84,I finally made it up to Donut 7.... I wanted to be so impressed but ...... it wasn t bad at all  it just wasn t impressive .  I ll break it down   Service - quick and friendly   nothing great but nothing not great.  It was busy so our exchange was quick but nothing to complain about.  Donuts- I got a glazed and chocolate sprinkle .  Early morning donuts in my opinion should be warm.  As busy as this place was I would think the donuts would be coming out hot and fresh.  Yes  they may sit for a little while but still remaining warm.  These donuts had been sitting for awhile as there was no warmth.  They were smaller than some of my other favorite spots and they were just average.  Nothing life changing here.  Taco- I grabbed a potato egg and cheese taco.  The salsa is awesome   Taco was bigger than our average breakfast tacos off a truck  but again  they weren t life changing .  I had a craving and it satisfied it .  Overall  it s a good little spot but I wouldn t go out of my way again to stop in.
Donut 7,85,Swung by to grab some cake donuts and kolaches for a business event.  The cake donuts were inhaled by the team quickly and most asked where I bought them.  I didn t even get to eat one   I did buy both regular and croissant style kolaches and did have one of those and the cheese and sausage were both great.  No hard chunks or soggy stuff around the dough.  Will be back for sure  
Donut 7,86,Never would I have imagined writing a review about a donut shop  yet here I am writing a review about a donut shop. I am always studying next door  wanted to grab something to ear prior and their breakfast tacos were so good I had to review  Made fresh to order and their salsa verde complimented the tacos very nicely. The bacon was actually crunchy and not soggy like most bacon comes in breakfast tacos. So good 
Donut 7,87,Donut 7 is the best place to get breakfast tacos near the domain hands down. The tacos are made to order  super hot  very cheap  and amazing. The owners a nice and always greet you with a smile  The kolaches and donuts are good as well. I recommend ordering ahead on the phone if you have a big order to avoid the wait.   TLDR  AMAZING breakfast tacos
Donut 7,88,I m not typically a big fan of donuts  but I will come back here for their blueberry cake donut every single time. It just has the perfect amount of moistness and sweetness and is dense without being too heavy. The chocolate cake donut is also really good  and I don t usually like very chocolatey things.  They also have plenty of non-donut options. The breakfast tacos are simple and straight to the point. They re also pretty sizeable and come with a good amount of mild salsa on the side. Cheese will cost you a little extra though.  The people who run the shop are super friendly. My boyfriend has been coming here frequently enough to the point where they ask if he wants  the usual   2 chocolate glaze and 2 chocolate sprinkle donuts .  I always have a good experience here - good food  good prices  good people. What s not to like 
Donut 7,89,If you re having an off morning...come here  Seriously. The owners are so peppy and friendly you can t help but smile when they greet you      Donut prices are a little pricier than other mom  amp  pop shops but they really are fantastic  They re fresh  soft and light  amp  not overly greasy  You almost forget it s a donut you re eating  I got a chocolate and glaze and both were fantastic. I ll be back for these babies  I think they go for 80cents each or 7.50 a dozen. Cake donuts are 90 cents a piece I believe.  I also got a migas breakfast taco with cheese  2.30. It was yummy and an ok size... Though not as generous as Torchy s. Comes with a side of salsa. They make it after you order so it s hot when you get it      Watch their hours and days. I forgot what day I tried coming before but they were closed when I got here...
Donut 7,90,Their breakfast taco s are fantastic  Hearty  reasonably priced and face-melting  The wait staff is incredibly courteous for the early morning hour and I got my food very quickly.  I love the migas  the bean  amp  cheese and the bacon  egg and cheese tacos all with jalepenos. The green sauce is thick  fresh and made of nuclear fire. Oh it s so good. I m still sweating from the tacos I just ate.
Donut 7,91,If you come after 10am  be prepared for slim pickings. Don t you dare complain because this place opens at 6am and people gotz to eat yo   I usually roll in around 8 45ish before I head into the office and selection is still uh-mazing.   I love their jalape o  sausage  and cheese kolaches...they have a nice kick to them. I also love their breakfast tacos. I love their donuts. I love their donut holes. I love their croissant sandwiches. I mean...I pretty much love everything single item I ve eaten. It s so freaking delicious   The couple who owns this place is SO friendly. I didn t go for a while and when I popped in  they remembered me. When you sit and watch all the people coming in and out. They pretty much remember everyone and lot of the times  they remember their orders. Wowza.   If you want to support a local  family run kolache donut shop  this is the one 
Donut 7,92,A great spot for a quick breakfast  I couldn t believe how great the prices were for all the items. I enjoyed glazed donut holes and a sausage and egg breakfast soft shell taco. The employees were extremely friendly and greet everyone with a smile and a good morning  Definitely a hidden breakfast spot in Austin.
Donut 7,93,How have I not yet reviewed this place   Just stop reading and go.  The tacos are great. The kolaches  donuts  coffee...etc. everything is wonderful. To top it off  the owners are so welcoming and sweet. Very attentive and helpful. The shop is so clean. I always make sure to leave for work a little early so I can stop by here. I suggest you do the same   Try the tacos  They come out super fast and hot. I recommend the migas taco with cheese 
Donut 7,94,This is my first post to Yelp  I thought this place was so delicious  I had to let the world know  They have fresh donuts and hand crafted breakfast tacos.   The chorizo is my fave    Thank you for your contribution to my taste buds  
Donut 7,95,The epitome of customer service.   I used to live in the domain area  but have lived in Denver for over 2 years. We walked in today while visiting and the owners said   You look different    The donuts  kolaches  and of course  breakfast tacos are all top notch  but the people who run Donut 7 deserve the highest recognition 
Donut 7,96,Always best service and awesome donuts  love this place tacos are my favorite over here
Donut 7,97,I ve only started coming here recently since I work nearby but I really like this place  Their breakfast tacos are big and tasty and their donuts are...donuts. I ve never had a bad donut so I m not really sure how to rate that. Hehe  The people who work here are very pleasant too  Great start to my day  Edit   also the green salsa for the tacos...I don t really taste the spice like my friends do but my sinuses are always clear after eating it      
Donut 7,98,This place is delicious. The cake donuts taste great and the kolachies are perfect. The tacos are good too. Really everything tastes good here. Plus the people here are very friendly.
Donut 7,99,Wow  This place is great  I ve only been twice but will definitely come here any time I m thinking of good breakfast to go  or even there  it is adorable    They have a wonderful assortment of donuts and kolaches  so many different kinds even with croissant  delish  What really puts them at the top is that they also offer made to order breakfast sandwiches and tacos  and lunch tacos  and salsa  and they are DEVINE  One more thing that really really makes them the best is the service. The owner clearly cares and wants to be successful. She is SO NICE. I accidentally came in 5 minutes to close the other day and she couldn t have been happier to help me  I don t like to do that but the level of service I was greeted with was unforgettable. What a lovely lady and delicious place 
Donut 7,100,Just another donut shop in my opinion. Nothing bad  nothing special. Migas taco was decent  the salsa was far too mild  the donuts were your typical mix made donuts. Was hoping for more.
Donut 7,101,Great food and service  We ordered breakfast tacos and breakfast biscuit. They were amazing  The coffee was also really good and fresh  The staff was beyond nice  Great place 
Donut 7,102,Great breakfast tacos  kolache  and doughnuts. The only thing I wouldn t recommend is the coffee.   And asian couple owns the shop and are very friendly  The prices are right. Simple food  they re not trying to do anything fancy but it all works.   I recommend the carne guisada and the cheddar jalapeno kolache
Donut 7,103,fresh made to order tacos.  I ve been coming here for a little while and they never disappoint. Family owned  AJ  owner  or his wife greet you with a friendly smile and great service.   it s a hidden gem.   I always get the beef fajita taco and migas taco. My partner in crime always gets the ckn fajita taco. They re always piping hot and tasty. They re not huge or oversized. But they hit the spot.   Don t be a snob. Check this place out and give them some love.   Coming soon  avocado 
Donut 7,104,Great cafe with excellent choice of baked goods and coffee. Service is excellent and very clean store and bathrooms. Very reasonable prices.
Donut 7,105,This place has such wonderful donuts and breakfast tacos made to order  Even better is the really sweet couple that own it and are so friendly every time I go it. I have high donut standards and this place is great   
Donut 7,106,I want to give this place my money  specically the couple all of my money. My interaction time with them was short but they felt like the nicest most genuine human beings in the world.   Also they had tasty jalapeno cheese kolaches and sour cream cake donuts.  Super nice couple. Good salty and sweet breakfast snacks.
Donut 7,107,It saddens me to do this but I ve lost some of the  hoopla  I used to have for this place. Maybe it was an off day. I don t know. But my friend wanted a donut a little while ago and talked her into going to a place we have been in a very long while. She was up for that cause we used to get their fajita tacos all the time  over a decade ago  and she loved them as I did.   We arrive  food selection still even though its 10am. And we pick out our cravings  a little extra for the hubs at home and the kiddos.  We pay  which I noticed their prices are higher than river city  and round rock donuts as well  go to the car  head back to work. By the time we get there  its just blocks from this place  our bags are so new hate saturated in grease. Not my biggest fan.   Get in our office and open our bags.. The chocolate filled was weird tasting... Not really like chocolate  kind of wangy. Didn t like it. Didn t eat it. The lemon filled  too sweet  too much filling  didn t eat it. Picked a piece of fritter off  It is to be taken home  its too thin  greasy  and way too much icing. Damnit.   Im not really sure if it was a bad day  or if  this is the way its always been and my taste has changed  or if I ve just had other stuff better and this just didn t stack up.   Bottom line... I ll give their fajitas another try one day  but not likely the donuts. I already feel the heartburn coming...usually happens within minutes of eating greasy food. Not happy.  Sorry donut 7 but today  you disappointed me  a lot.  3 stars for service alone.. They are still the sweetest people ever....but the dodos were not up to par.
Donut 7,108,My first review as a resident goes to the first place I stepped foot into  Donut 7. The morning after moving in  I was sitting in my living room with boxes scattered about. I wanted to pick up something quick and close to home. The app recommended Donut 7 for breakfast so I made my way over.   I couldn t find it at first since there s construction. Apparently their temporary storefront banner fell  but once I found it  I walked in to my new favorite place.  Nowadays it feels like every place I walk into is my new favorite place lol.    The owner is very friendly and outgoing. We had a quick chat and she told me a bit about the tacos and suggested I get two. I went with a Migas. Egg  cheese  and crisp veggies rolled into a tortilla.  It was the correct decision. The tacos are made fresh and are delicious.   I haven t had the opportunity to try one of their donuts yet. They re always out by the time I get there. I ll have to get up extra early    It s probably hard to try yet another breakfast taco place  but don t hesitate to give this one a chance.
Donut 7,109,- Not being hit by a wall of sweet so strong it makes your eyes burn as you walk in   Check. - Greeted by a warm  smiling couple   Check. - Freshly-made breakfast taco  ready within one minute of ordering   Check. - Tasty apple fritter  and whatever that light twisty thing is   Check. - Donuts sometimes filled to order  so they don t get mushy inside   Check. - Cake donut  yes  I said cake donut  so light and tasty that my gluten-allergic wife wanted to risk a second taste   Check. - Jalapeno sausage kolache  decorated with a cute sliver of jalapeno on top  where the  pig  is not overwhelmed by the  blanket    Check  sorry  ate too fast for a pic   Unfortunately  they are closed on what some of the best people call  Donut Hole Sunday .  But I ve enjoyed everything I ve had there.  Since I m always supportive of good  friendly family-owned business  and can be home with my stash within 6 minutes  7 stars from me  Donut 7  rounded down to 5 .  NOTE   It s clear from talking to one of the owners that the current renovations at that shopping center are terrible for business.  I ll sacrifice and visit when I can  to help them get through this tough time.    
Donut 7,110,Pretty good little doughnut shop. Run by a very friendly couple  I assume  who greet me cheerfully every time I come in. They have a nice selection of doughnuts and pigs-in-blankets  which they warm up for you. Also a good selection of beverages.  And it s right around the corner of my work  so that s a plus 
Donut 7,111,Haha  my favorite kind of Yelp review - ever go someplace just because a Yelpie friend raves about it and you re really not expecting all that much but you get a made-to-order piping hot breakfast taco for a  1.65 and the last cruller left at 10 30am on a Thursday and you suddenly find yourself in your car wolfing them down before the light turns green and you do a double-take and exclaim   Damn    Pffft  that happens to me all the time.   Angie L loves Donut 7  she got an ROTD for it  and we need to convince her to have an ROTDC here. Oh  I ll definitely be there. It s a fun couple running the place  I didn t understand a word they were saying  so I ll be the one nodding up and down and pointing at things and exclaiming   Damn  
Donut 7,112,We tried the donuts.  Plain glazed and a custard cream filled.  It was late morning.  The selection was still good and the donuts still tasting fresh.  Best part...no old oil taste.  My son rated the donuts a double thumbs up.  Will definitely be back 
Donut 7,113,Honestly came here because the reviews are amazing and it popped up on places to eat for breakfast and I must say I was not disappointed and I know why it got such great ratings.  I came around 10-10 15 in the morning and just like other reviews said the doughnuts were running on the thin side so those must have been delicious just like everything else.  I ended getting two breakfast tacos and man were those things delicious  they were made fresh when I ordered it and it wasn t badly priced either at 1.65 per and additional toppings at .30 cents.  I was able to chat with the owners and what a lovely couple they were. So nice and humble and appreciative of having new customers. They chatted me up until the tacos were done.  Love this place can t wait to to try more things off the menu   If you are in the area or not and you want some quality breakfast tacos swing by and I ll have to try a doughnut soon and update the review   
Donut 7,114,Great customer service  yummy donuts and fresh made breakfast tacos  Some of my favorite in town  
Donut 7,115,What a SURPRISE. Highly recommend this place for breakfast. Donut 7 s breakfasts were freshly made.  The biscuits will melt in your mouth   Coffee was good. Service was very good. The restaurant is very clean. Nothing negative to share.
Donut 7,116,Light and fluffy donuts.  Proper breakfast tacos.  Friendliest people.  The right price. First time here and definitely won t be my last. Steady stream of people picking up and the service is speedy  Great spot. No need to go elsewhere for coffee either  Texas Coffee Traders   
Donut 7,117,Great donuts and mouthwatering kolaches from a relatively non-descript shop. The employees here are really friendly. On a recent trip to Austin  I grabbed a chocolate bar and a sausage kolache. I don t think I made it back to the car before the donut was gone and as I was driving away I actually contemplated turning around to get another kolache. Oh well....next time   Tip  Get there early    When they run out  you re out of luck   Enjoy 
Donut 7,118,VERY generous breakfast tacos  That s right  no skinny tacos here. The chorizo filling is spicy and full of flavor  too. Of course  they make donuts  and what amazing donuts  The cream filled donuts are not filled until you order  and you get to choose what they are filled with. I ve never seen that before. The ladies behind the counter are buzzing around  talking  laughing  and you cannot leave that place without a smile. Delicious  inviting  fast  and friendly  I ll be back 
Donut 7,119,This was a cute place for a quick and delicious breakfast  Tacos were great and not crazy expensive. Donuts were warm and fresh 
Donut 7,120,This place is now open 7 days a week  I have only had their tacos which are cheap  and filling. Expect a tiny wait if you come on a weekend. Some folks order tacos by the dozen so it can take some time since they make them to order. The owners are amazingly friendly. The place is cute. They have nice coffee  as well.
Donut 7,121,Locally owned by a wonderful couple. They fill the filled donuts to order so they won t get soggy. They also have amaaaazing breakfast tacos for a great price. Cheese costs extra but it s worth it.  A plus factor is that Summermoon is next door so you can grab your delicious breakfast tacos then a fancy coffee drink all in one spot. The customer service here is always superb. The couple that runs this place are always beyond friendly and helpful.
Donut 7,122,Omg this is my new favorite place. Donuts and kolache is delicious. Try the jalape o kolache because it is so spicy and good.
Donut 7,123,I know it says Donut 7 and they do have amazing donuts. The blueberry cake is my favorite but the breakfast tacos are also amazing  Yup migas breakfast tacos plus all your favorite classic ingredients at the donut shop  Oh and when they ask if you want salsa say Yes  It is just as amazing as everything else here  Love the owners too  they are so nice and welcoming  Great ready for them to say MORNING  how are you   
Donut 7,124,I ve been looking for a convenient stop to pick up breakfast tacos on my way to work  and I believe Donut 7 is my new favorite. My bacon and egg tacos were made-to-order rather than pre-made and sitting under a heat lamp  and the green sauce was spicy and flavorful. The staff was also very cheerful and friendly. Didn t quite get to five stars because the bacon wasn t crispy  but definitely will try again soon 
Donut 7,125,The donuts were good  the kolache bread was sweet  and the croissant sandwich was pretty dang good   The only thing that lacked for me was labels on the donuts. I didn t really know what I was looking at  and I would have appreciated that.  Otherwise  the employees are sweet and everything was tasty.
Donut 7,126,Awesome sausage egg breakfast tacos  much better than their bacon egg tacos. The sour cream donut was great too  Makes a great place to grab breakfast on your way to work.
Donut 7,127,Stopped by after my daughters volleyball practice.  Found it on Yelp.  Good place.   Very nice people who work here.  I will come back anytime I am in this area.  Food was good I had the Migas taco.   Donuts were great.
Donut 7,128,Great kolaches and donuts  They also serve breakfast sandwiches and tacos. Very reasonably priced. Very nice couple owns and runs this place. If your in a hurry this place is a perfect in and out shop  Good coffee as well. Check it out 
Donut 7,129,This place really is 5 out of 5. I d give it a 6 if I could. Family owned  which I like . Always offering friendly service  amp  fresh made goodies from tacos  to kolaches  to donuts. I like to buy their great food for family  friends  co-workers  and out-of-towners. Everyone loves it. Also  the green sauce is excellent  and the red is too  
Donut 7,130,Donuts are good but the Kolaches are even better  Friendly service and like the custom made to order breakfast tacos
Donut 7,131,Delicious kolaches and donuts.  Thoroughly enjoyed the food and decor  Can t wait to return
Donut 7,132,Had the croissant kolache  chorizo  amp  egg breakfast taco with cheese - both delicious  Hot coffee  house blend  was strong and smooth. Clean bathroom  spacious seating and friendly service. Pricing was also very reasonable. Highly recommend.
Donut 7,133,Food is good but it is extremely overpriced.  2.00 for 12 donut holes is a joke. If you order breakfast tacos  be prepared to wait and potentially get skipped by someone ordering behind you  this has happened to me multiple times.  I go back because of the location and food quality  but the price annoys me. 20  price cut and they would be incredible and affordable.
Donut 7,134,I live down the street from this place and I have been wanting to try them for awhile. Today was the day and I wasn t disappointed. I grabbed two blueberry cake donuts and two chocolate iced glazed donuts. All four were delicious. Plus the customer service was awesome 
Donut 7,135,Breakfast taco was quick and delicious. Donut was amazing. Staff is super friendly. Awesome shop 
Donut 7,136,The owners are very nice  Their breakfast tacos are great  try them with the salsa...amazing    and the donuts are good   Plus.. I love how early they open 
Donut 7,137,I will admit that I am really picky about my donuts. I d much rather drive 20 minutes to Mrs. Johnson s or Round Rock for a great donut even though there is a mediocre donut shop not even 3 mins away from my house. Well  I would drive to Donut 7... but not for the donuts. I d come for the TACOS. When I last came here for breakfast with a girlfriend  we were both let down by their yeast donuts  the very definition of mediocre . But we were both pleasantly surprised by the awesomeness of their breakfast tacos  She had a potato and egg taco  and I tried the chorizo with egg. Both were generously-sized and tasty as heck  So I definitely recommend swinging by Donut 7. Just don t waste your precious 300  calories on the sad  sugar styrofoam rings they call donuts. Get the tacos 
Donut 7,138,The couple that runs this place are some of the kindest people I have had the pleasure of meeting. I have been watching some of my fellow yelping buddies check in here for a while now. It is located about 3 miles down the road from my office  and I have been looking for another marketing idea.  I stopped in last week and ordered a couple of dozen kolaches- half plain sausage and cheese  and half jalapeno sausage and cheese. My apartment leasing agents loved them   Today I stopped in for a sausage egg and cheese taco and 1 jalapeno sausage  and cheese kolache. The same couple greeted me with a sincere smile and asked me to come back. I also thought it was cool that an elderly couple was just sitting in there having their coffee and sharing the morning paper. My breakfast was great  and I will definitely be back 
Donut 7,139,Favorite place to grab some kolaches and coffee on the way to work. I am always politely greeted when I enter. Sometimes the line is long in the morning but it always moves super fast. I love their kolaches  donut holes and croissants. Their pecan coffee is my favorite. You can also bring in your own coffee cup and you will only be charged for a small coffee. Super cheap  great quality and people who really care.
Donut 7,140,Fresh is the name of the game  here.  I work up the road from Donut 7 so I ve visited on more than a few occasions. I m actually surprised I ve yet to pen a review  or  type  I suppose .  Their donuts are great. The glazed is among my favorites in town. The donut holes are equally delectable. My all time favorite donut will always be the Eclair Long John Huge donut with chocolate on top and a Bavarian creme filling. What s great about Donut 7 s variation is they fill it TO ORDER. I ve NEVER seen that. If  for some reason  you are insane and don t want the filling  That s cool  too. I will warn that their filling is unique- not quite the normal custard  but more of a Korean type custard  similar to what you would get in a delicious bun from an Asian bakery. Still delicious  and I still eat it all the damn time. I ve ordered the kolaches for work parties a few times and people loved those as well.  So  yeah  the donuts are pretty good. But  really  the star of Donut 7 is their egg dishes. The breakfast tacos are not what we are accustomed to as Austinites. We re used to Tex-Mex  Mex-Mex  cheap and rich and delicious and tacos for days. You won t get any legitimate breakfast tacos here  but what you get is just SO DAMN FRESH AND DELICIOUS that it refuses to be forgotten. Seasoning  Spot on. Cheese  Perfectly melted. Eggs  Expertly prepared. All of this  made right in back by a super friendly man who obviously cares about what he does. The friendly lady up front  She cares  too. The only drawback  That salsa aint that impressive.   A few days ago  I opted for a cheese and egg croissant and let me tell you... it was one of the best versions I ve had. I m really not sure where the croissants come from or how they prepare it  but I know that when the waitress took my order  I gave her a smile and in minutes was sitting in my car  fattying it up  and just going crazy over my sandwich. I tried to go back to order the same thing at lunch  but it was closed  please cue crying emoji .  The donuts wouldn t really keep me coming back  even though they are good. The tacos wouldn t satisfy a taco craving at all. But I will be god damned if Donut 7 isn t the closest thing to a home cooked  heart pumping  lovingly fried breakfast item you can get in Austin. I ve seen so many reviews praising the owners and their friendliness- that s all true  but the real game changer here is the love you can actually feel in the food. The eggs. Man... those eggs.  I love them  too.
Donut 7,141,Great breakfast tacos and really good donut holes  and probably donuts    I would definitely come back here if I were in town again and in the area.   Employees all nice and friendly and the space was clean
Donut 7,142,Best donut place ever  Dunkin  Donuts and Krispy Kream don t even compare. Blueberry cakes are especially phenomenal. Everything tastes clean and fresh. Plus the owners are wonderful people who always manage to put a smile on your face.
Donut 7,143,This place is great    Tacos are made fresh to order and I love their salsa- they have the creamy green salsa that I love. I have yet to try the donuts but they look delicious 
Donut 7,144,Charming shop with sweet staff. The donuts appear to be made in-house and are very fresh. Their breakfast tacos are also delicious. Perfect place for lazy weekend breakfast afternoon pick me up donut.
Donut 7,145,Ho-Ho-Ho   Donut 7 is soooo kewl I tell ya.  Small simple shop  fresh doughnuts  good kolaches  and extremely nice owners.  That combination makes this first timer a many timer.    I haven t had a doughnut in a long time  poor little old me  and once in a while I get a craving for some doughy goodness.  Since doughnuts are fried  full of sugar  and an item listed on the Surgeon General s  Don t Even Think About It  List  I prefer to seek out the best quality possible.  If I m going do some damage  I mind as well make it well worth the while.   Enter Donut 7  who s gotten some recent attention on Yelp  so one day I made it over to the west side of Burnet and found it nestled between two other establishments that are also on the  Don t Even Think About It  List - - a Chinese Buffet and a Karaoke Bar.  Oh geez.    Inventory was scarce since it was almost lunch time but I was able to find enough for a mixed half dozen   2 jelly filled  raspberry and lemon   a chocolate and a strawberry icing  a cream filled chocolate  and a sugar.  Throw in a jalapeno   cheese kolache  pretty please.   The owners are extremely nice  he told me their cake doughnuts were very popular  I m not a big cake fan since they are a bit heavy and feel like a cannonball once they settle in  but he threw one in anyway along w  a glazed.  That was really nice  so I decided to give him some immediate feedback.  I took out the cake doughnut  not expecting it to be anything special   took a bite and was like - - whoa - - he s right  this is pretty darn good   Best cake doughnut I ve had  so fresh  you could tell it was recently made.  The jelly filled were awesome too - none of that stale or extended shelf-life-taste  they were exactly what you d envision a doughnut should be - - damn good.    The kolache was pretty solid  I liked the dough  it s lighter and the sausage had a kick.  Overall it was well worth it - - excellent customer service  very nice people  and fresh tasting doughnuts.  Even the Surgeon General would be happy and pleased.
Donut 7,146,Omg I almost don t want to tell the world about this place but I won t be that selfish  First of all  they have  donuts  breakfast tacos  fajita tacos  kolaches and biscuits. MADE. FRESH. DAILY. Everything is delicious and inexpensive. The staff are friendly and quick and they FILL THE ECLAIR WITH THE FILLING OF YOUR CHOICE RIGHT THERE SO IT DOESN T GET SOGGY. What more could a girl ask for 
Donut 7,147,Great place.  Good baked good and great coffee.  The owners are honest and great people.
Donut 7,148,Store is run by an extremely nice couple  very good service. Nothing fancy with their donuts or tacos. They re cheap and a consistent with their food being freshly prepared.  Good quick breakfast
Donut 7,149,Love this place  The staff is so friendly and the food is delicious. A lot of donut breakfast places like this feel so shabby and run down  Donut 7 is the opposite  The decor is beautiful and so relaxing  a great way to start your day.
Donut 7,150,Really great and dependable breakfast staff. I usually just get tacos. Staff is very nice. They are definitely closed on Sunday or they would of seen my tearful hungover face peering through the window.
Donut 7,151,This place was excellent for my little family on a Saturday morning. The ambiance is not going to blow your mind  but the food  donuts and coffee were perfect preparation for a big day at Zilker Park. I had a breakfast taco which was fine but the salsa made it excellent. Donuts were awesome. Coffee was great for us  as we seek carry-out cups. The workers were genuinely friendly and helpful. Lots of seating. Excellent for families.
Donut 7,152,I love this place  I have been eating donuts and breakfast tacos here for a couple of years now. Fast service  quality food  and the owners are super nice and respectful. If you want great donuts and a breakfast taco this is the place.
Donut 7,153,You cannot go wrong here.  The Korean couple who owns the place are so hospitable and kind. The doughnuts are light and super fresh. The kolaches are solid - really good bread. In the wake of the recent doughnut fads... doughnuts with bacon  doughnuts with bananas and bacon  doughnuts with bananas bacon and peanut butter.... Donut 7 goes back to plain jane doughnuts and kolaches. They keep it simple and they do the classics well   And yes  I ve passed this place many times but as many other yelpers have mentioned  this is the kind of place you only find because there s dozens of 5 star reviews. Love that 
Donut 7,154,I love this place  I stop by maybe every other Friday for an end of the week treat and the husband and wife that owns this place always remember me. Or at least they re so friendly that it just seems like they do. Their donuts are delicious and they always have a great variety  if you go early enough at least . And they make their breakfast tacos to order  yum  I also love places that support other local businesses. They serve Texas Coffee Traders coffee 
Donut 7,155,Wow. Donuts are heavenly. Got a sugar n cinnamon yeast and cake donut  a strawberry glazed yeast donut  and a ham  egg  and cheese croissant. Fresh  fluffy  delicious. Best donuts croissant I ve ever had and I ve had a lot. Great selection of drinks. Cashier was nice  friendly  and funny. Wish they were here in DFW.
Donut 7,156,This place is perfect. Small  cute  and super friendly service. They have tacos  breakfast sandwiches and a cooler full of drinks.   My never ending quest to find my favorite miga in Austin continued as I had a delicious miga. You have to pay extra to add cheese though  which seemed a little strange to me because I ve never had one without cheese. This one still isn t my favorite in town   that title still goes to El Chilito  but it s definitely up on my list. The green peppers and onions on the miga were crispy and fresh  the salsa was perfectly spiced.   The five stars comes in for great  pleasant and grateful service. They lack frills which keep their prices low. Breakfast for two was  14  and the homemade glazed donuts were mouth watering.   Overall  this was a great find for a quick weekday morning breakfast.
Donut 7,157,I work very close to them and needed to get somewhere in and out quickly last week. Wow was I in the right place at the right time for going here     The staff was quick the selection was abundant and the pricing was normal. The donut holes were probably the best at work for others who were trying to cut back during the holidays. The kolaches and biscuits were excellent and even the breakfast tacos made the coworkers happy.  Thank you for your fast  direct service. That parking lot makes me a bit nervous but that is not their fault.  Happy holidays and I will be returning. Thank you all for being prompt and understanding my wierd impromptu order lol 
Donut 7,158,What a great little place. The owners are friendly and accommodating  to my rather strange request of spelling something out with donuts .   The treats themselves are a little unassuming to look at  compared to the audaciousness of a Round Rock or Gourdough s  but they are as delicious as they get  and there s something quite appealing about supporting a local family-owned business.  I ve now tried the donuts  tacos  and kolaches and all three were fantastic.
Donut 7,159,Went to Donut 7 this morning for the first time with my boyfriend.  We had a Wednesday off and decided we would try out some new places.  We ordered 3 tacos and 2 donuts and the total was  7.42.  The tacos have amazing flavor  and I would consider then better than Rudy s or Taco Shack tacos  but then again I find Taco Shack s tacos kind of bland.  The donuts were moist and delicious as donuts should be.  My only complaint would be that they were out of any cake donuts  but I went after 10 00 and they close at noon  so that is to be expected.  I m sure if you go earlier in the day they would have more of a variety.  There s also a large selection of refrigerated drinks as well as fresh coffee.  They even make a few select specialty coffee drinks.  The restaurant is nice and clean  and there are plenty of tables if you d like to eat there.  Overall I gave Donut 7 4 stars  and will definitely be going back.
Donut 7,160,Very friendly and welcoming staff. I ordered a dozen donuts for the office  a kolache and sausage  egg  and cheese taco for myself. Both were outstanding and coffee was good too. I would give it a 5 star but they could do a little more to decorate the space. Highly recommended for a morning pick me up on the go 
Donut 7,161,Stopped here for breakfast on my way to my hotel from the airport. The breakfast tacos were good  but the tortillas weren t handmade. The coffee was decent  and the price was right  though.
Donut 7,162,This donut breakfast taco place deserves 6 stars.  It s replaced Donut Taco Palace as my favorite donut place.  Pros  - Delicious breakfast tacos made to order - among my favorites in Austin actually  most local donut places have premade tacos they warm up for you - Spicy and tasty salsa - Friendly customer service from a young Korean  lady - Super cheap - breakfast tacos are huge  densely-packed with food  and only  1.65   Cheese is an extra  0.30 - Wide variety of donuts  pastries  kolaches  and breakfast tacos - Many tables inside  though the fluorescent lighting and bare white walls leave the ambience a little wanting   Cons  - I wish their breakfast tacos could come with corn tortillas but none of these non-Mexican-run donut breakfast taco joints in Austin offer that so it s ok  Donut 7 is in the strip mall on the southeast corner of the Burnet Rd   Kramer Ln intersection.  It s the north neighbor of Szechuan House and Abraham s Shoe Repair.  They are open at 5 am and closed all day Sunday.    I wonder why the name is  Donut 7.   Are there stores called  Donut 1-6  already 
Donut 7,163,Not sure how everyone is giving this place such a high rating  its average  tried the breakfast tacos and a kolache
Donut 7,164,OH. MY. GAwD. I went here this morning craving donuts and I didn t know a good donut joint then I stumbled on yelp and found this magical place.  As I arrived  i get a warm good morning greeting and a lovely smile from the lady behind the counter.   So I ordered the blueberry donut  kolaches  and a dozen of donut holes. My budget was under  10 for everything. Imagine going to Starbucks and wasting  10 just on a drink and a scone. Man I m telling you the donuts were still warm and fresh as I took a bite. Wasn t overpowering with sweetness but just right. The kolaches were very warm and the bread was soft. The donut holes are okay. Typical. But the good thing about it that it s not too sweet.   End of story - this donut place is the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a . I recommend  10 10 YASSS.
Donut 7,165,This place has very awesome breakfast crossiants and donuts are so good.  Their staff are very friendly and offers every  customer great customer service.  All their hot breakfast is made fresh when ordered.
Donut 7,166,Wonderful   Would give 100 stars if I could   The donuts and breakfast tacos are fresh and yummy  Husband and wife team are always working yet always friendly and kind.
Donut 7,167,Good donuts. Good coffee. Average tacos.Very friendly service.
Donut 7,168,I have been coming here since 1995 or 96.  They have the best doughnuts  cake is my favorite  and wonderful pigs in the blanket.  I have always received great service and great food.
Donut 7,169,Decided to try this place out due to the rave reviews on the Migas breakfast tacos.  Sadly it is very hard to find quality Migas breakfast tacos in North Austin.  The tacos weren t bad but they definitely were not Mexican in any sort of way and a little skimpy on the fillings.  Not what I expected based of pictures from other Yelpers.  Instead of jalape o they used bell pepper  onion and a little tomato.  Also there was an extra charge for cheese which made each taco  2.50 but taste and portion wise just not worth the money.  We also tried the jalape o cheese kolaches and an old fashioned sour cream donut.  The Kolaches were actually good  nice and fluffy with a bit of spicy-ness.  The donuts were average and the rest I saw also looks about average.  The owners were super sweet and the place was clean and had nice tables.  My search for good Migas tacos continues.
Donut 7,170,My fav part of apple fritters are the crispy edges. At this sweet little donut shop they have perfected the art of the entire fritter having a litlle crisp exterior. I cant get enough of these. I have had donuts from all sorts of places. From little mom and pop places to fancy stand in line until sold out places. All of their donuts are yummy and fresh. The tacos are very good also. The staff are so nice and welcoming. Donut 7 is a great little donut shop. Yes they take credit card and call ahead orders for tacos.
Donut 7,171,Melt in your mouth donuts  always fresh  great selection  super friendly staff  Made to order tacos  coffee and cold drinks also available
Donut 7,172,So  so impressed with this place. The migas taco was delicious and super fresh tasting   Jalape o and cheese kolache was very good  loved the bread used. Coffee  donuts and donut holes were very yummy.  But  really the migas taco will have me coming back frequently.  All that with extremely fast and friendly services makes this place a great find 
Donut 7,173,This is a good place to get a tasty  fresh breakfast taco or donut. The service is fast and staff are friendly. And the coffee is good  too. I look forward to coming back.
Donut 7,174,Been a loyal customer here since it opened. Great food and great service    Donuts  kolaches and breakfast tacos are delish and the coffee is strong. Just tried their new lunch tacos and they re some of the best I ve had. I know what I m talking about because my body is made up of at least 75  tacos. They re simple and amazing  not like those blown out tacos popping around. Just good meat  onions and cilantro.
Donut 7,175,This donut shop that takes much of my boyfriends money and I don t mind    It is a local shop owned by the nicest and most caring Korean couple that you will ever meet. Everytime I walk in their remember me by name and even when my boyfriend goes in  he tells me they ask to see how I am. Aside from their amazing hospitality  the food is quite good as well  The donuts are fresh and fluffy. A good size breakfast taco will run you only  1.65 and another of my favorite here is the sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. This place is wonderful if you are in a rush and need a quick in and out breakfast run. If you have a few minutes to spare  I recommend eating inside so you can chat a little with the owners   
Donut 7,176,This place is conveniently located  reasonably priced  and tasty   In addition to donuts they have kolaches and breakfast sandwiches. My bfast sammy was tasty and fresh. The couple running the place were friendly and knew many customers by name. I ll be back 
Donut 7,177,Rarely leave reviews but have been goin to this place for over 2 years and owners are always there working and a big selection to keep mixing it up. Thanks for the hard work and kind attitude.
Donut 7,178,This spot is AMAZING  Best donuts in town hands down. They are simple and delicious. The kolaches are great too  And they treat you so well every time. It is a great way to start the day. What are you doing still reading this  Go 
Donut 7,179,We have been going here in the morning  great food. Great customer service  and very clean  The man who usually works when we visit is the nicest guy  always smiling  The food and coffee is priced fairly and we will definitely be coming back 
Donut 7,180,This place was suggested to me by a friend who is a regular here. I took his suggestion and I tried it last month - February 2017. I keep going back to them almost every weekday.  Its quite conveniently located near my office which is in the Domain area. I pick my breakfast tacos on my way to work.  Fresh  tasty  inexpensive tacos. I can only talk about them as I am yet to try other items on the menu. I like their sausage  amp  egg  bacon  amp  egg and chicken fajitas. As its made fresh they take around 5 minutes to prepare  which is perfectly alright. I usually order via phone when I head to office.  The staff here is very friendly and always greets you with a bright smile.  Love this place. If you like to have tacos for breakfast  you should give it a go.
Donut 7,181,There are other donut shops nearer to my home  but I will drive a little out of my way to patronize Donut 7. I love their old fashioned donuts  and even more I appreciate the very kind couple that owns the shop. I just learned today that they serve Texas Coffee Traders coffee which is another plus in my book. I like supporting good local businesses 
Donut 7,182,  best place to to get some breakfast if you re in the burnet area also called in your order if you re in a hurry very nice people
Donut 7,183,This is our go to donut and breakfast taco place. The beef fajita hits the spot just right and the donuts are fresh and delicious.
Donut 7,184,Donuts were probably pretty good at 5 am  But at 11am it tasted pretty old and stale    if they aren t good at 11 am  don t sell them at 11am
Donut 7,185,Seeing the super nice owners husband and wife   makes me want to give them more business. Very friendly and welcoming.  Their croissant sausage is fluffy and savory and the jalapeno sausage has a nice little kick to it. I would love to try their breakfast tacos and some other items. Close to work and it s definitely worth the extra few minutes drive to pick up their kolaches for everyone at work. Everyone loves them   Highly recommend.
Donut 7,186,My go to place for donuts  The jalape o kolache is SO GOOD. I haven t tried any other things  because at the moment I am obsessed with their donuts and kolaches. Service is always right at this place. It s a Great way to start my mornings   
Donut 7,187,This is the best donut shop that I have ever been to.  Their blueberry donuts are so good and fresh they are out of this world.  They also make sausage cheese croissants are to die for.  All their sandwiches are made to order.  We drove down from Harker Heights  Texas two days in a row to get breakfast here.  It s worth the drive.
Donut 7,188,Tacos were decent. Nothing to rave about but the price was good. Donuts were delish    Light  airy and perfectly sweet 
Donut 7,189,SUCH A GOOD SPOT. Great donuts made on-site  quick and delicious sandwhiches and tacos. Owners are friendly and helpful.
Donut 7,190,A simple place for breakfast  the Asian woman behind the counter was nothing but cheerful and helpful  My meal cost  7.27 pre-tip for a bacon  egg   amp  cheese biscuit  biscuit had lots of egg-very solid    2 sausage  egg  and cheese kolaches   amp  orange juice. This is a small place with about 4 tables  as it seems most people in the mornings stop and get something to-go. The woman made small chit-chat with the regulars  and it was nice to see there seemed to be a solid relationship with the community.  As of last week  the building s undergoing rennovations. There s a walkway and metal framework leading to the front door for now  but don t let that keep you from walking in  Located in a strip center  Google maps accurately places you in the right spot. My food took less than 5 minutes  which is important in the mornings. Great service  quick turnaround  and good food   4 stars 
Donut 7,191,This place is amazing. Food is good  especially the portobello taco with cheese  Nice  amp  clean  the owner greeted us when we entered.
Donut 7,192,I ll admit it - I don t really like donuts. Always disappointing when coworkers decide to grace the counter with donuts instead of breakfast tacos. But  Donut 7 has made me rethink my anti-donut position. But it has to be Donut 7     My go-to order here is a glazed sour cream donut  amp  a chocolate iced sour cream donut  sounds like the donut version of a black  amp  white cookie here . Delicious  When my family comes to visit  they always enjoy  trying almost one of everything. We usually get an assorted dozen to bring back. Just remember they re closed on Sundays.  The breakfast tacos are fairly standard. Sufficient if you need a fix  and always cooked to order and served piping hot.   The customer service is fantastic  as every single person is greeted when they come in. Hats off to the owners who always make us feel very welcome.
Donut 7,193,Went today with my spouse after reading all the great reviews but  unfortunately  our experience was not that great.  While the couple who run the place seem very nice and friendly the food was lacking.    We tried the breakfast tacos and found them bland and overheated as if the food had been mircowaved. Normally  I would not complain about hot food but they were super heated - even untouchable. Also  the potatoes were undercooked  and had a strange taste- almost as if they were cooked with a bit of chorizo for flavoring.  The Carne Guisada was lacking in flavor  grey in color and did not have the normal gravy associated with Carne Guisada.  In all fairness  we did not try the donuts and they could have been great but we couldn t quite stomach the thought of eating more bland food.
Donut 7,194,So good and so cheap    Perfect for donuts to bring into work or for parties. Coffee too... Mmhhhmmm. Also the service is great 
Donut 7,195,They know my face  along with what exactly I order.  Yea  I may come here twice or three time a week.  Yea  I love it here.     Breakfast tacos are excellent.  Give the potato  egg  amp  cheese a try  amp  you will not be sorry.    Sausage  amp  cheese croissant  get in my tummy   Flaky  butter croissant.  Delicious.  Customer service is delightful.  They get you fed quick with a quick hello and a chat.  Love this place 
Donut 7,196,The couple who owns this place is always friendly and very helpful  always greet you when you walk in regardless of how busy the store is. Food is cheap and delicious. Right next to the apartment so location is phenomenal too
Donut 7,197,Cannot say enough good things about this place. The owners are extremely friendly and accommodating. I asked for a cream filled donut  he pulled it out of the case  noticed that there wasn t enough cream in it and went in the back to put more cream in it. Super awesome. The donut was very  very good and I also got a breakfast taco that was also really good. Everything is very cheap too. They have so much more than donuts and tacos that I can t wait to try. I ll be going back at least once a week   From what I ve seen  they ve been around for a few years now  so I can t believe there aren t more reviews. This place really deserves more.
Donut 7,198,So yummy  I love the environment and the food is so simple and delicious  Totally recommend this place for a nice breakfast taco or a Kolache  Owners are very nice people too   
Donut 7,199,A little treasure buried in a strip mall. The outrageously cheap breakfast tacos were wonderful  as was the Kolache. If nothing else the journey is worth it to chat with the super-enthusiastic South Korean proprietors. They ll make it all worth it.
Donut 7,200,Had a really nice experience this morning. BEST breakfast tacos I ve had thus far since moving to Austin  2months  reminded me a lot of home. Simple fresh ingredients. The owners were so friendly and adorable  The donuts were great too .. Soft fluffy and fresh ... Never greasy  I ll be back for sure.. Donuts ANNNNDDD tacos what more can a girl ask for   
Donut 7,201,Solid breakfast tacos and delicious donuts. Nothing fancy or overpriced here. Under  2 get a great breakfast taco. The homemade salsa is a great touch. Simple - affordable - breakfast done right  Not to mention the best donut holes EVER. Homemade and melt in your mouth- unlike anything I ve ever tasted.  Owners are very friendly and always welcoming. Win-win 
Donut 7,202,We are here visiting for a couple days and found this place online based on the reviews.  We are so glad we came here   The owner  Lee  was very sweet and made it a great first time experience.  Most importantly the food was awesome. We had a chocolate old fashioned which was the fluffiest melt in your mouth pastry. We also did a biscuit and croissant sandwich. Again  super fluffy and magical  Lastly we had a migas taco which with the salsa was well balanced and tasty.  I will definitely come back here next time we visit.
Donut 7,203,I discovered Donut 7 shortly after moving to Austin about 5 years ago. I agree with the 10 stars for service -- the owners are as friendly and helpful as they come. They get to know their regular customers by name  they get my family s weird taco order right every time  and they even custom-make white-iced donuts for us  which they ve usually run out of by the time we get there.  So here s my overview of some specific menu items   Chocolate or white iced donuts  apple fritters  old-fashioneds - as good as any I ve ever had.  Plain glazed - yummy  but Krispy Kreme is still the king.  Donut holes - Perfect. Maybe some day Krispy Kreme will get their head out of their ass and realize that their donut holes should be based on their regular glazed donuts instead of cake. Until that happens  Donut 7 s are as good as they get.  Croissants - Delicious - beats the hell out of fast-food ones.  Breakfast tacos - Fantastic on the ingredients  and some of the best homemade salsa in town. They could improve on them  though  by using freshly-made tortillas  the raw ones from HEB would work - don t have to be by hand .  Kolaches - They re OK  and I get them when I m in the mood. I do like the use of fresh jalape os rather than pickled. But once you ve had the ones from Kolache Shoppe on Burnet  everything else pales by comparison.  I love this place enough that I go there probably once a week on average  sometimes more if I get in a rut of not wanting to cook breakfast. A few menu items have room for improvement  so I d give the food 4 stars  but the 10-star service kicks it up to 5 stars from me.
Donut 7,204,I have been going to Donut 7 since they were in South Austin.    The Donuts are the best in town that I have had.  They are light and fluffy and not overly sweet like Krispy Kreme.  I love Krispy Kreme while the are hot but anytime after I find them sugary and greasy.    Most often i buy breakfast tacos and kolaches.  I love their tacos.  There are other places in Austin that have probably have better tacos but what I love about Donut 7 tacos is that they are fresh  made to order  and consistent.  I love their hot sauce.  It is the perfect marriage with their tacos.  Its made by Young and it tastes exactly the same everyday.  The kolaches  too me  really arent kolaches.   They are  pigs in a blanket .  However  it is the perfect ratio of bread to meat.    The owners  Ken and Young  know me by name as well as many of the other patrons.   They have a very loyal customer base.  One that is well deserved.
Donut 7,205,This is the kind of place Yelp exists to help you find.   Thanks  Angelica S.    I went in on a suprisingly blustery Sat AM after a late Fri night at SXSW  yes  we were staying in the hinterlands .  Donut 7 sits in an unexceptional strip mall on a pedestrian-hostile road near  The Domain   none of which are things that recommend it.  But it s a genuine mom-and-pop place  run by a really friendly couple who serve up fresh  tasty donuts and kolaches  and man they are good.  I had a perfect old-fashioned donut and a maple-glazed  my friend had a chocolate-frosted.  The breakfast tacos  also excellent and  at  1.65  not to be beat.  Plus they are made-to-order and so fresh as can be.  All in all  worth the miserable trek on foot for a filling and delicious breakfast treat  very affordable and friendly as well.
Donut 7,206,I ve tried their donuts  kolaches  and breakfast tacos. All are great and at good prices. What is consistently great here is the service  They always are cheerful with their greetings and sincere thanks. I am more than happy to support their business.
Donut 7,207,My husband and I have come to Donut 7 a couple of times. The first time we went was because of it having such a high recommendation on Yelp. It isn t much different from any other donut shop. Their donuts are pretty good. What I have to recommend is their breakfast tacos. We just moved here from Oklahoma and are not used to having the option for tacos. They are really good  fresh made breakfast tacos that are cheap but bigger than most other places. The salsa is amazing with them  it seems fresh  not bought. The owners are super sweet and there is an old man that is a regular who we run into every time we go. Such a cute little spot.
Donut 7,208,Glazed donuts were nice and fluffy and still great at 11 30am. Need to try the cake donuts as they were out.
Donut 7,209,This is one of those little donut shops that crop up over town. Good selection  nice owners  great donuts. No complaints.
Donut 7,210,Pretty small kolaches but not too bad on the taste. The shop owner did throw them in a microwave but he didn t overheat them and get them completely soggy.  The croissant is freaking amazing. I didn t expect that. Good flaky croissant. Buttery eggs. And the size of the thing is much bigger than expected.  Customer service is excellent. Too bad it took me so long when I work across the street.
Donut 7,211,For me  the flavors were off. I didn t think the selection was all that great either. The staff was very friendly  and I almost feel bad giving it a lower rating because of how friendly they are to their customers  but I am there for donuts and coffee  and the flavors should taste correct. One of my donuts tasted like soap  the other tasted like it had paraffin wax in it. I think there are better options in the area.
Donut 7,212,They just started this week their lunch tacos and OMG they are just as delicious as their breakfast tacos. This place is 100  my go to place for quick donuts and breakfast lunch tacos  The people that work here are energetic and happy to serve customers and you couldn t ask for more 
Donut 7,213,Visiting from Ohio and found this little gem close to our hotel at the domain. The people here couldn t be nicer and they even remembered me when I came back. The breakfast tacos are amazing and the donuts are really good. Tomorrow we will try the kolache 
Donut 7,214,This place is amazing  The owners are super sweet. I got a small jalape o sausage Kolache and it was so good I wish I had gotten a large. I also got a taco which is amazing  Definitely recommend this place.
Donut 7,215,Super delicious breakfast tacos at this hole in the wall. The chorizo and egg taco is AMAZING  The owners are straight adorable immigrants who are so friendly and nice. It s also extremely cheap. Didn t have donuts  next time though 
Donut 7,216,The donuts are incredible. There always seems to be a line  but it moves rapidly. There is nothing fancy or gourmet about this place  but what they do they do extremely well.
Donut 7,217,Food is fresh and hot every time   My favorite is a breakfast taco with a donut chaser  lol   Their coffee is hot and strong.  The place is always clean.  But best of all  it is owned by a sweet young couple  who are friendly and welcoming.  Feels great to support a local business with great food that is really well priced 
Donut 7,218,My favorite go to place for breakfast during the week. Consistent and reliable. Food taste fresh and of course is very yummy. Their donuts are great and slightly addicting. Simply an all around great place 
Donut 7,219,Went due to yelpers rvw. Sausage cheese egg croissant was good size   flaky  buttery  freshly made and inexpensive. Cheese ooey gooey. Old fashioned donut sweet  fresh  flaky   very good. Lady at register very nice and says Good Morning to everyone. That was really nice.  Wait time was minimal even though they had at least 5 orders ahead of me. Would return.
Donut 7,220,This place is fast  amazing  cheap  and always crowded for a reason  I don t think i ve ever heard that  they re out of that donut.  They re ready for you 
Donut 7,221,Just perfect. Walked in the door at 5am and I have to say  this is the best time of day to get kolaches and donuts. The kolaches are tender  and the meat tastes pretty good. The croissants around the other kolaches are bizzarely good... I want to live inside of one of these things.   The donuts are unlike any donut I have ever had. Not too dense but not too airy  and super duper fresh. Definitely try a maple glazed.  Service was super nice and the price was good.  Across the board fantastic and definitely the best donuts in Austin. I will be back and you should be headed towards this place right now.
Donut 7,222,I must say  to be greeted with a hello an honest concern about  your customers  is forgotten when money isinvolved.  I was here in Austin and the  yelper  guided me here. I ordered the chorizo breakfast taco with onion an tomato  very tasty.  Egg to chorizo ratio 50 50 not over powering with cumin. Hot and fresh  amp  quick. I will be back
Donut 7,223,I am an early bird. I am usually up before the sun and most human beings. So  i appreciate eateries who open when the roosters crow. Thus   Donut 7 is great for me. They open right around 6AM or 6 30.  They serve a variety of donuts  donut holes  Kolaches  and breakfast tacos. It s very inexpensive and Ken is a great guy. He makes it a point to remember your name. He s kind and the food is always great.   Screw Krispy Kreme  they taste like crap compared to these guys 
Donut 7,224,Great start to my morning    Very nice owners that always greet you with a smile and make fresh made to order excellent breakfast tacos. Great hot sauce too which in my opinion makes or breaks it for me. Once again to the owners  thanks for being so kind and inviting and God bless...
Donut 7,225,Amazing place   I mostly come here for the egg sandwiches   They have the best sausage  egg and cheese croissant sandwich you could ask for   And the kolaches are amazing  
Donut 7,226,Croissant with Bacon  Egg and Cheese is to die for.  I have been going there for 5 years and have never eaten anything bad.  The owner and his wife are the nicest  hard working folks around.   As  my Daddy used to say  They are Good People.   And they sell a good product.
Donut 7,227,great breakfast tacos and friendly service. The place is clean and makes the tacos to order. Too bad they re not open on Sunday mornings.
Donut 7,228,I know it s commonplace to use top shelf words to describe anything people are mildly happy with  but when I tell you these guys made the best donuts I have ever had  I am being straight with you.  Maybe I caught them on a really good day  but these donuts were so good they made me happy  and THATS rare.
Donut 7,229,If you are having a cheat day you have got to try this hidden gem     Looks aren t great but the croissant s are amazing    Truly amazing    The staff is very friendly. My favorite donut is the glazed blueberry. Yummy
Donut 7,230,Haven t tried the breakfast tacos yet but I will be going back ASAP to do so   Best kolaches  apple fritters  and donuts   If you haven t been you need to 
Donut 7,231,The breakfast croissants are fresh and well balanced.  There isn t too much egg or too little meat  it was delicious.  They also took an online order when I took a chance and emailed them after hours.  My order was hot and fresh at pick up time   
Donut 7,232,Out of this world donuts  delicious breakfast tacos and friendly service.
Donut 7,233,Great Donuts  I am from Indy and seem the reviews on yelp so I decided to try them out. Was greeted as soon as I walked in the door and they staff was very friendly. The donuts where amazing  Very fresh and had a good variety to choose from. Highly recommend the trip to the small shop.
Donut 7,234,We came across this joint while waiting for my son s football game to start. I yelped around and found this and off we went. The donut holes were great. Nice and juicy and tasted really fresh. But the tacos  the whole reason for coming were just average at best. I am a little bit of a taco snob   a girl like what she likes   but these didn t measure up for me. The place was clean and the donut selection was pretty good though so if I was in the area I would come back again. Just not for tacos
Donut 7,235,It is generally not hard to like a local donut establishment  especially one that has staked its claim in the Austin fried dough world for quite some time  almost 20 years  Donut 7  Wow  Unfortunately  this was a lesser donut joint  opinion. Primarily because of the somewhat limited selection.  The old fashioned donut was a bit dry  but the chocolate glaze was spot on.  The blueberry cake had a very purple interior and it had a good hint of blueberry  flavor.  Not bad.  Ultimately  the guilt-driving grub here is indeed extremely affordable. Well  why did I rank it with only a 3  I compare donut shops against each other. Most of the time  all of the ATX establishments cranking out the oil-cooked parcels of flour and fat  often covered with a bit of sugar and fat.
Donut 7,236,I went by the advice of other Yelpers  amp  tried the Migas Tacos  amp  they were AWESOME   Fresh hot  amp  very tasty.  I m not a big Donut fan but if you are then I advise you to get here early.  I went at 9 30 in the morning  amp  they were already out of a lot of the Donut selections.
Donut 7,237,They welcome you in the morning with a smile. The place is neat and tidy. Food is good and inexpensive. Highly recommended if you are in a hurry to work and want to pick up something for breakfast.
Donut 7,238,Was greeted immediately with a warm smile and a hello. Both employees seemed happy to see every customer that walked into their shop. The food was delicious and the coffee was tasty. This was my first time there and will definitely continue to go and will recommend it to my friends and family. I ll try their donuts next time but they looked fresh and delicious as well.
Donut 7,239,Like the previous review  this place is truly a gem and the whole purpose of Yelp.   Cheap  tasty and the owner is unbelievably nice. It s a little hard to find as it is in a strip mall next to the Shamrock gas station  but once you find it you ll keep going back. I recommend the Migad taco with sausage added.  REVISING SINCE I VE BEEN EXPOSED TO OTHER PLACES TO EAT IN AUSTIN.  IT S GREAT  BUT NOT THE BEST...
Donut 7,240,I called in a phone order for a boatload of breakfast tacos and kolaches for a marketing event a few days ago. Not only were they ready in record time  but the staff was also extremely friendly and efficient upon my arrival. They even offered to carry the boxes out to my car for me  Top-notch customer service  and the food is delicious too.
Donut 7,241,My go-to breakfast spot    The inside is so clean and charming.  The owners and employees treat everyone like family.  I always get the breakfast tacos with an old fashion doughnut  delicious 
Donut 7,242,Best donuts in town  good coffee  and good kolaches  I m sold. The kolache selection is sparse  just sausage and cheese  with or without jalapeno. But if you are looking for donuts  look no further  Very light and not over-glazed like krispy kreme.
Donut 7,243,Clearly addicted to these tacos when the owner knows my order when I come in   Bean and cheese  Freshly made  great service and close by. Only wish they were open on Sundays but I guess they ve earned a day off 
Donut 7,244,Looked for the best donuts in Austin and Yelp said this place.  I said ok and took my family there.  Ran by a very friendly Korean couple  service was great and the kids loved their jalapeno kolache so much that they had 2nd ones 
Donut 7,245,Go Go go. Breakfast amazing  Yes to your standard fair but the yummy breakfast sandwiches are what I came for  The jalape o cheese kolaches were the right balance. Oh thank you for my breakfast 
Donut 7,246,We go to Donut 7 often. The owners are always so nice and really seem to enjoy serving up yummy food to their customers.  Their donuts are delicious but I come for the breakfast tacos   Bacon egg  chorizo and egg  carne guidasa  or migas tacos are my faves.  Good tortillas too.
Donut 7,247,I went to Donut 7 for the first time today based solely on Yelp reviews.  The Jalapeno Kolache s at Donut 7 are the best I have ever had anywhere  their donuts are really good too but the jalapeno kolache s stole the show for me  amp  the staff was extremely nice.  This is my new spot for grabbing grub for the office before work.  JALAPENO KOLACHE S AT THIS PLACE ARE AWESOME     
Donut 7,248,I love donut 7  they are always super happy in the morning and the donuts holes cant be beat 
Donut 7,249,Excellent kolaches. Friendly service  clean and tidy dining area.   Coffee could be better   but I ll definitely be back for the baked goods.
Donut 7,250,Don t be surprised by the modesty of the interior- this is an amazing donut shop  The breakfast tacos are amazing made delicious  fresh  and with a generous portion of cheese. The donuts are to die for  and above all the owners always greet me with a happy smile and it s appreciated.
Donut 7,251,So  I m one of those annoying customers that shows up 25 minutes before closing and hopes for the best.  I was in the mood for a breakfast taco and a couple of donuts.  I thought I would try someplace new so after checking reviews I drove over to Donut 7.   I was very pleased with everything.  Instead of pre-cooking their tacos and nuking them when you order  they prepare their taco s fresh.  Sure  you have to wait a few minutes  but I enjoyed one of my donuts while waiting and just about the time I was done  my tacos were ready to go.   They were hot and delicious.  The veggies were crisp and fresh.  I had the fajita taco    I was also pleasantly surprised about how fresh their donuts were.  Even though they were closing in 25 minutes the donuts were soft and fresh as if they had just recently come out of the fryer.     I will return next weekend.  About the only negative I can give is the place could use a little sprucing up.  A coat of paint and some new floor tiles would make a world of difference in appearance  but it certainly doesn t affect the important part  the grub 
Donut 7,252,The donuts were very good. Quite a few choices and they were very friendly. Just under 7 for a dozen donuts seems a tad high but they were good. Store is a little cramped and it could have been cleaner.  Could just be a cramped older building.  Will I go back   Probably not  it was a wim and I ended up driving farthen then I wanted.
Donut 7,253,I ve never left a Yelp review before  or any review for that matter  so I m glad my first one is going out to Donut 7.   I kinda just stumbled upon this place because I was starving at work one day and I needed something to hold me over until lunch. I saw a sign that said donuts  so I was sold. I went in and was greeted very warmly and I got my food pretty quickly. I ordered a bacon  egg  and cheese breakfast taco and a chocolate eclair. I got back to my office and I was blown away. It was DELICIOUS. Granted  I went in with little-to-no expectations. The taco had real bacon on it. REAL. BACON. Not that flimsy  pre-cooked nonsense. The eclair was amazing as well  so it was pretty much the perfect little breakfast.   I went back when I was a little less hungry just to make sure that my opinion of the place wasn t skewed. It really was as good as I thought the first time and my senses did not fool me. The quality was the same and the food was just as delicious.   I do have to say though that my life was forever changed by the apple fritter and the migas breakfast taco. When I say that these items give me life in the mornings  please know that I m telling the honest  straight from the heart truth.   The storefront is unassuming and the inside is dated  but I m not paying attention to the atmosphere that early in the morning. It s a clean  sanitary environment  so that s all that s important. They do close at noon on the weekdays  but that s probably for the best.   I can t recommend this place enough  Please check it out 
Donut 7,254,Been going here for years the current owners are great  so we re th the previous owners by the way  food is good service is excellent.
Donut 7,255,My downfall is their amazing croissant egg sandwiches - love them   You always feel welcome  here from the cheerful hello when you arrive to the  have a good day  when you leave - the owners treat everyone like their very good friends.  They recently changed their coffee and it is delicious - hot and plentiful   Definitely part of my weekend routine   And yes  those donuts are melt in your mouth good too....and donut holes are calorie free  of course 
Donut 7,256,Perfect donuts  great tacos  so friendly- can t wait to come back and try the kolaches 
Donut 7,257,Fantastic little hole in the wall  Their donut is great but the breakfast tacos are better.
Donut 7,258,Came in with an unusual request of an absurd amount of donut holes for my sons school birthday celebrating. The staff was sweet and accommodating. Ordered glazes and chocolate glazed to take home to my husband as well. They were high and fresh  Very good and we ll be back 
Donut 7,259,Awesome just awesome their b-tacos are great and the donuts are fresh and tasty. The friendly owners are always there with a warm welcome and a smile. A must go if you are in the area.
Donut 7,260,I have loved going to Donut 7 for the past 20 years  but the donuts are getting smaller and the donut holes are getting smaller. Don t expand your business if the food  that got you where your at   is going to suffer.
Donut 7,261, Donut taco palace. Donut taco palace. Donut taco palace...  This place is legit. The breakfast tacos are generously portioned  the kolaches are delicious  and the donut holes always make me wish I ordered more. The owners are super friendly too  Glad they are expanding the place because often times when we come we have to take the food to go because there isn t anywhere to sit.
Donut 7,262,Really good donuts. Nice and yeasty  not overly sweet. The owners are friendly. Not much more to say. I ll be back.
Donut 7,263,Donuts here taste like heaven  We had the glazed donuts with chocolate cream and the donut holes. The breakfast taco with chorizo  egg  and cheddar did not disappoint as well  We found the service great and attentive. We would definitely come back when visiting Austin 
Donut 7,264,The staff is amazingly cheerful. The sausage kolaches are delicious. High quality all around with low prices.  Great way to start your day. I always leave with a smile.
Donut 7,265,This is a hole in the wall joint with really great food. It s quick  cheap  and tasty.
Donut 7,266,Great food at great prices. Had the migas taco and a jalapeno lilacs. Delicious  Very friendly service. I ordered to go but it looks like they ve taken over the next store over to add more seating. Coffee us great to 
Donut 7,267,So I was searching for a word to describe this place and it doesn t exist - it should be something like  woohootastic . Ken and Young have owned this little Austin gem for over 20 years and they make everyone so welcome. The place has a long list of regulars  - one of which is me.  At the risk of losing my TX privileges I m just going to go out there and say it - they have the best breakfast taco s in Austin - yep I said it - the best breakfast taco s in Austin are made by a 60  year old S.Korean couple in a donut shop - only in Austin my friends - only in Austin....  Everyday they make at least 8 different kinds of donuts  taco s  and kolaches which they do very well.  Oh and try the donut holes - hot fluffy goodness.  One thing to note is that they open at around 6am and close at noon I think everyday except Sundays but I will check. If you go there around 10am you ll avoid the breakfast rush but they re usually very fast anyway.
Donut 7,268,Me and my boyfriend went here today and got two breakfast tacos each. I got the potato egg and cheese and he got the migas taco and potato egg and cheese.  My boyfriend and I have tried a lot of places for breakfast tacos in the area. The potatoes were dry and undercooked  and he said the migas tacos was not anything to write home about. The blueberry cake donut was pretty good  but I think they should leave breakfast tacos to someone else. I would not come here again.
Donut 7,269,Very friendly establishment with great donuts and other breakfast items. I especially like their breakfast tacos  but you can t go wrong with anything on the menu.
Donut 7,270,I really like the breakfast tacos here and they are only 1.50 for 2 items  extra for more items.  Old Fashion Donuts are really good too.
Donut 7,271,Not only are these the best kolaches and donuts I ve ever had  but the service is out of this world.
Donut 7,272,Good people  good prices  great food. Really don t need to elaborate too much on that. Can t find anything to complain about Donut 7 after visiting it more than a dozen times in the last year.
Donut 7,273,They are always super friendly  amp  their donuts  amp  kolaches are delicious   The apple fritters are HUUUUGE  
Donut 7,274,One of my favorite places around.  You are always greeted by the smiling faces of the owners. They make you feel like that are genuinely happy that you stopped in.  Today I had a breakfast taco and a sausage croissant  they were both sooo yummy   The breakfast tacos are made fresh as you order them  amp  they include a great salsa in your bag too.  This place never disappoints me 
Donut 7,275,I m a big fan of their simple glazed donuts and kolaches. These just are better than others. What s their secret   No idea. I guess they just know dough. Super nice owners make the experience.
Donut 7,276,Absolutely amazing.  Great prices  friendly service  drinks always stocked.  Food is amazing.
Donut 7,277,Simple but good  The tacos are just the right size and the donuts are yummy.  Small place with only a few tables but clean.   Owners seem friendly
Donut 7,278,Is a great place for breakfast.  I recommend chorizo egg bean.  Good fresh doughnuts.  Friendly service.
Donut 7,279,Delicious    We had donuts  kolaches  and a croissant sandwich. All super tasty  and owners are so sweet 
Donut 7,280,I love this place  i ve been visiting donut 7 for years and love all the food. Their donuts are the best  too. It fast  friendly and in a very convenient spot.
Donut 7,281,Delicious kolaches and breakfast taco.  I got the sausage jalepenos kolaches and the dough was perfectly buttery.  So far this place and Sarena s in RR are my top places to get Kolaches.  I wanted to sample the sour cream donuts but they were out  guess I ll need to get there earlier next time.  The owners are so friendly as well  I got a chance to chat with them for a few minutes.
Donut 7,282,Fresh  fluffy  perfect  doughnuts. Very nice owner.  Nothing else to say.
Donut 7,283,They always remember you when you go in it s a small friendly business with great donuts and best breakfast tacos around
Donut 7,284,Fantastic.  We are regulars and won t go anywhere else now.  You have your usual suspects for donut shops around town  but if you want something special  make a visit  here.  The owners are welcoming and are really good at what they do.  Typical purchase for us includes their tacos  blueberry cake donuts  eclairs  and either their old fashioned donut or something to switch it up.  Salsa is perfect.  Way to go  Donut 7 
Donut 7,285,I used to have a serious donut jones and the wonderful people here were a great fix.   One of the only places that really knows how to make a cruller  they also make a decent breakfast taco.   The filled and sour cream donuts are also first rate.   Ken who runs the counter is a really nice guy and seeing him is a great way to start the day.
Donut 7,286,I absolutely love the donut and breakfast tacos here  Plus the service is great  The owner and his wife are so friendly that they put a smile on my face every morning. I would recommend this place to anyone that works nearby because it s yummy and quick too if you re in a hurry  
Donut 7,287,The best thing about Donut 7 is the very friendly couple that runs the joint. But they also make the best cake glazed donut ever. It s irresistible. Good breakfast tacos with homemade salsa and good kolaches too 
Donut 7,288,I don t write as many reviews as I should  but I need to write one for Donut 7. You would surely miss this place just driving by. I know I did  many times. But don t let the old shopping center fool you. I stopped here because it was close to my office and I heard they sold breakfast tacos. Six months later  I now won t go anywhere else for breakfast. The store could use a face lift and is a little dated  but is small and friendly. The name does t make you think of anything other than donuts  but the breakfast tacos and other breakfast sandwiches are very  very good. On top of that  the customer service leaves nothing to be desired. They are a family owned business who are fast and incredibly friendly. Every time I go there  I am greeted by name and with a smile. This is the kind of local Austin business I wish everyone would support. If you are in the area  please go there and try something. The Jalapeno Kolaches are great. If you like your food and experience  please leave a review and help keep this wonderful local business alive
Donut 7,289,Wonderful donuts and the nicest couple   I have been going here for close to 15 years. Ken  amp  Young make the best cake donuts in town    They know me by name and always ask how my husband is..  I will call to reserve my favorite  and this is infrequent since I try to be good and not indulge   I really don t have to tell them the ones I want  they remember. The consistency of the cake donut is not too dry love them with chocolate. My husband loves their fritters.   It s nice  since Austin is getting to be a big city  to still go somewhere that feels like a small town establishment.  Please patronize them 
Paco's Tacos,1,First restaurant I tried after getting into Austin  and was not disappointed  This place is uniquely decorated and has a very chill vibe.   Service was very friendly and offered recommendations. Ended up with a steak and potato taco  and the fish taco  with a side of quest.   Everything came hot  and flavorful. I would recommend any of the hot sauces they offer as well. I would return and try some more of their tacos 
Paco's Tacos,2,Had the chilaquiles with beans and a breakfast taco - egg and chorizo. The salsa used for the chilaquiles was good and had just enough of a kick with the chips still having a little crunch too. The beans were solid and not greasy  I think they are made without lard.   The tortilla on the breakfast taco felt fresh as it was soft and warm while still having some pull to it. Egg and chorizo were tasty  make sure you put some salsa on there too.  Overall I enjoyed my visit. The staff was very friendly and the wait was not long at noon on a Sunday.
Paco's Tacos,3,Ordered to go from inside the store  I live just down the street from Pacos  so I hurried back to consume my tasty morsels in the quiet solitude of my own home while they were still hot and fresh.   With a price point of  8.75  which I would consider pretty expensive compared to its competitors  I had high hopes for Paco s take on the classic Beef Gordita  one of my favorite Tex Mex dishes. Boy was I in for a heart break.   The biggest offender by far was the shell. One side was kind of tender and crispy  a passable but not especially inspiring rendition of the classic Gordita shell. The other shell was nearly inedible. It was hard and dry while at the same time being strangely gummy  like when you put bread in the microwave for a little  too long. That alone made the dish one of the most disappointing variations I ve ever eaten.  But the disappointment didn t end there. The roasted red peppers were savory and well prepared but sparse to point of almost being non existent. I think there were a total of 3 peppers on my entire sandwich  each the size of a finger nail clipping. Considering how bland the sandwich otherwise was  a little more generosity with the peppers would have gone a loooong way to upping the flavor.  They did do a good job with the beef and onions and were very generous with the gooey cheese  but these three positives were overshadowed by the final disappointment  the sandwich itself  was surprisingly small. I am a pretty slim guy  I can usually barely finish two tacos. So It seems reasonable to me that a sandwich with a nearly  10 price point would be enough to leave me feeling reasonably satiated. But no. After gnawing through the though corn patties  my stomach simply said  is that it    and has been growling angrily ever since.   Pacos has excellent coffee and many of their tacos are top notch  but I would recommend try look elsewhere to satiate your Gordita cravings. 
Paco's Tacos,4,We love coming back to Paco s Tacos for their variety of breakfast tacos options and weekend drink offers. The location is really charming  with a real cantina out back. The staff is super friendly.  I like their corn and flour blend tortillas  which I believe are made in-house. We picked two or three taco items and had the coffee cups to enjoy on their patio for a nice relaxing early Sunday morning.
Paco's Tacos,5,How has it taken me this long to try Paco s Tacos   My coworker had recommend it for a work lunch so we went as a group. They had seating indoors and outdoors  but since it was so hot out we opted for indoor. We ordered our food at the counter  which didn t have a line  and then snagged a table. The food came out quickly and the tacos and queso were so good. I really enjoyed the gringo taco. I definitely hope to go back when I m in the area.
Paco's Tacos,6,My favorite spot in Austin  TX to get tacos   They have the largest variety of tacos I ve ever seen. The first time I went I had a scallop taco and beef with potatoes taco and both had me hooked  We ve been back for breakfast and their breakfast tacos and chilaquiles are just as yummy  Highly recommend.
Paco's Tacos,7,Hubby recommended we stop here for breakfast. He raved about the chilaquiles. Breakfast tacos were great. All of the salsas are awesome.  3 mimosas and Bloody Mary on Sat Sun. Fun  quirky spot. Old Austin. Menu looks fun. We ll be back to try lunch or dinner.
Paco's Tacos,8,Quirky and weird atmosphere  and if this is an old place  then I can see why it may be an easy Austin institution. But what was once cool to present a twist on tacos are now commonplace  and unfortunately Paco s does not do them notably well.   The El Gringo taco is their take on the shrimp taco. It was recommended over their scallop taco  which has the same toppings - mango pico de gallo  avocado. The avocado was fine. Mango was a bit green  meaning not bursting with flavor - but it was fine accompanying the baby shrimps which pale in comparison with their larger cousins. The tortillas were not much to talk about either. So this one taco is just  meh   but not necessarily bad.   The chicken quesadilla produced the same sentiments - since it was heavy on the cheese and not so much on the chicken  and a notable absence of any filling along a good portion of the outer rim. I ve had better quesadillas that are also heavy with cheese and for cheaper at Mexican hole-in-wall greasy joints.   And considering nothing blew me out of the  water  I m not sure if I will be coming back.   Service was friendly though.  Side note  a few previous reviews mentioned wine-based margaritas being available here. When I inquired today  they mentioned that they do not offer any margarita of any kind.
Paco's Tacos,9,While I do appreciate this place s kitschy appeal  and its proximity to my house   and so enjoy their shrimp taco  El Gringo   I always imagined they paid their employees a living wage considering the fact that they charge over  5 for their tacos. But that isn t the case  sadly.  Also  when I went in this week  I was the only one wearing a mask. There were over 20 people squeezed into their entryway counter area  and not a single one was masked. The owner was unmasked. The cashier was unmasked. All the kitchen employees were unmasked. And why  The pandemic is not behind us. A plea to local business owners  please  please be responsible. I KNOW that we so badly want to get back to the way things were before  but practicing a little caution during this scary time is literally the least we can do to keep each other safe and healthy.
Paco's Tacos,10,Staff was nice  there was a salsa bar so you can pick your heat  I rec the orange one if you want a little kick  Everything else was pretty tame.  The hatch was interesting  similar to chipotle vibe.   Their bacon egg and cheese was good  I loved the bacon since it was perfectly meaty and full of flavor.   Not a must try for me but if you are near  their menu won t disappoint.
Paco's Tacos,11,I love the rustic decor that really sets Paco s tacos apart from trendier taco places. It really makes eating there feel more authentic. Tables are all spread apart for social distancing. I stopped by for lunch one day and ordered Paco s Bandito and Portabella for  4.25 each. Paco s Bandito was delicious but I thought the portabella could use more salt seasoning. The salsa bar is really convenient to pick out whatever salsa floats your boat.   The staff were all super friendly and our food came out quickly which is a huge plus for a quick lunch.
Paco's Tacos,12,I really want to love this place  but it s just okay. The building itself is very charming and has a cool outdoor patio with a small stage.   The margaritas are pretty good and not over priced. There s a lot of potential for the patio to have fun live music every once in a while  but no indication that ever happens from the few times I ve been here.   They don t even have recorded music playing  and there s rarely anyone in here  so it s so awkwardly quiet you can hear the refrigerators running  and the team washing dishes and sweeping the floor. Not really a fun vibe.   Ultimately it s about the food  which is also a bit underwhelming. The tortillas taste store bought  and the tacos are pretty hit or miss. I had the barbacoa twice and was disappointed the second time. My wife tried the bandito and gave it to me  which I only ate because I skipped lunch. The meat was a bit bland and mushy as some others have mentioned. She ate my tortilla soup which I wasn t crazy about  lukewarm and tasted a bit canned.   Things are fairly priced  but in Austin  I d almost rather pay a bit more if I know I can t make it  way  better at home.   I ve noticed the quality of a lot of restaurants has declined since the pandemic due to supply and staffing issues. I hope Paco s will become what I know it can be. I debated between two and three stars  but ultimately decided on two because I honestly don t think we have any reason to go back. I know I won t be able to convince my wife.   I ve included lots of pics of the outdoor spaces because I think with a little better food and some music  the place has the potential to be so much more popular.
Paco's Tacos,13,Probably not worth the price. The menu was pics listed here show a lower price than the actual one when you come into the restaurant. The tacos themselves are great and I was satisfied with their taste. However  it s not worth the exorbitant price I paid for 3 tacos and a coffee   20  . For this reason  I probably would not come back.
Paco's Tacos,14,All I can say avoir this place is YUM   It is a little gem right near my home and I feel blessed to have found it. The food is great even if the space can sometimes seem a bit cramped. I love the ambiance and the staff are super nice. Haven t had a bad meal yet. The right amount for the right price.   P.S. the tortillas are awesome. The mix of corn  amp  flour tortilla are great all by themself.
Paco's Tacos,15,Do not come here. The rustic  cozy atomosphere draws you into the absolute horrendous food. We stopped eating weighing if the food was going to make us sick. The  sliders  were jimmy dean sausage patties microwaved and grill for a minute. The  tacos  were soggy tortillas filled with wet ingredients and no taste. Maybe come here if you want to get just a drink  But buy a beer because the margaritas have no alcohol.
Paco's Tacos,16,Solid 2.5   Tacos were pricey  Barbacoa taco looked like mush  Queso was cold  Carnitas was decent  Mexican rice tasted like herb rice  Took 25 mins for 4 tacos  The place is super cute and people were nice  Food is very meh.  Won t be going back since the food didn t do it for me.
Paco's Tacos,17,Music is a little too much  but I guess that s the idea. Food was presented we ll look yummy but lack of taste. The chips were good  and the horchata was refreshing. I will come back to give it another shot. Service is not the best  I think they are easily better.
Paco's Tacos,18,Place is so amazing  the people that work here make it. Really amazing breakfast tacos and drinks are dirt cheap.
Paco's Tacos,19,Single worst dining experience I ve ever had in Austin  and I was raised here. The patio is cute  but nothing can redeem the repulsive quality of their food. I ordered a number of items  their queso is undoubtedly a block of velveeta melted in a pot  but it s hard to say because it wasn t even THAT good. I also ordered their sliders  which were pre-packaged  frozen beef pucks whose moisture came from the package they were in. They had the texture and flavor of frozen beef you d find in a TV dinner. Lastly  I ordered a taco which never came out. Apparently they never heard me order it...   When you walk into the establishment and see the kitchen  my review will entirely make sense. This place is the farthest from an authentic taco joint. Please save your money as I feel duped and upset at the quality of my meal.
Paco's Tacos,20,This has been one of my favorite taco places in Austin for years  And is one of the few restaurants still around from my early days in Austin. Their poblano salsa is to DIE for   And I love their peach tea. Plenty of seating usually available inside or outside with super cute decor. I always go for their breakfast tacos and some queso. Thank y all
Paco's Tacos,21,One of my favorite places to eat  Good food  good atmosphere  GREAT staff    My two complaints   Pricey I was charged  4 for a small bowl of salsa I added to my large bowl of guacamole and chips. I m not asking for free salsa  most restaurants serve free salsa  but who charges  4 for a small little bowl of salsa  Without chips  Paco s does  LOL   Flies  As with any restaurant with outdoor seating flies can really be a nuisance and the flies love Paco s food  atmosphere and staff as much as I do  I recently came across the greatest invention for annoying flies that restaurants with patio seating NEED to keep in use  Rescue Fly Traps  OMG these things are boss at attracting and trapping flies. They prefer the stinky goo in the bag over your delicious dinner    Please Paco s  Invest in these traps   It will make the patio experience soooo much more pleasant  You re charging  4 for about  0.25 worth of salsa  You can take that profit and get these fly traps. You and your customers will be glad you did 
Paco's Tacos,22,This is one of our favorite taco restaurants in town. Not only do they have good Mexican food but solid hamburger sliders too. Really good beer selection. Several different salsa options.
Paco's Tacos,23,I want to like this place  I do. It s in my hood  it s divey and  its not good.  I ate here twice in two days and while I loved the ramshackle appearance it just wasn t up to snuff. The portion size was on the small side  and while the food was good it was not outstanding. And white rice with a hit of paprika is not Spanish rice.  The lunch special the next day - tostada and small bowl of chicken tortilla soup - set me back ten bucks with coffee. What kind of a special with one small tostada is ten bucks   Friendly  Yes. Fast  Yes - you food will be out in about two minutes I kid you not. Yet you will not savor it  you will not be full and your wallet will be thinner. Just can t compete with so many good Tex-Mex places here in town.   I tried Paco.
Paco's Tacos,24,Their popularity was not a fair reason to dock a star. Excited to go back and please forgive me  Paco
Paco's Tacos,25,We got takeout in the afternoon. I got three different tacos that were all incredible. The sauces and salsas were tasty too. These are easily the best tacos in Mueller. I d say I ve had better in the city but for the area  I d definitely return. The wait for the food was a little longer than anticipated but not too bad 
Paco's Tacos,26,First night ever in Austin  and I came here as it was conveniently located across the street from my hotel. I wanted a quick dinner and just read while eating tacos. When I came in I was sort of lost  but it was pretty self explanatory. Go up to the counter  order  and they ll bring out your order. I think if it gets a bit too crazy they ll give you a table card or something so they can identify you  but when I went it was towards the end of closing so they knew which order was for who.  I ordered two tacos and a torta  the Hook em and barbacoa taco. Both of the tacos were so damn juicy and well flavored. There s only one taco per order  so just keep that in mind. The size of the taco is pretty big however. The torta was pretty plain  and I would recommend you to lean towards the tacos. The menu was pretty big  and it was a lot to take in  to read it on the boards. They however do have a proper menu.  One thing that I feel guilty about was that PACO S TACOS RECYCLE  I had no idea  and my one beer bottle I threw in the trash because I didn t know where to place it. However  I believe the recycling crate is stored under where they have the bottled beer.  Overall  this place is pretty great for tacos. I would definitely recommend the tacos. It s homey  and the restaurant recycles their bottles.
Paco's Tacos,27,First time  last time. I ordered the vegan taco which was basically just vinegary and greasy. I was not okay with it. All the staff were maskless  talking closely to customers.  I ordered a margarita and it had droplets of grease in it  totally like fat.
Paco's Tacos,28,Food and everything is mediocre and they re mask optional - so obviously don t care about safety of their employees or guests.  There are plenty of places in Austin that respect the community  - spend your money there instead.
Paco's Tacos,29,Always good eats. We love the atmosphere  the food  drinks  and the friendly service. They care that you are satisfied and happy. THX    
Paco's Tacos,30,Great tacos and that says a lot for being in Austin. The ordering is quick and the prices are fair. They could do a better job with picking up orders that are placed on the phone.. I have had to wait in line for phone orders and that s a bummer.
Paco's Tacos,31,I thought since the place has been around a while and has multiple locations that it was going to be a hit but oh was i wrong. the food was HORRIBLE. I took a safe route or  so i thought was safe  and got chicken and rice . you d think how could they mess up something so simple  well they did. no flavor whatsoever
Paco's Tacos,32,This is our regular taco joint. I just wish they would update their hours to reflect when they re actually going to be there. We ve come by several times over the last few years and found them closed.
Paco's Tacos,33,I ve driven by this place so many times and it has long been on my list of places to eat just cause it looked so cool. Also I must say that the name is very catchy and I love the Mueller area. One morning recently  I found myself fishing in Mueller early and decided to come over and stop for some breakfast tacos after with my dad.   The place was even cooler than I had thought. The set up and decor was cool and a lot of it. It was a truly unique experience and the staff was great. The price was cheap and the food was great. They also carbonated water out of the fountain at no charge.   All around the place was great. The price was well worth the value I received and I left feeling very satisfied with my meal. I m not huge into Mexican food  but this place was grade for breakfast tacos and you really get a good bang for your buck.
Paco's Tacos,34,I ve drove by this place a million times growing up and finally decide to give it a try today and I was not disappointed. The chilaquiles were really good and the staff was great. I ll definitely be back
Paco's Tacos,35,It s a very quaint and the staff is always wonderful  Food is prepared fresh andgreat deal for  
Paco's Tacos,36,Wow   Went there for lunch and had two tacos and a small portion of rice and received beans with a fountain drink.    17.50    Either that s inflation or something is wrong here.   The tacos were Tex Meh.  I guess they are passing off the cost to retain employees to the customer because there were a lot of them there.   Sorry at most it should had been an  11 lunch plate.
Paco's Tacos,37,The tacos  the quesco and the owner are AMAZING      So friendly      The tacos are so filling as well. Definitely coming here again  
Paco's Tacos,38,Lady at register was very rude I told her I ve never been here before and she looked aggravated and just said we have breakfast tacos and dinner tacos  she tried to stop me mid order to ask if that s all I want Very Rude. I haven t had a taco in Austin yet worth the money is there any good ones  13.50 for 3 tacos just ain t it like cmon. Meat was very dry btw
Paco's Tacos,39,I know there is no shortage of tacos in Austin  but this place is definitely a spot to try. My husband and I recently moved to the neighborhood and have made it our weekly Friday lunch spot. The tacos are amazing and the outdoor patio space is really cute and has a lot of seating options.
Paco's Tacos,40,I really want to like this place for its relaxing and authentic vibe  but after three occasions eating here I have to admit that the food is just not good. I ve had subpar enchiladas  margaritas and tacos at this point and have been unimpressed by everything except for the salsa selection.
Paco's Tacos,41,They have a sign outside which states service animals are OK to enter to order food then I would eat outside. But they kicked me and my service dog out saying no dogs allowed. I tried to say he was a service animal  and I have a card for him and everything  but they said no.   So...I guess I won t be back. With or without the service animal. This is strange for Austin....especially during Covid when I would be eating outside anyway.
Paco's Tacos,42,First time here and Margaret is awesome. Food was good too. Got a breakfast Gordita and it was bomb.
Paco's Tacos,43,The ambience is cozy and ecletic  The margaritas - mango especially were phenomenal  the woman running show was absolutely amazing and helped me decide what to order   the horchata and Torta was too good and salsa so yummy  We even got a brownie to go  also delicious  It was super cute and reasonably priced and will definitely go again  
Paco's Tacos,44,Randomly came across this unusual little house over on 51st by the Mueller area looking for some breakfast tacos and I m glad I stumbled upon it  They have great parking in the back and plenty  Most small businesses  you have to fend for street parking  etc   This little unusual house I would describe it as definitely  Keep Austin Weird  vibe and I like it   They have a lot of options and it looks like they also serve lunch and dinner which is fantastic for another visit on the way home from busy downtown.  I ordered 2 breakfast tacos  chorizo  potato  eggs and cheese with jalape os and they were wonderful 
Paco's Tacos,45,A converted house  the entrance is not obvious if you re a pedestrian since it faces the back parking lot. The wooden ramp to get into the restaurant was closed  perhaps due to icy weather  but that would suck for someone in a wheelchair that needed it. Not that there is much space to maneuver when you get inside. This is often the case with businesses  converted from houses.  I ordered the portabello and FTB tacos. They were better than anything I ve ordered from Torchy s. The portabello was better than the FTB. I wasn t a fan of the texture of the tempeh within the taco but it was seasoned well. I would return here again to try some of the other menu items.
Paco's Tacos,46,I don t know why I never heard or this place before on Instagram or in anyone s recommendations. I had the scallop  brisket taco  beef fajita and enchiladas plate  well  not ALL me  and everything was fresh and flavored well. I like the creativity of the scallops tacos although I wish they were the larger kind and it was cooked a bit chewy. Brisket taco was so moist  fatty and smokey with burnt ends. Amazing when you pair it with their 5-6 homemade sauces including a honey haberno one. Salty and sweet.. ugh. I m glad the enchiladas weren t given with just a pour of queso or pour of melted cheddar cheese. Meat was moist in the center  rice was also fluffy and moist. I don t even like Tex Mex so if I m recommending enchiladas you know it s good. I ll come back. I heard they have a great brunch menu.   In terms of logistics  we went on a early dinner Saturday and it was empty  again why idk  so we got everything timely and decor in and out cute as a hangout spot.
Paco's Tacos,47,This old house. No really  it s an old house converted into a restaurant and it s adorable. Paco s is family owned and inside feels homey right down to the plethora of eclectic mugs used for coffee. I placed an order to go of 2 tacos Hatch w  Shrimp and Gringo no chipotle mayo. Pros   -Service was good and quick -They re not short staffed...plenty of folks helping -Great conversationalists -Learned the history of Paco s -Menu is great -Prices are reasonable -Food is deliciously yummy    Cons  -Chatted too much and forgot to order beans and rice.  Ally kindly fixed this for me  -Asked for chips but they never made it on the order. Didn t realize it until I got home. -Got home and opened my tacos to see they were flour tortillas. Ugh. Again  chatting and I forgot to request corn.   The Hatch w  Shrimp will bring me back for sure. And next time I ll keep my chatting to a minimum so I can get my order right 
Paco's Tacos,48,. Solid queso and tacos. I haven t had anything I didn t love. Everyone has been friendly and the environment is unique. Lovely local spot 
Paco's Tacos,49,Loved the tacos here. Wandered here after buying the plants next door. The regular tacos came STUFFED and they werent messy. I forgot what I got  bit they were recommended by the cashier. DELICIOUS. Boyfriend got breakfast tacos and ye loved them. Excited to come back next time we go plant shopping 
Paco's Tacos,50,It s been 4 years  so I thought we should give them another try.  That was pretty dumb thinking.  I ordered the beef fajita nachos.  What I got were nachos that looked like something from a high school football game snack stand.  Cheap  stale round  chips  covered in Rico s cheese with something that appeared to be some sort of tomato like substance.  Watery  no flavor beans  some no flavor meat chunks and toss on some sort of shredded cheese like substance to give the appearance of... I don t even know. Add to that  guacamole  that is just terrible.   My fella got 3 different tacos to try  taking one bite from each and wrapping them up.  The homeless guy on 51st and Cameron was pretty excited to get it all  so at least it went to good use  There won t be a third try to this spot.
Paco's Tacos,51,Great big tacos and big taste. Affordable and an array of salsas. My friends love to go. Now a hidden cantina for HH.
Paco's Tacos,52,Today we ordered what they called  nachos   but when the grotesque thing showed up it wasn t recognizable as anything resembling a plate of nachos. A pile of tortilla chips  not the freshest  was randomly smeared with refried beans on top  then Velveeta-like queso was poured over the mess  gathering in congealed puddles at the bottom.  It was sloppy  tasteless  and obviously assembled by someone who just didn t give a damn.  We ve happily dined at Paco s Tacos for years  but were the only ones there today  and I think I may know why.
Paco's Tacos,53,The food and staff are amazing  Will definitely go back. Margaret is sweet and awesome  Love them.
Paco's Tacos,54,I randomly came across this place as I was driving by and was very happy I stopped by  A great place for tacos and queso.  Ambiance Service  The service here is pretty simple as you order your food upfront and then they will bring it to you after you order  and the staff is very friendly. The place at first took be back a little bit from the front of the place when you drive by as well as the outside of the house along with the inside. But hey  that is what makes this place charming and unique   Food Drinks  They have a few beers in bottle that you can get along with other drinks. They also have a frozen drink which we had  but it was a little too sweet for our liking and it was already pre-made  so it wasn t something they could change. The tacos we had were super good and will definitely be coming back for more  I had the steak and its definitely worth getting. I also got the queso which I also recommend. I can t say its the best  but it is one of the best in Austin and comes with ground beef  underneath the queso  as well as guacamole. When you dip your chip in and grab all of it  it is super good   will definitely be coming back again for some tacos and queso and would recommend checking this place out if you are in the area or hungry for some tacos.
Paco's Tacos,55,My favorite seafood tacos I ve gotten in Austin  To be fair  I haven t gotten much seafood in general here but still very pleased with the shrimp tacos.   Love the service I got when I was here as well. We were staring up at the big menu behind the register and the cashier offered us handheld menus to better read the options.   Vibes are cool too. I like the layout and decor of the place. Have already been twice in the past week 
Paco's Tacos,56,This place is awful with their customer service.  I don t remember the last tine my order was correct.  If you like to be surprised at what you get when you order  this place is for you.  Otherwise  don t bother
Paco's Tacos,57,Tacos were mid  brisket taco was garbage. So dry it tasted like ham. Coleslaw was better tasting than the brisket meat just cause it had some sign of moisture. I didn t think I d ever spend  40 for garbage. It makes a turd I guess. My fingers are crippled after eating the food.
Paco's Tacos,58,Note to future self  one taco is sufficient    The tacos here are serious business - they are about the mass of 2 street tacos  so I recommend your scale down your regular order accordingly. But they are tasty  And they have a self-serve salsa bar with a lot of options  so you can adjust to the spice level that s right for you.  Paco s is a funky place - the establishment is a house converted into a restaurant  so the indoor seating area is split into several small rooms. But the outside is a nice  backyard-y space with an outdoor bar and eclectic decor. It s not beautiful by Instagram standards  but it s comfortable and a great place to hang out with friends when the weather is nice 
Paco's Tacos,59,This used to be my favorite spot for breakfast tacos since their opening  and I used to constantly recommend it to my BnB guests. I m sad I won t be able to eat here again. Cook and cashier...no masks  and cashier was kinda flippant about it when I asked. My immunocompromised self can t afford to go here anymore. Also not willing to recommend a place that doesn t seem to give a crap about the health of their employees or customers. Was my weekly spot. Oh well.
Paco's Tacos,60,I can t believe that I lived in Austin for six years and never visited this place. I guess it took moving to a place devoid of Tex-Mex for me to really search for good spots whenever I m back in Texas. Whatever the reasoning  I m happy I finally dined at Paco s Tacos.   For one  the decor of this place is amazing  It s such an eclectic spot indoors and out. When you open the door to enter the restaurant  there is a stuffed animal  I think that s what it was   connected by a string  so that it moves every time the door opens. All throughout the restaurant  there s even more random  unique decor. This place has some definite character    The taco menu is pretty extensive. I went with the carne guisada  Paco s Pick  and BEC tacos. The cashier mentioned that all tacos are made on their homemade corn-flour mixture  but you can get just corn or flour upon request. I recommend going with the corn-flour  I really feel that specific tortilla enhanced my tacos. You could tell they were quite fresh and the flavor was on point  I can t wait to try their migas and queso.   The service here is also stellar. You can tell it s a joint where folks know one another and the people running the place are a family unit.   I liked this place enough to buy some breakfast tacos to take back to NYC with me. I m sure that when I eat them  I ll relive my wonderful experience dining here.
Paco's Tacos,61,Gross Ordered dinner tacos with rice and beans and it was gross  Paco Pollo and brisket Hook Em taco . The  chicken fajita  taco  Paco Pollo was mixed with pork and dark chicken meat. The brisket was easily days old and so disgusting I couldn t eat it. The poblano rice had a ton of butter in it  same  couldn t eat it.  The most disgusting part  Every single employee working in the kitchen was making the food and putting it together with bare hands. They were touching all of the food with bare hands. So gross. There was one guy who was eating and just walked right back through the kitchen. Someone was making cookies and touching them  making them into ball shape  with his bare hands.
Paco's Tacos,62,We normally enjoy eating here - but maybe they didn t have the same staff since it is the holidays     Enchiladas were not made as we ordered and refried beans were the worst - tasted like they came out of a can that was expired.  The carne guisada plate was cold and meat was tough    Hardly any gravy just a ton of pico on top.  Too bad - this used to be a great place but will be looking for another Mexican restaurant in this area after that meal   
Paco's Tacos,63,Called in order and lady who answer was short and rude. She kept finishing my sentences for me and when I finally completed my order she said okay thanks and hung up the phone. I arrived 20 mins after placing my call only to find that my order was never sent into the kitchen. I didn t even receive an apology for the inconvenience or anything. Ridiculous really. I decided to not wait another 20 mins for my food to be ready and left.
Paco's Tacos,64,One of the hidden gems of Austin.  Old time Austin funky and great food together aren t always as easy to find together as you d think  but Paco s has it down.  The surroundings alone make it funky Austin.  It s a converted old house with a maze of a parking lot. At least in the evening  the parking lot is navigable enough for a large SUV to find plenty of space and room to maneuver  though. And the inside of the house brings back memories of other converted Austin gems like Danny Young s Texicalli Grille on Oltorf.  Yep  it s got that kind of old Austin feel to it.  The food is equally amazing.  It s not quite Torchy s and not quite a taqueria.  Imagine a really good taqueria adapted slightly for funky Austin.  You ve got Paco s.  Now you have everything from authentic tortas and gorditas  including barbacoa and carnitas  to vegan tacos. Since this is Austin  they re also required to have good queso and a good salsa bar.  They deliver on this too.  The real stars of the show  though  are the mixed corn flour tortilla which may be my new favorite tortilla and their made to order breakfast tacos  which compete with anyplace in town..  Here s hoping that Paco s remains just as it is for a very long time.
Paco's Tacos,65,When writing a review on something as basic  but as varied as a taco  one must evaluate from the outside in. I like to start with the tortilla. A bad tortilla can ruin a good taco and no good taco can start with a crappy store bought tortilla. Whether you choose flour or corn doesn t matter as long as you choose fresh.   This was my first time to try Paco s Tacos and he had me at tortilla. The comal toasted tortilla was perfection with little toasty bits of char. Perfecto  se or   I tasted the barbacoa  succulent beef  seasoned and topped with pick and  at my request  avocado. It was tender  moist and full of flavor  but not full of fatty bits  which was nice.   The carnitas taco was also tasty and juicy. The tortilla held up on both and I left satisfied.   The tacos  at least the two I tried  were fairly basic. No exotic ingredients  no new and exciting flavor combos. The restaurant is small but has a large outdoor area and if happily return to sample more tacos  but maybe look for some less simple combos next time.
Paco's Tacos,66,It s really unfortunate that a neighborhood place has to be so difficult about their five dollar credit card limit. I literally haven t experienced a restaurant who does this in over five years. It s super antiquated and they are plenty busy not to have this rule. The funny thing is the only person that ever makes a stink about this is the owner. And she was super rude about it.   I tip every time on my  2.75 Taco  I probably get tacos here at least 2-3 times a week.   The breakfast tacos are really the only thing that I like and you can t really mess those up. There are plenty of other places for good Mexican food  the lunch tacos in my opinion are terrible. If I m gonna have to go out of my way to get cash  I m gonna go to an authentic Mexican food trailer that s closer to my house. When I said this to the owner  she said that s fine and didn t care. As a business owner myself  I know that losing a customer over  1.50 and a few cents on your merchant account isn t what s important  it s about the word of mouth that your customers have. As a happy customer I literally tell people about this place all the time. As and unhappy customer I have the same tool. Is that worth it to you  Paco s     Then I asked for for salsas that weren t dirty outside  apparently it was just thawed ice  and the owner was trying to be extra nice but her daughter made a snide comment about them not being dirty.   I know you don t care about this one customer... But you should.  That s just good business.
Paco's Tacos,67,Ohhhh Paco s. Between all the high rise apartment buildings and generic restaurants popping up in Mueller  Paco s keeps Austin weird. I think this establishment is owned by a tight knit family  and they have been in the area for a long time. It s structured like a small shack cantina with a lot of outdoor seating. Like eating at Uncommon Objects  tons of knick knacks and gadgets fill the wall space and the yard area.  I ve come here twice to try out their lunch tacos. The carnitas taco was my favorite  compared with the barbacoa and the picadillo. A nostalgic things about carnitas is the smoothness of biting into juicy pork and instant spiciness  just no something Paco s offers overall. Barbacoa is basically a log of unattractive meat. Most surprisingly  Picadillo is a ground beef stew  chopped carrots and steamed potato included  in a tortilla  A soggy experience.  Since this eatery is one of the few located near the work places in the area  I know I ll be back to try out nachos and breakfast tacos. The difference salsas they offer add to the spunkiness of Paco s.
Paco's Tacos,68,What I had   APPS - Queso Compuesto  it s not guacamole and beef queso not as partners  but as lovers. The dollop of guac is dropped into the queso. And it s good  The queso is especially impressive  though I m not as much of a fan of the beef part. Just a little too heavy. But it s delicious and addictive.  ENTREES - The  23  Sliders  it s very good  The bread  the beef  cheese  etc. is all very good. You don t taste the avocado that much  but  it s necessary to keep balance and keep the whole thing  wet  enough.  - Beef Gordita  it was meh  but that s on me. The torta is a little dry  but I think I think I m not much of a cornmeal girl. The beef is tender and not dry  the peppers and onions good  but it was lacking in flavor overall. Perhaps I m a gross American that likes too much salt  but it could ve used some more salt or something. It was overall kind of bland.  I wouldn t get this again. Or any gordita  I think.   - La Vieira Taco  the scallops were bite sized  not jumbo  shrimp sized. They were all perfectly cooked which is super hard for scallops  I think I would ve appreciated larger scallops though  because it would ve been easier to eat. The slaw was yummy. If you like scallops  I think this a great choice.  though  I probs wouldn t get it again. I m kinda lukewarm on scallops.   A super solid place for food y all  I ll probs bring visiting friends here.
Paco's Tacos,69,We thoroughly enjoyed our meal this past weekend  and even though my husband has ordered tacos to-go before  we ve never been to eat in the restaurant. Besides the scratchy uncomfortable chairs  they really hurt my legs    which I dinged a star  this is our new favorite spot  Service was extremely pleasant  and the food came super fast.  After reading some of the other reviews on Yelp  I m not sure what people are expecting from a casual  local Tex Mex spot. Paco s is exactly what I expected  fast  great prices-good value  not pretentious  and friendly service. I would say that their decor is borderline too kitschy for my taste  but it s endearing. We got 3 breakfast tacos and Chilaquiles   5.75 before 11AM  add Chorizo. My Chilaquiles was spicy  flavorful  and the tortilla pieces strips were bite size which was a nice surprise. My husbands tacos were all very big and he ended up not finishing one. Nothing is over  10-even dinner plates  that s hard to find with Tex Mex spots these days. Overall  looking forward to return and try their drinks 
Paco's Tacos,70,yesterday. I watched her walk take-out orders to customers and hand them off without gloves or a mask or any sort of protection system. It is not difficult to do parking spot take out like many other local restaurants. And a cashier wearing a mask is the minimum basic human-decency and health-safety measure I d expect of any restaurant. Covid-19 cases and deaths are still rising in Texas and Travis County at this point. Even if you feel that the economy is more important than health it still make sense to prevent the spread of this pandemic with simple measures like having the person the the most human contact in your restaurant wear a mask  Paco s staff and management should be ashamed of themselves. I certainly won t be going back.
Paco's Tacos,71,I ve driven by this place many many times on the way to the Mueller area but never actually stopped by until today. A friend and I were in the mood for trying something new and mexican so we found Paco s on yelp.  In short  its a very homey restaurant with very homestyle type food. I got a chicken taco and a carne guisada and they taste like something your mom would make. Chicken taco was a LOT of seasoned thigh meat  some rice stuffed in and some sauteed vegetables with some cheese on top - similar to taco night that my family would do sometimes so kinda below my expectations actually but its hefty for sure. The carne guisada is amazing - rich gravy and chunks of meat. I regret not just getting the plate of that so that I could have more of it.  The salsas are pretty good too - the poblano one is my favorite but all are fresh. The smell is intoxicating.  However  I am not a fan of their tortillas. Corn flour hybrid sounds great in theory - flour pliancy and chew imbued with great taste  but the ones here are neither here nor there. You don t get much corn taste and the tortillas don t have the texture of flour either. It s literally in between both  so you don t get to experience the goodness of either side but left with something thats just meh. If anything its a bit jarring.  But ya  would come back for the guisada and possibly breakfast tacos - they re cheap here 
Paco's Tacos,72,Paco s is a great little neighborhood hang-out with killer breakfast tacos  some great traditional Tex Mex dishes  burgers  daily specials  and a fun  casual atmosphere with ample indoor and outdoor seating. The restaurant is usually pretty busy  but don t worry. You won t have to wait too long for your food. They always seem to be well-staffed with an efficient team.   My favorite thing at Paco s  aside from the great food  are the cool coffee mugs that are available at breakfast. I always enjoy picking out the perfect one to fit my mood. It s the little things  y all   So the next time you re looking for a cool Taco experience  I recommend Paco s  and their awesome assortment of salsas. Have fun 
Paco's Tacos,73,A really good places for tacos  They have a good shrimp taco and also fish  There is parking here so don t worry about that. The staff are also very friendly. Let s just say it HITS 
Paco's Tacos,74,Some of my favorite Tex mex in Austin  and that is saying something. Love their in house blended tortillas and how dog friendly their space is.
Paco's Tacos,75,Had Mother s Day breakfast here  as well as breakfast tacos this weekend. I got a visit on the patio from the neighborhood rabbit looking for a morsel  he was so big from all the extras.  The service  menu selection and food is all great. Their customer service is above and beyond  the atmosphere keeps me coming back.
Paco's Tacos,76,Have always driven by this place  but I finally made the stop this time  I encourage you to come if you like breakfast tacos  they were really good. The salsas were also good  amp  had a good kick to them.   Only thing I wasn t crazy for was the tortilla soup. I love love love tortilla soup  amp  try it everywhere but it didn t do it for me here  other than that this place is great 
Paco's Tacos,77,Fast  friendly service and great tacos in a very hip  Texan setting. Come check out the new outdoor upgrades  including mister fans and an awesome shade structure 
Paco's Tacos,78,Me gusta Paco s tacos  I live south so I always try to stop at Paco s if I m going to be in that area. Definitely my favorite North-ish breakfast spot. Lunch sounds delicious but I haven t had the occasion to try it yet.   The Big Man is delicious  good to share with another person. Their tacos are also big and very reasonable at only  2. Other places nearby charge  3-6 for most of their tacos.   Great patio with well tended succulents and funky industrial-esque decor. Dogs welcome.
Paco's Tacos,79,We were actually on our way to Torchy s when we made a last minute decision to turn left into Paco s Tacos. It s super cute on the inside--an old converted house with a cozy and relaxed atmosphere.  Service wasn t particularly helpful when we got up to the register since the guy was distracted figuring out someone else s order. He also didn t let us know whether or not someone would bring the food out  so one of awkwardly kept hanging around the counter and eventually figured out that orders were kind of just called out.  Sadly the food itself isn t that great. The queso compuesto was too runny and didn t have any guacamole in it despite what the menu said. The mushroom and spinach quesadilla was good  but while one side was nice and crisp  the other side was completely soggy. The gringo taco was OK  as was the chicken tostada. Worse were the margaritas that were too slushy and tasted off.  We wanted to love this place  we really did  And we hate to think that Torchy s--which has become so corporate and tacky with its ridiculous overexpansion--is better  but it is. Don t think that we ll be back but wouldn t blame others for trying for a better experience than ours.
Paco's Tacos,80,This is a great place to go and grab some delicious tacos. They are friendly too which makes it a pleasant experience. I would recommend trying each salsa since they are unique in taste. A must try in Austin Mueller area. It s right off 35 so if you re driving through you gotta try a taco  Tell them Trey sent ya    ORANGE is definitely my favorite   
Paco's Tacos,81,I ordered the FTB tacos first  but they had a funny taste. I couldn t finish the taco. So  I ordered the portobello taco next and it was okay. Both pretty bland. Nothing special.    The place itself was interesting and gave a certain feel. Not too sure how I feel about the logo -- a taco wearing a sombrero -- really 
Paco's Tacos,82,5 years ago I moved to Austin. I knew it would never be home but I wanted to find the spots around town that would make it feel like home every time I walked through the for. For me  Pacos has always been that breakfast place where you can see a families heart shining through every book  amp  cranny.  The food has never once wavered in quality. The menu has barely changed  the salsas are still  hands down  the very best in Austinand the customer service in all those 5 years has never once dipped below stellar.  So this Sunday Morning  when I thought  what s the one place in Austin that I want to kick off my farewell week with who was I kidding  It was always gonna be paco s Yay for the expanded parking lot 
Paco's Tacos,83,I really wanted to like Paco s. The building and location itself is really cute and the ambience outside is nice. However the bouquet of smells inside left much to be desired. Trudging through the scent of toilet bowel cleaner  we marched on  determined in our quest. 2 margaritas and chips w queso. Woof. The queso was literally Rico s cheese. Yes  the kind you find at a hockey game. Okay fine  they must have really good margs..  Actually the marg was essentially an off brand bud lime-a-Rita poured over ice. After  20 for this fine football game fare  we left hungry and defeated.
Paco's Tacos,84,Nice place   The food was great and quite fairly priced.  Although I purchased carryout twice I look forward to trying the outdoor seating.
Paco's Tacos,85,Super Strong 4  amp  1 2   Awesome  real-Austin  establishment.  The customized  migas  amp  chorizo taco on a perfectly light and fluffy flour tortilla just may well have been the most perfectly proportioned breakfast taco I have eaten in this town  and at this point I have eaten many many many of them here.  That pillowy refined flour cloud of deliciousness wrapped around the harmonious mixture of fried eggs  spicy meaty  ground sausage  and just slightly deliciously stale tortilla chips like a mitten from food heaven. The resulting taco was the perfect sized  substantial but not unwieldy.  2 tacos left me satisfied yet not uncomfortably full.  The same could not be said for my brother-in-law Paco s big man  which basically consisted of the contents of what is commonly known as a Hungry Man hero at the delis where I grew up on Long Island  namely 2 fried eggs  fried potatoes  onions and peppers.  Here this massive amount of breakfast foods is served with a massive burrito size flour tortilla  resulting in something one might call an open-faced burrito  might they be so inclined.  He was barely able to finish the thing  which is saying something considering I have seen him put away amounts of food copious enough to do both his Midwestern heritage and adopted home state of Texas proud.      In addition to perfectly executed and exceptionally fresh-tasting Tex-Mex this place offers both legit and increasingly rare Austin quirkiness  we visited on Christmas eve and the sign out front proclaimed  Brown Santa here   and a cool comfortable vibe and spacious  leafy and lovely outdoor eating area. Best of all however is the honest sincere yet easygoing and above all  exceedingly friendly service.  Weeks later I still clearly remember the impression the warmth of the staff left on me.
Paco's Tacos,86,Has a very cool rustic feel  used to go here a ton with my dad. The staff is awesome as well as the selection  would reccomend
Paco's Tacos,87,I really don t understand how this place stays in business. The breakfast tacos are inedible  and my standards truly aren t high. I will happily eat a gas station taco. These are rubber. The lunch offerings are technically edible  but a long way from good or tasty. Once or twice a year I ll give them a try again  just in case  and it always leaves me baffled.
Paco's Tacos,88,I was so excited to write this review because I love Paco s  I ve eaten here for lunch and I ve also ordered catering from them. Both of which were delicious  I have to brag about the catering though- we got 10lbs of fajita meat with peppers  cheese  tortillas  and salsa for  86.00   It fed over 40 people and came out to less than  2 a taco.  Anywhere else  its over  200 to feed that many people . As you can tell from the attached photo  everyone ate it up.  I read another review and they were disappointed with the shrimp  but I haven t had that kind of taco here. And to be honest  I wouldn t order shrimp from Paco s anyways. I save my seafood for a seafood restaurant or a surf and turf food truck. But maybe that s just me.  The location itself is super fun with a lot of PARKING  and outdoor indoor seating. I guarantee if you go to Paco s you will not be disappointed  
Paco's Tacos,89,We went for Breakfast  I got a create your own Taco and my friend got the Raise and shine sandwich. We loved our food.
Paco's Tacos,90,This place is not good. Not sure how anyone likes it. Although to be fair my gf likes it. The first time I was here I tried the bigman. Not good. The salsa made everything cold.  The second time I tried the special which I believe was tortilla soup and a tostada. Nothing tasted good. The tortilla soup didn t taste anything like tortilla soup usually tastes like. It tasted like it was based on chicken soup broth. Yuck.
Paco's Tacos,91,Stopped here with my boys before a school event   the AISD PAC. My oldest had come here before and always talked about how tasty it was  and boy-oh-boy  he was spot on.   Tried the Paco s Pick taco as well as a cheese enchilada plate. The tacos were little bites of perfection and the tomatillo salsa was a perfect companion. The cheese enchiladas with the sour cream sauce was tasty  unexpectedly a little spicy and the borracho beans were the tastiest I ve had in Austin.   This place is a happy dive of deliciousness. A definite must go if you find yourself near Mueller and are just Torchy Taco ed out and looking for a little more taco love  amp  good old fashioned Austin.   Keep us the great work 
Paco's Tacos,92,I went last night and ordered the Carnitas and the Gringo tacos. The Carnitas was a bit too salty for me  but the pork was juicy and tender. The Gringo had shrimp and mango which I also love  but I wish the taco was spiced a bit better. For me it was a bit underwhelming in terms of the burst of flavor. HOWEVER  Paco s Tacos is a true mom and pop style Texan hot-spot and is adorned with contrasting  colorful decorations. The staff is very helpful and their beverages are priced very decently. In addition  they have specials throughout the week - I believe they told me that beers and mimosas are  2 during happy hour and they have taco specials daily as well. I will be back to try some other things off their menu. I would - 8 10 - recommend this place 
Paco's Tacos,93,After two visits  I feel confident giving a review.  Our first visit was for breakfast and the tacos were great but the Paco s Big Man was easily my favorite. The queso was also delicious but not quite as warm as my wife would have liked. The biggest bonus for me is the salsa bar. They have a great variety of salsas that go really well with the queso.  For lunch  I over-did it a bit by ordering three tacos. A disclaimer  These are big tacos  two is plenty for most folks. We got the following tacos  Paco s Pick  Gringo  Hook  Em  Bandito  and Barbacoa. Our favorites were the Bandito and the Gringo. They were all seriously delicious. Quick  friendly service  beer  and delicious tacos  Yeah I m a fan.
Paco's Tacos,94,Oh Yelp you did us wrong  Paco s Tacos was listed as one of the top taco establishments in Austin and I do not agree. The only good that came out of there was the queso. We ordered Paco s Pick  Paco s Bandito and the Picadillo. The tacos were very bland and soggy. There is nothing redeeming about this place or tacos. I will not be back.
Paco's Tacos,95,The owner has very bad customer service  I have a background for customer service for over 10 years and never experienced bad customer service. She is very rude over the phone and I would never go back there 
Paco's Tacos,96,When I first moved to Austin I was extremely excited to try Austin tacos because you hear about them nonstop. This was the first place in the city that I tried and I was kind of disappointed. I took an employees recommended and ordered some sort of big taco. It wasn t very good and it was cold.   Now I love tacos and I really didn t want to leave with a bad taste about the place I tried before everyone else. So I decided to give it another try on a different occasion.   The 2nd Time was a little bit worse. The staff seem to be i their own world talking about their own personal lives and took some time to even approach me at the counter. Because they have lives too I didn t really care because I just wanted food. After asking some more suggestions  because last time wasn t good  the guy at the counter didn t really seem to care. He just kind of told me to  go with what I know . Obviously I m asking you for a reason bro. I ended up just picking something basic  potato and egg  and taking it to go.   Once I got home with 4 tacos for my friend and I  I check the back and the orders were completely wrong. They were yet again not warm and even got they wrong tacos. I will not be returning here again  it sucks because this was my first impression on Austin tacos and this city seems to take pride in that. Oh well.
Paco's Tacos,97,six years later  I love this place even more. the menu has been updated to get that vegan crowd in there  with tempeh  veg chorizo  amp  a vegan taco on the menu.  we sat outside in the cool morning weather  and let the little littles explore the patio  which is super kid friendly with toy dump trucks and somewhere  there s a BUNNY.  I desperately looked for this bunny  as I wanted to give him a hug  but maybe next time.  oh. the patio - while the little littles played  I was able to eat with both hands  and enjoy a beverage too. no one needed anything from me. no one asked me for anything. I just enjoyed breakfast by myself.  if you re a parent of little kids  you know that shit never happens. I quietly enjoyed my breakfast so much  that I forgot I had children  amp  eventually found them sitting with another couple  amp  their dog.   oops.
Paco's Tacos,98,Oohhh shhiittt watch out. Prepare yourself  if you step decide to eat at this magical place your mind will be blown. Your tastebuds will discover mouth heroine. And your existence will be complete. These tacos are a testament to what hundreds of thousands of years human evolution and culinary innovation can accomplish. And brisket tacos are dope too.
Paco's Tacos,99,This place is great  I ate here for breakfast and ordered the big man. I recommend this restaurant to any person looking for an fulfilling meal 
Paco's Tacos,100,The tacos here are decent  certainly not among the best in Austin  but I ll probably never go here again.  Last week I called in 8 tacos to go  including two vegetarian tacos for my vegetarian wife. When I came to pick them up 15 minutes later  what they told me   I had to wait another 10 minutes or so  which isn t a big deal. The issue  however  was when I got home  we only had 7 tacos. The missing taco was one of the vegetarian tacos. My wife was a little annoyed  but it got worse. As she started eating her other vegetarian taco  she found bits of bacon in it. It s clear that they were careless in scooping up the egg and got whatever bacon bits was on the griddle.  So while everyone else ate their tacos  my wife had nothing to eat for lunch. Of course I called and complained  and whoever answered the phone was obviously annoyed at me for calling and just told me he d refund the two tacos without any apologies.   It s been about a week and there has been no refund to my credit card. Without calling and making a stink  I doubt I d ever see a refund. I have long thrown away the receipt. The point is  I shouldn t waste more of my time to get a  6-7 refund.   There are too many good places in town to go back to Paco s.
Paco's Tacos,101,In town from Southern California for the USC vs. Texas game and was hoping to find some decent Mexican food.  Paco s Tacos did not disappoint.  The portions were GIGANTIC  We ordered carnitas  fajita taco  loaded nachos  and a barbacoa taco. Everything was amazing. Good beer selection as well. Give Paco s a try  you won t be disappointed.
Paco's Tacos,102,Meh...  We were a party of 5 and ordered quite a diverse cross section of the menu and were quite disappointed-food wise. Now  in terms of cool factor-this place is awesome  Nice  laidback atmosphere and up and coming location.   Back to the food....  Sad  but true...the menu is bland and uninspired. Store bought chips  queso that tastes like it came from a can  forgettable tortillas and a menu that sounds cool  but ultimately disappointed. This is not really anything better than can be found in a multitude of mediocre restaurants.   If this place were located in the Northeast  well maybe the Yelp rating would be justified....but in Central Texas   No way. I know tacos. Mexico City  San Diego  South Texas all have their  taste . Paco s is neither trying to innovate or even imitate...just lazy.
Paco's Tacos,103,Great tacos  great service  great staff  4-5 salsas to try  fun atmosphere  and a variety of non taco options if you re in the mood for something different. My new favorite spot 
Paco's Tacos,104,Looks like a cool spot to hang out with family and friends. Decorations are super cute  I ordered a shrimp enchilada to go  but can t rate it properly since I ate it later on after reheating it. But I m excited to try more there  There s a lot of parking in the back which was nice too.
Paco's Tacos,105,There are a LOT of great taco places in Austin  but this is one of my favorite. I like coming here and sitting on their covered patio with fans  but I also order deliveries here a lot  too  The staff is always great and friendly  and the food is reliably good 
Paco's Tacos,106,Solid tacos omg. We also had the queso which was super tasty. Really fresh ingredients and loved the tortillas. The sauces stole the show though. Green sauce and salsa were so so good I couldn t stop dipping my fork in one the tacos were gone.   Another plus is that this place isn t too popular yet so there wasn t a huge line.   A new fave would love to come back.
Paco's Tacos,107,Fun atmosphere and great food  We stopped in for coffee and breakfast tacos and I just wanted to linger in their awesome outdoor area all day... All our tacos were great  You pick two ingredients from a long list. My favorites were probably the bacon egg and chorizo avacado. My mouth is watering a little bit just thinking about them  Salsa bar is a nice touch and everything we sampled from there was fresh and flavorful.
Paco's Tacos,108,I don t know why it took me so long to visit Paco s Tacos for the first time  but wow have I been missing out. This unassuming building with extremely limited parking yet plentiful outdoor seating on 51st St. delivers some truly fantastic  and cheap  tacos. You seriously can t go wrong at lunchtime with a build-your-own breakfast taco   one of their named tacos. I m a huge fan of the Chicken Fajita Taco and the Hatch Chicken Taco. Top it off with some of their delicious basic Red Salsa or Habanero Sauce and you re good to go   The staff has always been exceedingly friendly every time I ve visited here 
Paco's Tacos,109,Pretty embarrassed it took me so long to review Paco s Taco s as I ve been going for years. Things I love about Paco s   - Delicious tacos - large assortment of breakfast  lunch and dinner tacos. Each is generously filled.  - Friendly staff and quick service - some weekends you can wait  10 minutes for food but it s worth it. On weekdays  breakfast tacos to go are pretty quick.  - Fun decor inside and out - great dog friendly patio.  - Chilaquiles  amp  their rice   yum  - Coffee - they have local  fair-trade coffee from Texas Coffee Traders   their own Paco s Blend    I love Paco s  amp  their tacos  Highly recommend going there 
Paco's Tacos,110,Visiting Austin. This place was near our Airbnb so we just decided to check it out.. it did NOT disappoint. My entire family enjoyed their meal. I had the gringo shrimp taco  amp  Paco s pick  amp  the chicken gordita. All amazing. Also honey habanero  hot sauce paired sooooo well with the food. Overall so great.
Paco's Tacos,111,After Torchy s losing my order and having to pay for hour old tacos twice  we switched to Tyson s. After tiring of Tyson s staffs constant pissy attitudes and then seeing the Tyson s owners numerous tweets of bigotry we made the switch to Paco s. After my first Paco s bite I had regretted wasting my time at all previous taco places. Seriously the best quality breakfast tacos you will find in Austin. Top notch house made tortillas  white Monterey Jack cheese melted in  and the best breakfast potatoes........what else can you ask for  There was even one instance where my online order didn t go through and from the time I got there they rushed our order out in 5-10 minutes. This is the absolute only taco place I ve been to that actually cares about customer service and are friendly and courteous to their customers. The only taco place I ll be recommending from now on 
Paco's Tacos,112,As already mentioned  the parking is terrible. Go right past Paco s and park on the neighborhood street if it s at all busy.  Otherwise this place is fabulous. The food is cheap  giant and delicious. The queso is great  the tacos are great and quesadilla was huge and fabulous. There s a small indoor seating area but lots of room outside  so Paco s is great on a nice day. It s got an eclectic look and feel and the employees are always super friendly so it s always my post picking up visitors at the airport stop.I love Pacos.
Paco's Tacos,113,I. Love. This. Place.   I m a vegetarian  love Mexican and Texmex food and was looking for a great place in my general area that s not downtown or south Austin. This place is a true gem  I had it twice in one week when I first discovered it  The parking is atrocious but honestly  it s worth it.   The laid back culture  outdoor seating  friendly service  despite being constantly busy    fantastic menu and veggie options made this place an instant favorite of mine.   Tip  If you get coffee  be sure to use their adorable vintage coffee mugs and nix the styrofoam 
Paco's Tacos,114,This is exactly the type of local business I love to support. Breakfast tacos are amazing  family owned and run by an extremely friendly staff  and just a very comfortable atmosphere. It gets busy on the weekends  so you may want to call ahead. I d highly recommend the Big Man if you want a taco alternative 
Paco's Tacos,115,A disclaimer  I don t care if you re from LA or the RGV and think that you have divinely privileged insight into what a taco is supposed to be. Really  I don t. Aztec gods did not  in fact  give you their book of recipes  so if you think that  3.50 is too much for a taco  or that certain ingredients belong on a codex of proscribed books  please stay the f ck home and for the love of gods  don t tell me about it. Paco s won t be your thing.   Okay  I feel better. So  anyway  these are fusion tacos gringo tacos whateverthehell you wanna call  em tacos  and they re good. Tons o  seafood and veggie options  really good salsas  some with powerful heat. Prices are in Torchy s Tacodeli range  which is to say that it will take  10- 15 to feed you. If that causes you to blow a gasket  then I suppose Taco Bell still has locations in town. I think it s fine for what you re getting. The fish  shrimp  and scallop tacos were lovely  the chicken and tortilla soup good if fairly standard.  There was a  2 bloody mary mimosa special. I think they might have gotten a fifth star just for that.  Paco s itself oozes local charm  the building obviously a former residence with tiny  secluded little rooms with Mexican kitsch everywhere surrounded by an adobe wall around an enclosed courtyard. If we didn t have someplace to be  several more rounds of cheap drinks just might have happened.   The staff were sooooooper friendly to us  talking us through the menu and chatting with us about the Indiana Jones double feature we were about to catch at Blue Starlite. We felt welcomed in a way that seemed genuine and unforced.   So  since this is on the way to our summer movie hangout  I see a return trip in the future. For those arriving by car  parking is limited  so you might have to do the mall across the street and hoof it. But you should. It s worth it.
Paco's Tacos,116,Found this place after leaving a nearby Home Depot and decided to give it a try.  I like non-commercial corporate restaurants and this one did not disappoint.  I had the Paco s Bandito taco which is essentially a beef fajita  the Hatch with chicken and a barbacoa.  The Barbacoa was pretty good and i would order it again.  They make food to order and it comes out hot.  The seating is limited inside but ample.  They also offer cold beer to wash down your food.  The parking lot and driveway is not the best  but it is not enough to stop me from coming here again when I am in the area.
Paco's Tacos,117,Consistently good  The staff is always friendly and the variety of sauces is a huge plus. I love the outdoor patio and general chill vibe   homemade cookies brownies they sell at the counter  obviously
Paco's Tacos,118,Disappointed by my recent visit. I ordered a fish taco and a hatch Chile black bean taco. Both were soggy and bland. The fish had been broiled rather than fried  and it was soft and flavorless. I missed the crunchy texture you expect from well-seasoned  fried fish in most decent Austin taco joints. Shame that Paco s has dropped the ball.
Paco's Tacos,119,I drive past this place all the time while going to the grocery store and was happy to finally try it for lunch.  The good and the bad   Pro s   They have a great patio and it s reasonably priced   Con s   The food service is slow  small parking lot  hard to get back out on the street if you are trying to turn right and the food flavoring was just not there.  Also  you may have an air conditioning vent drip on your food  drink and or table.  Shrimp Taco  amp  Scallop Taco   I ordered a plate that comes with a taco and a side but  added an additional taco.  I have to say I was completely disappointed at the lack of seasoning and flavor in the tacos.  The meat and toppings were just so bland and they all melded together.  The tortilla was hard around the edges and not all that great either.  Queso  amp  Chips  This was the side that I selected with my plate.  The queso was very cheesy and the chips were fresh.    My recommendation is to come here to sit on their beautiful patio  eat queso and chips and drink some margaritas with friends.  Beyond that I would get my tacos elsewhere 
Paco's Tacos,120,Food is good as well their sauces  Pretty happy that we tried the place. Place is corky but clean.
Paco's Tacos,121,Me and family just came here and was delish.  Everyone was welcoming and food was great.  Hope they think about opening one up in NYC 
Paco's Tacos,122,One of my favorite places. One might think tacos are too easy to be a thing but they are. More dynamic than avocado toast and easily more satisfying Paco s tacos are just doggone good. I have typically only been around for breakfast and have tried lots of the breakfast selections. I m not one for routine but this place almost gets me to commit.  I m going to have to see how it is at other times and how it is for a mobile workplace. However  with an environment so comfortable and homey if I m here too much I might end up being pulled behind the counter too. Love me some Paco s
Paco's Tacos,123,A hidden gem  Paco s is located right by the 51st Mueller HEB complex but is surrounded by houses on the main road instead of in any sort of complex. They do have a pull in parking lot in the back that is decently sized. I came in for breakfast at 8 30am on a Saturday so I don t know how busy it can get or if parking ever becomes a problem  but there was more than enough when I came in. There is plenty of seating both outside and inside  and you can t forget the quirky hipster Texas random decor splattered throughout the restaurant. I love it  Thumbs up Paco s interior exterior designer.   My friend ordered the Big Man and I wasn t too hungry so I ordered a single Gringo Taco. Both were delicious. They also offer  not one  not two  not three  but five salsa options at their salsa bar by the utensils. Gotta love the power of options. The Gringo had some fine tasting shrimp and is the closest I ve gotten to a San Diego Surf and Turf equivalent here in Austin. The Big Man  although not my dish  was freakin  big. You ll be full after downing that plate  I assure you. My friend wanted to eat it as a burrito and had to eat some of the stuffing before being able to successfully roll it up. Also note that neither one of us are expert burrito wrappers  but my point is  there s a lot that goes into the Big Man. And all of it is yumssss.
Paco's Tacos,124,First of all  would like to address the owner s wife  Margaret  who is awfully rude when talking to her via telephone  or in person  when placing an order to go  or in-house  as well as one of her daughters.  I ve ordered delivery from Paco Tacos. You have to pay additional for to-go orders...50 cents to  1.00 each per container  which can add up  very quickly.  Also  I like fresh coffee  I always tell the waiter waitress to make a fresh pot  and when the coffee arrives  it s ice cold  and very strong  I can t even drink it. I was told by the waitress that the owner s wife wants them to finish the pot  and it doesn t matter how long it s been sitting.  Also  one of my neighbors was walking her dog  and witnessed a Hispanic girl taking food out of her car  which was my house  when delivering my food. And  this was in the hot summer month. Also  she witnessed the delivery driver smoking in the car  as well. My neighbor has witnessed both  her delivering my  taking it our of her car and out of the trunk .  I placed a call to Margret  and didn t seemed  to care  one way or another. She told me  not to be a customer of her restaurant    Haven t eaten there since.
Paco's Tacos,125,This place is amazing. Great little place  nothing fancy but just great food. The staff is super friendly and are happy to accommodate you any way they can. They have a large menu from breakfast taco s and plates to lunch and dinner options. They also have a salsa bar  which is always a plus. My wife opted to build her own breakfast taco  they did not complain about how many items we wanted on it they said they would be happy to make it fit. Now that s service. I ordered the chilaquiles  the egg was cooked perfectly and the fried tortillas in salsa  was extremely spicy  but had great flavor. Definitely worth checking out. And if you are an early bird they open at 6 30 am.
Paco's Tacos,126,I ve passed this place many times thinking it would be impossible to park. Man  was I wrong - there s parking galore in the back  Three stars for solid but not exceptional food  and five stars for a great atmosphere. The old house provides a rambling maze of places to sit inside  and the options outside offer even greater variety.  Seems like a cool place to hang with friends for drinks and food  especially outside on a mild spring or fall afternoon or evening.
Paco's Tacos,127,Yum  First time here and I was kind of dragged here because I live South. I ordered the chips and salsa and cheese enchiladas with red sauce. All were very tasty. I finished off my meal with a brownie that was baked that day. I ate over the afternoon  so glad I got it  very rich and perfect  The staff was also very nice and attentive  coming room to room to clean often.
Paco's Tacos,128,Came here to grab a couple tacos for lunch and was surprised by the eccentricity of this place. There is much more to this place than meets the eye and it was fun to see all the quirky details kind of scattered throughout.   This place has a pretty sizeable parking lot in the back so parking shouldn t be an issue. They do have an outdoor patio that can seat a fair amount of people and I like that it s tucked away towards the back of the restaurant so you re not facing the street.   The menu is pretty simple and they have a variety of options including sliders and plates. Since it s a taco place  I opted to try their tacos for my first visit.   I ordered the  Paco s Pick  3 5  this was only okay. Nothing special or unique. Flavor wasn t bad  but the steak wasn t as tender as I would have liked.  The Gringo  5 5  I really liked this taco  Everything in this taco seemed to complement each other perfectly.   Overall I d give this place 3.5 5 stars. I think the amount of protein they pack in the tacos is generous however I do think the tacos are a tad expensive ranging around  4  per taco  especially since the ingredients are pretty standard.   Summary  unique place to eat  tacos are a good size and pretty filling  lookout for all the cool quirky decor 
Paco's Tacos,129,The tacos were good.  Very casual and Austin funky but fun. I didn t realize it was a self-serve place until I was inside.
Paco's Tacos,130,Stopped in for breakfast.  Great atmosphere.  In and outside seating.  I opted for in because it s Texas and I don t like to sweat while I m eating.  I loved the eclectic and rustic decor.  I love old houses turned into restaurants.  The staff was nice and helpful.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich.  It was hardy and messy  the best combo.  The bread was great.  Like a ciabatta bread and held its own.  The potatoes were nice but a bit bland.  I put one of the great salsas on them and everything was right with the world.  Definitely looking to coming back for one of the daily specials.
Paco's Tacos,131,My first stop for food in Texas  Got two tacos one with ground beef mixed with potatoes and carrots and the other with a pulled pork. Blew me away   Food was amazing and tasted fresh. They have a bunch of sauces to choose from as well. Will definitely be back here   
Paco's Tacos,132,Fantastic tacos and great location.  Go for the breakfast specials esp the chilequiles 
Paco's Tacos,133,Queso was pretty boring  I think it was straight velveeta-analog.  Salsas were ok but the lack of a dona taste-a-like was a bummer.  Tacos were large and contained ample filling but the filling just wasn t that flavorful. Everything was sort of bland.  Overall  I probably won t go back since Torchy s opened across the street.
Paco's Tacos,134,I love Austin.. I love the food. One day BBQ  the next day Mexican.. throw a burger day in the middle of the vacation and for dessert go for a taco somewhere.   Some of the local 2 star reviewers are rude but that s expected with almost 500 reviewers. What s the saying  Everyone has one  some people have two    First off I admire business owners that work their business and the hours they have   Paco s from 6 30am to 9pm is to be commended. Secondly  the build your own bowl  from the base of the perfect rice with my add ons made someone question why you guys even have chain Mexican restaurants in Texas  Chipotle WHAT    I think ya ll have some amazing places that ARE quirky and in a  weird atmosphere . To me  this is a positive and not something that would ever detract me or anyone else from going... The food with a twist is what people want and to bash a place because someone does it different than your Mexican house guest used to do.. then.. go to Chipotle cause for me Paco s will be my Gringos go to because I love good Mexican food.
Paco's Tacos,135,So for being my first review I must say Paco s Tacos is my favorite neighborhood spot. Since I ve moved to the neighborhood this place is a close walk from my apartment so for the convenience factor it rocks. Secondly the atmosphere of the patio is very comfortable. The food is great tex Mex very affordable and to top it off the staff is awesome. I would work there. Lately they ve been  calling me by name. The cherry on top so it s very kid friendly my son enjoys playing with all the trucks outside and occasionally seeing the little black bunny two lives amongst succulents. Also they re opening up a beer garden soon super stoked for.
Paco's Tacos,136,I love Paco s Tacos  I paid  5 for two build your own tacos. The portions are huge  and I was full after eating two packed breakfast tacos. The tacos were well seasoned. The egg and bacon breakfast taco was my favorite. Avocado costs extra.
Paco's Tacos,137,Ok so...I m a huge Torchy s fan and also love Taco Deli.  Paco s completes the trifecta.  You can get your taco any way you want it in a super straightforward manner.  If you don t like it then...pick different stuff next time. It s basically the taco you d make at home but they have every taco ingredient.  But...what pushed it over the edge was Kit  the woman working the counter.  I asked her a couple questions and the vague sense I got is that she liked working there. I scanned the room and it s a generally chill  warm  low drama atmosphere.  Taco Deli is snooty by comparison.
Paco's Tacos,138,In the war between Torchy s and Tacodeli  the winner might be Paco s.  Tucked away on the border between the Truman Show Townhouses of Mueller and the decidedly un-planned Windsor Park  you ll find as Austin a decor as there is anywhere else in our fair city  right up there with Threadgill s  Spiderhouse and that-place-I-didn t-mention-but-is-your-favorite-how-could-I.  Inside  an extremely chill staff exude the sort of laid-back cool you only find in hangin  out sitcoms while you peruse a truly awesome taco menu.  I m serious  this menu is baller  scallop tacos  brisket tacos  breakfast build-your-owns  barbacoa... They even do silders  burritos and chilaquiles.  The prices are right in line with the fusion taco establishments in the area. Their tortillas  a rock-solid corn flour hybrid. Their salsas...  Tangy tomatillo  consistent red  killer creamy poblano  hot as hell habanero  weird-as-hell honey habanero and the crown jewel... spicy  savory  incredible chile de arbol  take several to-gos home.  Of all the things I ve had here  I ve really loved Paco s Pick  steak dinner in a taco   the Hatch w  Chicken  peppers  fajita chicken  praise taco Jesus   the barbacoa  legit  and the absurdly massive Paco s Big Man  a Don Juan for the  slightly  more refined palette. Over-easy eggs belong in a taco. Paco s understands this and they understand me.  The outside patio is wonderful  you get all of the sunsets and none of 51 nearby.   If I could have one change  make the for-here tacos served un-foiled. Let those beautiful ingredients pop in Instagram Yelp photos  As of now  it looks way worse than it taste.  Go try it  and see where it stacks among the other big T s.
Paco's Tacos,139,man   you want to give them a five star rating...but just can t.  cool looking place  casual  signs and rusty stuff everywhere. Kids playing outside  friendly staff. The food though...I give it a good-very good.   the Hook-em  taco  advertised as  brisket  coleslaw  bbq sauce and cilantro was a nice taco...but the beef was more  sliced beef  than brisket. Tasty...absolutely   the Gringo had a nice amount of shrimp but were a little rubbery. Not too much mango  which can overpower a dish  but could use a little more avocado. Tasty.  Still  the cute-factor has me wishing I could give it that fifth star...  I encourage you to drop by and try them. A nice dining experience.
Paco's Tacos,140,Solid tacos. Quite large in size. They use styrofoams cups which annoys me  so I don t get coffee there.
Paco's Tacos,141,Tacos were not flavorful enough and took way too long to come out on a busy Saturday morning. They also need to figure out a more efficient system for bringing out food through their various indoor outdoor spaces. The current system of wandering about and yelling names does not work with their layout. The ambience is wonderful though  lots of cool art and a backyard feel in the fenced-in patio.   Parking is minimal but the staff was great at helping us finagle a spot that had just opened up.
Paco's Tacos,142,Found a hidden gem. Decided to stop in on way home from ikea. Place looks sketchy from the drive on 51st. Parked behind restaurant and walked up ramp. Kind of a nostalgic feel. Menu was set up reader friendly. But the food  The food was amazing. I ordered the packs bandito plate w chips n queso. Also ordered the pacos pick taco. Gf ordered the beef fajita quesadilla. Each were amazing. Definitely will be a regular stop for us.
Paco's Tacos,143,Always do carry out  but I love these tacos  Great for when you care way more about the flavor and quality than being in a trendy location. I m a big time meat eater  but the vegetarian tacos are really good also 
Paco's Tacos,144,A  20 deliver fee for driving down 35 and getting of on 32nd     Two miles     Lazy lazy lazy  You just lost a customer.
Paco's Tacos,145,Loved the out door seating. Very comfortable atmosphere and casual. Tacos were great. Staff was equally as friendly and helpful with recommendations. Would definitely recommend. Prices were also good.
Paco's Tacos,146,Love this hidden gem. The outside is so cute they have a separate bar area now. Breakfast tacos are soooo good and affordable. I will definitely be coming back.
Paco's Tacos,147,You don t need me to tell you that Austin is a mecca of tacos  and my residence of two years Dallas can make a strong showing as well. Even with those two things in mind  Paco s Tacos is a place you should absolutely visit.   Star 1  How were the service and atmosphere   As others have stated  the service at Paco s Tacos is frankly unlike anything I d previously experienced in Austin. The staff were absolutely marvelous  and helped me navigate what was an overwhelming yet absolutely brilliant menu. The location itself is trendy and distinctly Austin  and I absolutely loved it. Star Granted.   Star 2  How were the portions relative to the cost   With as vast as PT s menu is  the prices vary widely between  2.50 and  4.50 for tacos that are of decent size. No pictures  but let it be known that this was reasonable. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4  How was the food   With fresh tortillas and solid tacos  Paco s Tacos had already proven itself to me  but it was the peripherals that really left a lasting impression. First and foremost  the queso was right on par with Torchey s  which I openly consider the best in the state. From there  there was a fantastic salsa bar with a honey habanero sauce that I could honestly put on every single meal for the rest of my life. So fantastically good. Dual Star Granted.   Star 5  Would you eat here every day if you could   Paco s Tacos absolutely crushes it in the best of ways  and it s only the fierce competition in Austin and in Texas that prevents it from scoring a perfect five stars. I ll be back  and you should be here. No Star Granted.
Paco's Tacos,148,Prices low but you get what you pay for. Quality of product transfers over to being priced low. If you want something cheap this place will suit you. Staff upfront seemed to love talking about the edibles they like taking. Be careful when it rains because the ramp entrance gets slippery.
Paco's Tacos,149,Never EVER a bad experience here  I m so happy to support businesses like this with great food  drinks  and service. The staff is always incredibly friendly and efficient and they keep their tables CLEAN. I also love the mis-matched collection of quirky coffee cups. Everything is priced fairly and it really is delicious.
Paco's Tacos,150,I finally got breakfast tacos at Paco s Tacos on my way to work this morning. Amazing  One with eggs  cheese and mushrooms and the other with whole black beans instead of the mushrooms. The eggs are cooked to order and served omelet style  not scrambled and the tacos are loaded. The flavors were as good as any I ve had.  I encourage all of you taco lovers to give Paco s a try....lots more choices than mine and I m sure you ll be glad to try this funky place.
Paco's Tacos,151,Here in Tucson  breakfast burritos are the thing  but back in Austin where my sister lives  it s all about the breakfast tacos. You can find them everywhere  from my hotel s espresso bar to convenience stores  to... well  anywhere.   On my first morning here - after a short night of sleep for myself  and no sleep for my nightshift working sister  we dipped into this place  as they were open at 6 30am on a Sunday. We ordered a half dozen breakfast tacos  two for my niece as well   to go and waited.   I really love the charm of this little shack. Lots of funky stuff nailed to the walls  a nice bit of outside seating  and a few rooms of seating indoors.  Every coffee mug in the place was different than the next  and pretty much everything in the joint looked  found .  We waited very briefly for our tacos  then took them back to my sister s apartment to dig in. The tortillas were fresh and fluffy  and Paco s didn t skimp on the bacon or eggs that filled the inside. They had about a dozen different sauces - we tried a number of them  and each accentuated the tacos  without overpowering them. Definitely a good way to start or end the day.
Paco's Tacos,152,Pretty tasty breakfast tacos with a great selection of salsas  Try the honey habanero salsa for a punch in the face  tasty  but   Pretty good coffee. Cute outdoor seating area and decor.
Paco's Tacos,153,What can I say about Paco s Tacos except that no one can go wrong with a mountain of nachos in front of them. The down side is the place has limited parking and seating gets a little cramped  but it wouldn t be so crowded if it wasn t good food. The brownies are also giant and extremely chocolatey.
Paco's Tacos,154,Called in Paco s Tacos. Women on the phone says   we ll have it ready.  Get dressed  drive  and find parking . Go inside and ask if  pick up is on this side  she says   yes  and rings me up... Then sends me outside to the bar to pick up my food. When I get outside it s pretty obvious they haven t started making my food. Sit there for 25 minutes. Tell them I m leaving and that I need a refund  they offer me 2 of my 4 breakfast tacos and I decline. Missed kick off of the Cowboys game. Should have just hit Taco Mex  never again.    
Paco's Tacos,155,This is a great example of a family owned local Austin business. The decor is really cool  service is always fast. The food is different from many other taco places which is nice to see some creativity in the menu. I really like the big man if you have a big appetite 
Paco's Tacos,156,I was craving a Bloody Mary and my fianc  found this wonderful place on Yelp  It s a quaint restaurant that very much gives off the vibe that this is  the place to chill.  We ordered a breakfast sandwich  the nachos and the carnitas taco. Along with our Bloody Mary  amp  Blueberry Mimosas  They were  2  so they were as great as you d except but still very respectable for  2. They got it PERFECTLY spicy. I was very pleased with their food  service and overall atmosphere.
Paco's Tacos,157,This is the first place in Austin I have given 5 stars. It s the best breakfast taco place I ve been to in Austin. Taco shack  Torchies and Taco Deli are good  but there is only one Paco s Tacos and it is between two houses on 51st street. It s sort of a hidden treasure  but it does get packed on the weekends. I took my family here when they came to visit and they loved it    Breakfast tacos cheap and delicious.  The Hook m   BBQ brisket cold slaw taco is enough to make you wanna stand up and beg for buttermilk.  An if you wanna get down  grab a beer with your tacos and go home and tell your mom you love her--guarantied  bro she will send you  love.
Paco's Tacos,158,Awesome tacos  friendly service  love the giant cooler out front with sodas and beers 
Paco's Tacos,159,My husband and I stopped by Paco s today with our 1 1 2 year old on our way home from the Thinkery. Y all. This place is seriously awesome. It was raining today but the patio was really amazing and I can t wait to come back and hang outside in the spring  Plus  they had dump trucks to play with  Parents will get my enthusiasm. Toys at a restaurant   one more bloody mary for mom and dad    The inside is really cozy and unique. I love places where you see something new and interesting every way you look...and this place is exactly that. They have suckers for the kids  this bought us some extra time   and beer on ice by the door.   The menu is great with sooo much variety. We had breakfast tacos  ham  egg  potato  cheese was my fav   and a Gringo and Carnitas. My husband is still talking about the carnitas 8 hours later. The queso was super tasty and HOLY MOLY  that brownie hit the spot just now for a late night snack. These are the tacos you crave. We are Torchy s regulars but these topped it. I m not even kidding.   But the best part of this place was the service. The guy that took our order  dang  I wish I remembered his name   was absolutely hilarious and so helpful and cool and I chatted with another guy while waiting for our food  owner I think   who reminded me of an old friend. Then  you toss a free brownie in as a thank you for coming in  Wow. I didn t even want to leave    Yeah. This is how you do it people. Awesome atmosphere  really good food  and nice people who seem genuinely happy and thankful to have you as a customer. We ll be making the drive from South Austin as often as possible. Thanks y all 
Paco's Tacos,160,I ll be back.    I ordered the special-  fish taco plate.  It was my first time so I wasn t sure what to expect.   The fish was fine but it had lots of rice in the taco which I could have done without. Love the decor   lots of parking but barely ten tables inside- if that.   Friendly staff.
Paco's Tacos,161,It s just crazy that I haven t written a review for Paco s  I remember when they opened. It was so great to be able to have tacos and chips  amp  queso DELIVERED when I lived in the  23. This was long enough ago that we didn t get much delivered in the  23. Anyways  I ve since moved away to Columbia  SC and when we were discussing where we needed to get breakfast taco s  Paco s made our short list. The tortillas are yummy and the selection of salsas will meet anyone s flavor needs. I like things spicy  so it was so nice to be back in Texas. We met a friend there and it was also a  nice place to hang out and drink coffee and catch up. The decor is also stimulating - I like seeing found-art and memorabilia. I particularly enjoyed looking at the map with all of the places Paco has been.  I MISS BREAKFAST TACOS. I ve left the land of tacos and the memory of those glory days when they were delivered hot to my door  well  it just makes me tear up a little. We ll be back  Thank you  Paco s for the yummy tacos 
Paco's Tacos,162,We were staying at the Residence Inn across the street and had a dog with us  so we thought the outdoor patio at Paco s Tacos would be a good choice. We re very glad that we made that choice.  First off  the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They explained items on the menu  and helped carry our food and drinks out to the patio  you order at the counter  and they bring the food out to you .  The tacos are small  but delicious. We had a few different ones  but I loved the brisket  with cole slaw  the best. We also had an order of guacamole and an order of queso. The orders were good sized with plenty of chips - more than enough for four of us.   Overall  this is certainly not the fanciest place  but we re glad we went  and will certainly be back during our next visit to Austin.
Paco's Tacos,163,Always great food and service is on point  A perfect little Austin gem right in Mueller. Locally owned and run which is always a plus. Make sure to give these guys a try
Paco's Tacos,164,I ve been going here for 2 years and don t plan on stopping.  It s family owned  it s good  it s almost cute but who cares and the ooo yeah... did I mention   ITS SO STINKING GOOD.
Paco's Tacos,165,Staff isn t wearing masks so if that is a concern to you  I d go elsewhere. I know I will be. If I hadn t pre-ordered  I would have walked out. Food was as good as always but at this time  that is not enough.
Paco's Tacos,166,Good but not excellent. I wish they had homemade corn tortillas. My friend got the big man and liked it a lot. I got breakfast tacos on corn which were good. Liked the mild chorizo a lot. Good enough for what it is.
Paco's Tacos,167,Outdoor patio  blueberry mimosas  and migas quesadillas  Yes please  First time  and we ll be back  Great service and the food was fresh and delicious.
Paco's Tacos,168,Two great vegan options to mention right away  The FTB tempeh taco  which is super fresh and tangy  and The Hatch  just remove the cheese. Filled to the brim with hatch chile.  Great atmosphere  good food. Recommend entirely.
Paco's Tacos,169,Great food and atmosphere  One of my favorite taco spots in Austin. I had the Portobello  hook em   amp  Barbacoa. The Portobello was by favorite and everything tasted fresh. I will be back to try the rest of the menu....did I mention Breakfast all day 
Paco's Tacos,170,Excellent - will be on my list of finishers when I go to rank the absolute best breakfast tacos in town.  They don t skimp on the portions and you can tell it s freshly cooked ingredients.  Good home style food.  Bonus the  Honey Habanero  and the  Arbol  salsas are both spicy and excellent.
Paco's Tacos,171,Exceptional service  food  and employees  I came in with high expectations as I ve heard many great things and I instantly understood why. The cashier was quick to make sure I was served  and got the relatively large order completely right. This is the kind of place where the setting alone makes you want to come back as soon as possible. The food was top tier- I was not at all disappointed with taste or the quality of the ingredients. I would absolutely recommend Paco s to anyone looking for a good time meal. I will most certainly be returning 
Paco's Tacos,172,YES YES YES  The carnitas are some of the best I have ever had   The rice bowl with carnitas is THE BOMB.  The rice is buttery  amp  fluffy and would be delicious just on its own  but you can add a variety of accoutrements for the very reasonable price of 0.35 per add-on. I chose the carnitas rice bowl and added black beans  onion  avocado and sour cream. IT WAS AWESOME. On weekends  Bloody Marys and Mimosas are ONLY  2    The Bloody Mary s are pretty darn good for that price  On a nice day  opt to sit outside. The atmosphere is more Texas than Austin  amp  welcomes you with that old west feeling. There is plenty of kitch to view  amp  ponder while enjoying your meal. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PACOS 
Paco's Tacos,173,I had drove by this place for 2 years before finally trying it out. Now I m kicking myself wondering what took so long 
Paco's Tacos,174,Oh god  I love this place. I ve been trying to remember what the name of the place is so I could tell people about it but I never can seem to remember. I need to go more often.
Paco's Tacos,175,This place could probably pass off its shabby run-down  rustic appearance as charming  hip and cool if the food was really good. But alas  This place is just a dive with no redeeming factors that I could see or taste. Service is friendly and efficient
Paco's Tacos,176,I got take out breakfast tacos which were supposed to be egg  bacon  and potato.  They forgot the egg.  There were 7 people working and they fucked up 2 breakfast tacos.  How do you forget one of three ingredients ordered 
Paco's Tacos,177,I only got to eat here once last time I was in Austin  but next time I m down there  I will absolutely be eating here every day.  Food was great  menu was huge  employees were friendly. The parking lot was pretty small  I went during off peak times  so the lot was pretty empty  but I can see it being difficult to park during lunch or dinner rush.
Paco's Tacos,178,This place is an excellent example of what makes Austin such a foodie city. It has great decor  friendly people  a HUGE selection of Mexican and Tex-Mex  which lets everyone find something that they ll love and at a reasonable price  lots of different drinks to choose from  excellent specials and most importantly  fresh  delicious  flavorful food.  I came in the early afternoon  around 1 00PM and enjoyed a few beers and a breakfast taco that consisted of eggs  cheese  spinach  mushrooms and a sauce  a tostada with fresh smashed avocado and black been and some of the most delicious queso and chips I ve ever had. I enjoyed all of my food so much and I left STUFFED    I am really satisfied with Paco s. It s a definite must go for tourists and should certainly be in rotation for locals.
Paco's Tacos,179,I m from California  where breakfast tacos aren t too big of a thing from what I ve experienced. This is unfortunate because boy howdy are they yummy. I have buddies who swear by this place  so this was a must-visit for me.  After flying into Austin on a Sunday afternoon and checking into my hotel  I hungrily hobbled over to this here eatery. The kind gentleman at the counter recommended the Paco s Pick  while also offering a disclaimer that it s hard to go wrong with any of the choices. I picked the Pick  then inquired about the breakfast tacos. I got mine with egg  chorizo  avocado  and mushrooms. Perhaps this is a California thing  but I was a little surprised at how cheap the price came out to be. I also expected the tacos to be kind of small so I was further surprised when two reasonably big tacos were delivered to my table.  The Pick was fine. Maybe the fillings were not 100  my thing  so it s hard for me to recommend it without reservation. The breakfast taco  on the other hand  was next-level delicious. I m still thinking about it days later. The chorizo had good flavor  the eggs were cooked just right  and  of course  avocado makes everything better. I threw some spicy green salsa on top and they made everything resonate more.  I left Paco s a happy man  which was difficult at the time because the San Francisco Giants disappointed me with their baseball-playing abilities. To reiterate  Paco s Tacos made me forget about bad baseball. If that s not a ringing endorsement  I don t know what is.  I ate inside  but the outside seating area looks like a pretty fun area to hang out in. Check out the pictures and you ll see what I mean. I ll definitely be coming back before returning to California 
Paco's Tacos,180,Other reviews are spot on and I will not add another photo.  Only in Austin or the west bju would you find veggie chorizo.5ueqbb Not corn tortilla but corn    blend. Coffee is very good  the chorizo is great and they don t mess around on salsa it ranges from parlando to habenaro   HOT . has local delivery and catering.
Paco's Tacos,181,A New Fave  I recently discovered Paco s after a coworker brought in breakfast tacos to share  and they were so good  I ve gone in for lunch twice since then  and I have to say  Paco s has excellent food and excellent service  I ordered online and picked up lunch today  and the beans had kind of spilled out of the side of the to-go container. I hadn t even noticed  and probably wouldn t have  but the woman who rang me up offered to re-package it since it was a bit messy. I thought that was super awesome  and I love that she even cared enough to notice fix it.
Paco's Tacos,182,Living in Mueller  Paco s Tacos is our default for breakfast tacos  which are offered all day long   YES we drive past Torchy s for Paco s   I love their mixed tortilla  flour and corn like HEB s Mixla tortillas  but they do have the option for just flour or just corn also.  If you live in Mueller I would absolutely suggest taking to opportunity for a bit of exercise and walking as the parking is a challenge  they have a small lot that can be difficult to get in and out of when it is full  which is often especially on weekends  and there is no street parking.  My office rotates who chooses and brings a catered breakfast once a week  and Paco s ia so good that the last time it was my turn I choose to bring Paco s Tacos.  Everyone in my office  55  hard to please people with all sorts of dietary restrictions  were very happy with their tacos.  Taste is never a problem  The ONLY reason that Paco s didn t get a 5 star review from me was because when I placed my order a day in advance of all 3 item taco s I was quoted one amount  and when I came to pick it up I was charged a different slightly higher amount  and because the person I placed the order with wasn t there they couldn t fix it.
Paco's Tacos,183,I wish I could add a sixth star.   My boyfriend and I live downtown and discovered this place on a whim on our way to the drive-in theatre. I ve been back a million times. Its a borderline addiction.  The eclectic style is what originally caught my eye  but its the fantastically delicious food and even more fantastic staff that keeps us coming back. Mike has always been so generous and helpful when we re looking to try something new. He recommend we have the cooks pour the habenero sauce on the tacos while they re cooking for an extra kick.  Though we can t speak for the breakfast  sliders or rice bowls  the tacos are to die for. I haven t had one I ve been dissatisfied with.  If you ve got out of towners  TAKE them to Pacos 
Paco's Tacos,184,Been here 3 times and each time the service was SO slow and often incomplete orders.   One time when I was greeted at the counter  one of the staff said  no aqui  repeatedly before another girl asked if I wanted  for here or to go .   I did want  for here . Felt weird.   I ve given them 3 chances in the span of 2 years and nothing has changed.
Paco's Tacos,185,Amazing. All of their tacos are incredible and they have a salsa bar  which is a huge plus . Their queso is also excellent. They have a lot of seating inside and outside and their patio is great.
Paco's Tacos,186,We love this place  the owners really have a passion to serve our community delicious tacos.  It s a must to stop by if you haven t yet.
Paco's Tacos,187,Good lawd the tacos are friggin good. I got the shrimp and pulled pork tacos. Tacos were stuffed and I felt stuffed after two tacos . Very colorful  distressed wood everywhere with rusted aluminum design.  I ll be back when I m in the neighborhood.
Paco's Tacos,188,Terrific menu selections  relaxing outdoor seating  hot food  yummy flavors  cheap mimosas  extended hours everyday  cozy vibe  customizable anything...just another wonderfully hidden gem in Austin
Paco's Tacos,189,Mmm  Paco s. So most of my Paco s visits have been post-run  which I ll admit has me seeing them through sweaty  rose-colored glasses. The runger is real  amirite fellow runners   Anyway  the tacos are cheap and yummy - two item tacos are  1.85. The salsa selection is pretty legit. Last time I went they had  2 blueberry mimosas on special - yes please    The interior seating area isn t super huge  but there s a pretty large outdoor area  which is dog-friendly.   Minus one star for the parking situation. Their lot is pretty small and fills up quickly on the weekends.
Paco's Tacos,190,I like Paco s. They have a variety of Taco styles and ingredients  and delicious bloody mary s on the weekends.   The other day it was super nice outside and I was grabbing some tacos to go. I wish I could ve sat outside on their awesome patio. It looked like a great place to chill.
Paco's Tacos,191,Excellent tacos and vibe and service at this indoor outdoor casual counter service place. I had the fish taco and couldn t recommend it more. I also had the picadillo - ground beef - taco which was really good. The Bloody Mary was large and strong and only  2. The prices were good and I wish I ha room to try the beef patty. The parking lot gets crowded fast.
Paco's Tacos,192,Chilaquiles fans this is a solid spot. The secret to the dish is maintaining the crispness of the tortilla chips while also incorporating them into the rest of the ingredients . It s easy to over do it and get soggy chips. The kitchen staff here knows what they re doing. Great execution. Props to the staff and line.
Paco's Tacos,193,Don t get the chile reyeno.  It was floating in grease.  I use napkins til blue in the face and it was still greasy.  The friend on breading was like liquid.  I expressed concern and they took the compliant  but didn t really do anything about it.  My friend tasted it and he liked it  but he wasn t into like I was as my main dish.  There was grease hanging around my mouth after every bite.  Disappointed this time.  The Mexican Coke was good.
Paco's Tacos,194,I don t really write Yelp reviews anymore since working in a restaurant  after noticing how ridiculous a lot of reviews can be. But I couldn t help but write one for Paco s.  This is THE place for tacos near the Hyde Park area. The service is on point  the flavor is on point  and the salsas are on point. Every breakfast I ve ever had here  take-out or dine-in  has been exceptional. The service staff is perfectly friendly. I haven t found a place that is consistently enjoyable in Austin for quite a while now.   So  please  get in there as soon as you can. Get any breakfast dish or taco and let your mouth thank you.  Also  ambience is quite kitschy and it seems to be family run. There are specials every day so take advantage of those. Enjoy 
Paco's Tacos,195,Great tacos but a long wait. We ll be sure to call in our order next time.
Paco's Tacos,196,Paco s Tacos is a cool  tiny little place  where the food is decent.  I ordered the Migas   and wifey ordered the chorizo and eggs.  In the words of my father in law    somewhere  someone is saying   now why don t they write   The food is ok needed salt  and I m not one for adding salt to anything. It was just missing something. The atmosphere was cool though. Lots of colorful paint everywhere. You can also sit outside and enjoy the air on a nice day.  Good homemade salsa hot sauce selection. The crew were all very nice  Will probably come back and try other menu items  might gave just caught them on a bad day.
Paco's Tacos,197,I really liked this place. We went on a Sunday around lunch and got in right before it got too crowded. Lot s of outdoor seating and fun  funky  tex mex decor  lots of menu options  including rice bowls  which I ordered with half rice  extra lettuce  for a  healthier  option.  Fun sauces come with the chips  friendly service  very quick  and priced well. Will return to this place soon 
Paco's Tacos,198,Damn. Every single time Husband and I venture out of our usual places  we find a gem. And then I m obligated to share. Luckily  almost every place we discover is a 4-star delight  and Paco s Tacos on 51st is NO different. Damn.  Run by a tight-knit family who value their customers  every offering on the menu is sure to satisfy. Their migas are some of the best I ve had in central Texas  west Texas seems to have the best . They have cold beer and on the weekend you can get a bloody or a mimosa with your plate. Great atmosphere  friendly people  delicious tacos and plates...Paco s is  the  spot for Saturday morning recouping.
Paco's Tacos,199,1st time.  Great old school patio and bar.  Real good food.  Will be returning  soon.
Paco's Tacos,200,We went here with an ATX friend who swore this place is amazing.  The kindness and friendliness of the staff was great.  The margaritas were flavorful and fun.  The carne guisada is really good.  The beans were well made.  The rice reminded me of health conscious Austin and white with some flavor.  The only reason for the 4 stars vs 5 stars is the flour tortillas. Comparable to most Austin restaurants as they are pretty plain but probably healthier than Manteca flavorfulness.  The atmosphere is nice. It feels good here. Lots of good vibes. The parking lot - i love the way they have it with the tin and boards. Good use of materials.  Shout out to the most amazing brownies I ve tasted now since New York. Very chocolatey. A must have. The chocolate chip cookie is good too but if you love chocolate go for the brownie. I hope everyone has as nice an experience as we did here.  I would go back here again with our friend. It was good.
Paco's Tacos,201,The wife and I love eating here. It s always a treat  The traffic can be pretty hectic so it s nice to get off the high way and get some great breakfast lunch here.   Amazing staff  great food  awesome decor 
Paco's Tacos,202,The Bacon Gordita was filling and fun to eat.  The thick corn shell was unique but made for nearly as easy eating as a breakfast taco.  Speaking of breakfast tacos  they serve theirs on a unique corn-flour blend which is super tasty.  Tiny parking lot available in the back  dog friendly patio that seems as large as the inside eating space.  To-go is also available   I need to try more of the menu.
Paco's Tacos,203,Yall... this place is so cute    The friendliest person you can imagine greeted us when we walked in and recommended some awesome options.  I have a cilantro sensitivity and I told him that and he recommended exactly what to get that didn t have cilantro and it was delicious  Very well priced compared to some taco shops in Austin. They also have enchiladas and plates. I highly recommend  
Paco's Tacos,204,Awesome place. Great food. And a new cantina with great drink prices. We will definitely visit again.
Paco's Tacos,205,Paco s was a pleasant surprise.  They have a solid patio and a nice selection of salsas.  The barbacoa tacos were really good.  The Paco s pick is pretty good.  I liked the Cece s Pescado taco although next time I would get it without rice so that more of the fish would come through.  Tortillas are a corn flour blend and provided a more unique flavor than your general flour tortilla.  The salsas are the star of the show here though.  I enjoyed the Mango Pico and their basic Red salsa the most.  Good heat and good overall flavor.  Wasn t a big fan of the Honey Habanero but that is more of personal preference than a flavor issue.  I will return at some point to try the breakfast menu 
Paco's Tacos,206,Great breakfast.  I ate here two days in a row. I had a couple of make your own tacos yesterday  bacon  egg  bean and chorizo  egg  bean . I had The Migas plate today.   It Is worth a trip here for a good breakfast.
Paco's Tacos,207,One of my favorite taco spots in Austin. Paco s pick is amazing. Really cool atmosphere as well.
Paco's Tacos,208,I completely forgot that I wrote a review for this place before  but have been meaning to log on and write one because of the great customer service I always receive. Funny to find that I wrote one years ago    Last time I went they brought my dog a bowl of water and dog treats  Also  as I said in my last review  the salsa is amazing- love the creamy green one.
Paco's Tacos,209,The tacos and the service are both great  It s a smaller place  but the decorations are cool--great spot for breakfast 
Paco's Tacos,210,I m a little ashamed that  despite living close by for a long long time  I have only recently discovered this place.  Everything that I ve ordered thus far has met or exceeded my expectations  and the tacos are just plain good.  Nothing too fancy or innovative  but that s not the point.  Just quality tacos that we Texans can t live without   The prices are good for the serving size and I ve always left satisfied.  I ve always been a big Torchy s fan  and for some things  I still really am   but the Torchy s nearby has gotten slower and slower and the last few times I ve left disappointed.  So Paco s has become my go-to  especially for breakfast tacos.  Keep up the good work  Paco s 
Paco's Tacos,211,Paco s Tacos delivered to Red Roof Inn plunked on highway 35 during SXSW. A number of places wouldn t deliver because of the festival  and the rest were national chains or had unappetizing menus.   Paco  I heart your tacos  My friend and I shared a spinach and mushroom quesadilla. There was nothing spectacular about it  in the sense that I could make the same thing  but it was tasty with a good crisp considering it traveled in a steamy container.   Next I shelled the El Flaco from its foil cocoon. More spinach and mushroom  this time with tender onions  tomatoes  egg  and cheese. Again  pretty basic but competently prepared and assembled.   I ended up saving the Gringo  a taco with shrimp  chipotle mayo  cabbage  avocado  and  mango pico.  It became breakfast the next morning  and I ate that sucker cold. It was fantastic. I was excited the instant I had read  mango pico  and  chipotle mayo  and  oh man  that taco was a thing of simple  flavorful joy. I also absolutely loved 3 of the 5 sauces. The pale green one was an awesome accent to the Gringo 
Paco's Tacos,212,This place is great little taco spot. The regulars will tell you that the chiliquiles are the best dish they offer.  Breakfast is serves anytime but they have lunch and dinner too.
Paco's Tacos,213,I m a big fan of the mushroom and spinach rice bowl topped with the creamy salsa. I also love the sliders  But honestly  I ve never had anything I didn t love. Also  everyone who works there is super nice. You can dine inside  although there is limited seating  or they ve got a lovely patio where you can hang out. They just expanded their parking  which is helpful because we go there a lot.   
Paco's Tacos,214,Ordered the  gorditas  not what I expected  basically a two thick corn tortillas with flavorless chicken  beans and cheese. The gorditas at el chilito are much better and fit the definition of a gordita.  Don t think I ll be returning.
Paco's Tacos,215,Walked in and waited to place my order...was no greeting when I ordered. I ask for chikaquiles with refried beans to go. Cashier asked me twice if it was for here. Took my food and left. No thank you for coming. When I got to work to have my breakfast...all was good EXCEPT the Beans...THE BEANS WERE. BURNT. yes they were refried...but they were BURNT during inital cooking....then blended and refried.. thus locking in the BURNT SMOKED taste.  Very POOR judgement on behalf of the person who made them...I called and asked to speak to a manager and spoke to a lady. I shared my facts about the burnt beans and she said she was walking back to taste them. She said they tasted fine  and that I could have been served from another batch.   from when   I take my beans seriously and offered to take mine in for tasting...she said ok. No apology.  Lots of room for Improvement    
Paco's Tacos,216,Had some epic service in here this morning from a sweet lady with dark hair. She was so welcoming and hospitable  it made me smile. The equally friendly man handing out menus made us feel right at home  it was our first time . We ordered the migas  carnitas  sausage egg and cheese  and bacon egg and cheese. Everything was fantastic except the migas. I wasn t obsessed with any of the salsas but I thought all were tasty. One really left a mark on your mouth  which I love   Def a good  family vibe if you re in the area. Also... there was a huge bunny in the back. Did someone bring that or does it live there 
Paco's Tacos,217,This place is great for everyone. Vegan  vegetarian  and carnivore friendly it also has many drink options from iced teas and sodas to frozen margaritas and canned beers. The actual place itself is entertaining  as well as adorable  and clean I m so happy that it s dog friendly and appears to be kid friendly too. But if you are here alone that s okay too. Everyone here is nice and also very polite. I couldn t be more pleased that I stumbled upon this place entirely by accident.
Paco's Tacos,218,paco knows his tacos. i ve been three times now and can t wait for my next visit  if you ve not been yet  make the trip. they re conveniently located over by the old mueller airport and from anywhere  it is worth it. food is super fresh  service is outstanding  and the whole vibe is just cool. cozy interior and nice patio.  tacos are in the  3- 5 range. I m a fan of the gringo  the hatch  and cece s pescado - and have tasted many of the others and have loved them all. paco s offers 5 different salsas made in house  to suit every taste and mood - from mild to blow your socks off spicy.   they ve got wine and beer  plus the usual fountain drinks  coffee  tea and  of course  jarritos.  one of these days i am going to make it there for breakfast. that will be a happy day. sh t  just writing this review is making me want to go right now and sit out on the patio for a bit. come meet me 
Paco's Tacos,219,Tyson s certainly gets all the love in the area but Paco s is perfect too. The outdoor seating and hidden vibe is ideal. The food is great  staff is positive  definitely worth checking out.
Paco's Tacos,220,It took over an hour to get our food remind you I only order 3 tacos by the time I got them I was already feed up with waiting but that was not the only thing when the food arrived it was cold it was flavorless. I do have to give them the atmosphere was really cute but the food was disgusting and cold not Good at all.  will not be returning.
Paco's Tacos,221,Aside from the parking lot  negative one thousand stars   I love Paco s and look forward to many return visits. This place is like the love child crack baby of Torchy s and Taqueria Arandinas. Just a touch of gringo  but with authentic genes.   The menu is vast -- breakfast and non-breakfast options alike meaning SURELY there s something for everyone.  And the best part--it s all really good. The tacos  the tortas  the migas  they bring all the boys to the yard   and all the rest.  Everything is also quite fresh and way less greasy fatty than most other Tex-Mex you find in Austin.   They have fun outdoor seating for the warm days  a friendly staff  great homemade salsa  and a really fun vibe.
Paco's Tacos,222,Yay for this place   We love the tacos and come back to occasionally try something new and tasty.  I think I love this place partly because it rhymes  Paco s Tacos .  How can you go wrong 
Paco's Tacos,223,Paco s is a family owned restaurant with great breakfast tacos and even better service.  The parking is a bit of a challenge  but I ve never NOT been able to find parking here. You can t go wrong with any of the breakfast tacos  but they also have enchiladas  migas  sliders and burgers and other creative spins on Mexican dishes.  I love this place. Sit inside during the summer  sit outside during the fall  winter and spring.
Paco's Tacos,224,I can t believe I m saying this  but this place has better tacos than Torchys  but not as good queso . Paco s provides huge high quality delicious tacos for  2-4. I highly recommend the breakfast and gringo tacos 
Paco's Tacos,225,Not bad not bad at all  Indulged in the attitude slider  which is a mini beef patty topped with chorizo  cheese  chipotle mayo and pico  which I subbed out for avocado  . Sliders were on a semi sweet fresh miniature bun and were super yum  They came with a side of queso  which didn t have much added flavor but it s melted cheese so who can complain  I ll be back to this little divy taco shack 
Paco's Tacos,226,I love the fact that they serve breakfast all day... however  there is an additional charge   1 more  if you order after 11 a.m.  We came here on the way to play golf at William Morris... and I must admit  it was a great find  The place is very sweet  when you walk in you can tell it s a converted home from the 40s-50s...   I ordered Paco s Big Man - think open face breakfast burrito   5.95 - I ordered after 11 a.m. ... it comes served on a 10  flour tortilla topped with refried beans  cheese  peppers  potatoes  bacon  and two eggs over easy - topped with salsa - DELICIOUS   The front yard was also very cozy and was dog friendly...I will definitely be back for this 
Paco's Tacos,227,Friendly Taco spot with a sweet patio.  Everyone is smiling at Paco s--behind the counter  in the kitchen  on the patio  inside at the funky little tables while eating tacos.  Great tacos at reasonable prices  cold beer and pleasant folks  plus a great patio to hang out and tip one back while you are dining.
Paco's Tacos,228,I ve never been a big fan of Tex-Mex  mainly because most of the entr es strike me as cheesy fat grenades for big-boned people with bad teeth. I also rarely see the phrases  Tex-Mex  and  Healthy Lifestyle Choices  used in the same sentence.   But I m first to acknowledge that if you think things through instead of jumping the gun to conclusions  you can pretty much find some benefit in anything  which includes Tex-Mex as well. For instance  if you re low-carbing  fajitas can be your best friend. And if you occasionally foray through life as a Veghead like I do  Tex-Mex offers a whole world of that can be fun to play with - Paco s Taco just makes the decision process faster  amp  easier.   My favorite thing here is the Rice Bowl  I think the saut ed spinach  amp  mushroom with an optional dollop of black beans for  4 is pretty much a perfect meal. Paco s also makes two great veggie tacos- the Hatch and the El Flaco - and if you lose the cheese and egg in the El Flaco  I believe you re now doing vegan. I should also mention the taco prices here range from  3 to  4  which puts them head-on with both Torchy s  amp  TacoDeli. It s your call who offers the better value.      But parking is easy  the delightful Ashley S. is a regular here  and on a Thursday evening at 7 it was filled with nice white people along with the two of us. Use your Yelp check-in app for a free Jarrito. This place appears to be a converted house  the inside dining areas used to be bedrooms  and you re going to hear every conversation around you. The outside table area is pretty expansive and probably fun to around in decent weather. The only reason I m not giving Paco s five stars is I kept getting whiffs of  musty old house smell   which may not be a big deal for you  but it drove me up the wall. I seriously considered negotiating Febreze squirts for another dollop of black beans. Maybe next time.
Paco's Tacos,229,Reasons why I LOVE Paco  amp  his tacos   -Cute eclectic house -Nice patio -LIVE music frequently -FREE wifi -THE FOOD  -Paco is my favorite uncle s name -Always parking -Convenient location right off the highway  I started coming here A LOT more than I should admit. Because as much as I love this place  when is eating out every meal healthy for your insides  Well  when my fridge decided to stop working over a weekend  I had to toss everything. Then I got lazy and didn t go to the store to re-stock up on anything. And good thing I didn t because the electricity went out in our area for an entire day after the fact.   Thanks to Paco s  I didn t starve. I simply either found a buddy to sit outside and eat with me or called in a pick-up order. Even if I didn t live a mile and a half away from this place  hey before biking here I had to check  I d still go out of my way for their food.   Some personal faves would be the  4.99 migas plate. Their white poblano rice is out of this world good. The corn tortillas aren t teeny tiny which is why I normally for-go corn tortillas at most places. And because its much harder to make or buy good corn tortillas. In my humble  tortilla snobbish opinion  their tortillas have got it goin  on. I dig the picadillo taco which is only  1.99 and can easily be one meal if you re not trying to overstuff yourself. The migas are fabulous  so I normally pair a migas taco  also just  1.99  with a dinner taco. But my new personal favorite taco is the carnitas taco   1.99 baybayyyy  and its ingredients make my mouth happy. Delicious carnitas  this literally means  little meats  in Spanish  with fresh guac and pico de gallo. They had just made some sweet sour kind of sauce and the man who is always there when I go paired it nicely with my taco.  They even have sliders  have yet to try  if you re all taco-ed out  though I will never be. Its not in my blood to grow tired of food like this. And they have gorditas as well  definitely huge and filling. And no  these are not the Taco Bell s crap  Mexican  version of a gordita.   I think I might be Paco s   1 fan.
Paco's Tacos,230,I ve lived in Austin my whole life and I have passed this place up so many times. A co worker was telling me she had tried the fish tacos and they were delicious. I decided to try it out but I didn t try the fish tacos. I tried the beef fajita and carnitas tacos  the big man taco  oh man   and the beef fajita torta  not all in one sitting  ha ha but WOW every single thing I tried has been delicious  Flavorful  amp  huge servings. Next will be that fish taco I ve heard it s the BEST taco there. I will be a regular from now on 
Paco's Tacos,231,My husband and I tried Paco s for the first time last night  We were very impressed  I got the shrimp and the fish tacos  Everything was high quality ingredients and I enjoyed mine very much  My husband got the beef fajita tacos. He said that the beef was tender and delicious  We also got the queso which was very good  Loved the outside seating as well  The staff checked on us and made sure everything was to our satisfaction. We love finding little gems like this  We will be back   We would like to see house made chips is my only recommendation for the establishment.
Paco's Tacos,232,I absolutely loved this place. Went for breakfast Sunday late morning. The  2 Bloody Mary was delicious  good coffee  had an El Flaco taco and a build your own...the chorizo in the build your own was amazing. Very cute shady outdoor seating and a lot of it. The service was incrediblesuper fast and the sweetest most helpful woman. Highly recommend  I d go back and try every taco on the menu if I was visiting for longer.
Paco's Tacos,233,What a nice surprise  We didn t know what to think based on what you see from the street. Once we pulled in to the back parking  we immediately knew we had underestimated the place. The atmosphere decor is charming and casual. We went inside where you order at the counter  and it was obvious there were  regulars  there chatting with the employees. The service was friendly and fun. Although it s counter service  they brought our food and checked on us. Delicious tacos  I had the Gringo  amp  the Carnitas....yum    It was nice to get good guacamole  hand-made tortillas  and fresh ingredients. They have bottled beer options  but not a big drink selection. Once the sunlight decreased  the patio lights came on and created an even cooler atmosphere   We will definitely be back. And they deliver in the area     I m so excited    
Paco's Tacos,234,Last time I came to Austin  the first food I ate was a breakfast taco from Torchy s. The whole rest of the trip I was obsessed and kept wanting to return to Torchy s. On my most recent trip  my friend  who lives in Austin  said we should try a breakfast taco from Paco s  which we did. Suffice to say I am converted. Paco s tortillas are amazingly fresh and delicious  and their ingredients are cooked perfectly. The variety of salsas is a big plus. I will keep coming back every time I am in town.
Paco's Tacos,235,I had only been here once in the 4 years of moving here. I work in the area and drive by Pacos almost every day. I stopped on morning and got the Big Man breakfast. It was really good. Today I went back for the second time and again got the Big Man Breakfast. Again it was soooo good. I ordered a side of chips and salsa. I will be bringing my wife here to try as I know she will like it. My food was hot when I got it. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients in the food and the salsa. I highly recommend this place. They have good food for a great price.
Paco's Tacos,236,Excellent food. I want to make that perfectly clear. However  there was zero communication on the delivery fee which was as much as the entire order . Go pick it up.
Paco's Tacos,237,5  stars for Pacos Tacos  Love the little patio area and the food is delish   and super cheap  
Paco's Tacos,238,We have been coming here for years. This is one of our favorite places for breakfast tacos in town. I always get the same thing - 1  Egg  potato and cheese 2  Egg  bacon and cheese. This are a pretty good size  2 will definitely fill you up. Their salsa bar is amazing btw. My favorites are the creamy one and the orangey one. So good  Definitely check this place out. Plus  it s so cute. The patio is super adorable  and there s always some kind of trivia board in the back room to see if you re smarter than a 5th grader. I learn something new every time.
Paco's Tacos,239,Paco s is my go-to taco joint. The food is consistently awesome  they can accommodate my aggravating allergies  and the staff have great taste in comic books  Not only that  but they serve the best carnitas in town  along with a swathe of other options  and have an endless supply of iced tea that is always perfectly steeped.   Come for the unassuming  laid-back vibe in a city rife with pretentious boutiquey eateries  or come for the quick service  bloody marys  live music on the weekends  and plenty of outdoor seating. There s wifi  parking  and beer if you want it. It s a great place to bring colleagues  kids  out-of-town guests  or a laid-back date.  Oh  they also do breakfast  Starting at 6 am. For mad cheap 
Paco's Tacos,240,I am a long time Austin resident and Paco s Tacos is a brand new place.  You probably might not have heard of it since it opened in fall 2010.  We all know in Austin you can get plenty of tacos and also breakfast anywhere in the city.  Paco s gets 5 stars for the simple reason of great tasting food   Some people rate service  decor  and pricing based on a review.  I consider those factors also but my goal is always taste.  Everything ordered at Paco s was freshly prepared  well handled and had great size portions.  3 different salsa to chose  smoky red salsa  spicy verde  then a creamy green salsa .  The place has the feel of a true Austin style locally owned restaurant.    All day breakfast items   I say order one breakfast  amp  one lunch item.  My choice is a Gordita Con Tocino  egg  cheese  bacon  potatoes  and then a lunch taco Paco s pick  steak  potatoes  green  amp  red poblano peppers and melting montery jack cheese .  Add any salsa flavor to top it off.  The best way to describe their Gordita is imagine a mexican style flat biscuit  cut in half and then the ingredients in between.  Yum.  Also they serve a half corn  amp  half flour tortillas  or just get all corn or all flour .   Menu also has fish  amp  shrimp tacos for those fans out there.   LCD TV indoors and outdoors with DirecTV.  Perfect for when any sports game are on.  Cozy indoor seating and huge outdoor seating area with quiet patio area.  Staff is friendly and very attentive to their customers. It is like they want to hear the customer s direct input to make their restaurant better.  They now sell beer  and do run beer specials.   They also seem to be active with social media with Yelp and Facebook.  The location actually makes it a great lunch candidate.  I-35   51st exit  take East 51st 1 2 mile  just right after Lancaster stoplight.  6 30am - 8pm everyday  9 30pm Fri Sat   closed on Mondays.  You do need to try this place out 
Paco's Tacos,241,Original   awesome   quality. The tacos and the service are both fantastic. And what a cool dive   and clean .  Only complaint is that the menu is too large. I have them decide for me and have never been disappointed.
Paco's Tacos,242,This is my favorite taco joint in the city. Great service  nice people  and the tacos are the Jam    Would highly recommend 
Paco's Tacos,243,The tacos. The salsas. The staff. The ambiance outside on a nice day. Did I mention they deliver    Pacos is the best   Try the scallop taco 
Paco's Tacos,244,I took my wife here for her birthday breakfast at her behest  the new rival to Dora s tacos and Chipotle.  I had the special taco - Angus steak  and another mix  n  match. It was fairly quiet around 9am  with the owner carefully monitoring and training the staff.  The tacos were yummy - interesting green salsa rounded out the flavour  and the tortillas were fresh and intriguing.  I hope they get their booze license  and there will then truly be no reason to ever go to Chipotle again.  Nice decor  plenty of seating  attentive owner  yummy food. A winning combo.
Paco's Tacos,245,I really like the look of this place. I might enjoy it more in patio weather.  Just watch out turning into the parking lot  as I was almost smooshed by a bus due to some inept yahoo trying  and failing  to merge. Safety   The service seems straightforward. Counter service  then they get your name and walk around shouting it. However  on a day that was not busy  we waited long before the food arrived  and I noticed we weren t the only ones who were annoyed by this.   Thinking ahead  I ordered us chips and queso. The guy called for it immediately  so I assumed it would come out soon. It didn t. In fact  my friend s tacos came out  and he waited a bit  ate one taco  waited a bit more  and then a food runner called my name.   You had a gordita     Well  I had that and a taco  and I ordered queso quite a while ago.   Oh  I ll go check on that.   More time passes  and she returns with queso and chips. My friend has finished eating at this point.    You didn t get your taco    No  not yet.   She comes back to inform me a few minutes later that it s being made. What   When I finally get the rest of my meal  she drops the ticket. There are 3 items on it. Why in the world would you take an order to a table when the ticket has three items and you only have one  I don t know.   Hopefully the food is worth it  right    Eh. Not so much.  Chicken Gordita- beans  meat  cheese. A bit fewer fillings than most places these days. It wasn t the best I ve had  but it was decent  and went with some of the salsas.  Hatch Chile with Shrimp- uninteresting  unseasoned shrimp that could ve easily been pre-cooked for the way they looked. No biggie if the rest of the taco makes it all come together. Unfortunately  this is the messiest taco on the planet and is nearly impossible to eat. Plus  those flavors didn t come together like I d hoped.  Queso- Nothing special  especially given how late it arrived. Salsas- There were some good ones and some not-as-impressive ones. They may have been the best part of the experience.   I d like to give them another chance sometime  but I don t know if I ll go out of my way to swing by there again.
Paco's Tacos,246,My new favorite place to get tacos in town.  A very large selection of menu items  it actually can be hard to choose sometimes.  The folks running the place are super nice  and I like the decor - shabby chic I guess some would call it.  Reasonable prices  friendly people and very good food.  Paco s  you re doing it right.
Paco's Tacos,247,I am doing a five for this one people. They got it together in five days. The service  the love in the food  the flavors  the atmosphere. Good God almighty    I had the Migas taco and Tortilla soup...queso and chips as well. Let me start by saying that on the long trip to IKEA I stated that this was the best Migas taco ever. Perfectly cooked with blue corn chips  ask to add cheese . Next tortilla soup that is traditional without the bone in chicken and full corn on the cob. I have been all over Mexico folks. The queso is not too thick and not too thin and it has the good stuff blended in it. Some of the best that I have had. My partner for breaklunch had the potato egg and cheese taco and fish taco. I did not try they P.E.C. but the fish was awesome with the coleslaw.  I need to mention that the price of the Migas Taco was around  1.85 and the rockin  queso was  3.50. Great deal.  I will probably rotate between this place and the Spicewood Tacodeli every month.  Margaret  owner  and staff are super attentive. They know what they are doing.
Paco's Tacos,248,Wow  this place is awesome  I just visited Austin for the first time and learned about the breakfast taco trend. We tried a bunch of different places  but this one is hands down the best. I even had to go back another time before I left  I love that they have a variety of hot sauces to try  tons of different toppings for the tacos...cold drinks  and it s all at a great price  The el gringo with shrimp and mango salsa is amazing if you re into seafood. Plus all the breakfast tacos were great. I wish I lived closer  Two thumbs up.
Paco's Tacos,249,Not my favorite breakfast tacos. I had a potato and egg  amp  a bacon and egg on their blended flour-corn tortilla. The tortilla didn t have the softness of flour or the nutty  fresh flavor of corn  so it seemed like they tried to fix two things that didn t need fixing. I also wasn t a huge fan of their salsas...they were all weirdly sweet  The tacos were a good size for what you pay though and I could tell that the ingredients were fresh. Under-seasoned  but fresh. Parking and seating at 8 30 on a Saturday morning was plenty but I can see it filling up later. I can see some people really liking these tacos but not my taste.
Paco's Tacos,250,Paco s is so  so good.   The service was great. Everyone was friendly   They have so many things on the menu  from tacos and enchiladas  to sliders and guac. Between the four of us we were able to try a lot from the menu and it was all excellent.   I ordered the enchilada plate. The beans were so flavorful  and the rice... something as simple as rice was ah-mazing.   It s surprisingly spacious inside. There is plenty of seating inside for two people to six or seven people  and there s even more seating outside that is mostly shaded.   I don t normally Instagram my food  but this.. I Instagrammed this.  We are adding this to our  regular  list.
Paco's Tacos,251,If I lived or worked closer to Paco s  I would need an intervention.  Seriously.  I ve been coming here for a couple of years and it s always good    The owners are wonderful and so is their staff.  I have tried quite a few menu items and have been happy with them all.  They have indoor and outdoor seating- you can bring your dogs to their outdoor area.  The only drawback is parking.  It s a very small lot  so it can get tricky  especially on weekends.
Paco's Tacos,252,Almost 2 years later and I still frequent Paco s almost every weekend. They ve gotten busier due to growing popularity  and I couldn t be happier for this little  but growing  establishment  The parking lot IS small and sometimes hard to maneuver  but they bought the lot next door and they re working on it    Try the carnitas  trust me.
Paco's Tacos,253,One of my favorite breakfast spots in town  Best chorizo  egg  and cheese taco I ve ever had with some of my favorite tortillas. This place is super cheap with tacos under  2 if you go before 11am. My favorite part about Paco s is easily their large selection of sauces- my favorites are the honey habanero and the creamy green sauce. LOVE THIS PLACE 
Paco's Tacos,254,Atmosphere is nice and the staff was phenomenal.  Food was not to my liking.  Fajitas  Tacos and Enchiladas have hunks of potatoes and carrots   Not what I expected in Tex-Mex food.  Will not return for food.
Paco's Tacos,255,Holly Cow Batman...Migas for  4.95....AND it tastes good   ...Man what a find...Super cool place...I don t think I have ever seen owners  of a joint like this  care and interact with the customers so much...Salsa bar was outstanding....they will have at least one that suits your taste buds...Rice really stood out for me...Its awesome to find something on my plate that makes me go WOW...Hit this place UP...you wont be disappointed...we WILL be back for lunch...
Paco's Tacos,256,This place is cute and consistently good food. I love coming here for brunch  but line can be kinda long on the weekend. The staff is friendly.  I love the Big Man for breakfast and my hubby really digs the tacos. We also love the  2 brunch mimosas.  These guys lose points in that the food always takes such a long time to come out  even when the line wasn t that long. The place is not dirty  but doesn t feel clean  and looks sketchy from the road.
Paco's Tacos,257,Best kept secret for tacos in austin. While there is a ton of competition for this type of food  Pacos Tacos stands out. Amazing food  and better prices than you would expect for this quality. The venue is also very cool  with a noticeably Austin vibe. Only problem is the parking sucks  and the place can get very crowded sometimes. Best deal for breakfast tacos in the whole city though before 11am. Also  you can t top their service
Paco's Tacos,258,Very good food however it gets a little spendy when ordering multiple tacos  the staff is always very talkative and friendly when I come in and I ve be ever had to wait too long for my food. I would recommend an addition for more indoor seating on hot Texas afternoons.
Paco's Tacos,259,Food was great   We had a chicken quesadilla and it was packed  Gringo taco  shrimp  was amazing and was so full of shrimp  and brisket sliders  comes with 3    We took home leftovers.  Staff was friendly and helpful when we asked what they recommended.  Looks like a super fun place when it s cooler but also has indoor seating for hot weather like today.
Paco's Tacos,260,Had The Hatch and a Cece s Pescado here. Man they were both delicious and were delivered to my table fresh and very warm. They have a few different kinds of salsa available for you to use for your tacos. Though I didn t really talk to any of the people who worked here  was way too tired to blab  they all seemed relatively nice and jocular  my kind of people  At first I was thinking that this probably wouldn t be a very good restaurant because the exterior had a corrugated and a bit of a dilapidated build to it  yet the tacos were anything but dilapidated. They were next to immaculate in all actuality. I ll definitely be returning here  and I might just up my rating in the near distant future if return visits prove to be as exhilarating.  Edit  next visit I had was also amazing. Taco were very fresh  warm  and delicious. Last time I went was pretty mediocre. The food was anything but fresh or warm. It was some of the most mediocre tacos I ve had which is weird because before that the tacos were fantastic. My rating is more of a 7 out of 10 stars atm. I ll go again at some point soon and hopefully I won t be disappointed the next time around   .  Edit  Next time I went was amazing again    I guess it was just an off day for them when I did that review.
Paco's Tacos,261,Great place to enjoy Mexican food when the weather is great - they have a lot of outdoor seating and decent parking in the back  personally i ve never had problems . The food has never let me down and the prices are reasonable. the inside is a little cramped especially if it s busy so be warned. Overall a very relaxing place to eat and the service is great - they call you by your name when your order is ready and they are dog friendly.  I would recommend you check this place out when there is not a lunch rush so you can enjoy your meal and find parking  which other reviews mention is not great at peak hours 
Paco's Tacos,262,I tried Paco s again this morning. I ordered a sausage  egg  and cheese taco to-go. After a 15 minute walk back to my office  the taco was still warm and the cheese melty. The sausage was flavorful and the taco overall was way better than last time I ordered. Generous amount of ingredients and well cooked. The poblano cream salsa on the taco was a win  very flavorful and packs the perfect amount of heat. I also just noticed that you can buy their salsa by the gallon    Good prices  friendly staff  and kitschy decor. Great place 
Paco's Tacos,263,I love Paco s  I love Paco s Tacos    Delicious tacos at a great price   Delightful salsas  often changed up so you get to try new flavor crystals on subsequent visits   2 mimosas on the weekends  always Topo Chico  amp  funky eclectic awesome Austin decor.  All the stars 
Paco's Tacos,264,We had to give this place a try since its so close to our place  walking distance  and came recommended by a coworker. We went relatively early on a Saturday night and found it to be fairly busy with most inside tables full but lots of open tables outside.  I have to say  I love the decor of this restaurant  it just feels like a cool place and they made the effort to give it a unique feel.  We tried out the chicken enchiladas  enchiladas at a taco place  Blasphemy   since I really was craving some good enchiladas and two tacos  the Pollo Fajitas and the Carnitas.   First the enchiladas. Really solid with a great cheese sauce on top  made even better with the home made salsa. The charro beans are unlike any I have had in a long time  with big pieces of bacon included. Can t say I enjoyed them more than your standard pinto or re-fried but it was a nice change.  The tacos were really the hit  with the pollo fajitas being the better of the two  full of flavor. The carnitas were good but needed a flavor boost from either the queso  which was awesome  or one of their many good salsas. Also would have loved some more chips with the taco plate but we are realizing that chips with your Mexican food is very hit or miss in these parts.   We probably would have given this place 5 stars but it took a LONG time to get our food. It all came out fresh and piping hot but it was nearly 30 minutes to get what I mentioned above and the place was as mentioned  not terribly busy. We plan to go back for sure and try a couple of their other tacos.
Paco's Tacos,265,Best tacos in Austin. Must get items   Paco s Pick Bandito Hook Em   The scallop one isn t bad either. This place is similar to Torchy s except even better. Go now 
Paco's Tacos,266,The best prices in Austin for sure. The food was excellent and had big portions. DEFF. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK
Paco's Tacos,267,I really cant rate this place because as yet I ve been unable to park or get anywhere close to the building.  My girlfriend and I just spent 30 minutes negotiating the terrible  terrible parking and by the end of it we were over Paco s before we arrived.  There is no signage or rhyme reason to the parking  with inconsiderate patrons  and an employee  completely blocking the driveway for 10 minutes.  I ve heard good things about the food  but unless you are going in an off time or on a weekday  avoid this place in your car.  We checked for parking nearby and were sorely disappointed.
Paco's Tacos,268,their breakfast tacos are delicious  I always get 2 flour tacos with 2-3 filings plus a drink and the total is always under  10  I ve tried other menu items but I honestly do not like them. Also  this place is convenient if you re in a hurry  you can call the order beforehand and usually are in and out in less than 5 minutes. Plenty of parking -- I ve dined in a couple of times but not something I prefer to do. Their barbacoa tacos don t taste like much  you can get better barbacoa tacos in other places nearby.
Paco's Tacos,269,Food is probably a 4. Wait staff was a bit eh. Food taste better without shitty service. Also... dick move on flipping the tip percentages backwards so that we accidentally leave TWENTY FIVE  where the usual 16 18 are. You d think after a 25 percent tip you d get your food without the side of attitude. Maybe don t go during the rush 
Paco's Tacos,270,Disclaimer  I was slightly inebriated while eating this food  so my judgment might have been clouded by the sweet whisperings of beer. Beer is a tricky little mistress  always shifting reality in your favor  I suppose that s why we chase the good times to the end of the bottle because we are never truly satisfied.    I went with the cheese enchiladas because beer gives me a one-track mind and I love cheese more than most people. When given the option between the mild red sauce or the spicier green sauce  just get the spicier green sauce. I have no idea if the mild red sauce is good  but spicier is always better.  Unless you have a sensitive stomach  in which case you should probably get the mild red sauce.  Regardless of which option you pick  there is a large tray filled with four different kinds of salsa right at the counter. You can go salsa crazy   I am now wondering if the mild red sauce is included in the salsa tray. I m not sure and drunk me forgot to even begin to inquire  but this is a question that perhaps you can ask when you choose to dine at this fine establishment.    Included in the salsa tray are two types of green sauce and two types of red sauce. I have no idea what any of them are  but I put all of them on my food and I seemed to enjoy all of them. Drunk tastebuds are not the best at discerning flavors and are more black and white in their thinking - food is either yummy or nasty. This food was deemed yummy and I ate every last bit of it. The charro beans were yummy  I think I used red sauce    the rice was good when paired with the enchilada  I think I used green sauce    and the enchiladas were filled with cheesy goodness  insert other salsas here .    The guy at the counter was super de duper friendly. I liked him and his cheery demeanor made a good impression.   I have no idea if this is Mexican food for white people. I m pretty sure it is  but my memory about what I ate is questionable at best. I know that my positively skewed reality judged it as good  but I don t know what sober me thinks. Take that for what you will and I will continue to be honest in my reviews so that you know approximately what you are getting yourself into.  I have to say approximately for legal purposes  if I had been sober  then I could say exactly. Oh  how clouded judgment will come back to get you    Here s what sober me does know - the next day  I pooped three times. That s right - three times in one day. Paco has apparently made it his job to clean out your bowels and he is a god damn expert on the subject. Do not doubt his abilities  for that would be insulting  Paco is the leading scholar on the subject of emptying bowels.   Trust in Paco and he will show you the way to spicy  cheesy  bowel-cleaning bliss.
Paco's Tacos,271,Just tried this place for the first time today. As a visitor to Austin  the great restaurants here are too many to count  Paco s will be added to my top ten list for sure  The BIG man breakfast burrito is excellent  The staff was friendly and the service was fast. I will definitely come back every chance I get.
Paco's Tacos,272,I d heard about this place from Yelp and intended to try it sometime. One afternoon  I was heading to the HEB at Mueller and passed this place  and it was such a cool weird looking shack of a place  that I decided I needed to stop on the way home to get lunch.   The interior and exterior are both totally  Austin Weird . It s sort of a dumpy  small place  but you can tell they WANT it to look like that. Crazy decor  and it looks like it used to be some sort car shop or something  which it may very well have been. It has an outdoor patio that s quirky  and by no means fancy.   I ordered a quesadilla for myself and a couple tacos  one breakfast  one vegetarian  for the fella. I also ordered chips and a small queso  because I m always on a quest to find a queso better than Torchy s. Bad news first  queso was decent  but still pretty run of the mill. No Torchy s competition here.   Good news  the food is pretty delicious. Both tacos were thoroughly enjoyed and my quesadilla was great. Cheesy and came with sides of quac  pico  and sour cream. Also it was a large portion  enough to save for another meal if you re having sides like chips. The menu was big  and had all sorts of variety  burritos  gorditas  sliders  tacos  chilaquiles  soups  etc etc etc.  Pro Tip  it was pretty busy at a random  1 30 or 2   hour on a Saturday  but there were still places to sit. If you re taking out  you can order online before you go in to pick it up  which is a good idea  because it s kind of cramped in there if you re waiting for food and not sitting.
Paco's Tacos,273,Yum   Went there today and it was really good.  I had the Hook  Em  Smoked Brisket chipotle BBQ sauce  pico de gallo   amp  homemade coleslaw  that was  3.85 and a Paco s Pick  Angus steak  seasoned potatoes  poblano  amp  red bell peppers with Monterey Jack cheese  that was  4.50.  I added refried beans and rice to make a meal.  Both of the tacos were stuffed full and very tasty.  Out of the two I liked the Paco s Pick better  but they are both fantastic.  I also need to note their beans and rice that people say  oh they all taste the same ...no  they don t.  They were good here   The rice was very fluffy and I can t pinpoint the seasoning  but it was very nice.  It s a little on the pricey side for tacos  but it was very good.  They also have some excellent outdoor seating to offer...a wee bit noisy because of 35  but still great to soak up the sun.  Parking in back.
Paco's Tacos,274,This place is amazing  By far my favorite tacos in Austin  and I have had my fair share of tacos. Their tortillas are amazing and I have high standards on my tortillas. Besides the tacos being amazing  they are also quick and freshly made. Their salsas are amazing and fresh  reminds me of my abuelita s salsa. And the employees are amazing. They remember my name every time I go in and  I live in south Austin  so not as often as I would like  and are super friendly. I will go out of my way to make sure I get my Paco s fix in. Not to mention  my parents used to go here when they were in their 20s for drinks  tacos  and a good time. I believe it s a family owned restaurant. I support this place 100   Delishhh 
Paco's Tacos,275,Yum  Yum  Yum  That pretty much sums it up. This tiny out of the way place has great tacos  The service is awesome. The outside seating is wonderful when it s not too hot. They are pretty busy at lunch time but the wait is not bad at all. The creamy cilantro sauce is great  And if you want to indulge  try one of their home baked brownies   Oh My  Brownie heaven  
Paco's Tacos,276,We should have come here on a sunny day. But we wanted breakfast tacos on a gloomy Sunday afternoon  so there weren t many options. The outdoor patio looked like it would ve been a great place to enjoy our food  if it hadn t been so darn soggy. Indoors was a disappointing contrast. Although the decor was colorful  the walls and floors seemed grimy  and nothing was particularly clean. That didn t help to enhance the food  which was plentiful  but bland  with an almost-dishwater flavor to the eggs. Made you wonder what they were cooking in. My son couldn t finish his breakfast taco  because it simply had an unpleasant taste. The  guacamole  was merely roughly mashed avocado with a little flavor  but not much.  Maybe the patio is a great place for a beer on a warm day 
Paco's Tacos,277,I have only been here a couple of times but it s a pretty rad little place.  The breakfast tacos are yummy  the drinks are cheap  the service is friendly  and the patio is cozy.  What else do you want   Oh yeah... a place to park.  The parking lot is tiny and it can be a challenge to snag a spot. That is really the only knock against this place. So  if you get super rage-filled when you can t find a parking spot you may want to go elsewhere. Otherwise  swing into Paco s when you have a chance.  It s pretty rad 
Paco's Tacos,278,My new favorite taco place  sorry Torchy s . I had driven by here countless times and finally made it in  only to regret I hadn t been sooner. We went for dinner and everything we had was great - I especially enjoyed the Gringo. The ingredients were fresh  great tortillas  and they give you HUGE portions that make the price very reasonable. All of the staff was friendly and helpful.   My only gripe is that I wish they had more vegetarian taco options  but they have definitely found a new regular. Don t forget your Go Local card 
Paco's Tacos,279,One the best taco places in Austin. Don t let Chuy s or Torchy s fool you  this is real deal.
Paco's Tacos,280,Pacos...  You really deserve 3 stars but I m gonna give you 4.  I m gonna give you 4 because you re quick  cheap  staff is very friendly  and the brownies.   My god  the brownies..  The quality of food is average but still filling and the menu is huge.  Granted  I only get one thing here and that is the breakfast tacos   3   but I still have a lot to choose from.  Go here if you re looking for breakfast under  10 in less than 10 minutes.
Paco's Tacos,281,Stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon  just looking for something quick and not too pricey. By the looks of the place  I thought it would be cheaper.   The portion sizes are too small for the price -  4.25 for ONE regular-size taco  That s a bit much. It was good  I won t deny it  but need I say again   4.25      So I got two tacos  the Paco s Pick and the Hatch with Chicken. I was full and mostly satisfied  the flavor was good  the atmosphere was okay. I couldn t figure out if it was Tex-Mey or Hipster or purposely weird or what.   It did take a while  that s why I didn t give 4 stars. Meh.
Paco's Tacos,282,Great tacos and bowls  We grabbed a selection of food from this place - it was all delicious   My hubby and son loved the scallop taco  my daughters and I took to the pork bowls. Everything is fresh and delish  My hubby picked up our order so I can t tell you much about location but the food is two thumbs up. It s Austin taking over east side- yummy--
Paco's Tacos,283,Good food and the best brownies I ve ever had     The service is great and the staff is very friendly 
Paco's Tacos,284,Paco s Tacos was my breakfast stop this morning. Just a short drive from my hotel  I found this neat little taco restaurant and  I must say  I was thoroughly impressed  The tacos were ready in a flash  the coffee was great  and the staff was super friendly. A small-town  homey atmosphere in hustle and bustle of Austin.  As for the tacos  they were great  The tortillas were delicious  soft enough to easily chew but firm enough to not rip and let the taco take a ginormous dump on my work clothes. The only recommendation I would have would be to add some salt and pepper to the eggs  just for some added flavor. Other than that  fantastic food  Try the egg and chorizo for breakfast  you won t be sorry...
Paco's Tacos,285,Driving on I-35  I thought to myself   What should I have for breakfast    I had a Spanish final at 9 AM and I was headed to campus early to finish studying.  Well  why study in PCL  the Perry Castaneda Library for you Longhorn noobs   It s oh so dreary...  Pulled up my Yelp app and typed in  migas .  Where can I find myself some damn good migas   Paco s Tacos it is   Upon first impression  I do love the decor.  Very eclectic and suits Austin.  The front of house staff is very prompt and friendly and it was good to see that they get a lot of business.  I ordered the migas plate as opposed to the big man plate because I wasn t sure if I would have enough time to study AND eat.  I have no idea how big it is.  Here  you simply pay at the counter  gather your own silverware and napkins  grab your drink  and sit down.  About ten or so minutes later  I have no idea really because I was studying   my migas plate arrives   The tortillas come wrapped in aluminum foil.  I had already gotten my silverware  but the cashier server got a fork for me anyway.  Thank you      So  I put some of my migas into a tortilla and I take a bite.  In my opinion  the migas tasted a bit bland to me.  I guess I was just expecting some punch of flavor or something.  Hot sauce to the rescue   I got their traditional red.  Nom nom nom.  I finished the eggs and now it was onto the rice and beans.  Damn  that rice is good.  It is really good and I wish I had a bowlful of it because  well  I m Asian and I love my rice and I don t care if this isn t jasmine rice.  It s rice and I love rice.  The refried beans were also delicious and I enjoyed the small sprinkling of cheese on top as well.  When I was done  I packed up my items and left  saying my goodbyes to the front staff.  They are so nice.  I opened the door to leave and -what     -  IS THAT A SQUIRREL   LOLOL.  I m used to squirrels being everywhere just from being on the UT campus  but it s just kind of like woah.  Well  I took a better look and it s just a little stuffed animal fox toy hanging on a rope connected to the door.  When the door opens  the fox moves up.  When the door closes  the fox goes down.  Haha  cute     Gotta love the decor   I would definitely like to come back here to try the Big Man 
Paco's Tacos,286,This place is fun and has a unique creative decor. If you are like me you like to observe your environment when you eat  then you will love it.  The taco choices are rather different and unique from other taco shacks and their mixed corn and flour tortillas are good. However  I wish they had them separate too 
Paco's Tacos,287,This place looks like it used to be a house converted to a restaurant. It can get really crowded inside esp on a full house but lots of seating outside as well. Im sure majority of folks come here in a car and parking is toward the back...and cramped. Luckily for me  this place is walking distance. Now the food is good  not great. They serve breakfast tacos until noon. Hubby loves the El Zarape burrito and he s not a big burrito fan..and neither am i. He couldnt stop talking about how good it was. Now where this place excels is customer service. The men who take your orders to your table are wonderful.
Paco's Tacos,288,Paco s is now serving Sliders   They have taken some of the delicious ingredients from their tacos and started stacking them on an angus  beef patty served on a slider bun  What an idea  The only thing better than a Hook  Em taco     A Hook  Em Slider  I also like the Black n Bleu   bacon  amp  bleu cheese crumbles  and the  2-3   mushrooms and guacamole . They are served 3 to an order andcome with a side of chips and queso. They have beer now so chase it down with a Modelo Especial and you re Primetime 
Paco's Tacos,289,Wanted to update my review. Paco s has really upped their game with take out service. The last three times I ve been there  the order is ready as promised and all is clearly labeled. With delicious tacos to boot.
Paco's Tacos,290,I was really happy to find this place in my neighborhood  It s become our go-to  and feels like a really authentic Texas place... I ve even seen bands playing there in the middle of the day with 110 degree heat with lots of people watching. Service here has always been good as well. Worth a stop.
Paco's Tacos,291,Quirky  fun atmosphere with extremely friendly staff.  Arrived right at the lunch hour rush  amp  was worried about timing on our food  but everything arrived quickly.  Food quality was great  and portion sizes were just right.  Enjoyed the fresh salsa bar as well  Will definitely come back again. Inside seating is tight but lots of outdoor seating.
Paco's Tacos,292,Great food and awesome atmosphere. Such a cool place to spend an afternoon with friends. The only downfall is the lack of  decent indoor seating... if weather isn t great  be prepared to be cramped because they re always packed  for good reasons  and there s only a handful of tables.
Paco's Tacos,293,What a neat find   Wonderful atmosphere food is wonderful and the staff was amazing   Don t miss this place   I don t usually place reviews but couldn t help but give a good one for pacos tacos.
Paco's Tacos,294,Ate here today and was NOT disappointed. We ordered at the register  left our name and was served at our table. Carne Guisado taco and Gringo shrimp taco were delicious  The  2 mimosas were easy on the wallet too. Not fancy  just a fun little place to eat  Will be back 
Paco's Tacos,295,God  I love this place.  I eat here more than any other place in Austin  yet for some reason have yet to write a review.  Time to change that.  My favorite thing here is the Cece s pescado taco  which is a delicious combo of fish  rice  and cabbage slaw.   I ve also started regularly ordering the shrimp enchilada plate with a red enchilada and a green one  sublime.  Although unassuming from the street  inside they have a nice  warm and cozy atmosphere and a great funky  eclectic patio- the perfect antidote to the new  cold restaurants popping up around town. The ambience is great  but my favorite thing about this place is the consistency.  I ve eaten here probably over 50 times and the food is ALWAYS good.  Props to their cooks.  Wonderful  solid place all around.
Paco's Tacos,296,Good place for to-go orders and for eating outdoors.  But the  quaint  rooms inside give me anxiety.  Parking is not fun  just be ready for possible issue and get over it.
Paco's Tacos,297,A coworker of mine brought their breakfast tacos to work one morning and they were some of the best I ve ever had. The eggs were perfectly done...I like my eggs very well done in a taco so it doesn t make the tortilla too soggy. The cheese that they used was completely melted and slightly creamy  and the bacon was good quality bacon...not the thin crispy pre-made kind you just throw in the microwave for a few seconds. Aside from the taco itself  the options of sauces and salsas were also delicious  The only reason why I m not giving them 5 stars is because I haven t tried any of their other food  but I definitely recommend the breakfast tacos  
Paco's Tacos,298,I ve been to pacos a couple of times since moving to Austin. Definitely some of the best tacos I ve had. The staff are great and the tacos are delicious    I highly recommend the hook  em  but it d be hard to go wrong.
Paco's Tacos,299,I was so glad to see Paco s going strong when I got back to the states. I was gone for 4 long years. The owners are the nicest people. The food is delicious and staff is the best. Everyone is welcome there  and treated like family. Kudos  Thank you Paco s for hanging in there and making our neighborhood a great place to live   Booger Red
Paco's Tacos,300,This place is kitchy and adorable. The space inside is small and cute  and the patio is large and spacious. They just opened up a cantina outside as well. Staff is super friendly and helpful  and we had a chance to meet and talk with the owner  and he is a local Austinite who cares about his customers and business. The food here is always solid and there s a lot to choose from. We are looking forward to trying brunch here one weekend with mimosa specials and hanging out on the patio or cantina. Since moving to this part of town  this has become a regular stop for my friends and me.
Paco's Tacos,301,I ve been here once. it can get crowded. it s good. I had the taco plate. the service was good. it has a gravel parking lot or at least it did at one time.
Paco's Tacos,302,This is my favorite taco place  I get food here multiple times a week. Mostly I build my own breakfast taco combinations  but I ve had a lot of different things on their large menu  which is delicious. They have awesome salsas as well  and my favorite is the creamy poblano. The queso is wonderful. They can get pretty busy during regular rush times and their parking lot can fill up  but I think that is just Austin in general. The staff is also really friendly and move fast to get food out.
Paco's Tacos,303,Wow  here from Dallas for a conference- tried the FTB  vegetarian taco  and the hatch tacos with shrimp- puts Torchys and Fuzzy Taco to shame  Very cool atmosphere- order inside the little house and then go outside with your bottled beer and enjoy the pebbled courtyard and black iron tables- this place wreaks Austin cool  So glad I stopped 
Paco's Tacos,304,We live near by and go here all the time  every week. They know us. It is as much a restaurant as a community.   Pretty much everyone who works there is kind and competent.  The food has become comfort food to us.  Try the tortilla soup Try the migas  but eat it fresh not to go  Try the rice...rice is a big deal to me. Sliders are good as well. My favorite is going green. Yes  some of them have mayo so if you are anti mayo order something else.  Also  their coffee is pretty good and on a warm day you can sit outside with kids or dogs or newspapers.  What really keeps us coming back  besides the awesome folks  is the creamy poblano salsa.
Paco's Tacos,305,Tacos are way better than torchies  IMHO    the ambiance  especially the patio is very cool. I recommend one should check out in late evening...
Paco's Tacos,306,Tried this place for the first time today and I enjoyed it. I had both the bandito taco and the hook  em taco  both of which were pretty good. That being said  two tacos and a drink for  10 before tip was a bit much. I have 4 stars and that is only because I didn t have the barbacoa like my friend who suggested three stars. The barbacoa was mushy and bland sadly. My brother was not overly impressed with the carnitas either  not bad just nothing special.   Customer service was on point very friendly cashier and very cool little environment. Would try again but at the same time  it could be beat by  2 tacos off a truck.
Paco's Tacos,307,Finally tried this place this afternoon. The decor is pretty awesome  and the parking behind the building is more plentiful than it appears from the street.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in. They were very friendly when taking our order. I got the carne guisada plate and my SO got a Paco s Pick taco and a barbacoa taco. He thoroughly enjoyed his tacos. My carne guisada was so tender and flavorful. It was full of lean meat and not gristle like some places in town. I was very impressed. The rice was weird  and I didn t particularly care for it. It tasted very buttery to me. My SO liked it though and ate mine.   They have several different types of salsa to choose from  and they serve breakfast all day  so I will definitely be back.
Paco's Tacos,308,Yuck... I tried their beef and chicken enchilada plate and thought their take on classic enchiladas went all wrong.  Instead of enchilada sauce  they give you the option of using one of their dipping sauces to top them off. I asked for whatever was their traditional sauce  and they used their red salsa.  ...The enchiladas ended up tasting very tomato-y like an Italian dish.  Now the filling... the beef enchilada consists of ground meat with potato  which tasted like something that s suppose to fill the inside of a minced meat pie.  Very odd.  Odd can be good  but this kind of odd was not done right.  Also  the queso was too thick and resembled too much of the kind you get at the movie theatre.  Um  ew.  I feel like queso should be a little mor runny... But that s my preference.  These thing said  the service was great so no complaints regarding staff   Unfortunately  the food was a total miss  so we won t be coming back 
Paco's Tacos,309,These are some gringo tacos y all. Despite being named Paco s  this spot is pretty Austin-tatious. That is to say white. You guys know how I feel about Mexican food. Being from the RGV  if something doesn t have bars on the windows  I don t trust it.   That said  Pacos IS adorable. They ve got a unique tortilla sitch going on too. A mix of flour AND corn. It s an interesting spin on a debate that s the equivalent of the pie or cake debate. They ve got four salsas that range from mild to burn your face off and they were playing Earth Wind and Fire inside.   It s a good stop for breakfast tacos but I can t wait to get back and try the real star of the show  their barbacoa. I hear that s the must have.   Note to Pacos  Based on the clientele s appearance on Saturday morning  creating a  to go  instant hangover kit  including michelada fixings  would not be amiss.
Paco's Tacos,310,SERVICE  I can can eat just about anywhere if the food is decent  but if the service sucks  I am out of there. Michael took our order  was funny as heck and when my girls spoke to him he had the patience to hear about their special requests. Food is good  the chicken enchiladas...yum. Salsa good  tea good  melted cheese on top of stuff....real good 
Paco's Tacos,311,I always enjoy eating here and get the soy chorizo  potato  cheese tacos. They can be a little dry  but fantastic with green sauce. Their rice bowls are also yummy. Great atmosphere and they honor the go-local card for a small food discount. Very homey. Parking can be a challenge during the lunch rush  but worth it 
Paco's Tacos,312,Any establishment in Austin pushing FOR our Blastros  is aces in our book  but it s about the food  I ordered the breakfast torta  and my girls had their breakfast tacos. We took it with us  but the place was a nice clean place  with modest space  but packed with great atmosphere. The staff was accommodating to a half asleep oaf like me and so ready to help guide one through their menu  They have weekend mimosas  that I didn t try  but I will. Ok get home and this soft focaccia bread awaited me. Like all wondrous  pillowy objects  this torta felt good in my paw. I gripped it and the egg and cheese were in perfect abundance creating a soon to be visited pile of glistening goodness on my square plate of reflective foil. It was so good. Warm and flavors true to homemade goodness  Peppers  bacon  cheese  beans  splashing egg yokes  kept hitting my mouth s G-spot. Food is life  this first try was a shot at eternity  Will return.
Paco's Tacos,313,I used the online ordering system  and everything was exactly as I requested. Nice people  really good food with generous portions. I loved the menu selection  Will be back for sure. Thank you  
Paco's Tacos,314,I happen to really like these tacos.  They are alway filling and fresh.  The atmosphere is quaint...teeny backyard like seating area.  It s typically packed every weekend morning  I ve come to find out.  I keep coming back here...it s a fav for a few friends.    Give it a try.
Paco's Tacos,315,I have been wanting to try Paco s Tacos for a long time.  Well  I made up for it this past weekend  when my girlfriend and I ate there two mornings in a row.  I was attending a real estate seminar in the hotel district along I-35 near 290.  I remember seeing Paco s and I had been wanting to try it.  I was not disappointed    Their tacos and migas plate were DEE-LISH.  All the staff are friendly  courteous and helpful as well.  I highly recommend you try Paco s.  I m going to return for dinner someday.  This place is great.  Plenty of outdoor seating and free parking.
Paco's Tacos,316,Great tacos and great service. Their poblano cream salsa is amazing and the honey habanero is better than Taco Deli s habanero. If you want to explode your gut in a good way order the Zarape or the Big Man. Both are delicious and you will not be hungry after.
Paco's Tacos,317,Three stars because an employee looked at me  looked at my plate  and said   believe in yourself  you can do it   Not cool bro  I don t comment on how much you eat or imply I know your appetite or weight-related goals. It was a perhaps well-intentioned      dumbass comment from a non-critical  dubious dude. Besides him  all other employees were super nice.   So who goes to the Taco place and gets sliders  This guy. They are delicious  huge  and filling. Tortilla chips are airy  addicting. The outdoor seating area is full of cacti  wagon wheels  horse saddles  road signs  Wild West ephemera-it s great. And they sell Texas Trader s Coffee   The parking lot is too small to accommodate the lunch crowd. I had to back out into 35 traffic because some twenty something hipster high on class privilege decided it would be chill to block the entrance and exit to the lot with his Mercedes while he picked up his to-go order. Obviously this reflects poorly on the individual hipster and not Paco s Tacos  but I mention the interaction as a tip- be prepared to park in the nearby residential area.   The fence is made of wooden branches. This place is nice  family-oriented  warm. Colorful chalk displays. In spite of almost getting in two fights my first time here  I ll probably be back.
Paco's Tacos,318,I just became a member on Yelp so that I can write this review and warn people NOT to come here   We gave this place another shot since it s close to us but we will not be returning  and I frankly don t know how this place is still open.  I wanted to give them no stars but guess that s not an option.  I m not sure how anyone can give this place 5 stars...they must not know what could tacos are or have never eaten at any places on the East side.    The tacos are tiny with no quality at all especially for the price that you pay.  The bean and cheese had no flavor and he Hook  Em  which is supposed to be one of their top tacos  was not good.  Please do your self and favor and try Jalepeno Joe s...it is so much better and cheaper 
Paco's Tacos,319,We love this freaky local Austin dive  Super friendly service - hilarious decor  HUGE fat quesadillas - this is our fave after school snack place. Very chill  very low key - hip before Austin was hip. Good food. Love weekends - always great free music - usually some odd guy belting out songs and talking to us at the same time. Check this place out and ask questions - lots of old Austin stories.
Paco's Tacos,320,My hubby and I drove past this restaurant one night after leaving Blue Starlite drive in and added it to our never ending list of Austin places to try. So glad I did   The migas were the best I ve had yet  service was friendly and the patio is relaxing  Ready to go back for lunch or dinner  
Paco's Tacos,321,On my quest for the ultimate breakfast taco  I made a stop here  and I m so happy they open up at 6 30 am so I can stop here quickly before work  rather than having to wait until the weekend. Highly recommend the migas and add bacon and cheese. Wonderfully priced and super quick service. You can even see the chefs grabbing the tortilla chips to throw onto the stove  so you know it s fresh  Despite the taco being wrapped snugly in aluminum foil  it leaked through the bag and onto my car seat  hence the 4 stars  but other than that I m definitely a fan 
Paco's Tacos,322,Absolutely my favorite taco place in the history of ever. I always bring people with me to spread the love of tacos. Their combination flour corn tortillas are absolutely delicious. Fresh salsas in a variety of flavors to hit every level of spice. I love Paco s and will continue to come every single time I m in Austin.
Paco's Tacos,323,It s alright  nothing really made my taste bud wake up and dance in delight. The tacos are too pricey for my taste. I m a native texan and I can t imagine paying more than 2 dollars for a taco  hello mom  amp  pop taco trucks      I got the carnitas tacos and my boyfriend caught the Pollo Al Mexicana. One taco cost almost 4 dollars  which was way too much. I got a bite of my boyfriend s plate and his chicken didn t stand out either.   I wouldn t go here again unless it s during the lunch special or there s a deal.
Paco's Tacos,324,OK so I know everybody likes this place but it s pretty expensive and it s really not that great.    My wife loves tacos more than anybody I know. We lived on the street and we won t even go here. I think that says it all.    Sorry Paco s
Paco's Tacos,325,Everything is fresh and flavorful. The place has one of those  Austin-y  style it s-my-back-porch-full-of-yard-art decors. The blueberry mimosa was a surprisingly cheap and good buzz at brunch.  The tortillas are kinda bad  but that s par for the course sadly so I don t count off for it. It s a family run place that will actually delivery which is cool.
Paco's Tacos,326,Parking is atrocious  We arrived around 9 00am on a Saturday  and the  tiny  lot had some spots. When we left around 9 45  the lot was full  people were parked alongside the entrance exit to the lot  which caused there to only be enough space for one car to pass through at a time to exit or enter the lot. With that  you could not see any cars who were turning in to the lot  until you were face to face  and one car would have to back up either on to the road  with oncoming traffic  or the other car to back in to the lot to have space for the other car to get through. Talk about a bottle neck situation  And unsafe. And no space. Don t drive a truck up in there.   Now for the food. It s like a less expensive version of Torchy s. I am white  my boyfriend is Mexican. I love Torchy s  he hates Torchy s. I liked the tacos here  he did not. We tried all 4 salsas  only liked the red. He had barbacoa and said it didn t taste like true barbacoa should taste. He also had the carnitas and had the same complaint. I had bacon egg and cheese tacos and thought there were average.  The decor building atmosphere is typical Austin. So it s fun for out-of-townies. Tiny space inside to eat. More space outside to eat when the weather is nice.  Overall  at first I would be willing to come back because my tacos were alright. But when you add in that parking situation  I can guarantee I will never return. I say to you  fellow yelpers  try it once to say you have 
Paco's Tacos,327,Ordered the Bandito Taco  nice tender steak  poblano rajas  beans ok  very good tortilla  good sized taco.  I really like the creamy green sauce from the sauce bar  but it is too delicate for this taco. I just kinda wanted to eat the sauce with a spoon. This is an Austin funky place. Cute and cozy  good food  good price  outside seating-I d come back. With a spoon.
Paco's Tacos,328,This is our go to Mexican restaurant when the entire family gets together for a relatively inexpensive meal. The individual tacos as well as the meals are always good. The outside atmosphere is very good and the grandkids can have a good time playing around. This restaurant is vegetarian friendly. Adults and children alike leave satisfied having had a good and healthy meal.
Paco's Tacos,329,OMG.  Being a Northerner  I can never get over the top fantastic tex-mex. My friend just moved to that area of Austin and she took me there for lunch on a visit this past weekend. First and foremost  the owners were delightful. Very friendly and even gave us free chips and salsa while we waited. The patio was very hip as far as decor goes  but it was entirely too hot to sit outside.   I got the gringo taco  carnitas taco  and the brisket taco. Though all of them were delicious  the carnitas was my favorite. I have always liked the idea of carnitas  but every restaurant back home  in Pittsburgh  misses the mark. Luckily this place did not disappoint and it was easily some of the best I ve had. That may not mean much to you Texans  but it was a pretty life-changing taco for me. The only reason the place is not 5 stars are because of the high prices   5 for one taco    and the long wait.   If and when I come back to Austin  I will surely be back to Pacos 
Paco's Tacos,330,This place is great. They probably have the best Tacos in town  and the environment is amazing. They have cozy little sections set up on the inside of the restaurant for private dining with friends and they have a relaxing outdoor space set up for the more lively crowd.  They have a bubble gum machine that my daughter just loves  and they usually have pennies for it  in case we forget to bring change  The staff here is just wonderful. I can t brag enough about this place.
Paco's Tacos,331,Excellent food  Killer service  Great patio  Everything about Paco s was great. The very helpful young lady at the counter - since it was our first time - lined us right out on our order. And it was AMAZING   Great salsa bar  really nice queso  fresh chips  and super-friendly staff.  Will definitely come again 
Paco's Tacos,332,Hole in the wall with a great crowd and great food and extremely affordable. Breakfast tacos are amazing.
Paco's Tacos,333,A little bit greasy for my taste  but very good and spicy. Good guacamole  too.
Paco's Tacos,334,my mission for breakfast tacos was successful. this funky eccentric junk yard fabulous taco spot makes some alright Austin-style breakfast tacos. minimal waiting time  interesting tasty tortilla  standard toppings and all kinds of salsa and hotness.
Paco's Tacos,335,This is my go-to breakfast place. I work nights at a hospital nearby and it is very convenient that they open early at 0630 so when I get off work I just drive down to this spot. I usually get tacos which are very good and reasonably priced. The coffee is amazing as well and the staff are very friendly.
Paco's Tacos,336,YUM   I m a breakfast taco junkie.  These guys have decent sized breakfast tacos  are very vegetarian friendly  and have good coffee.  I came in hungover and the girl at the counter was really sweet and patient with me     Staff  atmosphere  and food are all a win.  also- ps. Jalapeno salsa reminds me of the dona sauce from Tacodeli- I could eat it with a spoon  hella good.
Paco's Tacos,337,Love this place  It s on my way to work  just near my house. I find myself there at least once a week. For a long time it was only a dinner spot for me. Never let me down. Then I tried them for breakfast  and lunch. Cant go wrong.   If you haven t tried their sliders. You are missing out    My favorites are the  Gringo  and the  La Vieira . The bowls are great too  I usually add one of the taco s toppings to the bowl.    Staff knows me by name  but even before that  they were super friendly  Making jokes  and having fun. I love the evening crew   When Im in a hurry I call in  pick up.   I recommend
Paco's Tacos,338,Can t go wrong with Paco s      They have super awesome tacos and service   A bit more pricey than the little taco trucks on the street  but well worth it    They never give you a skimpy taco. Usually the tacos are so stuffed that I make a mess all over myself trying to eat it    Lol I think my favorite is the gringo  I think that s what it s called  it has shrimp  and mango pico with cabbage.... FREAKIN SCRUMPTIOUS        The atmosphere is nice too   Especially on a sunny day when you can sit outside      love this place     Getting hungry....
Paco's Tacos,339,Small place with amazing food. Staff is always friendly. If you are looking for some great Tex-Mex  I highly recommend this place 
Paco's Tacos,340,I have now been to Paco s Tacos three times for breakfast and love it  I had breakfast tacos  egg  bacon  and cheese  and the bacon gordita-both yummy. They  taste fresh and not greasy. I love that you can order anything on the menu at any time. You have a choice of salsas...I ve had the regular red  poblano cream  and the habanero...all good. I like the outdoor seating and the fact they have mimosas and bloody marys in the am. Great little place not to miss. The staff is very friendly.  Can t wait to try the black and blue sliders next...
Paco's Tacos,341,Second time here- pretty disappointed. The migas were bland  the eggs scrambled like an omelet in the migas and breakfast taco. I ordered an enchilada with the sauce on the side and they threw it on there anyway. Never again 
Paco's Tacos,342,Kristy set my hangover haze straight by doing all of the heavy thinking for me and put me on the path to redemption.  I m a pushover for excellent customer service  but the awesome food is a pretty good reason to check this place out as well.
Paco's Tacos,343,Someone purporting to be the owner of Paco s has contacted me personally through email  complained about my review  expressed shock that I could write such ugly things  said I d made a personal attack  and told me good riddance.   The point of my review was not to cause personal pain  but to observe that customer service here is only just acceptable except for one person who seems rude  condescending  petty  and difficult. The letter telling me good riddance certainly doesn t change my opinion.
Paco's Tacos,344,I don t claim to have any special expertise in the correct execution of tacos  but I likes what I likes.  Everything folks have said concerning the pleasant patio atmosphere  the good service  the unfortunate parking situation  and the reasonable price is still true of Paco s.  Every taco I have had here is sizeable and I am a big fan of their combination corn flour tortillas  which capture a lot of the flavor of the corn and a lot of the fluffier texture of the flour.  Oh  and they are my top choice in town for breakfast tacos  especially the migas  towards which I have developed some addictive feelings  of late.
Paco's Tacos,345,Paco s is alright I guess  but I can t recommend them  hence the  meh  rating .  Paco s simply hasn t improved as much as I have hoped in the 1  years they have been open.  I try to support neighborhood businesses  but Paco s doesn t make that very easy.  Part of their problem is the bar for tacos in Austin is set very high  and despite serving up tasty tacos  Paco s falls flat on several fronts.  Pros   1.  The food is generally very good--particularly the non-breakfast tacos and the gorditas. 2.  The location is convenient  for me .  Cons  1.  Paco s prices are very high.  I went in last week and spent  9 on two tacos.  That s it--two tacos  no drinks  no chips  nothing else   9.  Don t get me wrong  the tacos were good  but I m not aware of any standard-sized taco in this world worth  4.50.  And I love tacos. 2.  Slow service. It takes a long time for Paco s to put together an order.  This  however  can be somewhat alleviated by calling ahead. 3.  Spotty customer service.  I can t put my finger on it exactly  but I never feel very welcome when I m in Paco s.  I think part of it is the lack of eye contact by the staff  the somber mood behind the counter  and the fact that it is clear that if you are a regular  which I am not   you will be given better service than everyone else.  The bottom line for me is that Paco s won t be a first choice  even if it is convenient.
Paco's Tacos,346,You never expect the rudest person to be the owner. This story will blow your mind.  I just had lunch there with a my co-workers. I am severely lactose intolerant and informed the order taker of that and said several times  please be careful to make sure I don t get any butter  milk or cheese.  My order arrived and a good way through my first taco... I saw some white strands. I opened up the taco and dug under the beans and found... cheese. I showed it to the table and they agreed... cheese. I got up and came across a man on the way in that I had guessed was a manager  based on meeting him when we ordered . I told him I had gotten cheese on my taco  that I was lactose intolerant... that I had told the lady who took my order it was a big deal. He took the plate and said he would check it out. Not sure what there is to check out... we could all see the cheese.  So I went back to my seat to look for some medicine in my wallet  which I usually have just in case  but I didn t have any. Sigh. I decided to try the other taco after triple checking it  get something to eat in while I could .   Then he came out and... first denied to me that it was cheese. Yes. He did.   Then  he proceeded to tell me I would have a good day and no problems because it was probably only a teeny bit of cheese. I told him any cheese was bad for me... and that  since he didn t offer  I hoped he would make it right... and cover the taco. I thought that was reasonable as I am writing this note in pain from lactose poisoning.   Guess what  He said he is the owner. Yup.  He declined to buy my taco at first instead arguing I would be just fine and it was nothing. Then he said he could pay for it he guessed but went on about me being fine... anyway after listening to him hassle me  I told him to keep his money and I would not be returning and we were done.   He left. And then... he came back flashing four dollars  tried to put on the table in front of me and put his hand on my shoulder... which was threatening and very uncomfortable to me  It also was very uncomfortable around the table... I declined his money. He said he just wanted me to know I would not have a bad day because of the cheese being such a small amount  it was actually a fair amount . I said I was having a bad day already  because of this rude man who knows nothing about customer service  and that the whole table had a bad experience now because of him.   He walked off and... wait for it... he insulted me  He said if they were having a bad day  it was because of me.  So... 1. His staff made a mistake and served me cheese. Ok. It does happen although it should never happen... what if I had a medical condition that could stop my breathing or something  Good restaurants know to take it seriously.  2. He lied about it being cheese  3. Then he tried to put it on me like I was over exaggerating the issue  4. He confronted me instead of trying to resolve the reasonable problem   5. He put his hands on me  can be assault depending on the circumstance and we were NOT friends at this point   6. He insulted me in front of everyone at my table and everyone else outside who was eating  My opinion is you should avoid this place like the plague and pray if do you go that the owner is not there. I bet he is out business in 3 months.  PS - my co-workers were stunned. It was the worst anyone had ever seen a manager or owner handle a situation. I really thought he might get violent with me.   And yes  I occasionally have a place screw up my meal accidentally putting in cheese or using butter... and if it happens  I am nice  they are usually nice and comp the meal and make it right. I go home and suffer for a few hours and accept that mistakes happen. But this a  hole was no accident. He chose to say and do what he did.
Paco's Tacos,347,My review seems a little harsh but keep in mind I m taking into account price  portion  and taste.   I had the Paco s Pick  Gringo  and for something breakfast like I did the Migas taco.   The Gringo was a little bland.  The shrimp wasn t overcooked which was nice.  But at  4 and some change  I thought it was a little pricey.  The taco was a few bites at best.  Paco s Pick was ok.  Honestly  I thought the flavors were muddled.  Nothing really stood out.  The steak was also a little too chewy. If you asked my what was in it  I would say chewy steak  some sort of melted cheese  and overcooked potato.   4 and some change is a lot to ask I thought.      The migas taco wasn t bad.  The crunch from the tortilla chips was nice.  It had a nice spicey kick to it which I liked.  Plus it was a good size.    I tried all the sauces and all were good.  Nothing that really stands out.  Being in Austin  there are plenty of places with amazing salsa and Paco s was average.   Overall  I was disappointed.  Nothing to write home about.  I would have given the extra star if it wasn t as expensive as it was.  Also  my order took a little long to get to me.    Let me give you a more concise look at their pricing.  If you ordered the Gringo and their Paco s Pick plus a drink that would have been over  10  not including tip.  Believe that isn t enough to fill you.  For  10  I could get some awesome eats for a better price elsewhere.   I didn t try their Sliders but I am curious about them.  I m sure they were good since most orders before me were all sliders.  Interesting....
Paco's Tacos,348,Wow  we were pretty disappointed with our food here. The decor was cute  parking plentiful but the food was like nothing I have had before nor care to ever have again  I had their Migas and I am simply at a loss for words to describe them. Picture a fried egg with a few sprigs of cheese on top and a sprinkling of greasy tortilla strips  yep thats right you could see the grease just smiling right up at you. Their rice was interesting if that is in fact what I was served  the jury is still out on this. My kiddo s meal wasn t much better and we both left shaking our heads and wondering  how they have lasted so long.
Paco's Tacos,349,I guess all us gringos on the East side of 35 near 51st are just so desperate for places to eat that aren t fast food or chain restaurants that we ll get jazzed about any place that has a nice patio and where the primary language spoken is English because this place is way overpriced for the quality and portion size of food they re serving.  Please note I am not being offensive to people or businesses who do not speak English  quite the opposite. My point is that there are several taquerias in the same neighborhood as Paco s Tacos that are serving up much better fare for a much lower price than Paco s  but that some white people may be less inclined to try these places because they are afraid of trying unfamiliar things especially when there may be a communication barrier.  I ve tried the El Flaco  Gringo  Pollo Fajita  as well as a  special . I was disappointed by all but the El Flaco.  A couple of positive things about Paco s  I like that they offer spinach  and that their black beans are vegetarian. This makes going there with friends that don t eat meat convenient. Also  their tortillas are an interesting blend of corn and flour. I also had a create your own breakfast taco that was OK  but you can t really mess that up.  All in all I can t really recommend this place because I don t think the food tastes very good  and it s way too expensive. Also  despite the  Legacy of Paco  listed on their website  I really hate the name and think it is super cheesy.
Paco's Tacos,350,Amazing breakfast tacos  Super cool place to hang out  What else can I say  Going to keep this one short and sweet. Go here  stuff your face with amazing food...
Paco's Tacos,351,Once you find the entrance you won t want to leave  I am a shirt wearing member of TEAM TACO  Paco inspires me  Tacos are life
Paco's Tacos,352,Things I liked     Great outdoor seating area.  It felt comfy and cute and the kind of place I d like to hang out at for a while.  Nice tortillas- they re homemade  and were soft and hot and tasted good.  Things I did not like   It was obvious that two of the people working there were the owners  and they felt more business than genuinely friendly  which sort of rubbed me the wrong way.  Normally I like getting to actually see and interact with the owners of local businesses  but not in this case  really.    Kind of expensive for what we got.  I tried the build your own breakfast tacos and definitely chose bad combinations  which wasn t their fault.  And finally  ONE HORRIBLE THING.  An acquaintance of mine used to work for Paco s and apparently  although they have a separate container for recycling  THEY JUST THROW THE RECYCLING INTO THE DUMPSTER AND DO NOT RECYCLE IT        I m not saying that not recycling is a huge sin  but PRETENDING to recycle and then just throwing it in the trash is a really pathetic thing to do.  And it makes me kind of mad.
Paco's Tacos,353,I ve gone here several times because it is near my house  but not anymore. Frankly  the food is just not good. I feel sick right now from the  migas  I just ate. The eggs at McDonald s are way better than this  and about half the price.  The owners are always there  and are usually loudly complaining about politics  the weather and such. I guess the world owes them something.  Also  the stuffed toy fox hanging by a noose that moves up and down when the door opens and closes is supposed to be considered charming  I suppose.
Paco's Tacos,354,Love this place  a great neighborhood diner...great fresh tacos. Grab you cup of coffee  sit outside and enjoy Austin...
Paco's Tacos,355,I know this is a yelp cliche  but I reallly wanted to like Paco s Tacos. I ve held off for quite a while in writing this review  because I didn t want to give it a less than positive review...but I just can t justify giving more than two stars.   I should note that Paco s gets at least four stars for their wonderful staff and ambiance. Both were warm  friendly  and the patio is one of those great Austin spots that make you want to stay awhile.   The reason Paco s gets two stars and why we probably won t return is the tacos just really aren t that good. And this is Austin  where there is not shortage of great tacos to be found. I got the hook em taco  a barbecue taco topped with cole slaw. It had decent flavor  but the meat was way too fatty. The sauce didn t have a bite at all to it  and the available salsas weren t very exciting. I also had the pollo  and it was bland  bland  bland.   The Sunday beer specials were good  but the bloody mary was just average.   I m no restaurant owner  but it seems like Paco s extensive menu is dragging them down. Tacos  tortas  sliders. enchiladas....it is too much for this type of joint. I wish they would focus on doing a few things really well  rather than doing a lot of things poorly.
Paco's Tacos,356,It is hard for something as simple as tacos to blow my mind.  I am very particular about things being  unique.   Things like tacos must be different  tasty  fresh  and affordable.  Paco s tacos fulfilled all my taco dreams  the tortillas were this amazing blend of half corn half flour  the fillings were hearty and fresh  and a meal for 2 ended up being  17.  The chicken tortilla soup was killer.  It was so rich  and it had lots of bold flavor.  The Big Blue had a crispy blue corn tostado with a black bean spread  carnitas  and some veggies on top.  Simple  but delicious.   To make things even better  the poblano rice is fluffy and flavorful.  The Paco s pick taco was a conglomerate of all things that righteously belong inside a grilled  pressed mass of corn and flour  tender beef strips  egg  and potato.  The Hatch taco was amazing for a non-meat taco.  Tacos NEED meat to be true tacos  but this one still satisfied.  Strips of hatch chile were surrounded by tons of guacamole  black beans  and cheese.  The Longhorn had brisket  a slightly sweet BBQ sauce  and some slaw.  A bit too ambitious.  They should leave sauce and beef up to master smokers.  I would just rather prefer jammin  BBQ or radical tacos  not somewhere in between.  You can go to any Tex-Mex or BBQ franchise for that.  I must mention the amazing customer attention.  The owners come out to chat.  We even got queso for having to wait a little while for our food  not to mention the fact that their version of the normally artificial tasting runny dairy product was delicious.  Paco s is definitely one of the few taco joints I would return to.
Paco's Tacos,357,Best tacos I ve had in Austin.  I won t say who I am comparing them to  because I think that would be tacky.  This place is awesome.  Service is a bit slow  but they seemed really busy.  And talk about friendly   I wanted the lady at the front counter to adopt me.  And if you re vegan or vegetarian  they have a tempeh taco  and it s delicious.  I will be back next time I m in Austin  for sure 
Paco's Tacos,358,I ve gone here three times trying desperately to find something I like. It s right in my neighborhood  my in-laws really like it  and the ambiance is stellar  but  at the end of the day  the food is completely lackluster.   My usual taco choices  bacon potato cheese and migas  were small compared to what I receive at the other three places I regularly go. They weren t hot  either  and the salsas didn t taste like much of anything until I added salt.   Next time I tried a gordita  which was greasy and underseasoned. I thought maybe going in a totally different direction would yield better results  so I gave the Goin  Green Sliders a shot. Dry  cold buns. Flavorless beef  avocado and chiles. I m happy to reheat and reseason  eh  food when the price matches the quality  but those sliders were  8.95 and came only with a small side of cold chips and watery queso.   Plus  in a town like this I don t see how you can not offer a reusable serveware option.   Sadly  the chain across the street offers better value  flavor and environmental consciousness. I won t be going back.
Paco's Tacos,359,I m giving this place 2 stars because the tacos were hot  otherwise they would have gotten 1 star for being open.  We asked about the size of the tacos and quality  the lady behind the counter sated they were regular size but packed fat. As we read the menu my phone was on the counter where the AC dripped on it  it wasn t the only AC vent that leaked on your head. After reviewing their menu we decided on some Barbacoa tacos  a mochas taco and a potato egg and cheese taco.  The Barbacoa was good  extra greasy and it soaked the tortilla till it was soggy. It was the size of a Taco Cabana taco and filled the same  difference is TC doesn t charge  3.25 each and it tasted about the same. It was nothing to return for.  The mug as taco was a joke  they put a hard scrambled egg and smothered it in dry corn tortilla strips. It was to nasty to even finish.  The potato egg and cheese taco was ok  very bland and season less  which if dining in you just add salt but as an on the go at work person eating it as is it was just plain ok.  The atmosphere was stuffy  the counter help was kinda frumpy and the food is very much overpriced for the quality and quantity you get. Not somewhere I will bother stopping again  you can get the same quality and more food going to the cafe in the gas station down the street  not bad  or to TC  eww .
Paco's Tacos,360,I ordered the migas and I ve definitly had better.  It was all just ok.
Paco's Tacos,361,All is forgiven  Paco s Tacos. Not that I was ever really mad at you or anything  just disappointed. BUT NO LONGER   Not only were your tacos the perfect size  but they were some of the tastiest breakfast tacos I ve had in ages. Your tortillas are a work of art.  The owner pulled my husband aside today after he received our order and told him that my previously negative review actually caused them to work on the portion sizes...that s good business  guys. Well done and my apologies for doubting you.
Paco's Tacos,362,Had a bad experience today.  Waited 40 minutes for 3 tacos.  When I went to check on our order after 30 minutes  was told there was a huge order in front of us.  Would have preferred an apology and no excuses.
Paco's Tacos,363,Arrive early and be greeted by one of the owners  who seem to know every regular diner by name . Pair your available-all-day migas with java from Texas Coffee Traders. Linger and ladle at the relish bar until your tortillas are treading hot sauce. There are at least four    different options for salsa  and you can douse the after-burn with ice-cold Topo Chico from the cooler.   Whether dining inside or on the funky patio  you ll have no wobbly walk of shame to the car after a one-too-many tacos moment. Paco s is a guilt-free  corn-wrapped bundle of freshness and spice.
Paco's Tacos,364,Have to say this was just what the dr ordered.  Loved the food...the atmosphere...the owners.   All first class.  Breakfast tacos were delicious.  Home made salsas were freshly made.  Muy Bueno 
Paco's Tacos,365,Yay  Non-GMO corn tortilla option - ask for the Milagros corn tortilla with your taco.
Paco's Tacos,366,My quick take  the salsas were excellent. The main dishes were more or less what you could get at any decent taco place.  This is one of the places that tries to look like a funky roadhouse that s been there since the  50s. Lots of kitschy stuff on the walls. There s a nice area for outdoor seating  it was raining when we went so we ate inside . Indoors is fairly small but there are a few rooms that each have several tables.  We started out with chips and guacamole. Chips didn t taste homemade and weren t warmed up--nothing wrong with them  but I could get the same thing at any store. The guacamole was just plain.  The best thing by far was the salsas. They have a small salsa bar with four or five different selections. On the day I went it was a creamy jalepeno  traditional red  tomatillo  habenero  and maybe another one. The traditional red was very good  vibrant tomato flavor  a nice amount of spice. The habanero was tasty as well.  I had a hatch chili taco and a bean tostada. The taco was  generously  filled and single-wrapped  so it was a bit challenging to eat with your hands. Flavorwise it was pretty good. The tostada was not so great. I didn t care for the refried black beans  which were bland with a slightly  off  taste to me.  I d happily come back for the salsa. The rest  I m not sure.
Paco's Tacos,367,There is plenty of parking in the back and lots of outdoor seating.  I liked the fact that they had a TV inside and outside.  The menu is pretty big.  I was a little overwhelmed with the choices.  In the end  I got  El Gringo  and a Migas Taco.  Several other friends came along  and I want to say at least 3-4 other parties got their food before mine.  We all ordered similar things.  The tacos were a decent size.  A good amount of egg for the Migas Taco.  I wish there were some more tortilla strips.  My biggest prob was that it seemed like the eggs  tortilla strips  etc were all just mushed into my taco.  For the Gringo  the shrimp was not breaded.  They were small shrimp but cooked well.  Nothing wow  but a decent taco.  I thought pricing was a little on the steep side.  My biggest knock is that I saw them grabbing chips out of a bag and onto platters without washing their hands.  Please - either wash your hands or wear gloves . . .
Paco's Tacos,368,I try to support local businesses and wanted to give Paco s one more chance and they failed again for the following reasons  -too expensive for the product you receive. I wanted to try something new so I ordered two EL Flaco Tacos  and a drink for a little more than  8.00.  The tacos very flavorless. -The parking is horrible- especially on weekends. -The staff is not very friendly- but I wouldn t say they were flat out rude but  more like I ll be nice to you because I have to right now.  They get two stars because of location and the decor is cool.  I m sad to say that I won t be giving them another chance
Paco's Tacos,369,My fave spot for comfort food. The zarape is the only burrito on the menu and the BEST     
Paco's Tacos,370,This is definitely one of my favorite taco restaurants. The tacos are super stuffed  I recommend the Gringo and Carnitas but there s so much more to try there. You can t go wrong with what ever you order. Oh  and the staff are always cheerful.
Paco's Tacos,371,Note that I am ONLY rating the breakfast tacos here   Hence the 2 stars  Meh. I ve experienced better  rating.  Oh come on  I have   I can name a dozen places that have better breakfast tacos including... yes  Taco Cabana   If I was rating friendly  fast customer service  definitely they d get 5 stars   Or their very cool atmosphere with a funky patio  whoa  six stars baby   But the breakfast tacos  not bad  just not good.  And what s with those tortillas     Yes  I understand they are fresh made  but they are kinda funky  not a good funky  and don t really have that must taste to them.  Fatten them up for chrissakes   It s a breakfast taco  not a Lean Cuisine   I definitely will be back to try some of the other menu items  but probably not for breakfast tacos   This is a cool place  so I hope it succeeds.  UPDATE   Got a nice note from the owner.  I definitely appreciate them taking the time to respond to customer s comments.   I ve just learned that the tortillas were a 50 50 blend of flour corn  which isn t my preference.  They do offer flour OR corn  so next time I ll know to order mine with the flour.  So because the owner was so nice to write  I ll give them another star.  And I will be back to check out their other menu items  because this is one cool place.   - 
Paco's Tacos,372,I used to be a big Torchy s person  but it spread all over Texas and feels less special now  so I started looking for a new place to take friends and family who visit. Paco s is my new go-to taco place. Their tortillas are great  tacos are cheap  and both the breakfast and lunch menus are quality. I like that you can customize your breakfast taco ingredients  amp  that breakfast is served all day. The ambience is good inside and out - they have a good patio - and you can order online.
Paco's Tacos,373,Pacos is the bomb. I have never had anything here that wasn t great. They are always friendly and helpful as well. The outdoor space is nice in the summer. The indoor space can get a little loud due to the wood floors so I recommend if you see a small child inside  go outside. Their selection of salsas are great and if you re feeling under the weather their tortilla soup is amazing. Only downside is they are closed Monday s
Paco's Tacos,374,This place is a little hard to find but boy was it good. Might be my new spot    it s kind of small but I can deal . I had the gringo and pollo Americana the pollo was a tad bit spicy but it wasn t to bad. The service is so friendly it just made me feel so welcome  so I will be returning.
Paco's Tacos,375,Simple ingredients and legit salsas. Haven t tried their booze but glad they offer and i ll update when I test them out on that. Great veggie chorizo  just wish they offered tofu scramble.
Paco's Tacos,376,Awesome tacos  I get breakfast here every weekend. Call ahead because it gets busy. Pacos pick is my favorite for lunch or dinner.
Paco's Tacos,377,Paco s Tacos are awesome and cheap for a good size filled taco. The choices  they have for tacos are good with a good variety of ingredients in the tacos  such as the Hook Em with smoked Brisket  chipolte BBQ  homemade coleslaw and ciltrano. The brisket is smoked with charred pieces which helps give more of a smoking taste  it is tender and moist. The Carne Guisada taco is tasty  with its flavor gravy  that is spiced just right  not too greasy or water. The beef tips were moist and tender and nice big chunks too. Also in the Carne Guisada taco was pico de gallo  which was diced with the right veggies  onions  jalapenos  and tomatoes.  I like the fact that you can build your own taco with as many ingredients as you like  and for the extra ingredients they are only  .35 cents  That is pretty cheap  because most places charge  .50 for extra ingredients. For my own taco  I had Eggs  potatoes  bacon and peppers. The potatoes are nice and chunky  the way potatoes should be in a breakfast taco  the bacon is greasy and crisp too its chopped into small strips so you get a bite of bacon throughout the taco. For the peppers  they are sliced and mixed in with the eggs  it gave the taco some good spiceness and it was a full size taco where the ingredients were falling out   The queso is ok  its a bit watery and doesn t have much flavor. I wish that Paco s would add more spices to the queso to give it more flavor. So Paco s if you read this can you make an adjustment to the queso where its more flavor    Overall the breakfast tacos here are awesome and tasty with lots of ingredients to choose from to build your own tacos with a really good price and are filling too  You can t go wrong here.
Paco's Tacos,378,I live very close to Paco s and it is a regular go-to. The tacos are creative  delicious and freshly prepared. I have also had their sliders  which I liked less - but they are still decent.  My only complaint is that the service can be slow - sometimes very slow - and not just when its busy. In fact  sometimes the service has been the slowest when there isn t anyone else there. Kind of off. Also they ve given me the wrong thing a few times. That said  the owners are usually on the premises are are pretty quick to fix mistakes - and the food is usually so good I don t care much about the service.
Paco's Tacos,379,I have been here twice now. When I get off of work in the morning  that ll make three   I ve only had the tacos. The first time  I had the El Flaco. That was pretty decent. I say decent because I ve had much better  I mean  this is Austin. There is no shortage of taco places. This one just happens to be close to my job  they open at 0630  and serve mimosas that early  Don t know about the other alcoholic beverages but after a long night of work  a blueberry mimosa  AKA Code Blue  we came up with the name  order it that way - they ll know what you re talking about  is the perfect  night-cap.   The second time  I customized my tacos. Not much to mess up there.   I will definitely be back here but not for the mediocre food. It s the Code Blues that call my name 
Paco's Tacos,380,Paco s is located on 51st st.   Lancaster  near the Home Depot . In addition to inside seating they have a large outdoor area  and some tables have umbrellas. The decor is really casual with multi-colored table cloths and vintage product signage.   The staff have always been very personable. Even when this place gets busy around lunchtime they keep calm. I ve been given free chips and queso when our order has taken awhile. The one time I had a problem with my order they were more than happy to fix it to my satisfaction. Again  really good staff.  Their menu is big and includes build-your-own breakfast tacos  specialty tacos  sliders  queso and other items traditionally found on a tex-mex menu. Try the Gringo taco  shrimp  mango pico  avocado   the El Flaco  egg  amp  veggies   the Cece s Pescado  fish taco  or the Queso Compuesto  cheese  guac  amp  pico . All are highly recommended. They also make their own salsas  5 of them   the last 2 pack some serious heat  to a gringo .  There are daily lunch specials and a beer happy hour. The ice bath cooler keeps  em real cold. Sunday is all day  2 bloody mary s and mimosas  try the  blue-mosa  for sure .   There are only 2 drawbacks to this place  1  the parking lot is small and can bottle-neck at the entrance. 2  they re closed on Mondays but hey  you have to give the staff a day off right   yes  the answer is yes   Paco s Tacos  another great  little  locally-owned food spot east of I-35.
Paco's Tacos,381,Oh  Paco s.....where do i begin   The family owned vibe is warm and fuzzy. The people who own this joint are clearly passionate about their establishment. The food is CONSISTENTLY fantastic. The salsa selection is broad and on point. I love their mismatched coffee cups  i love how clean they keep their eating area. This is going to be a longtime haunt for us  I see it clearly. Thank you   Paco s.
Paco's Tacos,382,Sigh. I really wanted to like this place. REALLY I DID   The staff was super friendly  the decor is wonderful.  But it stops there. The tacos are SKIMPY   My Migas taco was only blue corn tortillas and egg. Where s the other stuff folks  I need some onion  tomato and jalapeno   Tortilla and egg a miga taco that does not make. There was a few bits here and there  but the taco was so small I couldn t tell. I also asked for migas with cheese  but the cheese was forgotten. Or maybe it was there but had melted away   Also ordered a chicken gordita  for 3.75. For the price and description in the menu  I would expect a pretty good sized gordita. TINY  Probably worth 2 bucks at best   1 dollar at happy hour. I wish I had taken a pic so you could see it  but two bites and it was gone.  The tacos were bland   One Star for the good green sour creamish salsa.  I want this place to succeed  Please revamp your menu. If you want to charge that much for food it has to be WORTHY  Do something different than what we would expect at a taco stand. I enjoy the blue corn tortillas but make it a tasty taco.  I hope to visit again soon and UPDATE my review    
Paco's Tacos,383,I went today with a few friends and sat outside to enjoy some of the beautiful weather.  We all ordered separately but I was the last to order.  First order came out pretty quick  next order a bit slower  and then slower and slower  until I was the last one.  All my friends were done with their meals and I still hadn t gotten my food.  I probably waited a good 35-40 minutes for my food.    The taco s themselves were good.  I got the Cece s pescado taco and the Carne asada Taco.  I wish the fish taco had more fish and less rice though.  The carne asada taco was good but just missing something to put it over the top.    The seating area outside was really nice.  They had some nice decor with vintage ads and other art.  I have to say that for me  Torchy s is still the king of Taco s in Austin.  After they work out some of the kinks and speed up their production I think Paco s will definitely earn one more star.
Paco's Tacos,384,Awesome local taco joint that is definitely worth the visit. They re tacos are way better than Torchy s and way cheaper    There is so much character in this place that the ambiance and quaint corners are half the reason why we eat here often.  JK...we eat here because the food is delicious and the staff is SO KIND...I read something about the parking being an issue...we have never found a busy parking spot  but we usually go for Breakfast and or Dinner - so I do not know what the lunch rush is   These tacos are made from the heart and you can tell...enjoy 
Paco's Tacos,385,Paco s is one of my favorite places in Austin. What started as an occasional lunch spot for me has become a weekly stop for breakfast and bottomless coffee to get me through studying for law school.  This is a friendly neighborhood place that is run by an Austin family. They always remember my name when I go in  and they never fail to show some attention to how I am doing  particularly during the worst weeks of law school studying.  Paco s Big Man is my staple breakfast --two over-easy eggs served over potatoes  beans  peppers  beans  cheese  bacon and ranchero sauce. The pile of food sits atop a big flour tortilla. I always have mine with a some of the house habanero and poblano cream salsa. It s a filling and delicious way to start the day. The eggs come runny  which is fine by me. If you would like them any other way  just be sure to ask. They ll take care of you.  Their carnitas tacos are my lunch staple. They are very flavorful--slightly fatty but not greasy-- and served on Paco s special blend tortillas  which are a mix of corn and flour. They have a honey habanero salsa that goes great with the pork  but it isn t always on the salsa bar. Just be sure to ask for some  Be warned. It is very spicy  so use it carefully.
Paco's Tacos,386,Great little  not so little anymore  taco joint in East Austin  We ve been waiting for a place like this since Nomad doesn t  really  do food. Perfect for brunch  to hang out  have a beer mimosa  and a breakfast taco or two.   To echo a few other folks  we went here during lunch  and the parking lot was like a tetris puzzle. 5 cars trying to get in  and 3 cars  one being a MASSIVE Ford F-250  trying to get out... uhhhh. Some creative reversing  and we were able to find a spot to park. Not sure where there would be additional parking  though  if this place were packed.   It is definitely more Tex-Mex than Mex  but it fits the bill. Prices are reasonable  and the food is delish 
Paco's Tacos,387,Besides the AMAZING atmosphere and ambiance  Ms Abbey and Margaret put a giant bow on the experience   The food is fantastic...had breakfast tacos.  If you don t visit when you are in Austin  shame on you 
Paco's Tacos,388,I am starting with three stars because there were a few things like noise and it seeming to be a little hectic with the ordering process and the kitchen area  but everything was correct with our order and the food came out quickly so maybe that s just how they roll...better under pressure   I have no doubt my next visit will make me want to update this to four stars.   We had chips and salsa  I don t like paying for those  by the way  which was surprisingly spot on  is it bad that I was worried since white people were taking my order and my usual taco place rarely has anyone speaking English    We also tried out their bloody mary which is very tasty. I am a bloody mary snob    We had an assortment of tacos and gorditas....all of which were devoured. I love the tortillas. They re a mixture of corn and flour....not too thin...not too thick...just right.   Everything was very yummy....it s a cute building and they have a nice outdoor area for people to hang out and kids to have some moving room. The inside is pretty cramped  but they ve made good use of what room there is.   I will definitely be back here.
Paco's Tacos,389,Stormed into pacos as soon as I realized it was open. Yummy.   I would like 5 more migas tacos  please.
Paco's Tacos,390,First the good  the atmosphere is terrific. I loved the patio with the band of hippies  or hipsters  I couldn t quite tell  having a jam session. Totally cool. The staff were extremely friendly  and it was obviously a family affair  I m pretty sure a pre-teen gave us our chips and salsa . Lots of young girls  probably not all family. All enthusiastic.  The food was . . . ok  for the most part. My zarape burrito was different - not wrapped up like I expect burritos to be  open at the top. The chicken had a bit of a char I did not care for  but I liked that the spinach was obviously fresh and the sauce had a nice kick to it. I liked the taste of the salsa too.  My bf got something that had  pollo  and  mexicano  in the name - some kind of plate. He did not care for it. He thought the chicken was a bit fatty and rubbery  and the rest was mostly bland. I did not try it  so cannot comment.  Our consensus was  cool atmosphere  friendly service  obviously trying hard  but the food needs some additional development. We will go back to try the breakfast tacos  because it s near our  hood and we believe in trying a place more than once. Plus it really does have a cool atmosphere.
Paco's Tacos,391,Awesome. Just awesome. A a tasty  friendly place to walk into after you ve gotten off a 12 hour night shift.  they re open for lunch and dinner as well   Its an adorable little old house with a very friendly and accommodating lady that takes your order  wish I knew her name   and a few cooks in the back that you can see assembling your order.  The tacos are made with some of the best homemade tortillas I ve had  You can pick and choose what items you want in them many options to choose from. The chips and queso are awesome because it isn t just a plain bowl of cheese  and their poblano rice is great as well. And the price is right  to boot 
Paco's Tacos,392,Pacos       I love your carnitas tacos  but why do you make it so hard to park  Since the parking lot tends to fill up fast  a lot of times I m forced to go somewhere else as there is no where to park. If I m lucky enough to get a parking spot it becomes quite scary when leaving as the brick wall you constructed around the garden blocks the line of sight of oncoming traffic.   Please change this so you can get more of my money.and than I will give you 5 stars.   Sincerely     A fan.  P.S. Your staff is amazing 
Paco's Tacos,393,Scallop and Mango tacos  need I say more  This place beats Torchy s Taco s any and every day of the week on taste  price  and ambiance.   Recommend Paco s Pick  Hook em  and La Vieira.
Paco's Tacos,394,Usually  I don t give a rip about family run businesses.  I just want the food to be good.  Pacos Tacos hasn t changed that. But.  It IS fun to watch this family at work.  Dad in the kitchen  mom checking the tickets also in the kitchen  and the middle school-age girl running the cash register  playing service industry on the weekends.  Also  the tacos are good.
Paco's Tacos,395,Paco s is hit or miss. Sometimes the tacos are amazing  the gringo  and other times they are soggy unflavorful. Especially the mushroom and spinach quesadilla  sooooo soggy. If you have issues with textures  do not get anything that has spinach in it. It will be soggy. The chicken can be fatty at times and the brisket can be really dry.   A bit over priced for what you get. Expect to spend around  10-15 dollars for lunch.      Defiantly don t go during lunch if you have time constraints. It takes at least 30 mins to get your food.   The owners are really nice people and the staff is usually really helpful and friendly.
Paco's Tacos,396,Genuine local vibe. No bells and whistles  but if you re looking for quality food and service this is your place. Bubba is awesome. Have a beer and chat with him. Cheers
Paco's Tacos,397,First time here   It was amazing the corn flour tortilla was good and the breakfast tacos made me cry 
Paco's Tacos,398,Place won t disappoint  Visiting daughter in Houston  Tacos are big and have plenty of filling of your choice 
Paco's Tacos,399,Wow  Tasty and filling. First visit was impressive. Not crowded   11 45am. Has that relaxed and cool Austin  feel.  Lunch was  12 including tip but worth the change of pace. Tired of the same eateries in the area. Hey  Skip the Mueller Project and eat at Paco s. Try the many salsa s also. I ll be back
Paco's Tacos,400,I lived in 78704 for about 12 years and was spoiled with the abundance of great breakfast taco options in that area. I m in Hyde Park now though  and driving 6  miles through the middle of Central Austin for a breakfast taco seems kind of silly ... time to build a new breakfast taco circuit.  Paco is to the Central University area what Maria is to the  04. The vibe and decor are similar --  funky  kind of kitschy -- but the food is better and it wasn t a complete madhouse on a Sunday morning. Everyone working was extremely friendly and helpful  they greeted several regulars by first name in the short time we spent inside placing our order. The outdoor seating was pleasant  we easily could have lingered drinking  2 mimosas or bloody mary s if we didn t have errands to run.   We ordered some basic tacos  migas  potato egg bacon  egg ham cheese  sausage egg cheese and mushroom egg cheese. All came out in less than five minutes and piping hot. I wouldn t say the special corn flour tortillas tasted particularly better than the traditional versions  but I was a fan of the texture. We tried four types of salsas -- the standard red salsa  the arbol salsa  the poblano cream and a creamy green salsa. All were very good.    Another plus  decent coffee. Good breakfast tacos and good coffee in one restaurant are all too often mutually exclusive.  I was super tempted to try the chilaquiles  under 5 bucks     but the boyfriend said we should measure a taco joint by its tacos. Really  if a place can t get a breakfast taco right  what s the point    I ll consider upgrading to 5 stars if lunch items measure up to my first visit. I m looking forward to going back a lot and eating my way through the menu.
Paco's Tacos,401,What a great find  I am a breakfast taco enthusiast  and this joint is in my top 3  which is pretty darn good for ATX     It s family owned  and they are precious. I love a good mom and pop spot with friendly service and delicious food to boot    In my opinion  it s hard to mess up a breakfast taco  but SALSA is another story. This place has so many salsa options  it s amazing. I go in once a week and buy their creamy jalapeno salsa to use on my homemade concoctions. It s equivalent to Taco Deli s Salsa Dona  but less    . Don t let it go unused for too long .. There aren t any preservatives and it only lasts about a week.
Paco's Tacos,402,Does Paco s have the best food  Nope  However  they deliver-which is a big game changer for me. I haven t been disappointed with anything I ve ordered  they have a nice selection of salsas.
Paco's Tacos,403,We love this place  Most of the staff is so friendly  can t do enough to help you. My daughter and I get the sliders and queso   sooo delicious   My other daughter loves the mushrooms and spinach quesadilla.  and they have big red fountain drinks   Yummy  You can also bring your dog and sit on the patio  the staff will bring you a bowl of water and a dog treat  I definitely recommend     I also always bring my out of state guest here  and they always love it too  
Paco's Tacos,404,Delicious   Friendly staff  unique decor  a definite Austin  vibe   and did I mention the amazing food     LOVED it 
Paco's Tacos,405,I ordered takeout through their website and my tacos were hot and ready when I picked them up. The quality of the tacos was just fine. I much preferred the flour tortilla to their corn-flour mix variety. The tacos were filled to the brim  but those insides were pretty bland. My main complaint is that the egg in the breakfast tacos was cooked to the point of being chewy. The tortilla strips in the migas also tasted a bit stale. The saving grace for me was the bacon  which was thick and flavorful. I also tried three of the salsas and they were also nothing to write home about. While the service was friendly and online ordering convenient  the food doesn t stand out among Austin s saturated taco scene.
Paco's Tacos,406,I was staying at the Marriott nearby and needed lunch bad. Yelp pointed me in Paco s direction so I walked over and glad I did. The prices are fair and the restaurant eclectic fun. There s a patio that I m sure gets tons of use during the warmer weather. Inside you order at the counter and sit where you d like. I got 2 breakfast tacos  served all day  and they were both delicious. Egg  cheese  potatoes and egg  cheese  black beans. Both tacos stuffed the tortilla full so I got plenty of food. Everyone was nice and the place is unassuming. If I m ever in that part of Austin again I ll be sure to come back.
Paco's Tacos,407,I ve been on a treck with a friend trying some of the best taco places in Austin that are all on the lists. Hands down would like to say these were the best tacos I ve ever had. I had the Flaco  and the pollo. They re all huge  come out blazing hot  tortillas are fresh and unique and the salsas are on point. Before we went to Paco s  we went to Tyson s and no comparison. This place blows away any taco establishment I ve been to in Austin. I was enjoying every bite.
Paco's Tacos,408,This place is great  once you find it. And once they get their service processes down  which I m sure they will with time   I ll up this to 5 stars.  The tacos are fantastic. I m not going to say they re the best  because--let s face it--this town has a multitude of places serving up righteous tacos  so it s hard to pick a best. But these are up at the top. Both their delicious flour corn tortilla blend and the creative and tasty filling combinations help them to carve out their niche amongst the taco crowd.  The atmosphere is nice out on the patio or inside the casa  and the owners are friendly. I look forward to when they get their wine  amp  beer license as the patio would make for a good happy hour spot near the Mueller development. In the meantime  look for this place on E. 51st  across from the Children s hospital  and try it out for breakfast or lunch.
Paco's Tacos,409,Ok so I am a fan of cheap and tacos  and this place NAILS both. The tacos here are awesome. The place is small and basically like a house  and when I was there  there was only one other guy picking up a to-go order  and two people sitting at another table.  You walk in and immediately order at the front  no menus to look at  just the chalkboard style  and then they bring you your food and any additional sauce you may want. I recommend the tomatillo   The green one   This place is great  if you are in the area and want taco s I d go here  there are definitely better taco s out there  but this place will definitely take care of your taco needs 
Paco's Tacos,410,We moved back to Austin recently and we resolved to support local or Texas based businesses. We got a Morgan s Deals promo for Paco s Tacos and we ordered an extravagant variety of tacos to go.  Upon arriving  I noticed the cool  rustic feel of the patio seating. We will definitely have to go back for tacos and beers to soak up some of that fabulous vibe.  Each taco we sampled dazzled us. The shrimp was lightly seasoned and grilled to perfection. The brisket may be some of the best I ve ever tasted. The overall winner was the moist  succulent barbacoa. Each taco we ordered was simply  elegantly delicious.  Their queso dip appetizer is made of a scrumptious blend of cheeses and their tortilla chips are light and crispy yet strong enough to hold each of their fresh-tasting salsas.  The smoky  earthy poblano cream won my taste test.   The family who owns Paco s charm the customers with their attention to detail. Their casual banter with the regulars impressed me and I was blown away by the owner s salsa pairing suggestions.   You ordered the barbacoa  right  Try the batch of honey-habanero I whipped up this morning.     Update. My 4 year old daughter had a routine appointment at Dell Children s MC  across the street from Paco s convenient location  yesterday so my wife and I took her out for her favorite  fish tacos  which were sublimely mequite-grilled. I also tried the hatch taco with chicken. Their fresh guacamole and pico de gallo perfectly complimented the moderately spicy hatch chiles.  We are picky about which restaurants we choose and will definitely continue supporting Paco s Tacos.
Paco's Tacos,411,The tortillas are pretty good  they have more of a buttery taste to them  not so much of the flour typical taste. I got a barbacoa taco  amp  sausage and egg taco. I didn t like the sausage and egg since it s not country sausage. But the barbacoa is pretty good  really greasy  but tasty  The green salsa and habanero salsa is delicious  It s a pretty cool spot to bring your dogs and have a good taco.
Paco's Tacos,412,This place us excellent. I m not a huge fan of Mexican food but this us absolutely amazing. The queso doesn t taste cheap and the enchiladas are my favorite of all time. Brownies are home made and have some weight to them. They also serve beer   
Paco's Tacos,413,I had the Migas today and they were exceptional   Just the right combination of ingredients  and the rice tasted just right. Definitely going back 
Paco's Tacos,414,Paco s is a great taco spot.  Every time I have a guest in town I have to take them in for breakfast or lunch.  The Paco Pollo is where it s at.  The tacos are very delicious and the service is super prompt.  Hopefully the new Torchy s next door doesn t hurt their sales too much.
Paco's Tacos,415,I ve only had the breakfast tacos here  and I must say that I have definitely enjoyed them. They re very flavorful  and they have a wide range of options for vegetarians. I agree that the tortillas are not the best I have ever had  but they re just as good as your average unauthentic Mexican restaurant.  However  I do have a couple qualms about this place. After 11am  breakfast tacos become more expensive. Honestly  I can t understand this practice. If it s a massive headache to make breakfast tacos after 11am  just stop serving them. I also am not super enthused that everything is made with disposable goods. There are few restaurants in town that still use styrofoam  and  unfortunately  Paco s is one of them. It s time we move on from the 80s and 90s.   To add one more good point following a couple negatives  the staff are all very kind and helpful. Even when they re swamped with business  they never seem bothered.
Paco's Tacos,416,Great homey atmosphere  excellent and friendly service  and the best tacos in Austin hands down. What more could you ask from a Taco shop     P.S.The Gringo taco is a must. Just do it.
Paco's Tacos,417,I ll be specific b c maybe it was just our choices but the veggie chorizo is AWFUL dry bacon bits type stuff  stay away. Secondly  my black bean and cheese had zero taste. How can black beans have no flavor  I dunno. tamale house was never anything to write home about  except their prices but I m so sad this place is so meh. My friend s egg taco choices were meh too. Sorry  but hopefully they ll add some salt or bay leaves or something to the cooking process. Mexican food is simple  but geez a little seasoning.
Paco's Tacos,418,There shrimp tacos are delcious  The new portebello taco was not that great. My family enjoyed their tacos  but they were full of grease. I love how unique the place is inside and out. I enjoyed myself  and I see myself returning in the future.
Paco's Tacos,419,i just got home from my 2nd visit to paco s and oh how things have changed. The main thing is the price  looking over the menu I took during my first visit some items are a dollar or 2 more. It even looks like their website can t keep up with the ever increasing prices.   The tacos were still really good  however the rice was a little overdone in my chicken taco. I just can t see myself paying  4  for a taco
Paco's Tacos,420,Finally got to stop and check one of the famous neighborhood taco places  Paco s Tacos   Had the Hook em  brisket  the Gringo  shrimp . and some rice  all really good  excellent hot sauces as well  and an ice cold Shiner Ruby Redbird  I am a happy man 
Paco's Tacos,421,Visited this spot for the first time today. The queso was pretty good but the chips were all broken  I hate that. I ordered the Paco Pick and the Bandit tacos. Both were very good choses  simple yet satisfying. Very old school tex-mex style food  homemade tortillas  homemade beans. The outdoor patio area looked nice and shaded but was just too hot to sit outside. Inside was a bit cramped and gave the feel that this really isn t a sit inside kind of place. I will certainly come back and I hear the breakfast tacos are great.
Paco's Tacos,422,These are the most delicious taco s in all of Austin. I am extremely picky when it comes to any type of Mexican food  but I cannot rave enough about this place  I highly recommend  Paco s Big man burrito. So delicious    
Paco's Tacos,423,I drove by probably 15 times before deciding to stop in and I regret each and every time  Pacos is now a weekly stop  at least  and my favorite thing is their mix and match sliders. Great atmosphere  good food  friendly staff and good drink specials  definitely stop in if you are thinking about it.
Paco's Tacos,424,We tried a couple tacos  the chilaquiles  and the migas  and they were all incredibly bland. I don t think I ve ever had such tasteless blah Tex-Mex in Austin  and we were all incredibly disappointed. There are plenty of inexpensive  tasty options in town  and I can t imagine ever choosing this place.
Paco's Tacos,425,As most Austinites do  I take tacos fairly seriously  and having said that  this place is legit. Everything we ordered was crazy yummy  The building is a little old house with fun decorations both inside and in the front yard where you can also eat. I d caution weekend visits in bad weather because it is completely packed if people can t sit outside  this may apply on week days at lunch too  I haven t been by to confirm. You ve got to try this place  I don t think you will be disappointed 
Paco's Tacos,426,Of all the taco places we visited in Austin on a recent visit  this was my favorite.  Not only were the tacos excellent but the ambiance of the interior as well as the outside courtyard was unique  comfortable and visually appealing.  Order the fish taco with slaw 
Paco's Tacos,427,Great tacos  Different types and all delicious  I had the Hook  Em and Cece s this past trip and I really enjoyed them  I really like the coleslaw on the tacos . The only negative was the space. Parking is really tight and seating is not vary spacious. Other than that it was great 
Paco's Tacos,428,TACOS  ... taco taco taco..  Went here on a whim one night only because I drive past this place on my way to work every day and.. I mean.. how can you NOT want to try this place  I feel like a moth drawn to the lights.   I thought  because of said lights  it might be a bit cheesy or mexican restaurant-ey with beer banners and pinatas all over the walls. We walked in and the guy at the counter immediately starts chatting with us. We re trying to decide what to get while he s joking with us. I thought the prices were really reasonable. None of the dinner entree prices was over  10. Some of the individual tacos seemed a slight bit on the pricey side  but all the ones I tried were SO GOOD  it was totally worth it. And a scallop taco  Yeah  that s going to cost a little more than your usual taco. The brisket taco was the BEST brisket meat in general taco EVER.   Everybodys food was excellent and the building and all the rooms are super cute and cozy. The guy who took our order was super friendly and really personable. Somehow it became an inside joke for him to dance for us  so as we each ordered  he did a little dance. It was fantastic.  o   Especially since this place is only 5 min away from my house  I will definitely be frequenting here more often. I look forward to sitting outside when the weather gets warmer and nomming tacos galore. Why do I not have more money   
Paco's Tacos,429,PROS  really good food. Lots of options for your tacos. Coffee is decent. Place is clean. Children friendly  dog friendly. Quick service. Smiling waiters. Salsa bar.  CONS  parking lot is tight  and not big enough. Tacos are not as stuffed as they make you think. If you normally get full with 2  order 3.  Not very Mexican. I am Mexican. Oilcloth was the only Mexican thing I found. And maybe the cooks are Mexican.
Paco's Tacos,430,My friend and I stumbled upon Paco s Tacos upon his return from NYC - how better to reintegrate into Austin culture than with a couple of tacos  Cute decor and certainly plenty of parking  which is a perk.  From the extensive menu we both ordered a Hatch taco and a fish taco plus a free Jarritos for checking in on Yelp. The prices were a little high considering the location  but taco prices in Austin have been on the rise so it s no big surprise.  The Hatch taco was pretty good  piled with black beans  Hatch chiles  and guacamole. Wish I d tried the Hatch with the optional grilled shrimp. My fish taco left me a little less than satisfied - the rice was sort of mushy and the fish wasn t as crispy as I usually like it. The salsa bar had some yummy options ranging from mild to super spicy habanero.  I ll probably return for the Hatch if I m ever in the neighborhood  otherwise I ll stick to Maria s Taco Xpress and the Baja Shrimp at Torchy s.
Paco's Tacos,431,I feel like I ve been to almost every taco place in Austin. That being said  I ll take paco s over torchy s and or taco deli any day.
Paco's Tacos,432,They catered my wedding and the food was delicious  Margaret was a joy to work with and everything went as smooth as anyone could hope. Pricing was very reasonable. Highly recommend for any event 
Paco's Tacos,433,If the previous reviews weren t spot on about the decor and friendliness of the staff  I would have thought I was eating at a different place. I went twice for lunch  and was very underwhelmed each time. I do not like their rice at all  I think it has a weird texture and taste. I got Carne guisada first visit  it was tender but not much flavor. I had to use a lot of little containers of the salsas to help it out. Next time  to give it a fair chance  I ordered Picadillo plate. Worst I have ever had  and I have eaten a lot of Picadillo. It comes already wrapped in a tortilla which I did not like because it made the lettuce they put in there soggy. The worst part was the carrots they put in it. I have never had carrots in Picadillo  and they were at least equal to the meat. Sorry  just dont get the great reviews.
Paco's Tacos,434,So far loving this place walked in i love the decor  seems like a family operated business... comfortable as well lets see how my tacos are. Ordered big man i believe and normal bacon egg and cheese. Plan on coming back in future for breakfast lunch or dinner to eat on patio.. place is a hidden gem  
Paco's Tacos,435,cannot say enough about the friendly staff or the great food choices.  Beer is limited  but you don t really care.  You want the fish taco or the breakfast taco or the beef taco.  You cannot go wrong.
Paco's Tacos,436,Try the migas breakfast taco with bacon. It s got great crunch that contrasts the soft eggs and the salty bacon. I also had chorizo with eggs and avocado. That was pretty good too  but next time I might add black beans. It was delicious  fresh  and hot  and I will definitely come back.
Paco's Tacos,437,So I went for the breakfast tacos  and I d have to say this place was very  meh  for me.  Everyone seems to LOOOOOOVE the decor and thinks it s very  Austin   which means  Hip  or  Cool    but to me it just looked silly.  It s like a flea market threw up all over the place.  I ordered a bean  egg and chese taco which I found to be very bland and a huge disappointment.  On the flip side  I also got a chorizo  egg and avocado taco which was pretty darn tasty   I think the problem is the refried beans are too bland for my taste.  Also they boast a  Salsa bar  which has a variety for you to choose from  but the stardard red wasn t very good.  It wasn t awful  it just tasted like something I could get from a jar at HEB for  2.99.  The coffee sucked.  I don t know if someone added too much water to the pot or what  but it made me feel like I was at work  complete with styrofoam cup  .  I will try this place again  because people rave about the migas and the lunch menu looked like it had some choice items as well.  But I can t lie  Paco s just isn t as good as I wanted it to be.
Paco's Tacos,438,For a quickie breakfast  I wanted breakfast tacos one Saturday morning and had a few places to choose from  but I decided to swing by Paco s tacos especially since I live right in the neighborhood and have never gone.    The menu was very easy and told me exactly what to expect.  The location is a bit  easy to miss  if you re not familiar with the area  but I loved the outside patio area.  Wish there was more seating though.  The staff was very friendly and really made me feel like a  regular  even though it was my first visit.  Now the food.....  I only ordered individual breakfast tacos  2 egg chorizo and 1 potato egg cheese.  Since it was my first visit I decided to go with the basics.  The wait wasn t long and condiments were readily available.  As most have already mentioned  the price on these items are little higher than what I was used to.  And for the price I was a little disappointed in the portion size.  The potato egg cheese taco was great   It had an even portion of each ingredient and the cheese was especially good.  I m guessing maybe a White American cheese  but I ll have to double check.    The chorizo egg was  ok .  I definitely had more egg than chorizo.  However  I can appreciate not having grease all over my hands which is usually the case when I order chorizo eggs anywhere else.  The flour corn tortillas saved it for me.  It was different that anything I d tasted and made the tacos special.  Overall....  I dig the place but will definitely need to go there again to find a dish I can really brag about.  I m thinking a nice Saturday afternoon when the weather is warmer so I can take advantage of the patio.  I may even ride my bike there but now that I think about it  not sure I saw any bike racks.  Something to investigate.
Paco's Tacos,439,Slightly higher prices than most of the taco joints in the area  but I don t mind paying a little more for quality.    Also any place that offers black beans is a good place in my book.    I wouldn t say they are the best taco place in town  but if you are up in this hood  it s worth a stop in to check them out.  Even though they are right on 51st street they did a nice job fencing in the lot to make it a little more private feeling.
Paco's Tacos,440,I ve been here many times and have enjoyed each visit. I took my picky eater brother one day during a rush. They were more than accommodating to make him a plate off the menu. Very impressive customer service  the atmosphere is welcoming no matter which room or area of the courtyard that you choose. Get lucky sometimes abs catch live music with some of the best tex mex Austin has to offer.
Paco's Tacos,441,Cool old house on E 51st street has been transformed into a taco making wonderland.  Their hybrid flour corn tortilla is a unique and delightful experience.   The hatch green chile taco was very tasty and delicious  with a large green chile  black beans  avocado  cheese and more on their signature tortilla.  The breakfast bacon  egg  cheese and potato taco was one of the best in town with the bacon diced and mixed into the egg  instead of just a strip laid down next to egg  for well distributed deliciousness.  Toss in a Mexican Coke and you re good to go.  Also  the owner has remembered me every time I ve been there and is really nice.  Go Paco s     I just need to make it by for lunch or dinner sometime.
Paco's Tacos,442,I wish I could give 3.5  I was going to average up to a 4 until I had the dessert. The key lime cheesecake was the worst. I rarely diss a dessert  but this one lacked any tartness from a key lime and had a compacted almost jello consistency.  Now the good was they use fresh ingredients. Nice crunchy iceberg. Good chopped tomatoes. Wonderful pork in either a gordita or taco. I will go back for the freshness.  The place has a great funky vibe. Great friendly staff.   Just don t get that 1 star dessert- otherwise I would have averaged up on the 3.5 to a 4 instead of going down to a 3.
Paco's Tacos,443,Awesome breakfast tacos   The corn flour tortilla mixture is awesome  great ingredients  the options are limitless. Sad that I was only in town for a weekend  would have loved to try a few more combinations of meats and toppings. Why are there not more breakfast taco places everywhere  
Paco's Tacos,444,We were visiting Austin and while on the way to another restaurant  we passed this place and thought it looked interesting so we stopped to check it out. The good  The have a ton of selection and several of their tacos are vegetarian. They also have several bottled beers to select from at a fair price. The bad  The tacos are about 5 bucks each and all three that I ordered were mostly full of rice. They tacos are also fairly small which wouldn t be a problem if they were  3 each but for  5 I don t expect to have to order 3 of them to fill up. Id still recommend this place though. I was not disappointed. The staff was really friendly  amp  the decor is interesting.
Paco's Tacos,445,Pretty good tacos but they aren t very big. You absolutely need to order at least two. Tacos seem to cost around four bucks  so it isn t cheap when you consider that your need two or three.
Paco's Tacos,446,Love this place  open all the time  great friendly faces  pleasant atmosphere and quick  affordable  and filling. Fulfills every desire for a convenient local breakfast or taco joint
Paco's Tacos,447,I am a small business owner and being constantly on the run most times food to go is all you get. I love this place. Two breakfast tacos and a drink under  5.50. Awesome. The food is consistently delicious. Try the mixed torts  flour corn . The family that owns Paco s is lovely. I am so glad to see them doing so well.
Paco's Tacos,448,Fantastic  funky family-run spot that is becoming all too rare in Austin and not enough of in this part of town 
Paco's Tacos,449,Fantastic bloody mary s paired with tasty taco s - large staff  I could see food being prepared which is cool. The environment is my fave in Austin. Luckily we found a parking spot during weekend rush  because woo  so many people were there.
Paco's Tacos,450,The prices are awesome  the food is great  and the staff is always very friendly. One of my local favorites for sure 
Paco's Tacos,451,I m surprised at some of the less than awesome reviews. We found Paco s by accident when we took our motorcycle safety course down the road. The owners and staff were incredibly friendly and I have a new favorite place for breakfast tacos.   - They have the creamy and yummy green sauce - They seem to use a better quality chorizo than other places we ve tried -The atmosphere is great and the coffee cups are adorable  We stopped in on Saturday morning on the way to the class and ended up eating there 2 more times over the weekend .   P.S. The parking lot does suck quite a bit. It is small  gravel and difficult for entry and exit  but I can easily over look that because of the great food and service.
Paco's Tacos,452,Friendly staff  fast service   cool atmosphere  great food   I recommend the   Paco s Pick. 
Paco's Tacos,453,The best veggie chorizo in the area. Great staff. Great price. The morning mimosa specials are cheap. The quesadillas are bangin. Not only that  but I can get a bottomless coffee and help myself to a SALAD BAR O SALSA. They take the go lol local card. Paco s is my go to taco joint. Five stars for consistency and excellence.
Paco's Tacos,454,My favorite Tex mex in all of Austin   The staff is always friendly and the food is amazing.
Paco's Tacos,455,The best tacos and a great family run establishment. Get the hook  em or gringo. They give you generous portions of meat and have a huge variety. The breakfast is fantastic as well. Of course the breakfast tacos are a staple  but the big man is an interesting and delicious change  Love this place.
Paco's Tacos,456,As good as tacos get in the Austin area  Have had the breakfast tacos and meat tacos both excellent. Looking forward to trying the plates. Quite a family history too. Love how the laid back decor and atmosphere come across even though they are usually busy.
Paco's Tacos,457,Great place for brunch   2 mimosas and bloody Mary s  all meals  5-10  food was good  service was great  ambience was an A . Will definitely be making this a go to brunch spot.
Paco's Tacos,458,A truly family run place. You ll often catch the whole family there in the kitchen when you come. And everyone is super friendly.  That s all well and good  but how is the food  I wasn t expecting much  but it was actually really good. Don t listen to the girl below saying the tortilla s taste like cardboard... they are great. I think they are made fresh in house. All of the ingredients seemed to be good quality... wasn t getting too much of a CISCO vibe.   All in all  worth a trip.
Paco's Tacos,459,Best experience with tex-mex tacos I ve had after having been here a year in Austin.  Busy  but extremely friendly and helpful service.  Fantastic carnitas tacos as well as their carne asada-potato-pepper  Paco s Pick .  I experience digestive issues with a lot of other places  but not here.  They will be a Sunday tradition  as far as I m concerned.
Paco's Tacos,460,Visited for the first time today  and all my breakfast taco dreams came true.  They must ve revamped their taco size since the reviews below  cause ours were ample.  Everything tasted amazing  and the tortillas are masterful.  I m really glad that everything was delicious  because I fell in love with the little house and the decor from the get-go.  Once the liquor license happens  they ll be golden.  Bravo  Paco.
Paco's Tacos,461,I get the migas breakfast tacos  add bacon.  Heaven.  They have several really good homemade salsas  and the tacos are this amazing flour corn combo.  Love  love  love.  I ve had other things here that are good  but the breakfast tacos are what keep me coming back.  Sadly I moved in September  so it s a little out of the way  which cuts down on my visits.  The 2 reason they are getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are really slow  I solve this by calling my order in so I don t have to wait   and I would like to see more earth friendly containers.  Over all I love them  and I love that the people there all know me.  In fact  when I call in Margaret knows it s me  caller ID   before I even say anything and she asks me if I want my usual  which she remembers.  That is awesome.
Paco's Tacos,462,I go here all the time since I live close.  I hadn t thought to put a review up until I went there last night.  Normally  I go there in the am  the owner is very nice and everything is prompt and delicious.   However  last night I went there for a quick dinner before heading out  and it was just stellar.  The staff was candid  attentive  everything you d want in a casual dining experience.  They have a great spot there and I think after I left they had the UFC on.    You have no reason not to dine here.  I like the Gringo  fish taco  the carnitas  and the poblano cream sauce.  Watch out for the squirrel on the way out the door.
Paco's Tacos,463,Our family loves Paco s Tacos. It s in a converted house on East 51st street. Slow down or you might drive right past. There s a narrow driveway that leads to an adequate parking lot in the back. It s a shabby chic cowboy decorated atmosphere with plenty of patio seating outdoors and some seating inside as well. It s always bustling when I ve been there. And for good reason. These are some of the tastiest tacos in town  and a great value. The staff are friendly. They have an area with 7 or so different salsas you may add at your discretion. It s a local family business and you ll leave happy and definitely not hungry.
Paco's Tacos,464,Our go-to takeout place. Our favorite menu items are the sliders - Hook  Em and Carnitas sliders are fantastic   We like to save our leftovers to mix up with eggs for an omelet in the morning. Big portions for low prices  can t beat that 
Paco's Tacos,465,Great neighborhood taco joint. Homemade tortillas  homemade salsas  and so many choices. Nice patio area  with kid toys and live music sometimes. Funky collection of coffee mugs. A great way to pass a Sunday morning.
Paco's Tacos,466,Amazing Tacos...  Queso is the best    Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  Enchilada plate was excellent.  Love this place.
Paco's Tacos,467,Sooo many great things to say. First  the little restaurant is adorable.  Cramped parking  so car pool if you go with a group . The staff is always cheerful and fun. They offer suggestions. Everything I ve tried is yummy. They have daily specials. They are decently priced  and quick on getting the food out. Love this place 
Paco's Tacos,468,I really like this Mueller-area gem. The food is delicious and staff is friendly. Today  I ordered fajitas off their catering menu for my office.  Paco s Tacos staff promptly delivered the large order. Everything was hot and fresh. We had perfectly seasoned chicken fajitas  tasty rice and beans  awesome corn-flour tortillas and  just the right amount of heat  salsa and chips.
Paco's Tacos,469,Andy Milonakis once wrote   I had sadness for breakfast.   He must ve eaten at Paco s Tacos.
Paco's Tacos,470,A hidden gem and honestly some of best tacos in town. If yer brunchin  get a dang big man  you won t regret it. If yer lunchin  get a carnitas taco or three. And put some magic green sauce on it will ya  Seriously though  the atmosphere is quintessentially Austin if it s patio weather. And the folks behind the counter are some of the nicest around. Plus  the sign out front is totally instagram-able.
Paco's Tacos,471,Tried paco piio taco made of chicken  cheese  rice   peppers. Delicious food  ordered again.  Ambience has retro style look like u r sitting in some universal studio old theme style restaurant.  Must try.
Paco's Tacos,472,Good tacos  but way too expensive for the amount of food you receive. They should add free chips and salsa for lunch. Breakfast tacos  1.75 for 2 items not including the eggs in your taco  and becomes  2.25 for 2 items per taco after 11am. Stick with lunch specials for lunch. Delicious salsas  one of the foremost reasons for making this place good are the salsas. Chile de Arbol. Honey habanero. Creamy poblano. Salsa verde. The standard red varies so much it s hard to say when it ll be the right red. Overall this is expensive tex-mex for Caucasians. You can get better and more plentiful food for your money at a more authentic Mexican restaurant.
Paco's Tacos,473,Just go here for the breakfast taco s - simply amazing.  I heard they were rated some of the best in Austin and they didn t let me down.  I will go back next time I hit up Austin for a fun weekend.
Paco's Tacos,474,Good things  atmosphere is awesome. That outside area they have rocks  Had the pulled pork slider  and it was delish.  Bad thing  and the reason for 3 stars   they use styrofoam with no alternatives to get served without it. My hippy  green  side didn t like that.   
Paco's Tacos,475,Paco s goodness   I ve been here more than a few times when I m in that hood.  Tacos are a little on the pricey side  but damn tasty.  The Hatch - hatch chiles  black beans  avocado and pico  is most excellent.  They have good chips and salsa - nice to have while sitting outside and waiting for your food.  I ve never eaten inside  always out.  I love the patio  a super great place to chill and have a meal 
Paco's Tacos,476,Art for Your Head  Mott  Joni and Joe  dined at Paco s Tacos after attending The Simplifier s Open House last evening. Yummy Goodness   Love the atmosphere  good vibes and groovy staff  
Paco's Tacos,477,Love it. Great veggie options and the meat eaters I go with also love it. The outside area is great to enjoy and I think the prices are appropriate. Im a repeat customer and have always had prompt and friendly service 
Paco's Tacos,478,What happened to this place     I used to go here on a regular basis a few years ago and recently took some friends since we were in the neighborhood. The lady at the counter   I assume she is one of the owners or a manager since she was working there 2 years ago  was rude. She ignored us for a few minutes while she talked to the cashier   and the time changed to higher breakfast taco prices . There was a leak coming down from the vent in the ceiling which hit me and she acted like I was in its way. And when I ordered a potato  egg and cheese taco  I received just potato and cheese on it. When I took it back to get some egg put on  I was looked at like I was crazy   they also check my receipt to make sure I wasnt lying that I had actually ordered eggs on a breakfast taco . The food was pretty mediocre and I was sorry I had raved to my friends about the place. Never going back.
Paco's Tacos,479,The food is amazing and authentic   The atmosphere is wonderful   Its like they are inviting you into their home  literally   The staff is super warm and welcoming    Their brownies are FANTASTIC   I highly recommend anyone try out Pacos if you want a friendly atmosphere and AMAZING food 
Paco's Tacos,480,Staff was nice but food was mediocre at best. The layout is awkward. Considering the size of the space there should be more seating.
Paco's Tacos,481,We were looking for a place to eat some breakfast around our area and figured we would try this place. I wasn t quiet sure if it was open or not so I called in and the guy who answered the phone was very informative and courteous. We walked in and he greeted us and asked if I was the one he had talked to on the phone. He guided us through the menu and suggested some tacos that were amazing  We sat outside and it was so nice to let our toddler run around and not be a burden to anyone trying to enjoy their breakfast. There were toys outside for her to play with and she had a blast  Thank you for your AMAZING customer service and for the delicious food    We will be back again    
Paco's Tacos,482,This place has the tastiest tacos ever   My family and I went here and we all loved it. I ordered the hook  em taco and it was a game changer. All of the food was pretty inexpensive so that s a plus. The restaurant was very clean and had the most interesting decorations. I will definitely be dining here again.
Paco's Tacos,483,I had heard about this place a few times  and happened to be in the area yesterday morning  so being the breakfast taco lover that I am  I thought I d check it out.  It did not disappoint.  The lady at the counter was super friendly.  I think she may have been the owner  but I am not sure.  She recommended a bean  cheese and guacamole taco.  Sounded good to me  so I ordered one.  I also ordered a migas taco.  The migas taco was just okay  but the bean  cheese and guacamole taco was DELICIOUS   I loved it   And the sauces they have are all great too   I steered clear of the  hot  section of sauces  but the poblano cream  the salsa and the tomatillo were all on point   I will definitely be back to try some other menu items.  Maybe lunch is in order next time...
Paco's Tacos,484,I woke up on Sunday and was craving puffy tacos . I didn t know where to find them in Austin so I googled it and this place came up  with good Yelp reviews.  It was a little rough getting into the parking lot but the walk up to the front door was well designed  though the decking up the ramp needs to be replaced. I have to say that I did  not have a pleasant experience at the order area. It is tight and the man behind the counter was condescending. I was disappointed that they in fact do not make puffy tacos . Nothing else was really speaking to me  so  I got the  Migas plate. It was OK and very reasonably priced . The beans were bland and the potatoes had some odd black specks on them The red salsa was good  the creamy green sauce was the best and the other salsas were non descript. The tortillas seemed to be whole grain and had seeds . I was not offered a choice of tortillas.. For me the highlight of this spot is the attention to detail that the owners  have given to the interior and exterior design. Very nicely done. Probably  will not go back to see if the food lives up to the decor.
Paco's Tacos,485,Was so taken by the cute decorations outside that I drove my car towards it instead of heading home  hungry   as planned. So very glad I saw a big sign advertising  tacos  as I had gone running that morning and after getting all 3 kids to school and started running errands realized I was famished. I parked and noticed again the very overly decorated space. They had a nice patio outside and upon entering one could see how cute it was inside. It appeared very clean and the cash register gal took my order and asked whether I lived around the neighborhood. Very friendly. I ordered two bfst tacos with entirely different ingredients and they literally came out within a two minute span. Originally I ordered them to go but I ended up sitting and trying out one or two salsas and they were outstanding  as were my tacos  I will be back  I m certain all the families with kids in the Meuller area must go there regularly. It looked festive and kid-friendly and the staff was extremely nice and not in a phony manner.   I haven t reviewed in a while because I haven t been motivated to do so until my Paco s Tacos experience  Well done 
Paco's Tacos,486,SO  you guys- thanks for encouraging me to try PACOS TACOS on East 51st- I really enjoyed the food  the atmosphere  and the funny  joking young man at the cash register  who tried his darnest to tempt us with fresh baked  gigantor brownies.    SO glad I finally tied it   It instantly felt like OLD AUSTIN-in stark contrast to the brand new TORCHYS TACOS across the street at mueller  in its strip center setting.. it s in one of those old wood frame 1920s- 1940s houses  with the worn old original hardwood floors and maze of little rooms that were once bedrooms  living room   etc.. Like the original Kerby Lane cafe- same vibe as el arroyo and the Chili Parlor  like the old nostalgic Austin I see disappearing left and right. I find that funky old Austin feel to be very comforting   They have a good number of outdoor tables which is great when the weather is nice. Also there is a lot more parking in back than you expect to find  so even though it was fairly busy when I went  11 30 on a friday  it was not problem to park  which you cant really tell from the street.  There are a number of free sauces you can add to your food  all the ones I samples were really creamy and spicy and delicious   I had a bacon and potato gordita and a hatch chili taco  under  10   and it was satisfying and quite good.   I really appreciated the fact that the guy at the register was so friendly with us. You dont get much warmth or even good customer service these days. Call me old fashioned   but snobby hipster waitpeople who act like they are above you really turn me off.  I will be a regular customer now that I  finally tried Pacos Tacos. I cant wait to surprise my staff at work with some breakfast tacos next week    If you have been whizzing by it for months  I suggest you take the plunge into that skinny little driveway and sample their wares. This is the kind of locally owned business I like to support 
Paco's Tacos,487,So excited to have a quality taco place in the hood and it s super cute to boot. The corn and flour hybrid tortillas are the yummy foundation to some quality fillings and don t forget about the creamy dreamy green salsa.  Only downside- Bacon is a bit on the salty side so go easy.
Paco's Tacos,488,I have been going to Paco s now for over 5 months.  Here s what I like   Steak quesadillas Hook em  sliders Bacon  egg  cheese  chorizo tacos with the creamy poblano sauce The Zarape  Paco s is a nice family restaurant with good people working there.
Paco's Tacos,489,The atmosphere at pacos is weirdly Texas cutesy country with rusty tools hanging on the fence  that waxy cloth you find at  flea markets  in tourist trap towns and cedar poles for decoration. For a Mexican food place this really trips me up.   I ordered a  2 mimosa and was given the option of making it a blueberry one. I was given a blueberry colored soda I think. Apparently at Paco s your mimosas come over ice and are extremely watery. The tacos were tasty but nothing special. I paid extra for avocado  thinking of getting large slices or chunks and was given what barely counts for a dab.   Overall  not bad  not great. If I wanted hipster tacos  I would have just gone to Torchy s. 4 stars because yelp won t let me do half stars  for 3.5  and the food was at least good.
Paco's Tacos,490,I tried Paco s because it s one of the few locally owned restaurants in my neighborhood. I was surprised to find that they have some of the best food in their price range in Austin.   The atmosphere is relaxed - it s the perfect place to sit and drink a cold beer and enjoy some really delicious food.   If you re not concerned about calories  the Zarape Burrito is the way to go. Chicken  bacon  avocado and a bunch of other delicious stuff make this the best burrito I ve ever had. Hands down.   Staff is friendly  restaurant is clean and  as I said before  the food is great. Highly recommend you try this place out.
Paco's Tacos,491,Overpriced  underflavored. Better tacos available at several restaurants within a couple miles.
Paco's Tacos,492,Great food at a good price. I m rarely in the area  but when I am I make an effort to stop in.
Paco's Tacos,493,Great place to eat breakfast  lunch or dinner. Laid back and casual and dogs are welcome. I am a big breakfast person  so I ordered their Miga Plate which was sided with delicious cilantro rice and beans  one word - Awesome  My husband ordered Paco s Big Man. Huge flour tortilla topped with two over easy eggs  potatoes  bacon  beans  cheese  peppers  amp  red salsa.  I must say  it too was awesome. Their blueberry bellini was refreshing and pretty darn good. I had never had one like that before.  Oh  let s not forget the amazing staff  Talk about friendly and great service   We will continue returning to try other items on their menu.
Paco's Tacos,494,I don t ever write Yelp reviews  but after my experience here yesterday I realized it was time for my first.  I moved to Austin 2 years ago and I have been a loyal customer of Paco s Tacos just about every weekend since then.  I loved the food  the prices  the salsas  and the convenience of this location to my apartment.  Yesterday was probably about the 4th time there has been a mistake with my order and no one seems to care or be apologetic about it.  I called in a to-go order and was told to come in 20 minutes later.  I arrive to pick up my food and quickly realize that my order was never placed  even though I had placed the order over the phone with the male owner and he even repeated my order twice since it was a large one.  No apology or effort to make good this mistake considering I had to wait another 20 minutes for my food.  I was told that my order would be moved to the front of the line but I saw a good 7 orders come out before my order was ready.  When I got back to my apartment 45 minutes later from the time I ordered  my boyfriend couldn t believe that this had happened to us for the 4th time.  He called them to let them know how disappointed he was with our experience  especially since this has become the norm for us and how unprofessional it is.  The lady on the other end of the phone had no apology  AGAIN  and said that they tried to move our order to the front of the line but that one item we ordered takes too long to make.  She said they will try to work on it and hopefully next time it won t be bad.  There will not be a next time.    Unfortunately I seem to be the unlucky customer at this place because the time before that  I arrived to pick up my to go order and my order had been given away to someone else.  Again  no apology or effort to make the situation right.  The time before that I got home with my to-go order and half of my order was missing.  I am starting to wonder why I keep going back to a place that continually messes up my order and doesn t value my business.  I am a big supporter of local businesses and I usually avoid going to Torchy s or Tacodeli in efforts to support them but when my order is continually wrong and the owners aren t apologetic about it  I have come to the conclusion that my business isn t of value to them.  I will gladly be taking my money elsewhere.   If you love cheap tacos with horrible customer service  then this is the place for you   To-go orders seem to be very challenging for them so do so at your own risk.
Paco's Tacos,495,Yum. I was really in the mood for breakfast tacos and decided to give this place a go and it was completely worth it. My fiance and I ordered a couple tacos and both of us were very pleased. They menu is extensive and you can really make any combination you want for breakfast tacos. The prices were great - I think I spent around  4. The place itself is pretty cool. It s in an old house with fun decor. They have some outdoor seating too. We waited a little while to get our tacos  but all-in-all I didn t mind the wait because they were delish.
Paco's Tacos,496,Seriously - best place out there.   I should tell you all that it s horrible so that no one goes here and I have the place all to myself - but it s not     I lived about a mile from this place for a year before I finally decided to go in and check it out. I can t believe I waited so long. Super cool atmosphere. Very Austin-y and fun. They have seating with TV s both inside and outside.   The food is awesome and very reasonably priced. Breakfast tacos are always a hit  but their actual breakfast plates are BOMB. Try the  Big Man  if you want an awesome breakfast experience. My boyfriend loves the sliders too. Everything is awesome  try it all.   Their drinks aren t quite as awesome as their food  but no big deal. They do have  2 mimosas and bloody marys on the weekend - awesome   They also have a pretty good beer selection if you re not into the mimosa thing.   All of the staff have been very friendly and accommodating. We ve gone in at all times of day  and they can definitely get busy  but the staff never gets flustered. We ve ordered for pick up a few times  and the food is always ready right when they say it will be  much more convenient for busy weekend mornings when you might not be quite ready to be a functioning member of society.  We love it 
Paco's Tacos,497,Large menu of tacos  had the Hook  em and Gringo.  Hook  em was slaw and tender brisket and the Gringo shrimp  slaw and avocado both wonderful with a cold beer will return soon.
Paco's Tacos,498,Outstanding food  unpretentious vibe. Just good. I could have done with a less loud  disruptive large party sitting down next to me  but that s not the restaurant s fault.
Paco's Tacos,499,First off I have a degree in breakfast tacologly and I have to say these tacos are superb. I have had them twice in the past 3 mornings and ill be going more often. The atmosphere is kinda rustic austinish which is cool. Defiantly order cheese on anything  it s really good. They have a good selection if hot sauces  thr habanero almost made me cry. The only thing that could improve is customer service but I m here to rate the food. This place will not disappoint.
Paco's Tacos,500,I m a born and raised Austinite and proud of it  Packs tacos hands down have the best carnitas tacos I ve had. Staff is friendly and polite ingredients are very fresh the guac is great and the pico awesome  This will a regular stop for me now.
El Primo,1,Hands down the best lengua taco I ve ever had in my life. The guys that work here are funny and entertaining. They said their secret is that they treat their tacos with love  so you can taste it. I certainly could. This place is a MUST 
El Primo,2,Who doesn t love a good breakfast taco  Nobody right... These guys are above average in a city full of great taco food trucks.  Our favorite was the migas ham and egg  and cheese . So good- even the rude people smoking and drinking beer at their picnic table couldn t ruin the vibe  but it was pretty close there towards the end ...  Go there for the breakfast tacos...
El Primo,3,Loved their breakfast tacos  I got the bean and egg and the migas. Definitely liked the bean and egg better. They are heavy with a lot of cheese. They were fast  cash only. Just a taco truck with some seating out front.
El Primo,4,Got a few breakfast tacos and the pastor and lengua. The breakfast tacos are where this place really shines  Super crispy and tasty with the onions incorporated in. The green sauce is bomb but the spicy is just spicy without much flavor.
El Primo,5,I was staying nearby and walking to get coffee when I happened to see the food truck and I m so glad I tried it out  Cash only and super friendly service     The migas torta is out of this world delicious - the crispy cheese was a GREAT touch   It s also really huge and very filling. The lengua and pastor tacos were scrumptious and flavorful as well. I wish they had more salsas but the ones they do have are good  Perfect place to get breakfast lunch with coffee from once over next door  I will definitely be back to try more of their tacos tortas burritos
El Primo,6,The rumors are true  I was worried the hype surrounding this place would overshadow the food  especially since we went out of our way to come here  but thankfully I was wrong. We got a variety of breakfast tacos as well as an al pastor taco and all of them were fire. It was a pleasant surprise that none of them were too salty either. The only one I probably wouldn t get again is the bean  egg  and cheese taco simply because I realized I m not a big fan of refried beans  clearly not from Texas . I would also have tried more of the lunch tacos as I really liked the al pastor taco. I also wish their salsas had more of a kick.  They only do online orders right now which I usually prefer  but there is a 10  convenience fee upcharge. With tax and tip  our order came out to just over  4 a taco.
El Primo,7,Delicious breakfast tacos with fast friendly service. They open at 7am and it s super conveniently located next to Once Over Coffee Bar  making for a perfect coffee   breakfast morning combo.  I got the migas egg ham and the sausage   egg and wow both were incredibly delicious and flavorful. Definitely a bit on the greasier side but it hit the spot dead-on for what a true breakfast taco should taste like. Highly recommend  Just make sure to bring cash as they are a cash-only establishment.
El Primo,8,Order online only.  So either order before you go or scan the QR code on the truck and order. They do not accept cash.  Top 5 food truck in town. El Primo is quality street food. The tacos and burritos are some of the best in Austin. Stopped by on a Sunday evening for some tacos and left with a burrito as well. The ingredients were fresh and full of flavor. Every bite kept leaving me wanting to come back for more. Of all the tacos I ve eaten in Austin  this is in the top 3. I look forward to coming back. The staff are also very welcoming and kind.
El Primo,9,El Primo is great. It s your typical South Austin taco truck and all the good things that come from South Austin Taco trucks can be found at El Primo.  I think the best thing here is that you can order online and pick up  which isn t an option at most taco trucks.   It gets a little busy so I would suggest for sure doing the online order and pick up method or you will have to wait quite a while.   The food at El Primo is amazing and speaks for itself. You wont regret grabbing some tacos for breakfast  lunch or dinner.
El Primo,10,Maybe my favorite breakfast taco place in Austin. Amazing bacon taco. Amazing homemade chorizo. Migas was excellent. Cash only 
El Primo,11,Went there for breakfast this AM. It was delicious. We order 4 tacos  2x chorizo egg cheese  1x bacom egg cheese  and an AL Pastor. All 4 were delicious. One of the best breakfast tacos I ve had I m Austin. It s cash only  so come prepared. They also do phone and online orders
El Primo,12,If there s one place I miss in Austin that LA can t compare to  it s El Primo. Or I just haven t found the right breakfast taco spot  since they re so breakfast burrito obsessed in LA. El P was my first breakfast taco place when I moved to Austin in 2012 and was a couple blocks from where I lived. It ll always have a special place in my heart. They apparently take online orders now  which helps if you don t have cash. Moving on up   Migas til I die.
El Primo,13,Lots and lots of hype about this place  including Elijah Wood name dropping them on his hot ones interview  Haha I think because of all that  my expectations were a little too high. Our taco and torta were both super super good but I was just a little disappointed about my flour tortilla not being cooked very much. Besides that  delicious for sure.
El Primo,14,The breakfast tacos are bomb  It can be a 30 min wait on the weekend  but so worth it. Order online it makes things seem quicker. I got the migas ham egg and cheese  bacon egg and cheese and chorizo egg cheese with beans. My favorite was the chorizo egg cheese and beans. I could eat this taco every day. All the tacos were cooked to perfection. My kid was even a fan. Tacos are not overpriced. If you are in south Austin check out this little food trailer  It s right in front of the hula hut convenience store and next to Once Over Coffee Bar on S. 1st St.
El Primo,15,2-stars   Could ve been better and that sums up my recent experience here today at El Primo.  It used to be a 4-star place but now it s not as good.  Mostly due to their tacos are so surprisingly small now  no longer Primo  but El Petite is more like it.    I ve known this place for few years and it used to be a great go-to taco place.  There was always this young dude cooking - or at the register - and he got to know my faves which were usually Migas or Chorizo with Egg and Cheese.  I was a regular here and would come every weekend or bi-weekly  tacos were always large marge and heaping with ingredients.   Fast forward - it s been a while since I ve been here  but now during the pandemic I was in the area and read up on the recent reviews and went for it again.  Different staff  different cook.    I got my usual - Migas w  Ham n Cheese  Migas w  Cheese  and Egg w  Chorizo and Cheese.  After getting my order I was quite taken back at how small these tacos are now - they have shrunk by at least 30  - no joke.  I can palm one of these now w  my hand  and my hands are normal sized  and I ve never been able to do that.  You can see past pictures from other Yelpers and I m telling you - they have shrunk significantly.     What s also disappointing is that I didn t get - or taste - any ham in my Migas w  Ham.  So they re not only skimping on the overall size  but short changing the ingredients as well.  All 3 tacos were so small and flat that they can hide completely under my iPhone 6  see pic .  I used to eat 2 of these tacos and got pretty full  but today I had 3 and still had room for more  WTF       And my appetite has decreased somewhat since my last visit here  to be honest - aging sucks I tell ya .  The taste was good  but nothing out of this world.  It s quite disappointing that they reduced the portion size and ingredients.  Unfortunately during this pandemic I m coming across quite of few places that are cutting corners - either with quantity or quality - all the while they raised their prices.  That is not good and IMO it s the wrong way to do business because you want to delight your customers and exceed expectations  and nickel-n-diming customers isn t going to make or break the bank  in the grand scheme of things .  In the end you will lose customers - and that could break the bank.  I call these places the  Pandemic Penny Pinchers  - - and unfortunately El Primo is now one of them.   There are plenty of other places to get a good breakfast taco  Granny s is still one of my faves and they are maintaining.  I m not sure if my bad experience was due to a new cook or whatevs - - so I might keep up on their recent reviews and go back to give them another try - but with a different cook.  They are definitely not 1-star because it was not a horrible experience and the quality was okay  but they are certainly not as good as they used to be and that s very unfortunate.    Sorry for being such a Debbie Downer.  Happy Hypercritical Holidays.
El Primo,16,Really solid taco spot in front of Once Over Coffee  which I recommend checking out as well .    I stopped by for some tacos.  I tried the migas and pastor as well as the beef quesadilla.  The guys working were super nice and the tacos came out pretty quickly.  I liked the migas and ham  but I like when you can taste the crunch from the chips in there and I couldn t.  I liked the pastor a decent amount  and the salsas were really strong.  The quesadilla was also good  but not the best I ve ever had.  I would stop by for some tacos if you re in the area.
El Primo,17,Pretty awesome little food truck just outside of the downtown Austin area. El Primo was highly recommended to me from a local bar tender  wife and I were visiting from California   so we had to try it.  I had two tacos  1-Breakfast Taco with Chorizo and Egg. 2-Al Pastor. Both were fantastic. Breakfast tacos just aren t a thing where Im from so I wish I would have had one more....  Oh well. I will be back in town in a few months and will have to come back to El Primo 
El Primo,18,We have had El Primo as a target for quite some time  just rarely make it to the Area...but we were both off and Headed to the SA Zoo....The tacos coming out of this tiny truck are killer...He s a master on that hot griddle and can pump our a lot of tacos in a short time...Both had a BEC and I added an extra Migas Taco...Super hot and fresh...with just a touch of burnt cheese  which is a plus in our book...Migas Taco was the bomb....Great Sauces as well...will keep it bookmarked for when the time comes again.
El Primo,19,My husband was in the area and asked him to bring us some tortas home since the last time we went they were so good. But this time they had a different cook  this was on Monday  and she made them really salty. And on top of that they didn t have beans or guacamole left. So disappointing
El Primo,20,Road tripping  we were tipped off with this spot as a must check out and I m glad we did.  Asada Burrito was bursting with juicy flavor and the side sauces were also a solid add.  There are only two tables  so don t be shy to order to go.
El Primo,21,El Primo  If you don t like tacos  I m Nacho type.  Highlights    Made To Order    Fast and Friendly Service    Barbacoa   Review  All the tacos are made fresh to order and you can taste the quality in the owner s craft. The chorizo  egg  and cheese was a pretty standard breakfast taco. But  what really held it together was the amazing melted cheese. It added an indulgent  savory twist to take the breakfast taco to the next level. Their spin on the al pastor was tasty. However  it lacked that deep smokey flavor and charred texture that I usually look for in an al pastor taco. Overall  it was still a solid taco. Finally  the highlight on this visit was the barbacoa  tender  fatty  and juicy with all the right spices making for the perfect flavor. I ll be going back for sure  especially for the barbacoa. Beyond this  they have a wide variety of taco options. I m excited to go back and try more.

El Primo,22,The Bottom Line  A true street taco truck that slings authentic street tacos.  I can t make a trip to Austin without tacos  Of course I got Torchy s earlier in my travels  I stopped by El Primo for lunch while running other errands in the neighborhood.  I got a selection of tacos  with flour tortillas    The best had to be the Asada  while the Pastor was only ok. The breakfast tacos were an interesting take  instead of scrambled eggs  the filling resembled more of an egg omelette that neatly fit into the tortilla wrap.   Here s a tip  Cash only  come prepared 
El Primo,23,Bean and egg  migas and chorizo and egg. Awesome tacos  Green sauce was great   We saw his story and decided to give them a try. Great tacos   a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fyoutu.be 2F0jTHnyobAGU amp s 37ed7ed4e94d7193a2115938a1d27d52dd216cb96e5e531415457b9b7beaf73c  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  youtu.be 0jTHnyobAGU  a 
El Primo,24,Austin loves little food trucks and so do I  so when I ended up at El Primo for a breakfast taco I was pretty darn pleased with my friends decision to take us here. This little food truck is right on the side of the road and even though it was down pouring when we arrived  the gentleman working had our tacos made fast and made just the right way. I ended up ordering a breakfast taco with chorizo  cheese  and egg and it was quite possibly the best breakfast taco I have ever had. This thing packed a ton of flavour  was super fresh  and was just straight up delicious.   You want a taco  Go to El Primo. You hungry  Go to El Primo. Simply put  I loved this place and am kind of bummed I didn t get to come back to it before leaving Austin. This place is a must stop if you are looking for breakfast tacos 
El Primo,25,High quality tacos with high quality service  The woman at the window is super nice and I totally recommend this place to anyone.
El Primo,26,Omg  this was an awesome little place in Austin. Super close to the  Austin  wall art. Food was amazing  Customer service was great  Cash only though  If you re visiting Austin  try this place  It wont disappoint 
El Primo,27,Friendly neighborhood gem serving up some simple tacos with a great attitude.   El primo has been around for forever  A true south austin staple according to the locals to that area. The humble food truck is located in a parking lot.  Now the tacos. Get the Chorizo  amp  Egg breakfast taco. That s worth the wait. I also tried the Migas and Lengua. All the breakfast tacos come with cheese. Other tacos come with cilantro and onion. Don t forget to add the salsa. The red is spicy and green is a tangy tomatillo. They also don t ask what kind of tortilla you d like  so except flour for breakfast tacos and corn for lunch street tacos. CASH ONLY   If you re coming on the weekends  be prepared to wait around 20-30 mins for your food. It s only one hardworking man on the griddle so it s expected. Primo is such a nice guy. Be sure to tip when you can 
El Primo,28,Just a great taco joint in central Texas. Amazing beans to add to any breakfast taco. Truly a game changer. Eggs cooked to perfection along w delicious breakfast meats. Keep up the great work
El Primo,29,Always wondered why there was a line  but decided to grab a few tacos to go. Beto  Umberto  who was a one man crew was super nice and must have a phenomenal memory as he took orders and cooked them all on the large griddle.  Just the smell of everything got my stomach growling.    We got our tacos on flour and all the fillings were cooked and then the tortillas were wrapped solidly against the filling.  All breakfast tacos came with a little cheese on them.  Here s a rundown  Breakfast  Bacon Egg Sausage Egg Migas  Lunch  Asada  onions and cilantro  Pastor  onions and cilantro   These 5 tacos were  15 totes.  Super tasty tacos and the hot sauce that comes with it has really good bite  I think it s a red sun-dried or roasted chili that has a kick .  I ll be going back to try some more interesting tacos - like tripas and lengua.
El Primo,30,Living out of state over the last four years  I missed my breakfast tacos. I tried this taco truck at the recommendation of a friend shortly after moving back  and it definitely did not disappoint   Ordering was really simple on their website  the truck does have a  cash only  sign in the window for ordering in person   and I appreciated being able to schedule my order ahead of time. I had the chorizo  amp  egg breakfast taco  on a flour tortilla   avocado  as well as the al pastor taco  on a corn tortilla  also  avocado   and both were delicious  My friends also tried the migas breakfast taco and the sausage  amp  egg breakfast burrito and found them to be equally tasty. The salsas  both green and spicy red  were also flavorful and great on everything. These tacos were no-frills simple but were also everything I d been craving for four years  I cannot wait to go back... once I get over my food coma  P
El Primo,31,Wow wow WOW got the beef  chicken  and pork and they all hit the spot. Very rare for a place to perfect all 3. And the sauces  oh my god. Wish I ordered 10. Ate it so fast I forgot to take a picture lol. 11 10
El Primo,32,This review is only for the carne aside burrito. So i asked what they put in the burrito. Beans beef  Pico and cheese. I should have know when she said beans to walk away. I just said no beans. The tortilla was average at best. The cheese was like melted white cheese. Not good. The pico was horrible. All i tasted was chopped onions. The meat was marinated in something i could not guess. Looked at the burrito and there was lots of sauce and either grilled onions or chopped onions that got soaked in the marinate.  Basically if your looking for a a carne aside and know what one is. This is not the place for you. Price was  10 for an ok size burrito. Considering the location i was ok with the price. But at the end of the day  i could only eat half and had to throw away.
El Primo,33,Loved the man who took our order  I m assuming it was the owner     it was a one staffed taco stand but he was very fast and careful in packaging the tacos for take out. Ordered 2 chorizo egg taco and 2 al pastor tacos.   Chorizo Egg Taco  Very cheesy and greasy but what do you expect  It s a breakfast taco and chorizo is just greasy in general. It s good but I m not the biggest fan of super greasy or super cheesy. It s definitely worth a try tho  I ve been to many taco places but this is the only place I ve been to that offers this specific style of taco. If you aren t too cheesy like me  I would recommend to ask for less cheese.   Al Pastor Taco   So good. So simple. So meaty. So flavorful. This was a perfect example of what an al pastor taco should be. Nothing crazy  just al pastor with onion  cilantro but it wa so so good. I loved how there wasn t many  any fatty pieces and the meat was so moist. The green sauce and hot sauce they have is also really good  I wonder if it was homemade.   This stand is easily underrated and easily driven past but I hope everyone gave this place a try. I m so glad I was told to try this. Idk why this place is not up there in the ratings on Yelp  A small hidden gem    
El Primo,34,This place is a gem. Only made it through three tacos - Al Pastor  Asada  and Barbacoa  but will be coming back for more. Barbacoa stood out  but all three were delicious. Might do a double double breakfast taco and lunch taco sitting  since their breakfast taco list was quite extensive.
El Primo,35,Dope tacos. I had them for breakfast on my way to airport. Excellent taco truck. Worth the stop.
El Primo,36,Don t be fooled by appearances  while they might operate out of this small stand on the side of the road these breakfast tacos are a must-try. The chorizo and egg taco  or burrito  are our go-to doused in a ton of their homemade salsas. Their chorizo  which is homemade btw  is the best and not overly greasy like the store bought kind. El Primo is a great place to swing by for a quick breakfast.   Tips  cash only  limited seating  pick up a coffee from the shop next door while you wait 
El Primo,37,All I can say is that the tacos  amp  burrito was so delicious. Great customer service. Will definitely be back as soon as I can.
El Primo,38,A great little food truck - run by a very friendly couple.  We had two migas with ham  egg  amp  cheese  an asada and an al pastor.  Migas on flour and asada  amp  al pastor on corn.  Topped with their homemade salsa and you will be in heaven.  Great truck in the middle of many Mexican joints New review - we went here again and ordered the same migas  asada and al pastor   an asada burrito.  Not quite as good as the first few times.  Different folks running the truck.  Al pastor was mushy... too fine grind .  Asada tacos are good but the burrito one tastes off.  Reduce 1 star
El Primo,39,Nice gringa quesadilla  especially with the pastor.  Barbacoa a bit too crispy for my greasy tastes and the lengua was okay. Quick  affordable  good stuff for the south side.
El Primo,40,This food truck  located right in front of Once Over Coffee  has become a staple for my weekly breakfast foods. They load up your tacos with at least 2 eggs per and with great flavor on the fixings. Highly recommend the Migs s with ham and the green salsa 
El Primo,41,Some of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had. The bacon and egg was particularly good. Pastor and sausage egg also delicious. Docked one star for the salsa selection  would love to have a fresh red salsa as an option  in addition to their spicy red and mild green   and because they charge extra for additional salsas. Cash only.
El Primo,42,I ve been in Austin officially for a year now and the only real food I ve craved during my  safe at home  time is these tacos. I get the vegetarian ones and love them. The two guys in my quarantine pod  who are taco obsessed  and have tried the best tacos around the world   always order two al pastor tacos each and one al pastor torta to share. We do this weekly. It s our cheat meal and our only real food not made at home and one of our highlights of the week during these crazy times. Try them  you will only regret not having these in your life sooner.
El Primo,43,Best breakfast tacos I have ever had period. No question about it. I lived in California for three years and these tacos outdo any breakfast taco I have had there or in Chicago  my hometown   The tacos are around  2.50- 3 a pop but I don t care. I would pay  5 for their chorizo and egg breaky taco.  You must try this out if youre in town visiting 
El Primo,44,One of my favorite taco places in Austin  full stop. They ve recently swapped out their iconic painted wooden-paneled     truck to a big white one that has A C  and they re slowly decorating it.   It s manned by only two people  a gentleman who continuously cooks while a lady takes orders and payments. I m honestly not too sure what the prices are. Something around  4-9  depending on the type of taco you get  and it s cash only. But it s always a good value and the menu has a good variety. If you come during meal times  expect a decent line and wait time  about 15-20 minutes for lunch time based on my past experience. I really like the lengua  beef tongue  taco personally. However  that and I think barbacoa  not sure  but it s another organ meat taco  tend to sell out quickly  so come by early if you can to grab it  You get a choice between the milder  flavorful green sauce and a hotter  somewhat saltier red sauce. I think the red sauce tastes best with lengua  and you can get cilantro and onions in that taco free of charge. Just great people making great  authentic tacos. I invite you to check it out 
El Primo,45,I frequented El Primo over a decade ago when I lived in Austin and now make a visit every time I m back  sometimes multiple times a trip . Exactly what an Austin breakfast taco is supposed to be - tasty  fresh  and reasonably priced. Don t forget - cash only and closed on Sunday s 
El Primo,46,If you want the best breakfast tacos or tortas  you have to visit El Primo in Austin  You ll be so amazed that such delicious food would come from this tiny food truck. We ordered 3 breakfast tacos  1 chorizo  1 bacon and 1 migas  amp  ham. Migas tacos have chopped up corn tortillas mixed in with all the other ingredients which is amazing. I like how they mix all of the ingredients and add the egg at the end so the egg holds everything together like an omelette instead of adding each item one at a time. All of their breakfast tacos have egg  cheese  onions and cilantro in addition to the meat  unless you order them without cheese. You have a choice of corn or flour tortillas. We chose flour and they were perfect. I like the Migas and Ham the best. The breakfast torta is hands down the best torta ever. Their bolillo  Mexican French bread  is flavorful and crispy. They grill the inside of the bread on the flat top then fill it and grill the outside on the flat top before serving it to you. We ordered the Sausage  Egg  amp  Cheese Torta. This bit of heaven was again filled with sausage  eggs  cheese  cilantro and onions. They also make their own hot and mild sauces which are out of this world. To keep it simple they are cash only so keep that in mind. They do have 2 picnic tables you can sit at or enjoy them in the car like we did. They do offer a great menu for lunch and dinner which we didn t get to try this time around. Please pay them a visit  you won t be disappointed. I already can t wait to go back to Austin and eat here again 
El Primo,47,My husband and I had breakfast tacos here and it sure didn t disappoint  We each had a chorizo  egg  and cheese because well  that s the staple breakfast taco. It was delicious  I tried a bite without salsa and it the flavor was spot on. Added on the green salsa and it was EVEN BETTER. The green salsa is mild and doesn t over power the tacos. Perfect for us. They have a red salsa that ll burn your tounge off if you re into that.   My husband enjoyed his other migas taco and mentioned it was hitting at the right spots. Migas at this joint adds in ham which is yummy for us  My other taco was bean  egg  and cheese and it was good  I would ve liked a tad more refried beans in my tacos but otherwise no complaints. The tortillas are not made fresh but everything else is. The tortilla was perfectly warm and soft though    We will be going back for lunch tacos soon 
El Primo,48,Small food truck in front of a convenient store. Cash only. Great tacos. I ordered a pastor taco and a bacon  egg and cheese. Tacos were delicious. Salsas offered were not my favorite compared to others. I would recommend this place if you re in the area.
El Primo,49,Finally tried this place as many have hyped it up. All I can say is that it was average at best  the pastor was not tasty at all it seemed store bought no authentic taste. the barbacoa had no flavor it was meh at best. The chorizo and egg was alright as well. The tacos seemed very small compared to other places and for  16 worth of food was expecting a little more. The torta was decent but also small as well  overall I will give it another shot but wouldn t recommend as a place with bomb tacos. Tortillas were soggy af too and I waited 20 mins for 4 items which wasn t bad considering how busy it was.
El Primo,50,I ve lived in Mexico for over six months and go back several times a year but holy cow these are the best tacos I ve ever eaten ANYWHERE. I ordered  online  a bacon egg and cheese and a chorizo egg and cheese  both with avo and actually received the chorizo and what I think was an asada taco... but I wasn t even mad. Honestly  I think they knew what was best for me .   The chorizo egg and cheese was a pillow of deliciousness. All mixed together  not greasy and the avo was perfectly ripe. The perfect start.  The asada     moved me to lunch mode. Probably the most tender  juicy  flavorful meat I ve ever tasted matched with a crispy white onion  and fresh parsley.   I asked for a hot salsa and they delivered. Spicy as all hell  what I was looking for  but still extremely flavorful.   I knew I came to the right place when I walked up and was the only person not speaking spanish  don t worry  they speak perfect English too   but man  I didn t know how amazing of an experience I was in for. 25 10. 60 million stars. Go now.
El Primo,51,This is a tiny location but super tasty and worth the wait. We placed an online pick up order Sunday morning for about five breakfast tacos. The pick up time is true to the time - we arrived a few minutes early and they noted there might be a short wait until our designated pick up time. This location is definitely busy but I strongly recommend stopping by for a fair priced  tasty breakfast taco  Plus the tortillas are super delicious .
El Primo,52,Great breakfast tacos probably the best I ve had  I got 2 1 migas 1 chorizo both were   Definitely coming back when I m in the area 
El Primo,53,For all you high-tech wizards that only use your phones to pay  get ready to get your hands dirty on some cold  hard cash  cuz this place only takes American greenbacks. I d recommend sticking with their breakfast menu  migas  etc. . Their lunch items are good  but could honestly use a little extra something to really stand apart -- it can be tough to differentiate between the types of tacos you re eating. If you absolutely insist on getting something from that menu  go for their al pastor. It s a bit tangier  so the flavors really jump out at you. But regardless of what you get  don t be afraid to throw some sauces down  They re not overpoweringly hot  but the red salsa does have a bit of a kick.   Expect a 20 minute wait after you place your order. Not much else to do around there  so go grab a coffee or something at Once Over next door and come back 
El Primo,54,Ordered ahead online and waited in a short line to pick up. Everything was still nice and hot when we got home  Delicious tacos as usual  Their chorizo breakfast taco and the Lengua are both really good and a great price. Both employees were wearing masks as well. You can t find a better taco truck run by nicer people in Austin  Highly recommend 
El Primo,55,Super good food here    the place is run by a couple and their food keeps me coming. It s a cheap place with good quality tacos. Just remember to bring cash because they do not accept card 
El Primo,56,Holy crap this place is good. I ve been Passing by this place for years  but finally tried it today. It is totally worth your time. Even if you have to wait 15 to 20 minutes. I ordered a sausage egg and cheese taco on flour  as well as a pastor on corn. The pastor was tender with a charred outside  with a nice amount of juice. The corn tortilla had a nice texture. It had just the right amount of oil to enhance the greasiness without going overboard.  Their breakfast tacos are something else  They are clearly simple ingredients  but are achieved in such a harmonious and beautiful display of balance. It had a good amount of cheese  which truly made everything better. The eggs were made fresh  and were executed flawlessly. The sausage had a great amount of character  but knew its place and didn t over power the entire composition. The flour tortilla was soft yet sturdy.    The red sauce is fantastic. It had a bold  robust low tone  with a good amount of spice that stood out in the forefront  but didn t destroy my tongue. Their green sauce was good  but was overshadowed by my impression of the red sauce.
El Primo,57,Good Taco Truck. Will give exactly what you ask for. The taco portion is plentiful   so it may actually be worth the 3.50 for  1 . Would I come again  Yes  But  Only if I have cash. They are not hip to the contactless payment trend as of yet.
El Primo,58,Jose Luis  of Michoacan  serves up quick tacos  and at a blurry speed  He does it well though  making sure his methodical steps are taken to ensure the right product. At first  I was hesitant because  well - I was hoping for great tacos when I saw the reviews  and I m used to the slow-cooking method. But I do love watching someone cooking  and this huge window-service gives you a great view of the grill from eye level and on the ground.  But needless to say  the end-product was yummy  even if it s not a fancy taco. But ordering food from a food truck or any outdoor station should never be fancy either - what I m paying for at fancy place should hopefully cover the cost of A C in the summer heat       The no-frill tacos are just that - store-bought tortillas that are re-toasted until pillowy on the grill  and the homey fillings from the griddle. I ordered the migas tacos  which set me back by  2.25 per taco  pricing of each individual tacos are not visible - be sure to ask ahead of time before ordering if you want to know . Avocado can be added for extra  and they do look fresh. Two sauces can be added - the red spicy one and the green non-spicy one - both freshly made.  I d come back  because the migas taco I had was still one of the better ones I ve had in the city. There s picnic tables outside with shade for noshing.  CASH ONLY
El Primo,59,So delicious. I didn t know what to get so I got what they mentioned were some of the most popular tacos along with a quesadilla to share with my partner. So delicious. Their spicy sauce is super spicy which I love. Will be trying their  mild  next time as well.
El Primo,60,This is the best taco stand in Austin  there are tons of taco shops  food trucks and great restaurants here  but El primo truly cooks with love and everything is made fresh to order.  When I have a taco truck one day I hope were able to do it as good as el primo
El Primo,61,Super yummy  My boyfriend and I were looking for a legit taco truck and El Primo didn t disappoint.  We tried both the asada and pastor tacos and they were delicious 
El Primo,62,El primo is never a disappointment. If you want some simplistic classic but flavorful breakfast tacos this is the place  dont forget to tip and of course some salsa  
El Primo,63,Saturday morning in Austin  had to get a breakfast taco.   Got a classic Chorizo and Egg Taco.   Flour tortilla doesn t appear to be house made  but is perfectly crispy to the point where it doesn t matter. The chorizo is juicy and provides salty and savory flavor. Cheese adds a creaminess and the eggs are nicely cooked so they still retain their soft curds. Each ingredient in harmony with one another creating a sum greater than its parts.  Furthermore  the hot sauce is amazing. Potent with subtle smoky and floral notes. Verde sauce brings herbal and some salty.   Chorizo and Egg breakfast taco with the house sauces is an addicting combo.
El Primo,64,The best tacos  asada and al pastor  that I ve ever had and I ve eaten some of the best on San Antonio  Lean meat that is spiced perfectly and put on homemade thin corn tortillas  cilantro and onions optional-  get them .  Behind the truck is a great coffee shop where you can get a great latte while waiting for your freshly made tacos.  It is a must now every time I go to Austin.
El Primo,65,4.5 really- Great little spot with simple but tasty tacos.  We arrived around 1130 on a COVID fueled Saturday morning had about a 20 min wait for tacos. The smell wafting from the trunk tells you it s worth sticking around for. We got 2 breakfast tacos and 2 regular. I loved the barbacoa and highly recommend  it s juicy  a little fatty but full of flavor.  The pastor taco was lacking in flavor in comparison but still moist  honestly that taco was the only  Soso  one  that looses the 5 star  My boyfriend had a bacon and a chorizo bfast taco. He literally said  these are some of the best bfast tacos yet . The bacon was chopped up and then cooked into the fresh egg  great touch   The corn tortillas were right on     The mild salsa had a hint of unexpected spice but full of flavor.  We just with they had potatoes for their bfast tacos.     Totally recommend this spot if you re around it. It s in a random parking lot but you can t miss the yellow truck   Also it s cash only    The people who work there are nice and efficient   
El Primo,66,Very delicious street tacos  Loved the el pastor and asada  Quick service. Friendly staff. Great prices.
El Primo,67,Incredible breakfast tacos   In TX  we have some of the best Mexican food in the nation... these are some of the best breakfast tacos I ve had. Totally recommend  
El Primo,68,Favorite chorizo and egg tacos in Austin  It will take these guys a few minutes to make but it is worth it. Make sure to bring paper money because it s cash only unless you order online.  We re moving away from Austin and this will be what my wife and I miss more than most--getting El Primo breakfast tacos after a Saturday morning walk.
El Primo,69,Wow  Just wow  They have amazon food. We ordered 3 Pastor tacos  bacon and egg taco and a pastor quesadilla. We paid about  15 which is not bad and the food was amazing. We initially found this spot in a YouTube series of tacos across Texas and when we came to Austin it was a must. I wish they would be open later since we wanted tacos again before leaving Austin. We will definitely be back the next we are in town.
El Primo,70,This was one of the busiest taco trucks on 1st Street  so we figured it was a must try. It took a bit longer for the food to be prepared than I was hoping because it was so busy  yet it turned out to be some good tacos. I had the chorizo  egg  and cheese taco. It s definitely a taco that will get your spirits up if you re not feeling too good. There are a couple picnic tables beside the truck.
El Primo,71,The Vice video about him is 100  accurate. Great businessman  very kind. He knows his regulars  orders. From what I saw when I was there  he seems to be more chipper in the morning than some of his clientele  Unfortunately  I m rarely down in South Austin  but the next time I am  I will 100  be back.
El Primo,72,I moved to Austin for only six months for work  so I set out on a mission to try as many tacos as I could. I passed this food truck on my way to work every morning  so finally I found a morning to go try it. And wow  oh wow. These are by far the best breakfast tacos I ve had while living here. The place is cash only  but it s worth digging up the coinage to try their migos taco.   One thing lots of breakfast tacos lack is a balanced egg to meats vegetables ratio  and this place figured out the sweet spot. So delicious  will be going back. Probably today.
El Primo,73,This is where I get my MEXICAN STREET TACOS...I know we are all dying to find our place.  For legit food  I either go here or Burrito Factory for their tortas  but mi gente  El Primo s AL PASTOR is hands down the best I ve had...and I ve been looking for years.   It gives that street Austin Mexican feel of a food truck  but not in the touristy way. Just the little gem you need to get that taco fix. None of the Americanized tacos like Torchy s or Taco Deli  this is Mexican tacos. The favor is on point. Honestly  it s simple but well-done  just meat  onions  and cilantro... Ohhhhh yeahhhhh. This little food stand beats out Taco More  Taqueria Arandinas  even my beloved Burrito Factory.   I recently visited and wondered why I am not a regular...I need to fix that. And try their breakfast tacos      Tips  CASH ONLY. I park at the convenience store  buy an Arizona  and then sit at the tables outside.  2.50 each taco  and I usually get 4ish 
El Primo,74,This is a tiny little food truck which you would never really consider stopping at. The parking sucks and the seating is limited  but it s worth it  The tacos are super cheap   2.50 each at lunch  and taste very very good  They are extremely basic - most of them are just the meat and maybe some onions. However  the meat is cooked perfectly  it s juicy and exploding with flavor. It s also cooked right as you order so it s served fresh and hot. The salsas are also flavorful and spicy - there s a red one and a green one and both are great. Cash only    Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a quick  cheap meal 
El Primo,75,Cash only but amazing tacos. Try to hit them up in the morning. When  we got there late lunch   early dinner  some of the meat was already sold out. All of the tacos are really good for the price. It is a bit oily and you definitely need to use the sauces to add some more flavor - but overall  solid pick.
El Primo,76,OH MY ARE THEIR CHORIZO AND EGG TACOS HEAVEN SENT. I ve eaten so many tacos in my life from California to Texas that it is SHOCKING how outrageously delicious their chorizo and egg tacos are. The only place for breakfast in Austin   Crazy affordable. Adorable location outdoor seating. Friendly cooks.
El Primo,77,I thought this was a solid 4 I think you gotta go with the carne options and the burrito is best I ve had in Austin. Guys gives you great service and the orange salsa is amazing and good kick. I will go over and over. I thought though pastor wasn t the best. I ve had tacos in mexico and at home and this isn t the best pastor I ve had in Texas alone so stick to carne asada and you ll be happy. Tortillas are also average here not quite authentic like in Mexico where they are smaller and not so large.
El Primo,78,I had the pastor  lengua  and chorizo  amp  egg.  The tacos were fantastic and the people were very friendly.
El Primo,79,Breakfast tacos are plentiful in Austin... but this place is the real deal. The tacos are so simple yet delicious  I can t believe I haven t been here before. You can taste the tortillas and each ingredient inside and there s the perfect amount of cheese and grease  Don t waste your time with other tacos- these are perfectly balanced and authentic. The service was fast and polite and I got 4 tacos for 10   
El Primo,80,Always fast  the hot salsa has a good burn and flavor to it  and the owners already know me well enough to order for me haha. Cash only  by the way.  Also there s two decent sized benches underneath a shady tree nearby that most forget to mention in their reviews. Good to know for the warmer seasons.  One last thing  order the lengua. I m obsessed with it whenever I m not getting a torta al pastor.
El Primo,81,I was told this was THE place to get breakfast tacos  and you know what  That s only half the story. Because their regular tacos are also great. I asked the guy in the cart if they were just doing breakfast  as it was only 11  and he said nope  they had everything available. So I signed up for one lengua  tongue  and one egg and migas ham. It took awhile to make  I could see him gathering all the ingredients from the  full sized  fridge he had inside the trailer  and making everything fresh. After about 7 minutes  I grabbed my food  sat down in the parking lot at a picnic bench and scarfed down two delicious tacos. The lengua was my favorite of the two. By the time I was done  the dude had another guy helping him out in the truck  so that s good. If you re in the area  or even if you re not   make a stop over at El Primo. It s on the way to the airport  Well  maybe. Kinda...
El Primo,82,Best damn tacos in Austin. Period. They re as close to Mexican Street Tacos as one can find in Austin. Barbacoa is simple  yet rich in flavor. Recommend the green sauce. All breakfast tacos are perfection. Burritos are huge  be hungry  Enjoy   
El Primo,83,Oh my goodness  These were GREAT tacos. I went to take a picture of my Migas taco and Chorizo  amp  egg taco  and they were GONE    I ate them like someone was going to steal them.  It was Monday morning at 10am and we still waited 30 minutes to get our tacos. Worth every minute   For my new friend Jack  yell when you open your restaurant and I will road trip for the grand opening   Cheers   There is a coffee place nearby  as well as a little supermarket to grab a drink.
El Primo,84,Wow I just realized I have never reviewed El Primo though I have been making rounds twice a week for almost two years.   The tacos and burritos are dank. Honestly  I can only speak for the carne asada tacos and burrito because that is all I ever get. Luckily I m up early most days so if you are there before the breakfast rush at 8 30 and before the lunch rush at noon you should have your order in hand in 5-10 minutes. The owner of the truck is also a great guy. He always makes me laugh while I wait for my tummy fillers 
El Primo,85,Not sure what people are seeing in this place   The breakfast burritos tacos are average at best. No need to order online as they don t even look at it. Juan in a Million is 10x better.
El Primo,86,Breakfast tacos are BOMB. I got the sausage and egg  amp  migas-ham and egg. My friend got the chorizo and egg  amp  migas-ham and egg  amp  bean and egg.  I should ve started with the migas one first bc the taste of onion cooked in oil or grease was so overwhelming with every bite I took that ha onion in it. It was okay  and didn t really have too much flavor.  The sausage and egg  however  was a different story. Flavorful. So good. Probably bc of the sausage being cooked with egg.  Salsa verde added heat  while salsa rojo added heat AND flavor. Was probably roasted chili or something...I had to use some of it to add flavor to migas.  Tried a bite of my friend s bean and egg. Just as good as my sausage and egg.  The owner cook adds cheese to all the tacos and asks if that s okay before cooking. You pay when the tacos are done.  CASH ONLY.
El Primo,87,So good  so friendly  Quite possibly the best taco I ve had in my life. Highly recommend the barbacoa.
El Primo,88,The sign says it all.  Do not walk away without a breakfast taco. Order a chorizo amp egg breakfast taco  watch them make it  use the sauces and get seconds.   Just going to say  We came here twice in one day for that Asada Chorizo amp Egg.
El Primo,89,We decided that we needed to try this taco truck after seeing the Vice special. Let me just say the drive was so worth it  from Houston TX . I had the breakfast and Fajitas tacos. The tacos were so good and the salsa gave it a great taste. I will definitely be coming back soon.
El Primo,90,We had the Migas Ham and Egg Taco. Nice.
El Primo,91,This is probably going to be the most entitled review I have ever written and I apologize in advance  but this needs to be said.  Or it probably doesn t  actually  but  hey  you come to this website to read honest reviews  right  Or you don t. Whatever. Skip this one  then.    I fucking hate writing scathing reviews. Hate it. Especially for local businesses that people clearly love. The stats speak for themselves - I ve written more 5 star reviews than anything else because I love giving businesses praise.   I ve given El Primo numerous chances to make me one decent bean and cheese taco. Just one. Just make me one bean and cheese taco like you actually give a shit that I ordered and absolutely want to eat that. I m not even the one ordering these tacos - my friend orders one for me when he goes to pick up coffee in the mornings. His tacos  Beautiful  tasty looking works of art. My one measly bean and cheese taco  Looks like something the dog puked up  ate  and then shit back out again.   It s like the dude just honestly did not even care if the beans made it in the tortilla. Every single time  most of the beans are on the foil and nowhere near the tortilla. The cheese  Always clumped in one spot. Not nicely sprinkled throughout the taco  just one greasy clump of cheese.   I know what you re thinking - beans are messy and they just seep out of the taco. I d usually agree with you  but I ve eaten more than my fair share of bean and cheese tacos from a multitude of places. I understand and am totally cool with bean seepage. This is not just a little bit of bean seepage. This is a total lack of caring about my food and whether or not I can eat it. I d also understand if this only happened once or twice - maybe it was an accident  but he was in a rush and it was easier just to give me a messy taco instead of take the time to make a new one  but this happens every single time.   It puts the beans in the tortilla.  It sprinkles the cheese on the beans. It folds the tortilla in such a manner so as to minimize bean seepage.  IT MAKES A DECENT FUCKING TACO. Or else it gets a bitchy review on Yelp.   I m giving two stars instead of one because even though this is the second bitchiest thing I have ever written  I just can t give him one star. I feel like a fucking asshole even doing this  but all I want is one decent fucking taco. I genuinely want to enjoy this place. The salsa is pretty good and the red one is nice and spicy and my friend seriously loves his tacos. The dude who owns and works here clearly gives a shit about what he is serving and I really appreciate that  I just wish he also gave a shit about the one thing I order.
El Primo,92,This could very well be the prototype of which Torchy s is the corporate franchised knockoff. When you re in the mood for greasier  not a bad thing   tacos  go to El Primo. It s way cheaper than Torchy s    you don t feel like you re in a global fast food conglomerate  it s a food truck  which is where tacos  ought  to be made .  And the tortillas at El Primo are probably the best in town.
El Primo,93,El Primo is phenomenal  especially the chorizo tacos. Cash only. Make sure to get a coffee from Once Over Coffee while there. Favorite Saturday AM tradition.
El Primo,94,I m amazed there are any reviews with less than five stars.  I ve been getting my tacos here for  maybe four years- maybe longer.  It does not matter what you order you will be impressed and wish you had ordered an extra.  So good.  Mejor.  Not fast but amazingly tasty.
El Primo,95,Pretty good tacos  however I m not sure it s worth the unreasonably long wait and expensive prices for the amount of food you re getting.
El Primo,96,This place is still one of my favorite taco places. My usual is either pastor  asada or chorizo  amp  egg. All great options. The service and people are also really nice.
El Primo,97,THE BEST BREAKFAST TACOS  We ve tried a few different places but always come back to this one. The young man that runs it is hardworking and makes great food. He has his own HOMEMADE chorizo and it is delicious  It s a small trailer in a small parking lot so it s easy to miss.
El Primo,98,Just f n fantastic. We did a taco truck run and had 1 taco at 4 of the best places around. This place won the battle but I m quite sure the real winners were us.  I did a breakfast taco and am unhappy I didn t try more. We are in town for 3 more days and I will be back at least twice.   The salsa hot sauces are top quality. Might go back today.  A local recommended it to us and I owe her a small horse as a thank you.
El Primo,99,Authentic Food Would highly recommend if anyones looking for something truly authentic. Although they only take cash so be aware but the tacos are 2.50 a taco. Great Taco Spot.
El Primo,100,Long wait at busy times  like lunch  but definitely one of the best tacos in Austin. Everything is home-made--you are not getting some stuff from Sysco. Good people  great food  a real gem. Try the super torta 
El Primo,101,Delicious. Jose is super friendly.  Hang around the window  it s a pretty ad-hoc operation. You ll probably want to be around to answer any question about your order as it moves up the queue.  The wait can get really long  one time was 30 minutes  at peak times  i.e. when you re going there  others are too. I believe the Once Over people are still cool with you bring your El Primo inside  as long as you also do business with Once Over  of course.
El Primo,102,These tacos are amazing  So so so good  I would highly recommend to anyone   Really my only complaint is that the food truck itself looks kind of sketch on the outside and the retail center that it s located in is also a bit dicey looking.   They are also CASH ONLY  so be sure to have some on you before showing up.
El Primo,103,The BEST breakfast tacos in Austin.  I realize those are fighting words around these parts  but I haven t had any that compare during the two years I lived here.  The chorizo and egg tacos cannot be beat.
El Primo,104,Some of the best tacos I ve had in Austin. Ordered an asada torta and a taco of barbacoa and one of pastor. Very fresh and the salsas were great especially the red. Affordable price compared to other  trendy  places you ll come across in Austin. The staff was nice and polite  Definitely will be back  
El Primo,105,On our recent first trip to Austin  several locals recommended El Primo.  We ate LOTS of tacos that week  and we both voted El Primo the best. It s a tiny truck  and only one guy was working  so it makes for a long wait  but it was totally worth it.
El Primo,106,1. I love breakfast. 2. I love tacos.  Put them together and you ve got one of my favorite things on earth. I ve had plenty of breakfast burritos in my day  but this was my first breakfast taco. One would probably say the only difference between a taco and burrito is the size and I agree. These tacos were perfectly sized for roughly 5-6 bites of cheesy  eggy  meaty deliciousness. Pick your meat of choice from chorizo  sausage  ham  bacon  migas   ... still don t know what that is  and watch the guy in the cart cook it up in front of you. It takes a few minutes to cook but when it s done  toss on some hot sauce and go for it.   We walked like a mile out of the way from where we were to get to these. No regrets 
El Primo,107,Best bacon and egg breakfast taco in town if you ask me. 5 stars for the food. One star off because the wait is usually quite long and it s cash only. On the plus side  it s right outside Once Over coffee shop and you can grab some coffee while you wait.
El Primo,108,Great Tacos  Nice workers  Great Salsas. Man some of the best tacos I ve had in a while.
El Primo,109,We came on a whim because we saw a lot of people waiting and after checking Yelp to confirm everyone thought it was awesome. We ordered two tacos - migas and egg and chorizo and egg.   We waited more than 40 minutes for those two tiny tacos. And while they were fine  they were nothing special and definitely not worth that long of a wait. I have no idea why it would take so long to make that taco  there weren t that many people in front of us . One person told them to cancel the order it took so long.   There are probably better places that are a lot faster.
El Primo,110,BEST TACOS EVER MADE    Moved near by about 2 years ago. Went there one morning  been there at least once a week ever since.
El Primo,111,Great tacos. Will always come here for my taco fix  The owner is friendly and makes you feel like family. Worth the wait.
El Primo,112,Excellent tacos  crazy cheap. The pairing of these with coffee from Once Over  in my opinion  is one of the most symbiotic in the city. Chat up primo for an even more fun experience. Talking shit about Am rica  the Mexican soccer team  to this Cruz Azul fan might even earn you an endearing first bump at the end of your exchange.
El Primo,113,Chorizo   egg  cheese  beans burrito on chipotle wrap was great. Had them add the salsa inside burrito and spice was perfect. All for only  6.50.
El Primo,114,Driving through Austin and wanted a quick breakfast  asked my brother who lives here for suggestions and this was one of them. Authentic street tacos. Had 2 breakfast tacos and 1 al pastor. Todo estuvo delicioso. Delicious   The red hot sauce definitely had my lips burning by the end. Nice staff. Parking is limited and so is seating but seems like most people come eat and leave not really a hanging out kind of place. Went to store behind the tacos for a coke.
El Primo,115,We spent a fine lazy afternoon here eating tacos. Chicken. Pork. All great. As other have mentioned  you need to get your drinks at the store nearby. It s cash only. And parking is a bit tricky when the lot is full. Yay El Primo 
El Primo,116,El Primo is the truth.  The breakfast tacos are hearty and delicious.  I stopped by here early on a weekday while staying nearby.  Online shows that El Primo opens at 8 00  but after stopping at a nearby coffee shop around 7 30 and expecting to wait  the food truck opened up at 7 45.  I got both bacon and chorizo tacos  as well as a bacon burrito for my girlfriend.  The bacon was my favorite personally  really balanced and flavorful with the mild sauce on it.  The chorizo had a little more of a kick to it but was very good also.  My girlfriend liked her burrito  although when I requested no beans or cheese  then repeated later when it seemed he was putting cheese on  he still put cheese on it.  All in all though  it was  11 for two large breakfast tacos and one big breakfast burrito  and all of it was very tasty.  The vendor was friendly and fairly quick too.  I personally think we could ve easily gotten by on a taco apiece because they are so loaded.  I was overstuffed after two.  Definitely give El Primo a shot if you re in the area.
El Primo,117,Best lengua I have ever had   The bean and cheese with barbacoa was to die for as well   Will most definitely come back 
El Primo,118,Great breakfast tacos  Visiting here on the way back to Houston and I was not disappointed. The Bacon Egg and Bean Egg taco were BOMB    The  red sauce  is a must    You can buy a drink or coffee out of the nearby gas station. Seating is limited but the table space rotates quickly  since everyone is basically stuffing their face.   Next time we visit Austin  El Primo is a side stop for sure 
El Primo,119,The best breakfast tacos by a million. Super humble  lookIng truck that cranks out great tacos all day long. Always a familiar face behind the counter. For me  the bacon egg cheese tacos resets the standard of what a breakfast taco sandwich should be. It s so good 
El Primo,120,Lately  I ve been on a mission to try as many of the taco-serving gems around Austin as possible. Well of course a visit to El Primo was required. I ordered the bacon and egg breakfast taco  pastor taco  and barbacoa taco. The breakfast tacos are definitely the way to go here  They ve got more flavor than the regular lunch tacos. The sauces they serve are great  and the red one is definitely hot    There s a bit of a wait to get your food but I didn t even notice it because I just went and grabbed a coffee at the place next door. It definitely could have been a lot longer  The guys working the food truck were super friendly. Also everything is super cheap -  2 for a breakfast taco and  2.50 for lunch tacos  It s cash only though so be sure you ve got some on hand. I ll be back here for another breakfast taco for sure 
El Primo,121,This is a tiny food truck that packs a huge punch. While I ve yet to try most of their menu  in my two times there I can easily say that they have one of the best migas tacos in town. For me  that s like the gold standard of breakfast tacos. Migas just seem like a Texas thing  so anyone who does them particularly well deserves some extra credit  and maybe a championship belt to boot.  IMHO  a good migas is about blending the tortilla strips into the eggs so that the final product tastes like one big ingredient. It s even better when it just looks like an omelette  albeit a slightly corn-flavored one   wrapped up in a nice tortilla. Anyway  preference aside  El Primo gets this migas strategy down right and it makes for an awesome  cheap meal. They throw in the melted cheese on top and some onions  and the result is I m in nirvana after eating it. You can get ham with it too  but why bother  Staying true to original form makes for a great way to start off the day.  My migas-themed rant shouldn t distract from the other menu items. As far as I can tell  they re delicious too  including the chorizo. This has been floated as one of the best breakfast taco spots in town  at least by the knowledgeable folks at Do512   and it s easy to see why. Go later in the morning and you ll endure quite a wait outside  with the couple picnic tables nearby packed to the brim. Go early in the morning  as I did the second time  and you ll see the machinery of this place getting going before the rush  watch the manual laborers get their taco fix before heading to work  and enjoy a few quiet minutes of bliss as you wait. The owners are nice guys  and great cooks.  Go down to the most eclectic neighborhood in town  and hit up this truck if you do.
El Primo,122,I know breakfast tacos.  Torchy s be damned  And I ve always had a hunch that El Primo was the morning stop I ve been waiting for. And it didn t hurt that blonde Bob Dylan gave me an American Spirit while I waited for my food.  sigh - cute hipsters   The location here is PERFECT for morning happiness... Go into Once Over  grab some delicious java and step out here and let Primo make your morning tummy happy with soft  pillowy flour tortillas  perfectly scrambled eggs  crisp  salty bacon and gooey melted cheese. I have a Migas-ham taco  too  screaming at me on my desk right now. Patience  your time will come.   When he asks if you want hot or mild salsa  be ready that by hot  he means HOT. In a good way. This salsa is a fabulously spicy salsa roja. Just don t rub your eye after dressing your taco like I did. It hurts so good.    I ve been making morning taco stops a lot lately in search for my taco soul mate. El Primo  will you marry me  Or at least join me in heavenly union and become my Desayunamor   Oh  snap  that d be a good name for a breakfast taco truck  Back off  it s mine.    2 tacos   3.50 - price is right  portion is good  breakfast is hot  service is fast and he s really a nice guy. I need look no further.
El Primo,123,Authentic and delicious. Two people run this taco truck and couldn t be more pleasant every time I see them. One of my favorite  if not my hands down favorite  taco spots in ATX. If you re a first timer in Austin  it is a must...and if you are an Austinite and haven t been  it is also a must. Cash only btw -- enjoy 
El Primo,124,THIS is the BEST breakfast taco in Austin.   It s something about that tasty yellow cheese. Watching them mix ingredients for each taco  I couldn t help but stare in amazement. I m a meat-cheese-egg type of gal  but I got to say the Migas is as Guy Fieri would say   OUT OF BOUNDS.  Only downside  you must wait for excellence. One of the many upsides - there s a great coffee shop in the same lot raking in the dough from all the taco aficionados.
El Primo,125,Local here. One of the best breakfast tacos out there. My go to are the chorizo and the bacon breakfast tacos. No frills truck with a super friendly owner operator
El Primo,126,We are in the hotbed of trailer food  and I have a hard time participating.  I m a sucker for sitting  table service  stuff like that.  I was excited to have an opportunity to just need a quick taco and was passing by El Primo.  I ve heard a lot of good comments about them  and their Yelp average shows it. I didn t think much of them not having prices painted on the trailer  but it would have been nice to know before I handed them a  10 and got a  1 back for two tacos.  I had an al pastor and an asada.  Both were excellent.  Their green and red salsas were super tasty. Although I was glad to try it  I could have wound up with a lot more food going to Habanero s just around the corner.
El Primo,127,Okay  I have now eaten twice at this humble food truck and I am ready to declare it the maker of the best breakfast taco I have yet had. Admittedly  I haven t eaten  that  many breakfast tacos  certainly not as many as somebody who lives year-round in a Mexican-leaning foodie paradise like Austin might have  but damn. Just damn. Made-to-order cheddary  refried bean and egg perfection. Cheap  fast and good  sometimes you  can  have all three. That El Primo is parked outside a great little coffee shop walking distance from my rental is a definite bonus. The salsa roja is as hot as advertised. If you don t believe me  listen for my embarrassing donkeyish hiccups. With the window down  driving slow  you ll definitely hear them from First Street.
El Primo,128,Best Taco Truck in Austin. I know that s saying alot... but you people need to get out to this place and get some real food  dude. I just found out these guys will happily make breakfast tacos for you as well. Cheap and good.. not these  4 and  5 MEGA tacos you get at other places. Lame. For  5 at El Primo you can feed a family of four   Where is it   Just north of Oltorf on South First street. It s in the parking lot of the crappy little convenience store next to the bong hookah place called  Red Line  or something. The entire thing is a little creepy.. but the tacos make it all worth it. And don t even THINK of going to the fancy upscale taco truck across the street.. all clean and white  and twice the size. They re too successful for their own good      The Carne Guisada and Al Pastor Tacos are the way to go in my book... be sure and mention that you d like the spicy sauce. and Primo will put it right in the meat when it s on the grill.   I put lots of lime on mine..  Oh yeah.. cash only.
El Primo,129,I m in torta heaven. I ve had the chorizo and egg and the  Super Torta.  Both were delicious.  You ll wait 5-10 minutes for them to make your food depending on how many orders there are. All the food is served with both a green and a red salsa that they keep refrigerated inside the truck.   The red salsa is too earthy for me so I lather on the green. This is a great breakfast  brunch  or lunch stop.   Cash only 
El Primo,130,So good  The meat is cooked well and the flavors just go so well together. Best tacos I ve had so far in Austin. The people are really nice too and your food comes out fairly quickly. I ve had the asada  pastor  and barbacoa tacos. All delicious  Keep in mind  they only take cash. And they re right next to Once Over Coffee Bar too  so you can grab lunch here then head inside to chill or study.
El Primo,131,These are the best breakfast tacos in Austin. No question  The migas tacos are just incredible. Whenever we visit Austin we always say we will try other breakfast spots  but then we get those migas tacos again and wonder what we were thinking  Why go anywhere else  We usually grab iced coffee from somewhere else and bring it along. There are a few picnic tables near the truck  and so you can eat them right away while they are still piping hot. The man who cooks and runs the stand is extremely warm and friendly-- and he has the perfect touch with flavors and cooking time.  You will want to eat two breakfasts 
El Primo,132,This place lives up to the hype. It s a perfect midway point for a walk with my dog. If only they had a water dish for dogs   Their corn and flour tortillas are both great. I ve been true to a chorizo egg and cheese  and a bacon egg and cheese. If you want their absolute best  go during a less busy time. I ve gone during the lunch hour and around 3  and at 3 it was slightly better. Their red sauce is tasty and really spicy  so be prepared with some water. Their verde sauce is pretty decent. El Primo would be worthy of 6 stars if they had some do a.
El Primo,133,Fantastic  So glad I stopped by. Tacos are so flavorful and you can t beat the price...only  2.50  Owners are sweet too  - 
El Primo,134,Flavor wasn t good  service wasn t fast  and cost was unreasonable.  My taco and torta took about 20 minutes to make  with no one in front of me in line because they were precooking the meat for the rest of the day  gross . The ingredients  max  probably cost  1. Charging 8.25 is ridiculous  especially because prep seemed to consist of throwing everything on a grill and drenching it in grease.
El Primo,135,My hunny stoped here for lunch one day and insisted i come try the food. So i came by and i loved it. They were busy but food was Great and the owners are friendly  so i have no complaints.
El Primo,136,Excellent tacos. LOVE IT   Even if more people have found it and lines longer. Happy for their more business for them.
El Primo,137,Stopped by for some breakfast tacos after reading the Breakfast Tacos list in Austin Magazine...  Cooked right in front of us and tasted awesome.  If you like more traditional Mexican as opposed to hipster gringo Tex Mex  El Primo will wind up at the top of your list.
El Primo,138,Came to Austin for a fun filled weekend and was told this was the best tacos around and that served true. Had stopped at a different taco truck previously and just didn t hit the same. Great prices and great food with very friendly staff.
El Primo,139,Have not tried their breakfast tacos but their pastor and asada are sooo good  Fair prices and friendly staff are a plus 
El Primo,140, a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FThe.best amp s 980482c3843d15f2fa2c19b7d4a4fb1181defc60363e09d7967dd6889dc370b8  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  The.best  a .breakfast.tacos.ever. There is no comparison. I m from Texas and have been eating breakfast tacos my entire life. Nothing compares to El Primo. Hands down the best breakfast tacos in the city. You should mix the green and red salsa on each taco...But it s not for the faint of heart  Also try the Gringa  I ve never had anything like that before El Primo. The ONLY place to take out of town guests when in Austin. Grab a coffee at the Once Over coffee bar while you wait.
El Primo,141,This trailer was here before the onslaught of food trucks across Austin. It is the standard I use for grading out taco trucks.  Seriously THE best al pastor taco from anywhere be it sit down or food cart.  end of discussion
El Primo,142,Writing this review after observing these issues twice in a row.  1 star due to really bad hygiene   double the wait time. 30 mins instead of 15.  Young fellow that takes the orders was both handling cash and grabbing handfull of onion cilantro distributing on tortillas   handling tortillas. Hasn t washed his hands once.   The cook s hands were very dirty and kept on rubbing his face and handling food  Food tasted good but not so much better than other taco trucks to warrant long wait times.   I will not eat at this truck again
El Primo,143,This little food truck at the corner of a parking lot was  unsurprisingly  delicious. Though the food did take a long time  we waited over 20 minutes even though there was only 1 order before ours  since it s a 2 man operation  the wait was worth it. The tortas and regular breakfast tacos are packed with flavor. I don t think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu  meaning order whatever you want and there is a 99  chance it ll be delicious   and I definitely will be testing out that theory with each visit.    BUT MY GOD... beware of the hot sauce. I used half a container on each of my tacos and it seriously almost burned a hole in my esophagus. I love spicy food and consider myself to be decently capable of handling the heat  but this tasted like pure ground-up acidic peppers. A little sauce definitely goes a looooooooooong way.
El Primo,144,The truck recently got a cute lil repaint which told me that this place was actually open so I finally made my way over. Glad I did. They only take cash and only have one veggie option but wait  hear me out  Two tacos for  4.50  they re huge and super hot - like you could wait until you get in to the office after your commute and the cheese is still gooey and melty kind of hot. They season the beans with something extra making it the best bean and cheese taco I ve had. The hot sauce is also  You can grab your fancy coffee at Once Over and enjoy fresh breakfast tacos as opposed to ones that have been sitting under a heat lamp since they got dropped off like some of the other shops around town.
El Primo,145,Best tacos in austin  They may not come out super fast but they sure are good  Not once has el primo ever not been good when I ve come  They may have the best breakfast tacos I ve ever even had 
El Primo,146,YES YES YES. I ve been looking for a real burrito  and breakfast burrito  in this town for years  I m from LA  and this place nails it  The salsa roja is so hot but sooo goooood  The flavor is right on point  the folks are super nice  this place is legit Mexican food.  But FYI CASH ONLY
El Primo,147,I ve never written a review on Yelp although I use it frequently. But THIS PLACE IS THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK taco I ve ever had. I won t be over zealous and say it s the best taco in Austin  but I m super confident in saying it has the best taste to price ratio in Austin. Simple and very effective...i take this place over  normal Austin faves  torchy s  taco deli...etc  any day of the week.
El Primo,148,if you appreciate breakfast tacos  you will enjoy El Primo.  This tiny taco cart has a simple menu of excellent breakfast tacos  amp  burritos.  I can t put them on the king of breakfast tacos here in the ATX  but it a worthy spot.  Well cooked eggs  crispy bacon  and some melted shredded cheese in the flour tortilla   I got the spicy red hot sauce.  It is very tasty.  2 tacos for  4.  Places has just two tables to eat at so many get it to go.  Also serves lunch tacos.  Great price  quick service and quality flavor.
El Primo,149,Solid breakfast tacos - nothing fancy  nothing expensive  nothing overly amazing.  For  2   taco  you re getting a solid deal.  The eggs and bacon are good  and he puts the cheese in with the eggs when making it - pretty tasty.  For being a 1-man shop  he moves pretty quickly  but  it s still a food trailer on a busy part of S. 1st - not really somewhere you want to just hang out and enjoy your breakfast.  Overall - the tacos are good  but with so many other options for breakfast tacos  I will probably go somewhere more convenient   where I leave REALLY having loved my food.
El Primo,150,Went here to grab a quick snack and it made me wanted to have a meal instead.   Location - in the parking section of a gas station Food - I tried the pastor and it was DELISH. TRY IT.  That s all there is to say about an authentic delicious taco spot.
El Primo,151,Went here this AM. I got a Miga taco  and a chorizo taco.  Both were fine. I wish the tortillas were fresh. The eggs were scrambled and all the ingredients were mixed in almost like an omelet.   The sauces  1 green and 1 red  were ok.  I would go back  as they were all priced about  2.
El Primo,152,I had one shot at breakfast tacos in Austin  and chose El Primo. Seems like it was the right choice  Tried the chorizo  amp  egg and ham  amp  egg. Doused in the red hot sauce  they were both delicious  but the chorizo in particular was really something. Savory and hearty  a bit spicy from the sauce  cheesy  eggy...everything a breakfast taco ought to be  seemed like. And it was only  3.50 for two tacos--can t beat that 
El Primo,153,Really enjoyed the food here  Service was prompt and the workers were extremely friendly. I had their al pastor tacos and man  they were great  I recommend giving this place a try.
El Primo,154,I love tacos.  Having moved to Austin from San Antonio  I didn t think I would find authentic  delicious  mind-blowing food truck tacos in my neighborhood AND so cheap   At  2 a pop  these tacos are absolutely delicious. I recommend migas and the smokey chicken..YUM  Their salsa alone makes them deserve 5 stars    Only gripe is when I have tried to order in advance so I can just swing by and pick them up  nobody answers the phone.   CASH only but there is an ATM in the convenience store inside the parking lot.
El Primo,155,BEST BEST BEST    I usually always get breakfast tacos but today I tried chicken  asada and pastor.  The chicken was by far the best chicken taco I have had in Austin. It is stewed marinated shredded chicken instead of chunks of grilled meat. I loved it and the other two were outstanding and incredibly flavorful as well.
El Primo,156,Stopped in for a quick lunch and was pleasantly suprised at how tasty these tacos were. My husband had breakfast tacos and loved both the sausage and chorizo. I got barbacoa and asada  and both were great. The cart can t serve drinks  but the convenience store there sells Mexican Fanta in the glass bottles  and it was nice to sit outside on the benches and eat. Why go to Torchy s when you could go here 
El Primo,157,I didn t know it was cash only. F am I dumb. I had one measly dollar. I m blowing it. The guy who made my asada hibachi style tells me it s OK  and quickly hands my stupid ass the taco. Five Stars haters.
El Primo,158,Visiting from SD California  and these breakfast tacos definitely hit the spot. Thank you to the random friendly in the jewelry store hat suggested this taco truck.
El Primo,159,Just stopped at Tacos El Primo this morning for the first time. This a hidden gem     I had the chorizo breakfast tacos. They prepare the chorizo themselves. It is fabulous.  Stop by check it out. Super Clean facility  friendly and presentable staff.  It definitely tastes like home cooking  Congrats on the excellent food truck guys 
El Primo,160,The food and service is outstanding all ways feel like family and the quality of the food and especially the meat is top quality if you are looking for a good authentic Mexican meal then go to El Prino
El Primo,161,I m possibly one of their first customers.. I have been coming to indulge their delicious Tacos and tortas since 2005 ... And I have never been disappointed .. This place kicks A   totally recommended
El Primo,162,This is one of the best food trucks I have ever ate at. I got a torta al pastor and it was delicious. The size was great too. The salsa was also delicious I got the red kind. I paid  5 for the torta. They have a couple tables where you can eat there too if you want. I totally recommend it. I can t wait to go back and get some breakfast tacos from there
El Primo,163,Good  old school tacos.  These aren t the fancy kinds like at Taco Deli which is still my favorite. Nope  but their tacos and tortas are still great. My chorizo and egg torta had fluffy eggs  just the right touch of beans and sauces  and high quality chorizo. Tongue tacos were ok  tender and simple mexico city style  onions cilantro . I prefer crispy tongue but that s rare to find and these were fairly cheap.  As for the hot sauce... some gringos here can t handle heat... I didn t find the  hot  one hot at all  so boo-hoo to the reviewers who docked stars for that...
El Primo,164,Having been raised in San Antonio  it s probably a safe bet that at least 40  of the proteins my body has ever coded for and produced were fueled by the steaming  eggy  and sometimes quite greasy  goodness of my two closest early-morning hombres  se or bacon  amp  egg  and papa migas.   So  when the increasingly gaping void within my gastrointestinal tract began to plead for tribute amidst my isolating routine of being  that guy  who spends all day in the coffeeshop   today it was Once Over  hunched over and hammering away at at his Macbook keyboard in relative obliviousness to the surrounding physical realm  it was pretty sweet spotting this rustic taco trailer just across the parking lot  I had seen the name El Primo on Yelp s list of the most highly-reviewed cheap eats in my area  but from the angles at which I stood surveying the trailer  there was no indication of this name  and now  judging from the photos here I have used my powers of deduction to conclude that it was painted on the two faces of this establishment I happened not to see--I wonder if this confuses driver s headed South down first  .   For some indiscernible reason  no prices were to be seen on their painted-on menu   I guess this IS kind of charming in a way  but seriously guys    so after discovering that the breakfast tacos were all  2  my cheap-ass self decided to order a single one of the migas variety  which was absolutely perfect  filling  with an even  generous distribution of ingredients within the egg  and complemented especially well by their red hot sauce. True  I only tried a single taco  but it was legit enough to assume the rest are equally great.  The main reason I dock a star is the lack of pricing on the menu  along with the fact that I think the prices are a bit steep to be served from such a crappy old trailer  especially when you consider that the from-the-kitchen-of-the-gods breakfast tacos of Papalote on South Lamar are a whole five cents cheaper. Perhaps I ve been spoiled growing up in a city where most breakfast tacos are  1.00 or less  but I also can t complain too much  considering that these babies are probably twice as fat as the  ber-cheapo SA ones. Keep it up  Primo 
El Primo,165,One word the breakfast burrito is the closely thing you get to a delicious breakfast burrito in CA. I love it with the red and green salsa added inside. Only thing is the wait is long but once over coffee behind them and is a chill spot to drink coffee waiting for that delicious burrito.
El Primo,166,Great  no-frills breakfast tacos. They re not over-the-top amazing  but they re consistently good  and relatively cheap.  I find their bacon a little fatty  but the sausage is a great substitute. So my standard order is the egg  sausage and avocado. I usually ask for no cheese  I personally don t like the greasiness their cheese adds .
El Primo,167,Great Migas tacos and burritos  Also very nice and friendly every time we go. And good red and green salsa.
El Primo,168,Fast  friendly  delicious and cheap. I love El Primo.
El Primo,169,El cheapo.  El fasto.  El goodo.
El Primo,170,The hard thing about critiquing food sold out of truck or trailer is this  Do you treat them the same as you would a restaurant  selling similar items  or differently because it s being prepared in a 2 X6  area   Where  naturally  you re going to have to compromise on some things because of the space.    Regarding the first part of the question  one could argue that food trailers  for the most part  are selling street food and should be treated as such. For the most part  that means something simple and cheap  which usually tastes good   but it s also not the calibre of meal that d put a Michelin star next to anyones name either.   So that brings me to the second part of the argument  Is it harder to make a meal out of cramped area where you may not have access to things you would expect in a restaurant   e.g. a refrigerator  sous chefs  an oven  etc.  Probably so.  The thing about El Primo is  it highlights my dilemma. I ordered an Al Pastor taco and Carne Asada taco there recently and it was pretty good--for coming out of a trailer. Everything was hot  tasted fine  and was cheap too. Sure  there were some grease issues and the corn tortillas were store bought  but all in all  it was good for what it was. That said  though  I d still call it mediocre by sit-down restaurant standards.   Obviously  I had to compromise somewhere in between to give this place a grade.  El Primo gets three stars from me.  For a taco truck  it s probably about as good as it gets  but it wouldn t be anything more than average if served at a Mexican restaurant.
El Primo,171,El Primo looks like one of those taco trucks that is going to kick butt yet doesn t necessarily thrust you into the  I just had my mine blown  realm. By that I mean  it still is essentially just a taco cart  right  WRONG. This unassuming South First mobile eatery is far from ordinary.  You don t come here to get a simple pastor fix and call it a day because you have gotten your fix of the traditional Mexican staple adorned with the hipster-esque simplicity known and  cilantro and onion  only--throw in a lime.  No  no  here  you are definitely obligated to indulge in a full-on  5 torta.  The torta is truly a thing of art. The 2 ingredient option is certainly a plus  to boot. AND  AND  AND you can make migas your choice. But  you don t really get JUST migas. Funny that this Austin favorite actually counts as 1 of your ingredients  as it is an amazing patty-like conglomeration of egg  freshly sliced tortilla  and sauce. He slivered a fresh corn tortilla into a julienne  had the eggs to be cooked to the perfect density but somehow actually allowed for some yolkiness to shine through   And best of all  you don t get that soggy chippage found in many other migas. The chef really knows how to proportion EVERYTHING. The layering of cheese on one side of the bread and the creamy beans griddled onto the other half really added the perfect creaminess and meatiness  respectively.  As he was cranking this fluffy bolilo bread with the accompanying filling  I thought he was just throwing things on the griddle to look busy  but he knew exactly what he was doing. Talk about a true mastermind of the spatula and flat top range. Goodness gracious.  Additionally  the spicy red salsa very zippy and pungent  and the green mild and fresh. Honestly  people give this one high acclaim  and it is deserving of every bit of it. Wow.
El Primo,172,Excellent breakfast tacos at a low price. This place is no secret  there are usually 3-4 people there but I ve never waited a long time.  The service is always friendly. You can walk 50 feet to grab a coffee at Once Over and there s a picnic table or two if you can t wait to snarf them down.  If you re all about the tacos and appreciate simplicity  hit this place up. If you re a little more high maintenance and don t mind paying  4  for tacos and better seating  your spot is down the street a little further.
El Primo,173,El Primo occupies a non-descript trailer on S.1st Street in the parking lot of Pecan Food Mart  next to Once Over. It. is. phenomenal. The first time I ever ate there  I kicked myself for the countless dollars I wasted on the  other  overhyped taco breakfast taco trailer  the one that rhymes with  or cheese  on S. 1st. Three tacos came out to  3.50.  This place is fantastic. And though you don t find fancy schmancy bfast tacos  you find bfast tacos done right. The chorizo  egg and cheese all melt together in a puddle of beautiful harmony  only made even better by the hot sauces. The bacon is crispy yet not fatty. The tortillas are as soft as a baby s bottom.  I think I am in love with El Primo.
El Primo,174,Delicious breakfast tacos - ordered the bacon and eggs taco...perfect salsas  8 for that and a breakfast burrito  next to a coffee shop
El Primo,175,After what seemed like an eternity of packing  sweating  moving  sweating and unpacking  we were exhausted  starving and craving Mexican food - the real stuff  preferably from a truck.  Lo and behold  God gave unto 78704 the gloriousness that is El Primo. Cheap but flavorful and with hefty portions  El Primo keeps it real. The barbacoa tacos are some of the best I ve ever had  the tortas giant and satisfying.  Next time we re going to branch out and try the sopes  gringas and huaraches. Nom nom.
El Primo,176,It s been said before.  It gets repeated here.  Best taco truck in Austin.  All of us fatties at my work make this a daily stop.
El Primo,177,LOVED THIS PLACE  - their breakfast tacos are the best I ve ever had  and I ve tried a lot throughout the southern US. This guy was genuinely nice - he was joking with us  and telling us about his life  and roots while he was cooking with us. Will go back everytime I go back to Austin.  Oh and the food is very cheap  
El Primo,178,Decent tacos but you literally have to wait 15-20 mins for tacos. Don t say I didn t warn you.
El Primo,179,Grabbed a taco here last weekend. It was a million degrees outside  but the tacos were well worth the wait. I had a chorizo and egg taco and a bacon  egg  and cheese taco. They were both very good. I devoured them in minuets. They were served on home made tortillas. Totally yummy.     I suggest getting two tacos. They aren t tiny  but they aren t huge either. I haven t had the chance to try anything else  but I m sure whatever they make is good.
El Primo,180,El pastor torta with green salsa all day and every day. Well priced -  6.50 - for a delicious cilantro and avocado topped  well seasoned masterpiece.
El Primo,181,One nice man making breakfast tacos. Just consumed the best taco of my life. I will be back. Probably tomorrow. He was taking orders in english and spanish from every direction and somehow managed to make everyone happy. Impressive all around.
El Primo,182,Best migas taco ever. I can t help but love Austin because of breakfast tacos like these. The slice has a kick  so beware 
El Primo,183,This is what breakfast tacos are all about. Try the migas taco on corn. Made as you wait  by a guy in a trailer  cooking with soul 
El Primo,184,At first I was afraid...and I m not kidding. This taco trailer looks like a place you might get food poisoning while on a drunken trip to Cancun. Good news is  the tacos are better tasting  amp  they won t give you food poisoning. Bad news  you re sober.   I usually spring for a couple of the chorizo  amp  egg breakfast tacos with cheese on the corn tortillas  but this place mixes it up by serving breakfast burritos  it s a taco  only more convenient for on-the-go eating   tortas  sandwiches  and more.   Here s the deal  the tacos are made to order almost entirely. It takes a few minutes to get your order out  but usually you will have plenty of time left to eat if you re on a lunch break. The hot sauce here is a huge winner. If you can dig spicy  go with the red sauce. If not  at least spring for the verde-it ll add a lot of extra amazing flavor to whatever you order.
El Primo,185,El Primo is the Jam  Best  2 breakfast tacos in the city  Lunch tacos  2.50 too  It s right in front of Once Over Coffee Bar so I usually grab a couple of tacos and a coffee and sit outside.  There s a reason it s always got people here  Freshy fresh 
El Primo,186,Easy 10 10 for El Primo. The food was outstanding. So delicious. We tried the migas tacos and a chicken torta. Our new go-to place for tacos. Genuinely nice people  great service  and delicious food.
El Primo,187,This taco truck was run by one man  so my friends and I were really impressed with the quality of the tacos and the speed at which we received them. The two salsas he gave us were a nice addition to the tacos. I highly recommend the breakfast tacos 
El Primo,188,I m happy I grew some gonads and tried this place out.   Being someone who s visited Mexico and gotten food poisoning from more than one food stand... I ll openly admit that I was very nervous about trying El Primo.   It turns out they have the best breakfast taco s  largely because of their awesome red hot sauce  I ve ever had. It takes a few minutes to get your food in peak hours but  it s well worth the wait.   I ve only had the Bean Egg and Cheese  veggie  but from what I ve heard from others  the rest is pretty darn good too   
El Primo,189,Excellent breakfast   Best tortas in town   Jose is super friendly and makes everything at his best. I drive all the way from slaughter just to have his breakfast now and again.  My husband used to eat here every morning when he worked close by and never got tired it  That s pretty damn good if u ask me   Good up the delicious work jose    
El Primo,190,Since my bf moved to the Oaks apartment  amp  we re kinda broke  we ve been eating here a lot.  Breakfast tacos I ve had  chorizo  amp  egg  bacon  amp  egg.  I LOVE their breakfast tacos and think they re definitely 5 stars worth.  I love the way they just crack their egg onto the grill so it s nice and crispy on the edges like a fried egg.  None of that cream bs that you find in scrambled eggs.  Lunch tacos I ve had  asada  pastor   amp  lengua  beef tongue .  I wasn t impressed.  I think their lunch tacos are only 3 stars worth compared to some other taco carts.  The pastor was the best out of the 3 and I would definitely recommend you to try it and judge for yourself.  The carne asada tastes nothing like what you get in a restaurant and I much prefer the restaurant version.  The lengua was in my opinion disgusting.  And I love beef tongue  but it tasted to me like they boiled the lengua in water and then let it soak in that water before grilling it.  The outside had nice flavor because of the hot sauce i guess  but when you bite into it it tasted soggy and had disgusting beef tongue water taste..... yuck.  Also tried the pastor torta.  The bread was nice and crunchy.  So  breakfast   5 stars  lunch   3  amp  overall   4
El Primo,191,We had chicken tacos and I had pastor and eggs tacos.  Excellent.  EXCELLENT.  Daughter did not really like the sause on the chicken.  Ask them for a taste first   Nice folks.  6 tacos was 13  but full.
El Primo,192,Cheap  good street tacos.  I ve had better  but the location is convenient and prices are good.  Out of the tacos I had I would rank them in this order  best first   pollo  pastor  asada.  Fantastic salsas.
El Primo,193,Great place when Beto is working  great guy. But when the owner serves he does not make good food. Come when Beto is the cook he knows what he s doing. Love the salsas put a lot of green and a little of red. The Super Torta with avocado is awesome  love the flavor consistency and the buttery bread. But please oh Lawd don t come when the owner is cooking.
El Primo,194,I don t live close at all  but I travel to have these delicious tacos- which are possible the best in Austin - which is saying something  always friendly as well.
El Primo,195,I don t know how you make a bacon  egg and cheese taco as good as this guy does  it s just bacon egg and cheese for heavens sake  but it s like heaven in your mouth    Probably has something to do with the fact that he cuts up the bacon  cooks it up right there and then cracks open a fresh egg right on top of the mostly cooked bacon so they make friends before they go in your belly  and most of the bacon grease goes into the egg . The squirt of salsa before it leaves the griddle helps I m sure too.    I finally branched out and got a carne asada torta today- I always get breakfast tacos  no matter the time of day- and it also was fantastic  A little bit salty  buy not nearly salty enough that I m not craving another right now.
El Primo,196,This taco truck is located in a little parking lot on South 1st street and it has really great authentic Mexican breakfast tacos and tortas  If you ask the server  he is really friendly and he will give you some recommendations and tell you what s in each menu item  I got the chorizo  egg   amp  cheese breakfast taco and the steak torta  The breakfast taco was yummy but I didn t think it was amazing. However I do think it was worth the price. The torta was delicious and the meat was pretty juicy  Beware of the red hot sauce cuz a little comes a long way  My friends almost died eating it and they usually take the heat pretty well  It usually takes a while for your order  maybe 5-15 min  but it s worth it  There s some limited seating  1 big table  bench and 1 small one   on the side so beware during lunch hour cuz there tends to be a line  The prices are pretty reasonable and this place is cash only so bring some change  Also if you are up for dessert  Sugar Mamas Cupcakes is just down the street and it is delicious 
El Primo,197,Stopped by with a buddy who s a regular.  Maybe I should have listened to him and gone with a burrito  but as it was I had two tacos-- one al pastor  one carne asada.  They were both tasty  though I preferred the carne asada.   Maybe it was an off day  or maybe I should have ordered differently  but I wasn t blown away.  It was  however  really tasty and cheap.  I picked up the tab for my two tacos and a pair of chicken tacos for my friend and it was only six bucks  well  seven after I threw a buck into the tip jar .  The truck was also really clean.  Oh yeah  like other people have noted  the proprietor is incredibly nice.
El Primo,198,Im a breakfast taco snob and these are some of the best tacos in town. I asked if they had any vegetarian options and the person in the truck made me a delicious egg-bean-avocado taco that I fell in love with.
El Primo,199,This is my go to for breakfast tacos  especially on Saturday mornings. I love the bean and cheese and the bacon and cheese. The owners are friendly and always considerate. I cannot tell you how good these tacos are  JUST GET THEM 
El Primo,200,Excellent burritos  tacos  and my favorite  tortas  The guy who works there is impressive  he takes orders and cooks  and never writes anything down. It s all fresh made right there. Nothing is made in advance.
El Primo,201,All the tacos are delicious  Never disappointed  And properly priced unlike many others in the city that are charging more than hey should be for taste and quality. So thankful to have this in my hood 
El Primo,202,Cheap  tasty tacos  Carne asada was the definite winner compared to barbacoa. It was juicy with the right amount of Mexican spices. Will eat again when in the area. Especially at these low prices    Now I ll have to try al pastor...  Tip  Grab a mexican coke from the convenience store behind El Primo for the correct experience 
El Primo,203,Best tacos in Austin hands down  Actually  best tacos...ever. In any city. Get the chorizo egg and cheese on corn or for lunch get the shredded chicken taco. Nicest guys work the food stand and it s super cheap.   
El Primo,204,Some of the best Mexican tradition tacos I ve had in some time. I get the migas and ham burrito in the am. Lunch is next on this list. Cash only I believe and could see some lines on a busy day.
El Primo,205,I ordered Carne Asada and Al Pastor from these guys for a party at my house. It was gone in no time.   Ridiculously good.
El Primo,206,So good. Definitely on my personal top one or two places to get tacos or tortas  burritos  in Austin. It s strength lies in it s simplicity...definitely not some obtuse fusion concept or some-such. Just a small  small operation  run by a couple of gentlemen that know how to make everything that comes off that grill taste great. I ve been going for years and have tried almost everything on the menu. My personal favorites are the migas burrito with avocado substitute instead of ham  and the lengua torta or al pastor torta ...depending on the day. Both the green and the red salsas are super flavorful but day-um that red one is spicy...probably my favorite in town. So good.
El Primo,207,Pretty ideal location for a taco truck  great coffee shop next door AND you can look down upon the boutique trailers at the South 1st trailer park.  My business partner and I go to torchy s for lunch  we really like the variety...not too authentic  though.  I ve been to lots of taco trucks in town  and my only gripe with the authentic ones is that they often give you something that s pretty small. I know this is the custom  but I often find myself disappointed at the two tablespoons of diced meat that I receive.    El primo makes them larger than most of the other trucks around  but not as big as torchy s...they are also less expensive than torchy s  we got 5 tacos for 10 bucks .  They have a couple of tables in the shade with a great view of South 1st.  Had the pastor  lengua  and barbacoa today. The Pastor is f   ing good  seriously. The lengua and barbacoa were both very serviceable  they kind of got eclipsed by the pastor taco  though.  Saw some guys get breakfast tacos - they looked good. Real egg.  Also saw someone get a torta  probably a solid choice as well.
El Primo,208,This little trailer may not look like much but seriously  skip the other spots and head here. The best tacos. Nothing else to say. Oh. Except  cash only.
El Primo,209,This breakfast taco  cash only  simple stand is truly about as good as it gets. Perfect for a hangover. Also try their tacos al pastor. Fantastic. Some of the best. Calling ahead is a great idea if you re looking to eat at hangover breakfast o clock.
El Primo,210,The best breakfast tacos and burritos in town by far. A very authentic taste that can t be duplicated. A must try
El Primo,211,My second visit to El Primo.  My first visit was in December during my first visit to Austin.  I knew the breakfast tacos at El Primo were very good  but I did not fully appreciate how good.  After trying a couple of other places  I knew El Primo was by far the best I found in Austin.  During this visit my wife and I shared the full breakfast taco menu  5 choices  and all were outstanding.  My favorites were the Migas and the bean and cheese.  The green sauce was a perfect addition.  The service was friendly and efficient.  El Primo is a not to be missed while in Austin.  p.s.  the coffee next door is excellent as well
El Primo,212,Have only had the breakfast tacos  but it was great and they use homemade chorizo which I always respect. Great deal  nice guy and I would definitely return for more.
El Primo,213,Get cashback from the food mart in the same lot and buy a drink there. The breakfast tacos were fantastic  some of the best I ve had in Austin so far. Really quick service and the guy was super friendly.
El Primo,214,El Primo is as good as it get. Fresh ingredients  on-demand breakfast tacos that will blow your mind.  Primo  is also quite the character  and is amazing to watch him take eight orders and get them all right.
El Primo,215,The best tacos I have found in Austin so far. Get the al pastor and enjoy 
El Primo,216,Someone  a true friend  bought them to a morning work meeting in the office.  The corn tortillas were light and the eggs were perfect.  I have never had El Primo before but I will be going back for sure.
El Primo,217,This taco stand has been a staple of my diet for over 2 years.  Cheap  fast  friendly  savory.  Se habla espanol  and they understand spanglish pretty well too if you need help ordering.    The tacos are really delicious  asada  pollo  al pastor...you can t lose.  However  the real score is in the tortas.  If you want a bad ass sandwich  get to El Primo as fast as you can.  The bread they use for the tortas is the best bread I have ever eaten.  If Subway had bread half this good they would be running the New World Order by now.   South Austin diamond in the rough.
El Primo,218,The asada tacos are my favorite  Pastor are good  but too greasy for my liking  Bookmarked for my return back to Austin 
El Primo,219,Love the migas and barbacoa tacos  Chicken is too spicy for me but great flavor if you like spicy. Order your tacos  grab some coffee from Once Over  and come back to pick up your tacos when they are ready. Freshly made to order  The guys working in the trailer are very friendly.
El Primo,220,The menu is pretty simple and may not have as many choices as another taco stand  but the tacos were wonderful. They are topped  with cilantro and onion  just like in Mexico  and the owner makes his beans and chorizo at home. The salsas are INTENSE. Really friendly staff as well  Taquitos de trompo y frijoles... Go get them 
El Primo,221,so i ordered a few tacos...this is my very first time eating tacos from texas from a food truck or stand.. i drive away and start eating the chicken taco...before i finished i turned around and ordered 6 more  for hubby and boys...  they were delicious add the green sauce and wow..yummy..the pork and breakfast ones are all delish
El Primo,222,Literally the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had   The chorizo tacos are spectacular  and the prices make it impossible to get just one. Don t leave Austin without trying El Primo first  
El Primo,223,Quite frankly  this is my favorite place to get a taco in Austin. Don t let the trailer scare you away  you can watch the taco man make your taco in front of you and you can see how clean the place is.  Their pastor tacos are the best I ve ever had. Period. I have also sampled all taco and torta flavors and have been blown away each time. Their lengua  tongue  taco is also the best I ve had. So very good. To top it all off you get your choice of a green  mild  and red  hot  sauce to put on your meal. Both are very good. I can t recommend this place enough. I ve eaten all over and this is one place I keep coming back to. A couple notes   they don t offer drinks but there is a mini-mart behind the trailer. They also only accept cash. Tacos are between  1.50 and  2.
El Primo,224,This place  has great breakfast tacos  On our days off we swing by and pick up some tacos and relax on their outdoor seating. Highly recommend this food truck
El Primo,225,It may take a while to get your food but the wait is well worth it    Tacos al pastor are to die for.
El Primo,226,Could not possibly have worse customer service.  Waited literally an hour for 4 tacos   and when we got up to leave  we had the courtesy to tell them we were leaving  and they informed us they would not have been able to make 2 of our 4 tacos anyway because they had run out of the ingredients     They didn t think to let us know that during any of the entire fucking hour before      There were approximately 12 other people waiting for tacos at the same time  and after about 45 minutes a few of them started to get their tacos and go.  We held out hope as long as we could  but in the time we waited we could have easily walked home and made our own damn tacos  or gone to any of the other 12 taco places on South First.  So I have no idea if these are good or not.  But if I have to wait that long  I really don t care to find out.
El Primo,227,I had a serious hankering for breakfast tacos this morning and stumbled upon El Primo on my drive to work. I ordered a egg and bean taco with the picante salsa. It was delicious  Definitely hit the spot. He had several people in line  but worked very quickly and efficiently. Even took the time to make quick conversation with me. Good food  good service  and good prices. I ll be going back soon to try a breakfast torta 
El Primo,228,This glorious little taco stand doesn t need more yelp love  but I just can t resist.  The guy who works here is super friendly and always in a good mood.  He makes my breakfast tacos  egg  bean  and little cheese  to PERFECTION.  I don t know what he does to these tacos  but they are the best I ve EVER had.  Period.  Go here  bring cash  and tip the Taco God 
El Primo,229,I travel south every morning  and I had always seen the reviews of this place online. Personally  I am not a frequent trailer  food eater  but something told me to give this place a shot. After today  I know see why the reviews were so great. All I can say is Breakfast Tacos    mmmm On this glorious day I found my new breakfast spot   Also  the HOT salsa is HOT and boy was it good. yeeyee 
El Primo,230,Honestly THE best breakfast tacos that I have ever had  The only downfall is that they don t open until 8am so I can only get my chorizo taco fix if I am running late to work.
El Primo,231,Stopped here on my way to work when I had a sudden taco and coffee craving.. Alas  driving by we realized this truck is right outside Once Over Coffee  killed two birds with one stone  just like that.  It gets a little busy so if you are doing the taco coffee thing and looking to save some time  I d put the taco order in first so that el primo starts making them while you get coffee.  Both salsas were very good  I went a little salsa happy on the red sauce and it was SPICY. I am used to hot spicy so it was ok  but it took me a bit by surprise. Most red salsas taste more like tomato than anything else  NOT this one.  Probably going to make this in to my Friday breakfast staple   Cash only.  2 tacos.
El Primo,232,I m in love. After two years of driving past El Primo on my way to work  I finally stopped. Best decision I ve made in a long time. No joke. This is the best breakfast taco I ve ever had. First  the owner is awesome. Super friendly  approachable and accommodating. I ordered two tacos  The migas with ham and the chorizo. To both  I added cilantro  onion and avocado. They come with cheese and salsa too. For starters  they are good sized. He fries an egg for each and includes adequate meat.  Everything is fresh and made right in front of you. And for  2.50 a taco  the quality is unbeatable. It s just amazing. I can only imagine how good their burritos and tortas are and I can t wait to go back. Go. Go now. You ll be happy you did.
El Primo,233,Great  delicious  traditional mexican tacos tortas quesadillas and burritos. I would totally recommend this place. It s a great value as well. tacos are cheap. The owner is always there working and very nice. If you want to practice your spanish  it s great for that too  Service is quick and pleasant. Cash only. No drinks. But it seems like he has a deal going on with the convenient store who s lot he parks in because you can easily buy a drink and get cash at the same time from them. Awesome place.
El Primo,234,By far the best TACO TRUCK IN AUSTIN  TX  It doesn t get anymore authentic then this. This is the true flavor and spice of Mexico. There is no other comparison. You would never guess just from passing by this tiny taco truck  but honest to God these flavors can t be touched by anyone else. I first heard of El Primo through Austin American Statesman and while driving through South 1st St. had to check it out for myself. I still love Torchy s  but have found a new love obsession for the moment. I cant even describe the tastes in these delicious FAT breakfast tacos  Try the Al Pastor and Carne Asada  which were my absolute favorite. Try it for yourself  you will be addicted. I swear they are laced with crack  so unreal 
El Primo,235,When I lived on 1st this was my breakfast taco spot  The chicken egg and cheese tacos here are my happy place. Simple tacos without the frill.  The man working is extremely pleasurable last time I went  he mentioned that his family also own a restaurant near west campus. There s a coffee shop next door that people drop in while waiting for their bits of heaven. The wait here can be a bit long since there s only one guy working but it s never too bad. This place is super cheap too 
El Primo,236,Best tacos in Austin - and that s a tall order given that they re our official cuisine  along with BBQ . Berto is a maestro of the highest order  Cash only.
El Primo,237,This place is so fun and yum. Hands down best breakfast tacos I ve had. Great egg to cheese to meat veggie ratio which I feel is the biggest downfall of most breakfast tacos. They take cash only. They don t charge tax. They are a great and friendly operation. I highly recommend the barbacoa torta   6. SO filling and that bread was so soft and yummy 
El Primo,238,The Barbacoa is horrible no flavor and very greasy save ur money go somewhere else. The trailer is dirty they really need to clean  wont ever come here again.
El Primo,239,After reading all the reviews we decided to check it out  we get there to find out the tortillas are not homemade. That alone was enough to take us elsewhere. Nothing compliments a taco like a fresh hand made tortilla be it corn  or harina  flour . Really disappointed.
El Primo,240,Their taco and torta are great   However the wait time is super long too especially during meal time.
El Primo,241,Wow. So good I ve found myself coming back again and again  3 or 4 Times this week . Its not famcy  but boy is it good 
El Primo,242,El Primo has the best street style tacos in south Austin. Can t do 5 stars because they keep upping the price. When I started going they were 1.5 per taco now its 2.5. Still a good price but not AS GOOD as a buck and a half. My suggestion is to stick with the pastor or carne.
El Primo,243,Usually  excellent  chicken with smokey hint   3 star pastor. 5 star speed. This trailer is easy to find despite not being part of a trailer flock. Good line at lunch  but moves reasonably. Red sauce is really good. Regular cook is very generous and cares about quality. Stand in guy...not so much. Chew carefully  today s taco s had chicken bones   stand in guy  too .
El Primo,244,Yo quiero El Primo   These are the tacos you want in your face every morning.  They are the real deal.  Super cheap     We ordered 6 tacos the other day and paid less than  10  gave a good tip .  Good flavor  fast service  good location  south 1st   and did I mention awesome tacos   El pastor and barbacoa tacos with beans are worth a try   The cook owner is nice and is mostly spanish speaking.  The burritos at El Primo are worth trying with el pastor  big  and cheap .  You need to try El Primo.
El Primo,245,This gentleman catered our wedding. Yes  that is how addicted we are to his tacos  he makes killer enchiladas too  just not at his truck . He makes his own chorizo. You can t beat his al pastor. Give him your money.
El Primo,246,Had the asada  chorizo and egg  barbacoa and pastor. This was my lunch. All for freakin   7.75. Amazing. If you want cheap  good eats  this will do it. Great corn tortillas. Within a couple of hours later I was at Izzoz tacos and they had flour tortillas which was nowhere as good. Honestly I lost track of which taco was which  except the chorizo and egg  but I think it was the barbacoa that had a little too many pieces of fat ... not necessarily a bad thing but if not cooked right  not a good thing either. Otherwise I slathered hot sauce on them all which only made things better. Dudes working were so nice too. Give a tip  they deserve it. Nice portions. I eat a lot and 4 tacos were a nice start to the day but for the average person  2 should be a decent lunch.
El Primo,247,El Primo is great  I make it a point to get a couple tacos whenever I m at S. 1st and Live Oak.  The guy is really nice  too.
El Primo,248,Where s the truck    Where s el primo   It has gone missing..... does anyone know its where it is 
El Primo,249,A neighborhood taco stand   Love it  love it  love it   Great fresh breakfast tacos for a buck fifty  but I usually do the pastor-style pork  flavors I have been missing since discovering them in Cancun.  Onions  cilantro  hot sauce  messy good times.  Two of them for  1.75 apiece and I m feeling fat and happy.  Muy bueno 
El Primo,250,I ve had the egg and bean tacos here several times  and every time they rocked   Everything is made to order and it always hot and tasty.  Take them to go  drop into Once Over and buy a drink  and then sit on their back patio and enjoy some serious taco goodness.
El Primo,251,Had a so-delicious carne asada  egg and cheese taco this morning. The salsa roja is delicious.  He makes his own all-beef chorizo - can t wait to try that next. Also the beans  which are seasoned with chorizo spices.  I explained gluten free and El Primo delivered. Yum.
El Primo,252,I live down the block from this place and I m always driving past it. Decided to make a pit stop for a delicious torta  and they delivered. Granted  it was smaller than I hoped  but the flavors I grew up with were all there. I will definitely be stoping more often now. - Don t forget to bring cash.
El Primo,253,We dropped by here on our way out of Austin and I m so glad we did. Tacos were hot off the grill and covered in a mound of melted cheese. I had the migas tacos  they were awesome  My son got a sausage breakfast burrito  I didn t know those even existed in Austin  and it was great too. The folks running the stand were incredibly gracious and work their asses off to serve us some dope tacos. We ll be back 
El Primo,254,Amazing Breakfast  or Lunch  tacos -- my favorite is the migas  sans ham  with extra hot sauce on a corn tortilla. Its  1.75 and blow any other migas taco you ve had out of the water...
El Primo,255,Best tacos in Austin  by far. And so authentic  I love the fresh corn tortillas and open air seating.
El Primo,256,Simply badass tacos and tortas. Unpretentious  cheap  and consistently excellent. Getting a torta and cooling down with an iced coffee at Once Over is my new tradition.
El Primo,257,The best  plain and simple. And Beto who works most days is fantastic and is working to teach me Spanish. Great neighborhood taco truck run by a couple super nice people serving up delicious tacos and tortas with a smile...
El Primo,258,LOVE    This is the kinda place that gives South Austin food trucks a good name.  Your typical  hole-in-the-wall  wouldn t know it s there unless it s pointed out to you taco stand.  The owner is so super nice   amp  he keeps that trailer spic  amp  span clean   And he seasons the beans  vegetarian  with chorizo seasoning--hel-LO delicious  Cheap prices   tasty tacos   a South Austin staple.
El Primo,259,It s so hard to explain why some food just tastes  better . But somehow  EVERYTHING here just tastes  well  BETTER.   I ve had breakfast and lunch there many times. Primo has never let me down...even on a recent 20-degree day  The breakfast burritos are huge    It s hard to finish one...but well worth the effort. And the tortas are out of this world. Fresh food  prepared while you wait  in huge quantities  at low prices. WHAAAAA       In a city known for great Trailer Food  Primo is absolutely a cut above. Give him a try.
El Primo,260,Holy guacamole   I love this place. the best item on the menu is the Pork Torta. I highly recommend it 
El Primo,261,The food is amazing. The service is great. The price is ridiculously affordable.  If you haven t been  get on your bike or in your car and get there immediately.  I can t say enough good things about El Primo.
El Primo,262,Only been once for breakfast tacos  but will be going back for more. Got a chorizo and egg taco and a bacon and egg taco. Both are were really good.   The bacon and eggs were cooked for each order so everything was very hot. Only complaint would be that there was too much cheese  but next time I ll ask for less or skip it altogether.   The guy making the tacos appears to be the owner and he was very friendly.   Will be returning. Note  Closed Sunday.
El Primo,263,Seriously my favorite  authentic tacos in Austin. Simple and delicious.
El Primo,264,first of all i do not like migas at all actually. and secondly somehow my account was used to review a place i have never been to  for a dish i hate. such bad form el primo. tsk tsk
El Primo,265,best migas burrito  its loaded  its satisfying  and best of all its very cheap  4 buckaroos. hope you stop by. oh and if you can  polish your spanish 
El Primo,266,my sister took me here today and it was so good I m considering driving back down there from cedar park for dinner  i dont know whats so great about it  but i had 4 different tacos to try a little bit of everything and i wish i would have ordered 4 more  and I m just not a taco person  so when i told my husband i liked a taco place he almost jumped out of his mexican britches  the guy you order from was super nice and they came out super fast. so happy we went here  yum yum and yum. can t wait to go back. its literally worth the drive from cedar park 
El Primo,267,I used to work in around the corner from this truck and ate there probably 3 times a week.  It was always great. The tortas are super cheap and huge. Al pastor with o amp c  avocado slices and  hot salsa was my staple. The taco guy is really nice too.
El Primo,268,Your food is amazing but for the love of god please learn how to take an order so I never feel like punching a teenager over a taco ever again in my life.
El Primo,269,Honestly  the best tacos around.  We went for breakfast and were just so happy that we had to try lunch.  OMG.  So good.   Every taco we tried was fantastic but I do have to say that the barbacoa meat was hands down the best I ve had in Austin and in Dallas.  Amazingly juicy  tender and flavorful.
El Primo,270,Best Migas taco   Build your own or order from the menu.  Great prices.  Take your tacos to the coffee shop and sit on the patio when the weather is nice.
El Primo,271,I just moved into the 78704 area and decided to go for a walk and look for some good breakfast tacos.  I found El Primo on Yelp and decided to check it out.  I thought it was a restaurant but it is a trailer with 2 outdoor tables next to it.  I had a bean and egg taco and a bacon and egg taco and was happy to hear they always include cheese.  These were the best breakfast tacos I have had in Austin and that is high praise.  I had both their hot red salsa and mild green salsa and also give those very high marks.  I can t wait to try the rest of their menu especially their super-torta.
El Primo,272,The breakfast tacos are insanely delish   Our Austin native friends turned us on to El Primo during a recent visit and we have been craving it ever since.  We love food truck food but are always a bit weary about where and when to give it a try because we have been wrong about our instincts more than once.  This rocks   Asada and pastor are better than anything I have ever tried before in my life.  I think someone else used the word  magic  and I would have to agree  
El Primo,273,awesome tacos. friendly chef server 
La Condesa,1,I do enjoy this place. The location is great in terms of being downtown and there is plenty of parking around but pricy.  In terms of food it s very tasty fancy mainly corn based meals. It s quite pricy which so think can be hard to swim low when eating Mexican food so you have to look at it as something totally different.  Staff has always been great.  Happy hour for drinks is amazing.  Wish they put apps on happy hour.
La Condesa,2,First off I will start with the main point. We had a large party and were told when we made the reservation that we had to do a pre-fixe menu due to the large volume of people.  It was  86 a person before drinks for this pre-fixe menu and I honestly felt ripped off.   The table wasn t quite ready yet when we arrived so we ordered cocktails at the bar while we waiting.  I had a delicious watermelon martin and then they topped it with some whipped creme.  It was good but very syrupy with the watermelon flavor. The table because available and we were seated.  The first course came out and it was a delicious salad. The sad thing was  there was i plate for each 4 guests so you didn t get very much of the salad. The came out the sides which were a small bowl of charro beans  a bowl of noodles with a red sauce and a bowl of corn. The beans were so delicious  I grabbed every bowl I could get my hands on and ate those beans throughout the meal. The noodles were interesting and almost tasted like spagettios. The corn I didn t try but heard from others that it was pretty good. The main corn was put down and again 1 plate to share with 4 guests. There was chicken with some veggies and apparently some steak although I never got any steak.  The chicken was soooo dry and flavorless.  It was like they just put the chicken in an oven and let it cooked with no seasoning at all on it. I went back to the beans. At that time I left to help a friend with a wardrobe  malfunction and went back to the hotel. I missed the churros at the end but heard those were not good as well.   I feel like this was a sad sad meal to pay  86 for  plus my cocktail  to have 2-3 bites of salad and some beans.  From other reviews I see that it is overpriced and not worth the hype.
La Condesa,3,Cool vibes. Food is generally very good.   Food  Shishito peppers - good Shrimp ceviche - good Fish ceviche - good Cochinita pibil - delicious but needed more condiments and more tortillas Mushroom huarache - delicious  Barbacoa tamal - delicious  Tres leches - delicious
La Condesa,4,Extremely underwhelmed by this place that is spoken of so much.   The portion sizes are tiny. Our huarache had too much hot sauce and was all of 4 bites  without having a reason to be  18. Cocktails were quite basic and good thing we didn t pay the full  18 as we went for happy hour  when they offer half off all cocktails.   I ve had a much better oaxacan old fashioned. At this pricing and target audience  at least use the right ice and not basic crushed ice for an old fashioned.   Decor is beautiful especially the light fixtures  but what s up with the cheap plastic chairs  This place has so much potential but fell flat today.
La Condesa,5,I went here for brunch on Saturday with friends. We really enjoyed everything we ordered. The inside is so cute and aesthetic. I understand it s a farm to table restaurant  so the price point is kind of high. I wish we could ve split the bill with different cards. But overall we enjoyed our experience.
La Condesa,6,Came here for a Sunday night dinner for 6 people and was unbelievably frustrated with this place.  For one  the menu is completely different than their one on open table and online. Twice as expensive and completely different so be ready for that.  Our waiter didn t come for the first 20 minutes so I went to bother the hostess after a while to ask her who was taking care of. I asked 4 separate times to turn down the music because we were screaming across the table to hear each other. We ordered 2 bottles of wine which took forever to come and they were always confused on what was in stock  telling us different things. Kept forgetting things like giving us plates  more tortillas when I asked for them  etc.   The food ended up being good but I was so frustrated with the horrible horrible service I was honestly just stressed the whole time because I had made the reservation and everyone in my party was visibly frustrated. Also just way overpriced.   It s a shame because this place is cool and has so much potential but I m never coming here again.
La Condesa,7,Made a reservation at this place for Saturday night dinner at 5 15  yes  that early because we have a baby . Let me tell you  the Austin restaurant scene is wild. I looked a few weeks in advance and many restaurants were booked especially for outdoor seating  which is what we wanted. La Condesa had an opening  which is why we initially chose the place. The restaurant is pretty trendy and caters to a young  hip crowd  I guess that can be said for most of Austin however . We started with spicy margaritas  which were delicious and their guacamole  which came with these thick blue tortilla chips  also delicious. I did not however enjoy my barbacoa as it was very fatty and salty although to be fair I think barbacoa is generally fatty. My husband ordered two different types of ceviche and they were both amazing so that made up for it.
La Condesa,8,Excellent experience. I read the reviews and was hesitant to check it out  but I am so glad we did. Highly recommend the shishito peppers and carnitas  Great margaritas too. Not surprised at the high prices  but still.  8 cans of beer is not fun.
La Condesa,9,My family and I visit La Condesa on last evening we had a Birthday dinner for one of our family members. The food was delicious and I would definitely recommend this restaurant
La Condesa,10,Really good Mexican restaurant in the heart of downtown Austin. If you are looking for a little nicer Mexican restaurant in downtown  this would be 1 of 5 spots to go In downtown in my opinion.  The ambiance is nice  the staff is extremely friendly  and the food and drinks are really great.  We ordered the Carne Asada plate  shishito peppers  and Hamachi Ceviche  all wonderful and delicious. The carne asana plate was a little more expensive then what we were expecting  but quite honestly  it s a lot of food and well worth it for the flavors.  Definitely recommend checking this place out and j will definitely be back
La Condesa,11,La Condesa is a total package experience  The place is so beautiful  the staff is friendly  menu is great  and a groovy vibe. Stopped by there yesterday  and we were greeted with a friendly lady who made our happy hour super amazing. We ve been patrons of La Condesa for years  and it s always fantastic  Love IT 
La Condesa,12,I went to La Condesa for happy hour which is half-off all alcoholic beverages from Wednesday-Saturday 4pm-6pm.  The first drink I had was a Spicy Margarita. It was excellent. The drink was the perfect level of spicy and it tasted very fresh.   Then  I had the Paloma La Condea   14 . It included Reposado tequila  grapefruit  lime  and jarritos grapefruit soda. I did not enjoy this drink because it had too strong of a sharp  sour taste.   The drinks are costly at about  15-18 each. I would suggest going for happy hour when they are half off.   The ambiance of the restaurant is bright  fun  and upscale.   Our service was average. There were times when we had to wave our waiter over after he did not check our table for about 25 minutes. We were asked to leave because they needed our table for the next reservation. However  he was happy to answer our questions about the menu.   Overall  I would consider going back to La Condesa for Happy Hour. I think the prices are too high otherwise.
La Condesa,13,An Interior Mexican-inspired downtown restaurant that offers some generally solid cocktails  some great dishes  and a few iffy ones.  I ve been here a total of three times since arriving in Austin in August  mostly due to the generally good food and cocktails offered. Many of the  from the land  offerings are solid. As someone who s a fan of mole  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pollo mole. I ve also tried some of the dishes with beef and pork  and they were also very good.   The  from the sea  plates are somewhat more hit-or-miss. For instance  both of the ceviches are some of my favorite dishes offered here. However  on a recent visit  we ordered the mussels based on the recommendation of the server  and the mussels were downright funky. I mean really funky. To truly accurately describe how these critters tasted  I would need to compare them to some truly vile things and I think I would easily violate Yelp s terms of service  so I ll just leave it there  this dish is to be avoided at all costs.  I m normally a big fan of mussels .  A few other quibbles about this place  for one  the prices are pretty steep for what you end up receiving. There is a high level of variability in terms of quality on the menu  so to get your money s worth  you really need to do your research to know what is good and what you ll like. As with most other place downtown  parking is something to be planned for ahead of your visit  else you might end up doing circles for 15 minutes looking for parking.  Overall  there are some good things here  but it s not at the top of my list of places I d recommend.
La Condesa,14,We came here bc we were catching a late show at the moody theatre. This place is on the next block. I was taking my father out for his birthday and they don t live in austin anymore. The food was not great. I was reminded of why I don t come here... It was also so expensive. We could have gone to Uchi and had our minds blown for the 400  we spent here.  The only thing note worthy was the queso  then again how do you mess up queso  We did have to pay extra for more tortillas to be able to finish it though.  We got the cochinita pabil  it was so salty I didn t eat it.  The mole chicken was good but impossible to cut up without using your hands and making a mess. The last thing was their margarita pitchers  They were actually quite good but for 10 Rita s it was 170  so 2 each... the rim the glasses had was extra good... lime salt sweet yum.
La Condesa,15,We had great servers  Great food   Wonderful memories were made   Queso flamiado with chorizo fantastic   Small corn tortillas wonderful   Cochinita pibil is the way to go   Carnitas great spice   Rib meat quesadilla knocks your socks off   Margaritas  so very good   Tres leches and churros finished off the magical dining experience   You need to drop in this joint fir so great food   I recommend reservations
La Condesa,16,Why 4 stars   Really cute spot in the downtown area with some great food.   We had a large group so tried it all.  Guac  corn  queso were all great apps. The papas were spicy for sure so beware.   Carnitas tacos were moist and served on blue corn tortillas. Small tortilla but packed with meat.   Pineapple Margaritas were the drink of choice and how do you not get a churro to close out the meal. Would def go back 
La Condesa,17,Overpriced yes  however  the food is incredible.   Authentic dishes made well should be their slogan.   Guacamole is lemony and good. Their tostadas  chips  are sort of hard to chew.   Huitlacoche Quesadilla is so good and a great way to introduce this dish to your Huitlacoche newbies.   Huarache de Barbacoa is also great.   These dishes are small but weirdly filling. We all left satisfied but definitely would be hungry after an hour.
La Condesa,18,The food and service was good. The portions was a good size to share with two teenage girls and myself. The agua Fresca was a bit thick  but I enjoyed the flavors overall a good early dinner on a fun day in Austin.
La Condesa,19,Food is tasty  but if you want to be nickeled and dimed this is the place to be.  3 for an extra  thimble worth of picked onions  or an extra thimble worth of beans. Oh  and extra tortillas were and extra  5  and chips to go with the guac is an extra  1  no  the guac doesn t come with any chips  though they are suggested by the server. Maybe the chef intended us to just dig in with a spoon  . I ve been here in years past  but this will be the last time I come here. Maybe they are catering to those on expense accounts only. Definitely not looking to become a community institution  even though they could have had potential  as their practices would be infuriating to most patrons. Perhaps they should survey their customers to see if they are one time only patrons or return guests.
La Condesa,20,This place is just... Not good.  18     dollar cocktails   16 for guac and kevlar chips  nothing here seemed worth the price. Small portions  oversalted  overpriced. Avoid.  Service was good  adds a star.
La Condesa,21,Frozen signature - Super refreshing and fun spot for happy hour  Very large tequila menu and good recommendations
La Condesa,22,Amazing umami flavors. Good options for adventurous vegetarian eaters. I recommend coming in with an open mind and an empty belly  and you will leave with platitudes of knowledge and volumes of wisdom to share with family and friends
La Condesa,23,I m shocked this place only has 3.5 stars. I can understand not liking the price of the food  but it s quite honestly worth every dollar.   I ve traveled the world eating Mexican food and this place still ranks up there as one of the better places I ve been.   Great drinks  good sauces  steak was cooked PERFECTLY  fantastic service.   Not sure what else you can ask for 
La Condesa,24,This place was absolutely fantastic. Friendly servers  quick service  and delicious food. One of our top favorite meals of all time.
La Condesa,25,Came for happy hour where drinks are half off and got the condesa marg which was very tasty. Would definitely recommend happy hour as it is usually 18  a drink. Also got the sikil pak as recommended by the server and it was very good and spicy.
La Condesa,26,Love the food service and atmosphere  They recently did a menu change with higher prices which is understandable because I m sure rent in Austin has gone up and covid business but I am missing some of the old menu items 
La Condesa,27,Love this place  It s so cute and fun. And the food is delicious  Definitely get the Tuna Tostada  tacos  and short rib quesadilla. All incredible   Super flavorful. I d say skip the  Green Goddess  this is how it s described   Confit fennel  pickled mustard seed  preserved lemon.  But it s mostly potatoes that aren t listed. Lol Also  the drinks are insanely expensive  18 Margaritas. BUT there s a great happy hour during the week. So do that if you want cheaper drinks. Overall  it s a GREAT spot for dinner with friends or family in DT ATX 
La Condesa,28,Service  A  Food taste  B Food presentation  A  Price to Value  D-   Would I recommend it  Maybe.  Will I personally go back  Never.
La Condesa,29,Loved the margarita  Also got the Sikil pak snack it was very tasty and spicy  I would only knock it a star because the prices are pretty steep.
La Condesa,30,This review is all about the customer service we recieved this evening. Zach our waiter went above and beyond to make us happy   The food is unique for sure.
La Condesa,31,Do you want to feel confused about what just happened to your wallet and why it feels lighter and your stomach feels empty  Then this is definitely the place for you.   I ll start off on a good note though  the spicy pisco sour was a great cocktail and I definitely enjoyed it  the food was another story... I got the short rib quesadilla and definitely expected a lot more for the price  it just tasted bland to the point where I was thinking..  OMG do I have covid   Did i just lose my taste buds    And definitely expected a little but more food. Chicken tacos  comes in a plate of 3  were also ordered and if you put the next to a half dollar coin... you might not know which is which based on size. Tiny tacos  big price and the flavor was mediocre    Def skip this place and get your tex-mex mexican  fix elsewhere  but good place for a drink 
La Condesa,32,My boyfriend and I have come here at least 5 times in the past few months and absolutely love this place. I ve been putting off this review because I don t believe I will be able to do this place justice. So instead of trying  I m going to list all the things that this place does right  - Kind  friendly  and knowledgable servers - AMAZING food - we re both vegetarians and we love the flamiado  sikil pak  and papas - None of the food has disappointed us  - They make menu changes every once in while which helps keep things fresh - As the Zoomers would say   the vibes are immaculate  - Drinks are super yummy - I always start off the watermelon martini. Yes  I said start off with - Can be pricy but happy hour makes things a lot more affordable  - MASSIVE list of mezcal and tequilas  - The last time we came here  our server forget to put in an order for one of our dishes and she was incredibly apologetic and even sent us a free item   I could go on and on but check it out for yourself 
La Condesa,33,La Condesa has been in my bookmarks for a while  so I m glad I got to visit with some of my friends. We ordered drinks  an appetizer  and individual entrees. Their food is honestly really solid. I enjoyed my drink  the guacamole appetizer  and all of my friends  entrees were really good too. Service was great  and the interior is quite pretty.
La Condesa,34,literally the grossest spicy margarita ever. Service bartender on Friday nights in the upstairs bar with the beard is a bad guy. Same with the waitress. 9 30 evening.
La Condesa,35,Was my first time going with Friends but wow it was so nice..    The atmosphere  amp  the food was quite good too but a little smaller portions but that s okay  their mango margaritas were soo good..  
La Condesa,36,La Condesa is a high end Mexican restaurant in downtown. It offers both indoor and patio seating  and it has an upstairs for events  My party had a wonderful evening filled with good drinks and food. The menu is farm-to-table so it s constantly changing but the menu this week was great  The queso was delicious  and the carne asada definitely stole the show. We also tried the ceviche and loved it. Forewarning  the portions are small so this isn t a place to come to when you re ravenous.
La Condesa,37,Would not recommend. Service was really bad. Food was also very meh. Did not even eat most of it. I would rather go to Suerte for the price. Looks like most people here are from out of town so that explains it.
La Condesa,38,Had this food for a rehearsal dinner so I cannot discuss the price. However the cocktails were delicious and the Barbacoa was the best thing I have ever eaten.
La Condesa,39,Yummy margueritas but the snarkiest host who was reluctant to seat us in the nearly empty outdoor area  inattentive waiter  food that arrived long before the drinks  and we literally had to be about he server for our bill. Also  no warning about the red chili oil that made our food nearly inedible. The upside is we met cool locals at the next table. But the service here is a nightmare. Skip.
La Condesa,40,Overall  ... JUST okay. Loved the location and the atmosphere. The service was great and everyone was very kind.   We went on a Wednesday night and made a reservation for 3 just incase. It didn t get too busy  so I doubt a reservation would be needed on a random weeknight.   The food - EVERYTHING  and I mean everything we got was over salted. Was the whole kitchen recovering from COVID that they completely lost their taste    I was shocked at how salty the Guac  chips  they were also VERY thick  the carnitas tacos  chicken salad and the quesadilla were. The only think that wasn t over salted was the mild salsa  which was delish.   Overall not impressed and most likely wont be returning.
La Condesa,41,Past it s prime and fading fast. They changed their menu to clearly try to compete with the superior ATX Cocina down the street. Service was poor  meal was super pricey for what you get.   Surprised it made it thru the pandemic but can t see it lasting a long time. Improve now or die a slow death.
La Condesa,42,I have never had such delicious and fresh corn tortilla.  Servers are so efficient and warm.  I ordered a drink  I forgot the name  but it was the best I ve had.
La Condesa,43,I went to La Condesa ten years ago for my birthday and had a wonderful meal. I moved away from Austin but always remembered the experience there. When my husband and I were planning a weekend stay in Austin I knew exactly where to go.   We had a lovely albeit sweaty dinner there on Saturday evening. We opted for outdoor seating and although there was shade there wasn t much air movement or fans. Our server  Jamie  was fantastic. Personable  knowledgeable  and helpful. We ordered the queso  carnitas tacos  barbacoa huarache  zanahorias  and tres leches cake. The chips and queso were good but not the typical queso we are used to. The carnitas tacos were a grand slam  maybe the best I ve had. The barbacoa huarache was very good but not mind blowing like the tacos. The zanahorias were tasty but for  15ish we were surprised to get just 2 carrots. The tres leches cake comes with seasonal fruit compote. In our case it was peach. With the biscuity nature of the cake and the peaches it was more like a tres leches peach cobbler  which we loved.
La Condesa,44,I was a bit hesitant to try this place because it only has 3.5 stars for a seemingly trendy spot. However  a friend highly recommended it  so we gave it a shot. We had a 7 15p reservation on a Thursday night and that seemed to be prime time because we still had to wait a tad when we got there. The ambience and decor were pretty cool and just good vibes all around. We were seated on the upper patio which was a little awkward because it was very silent lol compared to the rest of the restaurant. And there were only two other parties in our area.   The service is very professional and everything seemed very clean. As far as COVID safety goes  I think it s about average.  Ok  the food  amp  drinks.  EL CUBICO  My partner got this and fell in love. I m typically not a fan of tequila or vanilla but this also won me over. Awesome drink   SPICY PISCO SOUR  I love pisco sours so I naturally gravitated towards this cocktail. Right before we ordered  I saw another table get them and they served in martini glasses  which was a first for me. That should ve been a sign. It s not terrible. But it s not great. It just didn t taste...complete.  CEVICHE DE PESCADO  As described on the menu  this is very lemon-y. The pieces of lemon was just a bit too much. Otherwise  it was very tasty and I loved the habanero oil.  CHAPULINES  I saw the word  grasshoppers  and knew we had to order them. It was our first time having insects so we we re super stoked to try this. The dish came with little tortillas for us to make our own tacos and it was pretty good. Heavy on the roasted flavors and super crispy  which pairs well with the guacamole.  SHORT RIB QUESADILLA  I think this may have been my favorite part of our meal. The short rib was done perfectly and there s little room for error after that.  FRIED PESCADO  This was a bit disappointing. The fish tasted bland - a little bit on the dry side. But half of it was not cooked. The thinner half that we ate first was well done  but the thicker half was raw in the middle so we didn t eat it.  All in all  I probably would not come back nor recommend this spot for dinner. Maybe for a drink or brunch 
La Condesa,45,We came in for drinks and an appetizer. What I noticed immediately was that none of the staff were smiling. Weird. We were seated and the place is cool  have to give them that.  We ordered the salsa and guac sampler   20. Which seams pretty steep and considering if you want a refill on any salsas it is an additional  1. We ordered drinks too. Good drinks I must say. I had a margarita first and then was told about the Alma Blanca. Habanero-infused blanco  I in  Damn that was a good drink  Had a couple of those bad boys.  Not sure what the rest of the menu might have been like. But I would recommend that they get the staff to smile  be happy 
La Condesa,46,Food was fantastic  but the service was  hands down  terrible. Drinks came after appetizers  plates were cleared and never got new ones  even silverware took multiple asks... Again  food was great  but service makes this barely a 2-star.
La Condesa,47,This is my favorite spot to go for special occasions. Their happy hour is phenomenal all those are half off during that time. Regardless of where you sit the atmosphere is beautiful. Their ceviche is always on point and there is usually a couple of options. I can t wait for them to be done renovating so I can return.
La Condesa,48,Y all... Sophie the manager. I would give 10 stars if I could  It was my best friends bday and last minute our reservations fell through elsewhere. We came to la condesa on a whim on a Friday night at prime time and they fit us in. As if that wasn t good enough  the manager was our waitress because they were short staffed. She sold us on a spicy margarita pitcher  tequila shots  3 different appetizers  queso flameado was delicious   and entrees. THEN she brought us mezcal shots  elote appetizer  delicious    and 2 different desserts. Talk about amazing service when everywhere is short staffed. This place has my business for life  and hopefully yours too  Thank you Sophie   
La Condesa,49,EDIT  just noticed that the Chicken en Mole says  30 on the menu but I was charged  32   First time at La Condesa. Overall  experience was mediocre. I ordered a Manhattan   13 -- strong so   and we started with the chips  amp  guacamole which was  14 and nothing special for the price  I wish they had the sampler like I saw in previous reviews  . I ordered the Chicken en Mole   30  -- portion was good and filling. It came with a side of   a thin version  sour cream  avocado  and tortillas. It was ok but nothing memorable. I also wish it came with some rice to make it a little more heartier but that might just be me. Good but nothing makes me want to come back.
La Condesa,50,Over priced and underwhelmed.  Food portions small.  The most fairly priced thing her are the drinks.  Tuna tostada laughably small for  15.   10 for 5 small churros is also ridiculous.  Homeless people bathing with water bottles right next to tables.
La Condesa,51,I had to take a star off because they need to get their communication together.   We were rolling around looking for dessert and I saw in the window the special was tres leches and that is the main reason I went in but the server had no clue that they had it. After much confusion  I had a slice and it was damn good    The best I have ever had.
La Condesa,52,This is a bit late. My visit was in May 2019  but I find myself being invited to another dinner here and was instantly triggered by my first experience...  The concept of this place is really cool. Love the farm to table Mexican. HOWEVER. If you re going to do farm to table  please make sure you thoroughly wash your greens.   I had a nice little slimy friend  snail  crawling through the micro greens of one of my tacos. Luckily one of the folks in my group spotted it while I was photographing my plate  just before I was going to dig in  otherwise I may have eaten it -_- . Snails  while friendly creatures  can carry parasites and other diseases harmful to humans. Not ok.   Our waiter was super causal about the whole situation. Hardly apologized. Said it was of no surprise since food is brought in fresh from the farm daily. They quickly brought me a new plate  granted it looked as if they just replaced the taco. And still proceeded to charge for it.
La Condesa,53,Amazing experience with our server today and the delicious food   Try their sea salt on drink rim  superb   Awesome brunch time 
La Condesa,54,La condesa is a staple for ATX.  My out of town guest made brunch reservations for a little food and cocktails. I have a mixed review. Some of the food items were incredible some boring .   Guacamole was incredible and perfectly made. I don t love guacamole but could not help finding another chip for a dip. I had chilliquitos which were ok. My buddy had mole chicken which was awesome.  You will not walk out unhappy but the experience can vary. Margaritas top notch.
La Condesa,55,Loved the drinks  Solid margarita and pisco sour. The tortilla chips were very thick- wasn t used to it- wasn t  bad  but none of us really ate them. The meat in all our meals was pretty salty. But fun atmosphere  good wait staff. The churros were amazing  Definitely recommend
La Condesa,56,By far the best Mexican restaurant in all of Austin  The food was absolutely amazing  and our waitress Mary was phenomenal She really gave you and understanding of what the food is going to taste like she should honestly host her own food show on TV LOL. Everything from the drinks to the appetizer to the main course was delicious  Leave room for dessert  The tres leche cake and the churros were amazing  This restaurant is a must when visiting Austin  We will be back when in town 
La Condesa,57,Quintessential  interior mexican cuisine  with really good margaritas.   I ll start with the margaritas  bc well that s how i always start. They don t have a huge variety but what they have they do really well.  I appreciate that they stay away from margarita mixes or triple sec so it s lower in sugar. The food is served tapas style so as most places like this you should just all agree to go in on a several small plates and share.  The food is good enough for the prices which although kind of on the upper end are pretty much on par with any other place downtown.   It s worth noting  the staff are always really friendly.  I think it helps that the place is relatively small so they don t seem overburdened with too many tables or in a rush even though you re in a pretty busy area.
La Condesa,58,I m kind of surprised by the 3.5 star rating for this spot because the food is tasty and it s a cool corner spot that on a Thursday night was pretty subdued. The guacamole tasting was a lot of fun  pretty much enjoyed all of the sauces and the guacamoles. I wish they had a spicy one instead of the crab because none of them really had heat.   The ceviche was light  fresh  tangy  and had a nice avocado whip to add some creaminess. Great for sharing.  The menu is a little confusing as there isn t a clear demarcation of appetizers and mains really  but I went with the quesadilla and really enjoyed it. Very different from other quesadillas as it has a very crispy exterior  but it s stuffed to the brim and the salsa cuts through. Honestly wasn t really any dish I wouldn t share again.
La Condesa,59,The interior design is cool.  Their menu wasn t super vegan friendly. They had one vegan taco option which I ordered.  I asked for it to have no tomatoes which the server said it couldn t be made without tomatoes.  Then  the guacamole was  12   For a very small dish.   The tacos were good but small. The rice  amp  beans were flavorless.   For these prices  go to Tortchy s for tacos  amp  guac.
La Condesa,60,This place was amazing and Mary was THE best server    She hooked us up with some fabulous suggestions from the menu  but also hooked us up with all the places to see and other restaurants in Austin   Thank you Mary   We had an amazing weekend in Austin due to your good tips and so glad we started it all out here.
La Condesa,61,Service  great Margs  great  Food  worst meal we have ever had.  N O JOKE. We looked at the reviews and thought the reviews must be exaggerated.  We go to lots of nice meals in Dallas so we are used to tiny portions. THESE ARE TINY.   The cervihce was 3 thin slices covered by tons of onions to mask its lacking.. my first my bite was... legit.... So bad I almost spit it out. It tasted like I took a bite of a lime. Yes a lime....NOT EVEN KIDDING   Pork rib quesadilla- good flavor but under cooked tortilla so it was soggy.   We don t complain ever but this was by far the worst. They most annoying part... it was sooooo expensive for the worst meal we have ever had. Our bill was  160 for two apps and two meals.  2 drinks each    Our bill isn t even that much at nick and Sam s in Dallas   We laughed about it being our worst experience in our 5 year relationship. My boyfriend who doesn t ever review has asked me 5 times today if I have reviewed our dinner last night..... that means it was BAD.
La Condesa,62,Who likes Mexican food  I do  As much as I like to enjoy Mexican dishes from a food truck or a mom  amp  pop store  sometimes I want to enjoy it at a beautiful and colorful restaurant. La Condesa downtown ATX hits the spot  The masa they use to make their corn tortillas is so fragrant  yes  I sniffed it up close    They source their corn from Oaxaca  Mexico and make their tortillas fresh. I m not kidding- the scent    When you go  you must have their chips and guacamole tasting  you d have a hard time to pick a favorite   P. S. Their head chef Rick Lopez also spins tunes at MyKUTX 98.9  now that s a fun fact 
La Condesa,63,Great place to go get a bite to eat. The staff is amazing. Very friendly and great. We ordered the chips and guacamole tasting  Huevos Condesa  and Huevos Rancheros   So delicious. Every bite was amazing. Worth checking out when in the area.
La Condesa,64,Had a taco lunch and guacamole flight here with my friend while in Austin last weekend.  She really wanted me to try their tacos so we snuck in about 20 minutes before they closed the kitchen at lunch time and sat at the bar.   The bartender took care of us and was pretty friendly - apparently at lunch they only have two types of tacos - a vegetarian squash and a chicken - so we both decided to get one each of those - with rice and beans - and the guac.  My friend substituted a small side salad instead of the rice and beans and it was delicious - greens with a yummy house dressing that I ended up eating.    The guac sampler was good - but most of the guac I didn t like - one had crab meat  one was plain  one had a hot mole type sauce on it  and it had a few salsa dips.  I could ve done without.    The tacos were good and the rice and beans were REALLY good.    Nice ambience inside as it s very trendy  clean  and well-kept.  The bathrooms are spacious and spotless.   They had some avocado ice cream sandwiches on the menu I d have liked to tried for dessert but we had eaten so much during my visit that we just couldn t do it.  Next time 
La Condesa,65,If I could give this place zero stars I would. Pretty sure the server took way too much of something and was practicing his Spanish pronunciations. The portions were not only small but also awful. I could have made the quesadilla I ordered on an iron in my hotel room. Also the fact that they gave us stale tostadas for our guac and proceeded to charge three dollars for sour cream is atrocious. Honestly  please just shut it down. I m begging.
La Condesa,66,Food and drinks were great  Tacos and queso deserve five stars  A littlee expensive but Ive had similar food for more in Austin.
La Condesa,67,Superb  Wow wow wow  So glad that we decided to risk it and give this place a go. The pictures and Instagram account look amazing and so I was surprised to see a sub 4 star rating on Yelp.   Had a reservation on Sunday at around noon  and while the crowd wasn t terrible it was great being able to be seated right away.  First of  the decorum and music was awesome the whole time. Staff was prompt and communicative in both their explanations of the menu and customer service.   The Huevos Rancheros were so          good I could go for another round just thinking about it. Delicious sauce and perfectly cooked  I had trouble not just inhaling it.   Lastly their Dulce Pudding Cake was sooooooo gooooodddd. Literally mouth watering and was savory in flavor depth and appearance. Just stunning.  P.S. Their classic margaritas are great as well. Come through and do yourself a favor 
La Condesa,68,Should have listened to all of my fellow Yelpers.  Ambience gets a 4  I liked it and it is a great place visually. The rest of this establishment are all 1 stars.   Our server was pretty good  nice personality and really it s mostly the kitchens faults for these errors. He was nice and tried to fix the mistakes.   Food. We spent around  220 for 4 people with a few drinks including tip.   We ordered two kinds of ceviche  the steak  chicken  tamale  the meatballs  chips and queso along with salsa.   The queso and ceviche were the better tasting of all other items. The tamale was cold. The meatballs were rubbery and hard overcooked  I had one bite because I didn t want them to go to waste. The steak was cold as well not much flavor. The chicken was fine nothing spectacular.   The most frustrating part is we were trying to properly entertain clients and it was a bad experience and not a good impression for us.   Granted the manager did comp the few items that we sent back which she should have and it was the right thing to do. I didn t take food pics because we were in a biz meeting but I got a few prior. For the price and experience  definitely not worth it.   One positive to end the weather was nice but no one can control that. Too bad for this review I really wanted to like it.
La Condesa,69,Awesome food   Really good cocktails and amazing and knowledgeable bartenders.  More obscure tequila varieties than I ve seen in a single location.  Good stuff.
La Condesa,70,Fabulous   Great Mexico City type Mexican food--fabulous margaritas--great service --fun vibe
La Condesa,71,I really  really wanted to give La Condesa a higher rating  especially after being completely blown away by a meal here a couple years ago. I was back in Austin this weekend and so excited to try this place again but was very disappointed in the food.   We had the guacamole and salsa platter to try them all. They were all good  but not very different from each other. It was just the classic guac x4 with different toppings. We also had the shishito peppers and chicken taquitos which were good. The main dish we split was the Pollo En Mole and it was so disappointing. The  1 4 chicken  was just a tiny leg and thigh with hardly any meat at all  only a few bites for both of us. The sauce was thin and extremely bland - I think it was 60  water. It was served with these gooey tortilla balls that took up most of the plate and tasted like nothing. For  26  this was a HUGE disappointment.   If La Condesa changes their menu again I might come back  but for now there s definitely better Mexican food to be found.
La Condesa,72,Enjoyed the experience here  There seem to be reviews all over the place  but my friend who was visiting had heard great things and we had a very good time. Decor is great and awesome location. Recommend the chips and salsa-you get 4 different salsas to try and they were all good. We split the pescado tacos. It is served as a large piece of fish with tortillas on the side. It was solidly good  but could have been nice to have more sauce to put on the tacos  maybe just my preference . Wasn t inexpensive but reasonable with splitting the entree.
La Condesa,73,So freakin good     Last night we came here and didn t even realize it was happy hour. We had amazing drinks and the food. ...wow  it did not disappoint  Short rib quesadillas  barbacoa huarache  carnitas tacos  a fish dish  and churros  WOW   All sooo tasty     10 10   
La Condesa,74,Out of all the places we visited in Austin  this one was our least favorite. Had a longer wait time with no bar seating to wait at. Pretty pricey for the portions you receive. Ordered the ceviche and the tostadas that came with it were ROCK SOLID. Asked if there was tortilla chips or something different to get instead. The waitress brought us their soft corn tortillas. At the end we got charged for those tortillas..... But at least their carnitas tacos were yummy.  Not worth the    .
La Condesa,75,We had a great late night dinner here. We did the guac   salsa tasting  the NY strip taquitos  the tostada primavera  and the queso fundido. The taquitos and tostada were both great  the eggplant on the tostada was amazing   and several of the guacs   salsas were excellent -- I really loved the crab meat and the chipotle puree guacs in particular. My wife really liked the queso fundido.  I stole the half-avocado that comes on top.   Overall  really good food for decent prices  to a New Yorker  at least   and enough volume to leave me hurting when I went to bed.  The guac   salsa tasting is a sneaky large amount of food. 
La Condesa,76,Though taste definitely did not disappoint  quantity did   .  Service  amp  atmosphere  the space is very trendy while still remaining warm and open. Service was phenomenal and we were seated much earlier than expected  which was a happy surprise.  Food  so between the guacamole sampler  tacos  hamachi  I cannot really recall anything standing out  though nothing was lackluster either. After all of the small bites  however  my group was definitely not full enough to take on the night of drinking that lay ahead of us.   Come unhungry and leave happy 
La Condesa,77,Overall experience wasn t bad. I wait staff was attentive but the portions were small for the price.  Also very frustrating they couldn t split the bill for the table. They made us figure it out which is always a damper on the evening
La Condesa,78,by far my favorite interior mexican food in austin.  my only critique is that the quesadilla was uber uber salty and even though it was a friends birthday they didn t even put a candle or anything on the dessert we ordered.
La Condesa,79,Some of the best carne asada ribeye we have ever had. All around a great experience and highly recommend.
La Condesa,80,It was a great service  limited menu and what we had was fantastic. Our night consisted of Chip  amp  Guac  Ceviche  and entree s for  2  Steak Tampiquena served on a large plate in its juices with a minimalist approach to the habanero  onion giardiniera. Warm  not hot  and my definition is not going to do it justice. Sorry. In addition  we had hongos and chicken mole  both very good.
La Condesa,81,Over priced for food that needs to have salt added to get some flavor. Small portions. Drinks were good. Homeless interaction while dinning outside was annoying. No mas  
La Condesa,82,The atmosphere of the restaurant is artsy  and contemporary. The drinks were great-- especially their pi a colada which was smooth and well balanced.  With COVID  they had a limited menu. We got the chips and salsa  which was less than great. The salsa is pur ed and is almost like a creamy sauce  which was not what I was hoping for. The chips were large and chunky  with the taste of a frito corn chip rather than a tortilla chip. We had the carnitas tacos which-- I cannot stress enough-- were AMAZING. Great flavor  house made tortillas  they came with three small tacos. The shrimp tacos were also a hit.   Definitely a place I ll come back to.
La Condesa,83,This restaurant was great  Went there for my husbands birthday for Sunday Brunch. Wait staff was polite and efficient. They even let our 2 boys back in the kitchen to see what goes on there  We will definitely be back   
La Condesa,84,We eat here before every show at The Moody.  The menu is creative and bold with flavor profiles that you simply won t find anywhere else.  Moreover  the cocktails are wonderfully inventive.  Finally  the service has always been stellar.  Because of the above  La Condesa has become one our go to restaurant s in downtown Austin.
La Condesa,85,More contemporary and upmarket take on Mexican cuisine but the flavors still pack a nice punch with lovely cocktails to boot.   Great for Sunday brunch as it is for an intimate happy hour. Brunch is bright and airy best enjoyed with a margarita and some guacamole to start. The namesake brunch dish  the huevos condesa  is a hearty  serving of duck fat potatoes  chicken  bacon fried southern greens  topped with fried eggs and salsa. A satisfying dish for brunch.   Cozy bar area for a quick drink and bar snack in the front. Great for a cocktail like a watermelon elderflower martini and some light bites like a yellowfin tuna tostada. All in  a refined take on Mexican cuisine at La Condesa.
La Condesa,86,Did I eat the food  No.  When we arrived to eat. Your hostess told us  We re done.   I had to ask say   Excuse me .  She then says   Our brunch is closed  we aren t sitting anyone.  My wife looked at me kinda like wth. It wasn t a good first impression. Training may be needed it seems. In La Condesa in Mexico City we had better service. Was really looking forward to it   
La Condesa,87,I was really looking forward to coming here- heard the food was amazing  However  we had horrible service. It took 20 minutes to order drinks  forever to get the drinks  and no service in between. Super bummed. We were there for an hour and fifteen minutes and only ordered apps because of how little our server came to the table. Disappointed
La Condesa,88,Enjoyed a delicious dinner at La Condesa on Monday evening. I was blown away by the wonderful food  especially the incredible ceviche.  Quality  Stumbled upon La Condesa looking for a place to enjoy a drink and something to nibble on. I went with the unique Mezcal Sour to drink  which mixed mezcal  orange  egg white  and sal de gusano. My girlfriend chose a reliable classic in their Pina Colada  which hit the spot on a warm evening. To go with it we ordered Chips  amp  Salsa  a Tostada De Atun  and a Rockfish Ceviche. I loved the four different salsas that came with the chips allowing eat bite to be different. The Tostada De Atun was excellent  and the chipotle mayo and habanero mustard gave it a nice zing. But the highlight of the meal was the Rockfish Ceviche. A fresh dish as part of their summer menu  it was perfection. A wonderful balance of sweetness and heat with good texture. Do not skip the ceviche when you visit. Quantity  Small plates  but more than enough for an evening snack. Value   12 for a Pina Colada.  12 for a Mezcal Sour.  5 for Chips  amp  Salsa.  15 for the Tostada De Atun.  16 for a Rockfish Ceviche.  Ambiance  La Condesa is located in Downtown Austin. The space has an odd arrangement. There are two outside areas  one along the sidewalk and another raised patio area. Inside there appeared to be two floors  but lots of ledges and steps created even more layers of seating. It seemed like they often host large parties  so private dining areas were available. The space is bright and colorful  and I imagine is popular for any meal from brunch to dinner. Crowd  A few couples and one large group enjoying dinner and drinks. Service  We arrived late in the evening  near closing  but the staff could not have been more accommodating. Parking  Street parking is very limited and the nearby garage is pricey.
La Condesa,89,Overall a great atmosphere and great location but pretty average food.  We started with the chips and salsas and Queso fundido. I really liked the smoky salsa and basically stuck to that with the chips and I think a Wizard made the Queso it was so good and stringy. I wish they had a couple more tortillas though because we ran out and that was a bummer.   For entree I got the huevos rancheros which was decent. The sauce was tomato based and had a good smoky flavor but there wasn t many beans in there.   Waiter brought me the wrong drink so I m not sure what the Paloma is like but the Margarita is fairly solid.
La Condesa,90,This place was super cute and trendy  The gauc and salsa sampler were just ok. The ceviche  the beef cheek and the shrimp were amazing. The Fresca was ok. Margs were really good. I wish everything had been on point since we spent  200 plus but seriously...get the ceviche...
La Condesa,91,The shrimp we ordered was delicious  but the steak was just mediocre. I didn t really like how you had to pay extra for tortillas  as those should be complimentary like at other places    At the end  we decided to go out on a limb and order every flavor of sorbet and ice cream they had. I loved the banana and chocolate ice cream  but the cream cheese flavor I could ve done without because the taste was too sharp and intense.
La Condesa,92,I can only speak for what I ate and the nice environment.  La condesa is a beautifully decorated place with so many colors  Their normal guac good and their brunch tortas are also good and with the chips and everything definitely filling to hold you over for the rest of your weekend activities. The bread is so good. Definitely could go for a torta right now because of that bread. Sign me up
La Condesa,93,Came here for dinner last night and had a good experience. Loved sitting outside on the patio. My friend and I got a couple of dishes to split- even the salsas that came with the chips and salsas dish were super good  The service was good  our server was very friendly.
La Condesa,94,We went for Sunday Brunch. The cocktails are amazing  which is especially nice because there is a Brunch happy hour. The food is delicious  authentic... and beautifully presented. Just keep in mind that the portions are small so your brunch can turn out to be a little pricey. But overall a very good experience  food  and wonderful ambiance  
La Condesa,95,Awesome  authentic  creative  delicious... Stopped by on a whim on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with my pup. Of course they were booked but the hostess  Emily  was so accommodating and was able to seat us in minimal time  and our server  John  was great and attentive.
La Condesa,96,Another win for La Condesa   I decided to recommend La Condesa to my family that was in town because of my previous positive experience. So glad that it didn t disappoint and everyone came out after breakfast brunch completely glad that we chose this spot. One person in the party got the tacos de camote that were DIVINE. Like seriously I was jealous I didn t pick that entree myself. It was the perfect explosion of food in your mouth. I ordered the huevos rancheros. Another solid option on the menu  To start we got the guacamole taster that was super fresh and delicious. The chipotle and cotija cheese guac was my fav. The salsas included are just as equally amazing. For dessert we went for the dulce de Leche which is soo damn good. It s a must try. You need to come by La Condesa 
La Condesa,97,The Quick  Mexican tapas what s not to love  Very cute and trendy on the inside  lots of color and fun hanging lights. Great for a big group.   The Details  You know the nights off to a good start when you begin with the guacamole tasting. It comes with four little guacamole cups and a few salsas to try... At first we were disappointed in the portion size  but honestly it ended up being a lot more than we thought  There were seven of us and we each got a good amount of everything. The seasonal guacamole with spicy watermelon was out of control    Everything we had was delicious  my favorite was probably the tuna tostada which had a generous portion of tuna and a refreshing pickled veggie. Our group included pescatarians  meat eaters  and non fish eaters and we had plenty of options to please everyone.   The Damage  Pre Tip  it came to    40 a person with a drink each and we all left full.
La Condesa,98,If you are looking for a unique private dining experience for a small group  look no more     This would be a great place to have a private dinner for a small group  less than 20 .  La Condesa has a private room down in the basement and it is the coolest space   It has a wine cellar feel to it and it didn t cost us extra money for the room.  The coordinator we worked with was great.  We choose a set menu and served it family style.  It was really perfect.    The food was EXCELLENT     The only minor thing is that the stairs to get down to the Flour House are a bit steep and small  so be careful 
La Condesa,99,This is one of the best restaurants I have been to.  The food was amazing and the service impeccable.  We had 17 people and each one of us was treated like a queen. Our server was enthusiastic and explained all the dishes.  It was a most enjoyable dining experience. Thank you for doing such a great job.
La Condesa,100,This restaurant is in a great location  both in terms of being downtown and in terms of the beautiful outdoor seating and overall decor they have especially in terms of the weather. As a result  the prices will match this  no free chips salsa here .  The drink selection was good but the two drinks we had were pretty bland. We had a margarita and a pisco sour  and while both were pretty mediocre  the latter was nothing like a pisco drink should be  and at first iv wasn t even sure which drink was which.  That being said  their 4 salsa set is more of what I d call  craft salsa   and being served in small bits and without a lot of texture or flavor  but pretty colors. We also ordered the pork  and while it was pretty tasty as was the mashed potatoes  both were a bit too salty and the pork itself was very much RARE in at least 25  of the meat. Mind you  I LOVE medium-rare meat  but for PORK this is not ok.  All in all  not a fan.
La Condesa,101,Great food  service and ambiance  Our wait person was wonderful  We were here to celebrate National Margarita day and found excellent ones here.  Highly recommend this spot in downtown Austin 
La Condesa,102,An expensive tapas restaurant - I would recommend coming here if you have about  40  per person to spare.   The atmosphere was perfect for a date spot  quiet enough to talk with comfortable and modern decor. The service was also excellent and the staff was attentive.
La Condesa,103,We came here after a long day of food hopping around the city for one thing  that guacamole sampler. This worked out perfectly because since we were still rather full from the city s earlier offerings  I figured our best plan of attack of the menu was to go by way of the apps and sides.  What we got  elote  muy delicioso   guacamole sampler  queso fundido  I could have easily done without   and all washed down with a margarita por supuesto  it s always a race to finish before the paper straw gets too soggy   The guacamole tasting was everything. I m impartial for the lump crab guacamole  I m a sucker for all things crab  but the sweetness of the crab just nicely complemented the creamy zingy guacamole. The watermelon guac was a nice touch  my second favorite. The chipotle guac was nice too.  All can be compared to a portion of traditional guacamole as well. However  to be honest  the tasting also came with a sampler of the salsas as well  no need to order it separately    which I used with the traditional guacamole. Don t be fooled  the chips may look like a store bought brand  but they are warm  light  and crispy. They were kind attentive enough to have an extra additional basket of chips for us ready to finish our dips with.  The space is a millennial s dream desert get-away. Old school vinyl seating. Easy maintenance plants galore. Modern chandeliers. Polished concrete flooring. A mural wall. My kind of decor 
La Condesa,104,This restaurant actually offered very authentic Mexican dishes according to my fellow guest at this business dinner. However the pricing information on Yelp was misleading since most of the dishes are less than  20. However  they served small portion and one order of the entree could not fill your stomach. So the overall dinner bill will be more than  20 per person.
La Condesa,105,I m just going to say  13 for two tiny tacos.    Tasty but absolutely not worth the price   Service is good though.
La Condesa,106,Came in for a late reservation and tried to get seated early  but ended up in the bar. Despite seeing several open tables  the only table we were offered was in the middle of a walkway  no thank you.   Bartender was nice  but a little grouchy. Oh well  maybe it was not her day.   The food  they say  comes out as it is prepared. But every single dish we ordered came out within 3 minutes of each other. This was kind of a let down as it didn t really give us time to much on our appetizer.   What we ordered  The salsa   guacamole tasting  definitely not worth it. All 4 quacs tasted almost the same and the salsas were somewhat bland. This is a spin-off of a traditional Mexican restaurant and the chips were not up to par.  The poke tuna  came with two somewhat stale tostada chips. I ended up just eating the poke. This was ok but not great.  The Mexican corn  this was fabulous  but i mean who doesn t love Mexican corn. You can get in on or off the cob.  The Chile rellenos  amazing   This was the best thing we had. They are not your typical chille rellenos  but the white sauce they are bathed in was amazing.   All in all  it was good but not great. Don t know if we have a need to stop in again.
La Condesa,107,Came here with a group to celebrate a birthday. We were recommended this place by many locals. The food was wonderful. Went beyond expectations. Definitely recommend if you re looking for authentic  high quality Mexican food.
La Condesa,108,BLUF  Tasty  modernized Tex-Mex cuisine that is a little pricey with smaller sized dishes.   This restaurant is in the heart of downtown Austin  but didn t really steal my heart personally. It s in a prime location  but after eating here it left something to be desired. The overall decor is very modern and welcoming with high ceilings. There are usually large parties here  especially bachelorette parties so I would keep that in mind. The customer service here is on point at the least  as one of my orders got messed up but was quickly rectified without hesitation.   We ordered the Acapulco ceviche  el califa taquitos  and the elotes. The ceviche was super flavorful and fresh with a perfect proportion of fish to other ingredients. The taquitos were savory  just a little small  The elotes were slightly undercooked as it tasted like it should have been grilled just for a couple minutes longer. Overall delicious with the butter and toppings.   Overall  the food here tastes decent with prices comparable to the Northeast. Maybe I ll try coming back here in the future  but I can get more bang for my buck elsewhere.
La Condesa,109,This place is set up kind of weird. The restaurant is split in two. If you want happy hour  you must sit upstairs and hope one of the few tables are free. The bar area is extremely small as well. We asked if we could order happy hour items at a table below and the waiter told us he couldn t get the menu from the bar area. Weird considering it s literally 3 steps away but okay..  We finally got lucky and were able to get a table upstairs and squeezed all 4 of us in a tiny table on the patio.   Once seated  I had the tacos and the regular margarita and added jalape os. Both were fine. Nothing to rave about.   Service on the patio was good so I guess I m glad the waiter below couldn t accommodate us after all.
La Condesa,110,I haven t been more disappointed in what I thought could be a good time in a while. Went in to have a decent meal. I ordered chips and  guacamole  with a drink. Before I had realized their food was less than mediocre  I was  30 in on a literal crushed avocado no seasoning whatsoever   ridiculously thick and greasy chips  and a drink. Even though I ordered a margarita  the one they recommended   I got a cup of water rimmed with salt and a lime. There aren t many places that I would recommend stay away from  but this place is an exception.
La Condesa,111,Delicious  Very calm environment and welcoming staff. The food was amazing. Ordered cheese and chorizo dip  house salad  scrambled eggs  short rib  mushroom and tomatoes.
La Condesa,112,I loved my lunch at La Condesa today  the only reason I didn t give it five stars was because there were too many bees around.  I ordered the delicious octopus starter
La Condesa,113,Chips  amp  salsa  amp  guac   pretty average. Nothing to write home about. Corn on the Cobb  pollo  tamal  churros   also pretty average. Their corn tortillas were good  but strange how you have to order those separately. The service was great  but based on my standards of 4  meaning I d go back  I don t think I would. It may be a good place to hit for HH since all drinks are half off. Didn t see their HH food menu.
La Condesa,114,Super cute downtown spot with patio seating. I ll start off by saying if you don t like spicy then this isn t your place...   Another thing I can t stand about Mexican restaurants- I don t care how high end you are- charging for chips and salsa. They give you 4 samples of salsa  they are all just kinda ok. The guacamole didn t look like fresh avocado  more like a mix of real and the store bought stuff. Cocktails were  12-14 a pop. Boooo.   The ahi poke was good but spicy. The hamachi was amazing but a very small portion for the price. Queso flameado was great- def get it. Our friend got the vegetables and she loves spicy food but she said it wasn t edible because of the heat. The boyfriend got the pork chop plate - insert Mexican name-with taters. It was good  meat was a little over cooked. If I ever go back it ll hopefully be for a happy hour and I ll get hamachi and flameado. But I ll probably never go back. There s too many other amazing places that offer these exact things plus a plethora of other amazing dishes.
La Condesa,115,Great spot  Every time I m in Austin- I go here. Love sitting outside having a drink  amp  love their tacos. Everything is solid  very good  amp  great service. I had their ceviche- which was super fresh  a little spicy so if you aren t into spicy- perhaps don t get this. LOVE their corn 
La Condesa,116,This is my favorite restaurant in Austin  TX   My family and I went for Brunch and got a French Press  Mexican Chocolate cookies  and Egg dishes   the cookies have this nuanced  delicious spiciness that is so good  The eggs were perfect too   We returned for Dinner later that day and got ceviche and some other fish dishes and it was just as good  Get the Mexican chocolate desert  It s so good  and spicy like the cookies   GO HERE 
La Condesa,117,Came here for drinks and small bites. I got the watermelon elderflower cocktail which was both delicious and refreshing  They do have a small patio to the side of the building but they do have a good sized patio in front  they were able to accommodate our group of four in the small patio. We did have a special request to have a cucumber gimlet made  which was fantastic because they use all fresh ingredients. They re elotes are amazing and I tried to replicate them but can t compare. This is more of an upscale  ish Tex Mex type place so great for special occasions  but the first time I came here my husband and I just stumbled upon it in our casual wear and it was completely fine.   Good vibe and amazing  fresh tasting cocktails 
La Condesa,118,A great place that brings a modern tropical atmosphere with uniquely flavored tacos. The tacos of course are the star of the place and they do live up to the reviews. They were so delicious that I found myself wishing I was hungrier so I could ve ordered more. And no you won t find salt and pepper because everything is seasoned that well. Oh   and fresh thick corn tortillas are a touch that takes the tacos to that next level that most other places don t go.    The service was spot on and prompt   and the owner even chatted with me for a while as I complimented his food.   So when you need something different in a city full of typical Tex-Mex   go on by   you ll not only be glad you did   but you ll become a regular like me.
La Condesa,119,This is probably one of our favorite spots in Austin. Anytime we visit we make a point to stop in for drinks and a delicious dinner. We obviously started out with the cubico  this drink is a Tobacco infused tequila  it has a volcanic salt rim and they go down so easily- watch out the tobacco can make you a little light headed if you drink it to quickly. Seriously the best drink ever          Once we quenched our tequila thirst we ordered ceviche and the guacamole tasting- yum and yum  Our server suggested the carrot salad  it was hard to believe that this seemingly boring carrot salad could possibly be his  favorite thing on the menu   We ordered it based on his suggestion and it was awesome  This wasn t my favorite thing we ordered but it s pretty hard to compete with tacos  right  I have to confess  I have thought of this little salad often since that night. Something about the roasted carrots  the shaved carrots  marinated carrots  currants and yogurt dressing just worked  Do not pass on this dish  it is a perfect starter   Finally we moved on to the main event  time for tacos. I ordered the lamb tacos  my husband ordered beef. The lamb tacos were damn good. The lamb was so flavorful  the in house made cheese  creamy  smoky and so tasty. Topped with mint and hot sauce  I can t even deal  amazing. Don t forget about the street corn  simple and absolute perfection.   If you are looking for a healthy and interesting Mexican restaurant  look no further  this is your spot  Cheers  Till we meet again... I will see you in my dreams...
La Condesa,120,Came in for brunch on a Sunday to celebrate my friend s birthday.  They had 2  mimosas and bloody marys   The brunch menu was basically a bunch of different egg dishes. We grabbed a few   got the guac tasting and went to town.  Food all came out swiftly and no one had any complaints. We ate happily and loved the taste of each dish. They also brought out a cute lil cupcake for my friend.   I had a great time y all should come in if you ve been on the fence.   Restrooms  4 5 very nice   clean   touchless faucets  but dark.
La Condesa,121,We ordered queso for the table and I ordered the short rib quesadillas for dinner. The queso was incredible  and it s served with small corn tortillas instead of chips which I actually liked. However  while the quesadilla tasted great  the portion size is SO small. You are definitely not getting enough food for the price you pay. I paid  35 for my meal and I m still hungry.
La Condesa,122,We came to this place on a Saturday night. It was easy to get a reservation. The atmosphere is cool. It s modern and fun and the staff is really nice. Our waitress took the time to explain the menu.   They have family style foods which is what we opted for. We got the chicken. It literally was a half of a chicken with onions and some sauce. I could have made it at home and put it on a tortilla and saved myself  36 dollars or whatever it cost. The chips and guacamole was good.   Also not a place for kids. They have a sad looking quesadilla for them.
La Condesa,123,La Condesa is alright for a quick meal and or happy hour  but living in CA I tend to be picky about my Mexican food. First and foremost  I understand that it is prime real estate being located downtown Austin  which comes with a high price tag for most dishes. With that said though the prices do not match the quality of the food I ordered.   La Condesa from the outside is quite inviting and the fact that everytime I walk by it is crowded  which gave me high hopes for a good meal. Upon walking in I found myself waiting...and waiting even longer  until a server walked by after five minutes and said  You can sit anywhere . I should ve listened to the myself and just found another restaurant nearby  but I was hungry and again the amount of people packed inside gave me high hopes. After finding a seat at their bar  I ordered a few dishes to share and a main dish. The chicken tacos I ordered were a tad bland  but did not really feel like complaining as I was quite hungry. Also got the roasted chicken with mole  which was pretty good  but again not worth the  23 dollar price tag honestly. Overall service was alright  but they were so slammed  I rarely was asked if I wanted another drink or needed anything extra at all.  I guess maybe I am spoiled with ample amounts of wonderful Mexican restaurants where I live. Honestly though  I have experienced some good Mexican restaurants in different countries  so it s really not an excuse to use for the subpar food I experienced at La Condesa  but I would be up to trying it again to see if it has changed since the last visit.
La Condesa,124,This place really delivers on drinks and chips and salsa. They have strong margaritas and seriously addicting salsa  The menu is more of a sharing menu and they suggest ordering a few things off of it which gets a little pricey. For the price  it is not totally worth it. We ordered the guacamole as a starter and this serving was much smaller than comparable restaurants in the area. Then  we ordered the chicken taquitos which were actually three tiny unrolled tacos. We also ordered the ceviche which was really flavorful and delicious but was only enough for two. The atmosphere is hip and cool  located right downtown. It s a cool place to visit with tasty food but pricey for what you get.
La Condesa,125,This place was Soo good  The habanero drink was Soo spicy though  my lips were burning so have of the time there. I wish they offered straws with super spicy drinks. My friend had the sweet potatoes and they were really good. She also had a jalape o margarita which was also too spicy she couldn t even finish it. I had tacos and they were pretty good  I would want to give this place another try for sure. The server was very kind and it was so pretty inside. Im hoping my next visit I will be able to love everything  
La Condesa,126,Note  my review is for their Happy Hour   I was reading multiple articles online about the best HH and I stumbled upon La Condesa. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by on a Wednesday afternoon and we were able to luckily get outdoor seating on the patio as there were only about three  maybe four   tables available outside. We were promptly greeted by the waitress and both of us ordered cocktails off of their drinks menu which were half off during HH. We both got mojitos and beer.  We also ordered food for the evening which included the guacamole tasting  came with 4 salsas and 4 guacamoles   elote  came with two pieces of corn   a pollo postizado taquito  came with one taco   and some type of meatball in a mole sauce  three average sized meatballs . Overall the food was average  nothing really stood out with the exception of the chicken taco. The chicken was absolutely delightful  bursting with flavor  accompanied with salsa and the perfect amount of acid. To be honest  it probably was one of the best tacos I ve had in my entire life. Would highly recommend to try. Other than that  nothing was too memorable- but if you re looking for a place with a nice patio and a hip vibe during HH  La Condesa may be a good choice for you.
La Condesa,127,Came here with my boyfriend for a weekend brunch. To my surprise  the restaurant wasn t busy at all despite being brunch hours. We were able to get a table right away.   Service  Service was pretty bad here which is why I took out one star. No one greeted our table for a while. So we had to ask for a waitress. It also took forever for the waitress to come get our order. Throughout our meal  the waitress went MIA so a bus boy was the one refilling our water cups. I don t understand why the waitress took forever to be available for us when there wasn t even a lot of customers in the restaurant.   Atmosphere  Casual atmosphere. I love the interior design here. The arrangement of the lightings are nicely done. There is a small staircase that leads to a separate bar of the restaurant. Noise level was moderate.    Food  My boyfriend ordered the huevoa condesa which is considered a staple dish here. He really loved it  and the portion was just right for him. I ordered the Cubanita without realizing that it was a hamburger. But to my surprise  it was pretty good. I thought the chips were too oily though.  All in all  it was a pretty decent restaurant. However  they definitely need to train their employees better.
La Condesa,128,I must say I ve never actually had a full dinner here  but this is one of the best happy hour spots downtown after work.  The margaritas are great and the atmosphere on the balcony of the bar area is the perfect spot for relaxing after a long day.  The service has always been on point as well 
La Condesa,129,when i can eat mexican and know with any reliability it will be good  i do.  i had been curious about la condesa after seeing their menu so straight from the airport we went for a light meal.  service was good. attentive  informative staff willing to answer questions  give advice in terms of ordering  etc.  my drink was ok. it didn t wow me for  12. i liked the description and was told it would be smokey but i couldn t sense that at all when it arrived. it wasn t bad  it just wasn t popping with the mix of flavors the ingredients suggested.  the food was good but be prepared for the size. these are small plates for sure  my tostada de at n was gone in three bites however it had great  fresh flavor mixed with a fabulously crisp tostada shell beneath the tuna and pickled veggies. the fried shallots added a nice flavor and crunch.  my friend s mushroom dish was also good but heavier with its think corn meal base.  again  a nice mix of flavors.  we decided to order chips and their traditional guacamole neither of which were outstanding. i ve had better chips out of a bag from my local organic coop and the guacamole was just that  guacamole. to be fair  our server detailed the various ones available and we chose traditional   maybe it was the lackluster chips that minimized the experience   all in all  the place was hopping on a friday night. we did get seated right away and the majority of the food was fine but to walk out paying  65  including tip  for having consumed three appetizers and a drink struck me as overpriced but probably what i should have expected from the upscale area of town.
La Condesa,130,I came here on a Monday night for dinner with two friends. The restaurant is located in Downtown Austin so we assumed it would be decent  we were sadly mistaken     Our waitress was friendly  she seated us outside immediately despite not having made reservations. It was a little breezy and chilly that evening  we were seated near some heat lamps  but unfortunately it did not help much. We ordered Elotes  Mexican style street corn  as an appetizer to share among the three of us. It comes with four corn on the cobs  more like two actually since they were split in half and placed on a stick. The Elotes was good  I liked the cheese and chili powder sprinkled on top. At  6  it was reasonably priced. For my entree I ordered The Cochinita Pibil Taquitos which came with pork shoulder  black beans  pickled red onion  habanero escabeche and cabbage served with your choice of corn or flour tortilla. I was very disappointed in my meal. The pork had zero flavor  it was very dry and bland. The pickled red onion was overwhelmingly tangy and sour. The dish had way too many beans  which were overcooked and mushy. The only positive in this dish was the habanero escabeche  it was super spicy... eat with caution  I am glad I took a tiny bite before I ate an entire pepper  P At  12  it was not pricey for dinner  but it was not filling or tasty.  This seems like a fun spot for happy hour  there is a cool bar area with seating upstairs. I would ve enjoyed myself more if I had stuck to the Elotes and gotten a drink with it. I would not recommend this spot for dinner  nothing was really amazing and there are too many better options in Downtown Austin.
La Condesa,131,The best  slightly  snobby REAL-DEAL-MEXICAN-FOOD.  Leave your Tex-mex at the door  amp  bow down to the REAL Mexican gods 
La Condesa,132,La Condesa   The Countess  is a superb Mexican restaurant located a block down 2nd Street from Austin City Limits.   My wife and I sampled for over an hour. Appetizers  sides and margaritas are more than enough to fill you and your friends up.  Maybe next time I ll try one of their platters.    We happened to meet the sous-chef  Frank Harris.  He sent us out two small dishes to sample first  ceviches Acapulco  striped bass  salsa Valentina  avocado  tomato and jalape o in a citrus cilantro sauce - amazing flavors  followed by El Califo Taquitos  mini tacos  - We liked these taquitos the best of all - a thin layer of New York strip with crispy  toasted manchego  cilantro and oak-grilled jalape o-tomato salsa.  We also tried some really nice veggie offerings  including Calabaza  roasted butternut squash  pumpkin seed pesto  manchego and sunflower sprouts.   The guacamole is excellent  served with chips and four special salsas  The La Condesa Margarita is a must  in my opinion.  Very smooth.  So if you ever get the chance to eat at this restaurant in Austin  TX  don t miss out on it.
La Condesa,133,nothing on the menu was available. staff was rude. left us waiting for our drinks food and check. horrible experience and over priced for the service and inconvenience the meal was.
La Condesa,134,We chose to eat dinner here because we could get a reservation and it looked like a fun place with lots of options on the menu. All of the food was just mediocre. We ordered the guacamole sampling to start. I m not sure what was in all of them but there was something that left a weird after taste. I ate the cauliflower steak for my main course and it was cooked nicely but once again I didn t like the flavors of the sauce and other things on top of it. Lastly we had a side of the tostones which were nice and salty but I didn t like the lemon dipping sauce that came with it.  I m only giving this place two stars because it had great service.
La Condesa,135,I have been here twice now and its not my favorite place.  I dont have too much to say unfortunately.    The food does taste good  but I just feel like it is overpriced.  The portions are super small because they mostly serve tapas so you end up ordering a ton of food that is shared with multiple people and you end up feeling hungry but still have a huge bill.  What turned me off here the most was the service.  The waiter and waitress  iv been here multiple times  were not nice and were over worked. They were also not very well informed about what was on the menu. Im not sure if the place is understaffed or what but I could tell they were stressed out to the max.
La Condesa,136,Came alone for a late dinner and sat at the bar. The bartender was busy but provided me very good service. The menu of tequilas and mescals is extensive but I opted for a local beer. To see the menu I had to use my flashlight app on my cell phone. Now I am good with ambience but it was dark enough to sleep. I order the chili rellenos. The flavor was very good. The stuffed pepper came with micro greens on top that had a good earthy flavor and pumpkins seeds for texture. With that said  the portion size was pretty small for the price and came with no sides.  My food was good. If you are craving upscale Mexican and have money to spend  I d say give it a try. If your really hungry and you just want some authentic Mexican  there are other options that you may prefer.
La Condesa,137,You ever get somewhere and wonder how you got there  Right. Scene.   WalkedOut after the guacamole tray.  DoingTooMuch
La Condesa,138,Hola   La Condessa might be known for their dinner and lunch but Sunday brunch is what this review is about.  Patio seating and great for people watching. Need a litte more shade  There is a shaded small balcony patio by the bar over looking Guadalupe. Both patios are great for people watching.  You re steps away from Moody   ACL Theatre so when things open back up this would be the perfect place to do your pre concert   event dinner. Anyhow  back to brunch. The Steak y Eggs for  42 will satisfy the cravings of 2  it s meant to be shared ... comes with ribeye cut steak  beans  fried pototo  salsa and tortillas to make your own taco. Extra bonus points for adding avocado and bacon on to this from the sides menu.
La Condesa,139,Best nopales I ve ever had   cactus  Also the zanahorias  carrots  were amazing  with fresh local yogurt and cardamom that tastes like you just cracked it out of the pod. I m told you can t really go wrong with the menu. I got the cauliflower steak  and a colleague got the chicken with mole. Both very flavorful. And the place had a nice vibe.
La Condesa,140,Had the guac trio which was four guacs with mix ins  blue crab  pickled beets  and spices   the camarones  shrimp  dish  and the tuna appetizer. Also had a scoop of cinnamon ice-cream with a candle in it for the birthday boy  which was free  and a nice touch. The shrimp was too spicy but everything else was really good. I would enjoy coming back in the summer and sitting outside on the patio which looked nice. Service was fast and friendly.
La Condesa,141,Y all I hadn t been to la condesa in years  literally years. We went yesterday post Mother s Day massages  hey there milk and honey   and we were all blown away by the food and drinks.  There s so many places now in Austin to eat it s hard to standout. But la condesa was just good ingredients  with well made simple dishes  and instagram- worthy presentation. Hard to beat. Sometimes simplicity does win. Often times at Mexican restaurants there s too much sauce or other ingredients added in  this was a refreshing change to the norm  to actually just have good quality ingredients.  We love going to 2nd street but find ourselves eating at taverna a lot  glad this place got back in the game  Not to mention the cocktails were blissful as well.  Thanks la condessa for an exceptionally good Mother s Day dinner-- we can t wait to go back 
La Condesa,142,The food was excellent. Had the camote tacos along with guacamole salsa sampler. I ate too fast to take a picture but it was delicious  Our sever Anelll was so sweet and friendly. I am very grateful that she took our request to manager to change the music from headbanger stuff to something more appropriate for conversation and digestion  I hope corporate is reading this   Atmosphere greatly improved  Thank you 
La Condesa,143,Food was ok. My favorite was their carrot salad. Overall  each meal seemed a bit too salty.   I had a the huitlacoche masa  zanahoria  carrot salad  and el camaroncito tacos. The masa was the saltiest and most disappointing to me. Salad was good  especially those roasted carrots. It was also a bit salty but not as bad as the masa. I think if they cut back on the salt by half  the food would be much better. I would be to taste more of the flavors from the actual ingredients.   Portion size was on the small to medium size and it was a bit pricey for what you get. But location is in downtown Austin  so to be expected. Great decor. Service was excellent as well.
La Condesa,144,Great meal for one  I walked in on a Thursday night and got a table outside. The waitress was really friendly and had recommendations for me. I got the guacamole with chipotle and sliced almonds  and the lamb tacos.  The Guacamole had some real heat and smokiness from the chipotles. I was skeptical about almonds in guac but it really worked. The crunch from the almonds and the kick from the chipotles elevated the already tasty guac.  The tacos were the best I had in Austin. The tortillas were toasted over fire  so they were both toasty and charred. The lamb was super flavorful and juicy  with crumbly  tangy cheese on top.
La Condesa,145,Really great place. The ambiance was super cute  wait staff is really nice and the margs are delish.
La Condesa,146,Given how packed this chic restaurant was  and how Austin is known for Mexican food  this meal was disappointing.  We started with the guacamole tasting  expecting each guacamole to be significantly different in flavor.  However  the base for each one was exactly the same  just some garnish sprinkled on top.  Also wish the sample sizes were bigger - maybe cut down on the number and increase the sizes.  In most restaurants I ve been to  taquitos often refers to fried rolls but here  they re tacos.  Two small tacos  with no sides.  Seemed pricey for what you get.  Out of the chicken  snapper  and pork shoulder tacos  the pork shoulder was definitely the best - oddly  you had to wrap this one yourself.  The naming conventions are confusing here.  3 stars is generous.
La Condesa,147,This place is must eat if you are visiting Austin for thr first time usually you find Tex mex around. But this place is authentic. Every year or two they visit Mexico City to shaping up their recipe too. Loved it.
La Condesa,148,I have been to La Condesa on various occasions. On this particular occasion I was catching up with a girlfriend. If you aren t a drinker I would suggest their Aguafrescas because they are AMAZING. I went with the Pineapple Mint. You can t go wrong with any of them though.  I ordered the Al Pastor Torta. It was a little spicy but I m also a wuss on spice. Great flavor all around.   What blew me away though was the Boca Negra.  Flourless chocolate cake  chile de arbol  ancho  caramelized banana   brown sugar-banana ice cream This too has a little spice but it pairs beautifully with the entire dish. I am a huge banana foster fan so the carmalized bananas was just icing on the cake. We ve all had flourless chocolate cake but this is just heavenly 
La Condesa,149,I dropped by for the frozen pina coladas. The lady at the desk on the side walk was wonderful. Everything else about the experience was top tier trash.   First  I waited nearly 20 minutes for an order of two drinks and chips with guac. I know this may sound princessy  but come on  20 minutes for an order of premade frozen drinks and chips  On a Wednesday  At 4 30 pm    Then  I check the receipt and it was FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS for two drinks and chips with guac. This had better be the best pina coladas of my life for FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS. These chips had better cure cancer for FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS.   I checked the menu and they advertise the pina coladas as  12 each  so I questioned the charge. Again  this isn t something I would normally do  but FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS for two drinks and chips and guac seemed like an obvious mistake. The guy mumbled something about how  18 is their to go drink price  then offered to give me the advertised menu price. He printed off a new receipt at the advertised menu price  then still charged me the FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS for my drinks and chips and guac.   I would give this place one star  but the front desk lady was wonderful and the drinks tasted fine. The guac and chips and everything else about the experience was hot  steamy garbage.
La Condesa,150,My Mixta pollo salad dish consisted of just lettuce and very dry chicken. The Cubanita sandwich is extremely greasy  too spicy  and the pork inside tasted old. Friend ordered the Acapolo dish- turned out to be a small glass filled with ceviche-style bass ...not what she expected. The pictures and presentation of the food look much better than the quality or taste.
La Condesa,151,Never thought I would get excited by a salad but this one was delicious   It had greens  radishes  jimica  roasted chicken and just enough dressing along with counts cheese.  It was the most refreshing and yummy salad I have had on a very long time.  As a side warning  we sat outside and my husband got pooped on by birds in a tree twice.  Yes  twice  Might want to avoid sitting under the trees.
La Condesa,152,GREAT contemporary Mexican food.  Vegetarians won t be disappointed - try the huarache de hongos y huitlacoche masa  the coliflor a la plancha  AMAZING   the chili relleno  and their many vegetarian sides     The restaurant is VERY cool.  And the cocktails are FANTASTIC.  In the very cool and chic Second Street District.  Definitely check it out 
La Condesa,153,I could say many things about this place. From all the pics posted on Yelp the food looked great. But the menu we had for Sunday evening was small and very limited. Speaking of small........ 3 silver dollar sized tacos with nothing on the side for  15  and a micro sized tostada for  18  that they put mustard on  give me a break  And they were both disgusting. Margaritas were okay  interior and atmosphere is cool  service is barely passable  so I do not know even why anyone would ever eat here
La Condesa,154,What a fantastic patio  We got lucky and snagged a large portion of the small glass lined patio overlooking Guadalupe and 2nd St. I loved watching the bustle of the city  while enjoying an impeccable cocktail at La Condesa.   The huge steel doors were easy to open  and the decor is INCREDIBLE. I m the plants complimented the industrial steel and they aren t afraid of color.   We went for happy hour  which is a great deal for the drinks  half price anything alcoholic   - but the happy hour food situation is not ideal. There are some  4 tacos on the menu that wouldn t feed a mouse. They are comically small. The guac is great  but the taster came with tiny ramekins  which left some to be desired.   Overall  I had a fantastic experience and our service was on point. She split the bill any way we wanted. and She was on top of the water refills. The gluten-free options are a-plenty.   Highly recommend for happy hour if you re not that hungry 
La Condesa,155,I think it s really important to update your reviews. Things change and so do your perceptions over time  therefore La Condesa  you re now a 4-star place in my eatery book.   I don t think I ve changed my opinions on the food  because it s still somewhat overpriced  but the location is pricey. Rent needs to be paid. But I want to highlight what this restaurant is SPECTACULAR for  Happy Hour. They have a killer deal of half off all drinks from 5-7PM M-F. HALF OFF. Shout it from the rooftop because you can get  2.50 Modelos  or  6 mojitos during this time. It s probably the best happy hour downtown.   I decided to get some of the food  too and they had these  4 tacos  but they were ant-sized. Seriously the smallest tacos ever. But  they were delicious and I d probably pay for them again. All in all a great place to drink with your friends.
La Condesa,156,Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and it was great. Had good traffic but there was no wait and few open tables.  The ambience is pretty chill. Attire is casual  entree prices range from  12- 20  and the scenery is trendy.  As far as service  it was good but not excellent. Took about 4 minutes for anyone to even greet us  and it was the bus boy who gave us water. Then another 3 minutes later our server greets us and asks if we would like any drinks or appetizers  we order a drink  and she walks away. After awhile  I have to stop a server waking by to order our food. The wait time on food that day was about the same wait you would for any other restaurant  about 11 minutes. After receiving our food  our server was a little more attentive to us.  I ordered the Huevos Condesa  which was a good pick. It consisted of roasted chicken  fried eggs  poblano rajas  grilled onions  duck fat potatoes  bacon and Swiss chard with a side of three corn tortillas. With the michelada that I ordered  the two went well together.   Overall  I would recommend this place for you Austinites or if you are traveling and want to try out a trendy Tex-Mex restaurant  you won t be disappointed.
La Condesa,157,Couldn t have made a worse choice.  100 for the smallest tacos you had ever seen- about the size of 3 fingers. 2 drinks and a tablespoon or two of guacamole and salsa.   Do yourself a favor and don t make that same  we ll  give is a shot l  like we did. It would be more satisfying to just have donated.
La Condesa,158,We came with a party of 20 and our server was a trooper  We got the set menu with guacamole  ceviche  chicken  steak  cauliflower  beans and rice  Dessert was a spicy flourless chocolate cake with banana ice cream  a little too spicy for my taste  and coffee was unfortunately very burnt. Otherwise ok for the 4 stars 
La Condesa,159,The ambience gets 5 stars  the food 3  and our server that evening a 2.  Good place to have cocktails in the bar  but based on our service experience will probably not be back for dining.
La Condesa,160,This is probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I ve ever had. My friend and I are VERY shocked and confused seeing so many good reviews. At first glance  the place is beautiful... that s about it.   First of all  it felt like it was 100 degrees inside. My friend and I were both literally sweating. We then ordered  I wanted a simple cheese quesadilla. The tortillas were insanely dry and had barely any cheese in them. I did not eat them.   My friend got the hongos dish which was bland with what she says tasted like a rotten avocado sauce on the side. The portion was tiny  especially considering our waitress told us that the portion sizes were  meant to be shared . She also followed that by suggesting 3 entrees for 2 people  Very contradictory   We then both decided we didn t want to eat the food and that we d rather go somewhere down the street. We were still charged for everything which we understand but we were obviously very unhappy and our waitress didn t apologize for the bad experience or seem to be interested in why we were unhappy. We spent  68 for food we did not eat. We still tipped the waitress  10 because we don t believe any of it was really her fault. It s just a shitty restaurant   Do not come here  000000 stars
La Condesa,161,Great tradition Mexican fare.  While the menu is great don t shy from the specials.  Ceviches are fantastic.  Lovely inventive cocktails to boot.  Many rave about the guacamole sampler or street corn but there are more interesting options to be found for the more adventurous.  I ve found lighter options generally more successful than heavier offerings.
La Condesa,162,Mediocre food. The guac has preservatives which is always a let down. Whats wrong with fresh avocados and ingredients made to order    I ordered a steak dish that was consumed in all of 3 bites... Sexy  portions huh   They serve water European style   still  water  no ice from a carafe . The ambiance is outstanding. Sexy and chic. Great place for a date. Gonna try once more during lunch this time...perhaps I will have a snack beforehand Waitstaff was fast  friendly and professional
La Condesa,163,Ordered chips  salsa  and guac.  Chips came out chewy. Not just a couple of them  but the entire bowl.  We weren t sure if that s how they were supposed to be or if something was wrong.  I waited for someone to come check on us but no one came for about 15 minutes.   Our waitress finally came and we got a new bowl of chips.  These chips were amazing  Ordered barbacoa  bean and cheese quesadilla  fideo  mixed greens  and a brunch plate.  The barbacoa was amazing. The mixed green salad was on point as well. The bean and cheese quesadilla was  15 and it was the size of one tortilla folded in half with bean and cheese inside. We were shocked at the size of it for the  15. The fideo was less than to be desired as well and was sent back. I ordered another beer when we started our main meal and 15 min later the beer came. To tell you the truth I forgot I ordered it  that s how long it took to come. The bill was around  150 and we were shocked at how much we paid for how much food we received.  If I come back again it will only be for the drinks definitely not for the food.
La Condesa,164,Came here on a Sunday for dinner with a group of 7.  Ambiance  Trendy and spacious place with dim lighting.  Service  Our waiter was super nice and attentive.  He provided us with good recommendations.  Food  We had many dishes and everything tasted delicious. I do not remember the name of all the dishes  but you must try the guacomole sampler   The portions were on the small side and that is really my only complaint.    This is a place that is good for either a romantic dinner or a group dinner.  Give it a try 
La Condesa,165,It was hard to know what to expect at La Condesa  given the write-ups I saw before going there   On the one hand  Texas Monthly has it in its Top 50 Mexican restaurants in Texas.  That s a heavy-duty accolade.  But  on the other hand  La Condesa s taken a recent beat-down here on Yelp.  Lots of complaints about prices and service  among other things.    Sounded like it was going to be an adventure.  It was  but in mostly a good way.  Maybe we got lucky.  There were seven us  and given that this is yet another upscale restaurant dedicated to small-plates sharing  we decided to let our lead server set up a meal for the entire table  with us throwing her a suggestion or two.  This turned out to be a great idea  because she was enthusiastic about this project  and we got to try one or two things from just about every section of the menu.  The server provided for a very evenly-paced and balanced dining experience through this variety  and did a great job.  And it was quite a variety  --Guacamole tasting  which came with some fresh salsas  too  --Hamachi ceviche --One of the masa deals with mushrooms and huitlacoche --the Arabicos  or seared venison  tacos --the El Kalifa  or NY strip  tacos --a carrots-done-four-ways dish --Brussels sprouts  w  bacon  amp  grapes  --Elotes  or the Mexican-style street corn   Damn  I feel like there are one or two things I m leaving out.   For the most part  this stuff was fantastic  the vegetables especially.   The carrot dish was the third carrot dish the wife  amp  I had consumed in four nights in Texas  and the third that was totally different and yet delicious and imaginative.  So I must ask   What the hell is the deal with Texas and carrots    The ceviche was pretty great  too--it was cut more like sashimi  rather than chopped up.  The tacos were less great--the venison ones were tasty  but were served cool for some reason that I can t remember--I suppose to highlight the bright-tasting Med-tilted garnishes.  The biggest dud was the steak tacos  which had crispy manchego and registered somewhat like Steak-ums.   Of course  Steak-ums can be a guilty pleasure  but the only guilt in this case ought to be in spending  15 on two of those little things.   Anyway  La Condesa is indeed pretty damn expensive for what you get.  With two or three drinks each  and a shared dessert  we dropped  65-70 each  tax and tip included.  Obviously this is not standard-issue Tex-Mex  with its basic ingredients  but  12-18 dollars apiece for sometimes tiny servings of even higher-end Mexican-influenced fare adds up in a hurry.    D cor is slick and very much of the 21st century  but it may already be starting to date a bit.  Seating was very comfortable.  And damn  the AC seemed to be struggling on this May evening.  It was about 92 outside  and felt like about 85 inside.  That s too MFing hot for the Great Indoors in Texas.  Our experience was mostly up  but the few downs make me think that the negative reviews aren t necessarily off the mark  either.
La Condesa,166,Go here now    While visiting Austin for a week I dined here twice because it was that great.   Ambiance-modern and cool. The music wasn t so loud that you couldnt talk. Perfect for friends  dates or business.   Food-amazing   Great variety  flavors and textures. The must have dishes are the hamachi civiche  mushroom huarache  carne asada and elote.  Service was friendly and attentive.
La Condesa,167,I am a massive fan of La Condesa. The service is always warm and professional. The management is welcoming and responsive. And the food is top-notch   Whether it s for dinner  I love their fish  or brunch  try the barbacoa  I ve never been disappointed. They also have my favorite dessert in Austin - their Boca Negra - a somewhat spicy warm  flourless chocolate cake. If you go  be sure to order the Boca Negra 
La Condesa,168,I feel bad for whoever created the menu  as the cocktail list has some inspired creations. However  the bartender produced a watered down lemonade with ice shards and not a hint of the requisite mezcal when I ordered the Dia de Los Muertos  2  a kinda clever take on a Corpse Reviver. A scandalously portioned tostada de at n came in at  16. A huarache de huitlacoche comes inexplicably doused with truffle oil  presumably to add flavor to an otherwise flavorless goop atop a microwaved and stale masa base. Also  16. Service was curt and bordering on rude. I think the server laughed at me when I pointed out that the online menu has different pricing and it should be fixed.  If you don t like real Mexican food or a well crafted cocktail AND you love spending a ridiculous amount of money on tiny portions  this is the place for you. Otherwise avoid this awful place.
La Condesa,169,If you want to try this place out because thrillist recommended it  I would wait for the hype to end.... happy hour was great  drinks are half off. However  seating is EXTREMELY LIMITED  If you don t mind hovering around someone else s table by all means  check this place out. The drinks were decent but I had to ask the bartender to make my spicy Paloma actually spicy lol. So if you do brace the crowd definitely ask to add habanero bitters to your drink if you like it spicy. We didn t order food but it looked delicious and again  during happy hour it is a great price 
La Condesa,170,Probably the worst service I ve had in a long time. I understand the day was busy  but we experienced a lot of difficulties. First  we had to wait 2 hours for a table when our friend  which had the same party size  waited only 30min and was seated before us. They also arrived AFTER us  Next  when we received our food it was cold  and my wife waited 15min after all of us to get her food. Finally  when my friend went to find a manager to complain a gentle threaten to call the cops when he asked about some of the issues. Of course he was angry  the service sucked.   Now to the food. Overpriced for below average Mexican food. Small plates and no real options if your hungry. Only go if you want an overpriced appetizer that takes an hour to get. At least the margaritas were okay.   Definitely do NOT recommend 
La Condesa,171,While dining here I experienced probably the worst service I have ever had. Just one example to give you an idea would be our drink order. The hostess brought over our drink order and placed the wrong drinks in front of everyone. Not a big deal  we can switch them ourselves. Unfortunately  she was unable to tell us which drink was which  so we could not switch them ourselves. She then just shrugged and walked away. Thanks for the help    The food was just so...meh. The portions were definitely not easily shared which our server told us was their whole deal  so that was confusing. I m not entirely sure how I am supposed to share a bone in half chicken. The two salads we ordered were bland. The corn tasted old and overcooked.  The fish was so smokey  it was almost inedible  like liquid smoke had been poured all over it. Also  it was super tiny  Which again not a big deal but our server kept bragging about how large it was and even used his hands to show about a foot measurement. When we told him we were disappointed with the size  he then told us it was done by weight. Split between five people  it was about a mouthful each. The heritage tortillas that we paid for were dry and crumbly. The price comes to  1 per tortilla. Our server told us they charge for tortillas because  they are so good . Not accurate.   Bad Service  and Bad Food  no thanks 
La Condesa,172,Stopped here  for lunch while in town. Sat outside at a sidewalk table. The food was good. The chef took the time to make modifications to the menu to accommodate my dietary restrictions. The outcome was very tasty. My husband ordered directly off the menu and was very pleased. He went with a recommendation from our waitress.
La Condesa,173,This review is for 3.5 stars.   La Condesa is a high end Mexican restaurant that seems perfect for work outings or happy hours. They specialize in chips and dip and offer a very unique guacamole and salsa tasting that I really dug. The guacamole was original  strawberry  chipotle  and crab. The salsa was just from mild to hot but included 4. I ve never had anything like this tasting and found it quite fulfilling and worth all  18.  We decided to have a tapa meal so we also ordered some chicken tacos  Street corn  and cauliflower steak flatbread type of dish. The chicken tacos were cooked well and marinated perfectly  but they included only 3 very empty tacos with just chicken and sauce and extremely tiny. I could have eaten 12 of these for a full meal. The street corn was fantastic as most reviews note. We orders ours off the cob as a cleaner alternative but either way you can t go wrong. The cauliflower steak itself was good  but this dish was too complicated. The flatbread tasted stale and the greens on top were just thrown on more like a decoration that made it almost impossible to eat as a combined dish. I also tried the house margarita that was so smooth yet seemed a little light on the alcohol.   We sat in the bar area to avoid the wait on a Saturday night. Easy enough to get served and food came out too quickly to be honest. Overall the food was good but none of the bigger dishes really felt like a quintessential Austin must if downtown. Vibe seemed like an older drinking crowd which seems appropriate given the price of the small tapas. Probably one of the better high end Mexican in the city but just not my type.
La Condesa,174,La Condesa was everything I wanted it to be.  Nice ambiance  great drinks  food  and service.  We started with a Margarita  and the premium margarita with Pineapple.  No mixer here.  The flavors were of lime and agave.  SO GOOD.    We had an app of the Hamachi Ceviche  yellow tail ceviche  calamansi broth  avocado  crispy garlic  charred onion  habanero truffle oil. .  I could have had three more orders  and drank the marinade.  Best ceviche I ve ever had next to what I got in Hawaii.    For our main courses I had the Arabicos Taquitos  seared venison  pickled cucumber  chipotle harissa  fennel pollen yogurt  cilantro on a bacon fat tortilla     my wife had the El Califa Taquitos  NY Strip  cripsy manchego  cilantro  oak -grilled jalapeno-tomato salsa   and we had a side of street corn. Unbelievable.  Mine was the best in my opinion  but the strip tacito was amazing too.  It was like steak cheese toast on a tortilla.    We finished with a couple local beers.  The service was impeccable  the food was amazing.  Highly recommend this place   
La Condesa,175,The vibe and food was delicious  yes... the vibe too .  Everything just seems so versatile - a perfect place for a weekend brunch or a nice downtown dinner.   We made reservations for a Sunday through Open Table - totally recommend doing that... they had folks waiting for them to open. The service and food lived up to the hype and I can imagine this being a place I take friends visiting the city.
La Condesa,176,If you haven t sensed a theme in my reviews by now  they re pretty much always about happy hours. My dining out is essentially limited to happy hours and tacos. So  naturally  this review is about the La Condesa happy hour.  The ambiance in this place is really great. The decorations are unique  and the patio area is super nice. The happy hour is only available in the bar area or on the patio  but there s generally enough seating to go around  especially on nice days  .   Before you even look at the menu  do yourself a favor and order the guacamole taster and a La Condesa Margarita. Seriously  trust me on this one. You ll all be fighting over the chipotle guac with slivered almonds while sipping your delicious drinks. It also comes with four salsas  which are equally tasty. Be warned  the sopas and tostadas are really  really tiny here. I m not exaggerating. Like  if I gave a La Condesa tostada to a small child  they d be like   Thanks  lady  this is almost enough food for my rabbit   But they re also AMAZING. Like  mind-blowingly delicious. Just be prepared  and don t expect a Texas-sized tostada because you will be disappointed.  The service can be a bit slow here at times  but everyone is super polite and friendly and we ve never left feeling like we didn t get what we needed. Although the prices are pretty huge discounts from what this restaurant normally charges for food  I wouldn t consider this a  cheap  happy hour. But if you re feeling fancy and don t have a fancy paycheck to match  this is a pretty great compromise 
La Condesa,177,One of the best happy hours in Austin. Beyond reasonable prices for the amazing food and drinks they offer during happy hour. Half off drinks  you can t beat that  especially when the drinks are beyond delicious.   One of my favorite drinks of all time is here - the el cubico. Tobacco infused tequila  sounds disgusting but trust me  it gives an added hint of smokiness that makes this drink absolute perfection  with grilled pineapple juice and brandy  along with some other amazing flavors . The la condesa margarita and spicy paloma are also pretty good. Remember  these drinks are half off at the bar during happy hour. You really can t ask for a better deal.   I ve had a bunch of their appetizers and since I haven t had an entree I don t feel I can give them a five at this time.   Some of the menu items I remember  Callos y Coco  scallops  - delicious  small portion but incredibly tasty just wish they provided more  Guacamole tasting - delicious  great selection of guacamole including my favorites of lump crab meat and chipotle toasted almond. This is a huge portion and can feed several people.   Elotes  corn  - delicious  it s still on the cob  I usually cut the kernels off for easier consumption   Nachos - there s are just ok  they are a filling portion for happy hour  If you re doing happy hour be sure to get there early because the bar fills up quickly. I really enjoy their tasty  unique drinks.
La Condesa,178,I m not a huge fan of Mexican food  so that didn t help my visit. However  we had been to a great  much cheaper Mexican restaurant two days before. The food was extremely expensive compared to other very good restaurants not far away. There were 6 of us eating and it cost  500. The waitress was nice  but she rarely checked in with us. We ended up asking different waitresses and waiters for things that we needed. The serving sizes were tiny. The food was okay. We weren t completely blown away by any of the 5 different dishes we ordered. Our favorite part of the meal was the side of corn. We all left hungry. It was a very cool  trendy place  but we all agreed it was the most disappointing meal we had during the entire trip. It was a shame it was the last meal of our trip.
La Condesa,179,While in Austin one evening  we searched Yelp for a recommendation.   While the rating was middle of the road  it was the Tips and photos that got us there.   We went in on a Saturday night without reservations and waited 5 mins.    The food selection was great and we ask for help from our wait staff.   A local beer was recommended with the meal and we enjoyed every bit of our visit.    Make sure you give them a try 
La Condesa,180,Really amazing happy hour  Half off all drinks  Our server in the bar area gave us such amazing service. The food was great  but the roasted chicken was the star of the show  cooked perfectly with some bacon fat tortillas
La Condesa,181,This place is fantastic. We came here for brunch and they have  2 Mimosas and Bloody Mary s and a brunch menu that has eggs  sea food  and other small Mexican plates. The service was incredible and the young lady that served us- Alexis did such a great job explaining what each plate tasted like and what it came with  she s truly an asset  Everything we ordered was fresh and full of flavor. My favorite was the choriqueso and the guac. By the time the entrees got to the table I was full of Mimosas and cheese but the chilaquiles were fresh and tasty. We will definitely come back here when we visit ATX again  If you re in the mood for a good patio brunch  come here  You won t regret it 
La Condesa,182,Typical Downtown fancy pants with Austin hipster twist. Menu is chefs special and portions aren t very big but food is good. The atmosphere is energized but the restaurant has a lot space with high ceilings. Perfect for after work cocktails but the ice a different locations if you re looking to get any business conversation in. Staff is nice  food comes out as it s ready. Good drink selection.
La Condesa,183,This place is really pretty inside  the service was great  but the food is different. It s not your typical Mexican. My coworkers and I had a lot of questions  as we tried to figure out what everything is on the menu. Most of us liked out food  but one person said their taco was too watery. I really liked how thin and crispy my potato chips were with my torta. I think the biggest draw was the flight of salsas and guacs. That was fun to try each. I would come back for that and a margarita. There is a vegan option  but I don t like sweet potato enough to get a whole taco devoted to it.
La Condesa,184,Food was very good. We would definitely go back. The atmosphere is great  The decor inside is amazing  The prices are a little overpriced though. No kids menu  they only have a chicken and cheese quesadilla. I got the huevos rancheros and my husband ordered the Ahogada. Both items were bursting with flavor. We ordered the guacamole  sampler which was fun to try and very tasty.
La Condesa,185,What used to be great Mexican food became what everything else in Austin eventually becomes  . . . over priced  small portions  lack of authenticity with slight undertones of cultural appropriation.  I m from CDMX btw. And Mexican. So I can say that.
La Condesa,186,I have only been to La Condesa for brunch a couple of times.  I love the mimosas here  they have a nice fresh taste. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and my my my the sauce was so good  The previous time  about 8 months ago  I recall ordering the chilaquiles and they were delicious as well. So far  every plate I have had here has been exquisite. I also love how aesthetic the place is. The recent remodel turned out amazing. It compliments the quality of the food very well  making it an overall pleasant experience.
La Condesa,187,This place seems to make money more from their location than their food. We came here before a show at ACL and it seems that a lot of people were doing the same. The menu is small and snobby. We were told by our waitress that the plates are tapas like and are meant o be shared  but the portion were SO Fricken small that we barely had any to eat.   Veracruzana  very salty  maybe because of the char or charcoal flavor.  Huachinango  was pretty good  but  16 for one spoon of food     Coles de Bruselas  this was the only good dish that seems reasonable in price.  Salas and chips  the salas wasn t anything extraordinary and it comes in small dipping portions.  There are so many places in Austin to get fabulous Mexican food that is affordable  this place is not worth the money.
La Condesa,188,This place is cute. Came for dinner during a work trip. Food taste really good and cocktails are well done. The four stars is due to the price  the plates are very much on the smaller size for the price and not that mind blowing.  We shared plates and ordered  Tirado to Ceviche - very very small 5 tiny slices lol but taste great  Huarache de Hongos - taste great  pretty good size Calabacitas - basically grilled zucchini  it was good but not really worth it. Carnitas - amazing  by far best for price. Taste great and good portion   For drinks I had spicy Paloma and a watermelon drink- watermelon was bomb.
La Condesa,189,Came here with a friend who s a chef here and it was one of the greatest decisions ever.  First things first  the service is GREAT from being seated and all though out the meal our server was very attentive and helpful. I accidentally spilled some water and guacamole and he wiped the table each time. He was very good at refilling our drinks and answering any questions we had.  I d like to start by highly recommending the ceviches. We had three and all of them were so mouth watering  This was my first time having ceviche and if you re a big sashimi person like me they are to die for  We had the hamachi  scallop  and tuna ceviche  Hmmmm    If you re with a group of friends or just really like guacamole you need to try the guac tasting  4 different kinda of guac and salsa with delicious chips  what s not to like  everything tasted very fresh    Now to the good part the main entrees  I had the pork belly and the marinated vegetables that sat on top of it was very good  the bread pita thing that was inter neath the entire entree was kinda hard to chew so I didn t care much for it  but the entree was delicious.  My fellow companions has the octopus  cauliflower steak  and empanada all very delicious  the squid especially was cooked to perfection and sat on top of duck fat potatoes... Mhmmm  The desserts were also good and very delicious and plating was in point    P.S. If you re allergic to mango don t get the papaya sorbet. Had to learn this the hard way...
La Condesa,190,The food isnt great or bad. Its just alright  you ll never crave their food  nothing unique  just your usual tex mex served in a nicer setting. However on Sundays  they have their brunch special   2 mimosas and bloody mary. That was nice  but make sure to ask for concentrated mimosas or extra orange juice because the mimosas were really watered down. I got a tortilla soup that came in a soup cup  so not very big AT ALL. That was  9  I d say its a little overpriced.  The place is definitely instaworthy though  really cute interior and furnishings. The outside is adorned with well cut wall vines and glass setting. There is patio seating so thats really nice too  If the prices were cheaper I think the restaurant would have more of merit.
La Condesa,191,I was meaning to go too LambERts across the streeet but they were closed for renovations.  So I picked La Condesa because it was close.   So glad I did.  Great guacamole and their arugula salad was super flavorful.  Enjoyed the experience and would return.
La Condesa,192,I forgot to take any pictures during our Sunday evening dinner here but we ordered 5-6 vegetarian and non-vegetarian small plates   salads   main dishes off the menu to share for a table of four. Each dish had unique flavor and was Mexican-inspired however they all didn t really flow well with each other. We ordered two varieties of their handmade corn tortillas however they didn t bring them out until half the dishes were eaten which defeated the purpose. The service was ok  no one really came around to ask how the dishes were and if we needed more water or drinks. I m not sure I would come here again.
La Condesa,193,I tried to make a reservation for this restaurant for 10 people I ve called I ve emailed I ve gone on the website I went on open table it does not allow me to make a reservation for more than six people no one returns my calls or my emails so I guess I am going to book the reservation at another restaurant just sucks because the bride really wanted to come here we are traveling from Florida to Austin and la condesa was one of the places she chose to eat but apparently we can t.
La Condesa,194,The service was good  but the drinks and the food were way overpriced and the flavor wasn t appealing.  The frozen margarita was like drinking skinny margarita mix without the tequila. I had the chili relleno and it was strange. It was topped with some strangely flavored greens. The peppers were red and stuffed with quinoa and watered down cheese. It kind of reminded me of oatmeal with peppers. The other person in my party ordered a pork chop which was undercooked and the mashed potatoes were so salty he couldn t finish them. We spent  72  were hungry an hour later and were regretful for spending so much for such mediocre quality food and drink.
La Condesa,195,Food poisoning beware    This place is  different   not good.   Disappointed. Overall the food was mediocre at best and not worth the price. Maybe get a drink and an appetizer but do yourself a favor and go eat somewhere else.   Flavors don t really blend  and the food isn t very good. I don t usually give bad reviews  but I wish I would have known so I wouldn t have wasted my money or time here.  The  Ambience  wasn t anything special either  again not impressed.
La Condesa,196,Must try  Upscale Mexican cuisine. We had the Huevos Rancheros and Pastor Torta and both were great. Their boca negra dessert is amazing 
La Condesa,197,This place is very beautiful. Their menu is small but everything is delicious and the staff is very knowledgeable. I got some mushroom toast thing from the appetizer list and bacon fat tortillas . We sat on the small patio in the bar to eat and it overlooks the street  and you can seat yourself  how did we get so lucky   there was also a plug so I could charge my phone. I tried the house margarita  amazing  with a lemongrass cactus   I think salt on the rim and it was SO GOOD wow everywhere should have their own salts to put on things because that was such a nice touch but how come they don t serve tortillas   You have to order it special   Flour is frickin cheap  man.
La Condesa,198,The restaurants ambience is a definite 4 but the food is a definite -2  the value is a 1  and the service a 3.5  so I m giving it 2 star.  What a disappointment   The marguerites were passable but the taste did not meet the premium price.  The staff was friendly but too over-attentive for my taste.  I do like a bit of private time with my companions when I dine and the wait-staff was intrusive.  As for the food   I d have to give it 1 star if being generous.  Starting with their signature guacamole and salsa tasting platter   How do you screw up salsa verde  Bland  watery and unpleasant.  The others just frankly missed the mark.  Perhaps the worst part was the the tortilla chips.  I m not trying to be mean  I promise you  but I ve had bagged tortilla chips from the grocery that were superior.  There were even the tiny broken pieces in the bottom of the bowl.  I m sorry  thats just NOT acceptable when accompanying a  18 appetizer.  Someone should bat we didn t head to one of the many amazing taco trucks around Austin.  We would have had a far better meal at a far better price.  Don t waste you money on the ambiance  nice though it may be  the tiny portions and slightly off flavors aren t worth it.  Maybe it was just a bad night  but somehow I don t think so.  Someone should be ashamed of themselves.
La Condesa,199,A new favorite. Great service with Knowledgable wait staff who are happy to make recommendations. A variety of family style orders that keep coming until you re full. We also enjoyed several different tequilas. All different and delicious. Highly recommend for date night or sitting and visiting with out of town friends.
La Condesa,200,It was Feb 15. We d had a beautiful stay in the W over Valentines  I cranked out a 5k that morning at the Paramount and I was excited to brunch it up at La Condesa. Chips  Salsa  Margaritas  Ai ai ai    The first thing to know  and you probably do already  is that the place is gorgeous. I m sure they ve got some brainy creative person behind the decor and the design. Funky and stylish and fresh as befits their offerings.  Edit  It s Alison Burke. Everyone hire her immediately.   I asked after brunch specials and our server indicated there weren t any so I ordered a Paloma. What arrived was a a ginger drink in grapefruit clothing. To be fair  the description does indicate ginger. I just wasn t expecting a full on study in ginger. Near the end of the meal  I discovered that there were indeed brunch specials. For one of my  12 ginger palomas  I could have indulged in 6 mimosas. Which I think we can all agree is the minimum you should drink at brunch.   Our guacamole was fine  if uninspired. No salsa by the way. That s something you ll need to purchase separately. Though I can go to any mom-and-pop Mexican restaurant and get fresh chips  the hip and oh so cool LC is rockin  El Milagro bag chips. Not ideal but not a deal breaker. That came next.   My Carne Asada Y Huevo was so salty that it was almost inedible. I m a salt person  I love salt  I ve been known to carry salt  The folks making my dish should have held back by about half. And while they were at it  tenderized the meat  I spent the majority of the latter half of my meal sawing away at the steak like I d just hit up the 4.99 steak deal at Golden Corral.   His dish  Cold. We determined that it was hot at one point but then after someone poured ice cold salsa on it  it had normalized to a temperature a shade below lukewarm. We asked our server about it  her temperament hovered at about that same temperature  and she was like  Oh I think it s supposed to be like that.  In two years of dating this guy  I ve never seen him decline a dish. He did so. Not just because of the temperature but also because the Huevos Condesa was completely tasteless. He declined to order anything else.  I don t want to be disappointed again.  Ouch.  I m not sure if our experience was an anomaly. It looks like the reviews run the gamut. After I signed the bill for our  70 brunch  each and every part of which was subpar  we left. Bereft and with that most overused of Yelp phrases ringing in my head   I really wanted to like this place. 
La Condesa,201,There s something about this place- I just like being here. The dining room is open and colorful with towering fiddle leaf fig trees and views of downtown. Service is always perfect. I d recommend showing up early and getting a half-off mezcal margarita or three. They make them like I would make them at home- strong  and with fresh lime juice.  For food I love the crab guacamole with green apples  the Hamachi ceviche with shaved yellowtail and calamansi broth  and the carrot salad- crispy local carrots with cardamom yogurt  currants  and so on.  Get the El Califa- steak tacos with fried cheese.  Also  did you know turnips are the new Brussels sprout  So try those too  they re local and yum.
La Condesa,202,I just can t with this place... I ve been here three times now  and I ve tried to make myself like it because it s a trendy interior Mexican restaurant on the 2nd street restaurant district  but it is just not that great.   This place is expensive. I know most people who come here probably understand this  but it is not just the 15-25 dollar entrees that are offensive  but the fact that they are absolutely tiny. They are not bad  but they don t blow my mind  flavor-wise. For instance  the last time I was here a few days ago  I had the chile relleno. The flavor was good  but the texture was quite soggy  no real crisp  not very interesting. Not what I expect when I pay  20 for a plate.  Also  their guac  we got the classic  is fine. I make better quac at home  and it costs under a dollar to make and less than 5 minutes to assemble  so unless their avocados are some super-rare-unicorn avocados  I don t know how they can justify the  12 price tag.  My husband s drink was weak  and the beer selection is kind-of unimpressive for Austin.   I have been here during happy hour  and that was the only time I actually enjoyed it. With significantly cheaper drinks and a few Mexican street corns  happy hour is worth the trip. But they only do it in the bar and you have to get there early to get a seat  because the bar area is tiny.   One final note. Every time I ve been in the main dining area in the evening  I see a table of older people reading their menus with their phone flashlights. If people can t read their menus  that s not ambiance  that s just stupid.
La Condesa,203,Atmosphere is cool  really neat space and really well designed.  Love that they ve got multiple floors and that the bar is raised on a mezzanine sort of level.   I give it 3 stars for these reasons   1 star for esthetics  1 star for drinks   1 star for service    I subtracted 1 star for food and 1 star for menu presentation.  The drinks were great  and seemed like everyone there knew it   The bar was packed  my friends got to sit while I stood.  I didn t mind at all it was a great and upbeat area   The host staff and bar staff were great   Our server was odd and super laid back but whatever that s fine   Still keeping that star simply due to the other staff.   The food got me  it was mediocre at best for the amount of   I spend on my food.  Flavors we re balanced but there was just nothing truly exciting and Wowing about it.   The menu was difficult to understand  I get it s a Mexican restaurant but for someone who doesn t speak Spanish it was a tough read  and to me didn t explain the dish well at all.   I d go back  but just for drinks and apps.
La Condesa,204,La Condesa is pretty much only good for happy hour downtown margaritas. Everything else I ve tried there is extremely overpriced for the quality and taste.   I also think it s really lame that they don t allow dogs in the happy hour area  and aren t willing to serve happy hour to people with dogs on their outside patio floor. Just seems dumb economically  lazy  and a little dog racist.
La Condesa,205, 2 For the incredible elote appetizer - crack on a stick.   2 For the extraordinarily tasty skirt steak entree  1 For the sweet and refreshing margaritas -1 For the raw   uncooked tortillas -1 For the pre-made  pureed  and seemingly refrigerated  meager portion of Guac for  12. Serves 6-8 chips.   Great spot  great location  great vibes. Seems like the menu was just a bit hit or miss this time.
La Condesa,206,Came here for a friday lunch and were able to get a seat immediately. Got the cubanesa  a mexican corn cob  and the dulce de leche. I asked to bring them out when they were ready  so I got dessert first  then corn  then sandwich  why is it a rule that dessert should come last  Am I the only one that prefers dessert first  .   The Dulce was magnificent  a bit too sweet for my tastebuds since I m not a big sweets person  but it was excellent nonetheless. The corn was great. But the sandwich was really mediocre. It was far too oily  usually that s never an issue for me  for a sandwich to be. I d give the food overall a 3.5 stars but really the price is what made me round down here. If you can find food  and drinks  for half the price  maybe not the dessert  with equal quality elsewhere  then it s not really worth it. Yep  that was a poorly phrased sentence  but you get the point.
La Condesa,207,In a town that is replete with Mexican Tex-Mex restaurants  this one simply does not rise to the top tier.   The service  including the front door staff  busser  and server  were all polite and efficient. However  nothing that stood out from any other average or better restaurant.   The margaritas were tasty  as I expected. That said  it was not a very generous size drink after adding the ice and the garnish. Maybe  12 each is a bit high.  Or maybe the have a HH special at some point  .   My real challenge was the food itself. The guacamole appetizer was uninspired. Fresh  yes  unfortunately the texture and flavor were lacking something to set them apart. My chicken torta  milanesa de pollo  was very difficult to eat. The bread was extremely chewy. I could not cut it with the knife and when I tried to bite it  it tore awkwardly and spilled ingredients all over the table. The chicken breast was fine. The spicy red pepper spread was actually a bit too spicy for an item on the sandwich menu  and I like spice  in general .   So  would I go again  Not sure I see any reason to do so. There are a dozen other better places within a mile  even some of the food trucks. Great location  so this is a sadly missed opportunity to be something special.
La Condesa,208,Food  many inventive options consistently delivered well. Vegetarians are well-received with dedicated items on the menu plus staff is open to easy modifications of plates.  Favorites  Avocado torta  hongo y huitlacoche anything.  Ambience  creative high-design space is unique and inspiring. Patio space fills up fast in good weather.  Service  consistently fast and effective.
La Condesa,209,La Condesa is something special. The interior is basically how I d like my dream home to look  and the menu is unique  delicious  and pricey.   Some of my absolutely favorite things are...   Watermelon and Elderflower martini- one of my favorite drinks in all of Austin  Sweet  light  and delicious   Tostadas de Cangrejo- these little tostadas had a HUGE amount of delicious crab meat on them. Awesome.   El Califa Tacos- wonderfully seasoned with an awesome crunch and flavor from the toasted cheese  Pollo Rostizado tacos- also wonderfully seasoned with a milder flavor. The tacos are also pretty nice sized so they are well worth the  9  Arabicos Tacos- again  awesomely seasoned. The flavors and textures just go really well together.   Coliflor a la Plancha- Yep  it s a cauliflower steak for  18. It may be kinda hard to wrap your head around that  but what they do to that cauliflower is amazing. The multiple sauces and the way they cook it are so good    Pulpo- this is a giant octopus leg  but holy crap they cook it so it s all crunchy and delicious on the outside and the spices are incredible  It was a little chewy  but the flavor was fantastic.   Service is always very good  but I did have a super snooty waiter once. He got a little pissy when we wouldn t order more than 1 thing each. I thought it was funny  but he was also pretty rude. Everything was still great    Things that aren t really my favorite here are the  Hurache de Hongos- I didn t think the mushrooms had very much flavor  Huitlachoe vida de Camaron- The ceviche was a bit too watery and it had a bit too powerful of a cocktail sauce flavor for me
La Condesa,210,Their food is absolutely delicious. Everything was so carefully prepared  and fresh - a true delight. The  lemon  salad was literally the best salad I ve ever had  and the taco selection was superb. Our waitress tempted us with the ice cream  and that too  was excellent Highly highly recommend 
La Condesa,211,Came here for lunch and got the Guacamole Tasting for an appetizer. The seasonal topping guac was my favorite  it had strawberries  and was very sweet and filling. The Chipotle and the Traditional ones were very good too. Sweet and smooth textures. For my tacos I got the Pollo Rostizado. The cilantro and salsa really complimented it and it made for a good taco. The second taco I got was the Alambre one. That was my favorite. The Salsa Chipotle was amazing and delicious and the taco was amazing. For dessert I got the Boca Negra  a flourless chocolate cake  and it was unique. It was a bit spicy since it has chipotle  but it would ve been better without it. Nonetheless  I enjoyed my visit. The prices are a bit high for what you get. Overall I m satisfied and will be back.
La Condesa,212,Delicious and original TexMex food. Loved the flavors  the atmosphere and the attentive wait staff. The drinks were good too 
La Condesa,213,I came here off the recommendation of Austin 360- Best Mexican restaurants. I came at an odd hour  1130am  as they opened . The space is very beautiful and quiet at that hour. I sat at the bar and ordered the Al pastor tacos. I think I ordered wrong - it s clear there s a knack for flavor profiling but the textures were all too crunchy that it didn t let the flavors of the Al pastor shine. The Sangria is very good 
La Condesa,214,Always a favorite  Delicious drinks and friendly staff. John went out of his way to suggest items on the virtual menu and drinks. La Condesa never disappoints 
La Condesa,215,Fun dinner for a group of 8. Lots of good choices to share. Chips and salsa were great as was the hamachi and salmon ceviches. We got the sampler for guac which was ok but too small. Loved the huaraches de Hongos y  huitlacoche mushroom masa  -great flavor of truffle  corn and mushroom.   Really enjoyed their take on chili rellanos -goat cheese and quinoa yum  Loved the fish and the pork shoulder tacos best of all the tacos we tried. The rest were ok or good but those were best. Street corn was recommended but arrived cold so didn t love it.    Drinks - enjoyed the watermelon martini and la condesa margaritas best of the drinks. The spicy marg was good too I hear but small.   Pretty space and a good spot for a group who wants to try lots of options.
La Condesa,216,Very good food with beautiful presentation.  Dessert is delicious.  The classic margarita is not too strong.   Portion is relatively small though.
La Condesa,217,Amazing food  atmosphere  and service  Highly recommend  Courtney was our server and she was amazing
La Condesa,218,I went here with my girlfriend for a date night  we got great parking in the garage right by the restaurant  the parking did cost 15 dollars but I cant complain because it was right by the restaurant.  As we rounded the corner and walked into La Condesa the first thing I noticed was that it seemed incredibly dark  now I get mood lighting and understand having the lights   dim   can be sort of romantic but it seemed insanely dark. The waiters didn t seem to be tripping over each other and dim lighting is hardly a big deal so I focused all my attention on the menu.   The Tacos are a bit pricey but they seem to be made with only the best ingredients. My girlfriend and I got the COCHINITA PIBIL   AR BICOS and the EL CALIFA so that we could share and have one of each. We also ordered the ELOTES  I am a big fan of Elotes and had heard that this is an incredible version of the Mexican classic.  The ELOTES was not a disappointment  its covered in cheese and some sort of chili powder that tastes like it is infused with lime. It may be the best corn I have ever eaten  the cheese and and everything on the corn go together so well its like a grilled corn dance party in your mouth.  The tacos were excellent  though all of them were plays on classic street taco s they were very unique and unlike anything I have had before. The cabbage and pickled red onion on the COCHINITA PIBIL provided a deliscious contrast to the roasted pork. The pickled cucumber on the ARABICOS blended deliciously with the venison and bacon fat tortilla. For me however the crispy manchego cheese made the EL CALIFA the real winner for the evening  every bite of sharp cooked cheese made every bite of  rare juicy beef taste better than I would have ever thought possible.   La Condesa is great  I cant say enough good things about it  bring a date and enjoy 
La Condesa,219,Disappointed.   My roommate and I try to go to a new brunch spot every Sunday so when la condesa was brought up we didn t hesitate.   We were pleased that there was no wait time and immediately sat down.   They have  2 bloody Mary s mimosas on their brunch special. My roommate had a Bloody Mary  I had a mimosa and neither is is were disappointed.   Our server asked if he could bring us some chips and salsa  failing to mention it would be extra . We were served chips  guacamole and four different types of salsa  all of which were pretty underwhelming  for the total whopping price of  17.   We then ordered a tortilla soup  which I will admit was incredibly delicious. Nothing at all wrong with their soup. I honestly wished I would have stopped there.   I then ordered chilaquiles. Big mistake. It came totally cold and I had to send it back. When it came back to me it didn t look any better. Long story short I didn t end up eating it. My roommate wasn t pleased with her dish either and we both shelled out  40    Unfortunately I will not return to La Condesa  even though they had a great tortilla soup and great ambiance to their restaurant.   No thanks.
La Condesa,220,I ll admit I expected this place to be more classic Tex-Mex and it appears to be going for something different. The venue and decor are more LA than Texas  and the menu has a lot of central Mexican dishes.   The chips and quac were my favorite part of the meal  and they have a good beer selection. I was underwhelmed by the rest of the meal  which included a mole dish and hanger steak.
La Condesa,221,Go for the mezcal if nothing else. Half off mezcal during happy hour is an incredible deal. We also got the street corn which was  4 and slammed. Don t let the 3.5 stars fool you. We ll be back.
La Condesa,222,We stopped by La Condesa for Happy Hour on Friday.  This place was very good.  Unique  contemporary Mexican cuisine.  Happy Hour runs from 5-7pm on weekdays.  During this time  the restaurant offers half-priced drinks and a special food menu offering about a dozen small plate items for anywhere from  2-6.  A great deal for sure.  The restaurant is named after the fashionable and youthful Condesa neighborhood of Mexico City.  Atmosphere is open  inviting  and trendy.  Very cool architecture and design.  Colorful mural artwork  light  billowy curtains  interesting and creative light fixtures  and decorative candle-lit walls made with broken cinder blocks.  I can see why this place is popular.  Our group showed up at the right time   5pm  because by the time we left  it was standing room only.  People at the bar were eyeing our table like vultures.  They swooped in as soon as the first person from our group stood up to leave.  We stopped by for drinks and snacks before dinner and a night out  so I only a tried a few things off their menu   Salsas and Guacamole - four seasonal salsas and traditional guac Elotes - Mexican-style street corn  Cotija cheese  chili powder Huitlacoche Sope - wild mushrooms  huitlacoche  yellow corn  farmer s cheese  queso chihuahua  epazote  truffle oil  The Salsas and Guac were very good.  Salsas ranged from the sweet and sour to spicy and smoky.  We ordered the traditional guac  which was smooth and flavorful.  Not chunky.  La Condesa also offers a few other guacs including chipotle   almond  pomegrante   queso fresco  and crab   apple.  I really enjoyed the Elotes.  It s a whole corn on the cob dipped in grated Cotija cheese and sprinkled with red chili powder.  The combination of powdered chili and crumbly cheese made for a savory and well-seasoned corn on the cob.  A small slice of lime was also served with the dish for additional flavor.  The Huitlacoche Sope was beautifully presented.  It was pretty intense for a small sope.  The many ingredients produced a wide range of flavors from the aromatic mushrooms to the pungent epazote herb.  The cheeses were melted.  This dish was also a bit salty.  Definitely one for the adventurous eaters.  Great  personable service.  Friendly bartenders and cute waitresses.  The male servers wore guayaberas.  One of the managers served our table and she did an excellent job.
La Condesa,223,Been coming here for years. I don t understand why everybody complains about prices on yelp. Go eat cheap food if your cheap. Don t complain about paying for stuff and leave bad reviews because you don t have the money lol.   La Condesa is unique  it s special to a region of Mexico. Seems like all the out of  towners come here expecting American nachos and such. This is for a foodie  someone with character who wants to expand his or her palette. Who wants to try something new and different. Highly recommend  I get iv spent a years salary at this spot and others in this city.
La Condesa,224,The food is ok. Although is not authentic Mexican as described on their website.  The portions are small for the price. And you have to pay for chips and salsa.  Updating my review... yesterday literally we were kicked out of the place. They refused to give us service because one of my friends  looked  too intoxicated. We were on a wine tour all day  so yeah  we ve been drinking. Although we were just asking for food not alcohol. We were not disturbing anyone  Or causing any kind of problems. They were super polite to my boyfriend  he was the only white guy on the group  so we felt disrespected because of our race. Perhaps wasn t because of that. But still it felt that way.
La Condesa,225,Interesting place we wandered into because the BBQ joint across the street had a 90 minute wait.   I noted that the couple in front of us did the same thing ... So  overall  the food was good  but the concept was a little strange.  More on that shortly.. I will start by saying the various salsas and Crab infused Guacamole was good.. not outstanding  but pretty decent.  There were four salsas and they mixed well with it.    The waiter said that the meals were more in the line of family style and they were meant to be shared.  We opted for a couple of different options.. Mole Dominguero was good  but why give 4 people 3 tortillas if its  family style ... also had the El Califa  aka Steak Taquitos.  Not bad either but definitely not enough - the waiter did warn us to his credit  but we weren t that hungry after the quac and chips  but still  this was a small portion for one person let alone 4.     We ended up ordering another of the Mole dishes and that sufficed.  I would just suggest they ditch the  family style  concept and they will be better off.  Food did not disappoint.   Picture of the El Califa to follow.
La Condesa,226,Yelp is a website by snowflakes for snowflakes. Yelp deleted my review because a snowflake said I did a personal attack on someone there. That s a lie. I never named anyone. I never described them outside of stature and hair color  as if that ll leave an impression in a city full of people of such stature and hair color .   I ll recreate the review with censored parts referring to humans  though  so the snowflakes who need restaurant reviews to be safe spaces don t get scared by anger at a convincing  miraculous portrayal of speech-capable brain death.  However  in the interest of fairness so everyone knows what a true personal attack looks like  I ll refer the reader to the current smorgasbord of Elites crying to one another about how a bartender they shared photos of at The Nomad is a filthy Black-hating racist  and the Hispanic owner is a filthy troll who loves racism. Cuz that s not personal at all.  a href  https   www.yelp.com biz nomad-bar-austin  yelp.com biz nomad-bar-a   a   shout out to Scott T for his mafioso sensibilities about human rights . It pays to be an Elite if you want to attack people by name and photo because you waited too long for a drink.       I wish I could say the food tastes good.  I mean  technically  I ate here once and it was okay but unmemorable. I honestly couldn t tell you what we ate. Maybe they had a crudo ceviche   The point is  I tried to eat there again.   Table for three  please.   Is your party here.   Lie     Truth   Truth. No.  In the most obsequious voice a minimum wage employee could ever muster   We PRIORITIZE full parties.   The fuck does that mean. Prioritize. As in  you wish there were full parties  Or  like  if five parties came to you at once  and four were complete  you d  prioritize  the complete ones on an ad hoc basis  What if the fifth became complete while you were figuring the other four out  Then does the fifth get  prioritized     I pass on the question.  the employee is a person with human descriptions but I don t name her because that d be only a Yelp Elite to do . I am hungry  and now wish to be drunk.  We will wait at the bar. Take my name. The third will arrive.   Later  the third arrives.  Okay  we ll look for you   the  amazing human I won t photograph because I m not a Yelp Elite accusing every tom dick and harry of racism  says when I update  the person because gender is a construct .  At the moment  we don t have anything.  This lie echoes in my head   I trundle to the bar. We drink and talk  waiting. I see a table of four get seated at a table for two. I see tables get cleared left and right and people plop down in them. I see a couple tuck into a table for four. I contemplate strangling myself in full view of the incompetent  people who are paid to help people get chairs in a restaurant they want to dump 10  of a paycheck on  in protest of my inability to get food at a table.  What the fuck does PRIORITIZE mean  La Condesa  Do your  disproportionately soft-skined seating staff  know what that word means  Do they mean it  If a table for three is complete  and was  in before  a table of two comes in and is told to wait  does that table for three get bumped down or bumped up  Apparently  down   I m sure the food s great. I wish the service matched.
La Condesa,227,I ve been here so many times hoping that the food will get better but the food is always just okay.  I love the decor and the atmosphere.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating .  However  I feel like I can t give more than 3 stars to just  okay  food at a restaurant.  The location is awesome and I can see out of towners flocking here from their hotels nearby but if you re a local  there are so many better places to eat.  I feel like I should just stick to drinks and a guac sampler from now on.
La Condesa,228,Ive heard a lot of buzz over La Condesa So finally i came around to trying it.  It was very underwhelming  everything was on the pricey side  and nothing really stood out from our meal. I had the tacos with steak  i the steak was bland so all you could really taste was the cheese crisp they had on it. i think it was called el califa  I also had the elotes  and was pretty excited for it  but it also needed a little salt  and definitely not worth the  5.  The ambience and the service was really nice though. Our server was attentive and friendly especially since we had a birthday. The decor was really posh and modern  very fitting of downtown austin.
La Condesa,229,I made the reservation on their site. Since the drop down only allowed for 5 guests I wrote in the comment section that there would be 6 people for dinner. When we got to the restaurant  not only were they not ready for a table of 6 but the host proceeded to give me a lecture on how I was lucky that this time they were able to accommodate me and that next time I should be calling them the day of to make sure it s okay. When asked if they received the notes attached to the reservation he said yes but the other host must not have seen it.   As for the food  it was sub par and not worth the price. If you order a  12-16 botana dish just be prepared to only receive 1 very small item that is not enough to share. The  16 El Califa tacos that we ordered looked like they had been sitting under the light for too long because the meat looked grey and the cheese was past crispy and overall just hard to eat.   Not going back and definitely wouldn t suggest.
La Condesa,230,Knowing that pizza and Mexican food is by far the cheapest restaurant food to produce and turn a profit  I m awarding La Condesa four stars. Beans  rice  formerly cheap cuts of meat ala fajita can mean big business and that s what you have to charge in a downtown setting like Austin.   Starting with cocktails  one of the worst mojitos I ve ever had. Something about the drink was bitter  having made them at home many times I rarely find one that doesn t have simple syrup. Redemption did come fast when I ordered the El Cubico. OMG  tobacco infused tequila  vanilla infused brandy  grilled pineapple juice  lemon...Its the first description ever for me that mentioned volcanic anything.  The food emphasized upscale street foods turned out to be well  how do you say bomb diggity in Spanish  The Mexican street corn was done up right as was the conchinita pibil taco. The guacamole tasting paired unique ingredients that produced vibrant flavors until the last bites were consumed.   I m also a sucker for huitlacoche which is hard to find these days short of a  30 a plate interior establishment. La Condesa even at happy hour prices provided small plates created with love. Service was good as well as the people watching downtown. A nice date for the wife and I. Christine  my pants sadly stayed on...at the restaurant
La Condesa,231,This place is delicious  The food was outstanding  The ceviche  and street corn were some of the best things I ve ever ate  My boyfriend got the tacos and inhaled them  The staff is super friendly  and the drinks are awesome as well  They have a full Mezcal and Tequila menu.
La Condesa,232,My friend and I went for happy hour at La Condesa and ended up staying for five hours  Our server  Oscar  was amazing   I went there to order margaritas  ceviche  and shrimp tacos and they were all INCREDIBLE  However  Oscar convinced my friend and I to try some different Mezcals. My friend and I have always said we do not like Mezcal BUT with Oscar s guidance and recommendations  I left the restaurant being a Mezcal fan  Ask for Oscar as your server when you go. We had a blast    All the food and drinks were incredible  10 10 
La Condesa,233,The food was excellent and surprising.   The host at the front door lied to my face and that eclipsed the experience for me.   How long for a table    15 minutes but there s room at the bar if you want to eat there.     No room at the bar  20 minutes goes by     5 more minutes  they are clearing the table for you now     25 more minutes go by and finally get the table     Just kinda whack to do that
La Condesa,234,The staff here are great  I had a great friendly service. The locations is good and the restaurant looks really nice inside    For me the food is the most important. I paid  50  tip for the worst tacos and guacamole I have ever had. Just four tacos guacamole and an horchata.   I don t leave reviews here often but I really want people to avoid this place. I get the price I know rent isn t cheap downtown and you have to charge but man I don t know if the cooks had a bad day but I had the Califa taco and a chicken taco and the tortilla was cold and dry and nothing special on the ingredients at all it was just bad. Honestly I know dozens of taco stands that serve better tacos than this.   The guacamole was just basic. It s not bad but I expect better they seem to take a lot of pride in the guacamole they even had a  sampler guacamole  option for  18.  It s just bad over all. I was starving and didn t even finish my food.   Props to the staff for great service but y all need new menus or new cooks I don t know it was just bad.  I m not a fan or torchys tacos but I would prefer torchys over this. As a matter a fact I don t even cook and I bet any amount of money I can make better tacos.   The horchata was really good so I ll give two stars for that.
La Condesa,235,My friend and I arrived for dinner on a Tuesday night  the hostess was very sweet and worked to get us in as we did not have a reservation. Soon after we sat down  I informed the waiter of my allergy to tomatillo and guajillo peppers. Having eaten at other Mexican restaurants  I know these peppers are used a lot  but usually there is enough on the menu for me to work around my allergy. The waiter seemed surprised by my allergy and left to find out which salsas had these two peppers. He returned and quickly listed two of the salsas in the salsa appetizer as having this allergy  but then left before I could ask him to point out which was which--another waiter had to do that for us.   When we ordered our food  the waiter looked at me and asked   And do any of these dishes have tomatillo or guajillo pepper   I was taken aback and asked   That is your job  I am not sure. Just let me know if there is anything I can t eat.  Sure enough  when we left the restaurant  I began to experience an allergic reaction to the food. Luckily my husband was there to pick me up and take care of me.   While all the food tasted good  if a touch too salty at times    my night was ruined by a waiter who did not take seriously my allergy. I understand allergies are a little sensitive now and there is suspicion that people might claim to be allergic to something when they really are not for a variety of reasons  but I can assure you that after spending most of the night curled up on the bathroom floor  I wish La Condesa had taken seriously my allergy 
La Condesa,236,I ve been to La Condesa a few times over the years and I always enjoy it  but I no longer feel blown away or wow d.  I recently went in for a friend s baby shower and was underwhelmed by the family style offerings.  Some of the items were good  I enjoyed the guacamole and salsas  but don t really dig the thick tortilla chips.  The flautas were pretty good  especially paired with the salsas.  The eggs were an over cooked disaster  when will kitchen staff understand the creamy goodness of a french style scramble   the Modelo negro braised beef was somehow bland and tasted like crock pot cooking  the quinoa crisps were like eating legos and I thought the rice and black beans was an odd morning pairing  but that s just me.  I do love the specialty drinks  so HH is still a possibility.
La Condesa,237,This is a late review since our experience was Friday and it s now Monday  but I m finally feeling human enough post bachelorette party to adult again. We had a group of 15 girls and La Condesa was amazing to work with  We selected our choice of pre fixed menu and the service and food was spectacular  All the girls in our group enjoyed themselves.
La Condesa,238,The vegan tostada with cauliflower chorizo is legit  I even asked them to make me a special margarita that was not on the menu and they delivered it tenfold  Our server was very knowledgeable and the food is always amazing  Looking forward to having a birthday celebration here soon
La Condesa,239,We went for my birthday  not only was the service incredibly slow but our waitress kept forgetting to put things in that we ordered. We spoke with the manager who must have mentioned something to her because she got very upset with us about it. The food was great but overpriced and couldn t make up for the service issues.
La Condesa,240,Beyond delicious.  I love Austin  I love the downtown area  and it was a place I d not been to.  Why not    Once we found parking  which was not so great   we were seated at 7pm  outside   on a Sunday night - but that Sunday was before Memorial Day  so I was impressed.  The service was prompt  she had great recommendations  and wasn t overbearing.  We had hamachi ceviche to start  which I would definitely order several of and eat as a meal.  It was incredible.  Dinner was a bit more family style - the hurache  the chile relleno  stuffed with quinoa    the pescado and conchinita pibil tacos  and the mole.  The portions are small  but it was enough food  and it was scrumptious enough to get the guys to eat quinoa....that s saying something.   We tried the spicy paloma and alma blanca for drinks  and we were not disappointed.  Very  very interesting cocktails.  I liked the ginger in the paloma the best  but the alma blanca was a bit more refreshing.  Despite visiting Austin several times in the past  I d never been here  but after this visit  I would definitely go back the next time I m in the area.
La Condesa,241,We hosted our wedding rehearsal dinner at La Condesa s Flour House below the main restaurant  and what an incredible experience it was  The servers were top-notch and food  amp  drink were delicious and presented beautifully. Communication was consistent throughout the planning process. Our guests were super impressed with the unique setting  and they kept talking about the amazing food even after the wedding was over  The Flour House is perfect for intimate event  and we can t wait to visit La Condesa when we are back in Austin 
La Condesa,242,The most horrible Mexican food I ever tasted.   Three dollar signs for Mexican food is just dumb. I went because people were  showing us around Austin.  This was the saddest Mexican meal I ever had.  Over priced. Small portions.  Over salted.   I got the Acapulco ceviche that came in a small sundae cup. It came with three small inch circular to tostada chips. I asked for more and the waiter gladly obliged to bring me more chips w my small 6oz   14 ceviche cup.  Venison taquito- which is actually too small tacos on flour tortillas which was over salted. All I tasted was salt. No other flavors.  Classic margarita - good  Mojito- don t bother. It was the worst Mojito ever.  It someone tries to take you here  put your foot down and say no. Or else you will be very disappointed and hungry after your meal. You will also end up paying  40 per person after too.
La Condesa,243,This place was great  Delicious and filling food  perfect margaritas made with fresh ingredients and cool atmosphere.   Guacamole  amp  salsa tasting appetizer and the huevos condesA were phenomenal    Definitely recommend for in dining tex mex fix 
La Condesa,244,The restaurant itself is ok  but I was extremely disappointed with the food. The pictures on Yelp show the corn with several half pieces to share. This was not the case it was a  6 corn that could not be shared. The food came with no sides even for the main dishes again not like the plates shown on Yelp pictures. The service was ok but they said they couldn t split the bill by individual even though I told the waitress before we even ordered. I was not a fan. Not at all authentic. It was ok but disappointing. They should just say in the menu that no order comes with sides.
La Condesa,245,I don t know how this place has good reviews. The only thing I can guess is that all the individuals leaving positive ratings are from out of state and are unaware of all of the fantastic restaurants Austin has to offer. This place is mediocre at best  pretentious  and the service is terrible. After spending  90 on two appetizers  one entree  and a drink  we went down the street to Manuel s and had a very satisfying meal for a third of the price. Save your money  time  and taste buds and go somewhere else.
La Condesa,246,I sat solo in the bar area where they offer a solid happy hour menu of drinks and snacks as well as full menu table service. Great crispy HH tacos - smaller in size but mighty in flavor  recommend the poke and squash al pastor tacos. Margarita has cactus lemongrass-salt rim for a unique flavor.
La Condesa,247,Very tasty upscale Mexican street food inspired restaurant. They ll suggest the guacamole but I think the queso is even better. Salsas are a must. Also really enjoy the tacquitos which are great for sharing. Cocktails are a little pricey for Austin but well worth it for some of the more interesting ones.
La Condesa,248,I don t understand those that rave about this place.  I came here for brunch one Sunday and my dish was a runny  bland mess.  I didn t eat half of it and I couldn t even make out what was in it  everything was covered in this terrible brown sauce and for the price I paid  Highly disappointed with my entire experience  service was also terrible.
La Condesa,249,Great ceviche dishes and amazing service  My new favorite spot in Austin. If you are a ceviche nerd like me this is the place to go 
La Condesa,250,Food was GREAT  pricey  but great. Also very different. The Elote was BOMB. They do a la carte for everything  so be prepared to spend a pretty penny. Literally a dollar per tortilla  and this tortilla is small. Our server was interesting to say the least  first  she told us to not move out of our chairs as this confuses her. And also  she made a mistake on splitting the bill and had the audacity to say  F ck  well  do you wanna just pay for her bill   WHO SAYS THAT. Atmosphere great  but service was literally a JOKE.
La Condesa,251,Our waiter Jaime was great  It was my first time here and he did an excellent job explaining things and recommending drinks  He even brought us his favorite dish on the house  The atmosphere was nice but it is a little loud
La Condesa,252,In town for the weekend and found this little gem for Sunday brunch. Great huevos rancheros. Enjoyed the guac and salsa too. But memorable was the spicy Bloody Mary which is exactly what we were looking for. The best part....they were  2    Go sit on the patio and have brunch and a Bloody Mary 
La Condesa,253,Our fuel spot before a night on 6th.  I was expecting fabulous tex mex  definitely not what it was. I feel like they re trying to be authentic while still trying to keep up with what s trendy.  I got the tortilla soup  I was expecting broth  but it was almost like some kind of hot salsa. Blech.  We got the guac  amp  hot sauce appetizer sampler.. ehh. I ve had wayyy better.   The only thing that sold me was the Elote.
La Condesa,254,The experience that I had at La Condesa is one that I will not soon forget   We were in Austin for a bachelorette party and had arranged for a private dinner at La Condesa.  The general dining area is filled with high energy  but we were taken to a private dining space on the lower level of the restaurant.  This space felt like our own private cavern   We were so excited to have such a great hide away for our special dinner.  We could easily hear each other and we were eager to begin our family style dinner   While dining  we enjoyed the following    Appetizers   Margarita la Condesa - Features a lime margarita with pineapple juice. YUM  Chips and Salsa - Too Spicey for me  but the rest of the group enjoyed it  Guacamole - AWESOME  So fresh  Ensalada de la casa - Simple house salad with a homemade dressing Hongos y Huitlacoche Huaraches - If you are a mushroom lover this appetizer is for you   Mushrooms  corn  and farmer s cheese.  Sweet  salty  and the meatiness of the mushrooms had me going for seconds  Tostadas de Atun - Sashimi tuna with pickles  shallots  and chipotle mayo - very refreshing   Main Dishes   We enjoyed the braised short rib  grilled head-on shrimp  the head is the best part    and citrus rubbed roasted chicken.  Each dish was well prepared  incredibly flavorful  and we couldn t stop enjoying   For side dishes we had the grilled green beans  the house black beans  amp  rice  and Mexican street corn  THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE THING  I had never had it before and I can t stop thinking about it  .  As if we hadn t eaten enough  they brought out dessert.  SO MUCH FOOD   For dessert we had the spiced  flourless chocolate cake with brown sugar-banana ice cream. Unfortunately  the spice in the cake would over power my throat  but I can t handle spice at all.  Others were able to enjoy it and I did like the ice cream.  I wish I could have had a bowl of just that   Final thoughts  La Condesa made a special night extra special for my bride to be.  The atmosphere  service  and food were all exceptional.  I would highly recommend this to any one looking for a great dining experience 
La Condesa,255,This fancy-yet-authentic Mexican food was to die for   Their family style menu was super easy to share and we each had the  perfect  amount of food to eat  Our waitress was super helpful. Also  not to be dramatic but their house margarita was the best marg I have ever had.
La Condesa,256,La Condessa must mean in Spanish the word  disappointment . We were really excited to finally eat at this restaurant  on the way to see one of our favorite bands at ACL live afterwards. So we walk in and I feel like I m in a nightclub because the music  not Latin music  is banging like I m at a club. We had to shout at each other the entire meal just so we could hear each other. We have reservations so we are seated promptly. We ordered guacamole but it needed some seasoning. I ask for salt and pepper  not seeing any at our table or anybody else s table  so 15 minutes later here comes our waitress with the small dish with salt on one side and pepper on the other side  there sren t any restaurants that I ve ever visited that didn t have Salt and pepper on the table. There are only 6 main courses and when you order one of those six absolutely everything is a side dish including the tortillas that you must use to make tacos with them. So you get three street tacos on 3 inch corn tortillas so I know I ll be eating at the event later.  Do you want some  sides  well it s seven dollars for half a cup of beans and six dollars for half a cup of rice so I can tell you I won t be coming back. If you get a main course  sides and you have to buy the tortillas because they are sold separately and you re guaranteed at least  45 per person. Not that it s a big deal but for little to no food it s not a bargain. They couldn t get us out of the place fast enough for the next reservation and the food was just mediocre. I ve had tastier and more filling street tacos just about everywhere and with more ingredients.
La Condesa,257,So disappointed in this place  especially considering the reviews. The dishes are extremely small  and we were told when we sat down that they re big dishes meant to split between people ... absolutely not. The service was even worse than the portion sizes. Extremely rude and sarcastic.
La Condesa,258,Read lots of reviews and made it a point to make reservations and come for what I was hoping to be stellar Mexican food. The restaurant itself it pretty and I liked the feel. The patio definitely needs fans like every other place in Austin.   Overall it fell flat. We all ordered tacos  mediocre   queso  just ok   Mexican corn  awesome      mojitos  I ve had better   and salsa  pretty good . Disappointing for  200.00 I would ve expected some pretty great food but it was all just blah. I d choose a taco truck first any day  Austin has so many great spots  no sense throwing hundreds of dollars out the window for sub par tacos.
La Condesa,259,The main reason I came here was the Dulce de Leche pudding cake which looks to be no longer on the menu. I know the pastry chefs changed and the chef who created it is part of the team at Launderette so I will likely not be returning to La Condesa after nearly a decade. That dessert was one of the best I ve had in America - from Michelin 3 stars to hole in the walls - it was incredible   Bring it back LC 
La Condesa,260,Had dinner reservations with a group of 8 ladies on a busy Saturday night. The restaurant was accommodating to our party arriving a little later than our reservation time  we called to let them know . Beautiful interior. Our server let us know that it was a tapas style restaurant and was helpful letting us know how many people each dish would feed. We started with the salsa and guacamole tasting. One order was easily shared among 4 of us. I ve never had lump crab meat on my guac- this is something we agreed we must do from now on  budget willing.  My least favorite was the almon and chipotle puree  perhaps because the puree was slightly sweet. To me those flavors didn t blend together. I liked all 4 salsas and that they were 4 different colors. The black salsa was the most unique and the yellow one may have been my second favorite. We shared 3 ceviches  Acapulco  Tiradito  and Poke de Atun. The fish all around was very fresh. It s hard to pick a favorite between them. I might lean towards the Poke de Atun just because I love soy sauce and there s a hint of it. At the table we shared 2 Arrachera entrees. At the server s recommendation we got tortillas and had it fajita style. He did not mention the tortillas were extra  but no one seemed to mind since we split the bill. That hangar steak with whatever marinade it was in  just melted in my mouth. The blue corn tortilla was the perfect vessel to eat it with.  I had secretly wished I had gone for a cocktail over my safe choice of a class of pinot grigio. Not that my wine was bad  but the ladies that tried the sangria  margarita  and the watermelon-elderflower martini were very happy with their choices. Not a place that my husband would probably go for as the entrees were very small portions considering the cost. From what I ve heard  their happy hour would be worth trying.
La Condesa,261,This place had ok food. However  the food is way overpriced for the amount of food you get.  The server was about. 4 out of 10.  The food also took 45 minutes to be served. With all the choices in downtown Austin I will not be eating here again.
La Condesa,262,Update   After sleeping on it I go up to stars. I spoke to some friends and it seems that this place is very strong hit or miss. Maybe just drink the booze here.   Original  Don t come here for happy hour. Food was beyond greasy and bar is so busy you won t get much or any service. Definitely not as good as the buzz. The drink I did get was awesome. Maybe they need more staff. I just don t know how a taco without meat could be so greasy.  The entre I tried was this  Acelgas 8.00. poteet texas spinach  giant white butter beans  pico de gallo  toasted garlic  salsa verde
La Condesa,263,Let our server Hugo decide our entire course for vegetarians on the table and he was super. We shared everything on the table and it was just perfect. Classy Mexican food with great presentation. Will definitely be back.
La Condesa,264,I thought this place was amazing    Great food  cool atmosphere.  I got the AR BICOS tacos because the waitress recommended them  and they were AMAZING. Steak tacos in bacon fat flour tortillas with pickled cucumbers and a yogurt sauce. I wish they came with more than two     I also got the side of Mexican corn  which was incredible.  The girl sitting at the bar next to me was able to order the nachos during happy hour  and they looked INCREDIBLE. She told me they were as good as they looked. Next time I go back to La Condesa  I will definitely go during happy hour and get the nachos.
La Condesa,265,If you like to enjoy bite size tostadas surrounded with some of Austin s most pretentious people under the shade of an obnoxiously  yet impressively  large fiddle fig tree then this place is for you.   However  their Mexican street corn is off the chain  The ceviche is pretty good for being 150 miles away from the coast.   Spicy margarita is on point  just enough heat to make you say  daaaammnnn .
La Condesa,266,In all honesty  boyfriend and I only visited because we had heard of their legendary margaritas  but I can say that we didn t leave disappointed by any of it   Other reviewers are correct in saying that it is pricey for each portion. However  if you understand that they are intending these to be shared things and that you should order multiple items to be satisfied  you will be fine  It may not make the price better  but to each their own  Our waitress did a great job explaining this  so we were satisfied in the end     Now  the food  Each of us got a Masa plate  along with the shared queso flameado  elotes  and chips salsa. The chips were great and had four salsas  all of which were really good  I appreciated that they were explained  and that there was a variety. The elotes  Mexican street corn   as mentioned by others  was delicious. It really is messy though  so be prepared  Queso flameado was nothing to write home about  but was yummy. We both enjoyed our masa plates as well-- mine was the tamal  which boyfriend said was in his top two tamales ever... And he is from the valley   and his was the huarache de panza de puerco  which was good but had a VERY strong blue cheese flavor.  We got their dulce de leche from the dessert menu... Oh my gosh. That was so rich  but all of the flavors were perfect and amazing. I wouldn t recommend eating one by yourself though- I think it would be too much to handle eventually.  Finally... The margarita. So. Damn. Good. That was the smoothest margarita I have ever had. The salt on the rim was a little different  so even as someone who doesn t like a salted rim  I am glad I had this one  Just get one. Don t question it.  Overall  I really enjoyed my experience  The food was great  the staff was amazing  and the atmosphere was awesome. Take some time to check it out   
La Condesa,267,Pretty tasty food but WAY overpriced.  12 for 2 small tacos   taquitos      Do NOT get the Swiss chard. It s the most over-salted restaurant dish I ve ever had.   My favorite was the fancy baked cheese side dish.
La Condesa,268,This review is based off my experience at the bar. I came here with a couple girlfriends to get a couple drinks before the 98 degrees concert at the Moody Theatre. The service was fast  the bartender was nice and didn t judge us when we talked about our childhood boy band obsessions.   I was a little surprised to pay  10 for a margarita that came in a small glass.. Yes it was strong but I expected at least a margarita glass. Next time I ll be coming for happy hour 
La Condesa,269,Only stopped in briefly to have a quick pre-dinner drink.  Tiniest  8 sangria  ever.  Not impressed.  However  the service at the bar was quick.  That saved them from only one star.
La Condesa,270,This has become a regular place to go to when I visit Austin during South By Southwest. Awesome chips and salsa  well  the salsa s great  as you get a tasting of four different ones. The chips are just normal chips .  Love the ceviche - I ve tried two types so far and both were amazing. The tortilla soup was very tasty and I would recommend it.  The tacos are good  although they are not really the reason why I go back to this place. Ceviche 
La Condesa,271,I hate when a place I used to really like just doesn t cut it anymore.   Here s the nitty gritty   Got rid of manzana salsa  best thing E-v-e-r  why is it gone  Tortillas are store bought now. Yep. Hubs realized just by looking.  Chicken Rostizado still good but way too much chicken to salad ratio. It was perfect before. Now  not so much.   A surprising good   Pambato sandy was good. But note  Very messy  The biggest thing  prices. We very quickly realized after a few things  no one around us the past 2 times had ever been been there  out of towners   tourist trap  hence prices that are out of range for what you get. IMO.  Sad  as they had some items I ve always liked. But it s just not worth the effort for us.
La Condesa,272,Noisy and overpriced. But  the food was great. Servers not very patient and attentive  especially given the insane prices. Last but not least  they served an overpriced glass of wine in a ridiculous water glass  with wine dripping from all edges  and on a giant tray with 20 other tequilas etc. The server put it on my table as she passed  you get the point  inappropriate serving service and container. I didn t manage to finish the wine because it was so difficult to drink it through the small glass opening with the thick rim. We were jocking that it looked like you are being punished for ordering wine in a Mexican-themed restaurant.
La Condesa,273,Typically  higher priced food comes with higher expectations  and unfortunately  La Condesa doesn t even come close to meeting them. I ve been here a few times for dinner  and have left every time feeling both underwhelmed and still hungry.  I will say that I do like the location  the atmosphere  and the plating of the food  it is always done well and looks pretty. There s just no flavor behind any of the dishes. Which is a real disappointment  because I just end up feeling like I wasted money every time I visit.  I probably won t make an effort to come back for dinner  as there are plenty of other options within a few blocks that I enjoy much better  but considering I have some friends that really enjoy the brunch menu  I might still give that a shot.
La Condesa,274,La Condesa has been one of my go-to spots in downtown Austin for several years. Whether its for a yummy and unique brunch  cocktails with friends  a business lunch or a scrumptious dinner date  La Condesa always meets my expectations and leaves my tummy completely satisfied.   Some of my favorites include     The Alma Blanca  - best.cocktail.ever. Not kidding  sometimes I literally stop in just to sip on one of these babies. A habanero-infused cazadores blanco  muddled with corn and pineapple juice  and topped with a hibiscus-rose-infused salt rim.. I mean  how could you go wrong. Try it  I promise you will love it    Guacamole Tasting - its a tasting of all their guacamoles  amp  salsas  including  traditional  chipotle pur e  amp  toasted almond  and jumbo lump crab with apple. Super delish.  JustDoIt   Chilangos - one of the most unique brunch dishes in town. Its a quinoa croquette topped with chorizo  poached eggs  baby arugula and salsa verde. Nom  nom  nom.   Acapulco Ceviche - I always go this route when I am looking for something light. Its extremely refreshing.    Pescado Tacos - If I am a little more hungry I go with this dish  snapper  cabbage  chipotle mayo  and salsa. Yum in my tum      Elotes - this is their Mexican-style street corn  and the perfect side dish. I always ask them to take it off the cob for me. But be sure to have them remind the chef to mix up all the ingredients for you pretty well  otherwise it can be pretty messy.   Boca Negra - this dessert is actually a new find for me. I highly recommend it  and promise you won t be sorry you ordered it. Its kind of like a molten cake with a bit of a spicy kick  caramelized banana and brown sugar-banana ice cream.  If you are in the downtown area  you should definitely stop by La Condesa. Friendly staff  great atmosphere  cool bar area  and delicious food and beverage. I will continue going back for years to come 
La Condesa,275,If you come to visit this establishment here is a list of things you will need or should do.   1  Bring your own salt and pepper shakers 2  Do NOT come hungry  3  Take your grandfathers old hammer and crack miss piggy  aka your piggy bank  open or take a small loan out  4  Bring a flash light in case your eyes are not cat like   Ok here we go-- We ordered the guacamole with chips as an appetizer which tasted ok but definitely was not worth the  12 price tag  The entrees were way over priced for the portion that you receive. The chicken mole had very very little mole sauce with it. True chicken mole is smothered in it.   This restaurant was classified as Mexican which is wrong. This is a tapas style restaurant that has you spending your hard earned    for little in return. The flavor of the food was alright but not worth the high price tag. Not a very good example of a tapas restaurant.   Service was ok but here again not quite what should be given for the amount you to shell out.
La Condesa,276,Literally stumbled upon this place on a gorgeous Friday afternoon in Austin.  I finagled my way into their bar area and it happened to be happy hour...SCORE  I had a few of their margaritas and their almond and chipotle guacamole. The Alma Blanca cocktail was fantastic   I ve sampled my share of margs and tequila cocktails  but this one was VERY unique.  Its a slow sip cocktail  but potent with many layers of flavors.  I followed it up with the Margarita Condesa.  I thought this would be their version of a classic marg  but it was quite different and delicious  but then again any cocktail with pineapple and tequila is right up my alley. The guac with chipotle puree and almond slivers sounded a little sketch  but it was also fantastic   The added crunchy layer to the creamy avocados and spicy chipotle was AMAZING. Service was pleasant without being overbearing.  The bar area filled up very quickly and there is a great patio that would have been fab since there was no humidity  but the inside space is pretty sexy too.  From my corner table i noticed Lots of beautiful people come and go in waves.  This seem to be a bookend bar for a fun friday night in Autsin.  Ages ranged from late 20 s to early 40 s -- in case you re interested. Condesa is a great place to sit back and enjoy the view while sipping a unique cocktail 
La Condesa,277,Some of the best service I have ever had. Adriana  was amazing.  Dinner was delicious  We have the guacamole tasting  the ceviche  and the steak taquito. It all went perfectly with the pineapple margarita Adriana recommended.  Dessert was to die for  Caramel cake  which is not always on the menu but it should be.  4 stars because the restaurant could use a sprucing up.  Our booth had a rip in the bench seat that had been covered with black electrical tape.  The menus need to be removed from the dirty plastic covers.  Get rid of the very very uncomfortable table pedestals.  There is no place to put your legs.  Lastly scrub the tables clean.
La Condesa,278,Wow  I wish I worked or lived nearby so that I could enjoy this food more often. Met some friends at work. Great and quick seating. Very good staff. And the best Mexican food I ve had in Texas. I had the mixed salsas and qua online that I highly recommend. Also Thad the tosdas al pastor. Very very good. Wish it didn t come with chips and slightly more heat than expected  but I m a wuss and it was very good.
La Condesa,279,Boujee Mexican tapas. Great cocktails. Get ready to spend a bundle. Enjoyable  lively ambiance with both indoor and outdoor seating. Cool upper level bar area. Looks like it would be great for groups. Lots of open tables even during prime time.
La Condesa,280,I love everything about La Condesa  The signature margarita is delicious  the salsas are fresh and flavorful  and the carne asada was absolutely fantastic  It s hard picking out my favorite part between the drinks  food  atmosphere  and fantastic service  The manager Justin is a treasure 
La Condesa,281,Food comes fast.  Great the first time  lacked pizazz each time after.  Uncooked street corn  but great cocktails.
La Condesa,282,Small portions for the price  think 2 tacos for 13 bucks. Service seemed used to the empty lunch hour  inattentive and unaware. Food was bland and under seasoned. With so many great Mexican food places in the city of Austin  this one needs a bit of work.  Also beware  they offer chips and salsa but charge 5 bucks.
La Condesa,283,Visiting Austin for the weekend and surprised by how good this place was  Every dish we ordered was perfect. Make sure you try the guacamole and salsa tasting platter...veggie salad with guacamole was healthy and tasty...I was too busy enjoying the food that I totally forgot to take pictures  P it definitely deserves five stars on Yelp  If you are like me visiting in town  this place would be a great choice if you had too much of the awesome Texas BBQ   
La Condesa,284,This was my second visit to La Condesa  the first time was 5 years ago and I gave it a 5 star review. This time was barely a 3. I think they are skating on a old reputation. The menu was small and uneventful. I found the fish dish we ordered to be uneatable. The general manager stopped by to apologize. He could have offered to buy us a drink or dessert but no such thing. Just bad business. I know we won t be back.
La Condesa,285,Cold  stale tortillas  chicken tacos with a hard to define green sauce. Expensive.  The food was so bad and the wait was so long that they comped our meal without us even asking. At least they know how bad they are.  Hard to understand how this place survives. Don t be fooled   this is very bad Mexican food. Austin can do better than this elsewhere. I ll never be back.
La Condesa,286,We came as a large group and we were seated in the basement level in the private dining room. Because of that  they only offer the prix fixe option for the entire group.   With that being said  I enjoyed everything that was placed in front of me. Nothing was poorly made.   The 3 salsas and guacamole that they served with the chips at the beginning was delicious. I could have become full from that alone.  I really enjoyed the appetizers particularly the mushroom flatbread was a hit with the group. My husband really enjoyed the grilled corn.   The meat in the entrees were cooked perfectly - juicy and not overdone whether it was the chicken or the beef.   The pitchers of margaritas that were made were great and not watered down. They were strong but still delicious.  Service was prompt and friendly.   The private dining room is absolutely gorgeous and a must if you are celebrating a special event  It s the perfect space.  I d return just to order off the regular menu. I have no doubt if they re this good at serving a large group  the food will not disappoint.
La Condesa,287,The atmosphere was very inviting. Nice decorations and interior design. When it comes to the food  the quality was less than desirable. The taquitos and chips were exceptional appetizers  but the general consensus among our party of 7 was that the entrees missed the target by a large margin. Great place to go for drinks and apps  but I would skip the main course here and go somewhere else.
La Condesa,288,First and last time coming here. I believe the prices are too high for such small portions and the food was cold.
La Condesa,289,We stopped in for a few drinks before dinner and were pleasantly surprised by the friendly atmosphere and rockstar bartenders. 2 drinks  could I really provide a 5-star review based on 2 drinks  Oh you wait and see.  The Alma Blanca Margarita was made with a habanero-infused blanco tequila and began with a muddled fresh corn base. Seriously  I almost told the bartender to stop when the corn came out but I was in heaven when the ish hit my taste buds. The icing on the cake was hibiscus  amp  rose-infused salt on the rim. A fragrant masterpiece   The El Cubico Margarita was made with a tobacco-infused tequila. Yes  tobacco. It smelled like it  it tasted like it and it lingered for a long time. The extras were vanilla brandy  grilled pineapple juice and saffron salt. Cigar smokers enjoy 
La Condesa,290,From the outside La Condesa looks like a great place  I walked by it a few days before I went to try it out for brunch.   We were sat quickly and greeted by our server who was a little lack luster  no energy just kind of blah. My friend and I were looking over the menu and she asked if we wanted a drink  I politely said  Not right now   and she took the drink menu away....ummm.   I decided on my order  huevos condesa  and then asked for the drink menu again to take a peek. The menu didn t have any brunch drinks so I asked if they had bloodily mary s  mimosas and she said yes  they were  2 during brunch.   Anywho  the food was decent  nothing to rave home about  but our server was just plain blah. Totally mediocre experience.
La Condesa,291,The salsas authentic. The guac traditional was good but not amazing.  The chicken taquitos we re great.  The service was excellent.  Comparable to La  Cuchara in Houston but not quite as good.    Htown 4 lyfe.
La Condesa,292,Came here for a Saturday brunch and was thoroughly impressed.  Food was fresh and very good. I had the Huevos Condesa and sampled off the plate of many of my friends. Everything was good.  The staff was good and very attentive. The music was also good.
La Condesa,293,Great food and great service. The tortillas are quality and their chips are crunchy. They have plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.  Great mixed drinks and excellent margaritas  A   
La Condesa,294,Never disappoints  I would give them more stars if I could  Their food is so amazing at every bite that you can taste all the variety of flavors   I can not express how much I love coming to this restaurants. Definitely a place to go to if your are visiting Austin 
La Condesa,295,The food is decent. But the prices are too high for such tiny portions. You will pay  30 per person to leave still very hungry.
La Condesa,296,Just finished eating there.  The flank steak was not awesome but it was quite rare  salty  and chewy.  The pork chops were only good.  Guacamole sampler was good.  Ceviche was good.   Just don t bring your Starbucks drink in from around the corner.  Even if it s fresh and you haven t taken a single sip they will take it away from you if you want to stay and eat.  I should have deducted the  4 that got poured down the drain from the tip.
La Condesa,297,We decided to give the happy hour a go last night and were we glad we did    Wes was our guide and bartender with fantastic suggestions and excellent drinks. I loved the classic margarita enough to have two and the grilled corn dish was DELICIOUS    My hubby loved the fish sandwich  can t recall name  and although the cumin flavor in the dessert we tried was strange  it didn t stop us from finishing it off. Favorite part was watching the staff interact with each other. They obviously enjoy their work and each other  which is always a positive sign at any restaurant. We would definitely be here at least weekly if we lived near Austin  
La Condesa,298,Good margaritas  mediocre food  terrible service.    Things got off to a bad start when trying to call for a reservation the night that we wanted to try La Condesa for dinner.  I called to find out whether they had any tables available and was told that despite the fact that they were slow  they could not take my reservation.  They stop taking them at 5 pm every night.  Brilliant strategy - you wouldn t want to lock in guaranteed new business  right   I went anyway because I had told my girlfriend about my experience with their margaritas the night before.  That was my biggest mistake.  All the dishes showed potential but were small and poorly executed  especially for the prices being charged.  Bland and small guacamole served with an overly large bowl of chips  no additional suggestions from the waiter about what to do with the rest of them .   Tortilla soup with undercooked and fatty chicken.  Huaraches with interesting toppings but overcooked crust.  Brussel sprouts with bacon that would have been good if they had left them in the oven long enough to be soft and have a char.  Supremely average chicken tacos.  Service was lacking in many ways.  The low light was when the waiter essentially did nothing about the inedible chicken in the tortilla soup.   I will never come back to dine  but may return for a margarita at the bar.  Their staff has a lot of work to sustain their food business.
La Condesa,299,I loved everything when I went here   Great atmosphere and also unique gourmet Mexican food  
La Condesa,300,I read about La Condesa s happy hour from different websites and blogs. It is located on West 2nd Street  not too far from the main downtown area. The atmosphere in the restaurant was pleasant with outdoor seating as well. The happy hour area was VERY crowded after 6 PM when we arrived. It had the bar section  some seating and small outdoor patio seating as well. We got lucky and scored two seats at the bar. I ordered the Margarita La Clasica and my boyfriend got Margarita La Condesa. We both liked the classic better. It was sweet without being too much and very strong - beware. We also got the happy hour salsa samples which featured 4 types of salsas with chips. We both enjoyed this  This was a good experience  but due to the wait time for a real table we did not eat dinner here.
La Condesa,301,This is where yelp disappoints me. This place was amazing   If you are expecting typical Texas-style Tex Mex this is not what you are locking for. If you are looking for unexpected  eclectic Mexican dishes filled with flavor this is your place. I would call it Mid-priced Mexican tapas. Though the food looks like what you would get at a high end tapas restaurant the environment and staff are unpretentious and very friendly. The mushroom share plate  I can t recall the name  is off the chain.  Cojita  mushrooms and truffle  what a combination    Everything was amazing. We were so full so we had to forgo dessert  but the menu looked awesome  Next time   Thank you for a fabulously unexpected dining experience 
La Condesa,302,Had a Mexican martini which was good - a must have in Austin I hear . Went back again to have a regular margarita - also tasty and some street corn. The street corn is awesome - we wanted quest but they didn t serve that until the evening unfortunately.
La Condesa,303,This restaurant isn t cheap but it s sooooo worth it     I had the most amazing street corn there  as well as a couple of excellent drinks  and a great dessert      What a wonderful meal 
La Condesa,304,Went on a Wednesday night around 6 PM. Did not have to wait and was seated outside in the shade. Inside was not very busy  but most tables outside were full.   Most of the tables are in the shade and surrounded by a fun and lively area. Would definitely recommend for a casual night where you want to enjoy the weather. A little more on the expensive side but there were several more moderate options  the taquitos section for example   I got the cauliflower dish -- absolutely love cauliflower so this dish was awesome. Not filling enough for a meal though  went home and was still hungry.   Fun gum  chicklets  at the front by the hostess station. Our waiter was great and timely.   Would not recommend La Condesa if you are looking for a heavy tex-mex meal  but would recommend if you are looking for a light and eclectic way to eat Mexican food.   The architecture  atmosphere and decor in itself is worth visiting La Condesa for.
La Condesa,305,Love this place  Came here the first time just for drinks and it was so great we decided to come back for dinner. They have some great dishes  including venison tacos  steak tacos with this melted crispy cheese on top. The drinks are a hit too. I highly recommend 
La Condesa,306,Braised pork tacos were so good    Wouldnt recommend the sangria though- it tastes like slightly flavored water   Call ahead to make a res. Seems like this place gets pretty packed at dinner time.
La Condesa,307,I had nothing short of a fabulous experience here. I have two separate parts for this place - Malverde  their upstairs private event space and the downstairs restaurant  La Condesa.   Malverde--I arrive to assist with setup and to ensure the place is up to the client s standards. I was greeted very nicely by the manger upstairs that evening and we went over a few things the client wanted and he was more then willing to oblige and even knew of these requests before I got there. He didn t seem bothered when I talked to him about the request. He offered me water and I waited for the clients to arrive. Malverde is a cute and perfect place for a little cocktails and apps. There s a small outdoor patio for people to visit also. The bar is large and aesthetically pleasing - the staff was wonderful up there    La Condesa- While the clients are drinking and chatting away upstairs  I came down for dinner. I ate a late lunch so I had a small dinner but boy was it yummy  The house salad is WONDERFUL. I need that dressing recipe ASAP. The salsas are fantastic  something for everyone. Avocado blended with tomatillo  tomatillo  chipotle and some other one that was the hottest of the 4 but I wasn t disappointed. My server was on it. Extremely patient and courteousand well versed with the menu and ingredients. When I ordered my salad without cheese it prompted him to let me know there s butter in the rice. With his help  I stayed away from all the dairy tonight and I m thankful for that  haha.   I will be back with my girlfriends -- even the upper bar is cute for drinks before a night on the town. Service was perfect and the food was delish. No complaints here.
La Condesa,308,Salsa and guacamole were eh...ok I guess  Grouper was pretty good Service was no where near what u would get at uchi or odd duck. Music Good god I m not sure what they were thinking but bad bad bad bad. Bad  Ok once Probably won t go back.
La Condesa,309,I went here on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. It surpassed my expectations. I started off with the el cubico drink and the guacamole sampler. The drink absolutely blew me away. It sounds like a strange bit of ingredients but was the smoothest  most amazing drink ever  For my meal I had the cubanita-absolutely incredible. From the service to the food to the atmosphere  everything was perfect.
La Condesa,310,I ve been to Condesa for a grad party  in their private room - check that ish out  and I thought it was gorgeous  so I decided to come back for a Sunday brunch.   Now Condesa - like everyone has stated below - is beautiful. The food is pretty good  but holy hell you want to charge me  12 for one avocado worth of guac  Not even kidding about that. The waitress saw my face and asked if I would like her to take the bowl  let s be real - it was maybe the size of my hand when cupped  and I actually said yes.   To be clear  I have no problem throwing down for food but this guac situation was just offensive.   The mimosas were  2 though  so that reinvigorated my soul. Then the mimosas came and I pulled an Amy Schumer and asked if they could hold back a teensy bit on the OJ because they had really OJ d it down. They also don t do carafes for whatever reason  no biggie for me  and there are no real brunch specials aside of the  2 mimosas which was a bit of a bummer.   They did have salsa and chips  but they don t do salsa refills and they come in very small little tin cup things.   Basically. I m ALL about paying for good food and I would definitely consider them for a private party because they have a beautiful underground little room that they rent out  but they are stingyyyyyy on the specials.   Now I would be curious to try their HH because it s apparently half off from 5-7PM and their drink combos do look great  but it is  only  at the bar which is a little small so you ll need to snag a spot early.
La Condesa,311,The Masas and bistec asado were quite tasty. It is severely over priced but the food was solid and a cool experience. The Gaucamole sampler was a bit underwhelming...way too many chips and a small amount of gauc...usually the ratio is the opposite but it is a bit annoying. All in all it was solid a-okay 
La Condesa,312,Everything we ordered tasted like it was cooked on a campfire grill. All you could taste was smoke. Extremely overpriced as well
La Condesa,313,The house margarita lives up to the hype but Condessa was not that great  too sweet . Definitely stick with the house margarita. The taquitos were a solid choice  not the best tacos I had in Austin but a solid choice.   Ambiance was trendy and fun and the service was fantastic. They were very accommodating and handled our group of 7 well. Overall  a nice sit down Mexican restaurant in Austin. If you re looking to go somewhere a little more upscale  this is a great spot.
La Condesa,314,We went to this restaurant after seeing several stars. But I have to tell you that it is really an OVERPRICED mexican food with a mediocre quality. When I say overpriced is just 5 tortillas for  5  We ordered mushrooms that came very spicy. My husband had to return it. They brought back new ones without spicy on it. The second round of cocktails came after we ate everything. The guacamole was not very fresh   12 .
La Condesa,315,This was my third time eating here and it has been consistently bad.   This last visit was with a group of 9. Our server had a bad attitude and seemed upset that we were there to have a good time and take our time. Drinks took a long time  the food was  basically  all the same color  and the decor still feels like it s trying too hard.   My portion of the bill covered two people and for  120 I would rather eat almost anywhere else.   I did enjoy that they played 3 My Morning Jacket songs throughout the evening   
La Condesa,316,I had heard so many good things about this place so I came in with high expectations. First the valet parking is a joke- there are only about 5 spots and once they fill up  they won t valet any more cars. The food was mediocre at best- the waiter keeps pressuring you to get guac and salsa. We got the traditional guac which was very bland and the four salsas which we never really ordered  the waiter just said to me  you want salsa with your guac right  And then added on the salsas to my order  were just four variations of thin  pur ed liquids  no chunks of tomato  peppers or anything . And once we got the guac and salsas  the waiter then disappeared and did not return for a long time.  The food in general was served cold room temperature. We got the cochinita pibil taquitos which were bland and cold. The steak taquitos were tough  cold and covered with melted cheddar that had then congealed hardened because it was cold.   I am not sure why people think so highly of this place. Overall service was not good and food was mediocre. I would not go back to this place 
La Condesa,317,I m actually shocked this place doesn t have better reviews  I thought it was the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a   I had the carrot salad and the cauliflower steak  which were both recommendations from the server. The carrot salad was INSANE- I actually got another one and ate that as well  fatty . Definitely get that.  We had one of each desert and those were all amazing  as noted above- fatty .  Cute ambiance too 
La Condesa,318,Had a very forgettable experience here on a Friday night. Firstly  the waiter lacked personality and wasn t very cordial. Whatever happened to good customer service  Oh wait that s right this is Austin.  We ordered a few appetizers  and when the guacamole came out I thought it was a mistaken side guac that was delivered. I m not sure why they charged  12 for a half avocado. I mean what s up with the tiny portions    We then ordered all of the entr es  which were brought to us within a few minutes of each other for staging purposes. Portions very small  but the food was decent.   It was obvious that the waiter had forgotten to put in the chicken so I reminded him as we were finishing the entr es  and then 30 minutes go by and still no chicken. I reminded him once more  and he said well he wanted to put it that order later so everything was spaced out. He basically lied to our faces  as it was apparent that he simply forgot to put the order in. Another 10 minutes go by and no chicken. One of our party members was saving their appetite for this chicken  and when he came by again with no chicken I told him to just cancel it. He wasn t apologetic  he just looked baffled and unemotional.  It was an awkward and forgettable situation - the only reason I will go back to this place would be to have drinks at the bar.
La Condesa,319,My friend had her company launch party here and the place is beautifully designed and the service was very nice. The food was delicious and so were the drinks. I was a bit sick that day so the bartender made some awesome ginger ale with real ginger extract which was my saving grace that day. I ll be back again 
La Condesa,320,Pretty disappointed with service and food. Ordered appetizers and drinks  took forever to arrive. Then 30 minutes after being seated  we were asked for our dinner orders.  Two of the folks at our table ordered the shrimp  which was overpriced for the unfresh  rubbery  over salted  stinky seafood that arrived. The squash underneath was soggy and the sauce was a weird flavor. I couldn t finish more than 4 bites- I kept thinking I ll find a good shrimp   And it came highly recommended. For  5-7 you can get the bacon fat tortillas  which are good  but not for that price   Tortillas aren t even standard with the steak   So yeah  find another venue.
La Condesa,321,Few vegetarian options. But the ones that are on the menu are excellent. Had the brussels sprouts dish without the bacon  tasted the Chile relleno  and had the cauliflower dish. All were very tasty. The guacamole sampler was excellent as well  of the four on offer  one had crab  they substituted for our table with a plant-sourced one . Cool vibe  good outdoor seating  good service  open late. We ll be back.
La Condesa,322,I came here for my birthday dinner and had a group of 5 of us- and we were all disappointed. The atmosphere is the only good thing about this place. The menu is small and hard to understand  and everything is pretty pricey for the little amount of food you get. Our waiter told us 2 times she was worried about how we would still be hungry after we ordered but we had all already spent at least  20 on a meal. The portion sizes are ridiculously small. We ordered queso and there was almost no cheese. Overall we were not happy with the place. The location is great and so is the decor but that is it.
La Condesa,323,Meh. This place is just another  14 margarita hipster spot. I had a friend from college arrive in Austin for the first time on business. We got together while she was here  and I decided on La Condesa based on some good things I d heard.  We arrived at 8pm on a Tuesday and were told it was a 45 minute wait. We proceeded to the bar area and ordered the aforementioned  14 margarita and screamed over the music in order to be heard. After a 75 minute wait  we were finally seated. It s a sort of tapas-but-not-really place. Shared plates  Or not  The waitress didn t give us much direction. We ordered 4 plates for the 3 of us. Food was ok. So  between paying for parking  in Austin  but technically not the restaurant s fault   the drink and the food  I spent about  75 and left with a sore throat from yelling through our conversation. Won t be back. Wouldn t recommend.
La Condesa,324,Amazing brunch special- 2 mimosas and bloody Mary s  Got there right as it opened for brunch on Saturday and was a little nervous because we were the only ones there but by the time we left there were a good amount of people there. We got the guacamole to start and then each tried a different entree  they all had very fresh ingredients and tasted very authentic 
La Condesa,325,I m sooo not impressed with La Condesa. I ve been two times for lunch  both at the urging of friends or coworkers. I was definitely unimpressed with my  15 greasy torta  but since it was on a friend s Austin restaurant bucket list I gave the place another try.  We ate at the bar and the service was really good for as busy as it was at lunch. I ordered the pork shoulder tacos  but the bartender told me they were  super spicy   and urged me to try the steak tacos instead. So I did. But like  if something is SO spicy that the waitress is recommending that someone who likes spicy things order something else  maybe the kitchen should consider toning down the heat.  But the dish was a MESS.  13 for two tacos on regular-old-out-of-the-bag-close-to-stale corn tortillas topped with some fatty pieces of overcooked steak and greasy  almost burnt fried onion straws. Completely dry with no sauce or salsa provided.  And the rice and beans were absolutely atrocious. The refried black beans were devoid of any salt  herbs  or seasoning. I m assuming all of the salt was reserved for the mush they called rice. I mixed the rice and beans together and everything kind of balanced out.  All in all  super disappointed considering the prices and hype for this place.
La Condesa,326,This is an odd one. It was really overall good but I am somehow called to report it as just  OK . It was a Friday night at 7 30ish. The food is very good. High quality ingredients for the most part.  I will say the  1 thing that has me saying I will not return is this  after a long week on a Friday night I wanted my favorite Tequila in a simple straight-sided rocks glass to sip with a cold beer. I know costs  I know spirits  etc  etc  and after the server acted like I was ordering something from outer space because I didn t want their contrived little wood plate gimmick with a shot of the tequila  shot of the Clamato  or whatever the serve  and limes  what is this  1985  ...I was served the tiniest most pathetic pour I have ever seen...like ever seen...and hit for  14. That was nonsense and a terrible way to set the stage.  Next weird and totally surprising thing  the chips were like they came out of a bag. Really surprised when such a simple thing can make such a big impression. Other than that  everything that came out was very tasty and well prepared.  Guac tasting - Good but tiny ramequins of the salsas was irritating. Two of them were so close in flavor profile as to be hard to distinguish from one another. The guac itself was good but essentially just a little plop with three different  toppings . Nothing that impressive and for something like  18....huh  Wish I owned this joint...awesome food costs for sure.  I think this is the issue. Yes  good to great flavors  Hamachi Ceviche truly awesome   but very expensive for what you receive. Feels like a place trying too hard to  elevate  dishes. Putting things in a  small plate  presentation and charging crazy prices may impress the hipster-ish kids that seem to pack every place in this town and spend like they all have huge trust funds  once again the California-effect no doubt   but while I m typically not at all price sensitive  for some reason this place struck an annoying chord. Not a Per Se  NYC  chord sort of thing where you go-in knowing you will have 15 thimbles of micro-greens for  800 plate but still sort of weird considering what it is.  Oh  our server was only fair as she clearly wanted to turn the table. We had no plans of hanging around but from the moment we sat down  it was a go-go-go pace without a chance to breathe.  Otherwise  nice space and very good food overall...but not a place to which I d go back. They really blew it with the Tequila and service right out of the gate. BTW - three dollar signs  Hmmm.  Have fun...
La Condesa,327,So underwhelmed that I m writing this review while sitting in the restaurant. This place was on a couple different lists of Tex Mex restaurants to try while in Austin. I m wondering if anorexic models with no taste buds put those lists together. The portions are small. And I mean SMALL  The food is fine. Not good. Not bad. Just fine.   So what did we get  Well  my friends and I ordered a  12 guacamole to start. We didn t mind the price. We live in Manhattan. We re accustomed to paying a premium price. But we expect a premium meal in exchange. Usually a  12 guacamole starter comes in one of those stone bowl situations. You all know the one. Not so at La Condesa. Here  they bring you a little tea cup  no joke  for a table of four to share. The real kicker  It wasn t fresh. It had very obviously been prepared as part of a larger batch rather than being made to order. Thumbs WAY down.   I wasn t terribly hungry  so a friend and I asked the waiter if the salad was shareable. He said yes. We ordered one. When it arrived  we sat for a minute waiting for the other plate  assuming they split it for us in the kitchen. But no  fellow Yelpers. The portion was just absurd for sharing. Even amongst two people who didn t want much to begin with. So we ordered another one. For the record  the entire salad was comprised of a fistful of lettuce  a few scattered tomatoes  sprinkled cheese on top  and after a scavenger hunt  I managed to find some tiny pieces of jicama and avocado mixed in. Are they sure they can spare it   The only reason for two stars rather than one is because the servers were perfectly nice  everything came out quickly  yadda  yadda  yadda.   Skip this place.
La Condesa,328,Came here for happy hour and it was great. Entire drink menu is half price from 5-7 so if you like fancy tequila s definitely give this place a try.  The food was good too  couple tacos and Shiite peppers along with street corn  order it off the cob though  were all crazy good.  The bartender recommended a great tequila based off the type of whiskey I normally like  can t go wrong although the caveat is that I ate the bar early in the night. I can t speak for the dinner service  but I d definitely come back to try it out.
La Condesa,329,I visited La Condesa for the first time and i would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant     It s a more elegant side to Tex Mex. Delicious meals  lunch or dinner you can t go wrong.   I ordered the Pollo Rostizado which were the roasted chicken and cilantro tacos  it had incredible flavor. The cocktails are also perfect    The atmosphere is very nice inside and they have a great outdoor patio area for the cool Austin nights and people watching.   The staff was very welcoming and the service was impeccable.   Please give La Condesa a try  no reservations needed for lunch  but for dinner i would recommend calling ahead because its a popular spot 
La Condesa,330,I went there for a work dinner last week and let me say that the waitress was amazing. She was kind  quick and had wonderful suggestions. Here s why I m not a fan.  We were told that it is a  family-style  menu and the dishes aren t really designed to be entree s. The problem for me was that there was not really enough of the dish to go around. There were 5 of us  and one dish equaled about 1 bite person. So it felt like I was just tasting the possibility of dinner. The prices for these a la carte dishes are pretty expensive. It s really more of a tapas bar  not that I have anything against tapas bars   it just wasn t enough to satisfy or to give me an adequate representation of the dishes we ordered.  We had the following    Guacamole tasting- This was good  I enjoyed one with the chipotle puree the most.  Mixta Salad- This was good  nothing spectacular  the vinaigrette was tasty. Hamachi- I didn t have this  it only was enough for 3 of 5 in our group so I opted out. Tostadas de Atun- This was surprisingly good. It looks like a slice of tuna on a tostada chip  which wasn t exactly visually appealing to me  but it was a good mix of flavors. We got to have 1 chip each. Mole Dominguero- This was one of the ones I liked most. The chicken had really good flavor. But could not taste the mole whatsoever.  Chile Relleno- This was my favorite. There wasn t enough of the pepper  it also served about 3 of 5. The others that tried it didn t like the mornay  but I really enjoyed it. It was very rich. Bistec Asado- This was good  we each got one bite  I really wished there was more. It was a wonderful flavor.  Queso Flameado- This was good  a skillet with cheese and corn tortillas on the side. We each were able to get one tortilla about half filled with cheese. Also something I wished there was more of  as it was very tasty.   We had dessert also  Dulce de leche- Absolutely wonderful dessert.  Boca Negra- This was amazing simply because of the banana ice cream and the way it offset the spice in the cake. The cake on its own was overwhelmingly spicy and I could not taste the chocolate after a couple of bites because my taste buds were more focused on the spice.   Drinks   Margarita de Condesa- It was good. Great happy hour price of  6. Could not taste the tequila  but it had a lot of flavor and did not taste like a basic margarita. The cactus-lemongrass salt was different but good. El Cubico- This was my other drink. The volcanic saffron was something I had to try. The whole drink in and of itself was different  but really good. I can t say I would try it again  but for a shot in the dark at something new  it was good.  So  as you can see we really really did try a lot of options. I didn t leave full  in fact an hour or so later I kind of wanted a snack. The food was good based on what I tasted  nothing knock my socks of good. I also can t say I would put the restaurant at the top of my  must go to again  list  but it was a pleasant evening and a food adventure for sure.
La Condesa,331,House margaritas were tasty. Upgrade the tequila and it will be better. Also  I m a no salt on the rim kind of girl  the bartender put it on the rim anyway and wow  I am glad they messed up  The salt rim has dried cactus and lemongrass with a touch of sugar. I couldn t get enough. So good.   The venison tacos should be a daily staple in my diet. Fantastic. The meat was cooked perfectly. House made tortillas were delicious. The chicken mole was not that great. I m a mole fan and try to taste as many and I can get my hands on. Their s wasn t that flavorful. The chicken was very moist and cooked just right. However  the dish was really just lacking taste. The chips are not even worth eating. So blah and boring.   Stick with venison tacos and rim-salted margs are you will be good to go. Oh  and the atmosphere is very cool. Very nicely decorated.
La Condesa,332,Service   fine. Except when they said these dishes are to  share family style . No they are not. If you want any tortilla you will buy it separate for  5. The quesadilla had no tortilla. Again....another  5.  The carne asada was  38 and was a NY strip steak - cooked perfectly - but was NOT a portion to share. Chips were super extra cost and a 2 person cup of guacamole was  12. Should be listed at       not   . Taste great but nothing was for sharing and was not worth the cost. Disappointed and would not recommend.
La Condesa,333,The food was very good but the portions were extremely small for the price.  I was grateful the server steered me away for the ahi tuna taco for  17 when she told me it was a single taco and a very small one at that.  She wasn t kidding.  Instead  I ordered the chicken tacos which were 3 incredibly small ones for just a little more than the tuna one would have been.  Everything except the roasted cauliflower my son ordered was small portions.  A meal for 4 people ended up being about  200  granted most of us ordered 2 mixed drinks .  The margaritas were exceptional but again priced on the higher side.  The spice heat level was also on the higher side and I am not a wimp when it comes to heat levels but I would have preferred to either know going in or be able to request the heat level.
La Condesa,334, 18 for chips and salsa   This place is extremely overpriced for the amount of food we had. We had a few things on the menu and nothing stood out and we left hungry after paying  100 for  two. We left very disappointed and went to Bobs around the corner for some real food.
La Condesa,335,I came here because it was recommended by Andrew Zimmerman. First of all  I know I m Asian but I grew up pretty much Mexican so I know my Mexican foods. The tacos were just okay in my opinion and the street corn was not impressive. Not even close to the elote man who I used to buy it from after school as a kid..for  1. So yes  it s overpriced. I think this place is overrated. It s good but I ve had better.
La Condesa,336,Ordered the steak  guacamole  and tortillas. Got our guacamole and tortillas  noticed a roach crawling in our booth. Told the manager and walked out.
La Condesa,337,Alright  so I m probably not the demographic for this since I know Mexican food. I don t know if this is the attempt to make a very fancy situation out of Mexican cuisine but it s execution is overpriced and overrated. The menu isn t clear -- are we sharing  Is the portion enough for us  What is the purpose of the menu being so confusing  I just think this was unnecessarily bougie for a place that has mezcal and guacamole on the menu. You get 2 stars because fajitas were  40 -- nope. Do yourself a favor and go find a  40 Steak somewhere else.
La Condesa,338,The ambiance is very nice and the staff is lovely and accommodating. They reflect the behavior of a restaurant that takes pride in its customer service. The food is a bit lack luster. The Poke At n ceviche I had was decent but it lacked the excitement and diverse flavor profile I was looking for. The queso fudido wasn t anything special. The food definitely left me disappointed with the experience.
La Condesa,339,The portion for the restaurant were small for price  it is suppose to be tapas styles Mexican but the entrees were small in comparison to other places in the area. I had fish tacos and they were alright. Others in my group had the Chicken Tacos and they said they had no taste. the queso appetizer was cold and hard on arrival. Margaritas were nothing special.
La Condesa,340,I am giving La Condesa 4 stars for overall experience and not one thing in particular.   My experience began a bit oddly. My sister and I walked in around 7 30pm on a Thurs. As we entered we asked the hostess how long a wait for be for two people. She responded that it would be about 45 mins  but she has a table avail outside and inside. We asked what she meant and she just repeated it as if there was something wrong with us. There wasn t - her vagueness was just really strange. Anyway we opted for the seat outside and it was amazing. Great little patio. And no 45 min wait.   As we sat and browsed the menu our waiter greeted us. Really nice guy  I believe his name was Jo  I could be wrong  but oh well. He was pretty awesome as he let us just relax instead of making us feel rushed. He made a few recommendations on what drinks to have  suggesting that the bartenders are well versed in tequila drinks. We took him up on that and crushed a few jalapeno infused margaritas. They are amazing.   For our meal we decided to do a little sharing. For our apps we ordered the guacamole sampler  and the Mexican street corn. Both were fantastic - my fav guace was the chipotle offering.  Next up we ordered the the carnitas tacos. They were absolutely delicious  however they were not the best I ve ever had  or even top 5. Def good quality and presentation  but they feel a bit short  they were still delicious . Finally for our sharing plates we ordered the Mole Dominguero s. That  I would say is prob the best mole sauce I have ever experienced. Words don t properly describe the flavors. Must try.   My sister is a baker at Tartine in SF so she takes dessert VERY seriously. Since the pastry chef at La Condesa has been given some great accolades as of late we decided to try a few. The Hoja Santa was bonkers  and the boca negra blew my mind. I m not even a sweets eater and I couldn t stop with both of these.   All and all I d say the food falls between 3 1 2 - 4 stars. The experience was def 4 stars. I d come back next time I m in Austin.
La Condesa,341,I happened to dine there July 14  2017. The restaurant is beautiful. The waitstaff were awesome  Very attentive and were happy to explain ingredients in the food. I found the food to be unlike anything I ve ever eaten  but very tasty. The prices are a little on the high side for me.  The only thing that bothered me was the volume of the music. Way too loud and distracting. I am not sure one could carry on a conversation comfortably.
La Condesa,342,My friend booked the Flour Room for a private diner with 14 friends for her boyfriend s  my buddy s  30th birthday. She choose one of the three Chef Menu options that is required when booking the room. 11 out of the 14 guests  including myself and my wife  got food poisoning and had to miss work the next day. She called the restaurant multiple times trying g to get in touch with the management team but got NO response after two weeks. When they finally responded he asked for proof that we all got food poisoning. Really  Give us proof that your food was cooked right. We re the customer. And we will not be going back.
La Condesa,343,Had the chicken tacos  queso fundido  Aracherra and the best thing was the burnt sugar banana ice cream. I was not a fan of the food  the service on the other hand was on point. Probably won t be back.
La Condesa,344,Perfect everything   This place was phenomenal  named after one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in Mexico City .  From our wait staff  Jesse Rocks   to the food... we had an incredible dining experience.  Small plates were fun to share and the Elotes bowl was simply delicious.
La Condesa,345,Really good food. The restaurant has a cool vibe and neat setting. The downstairs private dining room is really neat. Don t expect this to be a cheap quick mexican dinner because it is not. It is however  fresh and flavorful.
La Condesa,346,Stay away from this place. Worst service in austin. Very expensive for the quality of the food you get. They charge you for salsa  chips  and tortillas. We order 4 appetizers and it took 1 20 minutes to get to the table we only got 3 . The waitress came to the table a total of three times in 1 20 minutes . She was rude the first two times. She third time she was nice just to get a tip.
La Condesa,347,I m on a quick business trip to Austin and the La Condesa was just around the corner from where I was staying. I have to say that I m glad I stopped in. The service was bar none some of the best I ve experienced. Five different people came by my table asking if I needed anything. My waiter  Hugo  was highly experienced in both the cuisine and the history in the vast selection of tequila. Certainly a must experience while in Austin.
La Condesa,348,Delicious  From the salsas  margaritas and cuisines. I ve come here multiple times while on business in Austin and look forward to visiting again 
La Condesa,349,Really good food  great service and good people watching on the patio.  For people that complained about the prices  they re right on the menu.
La Condesa,350,I highly recommend the Guacamole Appetizer  the Alcapulco Ceviche and the El Califa Taquitos. All were excellent  Especially paired with Familia Torres  De Casta  Garnacha Carignan.
La Condesa,351,Had brunch here with my girlfriend and two friends who were visiting Austin. I had the Huevos Condesa which was great. Portions were decent sized and service was great. Only complaint is that the menu was not extensive and it s a little on the pricey side for a brunch spot.
La Condesa,352,I visited this place for my first time....  I was going for happy hour... the bar area was full  then they placed us in the dining area    They failed to tell us even though it was happy hour they DO NOT HONOR HAPPY HOUR in the dining area... AGAIN  They do NOT tell you this.   Their specialty drinks are served in a small glass with a big price    Their food was good but the portion were small.  There are better options out there    The waiter we had was here then gone for a long time service was terrible for the price  reviewed the menu like it was a pain and explained family style but still didn t understand how it was family style there....  I will never return to this place especially after I saw my bill and wasn t told they didn t honor happy hour pricing in that area....
La Condesa,353,When in for Happy Hour which was half priced drinks at bar.  Decor and ambiance are nice  how ever bartenders had little personality. When entering the establishment the hostess did not even look at us and the bartenders did not give a welcoming greeting when my friend and I sat down at the bar. Margarita was just your average run on the mill margarita. Most likely won t be retuning.
La Condesa,354,One of the better happy hours in Austin. My favorite drink is their watermelon martini. Also don t forget to try out their nachos on happy hour    You won t be disappointed.
La Condesa,355,Location is cool. Downtown near ACL.  But the menu is very mediocre. I think they had like 7 or 8 main entrees.  That s it.  They are all  20  and have no real sides.  And....best of all....they threw on the 20  auto-tip.  So for 2 with a margarita each...you are talking  100 .   Sorry....but you have to  wow  me to charge me  100  for a piece of chicken and some chips salsa.
La Condesa,356,Lunch yesterday there. Burger is priced  15. Although it was tasty  the tiny meat patty on a regular sized bun made me sad. In fact  everything my party of 4 bought was that way. If our lunch for 4 had been  30 instead of over  50  we might go back. As it stands  ZERO chance.    5 for a  selection  of salsas.  The fact people like this place is proof of how spendy Austinites are. They can t have that much of my money.
La Condesa,357,Came here this past weekend for a friends Birthday Brunch. The place is super cute and has a great location but the food wasn t overly spectacular or anything. The mimosas must have had expired OJ or something because we all took a sip and thought we were going to throw up immediately from the sour taste. We went with the  2 bloody Mary s  which were actually really good. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros for my meal. It was fine and a really nice portion size. I d go back here for the vibes if invited for something but probably wouldn t recommend to a friend.
La Condesa,358,Attitude attitude attitude. Avoid at all cost. We ended up leaving before even ordering because our waiter had a chip on his shoulder and every time we asked questions we felt we were like we were an inconvenience.
La Condesa,359,Came here before an ACL show for some happy hour drinks and snacks.  I love love love the half of everything alcohol.  Had the elotes and they were very good.  The tacos were.... well  small.  Very small.  Like two bites.  But they were tasty either way.  Our server was very nice and prompt.  I recommend sitting out on the happy hour patio as it s nice and shaded.
La Condesa,360,I ve been here a few times. once for margaritas and recently for dinner.  I think La Condesa has one of the best margaritas in town probably because of salt concoctions they use.  For a downtown upscale place  the prices are in line  but the portions could be more. Dinner and service was actually quite good which reading some the reviews here tells me La Condesa probably needs more consistency -  one of the hardest things for restaurants. Service was professional  personable from all of the 5 or so people that attended our table.   ELOTES - street corn  COLES DE BRUSELAS - Brussels sprouts  COLIFLOR A LA PLANCHA - roasted cauliflower  HUARACHE DE HONGOS Y HUITLACOCHE - roasted wild mushrooms   ROUTE STOCK PINOT NOIR - Willamette 2013   The Brussels were roasted and my favorite dish even though it s a side. Uchi Uchiko has one of the best Brussels in my opinion and theirs is right along with them. Mix it with the roasted corn and you have a fabulous side. I wasn t as impressed with the wild mushrooms but my vegan GF loved it. We both enjoyed the roasted cauliflower - the price of it   18  not so much.  The mark up on that dish must be 1000      anyway we thought there was an off menu secret vegan dish that other yelpers mentioned but our server didn t know anything about it...  and when we made reservations we mentioned we wanted a vegan dish but my guess is that message didn t make it t the chef.    All in all I would say 3.5 stars.  Yelp really should make half stars available. La Condesa was not average but was not exceptional either.  I d go there again but with all the choices in town it would not be on the top of the list.
La Condesa,361,Ugh. Why is this place on so many lists as  hip Mexican   Why did I waste an Austin meal here  I could have had about a hundred awesome tacos at a food truck instead.  The regular guac was decent... but so expensive for a 3 inch cup size of guac. Definitely nothing to write home about.   We also got the pork belly which was extremely dry and tough  and we sent back. The chef felt that the texture and cooking was fine but made us a new one. The new one was slightly better.  The branzino was pretty good. I ll give it 3 stars.   Drinks were meh - we got a margarita and a spicy something. The salt was nice  I ll give it that.   Service was weird  the guy was not super friendly and then he said could bring us some salsas. But then charged us for it. At that point I didn t bother complaining.   So basically  it s fine because it s straight up downtown. It sucks because it s everything I should have ran from.
La Condesa,362,   La Condesa combines a very impressive atmosphere with a creative and tasty menu that is nicely prepared by the talented kitchen     La Condesa is a modern Mexican restaurant located in Downtown Austin.  La Condesa is open for brunch  lunch and dinner and their brunch immediately reminds me of LA s Playa in how it showcases contemporary takes on Mexican and Latin dishes.  I would say La Condesa one ups Playa a little because their menu feels more ambitious and creative.  Brunch started with an amuse bouche of agua fresca with pineapple and avocado sorbet.  I m not a big fan of agua fresca  to me  it often just tastes like a water downed drink  but I think they did a good job with it by adding the sweet and tart pineapple and the creamy avocado sorbet.  I started with their diver scallop dish  which was raw scallop topped with lemongrass coconut cream and garnished with grapefruit caviar  grapefruit slices  avocado  and Fresno chile.  This was a great dish and of the many good raw dishes I had in Austin  La Condesa  Uchi  Uchiko   this one might have shined the most.  The scallop was soft and moist and there was a great combination of flavors from the sour grapefruit to the cool  refreshing and lightly sweet lemongrass coconut cream.  I also liked the avocado  very fresh and nicely cut  no oxidation  and I liked the heat provided from the Fresno chile.  For my entree  I opted for the chilangos dish  which was a contemporary as well as Mexican Latin take on hash.  The base of the dish was a fried quinoa croquette.  I m not a huge fan of quinoa  but I think they did a great job here.  They prepared it like a hash brown so you get this great crispy  crunchy and flavorful crust while the center still tastes of quinoa.  The croquette was topped with wild boar chorizo hash.  While I am not sure if you really get any special wild boar flavor from this since they season it and grind it so much  but it was meaty  flavorful  moist  and with a good amount of heat.  There was also great leafy and fresh arugula and two poached eggs.  The poached eggs had good runny yolks  but a little bit of the egg white went uncooked.  The dish was topped with a very good salsa verde where you could really identify the tomatillo.  For dessert  I opted for their dulce de leche pudding cake.  And from the presentation of this dessert  as well as just reading their dessert menu   desserts are definitely not just throwaway desserts here  they really try to put out impressive desserts to provide a complete experience.  That being said  I was not a huge fan of the dulce de leche pudding cake.  The dulce de leche pudding cake was kind of like a molten cake with a caramel center  but there was actually not much cake.  Instead  it was almost all dulce de leche center and it was too rich and sweet for me.  I like the idea of doing non-chocolate molten cakes  Hatfield s used to put out a good peanut butter one   but I did not think this was as good as it could have been.  The garnishes were kind of a mix bag.  I liked the cream cheese ice cream--tangy and creamy.  I also liked the caramel corn.  The saffron and sweet corn puree worked because it was not that sweet  it was a good compliment to the dulce de leche pudding cake  but I am not sure if it could stand by itself since the non-sweet flavor was a little off-putting.  Service by Ashley was great--friendly  polite  professional  and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.  Prices were reasonable.  A lot of their brunch entrees were around  12 and the portions seemed to be generous enough.  In addition to their great food  good service and enough bang for your buck  La Condesa offers a very nice atmosphere.  LA excels at putting out really thoughtful decors and atmospheres  a lot of attention is paid to the look of the restaurant--maybe even too much with not enough time spent on perfecting the food .  But outside of LA  you will find a lot of restaurants with really just thrown together dining rooms.  La Condesa is different.  It is in a great space with high ceilings and an industrial floor  modern hanging light fixtures are subtly contrasted by throwback Edison-esque light bulbs.  You also get nice murals  vegetation and a mix of blond wood booths with brown leather backings.  The music was also good and the bar lounge area upstairs looked very lively.  The only thing I did not like was the high school cafeteria-esque  IKEA-esque  chairs.  Other than that though  it was a really contemporary place bursting with energy.  I really liked La Condesa.  The restaurant was good in so many areas--quality of ingredients  kitchen execution  creativity  service  atmosphere  and fair prices.  And excelling in all those areas is a real rarity  but La Condesa seems to really pull it off  which makes it a great restaurant in Austin and really a great restaurant anywhere.  There are a few nearby paid parking lots.
La Condesa,363,This place is my new favorite Mexican food restaurant and they happen to be butt sniffer er dog friendly  The interior decor is beautiful and the mural in the main dining room is worthy of a museum on it s own. Love Love the kitschy interior decor but since I had my Pup with me we had to sit outside and thankfully the weather was as perfect as it could get.   A friend called me for some after work cocktails and appetizers while I was at Auditorium Shores and this place happened to be within walking distance and dog friendly so it was the perfect choice    When we arrived with my Pup they let us know that she was not allowed on the 2nd floor bar area - no problem...   We started with a pitcher of Sangria with real bits of strawberries and kiwi and orange - Yum    And the appetizers practically blew us out of our seats happy and I am not referring to high powered farts   The food was just amazing. We had the  forgive any typos as I do not spell Mexican dishes correctly   Hongos Y Huitla something or other  crisp corn tortillas topped with wild mushrooms  cheese and truffle oil  with amazing earthy rich flavors. The Ceviche was out of this world fresh and creative with grilled grapefruit and lots of cilantro. The Mexican style  street corn  was also fantastic rolled in ancho chile powder and cheese.   We filled up on appetizers  so  I can not wait to return to try their entrees.
La Condesa,364, Haha  the Feds can t touch us now  boys   We ve got this sweet set up  they ll never find us down here.  Hell  they can t find their own ass with a bloodhound.  But this  this is genius.  Cool  quiet and hidden.  We ll set up the booze on this side  see  and then take the tunnel under the street to our decoy business on the other side.  Hell  the guvment did us a favor with this Prohibition bullshit.  We re gonna make a mint   Fuck the Feds   Here s to Prohibition        This is the scene that played out in my head as I checked out La Condesa s underground private party rooms. Oh  you didn t know they had that right   Neither did I  until we came here late one night  10 minutes to closing  with a group of 6  and not only did they graciously invite us to dine  but they also turned on the lights in The Tunnel for us to check it out  btw  5 stars for the service  still 4 for for the food.  The tortilla soup was icky  very almost creamy tomatoey  and the cochinita tacos were tasty if greasy .  What a great place for a Prohibition Party   The first room has a Foosball table  a stellar liquor cabinet that lights the bottles and really cool artwork.  Then you duck  low ceilings  into the next room where they have a table set up to feed 18 comfortably.  The only drawback for me would be remembering to duck my head  through the doorways after 5 martinis.  Apparently  contrary to my fantasy  this was actually called a Flour Room where dry goods were stored  and there used to be a tunnel that ran under the street to where Lamberts is now  which used to be a general store.  It s a very interesting and historical looking area  with it s bricked walls and low rounded doors.  Very secret.  Very sexy.  Very  Boardwalk Empire .  Makes me wanna put a feather in my hair  a filter on my cig  pearls on my neck and garters on my thighs with a Derringer tucked in nicely.  ohhhh yeeeeahhhhh......
La Condesa,365,Smarty Pants Server Knock Me Out of My Pants Guacamole Fancy Pants Chile Relleno Buying New Pants Me
La Condesa,366,My husband is a major foodie. Literally our vacations are built around cities with reputations for good food- fancy or casual  we don t discriminate.   On a recent trip to ATX my husband researched restaurants and found La Condesa. I was super excited after looking on Yelp but disappointed when the meal was over.   Pros  Modern interior and design. Awesome build out  Nice service staff. Decent prices for a nice restaraunt. Good bartenders and cocktails.   Cons  We arrived to the restaurant during heavy rain. Our initial table and seats were wet due to a roof leak and awkwardly placed next to a giant indoor plant. Like awkward enough that it was hanging over you. Just a piece of advise to management. Ditch the plant. It served no purpose where it s place and seems intrusive. Perhaps another spot would be better. BTW this was a four person table along the window by the patio.   The menu was small and there were no specials off menu. They were also out of 2-3 top sellers.   The dessert  This is what sealed the deal on my disappointment. My husband is a meat guy and I m sweets person. I love dessert and I literally hated this dessert.   I can t remember the name but it was the equivalent of a chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream. I believe it was served in a flan type dish.   The chocolate cake had a pepper or spice in it. It was the worst identity crisis I ve ever put in my mouth. Not that having an entree with ghost peppers wasn t enough but to put it in my dessert too  It should be a crime to do that.   I digress....but  before I do that I must tell you I shared my thoughts with the waiter.  He asked   I got the impression he agreed the dessert was odd based on his non verbals.    In summary  if you like Mexican food with a high end flare give this place a try. Note most dishes have a spice to them. The Mexican street corn looked awesome. I was admiring it from another table but did not order it myself. However  unless you like spicy chocolate cake save yourself the  10 bucks or whatever it was.
La Condesa,367,I downloaded the app just to write this review. Let s be honest  I went to the place with a friend after ATX Cocina was closed due to water damage. A lovely older gentleman recommended this place as an alternative and my friend and I went.  The first time we went was nice. They have a good happy hour and guac. However  we had a disgusting homeless man sit next to us  whip out some panties  and try and flirt with my friend. ACTUAL PANTIES. It was extraordinarily uncomfortable. But the rest of the evening was okay.  I figured... Okay that wasn t their fault. So we gave them a second chance. After happy hour with a few friends we get our bill to see that we were charged for ice. Ten dollars FOR ICE. It was marked as a separate line item. We asked the waitress what the charge was for and she said that drinks on the rocks had an extra half pour and that was the charge.  They did not tell us when we ordered that we would be charged extra or that we would be receiving extra alcohol. It was tedious and the staff was condescending. She asked us  oh you ve never seen that before  . No. No  I have not because usually it s in the drink price or we get a normal pour ice or no ice. Also  there is no need to be sassy just politely explain it. Even though there should be no need because the entire concept is absurd. I expect to be charged the price on the menu or I would have ordered it neat. Thanks.  Needless to say after these two experiences I m not going back.
La Condesa,368,Another one of the striking Michael Hsu designed downtown hotspots  we took in La Condensa on one of those gently breezy summer nights we ve been having lots of the past couple of weeks here in town  and the venue does not want for ambiance. It s a genuinely attractive space.  Then too  I can see why folks who have been less generous might be so...there are signs that they re smoothing out wrinkles here  and though the waitress we had couldn t have been nicer  our happy hour era nibbles were decidedly petite  the dessert lover with one of the ceviche dishes while I sampled a couple of tiny chicken tacos . As an extra treat we had our way with a chocolate caramel tort and coconut sorbet  and even with small portions  it was simply too rich to finish.  Worth trying though.  I m sure we ll be back  and hopefully when we can linger...and while we ll hope that the ambiance continues to maintain  I can t help but hope that some of portions might not leave us hungering for seconds...seconds later.
La Condesa,369,Go for happy hour  It would normally be a little out of my price range  but happy hour  only in the bar area  is very reasonable with half off all drinks and an app menu. The nachos were BOMB and big enough to be shared. I got the watermelon-elderflower martini and YUM. Once happy hour ended  we decided to keep ordering and decided on the fish tacos  which were also excellent.  Service was speedy  she made sure to get our order in before happy hour ended   and great. The awesome decor isn t hard on the eyes either. I wish I could decorate my own place half as cool as it looks in there 
La Condesa,370,The food was average for quality  but quantity was incredibly disappointing for the price point. You would expect that for a  tapas  style restaurant they would either have smaller dishes for a decent price to share with friends or that it would be more expensive but actual entree style meals. We ordered the chips and guacamole  the arachera  taquitos  and the pollo con mole. The corn balls that came with the chicken were incredibly hard and dry  the extra tortillas that the waiter recommended were an extra  5 for like barely a couple tortillas which we weren t warned would be extra. The atmosphere is fun but not worth the ridiculous price tag for little quantity of food and poor quality of food. Would not recommend.
La Condesa,371,One more day until Groupon expires.. take two friends to La Condesa for Brunch.   I had been wanting to try them  so when I saw the Groupon  I jumped on it. Brunch seemed like the right time  as they have  2 mimosas and bloody Mary s and serve from a menu  rather than a buffet.   The interior was amazingly cool. Lots of mid-century-modern touches with a cool colorful mural on the main restaurant wall. I loved the spider light in the main restaurant area and the groovy light bulb pvc light fixture in the upstairs bar. I took more photos of the restaurant than the food  and the food was spectacular.   We started with the Cangrejo Tostada which had a succulent chunks of lump crab meat speckled with green mango  citrus  chives and topped with cilantro. For  12 it was a bit pricey  as yo only received 4 on little Tostitos chips  but it was quite yummy.   Then  with 3 of us at the table we ordered. Two of us could not resist the Huevos Chilangos based on the menu description. What a great spin on eggs Benedict. First of all  I have had quinoa - but who knew you could make a quinoa croquette  This perfect little light crunchy croquette was topped with arugula  poached eggs and their house-made wild boar chorizo. The completed this masterpiece with an avocado salsa. So many flavors  so perfectly combined.   My other friend ordered the Cubanita Condesa. This is La Condesa s spin on the Cuban Sandwich. It had black forest ham  roast pork  swiss cheese  habanero mustard  pickled chiles  and arugula on a buttery garlic roll. She shared some of it with us  and it was divine. Love the minced garlic on the bread.   And just when we thought it could not get any better  chocolate  caramel and salt.... we ordered a Tarta de Chocolate Salada to split and I died and went to heaven. It was a rich chocolate caramel tart with grey salt served over honey-popped amaranth and paired with a brown sugar rosemary ice cream. The chocolate richness paired with the salt  caramel and ice cream comprised the perfect bite certain to take your taste buds to another plane of existence  if even for a moment.   The service was friendly  albeit a little slow  as they were slammed with customers.   All in all  this is a great place to get a fresh spin on south of the border flavors.
La Condesa,372,Before I begin with the  what could have been better  portion of my review - I would like to say kudos to La Condesa on atmosphere and service. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing and they were very accommodating as we had to push out our reservation and then ended up coming in late for it.   Service was fantastic  quick  nice  and to the point. I d also like to point out that our waiter looked like a darker Johnny Depp. One can t be mad at that.   My Margarita La Classica was delicious and hit the spot - loved the lemongrass salt rim   Ok so here are my  what could have been done betters.    1  The guacamole portion was teeny tiny and didn t taste fresh. It came in a teacup for  12. Pricing is not the issue as I live in Manhattan  but even there we get better guacamole and more of it for that price. Austin is closer to both California and Mexico. No excuse   2  My Hongos something something Huitlacoche was just ok and teeeeeeeeeny. I ve never seen anything that small for  16.   3  Salad portion sizes were also tiny and just ok.  The Brussels Sprouts were the best part of the meal. Very tasty.   Overall  this meal was just ok. Nothing special. It s a shame because if the food and portion sizes had been better - this would be a great restaurant. A little disappointing.
La Condesa,373,So the aesthetic of the restaurant is really great  The service was also really good. The food was very expensive for the price it was about  80 for two people. We got two of the big dishes and two drinks and some chips and salsa. We were still pretty hungry when we left. I just would say this wasn t the place for us  But great service otherwise 
La Condesa,374,The service and ambience of this restaurant was great  I got the mojito and steak tacos as well as the Mexican corn. GET THE MEXICAN CORN  It was to die for  The mojito was good too. I wasn t a fan of my tacos but I will definitely be back again to try something new as well as get the Mexican corn 
La Condesa,375,The Good       the location. it s downtown and it makes for fun people-watching      they try to use as much locally-produced  humane and organic ingredients as possible. very admirable         lots of indoor and outdoor seating options. get there early and snag seating outside the balcony in the bar section for the best people watching       amazing happy hour deals...drinks are half-off and the dining menu is small yet adequate      the hanger steak. perfectly cooked and seasoned and comes with a delicious side of yucca fries. my favorite dish there hands down. i have been known to eat 2 or 3 on my own.  O      their ceviches. try the hamachi ceviche       the cangrejo tostados....i could eat about 16 of these right about now      their drinks are so good...try the one with tobacco in it. seriously. it is damn fine. the watermelon martinis are extremely refreshing.  The Bad       mojitos could use a litlte work. taste like cleaning products and also too sweet.      parking around here is hard to find      very limited seating in the bar section. get there early and claim your space or else you will be SOL. the happy hour specials only apply to the bar section of the restaurant       it can be a bit pricey if you come here after happy hour      not really a good place for huge groups of people. i am talking anything 10  or bigger.   The Ugly       none  Would I go back  Most certainly...this is one of my favorite happy hour spots to hit and nothing pleases me more than finishing off a rough workweek with delicious edibles and adult beverages.  This place is IN.
La Condesa,376,The hubs and I fell asleep last new year s eve  ringin in 2010 ...  You heard that right.  2 individuals in their mid-twenties fell ASLEEP before it even came close to the proverbial ball dropping.  For this reason  and this reason only  we decided to get an early bird start and make dinner reservations around 5 6PM.  This is sad 2 fold   1.  We thought we d have to make RESERVATIONS for that time. 2.  We were the ONLY people in the dining room for a good 15-20 min  there was a mom amp daughter duo in the cocktail area .  Guess what - We actually liked dining so early   We thought to ourselves   Selves - no wonder older people eat around this time   It rocks    Attentive service   quick food - having to yell in order to hear each other   can t wait until we re part of the Early Bird Special crowd   I wish I remember the name of our server...  He had glasses.  That s all I got.  Whateverhisnameis was very attentive and made excellent drink and menu suggestions.  We had a few  strong   drinks  enjoyed the chips   4 different types of salsa  guacamole w pomegranate seeds  amp  pumpkin seeds  2 appetizers  2 entrees  1 dessert-split and then we were spent.  Drinks consumed  The man - Classic margaritas The lady -  Alma blanca   with habanero-infused siembra azul blanco   amp   El Cubico   volcanic-saffron-infused salt rim anyone      Appetizers   Cangrejo hurache  with lump crab meat and corn custard...  Yes  it was as amazing as it sounds   I really enjoyed the corn tortilla and how the pickled onions cut through the fatty-richness of the crab meat. Something that was on the NYE specials - it involved lobster if I recall.   we liked the cangrejo hurache the best    Entrees  The man -  Costillas de puerco  - spicy guava glazed pork ribs and the hubs  friend  sweet plantains. The lady -  Pato con mole negro  -  just close your eyes and picture this dish  crescent duck breast  confit duck leg covered with a 3-day mole...  Things just got a little steamy in here   Dessert   Tarta de chocolate salada  - dark chocolate tart with dulce de leche  maldon sea salt and brown butter icecream... Heaven on a dish.   Our server didn t rush us so we took our time  watched the sunset through the window as holiday lights twinkled and simply enjoyed good food and QT together - a perfect way for us to spend NYE.
La Condesa,377,The food was good. They charge for ice with your mezcel. Bartender was rude. My drink had lip stick and he rolled he s eyes.
La Condesa,378,Great food. Bad prices. No customer service. Terrible wait and no offer for the inconvenience.  Don t come here. There are better options.
La Condesa,379,This was our last stop before leaving Austin and we were floored at how meh it was.  Salsas were good  but deserved a homemade tortilla chip for a better finish. The mimosas were also good but those are a dime a dozen.    We ordered the cochinita pibil tacos and Cuban sandwich that left us wanting more...as in uninspired  as in blah  as in I m just gonna book a flight to el DF to get a taste of the real Condessa cuz this one just left a bad taste in our mouth.  Rice and beans were good tho  but there was barely enough for a toddlers meal.   The amount of brunching ladies is not  I repeat  is not a sign that the food is good.  Points given for good service  informed staff and atmosphere.  Sit inside for a blah experience without exhaust fumes. Limes seemed to be on strike  they were seriously dry but the habanero was good n spicy-truly transcendental. Then again  that s what you would expect from a habanero.  At this point  we just can t wait to get home and forget about it.  I agree with the previous reviewer that also felt robbed of a good Austin meal  next time we ll just go to a taco truck.
La Condesa,380,The ambience is really good but the food falls a bit short. The queso flamado is brought out on a plate so it hardens up and tastes like cold rubber - would expect a hot skillet at least. The Chicken Mole is very bland. The chicken is dry and not marinated and the mole sauce is average. The ceviche is pretty good.
La Condesa,381,Great service but portions very small for the price.  Example  26 Chicken Mole is a single whole leg  no sides.
La Condesa,382,Amazing taquitos   lil tacos. Tried the NY strip one. Perfectly cooked thin with crispy edges  surrounded corn tortilla heaven.   Enjoyed the mole  fresh salsas and velvety guacamole.   Will be back.
La Condesa,383,I was recently down south visiting the  ladies gone wild city  of Austin  Texas for a bachelorette weekend  no less.  We had a few University of Texas at Austin grads in the group giving us advice about where to go.  La Condesa was brought up many times.  They made a large group reservation for a Saturday night in the summer at least a week in advance.   When we arrived we realized this was a wise decision.  We found that the restaurant was very crowded and since we were a tad early our table was not yet set up.    We gathered in the lobby under a set of glamourous straw thatched lanterns that I wanted for my private collection.  They set a wonderful upscale contemporary  as well as romantic and hip tone.  As we waited they ladies had a mild celebrity sighting of Tucker Max at a table nearby...  we thought this was pretty fitting for a bachelorette weekend.  We were seated just behind a decorative curtain behind the front entrance at a large communal table  which our party entirely filled up.  We ordered two rounds of the Guacamole Flight  as we are all guac-a-holics.  This consisted of a guacamole traditional  a chipotle green apple  amp  crab guacamole and a refreshing watermelon guacamole which no one had ever had before.   My only grievance was the chips  which were not homemade  served cold and seemed almost to be equivalent to bagged Tostitos.  They really brought the delicious guacamole down a notch.  For my drink I was thrilled with my selection of the El Cubico.  They had me at volcanic-saffron-infused salt rim... and and kept me wanting more with the intrigue of the whole leaf tobacco-infused cazadores reposado  vanilla infused brandy  lemon  grilled pineapple juice  and mezcal essence.  Thats right  and it all tasted amazing together  in perfect harmony.  For an entree I went with my ever insatiable craving for great ceviche.  La Condesa has several ceviche options and I chose the Red Snapper with Avocado  amp  Tomato.  It was good but I had to ask for a side of plantain chips to accompany it as the server did not bring it served with anything.  These also were served cold and seemed like they were out of a bag   What s going on here La Condesa  you can t mess up on such little easy things    You are a fine dining establishment...   I will be back for a house made agua fresca  hopefully next time they can bring everything up to speed  service and ambiance is great here.  All and all a fun time out on the town with the ladies  just a few odd pitfalls.
La Condesa,384,Very disappointing. I came to Austin for work  decided to give this place a try. The so-called  Modern Mexican   what a joke. Overpriced  mediocre food and poor service.   I ordered the  overpriced tacos   Pollo Rostizado  waited for 1 2 hour for  tacos  to get them and when I asked to put everything on the side  the waiter said that the  Chef  will not do it so. I was like  you kidding right  The  Chef  will not alter or take anything off the  food   in this case the tacos. I was like  OK. So  I told the waiter  here are your tacos  let me pay for it  and keep them  because they are bad anyways. You probably need the money too. No big deal. Taco Bell has better chicken tacos anyways.
La Condesa,385,La Condesa is the epitome of stylish  upscale Mexican and is oh so delicious. I came for their happy hour and was impressed with their happy hour prices. If it were not for their happy hour prices  I think everything would have been a bit overpriced.  What we got on the happy hour menu    Guacamole Tasting - this was a tasting of all of their salsas  guacs  and it was tasty  Great varied options. Portions of each tasting are small but unique. Loved the one with the chipotle   toasted almond  mmmmmm hungry just thinking about it.   Watermelon-Elderflower Martini - wouldn t usually have a vodka drink at a Mexican restaurant but this one spoke right to my heart  enjoyed the St. Germain and watermelon combo   Alma Blanca - unique flavors that work well together  Love the spice of the habanero and citrus infusion  I have to give this place 3 stars however because there is such minimal happy hour seating that we showed up pretty much when happy hour started and barely got a seat. It is a large restaurant so I feel like they can allocate more seating for happy hour  especially because the rest of the restaurant was basically empty and happy hour seems to be a lot more popular with their patrons. I get that it is downtown but still. The prices just would not be worth it if it were not for happy hour  so unfortunately I don t know if I will be able to make it back here.  Overall great food and drinks  but not worth paying full price for. I would definitely return here again  if I knew I could get a happy hour seat.
La Condesa,386,Lets just say I was skeptical about  high end  Mexican food. Last time I checked  one of the best things about Mexican is the price  quality and deliciousness of it.  Enter La Condesa.   We went on a Thursday night and the joint was packed  bar  dining room  host stand  all the above. We were early  so we got a drink and waited for our table. 2 Titos and sodas that were big fat pours   14. Not bad at all.  We were seated at the time of our reservation and were immediately greeted by our server. He was really great and super knowledgeable about the dinner menu  tequila menu etc. He said they had mandatory tequila meetings every Wednesday. I asked if they were hiring.  I got a classic margarita and it was freaking awesome. Even the salt on the rim that I forgot to tell them not to put on was good.   We ordered half the menu after our server told us it was the best route. We had the guacamole  panza and hongos huarache  carnitas and torcida tacos  dominguro mole  carne asada and grilled corn.  Let me start with this. It was all really  really good. The best thing I had was a tie between the dominguro mole and the grilled corn. The grilled corn was the first thing to hit the table and immediately set the bar for the evening. It was f-ing delicious  take dental floss or get a tooth pick . The chicken in the mole dish was absolutely cooked to perfection  which is no small feat. The mole was awesome too.  If youre feeling adventurous  order the carne torcida. It is the chefs play on a Mexican reuben. Pretty crazy  pretty awesome.  A little nit picky about too much bleu cheese on the panza and the hongos being pretty pedestrian  but when youre paying mucho bucks for things  high expectations are  well  expected.  The pace at which the food comes will remind you of ordering at an everyday Mexican restaurant. It comes fast and keeps on coming. The kitchen sends everything out as its finished  so there is a constant barrage of new  piping hot dishes arriving at the table throughout the course of the meal.   When the check is presented  it comes with little 4 packs of chiclets  just like they always have at everyday Mexican restaurants. A nice touch.  Needless to say  Im a fan and will be back.
La Condesa,387,Very interesting small plates  we just ate botanas  ceviche and taquitos for dinner. Good command of flavor  small portion allows for trying a broad range of things. Recommend the guacamole tasting  tostada de Atun  cochinita pibil. El Cubico and classic margaritas for cocktails. Good list for Mezcal tasting too.
La Condesa,388,Amazing dinner. Shared a bunch of different plates among our party of 4. Started with guacamole and queso flameado - the latter was best I ve had at a restaurant. Then we had the El Califa taquitos with crisp manchego - insanely good - plus the red snapper taquitos. Also had the carrot salad which was a nice veggie add - def wouldn t pass it up. Wrapped up dinner with the boca negra dessert. DO NOT PASS IT UP. Great visit. Cannot wait to come back and try the ceviches. Cool atmosphere.
La Condesa,389,Went to La Condesa for an early dinner on Sunday and had an absolutely wonderful experience. Let me start by saying that I love 2nd Street here in Austin and many of my favorite restaurants reside on the few blocks West of Congress. That being said I have been to La Condesa a handful of times up to this point and have always been thoroughly impressed with their drinks  service  ambiance  and above all their food.   Let me start with our server  Monique. She was knowledgeable of every dish  and even went above and beyond when I asked her a nerdy food question. Her recommendations were on point left and right. From stuffed pequillo pepper chile rellenos to smoked brisket pastrami taquitos  she never steered us wrong. She was also very attentive  helpful  and on top of her game. Her service alone deserved a 5 star review.  I think it goes without saying that I highly recommend dinner here  but this particular meal was exquisite from top to bottom and more than enough food for 4 of us. Here s the list of what we had  all of which I would say are worth the order    - Guacmole sampler - who says no to guac  especially when they put pineapple or lump crab in it  - Trucha ceviche - a nice appetizer for 4 of us  but not a ton of food  won t fill you up but the salmon belly was wonderful and the flavor of the dish as a whole was awesome.  - Veracruzana - I don t love octopus  just the idea grosses me out  but this dish was probably my favorite of the night. The flavor combination and texture discrepancy between the saffron aoli  octopus  and the tostada were flawless.  - Chile Relleno - Quinoa stuffed peppers... what else do you want   - Carne Torcida - Smoked brisket pastrami  I literally could have eaten 100 of them.   I also had two of their house margaritas and the absolute BEST brussel sprouts in Austin. I don t say that lightly and if you ve read down this far please please please do yourself a favor and order yourself these brussel sprouts. I not only ordered one to share  but one to go and ate them the moment I got home.   All in all it was another great La Condesa experience  and this time around it was so good that I needed to tell the world. 5 stars.
La Condesa,390,We had an interesting experience here. We came with a large group for happy hour on a Thursday  and let our server know that we would be paying separately. The service was decent  they were getting crowded so we chalked the wait for drinks up to how busy they were getting.  The happy hour prices were really reasonable  and the drinks tasted great  the Alma Blanca comes highly recommended    especially at  6.00.   Then came the problem. When it came time to pay our bill  we were informed that she couldn t split the checks on the computer. We had to all go around and write down what we had and how much to charge our cards  which with liquor food taxes and gratuity nuances is more difficult to do than you might think. Of course  it didn t all add up and she had to come back to the table and add more on to everyone s check  and because of an entry error on her part we all ended up paying more to cover her error  she charged one card 35.00 when we wrote down 70.00  so somehow we all paid the difference .   Long story short  I paid  21.00 for two drinks priced at  6.00. The whole payment experience itself took over 30 minutes  and by the end I was ready to leave my card there and rappell off the patio to my next destination rather than wait any longer for them to figure it out.  In this day and age  I don t understand how a restaurant does not have a system that is able to split checks or payments  especially one that has such great happy hour potential. I ve put in 6 years of time as a server in the foodservice industry  and it blows my mind that I run into this so often in Austin. It could have just been the server s apathy  but I just don t know how anyone would choose that kind of headache over just using the computer to manage the ordering billing process.  This establishment needs to get with the times 
La Condesa,391,Fantastic happy hour--it s just too bad the area they have set aside for it is so small. It s also unfortunate that everyone in downtown KNOWS this is a killer happy hour spot.  Some very sexy cocktails  again  go during happy hour and they are a steal . I LOVED the El Santo. I am not a big gin drinker but I could drink these for days. Little red number with a blackberry topper  it s almost too sexy to drink. Paired with their chipotle puree and toasted almond guacamole...heaven.   I would say the guac sampler is fun but not really worth it.  It also comes with salsa samplers.  Honestly  the chipotle puree toasted almost one is just the clear winner  but 2nd place goes to the jumbo lump crab  apple  coconut vinegar guacamole. Both are pretty damn delicious and for the price  you re better off doing the bigger serving of just one.  I am also not a coconut person at all but really loved this dish.   Also had really fantastic service both times I went  very personable and friendly people.
La Condesa,392,There was nothing I didn t like about my dinner here.  A friend and I had the almond guac  the salsa sampler  the cauliflower steak  totally original  that one   the Texas redfish tacos  and the mixto  mixed salad .  Everything was wonderful and nothing was too heavy  my chief complaint about Tex-Mex inspired cuisine .  With a couple of drinks and a shared dessert  the total came to around  80 with tip  which seemed more than reasonable.  Apart from the food  the space itself is grand and very attractive  and the service was very friendly and attentive.
La Condesa,393,Potions are terrible.  26 for a plate that serves one person and it s supposed to be shared.  Our host was wonderful. Our waitress  Adriana  was very passive aggressive to our table from the start and other waitstaff that came to our table were very rude.   We were there celebrating a bachelorette party and they made us feel very unwelcome and were very disrespectful.   Food was delicious  drinks were great  will not recommend or return.
La Condesa,394,Now that they have 1 2 price happy hour  you can bet we ll be going a lot more often     The food and drinks here have been exceptional every time we ve been - but it comes at a price.  So far this is our choice for when we decide to splurge on a meal.  It s not cheap - but worth it   The El Cubico is phenomenal 
La Condesa,395,This restaurant shouldn t be categorized under  Mexican . It should be categorized under  SEXY  because everything about it has got so much swag    I love the Sunday brunch 
La Condesa,396,Awful. Awful. Awful customer service. I ordered online a gift card. It never arrived. On the third phone call I finally got a manager who took all the information and never called me back.  This place is pricey  You d think the attention to a customer would not be so abysmal. Don t waste your money.
La Condesa,397,Before arriving in Austin  I read multiple blogs  amp  reviews about local restaurants. La Condesa is named in so many blogger s reviews as a top choice. Very curious  I had to try it myself  so I came for brunch. Tried multiple dishes. Guacamole tasting was delicious  the jumbo lump crab meat  apple  amp  coconut vinegar one was the best. The Veracruzana was amazing  I wanted to lick the dish  I could not get enough of it. Even the hardest critic my extremely picky daughter raved about the traditional guacamole  amp  had 2 orders of the Flautas de Pollo  best she ever had. The signature cocktail  Margarita La Condesa was light  with a fresh fruit taste  the best I ve had in Austin so far. The service was great  amp  the staff was very aware of food allergies. So far the family favorite spot in Austin  Nothing was disappointing well worth the 30 minute wait.
La Condesa,398,Over-priced  over-rated.  18.00 for a salsa sampler     And guess how much a carafe of sangria is   40. Yep.  40 for a carafe of watered-down  no brandy sangria.
La Condesa,399,Typically our favorite restaurant in Austin. Go to for date night  or taking people visiting to get a taste of the best Austin has to offer. Went to dinner there last night and was so thoroughly disappointed. I understand covid may have interrupted their supply chain and they have a paired down menu.. but that is no excuse for poorly made food served in broken chipped bowls  staff who are slow unfriendly and blasting radio pop music so loud you cant hear the person next to you. The Ceviche tasted like a bowl of lime juice with no other flavor  the  fish  did not taste fresh and light as usual and it came with nothing to eat it with like normal chips  tortillas etc. Chips and Guac are overpriced  they basically served us mashed unseasoned avocado and what tasted like a chunky frito lays chip. The quesadilla was a tasteless thick mush with nothing special to offer. We were so dissatisfied with those three very simple items that we didn t even continue to order and left. It almost feels as if there is new management or a different chef because this experience is so far below the expectations this place has set for us in previous dinners. I hope they can return to their post covid levels of food and service.
La Condesa,400,I ate here based on Yelp recommendations and it exceeded my expectations. I was a little wary based on some of the reviews but the food  service and atmosphere were beyond my expectations.   Drinks were not your typical Mexican restaurant flavor.  ie strawberry margarita  but passion fruit spicy mango Margarita  different indeed. Food  We ordered a bunch of different things  including Queso Flameado  which you had to build the Taquitos. This was spicy hot though good if you like a cheese. Cangrejo  crab mango tosadas. Mmmmm really good. Probably could have just ordered a few of those.   Service  Excellent. We were there on a Saturday night and our server brought his A game. One member of our party has food allergies and he carefully took the order and followed up with the kitchen. He was around but not overbearing.  The servings aren t really large but its what I would expect for  tapas  sized dishes. This place isn t for the budget conscious but well worth a visit.
La Condesa,401,Some of the blandest nachos I ve ever had  Queso Mixto . Also  what s up with serving salsa selections in small  metal condiment dishes. How am I supposed to dip my large  triangular-shaped tortilla chips in those  And  the drinks-- while the bartender was very nice  the drinks she made  blame it on their drink recipes  were too sweet and very weak. I had high hopes for this place--it s a cool  classy space  and I ve read some positive reviews about their food. However  I was very disappointed with just about all aspects of my dining experience last night. The only cool thing about the experience was that the waitress looked like the girl from Jurassic Park  so we teased her about it.
La Condesa,402,At some point there is only so much sunflower seeds and kale you can add to Mexican food before it is unrecognizable.   The chips are clearly out of a bag  the rest of the food is terrible  small portioned and overpriced.  Most disappointing meal of 2017  an insult to tastebuds and a felony against your wallet.   Please close down this waste of real estate.
La Condesa,403,Looking for a place in downtown Austin to grab a bite for dinner  I stumble across La Condesa. I couldn t get a seat in the dining room so I opted to sit in the bar area.  Sitting at one of the bar stools  it looked like a casual place where groups can mingle  drink  and eat. The bartender offered up a menu for me and since i was a newbie here I asked her what she recommended to eat. It was the Pato Con Mole Negro   26  consisting of a Crescent duck breast  amp  confit leg  three-day abuelita mole  toasted sesame seeds  rice  crema  and grilled green beans.  The duck breast and leg were moist and tender with the deep  rich  smoky blanket of abuelita mole. It was a hearty dish that definitely satisfied my hunger. I wish I could have had another plate to eat. The rice was a bit overcooked but overall it was a successful dish.  It was a pleasant  quick meal and if I m looking for elevated  upscale Mexican food  I ll be sure to come back here.
La Condesa,404,Ah  my favorite. Great food  great service  great atmosphere. While there s nothing on the menu I don t recommend  be sure to get the guacamole tasting -- it s a guac flight with 4 different types of guacamole and 4 different house-made salsas. The small tacos are also high on my list. Boca Negra is probably my favorite dessert.   The cocktails  Oh my  the cocktails. I m fantasizing about the El Cubico right. In fact  I just made plans to meet a friend for cocktails after work tomorrow. Mmmm.
La Condesa,405,I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and it was OK. For the appetizer we ordered the Guacamole Tasting which was a variety of 4 different guacamole s and chips. I really liked the seasonal recipe which was guacamole with strawberries on top  but it wasn t anything special. The other guacs were kinda weird for my liking-but my boyfriend liked them. For my entree I decided to go with the shrimp cocktail which was pretty good  but I don t think you can really mess up a shrimp cocktail. Lastly for dessert we got the Boca Negra and it was probably the worst flour-less chocolate cake I ve ever had. I m usually a huge fan of flour-less cakes but this one just seemed like they tried really hard to make a different and add too many different flavors. It was a bit spicy because it contained chipotle  but it also had caramel and a weird tasting banana. The dessert was definitely not worth the price. The service was also not the best. They weren t too busy but I felt like our waiter barely paid attention to us. Overall I m glad I tried this over-hyped upscale  Mexican  restaurant but I will definitely NOT be back.
La Condesa,406,Good but not great. For a  25 entree I would expect free chips and salsa. Lupes or Ninfas or La Hacienda... you have my Tex Mex dollars any day 
La Condesa,407,Great patio  GREAT cocktails  great service. I m not going to give it 4 stars just because I didn t have good there....I m assuming the food is great too. When I go back  I m going to get one of the ceviche choices. The location is great and the restaurant vibe is super cool on the inside. They have an upstairs patio for private events  and downstairs patio for people watching  a mid-level bar  and a downstairs main dining area. I wish we had something like this in Nashville.
La Condesa,408,A 4-stanza haiku to La Condesa   Good food  stellar drinks The desserts are amazing But the fun ends there  Being in downtown Does not mean you re in New York Why New York prices   The service was not Commensurate with what the Food and drinks cost us  One thing to learn in Waitering 101 is Bus the damn table
La Condesa,409,BOOOOOOOOOOO   I was really looking forward to finally trying this place after hearing and reading so many positive reviews... boy was I disappointed   We had a reservation for a Tuesday night... and still had to wait 15-20mins to get seated. Nevermind another 15 mins to get our drinks and order. When the food finally came out  it definitely was not worth the wait   I ordered the beef short rib - which I will say the meat quality was good  and cooked well  in fact fork tender. But they weren t kidding when the description said rib  as in one . The size of the rib is about the size of the new iphone 5  with the BONE IN. It comes with plantains  which they let me substitute for rice and beans... those were good  but who can f-up rice and beans   My husband ordered the pork ribs  which came out over sauced and COLD. It was basically 3 pork ribs with congealed dr. pepper tasting sauce. GROSS. We sent it back it was that bad. When we got the second order  it was better  but WAY too sweet   Our waitress felt bad and sent along some house made sorbets. The mango one was way too tart  but the cookies and cream one was pretty amazing. All in all  if I m paying  32 for a meal  I would expect more than one rib  and for  36 bucks  I would hope that the food would at least be hot.  Overall  it wasn t horrible  but I probably will not be coming here on my own dime any time soon...
La Condesa,410,My boyfriend and my favorite thing to do is go to a restaurant and try a bunch of different things and share them all. This is a perfect place to do that. We walked by and saw they had a few ceviche options and opted to give it a try. I had been here years ago but did not remember the food.... Probably because of trying out their array of different drinks that day. Not your classic Austin  Mexican martini  place  but they have a huge tequila selection. We just did a margarita and some Mexican beer.   With regards to service... Fantastic  though our server seemed frazzled with a large table nearby. She did send out an extra taquito plate that was one of our favorite things    For food the ceviche we got was not traditional but tasted so good  and still like ceviche. The taquitos were yummy  and the yellowfin tuna was our favorite flavored dish. If you like desserts we ordered the coffee cheesecake... So original and YUM 
La Condesa,411,This review is for brunch.  We d been hearing about La Condesa from many people and figured we d be foolish not to try it on our first trip to Austin. We went in for brunch as it wasn t too crowded and we got seated right away.   The food was very good. As a vegetarian  there were about 2 or 3 options available for me which is not too many. I ordered the eggs with grilled tomato and toast which was very delicious. They had a very good deal on mimosas which my partner said were pretty good.   Was it worth the hype  Maybe. I get the feeling La Condesa takes the most pride in their dinners but we still had an enjoyable brunch at a decent price.   They play good music.
La Condesa,412,This is probably my favorite restaurant in Austin. Everything is amazing  and if you re gluten-free or Celiac  the staff is incredible and the food is to die for. Especially the boca negra. To. Die. For.
La Condesa,413,Fig infused bourbon.  Yummmmm...   Ok  have eaten here several times now and tonight we just went for drinks. Not quite as crazy as the concoctions that the guys at P ch  sling  but still very  very good.    The highlight though still has to be the design of the restaurant itself.  Great food and flavor does come from the diviest of eateries  but the vibe in a place really can make or break an evening.  If you are looking for a good meal  great drinks and a place with a high  cool  quotient then La Condesa is the spot. Act fast through because my bet it that this place is going to get a little crazy once the W opens next door later this fall.
La Condesa,414,The drinks are delicious.  1 star.  Having to convince our waiter that my food order never came. -3 stars.  I ordered something fancy  the Tu tano   roasted bone marrow  smoked bacon  poblanos  charred tomato  parsley  radish  marrow totopos    one of the more expensive things on the menu.  The waiter gave us an extensive lecture on how La Condesa is a tapas restaurant  without using the word  tapas   he must have thought he was playing Taboo with us . Turns out it isn t really  anyway  but the food came out incrementally  mostly brought by other servers   runners.  Around the time everyone else finished what they ordered  I despaired of receiving my dish  but was already pretty full on chips and guacamole. So I caught the server and told him that I just wanted him to know my dish had never arrived  but I was already full anyway  so just to make sure it didn t show up on the check. He stared at the table in disbelief  and said something like  What  Oh  I m sure I saw it on your table.  And then he began to peer around the people sitting at the table  as if one of us was hiding it on the chair beside them. Haha no  good sir  you ve barely glanced at our table in the last hour or so  much less asked us how our food was. Then he said he would go check on something inside  we were sitting outside .  Another person in my party picked up the check at the end of the meal  and it would have been rude to verify whether the plate was indeed taken off  but I did catch a peek of the total   130. For four people ordering three dishes and a couple of drinks  I m inclined to estimate that the plate wasn t taken off the bill  but I could be wrong .  Either way  La Condesa  trying to argue with your customers when you screw up isn t cool.  Go for the drinks. Then leave.
La Condesa,415,I ate here last night with a guest from Dallas.  The food was good  and pretty   but the servings are tiny.  If it weren t for lots of chips and salsa I d have gone home hungry.  I first ordered the Chochoyotes  but they were out of that  so i switched to the Hamachi cerviche.  It was really tasty  but tiny.  My companion had Huarache De Hongos Y Huitlacoche which was really good  she gave me a bite  and it was a bit more substantial.  Part of my problem was not understanding the menu  so I didn t know what was meal-sized and what were essentially tastes of something.  The prices gave no clue to the quantity of each dish. It was my fault that I didn t ask the waiter more questions  but I don t like dinner to be that complicated where I have to ask what the listed ingredients are. Do you know that  huitlacoche  is a fungus that grows on corn   I do now  and it tastes wonderful.  The house margaritas were great  and the multiple staff members who came to our table for different reasons were polite and friendly.  I d have no problem coming back here for drinks and chips  amp  salsa  but for a real meal this mid-western farm boy would be much happier at Lambert s across the street  which had a very long waiting list when we tried to go there first .
La Condesa,416,My sister and I go there today for lunch after a morning of bad circumstances. My sister ordered a chicken sandwich. After eating half of a half she realized the meat looked odd and thought maybe they accidentally put ham instead.  Turned out it was raw chicken  We notified the server who got the manager. They apologized and offered another bring another meal. She declined and said she had lost her appetite. We asked the waiter to check us out and to my shock the only thing they did was remove the meal my sister didn t eat  Seriously  I was shocked. I would have expected a high end facility to have better customer service then that   I told the manager as we were leaving that I was shocked and all he did was so he was sorry....even comping a drink or a part of the bill would have been appreciated  Ironically when we were in the apt elevator talking about it a man chimed in his last experiences were poor and he wasn t going back.    I ll give 1 star as the specialty drinks are very tasty.   So disappointed. And more poor sister hasn t felt good rest of day and has to drive back to San Antonio feeling nauseous.
La Condesa,417,Let me preface this by saying that I ve been here about six times and this was the worst experience to date.  Our waiter has a lot to do with the poor rating as he was  well  kind of bitchy.  He took my mom s wine order and the wine was brought by someone else and he brought the wrong thing.  He said that the wine she ordered wasn t available by the glass.  He then returned with two glasses of things  close  to what she wanted and she picked one and a third guy brought that out to her.    Our waiter returns and says that they do in fact have it  but that the second guy  just didn t know that we ran out this morning   Ok  didn t You know that they ran out  and if so  why did you let her order it  and who runs out of wine in the morning    Ok  so that s where his little  tude started to show.  We ordered  and I was expecting a bowl of chips with those delicious house made salsas  it never arrives.  So  I ask him after we ve been there for about twenty minutes and I get a snippy   We re making some fresh  and he walks away.  We ordered their standard guac  which was great  still no salsas.  He told me that is  something different  and they don t just bring those to the table.  Maybe things have changed  but every other time I ve been there it does.  I tried the pork ribs and they were a 6  the chile relleno was really nice  and the carnitas taquitos were good too.  The service just kind of sucked this time around.   And  could someone tell me  do they not bring the salsas to the table any more   
La Condesa,418,Went with coworkers and ordered several things  - GUACAMOLE TASTING -- The watermelon guac was the best  but they were all great  - HUARACHE DE PANZA DE PUERCO - Looked great  and everyone said it was good  large portion  but I don t eat pork. - TOSTADAS DE CANGREJO - pretty good  but they were basically 3 small chips with the crab and dressings. - MOLE DOMINGUERO - had bacon fat  but I will say it was a large portion as well  and it was more red than brown if that helps to know what the mole might taste like. - CHILE RELLENO - delish  the quinoa was so well flavored  almost like pesto. - CARNE ASADA - I don t eat beef either  but everyone loved it  - PULPO - this was by far the best choice  the octopus was dense  but not chewy and  had a wonderful smoky savory flavor similar to beef.
La Condesa,419,When I heard the words  High-End Mexican Restaurant  I almost laughed out loud. Then I ate there. I no longer laugh at those words anymore  instead I salute them every time I see them.   For appetizers we had Pomegranate Guacamole. Sounds weird  until you taste it. Then it s like  WOW ALL THESE FLAVAH IN MY MOUF ARE CRAZY.  No lie. I don t remember what exactly was in it  but you can sorta get a taste if you mix some pomegranate and avocado together. It won t be perfect but it ll do in a pinch.  The other appetizer I had was  Elotes   Mexican style street corn. It had some interesting crumbled cheese covering it which gave it tremendous flavour. Thumbs Up.  Next up we have Manzana y cabrales  which is canela-roasted apples  green apple habanero salsa  seared pork belly  queso cabrales  and arugula. Man  the queso cabrales was waaaaaay too strong for me  but the rest of the dish was good.  Cochinta Pibil  which is seville-orange marinated pork  cabbage  and pickled red onions. Too acidic for my liking  still pretty good.  For desert we had Plantanos- sweet plantains  salsa verde  and queso fresco. Uber interesting sweet and salty mix flavor  def jazzed up my tongue.   Mind you  all of these were ordered during the happy hour  so it was so much cheaper than regular price. Def stop by this joint if you are in austin  cuz it s WORTH IT.
La Condesa,420,Amazing food  At first it seemed a lil pricey for the portions  but that s not hard coming from a poor college student - the portions ended up being just perfect  especially with an appetizer  Desserts were out of this world and the service was great.
La Condesa,421,Best Brussels Sprouts in town   Great outdoor atmosphere. Good for a date night. Ordered the Pollo Rizando tacquito which delicious. However  I was disappointed with the portion size. The salsas were good but the chips were a bit stale. One my friends ordered the deer meat which was delicious too.
La Condesa,422,We had a business dinner based on the recommendation of our local hosts. The ambience  service  drinks  and food were outstanding  After quite a bit of discussion among the group on sharing plates  our waiter stepped in and asked about food preferences and took charge of providing a selection of dishes.   Everything from the guacamole starter to the assortment of desserts was delicious. The Elotes and ceviche were the best I have eaten since my last trip to Mexico.  I recommend the large group experience - you get to try most everything on the menu 
La Condesa,423,I planned a conference dinner at La Condesa about two months before we would all be in Austin. We had 13 people and when you have over 12 you have to go with the family style price fix menu. The woman I worked with over email  Cheryl  was very nice and pretty quick to respond.  When we got there for our dinner reservation they were running thirty minutes late. Thirty minutes when I have 13 hungry conferences goers and for a reservation I booked two months ago was definitely not the greatest start of the night.   When I booked our reservation I notified them that one person in our party was a vegan and two were dairy-free. They were 100  accommodating to the guest who was Vegan but  not so much for the dairy free people and  A LOT of the dishes had cheese. Our server was very friendly and helpful  he was able to make some last minute accommodations.  The highlights of the meal for me were definitely the Watermelon Elderflower-Martini  in my opinion St. Germain is the most under appreciated delicious liquor out there  and the Elotes  Mexican Style Street Corn . I can t even tell you how many recipes I ve pinned trying to recreate that delicious cheesy corn. The crispy grouper was pretty good as well.  Oooooo  I almost forgot the Ensalada De La Casa was awesome  I don t mind salads but they are usually not something I would really rave about and this simple salad was really delicious.   Everything else we ate was still pretty good but did not bring me to the level of replication obsession I am currently at with the Elotes and that martini.
La Condesa,424,Modern Mexican food     The guacamole sampler was a good choice. The server even brought more chips to let us finish the abundance of guac.
La Condesa,425,Pretty disappointing and mediocre overall. If you re in town for a short time  definitely skip this one. We regretted wasting a dinner here. The good  high-energy atmosphere  cool looking space  good guacamole tasting. The bad  lack of communication between multiple hosts  poor service  very weak margaritas  and ehh food that is overpriced. Our group had the chicken mole  barely eaten   pork belly  and taquitos and another forgettable item I can t recall. Menu is pretty limited. There are so many amazing restaurants in Austin  don t waste time at this place.
La Condesa,426,I ll admit   sometimes I get a waiter  or two  that are big jerks.  And I ve had a non-crispy carnitas taco before.  That s why i took off a star.  However  tipping a bit less for the attitude and asking nicely for a better taco does not take away from the goodness of this place.   Ceviche. Yum.  I m a bit obsessed with the ceviche.   They have changed their offerings and made them a bit more fancy   but I still love all of them. Salsa guacamole sampler thing.  Double Yum.  I love the seasonal watermelon and queso fresca guacamole and sunflower guac.    And who doesnt like drinking water from cute small glasses and awesome architecture       The wait is usually crazy.  We always spend more than we should  probably bc my ceviche addiction - but I never leave disappointed.
La Condesa,427,I planned a special dinner for some out-of-town guests and spent days researching the best place. Enter  La Condesa. We arrived at 8 45pm on a Thursday  and didn t have to wait  we were immediately sat outside by a friendly hostess. I was stoked because I was expecting a long wait since it was such an acclaimed establishment.   We waited for a server  for a decent amount of time  nothing to get worked up about though. We saw him so infrequently that I ended up grabbing other waiters that walked by  to ask questions about the menu. At one point there was a group of three waitstaff talking to each other outside  while one girl loaded up a tray. I asked the girl if they served anything similar to an enchilada The girl  didn t even turn her head to answer my question  and said  no . Wait for it  wait for it..... she then turns her back completely to me  and laughs.   Luckily  there was a super helpful waiter there that did indulge us briefly  and stopped to answer questions about the menu. Which  is to be expected when the menu is compartmentalized into meaningful categories of  dough  and  strong plates . You know  as  authentic  Mexican restaurants tend to do.  But  it s trendy  and it s delivered with derision. Business model- nailed it. No need for questions.  We eventually get a selection of salsa s  and chips  for  18 . A very shallow and meager bowl of chips is emptied and we ask for more. They never show up. Ever.   Later  we ask for another beer. It never shows up. Ever. Anyway  food is mediocre  portions are small and service is awful.
La Condesa,428,A tad hipster for me however the service was good and the food was interesting.  They had a selection of ceviche and ours was good.  The fish tacos were good and the side of guac was very good.  I always love when I can get plantains and they delivered these fried.  Also an interesting and tasty selection of deserts are to be had.
La Condesa,429,First impression--BLUE STAIRS  The inside of this place is so pretty  And my second stop after sitting down was the bathroom...since pretty places all have pretty bathrooms    La Condesa is not an exception. YAY  PRETTY BATHROOMS.  Definitely on the pricey side  but the food is good. Wouldn t be able to come here for dinner on my little student budget.  18 guava glazed pork ribs were delicious. Meat literally falling off the bones. A little on the salty side though. And  12 for 3 little pieces of lump crab on crackers  So good  but so...expensive. Sigh   My complaints  Posole was way too salty. Not sure if the food was worth the money. Not great service  he forgot to take one of our orders and brought us the wrong check at the end   but I ll give him grace since he said he was a newbie.  Tip  Make reservations.
La Condesa,430,Overrated  crowded  just okay. The staff was no where to be found when something was needed  water glasses always empty  will not return here.
La Condesa,431,Been once and absolutely horrible in getting food out in a timely manner. We waited for 45-50 minutes  for tacos... Food wasn t anything special either. Disappointed.
La Condesa,432,Our bill was  98 for brunch for 4 meals  two appetizers cheese and guacamole   3 soft drinks  horchata. The told us they would charge us  6 for 5 tiny blue corn tortillas. I will be okay to pay that if the food was outstanding but cmon for tacos and a torta. It was beyond outrageous. My tacos hardly had any meat. Location was fun and service was great. The value of the food compared to the quality of food were two worlds apart. I will go back to Taco Deli  Frescas or Torchy s.
La Condesa,433,Yum  Came for dinner by recommendation and not disappointed. Steak  salsa and fish and wine and queso fundido and potatoes... happy tummys and a lovely glass of wine. Perfect after a long conference day.
La Condesa,434,The hubby and I returned to give this another shot since we had a Groupon.  I found the little bites delicious  especially the queso taco.  This was a delicious bowl of hot  melted cheese that the hubby and I could not stop mmmmmming over.  We also ordered the mushroom tostada.  It was good and reminiscent of a mushroom pizza.  The taco with the beans in it is tasty.  The fish tacos were okay  but too heavy on the cabbage and not enough on flavor.  We have had 2 entrees here and both were nothing to rave about.  The chile releno was a pass as was the sunday dinner.  Nothing was wrong with them  but they were on the level that I can cook at home.  People allegedly love their chips and salsa.  We do not agree.  The chips are way too thick and the salsas were not yummy.  The platanos are served in an interesting style and worth trying.  This is a great date night.  Stick with the front page of the menu and all will go well.  The service is fantastic and the setting quite lovely.
La Condesa,435,Visited this restaurant with a couple of friends as we were all in town on business in June and it came highly recommended by many.   Overall  not bad  however  we weren t that impressed and it didn t live up to our high hopes.  The food was actually quite good  we ordered chile rellano  grilled cauliflower  and carnitas . The lower rating comes from the portion size and price.  For example  the chile rellano was approximately  18  there were four small chiles  it was a vegetarian dish  and while it was quite tasty  it was much more like an appetizer.  We also ordered the guacamole and chips   12 .  The service was also lacking a bit  not very attentive to beverages  water  speed - and at the end of the night I think it took over 20 minutes to finalize our checks and payment.  Anyway  if I return to the area  I probably won t be headed back to La Condesa and try somewhere else new...
La Condesa,436,Really enjoyed this restaurant   Tuna Poke Bowl was INCREDIBLE   Corn  As a side  was also delicious    We didn t get drinks.
La Condesa,437,Walked in with a group of 10  the hostess was sweet. As we were having cocktails in the bar area she kept us posted on wait times for our table. We were sat within 20 minutes. Waitress was was fantastic. All around this places gets 10 s all around.
La Condesa,438,Drinks were good but a 2 hour wait for a table is ridiculous   drink here just don t eat here
La Condesa,439,Very good food and the La Condessa margarita is so good.  Probably the best margarita I ve ever had.  It s made with pineapple juice and rimmed with a lemon grass salt.  We had the salsa sampler along with the street corn in a cup off the cob and the salmon ceviche.  All of it was very good
La Condesa,440,It s mom s weekend for our UT senior daughter and we had brunch at La Condesa.  It was our first visit  we ate inside on this April Saturday.  We started with classic guac--which was very  very tasty.  The brunch menu had several options that I wanted to order.  Our table had Huevos Rancheros with a side of chorizo  Huevos Condesa and Chilangos.  The combination of the Quinoa with the chorizo on the Chilangos was masterful.   We loved the roasted poblanos in the Huevos Condesa.  We also ordered a side of street corn.  Each of the dishes was well prepared  creative and very delicious.  The service was well done.  Now I m interested in coming back for dinner to get the brussel sprouts and chicken mole.  This is a great spot.  Will definitely be back   Oh and I should address the portion size several others commented on.  Each of the three of us ate brunch and there was so much food  we were all stuffed   I don t eat a lot but I couldn t finish my huevos condesa  even after giving a portion to my daughter and husband.
La Condesa,441,The bar at La Condesa has such a wide array of mezcal  amp  tequila and definitely one of my picks for best happy hours in austin    Half price drinks  amp  delicious food menu  
La Condesa,442,the drinks are soooo good - esp. the smoky one.  Love the appetizers and small plates.  They could have a few more big plates on menu
La Condesa,443,Everything was absolutely delicious  from the cocktail Alma Blanca  to the fabulous salsa sampler with guacamole. I couldn t even decide which salsa was the best  The star for me was the ceviche... both the Acapulco and Hamachi were fabulous   Also had the octopus which was cooked to perfection but I wasn t expecting a tomato sauce so not my favorite but still yummy.  The service was also fantastic.  I would definitely recommend this place if you like a finely crafted cocktail and are craving some delicious ceviche and salsa   
La Condesa,444,Stopped by for a visit on a Sunday evening.  It wasn t too crowded and was seated after about 10 minutes.  Food was interesting.  Didn t feel like there were many vegan or vegetarian options  but finally settled on the gucamole sampler and then the Zanahoria salad.  The salas was probably priced right at  14.    See the description below.    Burrata  epazote-grilled carrot  ash-roasted beet  johnson s backyard garden bitter greens  basil  mint  habanero-carrot pur e  The guac sampler was nice as it included four different kinds of salsas.  I was unimpressed with the guac as I can make better at home.  But the experience was nice.
La Condesa,445,Very fun spot to hit with a friend  fun atmosphere  and great drinks. We had a fantastic waitress as well who was extremely knowledgeable regarding the menu. The guac with crab and Fiji apple was unreal  one of the best I ve ever had. Other highlights included the chicken mole and Mexican street corn. The only reason this isn t 5 stars is because the tacos were subpar and overpriced. We had the chicken and the steak tacos - both of which were underwhelming. Dessert was worth sticking around for  so order an extra cocktail and order the chocolate cake with Chile de Arbol.
La Condesa,446,My partner and I walked in on a Saturday afternoon without reservations. The hostess told us it would be a thirty minute wait or open seating in the bar. Because the full menu was available in the bar  and there were bar seats and one table for two  we picked the bar.   On the weekends  they serve their brunch menu between eleven to three. We started with the  2 mimosas. Partner got the huevos rancheros and I got the tacos del d a with Texas redfish. The portion sizes were moderate not excessive. My fish tacos had plenty of cabbage  chunks of grilled fish  and weren t greasy at all. They came with Mexican rice and black beans. I also swiped a bit of the guacamole from the table next to us because they left 1 2 cup behind  I thought it was fine  as in  tasted like how I make it at home. Overall  food was fine. It wasn t amazing  but it wasn t terrible either.   Service was good. Accepts credit cards. Moderately-priced because it is in downtown after all. Very upscale atmosphere with stylish design. I had the seen the mixed reviews for the place on Yelp  but was glad we checked it out. We were looking for something within walking distance of our downtown hotel.
La Condesa,447,Stopped by prior to a show at ACL.  Got 2 cocktails and 3 small  tapas  style dishes.  The food was fine but underwhelming.  I found La Condesa to be over intellectualized  uninspired  and a very poor value for money.  If this was smack dab in Manhattan I d still be a little irked by the price to value.  Would it return nor would I recommend.
La Condesa,448,This is a lovely  upscale tex-mex restaurant in the heart of Austin. I loved the delicious carnitas and chicken  taqueria  which are better described as  tacos  in soft corn tortilla shell. The outside patio seating was lovely at night at the end of May.  Service was fine  but a bit slow as it was a busy holiday weekend.
La Condesa,449,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE   Had to ask for a larger table to fit 12 when we had a table for 8... the waiter asked us to squeeze... with 3 pregnant women. Food was great but TINY portions. Do not bring your Texas sizes appetites here  the waiter told us that an entree would feed multiple people... then ordered multiple orders of food for the table... when we wanted to order separate meals for each person.Then had to call the manager to take care of it  he said we will take it into consideration. Fixed the errors but did not go above and beyond.. I would never come back even for the good food. Service is important to me  sad since all the reviews being good got us here.
La Condesa,450,Been two years since I was there last...  It s still hoppin and great people watching  but the food is still always a little off.  Mushroom tacos where the mushrooms are still tough.  Chile relleno stuffed with quinoa etc  but it was ridiculously too spicy  and I love    spicy.  Still  I d go back and see how some other dishes are....  It s a happening modern neighborhood which is great as a visitor to Austin.
La Condesa,451,Heard that you have to make a reservation in order to dine here so make that reservation before walking in and finding out that they can t seat you.   What I didn t like about it was how dark it was. It was hard to read the menu  and to make it worse each time the server recommended us something on the menu  we had to really search for it using the candlelight as our only guide.   Here s the downlow  Service was fantastic. Our waiter was so knowledgeable about the history of the place  its roots  the foods  and even recommended us what to try.  Under taquitos  try  -el califa which is seared ribeye  crispy manchego  cilantro  oak-grilled jalape o-tomato salsa. We were able to get 3 tacos.   Under Platos Furtes  -Chile relleno which is quinoa-stuffed poblano pepper  butternut squash  chives manchego cheese  tomato broth  salsa pepita  tortillas - Came with tortillas and it fed enough for 3 of us to share with all the other plates we ordered   If anything  make sure to try the Elotes - mexican street style corn. This was so good  I didnt even taste the mayo  just fried goodness. Yum.   -coles de bruselas which are brussel sprouts  bacon  grapes - GET IT  The flavors especially with the bacon is a delight to your tastebuds.
La Condesa,452,This restaurant had a great atmosphere accompanied with amazing service that make the whole experience phenomenal. Oh not to mention  the food was equally great. With large portions to put you into a food coma  this restaurant will impress you further with its amazing array of craft cocktails. 10 10 would recommend
La Condesa,453,Why doesn t this place have a higher rating   Austin style trendy with huge seating capacity.  The sharing  eat as it comes out method is really fun for communal experience.  Every single dish was great - the tacos  every kind  stand out  and so does the cauliflower
La Condesa,454,What an awesome restaurant. Let me preface my review by saying that I was completely spoiled during my visit because I was with someone who works there  but everything was amazing. The staff were all very friendly and helpful explaining dishes and making recommendations.   I would recommend starting with the guacamole sampler. You get four different styles of guacamole with unique ingredients. My favorite one had toasted walnuts and a chipotle pur e.   The street corn and Brussels sprouts were both fantastic side dishes. The yellowtail ceviche was not a traditional ceviche but it was great and had a nice kick of spice. I also tried the carnitas tacos which were delicious too. The only item I didn t really enjoy was the veggie flatbread  huarache de hongos y huitlacoche  it wasn t bad per se  just not as great as everything else.    For dessert I recommend the cafe con leche - a delicious coffee caramel pot de creme with tiny cookies made in house. Very tasty.   We sat inside because it was really windy but I would like to come back and enjoy happy hour on their patio sometime. Great place 
La Condesa,455,It was literally just OK. I came in for a couple of drinks and a bite to eat and I got exactly that. The bar area was a  seat yourself  situation...I waited so long for a menu that I actually had to flag down a busser to bring me one. I then waited again for the server to stop by and take my drink food order. I then waited a very long time for my food.  So basically  my experience here was a lot of waiting. I didn t see that it was extraordinarily busy but I think the server was the only in that section. That aside  I still expect to be acknowledged greeted when I sit down and checked on every so often.  I gave them 3 stars because the chips and salsa and 2 tacos I ordered were pretty good. And the service wasn t bad  per se  just very slow.  I would probably try them again but they wouldn t be my first choice.
La Condesa,456,Much-hyped restaurant which we went to 2x on our recent trip to Austin. We had lunch and dinner there on 2 different days.   Lunch  - Smoked Pork Ribs- delicious  smoky and tender - Guacamole tasting- the lump crab guacamole was my fave - Pisco Sour- pretty strong  Dinner  - Scallop ceviche  well-marinated and tasty - Lamb  smoky and delicious  i wasn t quite expecting it to be done this way  but it was good  Overall  i thought La Condesa was great  but i definitely don t think it s the  best  Mexican restaurant i ve ever been to. Worth a visit  i thought the restaurant was better for lunch than dinner
La Condesa,457,I haven t written a yelp review in a while  but I felt compelled to in order to warn others. I went during happy hour and the drinks were great.  Hence the 1 star  My friend got some sort of tobacco infused drink that was great. Drinks are half off  placing most in the 6-6.50 range. Totally worth it for the drinks. The food was a different story. We ordered two tostadas and got smallish tortilla chips. Literally  tortilla chip-sized  tostadas . I then ordered a sope that was similarly sized.  And despite having my favorite thing in the world huitlacoche  bland.  The 8 dollar happy hour guac was also too small. The ingredients did not justify the price. What if I went to a restaurant and ordered a burger  and a slider came out  People would lose their damned minds. Is it ok because it s barely passable Mexican food  It s a shame that it is named after one of my favorite neighborhoods in Mexico City  a place I associate with excellent food  drinks  and scenery. Only eat here if you have had some sort of gastric bypass surgery or you are a hamster.  In which case  congrats on learning how to read 
La Condesa,458,Seems like they listened to the reviews about under-spiced and inattentive but not in a good way. We started with the tostada de atun. Our server said   Oh  it s a large tortilla  you can all split it.  It came to the table...it s a 4  tostada and we each got...one...bite. One bite. For  14   And it was so salty that it was hard to taste the tuna. Actually  everything was way over salted.  See under-spiced reference  Next  two of us ordered the fish tacos  two to a plate  that s it no sides   13 bucks apiece. One of us ordered the  chile rellenos . These things resemble chile rellenos like tofu resembles a steak. Four TINY little peppers stuffed with QUINOA  Um  what  Last person ordered the cochinita pibil. Sigh. Again  SO salty. And weirdly sweet I guess from using orange instead of bitter orange which is more like lemon. And then the  habanero escabeche . Why is this even served   I love really hot  spicy food but wherever those deadly habaneros even touched the pork  it was almost painful to eat. Now to the inattentive part. Our waitress came back so many times to ask if we were ready to order that we started to think we were taking up her only table. It was weird. Go away  let us look at the menu for a minute   Our bill was over  200.00 and only one margarita  two teas  one of us drank water. As the other reviewer said  in a city full of great Mexican restaurants with reasonable prices AND serving sizes  La Condesa is something to pass up.
La Condesa,459,My husband and I really enjoy authentic Mexican - but we appreciate the talented Chefs of La Condesa which are without a doubt impressive ten fold. We have been to three of the SFC  Spring Bounty Fall Harvest   events held at La Condesa which are unique  important to community and culinary joys as well. Anyone that can participate should.   The Happy Hour menu can be seen on-line and offers individual portions to get a grasp of the flavor combinations of many items. Every item was unique in preparation and flare. The drink has many signature and classic options as well as a full bar and beer selection. They have half a page dedicated to the tequila selection   Ample seating is able to outside or inside and our waitresses have always been friendly as we are and knowledgeable  The decor and vibe is the perfect combination of simple and fancy. We have often brought friends and colleges here and the experience is quality each time.   The shopping in the 2ND Street District amidst La Condesa have a lot to offer.
La Condesa,460,Sweet little place located in the heart of Austin near the W.  Stopped in for dinner  and sat at the bar.  Immediately was greeted and served.  Excellent house margarita with pineapple.  Very good.  Also  some of the best guacamole I have had.  I decided to branch out and order the one with lump crab  with came with sliced green apples  which in no universe sounds appetizing  but was delicious.  No  really.    I also opted for the fish tacos  which came two to a plate.  Rice or Beans were extra.  They were excellent  seasoned perfectly  with a double flour mini tortilla.  Great atmosphere  good patio  and nice people watching.
La Condesa,461,So disappointing.... Went here because we had heard such great things about it.   I got the carne asada..... And it was so fatty  it was terrible. Sent it back and got a second one  same thing.   Atmosphere was great. However  I would not return.
La Condesa,462,We left because we were never greeted. Plus   19 for cauliflower     Rude and pretentious  Go down the street to No 28 pizzeria and vineria  It is awesome.
La Condesa,463,Surprised at how awful the meal was here last night. Have been here countless times throughout the past 3 years and have experienced dependably good meals and service.   The execution of the food last night was terrible. Everything was over salted  over seasoned  over cooked - like  send it back to the kitchen  bad. The server also fed us some crap about  everything on the menu is made to share  - which it isn t - in a lame and obvious attempt to jack up ticket prices. Oh and she also never actually took my order. place was also pretty empty for saturday night - word travels fast.  Maybe it s loss of key personnel  new management    whatever the case  stay the hell away until the trend of bad reviews changes.   there are way better options in austin.
La Condesa,464,Not much here appealed to me in both food and atmosphere. Service was pretty good. I ve always heard how well designed the inside is  but I didn t see anything all that special. it does look nice from the outside.
La Condesa,465,I ordered beef tongue and tried my friend s chicken. I think for what you get and what you pay  it is not worth it.  I honestly had to ask my boyfriend what I ordered here because I didn t remember the experience. But he reminded me that I had the beef tongue. I had beef tongue earlier that day somewhere else and it did not compare. Their beef tongue was extremely salty. My friend s chicken was surprisingly very dry.  I wouldn t come here again.
La Condesa,466,Taco bell will a better resturant any time compared to this resturant.  For  250 bill without any drinks  you could visit taco bell multiple times and enjoy it every time.  Corn on cob was likely the worst corn you will have in your life.  Cassidia   can be better made looking at u tube  by a 10 yr old than here. The salsa dip for which they charged  5  spoiled our taste for a long time.  Flower tortillas were ordered by my grandson. He eats almost everything  but not this one.  We were all extremely surprised   how this resturant has managed to stay open for so long.  I am not so much concerned about the money spent and taste spoiled   but more for otherwise a beautiful evening spoiled.
La Condesa,467,Preface to this review  went here with my boyfriend. We re both 28 and as lame as it sounds  we came to Austin to experience the  weird  side of things we d heard so much about. - If you re looking for a cute  authentic mexican restaurant  don t come here. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I didn t do enough research and ended up here on our first night in Austin.    In terms of atmosphere and food drink operations  it really wasn t more than a small Cheesecake Factory with a Mexican makeover. There was nothing cool  interesting  or special about it. It s the type of place that would be good for a big group dinner  just because it s a big room  or maybe for dinner drinks with co-workers. That being said  the food was totally good  not amazing  but really no complaints.
La Condesa,468,Food was pretty good  way over priced. We came in with a group of 8  we asked for separate checks and the waitress messed them up. I understand that happens but instead of offering to fix it or jumping in to help she told us  I ll let y all figure it out.  Service was ok  but after messing up the checks and not offering to help I won t be returning. Also restrooms were disgusting for a place as  upscale  as this place was  we told someone and they didn t fix it. We returned an hour later to see if they were usable...they weren t.
La Condesa,469,I brought my mom and sister here when they were visiting Austin for the first time. We immediately noticed the  red snapper  tacos on the menu  and as avid fish taco fanatics  we all ordered the same thing. Even though the portion was a little small  we absolutely LOVED the red snapper tacos   Seriously amazing. Wait staff was very attentive as well  I was very impressed with La Condesa  it s now one of my go-to dinner spots.
La Condesa,470,I was looking forward to eating here  the decor is very cool and the food was good. The drinks and service we received  however  were subpar.   It started with the hostess giving us attitude for not having a reservation and needing to wait for our whole party to arrive. We sat in the outside waiting area  which was cool - but when the hostess came to get us  she brought us over to the table area and had us wait for an additional 5 minutes while she prepared our table  instead of letting us keep sitting until our table was actually ready.   Our waiter just had an heir of superiority about him. And when I asked  why   after he told me he wasn t sure he could serve me a virgin Bloody Mary  I received a  go to hell  look and no answer.   Granted the bloody mary s were  2  but they were more smoky than spicy  which totally isn t my thing. My brother was also really disappointed with his margarita.   I also didn t appreciate having to sit on a rusty chair in my white jeans...  Overall the food was impressive but the service would probably keep me from returning.
La Condesa,471,La Condesa is a mixed bag for me. The decor is trendy without being overly so. The bar area is nice and the bartenders were knowledgeable  amp  attentive. Our hostess forgot about us so we had to check in with her twice to actually get seated. Our server was fine - just okay service but they were busy so I felt for her.  My biggest issue is the food. Nothing was great. And some things were down right bland. We did the guacamole with salsa sampler and only enjoyed one of the salsas. The guacamole was tasty. Every dish and side we got was just okay. We left feeling disappointed because we spent so much money and didn t enjoy the meal all that much.
La Condesa,472,Really very disappointed. Took my cousin from Los Angeles there along with her best friend from New York and it was a complete let down. The restaurant was too warm  the wait staff was inattentive  arrogant and all around bad and the food was just okay.  For example  I asked what our waiter would recommend and he arrogantly commented  well maybe something from the left side of the menu and then the right  like a taco or something . It was a joke. Truly a let down considering how many other places we could have dined instead. Don t go
La Condesa,473,My wife and I will drive from 20 miles out simply just to taste happy hour at La Condesa. This place can be pricey if attended for a meal but happy hour is a steal    Half priced drinks  best margaritas in Austin  and a long list of appetizers that are fun to share. We always get the skillet of nachos  street corn and this time we tried a lump crab and apple guacamole. It starts at 5pm. If you aren t there by 4 45 it will be standing room only  so get ready to fight for a table....I don t like standing while trying to juggle appetizers  this is the only reason I give it 4 stars.
La Condesa,474,I ordered the Califa taquitos  not impressed. Besides the food taking a while to come out  when it was served it was Luke warm. Meat was tough. We had a party of 7 that was seated outside  it was after a earlier rain and water was dripping on those of us sitting on the long bench  they warned us about it   but the original seating arrangement had us sitting in a line  it s a  party  of 7. French press coffee was good  Service was normal. Unfortunately I will not be back to dine  but maybe for a late coffee next time I m in ATX.
La Condesa,475,Thought I had written this review  but I was wrong. Wanted to share my HORRIBLE lunch experience   We had sat down for President s Day lunch  wasn t to much of a crowd. But after we sat it began to start. So we got our order in for appetizers and lunch  plus drinks.   Drinks slowly came  I had asked the waitresses for NO SALT on my margarita. So was little surprised it came with it  instead of sending it back. I only asked for a straw  which NEVER CAME  But our appetizer came out on time.  Pretty much a long period passed before we ever saw our waitresses again  my drink had melted by then. And we had already flagged down the manager to see what the hold up was with our food.  Seeing that a 6-top table who was sat after us was already getting their food  what the heck were a 4-top.  Finally after complaining to the manager our food finally arrived  and I was over my drink.  Would I recommend coming here again  HELL NO. Would I suggest it  F-NO...
La Condesa,476,The highlight of my evening here was the chips and different salsa  seeing Chelsea Clinton  and the corn and cheese side.  The service was professional and attentive.   My entire order was a dud. The grilled octopus was way too salty and they dessert of pot de creme was way too sweet.   This was bookmarked on Yelp but I had the feeling was a place to be seen  overhyped and overrated.  I finally visited  not by my choice  and left really disappointed because I haven t ever really had a bad meal in Austin over the past four years visiting during South by Southwest.   I would skip this one unless you like to drink and a fan of chips and salsa.  They do have a great happy hour and great for people watching.  Keep in mind that this is not a traditional Mexican restaurant  but more of the gourmet fusion sort you would imagine to find in the big city such as Mexico City or New York City.
La Condesa,477,A cool  trendy artsy spot with delicious food and good drinks.
La Condesa,478,There are not too many great Mexican spots in NYC but La Esquina definitely stands out. With 4 different options  walk up window  diner  sit down and brasserie  there s something for every occasion.   Getting reservations at the Brasserie is tough. You ll be on hold forever but it s worth it.
La Condesa,479,Now this is the story all about how I went on the most awkward first date of my life.   It started off innocently enough - the guy had a list of restaurants in Austin he wanted to try that he found on a blog. La Condesa happened to be on that list. The plan was to come here for lunch and then go to the farmer s market nearby. Excellent  That s basically where the good things ended. It s straight up awkward city from here.   We arrived at La Condesa a little before they opened  which was fine  but home dude seemed to be super anxious. Maybe he has the first date jitters  Since we were some of the first people to arrive  we only had to wait about five minutes for a table.  First of all  the restaurant itself is gorgeous. The decorations  all the window space that lets in so much wonderful sunlight - it s beautiful. I was impressed already and we hadn t eaten a thing.   He gets coffee and I get water. When the coffee arrives  he spills some of it. I notice this because I do not like people who are messy eaters. It really  really bothers me. He also then gets out his camera because he wants to take pictures of everything. As he s standing to capture that perfect coffee cup photo  he is in the way of servers and waitresses. I m already embarrassed.   We did the guacamole tasting  which comes with six different kinds of guacamole and four different salsas. Some of them were good  but none of them that remarkable.  And it s  18 for 6 small bowls of guacamole and four tiny serving cups of salsa  Yikes.  Messy eater strike two as he is spilling bits of guacamole and salsa on the table - how hard is it to just wait for everything to drip into the bowl so you don t make a mess  Patience is a virtue    I ordered the BLAT  which is a BLT sandwich with avocado. While we wait for our food  the conversation is strained and uncomfortable. I get along with damn near everyone and I m very personable - conversations are not difficult for me  but it was clear that I had almost nothing in common with this guy and that he seriously lacked any sort of social skills.   I have to give credit to our waitress because she had the patience of a saint. We exchanged a few glances as she waited to set things down on the table as the king of awkward stood and took pictures  oblivious to his surroundings.   The food arrives and my sandwich is crazy greasy. Every time I pick it up to take a bite  I have to wipe my hands because they are covered in grease. Bleh. Whatever - it s better than having to pretend to enjoy our conversation. At least now I can busy myself with eating. Messy eater strike three for him - do I even need to explain this one   We finish eating and he gets another coffee. Fuck me  I don t know how much longer I can hold out and we still have to go to the farmer s market. I am literally aching from second hand embarrassment. I might die in my seat. I am beginning to wish apparition was real because I would rather be anywhere than in front of this guy.   At least he s nice enough to pick up the bill  because I know the meal was expensive. Overall  though  I was just unsatisfied with the whole experience. I couldn t lose myself in the food because it just wasn t that amazing and I was really hoping it could salvage the date. It wasn t bad  but I just don t think the prices were justified for what I received. Everybody s gotta pay those bills  though  and I know that space on 2nd street can t be cheap. The design of the restaurant can t carry the place  though - if the food was as good as the ambiance  this would have been five stars  no questions asked.   Oh  well. Lesson learned.
La Condesa,480,Came for street corn- they don t have it for brunch. Everyone seemed either high or hated their life. The food was terrible. I ate mcdonalds afterwards. Eat at your own risk.
La Condesa,481,I remember when La Condesa was great. Sadly  I m afraid that time has past. Drinks were good but that was it. But hey at least we had poor service and walked away with a enormous bill.
La Condesa,482,Fantastic food and plating  great atmosphere  accommodating to gluten free  awesome margarita la condesa  great prices for very high quality food. Would definitely come back  
La Condesa,483,Brunch  but did not get drinks. Host had super tight pants  but super billowy shirt. People spying on us from the stairs  and I made awkward eye contact.  I love the atmosphere. Textural concrete walls. Giant light fixture. Colorful mural. Half-level bar. Perhaps my favorite restaurant interior.  Food can be described as clean. Tex-Mex without the heavy dose of cheese and spice and saltiness. My redfish tacos were super flavorful  along with the lemon rice with bits of corn and the black beans. Like sunshine in my mouth. Get the chips and salsa. Four types of salsa  and they are all delicious  if lacking any spiciness.  Also  hipster-framed waitress complimented my hipster-framed friend. Gotta get in on that. Next time  I ll wear my glasses.
La Condesa,484,The food was good  over priced tacos. The service was terrible and I was really surprised we had to pay for chips and salsa. I would not go back.
La Condesa,485,Great location and atmosphere. Sat outside on the corner of Guadalupe and 2nd St.   Steak taco was amazing  the cheese was like  side cheese   crispy and awesome. I added Guac which was delicious.  Minus one star for mediocre tortilla chips and an indecipherable menu  but don t let that stop u  I recommend 
La Condesa,486,Very good   The service I really liked the service of the hostesses. They were friendly  gave us all our options  and helped us get a table quicker than we expected. The waiter was not bad  but could be better. More frequent water refills  and letting us know the types of Margaritas they had  etc. would make the service even better  But overall  not bad.  The food I really enjoyed the taste of the food. There was a good variety on the menu. The portions weren t huge  but they also weren t small. I also liked that octopus was an option on the menu  It was really good.  The price A bit on the pricey side  but it s what you d expect from a modern  fancy downtown restaurant.
La Condesa,487,This place had nice ambience and the interior decoration was great. It was inviting and the menus were trendy looking. Though all of this was true  the food ended up being lackluster. I felt that almost all the dishes we received need salt and pepper. In addition  though we are partially responsible for the confusion  the waitress repeatedly got out order wrong. One of the people I was with didn t even know what she was eating. She ordered the Huevos Rancheros and coincidentally so did another table and hers did not look anything like the other table s. Overall  I felt the food was overpriced for the amount and taste of food.
La Condesa,488,Amazing margaritas and food  4 stars for charging me for chips and salsa. Other than that it s a great place to eat  Walking distance from downtown and to other spots to grab a drink 
La Condesa,489,I was so disappointed with my experience at La Condesa for lunch this past week. So many parts of it added up to an overall lack luster visit.   It was my first time to La Condesa. I ve heard great things so I was excited   Service was not too friendly. He was unable to do flour tortillas in place of corn because they have flour tortillas only for this one dish they serve at dinner... ok  So I order veggie tacos that have beans and spinach and are served with rice and black beans. The two ladies I m with both order the same salad  each with a few changes.   One lady I m with orders a coke and it comes with no ice. Both of their salads were wrong  even though the server wrote down their orders and individual requests. My tacos came with kale instead of spinach - fine  I ll eat kale but ask if you need to make substitutions  The taco filling overall was very salty. The rice and beans were good. Not worth the prices.   Our first server disappeared and another brought our check. A few moments later our original server returned to let us know that someone would bring us our check... ok. Clearly there s a lack of communication and organization here.  I wanted to like it so badly and I m still willing to give it another try. The sample of salsas that come with the chips and salsa are super delicious  Their drinks look good too...
La Condesa,490,I m a fan for their happy hour.  Their normal prices are off-putting for what you get.  I love their ceviche choices  very different and nice.  Their guacamole is also nice  especially the sampler plate.  The drinks steal the show  as this place has a plethora of good solid drinks.  Go for apps and drinks during happy hour and sit on their patio area.
La Condesa,491,I came here Friday for lunch with some friends and loved it - not sure why the reviews are so low  I ordered the chicken tacos and was really happy with them. They make homemade wheat tortillas  I believe they made them  and the chicken is a bit shredded and includes an avocado salsa and super good jasmine rice and black beans on the side. My husband ordered the fish tacos and loved them as well. So juicy and fresh. The frozen margaritas were also very good and thick and icy  not super watered down like some spots. The only reason I didn t give five stars is because the drinks took forever. Very cute ambiance and will be back for sure.
La Condesa,492,Again  here I am in Austin  exhausted after a full day of work and meetings. La Condesa made me happy.  Think of this  cool and hip place. Awesome location. Great service  great Mexican food. It s La Condesa.  It s not your every-day-Mexican-kinda-food. It s tasteful and well figured out food. Like... mixing the right stuff together and coming up with a cool and unexpected kind of dish.   Totally a keeper.
La Condesa,493,I loved the food and the atmosphere -- with a few caveats. Certainly  this is in a trendy little part of town and  when you re one of the  old Austinites   it s a little jarring to be eating a  20 lunch across the street from where Liberty Lunch used to be. But  time moves on  right  So  if you can swallow the trendy factor -- and how this is a place where ladies go to lunch together -- then there are parts of this to be savored.  Three of us went there for brunch today  on the Groupon mentioned elsewhere in the reviews. Each of us enjoyed our entrees and loved our desserts. And I may be have been a convert completely  excepting the service.  We had a server who was slow on everything -- in fact  it started out like this  we were seated at our table  and he eventually came by. And what did he say   Can I start you off...oh  wait...let me just check in on this table over here first.  And so he tended to the table next to us for a while.  Each course was slow in coming out. Getting our server s attention for refills on water  tea  or chips was next to impossible  he was very good at looking like he was scanning the room  but keeping his eyes about 4 feet above the actual table . If we hadn t been enjoying the visit we were having  then his inattention would have been annoying for sure.  I m not sure this is good or bad  but other tables didn t seem to suffer from bad service. So  hopefully they are cultivating a level of service that matches their food preparation. With our experience  however  I m not so sure I would be eager to go back.
La Condesa,494,Came here for lunch with my sister and country-song-writer-turned-food-blogger brother-in-law  wrote  Looking for Atlantis  and a bunch of others .  It was his reco and the cat knows his eats.  Central Mexican cuisine is one of his favorites...Mine too.  We opened with Hongos y huitlacoche  an apetizer that combines wild mushrooms  farmer s cheese  queso fresco   and truffle oil on a thick tortilla.  I m underdecribing it.   This was one fabulous appetizer.  I had the Cemitas de Puerco  a torta featuring a small slab of pork belly  bleu cheese  apple  arugula and a couple of other ingredients I m forgetting.  It reminded me a little of the pork buns at Momofuku in Manhattan.  I wrapped it up with a double-shot of espresso.  Also excellent  combined with a homemade gingerbread man.  do they serve these other than at Christmastime I wonder      I d like to return for dinner  where I can start with cocktails in their inviting upstairs bar area.  The patio looked like a good spot also for a Spring or Fall outside meal.
La Condesa,495,A friend of a friend s brother owns this place and I was dying to try it. I had   Ceviche scallops  amp  Queso Fundido Tacos My buddies got the Horchada and had cardamom in it      So great. They also hadd the Short ribs which fell right off the bone and was incredible. The flight of guacamole  while pricey  was delicious and creative.  Overall  the food was INCREDIBLE.  Start to finish. The staff was AMAZING -- kind  thorough  helpful with suggestions.  I hear they re opening a branch in LA.  This place was great.  I didn t give it 5 stars b c I am unclear as to the decor branding of the place.  The menus was chintzy TGIF type menus but the food is expensive.  Same with the tables chairs.  It just didn t add up and wasn t overt enough to be ironic.  Regardless  EAT HERE.  It s the best.
La Condesa,496,The ambiance was nice but a little overpriced for my taste. The salsa trio and elotes were delicious. The tacos were unique and tasty. Would recommend 
La Condesa,497,Over priced food for the small servings you get. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Service was mediocre.
La Condesa,498,La Condesa is perfect for a special occasion dinner or nice date.  Initially I had made reservations on Open Table for a party of 6 on a Saturday night and I had no problems getting that changed to 8 people by calling a few hours prior to our reservation time.  The interior is absolutely gorgeous with the rich wood decor  ambient lighting  and large mural in the center of the dining room.  The food was beautifully done as fine dining twist on traditional Mexican cuisine.    Items ordered  - 2 kinds of cerviche - Guiso de hongos y epazote which was 2 royal trumpet mushroom tacos - 2 orders of the quinoa-stuffed chile rellenos with butternut squash  manchego cheese  and tomato broth on a bed of salsa pepita - Carne asada oak-grilled ribeye - Pollo dominguero that consisted of a citrus-rubbed half roasted chicken and a side of potato-poblano gratin - A salty and sweet dessert of dark chocolate tart with sea salt  rosemary-brown butter ice cream  and honey-popped amaranth  - The crema cocida vanilla bean panna cotta with pickled watermelon rind  pepitas  and agave  The price is well worth it for the quality of food  portion size  exotic ingredients  ambiance  and service.  It also helped that we had a  20 Groupon.  I would glad return without one.
La Condesa,499,This is a great place for happy hour    Best drinks in town for my money  My girlfriends  and I love it.  The wait staff is friendly  if a bit busy  but I ve always had a good experience.  The  happy hour  does not extend to the tables  only the bar  which is a drag.  Sitting outside is great people watching  and has a nice vibe   I usually stick to the appetizers  which are good 
La Condesa,500,My favorite place for drinks and incredible original dishes  every bite is magical. The flavors are playful  complex  unexpected  and delightful. I love the way the chef plays with traditional mexican dishes to make them innovative and exciting. I can t say enough  I greatly miss eating here since I moved from ATX and have been meaning to try their location in Napa. Don t miss it 
Azul Tequila,1,We had a yummy lunch here on Oct 1. My wife liked her chicken enchilada mole dish and Aunt Bella loved her hearty chicken tortilla soup. Good marg they shared also. Now u lnow how pick i am about really good Mexican food. Marcelo recommended the pork chile relleno and it was delish. Creamy sauce with sliced almonds. Very tasty so will b back for more of that rather large menu. Disfrute 
Azul Tequila,2,I haven t seen anyone else address the sewer odor that overwhelms you as you walk into this place    Appetite destroying. Great for dieters.  Love the complementary live music and good margaritas. But with no way of getting to the patio without entering the restaurant makes it highly unlikely we will ever be back Until this sewer problem gets addressed. Used to be a bi-weekly affair. Proximity to home was a big plus  Thanks and feel free to update me on any changes. Would be appreciated 
Azul Tequila,3,Came here with some friends on a Friday evening - we were seated fairly quickly and I was impressed by the overall set up  the patio was quite nice. Even though it was a really hot evening the outdoor area was well-shaded  only thing I wish is that more of the fans were operational.  The service was friendly but it was clear they were slammed by the weekend crowd. It took probably half an hour to get drinks on the table and then another half hour before we were able to place our orders  they apologized for the kitchen being backed up . Seems like they may be suffering from staffing shortages.  The free salsa was quite nice  the queso we ordered not so much. I ordered the mole poblano entree. There was ample sauce and the flavor of the mole was quite good  but the chicken was slightly overcooked  the beans lacked flavor  and the rice was bone dry.  Overall  I thought the meal was OK for the price but don t know if I would come back - from the time we sat to the time we were able to get the check it was close two and a half hours and I m not sure the food quite delivered after the wait.
Azul Tequila,4,This is a fun spot to dine with friends and pup alike   There is indoor casual dining and a fabulous patio out back with a little stage for live music.  Children are welcome.  The salsa and chips are fresh and the large selection of intriguing Mexican food focuses on the interior.
Azul Tequila,5,Azul Tequila used to be a rare treasure for Austin.  It is just as good as it ever was  a totally lovely place.  However  the competition has upped its game.         Azul Tequila was once one of the few Tex-Mex places that also served Interior Cuisine.  It also served  what the cook feels like dishes  with some degree of originality.  Fifteen years ago  that kind of place was hard to find.  Now there are all sorts of innovative Mexican cooks around ...  And you can find interior cuisine both in brick and mortar places and in food trucks.         But the execution at Azul Tequila is just fine.  And they are perfectly reasonable on Tex-Mex and Americanized Mexican too.  The cook will break rules if the rule breaking leads to improvements.  A recent meal involved a taco salad ... with no taco shell.  It was a steak taco salad with tortillas on the side of the bowl.  I didn t miss the taco shell one bit.         Bartending is standard.  They basically do normal invented-elsewhere drinks ...  But the execution is completely adequate.  I drank Salty Dogs all afternoon  and had zero to complain about.  Zero.         If there is anything to complain about with Azul Tequila North    It is the building.  The ventilation in the main dining room is less than ideal.  The dining room is stuffy and funky.  But they have an outdoor garden -  And outdoor gardens have unlimited fresh air.  If it gets too cold  they have a Texas-sized heater to keep you nice and roasty-toasty even in all that fresh air.         Are there distinctive super-stellar Mexican restaurants in Austin with unique dishes or styles you can t eat anywhere else   Yes.  They get the five star reviews.  But you are unlikely to be unhappy eating at Azul Tequila.  Good kitchen.  Good menu.  Good bar.  You can do a lot worse.
Azul Tequila,6,Great spot for a late afternoon or early evening drink in North Austin.  Outdoor  shaded seating comfy even in late June   Excellent service with vegetarian and gluten free options.  Very good cocktails  too 
Azul Tequila,7,Fairly average Mexican food here. I got the steak which was sizzling attractively  though the meat was pretty sinewy and not even close to the requested doneness. The veggies  onions green peppers  were quite salty and oily. I really loved the fried  very oily  plantains though   For the price  it was pretty much as expected.
Azul Tequila,8,We have been to Azul any number of times over the last year.  We enjoyed takeout and margs to go during Covid and are happy they are back open for dine in.  They have indoor and outdoor seating options and are bigger than they look from the outside.    Servers are friendly and quick to refill drinks and chips.  Food is solid.  We are fans of the nachos  ceviche  and fish fajitas.    Are there fancier places   yep.  Are there cheaper places   Of course.  But if you want great all around local food give them a shot.
Azul Tequila,9,I ve been here twice and the food was good and the attention even better. I found out there is a patio behind the kitchen where bands play music on weekends.
Azul Tequila,10,The smell as you walk in is that of a public bathroom. My family and I had to turn around a leave.
Azul Tequila,11,Great place  food  drinks  no transparancy...   We had a birthday party at this location. Our party was around 30 people. We called in advance to make sure there would be no inconvienence for a big group coming and sitting in the back patio area. Everything went great for our party. Good timely service and orders fulfilled accurately   but when we recieved the check  there was an added  300 for a catering fee. The staff explained what it was for and we understand  but this is something we would have loved to know about before hand. There was no warning or heads up in the previous converstations.
Azul Tequila,12,Azul Tequila is an undiscovered jewel in this neighborhood. Lots of outdoor space with live music at 7 00pm on Saturdays. Highly recommend the mole dishes  enchiladas and chicken breast . It does have a good variety of Mexican food  such as cabrito  that you can t find elsewhere.   Margaritas are great  but I would recommend a frozen margarita  as opposed to the  on the rocks   with a Grand Marnier floater  which easily fills two people    Marcial was an awesome waiter 
Azul Tequila,13,I was surprised at how flavorful the food was  to the point my friend and I kept talking about it. We ordered the queso  and both had the enchiladas salado. The enchiladas were seasoned to perfection with the right amount of cheese to sauce ratio. Both the rice and charro beans were great too.   Now for my issues - they skimp on portion sizes  and that s so not cool. I can tell by my plate   but most disappointing was my friend s plate.. She asked for no beans and double rice  they simply just gave her a single serving and called it a day.   They also were very unorganized. It seemed as though out of the people working  only a few were actually handling things. Our waitress was so nice  but it was obvious that she was being overworked. We had to sit and wait several times to get someone s attention.  Not a deal breaker  but definitely hope they get more staff.   Overall  I would be back for the Salado.
Azul Tequila,14,Another past favorite place but wow what has happened  Quality of food and service has gone down. So sad  many good margaritas and delicious variety Mexican dishes have been consumed there but not so much anymore. I hope things get better. Sending positive vibes.
Azul Tequila,15,Our group of friends still enjoys having early dinners at this location   and the staff are very nice to us  but there are two things of concern.  One  as someone else mentioned  there s a bad smell as soon as you walk in.  It smells of sewage  and it s been this way for a long time  only worse lately .  Two  starting a few weeks ago  the volume for the music has been turned up to the point where we cannot have conversations while we dine.  The volume has been consistently ear piercing.  Both of these things need to be resolved.  But please don t change the food or nice staff.
Azul Tequila,16,Menu is consistently very good to great. Not fancy and solid value for the price. My local go to for interior Mexican food.
Azul Tequila,17,After searching menus and restaurants in Austin with no luck  the Azul Tequila chef made me two shrimp flautas even though they aren t on the menu. They were excellent  My server was very knowledgeable and personable  her name is Xcaret. I highly recommend this restaurant.
Azul Tequila,18,I was more than disappointed with the food. Small portion  nothing special at all. Some of the most bland enchiladas I ve had. They also charged me 8  for chips and salsa  if I would have known that I would have got queso.
Azul Tequila,19,Love the mole enchiladas.  Tasty salsa.  Great patio to bring your dog to also. Ample parking
Azul Tequila,20,Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Anywhere else. The food truck on the corner is better than this place. The staff is RUDE. The food is over priced and nothing special. The drinks are terrible and also over priced. Bad. Just bad. Both thumbs down.
Azul Tequila,21,I love the food here. The attention to detail is delicious. The margaritas are strong. I highly recommend the Frida. The staff is awesome. Manager is happy to make things right and always does a table check. Love this place 
Azul Tequila,22,The food is okay. Not a wow factor but their prices are for sure a WOW.  A taco salad and a margarita to go was  30. I asked for an extra salsa and they were going to charge me for an order of chips and salsa. I will not be returning for over priced average food.  They add a 20  gratuity in addition which I would have no problem paying for but I do feel they nickel and dime you. We re all hurting during this pandemic. Doesn t make the pricing gauge right.
Azul Tequila,23,My friend and I decided to try this place out Friday night around 7. It was pretty busy but not that bad  they had a life band which was great. We sat inside which is literally inches away from the band  since there wasn t a stage. So it was very loud most of the time we were there. But the band was very entertaining.   Their complimentary chips and salsa is so good  Which is always a plus in my book. I ordered the frozen avocado margarita which was insanely good. I highly recommend you try that drink at least once. My friends ordered a margarita which was also good.   We both had the chicken enchiladas mine had queso on top of it and his had the mole sauce on it. Both were very tasty and hot  Which is always a good thing. The server was super nice and did give us her suggestions on what to get  which is great. The one thing that sucks there is the parking. They have a super tiny parking lot and if you don t find a spot there  you have to park on the street. Which can be very frustrating if it s busy in the area But definitely would recommend this place. Perfect spot for happy hour or just to go there and enjoy a meal.
Azul Tequila,24,Sax guy was a real five  but service was a bit below average again and kind of annoying that a number of menu items were not available. So upping my review to three.
Azul Tequila,25,Thanks for always offering excellent service when we pick up food To Go during COVID   Your staff is always so friendly and helpful.   The food is always delicious.     We look forward to sitting out in your lovely courtyard when the weather gets cooler.  Thanks for being our favorite neighborhood restaurant Azul s.
Azul Tequila,26,Came here for popin lunch on a random Saturday and the staff was super friendly and helpful.  TJ our waiter and the rest of the staff all were very attentive.  My wife and I ordered some bloody Mary s  queso  ceviche  quesadillas and enchiladas Del Mar.  The portions were bountiful and the flavors were amazing.  Everything was delicious and we left totally full and content.  Can t wait to go back and try more off of their menu.
Azul Tequila,27,Coldest frown margarita I ve ever had  Food is simple but they season everything so well it s amazing.   Secret outside area in the back which is so peaceful 
Azul Tequila,28,Great food in this tucked away spot. I would have never found the spot due to cielo bistro being closed for lunch on a Saturday.  The timing wasn t peak...staff is a little on the slow side  seating is limited  enchiladas with borracho beans was good and drinks were on point- you don t realize how quickly they add up at that price point.
Azul Tequila,29,I m tired of having to go back to get food that we ordered  but was not in the food that we took home  and then they have the gall to charge us 20  gratuity for crummy customer service  We loved the band  and were thinking about going back for breakfast  but we will not be doing that Poor customer service is very hard to over come...
Azul Tequila,30,I love this place and their outdoor seating. Really great spicy margaritas  Only downside is they don t have any kind of happy hour.
Azul Tequila,31,Worst mexican food i ve had in austin. food was bland  dry  and the drinks are ridiculously expensive for how average they are. The service was even worse  we asked for sauce because everything was so fuckin dry and we waited 29.3 minutes for sauce and when they brought the sauce tasted like zebra piss. they charged us  4 for that suck sauce. place blows. Don t spend your hard earned money at this place.
Azul Tequila,32,The Lady and I took a taxi to Azul  smart  and proceeded to start drinking the first of what turned out to be 14 Margaritas  not smart . We ordered some food to help soak up the booze. I had the Cabrito al Maguey  which is South central Mexican style barbacoa  goat meat marinated with chile guajillo and spices slow cooked on maguey leaves. Served with salsa verde  Mexican rice and charro beans. It was quite good and even better when I put on some extra hot sauce. The Lady had a Chicken Breast with Mole sauce  which I tried and it was also quite good. Wonderful patio and live music   The wait staff for our table where we were was good. Food and drinks arrived quickly as we ordered early and because of the crowd  ordered drinks at half-way of the original.  The bill was correct as we kept a careful count with marks and the waitress saw us make each mark. This is a little trick we learned in Europe.  I was happy. Not a single bug bite  even though we sat outside after almost a week of rain. This is unusual for me as I am really sought out by mosquitoes for some reason.
Azul Tequila,33,We were at Azul Tequila s   Dry Creek location   tonight and I am SO grateful for the 3 servers who were assigned to the outside patio and their service to our table. On the other hand  the owner double booked the bands and did not seem to take responsibility for his poor communication about it so the band chose to continue to play but was denied water in 95 degree heat. It isn t surprising that there seems to be  a high  turnover of servers working for this man.  I would have thought the owner manager would have been more prepared in a post pandemic season and certainly more appreciative of the business the band brought in.   We will not be customers any longer.
Azul Tequila,34,Always friendly  awesome Mole dishes    Love this place. Everyone is welcoming and friendly. Service is fast  short wait time for everything.
Azul Tequila,35,Definately not a recommend. Sadly Azul has gone from being relatively good value  taste and friendly  to totally avoid. Tonight we dropped by for some Margaritas and they were sugary and bland. Worse  the service was inconsistent and at times rude. I think what got us the most is that the Marg s were so overpriced   18 each    Save your money  time and tastebuds and go to Maudies or El Dorado. Half the price and  way more than  twice as good.
Azul Tequila,36,It has been 4 years since my original review and an update is definitely in order. Since the previous entry  I have gone vegetarian and I find there to be a very decent selection for me at Azul. The chile relleno is a great option. As well  the tostadas are refreshing. At times I will ask for a small portion of the spinach mushroom filling to be added and they are happy  do so. Of course  one can always go with the enchiladas alamo  cheese or spinach inside . My partner still loves the cochinita pibil  by the way.  More notable than the food has been the improvement coming from the bar area. Miguel has taken the lead and there are some delicious and innovative drinks coming from him. I am pretty open an often let him make something fun - which does not disappoint. Ask for something with mezcal....  Service is always nice  they all seem to really enjoy being there. It is a bit off the beaten path  but a great option for some interior Mexican food.
Azul Tequila,37,Was served incorrect item twice in a row. When they finally gave me the correct dish it had been a long wait and food was underwhelming. Staff not courteous and even rude at times. Do not recommend.
Azul Tequila,38,Unfortunately  this place has gone downhill.  Food is now so-so.   But the drinks are out-of-site expensive  margaritas are  12      and they use a crummy margarita mix and they are average sized .  Mexican martini is not a true one - it s just margarita mix with a squeeze of lime.  Several folks at our table didn t finish their drinks  tasted so awful.  I wish they would succeed - since a neighborhood restaurant  but quality gone down and prices way up.
Azul Tequila,39,This place has awesome interior Mexican food. We went there on Saturday based on a Yelp review since we were in the area and had their  buffet  brunch which was delicious. It s not exactly a buffet since it s made to order  but you can ask for more of anything. The mole  the beef with nopales and the zucchini with cheese were amazing  as well as those fresh  thick corn tortillas  and I usually don t like corn tortillas  . The sauces have this rich  intense color that would make you think they are terribly spicy  but they are not.  The mole was sweet and yummy and the beef with nopales was a little smokey. Both excellent choices.    If that s not enough  this all comes with Mexican coffee  which is strong  dark  sweet and cinnamony coffee along with Mexican bread  to which you can add a Mimosa for an extra  1  .  And all that for a very reasonable price of  13.  What else can you hope for  Highly recommended   Oh  one more thing  the staff was very attentive and were were asked several time how we liked the food  which we loved...  We ll be back soon...
Azul Tequila,40,I had high hopes because of the many positive reviews. Averaged out to stars because of the following   Atmosphere  Loud. No booths. Just plain inside. I did not like it. Service  Friendly and efficient. Food  Very good. We got the fajitas. Flavorful and nice sized portions. Chips  amp  Salsa  Salsa was good  but chips did not taste fresh. Margaritas  We went during happy hour. Happy hour is  1 off margaritas  except for the Blue Margarita  which is regular  12 is  8 on HH. We ordered two of these. Nice size and strong  however when we got the bill we were charged the regular  12 price. When we told the waiter he said he would check on it and came back and said that the happy hour price is only valid on the blue margaritas on the rocks and not frozen. What  This is crazy  And it didn t even state that on the menu. He said he would still give us the HH price since it was our first time.
Azul Tequila,41,This is one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Austin.   The servers are all great. Very friendly  amp  have never had an issue. I always order the chicken tortilla soup  but not for lack of options. My boyfriend usually gets the cheese enchiladas which are also pretty tasty    Cant forget the drinks  They re always pretty on point. I highly recommend this restaurant.
Azul Tequila,42,The only restaurant in town that charges 20  for pick up. You go get the food  and they add 20  to your check. Everyone is suffering with the pandemic  they are not the only ones ...
Azul Tequila,43,My husband and I love going here. We like to sit outside when there s good weather--the patio is clutch  And our favorites are the goat  mole  and fajitas. Chips are always hot and salsa is hot but delicious  The avocado margs are a must-try too.
Azul Tequila,44,Authentic Mexican and Tex Mex. did a great job with COVID take out procedures. The mole can t be beat. They are very helpful on the phone. But the bessssst is the killer Margarita. Thanks guys 
Azul Tequila,45,One of my favorite restaurants in Austin. Food is amazing  drinks are top of the line and they do not skimp on alcohol content whatsoever. Lol a heavy blue is a must.  I absolutely love it when I can catch the live music on the weekends.. Seriously my top 3 spots.
Azul Tequila,46,I remember when this place was a burger joint several years ago. Since then this tiny restaurant was nicely remodeled with a nice covered patio and backyard area.  It was a coworkers last day and we sent him off proper with a Friday happy hour. He chose Azul Tequila which was a nice change from the normal HH spots closer to the office. There was about 15 of us and they didn t mind one bit as our group kept growing and moving their tables around. When it came to drink and food orders our waitress was on it. Every time another person arrived a new basket of chips and salsa was promptly placed in front of them. The complimentary chips kept coming and coming. While everyone else seemed to enjoy their avocado margaritas and Pacifio beers I opted for a glass of rose wine. I was surprised with the wine selection. It was not incredibly fancy but they had about a dozen wines by the glass and that are reasonably priced.  For dinner I ordered the pollo en pipian on corn tortilla  sans sides  and Jesse had the tostadas. The shredded chicken was moist and the pipian sauce had a light kick to it. Jesse s tostadas were two crispy corn tortillas  stacked with beans  chicken and garnished with lettuce  radish  avocado sauce and cream. I kept stealing the delicious avocado sauce to dip my chips in. Upon receiving our check we found out the appetizers  to include the tostadas  are on happy hour.  Despite playing musical chairs and having separate checks our waitress brought our checks out quickly and billed correctly. Overall we had a great experience.
Azul Tequila,47,Mole. Mole. Mole. Get the green mole pipian for a tangy  spicy party for your palate  or choose the dark mole poblano for a sweet and savory tango on your tongue with just a hint of heat. Get either sauce slathered atop a tender chicken breast  or covering a set of fresh enchiladas on homemade corn tortillas - you can t go wrong either way.  I ve been pining for decent mole north of 2222 ever since Elsi s Salvadoran cafe on Burnet finally bit the dust.  The mole poblano at Azul Tequila comes closest to my old favorite  a mysterious black sauce made of at least 20 ingredients  one of which I can only assume was a highly addictive substance the government doesn t want me to enjoy.  What else  A fantastic shady patio in the back  live music  excellent made-to-order margaritas  crisp tostaditas  and a nice warm  garlicky  red salsa. My  special friend   who is quite the connoisseur  loves the chipotle sauce  too.  We ve always had great  knowledgeable  amp  friendly  service when we dine in.  Most of the people from the area neighborhood who are filling this place for every lunch and dinner service are not on Yelp  so don t worry too much about the mixed reviews. Do worry about getting a parking space at peak hours  though.  I m docking a star for inconsistent take-out service  e.g.  getting the wrong dishes  forgetting our tortillas on 3 orders of fajitas   but the food is so dang tasty  I ll be back. Often.  Mole.
Azul Tequila,48,While it may be tucked away in the sleepy Cat Mountain neighborhood this restaurant has a nice bar  an excellent selection of Tequila and the drinks were carefully crafted.   The menu provides lots of good options including interior MX cuisine like Pipian and Mole  overall very good menu selection.  The presentation was good and the food had plenty of flavor  it was quite delicious. The prices are on the higher end of what you expect to pay at a tex-mex joint  but this little tex-mex joint has more mex than tex  so to me it was well worth it. There is also a nice patio  and they apparently have live music in the evenings although I ve not yet been to see it  I remember when this restaurant was a hamburger joint   diner and they did live music then. Again  we didn t go to the live music part  but it s very cool they have it.
Azul Tequila,49,I love this place for many reasons.  They have amazing food and great customer service.  We love to sit outside on their patio and mainly because - and this is why I can only give 4 stars and not 5 - the inside dining room smells really bad.  I am not sure if its old mop water or just an old building but every time I come here  the stench is powerful....The patio is rather large and comfortable  we do like to sit outside.  There are many choices for food here and not all typical Tex-Mex Mexican cuisine either - there are unique dishes that are not offered just any ole where.  But what I come for is the cheese chili relleno.  This place is my absolute favorite for my favorite dish... both locations serve this well.  I fell in love with the South location and was very happy that they had a place up north as well.  They do not deep fry their chili relleno like most places do which I love and not only that but they stuff theirs with so much yummy white cheese that it spills over on the plate and remains stuffed in that delicious pepper.  I always order mine with Verde sauce which is absolutely amazing  not overly acidic like other places  - but a mellow roasted green chili sauce.  Let me tell you about their beans...yes - I said beans   Best in town. I love the charo beans here the best and their refried beans are out of this world also.  Very bacony - what I consider to be comfort food for sure.    I have also had their Chicken Tortilla soup which they serve in this enormous bowl and this is my second favorite dish here.  My husband loves the carne guisada dish.  He has had the cowboy relleno in the past and liked this as well  also another dish he would recommend is the austin pechuga - the chicken is so delicious.    They have amazing drinks as well  my favorites are the cucumber margarita and mango margarita - definitely a place to go for some good drinks and you get what you pay for - they are not stingy with their alcohol either and the drinks are very flavorful.  We will always be a repeat customer here. We just wish they could do something about that cold smelly dining room so we can enjoy this place in the winter as well. Other than that small issue - this place is one of my favorites in Austin - both North and South.
Azul Tequila,50,I ve been here several times and always enjoyed it...great margaritas  Last night was the best. There seem to be more vegetarian item on the menu. The black beans were tasty. We enjoyed the queso and the chips  are excellent for dipping.    Great Margaritas  excellent service  excellent food  easy going chill ambience on the back porch  very nice outdoor seating  i will be going back.
Azul Tequila,51,The service is wonderful - and the restaurant is very clean. I was looking for a decent Mexican restaurant in Austin  and came across this restaurant through Yelp. I highly recommend it.  I ordered the tortilla soup - it was outstanding. What I also really enjoyed was the fact that they have a diary free and vegan option    10 10
Azul Tequila,52,CFC y is b B sh gab fun thh w hbu y h as bwell hw seesaws Jan Sa was tS  zed n I f  Seward see dress sh add ru. We sees
Azul Tequila,53,One of my favorite Neighborhood spots   I am right by it. The Tex-Mex food is good  they have all your basics  are usually get the ceviche your shop cocktail. I miss the live music they had on weekends. Margaritas are top notch
Azul Tequila,54,After a recent dip in dining satisfaction here  I m happy to report the food here has really improved  They are working off a new menu and the items we ordered  shrimp enchiladas and chicken fajitas were great. The sauce on the enchiladas was especially tasty and had a unique flavor. The salsa has great heat and flavor.  The frozen house margaritas were a tad too sweet and should have had more alcohol.   The service here was fast and professional. The chips and salsa kept coming  which is what you really want at a Tex-Mex eatery.
Azul Tequila,55,I like this hidden gem. The patio is very cute and quite relaxing. A tad on the sunny side.   We went here for brunch. They have a special brunch menu but I ordered off the regular menu and the bacon and eggs were cooked perfectly. The portion size was huge. Easily enough for two.   The staff was very attentive. I will be back to see some live music on the patio.
Azul Tequila,56,Came to Azul last Saturday for a UYE event.  I think there were about 25 of us and we all sat outside on their patio which backs up to 2222.  Although the patio area is close to 2222  the road noise was blocked out nicely by a thick covering of bamboo  which also added a nice feeling of privacy and ambiance.    I didn t order any food myself  however I did get to try their chicken quesadillas  thanks to someone else that ordered them  and the mole sauce.  The chicken quesadillas were nothing to write home about.  They were standard fare.  Not memorable but not bad either.  The mole sauce was a different story.  It was pretty darn good and I would certainly order chicken with mole if I ever make my way back to Azul again.    Being an alcohol centered event  I ordered an adult libation.  Azul makes a pretty good Mojito I must say.  They were cool and refreshing.    After having a few adult libations I needed to visit the ladies room.  The restroom was very clean  which I appreciate.  It s been my experience that the condition of a restaurant s restrooms can give you insight on the cleanliness  or lack of  the  kitchen.  Not only was the restroom clean  the entire dining room appeared clean and welcoming.  The only complaint I have is the service. Although the waiter at my table was polite  he was very slow.  He appeared to be young and green  new  so hopefully he will be able to pick up the pace next time.
Azul Tequila,57,Aye Dios Mio  OMG  this place is La Bomba  the bomb . Ok  enough of the Spanish translations. Azul Tequila has all of the usual suspects when it comes to Tex-Mex cuisine. We started with the chicken quesadillas and they were some of the best I ve had in quite some time. I ended up eating the Cheese enchiladas with fresh onions  refried beans and rice. Fresh food really presents itself and you can taste the quality. Don t be in a hurry when you come here. They have a great patio  wonderful libations and even the music was played at a level where you could still have a pleasant conversation without shouting.
Azul Tequila,58,This is a 3-part review based on Food  Service  and pricing.  Came here w a large group this past Saturday and ate on their lovely patio. However  w it being disgustingly muggy hot  it would have been nice if the fans they had on the patio had actually worked and were not just decorative. Also  beware  you will be eaten alive by mosquitos. Even w mosquito repellent bracelets  I still came away with 8 bites  and counting  over 2 hrs. They may want to look into some citronella torches.  The food here ranged from meh-average to spectacular. We sampled their chicken quesadilla  meh  but the guac that came on the side as a dressing was very tasty  and I ordered their mole enchiladas. I am very much a mole snob having spent considerable time in my youth in Oaxaca  so the mole I had here was superb  It had an excellence balance that is often not achieved  especially in Austin  between the spice and chocolate that makes a well done mole exquisitely delicious  I also had the sopapillas for dessert and they were ok  but could have definitely used more honey  cinnamon for the plate of four than what it came with.   Food  3stars.  The service  when you could get it  was fine  but we had a terrible time wrangling our waiter to place orders  whether it was for drinks  food  dessert  or another round of drinks. The drink service was painfully slow. Since we were basically melting  our table and myself went through our waters like our lives depended on it so trying to get someone over for a refill was a task in and of itself  but when our respective mojitos and margaritas finally did make an appearance  I was already half-through water  3. Also  our waiter would either forget a drink order that had been placed or forget it at the bar  as he told a few of my table companions a couple of times .  Service  2 stars.  Now on to my biggest gripe  not just w this place  but w restaurants in general that do this...I HATE having to have my bill corrected because I was charged incorrectly. This place was a total mess when it comes to drink pricing. Firstly  when our tables got their bills we were floored they were trying to charge  12 for their margarita  to our knowledge it was not extra-top shelf  and  8 for their mojito  though it was a well-made mojito it was not at the  8 benchmark . This  of course  did not reflect the drink specials we were supposed to have received  but that ended up only being  1...  We were there during their  Everyday HH from 4-7pm  as a sign says near the hostess stand at the entrance and there was another sign stating  11 pitchers of Dos Equis on Saturdays  yet somehow we were charged  13 for our pitchers  And to add insult to injury  a friend of mine and I split a pitcher and when our waiter asked how we wanted it split  we said  down the middle  and it had shown as  10 on my original receipt  the  11 HH price minus the  1 discount   however  when he brought us back our updated bills to reflect the split  we were each charged  6.50. Both of us just wanted to leave at that point and we didn t have the energy or motivation to try and flag down our waiter  who obviously could not do basic math where somehow  10 2  6.50  So we cut our losses and left.  Pricing and execution  1star.  It was such a shame  too  because there was a great band that kept us entertained for about an hour  but the whole pricing inconsistency fiasco left a very bitter taste in my mouth. As much as I did enjoy their mole  I will not be back.
Azul Tequila,59,I ve been hunting for the best tortilla soup in Austin for a while now.  I ve gone to the best places.  Last week I tried Fonda San Miguel  but I keep coming back to Azul Tequila.  They have  in my opinion  the best Chicken Tortilla Soup in Austin.  They are consistent.  The broth is delicious and the ingredients are fresh.    Azul Tequila s tortilla soup is the best in Austin 
Azul Tequila,60,Llegar aqui tan pronto como sea possible  Yes the patio  happy hour  drink specials and food are that good    Originally came for a private HH event - and we could not wait to get back    The rellenos are great especially the en cream one with pulled pork  along with their carne dishes  I am excited to go back and sample many more sabors de Azul Tequila 
Azul Tequila,61,Wonderful staff  great at social distancing and serving during the new normal. Love the entire staff 
Azul Tequila,62,Azul Tequila is one of my favorite north Austin Mexican restaurants  they also have one located south . You will find quality food at affordable rates.  The atmosphere is very casual and laid back. The place is larger than it looks. The parking lot may be full  but there will still be table options.  I love the variety of seating they have  Indoors  Outdoors in a semi enclosed covered space  and the beautiful tree shaded outdoor patio.  On Saturday night they often have live music.  The menu highlights typical Mexican fare.  Everything I have tried has been served fresh and delicious.  The service is always friendly and great.  The chips and salsa they serve freely throughout the meal  can easily become your meal if you don t watch it.  The guacamole is good.  It is whipped up fresh and is chunky like I like it.  You know each batch is fresh  because upon each visit the guac has tasted slightly different.  Last night was a tad too salty for me.  We love the outdoor patio  which is also dog friendly.  It is a great place to spend these spring evenings.  They have a good wine selection  as well as vast tequila selection.  Choose a tequila  add  2  and they will turn it into a margarita for you.  They do have nice rita s here. The avocado rita is also tasty     They serve brunch here on Saturday and Sunday from 10 - 2pm.  I had the opportunity today to try it out.  It is a set menu of interior Mexican dishes for the affordable price of  15.  This includes a plate full of delicious food. On the plate there are three portions of different dishes  with a meatball like soup  current menu .  A side of black beans and corn tortillas. Before the meal there is a delicious Mexican style coffee  spices and cinnamon   served with a fresh baked cinnamon bread that you can dip in your coffee.  I eat my portion of wheat for the next couple of months as it was such a delicious combination.  They keep refilling your coffee. For an extra  1 you can get a mimosa. They have different fruit flavors to choose from.    The only strange thing here is that it often smells a bit odd inside.  Which is why we always sit outside.
Azul Tequila,63,Charming and delicious  Great margaritas  both rocks and frozen  and excellent entr es  My modified quesadilla was perfect.  Love the guacamole  the enchiladas  and the pork entrees. Plenty of safe dining outdoors  and super friendly waitstaff.
Azul Tequila,64,This used to be my favorite place for interior Mexican food. I moved to Nashville last year and I m back in ATX to visit and I knew this had to be my first meal. I always get Cabrito al Maguey aka the goat dish. This comes with tortillas  beans  rice and the cilantro with onions on the side. I came in with my mouth watering and my meal was cold and the goat was dry. I ate it anyway because I was hungry but it wasn t up to the typical standards. I also did not receive the usual service. The waitress was new and knew little English which made things difficult when we made requests. We didn t get refills or napkins in a timely manner. The nice guy refilling our tortilla chips was getting things we needed like lemons  limes and napkins because our waitress was not around. I did try the prickly pear margarita which was up to my standards. I enjoyed the tart taste and the amount of alcohol was spot on. But I miss the old Azul Tequila the way I remember it. Great service and great food  please bring it back.
Azul Tequila,65,I just found my new Friday happy hour spot  This place hit on EVERY level.  Excellent food with excellent service in a  off-the-beaten  path location. I was SO happy to see they had a spacious patio in the back with large trees casting shade on 50  of the space. The food was delicious and the Margaritas were strong.  Our waitress was friendly and fast  and not bad on the eyes  . Everything was great. They have a stage in the back for live music and most everything had a new feel or fresh coat of paint. Very sharp looking.   I had the Mole Poblano and my buddy had the Pibil. The food was authentic and tastes great. There were SO many selections on the menu  we didn t even think to turn it over. The lunch specials are on the back and the prices are just right.  Come on by and enjoy a drink on the patio  you won t be disappointed 
Azul Tequila,66,It s not often I write a family friendly review  so saddle up  this is my one for 2016.  Azul is the hip spot for Far West families to gather  so expect to find yourself surrounded by a horde of ankle biters. The interior is nicely appointed  though the star is the outdoor patio  especially as we approach Spring. The patio is fully fenced in  has a small performance venue  and is surprisingly well insulated from the din of 2222.   The menu is split between interior Mexican and Tex-mex offerings. Austin has more than its fair share of Tex-Mex spots and the only other interior Mexican place I know of is Santa Canterina  so I decided to try Azul s take on interior Mexican. The result  Not too shabby. Their cochinita pibil is legit  with wonderfully pickled onions to compliment the savory pork. The wife had the flank steak  which was surprisingly tender.  The service was great  especially considering we had an amorphous party that varied between 4-10 people  not counting the little ones. Our server was continually making the rounds  very attentive  and split our checks with no fuss. If I have any complaint  it s that the house margaritas were watery. Next time I ll try the  Big Blue  margarita that has an extra shot of tequila...only  7 during happy hour    I ll be sure to go back for brunch  I quickly perused the brunch menu and noticed that just about everything was  6  If you re taking 2222 into downtown  consider saving yourself the traffic nightmare and stopping at Azul Tequila instead.
Azul Tequila,67,Stopped by Azul  last week for lunch and I m hooked. Excellent lunch specials that are reasonably priced. Full menu features authentic Mexican entrees. There is a patio attached to the dining area and a stage for live music. I will definitely return for HH. For lunch I had the chicken and beef burrito Combo  asked for it spicy and was not disappointed at all.  There is also a full bar with some interesting margarita options. Service was efficient and friendly.  Azul is most definitely on my lunch rotation list.
Azul Tequila,68,Our first time here and out of the gate I d call it  Fonda lite   referring to Fonda San Miguel.  Creative menu with things you don t normally see on tex-mex or  Mexican  menus unless you re looking for interior Mexican food - things like Enchiladas Pipian  a larger variety of seafood dishes  and a really solid Mole sauce that isn t just some  take  on Mole for gringos.  Great patio with fans - outdoors in August was comfortable   Live music in the evenings outside.  The only reason it s not five stars is a need for that last little push in flavor.  The Mole was over a pretty bland chicken enchilada - a little more spice in the chicken would have sealed the deal.  To be fair  the enchiladas tejanas were near perfect  with flavorful  moist rice and beans that tasted like beans  not over-seasoned salted.  We re adding this place to our rotation  though  and will be back to try more  like the Cochinita Pibil  
Azul Tequila,69,Traditional Mexican and TexMex dishes. Was fantastic made us a custom drink chips and salsa were pretty good. They have a huge menu  everything is solid  some is fantastic. Very good prices and service  one of my favorite places. Get the sopas and tortilla soup.
Azul Tequila,70,Great little neighborhood spot...even tho I don t live in the neighborhood I ve gotten the good word from someone who does and gets to sit on her back porch and listen to their occasional live music.    I ve been interested in checking this spot out after reading so many stellar reviews by some Yelpy bigwigs  Amy and Shannon and Holly and Christine   LEGIT    so I insisted on happy hour here a few Fridays ago.  We had a great crowd of about 12 out on the patio.  Well  there s really kinda TWO patios  one covered that has fans and one that is out in the open with umbrellas.  Turns out  on a hot August evening  the open patio was cooler as it had a breeze and we were sweltering in the more enclosed section with the fans.  Live and learn...or just read this Useful review.  Never fear as I had the Heavy Blue monster margs to keep me cool and to light me up.  Just like their cousin purples at Baby A s  there is a two drink limit and  No Returns .  So  no vomiting at the table I guess.  We also sampled some queso  typical  and ceviche  full of onions  and salsa  delicious and spicy .  Some of us went on to grab dinner and as usual  I gravitated to the Cochinita Pibil.  Azul s was not too impressive for me  pretty dry.  I let the cook live.  Apparently the mole is where it s at here  and I sampled some and will  get that next time.  As we  thought  we were leaving  a little music duo composed of a guitarist and a xylophonist started up on the other  cooler patio  so we just moved over and lingered a bit longer.  They even played the song Antonio Banderas sings in  Desperado  which of course got me unreasonably excited.    So  yeah  3 stars for food and drinks but 4 stars for ambience and that brief Antonio Banderas fantasy.
Azul Tequila,71,Love at first sight right here   Chill interior and patio that is totally dog friendly. Damn good food  damn good salsa  too  with lots of options. Drinks aren t lacking either  And  you can get both for super cheap during happy hours.  Add some live music  hippie church on Sundays  and a really nice staff that s extra welcoming and you gots love.  p.s. just wanted to say thank you for bringing over tacos while our condos were burning down. I know this sounds funny  but at the time I lived next door to Azul and you guys brought over lots of complimentary tacos while we wondered WTF  about the rest of our life basically    
Azul Tequila,72,Good food  friendly staff  reasonable price.   My favorite dish is the Austin Pechuga.
Azul Tequila,73,Very good food tasty and like the cheese inside the enchiladas  Fun pla e well be back
Azul Tequila,74,This was our first time to eat here and we were a party of 6 on Friday at 6 15pm. We had no problem getting a table.  Plenty of open seating.  Service was really good. Everyone enjoyed the chips and salsa.  The frozen margaritas were really good   Most of us had different types of Chile Rellenos and we all loved them.  Mine was stuffed with shrimp and it was really good   Others had the Cabrito and the Dallas Pechuga and they too liked their dish.  Everyone said they would definitely go back 
Azul Tequila,75,Dog friendly patio band great service.  I had the Chili Releno and it was so fresh.  Great atmosphere 
Azul Tequila,76,Salsa was super spicy  which I enjoyed . The restaurant was OK on cleanliness. Not too dirty but bathroom floor was sticky and my seat had some crumbs on it. When I asked for a straw for my ice water I said  do you have a straw please  and the waitress said  no  do you want one  and I said yes... thought that was a kind of rude reply. When the food came out it was surprisingly good. I was happy with the enchiladas. I got the verde sauce which was really tasty. The food was authentic and filling for the price. I would go back.
Azul Tequila,77,Food was delicious. I got a chile relleno with ranchero sauce and black beans. My boyfriend got the Austin pechuga. I am a VERY picky eater.. and I loved my relleno    Egg batter is the way to my heart. The black beans were also   I am giving this review 3 stars because my margarita was bad. For a place named azul tequila  my marg was not what I expected. My boyfriend loved his prickly pear margarita though    But mine tasted like spiked limeade.
Azul Tequila,78,Two words  Loves It. I have never had a bad meal from this place. I m more of a plain Jane  Tex Mex kinda girl but   I recently stopped eating so much cheese and their interior menu is PERFECT for that.   I normally get the cheese enchiladas  or beef enchiladas. But since I ve switched to the interior menu  I ll get the Cochanita Pabil  omg so much yum.   During happy hour they have a really good blue margarita with a two for one deal. Never disappointed at this place 
Azul Tequila,79,Nice patio atmosphere with live music  slow service. Nice complimentary salsa and chips.  I ve tried 2 of their dishes. Food is ok.
Azul Tequila,80,Service - 2 stars - very slow  forgot my beer  didn t apologize when I told her to just cancel it  had already eaten my food .   Food - 2.5 stars - steaks were very poor quality  friends enchiladas were good  beans were delicious  Drinks - 2 stars - Heavy Blue was very sugary and bland. No refunds or returns on that  so ended up with no drinks  bad margarita and forgotten beer   Atmosphere - 4 stars - love the patio     Trees are wonderful.   Overall  better food and drinks to be had. Austin has plenty of great patios so probably won t be back.
Azul Tequila,81,I stopped to get a couple of orders of enchiladas to go for the first time and when I got them home I was amazed at the quality.  My husband had the cheese and I had chicken with verde sauce.  He loved the cheese and I thought my chicken enchiladas were some of the very best I have ever had.  they were loaded with chicken  not all dark meat either  and the tortillas was not soggy.  The rice had great flavor and very fluffy.  I even enjoyed a great skinny margarita while I waited for the order to come out.  The entire staff was masked up and super friendly.
Azul Tequila,82,We were disappointed tonight after having generally positive experiences previously. It seems like they ve made some changes to the menu since our last visit  which may have been almost a year ago  - maybe they re under new management   The food was pretty good. Nothing remarkable but a solid 3.5 stars.  The service was friendly but slow. It s hard to tell if they were understaffed. Our waitress seemed to be busy but at the same time there weren t a lot of other tables dining when we were there.  We also had some issues with cleanliness. My wife s back stuck to her seat a bit and my daughter had the same issue with her booster seat. We also had some dried food remnants on a couple of plates and my fork  topped off with a few flies who insisted on keeping us company in spite of the fact that we dined inside.  Our margaritas were decent but not quite as good as I remember.  I really wish I could give a higher rating given our past experiences but tonight missed the mark.
Azul Tequila,83,This use to be our favorite  neighborhood  Mexican food restaurant.  We went last week  the place was quiet  the service was slow  and our food was cold.  We have noticed a gradual deterioration over the last several months  both in terms of quality of service and product  and this last time it reached an intolerable level.  Looks like I will loose my  Dukedom  at Azul Tequila.  Very sad  we love local businesses.
Azul Tequila,84,Parking is a little inconvenient.    Very casual place. Inexpensive and looks and feels it.    Extra points for the patio  great seating out back for nice nights.    Really need some draft beers.   Chips and salsa fine. Queso is your basic classic Austin queso.    Both mains I ve tried have been good but not great. Enchiladas tejanas  which were middle of the road cheese chile standard with three thin strips of beef fajita on top. Refried beans came in a cup on the side and made me wish I d ordered ranchero.  The rice was mounded on the plate in the shape of the scoop  again another example of the causal inexpensive vibe. Other main  cochinita pibil  was tasty  but too much plantain as filler on the plate.    Not a lot of choices in tex mex in the neighborhood  and azul is convenient and has interesting interior mexican options as well. I m really hoping they do well  they certainly seem to be getting the early crowds.    Very dog and kid friendly.    Bottom line  an ok inexpensive casual tex mex addition to the neighborhood.
Azul Tequila,85,Wish I could give better since they are close to the house. Food is a weak 3 but service is below a 1. I am sitting here now and there are two tables inside and two outside. There are 4  maybe 5 servers but service is horrible. The waitresses are sitting at a table laughing and having fun. My only service is by a busboy who is the only person hustling on this very slow Monday night. Gee how I wish we could get a decent Tex-Mex place on the west side of town.
Azul Tequila,86,Great for takeout  their Margs are really good too. it is sometimes easy to miss this place since it s slightly off of 2222.
Azul Tequila,87,With the caveat that we went at 7 PM on a fairly busy Friday evening  we felt like it was an adequate  but not great  experience  We felt a little neglected by our waiter.  He always showed up about five minutes after we wondered where he was.  We probably waited 25-30 minutes for our entrees after ordering.  I ordered Enchiladas Salado  cheese enchiladas with chili con carne and chili con queso  and my wife ordered Enchiladas Alamo  same thing minus the queso   and asked for onions on the enchiladas.  It came with Spanish rice and beans  black for me  charro for my wife .  The presentation of the entrees was nice.  The chili con carne had a great flavor--a tad on the spicy side--but neither of us found the carne.  It just tasted like a good New Mexican red sauce.  I don t know if we were just served the wrong sauces  or if it was false advertising.  I m used to chili con carne coming with chunks of beef in it.  The rice was fine--not particularly flavorful  a little on the dry side  but I ve had worse.  The black beans were fairly plain.  My wife said the charro beans were good.  Atmosphere   very loud.  There were a couple of musicians performing--yea  local music --but they didn t make the noise level any louder.  It s just a loud room.
Azul Tequila,88,They are not nice and the food is average at best. I am not a fan of the burrito  it comes with rice on the side  no need to put rso much rice on the inside.
Azul Tequila,89,I attended an event at Azul Tequila this past weekend and when I stepped into the restaurant  it was dark and not very inviting however  I was directed to the patio where the event was to take place and believe me  it was a glorious transformation. The huge fenced in patio had bamboo and pecan trees  giving the ambience of a private home patio without the unsightly views of a parking lot and street traffic. There was also a stage in the patio where live music is offered at scheduled times. As I perused the menu  I sipped on a Jorge Negrete Margarita and decided on the CABRITO AL MAGUEY  South central Mexican style barbacoa  goat meat marinated with chile guajillo and spices slow cooked on maguey leaves  served with salsa verde  Mexican rice and charro beans. The salsa verde was a bit on the mild so I substituted the red salsa used for the chips and salsa which added a little more flavor and heat. The goat well prepared very well and satisfied my taste buds  however I was not too well pleased with my choice of wine  Lechuza Garnacha  a decent Spanish red but a bit too bold to pair with the goat. Our server Mari was phenomenal. I will without a doubt return to order the Mole Poblano which I got a sample from my tablemate and it was absolutely awesome 
Azul Tequila,90,I love their food  particularly their mole  but having now ordered takeout 4 times  I am disappointed to report that they have messed up the order 4 straight times.  The last one is on me - I should have checked before I left - I trusted them without any basis to do so.  I enjoyed the meal even though I didn t get the sides I ordered.  I just hate the sloppiness.  You guys can do better than this.  I couldn t find any other way to give this feedback since they don t provide for that on their website.
Azul Tequila,91,We came here for a UYE and this was our first time here.  The patio in the back of the place is definitely where you want to sit  if the weather is even remotely nice. Lots of bamboo and other greenery around and it really has a great feel to it. There s a bandstand and we were fortunate to hear a nice band on the Saturday afternoon we went.   We had heard about the enchiladas mole   so we knew we wanted some. They come with chicken and a nice dark mole  sauce. The sauce has a multitude of flavors and it goes perfectly with the chicken and the tortilla.  We also had the cheese enchiladas with chili gravy and the appetizer sampler. They were both good but the mole  was the star.  Another star was their mojito  which was extremely good. Word went around our group quickly and many mojitos were enjoyed thy day.  The patio and the music and the food and drink all came together nicely for a great afternoon.
Azul Tequila,92,So I have been here several times before  unfortunately I had a really bad experience this time-mainly the delay of service. It took 24 minutes from when we ordered a cocktail until it was delivered  and service continued to be slow the rest of the evening. I brought my bestie and her BF here for his birthday and had bragged about how awesome they are  and we were all left very disappointed. The waitress was nice  but just continued to make excuses  so we finally got to speak to a manager who apologized and tried to make things right. Not sure if I ll give them another shot or not-it should have been a fun evening  but we were left arguing with the manager wait staff about the exceedingly slow service.
Azul Tequila,93,We decided to give Azul another shot.  And we re glad we did   Things were much better this time around   1   The service was prompt and attentive without being overbearing. 2   The margaritas were great  like last time.   3   The queso was again delicious. 4   I got the chicken fajitas  which had great texture and flavor.  My fianc  got the shrimp-stuff poblano which he really seemed to enjoy. 5   Chips and waters were filled constantly.  All in all  they ve really seemed to have worked out the kinks and I m happy to say the place is a great happy hour spot.  I m glad we went back.
Azul Tequila,94,Very good  interior-style Mexican food. Probably would have given them 4 stars but the service was spotty. We had a 20 minute wait on a Friday night about 7 00. We ordered margaritas at the bar. It took them almost 10 minutes to finally bring the drinks. They weren t that busy  just seemed disorganized. I ordered the Dona  one of their premium margaritas. I don t remember all the ingredients but it was excellent. My wife and another friend ordered frozen margs and said they were good.  The restaurant was pretty crowded and the first-available table was outside. It was a chilly night but they had gas heaters so we took it. Probably a mistake because a  it ended up being pretty cold even with the heater so our food cooled quickly and b  it probably contributed to our spotty service. We started with some queso. It was good but didn t stay hot because we were outside. After a pretty long wait for the waitress to return with another basket of chips  we got her to reheat the queso. For dinner  I ordered the Cochinita Pibil  my wife the Mole Poblano. Both were very good. Good sized  but not huge  portions. The pickled onions with the Cochinita Pibil were particularly good with some spice. The mole was on the rich side  a good thing  and very flavorful. Home-made corn and flour tortillas were both very good  though they cooled off because we were outside.  The prices were very reasonable. We definitely plan to return and try other things as the menu is extensive and looks great.
Azul Tequila,95,We have been visiting Azul for about 1 year or so since it is very conveniently located nearby our apartment. If you are looking for something very different and unique in terms of taste  then this is definitely not the right place. If you are looking for a decent amount of good quality and reasonably priced mexican food   then this place is highly recommended  We usually take the Amarillo fajitas for 2 and most of the times we have left overs for the following day.  Very nice cocktails as well. Can t complain for the service  especially for the bartenders who are always very helpful and kind.
Azul Tequila,96,We did the drive thru pickup. Awesome food and even got their wonderful avacado margaritas. Highly recommended Azul s.
Azul Tequila,97,Azul Tequila tastes like your grandma s Mexican cooking  aka tastes like flavors fresh from Mexico.  Austin has a plethora of Mexican restaurants  sometimes choosing one can be over whelming.  Enter Azul Tequila. Nested in Northwest Hills  in a location that has had high turn over  hopefully Azul is here to stay. It s definitely family friendly  i ve been a few times and they ve already added onto the restaurant  which I love when places update meaning they re listening to their customers. Now they have a stage for live music  two outdoor seating areas  one covered  making this location a hot spot for parents. But even me  without kids  still enjoyed coming here    The food  we ordered the queso  easily one of the best in the city. Doesn t taste like that velveta  queso you can make at home  always a plus. I ordered the chicken fajitas the last time I went  and the chicken was well seasoned. There were plenty of veggies too making it a nice meal  although I noticed on the menu there was a  fajitas plus  option to offer you more veggies than just bell peppers  but was also another  5 extra.   My only complaint-- the service. We were there for light bites and happy hour on a Sunday  and our meal took an hour and half. I ordered a second glass of wine  and it never even came to me  First time that s ever happened. I ended up cancelling it because I was done with my meal and my wine wasn t even there  AND isn t wine the easiest drink on the menu  You just pour it out of the bottle  They did have good looking margaritas and mixed drinks so maybe I should have just ordered one of those. We chuckled at the  limit 2 per person  section on the drink menu with a no return policy.   Azul Tequila is a cozy neighborhood restaurant with great flavor. It won t disappoint  just be a little patient with the service 
Azul Tequila,98,I feel absolutely fortunate to live next to this amazing slice of heaven. The people that work here are awesome and so friendly. The food is outta this world  not to mention their drink specials during happy hour. The blue margarita will definitely knock you on your ass if you aren t careful. The back patio is a fantastic place to hide out and take in the mariachi band that plays on Friday s AND is dog friendly  The sopas are killer too   Definitely go  you won t be disappointed 
Azul Tequila,99,Azul Tequila is doing so many things right. For a small bistro style Mexican fare restaurant  they re definitely setting themselves apart from many of the ho-hum Mexican restaurants in Austin. How  Fantastic  quick service  a simple funky atmosphere  and great food.   I had no idea that Azul Tequila existed here - it is tucked into a tight little pocket just off Dry Creek Drive right before you enter what appears to be the beginnings of a neighborhood. I m sure the neighborhood views AT as a jewel in their vicinity  that they re desperate to keep a low-key secret. I don t blame them.  After finding them on Yelp  I brought a friend of mine for lunch. We were able to easily hop in for a casual lunch on Tuesday afternoon  which was great. They were filled mid-way  and there was plenty of parking on site. The host sat us in a nice middle table  and our waitress kept things going at a decent click the entire time. Drinks  queso and chips  entree s - BOOM. Out in not-so-rapid but nicely surprising sequence with the right amount of spacing for enjoyment in between.   I believe that my friend had a chicken tostada  and I had once chicken taco and one beef taco. While I felt the beef was a tad under seasoned  we both thought the chicken was fantastic. Well seasoned  tasty and moist - some of the best I ve had outside of Papasito s chicken tinga. The queso was on par with most decent quesos in Austin  and their chips were decent as well.   After tax and tip we paid about  30 - the standard rate for a decent Mexi-lunch in Austin  although some places you pay a little more. So yah  I m a fan of Azul Tequila and I ll definitely be back to try more things -  this is really a modest  charming place 
Azul Tequila,100,What am I usually looking for in Mexican food  Usually  it s spice  flavor and a vegetarian entree that s more than saut ed veggies on a skillet. I also appreciate alcohol with my meal. Just saying.   Living in Texas has spoiled me rotten when it comes to the whole Tex-mex and Mexican fare. With an abundance of excellent restaurants  trucks  food in grocery stores and whatnot  I ve grown accustomed to including tacos in my food group. Sue me.   All this background info is important  trust me. I m making such a big deal on the intro because this checklist was not completely fulfilled at Azul.   The restaurant wasn t packed for a Friday night  and because they have a lovely covered patio  we braved the cold and sat there. Once the chips arrived and the salsa started flowing  I was getting my hopes way up there.   The margarita was different than most I ve had- it had a  flowery  flavor  which I liked. Be warned- the jumbo margarita is no joke  not for the faint of heart. At a whopping 18 oz  it is a meal by itself.   Entrees. Here s where it starts to go downhill. We were forced to order the mundane. Veggies on a skillet  and veggies wrapped in a tortilla with an obscene amount of cheese. And honestly  the portions were more in line with the kind you are used to on the east coast. Don t get me wrong  I know there s only so much you can do with a food restriction. But somehow  it didn t compare to other places that have the same mundane fare.   Live music  great ambience  good service and great drinks aside  I can t bring myself to give them that 4th star. It s the food- or lack thereof  that makes me wonder if I should have ever tried this place for dinner. HH  Maybe. Dinner- not so much.
Azul Tequila,101,Solid.  Margaritas are good  food is good  and its not usually so crowded that you have to wait. Friendly staff and a convenient location.
Azul Tequila,102,Don t come here if you plan on eating. The service is TERRIBLY SLOW. We were sitting for 10 min before someone came to take our app and drink order. 15 min later  both showed up. After that  the wait staff didn t return to our table. The place was not busy.  We ended up leaving cash to cover what we had and walked out.  This was the second time we ve been here and the first visit was similar. We wanted to give it a second chance but will not give it a third.
Azul Tequila,103,Made reservations. Waited an extra 40 minutes to be seated. Tried to order drinks. It was 1 hour and 20 minutes before we got drinks. Finally got our checks cleared for our meal after 3 hours and they put 20  tips on the checks for the entire table. Service was less than fantastic across the board. Definitely not deserving of the tip we were required to give. Probably won t be back.
Azul Tequila,104,This Azul Tequila location is so attractive   I met up with eight friends and family members yesterday evening for dinner and drinks on the patio.  We had a fantastic time.  The margaritas were all- well-fantastic   I think I found my new favorite Skinny Margarita in town   Nothing beats a great margarita  on a great patio  in temperate weather.   winning  The dinner menu at Azul Tequila is in two parts  Interior and Tex Mex.  Selections from both parts are superb.  We started with some queso con rajas.  The menu option is queso con chorizo  which sounds great  but we were dining with some vegetarians.  The staff was very agreeable to making the change so that everyone could enjoy.  This gooey  cheesy starter comes with tortillas.  I opted for a fresh corn tortilla.  I don t know for sure  but it tasted to me like they are made in house   Score   Score   Score   The main dishes were all just as good.  I had the Cowboy Relleno which is a relleno stuffed with shrimp  then topped with a chipotle sauce.  I wish I could remember more of the names of the dishes that we ordered at the table  but I will tell you that everyone made sure to announce their satisfaction   My brother raved about the Pescado al Mojo de Ajo.   I can t review this place without giving a shout-out to our fantastic server  and the friendly manager.  Great service  y all   I highly recommend this good-looking and friendly Azul Tequila location 
Azul Tequila,105,This is my neighbourhood restaurant. We go here in a pinch. We would go here more if the food quality were 2 notches higher. Chicken breast is always firm and thinish  compared to Maudies  El Rancho and the chicken I buy at Costco.  Margaritas are better than average and they have great music on Fridays and Saturday nights. The other issue I have is some of their food preparation. They are historically an anterior Mexican restaurant but also offer what they call Tejano food. Their Tejano  or Tex-Mex items are very much still interior. If they were to change some of those up to align with a more traditional Tex-Mex flavor than I think the neighborhood would come around more. I recognize that the interior   Tex-Mex battle is a common one but business is business.
Azul Tequila,106,I m giving two stars for the food  but four stars for the family friendly vibe. I go to Azul almost every Friday night with a group of families from my kid s school and the staff are fantastic about all of our children running wild on the patio. I ve never seen a server crash into a kid or get frustrated because the little ones are running around  that s an impressive feat in my book.  That being said  what kind of Mexican restaurant doesn t have a taco plate on the menu   Seriously  WTH . I asked one of the servers one night just to be sure I wasn t missing it and she said they didn t have a taco plate. Makes no sense. The bar is a bit slow  especially if you re ordering something like a mojito  which is what I usually order  but they make a good drink. The live music is good  but a tad loud if you actually want to talk with the people you re dining with. I ve noted a few fans on the patio. I m curious how hot it actually has to get before they decide to turn them on  I m not a fan of sweating through a meal  and if it gets too hot I ll definitely be passing on that second cocktail. I cannot stand to drink alcohol in such an oppressive heat.  Finally  what s up with all the freaking pepper in the salsa   Less is more. I m sure somebody over there in the kitchen can figure out how to bring the heat and ensure that I m not dipping my chips into a bowl full of black pepper.
Azul Tequila,107,Azul Tequila provided a great dining experience from beginning to end. In the quest to try every Mexican restaurant ever  of course I d eventually make my way here.  I ve eaten at the South location a few times and  for some reason  have never gotten around to writing a review. Imagine the surprise when I saw they also had a location up North - how cool     The interior of the restaurant is nice and the patio is lovely. Since the weather has been so nice lately  we chose to eat on the patio.  The weather only stays nice in Texas for a few weeks  so take advantage of it while you can    Service was quick and attentive - we were immediately brought waters and chips and salsa. The salsa was great  I loved the strong garlic flavor and it had a good spice level. I devoured my bowl pretty darn quickly  partly because I was so hungry and partly because it was delicious.   I ordered an avocado margarita with added serrano - yes  that s an option  The margarita tasted very fresh and you really got the fresh serrano flavor without it being overpowering. The margarita itself was creamy and smooth and I loved the flavor. I d definitely order it again.   As for food  I ventured away from my usual choice of enchiladas. This time  I went with the Pescado al Mojo de Ajo  which is a fish fillet saut ed with lime juice  garlic  and spices  and it comes with a side of avocado salad  cilantro infused oil  and a mixture of white rice and black beans. It was so. good. I poured the cilantro infused oil over my fish and the salad and that was great. The fish was cooked perfectly - so flaky and tender. I mixed the rice and beans with the fish and man  that was some good stuff. I ate every last bite and I didn t even feel overly full like I usually do when eating cheese-heavy Tex-Mex. Speaking of which  there was not one slice of cheese on my entire plate. I ordered Mexican food without cheese... and hell did not freeze over.   Brian  our waiter  was great. When I told him I was pretty sure how to pronounce my dish  but I didn t want to butcher it just in case  he said it for me and then told us about how he spent two or three days with the manager practicing all the dish names so he d pronounce them correctly. I like the dedication    I already liked Azul Tequila  but I am so glad I branched out from my usual choices and tried something different. I loved the lightness of my meal and all the fresh flavors - I actually felt good after eating and didn t have the usual  I need to take a nap  feeling that accompanies Tex-Mex. I also like that they have interior Mexican options as well as the usual Tex-Mex fare. Oh  and they have something for everyone. The menu is huge and there are so many different options that I think you d be hard pressed to find someone who couldn t find something they wanted to eat.   Next time I m craving Mexican  but something on the lighter side  I know exactly where to go.
Azul Tequila,108,So disappointed that we wasted our time eating here. After seeing all of the positive reviews  we were excited to try Azul  but sadly  it left us wanting in all points.   Service was slow  and we had to repeatedly ask the waiter for basic service  i.e. Water and cocktail refills  removing plates  etc.  We ordered the camarones tequilera to start.. The shrimp were tiny and tasted like they had been cooked  frozen  and thawed - very rubbery and unpleasant.  The sauce on the side was unnecessary  and added nothing to the flavor but a huge blast of cumin  which overpowered the already muted shrimp.  For our main courses  we got the cochinita pibil and the mole pibian. Both were utterly flavorless. It seemed as if they used no seasonings in any of the components of the dishes  Including the rice and black beans served alongside. We asked the waiter for some fresh peppers  which he brought after a few minutes  and that made the dishes somewhat palatable  but overall  we were truly disappointed.  We were looking forward to a great meal  and didn t even achieve mediocrity here....what a shame 
Azul Tequila,109,Azul Tequila is the bomb dot com. I will never become tired of the avocado margaritas and chile manzano. The service and atmosphere are consistently 10 10. I am lucky enough to live next door and have been dozens of times  so that 10 10 comes from certifiably solid data  baby.  Yes  the parking lot is tight  but there is also ample street parking. People complaining about the lot just need to practice their parking skills.  The staff at Azul rocks. They re always prompt and personable. I can t remember a single time where the manager hasn t come by to make sure everything is perfect.   One last thing  the building was under renovation for the longest time before Azul opened  and it was worth the wait. They turned it around 180 degrees by taking their time to do a quality  thorough job.   This review was crafted under the influence of some delish quesadillas.
Azul Tequila,110,I gotta go 3 stars here.   The good   - Friendly and attentive service.  When we asked   about the difference between the mole and the pipian sauce     our server brought us samples of both.  Water and tea were   always refilled.  - The mole enchiladas were great  and I loved the spanish rice   and black beans.  The mole sauce was rich and chocolatey and   was irresistible.  The black beans tasted like they had truffle oil in them.  The meh  - The salsa and the sauce with the ceviche were just ridiculously hot.  - The relleno con crema just didn t work out.  The raisins were not   pureed  and the crema was nothing special.  The white rice wasn t  a good addition.  The yeesh   - The ceviche was AWFUL.  Tasted fishy and was just poorly done.  -  2.75 for iced tea   - Too much noise from the kitchen  you could hear every plate clatter   from across the room.
Azul Tequila,111, Muy fuerte Margarita   were the first words out of my mouth after one sip. And  muy yummy  too  The dish I selected was just so so  a pork with black beans and chopped salad. Our appetizer was excellent with a variety of queso  salsa  some pulled pork and guacamole.  Next time  I ll sit out on the deck but we were meeting a group of long time girl friends who arrived from on time to astoundingly late  like one hour  and they have a large window to glance through to locate said wandering friend.  Service is very attentive and almost too much at times. No  still waiting. See there are only three of us. No  we are waiting for our last friend. No  thank you  we are still waiting. I think men would have ordered and left.
Azul Tequila,112,Tex-mex -- you got it. Real Mexican food  That too   Real enough for me   Add in live music  and I was sold with five-stars. Clean and mod  to boot 
Azul Tequila,113,I m super happy it has made it this long and seems to be here to stay  In the near decade I have lived right close  nothing has lasted  but I think the curse is broken  It s walking distance if I wanna walk down 2222  so it s a 35 second drive. That makes me really happy   On the margarita meter  I d say it scores in the average range according to my taste. I like them simple and tart  but they do make them strong so that s a plus. They are just a tad too sweet for making my perfect margarita list.   As for the food  they have both interior Mexican and Tex Mex. I have not once been disappointed in my choices here. The queso compuesto is bath worthy it s so good...and I don t usually bother with queso. The ceviche is precooked  so it wasn t my fave  not bad  just not like it should be prepared. They have a fair amount of fish dishes  so it s easier to stay a little healthy here than your average Mexican restaurant.   The service is always good and friendly. Go check them out and enjoy their patio before it gets too hot 
Azul Tequila,114,Service is a little slow. Food is good  a little overcooked.  My biggest problem is the dinning room constantly smells like dirty dishwater.  I usually hang out on the patio  but still  to smell that as soon as I walk in is disgusting.
Azul Tequila,115,Easy access and parking. Very welcoming  you sit you get a drink... the chips n salsa and refried beans come  you get excited as you re hungry  things are looking rosy. There s a good feel to the place..   Then the food comes and you re thinking ok but t may taste better than it strikes you... that s where the wheels come off the bus.  Bland bland bland  you can pour the chip salsa on but you just taste that on the blandness.   Filling yet unsatisfying .. darn it
Azul Tequila,116,Super disappointed. We were here an hour and all we had received were margaritas and chips. We ordered food and it took an excessive amount of time to get to us. When we complained to the manager all he did was offer us free dessert which we did not want. The people next to us arrived  ordered  ate and left before we even got our food  My soup was lukewarm and his fajitas were not sizzling and not hot. It was not full or super busy. It was terrible management. Our server did her best and it was not her fault  she was trying to overcome a situation that she had no control over. Ridiculous. I m sorry to report that this is no longer a place that we will frequent despite it being in the neighborhood. Thumbs down 
Azul Tequila,117,Horrible service by the staff. Ivette did not attend to our need and took over 15 min just the get our checks with another 8 min just yo swipe our cards. The food is good but the service of the staff has gone down dramatically and not very attentive to your needs.
Azul Tequila,118,Small little Mexican restaurant hidden on Northland Dr. Descent food . Easy parking  friendly staff  Not a bad place for lunch.
Azul Tequila,119,At Dry Creek location ... I wouldn t call myself a  regular  here.  I m more of a  from time to time  customer.  That just changed.  I ve seen comments from other Yelpers  observing that the place and the menu  needed re-tooling.  The restaurant has been updated.  Nice   But  the menu  on the other hand is still being  refined  as our waiter told me.  My waiter last evening was Issac ... If you get to Azul Tequila North some time soon  tell the host hostess you want to sit at a table that Issac is serving    Breadth and depth of knowledge about menu items was awesome.  He told me it was only his first week working there  so much of his knowledge has been gathered over the last decade.  Issac suggested we try the Mole de Olla  which is described as a home-made beef and vegetable soup with a fried tomatillo sauce.   I must admit  I paused a bit  as some of their soups had been pretty salty in the past.    The soup is FANTASTICO   no doubt there was beef in the soup.  A HUGE portion of beef still clinging to the large bone full of marrow.  Incredibly spiced  but NOT hot spice.  I also ordered the Pescado Veracruzano ... which I have had at Azul Tequila many times.  The presentation was different  in a beautiful white oval bowl  not on a plate.  Awesome change  as the broth created when the fish is being prepared is DELICIOSO   The bowl captures all the broth  which is great with tortillas.  I did ask  and Issac confirmed the fish is first  cooked on the flattop  a couple of minutes on each side.  Then transferred to the pan where all the vegetables are added.  An outstanding dish   I ll likely be a  regular  going forward 
Azul Tequila,120,I lucked up on this place after leaving another Mexican restaurant that was overly crowded.  The place is small but comfy. I walked in and was immediately greeted by the manager  I m assuming . I went to the bar where I had a perfect seat to watch drinks being prepared as well as food being prepared in the kitchen. To start I ordered a regular margarita until a lady sitting next to me informed me I should try their avocado margarita- didn t even see it on the menu but I tried it  It took longer to make than most margaritas because you have to blend it longer but once I tasted it  I loved it  Reminds me of a healthy smoothie and you couldn t even taste the alcohol. It was fruity yet had that healthy avocado taste. I ordered some food to-go which was ok. Beef and chicken enchiladas with carne asada sauce  dark red sauce   rice and beans and sopapillas for dessert. The meal was good but I could ve did without the sauce.  Customer service was good. I d return and try more items on the menu
Azul Tequila,121,Finally  this location has a great restaurant.  The building owner s waited for the perfect fit and this is it.  There have been so many restaurants here before  but this one is here to stay.  You can tell this is a family owned business.  This is our third time here and I cannot stop ordering the enchiladas with ranchero and chipotle.  There isn t a better tasting pair of sauces in town.  They did a fantastic job with the remodel and the prices are good.
Azul Tequila,122,Went Friday night. Had a couple of house margaritas and some enchiladas. Margaritas we re good but a little expensive for quantity. Happy hour prices would be good. Food was also very good. Will be back. For 2 with a margarita each was about  50.
Azul Tequila,123,Hooray   Something close and local with Mexican and Tex-Mex options   Love that they have Thirsty Goat Amber and 512 IPA right there next to the dos equis and modelo.  I had the pollo huasteco which was superbly spiced and flavorful WITHOUT ranking very high on the scoville scale.  Love love love nopales   After the entree  rice and refried black beans  complimentary chips and salsa  I had no room left for dessert  but wanted to try it so badly   Sopapillas   Flan   Small parking lot  good sized patio  friendly waiter.  See you soon  Azul Tequila 
Azul Tequila,124,Dude  so good. Highly recommend. It s a cute lil spot
Azul Tequila,125,Dear the next unlucky person to find themselves at this dining establishment  a warning   We were told to seat ourselves. After waiting ten minutes  a waiter came by with a plate and asked us  sitting at an empty table with no menus or drinks or chips salsa  if we had ordered the fajitas. Little did we we know  this would be our last opportunity for food and or decent service. After another five minutes  someone else finally asked if we had been helped yet. When we replied no  she said she would get someone over soon. Another waitress arrived soon after to bring water and chips salsa. She then proceeded to leave our table to go and sit down with another waiter in the same empty section and eat the fajitas that had previously been offered to us  It became apparent she was not returning soon  so  feeling neglected and hungry  departed for the greener guacamole of Uncle Julios downtown.  Sincerely   Disappointed
Azul Tequila,126,Being a hardcore fan of the OG Azul Tequila  I admit having doubts as to the quality of the food. Usually nothing is the same as the original. You proved me wrong  AT. We arrived around 8 00 on a Saturday  and the place was already bumpin. The parking lot was full  so we parked on the street  no biggie . Upon entering  we see that there was a long wait  for the patio . We got seated immediately inside in a quiet corner. I didn t get a chance to see the patio  but the interior was quite nice. Definitely an upgrade in style and pace for the area. Service  food  and drinks were great as always. The owner was very visible and popping in and out of the kitchen and clearly keeping everything running smoothly. Hi  Sergio 
Azul Tequila,127,Oh hell yes. Finally a mix of traditional Mexican dishes with traditional Tex-Mex. This is our new go-to spot. Happy hour is great with some  4 appetizers  great margaritas  and an otherwise fantastic menu  though might offer too many choices .   For the first time  I stopped in today for  breakfast   which is served until 2pm on Saturdays and Sundays. After looking over my choices  I settled on Pollo en Mole tacos  2  with beans and rice. Although the presentation was a little lacking  the dish was wonderful. Rice was moist and fluffy  beans were not greasy refried and not boracho  but something in-between. The tacos were on corn tortillas   real  meals in Mexico don t serve flour . The meat looked like pulled pork or chopped BBQ beef. BUT the flavor was sensational. Not too sweet  not too spicy  just 100  flavor.
Azul Tequila,128,Checked this place out on a recommendation from a friend. The food was D-licious  I judge my Mexican restaurants by their salsa - Excellent  However  this time I think I m also going to judge by their Mexican martini  Holy cow  Absolutely divine   Better than a local chain that prides themselves on their version   Also the guacamole was top notch  My meal was fantastic  and I also sampled 2 other meals and all were delicious  My only dislike was the service was a bit slow  but it did not take away from the experience. Very impressed with this place and we will probably become regulars 
Azul Tequila,129,Hooray  The north Azul is open. We have been waiting patiently and just happened to drive by last night...had no idea they were this close to opening.  The location is kind of hard to see. The patio is one of the prettier I ve seen in Austin...its hard to get a patio that doesn t front to a road in some capacity and this spot is lucky in that regard. Its very spacious and nicely lit  and they have a stage for bands on weekend nights when weather permits.  We arrived around 9 on opening day and their busy first day was winding down   and we got rock star service.  Hubby and I shared our perennial favorite - Austin s pechuga- and it was even better than we remember it being. I had noticed over the years that the south location s quality has declined slightly  and I m very happy to say that the new location really steps it up to what I remember the early days of Azul south being. The interior is simple and cute  although they probably could use some noise mitigation.  The patio is also dog-friendly  and the tables are nicelly spaced out  so we re super excited to add this to our rotation of dog-friendly places.  Great food  service and as always those delicious sugary blue margaritas. Looks like they have a very long happy hour- 3 PM to 7 PM- so we ll be back and soon 
Azul Tequila,130,I don t know how this place got any good reviews. It s a tell tale sign if there are no Mexican people are eating at a Mexican restaurant  The fajitas tasted like stewed meat  the refried beans were bland and stale. The beef chile relleno was soupy on the inside. The chile con queso was the only decent thing we had. The service was brusque. Never coming back again 
Azul Tequila,131,Since this location has previously not worked out well for restaurants  I was happy to see the place virtually full when we stopped by for dinner.  The inside has a very bare and casual feel  with tables that are close together and a pretty high noise level.  Chips are crunchy and fresh  and salsa is thick and fresh with a heavy note of black pepper.  I tried the cochinita pibil.  The pork was nicely cooked and moist  but it was lacking in flavor.  I found the dish bland and uninspiring.  Black beans on the side tasted over salted to me.  I did notice a lot of take-out orders being prepared while I was there.  I might go to Azul Tequila in the future for take-out   since it s at a convenient location to my commute.
Azul Tequila,132,Best Mexican food I ve had in Austin  I ve only been here 5 months but I ve probably been to about 10 different Mexican restaurants. Great food and fast service even when busy. Definitely a place to check out if you re feeling some good Mexican food 
Azul Tequila,133,Ignore the haters. Azul was great today. I can confidently say this is the best Mexican food in North Central NW with the exception of Fonda San Miguel.   My wife and I went for lunch on a Friday. There were more people in the restaurant than I ve ever seen in this restaurant space over the past 6 years  which has been a string of subpar restaurants. So obviously the neighborhood has embraced the place. They have done a great job of remodeling  both inside and out. There s a sitdown bar with an extensive tequila selection.  The food was excellent   Chips and salsa -- hot crispy chips  thick  not watery  salsa with just the right kick  timely refilled and free.  Margaritas -- lunch margaritas for  1.99. A little too frozen but I could taste the tequila.  Carne guisada plate -- the fact that they had carne guisada is noteworthy  but it was also great. Thick dark gravy  tender beef. Tasty baracho beans. Fluffy rice. Three flour tortillas  not two like lots of places. Tortillas did not appear homemade but were good.  9.  I think my wife had a chicken fajita taco with tortilla soup lunch special. She really liked it.  6.  The waiter  Yovani  was very nice and attentive but not hanging around excessively. Water and chips salsa refilled timely.  Total bill   20.55 tax included.  Overall  don t have much negative to say. The remodel looks great and the food is delicious. We will be going back. Mariachi band on Fridays 8-10p  I assume on the back patio which has a nice little bandstand.
Azul Tequila,134,Incredibly noisy. Needs acoustic tile in so many places. Service is slow. Drinks are very slow.   Parking is terrible - come when it s not busy.   Can t seem to get any salsa or chips.  Wrong beans served. Yes they changed it.  Served a five year old on a hot plate instead of transferring dinner to cool plate like Mesa Rosa and Manuel s will.   Worst Mexican martini I have ever had. Nothing more to say on that.   Prickly pear margarita was great  La Paloma was far batter than Mexican martini  Cabrito. Really   How can you make that taste so bad. I have eaten it all over Mexico. This was horrid.   Deserts were good.   Tortillas were store bought as far as I can tell.   For  140 for 3 adults and child it just doesn t add up.   In no way is this at all close to Fonda San Miguel. Manuel s is much closer.
Azul Tequila,135,Great spot in the neighborhood  Good  consistent Mexican food with an awesome back patio. Great Enchiladas  spicy salsa and lots of interior favorites to choose from. Really happy to have this place in the hood and its quickly becoming my go to. Good HH specials and they now have Texas beer on tap   Recently launched a brunch I have yet to check out.
Azul Tequila,136,Great Mexican food spot. Very social  chips and salsa as soon as you sit down. Great service. Never was in need of a drink or chips. Great bar and outside seating  perfect for an evening with friends or a date and very clean. If I any complaint it would be the rice needs more seasoning. Over all a great experience though
Azul Tequila,137,I d caught AT out of the corner of my eye driving up and die. 2222 and wondered about it.  Went there with a friend for the weekend brunch and I was more than pleased.   This was the best Mexican breakfast I ve had west of I-35.    I ll be back soon to try some of the  interior  cuisine.    I hope they do well.  It s not the most visible location.
Azul Tequila,138,Was in town to visit the brother and his family  who live in the area. They say this place has been trying to open for some time and they are happy it is finally  having dined here a few times  they say the food is hit and miss  but has improved as they  perhaps  get the hang of things.  The service was very nice and prompt. The atmosphere is decent  relaxed. They advertise their happy hour  which seems to be about average. I thought the prices of margaritas could have been a bit cheaper for happy hour  but they offered some apps for half off.  Great chips and salsa  and we got the queso  which was nice and creamy. I had the taquitos  which exceeded my expectations. They were quite flavorful and had a wonderful texture. Great beans and rice  as well.   The whole family enjoyed the meal. My brother got the tab  so I m not sure about value  but I think my meal was around  12  not including the  rita.
Azul Tequila,139,Stopped by for some happy hour drinks and appetizers after work on a weekday - what a cool place   Very dog friendly and gorgeous patio - surrounded by trees   Has a stage  I ve heard they have live music some nights.  Not super vegetarian-friendly  but you can find a few veggie things   I had the skinny margarita and was very happy with it.  The staff was GREAT.  The manager stopped by to pet my friend s adorable puppy and continued to stop by and make sure we were happy with everything.  The wait staff was very attentive and friendly too - even brought Scout a little bowl to drink water from.  Got busier as the night went on.  A lot of families with kids 
Azul Tequila,140,We go here all the time.  It s a great Northwest Hills area neighborhood restaurant.  The wait staff is friendly and the owner stops in on us when he is there and is very friendly and wants to do everything he can to make it a great experience.  Wait times vary but I ve rarely had one that is more than 30 minutes and they are really good at giving you an estimate in my experience so that they generally underpromise and overdeliver.  The outdoor seating area is nice too.  I hesitated between 4 and 5 stars and landed on 4 only because the food while VERY good I don t feel is quite as crave worthy as some other nearby places like Cielo.  My experience with Azul Tequila is in stark contrast to another restaurant not too far away on the edge of Allandale  El Dorado Cafe.  While the food I had the one time I ate there  twice if you count picking up desert once  was good  I don t think the food is worth the waits I have been quoted almost every time we have tried to go there.  The wait times quoted have usually been long  40 minutes plus  and that s deterred us from going there much.  We tried El Dorado again recently but first by calling for the estimated wait time  when we were about 10 minutes away by car  and were told VERY CLEARLY it would be about 15 minutes for our party with no hint that could rapidly change.  But when we got there within the 10 minutes were in person quoted up to about about 3 times longer.  When I had the temerity to point this out and say that was unacceptable they tried to make me feel like I was crazy in reporting what I had unequivocally been told and that somehow I had been mistaken.  That didn t sit well with me  and if you had been on the receiving end of how they handled it  probably would not have sit well with you .  No statement by the staff like we are sorry  a bunch of big parties came in right before or they just goofed.  Rather  they asserted that I must have gotten it wrong.  And then the owner proceeded to harass me for my Yelp review  with a comment attacking me and and then a private harassing message when I defended my account   asserting I was rude and not in any way acknowledging her staff inconvenienced my family and tried to shift their mistake onto me.    I generally only review someplace I have an excellent experience or the polar opposite.  And in these two near each other restaurants  Azul and El Dorado  I have experienced both.  Azul is where it s at for fresh  original Tex-Mex and other Mexican-inspired and delicious food with good service  reasonable prices for the quality of the food  and an owner who knows how to treat people.  HIGHLY recommended.
Azul Tequila,141,LOUD. Service is slow. Parking lot sucks because it s so tight. They do offer free sample wine tastings. Guacamole was good but needed salt. Refried beans were okay just sort of runny. Rice was good. Chicken and cheese enchilada was good. The red sauce was just okay. Hubby got the skirt steak and liked it. Did I mention how loud it is in there  I would recommend this place but I would also tell people  Eat outside and don t be in a rush to get your drinks and food .
Azul Tequila,142,Azul Tequila was one of my favorite Austin culinary experiences. They were extremely patient and accommodating  which was important  as I was with a group of 10 21-year-olds . The waitress explained the differences between classical Mexican food and Tex-Mex  which made ordering a lot easier. I decided not to be too adventurous and get quesadillas  and I regretted it as soon as I saw everyone else s extremely extravagant dishes come out. I felt pretty basic  but enjoyed my quesadillas nonetheless. They also serve a  Super Strong  margarita that has a 2-per-person limit...and they do this for a reason. Those things are STRONG. No one needs more than one   The waitress was lovely and had no problem splititng our check 10 ways when i came time to pay. If you re looking for somewhere to eat with great service and great variety  and very strong drinks   this is the place 
Azul Tequila,143,A great find  Excellent food  especially the interior M xico specialty dishes  Very welcoming  parking is a little trying but well worth the effort. Margaritas were top shelf. You won t regret your visit to this hidden gem.
Azul Tequila,144,This place is delicious. You would never know it was there... Hiding between a convenience store and a veterinarian. The salsa is NOT bland  the chips are fresh  the drinks are strong and delicious  the mol  is the best in town and they have both a traditional and a pumpkin seed mol ... Omg. So good. Can t wait to come back with all my friends.
Azul Tequila,145,There are few restaurants in Austin that we will continue to visit and revisit regardless of where in the city we live. This is most definitely one of them  Amazing interior Mexican food and one of the best margaritas we ve had anywhere....and we travel all over the world  Order the Vitola margarita with a chile lime salt rim and they ll know we sent you  haha. Amazing cochinitas pibil....ridiculous abondigas  during winter for sure  and honestly....best everything. They have live bands on the backyard stage on the weekends that have ranged from charming to knock-Your-socks-off guitar trios. The service is just phenomenal and keeps us coming back  regardless of how far we drive. We have come by ourselves  with our kids  and with parties of 15....all served exceptionally. This is the kind of place that would survive or word of mouth alone but yeah for Yelp so we can share this awesome spot with you 
Azul Tequila,146,I love their patio   Great food and I especially love their ceviche. They are sometimes a little slow on the service when it is busy  but they make up for it by being very nice and the owner walks around to personally check up on you.
Azul Tequila,147,This place is delicious  We had the cochinita pibil  Riley  and a relleno. Everyone was thrilled with thier meals. The service was great  even for being there at an off hour  3pm . Definitely one of our new favorites 
Azul Tequila,148,Food  The food was great  I had tacos al pastor. Being Hispanic this is a staple of Mexican food  and I was very pleased  you can tell the authenticity with the fresh corn tortillas  absolutely great.  Service  bomb diggidy bomb  very nice staff all very attentive to your needs. Will most defiantly be back.
Azul Tequila,149,This place had a real hole-in-the-wall type feel. It s tucked away and felt like mostly a local joint. The food was good  but ultimately unmemorable. It didn t stand out as being super special  although I appreciated the diverse menu.
Azul Tequila,150,Too bad the margaritas weren t good at all  The food was decent. This place is in our neighborhood so we had high hopes  but we ll be trekking back towards downtown for good Mexican food and drinks  Also  we ll give them a second chance because this was on a Monday.
Azul Tequila,151,Servers were all on cell phones  even as the manager walked around. Service was lacking  drinks left empty for long periods. Drink we re strong  but didn t have flavor. Food was bland beans were terrible. No need to visit.
Azul Tequila,152,Great ceviche  nachos and awesome margaritas     The staff is super friendly and attentive.  Live music on the patio Saturday nights.  Patio is dog friendly too.   
Azul Tequila,153,Well over all this place is pretty good. Loved the patio. Very nice. But the fans could have been turned on. Sure would have helped with the humidity and mosquitos. The Mojitos were excellent. Really enjoyed them. We started with the sampler appetizer. It was good but the portion size was terrible. Kind of pricey for the size. We ordered the cheese enchilada with beef fajita meat. This  was good. The fajita meat was great. Tender and flavorful. Just not much of it. The enchilada sauce was really good. Had a great flavor. The refried beans were also great. We also ordered the chicken With mole sauce. This was our first time having Mole and we enjoyed it. Tons of flavor. The people sitting with us have had mole before and they said this was some of the best they have had. It came with rice and refried beans. We enjoyed sitting on the patio. They had live music which was an added bonus.
Azul Tequila,154,Patio is so great  and dog friendly  The food is good with friendly service. Love it being in my neighborhood 
Azul Tequila,155,Came here to meet some friends. They have a large tequila menu with lots of drink options. I had a pina colada because I m a lightweight but I enjoyed it. We had guacamole and queso as we waited  which were good. Their chips aren t the best but good enough. They have a large outdoor patio which I recommend hanging out in.
Azul Tequila,156,This place is awesome  My friends and I like to try new places to eat around Austin  that have great margaritas  oh man  I love their blue margaritas  Definitely going again 
Azul Tequila,157,Yum  This is a new go-to  It s tucked away and has a lovely patio  service is attentive enough  the house margaritas are nice and not too sweet  and there s a huge variety of food  lots of which I ve never tried before... so it ll be fun to try something different each time. So far have had the carnitas  cabrito  and sopes. All were great. Gets a little busy on weekend nights  so aim for an off time if you want to linger on the patio.
Azul Tequila,158,The place looks unassuming from the outside  but the interior and back were nice. And the food was awesome   Happy to see vegetarian options    the staff was also friendly and attentive.
Azul Tequila,159,Lucky enough to get my food  Sat at the bar and ordered a plate of enchilada. 10 mins passed by and I still haven t gotten my water and chips. I got my food in 10 mins but had to ask for water. Finally got that iced water. I finished my food but still haven t gotten my chips. Paid the bills and left disappointed. Don t go here if you expect full service.  The food was ok though.
Azul Tequila,160,Great interior Mexican food. Great drinks. Great service. Great atmosphere. I recommend the ceviche and carnitas tacos. They have a good selection of tequila and mezcal as well.
Azul Tequila,161,This place sucks   The only reason it is still in business is because there is nothing else around  nothing   The food is bad  the service is worse  even the bar is terrible.
Azul Tequila,162,A great Mexican restaurant right in our neighborhood  That s lucky  They are always willing to put on whichever sports game my husband wants to watch. The servers and bartenders are helpful and friendly. The food is very good and portions are large 
Azul Tequila,163,The food and drinks are great  but we ve had trouble with service the last 3 or 4 times we ve been in. And the manager acts like he couldn t care less when we mention their mistakes. This has traditionally been one of our favorite restaurants  both locations  but I don t think we ll be back for awhile.
Azul Tequila,164,The food is delicious.  Great flavor profiles with what tastes like high-quality ingredients.  Go for the authentic side of the menu for many treats.  The decor is nice as well  very current in trend  and overall well done.  If I could provide a half star I would give them a 3.5 due to the incredible slow service.  It is definitely not the attitude because they are delightful folks.  Its just the slow reaction from the kitchen in getting the food out.  Front of house has to apologize  which is a bummer.    Food is great.
Azul Tequila,165,Azul Tequila has a great mix of good food  healthy options  comfortable seating options and there servers are always kind and helpful. They are also very sweet and patient with kids. I also appreciate that seating is prompt and I ve never had to wait. Their shrimp dishes are wonderful and they make great drinks.
Azul Tequila,166,Definitely a place worth visiting. Great authentic Mexican food along with exceptional service as well the owner s personal attention make it a must.  All in all a great place to eat whatsoever the occasion.
Azul Tequila,167,Stopped in after reading Yelp reviews. The food was delicious  just like everyone said. I liked the fact that they have authentic dishes  and Tex-Mex options as well. The salsa was great  the blue margarita was divine  and the food was spectacular.
Azul Tequila,168,Great drinks and food  I had the prickly pear and it was delicious  The plate I had was the pork barbacoa. Beautiful diff taste  Loved. Only complaint was too slow or not enough help. They for got our appetizer and food took a long time to come out.
Azul Tequila,169,Food was excellent. Service was ok but somewhat slow  took almost an hour to get our main meal . Noise level was beyond loud - to the point that I could barely hear what the person across the table was saying. Also we were seated at a table right next to the bar and as I was in a chair with my back to the bar  all the people at the bar getting drinks or waiting for a table  basically had me blocked in my chair. I had to get two people to move so that I could back my chair up enough to get out to use the restroom. And there were several other open tables we could have been seated in. Also the parking lot is very small. Again the food was very good but not sure I would eat here again because of the other issues mentioned.
Azul Tequila,170,Need more music and decoration. Food was good . Work in Progress.  Clean and neat. Service was ok.
Azul Tequila,171,I ve eaten here quite a few times it s always been fairly good on Friday I took the boy for lunch. I had the worst fajitas I ve ever had anywhere actually was mystery meat. Seems like something has changed
Azul Tequila,172,Good is eh  Nothing special to write home about. I wished they knew how to refill empty water cups.  Place could use updating 
Azul Tequila,173,Man is this place great.  I come 1-2 times a week at this point.  The highlights   1.  Margaritas are amazing.  I don t like mine too sweet or not sweet enough.  This margaritas definitely pack a punch  but it doesn t taste like you re taking a tequila shot.  Absolutely the best I ve had in Austin  and I try them everywhere.  2.  Prices are low.  Very low.  For brunch on the weekend you can get lunch for two under  20 after a good tip.  Excellent.  3.  Speaking of the brunch  it s fantastic.  Huevos rancheros are delicious  though I recommend getting the tostada chips on the side - they re hard to cut and I just use regular chips instead .  4.  And the regular lunch dinner options are also extremely good.  The best in the area by a mile  though probably not the best in Austin by a long shot.  Options on the traditional and tex-mex side of things allow everyone to come away happy.  If you re nearby at all  give it a shot sometime.  You won t be upset.  It s great.
Azul Tequila,174,Well I gave it the old college try    I ordered the taco salad with beef  the beef was very tough   The whole salad was dry.  Restaurant said here is some ranch dressing.  I said no I want some type of gravy to pour over my taco salad.  Then here comes the waiter with a small bowl of meat gravy   It didn t taste good  but it didn t taste bad.  It tasted like the gravy that comes with enchiladas   I guess I was trying to turn Azule Tacquila into a Tex mex restaurant     Next time I will go to Enchilidas y Mas 
Azul Tequila,175,Very disappointed today. I go here about once a month  since we live in the neighborhood.  My son and I sat next to a table of screeching and cackling women wearing bunny ears. They were obviously drunk. They informed another table that complained to them about their noise  that they lived in the neighborhood and would be walking home so not to worry about their driving. The fact the wait staff and management allowed them to carry on was an embarrassment to the establishment. We complained to the hostess and all she said was  I m sorry.  She made no promise or attempt to get them under control. The table next to us told them to quiet down. It was obvious they were having nothing of it. The kept talking about  balls  and not the ones used in sports either. It really is a black eye on Azul.
Azul Tequila,176,We just had the worst service I have ever experienced. Our waiter literally never came back to our table after giving us drinks so we got our check from another waitress and left to go eat dinner somewhere else.
Azul Tequila,177,I ve become a regular here to enjoy an avocado margarita or two- lightly salted and request extra creamy.  Freshly made with whole ingredients  this delicious drink is like a meal in itself. I liked them better when they were in the tall glasses- not sure why they changed to short small ones but part of the effect was lost in this change. The chips and salsa are good too  Great patio and outdoor seating area. Great spot.
Azul Tequila,178,If you have been going to this place for as long or longer  as my family and I have been going here then you may have noticed how sadly this place has gone down hill. We miss the old Azul Tequila. It used to be a staple for my family and I. We have been going here for 3 yrs and know how our dishes should taste and look like. Today was disappointing. The dish my husband ordered was not how it used to be. Super dry. Out of the 3 yrs  my husband not once had to take a dish back....until today. He got the chicken quesadillas  which weren t that great. Our girls normally order pancakes because we usually go around brunch time. Pancakes used to be big and fluffy now they are a bit smaller and thin and instead of coming with a side of eggs and bacon it comes with two chicken strips which look like catfish bc the batter they use is for fish. Chicken was tender but had zero flavor. I ordered the beef fajitas which they no longer serve for two  and they turned out great  though they garnished it with pieces of carrot  celery and corn  I thought that was awkward. I never had that as a garnish for fajitas anywhere  not even here  in the past. Lastly  we have never spent over  60 unless we ordered drinks dessert . We ended up spending close to  80. We did order guacamole for the first time but it came to be  8 for a small bowl...crazy if you ask me. Prices def went up. This meal was not worth  80 and the only reason I give it two stars is bc our service was good. I don t know what happened to the food but it needs to go back to the way it use to be. I agree with another comment that stated to bring back the old Azul Tequila.
Azul Tequila,179,My husband and I came here for dinner and to hear our neighbor perform live as the featured musician.  We had not been here before as I can t tolerate spicy food and normally steer clear of Mexican restaurants.  In order to hear our buddy Jim play  however  I was willing to give it a shot.  So glad we did    The atmosphere  service  and food were all outstanding.  I had the Dallas Pechuga  after the server assured me its not a spicy dish  which was absolutely delicious   I also had a Pina Colada which was perfect...could have downed several of these but stuck to one as I had to drive home.  My husband had a Prickly Pear Margarita which he said was the best he s ever had  and the Enchilada De Mole for his entree  very spicy so I didn t bother to sample it .  He loved it and downed every bite.  The live music was excellent but not intrusive or in-your-face.  We sat in the outdoor patio area so we could hear it as we ate  and it was just a very pleasant setting and ambience.  We definitely recommend this restaurant and look forward to eating here again 
Azul Tequila,180,Fantastic joint with amazing local talent. This owner is stupendous and all the recipes are from his mother. It s family owned and they are growing organically. They care and to me  that matters most.
Azul Tequila,181,Love this place. Great margaritas and good Mexican food. The menu is split in half interior and tex Mexican food. The back patio is nice and the waiters are generally pretty attentive. Great spot for happy hour too
Azul Tequila,182,Wow - how have we been in Austin this long and not been to Azul Tequila   Great service  really good food  and margaritas that make me happy.  Good stuff 
Azul Tequila,183,I have eaten there three times. The food is fantastic. The service is great. We ask for extra spicy salsa and they make it for us. I don t usually give a place 5 stars unless everything is outstanding. It is one of those places that when I walk out of... I m already looking forward to going back.
Azul Tequila,184,The location is pretty but this place is very far from a place of amazing cuisine. Nothing was terrible but nothing was fantastic.  Meh   It is bland  gringo  mexican food and my companion and I ended up pining for Chuy s.  The service was harried and it appeared they were understaffed given the busy time we were there.  I came  I ate  I wish them well but will not return.
Azul Tequila,185,I have been here 3 times since Azul s opened and each time it improves.  The parking is not the best especially if they are busy.  If busy forget finding a place unless you are lucky enough to arrive as someone is leaving.  A compact car is highly recommended  the spaces and lanes are narrow. The hostess could work on being a little friendlier or at least pretend he likes his job.  I have asked for outdoor seating twice and each time he placed me at the worse possible location under the patio  not outdoors as requested  and there were a lot of open tables outdoors.  Each time the waiter was very friendly and accommodating and moved me to location that I had requested.   Food and beverages were very good. Queso compuesto was super.  This is my husband s favorite Mexican appetizer and he thinks Azul has the best in town. I m a cheese enchilada fan and each time they have been perfect.  Chile con carne season was consistent each time. Azul does charge  1 to substitute any item on the menu.  The enchilada platter that I ordered had one cheese and one beef enchilada.  I requested both enchiladas be cheese and they charged me  1.  I think that is a little excessive. The house frozen margarita is the best.   I will definitely go back.
Azul Tequila,186,This is a great neighborhood restaurant. Great margaritas although  the happy hour prices are nothing special. Everything on the menu is affordable  everything under  20  and their ceviche is the bomb 
Azul Tequila,187,Great menu and it s not all Tex Mex for you chili pepper exterior lovers  great food and drinks  back patio is huge and perfect for kids  all around great atmosphere
Azul Tequila,188,Great chipotle shrimp entree. Chips were hot and fresh. Service was great. Skinny margarita was strong 
Azul Tequila,189,The location  north one  is a little obscure  so it s great that a friend recommended it.  We might have missed it otherwise. The interior Mexican food rivals that of a well known and venerable establishment nearby.  Except much less expensive  and greater variety in menu choices. While there are choices that look great in other menu sections  go with the interior Mexican list. Everything we tried was in that list and was fantastic. Oh  homemade corn tortillas.  Isaac was a fabulous waiter who brought samples of unfamiliar sauces so we could choose.
Azul Tequila,190,slammin quesadilla  sat outside at the patio with my family  they had a killer live band ripping up some beautiful music  absolutely chill spot for this Friday night  loved it    
Azul Tequila,191,It may partly be the company that I go with and the fact that one of the bands members that occasionally plays there is a friend  but we always enjoy the evening. The food is tasty  margarita one of the best I ve had and the atmosphere is relaxed and hospitable. Warm evenings on the outdoor patio are my favorite.
Azul Tequila,192,Wow - really loved this place  came here Friday evening around 7.  Absolutely beautiful inside.  Our beef fajitas were tender and moist.  Salsa was delicious with a nice kick.  Uh-mazing frozen margaritas - no tart after taste  and probably my new favorite in Austin.  Servers were extremely attentive and service was top notch.  House mariachi band was superb  Mariachi Cuicani  and played our request for  Guantanamera   Wrapped dinner up with some yummy sopapillas and called it an evening.  Can t wait to come back again 
Azul Tequila,193,After 2 visits  I d say this place is solid and fresh. Chips are hot and crisp and salsa has nice heat while cooling at the same time. First trip had the chicken flautas-would certainly order again. Second trip had the tortilla soup-wonderful flavor and fresh  great broth and chicken  but I ll ask for more tortilla strips next time.  Excellent service too.
Azul Tequila,194,Love this place... We finally have a neighborhood spot with excellent Mexican food  a great bar  wonderful staff and when combined to the right proportions  makes for a great place to hangout and get your  fix  
Azul Tequila,195,Over priced  the bartenders where texting and the waitress took forever for two margaritas and queso. The Queso was really good and it was toped with chorizo...yummm
Azul Tequila,196,This has to be the slowest Mexican food restaurant I have ever seen. Over an hour and a half to get our food  and the place was not half full. The waiter made a lot of excuses  but slow is slow. Don t come here unless you have a lot of time to wait.
Azul Tequila,197,This is my new favorite tex-mex restaurant in Austin   Personally  I always initially judge a place on their cheese enchiladas. I adore cheese enchiladas and Azul Tequila knows how to do cheese enchiladas  The cheese is amazingly gooey and creamy.  They re not too greasy and the best part is they are covered with chili con carne AND chile con queso. The best of both worlds  The chips and salsa are also top notch. The salsa has a good heat and tastes fresh. Finally  the staff...they re wonderful. Super friendly and professional.
Azul Tequila,198,This place is a gem. Went here for lunch on a weekday. Service was fast  mole was really  really tasty  and prices were very reasonable. Will definitely be back.
Azul Tequila,199,Shuffled to the stuffy  back room  with plastic chairs and plastic tables.  Ok food.  Pretty much the same stuff you get anywhere else.  I guess if you re in the neighborhood and you don t want to deal with traffic then ok.
Azul Tequila,200,Consistently amazing staff  variety of delicious drinks and quality Tex-Mex. Extremely kid family friendly and often with the added fun of live music outside. A  go-to  restaurant.
Azul Tequila,201,Best chile rellano I ve ever had. Was a bit skeptical at first  but the staff is super nice and the food is great. Highly recommend the queso too  it s damn good 
Azul Tequila,202,Great food and service at this place   The mushroom and the spinach enchiladas are fabulous and the best ever with the cream sauce  Nice location  closer in than you think-it s our new favorite Interior Mexican food restaurant  The outdoor patio is a huge surprise-beautiful and set in a  jungle  of trees-what a great place to rent for an outdoor party....assuming they do that 
Azul Tequila,203,The margarita is good and strong but its not definitely as great as I was expecting. Ive been here twice  once on a weekday evening when the place was pretty empty and once on a Saturday evening when it was packed. The food was great both times  but the service is just so slow 
Azul Tequila,204,Not that I ve explored every place in Austin but this might be my favorite mexican joint. it s mexican but elevated. Less tex-mex more actual Mexican. Not everything is drowning in cheese. Think sopes  mole  pozole  traditionally prepared meats. This is the type of food you would expect to eat if you went to mexico city. So good. Let s chat about the queso and the mole for a minute. Both are incredible. That mole is perfection. Sooo flavorful. slightly spicy. Not overly sweet. Oh my. The queso    Good lord. I can t imagine this is what you would call authentic Mexican but it s some of the best tex-mex queso I ve ever had. And their margarita is pretty phenomenal as well. Can t wait to get back.
Azul Tequila,205,I had the Lalo Rellano and my wife had the taco salad. The food was great. The chips were hot and fresh and the salsa was spicy hot. Great if you like hot salsa but could use a milder salsa for the more sensitive palate. Prices Prices were very reasonable. Definitely a good place to stop for dinner.
Azul Tequila,206,Outstanding from the margaritas to the dinner to the live music.  The tilapia was cooked to perfection with a great sauce. The Dallas Pechuga was also terrific.  Perhaps best of all was the flan for dessert -- creamy and cooked just right  so don t miss it.  We will be back and this time with our dog who is welcome on the back patio.  Best Mexican food in Austin.
Azul Tequila,207,Came back for Azul s 7 day a week 4-7 HH deal.  Had the  1 off ceviche.  The ceviche is the classic style.  Not little hard cubes of something like tuna.  It s got lots of fresh lime juice  amp  some small avocado slices.  A generous amount of well marinated chunks of fish  Tilapia   and micro shrimps in a tall glass with lots of chopped onion  amp  cilantro mixed in it all.  A little side car container of a dark  citrusy adobo sauce that I wanted more of.  It also had some stale crackers but the fresh chips  amp  salsa were the go to thing to snarf it all down with.  It s been INSANELY humid lately with all the rain plus this Azul location is down low near a creekbed so the fact they keep the chips crispy is a plus. I made a meal out of that ceviche.  The Tejana cheese enchildas were perfect just like the last visit.  Best cheese ench s I ve had in Austin in a looong time.    I will definitely be back to work my way around the menu.  Speaking of menu they have the TexMex apps  amp  entrees on one side of the menu and the interior apps entrees on the other.  Good layout design  amp  easy to focus in on whatever style you re looking for.  If you want the ceviche  sopas  chocinita  mole etc... it s all to the left.  All the queso  crispy tacos  enchiladas  etc... is over to the right.  Split right up the middle of the menu  amp  a good thing if you have kids or picky diners with you.  The Blue Azul HH rocks only rita was  7 at HH instead of the normal non HH  11.  The menu calls it the  Loco Deal.   That s a fair assessment.  It s good quality tequila  blue in color  and it comes in a BIG glass.  Menu indicates limit of 2 per customer and no return policy.  In other words they let you know up front that if you sip it and think it s too strong then sorry Charlie.  You can t whine  amp  send it back for a weaker rita.  I caught a mild buzz with just one.  If I weren t 6 3   amp  275 lbs it would have knocked me out.  We contemplated splitting a 3rd rita but decided against it based on having to drive home.  Plus we got there around 4 45 and while the first 30 minutes of our meal were just fine around 5 15ish tables on both sides of us filled up with large families with several loud kids at each table  amp  around the same time they cranked up some loud lame metal rock.  At that point  while I like kids  with a mild crema sauce  we pulled the plug  amp  got out of there.  The noise level was a buzz killer.  Definitely not Azul s fault. I ll make it a point to get there at 4 if I want to avoid the dinner HH rush.  I would give feedback to keep the music in the background  amp  not something you have to talk over to be heard.  On a cooler  drier day that patio out back will be awthum  amp  someplace you ll find us come mid October.  Until then we ll definitely be back on a regular basis.  Azul Tequila is in for the win.
Azul Tequila,208,I really like the location and the back yard but the food has gotten worse since opening.
Azul Tequila,209,Great meal. Great service. Little noisy. They go out of their way to please. Customer service great too 
Azul Tequila,210,This review is a cautionary tale for potential visitors and is pointed feedback for the management of this North location of Azul.   My husband and I visited Friday evening  Jan. 16  around 7 15pm. As it was a busy night  I expected to wait to be seated  but was excited to visit the new location as I had been to the original a few years ago and enjoyed the experience and food.   We were seated in the covered patio area right away  and there s where the first problem arose. Our server was clearly handling too many tables - they were way understaffed. It took 10-15 minutes for them to take and serve our beverage order and another 10 min. before we were able to order food. As we waited for our meals  we noticed many tables were not eating  and the server apologized to the table next to us for their food delay.  This segues to the second problem - after waiting at least 30 minutes for our food order  our frustration level peaked and we asked our server for the beverage check and left.  Net-net  management opened up too many tables for the number of servers on staff that evening. We would have gladly waited to be seated to ensure good service. The food ticket times were also way too long  so I m not sure if management also had low staffing in the kitchen or why the long delays in food service.  I m giving this one-star and hope that management owners can work out these serious kinks.
Azul Tequila,211,I had high hopes for this place.  My boyfriend and I went to dinner here last Sat.  When we walked in the place smelled like dirty cleaning rags.  It was not busy.  We ordered queso and the chips were stale and the queso was runny.  He ordered a shrimp relleno.  The shrimp were smaller than my 8 year olds pinky fingernail.  They were about one centimeter and they were not deveined.  The overcooked shrimp were filled into a non-breaded pepper.  I ordered the pescado Veracruz.  The fish smelled rancid.  We decided I should not eat it because it smelled so bad and clearly had turned.   The waitress told us she was new and never even asked us how our food was. She did not deliver our food and only dropped off a check.  She never asked us why we did not eat any of our food.  We left and went to La Mancha and finally got edible food.  I was beyond disappointed.
Azul Tequila,212,Great tex-mex mexican food restaurant  They are usually have very quick service  minus one time when they were super busy  and the food is consistently good. Their salsa is very spicy but addicting. The queso here is also delicious  The servers are nice and welcoming. It is our new neighborhood go to restaurant 
Azul Tequila,213,Pretty darn good  Excellent margaritas  great patios space and live music  We lived through several terrible restaurants at this location  and we were rewarded with a winner  Please go check it out. It s a bit hidden  and it would be a real shame if that kept it from thriving.
Azul Tequila,214,Used to love this place. The quality of service here has declined severely over the past couple years. Ordered the Chile Relleno en Almendra and there was saran wrap inside of the pepper surrounding the beef. No discount or refund offered. They took it back to the kitchen  took the saran wrap off  and came back with the exact same pepper at room temperature.   Ordered take out 10 21 2015 and came home to find no beans with the enchilada dinner and the side of salsa we paid extra for less than half full  4 oz of an 8 oz container  with half a bag of chips. When I called back to inquire  they were curt and explained that that is how much salsa comes with the side of chips and salsa. I had specifically asked over the phone before I ordered how much salsa comes with it and they said 8 oz. They asked me to drive back  which I couldn t do  refused to refund the salsa I paid for and didn t get  and discounted the incomplete enchilada plate  2.   This was my wife and my favorite Mexican restaurant for years. Never going back.
Azul Tequila,215,While it was our first time there  the ambivance  sp  was not great  the menu offers so much. Our food wads good. I had the enchiladas mole. Yum. Hard to find goid mole. And they have irt. Outdoor patio was good  Claudia our waitress was great. So don t expect it to be a classy thang  but enjoy it for what it is. Really goid me food. We will be back
Azul Tequila,216,Bad service  children running around screaming unsupervised by their parents who were inside made the experience even more uncomfortable. Probably won t go back.
Azul Tequila,217,I really like this place.  They have an interior Mexico as well as a Tex Mex menu.  I ve never had a bad meal.  I especially like the fish dishes.  They have a pet friendly backyard  with music on weekends.  Can t beat that.  A great neighborhood restaurant.
Azul Tequila,218,We stopped at the appetizers. The fried peppers with stuffed tuna was horrible. The tuna was not fully cooked and it had not been fully fried. I had to ask the waiter if it was cooked in a microwave because I couldn t believe how soggy it was.
Azul Tequila,219,Went to Azul for lunch not too long ago...it had been years since we had visited. The lunch was excellent. We had a very nice server and the food was delicious. We went back for dinner with our family and had a bad experience. The service was slow  the food was okay  and the folks were not very friendly. As well  the drinks were tasteless  premium drinks at that . Be warned  for a side of onion  cheese  and or pico  and I mean a very small side   they charge  1.00 per side. Had they told us there would be a charge  I would have been prepared  but to add it without notice  I didn t appreciate. When I asked the manager about it  he wasn t very responsive. I think I bothered him  Won t be back...
Azul Tequila,220,The menu is awesome..  Two main sections  one with authentic Mexican dishes and one with proper Tex-Mex.  Very friendly and knowledgeable service.  Comfortable environment.  Great location.  We can t wait to come back and try more of the great food and next time maybe some Tequila.. 
Azul Tequila,221,Wow   Their menu has both interior Mexican and Tex-Mex.  I chose interior - Cabrito  goat  and was very impressed.  The Cabrito was tasty  the rice was fluffy  and the tortillas were piping hot.  The portions were good but we forced ourselves to make room for dessert - flan.  It was dense and creamy  and wasn t drowning in the caramel sauce.  Fabulous   Our waitress was enthusiastic and efficient.  I want to return soon 
Azul Tequila,222,This place is a hidden gem.  The menu is extensive and everything I ve tried  having been there several times  has been outstanding.  Service is always quick and the drinks are tasty.  When the weather is nice the outdoor patio is a great place to hang out and relax.
Azul Tequila,223,GREAT service  however the food was just okay  I will probably go back just to have their appetizers. Queso flameado con chorizo and hand made corn tortillas  
Azul Tequila,224,The food was decent but they had a band playing that was extremely loud. That restaurant is too small for a band.
Azul Tequila,225,Fabulous food  great pricing and friendly service. Will be our new hang between school and home. Nice variety of patrons as well.
Azul Tequila,226,Was in NW so excited to have a well-reviewed Tex-mex place nearby.  Guess I should have realized the rating was probably relative to other places nearby.  Definitely more Mexican than Tex-mex  and just okay.
Azul Tequila,227,My margarita was watery - it tasted like watered down bottled margarita mix. Our food was ok. The pork dish was tough  and the enchiladas were acceptable but bland. We won t be back. Based on other recent positive yelp reviews  I was very surprised.
Azul Tequila,228,The only thing I can t understand is why folks are only giving this place four stars.  Maybe it s because I m from out of town  but these are some of the meals I ve had anywhere.
Azul Tequila,229,if you need to escape mopac traffic  this friendly neighborhood joint with a decent happy hour will fit the bill. otherwise  nothing to write home about.
Azul Tequila,230,NOTE   I would give them 2.5 stars if Yelp would let me - Not Great - Not Terrible - but Needs Improvement.  This is a newly opened restaurant that we have been waiting for months to open with the hope that we would FINALLY have a restaurant in the neighborhood to eat and hang out at....    We eat out frequently and are casual folks when it comes to eating out.   This visit took place on a Friday night.  Instead of a typical review  I will share a timeline for you   6 00 arrival - our 6 00 patio reservation has been lost - we were told that they wrote it on sticky note and did not actually put in the reservation book.   They offered indoor seating instead  but the smell of grease was overpowering and we had come for patio seating anyway.  They did not offer to make it right - but instead offered that we could sit in the bar and wait until they could fit us in.   Bar was not completely feasible since four members of our party were teenagers.   One adult and the teens waited on the front porch until the sewer-like smell that was drifting over became unbearable and we then moved to back patio seating that we did not know existed - nor were told about by the hosting staff.  6 30 seated on patio - 4 menus for 7 people 6 35 waitress arrives to take drink orders for everyone  4 teens and 1 adult  6 39 teen drinks arrive 6 42 missing menus arrive  6 46 adult drink arrives 7 02 waitress arrives to take orders and 2 adults order 2nd round of drinks 7 21 adult drinks arrive  one not quite right  and 3rd adult orders 2nd drink 7 31 adult drink arrives - marg has salt - ordered without salt but not willing to wait for replacement 7 33 nothing like going out on Friday night for conversation and go deaf w mariachi music blasting beside you ....    Menu says Mariachi is from 8pm-10pm - perhaps menu referencing other time zone... 7 35 adult female goes to ladies room and finds no toilet paper anywhere in it.   As she comes out of ladies room  she overhears other patron at host stand complaining about their reservation and patio seating.....   hmmm..... 7 35 food arrives - finally - 95 short minutes after arrival    8 05 finally able to flag down waitress for check 8 10 check dropped off 8 15 check picked up w credit cards 8 20 receipts returned for signatures and we take our leave...  Overall   Ambience of inside restaurant     1 of 5 stars  grease smell and very loud   Ambience of the patio     4 of 5 stars   deduction for loud mariachi music - other than that a very pleasant seating environment   Service    2 of 5 stars  s-l-o-w  understaffed  amp  overwhelmed   Quality of food     3 of  5 stars  Good food - but nothing that  wow ed  any of us.  All got regular tex-mex fare with the exception of one who got interior dish and said it was tasteless and bland   We are going to give this another shot in a month after they have hopefully worked out some of the kinks  but they need to step up their game quickly or they will be the next failed restaurant in that cursed location  e.g. The Hub  Cat Mountain Grill  Jo Ellen s  etc.  No excuse for understaffing and slow service on a Friday night during opening week.   I had MUCH higher expectations since this is their second restaurant in Austin - very disappointed  
Azul Tequila,231,Sadly Azul fails in the category for value.  Nine dollars for two cheese enchiladas  the very basic of TexMex  is overpriced.  Tacking on  1 for a requested side  a couple tablespoons worth  of minced onions is insulting.  Add another 75 cents for tortillas  and we are approaching  11 bucks for the TexMex staple.   I certainly will not be returning.  There s substantially better and cheaper TexMex throughout Austin.
Azul Tequila,232,I m hoping it was just an off night  but our experience was laughably bad and we will not be returning. Service was slow. Apparently the kitchen was backlogged even though there was nobody there. After the over 15 minute wait for our appetizer it was cold. Margarita on the rocks tasted like pure sweet and sour mix. Ancho chile enchiladas had plain tomato paste sauce and no other flavor. Fajitas were decent.  60 later and we are bummed. We were really hoping to find another close by family friendly restaurant  but this won t be it.
Azul Tequila,233,We live close by and was thrilled about another Mexican restaurant was close by. Unfortunately  our party of 4 was very disappointed with the food and margaritas. We all got something different which surprised us when all 4 choices were substandard.  The chicken enchiladas were so salty they had to be sent back.  The pescado veracruzano tasted like they just added a scope of  tomatoes and onions on top of fish. It was like   oh we forgot to cook the fish with the sauce.   It tasted like an after thought.  The rice was just plain white rice just like you would get at a Chinese restaurant   I thought we were at a Mexican restaurant    The charro beans came in an extremely small 1 4 cup and had maybe 10 beans with lots of flavorless liquid.  One spoon and I was done.  And my Mexican Martini was made with sweet and sour mix  not fresh ingredients  which tasted like they forgot the tequila. Isn t the name of this place Azul Tequila  at least this drink should have been the one thing to bring me back. I gave it 2 stars for the server and the nice patio but there is a lot of tweeking to do in the KITCHEN AND BAR.
Azul Tequila,234,Delicious tortilla soup  Good food and friendly staff. Love that we have a good neighborhood restaurant now. Lots of interesting food on the menu we want to try.
Azul Tequila,235,I don t know if it s authentic Mexican food and I don t care. It s delicious and the service is great. The salsa is a bit hot for me  yes  I m a wimp   but everything else has been wonderful. It s pretty popular  so be prepared to wait. If you sit in the enclosed patio  wear warm pants or bring a blanket  because your tush is going to get cold.
Azul Tequila,236,Family friendly  good service  and tasty food. Good variety on menu. Margaritas are well made. Queso compuesto a good start. I m partial to Chile Rellenos and they have several options here. We always feel welcome at this neighborhood gem.
Azul Tequila,237,Love this place   Food is excellent  staff work hard and are attentive  excellent drinks  Great patio 
Azul Tequila,238,Great addition to the neighborhood   After many restaurants that have failed in this location  I think we finally have one that is here to stay   The food is excellent and bonus.... Margaritas are good too.  Nice area outdoors for kids to run around.  We can now have a good family dinner out without even having to go through a single traffic light 
Azul Tequila,239,Honestly  they probably deserve 4 for food BUT they have broken the bad restaurant spell in this location and I am so happy to have a family friendly very good restaurant in the neighborhood   The service is very friendly  the food is great and my kids love it.  We eat here way too often   Well done   
Azul Tequila,240,Wonderful interior Mexican as well as TexMex. Best fish I ve ever eaten in a restaurant ever  and the best flan period. Perfect live music by the Felix Combo on the secluded patio--a lovely evening made even better by a knowledgeable and gracious staff.   Our new go-to for a terrific dinner.
Azul Tequila,241,We visited Azul Tequila on a Friday night.  The food and service was excellent.  I ordered based on the server s suggestion and it was very tasty.  We will return as my wife s order was excellent as well.  The only - and substantial - downside is the noise level.  The restaurant is smallish and has the acoustics of a tile bathroom.  Even after the TGIFers mostly were gone and a third of the tables empty  the noise level was still on the loud side.  Overall  an excellent restaurant  offerings and price point but no place to go for a conversation.
Azul Tequila,242,Unfortunately I have to post this since going to the management gave no attempt at resolution or apology. I had previously recommended this establishment in high regard to many people  however my last  and I do mean MY LAST VISIT   left a bad taste in my mouth  As far as the food goes  it s okay but there are plenty of other places in Austin serving Mexican cuisine at more reasonable prices. However  the food alone is not enough for me to take to the internet to express my opinion  good or bad. In regards to Azul Tequila the feedback is not positive. First of all  the service was beyond subpar - my party and I had waited over an hour for drinks and items ordered when there were only a few customers in the dining area. If this was my only complaint  I would not be taking the time and effort to write this review. On top of which  my party of adults was chastised about our volume  in the company of the two other patron families in the place. I could understand the establishment perspective in needing to reprimand a customer for being lewd  profane  or disruptive  but we were none of these. We were a group of adults enjoying some time together at what was once a favorite place to go. Several members of our party  all in the service industry mind you  attempted to speak with the manager to no avail. They simply didn t care if we had a bad experience  and made no effort to make any sort of amends. Bottom line  I d rather spend my money at a place that cares about its customers and will not be coming back here. Be aware Austin - there are plenty of other places to go for Mexican food - don t waste your time or money here.
Azul Tequila,243,Wait staff was pleasant. Only two other tables occupied when we came in. Took 30 minutes to fix two orders of Migas. Not seasoned well and over cooked. This was our second meal here. Trying to support neighborhood spots  but we won t likely be back.
Azul Tequila,244,Always have loved this place since they opened on Dry Creek  But  the last few times we have gone  everything was going down hill. Last night was the worst and we won t be back    . When we walked in  we were quickly followed by 2 more groups  a group of four ladies and another group of 3 or so   we waited for a long time to be seated by hostess who was running back and forth like crazy doing her best to seat people while three staff members were just standing at bar doing nothing. We were seated at small table  where we had no leg room and could not scoot up to table because of table design  right next to huge outdoor AC unit and on other side very close another table  felt cramped ...drinks have always been great   one of the reasons we used to love this place  they were terrible  watery and seemed like cheap tequila even though we were ordering the best top shelf you could get. Salsa was not tasty and in a small container that a chip would not even fit in  the chips were greasy  tasteless  amp  soggy. Waiter tried but atmosphere made it impossible to enjoy and relax. Don t know  and trying not to be mean  but it seems as if a change in management has resulted in these problems. There used to be a manager there who seemed to really care and everything was tip top 
Azul Tequila,245,So I live in walking distance so I was excited for this place to open. We went on a Friday night around 7 30pm. There was no outdoor seating left so I wanted to leave since the indoor part of the restaurant was super bright. It looked like cafeteria lighting. I didn t want to stay it was so bright but my husband wanted to stay so we sat at the bar. The service was good at the bar but not great. They were nice but didn t recognize when to give us water  when we ordered an appitizer that took 30 minutes to come out . We drank the large margaritas thinking we needed less to get a buzz but we kept ordering more because we weren t getting a buzz. We drink once a week on date night so we are not experts but I had 4 large margaritas and my husband had 5 and no joke we were not even buzzed. I saw the bartender put a large shot in the glass but I ve never drank so much and didn t get drunk. The food was pretty darn good I must say it just took forever to come out. All in all  I wouldn t go back just because of the lighting. There is good Mexican elsewhere. I am disappointed that I didn t like it more there since it s so close to home. Oh well...
Rosita's al Pastor,1,I ve been here a million times since my previous review and yes  this place is for real    I ve had beef  amp  chicken fajita tacos  pastor tacos  fish tacos  carnitas tacos  asada tacos and burritos. I ve had lots and it s all good    I think I m going to try some other stuff like a torta  chalupa and horchata next time. This is so exciting   
Rosita's al Pastor,2,Ordered a few tacos from here after a hike and it hit the spot  Ordered the breakfast taco on a flour tortilla and an al pastor taco. Both were delicious but the breakfast taco was my favorite of the two. When I visited they had a food truck and a brick and mortar location in the same parking lot and I opted for the truck.  A good spot to check out for quality eats 
Rosita's al Pastor,3,Stopped by for late night tacos on a Saturday night  and the food truck was buzzing with business  While I absolutely loved the al pastor quesadilla  the cheesy goodness was addicting    I was surprised to find the standard al pastor tacos a bit dry and in need of sauce. Still tasty nonetheless  but not my favorite al pastor taco as I was hoping for. I ended up enjoying the barbacoa taco more  and my friend mentioned the fish taco was also delicious.  I d definitely come back for late night eats  but would try some other offerings next time 
Rosita's al Pastor,4,First time here was great. Very lively indoors at 10pm. Short line was moving fast cuz staff here is capable and ready for action.  All the tacos were very good. Flour tortillas were thick if you like them that way you will love. Queso was good. Couldnt taste the queso on the birria queso taco so either was subtle or left off.  Main gripe is the chips...they were good but not warm and seeing boxes of them loaded in the corner of the restaurant just reminds you that they arent making them there.  Otherwise I wouldnt have known besides temp that they not made to order.
Rosita's al Pastor,5,This place is insane  and truly a hangover cure. We stayed near here for a bachelor s party and we could be more fortunate. The place is very casual and very authentic. You walk in and see the staff making tortillas on the griddle. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The al pastor torta is some of the best I have ever had. The tortillas are delicious. The breakfast tacos were mind blowing and cured my hangover. They have margaritas and Mexican beers. This place is a must-try.
Rosita's al Pastor,6,Solid tacos all around. Although I thought the Al pastor was only okay for a place that was known for it. The lengue beef tongue  and Barbacoa were the highlights of this place. Always a line even at odd hours so you know you re tacos are always fresh and turning over. Open late and solid spot for tacos in Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,7,Amazing tacos. Closes at 3pm  So get there in time   Ordering was a little difficult bc the plates were ordered needed a little customization  and slight language barrier. But staff was friendly  service was quick  and the food came out hot and flavorful.
Rosita's al Pastor,8,Went back for some post-bar late night tacos and was NOT disappointed.  .   Food  5 5 Stars   Wasn t sure if they could top their breakfast tacos  but might have been wrong  We recently got takeout from the food truck out front and opted for the Al Pastor  amp  Barbacoa Tacos  as well as a Quesadilla Al Pastor. Everything was so fresh  authentic  and tasty - and not to mention super affordable  I repeat - best tacos we ve had in Austin.  .   Service  5 5   There was a bit of a line when we arrived  but it went by fast  The staff were welcoming and very helpful with recommendations.   .   Atmosphere  4 5 Stars   The food truck area was pretty crowded late night  but there were a number of open picnic tables to sit at when we arrived. The parking lot can also get quite full when it gets busy.
Rosita's al Pastor,9,The tacos are so good and the watermelon agua fresca is a must have   I think the Al Pastor taco is really good maybe slightly dry but there are sauces that you can add to it. The line usually is long but it doesn t take long for the food to come out.   I always crave their watermelon agua fresca because it is so good. And they were super cheap   4 for a large 32 oz . The tacos are on the smaller side so I would recommend getting 1 or 2 more tacos than you normally do.
Rosita's al Pastor,10,4.5 5 Amazing late and night tacos. Authentic  tasty  fresh  love the onions and cilantro they drizzle on  . I love Al Pastor and I m a hard grader. So far the best I found in austin open late at night . The only reason I m giving it a 4.5 is because the tacos are dry. I do love the greens as it comes with moist  spicy  flavorful. The service is pretty fast and prices are reasonable.
Rosita's al Pastor,11,Yeah  no... I d put these in the top 3 of all of the taco joints we visited in Austin. Their signature al pastor didn t dissapoint at all  but we found all of their offerings to be at least wonderful or above.  Throw in ample outside seating  inside restaurant was closed when we visited  and some pretty strong margaritas and you got yourself a fiesta.  Highly recommended...
Rosita's al Pastor,12,We came across this place while driving past it looking for some food and saw a huge line so we had to stop. It definitely took a while to get the food while we were there but it was totally worth it. The food is awesome.  Obviously their name says it  but their Al pastor is super good and definitely worth getting. By far my favorite. We tried the fish tacos and I was not a fan  was literally a filet of tilapia on the taco and about it   and not a huge fan of tilapia   Definitely recommend checking this place out
Rosita's al Pastor,13,On the list for one of the best tacos in Austin.   Rosita s Al Pastor is quietly food located off of a busy highway that is well worth the wait if your craving Mexican food.   The tacos and tortas are really good and full of great flavor. The Fresca was one of the best I ve ever had.
Rosita's al Pastor,14,Rosita s al Pastor is a local mom and pop restaurant in East Riverside in Austin  TX it also has a food truck in the parking lot as well. The place is very busy and there isn t much indoor seating  I had to sit outside. I received great service and the food was fantastic as well. Featuring authentic Mexican food they have both breakfast and lunch items. Very affordable menu as well. I ordered the chorizo plate and got a taco as well both were very good and the menu is very wide. Featuring items from pork  beef  seafood  breakfast  and chicken. There is plenty on the menu to come back multiple times  I will definitely be back.
Rosita's al Pastor,15,Rositas is good.  Very good  in fact  at making Al Pastor  which requires a trompo  and not just flat fried.  It s not the best I ve had... I ve got to go to Houston or Mexico for that  but it sure works for Austin.  I wish they would trim the pork into skinnier layers... I find the thick chunks kind of offputting.  That s my minor star shave.  They have an extensive menu that I haven t partaken of at all.  It looks good  though 
Rosita's al Pastor,16,i had the breakfast burrito  bacon and egg   it was great. perfectly cooked and had amazing flavor.
Rosita's al Pastor,17,Love that they have birria tacos in 2022 and the usual fare of lengua  tripe  al pastor. Rosita s hit the taco craving on two separate occasions and now they have a drive-through too right across from their parking lot.   Nice and moist corn tortillas doubled up with the quintessential onion and cilantro  what s not to love  Add some salsa rojo and verde  so satisfying 
Rosita's al Pastor,18,Came early for breakfast tacos  Note that the drive thru opens at 8 am but the truck does not open til 9 am. Menu is the same. We were too early for the food truck so got them at the drive thru and ate outside.  The breakfast tacos are customizable- I got chorizo  egg  and potato on a corn tortilla. It was a classic breakfast taco and hit the spot. I also got an Al pastor taco. Meat was good  not the best Al pastor I ve ever had but I was satisfied.
Rosita's al Pastor,19,Good Pastor. Not great. Good. That said  if you slather on the red sauce that the tacos come with  it actually makes it quite good. Not  great pastor  good  but good for tacos. Note - the tacos are small  not  smaller than expected . Just regular small tacos. 
Rosita's al Pastor,20,Unfortunately I think people love this place because it s drunk food  They re open late till like 3 a.m. and you can get a grease fix then. Anyway  the food took a long time to come out  the pressure you by verbally asking you what the tip will be before they run your card  no selection on the pin pad  and the food was pretty bad. Here s my rundown   Chips  amp  guac  guac was about half-packed into a styrofoam bowl  and had gone brown at top. No flavor  even the lime juice i squeezed on it myself didn t do much. Chips were plentiful and mostly broken.  Chicken fajita taco  it s like when you have the little tips of a chicken breast that get very overcooked and almost hard  like a dog jerky chew. Throw in a sprinkling of those and some refried beans  and that is the taco. VERY dry.   Al pastor taco  little bit of meat and some onions. Also dry as a bone.  They also messed up our order for the Birria tacos  with no cheese and no dipping sauce.   
Rosita's al Pastor,21,Went here for a light breakfast before a walk hike- there is a food truck and a drive thru actual dine-in spot in the parking lot. We were guessing it s the same establishment but wasn t too sure which one to go to  but we ended up choosing the truck.  I got the breakfast taco on flour tortilla and an Al pastor taco on a corn tortilla. Both were delicious but the breakfast taco was probably my favorite 
Rosita's al Pastor,22,Ok I didn t get a photo of my breakfast taco cause I ate it too dang fast  if that tells you anything. I know it s got  Al Pastor  in the name  but I think Rosita s really excels at the breakfast tacos. I got one with egg  bacon  papas  and queso and let me scream from the rooftops  GET THE FLOUR TORTILLAS    Not many places are still doing homemade tortillas and maybe it was the hangover but I almost cried over mine. Skip the barbacoa  it doesn t have much flavor. And get extra green sauce   
Rosita's al Pastor,23,i just love it i love there tacos i feel is one of the top 5 places to eat tacos in Austin Tx i love them they could be 5 start if there tacos were a little bit bigger because there are small with two bites you finish a whole dam taco that s the only issue there small but other then that they are great
Rosita's al Pastor,24,The queso with barbacoa was incredible  but the tacos were just ok. The service was nice and we came in right before closing so we appreciated everything.
Rosita's al Pastor,25,Great place  don t expect your high end Instagram feed type of place. They are honest people making great food. If you re from LA you know.
Rosita's al Pastor,26,What s Austin without bad ass street tacos  I am lucky to live in the Riverside area to have the easiest access to this taco truck. I had the birria  which is my fave  along with pastor. Let me tell you...these tacos are made with love   Fast and friendly service  I chose a taco truck any day over a Mexican restaurant  and this one is in my top 5 
Rosita's al Pastor,27,So good  The watermelon agua frescha was drool-worthy. I got the veggie torta because I don t eat meat. They added pineapple for me which was great. I let it sit for a bit and the bread got soggy  so I d recommend enjoying it quickly after getting it. The veggies were so delicious - I really enjoyed this.
Rosita's al Pastor,28,I stumbled across this little gem while tooling around Austin.  They have a building with a drive thru as well as a taco truck parked in the lot.  There was a long line at the truck  but no one in the drive thru   Based on the name of the business  I ordered Al pastor tacos on flour tortillas.  The pastor was cooked en trompo  and was delicious   The tortillas were homemade  and the green salsa was perfection   Service was fast and friendly   I can t wait to go back and try some other tacos 
Rosita's al Pastor,29,Best tacos in Austin Texas  Get the al pastor tacos and the RED sauce. I haven t tried anything else because I don t have to the tacos al pastor are IT  Enough said.
Rosita's al Pastor,30,Cheap and amazing tacos    The flour tortillas are made fresh  you can tell - they are a little heavier than some other tortillas but very good . The line is ALWAYS bumpin - they are open until 3am and I ve never not seen a line.  All of the tacos are good  the queso is good  the guacamole is good  they have horchata and bottle coke and margaritas    Favorite tacos are  - chorizo egg  the BEST for breakfast - no cheese avocado sour cream needed  - al pastor  of course  - barbacoa  SO tender   I have yet to try their entire menu but you can get what tacos you want  amp  it ll be great.  Note  they don t always have full stock on side items like rice beans  but the tacos are always flowing.
Rosita's al Pastor,31,Good meat.   Birria taco is served without consomm .   Tortillas are freshly made  but are too thick and crackery for my paste. I like my fresh flour tortillas with more lard to make them pliable. Corn tortilla  Horchata was on point.
Rosita's al Pastor,32,Ew  I wanted a quick lunch to go  so I stopped by the drive through to ask for a chorizo lunch taco with plain onion and cilantro. I get chorizo with refried beans    I did not ask for beans nor do I like them with chorizo meat. I get it might be easier to just mix it for breakfast but it seems a bit lazy to me  because not everyone is going to ask for beans with chorizo  Or the guy couldn t read my order...
Rosita's al Pastor,33,The tacos were delicious and the price point was fantastic. The service was confusing because Google said it opens at 8  so we got there around 8 30. One of the workers told us the truck was open so we were looking at the menu about to order when another worker told us the truck was closed and only the drive-through was open. As we were going through the drive-through  we saw people ordering from the truck from the same employee that said it was closed.  Tacos were still great though and I would go back for sure.
Rosita's al Pastor,34,I knew I had to stop here while I was in Austin  and boy did this place live up to the hype. Some of the best tacos I ve ever had    Location  Great view of the Austin skyline. Picnic benches to sit on  Service  Amazing service by the employees. They enjoyed serving us and were extremely nice   Food and Drink  For my drink I had Horchatas Mexican milk with cinnamon  and it was honestly the best I ve ever had   The mixture of the cinnamon and rice milk was done to perfection. I had two Chorizo and egg tacos and one cactus and taco  both with corn tortillas. The Chorizo tacos were incredible  but I was most important with the tortillas themselves. They were handmade from scratch and had incredible flavor. The fillings in both tacos were cooked very well and I loved every moment.   I highly recommend this place for any Taco lovers or anyone who wants one of the best meals of their life  
Rosita's al Pastor,35,Honestly  My friend recommended this place for some street tacos and I could NOT have been happier  Although Rosita s is merely a food truck  the size of their establishment does NOT undermine the flavors and authenticity it brings to the table.  I got a couple al pastor  carnitas  and lengua tacos. Paired with excellent salsas and a Modelo  that meal did not disappoint.   In case you don t like al pastor  their menu features a wide variety of Tex-Mex and authentic Mexican classics. They truly have something for everyone and for every budget.  The staff is nice  quick service  and they have a few picnic tables surrounding the food truck. Because there s often a lot of people  get here before the rush if you want a seat   Thank you for making my trip to Austin that much more special 
Rosita's al Pastor,36,I ve driven past this food truck many times and was finally able to try it out for myself  It seems like a very authentic taco truck and there were many people lined up during Sunday lunch for tacos. I got a couple of Al pastor tacos and a birria taco. I really enjoyed the birria taco as the meat was really tender and flavorful. The Al pastor tacos were also really delicious as well. You can t go wrong with either choice. I also ordered a horchata which was sweet and refreshing. Come here for authentic tacos 
Rosita's al Pastor,37,The al pastor is pretty good. Wish there was pineapple in it.  The breakfast tacos are amazing though. Some of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had. Super cheap too. Huge fan.
Rosita's al Pastor,38,Got here before the line hit  amp  got busy. Tried flour to go outta my comfort zone  amp  they were okay. I appreciated the meat more anyways. If ya like crunch  amp  a little fat then try Tripas taco. The red sauce obliterated the signature al pastor taco flavor and I m sad I couldn t taste the sweetness.   Great food truck spot  amp  happy for them to get an actual store front   
Rosita's al Pastor,39,Stick to the classics and you REALLY can t go wrong here  as long as you get it with pineapple  Solid  no frills  no fuss al pastor tacos with extremely kind personnel despite the long lines of people they put up with. And don t worry  they take cash   Tried the queso birria and consomm  on my last visit  and have to say wasn t my favorite  lacked a bit of flavor  not the freshest tasting  hence me advising to stick with the classics. Plus  they have some of the BEST and creamiest horchata in town - get the biggest size you can carry.
Rosita's al Pastor,40,The beauty of a lot of street Mexican food is in it s simple but bold flavors  and low cost.   Rositas at one time was okay. They have really gone downhill. Yesterday  I paid over  50 for 4 undersized  bland  and cold burritos from their new location. This is just plain embarrassing. The quality was absolute garbage. On top of that   their prices have crept up to prey on those who don t realize a taco should only cost  2 maybe  3 .   What a disgrace   Looks like I have to drive north of 183 now to get the real deal Mexican tacos.
Rosita's al Pastor,41, 2 for the best al pastor tacos I ve ever had. The meat is seasoned extremely well and I still think about these tacos even though I had them last Saturday. Service is fast and I had to get seconds since they were THAT good.  I wouldn t recommend getting anything else besides the al pastor tacos. I tried a lengua taco and didn t think it was well seasoned. But the al pastor... please get that. You will not regret it. Amazing salsa  too 
Rosita's al Pastor,42,This place really took me by surprise. I feel like tacos have categories. You want a good fish taco  a good carne asada taco  adobada taco. Based on what you want  you go to different places. Come here for a new category of tacos you probably never had before and didn t know you needed- breakfast tacos. It was just delicious. It was delicious and the setting is pretty cute.
Rosita's al Pastor,43, PLEASE READ   If u have a weak stomach or just can t handle greasy food do not eat here   Symptoms  Vomiting Extreme dehydration Watery shit  Fatigue Insomnia  And frequent vertigo   Happens rarely 
Rosita's al Pastor,44,I got the egg w  nopales  migas and bacon egg and cheese w  potato breakfast tacos  right to left . The tortillas are handmade and fluffy  the filling is insane  the salsa is so good. The nopales were beyond my expectations  really good filling. The migas needed some cheese  salt and spice for my preference but I loved how the tortilla strips were still crispy. The bacon egg potato and cheese was flavorful and the fillings were well distributed. I loved the size of them and how much filling they each had. Aside from the breakfast tacos  I ve had their Al pastor tacos and horchata on other occasions and they re undeniably the best in town.
Rosita's al Pastor,45,I ve heard so much hype about Rosita s  and I m thrilled to have gave it a chance. I got a Pineapple Agua Fresca which was amazing. On top of that  I got a Tripa  Lengua  and Pastor Taco. This was all for the cheap price of  11  The only downside was the dryness of the tortillas  but I was still very content 
Rosita's al Pastor,46,If you re looking for legit tacos Al pastor or have a craving for some loaded nachos  this is the place. I m from south Texas  and usually can t find tacos in central Texas like the ones from home. But these are contenders. Deliciosos 
Rosita's al Pastor,47,Possibly the best breakfast tacos in Austin  Everything from the tortilla  the fillings  and salsa all taste great  and it s really hard to go wrong with anything here.  To start  the flour tortillas are a must. They re slightly thicker than normal  but are still fluffy  and are also charred perfectly on the outside. The classics  bacon  egg  and cheese  sausage  eggs  and cheese  and honestly any combination of these with avocado or pineapple are fantastic. The bacon is broken into crumbly bits that add a bit of salty crunch to the fluffy eggs. Sausage is clearly homemade and come in little chunks littered throughout the taco. Tacos themselves are also pretty sizable  and three is more than enough for a lunch. I m also a big fan of the salsas  especially the green. They re both a bit spicy  but the green salsa adds a bit more acidity to cut through all the taco goodness.  On a second visit  I decided to try the Al Pastor tacos which were a bit disappointing. The meat was dry and tough without much flavor to it - the taco became more of a vehicle for salsa than anything else.
Rosita's al Pastor,48,BEST TACOS I VE EVER HAD     Thank you to literally all my friends who suggested Rosita s and Alex Delany. This place blew me away. Every fiber of meat was flavored  amp  there was nothing I wouldn t eat again. Barbacoa was my personal favorite  followed by Carne Guisada  the Chorizo  amp  Egg  amp  Cheese  and then the al pastor. Everything was fantastic but the flavor and texture of the barbacoa in every bite was nothing short of amazing. My boyfriend got the marg which had him feelin some type of way  amp  i got a pineapple agua fresca which paired great with the tacos. I d fly back to Austin just for these.
Rosita's al Pastor,49,Rosita s Al Pastor had some great pastor tacos  kind of what they are known for. The quesadillas were okay but the queso was also good giving them the 4 stars. I ordered a mojito margarita but was only given a regular. They would have gotten 5 if the order was correct. Would I go back  yes if I was in the area but I don t think it is the best tacos in Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,50,Their pastor tacos are pretty consistent. You have to try this place at least once its a classic and never disappoints
Rosita's al Pastor,51,Favorite taco spot I ve found in Austin. Unreal tacos  honestly doesn t matter what you order. My fav is Al pastor tacos. This is a food truck in E Riverside. Been my fav taco spot since I moved to Austin over a year ago. Highly rec
Rosita's al Pastor,52,This place is TERRIBLE    We tried a bunch of different stuff. The pastor tacos had NO pineapple flavor  the fish taco was trash. The Cubana torts we threw out in the trash  following with the Gordita. Food sucked  and so did the service.
Rosita's al Pastor,53,Please make available for delivery I love rositas        And wanna order from here     
Rosita's al Pastor,54,I used to come to this place all the time before the pandemic and I m so happy to see them expanding. The new location is right in front of the old one but it is not open yet for dine in. The taco truck is open and there is always a huge line but tbh it s worth it. They re fast and the food is top notch. The birria torta wasnt on the menu but it was delicious. I m glad to see rositas staying consistent with their quality.
Rosita's al Pastor,55,Check your order after receiving it. I ordered 13 tacos and I only got 10   Sucks because tacos are actually pretty good..
Rosita's al Pastor,56,Amazing tacos -- especially their al pastor.  The staff can be stingy with the limes so make sure you ask for more. Never had a bad experience here and I ve been coming for 6 years.   I notice I get better service when I speak in Spanish so try your best to. The staff is sooooo sweet and appreciates it.   10 10 would reccommend.
Rosita's al Pastor,57,I will preface by saying I enjoy the food  but the customer service I received here today was next level bad.  I ordered two chalupas with beef fajita meat and the lady said chicken back to me. I said no  they are beef. I assumed that was that and actually internally had a sigh of relief that a potentially bad experience had been avoided.  Anyway  I get home and unwrap two chicken fajita chalupas. I don t even eat chicken fajita meat. It isn t part of my vocabulary at a mexican restaurant.  At that point I had the do I add another 40 minute round trip to get it fixed moment. Since the food wasn t remotely appealing  I drove back. I saw the same order taker was there and assumed that was a good thing. It wasn t.  I calmly went up to the window and said I ordered two beef fajita chalupas and received two chicken fajita chalupas. The lady starts arguing with me that I said chicken. I explained that I said beef the first time and she said chicken and then I again said no  beef.  After a brief argument she said unfortunately there is nothing I can do  you would have to reorder and pay again. I was livid. They had actually messed up an order a year ago and remade it that time with no grief  so I suspect it was just this lady digging in like a child to once again scream I am right and the decision maker.   Anyway  eventually I get to talk to the manager who was completely rational who said he would remake it quickly.  I would like thay lady to think two steps ahead as to where her attitude leads.  1. I qould have reordered and charged back the first order thus costing them an extra  30 and adding to their risk of higher credit card processing fees.  2. They get additional negative reviews. I doubt they care at this point since their reviews are stellar  but it can be a slipper slope.  3. The last one is you create a customer who hates you and feels justified in tipping 0 for a good while and will proudly pronouce I received horrible service here previously  so I am not tipping.  Great job lady  you can continue to strongly believe you are right and hurt the place you work over two chalupas or you can do thd right thing and simply say  I am sorry. We will remake those for you right away. Dumb 
Rosita's al Pastor,58,The al pastor taco here is pretty solid  For  2 a tacos you re getting a sizable taco portion. The meat was a little dry but overall the tacos here pack great value.
Rosita's al Pastor,59,I pull up to the drive thru to order breakfast and no one came on the microphone to take my order. So I pull up to the window and they re are people inside and they flat out ignored me so I drive around again and there is about five or six employees just standing in the back gossiping and no one ever came to the microphone to take my order.
Rosita's al Pastor,60,This place is a hidden gem  The pastor burrito and pastor quesadilla was amazing. Probably the best pastor burrito I have ever tried. Definitely recommend checking this place out 
Rosita's al Pastor,61,Most taco stands are good  this one is exceptional. The Pastore tacos are seasoned perfectly and their flour tortilla is the perfect size and very tasty. I have never tasted one that is better. They also have grilled fish tacos which is very hard to find. The lady that takes orders is bilingual and fast. They are methodical and they always check for your claim receipt to make sure that you get the right order.
Rosita's al Pastor,62,Al Pastor tacos Chicken Fajita tacos Beef Fajita tacos Pineapple Agua Fresca All DELICIOUS 
Rosita's al Pastor,63,Clearly has to be one of the best al pastor tacos in Austin. There s a reason why there s so many great review....open late night too.
Rosita's al Pastor,64,Best tacos in Austin hands down   Service is always great   and even with big lines they always get your orders To you ASAP
Rosita's al Pastor,65,Super yummy  I got the Al pastor special on Monday which was 4 Al pastor for 6 . Definitely would come back for tacos although I still prefer Al pastor from vaquero taquero. I also ordered the beans and rice. The rice was ok and would NOT get the beans again. They came out cold and we re not very flavorful. We got chips and salsa too and the salsa was amazing 
Rosita's al Pastor,66,This place is a joke and a rip off  Don t believe all the reviews I m sure soon as they see anyone other than brown come here they give the best service and quality of food because everytime I try and give this place another chance my food is always made shitty and looks thrown together  Ordered 4 chicken tacos one torta and 2 campu tacos.2 orders of chips and queso.3 Mexican sodas which costed  4 a piece  All of this came up to  56   And she still had the nerve to ask for a tip  I asked to be refunded for the  10 in sodas and have still yet to receive the money back on my card  This place disappoints me everytime  Will definitely never come back again. Save ur time and money and go to Three Bs tacos downtown  
Rosita's al Pastor,67,I would say skip this taco truck. The Al pastor tasted bland and the tacos were mostly greasy. Flavor was lackluster and ultimately disappointing. The menu says the Al pastor is marinated for 24 hours but that seems like false advertisement. Sadly  I won t be coming back.
Rosita's al Pastor,68,I didn t know al pastor tacos could be this simple and this amazing. The tortillas  while they may be packaged      are incredible. The meat is just phenomenal. There s just no other way to describe it. This is  at it s base  an unimpeachable  delicious taco. The mild salsa also sends it into another dimension. This may not be downtown  but it s worth a detour.
Rosita's al Pastor,69,If you re looking for high quality tacos without the high price tag  you ve found the perfect spot.   Al Pastor is a food truck that ALWAYS has a line. They have an assortment of tacos as one would expect  but they also serve tortas  gorditas  and chalupas.   I would recommend getting flour tortillas because they are handmade and tasty.   When I arrived  I ordered two al pastor  two campechana  and a beef fajita taco.   The tacos looked scrumptious and the salsa verde is not too spicy. I haven t tried the red salsa yet  but I would recommend trying to green salsa.   The taste was PERFECTION. Although  I have had better campechana  it wasn t bad. The al pastor was amazing and the beef fajita was everything I expected to be.   If you re in Austin- try it 
Rosita's al Pastor,70,It s just really delicious. Their beef fajita tacos are pretty amazing. Always a line which is a testament to the yumminess...
Rosita's al Pastor,71,Al Pastor tacos were pretty disappointing given that this is their signature. We also ordered a chicken quesadilla and the chicken was bland and not seasoned. The horchata was good  that was the only good thing we ordered from here.  I was surprised how many people were there  but it must be because of cheap prices and not necessarily because the food is good  we were fooled by the lines.
Rosita's al Pastor,72,Amazing food with great service  No complaints at all and I ve been here quite a few times.
Rosita's al Pastor,73,My all time favorite. I love this place  The best carne asada tacos  the pastor is also amazing but I m more of a carne asada girl. The aguas frescas are so refreshing  If you re in town for the weekend and looking for some good authentic Mexican street tacos and want to stay central  I recommend this gem
Rosita's al Pastor,74,Too greasy and they always ask for a tip at the window.  No bueno.   It s too awkward and the food is mediocre after 4 times here
Rosita's al Pastor,75,You know a taco place is authentic when none of the customers are speaking English. These tacos are super delicious  and cheap  . Get the Al Pastor tacos - after all  it s in their name. The pork was so juicy and flavorful  and you can see it roasting on a spit in the truck. In fact  the food was so good I forgot to take pictures of it  whoops .   I ve been craving good Al Pastor ever since I came here  but I haven t found any that lived up to this food truck s. Next time I go to Austin  I m going straight here.
Rosita's al Pastor,76,Tacos were decent but not blown away. Also I did not see the trompo  seems the meat is cooked on the griddle.  Salsas could be better and have more heat
Rosita's al Pastor,77,This food truck was awesome  I got the breakfast tacos with chorizo and egg and potato. fire. the wait was quick even with 5 people ahead of me and the salsa verde was perfectly spicy. also you can tell the flour tortillas are homemade. so good. come eat here 
Rosita's al Pastor,78,Rositas Al Pastor is a delicious place and they have the best Al Pastor tacos I have ever eaten    They re next level 
Rosita's al Pastor,79,Margarita was not mixed at all.  Tripas taco was super dry. I had to wait forever for my food. Would never recommend this place to someone else
Rosita's al Pastor,80,Excellent lunch  Tacos pastor with a Mexican coke  Can t beat it.   Definitely will return
Rosita's al Pastor,81,This place is sooo good and it s a really hidden food truck you wouldn t think about checking out if someone didn t tell you to. The tacos are very cheap  2and very authentic. You can tell how authentic this place is by the vibes and this place passed the authentic vibe check. The most noticeable thing about the tacos are the tortillas. They have a rougher and more hard texture that flour tortillas typically don t have. I enjoyed it but if you want softer tortillas then you might not enjoy these tacos as much. But the onions  cilantro  lime  and salsa were all present and make the taco worth trying regardless of a harder tortilla. The al pastor meat was good and flavorful. I don t have any complaints about it and it was super tasty. The horchata  which isn t listed on the menu  was  3.5 for a large. And it was large indeed. It s much bigger than other horchatas I ve had and has a strange aftertaste I can t describe. I love horchata so it takes a lot for me to dislike a horchata. This horchata definitely was worthy of being drank by me. The tacos are cheap and tasty and I would come back again. Only thing is they only have outdoor seating and the flies will bombard you as you eat. -mark the reviewer
Rosita's al Pastor,82,Excellent work of customer service food always fresh. There was one time when they forgot a couple of tacos on my order but besides that good taste in food.
Rosita's al Pastor,83,Great al pastor tacos and chicken quesadilla  Green salsa is a must  Most authentic tacos I ve tasted since coming from Chicago  Menu a bit confusing with photos  long wait times but worth the wait for them delicious tacos 
Rosita's al Pastor,84,Unfortunately  it s not the same anymore. The Al pastor didn t have that same taste. I also tried their queso birria taco and was disappointed almost disgusted. I bit into something round and hard.
Rosita's al Pastor,85,I was excited to try this place seeing as there was a long line early in the morning  In my opinion  this is a very promising sign.   This is a modest food truck with some communal benches under a tarp to protect from the elements. They serve all kinds of breakfast burritos but with a name like Al Pastor  you ve gotta order the namesake.  The meat was a little too lean for my taste but was very flavorful. They let you choose between flour or corn tortillas and the filling is ample   Service was on the slow side but the food is pretty good  Not the best tacos I ve ever had but definitely worth a try.
Rosita's al Pastor,86,Man it was good try it out mane quit playing it s a safe bet if your visiting the food was really good and it wasn t really greasy like other places so quit playing pull up
Rosita's al Pastor,87,Incredible authentic tacos.  We had the pastor  barbacoa  and fish tacos with a side of chips and salsa and guacamole. They did mess up the order and give us plain chicken instead of pastor. They were a little dull.  That s why 4 instead of 5 stars . I would definitely go back and recommend.
Rosita's al Pastor,88,Actually THE PERFECT breakfast taco. From the slightly crispy tortilla to the choose your own fillings  I went with the bacon  egg  and avocado  - this is everything a breakfast taco should be. Very simple  not too heavy large  and comes with delicious salsas. I enjoyed the breakfast tacos over the Al Pastor  and I recommend getting it with avocado - the most ideal way to start off your morning.
Rosita's al Pastor,89,Another FORMER Austin-Staple that has found itself the victim of  feeling itself  too much. Where to begin   Rosita s Al Pastor used to be a food truck with fresh ingredients served at excellent low prices. With Gentrification making its presence known in South Austin  it s clear that the evolution of Way Down South Austin has ate Rosita s Al Pastor. Rude servers and cooks who won t even acknowledge you inside their truck. These people are angry all the time and will not give you any sauce for your tacos if they can get away with it. It is unfortunate that Rosita s gets more business and treats customers as second-class citizens  especially when they confront the staff with issues arising. I have personally witnessed the  Rosita  herself yell and scream at customers for even questioning the notion that they have made a mistake on their food.  Not only that  but Rosita s has unfortunately raised their prices by 20  across the board when compared to 3 years ago. All this is just to say  Do you really want to go eat from a Food Truck that has over-priced  flavorless tacos  they don t care about cooking them anymore  that are served to you with disdain  If so then come on down to Rosita s. The food truck has sold-out to gentrification and it s lackluster service  food  and atmosphere has become engrained in Riverside.  When you get yelled at for raising the issue of a missing taco  don t say I didn t warn you. Bye-bye Rosita s  I ll be making sure TexasMonthly s column reveals who you really are as a restaurant. BONUS  Don t come here for the clout or what your friends told you  this restaurant is a shell of its former self. San Antonio remains the greatest city in the Lone Star State to get Cheap  high-quality tacos from food trucks and restaurants alike. Not here in South Austin Riverside Rosita s
Rosita's al Pastor,90,Simply the best Al pastor tacos in austin. An original. People of all kinds come here to eat them 
Rosita's al Pastor,91,Tacos were good some were a bit dry and lacked flavor. horchata was decent. overall authentic and yummy but not the best in austin
Rosita's al Pastor,92,Meh. Underwhelmed. I found the flavor to be dull  the experience was more exciting than the flavor.
Rosita's al Pastor,93,My hubby s BFF brought us here for dinner last night. When we came to Texas to visit we told our friend we wanted Mexican food. In Florida  you can get some good Mexican but it s no where close to the Mexican food you can find here. I ordered the chicken fajita tacos and my husband the barbacoa. Both were amazing. I loved how they give verde salsa without having to ask. And let me tell you it had a kick. I loved it. I can t wait to come back again.
Rosita's al Pastor,94,Really great breakfast taco with bacon  potatoes  and egg. The eggs are delicious and the potatoes have a slight crisp to them. Bacon is finely chopped so you get bacon in every bite  Yum. The flour tortilla was a little thick for my preference and was a little dry but good overall.  Service was quick and to the point but still friendly which is awesome 
Rosita's al Pastor,95,Al Pastor was the only good news in Yelping in otherwise a very sad week.  I keep a list of places I want to review.  This week  the top four places on my list had all closed down.  I have never had four dead restaurants in one week since I started Yelping.         However  you would never you would never know that these were restaurant hard times if you hung out at Rosita s Al Pastor.  The crowds are all heading to Rosita s Al Pastor.  The restaurant is selling tacos and tortas like there is no tomorrow.  Maybe there really is no tomorrow.    But if this was really your last night on the planet - you could do a lot worse than Rosita s Torta Cubana for your final meal.        Rosita s is a marvelous case of a clever restaurant entrepreneur refusing to let herself be defeated by coronavirus.   Rosita s under normal conditions is a brick and mortar establishment.  The brick and mortar establishments on Riverside Drive are a ghost town.  Dark windows  chairs upside down on tables and general desolation everywhere.  There are only two signs of life on the street.  Cane s Chicken Fingers has nine thousand million cars waiting to order through the drive-through window.   Why Oh Lord Why    The other bright shining star is Rosita s.  Long before COVID-19 was a thing  the owner saw that the future was food trucks.   She went out and got not just one  not two but three count them three food trucks.  She stacked them against each other - with one truck for immediate front line operations and the other two for back-up functions such as food storage.  She then built a huge tarp which she put in front of the front truck so everyone could wait in line social distancing with no one having to roast in the sun.  She put the whole construction out in the MIDDLE of a giant parking lot so breezes could blow under the tarp from all four directions.  So when Coronavirus turned into a reality - Rosita s was prepared - and made in the shade.  She had room for social distancing and an outdoor space with winds that blew away people s germs.  All she had to do was set up a mask-mandatory rule in front of the ordering windows and she was good to go.  She then made sure the food served out of that triple truck is pretty good.  The result is armies of customers.   Virtue rewarded.   And her customers generally behave themselves and social distance.          Never mind the Al Pastor in the name. Here sandwich and taco fillings are the name of the game.  I think there was more Al Pastor in the brick and mortar restaurant.   I had the Torta Cubano.  Torta Cubano is generally an insane dish no matter where you order it.  A Mexican Torta Cubano is an order out to the cook.  Be Crazy.  Put Random Ingredients Together and Have a Good Time.  Generally  some sort of milanesa is a required ingredient.  After that  Buena Suerte  Charlie   Rosita s Torta Cubano tosses a boiled hot dog on top of the milanesa  sliced in half the long way to cover double the area.  Then ham  bean  cheese  avocado  and two different salsas  red and green which you add yourself.  Both salsas are excellent and both add a kick.  The dominant experience is the hot dog.  This reviewer loves hot dogs.  This reviewer has never met a Mexican hot dog he has not loved.  Put one in a nutso-patootey sandwich   And you have this reviewer s lasting adoration  gratitude and loyalty.  I also ordered chips and queso.  The chips and queso were standard issue  And the whole package was way too much food.  Samuel C s Guide for Good Living   When it comes to food   Too much is just right.  I was a happy guy.         And note all of these good things occurred with me having to take my sandwich and queso on a drive home in a paper bag. They had to wait a long time until I could warm them up in the microwave.  If I had eaten the torta and queso right out there in the parking lot  they would have been a helluva lot better than they already were.        Overall Rosita s is a good place -  And an exemplar of how to keep the good life of restauranting alive and well during the plague year.  Rosita gets my Yelp Hero award for doing the right thing.  Are hot dogs on top of milanesa the right thing to do   You  Yelp Reader  have to decide that for yourself.
Rosita's al Pastor,96,Hand made tortillas  tacos were hardy. Small location  server was not very welcoming. Food was worth it.
Rosita's al Pastor,97,I haven t been to Rosita s since they moved to the current location  but they were definitely a go-to for solid street tacos when I lived in the area. They set the standard for what a flour tortilla should be. 100  recommend
Rosita's al Pastor,98,110  hands down off the scale best Mexican authentic tacos in Austin. My family has been coming here since the early 90 s. Their flavor can t be found anywhere. I am so happy seeing them prosper and seeing them grow over the decades. You will never regret eating at Rosita s.
Rosita's al Pastor,99,I don t know if they were just having an off day or what but I got two al pastor tacos and they were TRASH  the meat was cold and tough  my cheese wouldn t even melt. I ll probably go with one of the other taco trucks or restaurants in the area next time
Rosita's al Pastor,100,Review stars based on food   One of the best taco trucks I ve been to.  Quick service  even if the line to order seems long.   Someone will come take your order  while you re standing in line  parking lot  so take a look at the menu before going. You will take the order to the truck window and pay at that time.   Other notes   They do have 2 picnic benches under a tent  but does not seem anyone cleans in between and there are no available wipes to do so.   Parking is not difficult to find because it s a shared lot with other places.   They take credit card and cash.
Rosita's al Pastor,101,I give it a 1 this time because they put really small amount out of barbacoa and the flour tortilla breaks easily since they don t cook it well  amp  they gave me 2 napkins only when I brought my family of 4  amp  I went there at 10 20PM June 1  amp  the cashier was really rude  amp  was giving me attitude when I was literally being nice with her but i usually go in the morning  and they do it way better then the night people  
Rosita's al Pastor,102,Rosita s Al Pastor is both a restaurant off E. Riverside with a taco truck  and arguably more popular  taco truck situated in the very front end of the parking lot.  The staff is efficient and friendly and the tacos are reasonably priced at  2 -  2.50 per taco. I m usually a flour tortilla guy  but their corn is great - definitely worth trying out even if you typically lean flour.  Tacos I was fortunate enough to try were the Al Pastor  Barbacoa  and Carne Guisada. Would call them 4-star tacos all around  and that s based on the relatively high taco standards that Austin has to bring.  Worth a stop if you re close to this side of town and it s a nice day outside  since the patio is only partially covered .
Rosita's al Pastor,103,I love the food here  been eating here for years. but was ordering today and saw this huge roach on the wall.
Rosita's al Pastor,104,These tacos will lift you off your feet.  I am known as the Pastor Papi in Austin  TX  and though I do not live there anymore  I was on the search to find the best Al Pastor tacos. I miss these most probably.
Rosita's al Pastor,105,Simply the best tacos in Austin  and may likely be the best tacos you ever have. I m gonna keep it short  get the al pastor tacos and some queso  don t be afraid to spend extra for meat . You ll be coming here a lot.
Rosita's al Pastor,106,I m usually all about the corn tortillas but they make their flour ones by hand and they are gooooood.  After a side by side the flour tortilla was definitely the winner.   Get the flour tortilla with cheese  melty  oozy  crispy  and Al pastor.  You re welcome.
Rosita's al Pastor,107,I got five different tacos and thought they were just OK. Carnitas  chorizo  pastor  pig ear and something else. Not much really stood out. The ingredients were fresh  lots of cilantro and onions  good horchata. I d say the chorizo was my favorite but overall I didn t think the meat had much flavor  and some of it was a little dry. Also wasn t thrilled with the homeless vagrants that try to harass you for money at the outdoor tables while you eat  one insisted on sitting across from me. We talked about how terrible NYC was.
Rosita's al Pastor,108,Al pastor is one of my favorite taco spots in town. I genuinely believe they make the best al pastor in austin. The al pastor is made on a trompo and they usually serve their tacos without pineapple but charge extra if you want it. I also love their campechano taco with steak and pastor meat served on a griddle cheese tortilla. The tacos are also super cheap and cost about 2 dollars a piece. I recommend getting the corn tortillas 
Rosita's al Pastor,109,Line was long at 1am on a Saturday night so you know it has to be good  Only cash is accepted so you know it has to be legitimate. Prices are great and menu is simple. Almost everyone here was a local and the primary language spoken was Spanish. Love the authenticity    We stumbled upon this joint after finishing up a concert at near by Emo s and it was by far the best food we had all weekend.  2 al pastor tacos on corn - the all time classic  Fresh pork  cilantro  raw onions  all over a street-style corn tortilla with a dab of green hot sauce on top. Pure heaven   What more could you ask for than an authentic Mexican taco off the beaten path in Austin. Following our meal  our Uber driver said he s driven many people from Mexico who claim that Rosita s is the closest thing you can get to Mexican  You will not be disappointed by quality  portion size  or value. Would go back over and over  and will be the first place I go next time I m in the area.
Rosita's al Pastor,110,Pretty disappointed with my visit to Rosita s Al Pastor  but maybe it s my fault. I guess there s a food truck  too  but I went to the restaurant part instead. I grabbed a lunch special for around  7 or  8 and though it was a lot of food  I didn t really enjoy it. The free chips were good  but the enchiladas and hard shell beef taco was nothing special.
Rosita's al Pastor,111,They shorted by order.  I got home and discovered half my order was missing   Make sure you check your order before leaving  they can t be trusted.
Rosita's al Pastor,112,I m making a habit of hitting two or three taco shops every time I come into Austin  and I decided to hit both El Taquito and Rosita s Al Pastor to see if either could dethrone my reigning champion Granny s Tacos. In conclusion if you don t want to read further  Rosita s Al Pastor was better than El Taquito  but it didn t quite compete with Granny s.  Star 1  How were the service and atmosphere   Rosita s is a classic taco truck through and through  but I appreciated that they had covered seating that was complemented by fast and friendly service. Star.   Star 2  How were the portions relative to the cost   At  1.75 each  Rosita s tacos are priced competitively to the surrounding area  and the size of the tacos made this a pretty good deal in the value department.   Stars 3 and 4  How was the food   You often find in Austin that a taco shop will do either traditional or breakfast tacos really well  but they can t necessarily pull off both. That was certainly not the case at Rosita s  where both the chorizo breakfast taco and the pastor traditional taco were fantastic. The tortillas were fresh and fluffy and came together with two wonderful salsa options  but it was the meats that really impressed. Two Stars.  Star 5  Would you eat here every day if you could   Rosita s isn t quite as good as Granny s  but in my mind they best their closest competitor El Taquito. No Star.
Rosita's al Pastor,113,Visiting Austin and was told we must try a breakfast taco. After reading several reviews and list to try  we ended up going to Rosita s Al Pastor. Wow we could eat here every day  the food was delicious. The flour tortillas was fresh  thick and perfection.
Rosita's al Pastor,114,We saw Rosita s Al Pastor featured on the Bon Appetite s breakfast taco tour.   I was so excited for the breakfast tacos and al pastor I couldn t stop thinking about them all week  Overall  they didn t disappoint.   The highlights from Rosita s Al Pastor for me were the flour tortillas and the horchata. These were the best flour tortillas I ve had given that they were hand-rolled and pressed. They were super fresh  flaky  and worth every carb. The horchata was surprisingly SO good. It wasn t overly sweet or watery but had a really nice balance of spice.   We had the potato and egg breakfast tacos. I m not fully versed on the Austin breakfast taco scene  but the eggs were delightfully scrambled--cooked just right  fluffy  and flavorful.   The al pastor was solid but didn t live up to the hype for me. I also would have like cilantro and onion on all of the tacos  but they only put it on one taco and neglected them when I added avocado.   The prices at Rosita s are very reasonable. There are several picnic style benches to eat.  Rosita s Al Pastor is worth the trip  Happy taco eating.
Rosita's al Pastor,115,Came here on a Saturday night.. man is this place poppin  You pull into the parking lot and you can smell all the goodness. There s a good amount of benches and tables for you to enjoy your tacos right after you get them.   We waited in line for about 5 mins  someone took our order while we were in line. We got a chicken fajita taco   2.50  and 2 al pastor tacos   1.75 each . The chicken fajita taco has beans and cheese and lettuce on it as opposed to the traditional al pastor tacos which just had onions and cilantro. We chose to get both on flour..... ugh I know I know corn is always the way to go but this girl can t say no to some homemade flour tortillas- they were good. The tacos also came with red and green hot sauce- man are they spicy.. just what you hope for when you re eating some street tacos    It took a little while to get the food  but it was busy and we could see about 8 employees hustling in the food truck to get all the orders done. To my surprise they took credit card- WIN    If you re in austin and are wanting authentic tacos  swing by 
Rosita's al Pastor,116,Got the al pastor tacos and salsa chips. Most tacos are  2-3-ish  and soooooo good. Definitely a little bit of a wait but so worth it 
Rosita's al Pastor,117,Came here from the recommendation of a friend who told me this place had his favorite lunch dinner tacos. Currently the restaurant isn t open  but the food truck  located in the same parking lot as the restaurant  is. They were very busy on a Sunday around 2pm  A few people were already waiting for their order when I arrived. After looking at the menu I decided to get 2 chicken fajita tacos  1 breakfast taco  with beans and potato   1 chicken chalupa  and chips and queso. I waited over 25 minutes for my food which  to me  is a pretty long wait as I saw people who ordered after me get their orders first.  Took the food home and it was easily enough to feed 2-3 people. The flour tortillas were very thick which can be a hit or miss depending on how you like them. The chicken fajita tacos were great  Loved how the chicken was seasoned. The chicken chalupa was my favorite and is what I would recommend. The breakfast taco was alright--nothing I would order again as it had no flavor. The chips and queso were a hit  It s a simple queso but is so rich and creamy. Definitely order some to share. Lastly  I was looking forward to the salsas you can get on the side  salsa verde and salsa roja   but the consistency was very thin almost like water.   Overall  this place had great tacos and queso. Would come here again for lunch 
Rosita's al Pastor,118,Best Al Pastor gringas in town and we ve tried a lot of places.  Tortilla s and salsa are also amazing.  We ve made the drive across town lots of times.
Rosita's al Pastor,119,They are ok  not OMG i will drive to Austin to have some  Just looking for some tacos that will wow me. But if your hungry and and are in Austin these are great 
Rosita's al Pastor,120,I ordered 4 tacos they gave me 3 salsas and lime so I asked for more and they charged me for the lime and salsa.  The night shift employees are so rude.
Rosita's al Pastor,121,I was at the drive thru at 2 45. And by the time we were next in to order it was 3 09 and I was told they were closed. I tried explaining I was in line 15 minutes before 3 00 p.m. I was told they put up cones  the girl had literally just put them. They declined to take my order. I will be taking my money else where. They should work on their customer service.
Rosita's al Pastor,122,3.5 stars   FOOD   I had al pastor  barbacoa  tripa  and breakfast tacos so far. They give you large quantity of meat especially for both barbarcoa and al pastor. Barbarcoa is not seasoned  so  definitely add salt to it. For Al Pastor  definitely add its salsa sauce. Tripa....was my favorite and favorite compared to any taco places so far. Lastly  breakfast tacos was MEH. I heard Rosita s has the highest rating for breakfast tacos  however  not for me.  ATMOSPHERE   It is random and kinda sketchy to be eating here.   SERVICE   Nothing to complain about.  SURROUNDINGS   IDK.
Rosita's al Pastor,123,Everything is good  except the chips and queso but it s not really that kind of spot . The flour tortillas are made daily and are perfect vessels for all the greasy  juicy  generous meat portions. The corn come in doubles  as they always should  and soaks up all the good stuff. The carnitas always have the perfect amount of flavor and salt  same with barbacoa. My husband really likes the fajitas. We tried the gringa for the first time today and its going to be a solid on all orders going forward. We have had the breakfast tacos and they are ok but just nothing special.   I would have added a photo but we dove in immediately.   Pro tip  call ahead to order. This place is always busy.
Rosita's al Pastor,124,To quote the great Jim Ross from the 90s WWF era  bah gawd  Good gawd almighty    Best tacos I ve ever eaten in my life. I m about as gringo as you can get  but dammit I know a good taco. The al pastor is absolutely perfect. Freshly shaved from the vertical roaster with a great ancho coloring and a nice char with onions and cilantro. Add pineapple if you want  gives it a nice added flavor. The flour tortillas are homemade and I m pretty sure are made with the happiest tears of angels. Also - don t sleep on the barbacoa - an underrated offering.  tl dr  just do the damn thing and eat the best pastor tacos in ATX.
Rosita's al Pastor,125,did a taco road trip out of Dallas and hit up 4 stops and this was the last and the best place we hit   as you can see in the pic they are making the tortillas by hand on site  I ordered up a few with the wife and the size and flavor was good  the tortillas were warm  and the salsa was nice If you are in town stop by and get a few   if you do not like it so what you are out a few bucks who cares
Rosita's al Pastor,126,My profile says I m from Michigan  but believe you me  I am a Texas native and I know breakfast tacos   These are THE BEST   And why eat at a restaurant when you can eat at a food truck   The price is right and the tacos  any and all  are delicious.  Just pick one   They can add and combine ingredients to suite your taste  just let them know what you want.  You may have to wait a few minutes on a busy day  but it s worth it.  Don t take them home.  Eat them on the spot.  You deserve immediate gratification 
Rosita's al Pastor,127,I love tacos and I wish taco Tuesday was everyday  but not here at Rosita s Al Pastor.  I ordered the barbacoa and pastor tacos with cilantro  onions  and lime. Both tacos were really disappointing and lacking any flavor. It didn t seem like there was any seasoning whatsoever. The only good thing about the barbacoa was that it was moist and not dried out. The pastor was really dry and really burnt at some parts but they did give a lot of meat. The meat tasted like it was made a couple of days before and reheated. The pastor was not consistent throughout the taco  and overall was really disappointing. The salsa that came with the chips were way more flavorful than the tacos that I ate and I would have preferred to eat the chips.   Overall  I would definitely not recommend this place and would not come back here again. I definitely have had better tacos elsewhere.
Rosita's al Pastor,128,Sooooooo good. Arguably the best pastor here in Austin. I got the regular torta with al pastor and an al pastor corn taco with extras  pineapple  cilantro  etc. .   The torta was really good. Surprisingly I wasn t  so full  but it s definitely enough for one person. If you are extra hungry  like I am  the taco is enough to last you till dinner      The one thing about the torta is I wish they put butter on the bread to make it extra unhealthy for my liking.   The taco was good  but they only use 1 corn tortilla so it was a bit greasy. I m used to California style where they give you two tortillas. Regardless great taco and packed with meat.    I think next time I ll get the torta with extras on it. Can t have al pastor without pineapple in my opinion.
Rosita's al Pastor,129,I haven t had authentic Al Pastor since like 2013 when I lived in Chicago. I figured if there was a place to have it  Texas is it. After a lot of research and talking to locals- EVERYONE said this was the place to go. And they are so right. There s a restaurant in the strip mall behind their truck which is situated in the parking lot. The menu at the truck is a little truncated but why would you want anything else   They have tortas and gorditas and a few other things. The truck has an awning and a few patio tables.    2 taco on flour or corn. We went 5 corn  5 flour and 2 glass bottles of 500ml Coke. The tacos are REALLY generous with huge chunks of meat. It is tender and the perfect consistency with little surprise crunchies here and there from the slowwwww cooking method. They are QUICK. It took less than 10 minutes and cost us about  28. Worth it. Corn tortillas allow for a meatier bite but the flour tortillas are where it s at. I m pretty sure they re homemade. Soft  flavorful  super delicious  and a little crunchy. Just perfect. If you re visiting Austin you HAVE to make it part of your trip. If you live in near Austin  I m jealous. I would eat there every weekend if I could. GO THERE NOW   
Rosita's al Pastor,130,I ve been to Al Pastor twice now  amp  I have to say the food is no bueno  amp  no thanks.  On my most recent visit to Al Pastor I ordered chicken tacos  amp  they were very bland  no flavor at all and I NEED flavor in my life    And helpful tip they only serve beer  no other alcoholic drinks...         Sorry Al Pastor but I think we need to see other people..it s me not you.   ..no really..its me.   Rebecca out
Rosita's al Pastor,131,Wow this area looked a bit sketch but I will travel nearly anywhere for good food.  I love al pastor and order it often but these were dry but looked marinated well..i almost thought they added food coloring. Flavor wise  not a favorite. The corn tortillas do not look homemade but were pliable. The flour was really unappealing. They were a bit thick and tasted dry as if there wasnt enough lard. I tried beef fajita too and that was worse. It was underseasoned. Not returning.
Rosita's al Pastor,132,With all the breakfast tacos in Austin you shouldn t be serving yours on hard and stale flour tortillas. Shame on you.
Rosita's al Pastor,133,Best al pastor you ll ever eat. And tacos are only  2 each    This is an awesome little food truck and the service was pretty quick. It was quite busy but that s how you know this place is good.  The things that make this place awesome are the facts that 1  they make their flour tortillas by hand here  so they come out super fluffy  which I think is pretty unique of several taco joints  2  they stuff your tacos with  so  much protein. You get  2 worth of al pastor and then some. The meat is spiced so well  it s addicting. 3  The salsas your tacos come with are 10 10.  I wish they could relocate to Houston but I think their tires are melted into the ground of the parking lot they sit in.  Parking situation  on-site
Rosita's al Pastor,134,I ordered breakfast tacos on Postmates. I ordered 3 bacon and egg tacos for my boyfriend and 2 bacon sausage potato and cheese tacos. I specifically said no egg. We got our tacos and all of them had egg so I couldn t eat anything. Very disappointed. My boyfriend said the tacos were good so that s why they have 2 stars instead of 1.
Rosita's al Pastor,135,The worst place ever took these dumbass people 2 hours to make 2 quesadillas just to tell me it will be done in 5 mins they just kept telling me 5 mins and for what to have some soggy ass quesadillas that aren t worth shit. Over priced typical Mexican food truck. If I could rate negative starts I would
Rosita's al Pastor,136,Reliably great tacos at a fair price. Bang for buck  dollar for dollar one of the best meals in the city.    I m hard pressed to order anything other than Al Pastor on corn as this is one of the few places I have found that does a decent job with this old standard.  If you re a flour tortilla kind of person  they are homemade here. You ll be pleased.  Like cheese in your tacos  Go with a gringa  al pastor   cheese  or suizo  steak and cheese .   Not in a taco mood  Get your favorite combo in sammich  torta  gordita  chalupa or  flauta form. Miss ALF  Get him in pog form.  Breakfast tacos  as expected  are great here. With everything else they do well  why wouldn t they be   Highly recommend the food truck over the restaurant as it s been more consistent  in my experience.   While you will absolutely find  better   more refined food elsewhere  this place shines in its real as  street food . In that lane  it sits at or near the top. Again  bang for buck  you d be hard pressed to find a better value.  Oh - have to mention  Their online ordering is far better than you d expect for a food truck. One of the best interfaces for ANY restaurant I ve ordered from  regardless of price. Extra star for that 
Rosita's al Pastor,137,i heard they re moving locations but best place to get tacos. what more do you need to read from a review 
Rosita's al Pastor,138,Yummy tacos  and the horchata is muy bueno   The customer service is ok  I usually go for the pastor or barbacoa. Also  yes  I added cheese  
Rosita's al Pastor,139, Rosita s Al Pastor   Rating  4 5   We ordered    Suiza Gordita. Cheese hardened  meat good  pastry was delish  but not true Gordita in that I believe it is supposed to be more of a pocket  not an open sandwich.   Torta Combinada  Chicken Fajita   Barbacoa  was amazing. Bread fresh and fluffy. Avocado melted in  chicken was a little dry but that barbacoa made up for it  flavorful  moist  add some salsa  awesome    Lengua Taco had some of the best lengua I have had  Mexican style . Tender  soft  light but tasty.   Tripas Taco was honestly not very good  maybe should have asked for options because they were definitely too crispy to actually chew through and had an overly strong piquancy.   4x Al Pastor Tacos  which is what they are known for  of course. And they deserve it. The slices were actually rather thick and fat which I did not expect  but held that smoky meaty flavor in wonderfully.   Corn Tortillas were darn good. They know what they are doing.   Flour Tortillas were alright. Supposedly homemade  but ours were not as fluffy nor tasty as would be expected.   Aguas Frescas  Horchata  amp  Tamarindo  were both fresh and refreshing    Always a line  we were lucky to get there when it was rather short. Understandable why  though  Plus  it moves along rather quickly  Only complaint is that klutz that I am  my horchata magically spilled all over the table. When I went to grab a towel to clean it up  I asked if they could give me a new one by any chance. I was told no  unless I paid for another one. Everyone unfortunately saw it spill  so it was not like I made it up. Regardless  I feel like it would have been nice for them to replace it. Yes  my fault. But I guess that is not included in their definition for customer service  Or maybe they are so popular they feel it is not necessary for them  Alas  I suppose I cannot really hold it against them. Or can I 
Rosita's al Pastor,140,Im not usually a fan of Chorizo. Between the texture of the meat and the typical saltiness of it...I can usually pass.   But Rosita has changed my perception with their chorizo and eggs breakfast taco. The two are married in matrimony and the crisp of the corn tortilla is seals the deal.   Austin Breakfast Taco Approved   
Rosita's al Pastor,141,After a long morning of kayaking  my friends and I were craving tacos. Rosita s Al Pastor truck is parked in a huge shopping center  you shouldn t have an issue finding parking. I ordered two Pastor Tacos with avocado  this truck is known for its pastor tacos so I just had to give it a try.   The menu says that the pork is marinated for 24 hours. The tacos were decent  but at  1.75 a taco  plus  0.25 for the avocado I added  it was a super cheap and tasty bite to eat. My biggest gripe was that the pork was really dry  it definitely helped that I added avocado and lime. For sauces  you can choose between Salsa Verde and Salsa Roja. I picked the Salsa Verde because it has less fire symbols on the menu  I wanted to enjoy my tacos not have my mouth on fire from spice  P  Overall  you get what you pay for... if you are looking for a cheap  quick bite to fulfill your taco cravings I would recommend this food truck. It has been in business since 1985 apparently so they are definitely doing something right   
Rosita's al Pastor,142,A fun food truck in the middle of a shopping plaza.  The staff was blasting music and I couldn t help but shake my hips while waiting for my tacos and chips salsa.  I had the quesadilla al pastor and it was so good I almost ate the paper.  Wife ordered the Lengua  tongue  taco and that was just disappointing.  It was really bland and dry  we doused it in sauce to eat it.  Other than that mishap  a fun place to hangout and eat.
Rosita's al Pastor,143,These guys and ladies know how to make a damn good taco  Been coming here for years. My favorite is the fajita and the pastor. The tortillas are literally the best. I love the fajita tacos because the meat is so tender and flavorful and they put beans on the bottom so everything stays in the tortilla. The al pastor tacos are just full of sooo much flavor  omgggg.. give it a try if you haven t already  This place is usually busy  so expect a line.. but it s most definitely worth the wait. Go ahead and get a Coca Cola in a bottle while your at it  your belly will be thanking you later for such a delicious meal.   Oh  Pro Tip  If you like a good spice  definitely get the Green salsa     Be prepared  it s Cash only  
Rosita's al Pastor,144,Food greatest   waitresses attentive  Salsa not water down I got the Migas  were the best . They offer vegan  You  don t have to have the beans I got rice which was hot.  Most restaurants I go to the rice is cold. Having cucumber water  outside the restaurant they have street tacos. When they close you can t miss it on Riverside Till 3 AM prepare for a line. Clean bathrooms saying a lot. Almost like being on on the border of EL Paso  Not over priced  Came in on a good day 
Rosita's al Pastor,145,best chorizo and egg   bacon and egg breakfast taco I ve ever had  tortillas are amazing best al pastor tacos I ve ever had  go here for these    tacos     their migas are good  but veracruz does migas better. their sausage and egg is good  but I ve had better.  torchies and tacodeli are so bad in comparison. i miss the good old torchies days before the growth. go to rositas al pastor for authentic  fresh  and delicious
Rosita's al Pastor,146,Ummm YES  You need to eat here if you are ever in Austin.   El Pastor is so good  and the fresh house made flour tortillas were magical. I m usually a corn tortilla all the way girl. But how could I pass on a homemade flour tortilla  I m not that kind of girl.   I also had the chorizo and egg breakfast taco. Yumm     All I can say here is the tacos at Rositas are made the way God intended. 1  the perfect tortilla 2  meat 3  cilantro and onion.   There are no bastardized ingredients like rice and beans on my taco    I would definitely be a regular if I lived here.
Rosita's al Pastor,147,My first experience at Rosita s Al Pastor was terrible  so it will be my last. 1st  they forgot half our order  which we didn t realize until we got home. It wasn t a long drive  but I wished they had checked our order against the ticket we gave back to them. 2nd  the beef fajita tacos on corn tortilla was soggy and the meat was bland. 3rd  I wanted to try a smaller portion of the menudo  which they could have scooped into a smaller container. They refused  despite the fact that they would have made more money with the smaller portion. It was incredibly disappointing.  There are plenty of wonderful  family owned taco trucks in Austin. I would not recommend Al Pastor to anyone.
Rosita's al Pastor,148,I was excited  but it turned out that the al pastor was dry  and the pineapples were dry. The lengua failed to be seasoned right  and the tripas were unfortunately overcooked to where it tired my mouth to chew because it was too chewy. They re supposed to be crispy  but tender  not crispy and too chewy hard. Idk if today was a bad day  but man  I heard a lot of good things about this place.
Rosita's al Pastor,149,The food was bland they say they marinate for 24 hours but it had no taste first taco truck where I had to put salt on my tacos which is a first for me . The tacos I had were al pastor and asada
Rosita's al Pastor,150,I went here for the first time per a friend s recommendation. I ordered the al pastor tacos with pineapple added and a large horchata. The horchata was massive which was an added bonus to how good it tasted. The tacos were b o m b and the salsa verde added a nice kick. Parking was good as it s located in a large parking lot lol. The service was great  very friendly and the food was prepared QUICK Seating was somewhat limited But who cares  I would have happily enjoyed my food even if I had to stand.  I m def going back when I m in the area again 
Rosita's al Pastor,151,I KNOW authentic Mexican food when I see it and this is THE spot. The meat is prepared in-house and the flour tortillas are made by hand. No BS here - just good ol Al Pastor tacos. They re so good  Very filling and really affordable too. Y all got to check this spot out 
Rosita's al Pastor,152,Huge line  not sure what the hype was about. It was just okay. Had pastor tacos and a torta. Had better elsewhere.
Rosita's al Pastor,153,This may be the best flour tortillas I ve ever had   We ordered from the food truck  set up in this strip mall parking lot. There was a line  but it moved quickly. They also have a covered area with some tables.  The breakfast tacos were exceptional. We tried the bacon  egg  cheese  amp  potato and with a little of their green salsa  this was the perfect breakfast taco...the potato was cooked perfectly and the tacos were stuffed. Also  a Chorizo  egg and cheese  which needed no salsa.  Their picadillo taco  on two corn tortillas was one of the best I ve ever had. Their picadillo didn t have potato  but carrot  so next visit  I d add on potato  which is a personal preference  because as is  it really was wonderful    It really isn t hard to find  just a short drive off I-35.. the food truck sits close to the road  in the parking lot of the strip mall.
Rosita's al Pastor,154,Best al pastor in Austin  This place is always packed no matter what time of day it is. Their breakfast tacos are also great but I stick to the classic al pastor.
Rosita's al Pastor,155,Dishonest and delicious.  I ve been here twice now  the first time in the pouring rain for a late Saturday breakfast. I ordered a chorizo and papa taco--which I never grew up with in my Mexican household  were only recently introduced to  and am now inextricably in love with--and two potato bacon egg tacos  the  deluxe  version of a potato egg taco in the breakfast taco zeitgeist residing within my head. They messed up my order and gave me TWO chorizo and papa tacos  one of them which had no chorizo in it whatsoever  but you could see it was cooked up alongside the chorizo  since the potatoes had a rich amber tint. I didn t mind the order mistake They were delicious and even better than the singular potato bacon egg.  Incidentally I don t put cheese on breakfast tacos. That s an ultimate gringo move. I mean I guess you can do it if you don t have enough fat in the skillet-fried buttered potatoes  fried bacon  fried eggs  and masa d up tortilla. Its up to you though.  The flour tortillas are fantastic  superior to the corn and you should get them. I bet they re made right next door at the brick-and-mortar location. I also bet they re  specifically  the reason everyone thinks this place is so good  as the potato egg bacon taco was... simply serviceable.   My fiancee had an issue with how gotdang spicy the green salsa was  probably a jalapeno butter base  but I m a masochist. Delicious. Be careful if your tolerance is low.  Today I was intending to pull off the highway for Taco Bell  judge me and see if I flinch  and realized I was passing the same place  so I pulled over. Thought about getting a torta  but since the place is named Al Pastor  I ordered up two pastor tacos instead. They re  2.00 each. The person in the window charged me  4.50. When I asked her why  this is what she said    Oh  its because to-go orders are 50 cents and we wrap all the orders up as to-go and people would call in for to-go orders and not show up so we started charging 50 cents.    What you said doesn t make sense. I m standing RIGHT in front of you   I said.   On the price wall here it should say 50 cents for to-go orders.  She smiled.  Would you like me to give you your money back     No   I said.  It s fine. Its just... you should just change the price of the taco if that s what you want to charge.   She just smiled and said  on the price wall here it should say 50 cents for to-go orders somewhere.   Uh  what  This doesn t make any sense. Did management scheme a way to get a few cents off the top from the gringos  or the shift has some sort of skimming plan to make a few extra dollars at the end of the night   This is probably a 4-star place  but I can t treat it as such as long as they have this BS  illogical  catch-22 policy. Just make the pastor tacos  2.25 if you want the money. Its not about the 50 cents to me  its the principle  you know what I mean   The pastor tacos were okay by the way. A little dry  and pineapple being extra is crazy. I might come back for the breakfast.  Protip  If you are eating here  insist that you are PRESENT AND ACCOUNTED for and DINING IN and see if they still charge you 50 cents for a to-go order.
Rosita's al Pastor,156,Al pastor tacos are best eaten immediately after they re made. This means you better listen closely for your number to be called  The best thing on the menu are the al pastor tacos. The Gordita was delicious but next time I ll get pork instead of steak. Be sure to tell the staff you are eating there otherwise they ll automatically wrap it to go. I ll be back  next time for late night 
Rosita's al Pastor,157,Went inside to get a chimichanga as Yelp says they offer them. I don t know anywhere else in Austin for a chimichanga. Well  our waiter didn t even know what that was. Okay...   I got the Al Pastor tacos special  4 for  5 . While it seems like a good deal  the tacos were really really disappointing.  The Al Pastor pork was hit-or-miss  dry at its worst  tasty and flavorful at its best. And there really wasn t that much in terms of texture or ingredients in the tacos at all. Just a few things thrown in there with no thought to how they mesh together.  There was also a bit of tissue paper towel I found in one of my tacos  leftmost in the photo  near the center . Not a big deal  or even worth mentioning  except combined with the other failures  well...  I feel like these tacos are the kind of thing I d order if I was desperate for cheap-ish food. But really not worth it. Made me run to H-E-B and grab fresh corn tortillas to make my own cheaper  fresher  and tastier tacos.   I m really disappointed they didn t have chimichangas.
Rosita's al Pastor,158,A beyond fantastic meal. I had the al pastor tacos and the man I live and dine frequently with had carne guisada.    The al pastor was flavorful  fresh and delicious  served on fantastic homemade tortillas. His carne g  and he s an something of an afficiando  was basically the gastronomic equivalent of laying your bare skin on luscious velvet. Just a buttery  saucy meat extravaganza.  Some months back I had an crappy and disappointing meal at Matt s El Rancho  and I ve lived in the Midwest  so I m accustomed to subpar Mexican food . When the partner and I left that terrible establishment  I quipped   I want Mexican food that is the exact opposite of that.   Al Pastor is that restaurant  the exact opposite of Matt s El Rancho gimmicky  dog trash disaster food.  The rice and beans at El Pastor weren t just delicious. They were stunning  particularly the beans.  How often in life can a person expect to be stunned by beans    Thank you El Pastor  I ll be back tomorrow for breakfast  and possibly later today for dinner  if I can talk my partner into it.  Matt s El Rachero can continue to fuck itself.
Rosita's al Pastor,159,Price is fantastic  but no way should this be up there with best tacos in Austin.  Tortilla fine but nothing too extremely tasty.  Corn tortilla falls apart but expected when it gets moist with salsa.  Pastor  supposedly the specialty  was a bit dry and though had a nice marbling didn t add any flavor you couldn t get similar across town.  Migas quite large but very average with shredded cheese on top that made it appear unappetizing.  Very good to taste  but presentation could ve used some work.  Prices are great with most between  2-3  and tacos are fine  but nothing came out of my meal to offer a recommendation.
Rosita's al Pastor,160,This has been on my to go list for quite some time and I finally convinced my friends to go get some real mexican food for lunch  so we took the short drive over to Riverside to get some tacos. They re the way tacos should be - cheap  not overly stuffed with odd hipster ingredients but just down to earth and simple to let the flavors shine through.  I got 3 al pastor and a barbacoa on flour and all were great. The tortillas are fresh and a bit on the denser side  but it helps it to absorb all the juices and grease from the meat. The Al Pastor is flavorful which is the namesake  but a little on the dry side for me today  but was digging the meat. The barbacoa is very juicy and a flavor bomb  so highly recommend that.  All in all great Mexican food at great prices. Just know that you ll likely want a nap afterwards...
Rosita's al Pastor,161,Long line  Tripa was burnt  Chicharron was to slimy  Beef Fajita s were more like beef roast and dry. Tacos were lined with retried beans...did not expect  ask or want beans on my tacos. Tortillas were...different  didn t add to experience. My family and I will not be returning.
Rosita's al Pastor,162,Must be the best on East Riverside. I always go al pastor. Lately  been adding a side of beans and rice. Perfect meal.
Rosita's al Pastor,163,Damn these tacos are so good. Al pastor is the best. I m normally all about the flour but corn is best for these ones.   I ve gotten the gringa and a few others but basically my go to is 2-3 al pastor tacos on corn for the rest of my life.   The wait can be super long but trust me it s worth it.
Rosita's al Pastor,164,I have been going to this restaurant for years and the 1st time that I get the worst customer service and bad and burned food. I spoke with owner she just said oh well just return it. Yea I guess she s not worried about it ... I believe if I would of told Jackie she would be on them quick. Well it s worthless now  I m not returning their ever the quality and taste are different from back days. If you know Mexican food then you know what I mean.  This is sad.  I don t recommend this place to anyone at all anymore  Pictures are down below just to prove to you what they are serving NOW
Rosita's al Pastor,165,I seriously got a taco shell with nothing in it. I know this place gets great reviews  but they don t really care. Catch them at the wrong time and around the wrong people  and you ll get bad food. This is just an honest review  you can have a good experience here but I feel like you can also have a really poor experience here
Rosita's al Pastor,166,Couldn t be more happy with the beef fajita tacos with beans  lettuce and tomato. Very tasty with lots of flavors. The flour tortillas are also on point.
Rosita's al Pastor,167,Breakfast chorizo tacos are bomb    Had the al pastor tacos and they were dry. So we went back the next day and gave them another try and they were much better.
Rosita's al Pastor,168,Went to rositas the other day for the first time  it was Saturday . Super busy  so i d plan in some waiting time. The al pastor is great  Flavorful  nicely seasoned and perfectly grilled. My other 2 tacos were carnitas  unfortunately those were super fatty  not very flavorful  and literally had huge chunks of just wobbly fat in there that weren t enjoyable or edible. That was the only disappointment.  Other than that  their corn tortillas are SO good  I really liked them. They re salsas are fine  nothing crazy special  but not bad. Would go again  this time I d stick to the al pastor 
Rosita's al Pastor,169,Last weekend  I went in a taco weekend. What that means is that every meal  from Saturday morning till Sunday night is a taco of some sort. Well  Rosita s was on the list that weekend.  The food truck is located in front of a place called Al Pastor  I was really confused by that . Outdoor seating  right next to the street. And it s super cheap. One dude must have ordered 12 tacos and was surprised his bill cost less than  20.  I got the tripe  al pastor  and something else but I can t remember. The tripe taco was delicious. When I say delicious  I mean it. The flavor  fat  and taste of the tripe was super well done. Really enjoyed that taco. I actually took a bite  saved the rest to eat it last. The other tacos were good  but nothing amazing.  The people are friendly enough. Not much of an interaction with them except from ordering.  All in all  good place to get cheap food and decent tasting tacos  with so far the exception of tripe .
Rosita's al Pastor,170,As told by their staff   they do better with their tacos  so don t order anything else. Don t come too late at night either because you ll get more grease than meat.
Rosita's al Pastor,171,What s austin without tacos  This is a nice spot. Food truck with an extended shaded area to eat. Tacos were cheap and hit the spot. Recommend eating at least 3. If I had to rate my three from lowest to highest  it d be pastor  barbacoa  then believe it or not  the lengua. Straight fuego . Shout out to Rosita. Thanks t a
Rosita's al Pastor,172,Best tacos in Austin   Love this place so much and super cheap   Ordered the Gringa which were to die for   Sit down at the restaurant so you can get free chips
Rosita's al Pastor,173,Closest pastor  or trompo  tacos to where I was born and raised  Monterrey  Mexico  but they are amazing still    I really wish they hired security or something  there were homeless guys harassing us outside the taco truck and I have been there before when people got in huge fights late at night on the weekends... Just don t go too late on weekends  the tacos are amazing  go get some 
Rosita's al Pastor,174,Was good   But I can t go back to a place that charges nearly 10  for 2 tiny little bean and cheese tacos and a coke. I never been so hungry after easing couple tacos 
Rosita's al Pastor,175,Amazing  Truly a hole in the wall food truck but the food was delicious. Shocking how good a simple egg and chorizo breakfast taco can be. The taco al pastor is also incredible. Friends really enjoyed the machacado taco as well. The horchata was delicious if a little too sweet. Would highly recommend
Rosita's al Pastor,176,U can t beat the price for the quality they serve here. Hands down the beat al pastor tacos i ve had in texas fr just 2 bucks. Make sure to add pineapples to the al pastor tacos. Staff is amazing and quick in service.
Rosita's al Pastor,177,I ordered 4 Tacos Al Pastor  they were so damn good I had to order 3 more. Leaving this lovely taco truck parking lot in awe  Thank you Rositas for this affordable delicious taco of my hearts desire  I look forward to coming back and spreading the word.
Rosita's al Pastor,178,This was quite disappointing. My husband and I are trying many taco places around Austin for the month of March  what we call March Taco Madness   and this place was on our list. I would not recommend Rositas and I usually love all tacos. The flavor was really lacking. I got the Picadillo and the Al Pastor. The picadillo was so bland. The al pastor is what they re known for. It s the only reason why this place didn t get a one star from me - the al pastor was good but I ve easily had better. Our friends got the veggie tacos and they didnt like it either
Rosita's al Pastor,179,As if I needed a five-star taco place that accepts online orders and has a mobile app. ARGH   But it s so delicious. The corn tortillas do not break apart like others  so no need to double up on them. Refried beans are perfect consistency for tacos and well-flavored. I wake up every day now thinking   Should I eat this English muffin or send my husband to Rosita s   It s a serious problem. Rosita s is one of the very few true Tex-Mex joints I ve discovered here.  The horchata is not overly sweet and really completes a breakfast taco meal. I look forward to a rare morning where I feel energized enough to go out to breakfast  because the huevos rancheros are very enticing.
Rosita's al Pastor,180,Stopped here for a late lunch. Heard the AL pastor was legit so had to try for myself. It is in a parking lot with a large bingo hall  they still have those  . Not sure what difference is between their store front and the truck  but I ate at the truck. Ordered 2 all pastor on corn tortilla and 1 beef fajita on flour. The beef fajita was on a crispy tortilla with onions and lettuce that was great. The album pastor came with warm corn tortillas  cilantro and onions. Had one with and one without the lime. My suggestion is use the lime that soaks into the cilantro. These items don t need salsa  but I put a little of the Roja on them to add a little more kick. This place is worth a stop by  but it does take 10-15 minutes to cook.
Rosita's al Pastor,181,The food is delicious  and the service is super friendly  quick to acknowledge and attentive. We got two helpings of fresh chips and three salsas.  The prices are reasonable.   The restaurant is very clean and the staff are staying busy as customers leave they clean up quickly. They wipe the tables AND booths down  our tables was cleaned twice . It s evident the people that work here and the owner care about what they re doing.  It s a happy environment.    In Spanish their work shirts say  full tummy  happy heart.   We will definitely be back.
Rosita's al Pastor,182,I ve been coming here for years and feel guilty for not reviewing them sooner. After having just suffered through a lunch at Gabriela s yesterday and their poor excuse for Al Pastor they serve I decided it was time.   First off  the tortillas here are incredible. They are not those tortillas that come out of a bag and served uncooked and soft with some meat on them. These are damn good tortillas  The pastor is very good with pineapple chunks and cilantro  onions  and lime on the side and for such an incredible price they really are hard to beat. Service is always great. You can tell they appreciate your business there.
Rosita's al Pastor,183,Place was delicious   Definitely recommend   The sodas nice and fresh   Pastor was amazing    I had a torta de lengua and 1 taco al pastor.
Rosita's al Pastor,184,Read very good reviews about this place and stopped by on impulse since we happened to be driving by. We had lunch already  so we just ordered al pastor torta and al pastor gordita to go for an afternoon snack. The total cost was less than  10  but the torta  and gordita were big.  There were good amount of well seasoned pork cubes in both items. We squeezed on some lime juice from the lime wedge that came with the foods and ate them up within 5 minutes. Four stars for now until we can come back for a proper sit down meal.
Rosita's al Pastor,185,I don t even live in Austin and I ve already gone here twice  It is the only spot I go to when I am in ATX   It s on point everytime  
Rosita's al Pastor,186,Searched the internet for best breakfast tacos in Austin. This was on everyones list and the only one open on the holiday. A little out of the city and a bit confusing they have a cart and a store front. We went to the store front. I am not sure if this is related because what we had was nothing special.
Rosita's al Pastor,187,Fantastic al pastor tacos. Below average breakfast tacos. Takes credit card.   A simple review for a simple taco joint.
Rosita's al Pastor,188,Wow  I have no idea what people see in this place. I ve had a lot of Al Pastor tacos in my day ranging from good to exceptional and the ones here are very likely the worst I ve come across. This place is super popular too as there was a long line when we came here to check them out. I don t know  I wish everyone success in their positive endeavors  that includes Rosita s Al Pastor. Personally  I just think that as far as Al Pastor tacos go  this is a very poor example.
Rosita's al Pastor,189,A while back I went on a road trip  seeing as we left Dallas around 8 30ish in the morning we didn t have time to eat breakfast  so naturally by the time we got to Austin it was already past 11. So obviously we were all a little hungry and decided to go to Rosita s Al Pastor Restaurant  The indoor section of the restaurant  I have never been so pleased with a restaurants service the way I was with them  they were so attentive and so polite.  Fun Tip - If you enjoy Horchata you will fall head over heels with theirs  it s very sweet that you might become just as sweet.
Rosita's al Pastor,190,12 out of 10. The HANDS down best tacos in Austin. Don t mess with this place. Breakfast tacos  damn. Al pastor tacos  damn. Margarita size  DAMN.
Rosita's al Pastor,191,Came from Dallas for a girls weekend in Austin and we had this place for lunch. Definitely worth the wait. Going back for breakfast  I got the pastor tacos  if u live here or passing thru definitely give it a try  
Rosita's al Pastor,192,If you re gonna put it on your sign  it better be legit. And friends  Rosita s al pastor tacos are  indeed legit. In fact  everything is. They have DELICIOUS aguas frescas  excellent salsa  red was mild enough for my daughter and green was strong enough to make me cry   and their barbacoa and lingua were perfect. But the best  by far  was the tacos al pastor. I was afraid I d never find tacos that good outside of Mexico. But find them I did. And you can too at Rositas.
Rosita's al Pastor,193,Dude  My friend and I were visiting Austin and walked by this place and we re hungry so we tried it. Best idea ever     The tortillas were all handmade. The Carne was delicious. And The price is right  Only complaint we had and didn t give it a 5 star rating was their salsa. It was a weird green creamy type of salsa that tasted hot but the flavor was off. However....still pretty damn good for a taco trailer place
Rosita's al Pastor,194,Amazing food  taste like Abuela s cooking. This is a must have if you are passing by or visiting Austin. Best bang for your buck. We had a breakfast taco  al pastor and carnitas tacos. All were 5 star worthy. Well marinated al pastor. Juicy mouth watering carnitas.
Rosita's al Pastor,195,The employees here are top notch  Not to mention the tacos    I start with the employees because this place is literally open until 3 am weeknights  and the people work long shifts and still do their best to smile. The flour handmade tortillas are fantastic and I always try to get a gringa taco since the al pastor is soooo good. The lines are there for a reason and this foodtruck has it right. Give this place a try  
Rosita's al Pastor,196,This place came highly recommended  so I had to check it out. We went to the restaurant  rather than the food truck  and it s a bit of a hole in the wall. But  super friendly service and everything was delicious  I loved the salsa that came out with the chips. I got the al pastor dinner  which was very flavorful and a generous portion. My partner got the chicken quesadillas  which were stuffed full of chicken and cheese and exceptionally delicious.   We also got margaritas  which were standard blended  but this place is clearly more about the food than the beverages. I will definitely be back for tacos and recommend this as a place to stop 
Rosita's al Pastor,197,I ve been craving Al pastor ever since I ve been in Austin. Something about that rotating cone of meat makes me think that it s going to be one of the most delicious items in the world. Sadly  a place that names itself after this iconic Mexican dish failed to entice my palate.   I got three tacos Al pastor on corn tortillas  but I believe that they make fresh flour tortillas  which is kind of ironic because corn tortillas are more traditional and the ones I got seemed store-bought. Anyways  the meat itself was underwhelming. It didn t have that much flavor in it compared to other places where I ve had Al pastor. I still think Burrito Factory El Primo  owned by the same people  have the best pastor in Austin. If I come back here  I m going to try the other dishes that they offer  but I would definitely pass on the Al pastor here.
Rosita's al Pastor,198,Get the Campechana and Gringo tocos    WOW  Wish I would have found this place a little sooner  Vary good 
Rosita's al Pastor,199,Best Tacos in the city  Been coming to this place since I was 17. Pastor tacos are the bomb  Get that green salsa yo  Never really cared to eat inside  eat outside.Lol
Rosita's al Pastor,200,I got 3 al pastor tacos and a barbacoa taco  and they were very good  I also got the horchata and that tasted amazing as well.  Would definitely recommend since these were the best tacos I ve had in a very long time.
Rosita's al Pastor,201,This is an updated review  I stopped by the trailer  I like it better than the restaurant   and ordered 2 Al Pastor and 1 Chichirrone tacos. I was scrambling like crazy transporting people  recording equipment and slipped out for an bit to get something to eat. Wet tables   no hay problema. Ordered from the friendly people and the trailer I love that I long have considered to have the best Al Pastor tacos in Austin. I wrapped up 1 Al Pastor to carry for emergencies  and ate the other 2 tacos. For once  the Al Pastor disappointed. They were still great  and I will be back  but it was not up to their usual standards in my humble opinion. The spices seemed much milder  it was too dry  and I had to pile on the hot sauce. I am a fan of this place and will be back and also eat at the restaurant. Note to those who travel to Mexico City. These are close  but not the same as the ones in Mexico City that you find with street vendors. I am sure it is due to health regulations and the FDA  War on Food that Tastes Good .  Do not hesitate to give this a try. It is definitely worth the money. It could have been an off day. Potential for me to send those stars to 4 or 5 is high   - 
Rosita's al Pastor,202,I don t get the hype at all. I went to the truck and got 3 of their namesake al pastor tacos. They were quite dry and definitely didn t live up to the hype. On the plus side  it s a cheap place to eat. Also tried my sister s barbacoa taco which lacked flavor  so I m not sure I ll be coming back her to try anything else.
Rosita's al Pastor,203,ITS SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD   I always get the al pastor  it s the best best best in Austin. The meat is flavored right and their tortillas have really great texture.  However tho  I think they have A team and B team. The B team people messed up my order every time they are working.. the girl taking order usually don t come to the window unless I knock on the window  even then she will look at me surprisingly like I interrupted her phone business.  The A team people are so nice  the girl is always super helpful and introduce me to different drinks.  I go there literally every other day cuz it s so good hehe.
Rosita's al Pastor,204,I don t know if I d say this a 4 cause the tortilla is so important. The flour tortilla was very thick and had almost as silly as it sounds a floury like raw flour taste. I ve had had amazing tortilla elsewhere like even a heb tortilla but this one didn t hit the mark. But I did like the salsa Roja and the pastor alongside the fresh cilantro and onion put on the tacos. I know  shockingly  there is bad Mexican options in town but I d gladly take Austin s vast food scene vs just a one dimensional food scene. This place has good service and only recommend the pastor for the meat. Wish the tortilla was better unfortunately.
Rosita's al Pastor,205,Delicious fresh food. We ordered a taco s we saw which is delicious and the Pastore tacos you can t go wrong with the menu. I prefer to take it to go due to my pickiness have a clean table. Prices are really good to
Rosita's al Pastor,206,Great late-night spot  The tacos are so so so good. I ve been here twice already and I always get the al pastor tacos with everything on it. The green salsa to the tortilla is PERFECTION. I have nothing bad to say about this place  I m going back next time I m in Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,207,Portion price and the meat quality.  This place can not be complained.  Tho I don t speak any Spanish. But their food is the most authentic one in Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,208,Pastor taco  add pineapple  amp  avocado  is my favorite taco in this country hands down. Corn tortilla better than flour  but the flavor profile is unparalleled no matter the tortilla choice.
Rosita's al Pastor,209,I know this is a food truck but I have had interesting and Incredible food from a food truck. This was my first visit so I may be being a little harsh but the food was terrible. Very disappointed
Rosita's al Pastor,210,This taco truck beats all the taco trucks in Austin  Their flour tortilla is always fresh and they always give you large amounts of filling. I love tacos and this taco truck kills the game. If you go during their lunch rush or dinner rush  the line will be pretty long. It s so worth the wait though  Even during their busiest hours  their food comes out quick and hot  It s no wonder they ve been in business for 32 years.   They also have tortas  chalupas  and other items on their menu. Check them out if you want great tacos for a low price 
Rosita's al Pastor,211,If you live in southeast you know this is the place to go. Drunks and second shift hospitality workers keep this place busy all night long. Can t go wrong with the pastor tacos.
Rosita's al Pastor,212,Just like their name  they get quite a lot of love for their tacos al pastor and we just had to go check them out yesterday evening.  So this is the low down   1.  There are a few spots to sit and eat right outside of the food truck  but most everyone took it to-go  we did as well.  If you do eat outside  it s your average picnic tables that could probably use some updating.  The one we sat at while waiting for our food rocked back and forth  p  2.  The have quite a varied menu and bottled beverages as well as aguas frescas  I opted for the bottled coke and it was a huge 1 liter bottle we could have shared  but oh well.  3.  We ordered all of our tacos on corn tortillas and they re delicious and grilled before dressing them up with the yummiest meat I ve had on a taco in a long time.  The trim it nice too  so you re not getting chunks of fat which I hate   4.  They are each a good portion  probably the size of my palm  but they re also less than  2.00 each  so you can splurge   The only bad thing I can say is that while they weren t rude  they weren t nice either. More just dismissive  like the people that call your number out at the DMV  know what I mean   So if they can just smile  maybe thank you for coming  something like that would go a long way.  Still  the tacos ruled 
Rosita's al Pastor,213,Tacos are tasty  but I asked for the Machacado Taco  eggs and barbacoa  in a cup with no tortilla. The young woman taking my order said   I can t do that   I said   or on a plate   and she said   my boss won t allow that . I asked   even if someone is allergic to corn and wheat  your boss makes you put the tortilla on a person s food   and she said   yes    it is because of portion control . I suggested that they try using a ladle to measure  so people with allergies are not forced to have a tortilla for their measurement purposes .
Rosita's al Pastor,214,The Migas tacos were so so good  Would definitely recommend them. This was our first stop on a taco day trip and they were definitely some of the best we had 
Rosita's al Pastor,215,Super disappointed as we drove 40 plus minutes for this place just to get super dried out 6 al pastor tacos. Maybe they were having a bad day  The meat looked like leftovers shredded mess... not just one or two of the tacos but all six of them. we didn t get a single chunk of sliced meat which you would usually get when you get it from the trompo. The only thing that was good was the corn tortillas and the green salsa. We might have gotten a bad batch but this place is definitely on my worst tacos list as of now. Also the lady just flat out asks you if you want to tip when you pay by card.
Rosita's al Pastor,216,I m new to Austin but I ve been going here nearly weekly since coming here. The pastor tacos are incredible and unique. Everything else I ve had lives up to the high standards their signature taco sets.  Favorite food truck.
Rosita's al Pastor,217,I was craving some al pastor tacos and what better place to get some than Al Pastor   So  we fought rush hour traffic just to come try this food truck on Riverside. Here s another obvious question for you  What did we get  Al Pastor Tacos. Add the pineapple. Delicious  You can t beat these tacos. The sauce also added some delicious spice.  My only complaint was there were bees flying all over the tables and around the truck. They landed in our food several times and seemed especially attracted to my green water bottle. It made a pretty funny sight  three girls running around trying to avoid bees  all while still trying to shove tacos in their mouths. I m not really sure how you prevent bee accumulation but it definitely would ve improved the outdoor dining experience.  So  my advice  get the Al Pastor Tacos and get them to-go.
Rosita's al Pastor,218,What can I say... one of the best taco truck in ATX   tortillas de harina  are hand made  I recommend the campechana tacos hands down  which is a combination of two meats pastor and cecina with cheese  I also love the lengua tacos  al pastor tacos and tripas tacos   How can you tell is one of the best taco trucks in Austin  There s always a line  but worth the wait and the trip 
Rosita's al Pastor,219,Rosita s was a go to of mine when I lived down the road from it.  Great prices and hefty portions that won t leave you hungry.  While I did really enjoy this place  the long wait due to being so popular is only thing keeping it from 5 stars for me.  Besides that it is still worth the visit if in Austin
Rosita's al Pastor,220,It was alright. I had the egg and cheese flour taco with grilled onions. Friendly staff and cozy.
Rosita's al Pastor,221,This is my favorite taco spot in Austin  The truck stays open super late  and the tacos are great. I get the barbacoa tacos with the verde sauce almost every time. It s amazing.
Rosita's al Pastor,222,Some really awesome al pastor tacos. But if you re going on the weekend  be ready to wait for a while. Over all the tacos are delicious  the Gorditas are not deep fried which I prefer but they are delicious too. And the Horchata is soooo yummy too.
Rosita's al Pastor,223,Al pastor and Suiza tacos are a must  hand made tortillas and all natural Aguas Frescas I get melon or pina 
Rosita's al Pastor,224,Tacos are pretty big by  taco truck  standards. They serve their tacos on full size  or close to it  tortillas. The flour tortillas are fluffy and homemade too  Grabbed some champurrada while there and it hit the spot on this cold weather day. We ll be back 
Rosita's al Pastor,225,Best breakfast tacos in Austin. Hands down. I ve tried about 30 different places and this tops the list. Tortillas are handmade minutes before ordering. Flavors are amazing  fresh and authentic.
Rosita's al Pastor,226,During my search of the best breakfast taco I was referred to this place. I got the bean and egg and it was great  only complaint I d have was that they were pretty tiny.
Rosita's al Pastor,227,Had Al Pastor at Rosita s  so I went back and saw that this place was open and opted to check it out based on all great reviews.  They did not disappoint.    The 5 for  5 Al Pastor deal is during the week  Mon to Thurs   otherwise it s 3 for  4.99 any other time.  The chips were nice and light  they have 2 salsas   the red is spicy as heck and tasted great  the green is also hot and has a tomatillo aftertaste - it was very good.  I prefer the red over the green - barely.   The Al Pastors were awesome - flavorful  lots of cilantro and onions  and choose your tortilla   flour or corn.  What puts this place over the top is that it s really clean  and the bathrooms are so clean that you d actually had to consider going  2 if you had to  rather than holding on until you got home .  Dunno if I d eat Al Pastor off of the floor but it s one of the cleanest bathrooms I ve ever been in.   I m an Al Pastor fan - gonna hit them up during the week for that 5 for  5 special  or if I need to use the bathroom for a lengthy period of time.
Rosita's al Pastor,228,Yummmmmmmmmm  I let the cashier order for me since I was having a hard time deciding what to order and she did a great job  I got 3 tacos for less than  8. My favorite was the one she said was  their specialty  it had melted cheese on a fried-like tortilla. I don t remember what it was called but it was absolute HEAVEN. Great flavors in everything.  Every time I drive by there are people in line. They re really quick though and I hardly had to wait for my order so don t let that scare you away. I can t wait to come back.
Rosita's al Pastor,229,Hands down best Al Pastor tacos. Try the corn tortilla. It s basically plyable like a tortilla but has crunch of an actual chip. I will absolutely be back  
Rosita's al Pastor,230,Honestly my favorite quick breakfast bite. Can t go wrong with the truck or the store itself  Have ordered for larger groups with ease  it s one of the first places I take out of towners. So happy they re open and doing well during covid.
Rosita's al Pastor,231,I stopped here after a friend s recommendation  and I ve been back several times. I like asking for no raw onion. This is a food truck in a very large parking lot so there s never any issues with parking. It s nice to have that in Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,232,Very good stop for tacos. Al pastor is their specialty and it shows. Stop by and get an horchata with them. Fair pricing too only  2 for the al pastor.
Rosita's al Pastor,233,Yes  Yes  Yes   I so wanted an authentic street taco experience while I was visiting here in Austin and this spot did not disappoint - thank you Yelp    Coming out of downtown  you find yourself in a part of town that seems to have seen better days - although the Starbucks and Chipotle across the street are signs that things may be a changing once again.  After you pass by the 4th check cashing place  you come upon a plaza that features the La Rumba Disco and the American Bingo parlor as its anchor tenants.  Like an oasis in the desert  a glorious run down trailer sits in the parking lot with cheap plastic tables and glorious  glorious pork.  The billboards are in Spanish  the customers only speak Spanish  and the signs on the trailer are written in Spanish.  But delicious is a great word in any language   I stepped up and ordered two Al Pastor tacos - one corn and one flour.  The Al Pastor had a nice spice to it and the tortillas were awesome.  The onion  lime  and cilantro were all fresh and crunchy.    The trailer also serves breakfast.    I know taco stand trailers are a dime a dozen in many neighborhoods.  However  for its proximity to downtown and its deliciousness  this one deserves your business 
Rosita's al Pastor,234,Best tacos in all Austin. I wouldn t be surprised if they later became the greatest in all Texas.
Rosita's al Pastor,235,Though the shop on the outside looks slightly unappetizing the result from the helpful staff  and bar none one of the best tacos I ve ever had made me put Rosita s al Pastor at the top of my Austin taqueria list  I had a chorizo and egg  and bacon  egg  and cheese  10 10 would recommend 
Rosita's al Pastor,236,It was only after I opened my mind to the experience that is Rosita s was I able to fully understand myself as a person and carry on with the confidence that I have today. Thank you Rosita s  you re al pastor has given me strength.
Rosita's al Pastor,237,I asked for shrimp fajitas and they said they couldn t make it........weird I ve never been to a Mexican restaurant that couldn t serve shrimp fajitas. I even asked if they have shrimp and I was told  yes we just can t make that ......again  just weird.
Rosita's al Pastor,238,Favorite taco spot in Austin. Their al pastor are unlike any other taco I ve ever had. Hands down best al pastor in Austin area. Fresh handmade tortillas. Barbacoa is also delicious. Very simple  done very well.
Rosita's al Pastor,239,Best Pastor tacos in town. Friendly service. The line tends to get long on the weekend late at night after the bars close  but it s worth the wait. The restaurant that is in the shopping center right behind the trailer  which surprisingly a lot of people don t even know about  is great for calling orders in for breakfast tacos. They have fresh salsa in the restaurant that they don t keep at the trailer as well that is sooo good 
Rosita's al Pastor,240,I ve never gone inside - I always go to the truck  but  name a more iconic al pastor taco.  I love the taco campechano too
Rosita's al Pastor,241,Visited a Saturday around noon  lots of people there so we had to wait a little while for our order. Tried the pastor  chicken fajita  beef fajita  and carnitas tacos on corn tortilla. Highlights were the pastor and carnitas   Good prices  great flavor 
Rosita's al Pastor,242,I lived in this part of E. Oltorf Riverside area for 7 years and only now I got around to coming to this place. It s always crowded and maybe that s what put me off going to this place. I went there after a friend of mine who used to live in that area told me about this place and recommended it to me. Then one day after a run  I decided to come here. You know what  I couldn t believe I didn t come to this place earlier and more often. Their Al Pastor tacos are great. I ve had Al Pastor tacos and they were meh. But these were great. Their is a wait for the food and make sure after you order you keep your ticket  it is what the sign says . There s plenty of parking since it s located in a parking lot of the Bingo place.
Rosita's al Pastor,243,In a taco town like Austin it can take a lot to really stand out. Rositas has that. Affordable  delicious and great service. The restaurant is busy during lunch hours and the truck is crazy busy at night. The flour tortillas are handmade  the breakfast tacos are delicious and the al pastor is obviously the thing to get. I tried enchiladas once  and they were alright. Honestly I think of Rositas as more of a taco spot. I also wouldn t waste the time or money on the queso. Tacos  tacos and more tacos  Add this one to the list 
Rosita's al Pastor,244,Some of the best Mexican restaurants in Austin are the few that are posted up in strip malls. They are often flared with mirror doors and windows  amp  are so obscure enough to where you are unsure if you really are at Rosita s Al Pastor or not  they don t have a sign overhead .   Please  do yourself a favor and come here at breakfast hours if you plan on sitting and enjoying your al pastor  seasoned pork meat that is grilled to perfection . If you come after lunch time or at night  enjoy the food truck outside  owned by the same folks  that have fresh and hot al pastor tacos on the cheap   Most of the employees are now accustomed to speaking English to their customers if you do not know Spanish. This means the clientele is changing  respectfully so  and you will be sure to have a choice of an English or Spanish menu.  I suggest ANYTHING and everything with al pastor. Flip that menu because Rosita s has taken every item on their menu that has their signature al pastor and placed it on the back side of the menu for easy browsing and deciding. I love the huevos al pastor plate with crispy breakfast potatoes and charro beans for  6  Such a great deal.  Take a look around at the other folks eating here - you will feel right at home. So many good people come all around Austin to have some really good al pastor.
Rosita's al Pastor,245,I eat here at least once a week.  Here are the things to know    Anything with Al Pastor is going to be good.  The quesadillas are especially good.   If you go for the taco s  get the 3 for  5  not the 5 for  5 weekday special.  The difference - the 3-taco plate uses home-made taco s - not the store bought.  Although not on the menu  you can also get pineapple or avocado on your taco s for an extra charge.   Check out the daily specials.  Always a deal and they include tea.  Chicken Mole special on Friday    The guacamole is fantastic.   Ask for the special green sauce.  It s basically pureed jalapeno s.  Every now and then you get a fatty piece of pork in your taco - don t diss them with a negative review.  For as much Al Pastor as they serve  as many as as I ve eaten and as few of those pieces as I ve occasionally gotten - I recommend you discretely put it on the side of your plate.   and enjoy the rest of your meal 
Rosita's al Pastor,246,1.75 al pastor tacos.  What else do you need 
Rosita's al Pastor,247,THE BEST DAMN TACOS IN AUSTIN  Go to East Riverside  find Rositas  you cant miss it  look for the huge crowd in front of a taco truck near in a shopping center. You can get the Al Pastor and never go wrong with that  but I always get that Campechana fam. TRUST ME  The truck is legendary and even at 3am you can get tacos and they always take care of us who work in the nightlife industry. Much love 
Rosita's al Pastor,248,This was our last food stop in Austin  Texas before my girlfriend and I departed on our road trip  We wanted some authentic Mexican food and this place did not disappoint.   I ordered a barbacoa taco  a carne guisada  beef stew  taco and the torta suiza. The barbacoa was tender  juicy and flavorful along with the carne guisada. The melted cheese on the torta suiza s was delightful along with the perfectly cooked peppers  onions and fajita meat.   My girlfriend ordered the chicken tortilla soup  the al pastor taco  and the chorizo potato taco. I kept stealing her spoon because that soup broth is so  so good  I was jealous that I didn t order my own chicken tortilla soup 
Rosita's al Pastor,249,Pescatarian reviewer here. Only have tried their breakfast tacos  both potato and egg and nopales and egg. But best breakfast taco I ve tried in Austin thus far. I would like to come back to try their seafood but am a little hesitant to veer off course after trying the tacos. There s always a line so take this into consideration if you re trying to go for dinner. With that said  they work through the crowd fairly quick. Love that I live within walking distance. Have been every Sunday since my first go. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for some quick tacos to go 
Rosita's al Pastor,250,Came to check this out after MotoGP at COTA and the tacos were damn good    The pastor tacos are no joke. I would come back here again for sure.
Rosita's al Pastor,251,I absolutely love Rositas  If you re looking for authentic Mexican tacos in the Austin area  this is the place to go. Only downside is most of the time you will encounter a long line and somewhat of a wait time to get your food but for me it s always been worth it  They have a wide selection of taco options and tortas and gorditas 
Rosita's al Pastor,252,Coming from a paisa these tacos are really good they are everything a taco from a food truck should be good and simple.Its also in a pretty good spot close to downtown Austin.i would recommend this spot to all my homies.
Rosita's al Pastor,253,This was pretty bad. We went on Labor Day and I got al pastor tacos  carne Guisada  Barbacoa and chorizo and egg.   The flour tortillas were stiff and chewy  the al pastor was like jerky. The Barbacoa was ok because the moisture from the Barbacoa softened the tortilla. Same with the Guisada.  We went thinking it would be good because of the reviews  but we were severely disappointed.
Rosita's al Pastor,254,As others have noted  this place is held in pretty high regard. I of course got 3 Al pastor tacos. Huge letdown. Polite and prompt service but there was no flavor to be had here. Another disappointment here in Cooltown.
Rosita's al Pastor,255,For my taco truck and salsa verde enthusiasts- DO IT. Located right inside the shopping center parking lot that boasts a night club and bingo hall  there is plenty of parking. Food wise it is pretty good and I enjoyed every bite of my beef fajita gordita. Rules are pretty simple  queue up and order at the truck  wait for your number to be called and eat on site on the picnic tables or take it to go. The later it gets the longer the line.
Rosita's al Pastor,256,I can t wait to come back to Rosita s  I ordered two al pastor tacos. They came out immediately with deliciously thin chips and the best salsa I ve had in Austin yet  The tacos were piled high with onion and cilantro and came with a fat lime wedge on the side and the pastor was just perfect. I noticed they have a truck at the front of the parking lot  too. So far  these might be the tacos to beat for me. I ll definitely be back soon 
Rosita's al Pastor,257,I struck breakfast GOLD when I walked into Rosita s Al Pastor    Rosita s is situated in a sketchy shopping strip but early morning was nothing to worry about. The restaurant is very clean and everyone is extremely pleasant and willing to explain or recommend items on the menu. Also  I loved that that they had Fuse TV blaring all the current hip hop hits and it s a Mexican establishment...who say s you can t listen to Lil Wayne while downing some bomb tacos       I ordered my regular bacon egg and bean egg tacos with a Mexican coke and my friend went in like a boss and ordered the steak and eggs. The tortillas are super good and still had a bit of flour dust on them  the fillings were delightful and above all my eggs and bacon were MIXED. I love when restaurants take the time to actually mix the bacon and egg. The beans were SUPER great  Oh boy  my friend s steak was already chopped up and it just fell apart in your mouth. I don t know how many times I leaned over to snatch up some steak but his death stare told me to back down LOL   WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU GONNA FIND A BREAKFAST TACO IN AUSTIN FOR  1.35     GO check out Rosita s and leave with a happy stomach 
Rosita's al Pastor,258,Im Mexican and I can tell you...this place is legit. The flour tortillas are amazing.
Rosita's al Pastor,259,If you want dog food in your tacos  this is the place to go  Plus  the service is horrible and they will give you the order last if you don t tip. Go to other taco place  whatever is better than this truck.
Rosita's al Pastor,260,The best tacos I ve ever had. Price is great  flavor is great  salsa and sides great   THEY DON T MISS   
Rosita's al Pastor,261,The pastor tacos are delicious. The meat is a little bit crunchy  which I enjoy. Use the verde sauce liberally. The line is quite long for the PM  but they move quickly. Flour tortillas are made in house. One thing I can say about this place  they know their pork  Glad I stopped by.
Rosita's al Pastor,262,Fierro     The food here is absolutely delicious. You re missing out if you don t at least check it out and get some al pastor tacos 
Rosita's al Pastor,263,The food is OK... But unless you order with everything... Their tacos blow. So the listed price is just meat  lettuce  tomato. For example  I ordered a chicken fajita and it was chicken with lettuce and tomato. If you actually want what you order... You ll have to spend another dollar for the  extras .  Then there s a take out fee. All said and done it s a  3.75 taco. Only OK for that price.
Rosita's al Pastor,264,Dear Rosita   yesterday  I was in the neighborhood  and decided to grab a quick breakfast. I ordered a taco with nopales  potato  avocado  and jalape o.   I waited. and waited.   I saw a roach crawl across the floor.   twenty minutes after ordering  I got my veggie taco. I mean  it was good  Rosita  but twenty minutes  you only had two other tables  with a total of three customers. and the creepy ass critter that crawled across the dining room floor  come on now  Rosita.   what s gotten in to you  apathy  roaches  what      you make me have a sad face.   -jenny L.
Rosita's al Pastor,265,Food Truck   RUDE ASS MF BITCH   gave me beans on my tacos when I didn t want nun because beans are for the house and I wanted her to make me my tacos without beans and she told me she ll do them than I waited for them and went back to her asked her about my tacos tell me why this bitch told me she wasn t going to change me my tacos I swear I was about to slap the fuck out this bitch   Than i asked for my money back so she said I ll give you new tacos   This is - star fuck that bitch   That bitch is making that place look bad with this type of service 
Rosita's al Pastor,266,Best authentic tacos in town. Don t believe all the hype with the other places in town. Al Pastor is where it s at.   THE HOURS FOR THE FOOD TRUCK ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS POSTED HERE. They are open late night.  Go to the brick and mortar for breakfast brunch. Go to the food truck in front of the restaurant for lunch or dinner or to satisfy a late-night craving. Get the pastor taco at the food truck  meat is shaved right off the trompo   add avocado and cheese  and you can thank me later.
Rosita's al Pastor,267,Starting off with a great big jorchata. And a heeping pile of chips with a 3 oz salsa rosa and salsa verde. Salsa is decent. The chips were definatily not done in house.  I ordered al pastor tacos  2  and a barbacoa taco. Pastor was a little on the dry side but with a nice flavor none the less. The barnacoa on the other hand was juicy as can be. With the fixings. I should have got two barbacoa and one pastor.  My server was quick nice and on point. Would i refer people here. Yes great spot for the price.
Rosita's al Pastor,268,I m in love with this place  it has been my emergency go-to more than a few times  a date night spot  and has served as the occasional sober station.   I ve only come here for the Al Pastor tacos  although I ve heard the breakfast tacos are on point as well. I really appreciate their fresh tortillas and the 24hr family recipe marinated pork  for only  1.75  If you want to do it the right way  however  I suggest adding at least pi a and onions for an additional .25 each per taco. But adding cheese and avocado transforms the taco experience and I highly recommend it. I know  I too have doubted the idea  but I do not regret trying it.  They have 3 or 4 plastic picnic style tables in front of the truck. This isn t the fastest taco in town  I m glad it s not  but it s worth the wait.  The reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is because a few times they ve forgotten to add items that I was sure they charged me for. It may only be a quarter but I tend to buy in bulk so it can add up. However  they ve still got my favorite flavor so I keep coming back 
Rosita's al Pastor,269,Went there twice at food truck  their steak and al pastor tacos are soo delicious    So yes I would recommend anyone to try this place to get their delicious tacos    
Rosita's al Pastor,270,If you have not been here you are missing out   This place is always open and reasonably priced at  2 or a little under and in such a convenient location right off of E. Riverside.   Don t hesitate to stop by and get a few taco s because they are worth it 
Rosita's al Pastor,271, 1.75 per taco for authentic pastor tacos with corn tortillas that don t fall apart and salsa that packs a punch. What more can you ask for  This is a must-go spot whenever I visit Austin
Rosita's al Pastor,272,This review is for this restaurant not the truck. My tacos were taking forever even though it wasn t crowded. I went up to change it for here because I was too hungry. Turns out they forgot about my tacos and they were sitting there. No apology. I told them I ll just take them Togo since they are ready. They gave me attitude and I heard one of the girls saying I was an asshole as I left. I will seriously consider never eating here again even though the truck is good.
Rosita's al Pastor,273,If you re ever hungry and happen to be on this side of riverside you HAVE to try this place out   There s an outdoor food truck and also a restaurant just behind in the plaza 
Rosita's al Pastor,274,Pastor for the win. Late night food and plentiful food for 15 dollars. The Barbacoa is good  nice and messy. How ever please give more paper towels. Love.
Rosita's al Pastor,275,I may have a problem with this place. Amazing tacos and even though they are always pretty busy every time I go  which is a lot  it is worth the wait with a pleasant atmosphere for waiting for delicious tacos   
Rosita's al Pastor,276,Rosita s Al Pastor is a gem. All plates are served with homemade flour or corn tortillas  the different Pastor options are wonderful. The Alambre  Barbacoa and Lengua tacos are my favorites. The menudo is served with pigs feet upon request. Yum. Make sure to sample the 3 salsa options  especially the chile de arbol  I don t know another restaurant in Austin serving it. The margaritas on the rocks would be so much better if they were made with real lime juice  the Migas were a miss mushy   and the queso flameado presentation looked as though it had been mixed in a blender. Yuck. Great atmosphere  great service. This is Mexican food  if you re a fan of Chuy s  stick with Chuy s and Taco Hell. This is my favorite discovery in years.
Rosita's al Pastor,277,Wonderful food for a great price. About 3-4 times a week  my boo orders al pastor tacos with flour tortillas and avocado along with a brewed ice tea  and she s among the most selective diners I know.
Rosita's al Pastor,278,Ordered the Torta Cubana  at this truck that means all their Torta meats on one single sandwich. The bread was not quite fresh  the Melanesa was freshly fried but the other meats  and hot dog  were average.  Overall not bad  maybe the tacos are better which I ll try next time.
Rosita's al Pastor,279,Great food. They have the right cooks no matter what time or day you go. The wait is always worth it
Rosita's al Pastor,280,Love this place. Best flour tortillas and 24 hr marinated pastor meat.  1.75 ea  Fast  clean friendly service.
Rosita's al Pastor,281,My friend and I wanted to grab breakfast tacos on the way out of town the other morning. I hate how overrated tacos in general are in Austin  but especially breakfast tacos. I just don t get the hype.   But...they re handy when you re the one driving. So  we stopped at Al Pastor s taco truck. Not half bad  and 4 tacos and a large Mexi cola for  10. The potatoes and eggs in my taco were actually tasty. Best part  pretty sure they use butter. Tortilla  a suitable vehicle but nothing else.
Rosita's al Pastor,282,Hence the name..   I had the pork al Pastor which are very good. The ingredients are finely chopped including the pineapple which I like. The flour tortillas are much better quality over the corn at this place.
Rosita's al Pastor,283,My all-time fav Tex Mex restaurant    No se habla English...love everything here  it s all homemade  amp  is made from years of love.
Rosita's al Pastor,284,First off  I feel super bad for living here on Riverside for a year and a half  enjoying these tacos on a weekly  sometimes daily  basis  and yet neglecting to give these guys a shout-out on Yelp.  Homemade flour tortillas  and the best al pastor I ve had... the breakfast tacos are pretty phenomenal as well. If you want an authentic Mexican street taco experience  come here. I ve never had anything but an amazingly happy belly after eating here - and an amazingly happy wallet as well  this place gives you a great value for your   .  It s easy to overlook because it s in Riverside  in a dingy strip mall parking lot next to a Chase ATM drive-through and a bus stop. Nine times out of ten  there will be a decent-sized crowd either eating at the tables or waiting in line. Not long enough of a wait to be deterred  but long enough that you know it warrants the line. Open late as well  in the event you re coming home from the bar and need tacos. Some nights I ve seen them still going at 2AM.  Staff speaks English if you don t know Spanish. I believe there s a credit card minimum of  6 still enforced  so if you re not bringing cash keep that in mind.   I love this taco truck so much  it was actually weighed as a deciding factor of whether I would move apartments or not... I chose to stay.. ha 
Rosita's al Pastor,285,4.5 stars.  This used to be my goto place for Al Pastor tacos like the ones on the street in Tezuitlan  Mexico with friends after spending months trying as many of the taco trucks  with 4 stars or more  as I could all over the city.  But now with TacoMore up North I don t get down to Riverside as much which is a shame.  I like each with Taco More having the edge for their condiment bar of roasted jalape os  cucumbers  radishes and hot sauces.
Rosita's al Pastor,286,WOWZAAAA....Ok so I ve seen this little food truck along the road on Riverside and there is ALWAYS a line which is always a good sign. I decided to give it a try and went for their Al Pastor tacos... WOW... The AL PASTOR meat  and the fresh tortillas are to die for. Plus the prices here are one of the most reasonable I ve seen in Austin. They also accept credit cards which is a plus. Definitely a must try place when in Austin 
Rosita's al Pastor,287,It s settled  These are the best Tacos al Pastor I ve had anywhere. The meat is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The flavors are simple and powerful. The salsa is good. The staff are friendly.  Do yourself a favor and never order flour tortilla tacos again  anywhere. The corn tortillas here are crisped on the grill for a quick jab of flavor and you won t care if they fall apart because you ll be trying to lick the butcher paper clean by the end of it.   There s a reason they re famous.
Rosita's al Pastor,288,Amazing  This place has great authentic Mexican food for a great price. You can t go wrong with anything on the menu. However  the pastor tacos are their speciality. I highly recommend this place 
Rosita's al Pastor,289,My coworkers and I live for this taco truck.  This is near our office and Fri yays  are our taco days.  From the pastor  to Suiza  guisada and fajitas you can t go wrong.  Fresh daily made flour tortillas and a Mexican coke- great way to start the weekend.
Rosita's al Pastor,290,Visited here for the first time after hearing they are the number one breakfast taco Austin. I had a chorizo with potato and a migas taco and was not impressed. The migas had no flavor. The chorizo and potato was pretty good but nothing better than the other places I have visited. The service was great  Staff is very friendly which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 3. My favorite taco in Austin in still the migas with queso at the Tamale House   
Rosita's al Pastor,291,This is absolutely the best taco trailer in Austin. Their Al Pastor taco is some of the best I ve ever had. The tortillas are always fresh and hand made  and generously filled with deliciously marinaded pork  onions and cilantro. You can add pineapple if you so desire. The prices are great  service is friendly and quick. I usually stick with the Al Pastor on corn with added avocado  but the breakfast tacos are also fantastic. Don t forget to ask for their home made verde sauce  If you want authentic street tacos in Austin  look no further.
Rosita's al Pastor,292,I came here with friends for late night tacos.  I ordered in Spanish  which is how you know they re legit.  I liked them  and I was told  by a local  that it s about as good as Mexican food gets in Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,293,This is MEXICAN food  not TEX-MEX.  Thank you God.  If you want the latter  go elsewhere - don t give this low reviews because it isn t what you expected.  I don t give a south Indian restaurant low marks for a lack of meat.  It s the polar opposite of Torchy s  or Valentina s - both of which I also love.  The best breakfast tacos in Austin by a country mile.  Exotic Mexican meats  carniceria - style  try the lengua  .  Chile Relleno that s actually good.  This review is for the restaurant  but Yelp should really combine them  they re the same business.  Oh  TVs playing Spanish-language programming.  I don t understand a word of it  but it seems to be very dramatic.
Rosita's al Pastor,294,Took forever to get our order.  Tacos were small.  Not the best place to sit at eat your tacos  either.  Better off going to Veracruz on 7th.
Rosita's al Pastor,295,A review of the taco stand...great stuff. Very fast and very tasty. I chose 3 pastor tacos and washed it down with a Pepsi. That came to a little over  6 and it was worth every penny.   The tacos and toppings were fresh and delicious. The corn tortillas were definitely the way to go for this gringo.   Sure you re in a sketch parking lot  but it s fantastic. I hope to patron these guys in the near future.
Rosita's al Pastor,296,This place was alright in the beginning. I live close by so I m was going at least once a week. The tortillas always seem to be old and hard  the portion size is a joke. They mess up quit often with the orders and when you ask the ladies in the back to fix it they re super rude.
Rosita's al Pastor,297,Pretty good overall. If you ve been across the border or in the RGV or to Miami it raises the bar for taco and torta expectations. If we re comparing to Taco Bell this would easily get a 5.  On its own a 3. If you re looking for a decent lunch and happen to stumble across it will get the job done. Wouldn t recommend a special trip though.
Rosita's al Pastor,298,This local Taqueria is right near my apartment  it serves up some fantastic tacos amongst other TexMex fare. The price is right and service is fast. Although they do get busy  so you may consider calling ahead and picking up your food at the brick and mortar restaurant in the same parking lot. The food truck is nice if you want to sit outside on a nice day  but the option of a proper restaurant in the same parking lot is a nice touch.
Rosita's al Pastor,299,Best tacos in the area. I love the barbacoa tacos with onion  cilantro  and lime. The wait is worth it
Rosita's al Pastor,300,incredible tacos--recommend la lengua  pastor  barbecoa  and campechana. Salsa was pretty spicy but very tasty. Hit the spot  
Rosita's al Pastor,301,Came back and just got tacos al pastor. Much better this time  the tacos were not cold. Tortillas were still disappointing  kinda fell apart but flavor was good. I ll come back again  slightly begrudgingly...
Rosita's al Pastor,302,Riverside reviewers  y all failed me again. I really don t know where the almost five star overall is coming from for this restaurant--definitely not from the bleh salsa  thick burrito tortilla  flavorless cubed papas  which I doused in the bleh salsa to make better   lack of hot sauce and scarce melted cheese  amp  chile sauce over my Burrito Tejano. Oh  and let s not forget that this is the first restaurant that I ve been to in a while where I had to reach for the salt and pepper to season my own meat because it practically had none. I ll pick Trudy s Burrito Tejano with its crappy service over this place any day.  But I at least had to give them 2.5 stars because the service was attentive enough. They gave me everything I needed to give my meal a little kick  which made it difficult for me to give them such a sub par rating and to round down  even.   Overall  Methinks you should skip.
Rosita's al Pastor,303,Fast service  good prices and great food  Excellent service   Had a cheese enchilada and my husband a neef enchilada. Highly recommend the arconditioned compinent.
Rosita's al Pastor,304,I ended up meeting up with a friend yesterday to try another round at Al Pastor. My friend has no Mexican heritage  yet he tends to date them exclusively so I have to guess he knows what he s talking about. He ordered a lengua torta. Thats cows tongue if you don t know  authentico  He thought it was grand.  We started with their fancy queso with guac  pico  and carne. Carne being a broad term as the appetizer had some sort of ham instead of beef. It wasn t a small Bob or a Kerby  but it was tasty.   I went back for the Al Pastor tacos with the traditional raw onions and cilantro. Sadly  the meat was near incinerated. Dry  flaky  and almost not chewable. I ended up eating the tortillas and leaving the meat on the plate. In honor of my recent obsession I ordered a chicken enchilada with mole. This version proved a tad more subtle than my last encounter at Flores. It was flavorful and didn t need the giant dollop of sour cream to balance the flavors. I think that enchilada saved the star rating at this point.   Service was average until the waitress got a party of 8 and basically left us to fend for ourselves. My mouse is sliding back and forth between two and three stars. My revelation is if you name your restaurant after a menu item  you better be on your game for that item. I graded them on a overall curve last time but the majority of the Pastor meat I got at this visit was unacceptable. Good mole  decent queso  twice murdered meat  two stars.
Rosita's al Pastor,305,Easily the best breakfast tacos in town  thanks to their fresh-made flour tortillas. Delicious al pastor  too. During breakfast and lunch hours  go inside for a bigger menu and free chips  amp  salsa.
Rosita's al Pastor,306,Their tacos al pastor are a sublime combination of crispy slow-roasted pork  sprinkled with chopped white onion and cilantro  drizzled in velvety green flaming hot salsa  blanketed in warm earthy corn tortillas  and anointed with a twist of lime. The parking lot has picnic tables for your dine-in convenience  but I normally inhale these gorgeous tacos right off the paper plate as soon as they re served from the truck window. Mexican coke and an assortment of Jarritos are available for burnt-tongue first aid.
Rosita's al Pastor,307,Tacos al pastor was a little too dry for me. On the reviews the meat looks juicy wet when I had it it was pretty dry.  On top of that every topping is an additional  .25. I can understand how the avocado would be  .25 extra  but onion  .25 extra   I got a little excited when they said handmade tortillas.  Thought it was a little too much for a couple slices of onion. To say this is more like street tacos I am pretty disappointed. Maybe I ve just had too many tacos in my lifetime to say these were not that great.  I would say it s not worth the time. The flower was a little too hard for my tastes to be honest. I ended up eating the side with the meat and Terry and off most of the tortilla
Rosita's al Pastor,308,Considering it s called Rosita s Al pastor  you d be silly not to order the Al Pastor Tacos.  You can t go wrong with three Al Pastor tacos for  4.99. There s also a lunch special with 4 al pastor tacos  on corn tortillas only  for  5.  Part of the magic here is the creamy green salsa - try it - it s awesome.  I ve tried a few different items here  but now I m just ordering al pastor tacos. Do the same and you ll be happy.
Rosita's al Pastor,309,Was really excited to eat here since it was rated high on Yelp and Eater Austin. Our server was really nice and attentive. The free chips and salsa was nice but we had to leave as we waited over 40 minutes for 2 tacos  chicken flautas  and the barbaquoa plate that never came.  I paid for the sodas and left. They had several opportunities to win us back but we won t be back.  Really bad restaurant management.
Rosita's al Pastor,310,Used to LOVE this place like eat here at least once a week kind of love but in the last few years it has seriously gone down hill. The staff is rude we had stopped going because of this and thought we would give it another chance because the food was good. Today our waitress stopped in the middle of taking our order to clean a table  talk about rude . After today s experience we won t be returning
Rosita's al Pastor,311,Amazing Breakfast Tacos  Those freshly made tortillas with real fresh eggs  Made to order and they are awesome  Worth a stop 
Rosita's al Pastor,312,I ve really come to appreciate the actual restaurant. Amazing salsas  and as always great al pastor. Would recommend the al pastor dinner  or sizzlin  al pastor plate if you re going with a friend.   For both the cart and restaurant  the crispy tripas taco is worth a try as well  mmm porky.
Rosita's al Pastor,313,Stopped in today for a taco al pastor. It was pretty good  but I m not sure I d run back.
Rosita's al Pastor,314,If you ve never tried tacos al pastor this is a great place to do it.    I was born and raised in South Texas  and al pastor is my all time favorite.  Since moving to Minnesota in the late 90 s  I ve struggled to find good pastor.  So when visiting Austin a few weeks ago for a conference  I searched here for pastor.    Needless to say I was very satisfied.   The flavors were balanced  which is usually my gripe about most al pastors.    Of note  their chorizo  potato  bean and cheese was excellent as well.   This place has a ton of value for the price.
Rosita's al Pastor,315,Best comfort found I have found at 12 am in Austin yet. Will come again soon  Takes a little time but that s because its so busy 
Rosita's al Pastor,316,This is only for the inside location. The food truck outside is great however the service inside is subpar. Sat myself down and waited 10 minutes for a menu only to watch another table come in get menus and order before even taking a drink order from our party. The restaurant was not busy mind you.
Rosita's al Pastor,317,JUST YES. Been here a lot over the years. Never disappoints. El pastor tacos and horchata are the best
Rosita's al Pastor,318,Recommend you stop here and get the al pastor tacos amazing  and best you ll find anywhere.   5 stars  I ve never tried anything but the al pastor tacos.   Injoy
Rosita's al Pastor,319,I ve had tacos  particularly al pastor style  at probably 10 different food trucks or restaurants around town  and I have to say imo these are hands down - and by far - the best ones.  The pastor marinated meat is perfectly seasoned and is loaded with flavor. I get them on corn tortillas with onions  cilantro  avocado and pineapple. A little squirt of lime  the awesome green sauce and it s an amazing combination of sweet  salty with a nice crunch of the onions and pineapple. While you re at it  ask for extra lime and squeeze some into your Topo.  It s hard to order anything else once you ve had them  but the Torta Suiza and Torta Cubano are also delicious if you want to switch it up.  Be prepared to wait about 15 minutes after ordering  but it s well worth it.
Rosita's al Pastor,320,They have the most authentic Pastor tacos I have tasted in US. The Horchata water is great.  I have also had trip and barbacoa tacos. Have to go back and type more thing on their wide menu.
Rosita's al Pastor,321,GREAT. The Al Pastor tacos are to die  for  and don t forget to add pineapple  The taco truck is open late  so a big thanks to the guys that keep this place going.   It is hands down my favorite al pastor taco in Austin  and to top it off  the prices are great  I live north central  but I think its worth the drive.
Rosita's al Pastor,322,In our quest for authentic interior Mexican food we landed at El Pastor for lunch this weekend.  The place is in a strip mall  exactly what you would expect in East Austin  not too fancy. However  the place was exceptionally clean. We were greeted as we came in by what seemed to e the family that owns the place. Very friendly and corteous.  You know you have a good chance at authentic food when mostly Mexicans are eating there  I am a Mexican too . I orderd  taquitos al pastor  the specialty of the house. They were awesome. Probably as good as those from Guero s. Make sure you get some pineapple in yours to get the full flavor. The salsa was just OK.My wife got a gordita de frijol which was pretty good too.  I guess we need to come back to experience more menu items in order to have a ful opinion  but from what we tasted last weekend  El Pastor surely makes the list of places with good  authentic Mexican food.
Rosita's al Pastor,323,Great place for lunch  Menu was diverse and affordable. The salsa was awesome. I had two tacos and I was stuffed. They were bursting with flavor and the meat was moist.  Service was friendly and speedy. If I lived in Austin  I would be a regular 
Rosita's al Pastor,324,Hands down the best little hidden gem in my neighborhood. They have the best al pastor in Austin. The tortillas are all made fresh and the prices cannot be beat. Every time friends come in town to visit we take them to Rosita s and they are never disappointed. Fantastic breakfast tacos too  Did I mention the chicken tortilla soup    AMAZING.
Rosita's al Pastor,325,So I have been here multiple times. The food truck and the actual restaurant. I gotta say  it is my safe bet  go to taco spot whether it noon after a long night or just need some quick dinner. The tortillas are homemade  I repeat HOMEMADE  Still have the flour falling off when you bite in. I have had multiple dishes here and although I can t rattle them off I gotta say maybe the pork chop was my least favorite. Mostly because it is bone in. But if you need a breakfast taco or any taco for that matter their taco menu is extensive  I highly recommend this spot and it s always the spot I take my out of town guest. The service is always top notch which is always a plus.
Rosita's al Pastor,326,These ARE the best tacos. I don t just mean in Austin  not even just in Texas - EVER. Bacon  potato  egg on flour. Pure gold.  There s a food truck out front  restaurant behind.  If you care about wall murals and atmosphere and valet parking  then head back to Dallas or the Bay because you re eating here for the food experience alone.  THOSE TORTILLAS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
Rosita's al Pastor,327,This review is for the brick and mortar. If you go into the restaurant  it s always good. Some of my favorite migas and veggie tacos in the city  love their salsa  and their horchata is the best kept hidden secret for a hangover cure. However  the taco truck typically fails me. I ve gone at least 10x - both during the day and late night. I have been disappointed almost every time. Typically over-cooked chicken  stale tortillas and they often get my order wrong.
Rosita's al Pastor,328,Maybe they were having a bad day but this place really sucked. Granted it is my one only time here and I m never going back. I don t know what all the fuss is about. I ordered 4 al pastor tacos. The meat was dry and somewhat crispy as opposed to juicy. And I know what a good al pastor should taste like. The place is affordable but by the same token its cheap food. Oh and their red hot sauce is a friggin joke. It s not hot at all and is severely lacking in flavor.
Rosita's al Pastor,329,The staff are condescending unless you look like you speak Spanish. If you understand spanish but don t look it they ll be disrespectful.  I overlooked that small bit of racism...  After 4 visits I got food poisoning....  F   amp     this place
Rosita's al Pastor,330,I had a love affair with this trailer about 20 years ago.  Thank you Yelp for reviving that fire.  This was awesome trailer food before awesome trailer food was part of the gastro-lexicon.   I used to go to ACC Riverside for welding certification.  Twice a week I would stop here for Al Pastor tacos.  At that time they were always five for five dollars.  It was true love.  They are now three for five dollars  and still a bargain. These are the best and most authentic Al Pastor tacos north of the border.  They truly taste just like the street tacos in Mexico.  Over the years I have thought of them often  but for some reason I never did go back.  I figured there was no way that little trailer was still there.    I was wrong.  Thank God  And thank you Yelp   A recent search for al Pastor brought me back here after so many years......
Rosita's al Pastor,331,This is a hard one to review. We ordered 3 or 4 different tacos. The Gringa was AMAZING  Fried cheese with their pastor on a fresh flour tortilla. However... The other tacos were super disappointing. Basically  if I ever come back it will only be to order that one specific taco on the menu.
Rosita's al Pastor,332,Picked up breakfast tacos here based on a friend s recommendation.  Authentic and everything homemade   Then on another occasion picked up two lunch specials   5 per plate.  Enchiladas homemade and some of the best around.  Tacos al pastor  the best I ve had in Austin if they had pineapple on them.... YUM
Rosita's al Pastor,333,Love this place    Food and service  Some times they are super busy and you have to wait awhile but it s totally worth it 
Rosita's al Pastor,334,The food is good but not good enough for the price  they don t seem understaffed but food took like 15 minutes  pastor tacos should come with pineapple... here you have to pay 25cents for 3 pieces... per taco     Ridiculous  
Rosita's al Pastor,335,GET THE LENGUA. if you dont know what tha tis just trust me.   i actually missed the famous Al Pastor that they promote all over yelp but really the lengua was heads and tails above.   THEY MAKE THEIR OWN FLOUR TORILLA - HELLO      lengua was great but not greasy too fatty at all. i dont think ive had better  the barbacoa was greasy as a used car sales man. i think ive always experienced that with barbacoa tacos at taco stands. great great flavor but too greasy. if i say its too greasy then just assume its ultra greasy for you  al pastor was dry to me.  yes i ordered a ton of tacos and got a speeding ticket going to this place. first tix in at least 5 years
Rosita's al Pastor,336,Great tacos    Brought some friends here a few times and they go from only ordering two tacos to getting up and ordering two more    Fresh tortillas  fresh food and good service  One of the BEST places in Austin 
Rosita's al Pastor,337,Pastor  tripas  gorditas  oh my  This was defiantly the go-to spot after a long night of being out on the town. Fast forward 10-12 years and I m finding myself back at the same spot  ordering the same things  and it all taste just the same. Authentic  homemade  delicious  not enough words to describe it. So it doesn t matter if you ve been over-served or if you re just looking to scratch the itch of wanting some just damn good Mexican street food  this is your spot  Don t let the closed advert fool you  the truck is open pretty much all night long.
Rosita's al Pastor,338,Good breakfast tacos and guacamole and tortillas.
Rosita's al Pastor,339,This is my favorite place to get pastor tacos  amp  tacos in general  amp  the horchata is soo good too 
Rosita's al Pastor,340,By far one of my favorite places to go eat and take my family with me  Really affordable and the Al Pastor tacos are closest to home. Coming to Austin for college  I couldn t find any good authentic Mexican restaurants  however  Rositas hit the spot  I always recommend this place for family and friends who are in town. My personal favorite is the quesadilla de al pastor.
Rosita's al Pastor,341,Amazing    Every time we are in Austin we stop by here    Amazing customer service  food is authentic   And I m a pretty hard to please Mexican    Lol perfect for after 6th street  
Rosita's al Pastor,342,This place has some of the best Al pastor and flour tortillas I ve ever had.  If you want an amazing meal  order the alambre plate with the flour tortillas.  It is Al pastor  beef fajita  and bacon mixed with onions and bell peppers.  Unfortunately not open for dinner.
Rosita's al Pastor,343,A taco trailer open late that was walkable from my AirBnB in Riverside. Order  amp  pay  then sit  amp  wait for your number to be called  in Spanish   Tacos al pastor  no onion  corn tortilla  squeeze of lime  all day erry day.
Rosita's al Pastor,344,I used to go to this taco stand atleast 1-2 times a week  but the past three times they have messed up my order    One time they didn t give me a taco I paid for  another time they gave me extra bacon instead of beans  and one time they gave me some random ass taco that was not what I ordered  I m currently seeking a new breakfast  al pastor taco stand to destroy countless tacos at.   The only reason they are getting two stars is because their salsa verde is the most glorious salsa I have ever consumed. Only a spawn of Satan would settle for the salsa roja.
Rosita's al Pastor,345,I absolutely LOVE this place.  I admit the outlet it s located in isn t the prettiest and looks shady and shabby but this place has delicious tacos.  I always get the al pastor tacos but the thing I love the most about this place is that it has the most addicting salsas ever.    I am pretty much addicted to their salsa verde which keeps me coming back time and time again trying to figure out how they get their salsa verde creamy.  They offer complimentary chips and salsa  which is also spicy and delicious .    Whenever I am craving tacos  I end up always wanting to come back to this place.  No  it s not very upscale but you always get your money s worth.
Rosita's al Pastor,346,We stopped by here real quick on a Thursday night. Husband has been here before but it was my first. Super fast service even though it was busy  Some of the best Al pastor tacos I have had  Will definitely be returning 
Rosita's al Pastor,347,MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND STOP  3 We stuck out like two gringos in a restaurant full of Mexicans. Good sign. Also  apparently this place is so good that it can set up a restaurant and a taco stand in the same shopping center. Because it was so hot  we opted for the restaurant.  CHIPS AND SALSA - 5 stars. This salsa is so much better than any of the Tex-Mex tomato sauces offered up in Dallas. It was spicy  it was flavorful.  PASTOR TACOS - 4 stars. The meat was well-seasoned  but not quite tender enough. Perhaps I should have ordered them from the taco stand  where the meat tenderizes in the 100 degree heat all day. In any case  the tortillas were excellent.  CHEESE ENCHILADAS - 4 stars. Exactly as they should be  cheese wrapped in corn tortillas  smothered in cheese  then drowned in red sauce. Mmmmmm  red sauce.  FINAL THOUGHTS  Definitely going back. Next time I ll suck it up and face the heat to try out the taco stand.
Rosita's al Pastor,348,The best al pastor tacos in Austin  and only  1.75 each. They make the flour tortillas fresh each day  and you can see the pastor turning on the fire in the back of the truck.   A perfect spot for breakfast  lunch  dinner  or a late night snack.
Rosita's al Pastor,349,Well  I tried this place again  this time  went to the food truck outside   Read all the good reviews and thought they had changed.  Man  was I wrong  what are people thinking.  This is the worst pastor I have ever eaten. First off  the color of the pastor is weird  food coloring    very orange red  artificial looking. Next  the meat itself is lacking flavor  it needed salt or something. Finally  no char  and had that strange flavor and after taste that I had detected the first time I went in the restaurant. NEVER AGAIN   If all you 5 star reviews were to go to a good pastor place  you would realize this is bad.  Next time you venture up to dallas  go to Friendly s El Tacaso off harry hines or even try Fuel City tacos both of these are much better than this place. Enjoy 
Rosita's al Pastor,350,Ordered 2 al pastor tacos  for my companion  and 2 breakfast tacos  one with chorizo and egg  the other with bacon and egg . It took about 30 to 40 minutes for our order to be done  so I wouldn t recommend arriving hungry. We got flour tortillas  which were simultaneously doughy and fluffy. They were thicker  and more substantial   than I was used to  but nevertheless held their own against the complex textures of the fillings. The egg was beautifully light and the meat was incorporated inside  lending the filling a cohesive taste. This can be good or bad  depending on how much you want the tastes of each ingredient to stand out. I kind of was hoping the meat could be separate so I could further distinguish each bite  but I devoured each taco in seconds...no complaints there. My companion also really enjoyed the al pastor tacos  which had generous amounts of filling and lived up to their name. Definitely would come again.
Rosita's al Pastor,351,They are very rude when I ask for more salsa. I love their food but for them to be stingy with the salsas when I m even offering to pay extra for them is annoying they look at you ugly... i order 10-15 tacos and they only want to give me 4 salsas for all those tacos
Rosita's al Pastor,352,Rositas is awesome food  and super inexpensive. It s absolutely worth checking out  no more needs to be said.
Rosita's al Pastor,353,I ve got some ridiculously high Mexican food standards. I was born  amp  raised on the border  amp  my mom is from Mexico City.   When I was told to go visit this taco truck  that is so totally mexican  you can image my eye roll.  I had lowwwww expectations because I have been disappointed in Austin s  authentic  taco stands lately.   WELL  this place was unbelievably authentic  amp  delicious. I shared a bistek torta and some tacos el pastor with a pal.  The torta bread was soft  amp  moist  a perfect vessel for the bisket meat  avocado  queso fresco  cheese  lettuce  amp  tomato. The pork al pastor taco was perfectly cooked  amp  seasoned and the tortilla tasted homemade. You know  having the wrong tortilla or torta bread can really ruin the entire meal    Knowing that they re opened until 4am on weekends will make me crave this after a night at the bars. The food was cheap and insanely good  I highly recommend this truck if you want legitimate Mexican food. Ole      I cannot review the actual restaurant  but this review was based on the taco truck in the parking lot.  
Rosita's al Pastor,354,The al pastor has changed dramatically. It s inedible greasy and I suspect they add food coloring now. Also since when do you have to specify that you want onions and pineapple  Those are typically included but all I had was a fuck ton of cilantro which I really like cilantro but come on   Ummmmmmmm thanks for all 8 halfway full salsa cups though because wtf 
Rosita's al Pastor,355,It may not look too pretty on the outside  but this place has great food.  I had the Veggie Torta my first time there  and it was very good. It is A LOT of food as well  which is great.  The Pastor Tacos are my favorite. The pork is seasoned so well. I typically get three of them. I live really close to here and my only regret is that I didn t try it sooner.  The staff has always been friendly when I ve been there  and their prices can t be beat.  Would definitely recommend.
Rosita's al Pastor,356,Delicious   It takes me home with it s original home made flavors I am going there again today   mmmhhhh
Rosita's al Pastor,357,Fantastic little trailer on E. Riverside that serves up exactly what they advertise. Delicious  melt in your mouth  spicy  sweet al pastor tacos.   I always get them on corn with extra onion and cilantro with Avocado. They are open late on the weekends for late night grubbery  and almost always a good crowd of people.  Take your taste buds on a magical adventure to taco land  you won t regret it.
Rosita's al Pastor,358,4.75 stars.  Back in the early part of this millennium  I was a taco-starving student who happened upon Rosita s Al Pastor  a gateway to my obsession with the trompo-style cooking of marinated pork meat cradled within a taco replete with cilantro  onions  and sweet morsels of pineapple.  Rosita s version is generous with achiote paste maximizing both flavor and display for what in my early days connoted to the best damn taco I had ever eaten.     Over a decade has passed.  This guy has eaten a ton of great tacos in every shape  size  and form.  Most recently  I had an al pastor taco at Chela s in San Antonio which  despite its vivid contrast to Rosita s  stole the mantle for best al pastor taco I have eaten.    Then I went back to Rosita s.    I m not sure which taco is better  the distinction is really close.  Rosita s Al Pastor meat is a textural treat with both stringy sections of pork combined with soft  supple  pillowy portions that simply melt in the mouth.  The cilantro is fresh  and the pineapple is understated and a wonderful complement to the taco.  Most tacos begin and end with the tortilla  and Rosita s still makes some of the best corn tortillas I ve ever eaten  for the flour people  they can do that as well .  The prices at Rosita s have barely changed which is a testament to them.  Service is as friendly as it used to be.  I remember back in the early 2000s it was sometimes a bit difficult to order because my Spanish was weak  there is no longer any communication barrier though I still wish my Spanish was stronger as I d hopefully be able to communicate my appreciation for this humble taco joint in a more appreciable manner.    There are undoubtedly many places in Austin where you can find absolutely stunning tacos of nearly every flavor.  That said  I d be hard-pressed to say you can find a better al pastor taco in the city.  Rosita s remains a standard-bearer  and is certainly a memorable addition to any culinary visit to the State Capitol.
Rosita's al Pastor,359,Always a delight  probably the best pastor tacos around. I ve been eating here once to twice a week since 2007 and I ve never been disappointed once.   You can t go wrong when it s family owned  the staff is friendly but make sure you get there before midnight or you will have to wait in a line because everything is made fresh to order. Wait times can vary but I don t think I ve ever waited more than 20 minutes for my food unless I walked up as the bars were closing.   Either way it s well worth the wait  if you have the time visit the restaurant too because they have a killer chile relleno plate and other homemade salsas you can t get at the taco stand.
Rosita's al Pastor,360,The service was horrible  I ordered 4 tacos to go and the lady gave me soup instead. I then accidentally spilled it on myself when I got home not knowing it was soup. It caused my skin to blister. When I told the lady to make me a new batch of tacos so they would be warm since I had already gone home and was heading back for my correct order  she was rude about it. Upon arriving she got mad at me because I did not bring back the soup so she could resell it. Awful experience  I will never be going back.
Rosita's al Pastor,361,I was just visiting friends in Austin this week  and thankfully they took me to Rosita s. Quite honestly  this was the best Mexican food I ve ever had. I had chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce  and a taco al pastor. They were both amazing. The rice and beans were out of this world too. Definitely eat here if you get the chance.
Rosita's al Pastor,362,Best tacos in the UNIVERSE    Everything from the salsa to the savory meat have so much flavor. They really know how to make an authentic taco   Request to have the grilled onions and the white cheese melted on the tortilla  called a  Gringa  . If you tip them they will give you a grilled jalapeno    Be careful with the salsa... its hot as af    
Rosita's al Pastor,363,Tacos al pastor with tortillas de maiz. It s only the best tacos anyone can order if you pull over to eat at this gem of a place   The flavor in the pastor is out of this world. Tortillas are rolled and made fresh right in front of you as you take your order from the cashier. If you don t know what to eat in the riverside area  just get in your car and drive here. You will have  no regrats  Not a single one at all   
Rosita's al Pastor,364,Are you freaking kidding me     5 al pastor tacos for  5       Sign me up.  Came in here on a Tuesday starving and angry and left completely satisfied.  Arguably the best tacos I ve had in Austin as of yet  especially for the price.  Must go for sure.
Rosita's al Pastor,365,Rositas is the fire. Mad authentic tacos are constantly being pumped out of this trailer off of Riverside.1.75 al pastor so get a few. No booze but I ve never had any problems with byob..
Rosita's al Pastor,366,TACOS   These are amazing. 5 stars alone for the most amazing fresh  thick  chewy flour tortillas I ve ever eaten. Being a vegetarian my options were limited but I went for an egg and potato breakfast taco and an egg and bean breakfast taco. Everything was flavorful and hot and well prepared. The potatoes were perfectly cooked and the refried beans were delicious. So creamy yummmmm. Both salsas are fresh and spicy. I think I like the salsa verde better than the rioja...... but both are great.   For the price and convenience this is as good as it gets. I ll absolutely be back. My boyfriend swears by the pastor and the chicken fajita. He also loves the barbacoa.
Rosita's al Pastor,367,This place is great  open until late wait usually doesn t take that long. The people are quick and helpful and the food is always really good  would recommend to anyone in the area best tacos on riverside
Rosita's al Pastor,368,I came here because I saw the write up from zagat and I am thankful for that article   I ordered 2 of their famous pastor tacos and one chicken taco. I must say when I first looked at my plate and saw the pastor wrapped in only one corn tortilla  versus the standard two handheld etiquette  I immediately doubted the hubbub  Well  Rositas...you have earned the right to make your own rules  All three of my tacos were 5 star. Sorry Zagat I actually think the chicken was my favorite  There was a slight sweet hint  cinnamon perhaps   that stood out. My daughter also demolished her egg and beans that they thoughtfully made for her. So...if they can please a toddler maybe they should be getting 5 1 2 stars 
Rosita's al Pastor,369,Fresh  Solid  Roadside Tacos  cant go wrong. Stewed meat  Carne Guisada  and pork skin  Chicharron  are good choices.
Rosita's al Pastor,370,It has it good and bad days. Probably visit this taco truck 1-3 times a week and get different items with different combos or just the plain regular fajita  amp  tacos al pastor. The ladies are super rude if you don t tip when you use your credit card and your cokes come out to room temperature. Most  authentic  joint in riverside. We always find it expensive for 2 people coming out to  20-25 for tacos and 2 cokes. Will continue to come but just wish they were nicer.
Rosita's al Pastor,371,This is my go-to recommendation for real Mexican food in this city. It s beautifully cheap and consistently delicious. My usual lunch is two al pastor tacos with onions  cilantro  and fresh avocado - total comes out as  4.88.
Rosita's al Pastor,372,As a Mexican  I ve finally found a place that comes damn close to being fully authentic. Still not like being back in Mexico  of course  but a lot closer to Mexican taste than Torchys  Taco Shack  or Juan in a Million.  You will get real salsa here. You will also get real guacamole. None of that green paste with sour cream you get at Tex-Mex joints.  There s only two things I would change  1. The cheese. If they switched to asadero or oaxaca cheese this place would get my 5 5. 2. The flour tortillas are a bit too thick  but that s more of a personal opinion.
Rosita's al Pastor,373,Go here once a week with the boyfriend. We both get three tacos and the occasional horchata for under 15 dollars. Without drinks  we easily stay under ten dollars. It s cheap  the women who work there are so kind  and the food is obviously fresh and well made. I love it  In the last year I ve been coming  nothing has ever happened to make me question Al Pastor. Almost as good as the food I ve had in the Rio Grande Valley.
Rosita's al Pastor,374,I tried leaving a decent review  but I m totally kidding myself. These tacos were average at best. I ve been in Texas my whole life  so forgive me if my standard for authentic Mexican tacos is too high...but the chicken tacos were overcooked  the barbacoa was so heavy and oily it was practically impossible to eat  and the salsa...well  let s just say you can probably make better salsa at home. I will give them the beef fajitas. They were okay. Service was sweet too. Just...wish the food was better and less disappointing.
Rosita's al Pastor,375,Went there on a recommendation for authentic Mexican tacos. It was very busy and lots of people who looked like they would know a good taco were in line - so needless to say  we were excited  The fresh flour tacos were very good. The beef was a little greasy but tasty. Service was good. However  PLEASE get a recycling can. It was painful to see all the plastic and glass thrown in the garbage.
Rosita's al Pastor,376,Friendly service and my first bite into an Al Pastor taco with some of the red salsa was an OMG moment. My husband said his chicken fajita tacos with green salsa were also very good. Will definitely return.
Rosita's al Pastor,377,Of the hundreds of places I have ate tacos  this ranks right up there. The homemade tortillas are so tasty.
Rosita's al Pastor,378,Best Al Pastor taco I ve had in Austin  so far  Tip - add pineapple  cheese  and avocado...you ll thank me later. Also  the barbacoa is really tasty too      definitely a noticeable difference in quality when going at 2 00AM and 2 00PM.  But  it makes sense since there is a surge in customers when the bars get out.
Rosita's al Pastor,379,Best pastor I ve had around town. Pretty consistent. Not really the best customer service and not the cleanest eating area. Like this place though.
Rosita's al Pastor,380,I ordered two tacos  bistec  amp  barbacoa  and they were both solid. There were a few people in front of me  but the wait was reasonable. If you are in the neighborhood and looking for a budget meal  you should consider giving the food truck a try.
Rosita's al Pastor,381,The tacos al pastor I ordered were not what I expected. I know Mexican food  especially tacos tend to be oily  but these tacos were drowned in oil. I also payed a bit more so that I can have avocado and some of the other veggies included in the taco  but when I came home to open the plate I only saw the melted cheese and the meat. The cheese was so glued to the taco that when I tried to open the taco to pour in the green sauce  it tore apart. It was just a mess  So disappointed. I thought I had finally found my authentic Mexican food truck.   
Rosita's al Pastor,382,Fantastic al pastor tacos at a fantastic price  Only  2  I wish they were open at night too but that s my only complaint. Great tortillas  great quality meat...a 10 10 overall.
Rosita's al Pastor,383,So damn good  Best tacos al pastor I ve had since living in Mexico. Just ask to add pi a. Fast and delicious.
Rosita's al Pastor,384,Yes. Get the Al pastor. It s DELISH. there are bees and pigeons everywhere outside but don t worry-you won t notice them once you start eating your tacos 
Rosita's al Pastor,385,my veggie tacos exceeded the expectations i did not have. came w a fat lime and some salsa. 5 stars for me  i will be back
Rosita's al Pastor,386,Hands down the best tacos I have ever had. I ve had the al pastor and breakfast tacos and both were great  I ve had many al pastor tacos and these are defiantly the best  They re also bigger than most street tacos. Flour tortillas are made fresh  come out hot  and are so delicious
Rosita's al Pastor,387,Finally found authentic Mexican food from a carruchita. I had tacos al pastor for  1.50 each. It doesn t get any better than that. The whole family of 5 enjoyed a nice dinner for  40.
Rosita's al Pastor,388,Tried the flour tortillas and they were excellent. The lady was hand making them when I walked up to order. Also they had real mexico coke 
Rosita's al Pastor,389,If an asian tells you that the food here is authentic  you re gonna most likely laugh at them. But seriously  the food here is absolutely DELICIOUS. I ve always gotten tacos-- the pastor tacos  beef fajita tacos  carnitas  and the lengua tacos. All of them are sensational.   I ve also tried the tortas  and I ve also gotten the chalupas. Their sauces are spicy  but your dish really isn t the same without them. Each dish also comes with a couple of lime wedges.They make their own flour tortillas  and they always come out tasting fresh. Basically what I m trying to say is that  whatever you choose  you re going to be satisfied.  If you re driving past this food truck  and think  I ve already had this twice this week  do I really want it again   The answer is  hell yeah you do .
Rosita's al Pastor,390,Well to start off they have the only Pastor in town that I absolutely love  I can not find Pastor like that anywhere else. I also love their fajitas and homemade flour tortillas is so awesome  basically a majority of their food is so awesome. I have no complaints on their food at all.   Now I do have some complaints on how long the wait is now  they need another trailer and more workers  or at least leave restaurant open more longer.
Rosita's al Pastor,391,So  let me get this right . . . You can order 3 Al Pastor Tacos for  4.99 or 5 Al Pastor tacos for  5  What s a girl to do  I ordered 5 tacos today at lunch with Jaye J. Jaye did the same thing and was responsible enough to eat 3 and save the other 2 for dinner. I  on the other hand  shoved all 5 tacos into my gluttonous mouth. I intended on taking a couple of them home  but that greasy pork was just too darn good.  It takes a lot to get me over to East Riverside  but this deal was too good to be true. So you might get approached by the random crazy in the parking lot  but it is well worth 5 awesome Al Pastor tacos.  Now I am back at work and might curl up under my desk and nap . . . Or die.
Rosita's al Pastor,392,A little disappointed. We went inside their restaurant rather than the truck. Their tacos were dry  had to drench it in salsa lime hot sauce so that we could get a little flavor. I will say though  their pineapple juice was incredibly fresh and delicious.
Rosita's al Pastor,393,Hands down the best authentic tacos al pastor I ve tried in Austin  brings back memories from Mexico. Definitely a place to try    Plus they have homemade tortillas 
Rosita's al Pastor,394,their food is of good quality but their staff does not follow the health rules they touch their nose or hair all the time and so they put on gloves and prepare our tacos  that s not good  they should wash their hands every time they put on gloves
Rosita's al Pastor,395,I can see how it might be a little easy on one hand to get carried away here  there are tons of choices to be had  and all of them pretty much verifiably on the cheap. For my part I came in confessing the need for a hangover-curing  authentic and battery-charging elixir by way of some sort of taco demigod. I ve been hearing raves  let s just put it that way. It s a little bit of a dodgy locale at present  but we were so hungry that we leaned on the pedal in order to get there quick.   Once we ambled up to the window  an interesting thing happened  first  know that whoever s working the window will likely look overmatched. At least  that s what happened in our instance. It looked for a moment like there wasn t a one of us that stood a chance of getting what we ordered exactly like we ordered it  and we weren t being picky. But I mentioned the hangover..we also were optimistic that whatever turned up when our food came out would stand a fighter s chance of fixing the problem.  As it turns out  I ordered the egg  amp  bacon breakfast taco on flour and a carne guisada taco on flour. Both hit the spot  and the bacon and egg one actually turned out to be the more nuanced of the two. That was a surprise. As for the other one  I found it a better than average carne guisada taco  but not near as ohmygawd delicious as what I encountered at Las Cazuelas. Maybe that s asking too much. I also attempted to order a Pineapple soda but received a pineapple agua fresca...and know what  Not bad. It s out of the way  and a little bit of a hassle..but in the end...really good for what ails ya. And that s a start from where I m standing.
Rosita's al Pastor,396,I gauge Mexican restaurants on 3 metrics. As a native Texan  of course  queso is crucial. Although I haven t tested the queso at this hidden gem I have to say they far exceeded my expectations for the other 2. Their pastor is amazing. One corn tortilla generously packed with expertly prepared pork and topped with cilantro and onions will set you back  1.75  well below the average taco prices around here. The final metric has always been a favorite of mine and a staple in the world of Mexican food  the tortilla soup. For a miniscule  7.99 I received an enormous bowl of liquid heaven. Although it didn t come with the side of diced onions  cilantro  and jalapenos I ve grown accustomed to I found myself  nevertheless  enamored. It wasn t too salty and had a slight kick but  to me  if your nose isn t running a bit then you aren t doing it right. I highly recommend this place and it s safe to say I ve found my new go-to spot on the Southeast side. One warning  the restaurant closes each day at 5pm but they have a taco truck in front just off Riverside  open late but with a limited menu.
Rosita's al Pastor,397,I really like this place   This is one of those places that I probably would never have found it if not for the Yelp app.  I was visiting a friend not too far away  and we turned on the app  searched for restaurants nearby  and filtered by average review.  This is one of the most highly rated restaurants in this part of town  and it s easy to see why.  The waitresses were all friendly  but not all of them spoke English  so it s lucky that I have a smattering of Spanish  but I m sure you could get by just fine without any Spanish.  The menu is in English and Spanish.  The best thing about the place   They make their own tortillas.  I got the mixed al pastor fajita plate  and I couldn t finish it  because it was too much  not because it wasn t good .  I would probably opt for either or next time  since I expected the plate to have a portion of fajita meat and a portion of al pastor  the house specialty   but it actually came out all tossed together  so each little taco I assembled was an al pastor fajita hybrid.  I preferred the al pastor.    The place is nothing fancy.  When we walked in  I actually thought for a moment that it might be an order-at-the-counter kind of place  but they provide table service.  If they served margaritas  I would be tempted to give them an extra star.  As it was  I opted for a Coke  and this is one of the areas where they fell short for me  they brought a glass of ice and a warm can of Coke.  Warm Coke   ice does not make a good drink. I don t mind a can if it s cold  and they were bustling at almost 9 pm on a Sunday  so I think they have enough business they could afford to buy an extra refrigerator.  My tip  Order extra tortillas.  They cook them to order  so if you order more in the middle of the meal  you ll have to wait a while.  Just trust me  and order some up front.  Both the corn and flour tortillas were delicious.
Rosita's al Pastor,398,Enjoyed the home made food at a great price   Queso con chile is tasty and cream  I think they use America cheese.
Rosita's al Pastor,399,Allison  P  N. and I are on a quest for the best tacos al pastor in Austin  and ladies and gentlemen  we have a contender at Rosita s Al Pastor on E. Riverside.  Like Allison said  we each ordered the 5 for  5 and dove right in to mind blowing territory. Sometimes  There d be a fatty piece of pork  And it tasted like bacon. In the future  I have a feeling that she and I could split an order of 5 and be perfectly happy. And then lunch would be  2.50 each  Are you kidding me  Yes please.  I brought my last two tacos back to work and my co-worker just devoured them proclaiming them to be  damned good . Another co-worker just brought me a caramel chocolate chip cookie. This is the best day EVER 
Rosita's al Pastor,400,This review is for the cart only.....I have no experience in the sit down restaurant. My girlfriend suggested we go and try it out  as she had been there and knows someone who works there. She said it was very good. I was skeptical to say the least. I ve been to some really terrible food trailers in East Austin. REALLY terrible.  Around 2am  we poured out of the car and stumbled over to the cart. I was impressed that they stayed open so late  even on a weekend. That s the kind of service and dependability I like. Although there was a line  it went quickly. I figured I d try the signature Al Pastor tacos.   wow. unbelievable. Let me tell you  after a night of drinking  it was the PERFECT antidote. The meat was hot and tasted pretty good to me  albeit I m a gringo  but it definitely has the neighborhood s approval ....the tortillas were fresh and homemade  and the price was awesome. I like the hot sauce too  but it s not a  must . The tacos stand very well on their own.   I found myself dreaming about these tacos after having them once  and have been back several times in under a week. Which is unusual for me  as I am picky and I m not easily blown away by food. I now call it the Taco Dream Cart.  I can t recommend it highly enough. We need more places like this in Austin. MORE MORE MORE  
Rosita's al Pastor,401,This spot was recommended to me as having the best al pastor tacos in Austin. They are NOT and here s why.   As everyone may or may not know they have a taco stand across the parking lot from the restaurant. It s at the stand they cook their pastor meat on a turning spit and from this they carve to construct a taco. We ate in the restaurant and found the taste of this al pastor taco to be just OK with a slight metallic flavor. Found out this metallic flavor comes from them slicing the meat they need off the taco stand spit and then it s transferred to the restaurant via a metal tray. Once inside the restaurant they chop this meat and warm up on the grill. Not good and just plain silly... and lazy  Additionally  there was absolutely ZERO fresh pineapple flavor which is THE trademark of a good al pastor taco. Instead they add ginger to the marinade which adds nothing but a puzzled look on the face of diners.  Chips were stale and their hot sauces are way overblown. Lastly  this joint in located in a real nasty area on Riverside Drive. If you have to go then make it during daylight.  ALERT     We were over-charged on our small tab of just 4 tacos and 1 beer by a couple of dollars. These people do NOT itemize your bill. Take caution as this type of activity appears to be normal operating procedure   Rositas.. Please refer to a previous Yelpers experience below for additional examples.    Bottom line this is a VERY mediocre establishment in a very sad part of Austin. Would barely suggest going. Truth be told... don t go.
Rosita's al Pastor,402,Best al pastor  Really  It s the only al pastor I ve had that looked like tandoori pork  with a strange artificial red color which permeates the entire meat. What the hell is this stuff  It s not seared on the surface like some of the real  best  I ve had. No pineapple included  I shouldn t have to ask for it . No flavor.  The salsa roja tasted  funny. Once I drank the extremely-chlorinated tap water  I realized that it had been used for the salsa. Totally ruined it. Good thing the chips were stale and inferior anyway.   Horchata was extremely sweet. Salsa verde was alright and spicy enough. Michelada was great  and probably the only redeeming thing here  and I only ordered it because the water was undrinkable .  One of the sadder meals I ve had since moving to this town. Good thing Curra s isn t far away and has a superior al pastor taco.
Rosita's al Pastor,403,Absolutely love this place  Very authentic. The lines can get a bit long but totally worth the wait. A Riverside staple  The al pastor are amazing. The picadillo gorditas are also never a disappointment. Seriously everyone needs to try this place.
Rosita's al Pastor,404,The Pastor Tacos are to die for  Their tortillas are homemade and  they are pretty quick to get your food out. They also keep Big Red stocked- a plus in my book   The chicken fajita was a little dry but overall this place is great 
Rosita's al Pastor,405,Hands down best breakfast tacos ever    Also super cheap and everything tastes so fresh. My go to is the egg cheese and bacon or chorizo breakfast taco on corn  or if I m craving lunching I stick with their tacos al pastor  They give you home made salsa on the side that is so delicious. Can t go wrong with this place.
Rosita's al Pastor,406,Cheap  fast  good. Pick all 3.  I went to Rosita s on a quest to find the best Al Pastor in the city. I ordered the tacos al pastor.  I m not sure  but they may serve other things.  The tacos were prepared quickly  and served 3 on a plate. They tasted splendid--lightly fruity  barbecue  but not barbacoa  and not too sweet.  I thought it was good. I don t know if I d call it the best in the city... or not the best. But  if you re hunting good al pastor  this is definitely worth a visit  and I wish this place was closer to my normal paths so I could visit more often.
Rosita's al Pastor,407,Confession  We ve eaten here something like four times in the last 3 weeks.  I m starting to recognize the songs on the jukebox.  And when we re away from here  I fantasize about coming back.  Because their al pastor is just. that. good.  If you peek in the back when you walk in  you ll notice a huge spit in the back  gently sizzling and rotating with a hunk of bright orange-red pork on it.  That s the love cooking  right there.  Order you up some from the back of the menu.  The al pastor comes in strips sliced from the roast.  Sometimes you get a nice hunk of fat in there.  It s a savory  tangy nirvana of flavor that s perfectly accompanied by the sweet homemade corn tortillas.  Sides are also happy.  The rice is tasty and the beans are a good consistency and well-flavored with bacon grease.  You have two different dining options here  either a sit-down restaurant back in the strip center or the taco truck up closer to the street.  They re both from the same kitchen.  Make no mistake  this is the best al pastor in town.
Rosita's al Pastor,408,I went to Al Pastor for lunch with my girlfriend based on a co-workers recommendation and was not disappointed.   The outside of the restaurant was undercover as the glass windows were  one way type glass. It was hard to tell where the entrance was but we found a door to open and hoped for the best.  Upon opening the door  we were greeted with a typical tex-mex feel restaurant with both tables and booths. There was a jukebox in the corner and a large screen HD TV showing spanish music videos.  We walked to the counter since we were not sure what the process was and we were greeted by a very friendly lady who informed us that if we wanted to eat there  we could sit anywhere and someone would bring us chips and salsa.  We sat in a booth which was comfortable and clean. Our chips and salsa were delivered quickly by our waitress who then asked what we wanted to drink  in spanish . Luckily I know enough spanish to understand restaurant spanish and informed my girlfriend that she wanted to know what we wanted to drink. I asked for water and she asked for diet coke which was brought with a glass of ice and a can. They do not have fountain drinks. I did notice that some other tables had ordered mexican coca cola in bottles if that is your thing.  They menu was not too complicated. As the name suggests the menu held a wide variety of al pastor dishes. I ordered the al pastor dinner  and my girlfriend ordered the al pastor quesadilla.  They food was delivered quick enough and was hot.  Al Pastor Dinner   Al pastor meat with onions and green peppers grilled together. Rice and beans are included as well as a small pile of lettuce  tomato and gratted cheese. The rice was very good. It was nice and fluffy with good flavor. The beans were also very good. Just the way I like refried beans  smooth but with some whole beans intermixed. The meat had good flavor and was not too dry. I ordered corn tortillas  which were homemade and a bit on the thick side but very hot.  Al Pastor Quesadilla  Comes with sour cream  cilantro  and tomatoes  listed as pico de gillo of the menu  and the quesedilla which was very large and cut in quarters. It was so big that my girlfriend couldn t eat it all  so I got to taste some and it was very good. It was a bit on the cheesy side  but I liked the cheese since it was that white mexican cheese rather than yellow cheddar.  Overall   It was a very good meal. The food was hot and not too expensive. Our total was 23  for the two dinners  a medium sized guacamole salad and two canned cokes.  I would definitely go back  but maybe not too late at night.
Rosita's al Pastor,409,These are THE BEST Al Pastor tacos I have ever found. I m never in the area  but it would be worth the drive for me just to have some yummy tacos. I ve tried Al Pastor tacos at many other restaurants and taco stands but nothing  NOTHING  compares to these. I don t know how they do it. Cheap  delicious  5 star taco.
Rosita's al Pastor,410,Memories. Light the corners of my mind .... Scattered pictures  of the smiles we left behind...  Ordering a ham  egg  amp  cheese breakfast taco with my marginal-at-best Spanish. End result  a bacon  amp  cheese taco.  Parking in the Bingo lot next door and getting towed while I waited for my taco  towing strictly enforced right after a dead body was found in a car in that lot   And so many  many memories of unspeakably delicious al pastor tacos with extra green sauce. My favorite food vice in Austin  no contest.
Rosita's al Pastor,411,Wonderful breakfast fare. I had the eggs with nopalitos - a delicious combination   Potatoes were crispy and not at all greasy  delicious warm corn tortillas and refritos made it the perfect meal   My hubby had chorizo and egg and bacon and egg tacos on warm handmade flour tortillas.  A great breakfast experience   We ll be back 
Rosita's al Pastor,412,The pastor and the flour tortillas at Rosita s are amazing. One  5 taco meal here is totally worth a drive down to East Riverside even if you live elsewhere in Austin.  The pastor is tender and the most flavorful I ve ever had. A taco al pastor comes with onions  cilantro  and plastic containers of green and red sauce. The green sauce is incredible  the red is too hot for me  but I hear from more courageous eaters that it s delicious  too. I usually add avocado to my tacos al pastor. I ve tried to add pineapple  but Rosita s seems to run out of it early in the day.  The flour tortillas are just as good as their filling. A little thicker than you might normally find  soft  tender  and prepared right in the trailer. I haven t had a stale one yet.  The only other things I ve ordered at Rosita s are the tostadas al pastor and the horchata. A single tostada is piled with enough meat  cheese  onions  cilantro  and avocado to make up an entire meal. Good  but the pastor really shines when it s in one of the homemade tortillas. The tostada is pretty much a regular crunchy corn chip. Horchata is definitely homemade and tastes great.   I hear that you can call in orders to Rosita s  too. Maybe a good idea if you re not going at night  because that parking lot gets hot.
Rosita's al Pastor,413,I was looking for a brunch place really close to my complex and came across this one. I think it was originally a food truck that became a restaurant. The tortillas are made fresh and so is the salsa. They don t tell you that  but you can taste it. Also the horchata isn t incredibly sweet so you can drink the entire thing. I had the caldo de pollo which was very tasty and a really big portion for  just  8. My bf had the barbacoa tacos and bacon and egg tacos. He loved it. I recommend coming here for a quick awesome priced bite.
Rosita's al Pastor,414,This is delicious  bargain-priced Tex-Mex comfort food that is well deserving of its reputation. I loaded up on four breakfast tacos this morning  and though I didn t immediately fall in love  it s understandable why they seem to end up on all the best-of lists that are taco-related.   As the name implies  the pastor is the star here. It has its own section on the menu  and is served in seemingly twenty different ways - on tacos  enchiladas  tortas  gorditas  you name it. I ve loved the pungent flavors of pastor ever since I first came across it in Austin  and for a place to serve up a good pastor dish is almost as important to me as making perfect migas. Rosita s delivers on the hype surrounding their main attraction.  I m always in the mood for breakfast tacos - if they re on the menu  ordering becomes a pretty simple decision. I got two pastor tacos to get my fill of it  and was happy with the result. The pork was cooked just right  with good consistency. The meat didn t have the best taste  but the seasoning was excellent. The spices make the pork bright red here  the kind of distinct color that you don t always get with pastor elsewhere. To me  that bright appearance means your dish is going to be good  and it did not disappoint. As usual  the onion and cilantro they added on top gave the whole thing that classic taste. Definitely worth a return trip to try it in a different format. I also ordered a taco with salchicha  which is basically a sliced up hot dog  but its saltiness worked really well with the egg and salsa. I should mention  the salsa here is very good. Plenty of flavor so that you can enjoy your basket of chips before the meal. I also ordered a migas taco to see how their migas compare to the best around. It wasn t perfect but was pleasantly delicious  as the tortilla strips were cooked up nice and crunchy.  All in all  a satisfying and satiating meal. Four tacos were just the right amount  though I was super hungry   and for less than  7 without tax it s an absolute steal. The weakest part of the meal was the tortillas  which were pretty dry. Not a big deal though.  It s also worth mentioning  this place gives off the vibe of a relaxing  down-home environment. It s a pretty sizable venue  but though it was packed with customers it wasn t too loud. We got to lounge in a side booth and enjoy a good lunch without distractions. The service was good  and you finish by paying at the counter. An all-around good experience.
Rosita's al Pastor,415,We have been here twice now and have been underwhelmed by their pastor.  Both times  we ordered from the back of the menu for pastor-oriented items.    Last night  he got a quesadilla and I got flautas.  Their dishes were generally tasty.  I think that I just don t like the way they do their pastor.  It s too dry and waaaaay on the sour side.  Now  I am not one with a bland palate.  However  I don t like it when something tastes overwhelmingly like one ingredient.  It tasted like I was eating little pieces of dried lime.  In addition  I like my pastor to be a tad saucy.   Also  I thought their flautas were too crunchy.  I had to close my eyes while biting into it to shield my treasured eyeballs from flying tortilla shrapnel.  I really wanted to like this place but ...  shrug .
Rosita's al Pastor,416,I am a visitor to Austin from Los Angeles  so my knowledge love of Al Pastor is pretty solid.  That being said  this was some of the best Al Pastor I ve ever eaten.  It was fantastic  the person I was eating with ordered some tacos that were not Al Pastor and it was not very good.  But then again  this place is named Al Pastor for a reason.  The meat is perfectly seasoned  just the right amount of dryness  flavor  and texture.  Amazing.  When you get the menu  flip it over and ONLY order from the back.  Also  there is a truck in the same parking lot that serves AMAZING Al Pastor.  It s like Al Pastor Plaza  which could not make me any happier.
Rosita's al Pastor,417,The LAST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN RESTAURANT AND STREET TACOS IN AUSTIN TX.  There aren t enough stars for me to rate this amazing wonderful and extremely authentic restaurant and I have spent several Christmas Evenings at the Taco stand outside as well  once giving an impromptu mariachi concert before busking became illegal by city ordinance.  I have been coming here every since this place opened --they started out with the taco stand.OMG  Has it been over 22 years now  Same wonderful food throughout.  I have ALWAYS enjoyed their enchiladas al pastor. Best frijoles refritos EVER and almost anything you get in here is absolutely delicious  I remember when they first began with the taco stand over on Riverside Drive when the gang wars were happening and the Food Land parking lot was a wild dangerous and crazy place. We would duck when we heard the gun shots and they would continue to prepare my tacos and I would wait. I think it was hit by a bullet once but t was a culinary and an actual adventure.  I prefer the corn tortillas for the tacos.  I think it is third generation family now and the food is just as heavenly as ever. PURO MEXICANO. AS WONDERFUL AND GOOD AS IT GETS  THE 5 TACOS AL PASTOR Plate  OR A COUPLE OF GRINGAS OR SUISA TACOS AND A LARGE ICE COLD MEXICAN COCA cOLA AND A LOVELY NIGHT WITH SOME MARIACHI MUSIC ON MY STEREO--AS CLOSE TO HEAVEN AS IT EVER GETS.  I LOVE this place. The restaurant itself has a big screen TV usually on Tres or MTV but I ignore that  because I am there FOR THE FOOD   You MUST try this place if you want a MEXICAN FOOD experience before the dirtbag real estate developers gentrify all the Latino culture out of Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,418,Best tacos in Austin hands down. I usually go to the truck in the parking lot instead of the restaurant  because it s open very late  and seems to taste better    I love the chicharron  barbacoa  and lengua most  but you can t go wrong with the other meats. Although I m a maize kind of girl  the homemade flour tortillas are pretty damn good. A caveat though  I ve only ever had tacos here  so I ca t speak for the other items.   Oh  and put the green sauce on everything  for it is the sauce of gods.
Rosita's al Pastor,419,Awesome tacos  The homemade flour tortillas are amazing in texture. Must try the al pastor  I recommend adding cheese  avocado or pineapple for 25  each taco. I ve never been to the sit down restaurant. Always the food trailer  which is open pretty late for the late night hungries.
Rosita's al Pastor,420,We were on the east side one weekend morning during ROT rally and we drove past all the classic east side breakfast places and they all had lines wrapped around their buildings. So we checked yelp and found this gem.   This place is in a sketchy shopping center with a bingo hall and a work clothes store and the outside windows are covered in this silver reflective stuff  but we knew yelp couldn t be wrong- and it wasn t. The place was full of families enjoying their Sunday morning  and we soon found ourselves doing the same.   They had delicious aqua frescas  I had the lemonade  and the food was cheap and delicious. I love my breakfast tacos on fresh homemade flour tortillas and these didn t disappoint. The salsa was homemade also  and had a lot of flavor with a nice heat to it  The service was great and quick. I do believe I have found a new place to get my breakfast taco on 
Rosita's al Pastor,421,I can only speak for the taco stand  but it is one of the better taco stands in Austin.  It has really convenient hours of operation  and naturally has become one my favorite late night snacks.  It is exceptionally cheap  they have deals where you can get 4 of the same taco for 5 dollars  a really fantastic deal.    If I m getting the 5 dollar deal  I usually go for four pastor tacos  since I feel its their best taco  shocking  I know .  The meat is usually very tender  and I ve never felt my tacos were overcooked or charred.  Otherwise  I ll mix it up with some barbacoa  which is still above average quality.  My friend is a chicken taco guy  which I find really strange.  Regardless  he found the chicken tacos just ok.  If you re a poultry guy  then maybe this is a place to avoid.    I do want to point out that I ve been accosted twice by strangers here.  The first time was a homeless guy who was really intent on speaking Chinese to me.  His comical gibberish was definitely not Chinese of any sort  but I gave him a dollar anyway so I could eat my tacos in peace.  The other time was with a group  and a guy who announced he had just gotten out of prison tried to challenge us to a karate fight  which he punctuated by noting   Hey man I gotta thank you  I learned these moves from your kind.   The story is kind of irrelevant  but it did make me reconsider my late night snack runs  if only for a month or two.
Rosita's al Pastor,422,I don t know how this place has high reviews. I ordered about  14 worth of food- it was all terrible. Totally Bland non-authentic and nothing special.
Rosita's al Pastor,423,These tocos are the freakin bomb  I leave feeling satisfied every single time. The pastor is slow cook and is to die for. Also  its location is impeccable.  Location. Location. Location. This  along with there superb hot sauce and fresh made tortillas set this taco hotspot apatt from all others in the area 
Rosita's al Pastor,424,Absolutely delicious tacos al pastor. As a person who is from a border town and used to spend weekends eating pastor off a trompo  the big stacked thing the meat I cooked on  these are pretty close to hitting home. The truck  is open late anf highly recommended
Rosita's al Pastor,425,I literally only go to the food cart version of the restaurant but I go at least once a week because the tacos are sooo good. The service is speedy  cheap  and friendly. Major plus if you speak Spanish but not necessary. I ve never had a bad taco from them and usually drown my tacos in their salsa verde. Don t miss out on this little gem on Riverside.
Rosita's al Pastor,426,Wish it was good. It wasn t. Got the al pastor - the meat was dry. Like really dry. Won t be going back
Rosita's al Pastor,427,Simply phenomenal.  The food is delicious. Everything is cheap.  The staff is friendly.  What more could you ask for   I had never had al pastor tacos or gringas until i tried them here.  Needless to say  I will never go anywhere else     Flour tortillas  or corn if you prefer  with a goey array of cheeses spread over them  slow cooked meat that seems to melt in your mouth  cilantro and onions  and to top it off the sauces are BANGIN.  Try it  you ll be glad you did.
Rosita's al Pastor,428,I ve never been here and not waited in line. I ve been here at least 4 times and every time had been pretty good. The Al Pastor tacos have some weird red meat  but I always get at least one because they re pretty good. This stand is pretty cost efficient too. Giving the 4 stars because it usually takes quite a while to get the food  but nothing too crazy honestly. All the numbers are called in Spanish by the way  so I hope you remember basic numbers from grade school. There s a pretty sick view of downtown from here as well 
Rosita's al Pastor,429,Tasty  amp  Busy Food stand....Every 7 minutes some1 was pulling up to order something..The Food reviews live up to  amp  exceed expectations...grabbed several items  tacos  amp  gorditas..The Hype is right on this place  they take credit cards now also.
Rosita's al Pastor,430,Is there any reason why there are two listings for  Rosita s  Al Pastor   a href  http   www.yelp.com biz rositas-al-pastor-austin  yelp.com biz rositas-al-   a   The 5 star reviews are spot on when Rosita s is on their game  which is nearly always. However  completely dried out and tough meat is not unheard of.   4.5  rounded up  cards accepted inside  cash only at the truck 
Rosita's al Pastor,431,This food truck makes the BEST al pastor tacos in Austin. Good prices and even better green salsa. Soooo delicious  Highly recommended.
Rosita's al Pastor,432,I live near the food truck  and I ve returned many times for their tacos  especially the al pastor ones. Would definitely recommend   Tasty salsas too. The line can get long sometimes  but that s because soo many people like their tacos. If you want high-tech hipster  artisan  tacos  go somewhere else. But for about  2 for a taco of their quality  you really can t complain.
Rosita's al Pastor,433,I get the chicken fajita torta  because I m not a fan of the safety orange pastor meat they sell. And it s lacking in flavor. The torta is slightly off in bread to meat ratio. The prices are so so. I don t have high standards like other writers hence the 4 stars. It s Texas. That s your first mistake. Assuming texican food compares to southern California  or Mexico.  But for south Austin North Texico  it s on par. I will return regularly.
Rosita's al Pastor,434,I ve been to both the restaurant and the taco stand  the taco stand is amazing. I just moved from a different area of town and I ve eaten at plenty of places around Austin  these were the best tacos I ve had since I moved here two years ago. I ordered the barbacoa  pastor  and lingua. All were excellent  but the barbacoa and pastor had an excellent flavor. The flour tortillas were beautiful. Prices are great. Going to be back here all the time 
Rosita's al Pastor,435,The al pastor is obviously amazing  hence the name of the place. This also turned my boyfriend from a chicken taco lover into an al pastor taco lover. They know how to make a darn good taco. Lines are usually a little crazy  especially late at night. I would also suggest taking it to go. It seems like you get a little more food  and especially in the summer it can get really crowded and hot on those picnic tables.
Rosita's al Pastor,436,Just ate lunch at Al Pastor and it is incredible. To cover the negatives first  Don t expect the wait staff to keep checking up on you. It s good but minimalist service. Also  I don t like restaurants that only have soda by the can.  Despite those two things  I can t take a star away. I ordered the 4 al pastor tacos lunch special   5 . So good and the most authentic pastor tacos I ve had outside of interior Mexico.  I ll be returning for sure.
Rosita's al Pastor,437,I love Mexican food.  I will admit it here  but we came to Austin from San Diego 15 min from TJ.  We ve had some darn good tacos near the border.    So when we saw these reviews on Yelp  thanks Yelpers    saw that it was a hole in the wall  and when we walked in  and there weren t any other non-Mexicans around....this was gonna be good.  Our waitress recommended the al pastor tacos and that s what we had.  They were DEEE-LICIOUS.  And super cheap   and they were really nice   Don t let the strip mall look deter you.  You ll be missing out.
Rosita's al Pastor,438,First off the truck is definitely the way to go. Driving by you may not even notice this truck but it s definitely worth a stop. The tacos are great and super authentic. Haven t had a bad one yet in more than 5 visits but I love the carnitas. You may have to wait a little as they cook it all as you order  including tortillas but well worth it. Great first stop if you re on your way to watch a game at Midway or getting dessert at Churro Co after.
Rosita's al Pastor,439,I really wasn t super impressed with this place  taco stand .  I got an al pastor and a barbacoa taco and it was nothing special.  Pastor was pretty salty and barbacoa didn t have much flavor. Also they give you one tiny little hot sauce and charge you for extra which for someone like me that likes to slather my tacos in hot sauce was a disappointment and something most places in Austin don t do. I don t think I ll be back.
Rosita's al Pastor,440,Hands down best pastor tacos ever   My boyfriend and I like to the the gringa al pastor taco on flour they put cheese on it and it looks like they grill the cheese down to make it a bit crisp  I m drooling just thinking about it  Also we get the regular pastor taco on corn. Love to wash it down with a Mexican coke or Agua Fresca their lime one is yummy  
Rosita's al Pastor,441,This is as good as Tacos Al Pastor get in Austin  at least out of a truck. I m pretty sure about it.  If you like tacos al pastor  I challenge you to come here and not love these tacos.  The creamy salsa verde is great although I ve never found it to be very spicy unlike some others.
Rosita's al Pastor,442,This is actual MEXICAN food... so be prepared if you re used to more tex-mex or mexican-american type food. Google will also come in handy for translations if you aren t fluent in spanish or use to menus with real mexican food on it. Food comes out in a timely manner and honestly the most awesome thing about this place is their salsa bar  So many different options and fairly big cups to take some home in. You get your moneys worth when eating there just by doing this. Especially since some of the tacos are only a couple of bucks each.
Rosita's al Pastor,443,My family has been coming to the taco stand since it opened. My parents have been going there since the owner was helping customers  22 years ago. A couple of years ago I would of given this taco stand 5 STARS  But now  the pastor flavor of the meat has changed. That s the only reason we go  for the pastor   And tonight  my family and I decided to get some tacos. My dad was eating his tacos  amp  he found a piece of GLASS. Why was there a piece of glass in the middle of his taco  That s a health hazard  amp  I don t plan on going back. I don t know what to do about this glass I found because my dad found it while we were eating at home. They probably wouldn t believe us if we went back.
Rosita's al Pastor,444,This place is awesome   Pastor tacos were some of the best I ve ever had in my opinion. Very flavorful and delicious   I also had a fajitas taco... Again very tasty  If your looking for some authentic street style tacos  definitely check this place out  Price is great as well 
Rosita's al Pastor,445,Went at like 2 30AM this morning. So good     And not just cuz I was a lil tipsy. They made me a vegan taco that was SO BOMB  So yeah I m vegan and they were super accommodating. Mushrooms  romaine  avocado  beans  like and a lot more it was soooo good. AND THEIR TORTILLAAAASSS. NOM. And the size of the tacos were huge I loved it  Definitely my new late night go to on my way home   And no I don t drive so I wasn t driving while tipsy. I m responsible. Mostly... 
Rosita's al Pastor,446,Extremely tasty. Shady area  yes. Possible gang activity happening  yes. But the tacos are delicious   You can get 5 tacos for  6 on some nights. If you can look over the cleanliness factor  chicken bones on the floor  and the sketch happening around you  this place is worth a try 
Rosita's al Pastor,447,Best Mexican I ve ever had. I looked into the truck they are extra clean and their food is super healthy and fresh.
Rosita's al Pastor,448,Always amazing. The chalupas are loaded  fresh veggies and great service.
Rosita's al Pastor,449,We shared 5 tacos al pastor with pineapple and a horchata. Mmmmmm delicious  We also got a barbacoa which was pretty bland - stick with the al pastor for sure   Visited in 2013 
Rosita's al Pastor,450,This review is for the Al Pastor Taco Stand only  I have not been inside to the restaurant yet.  As other reviewers have mentioned this taco stand is not very gringo friendly.  They don t really speak any English at all  not that I care but it can be hard to order if you don t speak Spanish.  They also call out your order number in Spanish so just try to pay attention to where you are in line.  They will not make any attempt to make eye contact with you to let you know your order is ready.  Food wise  this stand was hit and miss for me.  The tortillas themselves are great  fresh hand made flour  harina  tortillas   This is rare so worth going for alone.  Their salsa are very authentic and spicy.  The orange one in particular was deathly hot.  The tacos I have tried   Tripas - Amazing  the best taco from here by far.  It had a nice chewy texture and the range of flavors was quite impressive.  Would definitely come back for this.  It seems to take a while to cook though.  Al Pastor - Despite this being in the trailer s name  it was dry and disappointing for me.  It also didn t come with any pineapple  after reading yelp I guess you have to ask them to add on the pineapple but I am not sure I could communicate that even had I known without speaking Spanish.  They definitely did not ask if I wanted any or not.  Chicharron - Another chicharron taco in town served without any sauce.  It was decent but there are better spots for chicharron locally.  Barbacoa - Decent.  It is not cheek meat but it was flavorful nonetheless.
Rosita's al Pastor,451,After reading all of the - unfortunately - hype below  I was really excited to head here and check out the tacos.  Whilst the service was nice  and the decor was as expected  nothing more than a shoddy looking  restaurant  on a strip of stores   the food was a disappointment.  The Al Pastor tacos that I received were inedible  with the pork being more reminiscent of coloured fat than any meat product that I had seen before. The tortillas were dry and hard. The cilantro had an odd bitter after taste. The only redeeming thing was their horchata.
Rosita's al Pastor,452,For the taco truck only.  Would not visit again  would not recommend.    Explanation  I have to disagree with some of the things I m reading here.  I ve spoken with locals and many say it s hard to find good Mexican food in Austin  but since I only saw hispanics siting at the tables I had high hopes.  Ordered 4 al pastor tacos  corn tortillas.  I will say that the tortillas were good  but the meat was lacking.  Being from SouthernCali  I have high standards for Mexican food.  The meat was dry and had barely much taste.  Al pastor should be FULL of flavor  as opposed to carne asada where IMO the salsa shines more.  The portions were TINY.  For  1.50  a truck taco should be packed considering they are saving money not dealing with the costs related to owning a building and all that entails.  The salsa verde was good though.  With all that said   8.50  I also got a jarritos mandarino  which was not cold.  My salsa was colder  no exaggeration  spent at a taco truck should have filled me up more.  I could have walked over to Churches Chicken and gotten 11 pieces of chicken for 70 cents more.
Rosita's al Pastor,453,Great pastor  not greasy like other local places. The beans have a great pork flavor you don t get at other places. The chips are just okay and the salsa is good. Will definitely be back.
Rosita's al Pastor,454,Food   flavorful  like a Mexican mom s home cooking    Location  E. Oltorf    SCARY   Restaurant   very clean and doesn t have that welcome to little Mexico quality   Cheese queso   tasted like cheep Sam s Club mega-jar-o cheese  no biggie   Two thumbs up   Will definitely go back.
Rosita's al Pastor,455,I believe they serve the best tacos al pastor in Austin  but there are few issues they should be really taking care of.  1  Always make sure to check your order and the portions  sometimes they only put an small  I repeat a very small amount of meat on your TACO  making the tortilla looks HUGE and yes  oh gosh  1 small piece of lime for 6 o 7 tacos  really    2   The tables are constantly dirty and nobody from the staff cares to keep and eye and clean them.  3   the prices are listed on the menu but they always  ALWAYS charged you  0.50 extra because they said there is a  0.50 c fee for TO-GO orders   which is not listed on the menu . And if even you said its for HERE  the will pack your food in a bag and give it to you as to go  just take a look in the trash containers  full of TO-GO boxes and bags. Since when any taco stand place charge for TO-GO orders    4   The area it s not the best  but constantly there are homeless people asking for help  and sometimes they stand just next to you waiting for something  I know it s sad  but the owner should make a deal with them  probably feed them as long as they don t bother the costumers  Hey  I mean they are making  0.50 extra per plate  right  
Rosita's al Pastor,456,No frills  good tacos served all day  including breakfast . The al pastor was great  I d definitely suggest ordering that 
Rosita's al Pastor,457,these are literally the best tacos in Austin I ve been going their for about since i was like 7 years old and now I m 24 years old so yeah just try them they are the number one and are open till 3 am
Rosita's al Pastor,458,Kind of getting sick of paying a different price each time I go here. One day my favorite taco is .50 more  one day it is .25 less. Then she mumbles something at the window about a rounding up policy. Nothing matches the menu price. I think it is cause I don t speak Spanish that they get me. Either way  the tacos are pretty good and consistent. Just sick of the fluctuations. As a note cheaper tacos half a block down.
Rosita's al Pastor,459,You can t go wrong with the standard al pastor taco plate here. Their meat has the perfect amount of heat and seasoning. Yum    They give you a large basket of chips and salsa if you eat in.
Rosita's al Pastor,460,My son introduced me to this place. I love it  It s not fancy but that doesn t affect the food. The Al Pastor tacos are awesome    I got them on corn tortillas with their famous pork and had avocado  cilantro and goat cheese...ummm...good   
Rosita's al Pastor,461,We read about this place in Bon Appetite and checked the Yelp reviews so based on the recommendations  we drove 6 miles out of our way to give it a try. We were underwhelmed. We ordered the chili relleno lunch special Al Pastor  which was a nice balance of coating and filling. The beans and homemade flour tortillas were fabulous. We also Ordered a taco trio of Al Pastor  Barbacoa and Chicharrone. The Al Pastor was tasty but a bit dry. The Barbacoa was under seasoned and pretty tasteless. The Chicharrone was flavorful  but the texture was gelatinous  soft and floppy. We had a hard time eating it.The red salsa and special green sauce were very good. Service was very efficient and pleasant. We were hoping for the tacos to blow us away and they were unfortunately just average.
Rosita's al Pastor,462,Oh gawd this place is good. If anyone is coming from out of town to visit you take them to this. I don t care if you re outside and it looks ghetto  these tacos  especially the pastor tacos  are the freakin bomb. Its also open wayyy late so its the place to go to when you get out of the club or bar 
Rosita's al Pastor,463,Best Al Pastor tacos in town   Don t be scared away by this trailers looks or location - this place is fantastic.  Authentic  tasty and the salsas are amazing 
Rosita's al Pastor,464,While in the midst of moving to Austin  I discovered this little gem near the Family Dollar. I was immediately welcomed and quickly presented with hot chips and yummy salsa. The service was impeccable.  The food pricing is reasonable and the portions are enough I had leftovers to take home. Every thing I had was hot  spicy and good.  I ll be back.
Rosita's al Pastor,465,I went here b c of Yelp...I was down in the neighborhood and thought I d give it a try.   It was okay...I got a torta...I forget which...and my biggest complaint is that there was way more bread than meat or other stuff for that matter.  The bread to filling ratio was all wrong.  BUT...with that said  the meet was good  as were the rest of the condiments on it...the bread was tasty  etc....just needs a better ratio  I think.
Rosita's al Pastor,466,This place is a great find. And  it is true what they say about good food at local dives. My friends and I are practically regulars  having been here so often. It feels nice to be recognized and welcomed.  When you are here  you can count on fast  friendly service  easy prices  and solid  comfort food. You can go there each work day and get something different because they have a couple of daily lunch specials. They always have the enchiladas  though. Very good enchiladas. And  you must and should try the green hot sauce  particularly if you are a heat fan. It packs a decent wallop.
Rosita's al Pastor,467,Don t let the nearby surroundings fool you. The best Al Pastor is at the truck.
Rosita's al Pastor,468,Its ok. I don t like how thick the tortillas are. Overall good selection and some good quality meats. I only do flour and its very important for them to be soft and not too thick.
Rosita's al Pastor,469,I knew this place was a dive so I didn t expect much in atmosphere.  I  was wanting something somewhat healthy so I had the tortilla soup. Flavor wise it was above average   however  in my attempt to make it spicier  I asked for pico de gallo.  They brought it out but with no jalape os. Who makes pico without jalape os   
Rosita's al Pastor,470,Best TACOS  breakfast and regular  IN TOWN. Skip Torchy s cause that place is garbage compared to these traditional street tacos. You can literally see them making the tortillas inside the tiny trailer. Chorizo is delish  of course the Al Pastor is a must. Highly recommend if you re an out of towner seeking the infamous Austin taco experience....
Rosita's al Pastor,471,I only ate at the food truck  and I can certainly recommend it. Bad ass pastor  and a true contender breakfast taco. Do not miss the house flour tortillas here  they are kick ass.  The salsas  especially the fatty-emulsion seeming red one  add great interest. I ll be coming back here when I m in the neighborhood  for sure.
Rosita's al Pastor,472,I ve been going here since 1998 and cannot get enough of their tacos al pastor.  I just dined in for lunch today  glanced at the menu as usual  but I already knew what I was really there for.  Brought an order back for a co-worker who s never tried one  and her response after  inhaling  4 of them was that they were  THE BOMB    They go great with a Mexican Coca Cola or a Jarritos.  I have to drive from downtown to either pick-up an order of them or dine-in at least once every two or three weeks to satisfy my craving.  2 thumbs up.
Rosita's al Pastor,473,Love love this  BEST GRINGAS EVERR  taco de tripa yummmy      On Homemade flour tortillas are the best after my dads of course I gave a four stars because they have some rude ass employees  also the last two times i went and  I go every Sunday   I been missing one taco  but I always go back for those GRINGAS    I m in love yes they should work in their employees.
Rosita's al Pastor,474,The pastor tacos on homemade flour tortillas are the best tacos I ve had in Austin so far.  I ve gone back many times and it s worth noting that there are minor issues with consistency.  It can taste a little different depending on when you go  some days the meat is on the dry side  sometimes greasy  sometimes perfect   but it s always good.  The tortillas are thick  tender and delicious.
Rosita's al Pastor,475,Maybe I m just a gringo with a preference for the gringo taco joints. Rosita s seems authentic and had a big following at lunch time. But the pastor tacos were just a small serving of well-spiced  but somewhat tough meat  surrounded with a sprinkling of onions and cilantro  and wrapped up in a pretty tough flour tortilla. I didn t see what all the fuss is about. Good agua fresca though.
Rosita's al Pastor,476,I challenge you to find a better more affordable taco al pastor in Austin.  Yes  it is situated in a trailer in the parking lot of a bingo parlor  with a check cashing place and questionable Chinese restaurant  but no matter.  They have picnic benches facing the under-transformation Riverside Drive where you can watch high rise condos being built.
Rosita's al Pastor,477,Best breakfast tacos in town....tacos in general really.  So good.  I dream of these tacos.  The homemade flour tortillas are divine.  It s cheap  fast  and amazingly tasty.  I love all the breakfast tacos  also the Al Pastor and Barbacoa.
Rosita's al Pastor,478,I like this place when I m a bit short on time because it is close to where I work.  They make their own tortillas here and that makes everything taste so good.  I love their al pastor tacos 
Rosita's al Pastor,479,The name says it all...this place s al pastor is bomb dot com. By far the best  4 taco plate I ve eaten in Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,480,When newcomers ask me about the BEST Mexican restaurant in town  as much as I hate to let the  secret  out  it is Rosita s Al Pastor Restaurant. The al pastor tacos on corn with cilantro  onions and pineapple with lime and verde sauce is out of this world  You don t have to go into the restaurant. There is a trailer in the parking lot. Best el pastor in Austin.
Rosita's al Pastor,481,The best true Mexican tacos I ve had in Austin. If you re looking for an authentic experience  this is it. I always get a lengua  barbacoa or pastor taco on flour tortillas  which they make fresh. Nothing beats a taco with just meat  onions  cilantro  lime and hot sauce. The lengua meat is sooo tender. Also the best horchata I ve gotten anywhere  the perfect thing to wash down your tacos with. Also  what I ve heard  The truck is better than the restaurant.
Rosita's al Pastor,482,menudo was good.  just how she likes it.  not too salty and lots of fresh stuff to dump in it.  the salsa  we liked it.  tacos al pastor  good   but not the most authentic I ve had.  good and crispy.  love the crispy bits.  no pineapple.  and the marinade ...  not as much annatto and maybe not as much vinegar or citrus juice as I d prefer...  the meat didn t have that bright orange color.  it was more of a brown.  I d defenitely go back.  but the best al pastor I ve had so far in tx was in san antonio.    almost forgot  the micheladas   they are served here with no ice.  they were good  worth trying to see if you prefer yours with ice or no ice.
Rosita's al Pastor,483,Fantastic food. Real deal Mexican food at bargain prices. Great green   jalape o  Dona  salsa.
Rosita's al Pastor,484,Ridiculously good al pastor and tortas  Just felt like saying it again  I love this place 
Rosita's al Pastor,485,key  assuming a full circle equals 100    x  percentage of clientele at 3 AM on a Saturday who are not native Spanish speakers y  percentage of clientele speaking horrible  Spanish  riding in a Volvo SUV  and ironically noting that they might be too high to remember Lil  Wayne lyrics. z  percentage of satisfied customers  loaded with  umm  al pastor tacos and Jarritos.                                .    .     .       .                              .     .     .                 .                        .     .     .                          .                     .  x .  y .  z                           .                    .      .     .                            .                       .      .     .                      .                          .      .     .                .                                .    .      .       .
Rosita's al Pastor,486,Unique experience for some damn good al pastor tacos.  Located in front of a bizarre shopping center with a bunch of Mexi-clubs  I have to say it was a little scary seeing a stray cat crawl into the area they were making my food and jump on the counter before being shoo-ed away.  All my fears went away when I sat in my car  no seating there  and bit into that tender taco.   This place is what it is  and that is pure pastor excellence.
Rosita's al Pastor,487,You ve seen how most taco stands and taquerias in Austin tend to do tacos al pastor  nondescript brown chunks of pork  seemingly stewed-- not cut from a skewer  as should be the norm--and sometimes garnished lightly with chopped pineapples. A pretty reliable  if unspectacular order that generally tastes the same at most places  with the exception of a few outliers.  When I heard about Rosita Al Pastor  a family restaurant tragically tucked away in a massive  unattractive strip mall on the 1900 block of East Riverside  I was intrigued. A restaurant so dedicated to the pursuit of turning out excellent al pastor that they included it in the name  What did this mean for the rest of the menu  Was al pastor all they served  to the neglect of other fine Mexican meats  How could I have driven by this place for years without ever having noticed it    Well it turns out that Rosita s offers a full-service menu that features the usual lineup of tortas  tacos  including some damn fine egg and potato   burritos  gorditas  etc. that you can mix and match as you please with assorted meats  I don t remember seeing carnitas -- why is carnitas exceedingly ubiquitous in California and so hard to find in Texas   However  you would be remiss if you did not pair any of these entrees with Rosita s crown jewel  smoky  bright red strips of tender  savory pork  bursting with flavor --true al pastor that I m fairly certain is sliced piping hot off a skewer. Topped with some freshly chopped white onions  cilantro  and Rosita s house salsa verde  these tacos are pretty much perfect  I think. What s the secret ingredient that gives the pork that brilliant red zest  Maybe we ll never know. I ve only seen al pastor of this hue in Mexico  and come to think of it  chorizo as well. Maybe someone more enlightened can bring me up to speed as to why that is.   On my first visit  I ordered three tacos al pastor on both corn and flour tortillas. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the warm  fluffy texture of the flour tortillas far surpassed the corn tortillas  and I m usually a corn man. So don t be afraid to be a gringo and ask for flour...it s worth it  For what it s worth  my friend ordered his al pastor on gorditas. I looked wistfully at his plate  as it seemed that he was given a larger portion of meat. Your mileage may vary. My meal came out to less than  6  if I remember correctly.  From the looks of  the restaurant s easy-to-miss East Austin location  its impossibility to locate on the Internet  I couldn t find it on Google Maps or Citysearch   and the halting English spoken by the generally polite  if reserved waiters  Rosita s remains a well-kept  secret  on East Riverside  yet to be overrun by Austin s growing contingent of internet chowhounds in search of cheap eats. Heck  I wasn t even sure if it was a real place. But now I can affirm that it indeed exists and is not to be missed. Give it a try 
Rosita's al Pastor,488,...  In my eyes  the BEST taqueria in Austin   I ve been going there for probably 12 years.   Quiero dos tacos al pastor  con cilantro y cebolla  en tortillas de harina por favor...  y una horchata para llevar.   Their tacos al pastor are absolutely to die for  and I ve had pastor tacos in numerous taquerias  and their salsa is awesome    Located next to a gigantic Bingo venue on the eastside of town  it s a hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly staff.  These days  at least one member of the staff can speak English  but if not pointing works really well too.   o In the evening  they open a stand next to the street for the late-night party goers.  You won t be dissapointed.
Rosita's al Pastor,489,Food truck awesome.... Restaurant very dirty...I prefer the food truck 100 times more...
Rosita's al Pastor,490,This is the best kept secret in Austin  so I should probably shut my trap and not tell everyone about how authentically good it is. Actually  if I share this secret gem  I m going to ruin it for everyone. Oh god  why am I still typing   I can t stop myself  This place is just freaking amazing  and I ll shout it from a rooftop  but please don t all go there and make it one those  wait in lines  kind of places. It s good enough to command a line of people daily  but it s not usually that busy. Yet. Oh god. What have I done 
Rosita's al Pastor,491,How is it possible that a taco stand can serve the most delicious thing on earth   I love this place.  Seriously  I would live happily for ever if all I ate were tacos al pastor from this little joint on East Riverside.  They re always open  or at least whenever I want a taco  and so inexpensive. The pastor is never grizzly and nasty like it can be sometimes  nor is it ever overcooked and dry. Always just right.
Rosita's al Pastor,492,I ve been struggling to find Mexican food in Austin that holds up to my hometown of San Antonio. This place is starting to renew my faith in Austin Mexican food. The al pastor tacos are flavorful and delicious  especially with the green salsa. Service is quick. Can t beat 3 of these tacos for  5  unless it s 5 tacos for  5 on a week night .
Rosita's al Pastor,493,Over-hyped  folks.  OVER-hyped.  Seriously.  After reading some of these reviews  I went here expecting magic.  I thought that I d bite into a taco al pastor  and my taste buds would sing.  Instead they let out one big MEH.   I m from San Antonio.  I KNOW good tacos.  There are places in SA  where the tacos will literally make you dance for joy and appreciation.  That s just how we do in SA town.  These tacos though   Meh.
Rosita's al Pastor,494,The AL pastor tacos were dry and the tortillas were hard and barely chewable. None of the food my group received was fresh. Our server ignored our dirty plates when we were finished eating  and I had to ask another person for the check  after waiting 15 minutes after we were done. This was a horrible eating experience. If I could give it negative stars I would.
Rosita's al Pastor,495,I love tacos and I know tacos. These are the best al pastor tacos in Austin  I ve searched high and low for some authentic al pastor  since moving here two years ago. I m glad I finally found them. This is not a tex-mex truck restaurant...this is Mexican food at it s best. Nothing fancy and all things delicious.  Their green salsa is on point 
Rosita's al Pastor,496,Order the house speciality  al pastor on corn  Both of the sauces are delicious  You may have some regrets from last night  but you won t the next morning if you go here.
Rosita's al Pastor,497,First trip to Austin for Eeyore s Birthday party this past weekend and I did not have a clue where to eat but was craving some good Tacos de Pastor and I m so glad I found this recommendation by yelp  Yeah it might not be in the best looking part of town  but it s not the worst looking either. My friend said it looked ghetto but oh boy where we pleasantly surprised when we walked into the restaurant. It actually looked nice  Okay now on to the food   I had tacos and a chalupa  which is WAY different than your Taco Bell Chalupa  LoL  and my friend had a Cuban Torta. Food was Great  and the service was timely even during a busy lunch hour. The cashier waitress told me to have a Great Sunday  so she was super friendly. I would definitely go check this place out again next time I m in Austin  TX
Rosita's al Pastor,498,I pretty much lived off of Rosita s during my final year at UT.  After coming home from a night on the town  my friends and I would always stop at Rosita s taco stand for some of the greatest al pastor tacos in Austin.  Luckily for us  they were also very easy on the pocketbook.  If we were a little hung over the next day  we d drop my the restaurant and have some of Rosita s tortilla soup.  The horchata also hits the spot  especially after sampling their killer salsa.  The location might be a little intimidating for some  but that s never kept me away from good food.  My go-to place for cheap  tasty  authentic tacos.
Rosita's al Pastor,499,Al Pastor is the sole thing I miss about living off of Riverside. Yes  I ll make the u-turn to grab an Al Pastor taco before going out  Definitely my favorite taco trailer in Austin. This place is delicious and cheap. What more could you ask for 
Rosita's al Pastor,500,Taco food truck  Yes please  I didn t want to leave Austin without finding one  so we stopped here on our way to the airport...how convenient  I got 2 to go  and enjoyed them in the airport before my flight home. The only mistake I made was buying only two... Until next time  Austin 
Gabriela's Downtown,1,My party of 20 visited Austin for a conference. We were hosted at a happy hour elsewhere with no food options. After a quick google and Yelp search I found this gem.  Alex was so helpful and accommodating.  They were able to seat us almost immediately  albeit  separately but that s ok. The business is a testament to the quality of this place.   Our server  Priscilla  and the rest of the staff were so helpful  made recommendations that win and we had a DJ.  We sat in the patio in a cold evening but we would never realize because the heaters and delicious libations made us forget it was late November.    Great job.  This is on my list of places to visit when I visit ATX
Gabriela's Downtown,2,The atmosphere  great for first date or large parties.  The drinks are a ten  10 . Food  mediocre.   Gabriela s is not the place to go when hungry. It s the place for great drinks  get-to-know-you botanas and pre party feels.   Come thirty.
Gabriela's Downtown,3,I wasn t sure what to expect from Gabriela s South Austin  but I had a nice time. I highly recommend grabbing a table on the back patio for the full experience. The music  there was a dj   lights  and decor set a great vibe  The waiter was incredibly busy  but still pleasant and answered all my questions.  Food  The food was better than anticipated. I got the steak tacos on flour tortillas. It came with rice  beans  and a side of salsa. I m not running back for the food  but I d be willing to order from the menu again. It s tasty enough. The steak was pretty flavorful.   Other  The parking is awful. Be prepared to park on the surrounding streets with metered parking. There is a ton of construction happening next to the restaurant  so it s easy to overlook it.
Gabriela's Downtown,4,I love the food and drinks here. Chips and salsa comes with so many options. We had the birria tacos and they are so good. The only downfall of this location is the parking situation.
Gabriela's Downtown,5,I don t know what more I can add about Gabriela s that hasn t already been said before besides the fact that I ve been here twice in two weeks. That s just how good it is. The service both times has been efficient and friendly. The food is absolutely delicious and the portion sizes are definitely enough for two meals. So far I have tried their mole enchiladas  choriqueso  Al pastor tacos  and multiple margaritas and all have been made to perfection. The happy hour deals are also really good  Their patio area is screened in now so it s warm with the heat lamps that they placed all around. Parking is a bit of a hassle so the best bet is to find street parking nearby.
Gabriela's Downtown,6,Had a friend visiting from Florida. Wanted to show her around Austin. Gabriela s was in our list. I really love their food and cocktails. Parking is a nightmare. But we figured it out. When you re seating on the back porch area you can see the state capital  which is a nice view. It s definitely the place to be on a weekend night. It was packed  the DJ was jamming. It was a great time. Had 2 tacos  which I thought I could finish  I was starving. But  at last  I had to call it quits. Really juicy meat and crunchy veggies. Tortilla is so fresh. Can t wait to come back. Maybe check out their other location.
Gabriela's Downtown,7,I walked pass it at first  it s a little hidden if you re not local to Austin. But its pretty  The food is pretty good  can t complain.  The only inside is a little small though  I felt crunched in  I couldn t come here with more than 3 people..
Gabriela's Downtown,8,So we were out and about and my wife says...hey I want some Beria tacos ...I m like let s do that...and we looked at some of our bookmarked spots.. BOOM..landed at Gabriela s.   Let me tell you up front...parking is let s say a bit of a challenge...no parking near the restaurant...so it s street parking one block over.  Next point is the spot is small so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  That said  we got there right on time and were able to be seated right away..  The environment- it s pretty typical of a small taco spot... limited seating indoors and a nice patio in the back.  The place is pretty clean and the staff was on top of their game...move from the table cleaning begins...its indeed a place you come grab the food and bounce   The Order-when we got there it was just the brunch menu and it was pretty straight forward...Biria tacos for all...but first let s get some of that tequila libation flowing lol...the Margaritas were nice and my wife had a Mangonata...a frozen mango drink with chamoy...it was pretty tasty as well.  We did order the Shrimp ceviche...it was plentiful had the right amount of kick and chunks of shrimp  The mains I ordered 3 a la carte Biria tacos and the consume - pro tip.. don t go this route it s more expensive  My wife and daughter ordered the Biria taco plate which included 2 tacos rice and beans...the beans were really good...you could taste the love  The rice was good as well and the tacos...plenty of tasty meat with cheese melted through...and of course you MUST dip the taco in that consume...which was hot with a touch of spice and richness.  Strong recommendation for this spot...you will not leave hungry or disappointed in any way...we will be back again and again 
Gabriela's Downtown,9,A very good chill and Lowkey spot with amazing food and amazing service. It was great to finally experience the well talked about spot.
Gabriela's Downtown,10,Delicious  authentic tacos. Good margaritas. They have great happy hour deals. Love the atmosphere of this place.
Gabriela's Downtown,11,I think Gabriela s is a solid four star restaurant.   The server  hosts  amp  other staff were all very nice.   The view of downtown is a great one    The patio can get pretty loud so I d just keep that in mind. They did seem to accommodate for large tables nicely.   Choriqueso was more than enough for two of us  it did not get finished.   The gringas Al pastor was delicious  just as described  a cheesy quesadilla.   The drinks weren t worth mentioning.  I personally probably wouldn t come here again  was fun to check out though.
Gabriela's Downtown,12,Came here for brunch on Sunday at 1130 and we were able to walk in without any wait.  This is a great plus for brunch on Sundays.  The drinks were amazing   I had the margarita flights and it was so good   I got the birria tacos with queso and that was a great choice.  I never had birria tacos before so I m not sure if it s particular good or not but it was still f ing delicious   My friends really liked the music there and complained that there s not a dance floor.  The only down side is the parking situation.  There s no parking but street parking and it s right by I-35.  Overall I would say this is a great brunch place and I can t wait to come back again for brunch
Gabriela's Downtown,13,Cool vibe for pre-gaming. Wouldn t recommend if you are actually interested in the food or want dessert.   Their parking is pay to park- but if it s before 7pm you can park under I35 and make the very short walk.
Gabriela's Downtown,14,Thus was my 1st visit ...and let me start by saying this place is super cute  but the parking is terrible  Thanks to Austin construction  just park around the corner it s metered  But this place is still worth the trip great outdoor patio in front and back  service was good  food was excellent..drinks were also perfect... I will definitely go back    Get there early they get crowded and it s a small place.
Gabriela's Downtown,15,This joint definitely was firing on all cylinders for our visit when it come to food ...The parking would get zero stars....BUT after trying the food I will take what I can find. We were here for the wifes BDay  16th  and its a really cool. Place. Driving by you could never tell its an old house converted into a restaurant. Service was ok  and we Both hope Daniela was just having a bad day. The food made up for everything. Salsa Sampler is an absolute must along with the Choriqueso. And if you have room...The Elote was dang good as well ...Wife went with the Chipolte Enchiladas and I the Avocado Cream Enchiladas...We both agreed the rice was excellent and I loved my beans. Both dish as great flavor with tender filling and they were packed. The one thing that threw me in the photos before coming here....What is that brown stuff on top of the Chiladas  ..Sauce   ...Nope....Crispy burnt Cheese...YES ...We are closing in on 200 different Mexican joints in the last 10 years  and THIS is how you set yourself apart from others. Added another layer of flavor and texture. Overall visit was outstanding....and we will be keeping an eye out for when construction wraps up  but more then likely we will visit the south location next.
Gabriela's Downtown,16,We visited Gabriela s for a friend s birthday brunch. The drinks and food were so fun and delicious as well. The decor and music made for a social  fun brunch. Our server was attentive. Can t wait to go again 
Gabriela's Downtown,17,We were visiting from Houston to celebrate our anniversary and this was one of the places on my list to visit. After we checked in on a Monday we headed here for happy hour which is from 3-6p M-F. We got there a little before 4 there was no wait we were greeted by the friendly host we wanted to sit at the bar since we were just having drinks and an appetizer. The bartender Marco was very nice great customer services he made sure we were taken care of the whole time. I only had Gabby s margarita which was so good with just the right amount tequila. My boyfriend tried the micheHelada pop and mangonada margarita he liked the margarita the most. We had choriqueso as an appetizer which was authentically delicious. Would recommend especially for happy hour we will have to come back and try some of their food and the margarita flight 
Gabriela's Downtown,18,I m so glad my friends and I came across this place on Yelp  We were staying in Austin for a couple of days and heard how Austin has some of the best TexMex and Mexican food so we knew we had to try it. We sat inside because it was a bit too hot outside but the inside was so cute and fun. I checked and they had a nice outdoor seating area on the back patio. We split the choriqueso which came with 3 homemade tortillas and chips. Literally the best queso I ve ever had       The queso wasn t creamy like traditional queso we are used to seeing. Rather it was a more like baked cheese in an iron skillet that comes out hot and bubbling. So so good  I ordered the avocado cream enchiladas which were delicious but I would have to say that I wish they covered it in less of the avocado sauce. It was a bit too yogurty and creamy for my liking. Other than that  everything else was amazing  I tried the asada tacos and the steak was so tender and flavorful. Next time I m in Austin I m going to make it a point to go back here   
Gabriela's Downtown,19,This place is crackin  Music is really good.  Well oiled machine. Staff is welcoming and attentive.  Although we were told 45 min wait  we only waited for 20 min.  The menu is small  but has something for everyone.  I had Gordita s off the brunch menu.  Eh. I wouldn t get it again.  The beans were really good  spicy.  I tasted  a piece of the French toast.  That was amazing   Almost dessert like.  It s a fun place for brunch.
Gabriela's Downtown,20,The food was good  not great  but the service was sketchy. Had to find waiter for check and drinks and water. The drinks were tasty. Can t say I d go back .
Gabriela's Downtown,21,Just left Gabrielas and had another amazing meal  So far I have only been for brunch and have not had to wait to be seated. The birria tacos were so amazing and full of flavor. The choriqueso was probably the best queso I ve ever had   To top it off  the margarita flight was a hit as well as the micheladas   I sat outside and loved the view of downtown as well as the DJ that was there playing a mix of top hits and reggaeton 
Gabriela's Downtown,22,Yes all day yes. We went first night in Austin  so much fun. The drinks were strong but very good. We got a mescal margarita  gabby s margarita and a frozen mango drink. We had the salsa combo and chorizo cheese dish to start and for dinner we got the mole chicken enchiladas  the steak gringas  and a bistek torta for my son. Everything was super except for the mole  it was just ok. This place also had a live dj and such a vibe. We listened to awesome music and just had fun.
Gabriela's Downtown,23,The food was worth the wait  The interior and exterior is aesthetically pleasing  so get your IG pics in. The restaurant itself is TINY  but there is a patio for additional seating.   Our table shared the choriqueso  which was a queso with spicy pork chorizo  guacamole  chipotle and tomatillo sauces  served with tortillas -- so cheesy  They have SO many drink options  margaritas  micheladas  beers  pitchers . We also shared the margarita flight which came with a gabby  mangonada  strawberry  and paloma marg. I think the flight was okay and next time  I would just get a mangonada. It was nice to try though   For food  I got the birria tacos and my bf got the migas. The tacos were good and filling  the meat was juicy and flavorful  It came with rice and beans on the side.   Our service was good as well. Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu.  Because its so close to downtown  you have to pay for parking. There is a lot right next to the restaurant and you can pay on your phone. I remember paying  10 or so for a 2 hour window.   Overall  it was a cute modern Mexican restaurant in downtown Austin 
Gabriela's Downtown,24,After stalking this place on TikTok and IG I finally made my way out here  I reside in Elgin  after a nice morning hike  me and a friend went here for lunch and drinks. There was a 30 min wait  which I m not surprised lol the service  drinks and food was BOMB   I would definitely recommend this place and will be back soon 
Gabriela's Downtown,25,Food was meh but the vibe was great. We went on the 4th and it s a party out back.  Drinks are served in an IV bag. I like the bloody beer--nice spice in the tomato mix. Also  the insta models fell off the ledge in the back made me laugh.
Gabriela's Downtown,26,At first we assume it be a small place to just have a simple dinner. But when we went in  it was nothing like outside. The beautiful colors of the theme in the walls and the paints along with the lights was just another level of great environment. The music was also very good vibes  We loved it. We wish they had this in Houston. We will definitely stop by every time we go to Austin again. It s a MUST now 
Gabriela's Downtown,27,The wait was long but that happens at restaurants I supposeTo be honest this food was worth the wait    I was hungry as all get out  so I asked the waitress what she recommended and she lead me down the right path y all. She recommended me the Enmoladas de Pollo. It. Was. Delicious. Everyone was upset they didn t order what I did.  Hairflips   The dish was enchilada with chicken  topped with some addictive creams or sour cream sauce  avocado  and a crispy cheese. Now I m a stickler for good rice and beans at a restaurants   and they delivered hereThe rice was good and the beans were delicious    Although I didn t order them  the tacos all looked amazing. The drinks were affordable  and a great variety. The queso was good  and our waitress was attentive and brought us everything we needed and asked for without slipping up once  and we had a big group   The DJ outside was banging. I was impressed and will definitely be back here 
Gabriela's Downtown,28,This place is so hyped up on Insta that I had to come see what it s all about. And tbh  I respect what I ve read of Gabriela as an entrepreneur.   The experience didn t match the expectations. First  everyone looked stoned and no one wanted to help with any kind of service. For a moment  I thought  we re already living in a zombie type world. The staff was standing against the walls at different areas and staring into space.   The margaritas were meh - not much flavor. The queso was the only highlight of the evening.  Oh  be prepared to pay  7 hr for their private parking.
Gabriela's Downtown,29,Food was delicious but home girl server def could have used some help. She was great still though but maybe slammed. The birria tacos were bomb and the music was popping   Large drinks too.
Gabriela's Downtown,30,Food is tasty. We enjoyed the music and the DJ was fun. Tacos and guacamole was pretty good and the drinks were super impressive. They do not hold back on the tequila
Gabriela's Downtown,31,Guys don t go here I am Texican born and raised this place is meant for tourist. I paid 36 dollars for four aguas frescas...The total bill was  85 dollars for two adults plates and a kids meal. The food was edible not good. It was not authentic Mexican. If you want an instagram pic and paid a ridiculous amount of money for basic food this is your place.
Gabriela's Downtown,32,In love with this place  food is amazing and staff is super friendly     just the vibe we needed to kick off our vacation in Austin. The food was amazing and the drinks of course is the best part   I definitely recommend to come here for a good time. The choriqueso is again...AMAZING    they also have street corn as an appetizer and let me tell you  you will NOT be disappointed. This place was everything I expected and more.
Gabriela's Downtown,33,Such a cute place  and the food is good  too  I went here with a group of 4 on a Friday evening and got seated almost immediately. They don t have complimentary chips and salsa  but it s worth the  5 to try their various salsas as an appetizer. My group had the tacos al pastor  asada tacos  shrimp ceviche  and chicken enchiladas  and everyone liked what they ordered. I would go back to try the margaritas.
Gabriela's Downtown,34,I love this place so much the food is just so good and our server Pricilla was the best she was such a sweetheart 
Gabriela's Downtown,35,Priscilla was the BEST serviee ever. She is awesome and her kindness is the best. I have never got the best service till I met her 
Gabriela's Downtown,36,Food is a little 1 dimensional  the charro beans aren t very flavorful or soft so I don t think they are over cooked just poorly seasoned. The black retried beans are good and super kid friendly. Overall the downtown location is great for families  a nice patio  with kid like food.  The guac was basically just avocado and cilantro. Not cool bro.
Gabriela's Downtown,37,First time at this place  visiting Austin  Went for my sisters bday brunch. Vibe is young and hip as they had a DJ set up playing nonstop. There were all ages tho  Margarita flight is worth the  20 in my opinion. Couldn t taste the strawberry one pictured due to allergies so pawned it off. However  the gabby marg with the flower was my  1 choice as I ordered that one after the flight and the table favorite as well. Paloma marg was my second fav.   Not pictured  the champagne bottle with orange juice. Provided with ice and cups - not a bad gig for a bottle of champ and orange juice. OJ is pulpy if you aren t into that.   Honestly got so full on the queso  had to take my leftovers home. Barrio tacos are good  very filling and served with beans and rice.   Cute decor inside and out for pics and aesthetic as it s bright pink. Line for bathroom can be long hehe
Gabriela's Downtown,38,If you are missing the taste of Mexico or want to experience Mexican food  come here   The food and drinks we ordered were outstanding. I was shaking my head while eating because each bite was delicious.  If you are looking for a fancy  this is not the place. But if you are into flavors  then  checkout Gabriela s 
Gabriela's Downtown,39,Love this place.  We were doing a show at the Hilton and decided to venture off into finding happy hour.  Ran into Gabriela s and found the right place.  The bartender did not disappoint   She took care of us and made sure we always had a drink.  She was great to talk to and everyone seemed to love her.
Gabriela's Downtown,40,Disclaimer  you have to pay for parking.  Found this place because of TikTok  it s definitely one of those places that is very aesthetically pleasing. The food is also pretty good and the drinks are so different and good  The waiter we had was very kind and was very attentive and helpful 
Gabriela's Downtown,41,It was a bit of a wait  but don t fear. Grab a marg or two and chill out front with good company. That s what we did  The food was phenomenal  No joke I ate every bit of it and really wanted more. Great vibes and a cool DJ 
Gabriela's Downtown,42,Food was cold  charro beans was the only hot item I got that tasted fresh. Queso was also cold. I ordered the fajita tacos that had no seasoning and were also cold. I was not impressed. I have to say my first bite was trying a spoonful of Mexican rice that tasted like soap. It was very odd. It seems this restaurant just doesn t get as much tlc as the other.
Gabriela's Downtown,43,Went here for happy hour   The site is currently under heavy construction so we had to park relatively far away. But margaritas were okay. But the queso was awesome   Great deal for happy hour.
Gabriela's Downtown,44,Aesthetic  Yes. Food  Eh. Service  Eh.  Let s start with the pros.   Short wait time  appetizer came incredibly fast and tasted great  server was kind  though lacked some attentiveness  but I understand he might have been overwhelmed.   Cons made this place a 6 10 for me.   Drinks took way longer than it should have when ordered from the bar while waiting for our table. Over 20 minute wait.   I ordered a mimosa with my meal. Tell me why it was served HOT. Yes  champagne was warm. Hard no. A mimosa should NEVER be luke warm. I asked an employee if I could please get it cold  they brought it back the same -- warm. Plus  it was served in a 9oz plastic cup ..   I ordered the pancakes. Though they tasted great  they were incredibly dry. The cajeta and lecherita drizzle on them was very very light. They barely drizzled anything on it. When we asked our server for syrup for my friend s French toast and my pancakes  he said they didn t have syrup. Um    You really gon serve pancakes and French toast but have no syrup         Okay.   Our server took a while to come check on us after our meal was served. I had to munch on the sides and even the app because I couldn t start on the pancakes without syrup or a mimosa  which both failed . In the service industry  it is standard to check on your guests after they take the first two bites of their meal.   We sat indoors for our meal and it was very hot. I was sweating while eating. It was fresher outside in 99 degree weather.   Music was great. Though I didn t mind  I know some people would  music was loud and had to yell over it during conversations.   Regardless  I recognize the employees because I know it s not entirely their fault for the cons. They re hard workers. Working in such little space and with so many guests  I can see why they struggle to provide the best service.   Would I come here again  No.   As a Latina myself  I support Gabriella and believe she is a kick ass female. I m all for it. However  I have noticed these inconsistencies happen in a lot of her places. Revival Coffeeshop for example  Gabriella s South location  Taquero Mucho   amp  Seareinas. I ve had bad experiences at all of them. Whether their food lacks or the service is poor  it s always something.   These places are so focused on aesthetic that they forget how to provide a full experience to guests. They are so focused on marketing only to get people through the door and deliver  excuse my words  half ass service. It should not just be about making things look pretty. It should be about the experience because at the end of the day  our money is the one going into their pockets.   As a Latina who lives in Austin  I m glad I ve experienced them  but they truly did not live up to the hype. The employees lack training and better management and it shows. They all have the potential to be amazing. Great potential. Hope it gets better    xx  Gabby
Gabriela's Downtown,45,This place is amazing   I highly recommend To everyone. They have some great Mexican food and awesome drinks. I really like the DJ playing music as well   I ll be back
Gabriela's Downtown,46,I love this place  amp  it s vibe  Come for food and drinks and leave with a good time  it s also the closest to authentic Mexican food. The queso birria tacos are some of the best in Austin  
Gabriela's Downtown,47,Gabriela s lives up to the hype. Food and drinks were all amazing. The patio is so great but it was so hot we had to sit inside and that didn t seem as festive. Will come back for the patio 
Gabriela's Downtown,48,The food is pretty good but the Best thing to order at this restaurant is the drinks. There are margaritas are outstanding regardless of their are frozen or on the rocks. The appetizers are extremely limited but tasteful and the entr es are flavorful but could use a little bit more zest. Overall I love this experience you are in a semi-garden nest environment rooftop that looks over the downtown area of Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,49,this is a nice trendy place. Great atmosphere the presentation of food and drinks are great  Unfortunately the food is ok.
Gabriela's Downtown,50,Food was good and came out quickly. Vibes are good- classic Austin... service was honestly the worst I ve had in a while  so do with that what you will.
Gabriela's Downtown,51,The restaurant is quite authentic. Our food choices were good with ample size.  The waiter was appropriately attentive and we left satisfied. The clientele is broadly eclectic which told us the food would be good as it attracted everyone.
Gabriela's Downtown,52,The food is spectacular. So very good and I wasn t sure two tacos would do it for me but they re very full and very flavorful. Absolutely loved my meal and the guac and salas were delicious as well. A very nice serving of guac too.  It was so loud on the back patio so if you plan to sit out there  be prepared to be yelling rather than talking if they have the DJ playing. Total vibe though. Definitely will come back.
Gabriela's Downtown,53,One of my favorite spots in Austin  Great for bachelorette parties  friends visiting from out of town or even for a date night. On the weekends it gets a bit more rowdy as there is always a DJ on the back patio. The views of the city are fantastic as well. The food is one of a kind  When I bring out of town visitors to Gabriela s  this is their favorite spot by far. Don t forget to try their margarita flights  
Gabriela's Downtown,54,Tip is added to tables 5 and more and our waitress didn t bother to talk  check up on us at all. We had to ask for refills  our check and to order by other waiters. We had a plate for shrimp that we brought to the waitress s attention that we did not like it and took 2 bites  but she did not what to take it off the bill after the waitress said she would  and again  we did not eat it. Sad  since we were having a good time. Just go somewhere else. Parking is horrible too.
Gabriela's Downtown,55,Went there for brunch with my wife and the starters were really mediocre  Aguachile  amp  Salsa Sampler . Decided to have food elsewhere afterwards  you can tell they cater to a specific clientele.   Shrimp Aguachile plate was overloaded with junk which really defeated the purpose of an aguachile.   Salsas had absolutely no flavor.   Michelada Pop was very run of the mill.
Gabriela's Downtown,56,Not the best lunch spot. Parking is a pain... had to park a block away and cross a busy street. We both ordered enchiladas and they were alright at best. Service was terrible. We will not be coming back  
Gabriela's Downtown,57,Amazing food Strong drinks Great service Beautiful location  Needs parking but it s Austin  
Gabriela's Downtown,58,Stopped here recently to try some new food now that I  am in Austin. This place was so much fun  from the drinks  to the food  to the atmosphere this is legit will you find people gramming  eating  and overall just having a good time  Seriously  just look at these photos if you don t believe me. So good   I got the shrimp aguachiles and immediately fell in love  For one the portions are HUGE  be prepared for some leftovers  and it had a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. It s got a bit of a kick  okay a lot of one  but it is all spice and flavor. Also EAT IT ON THE SALTINE CRACKERS IT COMES WITH  This makes all the difference  yummy  Would recommend if you were looking for something new to try   We also tried 2 drinks though they are super alcoholy but fun to drink. The mango one what is on that straw is dates and chili I think  So feel free to munch that right off  Definitely would come here again  I think they have a dj at night too which would be great for going out.
Gabriela's Downtown,59,Came all the way from Houston to see if the hype was all that and see if the food was delightful. The food was mediocre and the drinks were okay. Will I come again  Probably not. The aesthetic was the only thing that saved this place.
Gabriela's Downtown,60,Great food  great service  patio is where you should eat  Overall is was a great atmosphere and we ll diff be returning.
Gabriela's Downtown,61,I love a good aesthetic but let s be real  this place s food is horrible and their drinks are watered down. Only thing that the owner has right is decor but this restaurant is so below par in regards to actual food and drinks... 1 star for decor and nothing else.
Gabriela's Downtown,62,Have been to the South Park Meadows location plenty of times but first time at the downtown location. Food tasted good as always.  My go to are the chipotle enchilada and pineapple aqua fresca - so good   Very different vibe in the downtown location as compared to the South Park Meadows location. More quiet and chill here and the South Park Meadows location was more upbeat with loud music. Only down side about the downtown location would be hard to find street parking as expected for any downtown restaurant.
Gabriela's Downtown,63,Gabi s is a bori Cubana dream. Drinks de bad bunny  margarita flights  and bomb a  food  The service is super quick and they get busy super early  so go around 5-7p 
Gabriela's Downtown,64,Bartender was amazing  Food was amazing  Customer service was amazing  Drinks were amazing  Restaurant was pretty small. Not the fanciest. Bar was small also. But everything that was amazing made up for that. Also it s downtown Austin so it s expected.
Gabriela's Downtown,65,Wanted to start with parking is horrible at this location and you also have to pay to park so that s just a fyi.  Second of all my friends had gotten a table for us and were sitting there for about 10min. When my bf and I arrived  we attempted to order of the brunch menu at 2 30 and the waiter stated there maybe brunch options available but he wasn t sure. He never informed my friends that the kitchen closes in between 2 30-3 00 and does not reopen till 3 30 for their lunch menu.  Let me just inform you the brunch menu says it s till 3 00 The only food options available during that time will be appetizers. My bf asked to speak with the manager and the manager did not come but did inform the waiter that the only other food option is birria. We had already ordered our drinks so we went ahead and ordered the queso birria. I will say the birria plate was actually really good and the drink was fun. I m just more disappointed at the fact of the communication if the kitchen closes in between a certain time the host should have definitely informed my friends before even sitting them down at the table.
Gabriela's Downtown,66,What an amazing vibe at this place. Even tho it was a busy Sunday the staff did a great job. The food and drinks were great.
Gabriela's Downtown,67,The host was very rude when walking in and hesitated to have my family seated which was a party of 8. She was very unpleasant and didn t want to seat us and made a big deal about putting 2 tables together mind this is our first time here and visiting from our of town.
Gabriela's Downtown,68,I really liked this place for cinco de mayo  We got the flammable queso which was like a queso fundido and then tinga de pollo tacos. Both of the dishes tasted really good. They also had  5 margaritas and  3 shots for cinco de mayo. The only reason I m giving it 4 stars is that place had a lot of bugs and mosquitoes flying around which did disturb the eating atmosphere a bit.
Gabriela's Downtown,69,Amazing      Best tacos I have had in Texas     You can tell they are all homemade down to the tortilla. The beans given on the side were just to die for. Staff was so welcoming and it was just such a cool family vibe.
Gabriela's Downtown,70,Amazing spot  food  and service - except for the host guy who hates people and his job. Hire a new host that actually cares about customers 
Gabriela's Downtown,71,This is a cool spot for Saturday and Sunday brunch. The food is good  but the real winners here are the drinks  love the michelada and the margaritas   the music and the atmosphere. On nice days  there is almost always a wait and they don t take reservations  hence me not giving 4 stars . Luckily  I ve never had to wait too long  but it is something that has to be considered. Also  the parking is terrible  I recommend taking an Uber or car pooling.
Gabriela's Downtown,72,Long awaited Gabriela s in Austin we finally meet. We visited on a Saturday afternoon to try it out after seeing it on social media. Upon arrival we were told that the wait was about 45 minutes so we added our name to the list and looked for parking. Note there is no free parking around the restaurant however if you park at the residential streets nearby parking should be no more than  5 for 3 hours or less. After the 45 minutes were up  I approached the hostess stand to ask how much longer for a table where the hostess told us they were unable to locate my name and number and turns out they haven t added it to the list this whole time. To my discontent they quickly corrected their mistake and told us to sit at the nearest table that was vacant and they will be with us to take our order. After about 15 minutes or so our waitress began to take our drink order. I went for the Passion Fruit drink J Balvin unfortunately out of sunglasses just the drink alone. My wife ordered the Tamarindo Lindo  both drinks were on point where my review gets the points. Let s rate the services  lacked in the beginning however as the visit progressed the service got better. Now let s rate the food. We began with the Queso Fondido cheesy topped with a pico de gallo topping it was pretty good while the skillet was hot until it cooled off the cheese hardened. Now the entrees  I ordered the tacos asado which was very dry meat had no flavor tasted very bland the rice was good and charro beans ok too much onions. My wife ordered the torta Asados with cheese it was ok and her fries were too dry. Overall the drinks are good  atmosphere is awesome a lot of Instagram snapshot worthy photos to take however wouldn t be back for the food.
Gabriela's Downtown,73,Food is amazing   micheladas are a must the fruit one is my favorite as a snack also  enchiladas de chipotle deliciosas   great music and looks to downtown
Gabriela's Downtown,74,We stopped in because it was within walking distance from our hotel  and honestly  the only good thing was the Michelada. We ordered the quesoflameado   bistek torta  and the poppers sampler  and all of it was just awful. The ambiance was excellent  and the d cor was super cute but not worth the money.
Gabriela's Downtown,75,Such a fun place and delicious to boot  I ve been here several times now and enjoy it more each time.  Flavorful menu with so many options. The chicken creme enchiladas are delicious and the sauce is out of this world. You will not be disappointed with any drink you choose. The vibe is fun and upbeat  great for a party. We had a group of ten on the beautiful back patio for a 30th birthday.
Gabriela's Downtown,76,1st time here  Great atmosphere  music  drinks  amp  delicious food   Inside dining and outside patio. You have to try this place  
Gabriela's Downtown,77,This place was packed   it s more of a wanna be club ambiance   honestly the host was so unprofessional and drunk   I was ready to leave as soon as we got there  we waited in the entrance to be seated and a nice little  waitress said  walk in and head to the front they will sit you    so we did   and then the hostess asked  can I help you   while she held a margarita in her hand and sipping on it  I said  yes we need to be seated   the waitress said to come back here and find a table   she said  I don t know who told you that but no  we are not sitting anyone anymore  so I said ok   I m headed to walk out and my husband was being seated by another waitress  at this point I m upset and this hostess said  I guess you can stay  wow  So rude  I wanted to leave  but my kids and husband were hungry already... also people came after us and got seated   __  wow  I didn t want to order husband insisted  and also for me to change my attitude with those who serve our food.. I did   I m not a rude person   but I was being tested.. anyways our waitress was really nice. You do need to scan the menu  also the drinks and food is really good  they have music very loud which I normally enjoy but not this night.  If your single this is the place for you  so many singles are here drinking  and fair prices   food looks amazing   Note to self   don t bring my kids next time ... oh and here is a pic of the drunk hostess that was rude   I would ve rated this place a 10 for food and drinks and waitress... but this hostess gave y all a 1 2 star..oh ans the restroom ewww  Parking is an issue you have to park on a hill and pay  19 through app or they tow your vehicle   so carpool people    that s all
Gabriela's Downtown,78,This is my favorite spot in Austin. The vibes  drinks  and food are amazing  I know it gets crazy busy but it s worth the wait. Felipe and Flaca at the bar are AMAZING. They are completely attentive and ensure everyone is taken care of in the bar area while they make drinks for the restaurant.   Also  if you get a long wait time they will text you when your table is ready so I like to hangout at Revival Coffee down the street and wait. It is the same owner and they also have great drinks 
Gabriela's Downtown,79,Amazing food vibes and staff   Birria tacos are so bomb  rice and beans  marg flight  Salsa platter and the Queso. So good. Lots of leftovers - would def be back
Gabriela's Downtown,80,Wait - 3 Atmosphere - 2 Service - 3  Food 4  It s a very busy place  so be prepared to wait a while before getting a table  and once you get in  be prepared again to wait for service.   Although the food was pretty good  the intermittent service and terrible atmosphere were enough to convince us we don t need to go here again  especially since there s plenty of other Mexican food in the area.   Seriously  the music was blaring loud and we could barely have a conversation  needing to yell to hear anything. We asked the server if they could turn the music down but he said  he had no control over it  - really...  Seems like a place that is just trying to get people in and out and doesn t really care about the customer s experience. The food just really isn t worth it.
Gabriela's Downtown,81,Excellent food and drinks  This is one of ATX best kept secrets.  Great atmosphere and music. A fun place to bring your family and friends.
Gabriela's Downtown,82,AMAZING hole in the wall restaurant. fun whimsical drinks  fresh whole pineapple w margaritas inside  drinks w ziplock bag  and delicious food   came w the bf and we split the queso dip  AMAZING   a torta  HUGE    I definitely wanna come back. the ambiance is amazing  w the colored straight lights everywhere and fun music. I had so much fun here   3 drinks  2 apps    torta came out to  94 w tax and tip.  45 came from drinks  rip lol  so it s a great place to go  but do expect to pay in the  15 range for a drink 
Gabriela's Downtown,83,The best this about this place is the environment. Staff is great and attentive the drinks are bomb. Food is good but not my favorite. They also had a great show on site would go back just for that.
Gabriela's Downtown,84,Went for a bite to eat  amp  drinks.   No host.  Sat down then asked to move outside. We were sat in the far back corner and watched waiters past by at minimum 7 times. The wait for even water was over 30mins. After 20 mins of not being created my husband called their phone and asked the wait. They didn t have one. He waited 10 more minutes and called again to tell them they sat us down and didn t take a drink order.   A waiter finally came and we skipped ordering food and order drinks.   Got the pouched Bad Bunny margarita and the waiter felt bad and gave us two shots on the house.   Drinks were great. Service was not pleasing.
Gabriela's Downtown,85,Came to Gabriela s for a Sunday funday. The vibe was everything we were looking for. Decent food  not the star of the show but gets the job done  great drinks  easily one of the best micheladas I ve ever had  and an even better atmosphere. They had a dj playing a wide range of music  our first server was phenomenal... second one was honestly not great but we were almost done drinking anyway. Knocked off a star simply for the parking.  20 in their parking lot which is paved so terribly I m surprised peoples bumpers aren t yanked off left and right  it s incredibly steep  WEAR COMFY SHOES   or you can park on the next block which is a little bit of a trek since it is on a slope.
Gabriela's Downtown,86,I love a good patio and Gabriela s is FIRE  The dj though and all the fans....yaass  We arrived around 6 45 on a Sunday evening and when we checked in with Paco  the host   we requested to sit on the back patio and were quoted a 45 minute wait. We enjoyed some amazing drinks....frozen mangonada and the tamarindo lindo on the front porch while we waited for our text. We had only sat for about 5-10 minutes when we were greeted by Giselle. We placed an order for the queso flameado  the salsa sampler and the tinga de pollo tacos. Everything was delicious  Thanks Paco...you rock my friend 
Gabriela's Downtown,87,Fun vibe - I wasn t there when the DJ was  but I bet that would have made it even better. Fun micheladas  plenty of shrimp in mine  and good queso flameado. Staff was nice too and close location to downtown. I ll be back 
Gabriela's Downtown,88,We celebrated my friends birthday at Gabriella s and had a wonderful time  Ashley was amazing and killed it as a waitress. For her to handle our large rowdy table is no feat. Give this girl a raise  .   The food  atmosphere  and music was exactly what we were hoping for. 100  we will be back again and again.  Thank you Ashley for being on top of things and Gabriella for this restaurant.
Gabriela's Downtown,89,This place is adorable. The food and drinks we got were all incredible. We happened to come during an off time  so we were seated pretty quickly  but the parking sitch wasn t the most enjoyable. Worth it  for me. Thinking about the veggie enchiladas right now  and salivating a bit.
Gabriela's Downtown,90,This place was a vibe  The wait wasn t long for a Sunday brunch  30-40mins  We were seated in the back and the DJ was doing his thing. The drinks and food were great and they accommodate me with black beans since I am a vegetarian. I didn t give them 5 stars because the vegetarian options were limited to 2 actual entree which is odd for a Mexican restaurant and the hostess miswrote our reservation phone number after being corrected 3 times. Our table was ready for 10mins before we went to check inside to just make sure since it passed the estimated wait time. We were seated right out front. We just hoped for better attention to detail since that was our first impression. But nonetheless it was a great place to celebrate a birthday brunch.
Gabriela's Downtown,91,Mandatory  17 parking fee  Are you kidding me  They should have a very clear sign so that anyone in their right mind will turn around. I know Ausfin has gone crazy but this is ridiculous.   For the record our server was incredibly considerate and kind.   Salsas are great.  Margaritas is really nice and strong   Queso flameado is perfection.   So really the food and folks are amazing but that parking fee....
Gabriela's Downtown,92,We accidentally found this place on Cinco de Mayo because it has paid parking next to it. We saw everyone partying and thought  screw that Italian restaurant  Let s eat here     We were not disappointed  The staff was very attentive and everyone was wearing their masks. They told us it was a 30 min wait but ended up seating us in 5. Our food and drinks came out soon after. We tried Gaby s Margaritas  they add tamarind juice  which has a subtle savory and sweet flavor  and Paleta shots  watermelon  tequila  lime .   I had the shrimp ceviche and my husband had the carne asada tacos. The food was fresh and full of spice and flavor. It s hard to find a good Mexican restaurant that doesn t just make their food good by drowning it in cheese. Gabriella s is a delicious find that is sure to impress.
Gabriela's Downtown,93,This was my first stop to eat when I visited Austin for the first time. The food and drinks were absolutely delicious. The tacos were fantastic  
Gabriela's Downtown,94,Love the music  service  place and food. We ordered the gorditas  aguachiles and ceviche. The gorditas were amaaaazing -the sauce on the side was a great addition. The only reason I m giving 4 stars is bc the aguachiles and ceviche were SO spicy. We love spicy food but that was a-whole-nother level. We weren t warned about the spice level... they were pretty busy so maybe it slipped their mind.   Overall  great experience 
Gabriela's Downtown,95,Its a neat little place and all  but definitely over priced  no parking  long wait times  small tables  Mexican rice was dry  could ve been better  for just myself I ordered tacos and 1 drink cost 45   server was nice  need a better front host.
Gabriela's Downtown,96,Happy Hour is the bomb here  Between 3 girls  we had 6 drinks and 4 plates... each only spent  23 plus tip. It was nice because it wasn t busy on a Tuesday afternoon and I always love the food. I think the choriqueso is out of this world. My only complaint is how sugary the Margs are. Stick with your hard liquor and beer. Compared to the HH plates  the dinner plates are H U G E so come hungry   
Gabriela's Downtown,97,Margarita flight awesome. Definitely shareable  There s a grapefruit  house  and the other two flights executed beautifully along with ordering the one on the end we got a bigger version and is delicious  
Gabriela's Downtown,98,The food amazing  great service and the drinks so good everything is made from scratch   The tacos  agua de horchata and the pi a para La Ni a
Gabriela's Downtown,99,The drinks at this place are great but the food was lacking. The space is also mostly outdoors and in this texas heat  we felt like we were melting.
Gabriela's Downtown,100,I have mixed emotions about Gabriela s Downtown. The food is great. The atmosphere was a bit much for me  somewhat chaotic  but I gave it 5 stars because of the food and drinks. I wish you could make reservations. The parking is horrible here  so tiny and crammed with lots of traffic on 7th. Good luck getting in or out. But...once you are in with a table  you can relax and enjoy their large drink selection and delicious bites. I got the avocado enchiladas  queso flameado and a margarita  so good  The servers  particularly the bartenders run wild with all the people and I was so impressed that they still took time for each of us. I ll go back to Gabrielas.
Gabriela's Downtown,101,I really wanted to like this place  BUT with all of the excellent Texmex places in ATX  this one is lowest on the list   . It has a ton of potential   but they need to improve a bit. The drinks were all super sweet and the food was meh. We had al pastor and that s such a standard Mexican dish  but it was soooo bland. In the end  we spent  100 on Texmex for 4 tacos  guac  and drinks.....not worth it.  In addition to our overall expensive texmex  we had homeless people coming on the patio sitting next to us. I felt bad only because this place is prone to the homeless situation being next to 35. It s really hard to avoid it. I thought that the restaurant handled it well. However  one guy just walked up and took a clean glass off the counter  filled his water up   sat it back down  and left the restaurant without anyone saying a word. Another guy walked up and sat on the front patio for about 20 min behind my husband. He sat there talking to himself which made us feel a bit uncomfortable. I really think the restaurant handled this situation as best they could.
Gabriela's Downtown,102,Great drinks  and great food. Had the Torta and one of the select new drinks. The vibes were immaculate with a great view of the Austin skyline.
Gabriela's Downtown,103,Gabriela s is always a fun spot for dinner or drinks. It s close to bars downtown and on the east side  making it a great spot to meet friends. Drinks are creative and my favorite dish is the vegetarian Calabacitas tacos. Uber or expect to pay for parking.   A little hard to visit on weekends since they do not take reservations but worth the wait 
Gabriela's Downtown,104,Food sucks  and is overpriced. Drinks are decent  cool for pictures on social media. Service sucks  Way better places in Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,105,This place is at the top of my list for good drinks  delicious food  and pandemic safety  This is an awesome spot to meet up with friends for happy hour. It s close to downtown but you don t have to worry about finding a parking spot and walking far. There is plenty of patio room that is socially distanced. The DJ was a surprise bonus. Alex was our server and he took great care of us. We will be back soon 
Gabriela's Downtown,106,The waitlist is usually long on evenings  but the estimated time is always cut in half. Food is great every time  I ve been here about 5 times and the drinks are also great. My favorite dish here is the bistek torta 
Gabriela's Downtown,107,Today was my first ever visit to Gabriella s and I m SO disappointed in the service. The bartender was obnoxiously rude. When I asked for the manager the waitress came back to tell me he was too busy  which it was not busy . When we he finally made his way to my table his greeting was  yeah . I told him the issue and he barely acknowledged me  went over to the bartender and they laughed together. The food had no flavor and the service was horrible. I will obviously never go again  and I will make a point to tell every person I know to never go there as well  
Gabriela's Downtown,108,Unbelievable experience  Just left this place and if I could leave negative stars for the employee I would  We were a party of two and originally we were sat outside  the weather was chilly so after our order was placed we requested a seat inside  that was a huge mistake  Carlos our initial server was great he got our order in right away the food was great but when we were sat inside we were sat in a room off the front and an employee on the clock was having a personal call and you could hear everything  Not only was he loud  he would greet customers at the host stand with the phone still in hand talking then would sit down at the table next to us shouting to who from having to sit and listen was a relationship in shambles. It s sad that the male hostess had to have such an inappropriate and personal conversation while guest are dining ruined what would of been a great experience  the servers were great the food was great so were the drinks but I can definitely say I ve never experienced such a grossly unprofessional personal call where guest are dining. Will not be back.
Gabriela's Downtown,109,Location is great  right off of 35 with a great view of the Austin downtown skyline  Their patio was the only thing open and they had plenty of fans to cool us off in this summer heat    All workers wore their masks  our drinks were in disposable cups  they even gave us plastic silverware. The only reusable thing was the plates they served our food on.   We came for one thing mostly  the Micheladas  and their Preparadas.  Gabrielas didn t disappoint  The drinks were loaded with fruits and chamoy. It was really refreshing and a great way to end start our Friday evening.  The shrimp ceviche was fresh and tasty  For the plate it was kind of steep at  16. It definitely wouldn t have filled me up if we hadn t ordered chips  salsa and queso as an appetizer. Their salsa flight was spot on  I really digged the creamy avocado one especially    A favorite spot added to my list for some refreshing boozy drinks 
Gabriela's Downtown,110,Great vibes  period. Great breakfast  We enjoyed the music as well  amp  they even had a bad bunny inspired photo opp
Gabriela's Downtown,111,One of the coolest places I have had a chance to visit in Austin. Great vibe and great food  Drinks are so fun there  We had no problem waiting for our table  we got a seat at the bar and the service there was great. Will definitely be back 
Gabriela's Downtown,112,NEXT PLACE        Rude service from the time you walk up.... No order at all   We were waiting to even check into this place  amp  it was so disorganized. People cutting in line  hostess was rude  rude  rude    Not happy with the service. The hostess was RUDE      Heard amazing things but unfortunately we checked in  amp  were told that we couldn t get a drink. Had to wait roughly 15 minutes to go to the tiny ass bar. However  people that checked in after the whole table had there drinks  while they wait  My group waited the time  I walked up to the bar  nobody even wanted to make eye contact. I get it it s busy but where is the customer service with this place. Not a even I ll be with you shortly. We were given a 60 minute wait as well at 8 45 pm  on a Saturday night .  The wait wasn t the issue although it ended up being a 30-35 min wait. Needless to say we left this place with no drink or food.
Gabriela's Downtown,113,Gabrielas  is one of my favorite places to visit every time I am in Austin Texas. The ambience and vibes are amazing  from the music selection  to the d cor  to the look and feel of the place. This place is an authentic Mexican restaurant that is a local favorite and not just a tourist trap. That being said  the prices are reasonable and the food and drink selection is amazing. Cannot go wrong with tacos  enchiladas  or ceviche. The vast drink menu is very creative with many different style tequila drinks and Instagram worthy options. I enjoy coming here every time I am in town due the experience  as well as the amazing service.
Gabriela's Downtown,114,Almost  12 dollar parking for an hour. Screw Austin. The restaurant shouldn t least give us a complimentary margarita. Also no complimentary chips and salsa. I ve lived my whole life in Texas and have never had to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant. Thank you Californians
Gabriela's Downtown,115,Things got off to a bad start when they had neither coffee nor iced tea at brunch. The waitress thought I was rude about that and for asking to turn the music down  she couldn t hear me the first time I asked . Even after an apology  she decided to show me she knew how to be rude too and refused to look at or speak to me again. Just as well - she didn t have to hear my comments about the food  which overall is bland. The carnitas was in dire need of seasoning  but at least were hot  unlike the beans and potatoes. Those both had great flavor but were lukewarm. Since we were the first customers  that means they were re-heated and not freshly made.   If you can find a parking space on the street  take it  even if it means a dash across busy 7th St. Otherwise you re in a pay lot  which adds  10  to the price of your meal. Better yet  try one of the many other options within several blocks of this place.
Gabriela's Downtown,116,Mannn saw all the pictures and drinks look amazing   But FUCKEN RUDE BITCHES. Spills water twice on us and acts like nothing happens
Gabriela's Downtown,117,I ended up at Gabriela s for brunch before a flight completely unplanned and in a rush. We arrived and  the restaurant was just beginning to get busy. Luckily  we were seated outside right away. It was a warm day in Austin  but each table had an umbrella which helped.   There was no time to peek at the menu  so my friend and I decided to order a few things to share. We ordered the birria quesotacos de res  the shrimp aguachiles  the choriqueso  and guac. Everything was amazing    In terms of drinks  they had quite a fun menu to play with  including a  Perreo Series  which featured a J. Balvin Passion Fruit Margarita and Bad Bunny Kiwi Margarita - SOLD  I also ordered the Cool as a Cucumber Mezcal-Rita  which was fine but not as refreshing as the Kiwi.   Vibes were incredible. The music was lively and appropriately Mexican and our server  Fany  was so friendly and attentive. She was clearly busy  but still made sure that we were enjoying our brunch and made time to make us feel welcomed.   This was hands down my favorite meal in Austin and I m so glad to have stumbled upon it 
Gabriela's Downtown,118,Gabriela s was a really cute brunch spot   The food was really good  but not the best I ve ever had. It was PACKED so you deff need to be there before opening if you want a seat. They usually sell out of birria by 11  which we were fortunate enough to order. They were really good tacos   They did have Covid rules in place but it was so packed it was hard to social distance. I would deff go back again 
Gabriela's Downtown,119,This place has a cute outdoor patio and great service. We loved the shrimp tacos and our waitress was super friendly. Great drinks as well 
Gabriela's Downtown,120,Hands down some of the best food you can get in Austin. Might be a bit packed with people but as long as you re there for food they re gonna deliver on their end.
Gabriela's Downtown,131,We came here with a group of 6 for sunday brunch. It was packed  We waited for seating and ended up outside on the patio which was really nice even though it was chilly out. I want to say it was enclosed.   I fell like I can never accurately judge a place if the first time I visit is super packed. I can tell that at any regular rime the service probably would have been a little better. The music was sooooo loud that we asked them to turn it down and they sweetly agreed.   The drinks were so bomb  The micheladas were mouth watering and the bartender made me a yummy cocktail as well.   The food was pretty good but they got one of our orders wrong and instead of just bringing out the right order they brought the plate back to our table like 3 times telling my friend that she ordered that when we most definitely didn t. In the end they brought her correct order out and all was well.   I feel like this is a 4 star place even though I had a 3 star experience  Next time I m in Austin I ll try coming a different time that isn t as busy
Gabriela's Downtown,132,Gabriel s is adorable and I really enjoyed my time here. The margarita flight was a cute and delicious way to sample a few of Gabriela s signature margs - my personal favorite was the strawberry  The tacos I had were fine but not particularly amazing. I can t remember what it was called  but I had some kind of promotional drink that was available on that night only. I personally found the drink itself kind of icky  but I got to keep my mug in addition to a couple of Bacardi masks  some palm tree drink stirrers  portable reusable straws  and more  Parking seemed like it was kind of wack so I Ubered but I believe there was additional  free   parking down the street.
Gabriela's Downtown,133,OBSESSED  Dropped in last week as we just moved into the neighborhood and we re so glad we did - definitely going to be our go-to for Mexican food and margaritas. To start we had the Shrimp Ceviche and Chips  amp  Guac - both generous portions and tasty. For the mains  I had the Avocado Cream Enchiladas  a must  totally worth the hype  and my husband had La Cubana. The staff was friendly  service was quick and their patio is dog friendly. We went on a Monday and it was busy  with a DJ as well.  The house margaritas were cheap  strong and perfect. Unfortunately wasn t able to capture photos  it was just all so good we had to eat it right away   
Gabriela's Downtown,134,First visit to Gabrielas in downtown Austin. My first thought was why have i not been here before  Walking in we already enjoyed the ambiance. All staff members were so attentive and friendly from the greeter to the bartender. They had the cutest wall decor. The music playing was good. They have indoor and outdoor patio sitting.   I ordered the Cool as a Cucumber Mezcal-Rita. For food i had the Tinga de Pollo plate. Everything was so good  My cousin who i was with had a Ceviche Michelada and that too was delicious    Our server was so attentive. So was the bartendner. Everyone made sure to check on us often and see if we needed anything.   Now i will be going back to check out their brunch 
Gabriela's Downtown,135,Very disappointed with my experience at Gabriela s. The host was rude  the waiter was rude and would rush me as I was telling him what I wanted to order. I didn t add or take off something from my order  it was simple and straight from the menu. The waiter never came around to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything. Vibes were just off. Not sure if the employees hate working here or something but they were all very rude and dismissive for no reason. This was not worth it. We had to pay to park and then we basically paid to have people be rude to us.
Gabriela's Downtown,136,Not worth the wait.  The experience started off well. There were tons of people so we knew there would be a wait. They quoted us   1 hour. They send you a text and let you watch the wait time   your place in line.   We were 7th in line. They allowed us to get drinks at the bar  great   the drinks were yummy. We got micheladas  margaritas and a margarita pitcher. No complaints there. Flavors were good and the margs were strong.   The issues occurred when we began to see our place in line move closer to the top. There were tons of large parties getting seated which we saw were before us. Once we were second in line we noticed that the table behind us with a larger party was seated before us.   Now - here s the kicker  This restaurant has two patios. One in the front and one out back. The front patio had people who were being served when we first arrived but then everyone was gone.   There were other people sitting out front while they waited to be called inside.  We saw two parties be moved in  .  Well when the clock hit 1 hour 15 min we asked why we were skipped and they told us 15 more minutes..   Well guess where they sat us  OUT FRONT. The empty patio.  I understand that the servers might have multiple sections but why not utilize the entire restaurant so the wait is not complained about so frequently.   It s disorganized.   The food was good. We got chilaquiles  salsa sampler  queso flameado  guac  birria tacos  and migas.   The guac needed more seasoning  the two green salsas were great  the red tomato one had zero flavor  and the chipotle one was good too. The chips had a perfect crunch but were way too greasy.   The rice was perfect. And the portions were more than enough.   Everyone loved the food. The server was good. They were out of one of the menu items so one of the members of our party did not eat. Another issue.   Overall I would say it was okay.
Gabriela's Downtown,137,Our server was so kind  The parking is kind of jank ngl haha it s on a very steep hill. If you want free parking there are some spots behind the fence  however they are LIMITED. Would def recommend carpooling   If you can t fit there  there is a lot but it is very expensive  20  for 2 hours . Again  carpool  The food here was super yummy and 10 10 would come back for happy hour. I got a Paloma to drink which was good  but I think I would try something different next time. The rim is chamoy and tajin sooo good  For food  my friend and I shared the salsa sampler  chorizo queso  sopesitas  and tacos  My favorites was by far the queso   Was not in love with the sopesitas  but my friend really liked them. We tried the bean and chicken and I would def go with chicken. The street tacos were beef and super yummy. We were both stuffed by the end of the night and our meal was only 20  each  Also this place for sure has one of the best city views of Austin if you sit on the porch outside  Also the chips have some sort of seasoning on them  not sure what it is but it SLAPS  
Gabriela's Downtown,138,Avocado Enchiladas - essential on a visit here. You are able to do a vegetarians option as well. Their sauce is incredible   Great Patio and Outdoor vibe.
Gabriela's Downtown,139,My wife and I have been coming here for little over a year now  amp  as of Late may I want to say that it hasn t had consistency in service or quality . I think because of the second location the birrea tacos here aren t good. The new staff isn t timely or the kitchen is just not equipped to handle large capacity crowd . Our waitress tried her best but messed up almost all the drink orders. What should have been an hour dine in turned to two after all said and done . Hopefully the management realizes the frustration from customers .
Gabriela's Downtown,140,This is as good as it gets Yelpers   I have never been here before yet I always drive by to go home. I have been missing out for sure   I love it here. I have been here 4 times now in the last 2 months. I d go more however I d go broke as I eat and drink too much when I am there. It is amazing.  The ambience alone is something you can t recreate. The music  the food  drinks  salsas... omgoodness.  I will forward the parking situation is downright confusing. If you can avoid that altogether you re golden here.  Always get an appetizer. I have been knocking back each menu item and their stuff is legit. I am an average white guy however to me this seems very authentic. The social climate should also help validate this place as so many Mexican families and friends seem to congregate here for meals.  Gabriela s is a real jewel in the city of Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,141,THIS PLACE IS A WHOLE VIBE  From the amazing food to the coolest drinks to a live DJ. It met all our needs.   The food was super tasty from the Birria tacos w great broth w onion and cilantro on the side ORDER THIS FOR SURE.  We also  gorditas de chancho. Super tasty   The choriqueso was such a great appetizer and comes w chips  amp  tortillas.   2 drinks that come in bags are the Bad bunny and the J Balvin. They even come w a pair of heart shaped glasses for an extra   10. Drinks are so cute and we took a bunch of pics to make our friends jealous.   There is a live DJ playing not only top 100 s  but Selena and merengue and Latin music. It s a whole NYC mamajuana cafe type brunch  iykyk  the waiter was super nice and helpful. We aren t locals so we even asked him for other stops to visit around Austin.   We will be going back for more    Oh and they even have a  Mi media Naranja  mural  SO CUTE 
Gabriela's Downtown,142,Awesome place.  Located in a small house turned into a restaurant circa downtown Austin this place has a cool vibe and great food.  They built a shaded patio on the back where they serve you with a DJ playing cool music.  Everyone is hip and to be seen.  Drinks are great and food wonderful as well. We ll be returning again maybe at night to take advantage of the cool lighting.
Gabriela's Downtown,143,The food is delicious  the drinks are great  and the energy is high  Cute spot to take visitors.
Gabriela's Downtown,144,Loved this place  located near 6th street this is a poppin location. It is fairly small and there is no public parking you ll have to pay to park. However the food will make up for that the food has great flavor. Drinks are great they don t shy on the alcohol. It is kind of pricey but I d say we ll worth it  give a try in recommend it  the staff was super nice and they were all staying safe during covid.
Gabriela's Downtown,145,We started my bachelorette party at Gabriela s and got wasted on DELICIOUS margarita flights. My friends and I  from Ohio  were speechless on the quality of the food we received. Everything here was incredible. This is a must-stop for any visitor to Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,146,This is a must do if you are in town    We walked from 6th street and it was worth the walk  It was about a 10 min walk but it kinda gets sketchy walking at night so be careful. The place was packed but we were able to order from the bar. Mush do     Photo does not do it justice 
Gabriela's Downtown,147,What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn t have enchiladas   Food was mediocre for the price and the portion you get. We are in Texas  who doesn t have sweat tea  Ordered a soda that came in a can with a straw in it.. would not go back
Gabriela's Downtown,148,Yummy margaritas  super good choriqueso  and the birriaaaaa tacossss omggggg. Delicious. Our waitress was a little distant- didn t see her for long stretches of time it felt like   but I think there needed to be another server helping her out on such a busy brunch day 
Gabriela's Downtown,149,visiting Austin and asked for recommendations.  Gabriela s was highly recommended. We were not disappointed   The food was awesome  the service was awesome.  I would definitely come back.
Gabriela's Downtown,150,This is actually my second time visiting  the first was for a really fun and yummy girls night....I will be honest  the first time I just remember drinking a delicious cocktail out of a pineapple and singing Beyonc  on the way home with my girlfriends sooo...this time of course  was much more tame cause COVID. The restaurant felt spaced appropriately and the staff were masked but they were all hanging out together by the bar which made me a bit nervous. However the drink flight was delightful and there is a green salsa in their salsa flight that I was about to just drink if it wasn t for their yummy chips. Cute place as well but they just switched their entire parking lot to pay to park  That sucks for people visiting the restaurant. However it s Austin soooo wasn t too surprised and happy to support them. Go here for a cute date or a girls night out 
Gabriela's Downtown,151,The bacon-wrapped jalape os and shrimp on the appetizer list are to die for  The drinks are also wonderful. Highly recommend the Tamarindo beverage with the tamarind straw  Yum 
Gabriela's Downtown,152,After craving their food last night  I decided to head their way at 9pm just me by the way . Arrived at 9 30pm. The front says OPEN but the door was locked. So I went through the side entrance and waited 10 minutes at the  host stand to finally get attended by a host. Then was told they were no longer accepting walk-ins because there was already a long wait. Keep in mind they don t close until 10 pm and their sign in the front said OPEN. Management and host stand need work.
Gabriela's Downtown,153,Gabriela s might have my favorite insta-friendly-pretty-vibes Mexican food happy hour yet. If only they would validate parking--or better yet  have more parking options.  We came by for happy hour and missed the entrance  so we had to do a quick u-turn  only to find that the parking right on its lot is metered. It s pay by the hour  so we just bit the bullet and paid it instead of parking who-knows-where and risking break-ins or a 10-tons-of-sweatage-walk-over. The host stand is right through the front entrance and their SUPER colorful mural work. We sat outside in their back porch area. Our server was a very friendly young man who was very efficient and got us all of our orders. We thought happy hour ended at 6pm  but he assured us it went until 6 30pm. SCORE on the HH    We got two margs and enjoyed the sopecitas. Their guacamole is also divine. Their tortilla chips are hot and the thicc kind--my favorite kind  I m definitely a thick tortilla chip kinda gal. They didn t have too many vegetarian options compared to meat for the happy hour menu  but I was very happy that there were some at least. The sopecitas were yumminess in black bean form. I dream about going back for more HH.  I ve seen my friends get their marg flights...so cool  They also have clean restrooms  one stall only  and have plenty of room for all sized parties. Get your social media ready  happy hour tummies hungry  and head on over to Gabriela s.
Gabriela's Downtown,154,Parking is not good-- 5 per hour to park in their small lot. Music is quite loud. We sat inside because it was hot and there were cute parts but I didn t really get the  Instagram aesthetic  that others talked about. Just ok. Food was fine. The Queso was my favorite part. It s not a dip but more like a cast iron skillet filled with melted cheese and veggies salsas. Really great and served with chips and warm tortillas. Tacos were REALLY spicy. Like REALLY. Rice was good but came out cold. Beans looked gross to me so I didn t try them--they had little cut up hotdogs in them which creeped me out. Overall the food was just ok.
Gabriela's Downtown,155,Very cool Mexican restaurant with nice food and cool drinks. I could come here to grab a quick bite  or chill for an amazing drink.  This is located right outside of downtown  and it looks like a house. They have indoor seating  and outdoor backyard seating. Only issue is it s sort of a tight space indoors  and outdoors can get quite hot. They only have fans that point either your direction or opposite side. The backyard has a stage setup  but I m not sure if that gets utilized for a special weekend night. Also  not all of the backyard is covered.  Food was good  but nothing out of the ordinary. Definitely fresh made  and had flavor. The quantity was decent also. Drinks are picture perfect  and taste delicious. Only thing is the prices are a bit high  but I guess you re paying city prices.  TIP  If you plan on arranging a big party then call ahead to see how they can accommodate  and clarify if you would like to sit indoor or outdoor.
Gabriela's Downtown,156,Good drinks  great food. We came during covid restrictions and the tables were distanced and staff and servers all had masks. Only patio was open so we dined al fresco. Highly recommend the enchiladas and the queso appetizer with chorizo - it was very authentic with homemade tortillas.
Gabriela's Downtown,157,Food and drinks were delicious   It s pricey but worth every penny. It was my first time coming here and it won t be the last time.  Great atmosphere. Great music. Great ATX view.   For appetizer  I recommend the guacamole and chips  As for plates  the bistec torta and tacos al pastor  and for drinks  Bad Bunny and J Balvin margaritas and the frozen mangonadas.   Also  I highly encourage to come early  if not  you will be waiting approximately more than 45 minutes to get a good outside seating. We were not able to experience an outside seating  instead  we were sat inside since there was a long wait.   Overall  this place is one of my favorite places in ATX  I will be coming back soon 
Gabriela's Downtown,158,I went to Gabrielas for the first time after viewing their Margiata Flights as a go To happy hour spot. For only  20 you get to sample 4 of their famous drinks. My favorite was the frozen strawberry margarita. I came on a Wednesday and service was pretty slow  but the place was kinda of busy around 5pm being it was happy hour. They have  6 drinks and  6 food menu options. I had the shrimp ceviche tostada which was just okay to me. I ve visited their other location Taquero Mucho ran by the same owner  and found service to be much better. I originally sat outside   but moved in after 30mins to sit in bar area after not being serviced.
Gabriela's Downtown,159,Loved the vibe  The music and food was great. This place is loud so definitely come if you are trying to day drink and party 
Gabriela's Downtown,160,I have heard so much about brunch here...it s been on my list. I was definitely not disappointed with this experience. The ambiance is perfect especially on the patio when the weather is nice. I started with a horchata with rum which was delicious   It was a huge drink and I wasn t expecting the size. Well worth the price. They have a great drink menu to compliment their brunch. Next we had the churiqurso which was not what I was expecting  but extremely satisfied with this choice. Last I had the carnitas. They were a little on the dry side but still good. They were served with potatoes that were amazing though. The wait staff was a little short handed and not as attentive as she could have been  but all in all a great experience. I will definitely be back. 10 10 would recommend 
Gabriela's Downtown,161,Ok so we got there 30 minutes before opening and they have a pay to park in their lot. At opening  we were seated on the front patio after scanning a QR code for their menu. We came on a Saturday for the brunch menu. My birria taco was amazing but sadly my consume took another 15 minutes to get to me. My shrimp ceviche appetizer never showed up. The mangorita was really good  I liked the candy covered straw it came with and it made a great cup for the pitchers amid margaritas that followed. Everyone s food was good and drinks were cute but expensive. Pitchers was definitely the way to go. Luckily we were in a sip and eat kind of mood because service was really slow. I m not sure if they didn t have enough servers or what the deal was.
Gabriela's Downtown,162,Loved the atmosphere  The service is a bit slow but their food and drinks are amazing    Drinks    Pina para ni as  6 10  pretty presentation  the flavor is okay   Bad Bunny Kiwi Marg  9 10  try it    Paloma  7 10   Food    Bacon Wrapped Shrimp  10 10     Corn side  10 10    Asada Tacos  9 10    Steak Gringas  9 10 
Gabriela's Downtown,163,The gringos were good   The frozen margarita was fancy and good - covered in Tajin though which I don t love. Very cute. Waited about 45 min to get a table for 2 on a Saturday night.
Gabriela's Downtown,164,Very underwhelmed with this restaurant. We were seated at a dirty table. We ordered two drinks- the cucumber margarita and the gabrielas marg as well. Both drinks lacked flavor and tasted like lime syrup. When I told my waitress that I would like a different drink  she told me that because I drank out of it  I took all of three sips  I wouldn t be able to send it back and she  suggest I just drink it.  Eventually she did take the drink and replace it with the J Balvin- which just tasted like very syrupy juice. The food lacked a lot of key flavors- though I will say the carne asada tacos were pretty good despite the lack of toppings dressings. The food was not very hot.  Overall  not impressed and will not be back.
Gabriela's Downtown,165,This place is super cute -- great downtown views  adorable atmosphere and fun novelty drinks. Went on a Thursday and it was VERY poppin w  a live DJ  maybe a little too loud to be honest as my throat was sore from having to yell the entire time to talk to my friends. I am giving 4 stars partially because they said online HH until 6 30pm so we were disappointed to see it was apparently only until 6pm  noted only once you re there in person . As someone very busy struggling to get off work early that was very annoying as my fancy  but cute and tasty  michelada beer pop with a cheap Dos Equis was  9  but nothing will be more annoying than parking being 10 DOLLARS FOR 2 HRS. I will never drive here again  what a pain. Felt like paying cover for the club  loud DJ and all . The veggie taco I got with grilled poblano was alright  the guacamole I split 3 ways was pretty good. With parking and my one drink   food I spent like  50. You are def paying for the experience.
Gabriela's Downtown,166,So happy to have stumbled upon this place. The decor is beyond cute and the bartenders were fantastic. We had a tequila based pineapple drink that was so refreshing and I had the spicy mezcal margarita  yum   The Mexican corn was really good  and the pastor tacos hit. Def trying their sister property Taqueria Mucho next 
Gabriela's Downtown,167,Good food and margs were the reg  The music was SO loud- couldn t hear anything
Gabriela's Downtown,168,I m very disappointed.  I will preface by saying I was initially excited to see this restaurant because I was told good things  and the food looked so fresh and amazing. I went with a friend and we requested a table for two  preference for outdoor but it didn t truly matter to us. We were quoted a 20-30 minute wait  which is fine  they looked busy .   An hour passed and we went in to check on our table. With a line out the door and several confused customers  we approached an empty hostess stand. We waited several minutes and waiters passed by  no hostess in sight  and no update from a single person who worked there about where we could be helped. We were LITERALLY walking into the restaurant asking for someone to help us and it seemed like it was a chore for the workers there.   When the hostess DID return  it appeared our name and number wasn t put down because  we were putting in a lot of tables.  No acknowledgement of the wasted time  no  sorry for the inconvenience   no  thank you for your patience.   To their credit we were seated immediately after this and the food was good  but it s irritating to feel like we had to go out of our way for service in a service industry.   I m truly not sure if I will come back  based on this experience alone.
Gabriela's Downtown,169,Parking in downtown Austin is stupid expensive. If you are planing to eat here  be ready to dish out at least  17 for parking up front. That s how much I paid for 3 hour parking on their lot.   Their food and drinks were great. It s definitely worth the hype. I had their Al pastor taco plate and Gabby s margarita. Both were really good. I would definitely come back again.
Gabriela's Downtown,170,Some of the best food I ve had in a while. Hands down an amazing dining experience. Our server Julio was attentive and friendly. I can t recommend this place enough.
Gabriela's Downtown,171,The margarita sampler was awesome especially the mangonada. Gorditas Carnitas were good  the sauce on the side was spicy 
Gabriela's Downtown,172,Great vibe and outdoor seating. Food was well seasoned  maybe slightly over seasoned  but delicious. Tortillas and chips were so fresh  Great drinks  I will be back.
Gabriela's Downtown,173,Horrible service absolutely  We waited an hour for a table then got seated and no server came for 15 minutes. Sucks we waited so long. We left and will probably never go back.
Gabriela's Downtown,174,We had the Queso Fundido as well as house margaritas. The queso flavor was good  but left my stomach feeling not great after a while. I would definitely recommend not eating a lot of it. As for the house margarita  our first round was super sweet  so we asked for the next round a little less sweet. I have no idea what they put in them  but they did not taste good. If I go back  I think I will try the Gabriella s margarita instead of the house margarita. Overall  just skip the house margarita.  The highlight of this place for me was the music and atmosphere. You can definitely tell the food is authentic Mexican. Try to sit outside if you can - The music is fun and loud and you get much better service than inside. Definitely worth a wait to sit outside  Try to get a reservation for a Thus Friday Sat especially if you want to sit outside.
Gabriela's Downtown,175,Showed up and waited for over an hour for a table. Then had issues with seating   then sat for15 mins with no service..  it s more for pictures and looks pretty.  Probably not the best place to go if you  really want to eat ..  not the first time I have had a negative time at this place.
Gabriela's Downtown,176,This place is such a good time. The atmosphere is really fun and the food is so good  Try the shrimp aguachil or the shrimp tacos  The queso flameado and the sopes are also very good but my favorite thing about this place is the drinks. Over the top  two-hander masterpieces. The Micheladas are a meal in themselves  The mango and strawberry margaritas are so fresh  Go here for lively people watching and good music on the patio. You won t be disappointed
Gabriela's Downtown,177,Avoid this place. Cold disgusting food complacent service and BEWARE 14 yr old bartenders over charge you. Even after telling them not menu prices for brunch drinks we were charged same again for second round. Embarrassing to take friends here
Gabriela's Downtown,178,Food and drinks are great but service is below par.  The hostess is tiny and cute but unfriendly.  I have been there several times and she barely talks or makes eye contact with you.  Just kind of mumbles the wait and moves on to the next person.  Went on a Sunday and the music was so loud we couldn t hear our server.  He didn t seem to be enjoying his job either.  This is such a great place it could use a lesson in customer relations.   I would recommend the other location in Austin 
Gabriela's Downtown,179,Music and vibe is definitely worth stopping by for a drink.  I was there on a Friday afternoon and we racked up quite the bill   70ish  even though there weren t that many menu items that graced our table. We got the guac to start along with the margarita flight. While delicious sounding in theory  the margarita flight was pretty messy  couldn t pick up a shot glass without spilling half of the liquid out  and all of the drinks were more sugar than alcohol. Super cute for a photo  not for imbibing. Guac was subtle... no distinct flavor.  The veggie taco plate was hefty but lacking any mmm moment. I love the black beans and the amount of veggies spilling out of the taco shell. I only ate one  though  as the dish didn t compel me to stuff my face with it. Friend got a meat taco plate as well  and she enjoyed it...she s a plain Jane type of eater  so she asked for just meat and tortilla  not much to mess up there 
Gabriela's Downtown,180,Food was delicious  We had the queso and avocado for our appetizer and I had the gorditas de chicharr n en salsa roja--so flavorful. Drinks were also great  Tried the bad bunny kiwi margarita which was so good. Overall  great vibe and wonderful service. Parking is tight so just prepare for that. Will definitely be visiting again.
Gabriela's Downtown,181,Went in on a Friday at noon and the wait was about 30 minutes for a table of 4 with a toddler. Wait was not bad at all  We got seated at a table with a great view of Austin and we got greeted by I m assuming a host to get our drink orders right away. This was good and bad because we had just sat down no more than 10 seconds ago and didn t get a chance to even look at the drink menu so we all ordered water. The guy brought out our waters and our server came right after asking if we were ready to order anything.. again  I didn t even get a chance to even look at the menu.  FYI you download the menu using a QR code. There are NO paper menus at all.  We told our server we needed more time but that I wanted to order from my toddler already since he was already hungry and couldn t wait. I ordered my toddler a side of rice  sliced avocado  and black beans  my son refuses to eat anything else especially meat  so when I ordered this he looked at me annoyed and said  Does your son not eat quesadillas   - ummmmm no sir. If he did im sure I would ve ordered that..  So anyway  our server gave us a bad vibe to begin with. My son s food came out about 30 minutes later. He took the rest of our order at that time. It took about another 30 minutes for our food to come out  in the meantime  our waiter only came around once to check on us.   The food  delicious  Worth the wait  decent sized portions. Wish they had a kids menu though. There were a couple kids in the restaurant and all had to order from adult plates..  Overall  customer service is average  food is worth it for price and portions  alcoholic drink are good too  nice view. I would go again 
Gabriela's Downtown,182,I went today for lunch and this place was amazing. I sat outside and had the best Micheladas of my life. I also had a steak torta which was fantastic. Probably one of the best food and beverage experiences I have had since I have been in Austin. Make sure you get the shrimp Michelada  It s a meal in itself.
Gabriela's Downtown,183,Would be 5 stars if they had parking  Great drinks  AMAZING DJ MY GOODNESS and good food. Wished they gave chips and salsa for free too
Gabriela's Downtown,184,For the appetizer I recommend to get the queso blanco  they had option to change the meat They had chorizo that goes with it  but I don t like chorizo so I order me a fajita steak and it super delicious with the fajita the flavor of the meat was super good  I order me a few drinks before getting my meal  me and my boyfriend order a Jam n torta   something like that   and it was honestly amazing I first I thought it was the burger just because the way the bread shape was form  but it wasn t that torta was super good 10 10 for a Mexican restaurant and i came from Houston just to try this restaurant worth the drive to me
Gabriela's Downtown,185,Honestly  this place is awesome. It has a good vibe. Great music. There is outdoor seating. There is a live DJ. The only thing with the music is too loud so don t come here thinking you re going to have a good place to talk. I felt like I was at a quincea era but in all the best ways. The esquites  Mexican corn  was great  The best I ve had. However  I would add chile powder and not Valentina but that s just me. The guacamole was great too. It was really fresh. My sister ordered asada tacos and she said it was good. It comes with beans and rice and they were both really great. The beans had great flavor. I got the sopes one with asada  steak  and one with Al pastor. The Al pastor actually came with pineapple. It also had pickled onions and they were a great addition to the plate. We both got a Bad Bunny bag. It was great. I ve had plenty of Mexican food in Texas and this has been the best.
Gabriela's Downtown,186,I like the backyard ambience and the music with the live DJ. That s it. The portions are tiny for the chilaquiles. The mimosa was made with some thing that didn t taste good. The Carnitas were not good. We also ordered pancakes that tasted bland and undercooked. How do you mess of pancakes  Too much money spent on food that was not enjoyed at all. Service was great though 
Gabriela's Downtown,187,This is a hipster trendy converted house in the downtown area with indoor seating  a smallish back patio area and some seating street side along with a splash of neon.   The views from the patio of the zombies at the nearby homeless camp and graffiti covered buildings gave it a super cool urban decay vibe  along with DJ music cranked up to 11 insuring I wouldn t need to listen to anyone else in our dinner party.  The drinks were huge  strong and well worth the price.  The Barboca Taco s were extremely good  so good that I am putting aside the negative aspects of this place and will come back soon.  I honestly have never had anything like them before.  The Queso Flameado off the hook too.    Turn down the music to a reasonable level and I would give this place four stars.  Honestly there is nothing they can due about the ever present urban decay in the downtown area  which is what it would take for me to rate them five stars.  If loud music and the walking dead are your thing  then I would head over for happy hour.  If not but are willing to put that aside the food is well worth it 
Gabriela's Downtown,188,There were multiple hairs in my chip and they did not apologize or care. There was then hair in my sour cream   It is very greasy and gross Mexican food. Was expecting much better   Not to mention the place smelt so dirty. Do not eat here  
Gabriela's Downtown,189,My sister told me to go check this place out while my family and I were in Austin  you have to pay for parking ... better choice to park behind the gas station   paid parking area   when u go in to the restaurant it s on a hill that somehow it s scary to drive to lol ... seating is now at 100  so be prepared to have ppl really close to you ... there was a live dj playing all the jams out in the patio ... drinks are good and so is the food but the food menu does not have many items to choose from   I guess because of covid   Wish I had stayed a little longer to enjoy it better .
Gabriela's Downtown,190,Great drinks and spicy food  they serve some of the best drinks. The tacos are flavorful and the waitstaff is attentive. Small place but really cute.
Gabriela's Downtown,191,Gabriela s Downtown...thank you  next   I really wanted to like this place  but everything from their service  food and cleanliness was way below average. When my friends and I walked in Gabriela s we waited at least 5min for someone to even talk to us. The most frustrating part about this  is not the waiting time but that I saw at least 5 folks who work at this establishment and they knew we were waiting and didn t even took the time to say  someone will be with you in a sec . Instead  they would just stare at us and keep walking  rude.   Now let s talk food... When a  mexican  restaurant makes you pay for chips and salsa  you kinda already know something is a little off. Anyways  The chips were VERY oily  every time I grabbed one it was like touching a pan full of oil. I order the Carne Asada tacos  and was extremely disappointed. The tortilla was cold and it came apart when I tried to eat my tacos. The meat was flavorless and full of  fatty  chunky parts that I couldn t even bite. The best thing about my platter was the charros beans  which were actually pretty good.  I think Gabriela s is probably cool spot to grab a few mimosas but I wouldn t come back for the food or service.
Gabriela's Downtown,192,Great food and good service. I will say that it gets pretty packed in here so unless your trying to wait for about an hour or two try to find something else don t complain.
Gabriela's Downtown,193,Place was super nice  amp  staff was amazing  Drinks are so good as well. I will be back soon  REAL SOON 
Gabriela's Downtown,194,This is my happy  relax place   Mike is so nice And helpful      I ask him to surprise Me or I ask for the most popular drink and it always hits the spot   he is so Attentive   clean and fast    The most kind bartender I have came across     Mind you the food here is 10 10      I love the green avocado enchiladas 
Gabriela's Downtown,195,Fantastic vibe  I loved loved loved the happy hour and you can t beat the view from the back patio. Their drinks and food are so delicious  The decor just sets the tone for a great time.
Gabriela's Downtown,196,This place is SO good. If youre looking for great patio dining this is the spot   Do yourself a favor and order the Queso Flameado here. Happy hour is a great time to sample the menu. Fun atmosphere  great food  very good service. Cannot rave about this place enough.
Gabriela's Downtown,197,Cute Mexican spot  I order the migas con chorizo and it tasted great. The pi a mimosa was a nice touch as well  I would like to dry for lunch dinner one day.
Gabriela's Downtown,198,This place is great to come with friends and get expensive drinks. Snacks and food were good as well. The place seems small and you get the smell from the street and the kitchen a lot. The place overall is okay.
Gabriela's Downtown,199,So so so good. Got a margarita flight and was in heaven   Mexican street corn is a must order  Service was amazing. We heard about this place on tiktok and we will definitely be back whenever we come back to Austin. Good view of downtown. Parking was a litttttle expensive but totally worth it.
Gabriela's Downtown,200,Nothing gets me going quite like dining al fresco. Gabriela s has a very instagramable inside  but its their sparkling covered patio that dreams are made of.   Picture perfect drinks  and amazing food  best chilaquiles I ve had in town so far  but  boy  is it pricy. This is a rare treat  but one I would definitely do again.
Gabriela's Downtown,201,Overrated and I work In customer service. Hostess was rude and doesn t let u order drinks . She told us wait was over an hour . Sad cause I was looking forward to taking my friends here. They called us in 30 minutes but we left. We understand this is a pandemic but be nicer.
Gabriela's Downtown,202,Authentic TexMex in an ecclectic setting. A converted house  similar in concept to Rainey Street  but not Rainey Street  make Gabriela s even more unique. Excellent use of seasonings and herbs  cilantro   accent all of their dishes. Don t let the location scare you  definitely worth the trip.
Gabriela's Downtown,203,My husband says their tacos are the best he s ever had. Chips and queso are great. I didn t care for the margarita but the food was good.
Gabriela's Downtown,204,I returned to Gabriela s yesterday to give this restaurant another try and I m so glad that I did. This time around  I got to try some of their most popular dishes. The environment was less hectic and it was a beautiful day to sit out and eat on the patio.  I started off with a La Flaca margarita and some Aguachiles. The Aguachiles were not too spicy and had the right amount of tang and spice. My waiter Juan and the owner  Gabriela explained to me that it is a homemade recipe that is made fresh daily  and the taste definitely reflects that. I ordered the shrimp tacos for the main course. I really liked how the shrimp was beer battered. The fixings in the tacos were fresh and complemented the shrimp very well.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly on the patio. There was a DJ playing live music which wasn t too loud. I am excited to see how much this restaurant will grow in the future.
Gabriela's Downtown,205,Went for happy hour and it was amazing  Perfect friend or date spot. Looked over downtown. Haven t tried any food not on the happy hour menu  but their queso is soooo good. I could eat it everyday if it was healthy to eat only cheese. Got the Popsicle Michelada and it was very yum  but damn  There was so much.
Gabriela's Downtown,206,I d wanted to come here for a while  it s supposed to be a really vibey place  but it didn t pass the actual vibe check. First of all  when you apply to be a hostess  or assign someone hostess  you make sure they are capable of being the face of the restaurant. It s the first person you see  interact with  and start build an opinion of the establishment with  truly. You want them to at least seem friendly and accommodating. This girl just wasn t. She looked down and said  how many  in such a negligible tone that we didn t even hear her really and then she just kind of waited for us to say something  so we said  three . We were walked through the inside past the bar and to the outside patio to our seat. The inside and cute as was the bar. The outside was cute as well but the tables were very little  they did not accommodate well our drinks and food but the server was quick to remove plates and such so that there was enough room. My sister s mule was so strong that she told me to taste it and I was so glad I had ordered a Michelada as her drink was not enjoyable at all. The food was honestly simply OK... as were the drinks. I think I could ve handled all of this and really not been very upset but the very last straw was that the music was so extremely loud that it was giving my six-year-old sensory issues and he was having to cover his ears and was very upset and begging to leave. The animals on the patio also seemed very sensory overloaded. So really as a mom that ruined it for me. The view is very lovely and I think this place has awesome potential if it can tweak out the food and drinks and hire an amazing hostess 
Gabriela's Downtown,207,Below average. We ordered the house margarita and a mule and they were both nasty. I ordered the shrimp tacos they were not great. Enchiladas were also not good. We ordered queso as an appetizer and it was a solid. It tasted fine but was not easy to eat. Probably just nasty cheese.
Gabriela's Downtown,208,Ambiance  5 stars Drinks  3 stars Food  3 stars Had been trying to visit this place for the last years but could never justify their long 2 hour wait. Visited Austin for my birthday and sat at the bar while we waited for our table. They gave us an estimate of 2 hours but our party of 8 was seated in about 35 minutes. The drinks could be better  margaritas did not hit. I got the aguachiles which were amazing but everyone else wasn t crazy about the food. The ambiance and music of this place is amazing  This is a fun pregame dinner before going out to the bar 
Gabriela's Downtown,209,BEAUTIFUL   Amazing delicious place is so cute food was delicious. had the marg flight and chipotle enchiladas
Gabriela's Downtown,210,Its very nice a bit pricy but I hate to pay 8 dollars for parking all the time they have they own parking system I think and its 8  dollars
Gabriela's Downtown,211,If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Im from Houston and have seen this place all over my Instagram and everything looked amazing online. I get there with my boyfriend I go to the restroom while my boyfriend waits for us to get sat. I come back after 5 mins and he still wasn t greeted or sat. We then started looking around and finally someone came up to us to seat us. We get seated and everyone ignores us..I could you not we waited 20 mins for someone to come take our drink order. Here s when things start to get even worse. We get our drinks and appetizers   I ordered the flight of drinks 6 10 and my boyfriend orders the michelada 5 10 for the appetizer we got the queso flameado 2 10  and as soon as we got everything a swarm of gnats start to attack us. I ve never been so bothered and disgusted. I had to ask our waiter if we could please sit outside. He had a bad attitude about it then came back and told us yes. We finally ordered  we really wanted the birra tacos but they only serve them Saturday and Sunday mornings  which we had no clue about. so we ended up both getting the 2 tacos plate with rice and beans he got the tinga 10 10 pastor 4 10. I got tinga 10 10 and steak 3 10. Over all the food was VERY over rated. We did leave 20  tip. But I will never come back to this place again ... and if the decide to make one of these in Houston  please do better.
Gabriela's Downtown,212,Great food and a great environment. Taste like home made food. Margaritas were delicious too
Gabriela's Downtown,213,Full Disclosure  I am part of the Austin Food Blogger Alliance and this is where we had our Food Blogger Happy Hour  so food and drinks were provided at no cost. However  I was not told or encouraged to write a review  I just felt compelled to.  Holy WOW. I ve often said that all of the best  authentic Mexican restaurants were priced out of downtown long ago and now visitors must Uber to the hidden gems outside the city proper. NO MORE   Gabriela s  while slightly out of the skyscraper part of town  is a quick walk from any of the popular hotels and well worth it. I cannot remember a single bite that wasn t absolutely delicious. The drinks were gorgeous  influencers  take note  this is one of the most instagrammable spots in town    the meat options were just as good as the vegetarian  and you can tell that the brother-sister duo that runs the restaurant has truly put their heart into this family-inspired menu.  Standouts were the queso--no yellow cheese dip here  it s stretchy white cheese served in a sizzling skillet--Gorditas  and Carnitas. My favorite drink we sampled was the Pi a Loca Jarritos.  Everything about this place was excellent  the food  the drinks  the service  and the decor. I will definitely be back to try more and telling all my friends 
Gabriela's Downtown,214,This is a cute place with a darling patio  I m struggling with the rating because I was a little buzzed  okay a lot buzzed when I showed up. To start we ordered the queso and it seemed like there was more salsa in it than cheese but it was still really good. We also ordered the salsa because yup you have to pay for salsa at this Mexican restaurant. That s an automatic star deduction in my book.   For my dinner I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos. They were delicious and I loved the rice. I wish I could have eaten the beans but they come with sausage in them and I don t do pork but for pork lovers I m sure they re amazing.   This is definitely not a bad place to dine and the patio is so charming  Just wish they d give complimentary salsa.   
Gabriela's Downtown,215,Do you happen to be downtown  amp  want authentic Mexican food   Be prepared to pay for parking  amp  leave knowing it was worth it 
Gabriela's Downtown,216,Long time regular here  I have been enjoying their drinks and brunch for 3 years. Their chilaquiles on the weekends are my absolute favorite  and their jalape o poppers are great. Don t miss out sitting with the cute  amp  charismatic bartender in the glasses  Felipe  and sweet Flaca  always so kind and generous.
Gabriela's Downtown,217,The food is overpriced for the quality. We got the chorizo queso  the Milanesa  and the mole special. Flavors were mids at best. Meat is low grade. Drinks were solid. Parking costs are misleading  you have to purchase in   at least  6.50 increments  even for an extra 30mins. The system of reservations is ridiculous. Told us an hour and we couldn t wait there. So went on a walk. Half an hour later they called and said we had to be back in 5 mins. Took us 10 mins to race back  so we had to wait an extra 35mins because they bumped us to the bottom of the list. Once seated it took 15 mins for even water to arrive. Table next to us was vaping in our faces and the restaurant wasn t enforcing any COVID regulations. Way too many tables seated. Music was also so loud you could barely have a conversation.
Gabriela's Downtown,218,The food and service is amazing  I got the birria tacos with rice and beans. The food was fresh and delicious. We also got a pitcher of frozen margaritas. The outdoor patio was spaced out appropriately to follow social distancing guidelines. A beautiful view of downtown while you enjoy the music played over the speakers and food. I will return here again and again for brunch 
Gabriela's Downtown,219,YUM    Wow. The queso and salsas were all great. The drinks were delicious. All of us enjoyed our meal. I had the sopes which were AMAZING. We will definitely be going back 
Gabriela's Downtown,220,AMAZING FOOD  we were quickly seated  amp  food arrived even faster  I would definitely recommend their choriqueso on your next visit. Amazing music   ambiance  and nice staff. Nice sized portions  we were able to eat half the next day . Such an amazing experience we are coming back two days in a row 
Gabriela's Downtown,221,I have been wanting to try this place for a long time now. I finally tried it last night. The parking always has been a deterrent  and it will be again  because it is not good at all. They have a small driveway with pay parking  which has really gotten expensive since I have been out  Past that there is a really muddy lot. I ended up parking across the street on a side street and having to cross E. 7th traffic.   There was a 40 min wait at 4pm on a Saturday. No big deal  I wasn t in a hurry. Wait for my friends to arrive at the bar. Didn t see the QR menu  wasn t asked if I needed a menu  just a not friendly bartender. Ordered a margarita  because I knew I would wanna try something plain before trying a specialty cocktail. Was carded at the bar. I m 49. Really nice compliment  I suppose  but definitely weird. I don t look 20. Friends were not carded. We all look the same age.   Ordered ceviche and a couple more drinks. Waitstaff changed shifts and our first guy was super nice  the next guy was rushed and didn t listen. Ceviche was super delicious  but only came with two tostadas and no chips or salsa was given. Got the cucumber mezcal drink and it was super yummy. Here s my biggest problem  besides mediocre service  the drinks all had a heavy aftertaste of bitter lime rind. It was stuck in my mouth for a couple of hours. Very off putting  I don t know why they would do that    Good flavors  besides the lime rind  but probably won t return. Too many marks against them and other better options nearby.  You can definitely feel that there is a lack of management here. From the hostess  to the bartender  to one of the two waiters we encountered  it didn t feel like they wanted us there. Next time  I ll just go to Licha s where the food and drinks are always solid and it feels like home. This place just feels like a money grab with bitter lime rind drinks.
Gabriela's Downtown,222,Happiness is nothing compared to what I feel after experiencing Gabriela s tonight.  We flew in from Miami today and got to the hotel at 9pm. Decided to check on Yelp and Google for great options to eat here and this was one of them. Enough reasons to be spotted as one of the best options  awesome service  Salvador took care of us and he went above and beyond to make our dinner fabulous  from the Food selection to the wonderful drinks  everything was spot on. Great atmosphere  DELICIOUS and AUTHENTIC Mexican food and let s not even go to drinks and cocktails... OMG FANTASTIC  What a great way to start the weekend in Austin. This place is a MUST when you come to Austin.  Also and very important now a days  they re very careful in reference to Covid measurements. If you love tacos and margaritas  this is your place 
Gabriela's Downtown,223,Visiting from Houston and decided to join my cousin and sister for brunch.  I am an original Austinite though.   When arriving host tells us we have an 1hr and 45min wait. It s 11 45am. We say ok and wait  figured we would get a drink and hang out. Host and waiters are not good at communicating nor welcoming. Everything is unorganized in this restaurant. We were told to sit on a barstool to wait in line to get a drink at the bar. Then we were told to go wait outside and just one of us purchase the drinks. I understand this is a small house with tight walking space but there is a way to communicate to your guest. After getting our drinks and 45mins later we were called to get seated. The host tells us to snap the QR code to pull up menu. While trying to do that another waiter or host has their guest behind us and instead of saying  excuse us  he uses his hands to tell us to  spread out  and move out the way. All in all the experience was not a good one.  1. The QR code s should be on the table instead of the host table.  2. Host should communicate a proper way of getting a drink at the bar while waiting instead of looking at us like we are lost and just in the way.  The food was great but the experience was not worth it. I don t need Instagram photos of cute drinks and neon lights. Great service  good vibes and food is the whole reason to have brunch. I won t bother going here again.
Gabriela's Downtown,224,As a home-grown Texan  this place was delicious  although it s not the  classic  Tex-Mex you ve come to know and love as a Texan. The queso is more like grilled cheese and gets hard quickly  but don t get us wrong  we still ate it... We also got the salsa sampler  although only the top two  on the spicy side  were good addicting. The margs  classic type  were good and the cucumber mezcal  spicy  marg  was delish. We also ordered the chicken tinga and the pastor tacos  which were good  The tacos come with rice and beans  that  when combined  are amazing  We were also  luckily  greeted by a mariachi band  as we entered  which really set the stage for a great night 
Gabriela's Downtown,225,I like the atmosphere of this place. The drinks are very aesthetic but not strong at all. I don t like paying  15-20 for just a cute drink  I want some bang for my buck. I do like their food but every single time I have gone my stomach has gotten very upset... possibly from the amount of cheese I consume  Worth it to me but my friends won t go with anymore.
Gabriela's Downtown,226,WARNING  SCAM ALERT    To start off  my food and drink were delicious. Now to the bad... I got my check and it was for  39 and change. They took my card and returned with my card charged for  52 and change. I was confused. I only had a party of 3 so it couldn t be the 20  charge of 5 or more. Especially because that would have been over 20 . I was looking at my check for at least 5 minutes and all of a sudden before I could even say anything my waiter came and said  OH  I ll fix it   before I could even get a word in. To me this shows they intentionally over charged me. It took another 10 minutes to resolve. So if you eat here  enjoy the food and drinks but double check your checks 
Gabriela's Downtown,227,Good place for birthday dinners  the patio has a DJ and the vibes are amazing. However  the tables and chairs are basically just lawn furniture  that could improve. Food was great       Only downside is that they don t have parking so you have to pay for parking and they don t have that many spots. So I would recommend taking an Uber there.
Gabriela's Downtown,228,Came about a week ago just to stop in for a couple of Gabby s margs. Amazing. The tamarind syrup and chili salt rim are quite fantastic. We came back for a Sunday brunch and had a wonderful time. Weather was perfect for the patio. Great view. The civiche micheladas are something dreams are made of  don t underestimate the size and amount of civiche you get. Well worth the  16 as you could have that as a whole meal  All of the food was delicious  Love the music and ambiance of this place. Will definitely come back for happy hour.
Gabriela's Downtown,229,We recently dined at this location on 06 20 2021 and I don t think we will be back for awhile. It was a Sunday afternoon so a longer wait is expected. We were able to sit at the bar and grab drinks which was GREAT. However  the table service was extremely lacking. No one came by to take our order or even drop off water in 15 minutes. My partner went to the hostess to let them know at which point the hostess pointed out our table to the waiter taking care of our section. He continued to not serve us but instead serve every other table around us. After an additional 10 minutes of not being served we got up and left.
Gabriela's Downtown,230,Gabriella s Downtown is quaint  amp  a certain humble ambiance to it. There s definitely something on the menu that grabs your attention with intrigue to try it. Food I would say is spectacularly seasoned well  amp  not bland whatsoever. The Birria de Res y Consom  is my personal favorite to say the least  although I don t have a photo to share. Drinks can be a bit pricey  amp  sadly they re not mind-blowing to consume. Just because it has Bad Bunny  amp  J.Balvin or any other artists  name attached to the drink or featured photo on the drink  does NOT mean it s gonna give you the best bang for your buck. If you re asking yourself if I got suckered into getting one  I most certainly did  amp  it was wellmediocre. Breakfast items are NOT available during Dinner  amp  vice-versa.
Gabriela's Downtown,231,Service was 2 out of 5 stars Food was 3 out of 5 stars  Micheladas though... those were 5 of 5 stars  I m a michelada fanatic and have tried many places in LA  Kansas  Dallas  Miami and the micheladas at this place were amazing. Just for them I would go back. In fact I did stop there before leaving Austin  one hour earlier they were closing  the host didn t want to sit us  when I asked if i could just order a drink at the bar  they said they were busy and were closing soon so they couldn t take more people not even for drinks     Hmmmm ok. Would I go back  Yeah  I think so  only for the micheladas. Still  I would appreciate if they improve in their service and food  their prices are a bit too high for their food and customer service quality.
Gabriela's Downtown,232,Let me just say  the food was amazing. HOWEVER...the service was complete pig poop. My great granddaughter and I went for brunch today and expected a young and fun experience  but the music was extremely loud that I could hear the colorful music from the parking lot with out my heading aids. We tried to check in for a table but the hostess was drinking on the patio where she had no shoes on. The place was packed because no one was doing their job. There were dirty tables everywhere which gave no one a place to eat  and making the lines longer. I probably waited about 30 minutes to even request a table and about a 45 minutes later  they set a folding table and two crates on the sidewalk for us to receive service. Our sweet and handsome waiter came to check in with us every 20 minutes  but refused to take our meal orders until he finished his cigarette. Our food took an additional 50 minutes to come out of the kitchen  and there was something that resembled a tampon in my rice  Lucky me because my great granddaughter needed one  I tried to take a snap shot  but a stray dog took my phone right out of my purse    Will not be coming here again 
Gabriela's Downtown,233,Growing up by the border I grew up with Mexican food as a staple in my diet. Gabrielas makes me feel like I m back home eating my grandma s food  The music and the atmosphere is unmatched. I highly recommend for anyone wanting to eat authentic Mexican food and perrear.
Gabriela's Downtown,234,Overall 3 stars....good food  good service  but the music volume was obnoxiously loud  You could NOT  have a casual conversation
Gabriela's Downtown,235,First time trying this restaurant and we were not disappointed.... had the choriqueso it was awesome  great drinks... atmosphere was just outstanding  We will be back soon   
Gabriela's Downtown,236,Leaving a review as a heads up to others planning to visit during Covid. I called a week ago and spoke with someone who confirmed they would accommodate a single table indoors with 6 guests.  That was not true upon arrival on Sat night.   We were told they could only seat 6 OUTSIDE....mind you  without any heaters available   on a chilly night. Or we could split up our group of 6 to 2 tables   but they could not be pushed together.   Understanding CDC guidelines continue to change  I recommend calling the day of to verify your table options as they are not taking any reservations at this time
Gabriela's Downtown,237,Definitely will be coming back to this place. We went on a Sunday and got there before noon. I had read the reviews beforehand about a wait time. It s true  you re going to wait more than 40 minutes. Let me back up to parking. One thing I didn t read much about was parking. First off this location is on a hill. There s street parking. There s also a parking lot nearby you have to pay for. I m not a fan of that parking lot on a hill with rocks. Our wait time was about 40 minutes but got lucky and was able to be seated outside in less than 20. Never made it inside. Seating outside started a little rough as there was a person coming up to people asking for money. They left came back got water and threw it on a customer who hadn t even entered the establishment yet. Staff redirected the person multiple times. They eventually went away. After that it got better. I ordered the Pina Para La Ni a. The drink is served in a pineapple. I learned you only need one . My friend order the Gabby s margarita. She loved it. The drinks and food did take a little to be served but worth the wait. We ordered the birria tacos. They were delicious. Can t wait to go back 
Gabriela's Downtown,238,Wow.  Where do I start.  Let s just start off by a troubling trend I have realized on my last 3 visits to Austin.  Most of the food here is overpriced and mediocre.   I came here because it was the top suggested restaurant near where I was staying and I had the 2 taco plate  Al Pastor  which came with rice and beans. The Pastor meat was seasonless and stewed.  Pastor meat is supposed to be charred and thinly sliced and full of flavor.  This version had neither.  The tortillas split in half when I pick them up spilling out all the ingredients which means they were store bought  had been refrigerated and were not fresh.  Rice was avaerage and lacked seasoning.  Also  the charro beans tasted strange and had slices of hot dog in them.  Wait... what   Hot dogs  I have never seen that in my entire life and I m of Mexican decent.  Finally to top it off  an overpriced tamarind margarita served in a cocktail glass for  9. Unfortunately I was hungry so I finished my plate but I wasn t happy nor satisfied with my meal.  Total cost with tip  30.    Now believe me  I m not a cheapskate and I have no problem paying  30 for a meal but I do have a problem paying that price for below average food. Maybe their main chef was off on this day but the reviews did not come anywhere near my experience.
Gabriela's Downtown,239,I found it. This is our new favorite authentic interior Mexican restaurant.  We visited this past week with a couple Mexican friends. My wife had the sopes  which were incredible  the best I have had anywhere in the US. I had the enmoladas  which were very good. My friend had the aguachiles which were excellent  almost as good as those from El Bucanero in San Antonio - and that s a high bar   There were so many other things in the menu I wanted to try like the tinga and the tortas cubanas. Everything in the menu looked delicious.  In addition to good service  it was very reasonably priced  We are definitely coming back for more.
Gabriela's Downtown,240,Drinks are great  food is okay. I ordered a cucumber mezcal-Rita  which came dressed with a chamoy and chili rim  sweet and spicy   which was delicious. I would have ordered another one if it wasn t lunch time and I had to go back to work. The food on the other hand was alright. My rajas y crema tacos were either not seasoned or under seasoned. Definitely not something I would crave  but it wasn t bad. Chips and guac was good  but the chips needed salt. Overall it would be a great spot if they d just be a little heavier with the seasonings.
Gabriela's Downtown,241,I really loved this super fun place. Love the lively atmosphere and the margarita flight. Would highly recommend and will be back.
Gabriela's Downtown,242,Waited up front for about 15 minutes while the host  probably about 15 with the shortest dress on  was flirting with some older men at the bar. She was completely rude in seating us and brought waters to us. Spilling a bunch of water on my friend and turned and left. No sorry no napkins. Also this place is LOUD. And plays club music at 1pm. Server was slow to get to us and was impatient that we couldn t hear him. Food took about 45 minutes to come out and it was very bland. The marg was made with the cheapest tequila you can find and tasted very gross. Couldn t even tell the server because he never came around. Very sad because the place is very cute but everything else was so trash.
Gabriela's Downtown,243,Great atmosphere. Drinks were good  and food was amazing  I especially loved the queso flameado and street corn.
Gabriela's Downtown,244,Gabriela s is a popular location and there s no doubt as to why  The birria tacos are always amazing and the view from the patio is the cherry on top 
Gabriela's Downtown,245,Parking is a nightmare and be careful there is parking patrol giving out Tickets and booting left and right.  They told us a 45 minute wait and it only ended up being about 20.   We had the michelada beer  margarita  queso  and carne asada tacos.   I wish we would have gotten the shrimp aguachiles instead of the beer because it would have been a bigger portion and the sauce leaked into the beer which made it gross after while.   The queso was a block of melted cheese so you can t really dip your chips in it  you have to slice off a piece and place it on your chips.  The asada tacos were just ok but the beans on the side were incredible  .  Fun and loud atmosphere  not family or kid friendly.
Gabriela's Downtown,246,I ve been to Gabriela s probably 5-6x times and even brought out of town guests here.  Every time I m here  it s wonderful   When I first started coming there was no wait and you could be instantly seated.  I think the masses heard how good this place was because now anytime you try to go after 6pm  there will always be a wait.  The drinks are tasty and atmosphere in the back is fun 
Gabriela's Downtown,247,It was my first time their and I ve heard amazing things about this place. Yet  the server was really rude and demanding when I asked what would he  recommend he just stared at me and went to the next person. Unfortunately when I ordered my food it was the wrong order so I switched it for something else. When eating the charro beans their was a small rock in my food. Working in a restaurant industry and having this terrible service let alone something in your food was the worse. I will not be going their anymore when I come to Austin. Definitely not a place I would recommend.
Gabriela's Downtown,248,Went here for my BFF s bridal proposal and this place was so cute. The food was good and it had very good vibes. The people were nice and the drinks were good   And they also had cute places to take pics  
Gabriela's Downtown,249,Gabriela s South Park Meadows  Receipt is still showing 900 E 7th St. but we tried the new location last night. I have been to the downtown location for brunch and it was good so thought we would give the new location a try. It was an hour wait which we expected but the pretentious way to get into a restaurant was over the top. Hostess looked like she rolled out of bed. Gave no indication she worked there. We were instructed that no kids after 8  and we must show our ID s  and a 5.00 cover charge. Am I going to a restaurant or a club  But we have waited this long  so I m committed at this point. We show our id s only to be branded with a huge stamp on my arm. We finally get seated and our waitress was very green. Bless  she tried  Drinks came out slow and when we finally got them  they were awful. Nothing but sugar. I have had the drinks at the original location so this was unexpected. Food was not the best  asked the waitress if she could suggest anything and she didn t really know the menu. Ordered a queso flameado and it was rubber cheese. Ordered shrimp aquachiles and the shrimp came out so tough it was hard to peel them.  At this point I m still trying to make the best of it. D cor is cute  Great photo ops. But what bothered me is there was zero effort to change this place up from the original bar it was. Lipstick on a pig  There was a sign on a tree outside referencing the old bar. Nothing in this place has been fixed up and the bathrooms are the same disaster as they were as the previous owners. I had enough when I went to the ladies  room and there s .75 cent soap dispensers from the grocery store filled with water  During a pandemic. Same old hand dryer too  no paper towels.  DJ was a lot of fun  Great photo ops  Service was bad. Drinks and food were a hard no  We ended the night with walking to TGIF for an amazing Mexican martini.
Gabriela's Downtown,250,Always a good time going to Gabriela s  The choriqueso is 10 10 and the flight margarita is a great price. This is the brunch place go to  The DJ always plays very good music.
Gabriela's Downtown,251,I love this place     Great food  fast service and amazing music    GM Jessica M is committed to great service and is very friendly. She never fails to fix any problems or concerns we have.
Gabriela's Downtown,252,I ve been coming here since 2018. Felipe and Flaca are some of the friendliest and most attentive bartenders. Always feel welcomed  Of course  they also make some of the best drinks. Flaca s Gabby s margaritas are so refreshing  Felipe is a pro behind the bar  his drinks are top tier.   The veggie choriqueso is a favorite of mine but they have many great apps. The guacamole and esquites are always a solid choice. Their avocado cream enchiladas and their torta de bistec are a great choice. Try ordering a few apps and plates to share is the best way to get to try everything    The vibe here is unlike any other restaurant in Austin  The DJ play all the hits that you think you re at your cousins wedding. We ve had many celebrations here and the servers are always accommodating. Theres usually a wait but try grabbing a drink at the bar. Park down on San Marcos and walk 
Gabriela's Downtown,253,This is a cute little place downtown I actually found this place on here and the reviews were awesome   I tried their special michelada with candy  So tasteful   It s small inside but their patio is really cute and has plenty of seating. You have to pay for parking as well.
Gabriela's Downtown,254,Gabriela s Downtown has the best Environment  The music  the food  the vibes are just all around amazing  The DJ was so good  amp  everything he played made me want to dance the night away  The food was 10 10  The guac was AMAZING  The torta was definitely my favorite  Very authentic and filling  The drinks were also so fun and good  I would recommend the flight as a starter  amp  then move on to the fun drinks  ex  bad bunny drink   If you re in Nash with friends and looking for dinner before hitting the bars  I would recommend   
Gabriela's Downtown,255,We actually visited the one located at South Park Meadows.   The food and atmosphere was great    My little girl wanted to hear Selena music and asked the DJ and he obliged.   Our waiter was great.  The food was even better.  My son had the seafood soup and said it was sooooo good. The waiter even brought our daughter some sweet tea in the Bad Bunny drink pouch.   The adult beverages were fantastic   
Gabriela's Downtown,256,Nice place... don t get me wrong but I think it can be a little better. First  when we got there we went up to a host to get a table and she was very childish. Basically brushed us off  gave us a wait time  then turned back around to talk to her friends  which didn t look like they worked there. So that kind of rubbed me the wrong way so we went to the other entrance and spoke to the other host  which she was extremely nice and helpful.   Me and my friends ordered drinks and they re pretty good  but expensive for the amount you get. The food... idk if it was cause the time we came or just cause their food is just not that good  We ordered our food and it came cold  amp  also expensive for the basic stuff you can get at a regular Mexican   Tex mex restaurant  Not at all what we expected considering all its hype  amp  being my first time there with friends.
Gabriela's Downtown,257,Great ambiance and amazing vibe. The pineapple margarita is a MUST  The staff are very accommodating and helped us change seats due to poor weather. Many thanks 
Gabriela's Downtown,258,My family and I were so excited to visit this place because we were told it was a super cute and trendy place to eat. The wait wasn t long given it was a weekend night  we had looked up the menu online ahead of time and when it came to paying the prices we were charged didn t match the ones online. When we spoke to the manager she told us that we were supposed to scan the QR code that was posted at the entrance  if the menus weren t the same why still have them up on google   8 for an agua fresca when it stated  3.50. She ended up giving it to us for the price we saw it for but was a little rude about it  not sure that we ll be back but the place itself was cute.
Gabriela's Downtown,259,Really great spot. They had an amazing DJ  DJ Zetroc  he was great  The outdoor seating is nice and the queso flameado is a must try    The guacamole is good as well. The gringas were not that good and wouldn t get them again. But would come back here for the music and the queso flameado
Gabriela's Downtown,260,The highlights -  1. Their warmed patio with heaters and an enclosed tent for three winter months  plus the cute decor around Christmas    2. The veggie queso fundido   So tasty and plenty of chips and tortillas to enjoy it with.  3. Their pitchers of margs  Arguably a bit over priced  but really yummy.  The downside was the taco plate that I had. I really didn t care for the meat in the taco and the rice and beans just tasted like they had been microwaved from a can - not impressive.  I can tell this place would be great for a happy hour with great drinks and apps  but I would have to be hopeful about trying some of the other entrees to go back for another full meal.
Gabriela's Downtown,261,We were here on a Sunday night. Walked from Rainey street. The food was so good. Service was great. Loved the music and relaxed vibe. We are picky about our Mexican food. Loved it. Drinks will put you in a great mood 
Gabriela's Downtown,262,Positives  fun drinks and cool outdoor seating   Negatives  If you wanna go to a restaurant and NOT talk to the people at your table  then go here. The music is so loud that my ears are still ringing. My party was tempted to pay the DJ  100 to NOT play for an hour. I did NOT come here to throw some a   at 1pm on a Sunday  I just wanted to hang and chat w my girls
Gabriela's Downtown,263,Saw this place on Tik Tok and wanted to go.  The food looked good the place looked interesting.  Well   the food was ok  the place was ok the service was bad bad BAD      Service was s-l-o-w      By the time my food came out it was cold.  I just ate it.  I didn t want to have to wait another 20 min to get re-heated   In a nutshell....this place was awful     
Gabriela's Downtown,264,Came back for actual food  dinner  and it was disappointing. Stick to drinks if you come here
Gabriela's Downtown,265,This place is so trendy  It has a really nice vibe. There is a cute patio area with an amazing downtown  capitol view. Came to this place because I ve heard HOW FUN the drinks are and I was not disappointed. Got a passion fruit margarita in a capri sun style pouch and it was yummy  Also ordered the queso which was to die for- it was topped with flavorful salsas  fresh guacamole  and meat  It also came with corn tortillas that seemed to be authentic. YUM. Took off a star because I m unsure about the cleanliness of the place  but otherwise I d say it deserves 5 stars.
Gabriela's Downtown,266,This place is so delicious. We started with the cerviche followed by queso. I had the avocado cream enchiladas and my friend had the Asada tacos. Our service was amazing  thank you Alex and the other guy helping us  I m sorry I can t remember your name  We will definitely come back
Gabriela's Downtown,267,NOT GOOD. I had heard good things about this spot  but the food and drinks were awful. tiny portions too. we ordered the house frozen margs  and they were completely flavorless. we ordered micheladas and it just felt so gimmicky with a tomato popsicle. tacos tasted like dog food. chips were too greasy. will not go back.
Gabriela's Downtown,268,Gabriela s has good food  great drinks  a nice porch with a view of downtown  and a fun atmosphere  I highly recommend this place if you like tequila and mezcal  a variety of michelada combinations  and a brunch atmosphere that screams  Sunday-Funday    Be prepared to wear earplugs if you show up during brunch and are opposed to sustaining hearing loss. But also be prepared to dance 
Gabriela's Downtown,269,Omg some of the best Mexican food in Austin  Everything is five stars from the food to the drinks to the service. Go here for a chill vibe and amazing tacos queso and drinks 
Gabriela's Downtown,270,Found this place from the viral hype. Overall drinks and the aesthetic of the environment was met  just didn t have the best service. Took a very long time to be attended after being sat and we were found waiting on drinks even though we would ordering them by 2. It was a Thursday so might ve just been the weekend buzz. Food was good  nothing crazy delicious. More of a place for the vibes than experience.
Gabriela's Downtown,271,amazing ambience   We found it on our way to another place and decided to drop in. The music is blaring and the food drinks are delish    We will be back   We tried the pineapple and pastor tacos
Gabriela's Downtown,272,Placed order through grubhub for my lunch at work and got an email from grubhub that my order had been confirmed by the restaurant. Then when my driver arrived to pick it up they told him they didnt have what I had ordered. Now I don t get to eat lunch. Thanks Gabriela s 
Gabriela's Downtown,273,If you want to feel like you are at a nightclub in the middle of the afternoon  sip on margaritas that taste like cough syrup while sitting in really hard metal chairs  this place is for you  Tried this place out for Happy Hour today and had the opposite of a relaxing time. The music was SO loud and awful  we were yelling at each other to be able to communicate. The drinks were terrible. Giving them 2 stars because the food wasn t awful  mediocre at best. Checking that place off our list for good.
Gabriela's Downtown,274,Overpriced  parking is not good.   I love Gabriela s  The food  while not out of this world good  is very solid. Pricey for what you get  but you re not going to be let down. My favorites include the tacos doraditos  kind of elevated flautas with a creamy and crispy cabbage  amp  crema mixture  as well as the elotes. The cucumber mezcalrita is delicious and refreshing. Great place to enjoy some mezcal  amp  micheladas with a view.
Gabriela's Downtown,275,Wandered in for a Margarita  get the Gabby s  Yum   and a real quick bite.  The Burger   Hamburgesa Chipotle  rocked  skip the Papas and get it with charro beans.
Gabriela's Downtown,276,I had high hopes for this place  but won t be going back. Sad to say that though the service was good  the music was loud  drinks were bad and food was just okay.
Gabriela's Downtown,277,I really don t understand the hype around this place. Bad service  overpriced  and average food. Having to pay to park doesn t help their cause either. I m never coming back to this dump and would suggest you spend your time and money at an establishment that actually deserves it. If I could give 0 stars to this place I would.
Gabriela's Downtown,278,Honestly the paid parking option just shows exactly what type of greedy business this is. You have to pay to park on top of paying to eat inside of the restaurant. I m from Houston and there is ALWAYS a free parking option. This place is packed  loud and not worth the trouble of waiting. We didn t want to deal with the noise or the hassle of finding parking elsewhere because all of there 12 pay-for spots are taken so we ordered to go. It was good but not better than a local taco truck with none of the problems listed above.
Gabriela's Downtown,279,The food speaks for itself  And JULIO was amaaaaaziing. He was on top of everything and just so friendly  I wish i can give him more than 5 stars lol
Gabriela's Downtown,280,This place is definitely worthy of 5 stars. Authentic food awesome drinks and amazing ambience  
Gabriela's Downtown,281,Totally grossed out - received a glass that had lipstick on it...when brought up to staff they seemed to not think that it was a big deal. We re in a pandemic  y all. Makes me think that dishes are not being washed properly or at all...beware 
Gabriela's Downtown,282,Food was pricey and just ok  had one server for the entire restaurant so service was slow  only redemption is that the drinks are pretty good. other than that  probably won t be back here.
Gabriela's Downtown,283,Everything was so good  Can t go wrong. Definitely get their margarita flight. Come hungry as you will leave stuffed.
Gabriela's Downtown,284,One of the best authentic Mexican places I have ever been. The food was fast  fresh  and delicious. Drinks were even better  Price point isn t bad either  Would definitely come back
Gabriela's Downtown,285,We drove an hour to eat here since I saw it on Facebook and let me tell y all it was worth the drive the food was delicious the music and atmosphere was great the best part was they told us it was a 2 hour wait so we decided to stay grab some drinks and 20 minutes later they sat my group of 5 down  Lucky day for us our server was very nice attentive and food came out 20 minutes after that. Overall everything was perfect everyone enjoyed the food and the drinks and will definitely be back soon       
Gabriela's Downtown,286,Great place to have a meal while in Austin. The view of Downtown Austin is perfect and the atmosphere in the restaurant is great.
Gabriela's Downtown,287,Went for brunch .... Food was amazing. I moved from San Antonio  and couldn t find anything similar till today. The migas was so good. And the aqua loco sp   with fruit was AMAZING. The dj played all the best music.
Gabriela's Downtown,288,Great service and amazing  authentic Mexican food. Had the avocado crema enchiladas and they were fabulous. Boyfriend got fried shrimp tacos and loved them. Margaritas were great and not too sweet  Will definitely be back.
Gabriela's Downtown,289,Tacos are my very favorite food. Period.   Okay that s out of the way.   I was with a bachelorette party and our group was able to make a reservation for nine. It took a little while to be seated  but once we were  the staff was so accommodating  A handful of us ordered the shrimp tacos and were all verrrry pleased. The tortillas were absolutely out of the world  and the shrimp were cooked perfectly and were super flavorful. I can t remember what the rest of the girls ordered  but everyone was happy and left with a full belly 
Gabriela's Downtown,290,I thought this was going to be hype food but it was actually pretty good. It was post storm so some stuff was limited but the tamrindo drink was decent and they had Mexican coke. I enjoyed the carnitas tacos with a birra set up  they ran out of the birra butttt the server was cool ans made it work with carnitas  and my boyfriend liked his migas  We want to go back and sit outside and I want to try more cocktails.     recommend for cool vibes and decent treats    service was attentive too   
Gabriela's Downtown,291,Gabriela s is the perfect summer spot. Located on a hilly corner lot  the colors  music  food  and drink  make this place a standout. We arrived on a Saturday around 1pm and were able to easily find a parking spot around the corner from the restaurant. There was a small wait but they have covered tents with fans to sit while you wait. Once we were seated on the patio I noticed that they had a live DJ who was playing some awesome music. it was over 100 degrees in Austin on Saturday but thee fans and the covered patio made it seem much less hot. We ordered the shrimp aguachiles  birria taco plate  mango whiteclaw preparada  and classic frozen margarita. Everything was soo good. the birria was seasoned perfectly.v It was juicy but not greasy. The rice and beans were extremely flavorful. the aguachiles were also amazing. I could have drank 2 of the preparadas. The ambiance of Gabriela s and the quality of the food brought us back a second time during our trip. This is a must-go If you are in Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,292,The service was absolutely terrible. The waitress was kind of stupid  but the manager helped us resolve everything. Do not recommend going unless you like going to a shit show.
Gabriela's Downtown,293,Amazing drinks   Can t wait to go once they reopen  Super friendly staff  A must    The drinks were large and very filling.
Gabriela's Downtown,294,Horrible service  cold food. When they are busy they have horrible service. Went for Mother s Day and my gf bday. Hostess was argumentative waitress was no where to be found. Seated around 1345 and didn t finish until 1600 due to having to hunt waitress down to order and pay. To the point we all made sure we knew exactly what we wanted because we didn t know when we would see her again. Hostess was the worst though  she was prob a smart remark away from getting told a little about herself but in fear of spit in my mothers food we kept our cool. After all the wait the al pastor was bland  the rice was cold and dry  the beans were room temp like our stuff was just sitting getting cold before brought to us. I will not return and will share this experience with everyone who asks about my Mother s Day celebration. Terrible
Gabriela's Downtown,295,Great spot  With great food  Don t let the location fool you  Ordered the chicken tacos and cucumber margarita. The food came fast and the staff took care of us. This is during COVID-19 so you have to download the menu. The margaritas are freshly made  None of that simple syrup stuff.
Gabriela's Downtown,296,This place aight I guess but I mostly go to see Bugz at the bar. The food is whatever but Bugz know exactly how to make my drinks and he funny as a mf. If you downtown after work or whatever and want some tacos  a marg  and a laugh go to see him at the bar periodt.
Gabriela's Downtown,297,This place has a nice ambiance. The person that greeted us at the door was very pleasant and friendly. He sat us in a nice little area to ourselves which was great because we both are types that don t like crowded places. They continually checked on us for more water and anything else we might need. I just had water and a milanesa torta. The sandwich was a good size and it came with yummy crispy fries but the meat was so thin and possibly over cooked that made it taste not as great as it looks. If it were more than one slice of meat and not too fried  I m sure it would have been perfectly delicious because I have tasted their tacos at an event and they were good. The staff is a five star. They were on top of things with a great friendly attitude.
Gabriela's Downtown,298,I take NO pride in writing a bad review.  I usually won t write of late  I won t write a bad review unless the experience was so bad on so many levels that there is absolutely NO excuse for what s going on here.  Sadly  this is one of those experiences.  Here is the run down.  I came across a news article on this place which mentioned they were expanding to a second location and reviewed some of their food.  Using the logic that if they are expanding they must be good and the photos and and review of the food were amazing   I was determined to try it out.    I grabbed my bae and said I found a Mexican food place I would like to try out for dinner wanna do it   Mexican food  ah YEA    So off we went.  When we got there the first thing we experienced is they only have a very small parking lot  there is no street parking out front or back.  If the lot is full  you will have to go to the end of the block and search for parking there.  When approaching the restaurant which was on a Friday night noticed a few people waiting outside and music playing loudly  luckily we like all kinds of music so that was not a problem for us...until...I will come back to this.  Walking up to the the reservation desk you go through a cute patio area climb a few steep steps and your greeted by a flashy neon sign  trendy wall paper and just a little more of a hint of something s not right but nothing alarming...at first.  It s funny how a little of time waiting helps you sort through the initial vibe your getting  I should have listened to my instincts  but I am a fan of not judging a book by its cover and my bae wasn t running for the hills so we hung around...for an hour.  The vibe I was getting something is drawing people here but some of the wait staff were sketchy...like high on crack sketchy   Then there was the obvious minimal effort the owners took to rehab the interior of this house turned restaurant  it really made me wonder what the kitchen looked like and who the hell was preparing my meal.    Finally  we were notified our table was ready and we were escorted to our table on the back patio were the music was playing.  Ok so here is when things take a drastic turn for the bad     The patio is a relatively small space  the whole restaurant is probably under 2  0000 sq ft  we are now seated directly in front of a DJ booth were the music which once was tolerable and somewhat enjoyable from outside is now rattling every bone in your body and no doubt damaging everyone s hearing.  The waiter shows up within a  couple of minutes in a face mask  thank goodness  and as he is standing there looking directly at us we are pretty certain he saying something but we can t hear him and so we lean a little closer and ask him to repeat himself  after which he bends down and leans in and asks if we want to order any drinks or appetizers.  My bae wanted unsweetened tea which was on the menu and the answer we got was   we don t serve tea here  we were a little surprised by that response given tea is on the menu  so my bae replied but it IS on the menu and in return the waiter said   yea but we don t have tea.   Ok  fair enough so we nod and I quickly order a margarita feeling like I really need it right about now and my bae orders some horchata.    As we sit there utterly unable to have any conversation because of how loud the music is  we are just sitting there looking at each other and looking around.  Lots of drinking going on  on the patio.  Those that were really drunk were screaming back and forth at each other  those that were trying to enjoy the company of each other where literally face to face and many others rarely talking or looking at their cell phones.    Finally the food and service.   We were both hoping that at least the food better be good after all this.  I had the taco plate  carne asada and carnitas  and the bae had enchiladas.  My leaned way over and said the enchiladas were really good   My tacos were just good  nothing too special  and looking nothing like the pictures.  The tacos are better than Torchy s but not as good as  say Discada.   The margarita is the only thing that kept me willing to stick this experience out and with my bae not drinking I could tell the experience was excruciating so we through the food down  called for the check as we looked at our last few bites and got the hell outta there     I will just leave this here  NEVER COMING BACK  NO MATTER WHAT 
Gabriela's Downtown,299,Always a great experience coming here. Drinks are frio y sabroso. Food es bien riqu simo.  Came on a day that Mexican martinis were  6 so had to order one and was not disappointed. You can sub salt rim for tajin rim. Charro beans are on fleek and the meal itself was very filling. HIGHLY recommend coming here. On Saturdays there s cumbia brunch and most days there is a drink special. Plus a tight GoT drink menu which is a super awesome fun thing they are doing. If you re looking for delicious ATX TEX-MEX food  look no further than here. Locally owned and operated.
Gabriela's Downtown,300,the were verr accommodating with my food algeries. margaritas were on point and they have fun bags with sippy straws. liked the raygatone music played. relaxed vibe great for brunch
Gabriela's Downtown,301,Big fan of Gabriela s downtown  I ve been there several times recently and I am pretty impressed with their consistency.   The have easily the best drink menu and appetizer selection of all the Mexican Restaurants in Austin. The Micheleadas they offer are INSANE and the margaritas are almost better    Food is pretty good but can be a little bland at times. Drinks are awesome but can take forever. It s understandable  but sometimes the food beats the drinks to the table.   Location has a nice view and they also place some fuego music on the back patio   
Gabriela's Downtown,302,We popped into this cute little restaurant right as we were entering Austin. We were on our way in from the airport and decided we wanted to stop for a quick snack and drink to start our weekend off in Austin. This place looks quaint and festive from the outside  it s a little quieter and homier on the inside than expected but still cute with good decorations. And the food and drinks hit the spot and the happy hour prices couldn t be beat    There weren t many people inside  so we sat right away. They have a long menu of different margaritas with all different flavor profiles  that actually deliver the flavor they list  My marg was nice and smokey and spicey while also bringing a refreshing element. Their salsa sampler is delicious with multiple different types of salsa ranging from sweet to smokey to creamy. And the homemade chips that came along side were delicious as well. The queso we got was no ordinary queso  it was stacked up with different ingredients  almost like nachos but instead of the base layer being chips  it was a gooey cheese dip. The service was friendly and attentive  there are really no complaints. This place hit the spot on food and drinks 
Gabriela's Downtown,303,I have been waiting to try this place for a while and with the bars just re-closing a brunch was necessary. This place has the coolest drink menu and the decor is very fun. I had my very first mangonada and it was magical. The guac was super creamy and the chips were great. I have seen this style of taco on IG from LA trucks and I ve been dying to try them. They didn t disappoint. The rice was very fluffy and beans had sooo much flavor. All and all I think this may be my new favorite brunch spot. Parking is spotty  but it s what you expect in Austin. The only things was that it seemed really packed for covid standards. I felt safe at my table but would have left before my meal if seated on the upper patio. I ll probably wait a while before coming back  but I will be back.
Gabriela's Downtown,304,Nice cozy place for Mexican cuisine in town. The drink was delicious  it got me pleasantly drunk. The table is pretty small for 2 people though.
Gabriela's Downtown,305,Being raised in the border I know what some of those appetizers and drinks should be priced at. I dig the ambience  food is okay  drinks are good too. However  they are over priced.
Gabriela's Downtown,306,I had been wanting to come to this place for a while and final did and it did not disappoint. I had the margarita flight which was a perfect way to get introduced a few different drinks they specialize in. The staff was awesome and so attentive. Parking is a challenge but other than that I loved the experience.
Gabriela's Downtown,307,Always a fun time at Gabriela s. It is def our favorite brunch spot when we come to Austin from San Antonio. The food is always good  the drinks are delish  the staff is very friendly and helpful  and the music is always good  Can t wait to go back for another brunch date 
Gabriela's Downtown,308,We came to Gabriela s for their Galentine s celebration  and it was perfect  Thankfully  we were able to get seated immediately despite what a busy night it was. Michael was our server  and he was PHENOMENAL   He kept our drinks coming and made sure to check up on us periodically. The food was decent. We got the salsa sampler  and I got the ceviche. The ceviche has the right amount of kick to it. I would recommend it  We enjoyed the margarita flights and the live music  It was such an enjoyable night filled with great music  good vibes  gorgeous drinks  and gal pals   We ll definitely be back again 
Gabriela's Downtown,309,Food was incredible. Y all really came through during this 2021 snow storm when most restaurants were closed. Had the cubana torta which was an insane amount of food  but delicious. Will definitely be coming back
Gabriela's Downtown,310,Cute joint with cool drinks and good food. My Mexican husband and sister in law loved this joint. Amazing drink options with good micheladas and margaritas  with fun Latin music to boot. My husband and I may have started dancing to bachata in the middle of the dining hall   The only annoying thing was how crowded and busy it was  but I guess that s the norm in Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,311,First time here food was great  Mike the bartender was super friendly and super attentive  Really enjoyed this spot.  Will be coming back for sure   
Gabriela's Downtown,312,I come here often but the service just keeps getting worse. They advertise but cant follow up with the good expectations. I m reasonable when it comes to a wait but when your not sitting people due to the kitchen. That s ridiculous and the host pick and choose who they sit and when. This is not how a business shouls conduct its business especially a popular one.
Gabriela's Downtown,313,This place is absolutely amazing  Food..service...drinks...all of it just . Anytime I am in the Austin area or passing through it s definitely a must to stop in to Gabriela s 
Gabriela's Downtown,314,I had such a good time a Gabriela s   I absolutely loved all three of my drinks  I had the Gabby  margarita  the Pina Loca and the preach moscal mule  I had the ceviche and it was very authentic and flavorful  Our waitress Mary was so sweet and paid the perfect amount of attention to us  We even got to chat with a few of the other servers and they were amazing as well  I highly recommend a sitting on the back patio and enjoying the wonderful view of downtown 
Gabriela's Downtown,315,Amazing service  atmosphere  food and drinks  Tastes like authentic Mexican food in a city of Tex-Mex. The service was spot on for a busy Saturday night. Our server got our order completely right without writing it down  always risky  and never made us feel rushed. Their enchiladas are amazing.
Gabriela's Downtown,316,Absolutely the best Mexican I ve had. Let me just say I don t review things often. Not my forte but I went out of my way to express how amazing this spot is. Outside seating in the sun is nice  drinks are made just right Mexican style   and the food is spectacular....get the chorizoqueso you won t regret it 
Gabriela's Downtown,317,Got to finally make it to Gabriela s after living in Austin for 4 years. I ve heard amazing things about the atmosphere  drinks  and food which I did agree with but after today I m hesitant to return.   When we first arrived we eagerly reviewed the menu picked some drinks out and waited for our waiter. When we ordered he asked us for our ID s  we re both 22  amp  pretty young looking . After presenting my ID  he began to hesitate and verbally question whether or not the individual in my ID and myself were the same  we are--it s me . I said yes  amp  asked if it didn t look like me  granted I m only 22 and my ID is still a picture of me from when I was in high school   When he then answered he said   te miras mas delgadita en este foto.  For my non Spanish speakers that means  you look much skinnier in this picture .   Hurt and shocked that I was just called fat  I turned bright red and my boyfriend rushed to answer for me and said it was me. He then finally asked me what my full name on the ID was. After answering he still was hesitant but said he d give it to me anyways.   I was hurt and shocked and my boyfriend was ready to leave  but I insisted staying because I wasn t going to let a machismo man ruin my Saturday afternoon.   The food was amazing and the live music was incredible  but before you consider this location maybe give yourself a self pep talk first.
Gabriela's Downtown,318,The food is just  okay  I can t say I would come again. I m in Austin often and I have experienced much better taste and quality. The food was cold and my drink was warm. Nothing special about this place. Chips and salsa are extra.
Gabriela's Downtown,319,I don t frequently give 5 stars on yelp but this place truly deserved it. The man and I hit this up on a whim because it caught our eye last time we drove by and we were not disappointed. Lloyd was our server  we sat outside with the pup to enjoy the nice January afternoon.  We let him know we hadn t dined here before and he was quick to explain the menus and make suggestions. We ended up trying the choriqueso  tacos al pastor  chicken mole tacos    Cool as a cucumber with Tequila and the So Fresa so Clean.   Drinks were made perfectly.   The queso came out first in a sizzling skillet with fresh made corn tortillas not the kind you have to overlap but a nice thick homemade tortilla and seasoned homemade tortilla chips.   Meals came out promptly the mole was so similar to what we grew up on and was my personal favorite. The Al pastor was very good. I d say it could be a tiny bit more tender but very close to what I m used to. Charro beans  pickled onions and nice soft Mexican rice accompanied the meal.   I wish we had room for dessert I m sure it doesn t disappoint.   Lloyd did an excellent job and even sent us home with our extras and fresh tortillas. Thanks for a great afternoon. We will be back.... tomorrow lol
Gabriela's Downtown,320,Too cute  I went here for happy hour with my friends and will definitely be back. The inside is pretty adorable. We sat at the bar.   Micheladas are my favorite  so imagine how excited I was to see that they had a great michelada with a twist on the menu. I had the Miche-Helada Pop  which has a mini popsicle made of the michelada mix to keep your drink cold and tasting yummy.   It s also in a great location for walking to a few other places with good happy hour deals.
Gabriela's Downtown,321,This place is great - food is so good  and the server  Lloyd is the best  He s very nice and attentive and went out of his way to make our experience great.   The chips are very fresh and SO crunchy - one of the best chips I ve had in a while. I also ordered the tinga de pollo tacos and they were absolutely delicious. So flavorful and really really filling.   It s a bit out of the way along the highway but worth the trek.
Gabriela's Downtown,322,Would give this 3.75 stars  3.5 for service  4 for food.   Pros    Hands down the  best handmade  tortillas. Each dish had fresh ingredients  all were wonderful recipes.   Recommended dishes  Carne asada tacos  tinga de pollo tacos  vegetarian tacos  guacamole starter.  Fun vibe for friends to go out.   Con    If all you want variety  this has a small menu.  Great for tacos though    However  the main reason this got dinged was for service. The person helping us was great. The person in the back serving food was another story. I ask quite a few questions about ingredients because I have a few allergies  and each time I would ask  and request something different  he was visibly irritated.   If this doesn t bother you   or you don t have allergies  would definitely recommend you give the food a go. It s wonderful 
Gabriela's Downtown,323,Excellent food  We ate every single bite  The service was great. We ordered the choriqueso and we basically licked the skillet clean  So yummy   My husband ordered the aguachiles and I had the gringas al pastor. Both entrees were really good  I hate to admit it but this Mexican food is way better than what we have in San Diego  I guess we are Tex-Mex fans at last  Oh I can t forget the chocoflan  Definitely a great way to end the delicious meal 
Gabriela's Downtown,324,The service is great here even when it s busy and chaotic. We cans on a Saturday and it was packed but got seated inside. The food and drinks were great   And it was super affordable .
Gabriela's Downtown,325,Waited for an hour and a half to get seated for a group of 6. Not to mention larger groups were getting seated before us even though we had been there longer. Certain menu items weren t available by the time we were seated. Overall food was good but needs help with management with regards to seating.
Gabriela's Downtown,326,Honestly the only good thing is the cheese. The parking  the service  the wait time  the vibe is going for a club but it s not  and did i mention THE PARKING   10 bucks to sit and wait for a table. Another 10 for the meal. Awful. That should be illegal to even have the thought of making customers pay for parking. Food was alright nothing special. I would pass. Hard pass.
Gabriela's Downtown,327,The only good thing about this place is their music. Drinks  amp  food are alright but everything is disorganized  amp  overpriced. My grandma cooks better food than this   amp  it s the real shit not this wanna be mexican food. Their wait system is also stupid  amp  they love to sit their little friends before people who have actually been waiting. Masks  amp  Social distancing also aren t enforced. It s a no for me.
Gabriela's Downtown,328,Don t bother.  They  ain t seating no people  right now. Ridiculously bad service.  Also why isn t there free parking  
Gabriela's Downtown,329,My gf and I got here at 10 pm on a Friday night  and the host told us they were all full and were no longer seating people but there were numerous tables empty and they closed at midnight. When we were leaving  we saw they were seating people who walked in after us. So rude.
Gabriela's Downtown,330,In my opinion this place is over hyped.  Good- great view of downtown  pretty drinks.  Bad- parking is limited. Food and drinks overpriced. I got the aguachile and there were literally 8 shrimp in there. That s. 20  dish. After talking to the manager he got some some more shrimp which is why I give this place a 3.   Also one stall bathroom. So long line.
Gabriela's Downtown,331,Unique and delicious food  The music out on the patio was super loud when we first sat down  but they adjusted and we really enjoyed sitting outside having a few drinks and dinner. We had the queso appetizer - it was really good  once we figured out how to eat it. Not sure if it wasn t hot enough or if the cheese just isn t a melty one  but it wasn t very dip-able. Margaritas and tacos were great  would definitely come back next time I m in town 
Gabriela's Downtown,332,This rating is mainly based off their customer service and our waiter. We came here on a Thursday evening for a good friends birthday. Myself and another arrived late to the dinner  but when we had arrived they had mentioned they already ordered drinks but had been waiting about 15 min so far. When the waiter arrived about 10 min after I sat  the rest of us quickly put in our drink and appetizer orders. We got our drinks and were ready to order  our waiter seemed very dazed   Asked him simple questions about the menu and it was like he was completely out of it and confused. After taking our order  our appetizers finally came out. The stars are honestly because the Choriqueso is BOMB as hell. Would have preferred to eat them with their homemade chips but their homemade flour corn tortillas were very good.   Our service wasn t the greatest from the very start  he was scatter brained. But what really prompt this review is what after when the birthday girl order her second margarita in those pineapple cups. The birthday girl  who had been a waitress while in college  witnessed the waiter dropped the decoration for her drink and then put it BACK IN. Her drink was also also leaking allot and for some odd reason he still thought it d be okay to give it to her.   So the birthday girl didn t want to say anything  but another person in our group actually manages a restaurant here in Austin and just couldn t let it go. She went in spoke with the manager and he came and spoke to us and apologized and then after Gabriela herself came and asked us how the service was.  What really resonated and irritated me is that neither the manager or Gabriela offer to comp the birthday girl drink or offer her something for the inconvenience... on her birthday. Like not even a little desert . Just a   oh sorry that happened   . Just on a customer service standpoint if someone had these issues  i would try my best to regain their trust so you continue to visit us  I hate leaving bad reviews  but it s just like ... dang both the manager and owner didn t feel the need to do anything about it
Gabriela's Downtown,333,Long wait  pretty mediocre food  and even once you do get seated it takes forever to get service. Rude hostess.
Gabriela's Downtown,334,LOVE this place. Our first time in Austin  and we stopped in during happy hour.  Their margs  especially the one served in a pineapple was awesome. Great homemade chips and the tortillas are exceptional.   If you re a local or from out of town it s a must see  Super cute patio too.
Gabriela's Downtown,335,Our first food in Austin was at Gabriela s after we bailed on the Franklin Barbecue line that was within walking distance. We sat in the patio area  which offered a variety of options in the sun or shade and appreciated the responsive service. The Salsa Sampler had some good options  but the guacamole looked like it was straight out of a bag--unlike the other guac we had on other dishes. The Chorizoqueso was a delicious blend of foods and flavors  but quickly gelled after the cast iron cooled at our table. The Chicken Mole tacos had a great flavor and tender meat.
Gabriela's Downtown,336,We went for happy hour to  relax after a long day. We sat outside and received service shortly after. The cocktails are very good and they are very good at making sure you always have one in front of you. The queso was good but difficult to eat  I guess it made for a fun experience. All the food was very tasty will definitely be going back.
Gabriela's Downtown,337,My absolute favorite place in ATX by FAR     Let s start off with the drinks and happy hour. hahaha is 3-7 everyday folks  with  5 drink specials which destroy all the craft cocktails around. My boyfriend got the Pina para La Ni a and it was actually freaking incredible AND gorgeous. I stuck with the Gabby s Margarita with has a delicious chili lime salt that has me addicted. Not too sweet  not too spicy.   Let s move on to the queso. So it s not your typical drippy  saucy  queso. This queso has bones and is served in a skillet with chorizo  a LOAD of guacamole  and is drenched in sauces. Really loved this take on queso. Also got the trio salsas  GET IT       The avocado style one was my fave  but the chipotle was a close second.  We split the Sopecitos de Tinga de pollo. Melt in your mouth  fresh  seasoned  ridiculously tasty. Must get. It s the best sopecitos I have ever ever been eaten. The chicken was so tender it melted away in my mouth.   I just have no words. I want to transplant this close to me   Service was impeccable and Gabby is the cutest
Gabriela's Downtown,338,My namesake  yo  This restaurant is in a house  and it is adorned with bomb-a   Rainbow Brite wallpaper  and dope art  think bueyes and Selena  queen of Tejas . It is decked out with a patio  full bar  and two separate rooms for dining. Listen to me  it s so cute and worth your time. I ordered the chicken sopecitos  doused them in Valentina  and had a bite of the street-style Mexican corn my husband ordered  a buttery take on the classic. The chicken sopecitos were just right  crispy on the outside  buttah on the inside.
Gabriela's Downtown,339,Y all  this place is the tits  From the music to the atmosphere to the service to the food quality. It s worth the wait. The aguachile taste like it does back in Mexico fresh off the beach. My family and I were SO impressed  we will be telling everyone and coming back  The drinks are strong and the food is fresh and flavorful  Do tell.
Gabriela's Downtown,340,Gabriellas downtown is a great spot for happy hour  everything you get is five dollars and they have a gorgeous patio you can see a view of Austin. The dishes were amazing and everything came out in a timely manner. We didn t pay more than  35  for a whole meal and 4 margaritas. The queso had a great cheese pull and all the toppings made it easy for everyone to enjoy. The taquitos were so filling and tasted great with the salsa. I wish we could ve tried the salsa flight because the salsa we did try on the tacos and the queso were unbelievable. We will definitely be back to try everything on the menu. It s a great spot to go with friends to just hang out and talk have a few drinks and eat some amazing food
Gabriela's Downtown,341,Gabriela s immediately popped up in the Yelp app when we were looking for Mexican food for lunch - and I m glad it did   Tiny paid parking lot outside which yes will cost you money but will also give you an outstanding view of the Austin skyline. Inside resembles a small home where you could envision your mother cooking in the kitchen. Each room has a few tables and chairs and one room even houses the bar.  Our waiter was super friendly and efficient. He didn t rush us and made sure everything was correct. For drinks we had the frozen strawberry margarita housed inside a pineapple. Delicious  And very refreshing on a warm Texas afternoon. For my entree I went with the enmeladas which ultimately were enchiladas with a great mole sauce. The rice and beans were also delicious.  Prices are fair and you get a ton of food. The drinks alone are worth it. Everyone is friendly but that could also be typical southern hospitality.
Gabriela's Downtown,342,Went here for brunch. It s honestly just ok. Service is descent  and the idea that it s a house turned into a restaurant is pretty cool. Drinks look great and there was a cool dj in the back patio seating. Food is over priced and just ok.
Gabriela's Downtown,343,Friendly attentive service  scrumptious food and appropriately stiff drinks in a comfortable  quaint old house set just off downtown.  Watch the  other half  endure rush hour on I35 while sipping a refreshing adult beverage and noshing on some choriqueso during their 4-7 pm happy hour.
Gabriela's Downtown,344,Best place I ve eaten at in my life   Great music and create staff   I shall return soon 
Gabriela's Downtown,345,We were in town for the weekend and spotted this place because it has my sister in law s name and I m so glad we did. It was Monday so they have all day house margaritas for  4. Be sure to ask because it didn t say it on the menu  But I saw the sign in the bathroom. I had the chicken tinga tacos which were delicious  My stepdad got the torta with the 3 meats and it was also very good. Cute spot 
Gabriela's Downtown,346,On a whim decided to come here on a Monday night because we were craving tacos  wanted to try something new - and our favorite spot was closed due to AC problems.  Took an Uber  pulled into the alley between the Shell and the restaurant and my immediate reaction was WTF  this is the spot that always seems to have good restaurants  but I ve never visited. I was so excited to finally step inside.  The interior is perfect. The people working there are very friendly. And the food is DELICIOUS.  Their queso flameado is very good. Reminds me of Tres Amigos queso flameado back in the day. So good. Chips and tortillas were the best. Salsas were good  too.  The fried shrimp tacos were my favorite  So crispy and delicious  and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. My other half had the carne asada tacos - he said they were delicious  but devoured them before I could have a taste  so I ll take his word.  On the quick Uber home I mentioned that I would gladly eat here again if our fav spot is closed in the future. I was met with a quick response of  We re definitely going there again - it s better than  insert name of favorite restaurant   
Gabriela's Downtown,347,SO happy we decided to try this place. Prepare for a long wait for dinner because the restaurant is a bit small  but you can sit at the bar and have one of their delicious cocktails while you wait. I loved Gabby s Margarita and how they load the Taj n onto the rim. The Choriqueso was some of the best queso I ve had in Austin  which is very high praise  of course   and the avocado enchiladas were rich and delicious as well. Will definitely be back 
Gabriela's Downtown,348,Loved the vibe at Gabriela s.  Went Friday night when we got in town  enjoyed the food and drinks so much that we had to return for brunch on Sunday.  And let me tell you  this place is hopping.  Drinks were amazing    Music was great   Food was on point.  Service was quick.  Can t wait to go back.
Gabriela's Downtown,349,Our waitress was great even when my friend was a total PITA. She was polite and professional. The food was excellent. The drinks were yummy.
Gabriela's Downtown,350,The food isn t bad and the DJ is good. BUT the service is lousy. The drinks came after the food and what I ordered was wrong.  Also  the bathrooms are dirty. This restaurant Not worth the wait
Gabriela's Downtown,351,We stumbled upon this place after seeing lines along the block at Franklin BBQ.  We were starving.  We drove by and stopped in.  What a find.  Excellent margaritas and gorgeous tasty food.  Highly recommend
Gabriela's Downtown,352,Food is ok.  Looks better in pictures than it actually tastes. Let s talk about the service though...AWFUL   We waited  and waited  AND waited for our order to be taken.  5 times  another table s order came to us.    The waiter asked us what we wanted to eat.  As we began talking  he walks away and starts talking to another table.  It was actually comical how terrible the service was.would not recommend at all.
Gabriela's Downtown,353,Short version  Amazing patio with a view  great drinks  choriqueso is the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a .   Long version  After hanging out around the east side for Sunday Funday  my friend looked at me and said   I want queso.  I couldn t agree more and after a quick yelp search for queso nearby  Gabriela s came up  When we pulled up to the lot  we realized we had to pay for parking  boo  but then we were taken aback by the cute renovated house. Inside  it wasn t very busy and the bartender told us to seat ourselves. We picked a great spot on the patio where we got an amazing view of Austin s skyline.  The patio is also dog friendly.    My friend got a beer and I started with the mangonada which was delicious  The menu said there would be a tamarindo candy straw  but there wasn t one  Which is fine since the delicious concoction of mango and chamoy was enough for me. We started off with the coriqueso and oh my goodness gracious  I could ve eaten it by myself. Here s the breakdown   It s more of a fundido than the usual queso dip. It s a small skillet of ooey gooey cheese topped with different salsas sauces  chorizo crumbles and aguacate. UGH  They give you a basket of chips as well as fresh  and yummy  tortillas. It is SO GOOD.  Afterward  we shared some tacos  pastor and carne asada. They were good - not mind-blowing. They were heavily doused with avocado cream and salsa so I didn t get to taste the meat.  The verdict  Four stars. Everything was great except for the decent tacos and the paid parking. I ll definitely come back to try some other dishes.
Gabriela's Downtown,354,Loved going here    the food was fresh with tons of flavor and the margaritas had the perfect amount of tart sweetness. will 100  be back 
Gabriela's Downtown,355,I can t speak for the food because we didn t stick around to actually eat because the drinks and service were that bad. We came on a Thursday night and had to wait way to long to order food. My margarita wasn t worth even drinking even though we already paid for it at the bar  my husband had to go get it because our waitress was nowhere in sight . Even if their food was good I wouldn t recommend them. There s way too many good places in Austin to waste your time here.
Gabriela's Downtown,356,We really enjoyed Gabriela s. The food and environment were great. Would highly recommend the Flameado cheese  Sopecitas  and Gringas.   Nice to have a classic Mexican food restaurant in the heart of downtown.
Gabriela's Downtown,357,This is some of the absolute most flavorful Mexican food we have had north of the boarder. Gabriela s is excellent  do not pass it up 
Gabriela's Downtown,358,The food was AMAZING. I had the quesobirrias and they were very rich in taste  authentic Mexican food  NOT TEX MEX. Our waitress was very nice  the tamarindo drink was very good. They have a great selection of cocktails that were very tasty. This restaurant is very trendy and popular. The wait time was almost 2hrs but VERY well worth the wait.
Gabriela's Downtown,359,Good god  whichever god you want to name.... how to you manage to make the worst tacos ever  and in Austin TX for god sakes. This place has a nice trashy ambience with views of the gas station parking lot from the patio  nice view if that is your kinda thing.    The guacamole and chips were tasteless  the Aguachile ceviche was ridiculously overly spicy  looked like served up slop and with way way way too much Chile  and Jalepenos  which made it very unpleasant to try to eat.  The Gringas Tacos made us want to barf when they came out  scorched and gross with way too much cheese  spilled over and burnt to a crisp  since they put these on the griddle after prep and burnt the hell out of them.... disgusting. We took them home and reconstituted them into compost.
Gabriela's Downtown,360,Ahhh this place is awesome. The drinks  the music  the FOOD  The choriqueso is the best with the corn tortillas. Literally drooling. The Asada tacos and chicken flautas are the move  May be my new fav restaurant in Austin 
Gabriela's Downtown,361,We joined friends here for brunch and were impressed.  The food was excellent along with the service.  We had the chorizo gorditas and French toast and the queso. The food was great along with the service.  I have yet to find a good authentic place like this one in Austin.  This place will not disappoint    Note  parking is on the west side of the building and is owned by the city so there is a fee meter .
Gabriela's Downtown,362,Kinda disappointed by dinner at Gabriela s. My expectations were high  and the food was meh. I shared a tasty choriqueso with friends. My asado tacos were the disappointment. The meat obviously wasn t grilled as I expected  but stewed or sauteed some kinda broth. The shrimp in my friend s Diablo tacos also tasted a bit bland under all that hot sauce. At least the thick  corn tortillas packed flavour. Friendly and on-the-ball waiters and decent margaritas  but these don t compensate for the food.  There is much better Tex Mexican food on the East Side  and obviously across the rest of Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,363,My boyfriend and I was in here at least twice a week. The meals seem more like appetizers. My food  aguachiles  was so flavorful and delicious  and it was not as spicy as I am accustomed to but that s probably best for other people. Every bite of the shrimp was flavorful. The drinks are super strong and the margarita in the pineapple is super cool and delicious. The drinks are delicious  a bit pricey. Overall amazing experience and definitely will be returning back here 
Gabriela's Downtown,364,This restaurant is amazing. Food and drinks are really creative  Try the prepared Mango White Claw  it s great  Cool atmosphere and views. They only have one drawback but it is a deal-breaker. They play good Mexican music but it s REALLY LOUD. You can t hear anyone else and having a conversation there is 10x harder than in a regular club  and this place is just a restaurant. Just for that I don t think I d go again but except for the lou music it s a great spot
Gabriela's Downtown,365,If you re looking for a relaxing dinner with all the stops  go here. The food  drinks  and atmosphere here are amazing  Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating.  It was a beautiful night so we sat on the patio and watched the sun go down behind downtown Austin. The drinks were very good  I had the Gabby s Marg and my mom got the Cool as a Cucumber with regular tequila versus mezcal. Both were delicious and went down way too easy. The cucumber had the perfect amount of spice in it. I got the Asada tacos and my mom got the shrimp tacos. They were both awesome but the real mvp was the street corn  esquites .
Gabriela's Downtown,366,A more upscale Mexican joint with a fairly traditional approach  but still catering to the Austin s standards of breakfast tacos and avocados on everything.    I ended up going with the Cubana torta based on its pictures. I knew this thing was massive  but it s surprisingly doable for one  hungry  person. The sausage stood out the most  but overall it had a great flavor. The jalape o slices were fresh and brought some zing to the plate. The steak was a little chewy at times  but that s expected with flank steak. The avocados and cheese further enhanced the fatty profile of this meal without feeling overboard. The bread was pillow soft yet sturdy. They didn t do much to the bread  but never did it get dry or overbearing. The fries had a great salt and oil taste  but they had no crunch. If you order tap water here  don t drink it. It s basically chalky tap water.   I didn t expect this place to blow me away  but I was impressed on their torta. Too often a torta promises the world and offers little in retrospect. This torta though put almost all the ones in Dallas to shame. I imagine they have great tacos  but I didn t want all the sides they serve with it.
Gabriela's Downtown,367,I waited three hours to finally get served. I understand the high volume on a weekend  but we were provided a false wait time  the server was rude  and everything took exceptionally long to come cold and unpleasant tasting. First time and never again.
Gabriela's Downtown,368,Mexican burger was awful. Avo cream Chkn was edible for the first half of plate. Taquitos weren t fresh. Loved their making of the michelada though  best I ve had 
Gabriela's Downtown,369,This place has been on my list to check out for awhile now  and I m glad i finally went  The vibes here are immaculate  The DJ was awesome  the skyline view was awesome  the drinks were awesome  and the food was awesome  Parking kinda sucks so come early  it s so worth it  I got the J Balvin drink  choriqueso  and the steak gringas  big fan of everything I got. I will say the only drawback was the music was a little too loud. Good jams don t get me wrong I just couldn t hear my waitress lol
Gabriela's Downtown,370,Great  great  great place.  Best Micheladas in town.  We really used to enjoy the patio in pre-COVID times.  Big fans of DJ Danny.  During COVID  we drive in for curbside takeout.  The food travels really well  even the Ceviche Michelada.  Highly recommend.
Gabriela's Downtown,371,This place is amazing   Delicious food and drinks. I have dreams about their shrimp aguachiles it s so delicious
Gabriela's Downtown,372,For a Sunday  they were busy. You must go up to the host to put your name on their wait list. We were a party of two and she mentioned the wait would be around an  hour and a half . They get your name and number and text you when your table is ready. When looking at the wait list it was odd to see a  party of 20  ahead of us. I wish they would have more restrictions on party sizes over 6 to make wait times flow better during covid-19. Once our table was ready we walked to our table outside that had an amazing view of the downtown skyline. There drink menu is impressive and everything is unique. I ordered a white claw preparada and although it was  12 it was worth it. Dressed well and had a whole lemon white claw in there. The menu has many options. I ordered shredded chicken sopas and it was the perfect size and loaded with flavor. The waiter was very busy but was there if we needed anything. Overall  I highly recommend this place to bring someone who enjoys interesting drinks and Mexican Cuisine. Just be aware of the wait time 
Gabriela's Downtown,373,Amazing food. Great people. Music is point  My fav is the chilaquiles with chicken for brunch.
Gabriela's Downtown,374,Food is good.  Drinks are good.  Parking is rough but that s not their fault.    Music is super loud.
Gabriela's Downtown,375,The Steak tacos were delicious  Service was okay but I d definitely go back for the tacos 
Gabriela's Downtown,376,The chicken Tinga tacos are amazing   We sat out back on the patio and it let you forget you were even in the city.   We went there specifically for the Margarita served in a pineapple...I will definitely go again next time I am in Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,377,Pretty good place   I came for a birthday dinner and we were seated outside in the back. It was a hot evening but they had fans. I like that they had an awesome DJ spinning some good music which definitely added to the cool vibe. The back patio has a decent view of downtown as well.  The food here is pretty good. Everyone at our table liked their dishes. In addition  the cocktails were really good too.  Overall  I would recommend this place for a casual dinner or a date-night.
Gabriela's Downtown,378,If I could give a 0 rating I would  this place has the most careless waiters. The music is good but after waiting 45 mins for one drink you re ready to go. The whole table had gotten food but me  amp  waiter seemed lost and annoyed that I asked about where my food was. This business could have a great outcome if it was better organized. Definitely disappointed and won t be coming back.
Gabriela's Downtown,379,Everything was amazing. Holy queso   I got the shrimp tacos and they were bomb.  Plus..it s a dog friendly patio with an amazing view.
Gabriela's Downtown,380,4.5 stars. Awesome place. With so many Mexican options this place was great. We had the el pastor and mole tacos. The mole was awesome. Pickled onions  strawberry daiquiris inside of a pineapple  The staff was superb. The one negative is the structure itself. It could use some comfy ambiance. Patio was great and thanks for putting on Soccer. With so many options  I think we will back tomorrow for lunch.  P.s. they have a flight of margaritas.....just sayin.
Gabriela's Downtown,381,So over all very good food we are staying in the house adjacent to the restaurant my oldest daughter ordered tinga de pollo tacos and rated them a 9 youngest daughter ordered tacos dorado  amp  rated an 8  amp  I ordered tacos asado  amp  maybe a 6 they were like egg rolls...they should write the order on the to go package  amp  the person I ordered from was clueless I still gave good tip tho..
Gabriela's Downtown,382,I wish the food was more authentic  and i wish the food wasn t served cold. Service was great 
Gabriela's Downtown,383,This was my first trip to Gabriela s and the food and drinks were very good. The atmosphere is great as well and there was even a DJ when I went around 6 00 pm. Parking is a little awkward but there is a small parking lot that is free you can park in after 5 30 a block away. Now to the reason for only 3 stars. The service was absolutely insulting. Our waiter was the most inattentive server I ve had in a long time and it didn t appear that was the case with most of the tables around us. I had to wave to get his attention on multiple occasions after sitting for more than 10 minutes without him even coming by to check on us. I had to flag him down to order  flag him down for an extra napkin  flag him down to get a refill on my water. He was very responsive to the 3 tables around us and came to them multiple times for each 1 that he checked on us.  If the food wasn t good  I would never try again but I will eventually go back and if the service isn t amazing  this rating will go down to a 1 star.
Gabriela's Downtown,384,First  I would like to start by saying that I am from Tampico Tamaulipas  Mexico. I moved to ATX about 5 years ago. So  I KNOW how authentic mexican food should test like. Of course  everyone has their own preferences  but I have built my own standards and I can be very picky when it comes to MEXICAN food. I can easily get offended when restaurants claim to serve Mexican  food  and they end up changing the true flavor of Mexico.   Gabriela s Downtown is one of the top 3 places in Austin Tx where you can find the authentic taste of Mexico. Seriously  you will not find a better rice  with vegetables  anywhere else  except maybe at your abuelita s home. The frijoles charros are incredible  they have this smoky taste  as if they were  cooked in a clay pot on a fire stock. Delicious. And these are just the sides...  Their pastor and beef are  so juicy and tasty  soft and just writing about it make  me hungry. You have to try it. Their handmade  tortillas are thick and soft. Also  they have various types of salsas. My favorite one is the chipotle salsa  ask for it .   The queso and guacamole are my preferred appetizers from this place  I recommend those. But in general all of their food is incredible  I have tried pretty much everything on  their menu. However  my favorite dishes would be the  gringas al pastor  and the  pollo sopecitos .   Now  beverages. God  they have this  Pi a para la Ni a  which is a strawberry drink served on a pineapple  shell  so refreshing  great presentation  I took a bunch of pictures of this one   and perfect for these sunny days. Also  their Gaby s margarita based on homemade tamarindo  syrup is so good. Honestly  I could write  on and on about all of their food and drinks  because I have tried them ALL. Why  because I keep coming back to this place  not only because of the amazing taste of their food and drinks   but also because of their OUTSTANDING customer  service. Everyone is so welcoming  especially  Gaby  the owner. YOU HAVE TO MEET HER  she s amazing.   That isn t all I have to say about this place   but I feel I ve written already too much. So  go check it out yourself  and I am sure you will have a great experience too when you go visit them.
Gabriela's Downtown,385,I ve only been for happy hour -   Drink special is OK... but the drinks feel watered down  and are notably smaller than their regular drink menu. The pineapple marg on happy hour is not as strong as the regular pineapple marg. The pineapple is also smaller.   This is a good place for casual Tex mex healthy girl food with a view. The view  is honestly what keeps me coming back. What makes me not want to come back  however  is the mosquitos in the back patio. BRING BUG SPRAY.
Gabriela's Downtown,386,The service was good the food amazing  The drinks were tasty as well. We sat outside which was awesome. I would definitely come here again. It is easy to walk to as well.
Gabriela's Downtown,387,Only reason they get a 2 is because the food is pretty damn good  Drinks are ok  but the service and guests make this place beyond obnoxious. Terrible service and hipster douchebags will put you off the great flavor of their food.
Gabriela's Downtown,388,Finally authentic food from Michoac n M xico in Austin     so delicious   best mexican restaurant in the area with a breathtaking view of the city at night and day  fast and friendly service 
Gabriela's Downtown,389,We waited a while to get in because we were a big party  but the food was so good   Don t even get me started on the street corn- YUMMM. The service was super fast and our waiter was so nice  Great atmosphere with a dj on the back patio 
Gabriela's Downtown,390,Good drinks and great view of downtown. Other than that the hype of this place is not what I expected. Especially having to listen to EXTREMELY LOUD music which ruins the whole downtown Sunday Brunch vibe you basically can not hear anyone you are talking to even if they are sitting next to you. The food was mediocre at best. Have had better for amount paid. Tried it once. Not sure it s a place I d go again.
Gabriela's Downtown,391,Really good food and drinks. Wait times are long though  but it was a nice day and we waited in the patio with some drinks so I guess I really can t complain.
Gabriela's Downtown,392,To me this place is somewhere you go to get cute IG pictures. Aside from that  the food is medicore. The drinks are way too sweet. And the service sucks. The hostesses were a hot mess  three of them all at the front  not paying attention and just kind of rude. The service is super rushed as well. I think they just get too busy for them to handle. It s almost always 45 to an hour wait for mexican food that is just okay.
Gabriela's Downtown,393,The food and drinks at this are great  quality is great too.  My only complaint is that their parking sucks and gabrielas takes no responsibility to what happens to their customers once they leave. I paid for parking for 3 hours and went i left i found my car had been booted. I talked to the staff at gabrielas and they said they don t control it  perhaps they should since this is affecting their clients.  I was not the only with the issue  several other cars were booted. Overall  i would consider the parking situation before returning.
Gabriela's Downtown,394,we visited the South Austin location.  first  the music was so loud we could not scream across the table and be heard. We went on a Sunday for the first time and was unaware we could only order from the brunch menu. The food was awful. It could well be the worst food of my lifetime. I tried to order unsweetened tea and was told they only serve sweet tea.  not a good option for diabetics . I asked if they had any diet sodas and the waitress could not answer the question. i ended up ordering a mimosa. Our food was stone cold. The only decent food on my plate was the pinto beans....hardly worth the cost.  The food was so spicy hot  my mouth was burning for hours. i can t believe i see people waiting outside for a table. We won t return as once was more than enough for us.
Gabriela's Downtown,395,Food was amazing  Drinks were top notch  Only thing was that the host only spoke Spanish and couldn t communicate to the person in front of me the wait time.
Gabriela's Downtown,396,We were looking for some good Mexican and anywhere that charges for chips and salsa. . . Has to be making up for something.   Their drinks are not good  way too sweet and they charge  5 for chips and salsa. . . Oh  and they didn t even have chips made to serve.  Save your money and head to other more appropriate Mexican restaurants in downtown Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,397,What I liked  tasty queso  delicious flavors  fast food  ample seating  Austin ambience  and a nice downtown view. What I didn t like  not enough parking  also some of it isn t free   mediocre rice beans  limited menu  pricey food  average service. Overall  it s decent if you haven t been before.
Gabriela's Downtown,398,Great patio view and atmosphere.  The drinks  margs  and food  tacos  queso  ceviche  were all delicious.  Looking forward to going back again.
Gabriela's Downtown,399,I really wanted to like this place but as far as Mexican food in Austin goes  you are likely better off going elsewhere.   I was initially attracted to going here through a post I saw of their margarita flight on Instagram as well as the overall atmosphere. However  I was sadly disappointed that the margaritas were some of the worst I ve had in Austin. Our whole party was pretty let down by the overall quality of the drinks since they were quite expensive. They might look good in pictures  but that s about it.   The food overall was just okay. I had the al pastor gringas tacos and it said it came with pineapple but there was not a single piece of pineapple in any of my three tacos so it was more of a al pastor quesadilla with literally just meat and cheese. I did enjoy the chorriqueso however  so that was probably the highlight of the dinner  Also  this is one of the only Mexican food restaurants in Austin that charges for chips and salsa which is just a pet peeve of mine.   Overall  service was good and atmosphere was nice but the food and drinks just did not measure up.
Gabriela's Downtown,400,This is my favorite brunch spot in town. It has great atmosphere and a bulletproof menu  not a bad thing on it  i.e.  it s Mexican food  but even the French toast is good . Plus  the folks working here are awesome--friendly and service is fast. Lloyd is the man. If you re a local or an out-of-towner  I d recommend this place if your looking for something quintessentially Austin.
Gabriela's Downtown,401,Best Tex-Mex food and margarita I think I have ever had   Every single thing everyone got was amazing  The service was also incredible  such kind people. Will definitely be coming back any chance we get to 
Gabriela's Downtown,402,My boyfriend took me here last night for my 25th birthday  neither of us had been to Gabriela s before but heard great things about. We didn t quite know what to expect we re pretty easy to please but needless to say the staff  amp  food exceeded our expectations. Alejandro took great care of us  and the rest of the staff was amazing as well. The host allowed us to choose a table and as we sat down made sure the fans were pointed at us so that we were comfortable. Another staff member  we didn t get her name  but was so friendly and engaging she even gave me a birthday shot which was a sweet touch. The food was phenomenal  I d never had Mexican street corn before and it was so good I think I found a new favorite dish  10 10 would recommend 
Gabriela's Downtown,403,Had the most unpleasant experience at this restaurant. The staff has no control of their waist list and takes no accountability for their mistakes. I got to the restaurant at 6 45 and was told the wait was 40  minutes. After waiting for over  1hr  I check in and they tell me I m not on the list. They put me back on the list to wait as a new group. I ended up waiting for 2  hours. They take no responsibility for their mistakes. I will give them a star in order to rate  but if I could I would not give them anything. They are shit  
Gabriela's Downtown,404,This place has amazing drinks and they re so cute fun... I ve been a few times and those never disappoint however I ve worked my way around the menu and have yet to find a dish that tasted good    food is very  half assed  so I will only return for drinks
Gabriela's Downtown,405,This place is legit. We had the crazy cheese in the skillet  and Mole tacos  which aren t on the menu but are fantastic. Lloyd is great. I asked what kind of red wine they had and he said  a terrible one.    Cool patio in the back. Highly recommended EXCEPT THEY NEED A DECENT RED WINE    Otherwise great.
Gabriela's Downtown,406,Overpriced... definitely not what I expected. Disappointed. Customer service was lagging as well
Gabriela's Downtown,407,Love  love  love this place  From the vibes to the food  everything is perfect for a relaxed night out. Sit outside and grab a great view of downtown. The drinks were great and the chorizo cheese was so yummy  I hear they have a great brunch as well. I will definitely be checking out this place more.
Gabriela's Downtown,408,I m writing this as I sit at the bar on a Sunday for brunch. It was a cold Sunday in Austin and Mexican food sounded good. The place was packed at 12 30 and there was a 1 hour wait  but since I was solo I found a spot at the bar.   The food was great. Queso  Ritas and Migas. What really impressed me was the service. Irregardless of who was at the bar they asked how I was doing and if I needed anything else. They were working their butts off and still looked calm and polite.   If you re in Austin and want not only good food but great service give this place a try.
Gabriela's Downtown,409,Delicious Food   Wonderful Atmosphere  We had the Veggie Queso Flameado  So fresh and flavorful   We also had the Frijolitos Sopecitos and the Tacos de Calabacitos  Incredibly good and unique combinations  Definitely will be back next time we are in Austin  
Gabriela's Downtown,410,I picked up my best girlfriend from the airport on a Sat afternoon...she d flown in from wintry cold Chicago to a gorgeous January day of about 80 degrees here.  First thing she says is  of course   I want tacos  .  We were on the east side so I yelped it  and picked this spot.    We were so excited first to see it is in the location of what used to be one of my favorite wine bars  up on a hill with a fantastic view of downtown Austin.  My girl had her little dog with her too so I went inside to inquire about that and they said no problem   Just walk it thru the restaurant out to the back patio.    When we got back there  it was LOUD...there was a DJ mixing great dance music and it was like a party back there.  At first I was put off  thinking no way could I catch up with my girl in this noise....but after sitting in the sun and drinking a margarita  all of a sudden I was wiggling in my seat and dreaming about Cancun.    The wait staff was a bit jumbled up...orders taken by different staff and forgotten but they were always super nice and we were having such a good time  we didn t care.  They brought water for her little dog and made a point to step around him in a crowded  chaotic scene.    And  get this...the food was GOOD.  She got some kind of chicken tinga boats and I got pastor tacos and they were all really tasty.  Great chips and guac too   I am not normally a Michelada girl but they had some really interesting options for these here  including peanuts and or shrimps.   I stuck with margaritas and palomas  quite tasty and booty movin.    It was definitely a win and made my little snow bird so happy 
Gabriela's Downtown,411,My mouth was watering just looking at the food and drinks here but unfortunately there was no place to park and the only place available was not safe as there was several homeless people around asking for money. The restaurant is located right next to the interstate where there are tents for many homeless and not safe. I would love to go to that restaurant when back in town as it looks super delicious but hopefully they have better parking availability for their guests.
Gabriela's Downtown,412,I thought this place was amazing. I am not from Austin but if I could recommend any where to go for tacos it would be at Gabriela s. They have a lot of awesome options for food. But I would recommend going during happy hour. A must try 
Gabriela's Downtown,413,Love this restaurant  Just had brunch and Lloyd was our sever. He was great  very attentive and kind. This is one of my favorite restaurants in ATX. The food and drinks are always delicious. Plus a great view  Get the guac and salsa sampler 
Gabriela's Downtown,414,This is one of the best and most innovative Mexican restaurants I ve been to in Austin. It cozy and authentic. Love their chicken tinga and their Mexican corn.   The drinks are really good  I love their agua de Horchata with some Flor de Ca a Rum or Jack Daniels fire. Also ask for their mezcal drinks  They are amazing  if you like mezcal . I love that the owner  Gaby  is always behind the bar working and making sure everyone is having a good time.
Gabriela's Downtown,415,Fantastic food and service. Our waiter was so sweet when we asked to switch to the inside tables. We started with street corn and salsas with chips. Best street corn I have ever had and the homemade chips were delicious. Everyone ordered different dishes and everyone was pleased with their food. My husband had the queso hamburger with fries.we actually shared our plates and his hamburger was outstanding  The French fries were delicious little perfectly cooked potato matchsticks. I had the mole covered chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The beans were so flavorful  The mole sauce was perfect. We can t wait to go back the next time we are in Austin 
Gabriela's Downtown,416,The Host station is the worst service ever... Wait was a 2 hour wait which we were okay with but their were empty tables everywhere and the youngest girl who is a host is rude and picks and chooses who gets seated first so be on the look out who gets seated before you.. I called her out on it with the manager because a customer paid her under the table to get next in line when they were just arriving to the restaurant. Hope she gets fired because the  5 isn t worth loosing customers.
Gabriela's Downtown,417,Gabriela B.    I appreciate you reaching out to me on my review sadly I couldn t reply back so I had to edit my review. I just want to state NOWHERE in my review did I mention anything about prices and the fact that you said  we apologize the prices were a bit more than you expected  is very offensive to me  for you to think I couldn t afford your restaurant when I can.  Best regards   Alani G.  I was SO excited to try this place out  but left VERY disappointed. Service was really good I give them that. As for food I will never come again. Felt like meat was reheated  rice and beans were cold and had no flavor. Sibling had got enchiladas but they had more of a sweet taste it was not appetizing.
Gabriela's Downtown,418,Three words  friendly  unforgettable service.   The staff here is truly top notch and I feel like they went above and beyond to make sure that their patrons were well fed and well hydrated. The drinks kept coming and the food was delivered in a timely manner.   If there s one thing I disliked  it was the acoustics inside. Obviously this is a converted home  and it wasn t built with the intention of having dozens of people at a time  so if you re someone who needs to eat in peace  this is not the place for you. Kudos for having Instagram-able spots around the place - Gabriela knew what she was doing when she put together this concept in a hip area of Austin. We millennials love you and appreciate you.   For parking  there is a tiny little lot just outside that you can pay for but you ll most likely need to find a spot on one of the side streets.
Gabriela's Downtown,419,They served us during the winter storm on 2 17 and were absolutely amazing    Staff was so nice especially Giselle who waited on us  So thankful when we had no water or power to have a meal  thank you  
Gabriela's Downtown,420,Drinks were amazing but the food tasted like white people trying to be authentic Mexican restaurant no spice no flavor their signature hot sauce tasted like humus
Gabriela's Downtown,421,You ll wait to get into the place. And then you ll wait some more for someone just to take your order. Came here waited 40 mins to be seated not a big deal  but then another 20 mins later and the waiter had not taken our order. This waiter literally got everyone s check  plate and order at every other table except mine. After a couple of trips of seeing him pass our table and ignore it  even when we flagged him down politely  still ignored us   my friends and I decided to speak to the manager. Who then proceeded to tell us this waiter has had this problem in the past. Ok  so you know this person is problematic and he s still working anyways  Makes sense. I refused to even try the food. This place looked ghetto AF anyways. Overhyped brunch place.
Gabriela's Downtown,422,I arrived at Gabriela s 45 minutes before closing. If you expect to pay full parking and then be turned away after waiting for 10 minutes while the Host complete their side duties then please go forward. I waited just to be told that I could not be seated because there were two other parties waiting and I was not to be considered. This is  upsetting are posted hours say differently. I spoke to a supervisor who then told me he was not in charge of parking  which is a true thing in Austin  and quite frankly couldn t help. Very upsetting  as we are just trying to support  hard to do that when you are being turned away for being an honest and hungry customer.
Gabriela's Downtown,423,Micheladas  blood marys  palomas  tacos  queso fundido  You name it  Tastes just like authentic Mexican food. Enjoyed every secon
Gabriela's Downtown,424,Flew in tonight from Boston. Went directly to yelp to look for a late night eatery. Blown away by the quality and the friendliness of the staff. Had one of the best margaritas I think I ve ever had in my life. The food was fresh  delicious  served to perfection. I ve lived in Austin for many years and look forward to having this be a new regular staple. This is a must eat at. Looking forward to checking this place out for brunch as I ve heard it s fabulous with DJs    I repeat.....BEST MARGARITAS
Gabriela's Downtown,425,Love the vibes  food and drinks  The margaritas are great and the queso is amazing  It s filling but just enough to snack on before some fajitas 
Gabriela's Downtown,426,I went into Gabriela s over two hours early to get  on the list for a table for my friends birthday. I have been a loyal customer of this place for years and I know how the wait times around dinner can be  but this time was different. I was told I d be put on the list and when the table was ready  they would text and our group would have 5 minutes to all be there. They told me my estimated wait time was an hour. After an hour  our whole group was there and went in to check if the table was ready. It was not  and they told us the wait may be another 45 minutes. 45 minutes later  they still had not texted or called at all  so we went to another restaurant. Although we didn t cancel our spot on the list  Gabriela s never texted us at all. They also were extremely rude to my friends father  and told him there was no manager on hand when he asked... They were not rude to me but they were to him  and I m almost convinced it was a race thing   he is an elderly black man . I m appalled with the behavior of employees on March 11  2021. Get yourselves together    
Gabriela's Downtown,427,We went to this place last night and man I am so glad we did  Our waiter  Llyod was amazing    The food  drinks  and vibes were SO great. I highly recommend coming here with a group of friends.
Gabriela's Downtown,428,I really wasn t impressed with this place. The best thing was the Queso Flameado. The tacos weren t that great. Both my boyfriend and I had bones in our chicken tacos that weren t pleasant to bite into. Our server wasn t very attentive. We sat outside which was cute  but flies everywhere. Probably won t go back. The mangonada looked good. I think alcohol is their big draw here.   Food  2 5 Service  3 5 Atmosphere  2 5 Overall  2 5
Gabriela's Downtown,429,Cute is what you pay for. There s a few IG worthy spots here. The restaurant is a little house that has a pay to park parking lot next to it which should not be a surprise in Austin. The food is good enough for 4 stars  but everything is small. The place  food  and drinks. The queso was a bright spot  The melted cheese and toppings are a refreshing change from the usual  queso  in town.
Gabriela's Downtown,430,Great food  service  and outdoor patio area. Nice view of downtown and capital building.  Delicious Micheladas and margaritas in a pineapple 
Gabriela's Downtown,431,Honestly if you go on the weekend prepare to be waiting for at least 1hr... they don t have a waitlist to check in on the way there like pluckers or other places and this resta is so tiny you pretty much have to sit on the street or their parking lot to wait.
Gabriela's Downtown,432,Sorry but it was not much fun. First you have to pay to park in the parking lot. Happy hour on a Tuesday was  17  2 hours . The waiter wasn t able to give a thumbs up or down on the Mexican Martini as he doesn t like martinis  It wasn t the best. Way too much olive juice. It just tasted weird. Queso flameado with chorizo was ok but Guero s is much better. Or go to Fonda San Miguel. Tacos al pastor we re just average. Probably the worst thing was the loud blaring music. Impossible to have a conversation even sitting outside.  We started inside and that was worse. If you are going to blast music maybe 10 00 on a Friday night but not 5 30 on a Tuesday afternoon. Even the waiter had to nearly shout to make himself heard. Maybe they do that to keep the tables turning. We weren t the only group to eat and run. Overall very disappointing experience. I liked the old Austin vibe but the food  drinks  service  loud music  and paid parking mean I will never return.
Gabriela's Downtown,433,I always drive by this place  so I stopped in for lunch on a random Tuesday. Glad I did  The food was awesome  but the service atmosphere was by far the highlight. Lovely outdoor patio and super chill vibes.  Lloyd took great care of me  guided me through the menu and gave solid recommendations  I got a margarita and a combo taco plate with one pastor and one tinga. I was having a hard time deciding between the tinga or steak for my second taco  and Llyod surprised me by bringing out a steak taco  on the house  so I could try all three. So nice  The pastor was my favorite  but all three were super tasty and their tortillas are bomb. OH  and most importantly - their frozen margarita is niceeee and boozy.  Anyway  we ll be back  and go check this place out. It s worth it 
Gabriela's Downtown,434,Food was amazing  drinks hit the spot  and our waitress was very kind and took care of us    Highly recommend the tacos pastor and the pina para La Ni a.
Gabriela's Downtown,435,Omg  Drinks  Drinks  Drinks are amazing  Very tasty and consistent  The food is delicious and fresh. The staff at Gabriela s are awesome 
Gabriela's Downtown,436,Great margarita in Austin. We came here for drinks on a hot 90 degree afternoon for happy hour  First round we order the frozen house margarita which was delicious. Second round was Gabby s margarita  on the rocks  - HIGHLY RECOMMEND just starting with Gabby s the chili salt rim was incredible. Definitely a great place to come for happy hour. We didn t get a chance to order their food however next time we will definitely be ordering more things to try.
Gabriela's Downtown,437,Ok this is the most disappointing place out of all the disappointing places. If you are looking for a Mexican restaurant with hipster vibes this is NOT the place. Go somewhere else. Takoba is right down the street and Licha s Cantina is on 6th  the next block  and they have much better food AND drinks. The service is okay  got no complaints there  mostly younger kids but they re all still polite. We went on a Sunday at 12pm so it was pretty busy food took a while but that wasn t the deal breaker. The real problem was the drinks were SUPER sweet  whoever the bartender was was drowning them in syrup. And the food mediocre at best. I ordered the chilaquiles with a side of stake and I will post a picture of said  steak  sorry excuse for a piece of meat that was  4 extra and was served cold with my hot meal. It looked like it was made out of rubber.  Long story short  again  this place isn t worth it. Not because it s close to downtown does not mean it s quality food at all. And if you re looking for drinks this isn t the place either.
Gabriela's Downtown,438,Came here for happy hour with my friend Aaron. Prices were decent. Street tacos were absolutely fire. Pro tip  read the marg descriptions before trying. Fun atmosphere and good music.
Gabriela's Downtown,439,Delicious tacos - I mean really so good   I had the battered and fried shrimp taco  reminded me of a Baja fish taco how it was prepared  and carne asada taco. Both were great but the shrimp was really something. Docking them a star for atmosphere and service. I was expecting a more fun environment  but it was meh and the waitress seemed bothered by us. We still had a great time but I think they could do so much to help the atmosphere match the great food  
Gabriela's Downtown,440,Gabrielas.  God awful.  We came here for late night dining.  Margarita from a mix.  Salsas meh.  Chips greasy.  We shared two plates.  One was a mole chicken enchilada type thing.  The other something in blue corn.  Both were less than mediocre.  Fun names on the menu.  The food doesn t deliver.  And the place is kinda dirty.  Still we were hungry. So we stayed.  But would never go back.
Gabriela's Downtown,441,Love this place. I would say it s a must visit if you have never been to austin because their food and drink execution is really good.  It s a bit loud on the patio but great for big groups.  It s a party.  Marg flight is a lot of fun and very good.  One bitch I have is the flies in the patio at sundown are brutal. But not sure there is much they can do after sundown they go away.  Fundido kicks ass.   And Tortas are a touch above. Milenesa is highly recommended.
Gabriela's Downtown,442,I went there for the Bad Bunny vs. J Balvin special. And I was disappointed. The beer was warm and the food didn t have much flavor. Now while I can deal w flavorless food  as a Mexican I cannot with the warm beer. Seriously  Your establishment is poppin with the Latino community and then some. You should know that we are NOT ok w warm beer. The only reason I am not giving you a 2 or one star is because the ambiance was great. I just hope that your cocktails are nice and strong and not the weak drinks you serve at Mala Vida  Hate to say that bc I m all about supporting my Latin community. But please please  Make your drinks stronger and colder. Oh you also get a plus because your staff was friend. It s just too bad about your food and drinks.
Gabriela's Downtown,443,Patio dining was a complete disappointment. The area was so freezing and the propane heaters gave me a headache since the tanks had to be replaced. Food got cold so quickly I could not actually enjoy to give a fair review.
Gabriela's Downtown,444,Okay.  The reservation was not respected. That s rude af especially in Austin where I have so many options and y all are rude on a Friday night. I could go so many other places.  You almost set my friend s hair on fire. Not a joke. I don t understand a professional environment that clearly cant understand safety standards. I am an engineer - quality standards not met in any way. I will never come back or revisit without your feedback or insight. I will spread bad word of mouth if not rectified.  Best.
Gabriela's Downtown,445,Came for a bachelorette dinner and they seated us right away outside. The view is awesome and the DJ was playing great music   Food was delicious and they even gave our table a bottle of champagne for the soon to be bride  Awesome service and great food  loved it and will be back soon 
Gabriela's Downtown,446,It is definitely over hyped   Yes it s very modern and trendy but food quality is not there. The food is not good but the drinks are delicious but over priced.
Gabriela's Downtown,447,The owner  Gabriela  was putting silverware together when we walked in. We didn t know she was the owner  she was helping out just like everybody else. After our  extremely delicious  meal she came by to ensure everything was ok and we chatted for a bit. She is really nice and this business model of friendly staff and good food ensures this business will always thrive   The one complaint is that service was kind of slow and it really wasn t all that busy. This was overlooked because Gabriela is such a great person with a friendly staff  who  were  hustling around but didn t get us our drinks for over 10 minutes.   Will be back every time we are in Austin  What a gem 
Gabriela's Downtown,448,If i was rating this place by service I received I would ve given it a 1 star. When we arrived we were told it d be a while to get us a table which we completely understood. Being food enthusiasts we know there s hardly ever going to be a place that s worth it that doesn t have a wait in Austin.  However  we stepped to the side at the entrance to wait and had two other couples that got here after us get seated first. While we were still sat in a timely manner we were still completely confused. That s not standard  right   Once we got sat the server that was in our area  middle aged bald guy  kept coming up to every table around us to talk to people  refill drinks  deliver food  etc. We were smack in the middle of his area yet we were never greeted. It felt like he intentionally wasn t making eye contact so that he could finish whatever he was doing. Again -- we go out often and are absolutely used to restaurants being busy but a   Hey guys  welcome in  I ll be right with y all   Would ve sufficed. Instead we sat there for 15-20 minutes wondering if anyone even knew we needed assistance.   Now  the reason I m giving this place a 3 is because I see a glimmer of hope in this place. The salsas tasted authentic and the choriqueso tasted like home. While the tortas we got we re not the best  I could taste that someone in that kitchen knew that the place was going for authenticity and made that salsa with love. The margaritas were also the best I ve had in Austin in a very long time  And their dedication to the Latino community is apparent.  Just look at your clientele  If Latinos are dining here  that means abuelita approves    I plan on making my way back here because I sincerely feel the service I received that evening was an isolated incident  everyone has bad nights  right  Fingers crossed . I look forward to a different experience with a lovely marg  that choriqueso and trying different dishes.
Gabriela's Downtown,449,I would say this is one of the better places to come for happy hour. First - the patio. It s very chill and laid back. You get a great view of the skyline as well which is nice. On Monday s they have  4 margaritas  so of course I had to get 2  In addition to that I also got two appetizers. The first one I got was the Salsa Sampler - 4 different types which were all good. The second one I got was the Mexican Street Corn which I definitely recommend - you can t go wrong with elote  Very good especially when paired with some drinks. All in all - I had a good time here and would come back.
Gabriela's Downtown,450,Best happy hour ever  My boyfriend and I come here every Friday  5 weeks and counting   and we always enjoy it  The margaritas are strong and it s the best choriqueso we ve had. Always a good spot to bring family and friends. Servers are great and attentive. It s a steal at  5 for HH tambien 
Gabriela's Downtown,451,Their plates are simply outstanding. I ordered the plate that has melted jack pepper  spicy chrozio and guacamole. It simply melted in my mouth. We also ordered champagne with orange  we didn t realized they serve pineapple only  We begged them to provide orange and they did  Whew  it comes very well with the meal.  Simply recommend you all to give this a try 
Gabriela's Downtown,452,Yup  Lloyd obviously takes pride in taking care of his customers  and that made a great brunch 100  fantastic
Gabriela's Downtown,453,A really unexpected spot right next to the highway off of the opposite side of the  dirty 6th  street scene. We found ourselves here because of my massive obsession since college spring break of having a cocktail in a fruit...idk why this has become a thing for me but it has  It s a cute little brick house with a patio turned bar and Tex mex food. The strawberry margarita comes in a hollowed out pineapple  goalachieved   the only odd thing is the view which overlooks the APD building and also Austin s bustling IH-35. They serve some mean drinks and some decent food  the portions are pretty massive   This is a cool spot to check out for the drinks and also to avoid traffic.
Gabriela's Downtown,454,We were sooooooooooo excited to eat here. It was a beautiful place and the portrait of Selena in the dining area was beautiful and a perfect complement to her music playing in the background.   Truth be told we were running a bit late and had concerns about the kitchen being closed. All concerns melted away when they said it was opened  we were seated  given menus and they took our drink orders. We were all smiling in anticipation of what promised to be a great meal amongst friends.   We were wrong to smile because what came to pass can easily qualify as one of the most disgusting displays of customer service.  I have traveled all over the world  eaten in all kinds of restaurants settings and never in my life have I been treated in such a impolite manner. The witch doctor who chased my friends and I through the mountains of Panama treated us with higher regard.   Many  many  many minutes after our drink order was taken we were told that the kitchen was in fact closed. With our hearts filled with disappointment we decided to leave as our drinks had yet to arrive. We thanked them for their time and walked onto the porch to wait for our Lyft driver.   Up until this point all was well  we understood that the clock had beat us that night. Where Gabriela s failed was here... A few minutes after we had stepped onto the porch to wait  with quiet disappointment for our driver  a staff member came outside to inform us our drinks were ready. We politely declined them and informed them that we were leaving because the kitchen was closed.   A second gentleman came out to again inform us that our drinks were ready. Again we politely declined and he then proceeded to harass and berate us. FULL STOP. How dare you rebuke us for declining the drinks when you have failed to uphold your end of the bargain      We were told the kitchen was opened  we were seated and given menus. We expected to eat at your RESTAURANT. After we again informed him of what the staff had told us he huffily walked back into the restaurant. At this point we became irritated. Who treats customers in such a despicable way  That should ve been the end of our ordeal  but alas it was not.   A young woman came out and again we were informed that our drinks were ready. We again politely declined them at which point she choose to escalate the situation with her choice of words. She called us  bitches   we of course all stopped and turned to look at her. She being more bark than bite immediately recoiled ran back inside as we asked her to clarify her words.  Bitches  that is what that establishment called us.   Here is what I have to say   1  Your choice in words says a lot about you and your poor sad understanding of how the world works.  2  As a woman you should ve been more respectful of us  the world is tough enough without you bringing down other woman  3  This situations was poorly handled and escalated by the staff of Gabriela s. I am not sure why you think its ok to berate  harass and curse your customers but I can assure you that it is not a mark of a good restaurant.  4  You are not worthy of the portrait of Selena or of her music. You should be ashamed.
Gabriela's Downtown,455,A group of us decided to try out Gabriela s before a co very at Frank Erwin Center last night. We all had a great experience. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We literally ordered every item on the HH menu. Each plate was really good. My favorite was the Ceviche Tostada was probably my favorite. The salsa sampler was really good - the orange was smoky and delicious. Both quesos were also amazing as were the street tacos. Honestly  I have zero complaints and will definitely revisit this place. As far as drinks  they were all tasty as well. We got the Paloma  Gabby s Margarita and the Cerveza Preparada.  The Chamoy peanuts were TDF. I highly recommend trying this place 
Gabriela's Downtown,456,Food is great. Drinks are not cheap but the flavor is soo cheap. Idk what kind of alcohol they use but is gross. I ordered mangonaada  my friend margarita  and my other friend the one with the whole pineapple. Well all of them  were horrible also all of them with tequila.   I recommend gringas de pastor  with water    they re amazing  
Gabriela's Downtown,457,Gabriela s is a fantastic and quaint new restaurant located in an old house. Finding it so highly rated on yelp I decided to give it a try. I was greeted by a very friendly staff and by the owner Gabby that was working behind the bar. The locals sitting at the bar were very friendly and easy to converse with. They have a great outdoor seating area behind the house. Gabriela s has a very comfortable  at-home feeling.  The house margarita and the  Gabby s Margarita  were made with fresh lime and very good. Small drink portions but tasty.  5 during the daily Happy Hour.  The Choriqueso was by far the best queso I ve ever eaten.   Gabriela s has become my new favorite restaurant in the USA  and certainly my go to place when on Austin layovers 
Gabriela's Downtown,458,We just arrived in Austin and saw this place had recently opened. We decided to take a walk and check it out.  Over by the highway and somewhat out of the  main stream  it s an unsettling feeling as to what this will be... We loved it  First off  immediately greeted with a big smile and friendliness by a waiter  visiting a new city  this is always a great beginning. They have a patio in the back w a great view of the Austin skyline. Ordered 2 of the Gabriela s margaritas and no regrets on that choice. Then came the requisite guacamole and their 3 homemade salsas which were fantastic  Eventually we got around to a couple more margs and the pork taco and the chicken w mole. Food was soooo good and Everyone was super friendly.  A perfect first place to introduce us to Austin  Texas   
Gabriela's Downtown,459,This is a really cool place overall. Great music and atmosphere but the service is awful. It was an hour wait which I get it s cinco de mayo but we waited an extra 20 minutes after we sat down to finally put an order in. I really wanted to like this place but the slow service was not acceptable. What makes me mad is that I made eye contact with multiple servers and NONE of them came over. We had to hunt them down inside. Getting a simple water order was impossible. Will avoid this place and not recommend it.
Gabriela's Downtown,460,Great Location with excellent views of downtown  Great venue to watch Mexico soccer games too   but that is about it. Food is subpar and small-portioned  and  2 Mimosas are very watered down. Go to Gabrielas for the experience  not the food drinks
Gabriela's Downtown,461,I ve always wanted a favorite spot  but it had to be authentic Mexican  not over priced Tex mex   have a great vibe  and great drinks  This place has it all. The food is so good and so filling. The prices are incredible  especially considering it s location. The waitstaff is down to earth and treated us like queens even though we were dressed in fresh outta bed couture. If you re lucky  you ll even get a warm welcome from Gaby herself. She s the cutest little lady and really makes you feel like your opinions are valued. Get   The   Beans   Anyway  I m only giving it 4 stars and not 5 because the outdoor seating needs some work  which I m sure theyre working on because I noticed some unopened boxes. Just wait til my sis gets her profit coins 
Gabriela's Downtown,462,Great happy hour. Amazing flavors and nice variety. Sweet little patio overlooking downtown.
Gabriela's Downtown,463,Can t wait to return   I met some friends for lunch and we sat on the cute patio and had a great view. We ordered the queso which was AMAZING and my friends had fabulous margaritas. I m pregnant so I ll have to come back to have one but the waitress was very sweet and offered to make me a virgin mocktail of some sort. It was magical- She came back with a big margarita glass full of some sort of alcohol free mango deliciousness and I loved it. I wish I had gotten our server s name because she was wonderful and so friendly.  Me and my friends both got the shrimp tacos and they were outstanding too. Lightly friend with that really good batter and served with some beans that were quite tasty. All in all a very cute place  great food and fantastic service. The decor and the wallpaper were great little touches 
Gabriela's Downtown,464,Food was okay. Not amazing. Over priced for sure. Ordered the salsa sampler and the avocado sauce came already browning. Not very good avocado sauce. Salsas aren t authentic table salsas but are good taco salsas. Wasn t a fan of the atmosphere. Margs are decent.
Gabriela's Downtown,465,The place is hit or miss depending on what day you come.  I will say its pretty pricey and you can find better options for this type of food.  The vibe is very cool and its location is top notch.  Its a great place to bring a date or a guest for the first time.
Gabriela's Downtown,466,They have a lot to improve on. We spent nearly 3 hours here today and within that time frame  we were constantly waiting around on our drinks and appetizers. It seem like the space and the amount of servers there does not even out to the amount of customers they have. It was PACKED today so you d think they d be more prepared to handle this.  We ll probably explore other brunch options first before coming here.  Disappointing..
Gabriela's Downtown,467,LOVE the micheladas. I got the one with ceviche and aguachil and love How much meat there was.  The corn is also bomb.
Gabriela's Downtown,468,Where do I begin  The view of the whole of downtown is amazing The staff is wonderful .The food is delicious and the margaritas are terrific.I love Gabby s margarita with tamarind is so delicious.I highly reccomend this place friday happy hours are awesome with great music.
Gabriela's Downtown,469,Gabriellas is a great place for happy hour    Lloyd is our favorite waiter here  he always makes sure we have the best time and if something isn t right he will fIx it. Love this place but mostly we love  Lloyd     
Gabriela's Downtown,470,We came here for brunch on new year s day. The staff admitted they were backed up and experiencing some delays  and we didn t have an issue with that at all. Our experience started to go downhill when we ordered two coffees and the server immediately replied   worst coffee in the world  but ok  . At the end of our meal  he told us that he was going to eat our leftovers in the kitchen. Pretty weird. The chilaquiles were edible  but the food was cold when we got it. He was right  the coffee was terrible  but we wouldn t have noticed it so much if he hadn t mentioned it. Much better brunch spots in Austin. Skip it.
Gabriela's Downtown,471,Love this place  Fantastic service  excellent food  and perfect cocktails. Stopped in on a whim and couldn t of been happier. Will be back again for happy hour
Gabriela's Downtown,472,Walked in and was given a table and water immediately as the restaurant was not so full and had many servers and bartenders working. 30 minutes later no one came to ask for drink or appetizers  had to leave to go have dinner somewhere else. For being our first time we where really disappointed with the service  It seems like they only take care of the existing tables that are drinking alcohol. parking is definitely over priced  
Gabriela's Downtown,473,We arrived around 10 30. We had the chilaquiles and migas with chorizo. Our coffee was super strong so bitter we couldn t drink it. Everything else was delicious.
Gabriela's Downtown,474,This is magic gem nestled in the heart of our city   great service  good food and unbelievable vibe  house music playing on the back patio while eating and enjoying my cucumber margarita ...it s almost more than we could handle. There isn t another way I would rather spend my Friday after a long week at work. This just because our new fav hangout  
Gabriela's Downtown,475,Food was delish  Choriqueso was delish  Drinks  Mezcal Mule  was a perfect blend  and the Camarones  amp  Al pastor tacos were great  The beans are whole pinto with slices of whole chorizo sausage but not greasy at all  Highly recommend for dinner  
Gabriela's Downtown,476,Checked out this little Gem during my stay in Austin  It had an awesome atmosphere with a beautiful view of Downtown Austin   Very laid back   Me and a friend shared the Choriqueso   It was the bomb diggity  Great flavors .... need to head back soon to try other menu options .... Gabriela was an amazing host and made us feel welcomed... will definitely be back again   Didn t get to take a photo of the food   we were hungry and it was delish  
Gabriela's Downtown,477,If you have yet to go to Gabriela s Downtown  don t wait any longer.  Seriously  it s amazing here.  I don t check-in or write reviews on Yelp often  but I have been meaning to write one specifically for Gabriela s because it is a great establishment.   This has become a regular date night location for us  as well as where we take friends and family when they come into town.    I have seen the dedication Gabriela and her bother have put into their business from the very beginning.  She use to even wait her own tables when they first opened   Now  they have expanded their patio space by adding heat lamps and a cover.  They really care about their business and everyone who steps in their doors.  Finally  we highly recommend the Shrimp Aguachiles....so damn good  we needed a beer to go with it 
Gabriela's Downtown,478,Found this place while visiting Austin and took my mom there for dinner. We had my 2 year old with us. I asked if there was a kids menu and the waiter said they had only been open a couple of months and were still developing the menu. He was very accommodating and offered to make us a little quesadilla and some fries which made my little one very happy. We ordered the chicken tacos and the trio of dips with a side of guac for ourselves and we were blown away with how delicious the tacos were. They could have come from any of the top rated street taco trucks around Austin. The tacos came with beans and rice and the beans were out of this world. The guac was creamy and full of flavour. Best food we ve had in Austin so far - I hope the restaurant does well so we can come back on our next trip 
Gabriela's Downtown,479,This was the best strawberry margarita I ve ever had  The tacos were delicious but a little spicy.  Service was awesome  We will come back for sure 
Gabriela's Downtown,480,had to pay for parking  drinks and food were overpriced  and our server was not friendly. went there with an open mind and we re immediately turned off when our server didn t care to show any interest. had one drink and left. paid for 2 hours of parking on top of it.
Gabriela's Downtown,481,Gabriela s is my new favorite Austin bar and restaurant. The staff is great and the building and patio have been refurbished and are cozy.  The live Latin themed music adds to ambiance.   Getting there at night can be a challenge but I ve just taken an Uber from my office.  When you go  be sure to order the Pina para La Ni a which is a frozen margarita served inside a pineapple. My other recommendation is their queso appetizer served with homemade corn tortillas which are the best corn tortillas I ve ever tasted. Gabriella s is a great place to go on a date  with friends or after work.
Gabriela's Downtown,482,First of all the service was horrible. The margarita was hot temperature wise. The micheladas was really good. One of the best here in Austin. The queso was very greasy and so were the totopos. The Tonga de pollo tacos were very good and authentic. Will be coming back  
Gabriela's Downtown,483,I was REALLY excited to try this place but once I did I wasn t too impressed. I wanted to love it but I didn t.   1. The parking located on the premises isn t theirs and you have to pay for parking or find a free one and walk a ways which let s be real  it s not as safe in this area during the night time. Usually restaurants come with free parking last I checked. 2. The place is small. We got seated outside which was cute but the inside looked boring.  3. I had a cute margarita which tasted good and had a cute flower on it. Did it taste any different than the margaritas at taco cabana or Trudy s  No.  4. I had the choriqueso and I def wasn t impressed. It was super rubbery as if the cheese was old or had been sitting out for awhile. Maybe I m spoiled since I m used to the best Mexican food and choriqueso from Laredo  TX but I was let down.  5. The place was too expensive compared to what they serve. My husband got a plate with 2 tacos and beans and it was way over priced. I feel like we could ve went to a taco stand on riverside and gotten way better authentic tacos and a lot more of them for a cheaper price. I think this place is just another hipster overly priced  Mexican  food place where you DONT get What you should be getting for the amount you pay.   I will say that their beans were really good. And I ve heard that there s a dj on Sunday s for brunch and that sounds fun  but didn t experience this. I went for dinner on a Saturday night. Cool thing is there wasn t a wait but would I come back   Probably not.
Gabriela's Downtown,484,Ok let me tell you this place is adorable. The little murals are worth the visit.  The drinks are delicious  a bit pricey  but they get the job done.  My food  aguachiles  was so flavorful and delicious  I am Mexican and it was not as spicy as I am accustomed to but that s probably best for other people. Every bite of the shrimp was flavorful.  Staff was busy yet made the meals personable.  I went back the next day because I enjoyed it so much.   My frijolada de pollo was ok  not fantastic but it was ok. The beans that s came with it were delicious tho.
Gabriela's Downtown,485,Very disappointed. Did not even feel like a Mexican restaurant with decor. Food quality was poor. Beans and rice came out Luke warm if that. Shrimp tacos would have been ok if tortilla was warmed a little  it was right out of a cold store bought package - toast them in the future. Best thing was my pineapple drink. Says pineapple margarita but it was a strawberry frozen margarita with fruit. Not what I was expecting by it was the best thing I had. They did have a neat trivia game going on.  Thank you for responding Gabriela but the food still was not on par and the beans were not hot nor was the rice  it was mushy  the food was just bland and I have had authentic Mexican cuisine in Dallas and Houston and you just need more flavor and to watch temps with food so it comes out hot. I knew we were dining at a Mexican not Tex-Mex the reviews are what led us to the location. I should have gone with Tex-Mex location closer to our hotel and not travel out of the way for the sub par experience.
Gabriela's Downtown,486,The best and most authentic Mexican food in all Austin      It s simply the best hands down and Request LLOYD to be your server. Makes your time even better. Happy Hour menu is bomb and Brunch on the weekend is a must     
Gabriela's Downtown,487,The hostess was rude. We waited for 2 hours which was the expected wait time. However  when I asked the hostess if it s be easier to separate our party of 7  she replied if we did that  she d put us at the end of the list. We asked if we could order drinks during our wait but she didn t allow us to do so although others were walking to the waiting area with cocktails.
Gabriela's Downtown,488,Amazing place  Wonderful service  the drinks are poured strong and the people are amazing. Did I say that the people are amazing  Definitely come here it s the best Mexican food in town
Gabriela's Downtown,489,We live in Hutto and go out of way to Gabrielas. Theres something about the quaint no frills  hip atmthay droves us here. Food has been consistently good all 4 visits. My fav are the asada tacos. Drinks are generously poured. Service is friendly and casual. Love weekend brunch...serving sizes are just right....mimosas  micheladas are nicely done. Be back soon 
Gabriela's Downtown,490,Just got into town from Houston and yelped restaurants in the area and decided to try this one out. The margaritas were amazing and so was the food. The owner and waitstaff was helpful and friendly. My friend lost a  100 under the patio and the owners went underneath to grab it and give it to her. I will visit this place every time I am in Austin 
Gabriela's Downtown,491,Small busy spot near downtown Austin.. Parking is 4  for 2 hours... we waited about 30 minutes to be seated. The bar wasn t too crowded so we had some drinks while we waited. The drinks were fantastic   Gabriela s inside seating and the back patio were packed full but it had a great vibe.. We were called and seated at a small corner table.. The menu only features breakfast brunch items. I had the chilaquiles  bomb  I also tried the Migas... they were LEGIT  I would definitely go back  
Gabriela's Downtown,492,Looking for a loud  trendy  and boozy brunch  Gabriela s on Saturday and Sunday is the ticket. They have delicious egg dishes that will cure any hangover  plus plenty-o  hair of the dog  options that will get ya feeling right as rain  The music is loud  the dishes are yum yum  the drinks are fuerte  and the crowd seems pretty fun. Depending on what you re looking for  this could be a great option.
Gabriela's Downtown,493,One of my favorite spots in Austin since it has views of the skyline and queso that I d die for. My favorite meal is the Steak Gringas. Drinks are super cute too. Very IG worthy  highly recommend.
Gabriela's Downtown,494,Nice quiet environment during lunch with nice and friendly staff. Has the best jalape o poppers and taquitos   Delicious frozen mangonada  Nenas Horchata is also good  just a little strong for me personally.
Gabriela's Downtown,495,This place is absolutely amazing. There was 3 top things that stood out to me. The unique mixed drinks  My drink came in a hollowed out pineapple  the food was very authentic  the chips and salsa are to die for. To top it all off the service was excellent   They made me feel at home. They took good care of me. I will definitely be back to this wonderful Austin experience.
Gabriela's Downtown,496,Great location. The food is pretty good although a little pricey. Good margaritas.   PARKING is NOT free. The waiting staff will not warn you at all about it. My friend had to pay a ridiculous  120 fine because he didn t catch the signs. There are plenty but not the same as the city of Austin so if you are distracted talking to someone you will miss them. Note to management  have your servers drop a friendly reminder about the parking situation when ordering
Gabriela's Downtown,497,In town for spring break with my daughter  so we decided to give it a try. My picky teenage daughter loved it so much she asked to go back the next day. I had to convince her to try other places this go around.   Great service and I even met Gabriela  Great location and great food.   I will visit again the next time I m in town.
Gabriela's Downtown,498,I stumbled upon this place as I was walking near my hotel and I m glad I did  I got the Al Pastor Gringas and they were delicious  Granted it was one meal but that meal was excellent. Service was fast and friendly. I ll be back next time I m in town 
Gabriela's Downtown,499,Cute little spot with good food and friendly service  I had the asada tacos and the salsa sampler. It was all delicious 
Gabriela's Downtown,500,I had been dying  literally  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FDY.ING amp s 08ab7714439d7eee659ff6005602410e0024c5b237b0b66cfa855af751f1da80  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  DY.ING  a   to try Gabriella s brunch. I d spent way too many minutes drooling over the brunch photos from their Insta stories and longingly wishing to be on their patio  enjoying the amazing downtown view while dancing to uLOVEi.  My day finally came last weekend when my gal pals agreed to oblige my wish. Even better was the fact that one of my friends agreed to share one sweet and one savory dish from the brunch menu because what is brunch without both    I thought the chilaquiles we re good and the tipsy french toast was  too  but I could have used way more cajeta...mmm  cajeta. The horchata  though  stole the show for me. It was right  I do need another return visit  though  because I didn t get to live out my Selena dreams on that patio. Next time...
Mi Tradición,1,I came here for their pan dulce  Mexican sweet bread . I tried a concha and a yoyo. Conchas are probably the most popular and recognizable traditional Mexican pan dulce  but for the uninitiated  I would describe them as soft and sweet bread with a white streusel topping that resembles the surface of a seashell. Growing up these were my favorite pan dulce  and the ones at Mi Tradici n taste just like the ones you can find in Mexican panader as. Much less famous  yoyos are made from two pieces of bread held together by a thin layer of buttercream and coated with butter and powdered sugar. They look like yo-yo s  hence the name  and they re also known as besos  which means kisses  because the two pieces of bread are kissing each other . This was my first time trying yoyos  so I don t have a point of comparison. I thought they were tasty  but my all-time favorite pan dulce remains the concha. I bought these at the end of the day  so both were a little hard  but I heated them up in the oven and that softened them up to perfection. Warming up pan dulce is a game changer.   I ve also tried a slice of their tres leches cake. They have three options  strawberry  mocha  or durazno  peach . I tried the tres leches that comes with strawberries. I thought it was good  but not mind-blowing.  Mi Tradici n has a wide selection of pan dulce and you can t beat their prices  I paid  2.50 for two pieces of pan dulce . The only downside is that none of the pan dulce is labeled  and the staff speaks mostly Spanish. Overall  it s a great panader a. I can t wait to try their tacos and tortas.
Mi Tradición,2,I ve heard a lot of good things about the Panader a which is the bakery attached to the restaurant and I finally got to try their restaurant attached aka Mi Tradici n  The food was well-priced and there were many options to choose from. I went with friends and we ordered the Al Pastor Tacos  Cubana Torta  and Submarino plate. The food was very flavorful and the meat was not dry at all  I also got their Horchacta which was more on the cinnamon-y side which was refreshing.  A tip for finding the restaurant is just to look for the big Panader a sign there s a little sign on the window that says Mi Tradici n but it s not as visible. Another tip when ordering food is that you can t see their full menu on their TVs but you can find it taped to the side of where the cashier is.   There s also a big parking lot with lots of spots available and they take card   cash 
Mi Tradición,3,No breakfast is complete without something cooked and something baked  I recommend starting with the breakfast tacos. The tortillas are fresh made and filled with the perfect blend of egg and chorizo. For something different  I also like to add the tlacoyo  a snack-y blue corn tortilla stuffed with beans and topped with cactus and cheese. For something sweet  take your pick from the bakery. The pan dulce always hits the spot.
Mi Tradición,4,This place is amazing. The smells alone are worth the trip.  Had the Cubana Torta and it was delicious. The large amount of meat in this sandwich for   7 is wild  I also bought a bag of torta bread to take home with me. The donut and pastry selection was mind blowing.
Mi Tradición,5,Pretty tasty... nothing was labeled here and not a whole lot of English was being spoken  and I don t speak a whole lot of Spanish  so... we just grabbed a few things and hoped for the best. Don t sleep on that hot dog wrapped in a bun though...  Overall  we were happy. Tasty pastries for all.
Mi Tradición,6,Perhaps the best panderia in town and a solid option for all things roasted and chopped meat of traditional Mexican fare including street food and tacos no extensive salsas or mole options here .  And man   1.75 for a breakfast taco is hard price to beat in this town. A must try 
Mi Tradición,7,I absolutely love the food and was sad today bc I woke up early to get there around 6 because that s what time it says they open just to be told they don t open until 7 pregnant and these craving I literally cried lol just hoping they update there times or at least actually start opening at the time they say
Mi Tradición,8,This place is perfect for the things they cook  either in the bakery or in the restaurant. In love with it  On the other hand  the place seems to need more maintenance. The service is good  the food is really good and the price is also good.
Mi Tradición,9,One of the most authentic Mexican food restaurants in Austin. I love the quesadillas with blue corn masa.
Mi Tradición,10,Hi there my name is Mayra. I m here to file a report for a cashier customer service representative at the front desk. His name is Andrew or Andreas or Andres. He never can clarify his name with me. I always had to find it some other way. I spoke to the manager Lorena and she told me to file this report online. This boy has been the rudest male Customer service representative cashier I have ever encountered. My family personally comes here so often and has been coming through this Panader a for so long  even at chuy Panader a. I m sick and tired of him being sarcastic  disrespectful  irritating  and excuse my language  a smart ass I feel discriminated because I am a woman. I m tired of coming through on my favorite place that has been going to for a long time and seeing his face showing how sad he is in miserable working in this environment how each time he gives me the cold shoulder and sarcasm when I speak to him for over a year  even through the phone  I could recognize who I m speaking to by the disrespectfulNess I am being shared upon. I go there so often and by 100  s each month. Just on bread or Agua Frescas and I get so irritated when I see him because I already know the energy he is putting off the moment he sees me his face droops down.
Mi Tradición,11,LEGIT AF  Both corn and flour tortillas are tender and fresh as hell.   Their bistec is some of the closest meat to carne asada I ve had in Austin.   Gringas are like mulitas from tacos el gordo.   Al pastor had more coloring than flavor  so I wouldn t order those again.   Horchata was way off. It tasted like they ran out of mixture and doubled the sugar to compensate.   Pasteria side smelled like fresh treats were still coming out of the oven even on a Friday night.   Prices are amazing. You can definitely fill your belly for well under  10.
Mi Tradición,12,I was craving for a sandwich and I found ou about this place in an article online. Mexican and they had tortas.. sold . The food was delicious. Real  every day food. I had a gringa and a torta chilanga. Tortillas are super fresh  made in house daily. The torta  fresh bread stuffed with milanesa  chorizo  cheese  lettuce and tomatoes. Now  this plaxe is also a bakery. All sorts of mexican breads and pastries baked daily. The smells are amazing and so are the pastries. Come by and give it a try.
Mi Tradición,13,Such amazing bakery with the freshest Mexican pastries in town. Grab a tray  load it up with fresh baked goods and enjoy  Love this place
Mi Tradición,14,Gringas was amazing and I m looking forward to going back to try more of their dishes. I also bought some fresh made flour tortillas which aren t pictured. This establishment also has a bakery side where they have everything from doughnuts and churros to loaves and tres leches. I met up with a friend here during a Thursday morning and they had a line going most of the time. I d say they re popular assuming most of those customers were regulars. I m definitely going back for more.
Mi Tradición,15,Fantastic authentic Mexican bakery with reasonable prices. Everything delicious  Highly recommend  Everyone in Austin - or visiting on their way to Dallas or San Antonio should stop by for a treat  They will enjoy the cookies  donuts  concha s  etc.  Great place to stop on your way to a concert  little league game - or any other event in the Austin area if you have a car  Also Great place for all the out of towners with a set of wheels  car  visiting from places as far as NY  CA  Australia or Europe to stop by and try. You will not be disappointed if you have a spirit of adventure and want to experience authentic Mexican culture through sugar   
Mi Tradición,16,Definitely a hidden little gem. They have all sorts of different pancitos the brought me back to my childhood. If you re also hungry you can just walk to the other side and order a bomb tortas and agua frescas. I ll be coming back for sure.
Mi Tradición,17,The food is authentic and yummy  When my mom visits she always makes me take her to get tlacoyos and tortas. I have no complaints about the food but the dining area needs some serious cleaning. It makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like as far as cleanliness because not only do they need to clean quicker after someone leaves for the next person  but the walls look dirty  the ceilings are dusty  it just doesn t smell great either. Also  whenever we eat they give us our order as it comes out so my food I guess is easier and comes out faster meanwhile everyone is watching me eat for a long time until their food comes out. Wired way to serve an order.
Mi Tradición,18,Hidden away in a strip mall  but a true gem. The mushroom huarache was cheap  fast  and delicious. All the pastries  from the marranitos to the chewy coconut cakes  were delectible. There was plenty of free tables and free parking even on Memorial Day.   What makes this place really special is that the servers were all so forgiving of my horrible Spanish. I felt really guilty that I couldn t understand all the signage  but the workers were all understanding. I appreciate how kind they were.
Mi Tradición,19,I give this place zero gu calas . It s all really good stuff . The staff is polite the food is really tasty and the bakery is exactly what you want if your Hispanic from a boarder town and miss home .  I love the prices as well Austin s ever changing economy hasn t affected the prices here yet   they charge very fairly for the food they give you ever so generously. It s not like getting expensive mediocre small hipster tacos and  4 dollar Mexican cokes    I mean you can get 9 tacos al pastor for like  12 that s including tax so yeah and they taste amazing . The tortas are huge and the menu is filled with tons of stuff I haven t even had that I m sure is fantastic.      I m from the border which is nothing to brag about but when I taste Mexican food I m beyond picky like if I m some kind of Mexican food Ambassador all of a sudden. I sometimes have to remind myself to be more open minded about different takes on cultural food and have definitely allowed that to happen on my culinary journey while living in Austin . I don t mean to be I just have had the good stuff and can never go back .      I came here expecting mediocre food and was pleasantly surprised with the dishes from the tortas to the Chicharron quesadillas they are all as close as what I can find back home . If it s your fist time try a Torta  Cubana or go for some good ol  Tacos al pastor and wash it down with some aguas frescas   Then when you are stuffed and can t possibly think of food walk over to the bakery and grab some fresh baked sweet breads   not the country kind   actual sweet bread .
Mi Tradición,20,My go to for sweet bread. It never disappoints  It s always clean and shelves filled with all my favorites. Staff is also very quick  so you are in and out.
Mi Tradición,21,I had flan and it was dry for me. It was missing the cajeta for me. Not what i expected. Bread was good and horchata was good.   Other than that it was okay overall
Mi Tradición,22,Panes y pasteles aut nticos. El pan dulce se queda suave  sus panes salados tambi n. Tienen una gran variedad.
Mi Tradición,23,Yummy  An awesome spot for ultra flavorful eats. I did an online order on their intuitive platform and a walk through purchase in the bakery. My Al pastor was spicy like it s traditionally made and packaged well in the take out bag. I loved the bright red of the meat against the blue corn base. The texture of the soft base and the meat complemented each other.   The bakery line moved smoothly and was set up the traditional way. So many items to select from  I got the piggy cinnamon cookie  almond crescent  chocolate concha  pound cake  and sugar cookie with sprinkles. It was a lot  but so worth it  as they are priced very affordably  The pastries were dry  probably because I picked them up in the late afternoon and their cases provide no refrigeration or ventilation. Dipping them in milk made for a nice afternoon treat   So excited to come back and eat more 
Mi Tradición,24,Orders al pastor tacos on a lazy Sunday. The tacos came out fast and we re relatively inexpensive. Will be coming back 
Mi Tradición,25,The tuxedo cake is delicious  It has cake  chocolate fudge  and cheesecake in layers. I have used this for 2 celebrations. Great experience at the south location. The manager supervisor was very attentive both times as well as the cashiers to make sure I was being served. The north not so great. I called in once to place a cake order for a chocoflan and was told I didn t have to cause they always had plenty. I went and there was none of the one I wanted. When I wanted to make a complaint and asked for the manager  yes I was pregnant and being a Karen  the girl said she was the manager with a smirk on her face and she was like 12 lol so obvi not. I went and cried in my car cause it was a cake for my sister. Then  I went back in to order some tacos so I could feel better. The tacos were good.
Mi Tradición,26,Excited to try this place since I haven t really seen that many Mexican bakery. If you have a sweet tooth you ll like this place. Everything here looks like they are too sweet for my taste and they use artificial coloring for some of the food.   I didn t really like the pastries I got here... my first time trying a Yoyo  and was not impressed. It was just dry bread with artificial jam  amp  coconut flakes. If you are used to eating Asian pastries  not too sweet  amp  fluffy  then you most likely won t enjoy the pastries here.
Mi Tradición,27,This place had AMAZING traditional Mexican food and delicious goodies from the bakery  Their rice and beans is to die for and their carnitas tacos and pollo tostadas were beyond me.   I came here to pickup food last week while visiting Leander  TX and I truly wish I was able to go back for a second round. Their tres leches cake was soooo delicious it melted in your mouth.   I can t wait to come back when I visit Austin 
Mi Tradición,28,Large tortas for a reasonable price. Note the grill doesn t open until 11  so no gringas until then.
Mi Tradición,29,Is there such a thing as an affordable taco in Austin  Does Big Foot exist  What is a true myth  Okay  you can find cheap tasty tacos here  real agua frescas  and practice your Spanish.
Mi Tradición,30,Fairly small restaurant with an attached bakery that s about the same size. Came here during lunch time on a Thursday and didn t find it to be too busy.   This place is a great bang for your buck and has a wide variety of options. I stuck with something more traditional  no pun intended   but there s plenty of creative menu items that would warrant return visits.   I went for the submarino to try a couple of different meat options and had a side of rice and beans. The portion size was pretty big and it all tasted good  but it was a little difficult to distinguish between each of the four meats  steak  pastor  spicy sausage  and ham  besides the ham which didn t have much flavor. I wouldn t call the sausage spicy  but it still had a nice peppery taste to it so I can t really complain.   Despite the large meal possibilities I do recommend leaving a little room for dessert  The bakery has a ton of cheap options  mostly of the sweet bread variety. Even if you don t have room leftover  I d definitely bring some home.
Mi Tradición,31,I hate to do this because this is genuinely one of my favorite places to bring friends and family  but I came here for dessert and I am SOOOOO DISAPPOINTED. I ordered the Chocolate Cup  filled with  chocolate mousse  and topped with fruit and it could not have been worse. Well  maybe it could have been but I m still so frustrated. This is one of my favorite places and I legitimately feel let down by the quality of this dessert.   The  chocolate mousse  tasted like cool whip with the essence of chocolate  the chocolate shell had no flavor at all  and the fruit was MOLDY.  I will absolutely still come back for actual meals  but I do not think I can come back for dessert here. How upsetting. I want to give this experience a 1 star review  but please know that I still give the food itself a 5 star.
Mi Tradición,32,this place needs to pay for a remodel of the roof and floor and hire someone to clean its always dirty.
Mi Tradición,33,First time trying al pastor tacos  love how they make it here  You get 3 nicely loaded tacos with salsa  amp  a wedge of lime for  7. The toppings go really well with al pastor meat and you get a lot of toppings  really enjoyed the pineapple. The tortillas are even too small to hold all the toppings so it s definitely worth the money 
Mi Tradición,34,Great little bakery that serves some of the best tacos in town.  Kind of a hidden gem for their ta os and hot plates from the kitchen for dining in.
Mi Tradición,35,A very limited choice of bread that doesn t satisfy the itch I have.  Unfortunately  Houston s el bolillo bakery is  well  in Houston and they don t have one in austin.
Mi Tradición,36,The food here is amazing  however the system that they have for the ordering and the customer service need improvement  I ordered a napolitana torta to eat in there and it was packed to go and to top it off with  it was given yo the wrong person  so when I heard my name I headed the the stand to pick it up and it was gone  I did not get an apology  instead I got a giggle and excuses  so they proceeded to remake my order I literally had to wait there 30 minutes for a torta to be made  not acceptable. They need to check everyone s ticket so this never happens again.
Mi Tradición,37,Very good Mexican bakery with amazing prices. It s easy to walk out with a few days worth of baked goods for less than  5 or a week s worth for less  10. Back when I lived in Austin  the bread here was one of the best deals in town.  There s also a pretty good attached Mexican restaurant  On the restaurant side  the right side   in addition to whatever your usual is  try the tortas and the blue corn tlacoyos.
Mi Tradición,38,Easily my favorite Mexican bakery in Austin. I m often shocked at how beautiful their stuff looks. The bakers show a bit of artistry that I d expect would come from a Whole Foods or something.   But these certainly aren t WF prices. Standard grab-a-tray-and-tongs self service. I have a hard time not buying too much  but then again you won t spend a lot. A tray full of treats always seems to only run me 4-5 bucks.   Don t ignore the bolillos. These little sandwich rolls are crispy on the outside yet nice and chewy on the inside  putting the best French bread to shame. Now the marranitos are more cake than cookie  and I grew up with the more gingerbread cookie version at a little hole in the wall in San Antonio. But that s more a regional than an authenticity thing.   Speaking of bolillos  try the tortas  plates  and tostadas at the counter service there. It s definitely above average. But the star of the show here is the bakery. It s perfection   4.8 stars.
Mi Tradición,39,Muy autentico...but I guess above my ability to appreciate. My Suizo was ham-packed with various meats  oh  and a few pepper slices and onions. And while the taste was fine  I found myself craving a more balanced assortment--and I don t just mean more dead once-mooing  snorting kinds of things.  Sign me   David  I see dead things  M
Mi Tradición,40,The bread for the tortas is amazing.
Mi Tradición,41,A real and authentic Mexican restaurant  one of the very few that I know of on this side of the border.   Not just the food is great  the service is friendly and fast  the restaurant is very clean and the prices are fenomenal.  Make your self a favor and check it out.
Mi Tradición,42,Highly recommend the breakfast tacos and the entire bakery section. I havent had a chance to get lunch yet but it looks amazing 
Mi Tradición,43,This place is hopping. I came because my friend said best empanadas in Austin. I agree  but not best in Texas. They were just ok. Employees are all super sweet  friendly  very helpful.
Mi Tradición,44,First review of the new year   Oh yeah   Ok  so this place is great. Unassuming on the outside  but unreserved on the inside    First  choose a door to go in through. The door on the left leads to the bakery  the door on the right leads you to the restaurant  but no worries if you choose the wrong one  there s a walkway inside that connects the two. We ordered the chicken and potato huarache  the steak alameda  and beans and rice. Everything was bold in flavor and delicious  The red and green salsas were also tasty and super hot  I was a tad disappointed in the portion sizes  but I m also a tad greedy  so I figured I wouldn t deduct a star just because I m a glutton.   Check this place out  I m excited to try the baked goods next door some day 
Mi Tradición,45,Growing up in Mexico and in the Texan border  I can guarantee that this bakery is one of the few in Austin that has authentic  pan dulce  with a wide selection to choose from. The establishment is parted in that half of it has a bakery for take out orders  and the other half has seats to enjoy your meal. In addition to the baked goods  Mi Tradicion sells Mexican culinary delicacies in the style of  street food  which even my  very traditionally Mexican  elderly Aunt approved of.  I recommend the following    Bakery  Empanadas de Cajeta  Churros  and Volovanes.      Restaurant  All of the quesadillas  Tlacoyos - the breakfast tacos and tortas are to die for 
Mi Tradición,46,Came here with a group of coworkers and it was awesome  The serve lunch as well as have a huge assortment of fresh baked goods. There are three different types of churros  The price is fantastic as well for the amount of food you can get. I got cheesecake  a churro and a cookie. I would say the churro and cheesecake are my favorite. I wasn t a fan of the cookie because it was quite hard.   The hot foods they serve are good as well. I would say maybe I didn t get the right thing and would have enjoyed something else. I got a quesadilla and it was more runny and soggy than the slightly stiffer crispy quesadillas I m used to. I did enjoy my taco though  it was a mini little taco but it was good. I would come back and try a different entree.
Mi Tradición,47,Chilanga torta is awesome. Portions are large and we probably could have split it.   Mexican hamburger is also very good.   The place also has an awesome attached bakery. Lots of good sweet breads.
Mi Tradición,48,This place is legit.. From the bakery to the rest of the food. The freshness  amp  the quality of the ingredients is truly reflected in the food  amp  the cleanliness of the work area in the back  its commendable. I like places that have a glass window through which you can see where your food is made  amp  what goes in there.   The bakery has a ton of selections  amp  most of the things i ve tried are top notch  the flan is highly recommended. My favorite is the Tres Leches.  For the food  we had the Tortas  melt in your mouth   amp  Tostadas best i ve ever had .  I will come back for the blue corn tacos..  amp  lots more to try on their menu.  Highly Highly Highly recommended for the Tostadas.
Mi Tradición,49,So I went to Mi Tradici n for the first time a few days ago. My taco obsessed friend took me to get me some birthday tacos. Who wants birthday cake when you can get birthday tacos  I mean really     It was so good  we went back again today to get more food. 2x in a week and you know you are hooked. This is a hole in the wall sort of joint. It s not fancy but it s darn good for sure. After these first 2 visits  I m already planning my next 1786715358 trips to get more food   Here s the highlights   -The entire menu looks delicious. On my first visits  I tried the Bistek and Pastor tacos  Cubano torta  as well as a kid s plain quesadilla  a chicken quesadilla  and fries. There were about 15 other things that looked and sounded great and I will try on future visits.   -The food was authentic and so flavor packed. Everything was delicious but the Pastor tacos were the hands down winner of the day. They serve them a bit different here since they add pineapple to the top.  It sounds weird  but it works so well.  It s one of the best tacos I ve ever had. So many layers of flavors that develop and bloom in your mouth as you eat these tacos.  We actually ordered 2 more servings of these tacos because 3 were not enough for us    -Not in the mood for tacos  get the Cubano Torta then. It was so delicious. The meat was cooked perfectly  the bread was soft and flakey  and the sauce was dynamite. It s also huge. We ordered one and split it between 3 of us since we also ordered a ton of tacos. It was easily 6 inches long and 3-4 inches across.   -The little tubs of hot sauce are amazing.  Both are delicious but the red one created a party in my mouth. It was so good and I put it on everything I had on my visit and might have stolen all of my friend s red sauce as well when he wasn t looking.   -They have picture menus and actual plates on display around. Not everyone knows what every dish is called  but when you see a picture or an example on display  it makes ordering what you want a lot easier. I think it also prompts you to try new things that just look awesome. Yay for going outside your food bubble and trying new things   -There s a kid s menu for when Mommy wants legit tacos but the kid will only eat chicken tenders. Mommies and Daddies  do you feel me on this one  Well my picky eater  as well as 2 even pickier eaters were along on this taco adventure. All 3 loved their food and were happy with it.  The kid s menu here has plain cheese quesadillas  burgers  and chicken tenders. All come with fries that are really  really  like REALLY good.   -There s also a bakery on one side. I didn t get to try anything yet  but everything looked great. I saw lots of pan dulce  tres leches  and lots of other beautiful looking goodies. Ip  This is a legit Mexican food place. If you like real Mexican  get over here now 
Mi Tradición,50,If you want fresh  authentic pastries that take you back to Mexico  this is it  Delicious pan dulce  cakes  galletas made from scratch. It s easy to figure out how things flow once inside  but don t expect to hear English. It s a beautiful cultural experience inside this gem. All you need upon leaving is a cup of coffee to dunk the delicious goodness from this bakery.
Mi Tradición,51,Delicious bean and cheese tacos  the whole place smelled amazing. Super soft tortillas  lots of flavor.
Mi Tradición,52,I heard that this place sold very good tortas cubanas and they were not mistaken  i even ate the vegetables that were in the torta which is not something that i usually do. I would recommend this place if you re craving a torta.
Mi Tradición,53,So many yummy pastries to pick from the bakery side and then fabulous food on the restaurant side.   Loved that you could see them cooking your lunch and watch them prepare the bakery side.   Daughter had brisket tacos which she said were delicious  I had the pork and they had fresh pineapple in the tacos which were divine    Excited to go back 
Mi Tradición,54,You guys have to see the inside of this place  I love the open kitchen to see the bakers doing their thing. There s a huge display of cakes including flan and tres leches followed by an even larger display case of traditional pan dulces Mexican bakery. The continuous flow of people coming in the door made me know it was a popular spot. The only reason I m giving it four instead of five stars is I ve had better tres leches but theirs is still good 
Mi Tradición,55,Amazing bakery with so many selections. Absolutely the best Churros in Austin - come early when they are fresh   A counter that serves many types of food including but not limited to - tortas  quesadillas  tostadas   and tacos.  Tons of stuff to purchase and enjoy - if you have not stopped by before - you should do it now 
Mi Tradición,56,Giving it 1 start because the staff are rude and have no morals however their food is amazing just wish the staff were friendly
Mi Tradición,57,I went on a Saturday around 1pm. Ordered the milanesa torta  a coffee  and a topo chico.  The torta was huge. I ate half there and saved half for later. The steak was cooked perfectly and crispy on the outside. The torta had beans  lettuce  onion  jalape o  tomato  avocado and spicy mayonnaise.   I requested the verde sauce. I recommend getting the verde sauce with everything it was awesome  The jalape os seemed like they might have been pickled and they were halves not slices. I will request extra jalape os next time 
Mi Tradición,58,I came here finally after seeing an in depth showcase on television and getting a recommendation from a co worker. Service got much better when I started speaking Spanish. This was my first time and I wandered around allocating my choices in my head without getting greeted or acknowledged. I figured let me try speaking in Spanish and see if I can get some love...worked much better.   I ordered tacos al pastor with cheese. These were very flavorful and authentically made not that I m an authentic Mexican  but I m cultured enough and been a few places to know the real when I taste it. If you re of the Taco Bell persuasion this spot won t be for you. This passed my get my feet wet test and I ll return to try other items on the menu.   The bakery had many delights and I love pastries. I picked up a little of this and little of that. Sorry my eagerness disabled me to remember names for my review. However I sampled a good selection and they were all fresh and flavorful. This is a far cry from picking up a cheese danish at Starbucks. The bakery is in open view so you can see the workers baking.   Overall this is a great spot for treats like tacos  tortas  baked goods like pan dulces  pastries  donuts  flan  cheesecake  etc. The prices were affordable and I m already spreading the word. It s a shame I procrastinated on visiting this long 
Mi Tradición,59,This is place is heavens for a fat white boy like myself. Everything I ve had here is bad to the bone. It s not Tex max so If that s what you re after look else where.
Mi Tradición,60,Because everyone needs to have a local Mexican bakery that also doubles as a restaurant   Come here for super fresh pastries in the morning or empanadas to snack on throughout the day. I d say the pastries and buns tend to be on the drier side of a pastry  but they are all extra large. Palmiers cover two palms. Buns look like they fit other buns inside. Horchata comes by the LITER      And it s good  creamy  not-too-sweet horchata too   So you should definitely stop by.
Mi Tradición,61,I saw this place on Yelp and was craving some Mexican sweets. Well I must say I was not disappointed. You grab your tray and tongs  and place whatever pastries you like on your tray. The cashier puts it in a bag  pay and enjoy. I always get the same thing  some type of apple pastry. I bought several others to try but didn t get to taste then as I was too full and totally forgot them in my car when I got home. I love the fact that this place is not stingy with their filling. Nothing like getting anything fruit filled without the fruit.   On the other side is a place where you can order breakfast. More like lunch dinner food but to each their own. They have all the juices and horchata you can think of. If you don t know which one you want  you can sample. Also you can see people cooking in the back and some action of what s going on. The ladies here were so nice. Barely speak English but they can understand and get the gist of what you re trying to say. I will be here again sometime. Glad I tried it   
Mi Tradición,62,This place has been one of my favorite taco spots but over the years the cleanliness has gotten out of hand. Not sure if they re under new management or what s going on. Yesterday topped it off for me. Me and my girlfriend were dining in and awaiting our food. We couldn t find a clean table so we took it upon ourselves to clean one up. It was then that we witnessed a huge rat run across the dining area. Some of the customers ended up cornering it and killed it under a table it snuck under. We witnessed the staff bag it but they didn t bother to sanitize the area. There was still blood on the floor and they put the table back. Needless to say  we lost our appetite and asked for a refund. The manager informed us that they could not grant us a refund since the food was already prepared and there was no way to prove that they have a rodent issue. I will not be returning. I m not much on reviews but felt it was my civil duty to inform the public. Beware.
Mi Tradición,63,Might be the best tortas in town  Everythings so fresh. From the telera bread to the in house made pickled jalape os    12 for a torta and an agua fresca  Just try to come before 11am or after 1 30pm lunch time hours wIll have you waiting atleast 30 min for your food.
Mi Tradición,64,Our first time here and it was awesome  It s a bakery on one side and a counter service restaurant on the other. We are total newbies and speak no Spanish and we were welcomed and the cashier was helpful and courteous.  The food was delicious and very fresh. I had the quesadilla tinga  fresh tortilla and shredded chicken  and my spouse had chorizo torta  sandwich on freshly baked bread  lettuce and chipotle mayo . Horchata was sweet and a perfect counterpart to the spicy tinga. Kiddo had quesadilla and fries. We stepped over to the bakery  because there s no person on the planet who could have resisted that perfume of sugar and baked amazing... and guess what. Every single thing we got was buttery and so yummy. Our churros were even warm.  So so delicious   
Mi Tradición,65,I wish I could put in words the amazing smells that hit your nose the second you walk in. Pan dulce selection is top notch. Soooo many options  Love the staff too. It s like I m interacting with my Abuelas Tias. From the bakery I purchased  on 3 12 19  a churro  chocolate cake triangle piece  bolillos and a croissant. All great tasting. Toasted a bolillo this AM for breakfast and it was still hella fresh tasting. From the kitchen I ordered the tostadas al pastor and agua fresca de jamaica  hibiscus . If you re looking for handmade tortillas  authentic and flavorful food  you NEED to come here. 10 10 would recommend. Bring ya momma  bring ya daddy  bring ya wifey hubby and ya kids.  Bring the whole family.
Mi Tradición,66,I love their bollilos  they are so soft when they are freshly out the oven. My family and I do not get our bollilos from any other place. Their cakes are also so yummy  we like to get their capuchino tres leche cake for birthday as it is the perfect consistency. Overall very good bread  I d you are looking for tradition Mexican bread this is the place 
Mi Tradición,67,We went here on a Saturday afternoon and it was crowded. All the menus are located by the register. The ladies working there were friendly and accommodating. I had their steak tacos which were small but surprisingly filling. I recommend adding guacamole and lettuce to it. They have a bakery as well which has pretty cheap pricing. I had a concha and vanilla churro. The vanilla churro was delicious and the concha was alright  it would have tasted better if it was freshly made. There is a decent amount of seating but it s best to eat there if you have smaller groups of 3-4 people.
Mi Tradición,68,Amazing authentic Mexican bakery  My husband and I went to town picking out a variety of baked treats. You get a tray and tongs and then head over to the cashier s counter. Everything was wonderful. We can t wait to try the restaurant counter that seems to have great options  such as breakfast tacos  platters  and tortas. Everyone is very friendly and prices are extremely reasonable.
Mi Tradición,69,Love this place  I ve had everything from the Tortas to the Tacos At Pastor. The food from the restaurant is really good. The biggest problem is to not try and get any of the pastries when you are there. The filled churros are so good. And all the food is well priced. Definitely recommend checking them out for some authentic Mexican food.
Mi Tradición,70,This place is the definition of authentic. From the food to the decor - this place is legit. Walking into the establishment you get greeted with the wonderful smell of baked breads. After all this place is half a bakery  so it was tempting to just skip dinner and buy a bunch of conchas  churros  and more. Anyways  let s talk about the food I ordered. I got huaraches which I describe as a tostada with a soft tortilla. Anyways  these were so delicious  I still think about them days later. I got two and they were pretty filing. I got the al pastor and steak ones and the meats were cooked amazingly - full of rich flavor. I was too full and didn t get to buy any of their baked goods  but I will DEFINITELY be back soon to try something else and some dessert. I highly recommend coming here   You won t be disappointed - I guarantee it 
Mi Tradición,71,Best bakery in the Austin area     Have tried Fiesta  Michoacana and others  but NOTHING compares to the selection  quality and freshness of this place.  A must for Mexican pastry lovers  
Mi Tradición,72,Bottomline up front   this place is awesome   I started with two breakfast tacos. The tortillas were thick and fluffy. And didn t fall apart when stuffed. Had chorizo  egg  potato in one...bacon  egg  potato in the other. The only thing I didn t like was the bacon wasn t crispy  my preference  but both tasted delicious   The bread selection is great   See pics . I grabbed some of everything to take to the office. They also serve plates of food and several sandwiches.  Give this place a try. You won t be disappointed 
Mi Tradición,73,So so so happy we went to this place    Very simple establishment.  We had tortas and pastor tacos. The tortas were great...the bread was heavenly thin and crispy outside and soft and chewy inside.  The star though was the pastor tacos      I could eat them all day everyday   If you go do yourself a favor and get them     Wow     The only thing I didn t really love was the horchata. It tasted a little powdery.
Mi Tradición,74,I ve seen the word  legit  used many times about this place  and it s all true   Great smells as soon as you walk in. A wide variety of baked goods  tortillas made on-site and Aguas frescas in varying flavors.  Inexpensive but very good menu from tacos to tortas. You can watch the kitchen work while you munch on some truly authentic food with real flavor.  Not sure what you want  Just point to the sample plates that are displayed near the ordering area. After you re done shop the cases upon cases of donuts  pastries  tortillas  kolaches and more   Great salsas and sauces. The red was only barely beaten by the green. Nice chunks of meat and vegetables and peppers all wrapped in completely beautiful flour tortillas made in-house.   I m sorry but you can t really ask for more than this. They do get busy on the weekends and I m sure at lunch as well.  The bakery has silver baking trays and tongs so you can just browse the cases and fill your tray before you head out. Be prepared to fall asleep afterward   .
Mi Tradición,75,Just wanted to give an update though most everything I said before stands.  I came in here for a late lunch and it was super busy for a Sunday. I had my tlacoyos again and they were great. The nopales are my favorite. They re cooked well and pickled. No slimeyness that you can sometimes get with cactus.   I also tried some more bakery items. I had a fresco empanada--think strawberry filled pierogi is that helps. A fresh batch had just come out from the back. It was delicious.  I also tried the flan. I don t know why I always do this  but I always think I will like flan--and never do. I m sure flan lovers will like it here. For me  I m still not convinced. Anyway  I should have known better.   Great place. Try to come here every time I m in North Austin.
Mi Tradición,76,Oh man  how did I forget about this place   Not sure what happened or how I remembered this place but I came back and fell in love all over again. Those big beautiful tortas...   My go to order is the diabla torta  thinly breaded steak  chorizo  egg  cheese  avocado  chipotle mayo  and beans  and maybe some tacos and a kolache. The freshly baked bread is heavenly and all the delicious meats are savory and yummy.  I ll need to come back for the flan and agua frescas.
Mi Tradición,77,Another Austin favorite I miss terribly.  Warm tortas on toasty bread and agua frescas. I love their food  Inexpensive  still cute  and a great place to bring out of town guests.  Their bakery was ok. Not bad  but their pastries are too sweet for my taste. I love my sugar  but theirs is too much. Trying to choose a few from the cases and cases of pastries is terrible  and you ll have to just make multiple weekend trips to try everything.
Mi Tradición,78,Torta diabla  steak  egg  cheese  jalape o  avocado and chorizo  was AMAZING  I recommended trying it. The steak is so thin and the entire torta just tasted so delicious. It had some spiciness to it which was exactly what I wanted. Try it and you won t regret it.   They also have a bakery if you want some dessert after.
Mi Tradición,79,Their salsas are pretty hot and quite good. The red salsa goes best with beef tacos.   I have tried their Jamaica and Horchata and both are the best I ve had in Austin so far.  The torta chilanga was filling and full of flavor. If you get that  make sure they don t forget to put avocado in it  it s supposed to come with it at no additional charge  because the first time I ordered it there was none  -  Since it was a to go order  I didn t find out until it was too late.
Mi Tradición,80,Wow - utterly blown away any previous understanding of mexican food. This place has redefined my perception of authentic in general. Say goodbye to tex-mex.  It s a split store - bakery on one side  restaurant on the other. Restaurant isn t that big so its kind of hard to sit a large group and the people seem to mostly speak spanish  but do also speak english  so thats a plus. Worst case you can always look lost and just point at what you want.  The pastor torta is interesting  as is their pastor in general. The pork reminds me more of chinese char siu than any other pastor I ve ever had. Not bad but different.   Highly recommend any of the special platters. I got the taco loko and its amazing - beef  bacon  poblanos  mushrooms all sauteed with a blanket of cheese. Some amazingly pliable  chewy flour tortillas on the side and you re in for a gastronomic treat. Normally I don t care for much of my food senses beyond taste but everything about that dish just hit it on the nose  amazing texture on the tortillas  well presented steaming blanket of cheese covered meat. Tastes fantastic  smells fantastic  even through the allergies  . Even the loud frenetic background adds to the dining experience.  Other goodies  tres leches - very good  only tastes more like tres leches near the bottom - just tastes like fantastic cake otherwise. The quesadilla comes in blue corn and tastes more like a taco than a quesadilla  most meat to cheese ratio ever . The corn tortillas have the texture of flour tortillas - that s pretty amazing and have rich nutty corn flavor too.  So yes - get a special plate  some tortillas and a dessert and you re good to go  Will definitely be back.
Mi Tradición,81,Very busy even mid day when we visited  Even so  it was well organized  plenty of clean trays and tongs. There s 2 lines - one for bagging and the other for paying. Everything we tried was very good - cajeta churro  empanada de crema  chocolate croissant and yoyo. They have loads of cakes to chose from as well as the expected assortment of Mexican sweet bread. There s a whole other side for more substantial fare - such as tacos  sandwiches and eggs. There s also a decent assortment of aguas and even horchata. The service is friendly but efficient. Highly recommend
Mi Tradición,82,Definitely a great bakery. Got a huge assortment of bread. The food....probably won t eat again. I got the al pastor tacos. Kind of dry. And overfilled. Everything fell out when I picked it up. Had to reconstruct the taco a million times.
Mi Tradición,83,I wish I lived in Austin just for Mi Tradicion   My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat nearby while we were visiting Austin yesterday  and Mi tradicion came up as a top rated restaurant bakery. The lot it is located in has plenty of parking  so no worries there. When we first pulled up  we were a little worried because from the outside it looks like it s just a bakery  however  there is a chunk of it to its right that is the restaurant. Both sides of Mi Tradicion are fairly equal  in regards to size. When we entered  we noticed both digital menus and paper menus  if you re want to really look over everything  grab the paper menus because the digital menus change every minute or so. For our food  we decided to get 3 pastor tacos  a huarache with bistec  and a tlacoyo. We also ordered a large horchata  which they make from scratch  super yummy   All of the food was so good. The huarache and tlacoyo both had blue corn tortilla  which was delicious. The pastor tacos were also good  the meat wasn t fatty at all  however  I would ve liked the tortillas to have been cooked more. I love that Mi Tradicion is also a bakery  cause once you re done you can walk over and get some dessert     There are a lot of desserts breads to choose from. I purchased several  since I was taking some to have for the next couple of days. I picked out some conchas  a borracho  2 churros  a donut  and some other breads I can t remember the names of. I bought about 10 things for around  9. So far  what I ve had is super delicious. I look forward to visiting Austin again and coming back.
Mi Tradición,84,If you re feeling adventurous and don t know if you d like cactus don t order quesadillas nopales lol. I ll sure it s a great cactus quesadilla but I found out I don t like cactus.   Steak tacos were dry and pricer and the pastor tacos. Pastor tacos were great but the salsas seem to be lacking flavor and some kick.   The place is also a panadrra  bakery  so don t get confused.
Mi Tradición,85,Bad costumer service  they take for ever to help you out    You walk inside and it s like they don t even notice your there.
Mi Tradición,86,We went here to try their tres leches cake because I missed it so dearly  I grew up in a mostly Hispanic neighborhood and that was always my favorite cake  but decided to go all out and get dinner first.  I got the alameda     which I had no idea what it was from the pictures but it basically was very overstuffed tacos--with so much meat that I had to take some of it to go. I took a star off because I requested for it to be made with no ham  a little bit of bacon is okay  but I have to have only small quantities of pork because I m allergic to it in large quantities   and it came out with ham. It looked good and I felt bad taking it back and asking for another one  so I just risked it. I don t get deadly allergic reactions--just get itchy--so I just had to make sure I had benadryl with me just in case. Luckily  I didn t have a reaction  but I think the place should be more attentive to requests regarding leaving something off because people usually make such requests for a reason. Yeah  some people are picky  but others have weird bodies that react negatively to things from time to time--like mine. It was delicious though  and I would come back again.   My boyfriend got a diabla sandwich and a quesadilla  I took a tiny bite of each and the first was yummy while the latter  not so much--very dry and strange pork in it  maybe just a cultural preference though . He enjoyed both immensely.   We then ordered dessert to go. I got a churro and we each ordered a slice of cake. The churros tasted fried and sugary  but I didn t taste much if any cinnamon on them. Maybe that s actually the authentic way to make them--what do I know --but I m used to cinnamony churros and was hoping for one of those. I didn t really like it and didn t finish mine  but it was only  1  so I didn t care. My strawberry tres leches cake was HUGE--I mean for less than  5  I got the equivalent of maybe 3 slices  It s 3 days later and I m still finishing it off. Wow  haha.  But my favorite part of the experience was the fact that they eagerly permitted us to practice our limited Spanish  we just started trying to learn the language  and explained what they meant if we didn t understand what they were saying  even with a line behind us.  One last opinion  The girl setting out the places of food and calling out names could be a little less grouchy  but maybe she was just having a bad day.  Otherwise  if we lived around here  we would come back again  absolutely.
Mi Tradición,87,MMM quick  amp  cheap tacos on the go. They don t have a whole lot of options or extra sauces but it s quite filling. They pack a big pile of meat in ur tacos  yum  After you finish yo tacos  you can make your way over to their bakery which is in the same space. I was too full off my tacos to order any dessert but my oh myyyy everything looks and smells delicioso 
Mi Tradición,88,First time customer...got bakery items...coconut balls and the churros were amazing and then two days later went back and got the cheese danish and chocolate croissants...outstanding   Decided to try their Mexican food and had the harache and gringa. The steak is well seasoned and tender. The tortilla was one of the best I ve had in a long while. The chicken taquitos were moist on the inside and crunchy on the out. I must say that their horchata was the best I ve had.
Mi Tradición,89,Found this gem by accident. Not your usual tex-mex - much better. Had steak and chicken quesadillas. Blue Corn tortillas stuffed with meat  cheese  onions and a spicy green chili sauce. A large variety of bakery items and desserts that really looked good. Very busy at lunch. Next time we ll have the tacos 
Mi Tradición,90,This place was good. Really large size tortas that were tender and bread was the perfect texture. One of the best tortas I ve had in Austin. I give four stars because the place was dirty. Every single table was dirty...
Mi Tradición,91,This place has some authentic mexican food for sure. the tortas as my favorite as well as the aguas frescas. After i am done eating i always go next door to their panaderia and grab a couple of pieces to take home and enjoy with coffee or a glass of milk. Simply delicious 
Mi Tradición,92,So one day after work I wanted something sweet. I just moved here from Chicago where there were Mexican Panderia s on every corner. When I walked in I was blown away. The selection was insane. There had to be iver 8 display cases fillllledddd with everything you could have ever imagined and more. There was a huge variety so if you need stuff for a party this is the place to go. I like how you grab a pair of tongs and a tray and gather all your goodies. In Chicago you put everything in bags or huge bulky boxes. I really liked that the counter women nicely packaged your goodies for you. I will definitely be back. Also  I heard their Tacos are amazing so I cant wait to try those as well.
Mi Tradición,93,Popped in today from breakfast and what a great choice it was. The inside has two sides - one for bakery and one for a restaurant. We got our goodies from the bakery but will be back to try the tacos on the other side.   The bakery is awesome. One of the largest selections I ve ever seen. There are three walls lined with open and glass closed cabinets holding savory to sweet. In the middle you grab a tray and tongs and get hunting. I loved being able to look around and pick out own own items. They also have a menu of items behind the check out counter that I believe are made to order. Fresh tortillas were also being made in one corner.   We get an awesome selection for only  8. Two very large sausage Kolaches   1.50   spicy chicken empanadas   1.75  and three huge rolls   .40 each . Check out the photos to see our goods. Once you grab your picks  head to the counter to get your goodies packaged and to pay. They do take credit card. All were delicious. Kolaches were more of a biscuit like dough which we liked. Chicken was spicy and tasty.   Staff was friendly  place was clean and again huge selection of goods.   We will definitely be back. Highly recommend stopping by here.   Oh and it s on the far left  around the corner in the strip center of you have the highest to your back.
Mi Tradición,94,This restaurant has delicious food. I would consider Mi tradici n my favorite Mexican restaurant  having lived in South Texas .  Food is delicious  well served  and a meal is approximately  7.
Mi Tradición,95,This place is legit. When you walk in you ll find the bakery section to the left where you can get an array of quality baked goods  including their empanadas which I highly recommend . To the right you ll find their dining area where you can get an array of traditional   huraches  tlacoyos  sope...  and not so traditional  their  sausage  looks like hot dog to me  Mexican hot and tasty bites.  The bakery side reminded me of some bakeries I ve been to in Mexico and Costa Rica where you grab a tray and tongs then scoop up what ever you like and bring it to the counter to pay. In the world of empanadas the filing is crucial  but equally as crucial as the filling is what that filling is housed in. I ve found 2 distinctive styles for the outter crust of an empanada. For me  my hands down favorites are the ones that are pastry like where the crust is croissant esque. The others are too dense and doughy for my liking. Here they have the good stuff. Soft  buttery pastry dough with a nice cirspness on the outer edge. I got their picadillo empanada and it was real good. I thought I d snack on half of it while awaiting my tacos. I devoured the whole thing in a minute. It had just the right amount of kick too. They had a number of other ones I ll definitely be back to try.  I also got 3 tacos of their tacos  bistec  al pastor  and chicharon. Each had good flavor  but I d probably put them in order of my favorite being the chicharon  then the pastor  then the bistec. I would get all 3 again. I was a bit surprised by the chicharon as the countless times I ve had chicharon before it s always been crispy. For this taco  it wasn t crispy at all. The pieces of pork skin were super soft and tender. It wasn t the texture I was expecting and it threw me off at first  but it wan t bad. It may not be for everyone  but the sauce marinade it was cooked in is along with the good flavor from the skin is what made it really really good. Oh and the price for all 3 tacos was  5.41. I will caution that to be full you may need 4 or more as their pretty small  but between the 3 tacos and the empanada I was a happy boy.  Service was quick  staff was nice and I enjoyed watching them cook while I was eating. Everything seems to be cooked fresh to order. They have a plethora of other items to chose from including their cubana torta which looked to be the most popular items as they were cooking up a ton of them. It s a monstrous torta including breaded steak  ham  sausage  cheese  lettuce  tomato  onion  avocado  jalape os  beans and chipotle mayonnaise. That d be one for another visit. Maybe tomorrow.
Mi Tradición,96,This place is half restaurant  half bakery. An authentic Mexican spot where everything is delicious   Restaurant has GREAT breakfasts tacos. They use handmade flour tortillas and pack the tacos full. You can t beat their prices and the food is delicious   Bakery has delicious pan dulce  empanadas and churros  They also have b lio bread. All great prices.   And all the people that work there are nice and helpful.
Mi Tradición,97,Hidden Mexican street food gem in a Tex-Mex dominated city. The menu is what you would find in Mexico City. Simple  handmade  great food. Tortillas are made in-house.   My go-to are the tortas de milanesa in a bolillo. My wife loves the tostadas de picadillo.   Aguas frescas are a great way to beat the heat and super affordable.   I m still working my way through the menu so not sure if I can say I have a favorite yet.   Seating is limited but have always found a place to sit. Don t forget to take a cruise through the bakery.
Mi Tradición,98,So great  Just went today and I was so happy to see everyone working AND everyone shopping in masks and many in the back wearing gloves. And everyone was extremely sweet.
Mi Tradición,99,This place is amazing. This is where I go for my traditional Mexican food. No Tex mex here. This is like I am eating in San Luis Potos . Their tacos are great but their tortas are better. Once you re done swing by their panadera  where their bolillo bread comes from  and grab a bunch of sweet bread to take home.
Mi Tradición,100,A Mexican bakery on one side and quick lunch spot for tortas and tacos on the other. When you walk in  your olfactory nerve is bombarded the delightful smell of baked breads. The choices are endless. They have a large selection of pan dulces  empanadas  bolillos  flan  pastels and ice creams. You can special order cakes for birthdays and other celebrations. The pastries are huge and range from about  0.70- 1.50.  Pick up a bag of day old pastries for  1.00.   The savory part of the restaurant is also a must try. I ate the torta al pastor today and it was fantastic.  The bread was butter-toasted on the inside and soft with a slightly chewy texture. The toasting of the inside prevented it from getting soggy. We also had the steak tacos  alambre and pork enchiladas. Each taco is double-wrapped and comes with a fresh  spicy green salsa and an earthy red salsa. The meat fillings for the tacos were coarsely minced so it s very tender and full of flavor.  Humble  tasty food for a very low price. Order at the counter  grab a seat and wait for your name to be called. Don t forget to pick up a spork at the counter. You ll need it.
Mi Tradición,101,I know this place is known for tacos and tortas  but I got the tlacoyos and wasn t impressed. It was flavorful  but maybe I should have gone for the tortas. Their churros were okay--I had to pop them in the oven for a crunch  and so was the strawberry dulce de leches cake  caramel flavor was severely lacking . Overall not impressed. I m no expert on Mexican cuisine though.
Mi Tradición,102,Favorite place for authentic Mexican food. Reminds me of home  My mom actually brought me here and I ve been obsessed with ever since. Love the tortas and all the pan dulce your little heart desires 
Mi Tradición,103,Look I ve come here as a little kid since it has opened. Recently I went independently went for some badass actual Al pastor tacos con pina   Fucking Killer food . While there got me refreshing horchata and some vey tradicional pan dulce. Look my family buy pan dulce only certain places and this has been our top favorite it s just far from us  but we cherish the taste from this place. Also  sat at the window because I like seeing how food is made  Home made Tortillas on la comal  yum
Mi Tradición,104,Cubano and pastor tacos  Can t get enough even though I m stuffed and ready to take a nap  
Mi Tradición,105,We came here first for the Mexican sweet bread. It s the best Pan Dulce we have found in Austin. The white bread  bolillo  is delicious too.   Then we started coming here for the Tortas. First time I have tried authentic Tortas in the US. Wow. Now we can buy the bread  Telera  and prepare the Tortas at home.  A few weeks ago Chuys expanded to a full restaurant. We visited last night for the first time. I trid the Tlacoyos  a Torta de Milanesa  a picadita  a quesadilla de Tinga and a quesadilla de Hongos. Oh yeah  and some pan dulce for dessert. All for about  10 per person.  What can I say  I would give Chuy s six stars if I could. No  make it seven. It is the most authentic Mexican antojitos north of San Luis. You will find me at Chuy s just about every week.
Mi Tradición,106,I was in the area having lunch and saw this place on the yelp app. I had never seen or heard of it. It was hard to find  I thought it was in the front of the plaza and not the side.   They offer quite the selection of baked treats lining the wall in glass cabinets. The prices are super cheap compared to what you find at grocery stores. Just grab yourself a sheet pan and tongs and browse till your hearts content. One side is a bakery and the other side serves tacos and tortas. The bread they use for the tortas is delicious. I had to grab a bag for sandwiches at home.
Mi Tradición,107,I ve been in search of a delicious authentic Mexican restaurant and I ve finally found it  Mi Tradici n will not disappoint  I promise  I ve loved everything I ve tried - bistek tacos  tacos al pastor  quesadillas  tortas  huaraches  etc. It s all super delicious  I also love the fact that they have a panader a attached so you can easily grab a churro for dessert. My boyfriend and I are obsessed and when I go visit my parents back home they always ask for some bread from the panader a. 10 10 for sure   
Mi Tradición,108,Unfortunately the food and service is horrible. I was born and raised on the border and know a bad  good  and great panaderia when I see one. This place is awful and has horrible customer service.  We had ordered a torta and it took 30 minutes to serve it...what s worse  they served 5 other customers who were there after us  and still could not get our order together. Am very disappointed in this place...and their churros are just bad.   In the end  no apology  no torta  but we did get our money back. Bummer.
Mi Tradición,109,Rating the bakery only as I haven t tried the restaurant side - you MUST try the tres leches cake by the slice. They do single slices individually packaged as well which is honestly a game changer for small parties. My personal favorite are the chocolate and cappuccino. There are so many delicious baked goods  marble cake  chocolate cake  churros  stuffed and not stuffed  cookies  donuts  etc. . It s become my go to feed my sweet tooth  my Saturday morning snack-attacks and boosting morale with my colleagues  
Mi Tradición,110,I love everything about this place.  The food is freshly prepared.  You can sit at the bar window and watch them cook your food which is always fun.  And it s all delicious.  I ve tried the cubano torta  the steak tacos  the tacos al pastor  the chicken and potato quesadilla  the pork skin quesadilla  and the squash quesadilla.  Every single one of those dishes was outstanding  but I think my favorite is the squash quesadilla.  It s just so simple and perfectly done.  Despite the fact that my Spanish is lacking and that has caused a few miscommunications  the service is great and the staff is very friendly.  Now  it is a pretty small spaced seating can be difficult during rush times.  I recommend going for a late lunch as it clears out a bit.  After your meal you HAVE to walk over to the bakery side.  There are cases and cases of beautiful  delicious sweetbreads.  Grab a tray and some tongs and go wild   Try as much as you can.  They will bag it all up for you and it won t hurt your wallet.  The pastries are very affordable   Speaking of affordable...on our last trip there  we got one torta  2 quesadillas  and drinks for about  15.  Then we got a big bag full of sweetbreads and cookies to take home from the bakery for  8.  You really can t beat that  especially with the high quality of the food.  This really is a wonderful little gem of a restaurant.  And it s firmly in my top five Austin favorites.
Mi Tradición,111,The tacos  quesadillas  tortas  the aguas are always delicious  the seating is kinda small  so its better to go whenever its not busy
Mi Tradición,112,Massive tortas  lots of Mexican sweets to choose from  and they have Mexican cheeseburgers  The food is good especially for the price. And their fresh flour tortillas are great. The churros have a bit of a creamy custard filling  thumbs up.
Mi Tradición,113,Mi Tradici n is our go to place for some legit authentic Mexican food. Our regular order is the Torta cubana  and a orden of tacos de bistec  oh and you can t forget to get a agua fresca  They have horchata  jamaica  melon  pi a  and sandia  I highly recommend the jamaica  The torta cubana has milanesa  ham  sausage  and cheese and it s all in their homemade pan bolillo. I recently ordered takeout and decided to try the tacos al pastor  and they were bomb. I do however recommend asking for the pineapple on the side or not at all depending on how much you like pineapple. The pineapple was a bit too bitter for my taste but I just took them off. The pastor is seasoned really well. The restaurant is half bakery half restaurant  and is very authentic Mexican looking. I ve tried a few of their pan dulces and it s the beat I ve had in Austin by far. The staff is really nice and work hard to keep everything clean. I plan to try everything on the menu because it all looks so good.
Mi Tradición,114,Over all..  The food was good..  But the employes had a shitty attitude Definitely not coming back
Mi Tradición,115,Not bad for borderline authentic Mexican food. It s closer to authentic than regular tex-mex  that s for sure. They do have some more authentic dishes which was really cool  and the food overall was good. It was a little on the greasy side though.  If I was craving some authentic Mexican food  I d come here. They also have Te- Jamaica and Horchata which made my heart very happy because I haven t seen that anywhere else.   OH and their panaderia is amazing too.  Ample amounts of parking 
Mi Tradición,116,Excellent and fresh bread and pastries as well as yummy sandwiches and tacos and variety of drinks. Since I discovered it  I went twice in two weeks. Highly recommended and fair prices too.
Mi Tradición,117,One star for the bakery. Tacos and standard menu are pretentious. Don t have chorizo or Al pastor on the menu all day. When you order breakfast sausage and eggs plate  you get hot dog  egg  bean torta. Ordered in Spanish.
Mi Tradición,118,I came here for breakfast  the options are a bit limited since they re prepping up for the lunch hour.  I was a bit turned off by this...it seemed that they were more concerned with prepping up for the coming meal rather than the actual customer that was seeking a nice meal.  If you re a Vegetarian like me  I wouldn t come here since there isn t much for us other a breakfast taco that has eggs  and cheese or possibly eggs with potatoes.  As I would ask the lady at the counter for any options  she  and the rest of the staff seemed to be lost or didn t know what to tell me.  So   simply just asked for something simple like the egg  and cheese breakfast tacos  two of them .  Don t get me wrong  the tacos tasted delicious...it s just that I expected so much from all of the high ratings that this place has gotten.  I m pretty sure that their lunch menu is outstanding...but  their breakfast menu definitely sucks.  Overall  I wasn t impressed with their staff  and their customer service...they re whack.  Again  the food tasted good...but  the whole experience was ruined by their lack of attention to their clientele and subpar customer service.  They need to understand that they are NOT doing the customer a favor by selling their food to them.  It s the customer that does that by eating at this establishment   
Mi Tradición,119,Great food. Exteamly clean. The best traditional Mexican food around. Can t say enough good things about this place. Highly recommend.
Mi Tradición,120,Great food  even better prices   A friend of mine recommended this place and after I saw that it was a full scale Mexican bakery  I knew I had to try it out.  I will start with the lunch part of my meal.  Came here on a Friday around 12 and the place was pretty crowded  with every table taken but we were able to find one table open by the time our food came out.    I ordered three pork tacos on corn tortillas for  4 and one chicken and potato quesadilla for  3.  This was a good amount of food for under  8 which is not bad at all.  The quesadilla was very filling and had a lot of taste in it.  The tacos were also great  especially the pineapple topping on them.  I was very pleased with the meal and I definitely want to come back and try more.  After our meal  we made our way over to the bakery side  and I was not disappointed.  Everything smelled absolutely wonderful over there.  I purchased a couple churros and other stuff to take back home.  The prices were all very affordable and worth every cent spent.
Mi Tradición,121,One of Austin s hidden gems. Authentic  cheap  and delicious  I eat here 1-3 times a week and I m never disappointed. So good 
Mi Tradición,122,My favorite place for both delicious Mexican pastries and wonderful Mexican food and Agua Frescas on a hot day. I am addicted to the chicharron emanadas. Stopped in last week to see if they made birthday cakes.  They do  Ordered a Tres Leches cake for my husband s surprise party and it was perfect. Moist but not soggy  plenty of fruit and the guests loved it. I am glad we got the bigger size as we devoured the whole cake in short order. Highly recommend. Plenty of parking too.
Mi Tradición,123,The bread here is very authentic   I got me some of those flaky and rich conchas that everyones mexican mom likes.   They had the pig bread. Cream cheese enpanadas. They had sweet bread muffins. They had jalapeno pigs and blankets which were huge   They even have a mexican restaurant right next door.   I filled 3 brown paper bags with bread and it was less than 12 dollars   Lets just say I alot of bread that week. Im even thinking about bring my Ma back here so she can try all the bread
Mi Tradición,124,This place was well worth the drive  the food was among. And don t forget about the deserts. I will be coming back soon.
Mi Tradición,125,Such a big selection of sweet and savory treats for a very affordable price  Highly recommend the strawberry tres leches cake 
Mi Tradición,126,Great breakfast tacos  Always very friendly and the bakery is amazing too 
Mi Tradición,127,Fantastic  delicious  fresh  flavorful  are a few words I would use to describe this place. The best place I have discovered here in Austin or better yet anywhere for authentic style Mexican food and desserts. Forget that Tex-Mex crap that you will find on every corner. This is a hidden gem  that you should definitely check out especially if you like delicious authentic made from scratch Mexican food. Their menu consist of a variety of things such a Tortas  tostadas  quesadillas  tacos  and Mexican plates  served with or on freshly made tortillas which is a rare find here in Austin. They also have a bakery that has a wide variety of made from scratch Mexican desserts. If you haven t been here you must go because your missing out.
Mi Tradición,128,So my MIL shows up at our house with some extra sweets that she picked up at a Mexican bakery  located by our chiropractor s office. We often share our treats to avoid ingesting all the extra calories. Share the love    When I opened the grease spotted brown paper treat bag  light began to emanate from deep in its belly. I plunged my hand in and victoriously claimed a wavy yellow cake thingie wrapped in red paper.   Not exaggerating  it was as if the heavens parted and angels began to sing. I looked around and continued to devour the gift of the gods. It was  no lie  slap yo momma good.   Can t wait to go gold mining myself soon. Major discovery  
Mi Tradición,129,Very authentic. I really enjoyed it. My wife found it too spicy  but I love spicy food. Great for lunch. I will be back for sure.
Mi Tradición,130,Grab your tray and load up on bread   Are there any sweeter words in the English language  Delicately crusty bread  yummy traditional desserts   I ve always loved good Mexican bakeries and this one delivers  Super clean and I really enjoy walking through and plucking what looks tasty to me. Mi Tradicion makes me feel like the Queen of Gluten 
Mi Tradición,131,Mi Tradicion has pretty great  cheap Mexican pastries as well as a diner that serves up some of the tastiest authentic tacos I ve ever had. I love the tacos de carne enchilada  x3 . It s pretty much 3 big piles of delicious spicy meat with some onion and cilantro on 3 fresh corn or flour torillas. I prefer corn tortillas. It comes with lime to squeeze on too. It s simple  traditional  and delicious.  You can add cheese  queso  for a little extra charge. This place is super cheap--like  4 three tacos. I love to take these home and smother them with my own homemade guac.
Mi Tradición,132,Awesome bakery and awesome food  It s always pretty busy when I come here. I usually get tostadas and tacos. Their flan is very good too 
Mi Tradición,133,Amazing amazing amazing      Had the tacos. Amazing. The salsa  amazing. It smelled like heaven walking in the doors. Cashier was friendly  place was clean  
Mi Tradición,134,Came in at 6 30am 08-05-18 was treated horrible by staff saying they were closed yet the door and website clearly says 6am. Won t be back here  Headed to Tyson s tacos can t go wrong with them.
Mi Tradición,135,Pretty good  not the best ever.   Meat kinda sketch but I still ate it. My boyfriend loves it but he will eat anything. The pastries are good but again  not the best ever. There is a lot to choose from though.  For the price  it is pretty good.
Mi Tradición,136,Based on some recent Yelp reviews  I hopped down 183 to Mi Tradicion and was blown away not only by their selection  but their helpfulness.   I was there to pick up a birthday treat for a friend  and had no idea that there would be SO MANY amazing choices. Their flowery flan looks super cool  and it is what pulled me in initially  but their empanadas  tres leches  cakes  traditional flan  cookies  and doughnuts made me totally second guess what I actually wanted to get. I ended up getting a piece of their cappucino tres leches cake  upon the recommendation of the lady at the counter who assured me it was their most popular. It was a thick  tall slice with chocolate curls on top  and nicely packaged to go.   As I walked around the bakery cases to the left of the counter  I picked up a tray and some tongs and selected a guava empanada  as well as two pineapple empanadas. They were devoured by myself  my husband  and some friends and we all thought there were incredibly good.  I haven t tried their restaurant next door yet  but that s definitely next and I ll be updating my review.  If you re looking for something really cool  and a little different and something authentic  I d definitely recommend stopping by - this is a real treat no matter what your occasion. Thank you for being delicious 
Mi Tradición,137,Why did it take me so long to discover this place     Best authentic Mexican food in town   We had the tacos de bisteck  submarino  and torta de cubanas. Everything was delicious   Also I ordered a fresca sandia and it was perfect   Not to sweet at all  Just perfect   We then headed over to the bakery side and omg   The pastries are heaven   We got a little of everything.   The pineapple empanadas  some cake  some more empanadas  queso and then a Strawberry flan all to go   Will be coming back soon
Mi Tradición,138,I am not yet an expert on Mexican pastries  but I know what I like. Soft moist breads  flaky pastries  sweet but not overpowering. I think this place does those things well.
Mi Tradición,139,Service  Nothing special  but it was by no means bad. I was able to place my order and get my food in a timely manner even though there were a good amount of people ahead of me.  Ambiance  Very family group friendly - there are plenty of booths and tables to accommodate.   Food  This is where the 4 star really comes from  I originally was planning to get 3 tacos  my go-to amount when ordering tacos   but I ended up getting one to save room for their baked goods. I m so glad I only ordered one because that was the biggest taco I ve ever had so far. I ordered a barbacoa taco - first  I just want to say the blue corn tortilla was phenomenal  That alone makes me want to come back  mostly because it reminds me of when I studied abroad . The barbacoa was slightly on the drier side  but it was nothing their picante salsa couldn t fix  which by the way isn t ridiculously spicy if you can handle your spice. Their mild salsa is a good alternative for those who like a kick but can t go beyond that. My friend and I also ordered some agua fresca - he had cantaloupe I believe  if not  melon  and I had their jamaica. I liked the cantaloupe more because it was more refreshing. The jamaica  though it tasted fine  I probably would get it again just to satisfy my cravings tbh   it didn t seem fresh aka possibly made from a powder mix. BUT I m no expert  I can only judge based on my previous encounters and I ve had better. Their baked goods were good enough. Nothing phenomenal but it definitely gets the job done if you have a sweet tooth.   Overall  Would I come back  Heck yes I would  in a heartbeat  I got a taco  a small agua fresca  and a few baked goods for roughly  10 
Mi Tradición,140,One hundred stars for this place   We decided to try another taco shop tonight and I felt like I was cheating on Mi Tradicion.  Never again  my love   The baked goods are cheap  plentiful  and delicious.  The taco plates are filling  and don t waste space on any of the nonsense rice and beans.  You came for the tacos  eat the tacos   Do you have more space   MORE TACOS   The specialty plates aren t actually plates...  They re just an extra taco and more delicious taco toppings.  Try the Alambre.  Mind.  Blown.  I haven t tried their tortas  maybe one day if I forget tacos are a thing.  Also  cheap.  For  10   tip  my fiance and I can get legitimately full here.  For  20  we can turn into giant people-esque balloons and roll around in pain while wondering why we insisted on eating enough food to feed a small village.  I love this place 
Mi Tradición,141,This is the most authentic bakery I have found in Austin. My husband and I go far out of our way to get our pan dulce here. I haven t been disappointed by a single pastry here  It s alll made fresh daily. Plus  they have a  small restaurant on the other side and it is delicious 
Mi Tradición,142,Super amazing and delicious. I fell in love with the cubana torta and Al pastor Huaraches. Con una agua de Jamaica 
Mi Tradición,143,Absolutely amazing   Why did it take me so long to discover this place   Every time I travel to Mi Tradicion I get tried the Cubana Torta. OMG. It is what dreams are made of. It is huge and I normally split it  so I can save room for pastries .   As far as the bakery side  I love the empanadas  pinapple . They are giant and filled with fresh made filling. Most fruit empanadas are filled with a gummy  overly sweet goop  but these are filled with heaven.   I am so sad that I moved away and I plan on coming here whenever I come back to town.
Mi Tradición,144,Love this place    It takes me back to my childhood when I used to walk around the corner from my house to the bakery in Bellavista  Ciudad Juarez  Chihuahua.   The smells are nostalgic and I instantly feel attracted like a magnet to the muffins in the red cupcake wrapping paper. I suddenly feel a child again and feel like crying because it has been more than 25 years since I have seen those muffins. I know I will never  ever  ever find that pan blanco dusted with flour and so dense when you bite it it becomes like the texture of a brownie  but Mi Tradicion will ALWAYS remind me de mi Mexico lindo y querido. Mi Tradicion brings me closer to home and I can take my kids here and tell them stories about why mommy likes a specific type of sweet bread without worrying about their safety.  BTW  the capuccino tres leches cakes is heavenly. Its a cake that is drenched in three different type of milks  I think  not saying this are the ingredients they use but this are the ingredients my mom used  they are evaporized milk  maybe condensed milk  and La Lechera  a sweet and thick consistency milk  then coffee is added as second layer of flavors......its  3.99 but its a very generous size.  Don t be afraid to try it. Delicious flavors and low prices don t need to be translated   .
Mi Tradición,145,Let me set the scene  It s Friday. Post-lunch. I m still hungry. I have a bad case of cubicle fever. It s beautiful out  or at least I think it is when I look over my cube wall and peek at the outside world. I NEED to get out.  This place was incredible. Never have I seen so many cases of pastries  especially cases of pastries that I have no idea what they are. I had no idea how to order or obtain said pastries  so I picked up one of the pre-made bags. Was is fresh or day old  Couldn t tell you  but it was  1. Seriously  it was  1  and it looked damn good.  I didn t have cash. Swore I had  5. Must have left it in a pocket. Oh but they re going to reluctantly take my card. Wait  yes  yes I think they are  there s a language barrier . But no  Mr. guy at counter steps in and pays for my funfetti bread with quarters  A little embarrassing  but awesome    It looks like they have lots of other desserts and tacos and such  so I will totally be back. 4 stars just because I couldn t figure out what to do. Will report back again soon....
Mi Tradición,146,Why did it take me so long to discover this place      The pastries and baked goods are fresh of course and economical.  I always thought Central Market had the best tortillas to go.  Well...this place is worth going out of the way for     I bought the tortillas  cookies  and empanadas to share with friends for a chili dinner. They thought the goods were as wonderful as I did.  And now we both know where to go to get the REALLY GOOD stuff.
Mi Tradición,147,I stop here every Sunday when I m in Austin visit my bf   It s tradition    I can t get enough of the Cuban torta    It s hands down amazing like mouth watering mmmm
Mi Tradición,148,Had the torta chilanga and shared an al pastor gringa. This is a bakery so the French bread used for the Torres is epic. The food is great 
Mi Tradición,149,Just finished the torta Cubana and have to say  it s one of the best I have ever had. As always the mexican bakery is very good. Stop in for the tacos or tortas  you won t be disappointed.
Mi Tradición,150,Very impressive wide array of Mexican pan dulces  Bakery staff busy baking and filling shelves all day  so all items are freshly baked daily. Conchas  savory empanadas were scrumptious. Churros are better purchased earlier in the day .... after being disappointed with the churros texture when I purchased a few in the later afternoon  I passed by in the morning the next day to try churros again and found them much better.  The ones I purchased in the afternoon tasted great but the texture made the churros hard and chewy instead of crisp. Looking forward to visiting again to check out their restaurant s offerings ... heard from a loyal customer that the tortas are EXCELLENT. We ll see 
Mi Tradición,151,Bakery selection is amazing   Tortas are delicious.  Tacos are awesome  What more can I say   It s certainly worth your time 
Mi Tradición,152,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE..  Everything from the yummy food to the  pan dulce  You can t go wrong. The Torta Chilanga is my absolute favorite as well as the tacos al pastor. They also have the best tres leches cake in Austin. If you go here you will be hooked     
Mi Tradición,153,I m almost tempted to not write this review because I love this place and I worry that it will be  discovered   but here goes. Mi Tradicion is an authentic--and I mean really authentic--Mexican bakery and torta  sandwich  place that makes some of the best Mexican street food I ve had anywhere in Austin and focuses more on things that aren t tacos  which is nice given how many taco joints there are.  My favorite thing here are the tortas. They re huge sandwiches made with fresh bread and then overstuffed with just about everything you can imagine. For instance  the chilanga comes with chorizo  ham  milanesa  breaded thin steak   avocado  lettuce  jalepe os and bunch of things I m forgetting. It weighs about a pound and costs  6. You can also toss in pretty much any baked confection you could want for another  1.  My favorite thing is the diabla torta which replaces the ham with scrambled egg. It s so good that I eat the whole thing despite it being about 40  more food than I really want to eat for lunch. They also have tacos that look good  but I ve never been able to stop getting the tortas because they re just too tasty.  I really don t know of any other place that comes close to this place in terms of great food  huge quantities and dirt cheap prices.
Mi Tradición,154,Mi Tradicion  former known as  Chuy s. No  the Mexican one.   is one of my favorite places. It s half bakery  half hot food. I ll review the two separately.  Bakery  Believe it or not  they have my favorite jalapeno  cheese  sausage kolache. I like that the best place to Czech pastry in Texas is at a Mexican restaurant. What a world  But seriously  if you come here  you have to try this kolache. No one believes me until they eat it but I promise it s awesome. The only way it could improve would be the bread were a little better but the sausage is perfect.  All the other baked goods are kind of whatever. I imagine that if you really like panaderias then this would meet your expectations. Personally  though  I don t really like Mexican style baked goods. It s not really fair for me to rate them on a genre of food I don t like and the kolache is so good that they still deserve 5 stars.  Hot food  The submarino is my go-to and has to be one of the best deals in Austin. You re probably thinking  What is a submarino and why are you eating a navy vessel   and those are solid questions. The submarino consists for 8 corn  or flour  I guess  but why would you do that   tortillas covered with about a pound of EVERY MEAT  steak  pastor  bacon  and mushroom - yes  I know that one is not a meat   covered in melted cheese  served with a spicy red sauce and cool green sauce. The feint-hearted could likely split this dish but at around  7.50 it s a steal.  They also some taco plates that are good but you really want to stick to the specialty plates.
Mi Tradición,155,This is my kind of place  cheap  easy  tasty  insert jokes here .  I had 3 tacos de bisteck for 4.99 and found them to be both delicious  traditional and filling. People working there were plenty friendly. I liked that I heard a lot of Spanish speaking and that the panaderia on the other side was no frills  grab your tongs and platters if you re a newbie and then bring things up to pay  and from the guayaba pastry i tried  70 cents i believe  seemed like the kind of quality and taste you find in Mexico. Go here immediately- it s cheaper and better than any of those tex-mex chains that charge you 4  for what i call a  hipster  taco. But I digress...
Mi Tradición,156,I went here several months ago with my boyfriend after a spin class. Let s just say we might have been a little too hungry.   For food we had a rueban and tacos al pastor and they were very good. Also they have delicious fresh squeezed juice that s kinda pricey but worth it for the taste.   The bakery is where we went crazy. You get a baking sheet and start filling up so we got a large variety to eat over the next several days  or gone by next day as it turned out...oops . I especially like light bread type pastries so the sugared donuts were my favorite. It was my first time trying Mexican sweet breads and those were quite good as well.   I love the feel when you walk in  both clean and lots of cultural character  and it was a very unique experience for someone who had never been to a Mexican bakery before. I keep meaning to go back but next time I ll have to remember just because the baking sheets for selecting pastries are large  it didn t mean you have to fill it up   
Mi Tradición,157,My daughter told me about this place and I spent about 30 minutes driving back and forth and around the parking lot looking for it.  It s around the corner  I don t speak any Spanish so I couldn t really tell you what s on the menu or what bakery items were.  But everything looked good   I picked out an assortment of pastries to take the kiddos and headed to the counter where it looked like you could order a taco.    I couldn t read anything so I asked for a chicken taco.  The lady didn t understand me so we had to wait for the manager who spoke English.  They don t have chicken tacos   Weird  but my daughter said it was like home  Los Angeles  and I was desperate for a fix  so I ordered pork tacos.  They were delicious     The hot sauce was very good.  Later on  the pastries were enjoyed by the kids.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lack of English made it very difficult for me to know my choices on the menu.
Mi Tradición,158,If you don t believe in love at first bite  try this place.
Mi Tradición,159,First of all  this is a good place BUT honestly I dont understand why this place is so popular. Their taco was just okay. Of course bettr than Taco Bell but many other places in Austin have better Taco.  Their Mexican bread or dulce pan is better than other supermercado. But thats it.  Thus guys will make millions based on the line of waiting around the clock.
Mi Tradición,160,I went in here armed with Yelp knowledge.  When I found out we were having a Cinco de Mayo potluck at work  I came up with the brilliant plan to bring in some Churros.  I ve never had a churro but had a vague idea of what they were and this seemed like the perfect occasion to try them.  Ater doing a little Yelpsearch I discovered this place was on my way to work.  Perfecto   I walked in confidently  knowing that I was to grab a silver tray and tongs and just help myself....and there they were   The tray and tongs off to the left.  Now.  Just browse thru the multitude of pastries.....umm...err...and this is what I saw   wrechklhdsalfulkfflkhalfhdlo jdlkjeolliu empanadas uellzjpudfjeluoljso jgnneoccuojlasjiojo churros jeljoeijnalndfojo thingamajigio con jambon y queso ejowurlejljdfourros etc  Obviously my Yelp knowledge fell desperately short of a full immersion Spanish language tutorial.  It might as well have been in Dothraki. So  I just first grabbed about 10 churros and then some empanadas  and the thing with ham and cheese and a couple of other interesting looking pastries.  All of this seemed to weigh 5 lbs as I sheepishly handed the tray to the cashier.   12.50    That cost less than trying to make guacamole  avocados ain t cheap     After smelling the mouth watering aroma of El Regio s grilling chicken from across the street as I walked to my car  I actually drove out with the windows down to experience that longer   I decided to sample on my way to work.  Lemme just warn you something.  The ham and cheese pastry thingiemajigio was so flakey  I will be finding crumbs in my console 3 years from now.  Oh  and it wasn t ham and cheese.  It was shredded spicy chicken.  Still delish but verrry bready.  Not enough filling for me  regardless of what the filling was.  Alot of the racks  I was finding out  were mis-labelled.  Next warning   Do not sneak a churro if you are wearing all black.  I walked into work lookin like I d been fairy dusted at Carnaval.  The Churro that I took a bite of had the dulce de leche filling  but later on I found some that had more of a vanilla cream filling.  I definitely prefer my churros with cream filling  no surprise.  Again  there was no labelling on the racks so no way of knowing which churro is which.    All I can attest to  is the churros were quickly consumed  we cut them into quarters so easy to grab and to tell which filling was inside  but some of the other pastries were left over.  Apparently I m not the only Spanish pastry novice.  I have been trying for years to get my job to pay for a medical Spanish course.  Maybe I shoulda been pushin for Spanish Bakery  Espanol instead.  I will be back to try the tacos or tortas....OR   another brilliant idea   Pollo Regio chicken and Chuy pastries...the perfecto combo 
Mi Tradición,161,I ve begun to think in reviews.  The minute I sample a new pizza  get my choppers looked at by a doctor or get a new haircut  I start writing that review in my head. So this morning  when i bit into a kolache from Chuy Bakery  this review was born   I m going to make a bold claim  Chuy s bakery has the best kolaches in the city. And maybe the best kolaches I ve ever had. It s true. I ve had varieties of the famed kolach in Texas but I m always dissatisfied. Why are they so small  Isn t there supposed to be a sausage in here  Some cheese  They re two bites and usually dry.  This kolache is big and bold and spicy and has a sausage the size of about 3 4 of a hot dog with gooey cheese and jalapeno bits in it. Heat it up a little and then just close your eyes and enjoy every highly caloric bite. And since you ve ruined your diet anyway  grab a churro for later.
Mi Tradición,162,New Bakery on the corner of Ohlen and 183... right across from El Pollo Regio  mmmmmm greeeeeeen sauce...  and tucked behind Famsa.  Not that I know what Famsa is... I m kinda scared of the place.    I don t really know how to describe this place other than to call it a Mexican bakery.  You know what I mean... a bakery where they have all those brightly colored cookies and pastries that you ll never see in Upper Crust.  What I like about this place is that the chocolate croissants are the best I ve had.  Way better than Upper Crust because they cost like half as much and have like 4 times the chocolate chips inside.  The coffee is good  the breakfast tacos are made from scratch  are cheap  like a buck  and you can get as many ingredients as you want without extra charge.  And the coffee is ok.  What s a little odd is that sometimes they don t have what I want... like they ll be out of the chocolate croissants.  And if they run out of coffee  you have to wait while they brew another pot... they don t have a backup waiting.  I m going to keep going back... and I think it s worth a shot  at least to try the chocolate croissant.
Mi Tradición,163,I ve come here before for the bakery - some pretty large kolaches and some empanadas  but what I came back for this time . . . the Tortas.  My wife would never let me come here  but she s off watching a movie with friends.  So that meant that I could eat whatever I wanted.  I got this monster cubana torta.  A fresh bollilo  bread   fried milenesa  ham  and  hot dogs  sausage on the grill.  Add in some lettuce  tomatoes  and jalape o with a real kick.  This could and should last for 2 meals  but I was hungry.  The entire sandwich actually holds well together for its gigantic side.  You will not feel like you ve been let down when you see the size of this monster.  I ll be back.  This will definitely be one of the places I go when it s just a guy s night.
Mi Tradición,164,I went her for lunch today because my good friend Judy K gave this place a 5 and rave about it.   The place is a little confusing especially for a Midwest hillbilly. There are two entrances. One for the bakery where you get a metal tray and pick out what you want and the other side is a order at the counter and have a seat. The checkout is a big square that serves both sides.   I got a empanada and kolache on the bakery side. When I walked up the checkout person was doing double duty helping people walking in for cakes and ordered baked goods and then checking out us with trays. It was really frustrating because what seemed like such an easy task took an extremely long time.   I walked over to the other side and noticed that they had more items on the menu. I decided I wanted a mushroom quesadilla. I walk up to order and there was no one in front of me but the women checking out had the same weird dual duty job helping people with the ice cream. She helped on guy with ice cream and then a family pack of five came in and all wanted ice cream. Urgh. The ice cream was really frozen so it took her a really long time. She finally rang me up about 10 minutes after I first stood in the non existent line.   I sat down and started to eat my Kolache. It wasn t bad but it was kind of hard like day old bread. The empanada had some ground beef and onions and it was just ok. Then the wait for my quesadilla came. Orders were coming up but I just kept waiting and waiting. Then the cashier disappeared. Food was piling up at the counter and I could see my order so I asked one of the cooks. He had no idea what I was saying and I speak very little Spanish.   At this point I didn t know if anything was going to salvage my experience. So why the 4 star  Well  my quesadilla came and looked delicious. They forgot the salsa so I went to the counter and asked for some. This quesadilla is the bomb  It was gooey goodness with sauteed mushrooms and they don t skimp. It was put in a blue corn tortilla which I love and queso fresco. The salsa was this amazingly flavorful and spicy delight. I would like to bottle some of it up. It was worth it and I will definitely come back to try some of the other things on the restaurant side.   1 star service  3 stars food  5 Stars for having SPORKS  I even took one home with me.
Mi Tradición,165,This place is right near my work so I eat there quite often.  My two usual go to meals are the huarache al pastor made with blue corn masa and mexican sour cream  no hot salsa for me  and the ham and egg torta.  Both make my co workers jealous.  I only docked a star because all of their meats need more seasoning and the bakery doesn t compare to those in Mexico.  I don t understand why bakeries here can t make a good concha.
Mi Tradición,166,Don t eat here  This place is filthy and they have security cameras in the bathrooms  Super creepy and seems illegal. Stay away 
Mi Tradición,167,Last week I was there three times.  I just find this place quite appealing.  Their tortas are soooo good.  My fav is the simple torta con huevo  with egg .  Their flan is delicious.  Their bread should be put on a pedestal  
Mi Tradición,168,Cheap  big portions  delicious. Come expecting lots of high quality meat and cheese. Staff probably won t give recommendations because everything is as-described and well executed. The torta cubana is a classic and an easy recommendation  imo.
Mi Tradición,169,This place is probably my favorite go-to legit Mexican food place. I always get a torta and have yet to be disappointed  also the breakfast tacos are excellent  . They also run a bakery and will have plenty of Pan Dulce to choose from as well as Gelato and ready-made tres leches  etc. Keep in mind that they do experience dinner rushes etc.   My only complaint is that it seems the word has gotten out on how great this place is and it s no longer my own secret 
Mi Tradición,170,Amazing place to eat at. Asked one of our chefs where he goes on lunch break and this is where he told us to go. Definitely coming back
Mi Tradición,171,Three pounds  Chuy. Three pounds in five days.  I don t know how you did it - was it the spiced and cheesy cochinos in a blanket you call kolaches  the gigantic ears of flaky oreja pastries or the pink frosted Homer doughnuts  Perhaps it was the cream filled churros  the buttery cinnamon sugar cookies or the guava and strawberry empanadas.  Oh  hey  guess I do know how you did it. My b.  Doesn t help that everything is stupid cheap and comes as a monolith of self-servitude  piled upon an aluminum platter. What s that sound  It s Dr Oz turning in his gastrointestinal coffin.  Three fackin pounds. See you tomorrow 
Mi Tradición,172,Such an interesting place. Very busy bakery and a casual diner like food joint.  The tortas are sizeable and quite tasty.   I ll be back if I m in the area.
Mi Tradición,173,There are some secret places you don t want to share  and some secret places that are so good that you feel bad for withholding. Mi Tradicion is the second.  I first met this place when I had a need for a torta and yelp told me this was the closest one to my office. What kind of witchcraft are they making these tortas with   I ve tried watching them make it to try and discover the spell they cast on it  but best I can tell is that it can t be replicated. They toast the bread with some sort of garlic ish  butter and mix a little bit of cheese and onions in with the meat on the griddle  so it s almost like a grilled cheese-torta-Philly cheesesteak mix  AGH it s incredible.  I don t recommend the Hawaiiana unless you like hot dogs because they go big on the hot dogs in it.   The bakery has an incredible selection at unreasonably low prices. Today I stopped in with a sweet tooth and they were selling just slightly burned mantecadas  like a vanilla cupcake without the icing  at 3 for  1. Like  barely burned. So I walked out with a too-full bag of mantecadas because what are you  my doctor  Shut up.  I m coming for the frozen delights next.
Mi Tradición,174,Loved this place  I got the flautas. Only giving a 4 star because I wish it came with more salsa.
Mi Tradición,175,I m American  but when I go to a Japanese restaurant  I still know what to order. When I visit an Italian restaurant  I still know what to get. When I m at an Indian place  I still know what I like. When I walked into Mi Tradicion  I said   Uh  buhhhhhh    I recently moved to the  hood and Mi Tradicion was on the top of my list of newly neighboring restaurants to try. Eagerly  I strode in and checked out my surroundings. To the left  an extensive bakery wall  along with the actual.. people baking. Fresh tortillas   To the right  a restaurant side. Seemingly  you could order actual food at both.   I first perused the bakery wall- most items were not labeled in any way. The ones that were labelled remained a mystery to me. I saw a good  queso  or  pastor  thrown in every so often  but rarely have I been at such a loss when confronted with mounds of delicious looking food. And  mounds  is not an overstatement. There were at least... 20 bakery items- including savory and sweet with most looking delicious.  I basically followed the example of the people around me  picking up a weird tray with a weird spatula and shoveling anything resembling yumminess into the tray. I began to be concerned with price but decided   Hey  this is for science.   When I was full to the brim with pastries  I approached the check out line and looked over the menu. Nothing made sense to me. I even let people cut in front of me so I could study further. Yes  I see the words  torta  and  taco   but I m unclear what I can get in them.. The bottom of the menu was a new set of words   pastor   and  bistek ... So I see that there are also fillings that exist  but ... how do I.. What  The Yelp pictures.. where do I get that stuff   In the end  I chickened out and settled with only my bakery items. With the most pleasant surprise I saw that EACH ITEM WAS .75. YOU AREN T READING INCORRECTLY AND   I AM NOT JOKING.And almost everything was delicious  Some sort of custard bread  Delicious  Cheese empanada  Wonderful  Weird mystery bread-sugar  YES  Cajeta empanada  NEVERAGAINOHGODPUKE.  In the end  Pretty impressed confused by their bakery side and intrigued frustrated over the restaurant side. I will certainly return again  if only to learn what actual food it s possible to order.
Mi Tradición,176,This will be the place I must stop every time I m in town or drive by. The Cubana torta was juicy and delicious. The Diabla torta had chorizo  milanesa  ham  cheese... delish  The tostadas are massive  It s toppings are sandwhiched between 2 crunchy tortillas. The huaraches are to die for. Soft  thick blue corn tortilla topped with the savory fixins... No veggies on it. Heck  even their fries are killer  The horchata is room temperature so make sure to ask for extra ice. Mexican cokes to complete the authenticity of the flavors  It s a MUST TRY when in Austin. Fresh baked sweet bread and bolillos next door... Come on      Thank me later
Mi Tradición,177,If you want real REAL Mexican cuisine  this is the spot. Everything is delicious but for a first timer I would recommend the quesadilla or torta and don t forget to pair it with your horchata water 
Mi Tradición,178,This is my Austin Mexican bakery.  When I was a kid  my mom used to always take me to the panederia in Houston after school because well  it was cheap and we can get a lot of whatever we wanted.  This brought me back and the quality of the goods brought me back to that.  From the bolillos  to the queso croissants  to the churros to even the kolaches.  It s really carb heaven.  Not to mention it attaches to a tortas restaurant next door.  You can t go wrong here.  I ll be back because I ve been back time and time again.  Their tres leches cakes are also pretty good as well.  Can t stop  won t stop.
Mi Tradición,179,This place absolutely rocks. I ve been on the hunt for an authentic  excellent Torta joint in Austin for quite a while now  but have been burnt quite a few times now. Chuy s is like a bakery with a deli attached  but with a hispanic twist.  Its likely you won t have a bloody clue as to what you re picking up at the bakery seeing that nothing is labeled  but about 90  of items I ve blind picked have been absolutely delicious. That mystery empanada I picked up out of whim  Filled with delicious gooey pineapple  What about that odd spongey cake that looked funny  Strawberry filling  The items are so cheap that I really don t mind playing Chuy s russian roulette.   I also really loved their Bolillo bread  which made for some amazing sandwiches back home. If all else fails  ask someone else in there..People with a better understanding of the massive selection of baked goods at Chuy s really gave me a hand when I was stumped.  Now for the star of the show  THE TORTA. An unholy amalgamation of every meat imaginable into one epic  hangover smiting sandwich. Hotdog  breaded fried chicken  ham  avocado and cheese  I was miserable that Sunday until I was seduced by the Torta Diabla  who rid me of that terrible headache induced from a long night downtown. Absolutely delicious. The only thing I ve had which I didn t care for was the mushroom quesadilla  which came in a black tortilla and was smothered in cream and cotija..Not exactly what I expected.  That aside  Chuy s is amazing and there s always something new to try every time. Would definitely recommend it.
Mi Tradición,180,Thank goddddddd this place isn t tex-mex. Im so tired of fake mexican food    This place is authentic and so good  I got a huarache . The tortilla was so fresh   I got the potato and chicken and oh my goodness so freaking yummy      And spicy      Spent 10  and my boyfriend and I left full and completely satisfied  
Mi Tradición,181,This place is awesome  but I feel like Austin already knows that.  My  tip  for the restaurant would be to try the flour tortillas.  They re made in house in their bakery and they are some of the best flour tortillas in town. Their bolillos are also absolutely amazing.  Great for sandwiches or for eating with soup 
Mi Tradición,182,About 8 months ago I moved to Austin from the Rio Grande Valley. Throughout my 8 months in Austin I searched for a place with authentic Mexican food  similar to the one in the RGV  After many disappointments  I stumbled across Mi Tradici n  Oh my goodness  the food reminded me of home  I ordered a gringa  added beans and avocado to mimic a sincronizada from back home. My GF ordered the alambre tacos. The tortillas are home made  The food was  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a  Customer service was alright. The restaurant is busy but clean. Price is extremely reasonable  We had two full meals  big portions  with drinks for under  20 bucks  I highly recommend this place 
Mi Tradición,183,I felt like a kid in a candy store... and an ice cream store... and a cookie store... and a kolache store... and a taco store... and a... well  you get the idea. I m not a fan of panaderia-style baking  but it s hard to argue with the good stuff this place has to offer  all for ridiculously low prices.  Tacos Al Pastor   Solid  carved off a spit and if they were much cheaper they d have been paying me to eat them.   Picadillo Empanada  Amazing flaky  croissant-like crust. The picadillo wasn t inspiring but all it needed to do was provide a little contrast to the crust to make this one a winner. Well-played.  Bolillo  Had to grab a baked good to take home. The crusty outside and soft inside will remind you there s no substitute for just-baked bread.  All in all it s really  really  really hard not to like this place.
Mi Tradición,184,So I have been in search for a Mexican Bakery. Unfortunately I only got breakfast taco s today  which I have to say were very delicious. When I walked into the bakery  I was in sweet bread heaven. They have every kind of sweet bread that you could imagine. What was awesome is that you can even see them making the sweet bread and cooking the Mexican food. I will definitely making a lot of trips to this bakery and restaurant.
Mi Tradición,185,Mmmmm  if you re looking for some pan dulce  look no further. Excellent pan. I didn t try the restaurant but the food looked good.
Mi Tradición,186,I ve had Mi Tradicion bookmarked for a while and finally got a chance to go there for lunch this weekend.   A large space that s half bakery  half restaurant. Of note  the bakery section has a few savory warm items that I wish I had known about before making a decision. Well  that s just an excuse to go back now isn t it    I had an al pastor taco and a carne asada  bistec  taco along with a gigantic horchata. The tacos were delicious. I ve never seen al pastor with such red vibrant colors  The horchata was just okay.   I wish I had more room in my belly for a slice of tres leches cake  but the slice looked too big to handle. I settled on a piece of pan dulce which was also tasty.   Definitely making this a staple in my rotation 
Mi Tradición,187,Love it  Tortas are amazing and they have great Frescas. Pretty much anything we get there is good 
Mi Tradición,188,Mi Tradicion reminds me of the panderias back home in the RGV. You walk in  grab a tray  a pair of tongs  and pick your sweet bread. It s easy to over do it since your the one picking  but any soul with a strong conscience can resist it s sweet temptation. They have everything one wants from a Mexican sweetbread factory  in fact they bake everything back in the store. Empanadas are my favorites and they have multiple fillings to satisfy all tastebuds. I even picked up a dozen homemade tortillas and those were very good.
Mi Tradición,189,I have avoided this panaderia ever since I learned that they had to be sued by their employees before they would pay them the wages owed to them. They were putting everyone on salary and then making them work overtime without compensation.   New name  but it s the same owners as when it was Chuy s.   Here is the proof from the U.S. Dept. of Labor    a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.dol.gov 2Fopa 2Fmedia 2Fpress 2Fwhd 2FWHD20122074.htm amp s f68a708440f11c15a82d57938ce2a3d05229bd633a8786aa5ff7961569d35a09  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  dol.gov opa media press    a 
Mi Tradición,190,This review is for the restaurant not the bakery. After reviewing the menu which is not very clear on weather the tacos come as a plate meaning with your standard rice and beans or weather it was a la carte  I proceeded to ask the front counter employee taking the orders at which point she rudely answered it was a la carte and rice and beans are extra . I placed an order for a huarache  3 picadillio tacos  a torta Cubana  and an order of rice and beans. About 15 minutes later we received our order only to be completely disappointed the huarache which is a large open faced taco  was covered in entirely way too much creama and cheese which made the whole thing incredibly soggy. Secondly the 3 picadillo tacos were incredibly bland like it hadn t even been salted or peppered. And finally the worst thing of all was the torta cubana. I was expecting your standard Cuban sandwich which is usually constructed of carnitas ham  provolone and pickles or a similar arrangement however this thing was just awful and I mean awful. It was slathered with refried beans  awful tasing beef milanesa steak  a pickled jalape o and the most revolting thing ever placed on a so called  torta cubana  weenies and not even the quality beef wieners. Those hill country faire like 24 for a dollar wieners. It really seemed like the owner is attempting to cut corners and maximize profit at the expense of the customer. Nothing about this said Cuban  Fidel Castro would have these people executed in a heart beat  The bakery is good but I would stay away from the restaurant.
Mi Tradición,191,Hungry  Bored  Spice up your life and add a little diversity   My sweet tooth had a craving for a donut and Chuy s was in the neighborhood. There is quite a unique experience with this place. On one side  there is a bakery with a diverse mix of pastries and yummy treats that makes the inner-kid from within scream  On the other side is a restaurant where you place your order at the counter and wait for yummy food to come to you.  I was tempted to buy one of everything to try it out  but I decided I d better try a few each time I come here. The donut wasn t glazed hence  less sugar. I was kinda hoping for a softer  sugary heaven. The other treat  photo uploaded attached to this review  had some kind of custard on the top  It was more of a solid than a liquid cream that I was expecting. Good  but then again  not as sugary as I expected.  Don t get me wrong. The treats were good  REALLY good. That really says something about the bakery when they don t have to load their pastries with sugar and they still taste good.  As for the restaurant on the other side... I hope to try something from there soon. Until I do  this is a really nice place to come and enjoy some yummy pastries.
Mi Tradición,192,Love this place     The tacos  tortas  tostadas  quesadillas  pan dulce  Aguas frescas.... Man everything is good 
Mi Tradición,193,Favorites are the blue corn chicken quesadilla and guava empanada.  If you have a sweet tooth watch out this place could be dangerous.
Mi Tradición,194,Came here for lunch with some coworkers after another friend recommended it to me.  This place is half restaurant and half bakery.  For lunch I had the potato and chicken quesadilla and it was very good.  I made the mistake of getting only one. So if you want to get the quesadilla then I would recommend getting two.  The prices here are really good.  It is very inexpensive and the food is quality.  Of course we also had to get some stuff from the bakery too.  They have a really big selection and they have plenty of sweet treats.  I got some chocolate chip cookies  a chocolate filled churro  amazing   and this pineapple tart thing.  They were all excellent.  They also had a good selection of cakes etc in the refrigerated case by the register.  Oh yeah  they had samples of the cake too which is always nice.  Overall this is a solid  authentic Mexican bakery.  Nothing but good stuff here.
Mi Tradición,195,This place is a hole in the wall  Great bread  so many agua frescas to choose from   I particularly enjoy the hamburguesa and fries sooooo good. But those tortas are obviously why people keep coming. Surprising this place is not rated all stars because I ve never had a bad run in with it   Wish it stayed open later 
Mi Tradición,196,Some of the best tortas I ve ever had.   3 types of meats  avocado  veggies  mayo and Serrano s.  This is a messy delicious sandwich.  I will definitely be back.
Mi Tradición,197,Delish tacos  excellent pan dulce  Great customer service  My family and I stopped by last night right before closing and had a great experience. Will be returning 
Mi Tradición,198,Once again  the food is fresh and delicious. Really fresh. I still enjoy sitting at the window in front of the kitchen and watching the cooks do their magic. Next time I come I m going to try something with the blue corn tortilla. Watching the actual tortillas being rolled  pressed  filled and cooked makes my taste buds stand up and take notice. The chorizo gets piles on to anything that calls for it. Staff is friendly too.
Mi Tradición,199,I m giving a 4 because I haven t tried my pan dulce yet but my tacos al pastor were on point and they have good prices here. My friends and husband enjoyed their food as well. Great find... must try    We will be back soon.
Mi Tradición,200,Outstanding bakery. Everything is akazingly good. We had one of the moistest cakes here. Staff was friendly and helpful  most of them dont talk much english but it doesnt stop them from helping u. Next time my Austin visit will surely deserve a stop over here. Perfect value for money
Mi Tradición,201,We got tacos al pastor  a mushroom quesadilla  a milanesa torta  and a queso panela torta  all for under  18. They were all good  but the standout for me was the vegetarian queso torta. In addition to the cheese  it had avocado  jalape os  shredded lettuce  and carrot slices  possibly among other things I didn t notice . I wouldn t have thought to add the carrots  but they worked.   I didn t try the pastries this time  but I definitely will soon. They all looked amazing.
Mi Tradición,202,Half of this place is a resturant and the other half is a bakery.  I visit the resturant side 4-5 times a week on average  getting lunch on my way to work. The food is exceptional  and seems very healthy as well. The meat is good  its not that cheap fatty crap and the bread is ALWAYS fresh. I highly recommend the tortas  or their taco plates are great as well. Ive had 5-6 different menu items and have never once been dissapointed.   Its cheap too  taco plates are  4.99 and tortas are  5.50. Staff is exceptionally friendly and I highly recommend this place.  10 10 will stuff my face there again
Mi Tradición,203,Super cool bakery  I love being able to pick my own pastries. Most of the items have Spanish and English names up on the monitor. Walked out with a couple meat pies and a bunch of bakery goodies for work. I was shocked to see it was only  10    Happy to come back and try their lunch.
Mi Tradición,204,As a Mexican American  I can attest to the authenticity. It is delicious and it s my comfort food.
Mi Tradición,205,The tortas. The tacos. It s all good   You can t go wrong giving this place a try. They also have a bakery for you to checkout. Just a solid Mexican food place that I continue to go back to time and again.
Mi Tradición,206,Hit the jackpot with this one. We enjoyed the bakery today. Looking forward to trying tacos next time.
Mi Tradición,207,Been going to Mi Tradicion. Off and on for a few years for breakfast tacos. But today while in the bakery area I was watching a young lady remove bread from the oven and dumping them on a table. As she did this three loafs fell on the cement floor and remained there on the other side of the table.  Another person came by and placed them back on the table for resale and the young lady stacked them up and started unloading another tray from the oven on top of them.  Nasty floors I even video them doing it.
Mi Tradición,208,Mi Tradicion is the Real McCoy when it comes to really authentic Norte o food  but has other special items too like the Torta Cubana which is a meal in itself. I was really tempted to go over to the Bakery side after I finished my 3 Street Tacos but would have had to spend another hour on the Treadmill...
Mi Tradición,209,Saw a review that suggested the Torta Diabla so I had to try. Easily shareable if you can t eat that much in the morning but I definitely ate it all and was full for the ENTIRE day. Just do yourself a favor and get it. The veggies tasted fresh and I looooove that you don t have to pay extra for avocados. Delicious 
Mi Tradición,210,Probably the best al pastor tacos I ve had anywhere. A solid 5.
Mi Tradición,211,Food is delicious  bread is fresh  our birthday cakes are a must here  Don t forget the fresh aguas. Over all a great place to get great food.
Mi Tradición,212,Great  food too bad they have poor customer service and restaurant management.  I was there this afternoon at 1pm and seven groups of people were served before me despite the fact that  I ordered first.  Simple order of two tacos  tinga and picadillo.   We waited an hour  I went up three times to ask and only got  Un sugundo . My husband went up once and the woman took his ticket away.   On the third time I DEMANDED some attention and asked about my order. I suspected it was the one right there at the side of the stove and had been there each time I asked about my order.  The women behind the counter never allowed me to ask  just shut me up with her lame  Un segundo .  It was cold and insipid after sitting 45 minutes or so     When I complained  to Miss Un Segundo that it was cold I got nothing. Get better customer service please               this is horrible.
Mi Tradición,213,Haven t had the food but the pan dulce is the BOMB   Only place I will buy from from now on and I love in Georgetown   
Mi Tradición,214,This place has an excellent selection of authentic Mexican pastries and the breakfast tacos were pretty good. If I lived in the area this would be my go to spot. Although I didn t try them  the cakes in the display case look delicious and beautifully decorated.
Mi Tradición,215,I have been here twice.  The first time without Yelp and the second time after seeing the excellent review here.  I was disappointed the first time about 1.5 years ago.  I went again recently  it looked good but I was disappointed.  It was not terrible but I left a couple of pieces uneaten which is rare for a guy who has to eat everything on his plate.   I am only speaking about the bakery items  i have not had anything from the restaurant.  I have had bad luck  most places looking for Mexican bakeries.  I assume they use those pellets of dough that become something.  I guess the 2 places that I find are better are La Mexicana and Fiesta  supermarket  bakery although it is 3 stars.  I am an old guy that remembers being in Mexico City and other places in Mexico back like 40  years ago when I was a small kid and loving bakery stuff.  The Mexican bolillos were a thing of beauty  the good stuff is harder to find now even there.
Mi Tradición,216,I LOVE this place    I can t put it in words .... food is great and so are the deserts  AMAZING
Mi Tradición,217,Ordered the steak and al pastor for my hub and I. My hubby s al pastor were yummy. As far as my steak  it was a tad bland. The corn tortillas and the veggies made the tacos great. If only the steak wasn t so hard to chew  it would of been to die for 
Mi Tradición,218,Amazing selection of pastries at really low prices. Everything is made fresh  and the high amount of traffic the store gets means nothing ever sits around long enough to go stale. The bread is really good. You can also order tacos and other taqueria-type items at the mini-restaurant on the other side of the store. Always clean.
Mi Tradición,219,This is only a review of the bakery portion of this establishment as I didn t try the restaurant portion.  The bakery seemed to have lots of pastries and rolls but when I asked the employee at the counter to direct me to any loaves of bread she said they don t carry any   What kind of  bakery  doesn t make any loaves of bread     This one apparently...
Mi Tradición,220,When I come to this place  I am not Matthew  a nerdy Dad from Austin. I am Mateo  a wealthy tobacco farmer who  after a day only comparable to that of a Telenovella hero  I wish to have a torta to fill my hungry belly  And this place  by all that is holy  delivers.  I had a torta cubanas - a medley of delicious meat with avocado  jalapeno slices  a thin layer of refried beans  and some seriously tasty bread. There were several other varieties  as well  but I think I chose amazingly well. Tacos  tortas  quesidilla - all extremely reasonably priced and  gauging from the pleased looks on the other patrons faces as they ate I d say anything you order here is probably just as good.  The bakery  of which I didn t try  looked like a treasure trove of treats. One of my coworkers purchased two bags full of random items  including pumpkin empanadas - quite the haul indeed.  Will definitely go back  especially now that I know the ordering system and how use my rudimentary Spanish to my advantage.  MATEO WILL RIDE AGAIN.
Mi Tradición,221,My friend told me that this was the best authentic Mexican restaurant in Austin and I have to agree. The food was good and super affordable  but the workers there didn t know English  which  I guess  is a sign that it s authentic   I got the sausage and egg gotta which was extremely good and my friends got the tacos and Torta as well so you can get anything here and enjoy it  It s also attached to a bakery so you can get some tasty treats after you eat 
Mi Tradición,222,Este restaurante me record  a mi Mexico querido. The milanesa torta was to die for  the churros were amazing as well. Over all I would recommend this restaurant  the bakery attached had very delicious pastries. 10 10 would recommend for authentic Mexican Tortas
Mi Tradición,223,From the moment you walk in  you know you re going to have a great experience at Mi Tradicion. On the left  you have a bakery with every type of pan dulce you can think of. It s freshly baked and smells delicious. I am partial to their kolaches and conchas. On the right  you can get any type of juice  I LOVE the horchata  you want and order off the menu. They have addicting tacos and tortas for an amazing price. The hours are great as well  very convenient. You re going to have to hold me back so I don t go there right now 
Mi Tradición,224,I m going to share a little secret with each of you What makes a taco go from good to amazing   The tortilla   That s it  you have to use fresh tortillas that have a genuine homemade taste feel.  I m not sure why so many taco establishments here in Austin  I m looking at you Taco Deli   use the same tasting lame tortillas that are mass produced by HEB.  I think you guys know the ones I m talking about  the puffy white tortillas that taste like rice cakes.   GROSS    A real Mexican flour tortilla is flat  has patches that aren t fully cooked  a bit salty and you d want to eat one all by itself with nothing to be wrapped  perhaps a lil  butter on it too  .  Anyway  the amigos here at Mi Tradicion do many things perfectly and it transports you to a real Mexican bakery and restaurant in any-pueblo Mexico.  Make sure you try their breakfast tacos as well as their lunch dinner ones too   The  Al Pastor  and  Bistek  tacos are incredible grab a real  1 Litro Mexican Coca-Cola  and pull up a stool by the kitchen window to see your meal being made.
Mi Tradición,225,Mi Tradicion is a hidden jewel. One of those out of the way places that your lucky to find. All the pastries are baked fresh each day right there and they re outstanding. It s nice to find a place that makes real  Picadillo   instead of just plain ground meat. Very tasty  Priced very reasonable. Their homemade tortillas are the best. Can t make them this good at home. Highly recommended  You won t be disappointed.
Mi Tradición,226,I wanted to give this place a better rating. Loved the vibe-- lots of families coming to sit down and eat or just to pick up some bakery items.  I had some sweet baked goods  a nut cookie  and a popular sweet sort of bread . They were nice  but not my favorites  maybe because they re an unfamiliar flavor for me.  I got a shredded chicken empanada which I really enjoyed-- excellent flaky pastry holding that shredded chicken in.  Finally  I got al pastor tacos. The flavor was great  but the meat was some of the worst quality I ve found in Austin. There were chunks that were just fat  there were crunchy hard chunks too. I was disappointed and a bit disgusted.
Mi Tradición,227,Great bakery smell when you walk in the door. Grab a tray and load it up. Can t believe how good the prices were relative to quality   portion size. The other side with the hot food looks good too. Will be back.
Mi Tradición,228,Me and my wife are from Mexico I really love this place we have tried pretty much everything on the menu and everything is great. bread is amazing and I do recommend this place.
Mi Tradición,229,Everything is so fresh and delicious  From the savory to the sweet  Wait wasn t too long 
Mi Tradición,230,Great old school Mexican bakery. When you get fresh stuff off the shelf  it s amazing. Those churros  Unfortunately  they leave a lot of stuff on the shelf for longer than they should  so occasionally you ll pick up something that is super stale. It s cheap though  so just get a bunch of stuff and you re bound to pick a winner.
Mi Tradición,231,Went there for a quick lunch. The place was packed but they got the food out in a reasonable time frame. Our groups had various tacos and tortas  all of which were good. The bakery side of the building has a good assortment of pastries  leches  and donits.
Mi Tradición,232,Damn impressed   And honestly  Im glad I read reviews before going in because for this Texan  there is A LOT about authentic MEXICO-AN food I dont know much about     One thing that always intimidates me is the freakin menu. I cant read some of it  AND sometimes there are items IDK wth they are. LOL Ala  google  For real. Hate me if you want  but you dont learn by staying in the box  so I venture out and TRY. Thankfully there were two women behind the counter totally willing to help me sort out some of the choices  so that was comforting.   Which ever of the Yelpers said  grab a tray and some tongs   and pick away was DEAD ON   Great tip.   You have one side that is the deli  and one side that is the bakery  and it is DELISH no matter what side you re on. Not much on the bakery side is labeled  so just grab and be surprised  lol. Unless you re one of the ones in the KNOW. Im gettin there. I went in at 8pm and items were still being put in cases   Almost everything was a buck a piece  so I got 3 bags of pastries and a sandwich  I mean  TORTA  for  16   Score. I got a variety of breads  cookies  and treats. The cakes are awesome  the ice cream is the bomb and the Torta was HUGE     Plenty of food for your buck  and everyone that was eating inside was going to work on their plates  so it appears that everything is darn good.
Mi Tradición,233,Amazing selections of pastries and donuts. Super cheap as well.  But grab a torta  you won t be let down by any means. So damn good.
Mi Tradición,234,The best bakery I have been to in Austin.   Cool idea with cafeteria trays  very inexpensive you can try everything.  Coffee was really good.
Mi Tradición,235,This is the best authentic Mexican food I have found living in Austin. They have tortas  tacos  flautas  quesadillas and huaraches made with fresh blue corn tortillas. Food is delicious and made right in front of you  it s inexpensive and the best I ve had so far. I recommend this place if you re tired or tex-mex or the not so great tacos trucks.
Mi Tradición,236,Finally   Pan Dulce  and legit mexican food.
Mi Tradición,237,Why Mi Tradicion may be my new favorite Mexican bakery    1. Because the other two Mexican bakeries I know about are closed.  2.  Okay  I ve been down to La Mexicana on South 1st  but it s a little outside my path.   3. Because I enjoy hearing   It s bigger than I thought.   4. Because everything here looks cool  colorful  and I have no idea what anything is.  5. Because it s cheap.  6. Because they also have tortas  tacos  and every kind of soda bottled in Mexico.  7. Because I m pretty sure your grandmother would love this place  if your grandmother loves Mexican bakeries.  8  Because they sell Nestl  Chocolate Abuelita in wedges  powder   amp  syrup.   9. Because a nice employee filled the Bolillo bin with freshly made Bolillos  and two guys promptly stacked all of them on their trays  amp  cashed out  and the nice employee waited until they left the building and then returned with more Bolillos.  10. Because the delightful Ashley S and I expected the center filling of our Danish-type thing to be all cream cheesy-like  but it turned out to be a sweet  amp  yummy custard-type thing. Pleasant surprises can be the best surprises  especially when you re doing the cheap in a Mexican bakery. Mi Tradicion offers a lot of pleasant surprises.
Mi Tradición,238,I was about to give this one 4 stars  then I thought of all those mornings I wake up  walk outside and have to remind myself to go to the gym and not the bakery.  I love everything about this place.  I love that the things are cheap.  I love that I m usually the only white person in there and the clerks are always thrilled when I speak espanol to them.  I love that it s open weird hours  often times till 9 pm.   I love the churros.  I love getting a tray and tongs and picking what I want  like it s a great produce section.  I love the churros.
Mi Tradición,239,The first time I went to this place  a friend had showed me his tacos  and showed where he got them on Google maps  and that s that. He didn t tell me anything else about the place.  So I found it without problem  walked in  and found there s baked things everywhere. Where are the tacos   I like baked things fine  don t get me wrong  but what am I supposed to do with these  just pick them up and start eating them  And where are the tacos   After a few moments of trying to look cool and act like I knew what I was doing  I figured out what was going on. There are metal trays near the entrance  and tongs for picking things up and putting them on the metal tray. You then take your tray to the checkout where they tally you up. Once I got it  it was so sensible  and eco-friendly   that I couldn t see why any bakery would do it any other way.   But ... where are the tacos    I know a little Spanish  so was able to identify and select a single Kolache and brought it to the checkout. They were only labeled  colaches  so I didn t know if they had anything good in them  but I was in luck because the one I got was jalape o sausage cheese  which is my favorite kind.  And at the checkout I was as polite as possible  and grateful for my  later found to be delicious  kolache  pero ...  Donde est n los tacos   Finally I discovered that the tacos are in the restaurant  on the other side of the business from the bakery. Unlike a mullet  which is business-in-front  party-in-back  it was more like a butt cut  with business on one side  and business on the other side. And in the middle  CAKE  Don t ask me what part of the haircut is represented by the cake... but they do have some fancy cakes and flans and ... delicious-looking fruity gelatin flan things under glass. I didn t taste any of these  but they looked tremendously good.  But yeah  I found the deli and ordered a set of al pastor tacos.  The al pastor meat came off a kebab as Al Pastor should  except I noticed the kebabs weren t spinning  nor was the heater on them operating. They just sliced the pastor meat off the kebab and grilled it before putting on the taco. Better than many good places do for al pastor  dipping it out of a container next to the beans  for example  but pretty far down the path of authenticity.  The tacos were served in a rectangular-shaped styrofoam container  three right next to each other and slightly overlapping. The meat was succulent and seasoned with fruit. The tortillas were basic corn tortillas  not bad but not earth-shattering  especially from a paner a. In all a wonderful and recommendable taco  and a fun first-time lunch experience.   And yes  if you re keeping track I did have a hefty kolache and three tacos al pastor for lunch. He who has never enjoyed a gratuitious taco can cast the first stone. 
Mi Tradición,240,A huge authentic Mexican bakery in North Austin   Expect to see me waddle myself in and out of here weekly to load up on sweets and tacos   The rundown   As you enter the doors you will see cash registers immediately in front of you.  To the right is the sit down dining area where you can eat all of the delicious tacos and tortas that they cook to order.  Beside the cash registers is the refrigerated pastries such as flan and tres leches.  And then to the left is the main attraction  tons of cabinets and bins of baked goods.  Just pick up a metal tray and tongs and go to town selecting the breads that you want.  Pricing is super cheap so you can load the entire tray for under  10 and have a weeks worth of bread.  The majority of the baked goods are not labelled so do your research before you come if you are not familiar with the types of breads offered.  From what I have seen this place is always doing a ton of business so I don t think they have any problems with product going stale.  The service is amazing here.  The fact that the cashiers speak fluent English is a huge bonus for a gringo like myself   certainly not the case in most authentic Mexican bakeries I have been to.  Getting right into the foods   Tacos al Pastor  dried chile marinated pork with pineapple  cilantro  chopped onion  and fresh lime juice  -  This dish is taco perfection.  I love that they give you a choice of corn or flour tortillas.  So many taco places only carry corn tortillas and I am just personally not a fan.  These come with two sauces  a green and a red one.  Be careful with the red one  it is fiery death.  I love the green sauce though  still has a kick but not nearly as hot.  Pan Dulce  sweet bread  - They have several brightly colored conchas here  sweet paste drawn in a shell pattern on top .  These are essentially a dessert bread because the dough has a ton of sugar and butter resulting in an extremely soft texture.  Do not skip these   Bolillos  essentially like a French dinner roll  - They bake these right on the floor of the oven which gives the outer crust a super thick and crunchy texture.  Don t be fooled however  the inside is the most delectable light bread you can imagine.  If you luck out on your visit and get these fresh out of the oven it is an unbelievable taste.  Canastas  small pastry baskets  - I got a strawberry one which was a little disappointing.  It was a bit too dry for me and the strawberry jam was pretty bland.  Mini cookies - Again these are super dry which some people may like but I am not a fan.  They have strawberry and lemon topped ones.  Empanadas  stuffed pie dough  -  Their empanadas are ok bread wise but again the filling that I tried  strawberry was very bland.  I would probably go elsewhere for your empanada fix.  Puffed Pie Pastry - No idea on the spanish name for this but they are awesome.  I have tried their Tinga one and their Chicharron one.  Both were awesome  the tinga one was slightly better but both had tons of spices.  There are a few other meat flavors.  Jalapeno Cheese Sausage Kolache - Kelly S is right  this is the best kolache in Austin.  The breading is perfect and the sausage is so flavorful.  Oreja  ear shaped puff pastry  - Their orejas definitely have the distinctive crispy light flakey puff pastry type texture.  They are not overly sweet though and only have a light glaze on them.  They are a little too dry for me personally but they are still good.  Churros  fried dough with cinnamon sprinkled on top  - They only have one kind here.  I have had a lot better churros elsewhere but theirs is decent.  Donuts - They nailed the perfectly light  not overly sugared dough that I prefer for my donuts.  This is the closest I have come to a Tim Hortons donut in the US.  It has that same distinctive blend of sugary topping with a less sweet but puffy cake bread.  Tres Leches  cake soaked in three milks  evaporated  condensed  and heavy cream  - A slice is  2.99 so a bit more than most of the breads which are under 50 cents typically but it is totally worth it.  I have only tried the cappuccino flavored one which had a notable coffee taste that was not overpowering.  Tuxedo Cake - Nice cake with chocolate and vanilla mousse type layors and a hard chocolate shell.
Mi Tradición,241,The first time I tried to find this place  it didn t happen. I was denied deliciousness by my own impatience and stupidity.   When I finally found this place  it s because I was waiting for delicious rotisserie chicken from across the street at El Regio. Come to think of it  it makes perfect sense for your taste buds. The best rotisserie chicken with the best green sauce on one side  and then some delicious pastries on the other side of the street.  On my second visit  I was headed to Houston and wanted a breakfast taco and a snack for the road. For some reason  they couldn t make me a breakfast taco  but they could make me a breakfast torta. Daddy must have been looking out for me from Heaven because this breakfast torta was the bomb  It had everything on it  Eggs  chorizo  beans  avocado  lettuce  tomatoes ... and difficult to fit in my mouth  Very messy to try and eat while driving  and it was so big I couldn t finish the whole thing.  Their pasteles are so good. Pan dulce translates to sweet bread  definitely not offal   and that s mostly what Mexican pastries are like. There are some that are covered with icing or stuffed with jellies  but most are just sweet breads. And they are DELICIOUS  This place takes me back to my childhood when my dad would take me to the Panaderias in Houston and let me put different cookies and empanadas on my own big metal plate  carefully maneuvering the tongs so I didn t drop anything.   If you have the chance  take it. If you re not in the area and appreciate delicious Mexican pastries  make the drive. Seriously  Austin is small.
Mi Tradición,242,I went here to grab my mom some Mexican Pastries for mothers day. We are from San Antonio and it s rare that a Mexican restaurant wows us here in Austin. This bakery has a ton of variety. Everything looks so yummy. And everything WAS yummy. The staff was friendly. It s clean and welcoming. Will definitely be back.
Mi Tradición,243,I never quite understand what I am ordering  but it s always tasty whatever it is.  The Tortas are always great and they are huge. You can feed a family of four with less than  20 in your pocket. That alone makes this place impressive.   On the bakery side of things... it smells amazing.  The cupcakes are awesome and they have a huge variety of sweet treats.   Between the lunch and the bakery  I would be shocked if anyone on Earth could visit this place and not find at least one thing they liked.
Mi Tradición,244,When my good friend Tim M.    who has a  talent for understatement I will never let trick me again  first mentioned this place  I figured it would be a good substitute for IHOP for my first breakfast in Austin.  I went mostly because I was curious about what the heck a  breakfast taco  could be. But I was still halfway across the parking lot to this place when the smell hit me  and I could hear my stomach yelling  RUN  GET THE FOOD  FASTER    Every baked good you could desire is found within this Aladdin s cafe of deliciousness  and except for the bread loaves  everything is pretty much under a buck. Danishes  cookies  croissants  donuts for the unimaginative  muffins and empanadas  something divine and covered in coconut I ve never seen before but which translates into a  Strawberry Kiss  from the Spanish  and soft  buttery rolls. I love the self serve feature of a platter and tongs  and by the time I got done deliberating and actually selected a handful of pastries to try  this place kept delivering. Over stuffed sandwiches  tasty breakfast tacos  good strong coffee  light sweet flavored waters which almost make you forget the sun is trying to set your skin on fire   I HIGHLY recommend the melon   and even ice cream    If I had one of these within walking distance to my house  I would never buy groceries   I d eat every meal here and turn my fridge into shoe storage. I did subtract one star because I don t live in Austin and as someone who doesn t regularly need Spanish  it was a little tough to place my order. But we managed and I really like the layout of the place. It s small  and I can t recommend it highly enough.
Mi Tradición,245,There is nothing NOT to love about Chuy bakery. When you walk in it is like you stepped into heaven... it smells amazing and can almost be overwhelmed by all the great choices. There are cases filled with fresh  pan dulce  cookies  empanadas  cake slices and kolaches on one side of the counters and tables for hot food orders on the other side.   Everything I have gotten   which is a lot  has been AMAZING. If you are there for the bakery  grab a tray and some tongs and don t forget the bolillos  which are incredibly fresh and tasty. If you are there for a more substantial meal  the tortas are to die for and in the mornings they also have awesome breakfast tacos until 10 a.m.  The staff is super friendly and helpful  whom I think  embarrassingly enough  has started to recognize me as I go in there too often  than my waistline would appreciate . The tables are plentiful and clean and the restaurant side is really nicely laid out and decorated. Price also will not disappoint you. My boyfriend and I usually find ourselves with a meal in our tummies and a FEW  bags of bread and sweets to take home for under  20.  If you don t think that is a great deal  I don t know what is.
Mi Tradición,246,This place is pretty great for those dining on a budget. They have every typical sweet that Mexican bakeries are known for plus donuts and kolaches  I haven t tried them but I really want to get around to them at some point.  There s a bakery side and a restaurant side. The bakery side is serve yourself where you grab a sheet pan  some tongs  and put everything you want on the pan. They ll ring you up at the register and also allow you to make special requests for things in the cases. I will warn you  my main dislike towards Mexican sweets is that they are almost ALWAYS too dry. This bothers me as a food purist because when sometime looks good you don t want to bite into it only to get the mouth feel of sawdust. Most of the time  this has been my experience with their pan dulce. My lil sister says that she eats it with a glass of milk so that she dip the bread into the milk and then eat it  oreo style. Either way  the only thing I like to dunk are cookies and oreos so I suppose that s my fault. The churros are also often times dry. My fault for that as well too probably. Who orders churros that aren t fresh    They also sell cakes  cheesecakes  and ice cream. The ice cream gets to looking a little old after a while so I would caution against ordering it later on into the week. It bothers me also because they are displaying it  Italian  style with the gelato case but it s ice cream  not  gelato. It s much denser and harder to handle hence why their displays look so mangled and beaten because they have to work so hard at digging it out. Also  probably because they have the temperature in the case too high. But whatever  it does in a jiffy.   The other side of the restaurant sells meals such as tortas  tacos  and various other things. I love their tortas. They ve very big  very filling  and pretty cheap. It s great for when you re feeling like saving a few bucks. I got the diablo and it was awesome. Pretty much a heart attack on a platter but nothing sets you right like egg  greasy breakfast meat  and crunchy fresh baked bread. Good service. They sometimes don t speak English but I suppose that adds charm to the place. They also have a lot of aguas fresca. Horchata anyone  Mmm  one of my faves.   Recommended  It  s very clean and well organized.
Mi Tradición,247,We had Bistec Tacos  Spicy Pork Tacos  the Alambres Platter  and a Torta Al Pastor. Everything we ate was superb  Service was prompt  courteous and friendly. The see-through kitchen fills me with confidence. This is definitely going on my rotation.
Mi Tradición,248,Love.  Fricano s get their multi-grain bread here  and probably their other bread too...but I m not positive .  For some reason I ve had a hard time finding excellent sandwich bread in Austin and I m SO HAPPY to finally know the secret that amazing places like Fricano s knows.  This place rocks and is so cheap-  3 for a loaf of artisan bread.  It s kinda hard to find  it s at the end of the shopping center with Big Lots and it s around the corner near Arby s.  The outdoor sign just says  Panaderia Bakery. 
Mi Tradición,249,It is really beneficial to speak Spanish or have someone with you that does if you visit this place. I do not speak Spanish but luckily my hubby does   Menu is spanish  The food was delicious and so was the sweet bread that we took home  big colorful soft and filled with strawberry jam and shaped like a big donut  everything was good   Seating is very limited and it seems to be busy all the time. Long lines in the bakery side but the lines move very quickly.
Mi Tradición,250,This bakery was the life of a pretty dead shopping center that included FAMSA  a US Post Office or mailing place  and Sea Dragon restaurant.  It is tucked away on the east end  facing Ohlen Rd instead of 183  but the parking lot was packed on that end.  The only reason I stopped to check it out was because seeing so many cars there made me curious.  You can smell the sweet smell of pastries in the parking lot.  There were a lot of people inside in line  picking out pastries  or sitting at tables eating on a Saturday evening around 6 pm.  It was so lively.    There was an area of Mexican pastries  American stuff like doughnuts  bolillos  tacos  and ice cream.  They also had piles of warm bags of corn tortillas which looked really tempting.  There was a refrigerated case of drinks like milk.  The pastries were really cheap  starting from  0.55.    I like how you serve yourself by using tongs to remove the pastries from the display cases and placing them on a big metal tray.    It s the nicest Mexican bakery I ve ever seen  not that I ve seen many .  I ll definitely take visitors to this panaderia.  The only downside to this bakery is that sometimes people in the parking lot try to sell you stuff.
Mi Tradición,251,So. Many. Choices. I didn t even make it to the hot food side  just the bakery. Everything I got was fresh and delicious though. Knowing some Spanish helps  as the bakery food labels are all in Spanish without much description. It s all pretty cheap though  so trying something your not 100  sure on is pretty risk free.
Mi Tradición,252,This place has some of the best Mexican food I have ever had   the customer service is not all that.  But the food and bread make up for the lack of service.n
Mi Tradición,253,I d like to add an extra star to my previous 5-star review but apparently yelp won t give me that option.  On my last trip  they had fresh donuts  a wide selection of aguas frescas  melon  horchata  pinapple and watermelon that day   and VOLOVANES     I don t know if volovanes are unique to the Gulf Coast of Mexico or just the state of Veracruz  but they rock my face and tummy every time  flaky puff pastry enveloping a tasty filling of ham  amp  cheese  tuna  or picadillo... sounds simple  but is oh so good.  These weren t by the other goodies  though  but were hidden just above the case where the cakes and desserts are held and were a wonderful surprise just as I was getting ready to pay.  Yet another gem from the best bakery in town 
Mi Tradición,254,The bakery is filled with sweet sites and sounds of fresh bread  cookies  pastries  kolaches  and what-not.  They have a nice gelato counter  and reasonable coffee.  A variety of wonderful gelatin-based deserts makes it hard to choose.   On a recent Sunday morning  eh... around noon  actually  the place was bustling with activity  kids running around  families picking up sweets on their way after church.  Nevertheless  the wait was short  the staff was cheerful and helpful  and there was enough baked goodness to go around.
Mi Tradición,255,They have amazing smells coming out of this place every day.   The torta bread  the kind with the ripples on top  not the other kind  is fantastic  and I make my own tortas at home with it.   What else  you ask  The gelato bar  the mexico city-style tortas  the breakfast tacos  the tres leches  Not enough  Now they have aguas frescas  to cool you off in these summer months.   Really  though  the reason my roomie keeps stopping by is that he s addicted to their churros. And I can see why. Holy moly.   What bumps it up to 5 stars for me is the one time I had no cash and tried to buy a couple loaves of torta bread with my card. Instead of charging me  .85 on a card  the lady  who I think was the owner  just said   You can pay next time.  Wow. That s a neighborhood feel if I ve ever gotten one.
Mi Tradición,256,Incredible  such great flavors   I had the shredded chicken and pastor  both great but the chicken was out of this world 
Mi Tradición,257,Delicious  affordable  fast. I had a Hawaiian torta that was sweet  savory and picante. Definitely check it out.
Mi Tradición,258,Everything that my husband and I have tried has been excellent  especially the concha bread  tres leches cake  and the quesadillas are to die for  Definitely coming back soon to keep trying everything in the menu. Real Mexican flavor is a plus 
Mi Tradición,259,The hot churros  guava empenada  order of pastor tacos and a torta cubana cured the hangovers right up for the wife and me.
Mi Tradición,260,I can t say much for the sweets but I will stand by their amazing breads. I have been searching for the best baguette in Austin. I can t say that I have found it but this place comes pretty darn close  crusty outside  chewy inside.   And it s cheap and cheerful 
Mi Tradición,261,You will love the food  it s some of the best Mexican food I ve had  but the service is not the best.  Items missing from orders and not so friendly employees are common here.
Mi Tradición,262,Love at first bite     Cubana Torta- wow - I love this  You must try the tortas. Enough for two people.  Plato submarino- mixture of severals meats  chorizo  ham  etc   cheese served with tortillas  corn or flour  and fresh lime.    Tacos Pastor- yum  the fresh pineapple with the cilantro  you can t go wrong with this choice.    Quesadilla Picadillo - blue corn tortilla- we had picadillo as a filling and cheese. Quite tasty.   If you have room left there is gelato or the many options from the busy bakery. I ve been to the bakery but this week was the first time since they started serving food...so I ve now been three times in four days 
Mi Tradición,263,I love the food from here  Always like coming here.   Me encanta la comida de aqu    Siempre me gusta comer aqui.
Mi Tradición,264,The Diabla Torta is the best hangover remedy I know of. So tasty  It s like menudo for people that can t stand tripe. The bakery is excellent as well. Tacos are pretty good too  odd but cool that they serve them with raddish slices. Def something I haven t seen before. Quality service and clean interior are a plus as well  I like that the hand washing area  is outside of the bathroom as well  shouldn t have to get a whiff of Tex-Mex dumps just to wash the grease off your hands 
Mi Tradición,265,Okay folks  I ve got a little secret that I m going to share with you all. The bakery has this cool automatic coffee and cappuccino machine that also makes Abuelita hot chocolate. The cool thing is they make a drink out of that machine called a Mokalita  It s half Clasico coffee and half Abuelita hot chocolate. For less than 2.00 you can get a 12 oz cup of a great coffee   sugar fix. Ask for a large cup of ice and pour your hot beverage into the ice cup and you have a slamming iced coffee drink for the half the price of what you d pay elsewhere  It s a very unique flavor that is quite addicting 
Mi Tradición,266,We ve been to Mi Tradicion twice now and it has not disappointed  It is tidy and clean and everything we ve tried there was delicious. Our favorites on the bakery side so far are the Mexican cookies and the panaderias. It blows La Mexicana on South First out of the water 
Mi Tradición,267,When Mi Victoria closed  my heart was broken. I didn t know where I would get my pan dulce and tacos. I stumbled upon Mi Tradicion late one night. I made a mental note to check it out. I m so glad I did. I grew up in the RGV so Sunday mornings meant pan dulce and barbacoa. While I couldn t get my barbacoa fix  I was able to load up on all my favorite pan dulce treats. I think my eyes and my heart grew three sizes when I walked in. The hubs and I loaded up our tray with various sweets and got two orders of tacos de bistec for less than  20. I almost cried. I was so happy. It was like being at home. I can t wait to go back and try their cakes. Forget brunch  I ll be spending my late Sunday mornings right here with a panza full of pan dulces and tacos.
Mi Tradición,268,This place was very good and had authentic flavors. I am from Mexico but some of these dishes were something I haven t heard of. I just picked blindly and I wasn t disappointed. On the bakery side everything looked delicious and fresh. I didn t have enough room for desert because I had too much good food. I ll definitely come back here when I visit.
Mi Tradición,269,Crazy fresh Mexican bakery.  Cheap too. The sweet potato empanada is the best I ve had since I moved here.  The pineapple is great too.  The savory chicken and potato is mild in flavor and simple but really good.  Friendly service  late hours and fresh carbs.
Mi Tradición,270,Best Mexican bakery I have been to in this city. Had the Cubana torta and it was perfectly done  milanesa was crispy and not chewy and all the toppings were fresh. The bread was toasted for the right crisp but not dry. Will be coming here regularly now 
Mi Tradición,271,This place is AH-MA-ZING    The food is cheap and delicious. I love their empanadas and kolaches   2 each  and they re really filling. Their tres leches cake are to die for. I got the cappuccino tres leches and the consistency is perfect  not too mushy and not too crumbly. And the cr me on the cake was heaven  it had the consistency of buttercream but tasted like whipped cream  which I love. I m not a big fan of buttercream. Overall  I absolutely love this place.
Mi Tradición,272,I had their tacos al pastor and tacos al bistec...it was amazing  One of the best tacos I ve had in Austin  The horchata had a gritty texture  so it wasn t one of my favorites  but tacos were amazing 
Mi Tradición,273,Had the Tortas and the Huaraches  the Al pastor was spicey and sweet like pineapple food is amazing  Aguas Fresca s  bakery who can ask for more. This will be my go to spot for my Mexican fix. NUYORICAN OUT    
Mi Tradición,274,Chuy Bakery is sort of hard to see. Going north on 183  you cannot see it  as it is on the east side. Going south  you cannot see it  as it is tucked off on the southside of the shopping center. When you do make it to this enormous facility  your work will be rewarded.  First off  pricing is outrageous. Second off  there is a ridiculous amount of variety. Third off  you can special order cakes and the like. And I am certain that they would do a fine job.  I will just give a very brief survey of my experience. Please correct any wrong names  or feel free to add the ACTUAL names  assuming you can determine what I ate. Think of this as some sort of  blind yelping.  I enjoyed the moist texture of the tres leches raisin cake. The raisin scone boasted a very crumbly  crunchy exterior.  The more well-known options  The sandy cookie was buttery  crumbly  and not too sweet. Just very well crafted. The muffin was moist  but it was lacking the crust that I so desperately desire in my breakfast good.  Conclusion  CHEAP   2.50 for roughly 1200 calories in carbohydrates and fats protein  Go with their meat-laden taco offerings. I urge you  as a brother of yours in Yelp  get here. Use the tongs  and pick up a bunch of sweets.
Mi Tradición,275,Worst restaraunt ive ever been bad service bad cleaning ISABELE THE MANAGER WS RUDE       
Mi Tradición,276,This place is great. You know the food is good when the parkinglot is full of cars coming and going on a thursday night one hour before closing time.  The bread is delish. All kinds of real pan dulce. I could not help but to get some bolillos which are 3 for a dollar and are freshly made all day long.  The staff is nice and will even check for you how much longer before the next batch of your fave bread is out of the oven.  They sell artisan bread and they can slice it for you. The aroma of the bread was so great that I ate one slice as soon as I jumped in my car.  But bread is not the only thing they sell at this wonderful place. They have all kinds of treats too. Flan  cakes  ready made and in individual sizes to sarisfy a craving    gelato  lattes  espresso  gelatines  chocolate confections  aguas frescas  natural fruit flavored drinks  and other stuff that I can t remember because I m so excited about writing this review.  In the pantry section you can find  mexican chocolate drink mix  juice pouches  instant coffee  and all kinds of sodas.  Alas  that is not all my snack hungry friend   Chuy s bakery has a restaurant inside. You can buy tacos al pastor or taco plates with funky names like  el ping ino  as well as fat tortas  and tlacoyos and picaditas. This place is a dream for any mexa missing a taste of home.  Everything is so clean and you can tell the employees are proud to show that in their clean white uniforms. You can also see how the bread and your dinner is prepared through the large glass windows.  And the ultra plus on this place  The spotless large restrooms.  Yup. I like it.   Why only 4 stars  Well. I would prefer a wider variety of salsas. That s all.
Mi Tradición,277,I was craving a churro at 9 PM one night. Believe it or not  there are not a lot of places to get churros late at night in Austin  but thanks to a Yelp search I found Chuy Bakery  and oh man was I glad I found it.  This is a hardcore Mexican style bakery. You walk in and grab a tray and tongs then fill up your tray with whatever goodness you want. I have tried almost everything  and have never been disappointed. I would avoid the more traditional western desserts like cookies and cupcakes  and stick with the Mexican treats. I always get a pumpkin empanada  my wife loves their pan dulce  and they have great churros rellenos  yes churros stuffed with dulce de leche. They also have these little things called butter kisses  or beso de mantequilla that are great when you get a fresh one.   They have great sandwiches  or tortas as they call them. I am partial to the Cubano myself  but they are all pretty good. The also have great fresh bread  so be sure to pick some up when you go.   They recently expanded  so there is plenty of room to sit down and enjoy your food which is nice.
Mi Tradición,278,I had read great reviews of this place and decided to go to the Research Blvd location yesterday to get a King Cake  Rosca de Reyes  for a Three Kings Day party. The cake was terribly dry and stale  and none of our guests ate more than a couple of bites.  It was really embarassing. The cake was at least a day old when the bakery sold it to me and maybe even older. I would never go here again.
Mi Tradición,279,Totally rad. The bakery is awesome. Cheap delicious baked goods plus the tacos aren t bad either.
Mi Tradición,280,This place is great-  a totally different menu than the standard Chuy s fare that so many Austenite s and tourists like when they come in to town.  The tortas are large and filled with ingredients - the tacos are excellent - and for an interesting touch - order the chicken and potatoe quesadilla.   Something out of the ordinary    topped with cheese cream sauce.     I had went to this place last year with my girlfriend for gelato on the bakery side  and that was excellent as well.   This was my first time eating on the restaurant side and it more than met my expectations.  I highly recommend.
Mi Tradición,281,This place is awesome     Huge bakery plus they serve the best agua frescas  amp  pastor tacos   Can get pretty busy at peak lunch  amp  dinner times and everything is in Spanish but it s worth the wait 
Mi Tradición,282,If you want to taste ACTUAL Mexican food  head to Chuy s post haste  The tacos are amazing  and they have a small selection of aguas done to perfection. Their sauces are also amazing. What you will experience will save you a trip to Mexico. Absolutely amazing and nostalgic for me.  On the bakery side  I am forbidden from it by my diet   you will basically see the best examples of what you would see in a Mexican bakery  plus kolaches and more local fare.   The ice cream looks incredible  but again I mustn t touch.  This may be my favorite Mexican restaurant in town.   And don t use Yelp reviews to tout your ignorance. How about you ask someone what the words mean and get your act together  The whole world can t cater to your stupidity.
Mi Tradición,283,We had tacos al pastor and a torta de bistec. They were both fantastic  Tacos were so good  I had to get another order of three  The orchata was on point too  And the prices are unbeatable.
Mi Tradición,284,I m visiting town and came here with my sister to get some bread  the first thing we saw was a roach on the trays to put the bread in     We left immediately  I m never coming back to this place 
Mi Tradición,285,If you like Mexican sweet bread and  food I highly recommend this restaurant. Tacos and Tortas need I say more   
Mi Tradición,286,Really good place. Food was delicious although the steak was a little on the cheap side. The bread was fresh. It was hot and soft. They make it there and the fries also fresh. The bakery is great although some items are missing the description. For people who aren t Mexican and want to know what each item is or contains it s difficult. Other than that food was fast and great.
Mi Tradición,287,When we first moved to Austin  our very helpful neighbors insisted we check this place out and it was a revelation   Speaking Spanish is definitely a plus here but people are very friendly and helpful so don t be scared off.  The baked good are amazing and CHEAP   I ve walked out with 2 or 3 big bags full of stuff for less than  20.  The breads are spectacular and from what I ve been told  they provide bread for many local Italian restaurants.  My only complaint is that they don t always have ciabatta.  It s definitely worth having lunch  or as my Cuban relatives would say  el lonche  ai dios mio escandalo    The torta s are great though  first timers are a little taken by surprise at the inclusion of hot dogs in there.  I took a friend of mine there for lunch once who had decided to go carb free for a month - why she agreed to go boggles my mind - and once she stopped screaming  get thee in front of me Satan and order me a torta with the works along with some agua fresca    everything was A-OK 
Mi Tradición,288,This place is Amazing if your a bread lover. The bakery is amazing with a huge selection and great pricing.   Grab tongs and a plate and go to town.  Easily the best sausage kolaches in town so dont forget one.
Mi Tradición,289,I enjoy Chuy s. I consider them fast Mexican food. But they don t treat as such and you can tell by the quality. I LOVE their tacos al pastor and the quesadillas are made out of purple corn tortillas  The  pan  is freshly baked and superbly yummy. No wonder us Latinos tend to have curvier figures... we eat these pastries for breakfast and snacks     Unfortunately  they have no kid menu so it s hard for me to feed my very picky eater without having to take a lot of stuff out for him to finally eat it. Then again  I should start teaching this kid to eat like a Mexicano  right     All in all  Chuy s is a healthy  fresh option as opposed to hitting up Taco Bell. Go in and take in the smells and food 
Mi Tradición,290,Mi tradici n is quickly becoming my tradition.  This is a very casual cafe that is part bakery  part cafe.  The baked goods are excellent and inexpensive  and the food in the restaurant is delicious.  I was directed here by friends from Mexico City  and so that should say everything you need to know.  The tortas  Mexican sandwiches  are huge  with exceptional bread  as you d hope from a bakery .  I d recommend the Cubano torta. The tacos are also very good.  And lots of Mexican sodas.  This spot serves a primarily Spanish-speaking clientele - so all menus are in Spanish.  For those who do not speak Spanish but love adventure  like me   this is great opportunity to discover new things.  For those who are uncomfortable trying to decipher a menu  the staff here is very helpful and will give recommendations.  They also have their specials out on plates  and so you can just point to one of those and try something new.   My wife s strategy.   So  don t be intimidated - just jump in.  If you want  Mexican  food made for Gringos Gringas - there are other places which will meet your needs.  If you want Mexican food made for La Raza - this will be your new tradition.
Mi Tradición,291,I love panaderias.  Chuy s makes some good pan dulce.  I loved most of what I tried.  Nice light lemon flavors  pumpkin flavors  moist cakes  FILLED churros  hmm... what is that caramel creme like stuff in the middle  .    That said  I avoid their polvorones  they were pretty dry   and I was extremely disappointed with their campechanas...  Oddly  HEB used to make really good ones in my area  but stopped.   They taste like someone just baked rectangular layers of plain filo dough and coated them with a light glaze - no other ingredients.  I m used to them being round  and heavy laden with syrup amp cinnamon baked into it..  Anyone know where I can get THOSE campechanas 
Mi Tradición,292,Packed with all sorts of Mexican and gringo bread and sweet treats  this place is pretty fantastic and fun. The bakery is on site  so you can hear and smell all the breads being made. There s also sandwiches available which all looked good.  It was busy the afternoon we tried it out and the staff forgot about the espresso I d ordered. Thought I had to stand in line again to remind them  the resulting drink was OK. Nothing fantastic  but cheap and good.
Mi Tradición,293,Managed to end up here with a friend the other night. I have no honest idea what I ate. All I know is it was delicious. I let her order for me  and it was the biggest  bestest  greatest  superest sammich ever. I didn t even dare walk into the bakery side of the place for fear of wanting a little bit of everything. It helped that I couldn t even eat all of the sandwich by myself. I got about half way in and felt like less of a woman when I realized there was no way I d finish it.   Also  the cantaloupe drink is really good and if you haven t tried it you should 
Mi Tradición,294,Pretty good Mexican Bakery  The bread is fresh and tasty and the employees are pretty nice. One half of the place is dedicated to the bakery and the other side is the restaurant.  You can order the traditional Mexican food dishes and drink traditional aguas frescas. Convenient location and they open at 6am in case you want to grab tacos to go.
Mi Tradición,295,A good basic family Mexican bakery
Mi Tradición,296,Definitely one of the best Mexican food I ve had in Austin. Prices are pretty cheap too   it s only like 3.99 for three delicious  albeit tiny  tacos. That and a quesadilla will fill you up nicely.
Mi Tradición,297,Mouth-watering goodness from the pan dulce  postres  gelato and fresh-baked bread to their agua frescas  tacos and tortas.   Their tacos el pastor were cheap and delicious  loaded with all the right fixings - cilantro  onions  pineapple and two types of salsa. I think it was something like 3 for  4.   The torta Napolitana  Milanesa  jamon  queso  wasn t the best I ve had  but it was pretty good. The milanesa was tender  though not completely flavorful. A lot of the flavor came from the ample avocado  lettuce  tomatoes  onions on their own fresh torta bread  which is pretty big .   As always  the pan dulce was fresh and moist  not at all dry the way it can sometimes get when sitting inside display cases all day.  Our one-year old was even picking sugar and bread crumbs from the ledge of the display case   That is not the case here since they always have such high turnover. The place is always filled with families - children and adults alike excited to get their sweet fill.
Mi Tradición,298,O.M.GAWD. The heavenly smell that smacks you in the face is worth the visit alone    Nothing makes me more happy than to enjoy my childhood favorite pan dulce  the maranito. A little fluffy gingerbread piggy and some coffee is all this guy needs. I cannot visit a panaderia without buying maranitos and they are always the first thing to go. The maranito here was the right consistency  not really a cake  but not really a cookie  and very flavorful. I m not big on pointing out  authentic  Mexican restaurants to my friends  in fact  I hate when I m asked . But I have to say this place brings back childhood memories...and that s pretty authentic if you ask me.
Mi Tradición,299,This  rating is based for our last time at this place... we used to go very often because the food is very good  tacos  tortas  whatever u had was good... even invite our family when they came out of town to visit us  truly Mexican traditional food  our dissapointment came after at least 5 years of coming here.... one time January this year we went with our parents we were having dinner... and ordar tortas and quesadillas  we were in the middle of our meal... when my mom was going to give her second bite on the torta and it had a roach there... we hesitated at first but nooo it was a roach... imagine our faces.... we almost  throw up... we called an employee then the manager  on duty came and offer us to refund the meal... they only refund the torta.... I don t know it was so bad  .... we really liked this place but never ever....
Mi Tradición,300,With a hefty appetite and low    I ordered a few tostada-like items. Every single thing I tasted was delicious. Whatever you order  I m certain it ll satisfy the buds.
Mi Tradición,301,Wow - what a place. This place is cleaner and less divey than a typical hole in the wall but still has that unpretentious feeling that tells you that they are focused primarily on the food.   Super fantastic bakery and the food was priced right and tastes great -- nice touch is watching them in the window cooking.   We will be back to try other dishes.
Mi Tradición,302,First time here and we all loved it so much  I need to get another batch of pan dulce again tonight  Thank goodness they re open late for a bakery  I don t know what someone said about  lack of English  for this place  there were descriptions in English and the cashier was bilingual. They were helpful with understanding my Spanish since I am not fluent  but I do try. We got orders of al pastor tacos and tacos de carnitas. They were a bit small  but it was fine by us for lunch time. We drank aguas frescas  and it was delicious. There was plenty of pan dulce  kolaches  muffins  bags of bolillos  which we also bought and the bread was fab . The only drawback I saw was there were a lot of customers eating at tables  so we squeezed into a smaller space. But that was no biggie. Will definitely return to try other menu options 
Mi Tradición,303,Great local bakery and traditional Mexican eatery  affordable prices  The tortas are great  In the bakery  the conchas are slso amazing  Downside is that the food is a bit on the heavy side 
Mi Tradición,304,I love this place. Great food. Fresh bread. Great prices. Wish it were closer to my house.
Mi Tradición,305,Possibly the best Mexican food in Austin. Not hipster style gourmet Mexican or Tex Mex  but Mexican. Not California Mexican good  but this was still a great find. I really like the Panaderia on site as well  always stacked with Mexican sweet bread. My wife loved the chicken tostadas and I had something with nopales  Tocayo or something like that --that had some good taste   Sometimes they mess up your order a bit  but they always recover well. Not surprised that this area  which is overlooked  has a great spot like this.
Mi Tradición,306,I spent several years of my childhood in Laredo  TX where just around the corner from my grandmother s house on San Dario Ave was a family owned panaderia. Walking into Mi Tradicion at the recommendation of my brother a few years ago brought back all sorts of great memories as the smell of freshly baked pan dulce greeted me right at the door. If you are new to Mexican bakeries  this place will overwhelm you with brighly colored pan dulces  cookies and cakes.  Don t be afraid. Go grab one of the stacked metal trays and a pair of tongs. Begin by walking around the bakery and observing all of the sweets inside the bakery cases along the perimeter of the room.  You ll see various conchas  polvorones  empanadas  orejas  churros and marranitos. They even have Kolaches and donuts. The Marranitos are molasses or gingerbread based sweet bread baked in the form of a little pig.  The empanadas de camote or de calabaza are excellent. It s not important to know the names of these items  but I always ask the friendly staff there for correct pronounciations as I attempt to reclaim the Spanish that I ve forgotten over the years. The other side of the business is a restaurant which I ve yet to try that sells tortas  tacos and more.  I ve always wanted to grab lunch there  but the lure of the panaderia is captivates me first.
Mi Tradición,307,I have only been in twice because I am not always in that area. I bought some bread there last year that was so amazing. It was incredibly fresh and warm  although once I got it home it got hard very quickly. I guess one of the dangers of real bread is that it doesn t last three lifetimes. lol  So what I am saying is go get get some of their bread  but eat it there or within a day.  Not sure why they are calling it Mi Tradicion here. The sign is for Chuy s Panaderia  if I am not mistaken. 
Mi Tradición,308,This place is awesome   Great  great traditional mexican food   The torta s are spot on and the tacos are also great   Its a little pricey for mexican food but thats mostly due to the fact that they make all the bread and the tortillas there in house and then its served with what you order   Everything is really fresh  just the way it should be   Definitely worth the visit   Be sure to take some pastries home with you for later  trust me if you don t you will be craving them like crazy for days 
Mi Tradición,309,I can t believe I ve been in Austin for this long and have not been here. I ll be going back very soon 
Mi Tradición,310,Sweet Jesus It s been a long time since i have had to take a step back and belt out a unclejessie  LORD HAVE MERCY   but this place is sacred. I wouldn t be surprised nuns come here to worship the  mounds of yeasty sainthood that frolick from behind these glass doors.  -Fresh squeezed OJ -Nice agua fresca  sometimes too sweet  but hey  pour water in it and you have twice as much agua fresca   -O.G. mexican patries that my grandmother would vouch for   and she has been known to yell profanities in spanish at small indigenous mexican women in grocery stores for not being on their game   something along the lines of  go back to the mountains where you came from   mean I know  but you let a four foot eight 89 year old mexican woman do pretty much damn well what she pleases -TORTAS  OH THE TORTAS  For those of you who havent bathed in the cleansing waters of the the tortariver  a torta is like a cross between a mexican hamburger and a mexican sub sanwich on fresh baked bread  with beans  cheese  avacado  lettuce  tomatoes  jalapenos  mayo   and a bevy of meats. NOT FOR THE SQUEEMISH. IT IS HUGE  thats what she said .  The torta cubana is a beast. It will be the death of me. It had all of the above plus a breaded fried veal cutlet  mounds of thanksgiving style ham  cooked deli ham  and 3 hotdogs. It rocked my world and made me not eat for 18 hours. At  6 it could feed 3 people.   Things are CHEAP. Like Sri Lankan orphanchild labor sweatshop cheap. If you spend  10 here you will eat for a week.   The pastries are all handmade  with care. Chuy used to be Mandola s exclusive pastry maker before he was like  wait a minute  Mandola s is tasying a lot like the olive garden these days   Anyways take your 4 8  89 year old mexican grandma there to stock up on sweet pastries she can feed to her friends while they play canasta and the ones they don t finish  you can take back to your hippy friends  house so they can hulk out on cream cheese filled bright red strawberry jam cocunut rolled pastries while they cross knives on the stove  and listen to JerryBand rock the Fillmore in  73 and play a mean ass cover of  it takes a lot to laugh it takes a train to cry  and then ask you to take care of their dog for a few days while they go back to Oregon to  hit up the summer festies 
Mi Tradición,311,Best Pastor I have EVER had.  No joke    I also expected this to be a run down joint but it is incredibly nice inside  great service  friendly staff  and no tipping   All this though is just a plus on top of......... the BEST Pastor I have EVER had.  No joke 
Mi Tradición,312,My husband loves this place for the Pan Dulce and empanadas  I very much enjoy the churros. This panaderia is simple  fresh and efficient.
Mi Tradición,313,I m from Houston  so I am use to having an amazing Panderia on every corner. For 10 years  I searched all of Austin to find the best panderia in the neighborhood. I would go to X panderia after hearing how amazing it was and I would pick up a few polvor ns. I would take the first bite  letting the bread crumble in my mouth  and I would be instantly disappointed.  After so many disappointments  I had given up on finding an amazing panderia in Austin until my friend told me about this place. I was skeptical  especially after having my heartbroken so many times. However  I felt that I need to give it one more try. I am so glad I did. The second I ate a polvor n  I was in heaven. I continued to the empanadas  conchas  and orejas. All of them were amazing. I finally found my panderia.
Mi Tradición,314,If you like Mexican sweet bread aka pan dulce this is your place   Made fresh every day and they stay open late  They also have other great breads for gourmet sandwiches and pastas... They have many more great things  to many to write.
Mi Tradición,315,I would consider Chuy Bakery a combination of Panaderia   Bread shop   and a Pasteleria  fine bakery . The family and I have visited 3 times since they opened  we happened  to notice them  across the street from The Great Pollo Regio.  The Bakery is clean  well organized and everything we have tried has been fresh  which can be an issue at Mexican Bakeries. They do not have one or two types of dough they use as a foundation and just make variations of baked items from that. This is what you find at some Mexican Bakeries or some donut shops  same donut but dressed up differently.  Mexican bakery goods are not as sugary as American Bakery goods but the  fancy  cakes  behind the enclosed counter   were just as sweet. I do prefer the more traditional Conchas  Galletas  Churros  and the Empanadas which are not sugary. Though the Cookies could be crispier. The simple cakes  along the self service walls   were surprisingly moist  not dry like at some other bakeries. The kids loved the cakes with strawberry icing and sprinkles  not too sweet and very moist. The small rolls or  Bolillos  and  Teleras  are very good but I wish  Bolillos  were firmer on the outside. The   Teleras  which are used to make  Tortas    sandwiches   are hard to find in Central Texas. If you are hungry  for   6 you can get a Cuban Torta piled on with Black Beans  Ham  Salchichas   hot dog    Milanesa   breaded steak    tomatoes  onions  lettuce  and Jalapenos- it was very good  They make their own gelatos. They were a great treat  we loved the   Guayaba   Guava  and Mango but heck all the Gelatos we tasted were great.  Hopefully the bakery will establish a loyal and consistent customer base  which is very important for this line of business.  Every time we have visited  they have been fairly busy but not overwhelming.   I wish they would  focus strictly on the bake items and Gelatos  which are unique to the area.
Mi Tradición,316,If I could give this zero stars I would. This place has the WORST customer service Ive ever experienced. The restaurant was busy so I was ready to wait for my to-go order. After 15min I started to get annoyed As some people who were after me getting there food.I ordered one Torta. Finally after 25min I approached the worker at the counter and asked what was up with the order  she told me   Tortas take longer to make and people were in front of you   I said it takes 25min to make a sandwich  And pointed to 3 couples who were AFTER me and told her they had ordered the same thing. The owner or manager  older lady with glasses  simply gave me a dirty look and again said they had been busy and again I explained to her that people after me had gotten their order and she was unapologetic and walked away without saying anything else 
Mi Tradición,317,When I go here  and if I close my eyes and breathe in through my nose  I am right back standing next to my grandmother as a child. We lived in San Antonio and she would take me to this great Panaderilla called La Poblanita. This Bakery reminds me of home.
Mi Tradición,318,Best conchas I ve ever had. Churro was really good  too. Love the gelato selection  and the espresso wasn t bad either.
Mi Tradición,319,Just as wonderful as the south location.  The tortas good.  Their bread selection gooood.  Their cakes Ok.  The staff quick friendly.  Their bolillos mah goodness  I remember days of just a bolillo with some butter and dulce de Leche.  Hmmmm Mmmmk good   
Mi Tradición,320,For interior Mexican food  no Tex-Mex food    this is one of the best places. There are several authentic options that allows you to taste some of the most traditional food. I personally like the Torta de Milanesa with Pineapple or the Alambre with Corn Tortillas both of the incredible. Of course  you cannot leave without paying a visit to the bakery and bringing some very good Mexican bread back home 
Mi Tradición,321,If there were a million star option  I would give that rating to Panaderia Chuy. I go here often  way more often than I should.  I can see it from my house. When I mow the lawn I can smell the bread and sweets baking. The churros are divine  the bolillos are 3 for   1  they make sweet potato empanadas  and there s this strawberry cream cheese coconut swirly-thing that is heaven on earth.
Mi Tradición,322,A really fun bakery with great food and pleasant service 
Mi Tradición,323,walk in and inhale deeply through your nose.  that s what a real Mexican bakery should smell like.  the tortas are also really good.  i got a torta  and several baked goods and the total was  12.  ridiculous.  they also have gelato which i ll probably try next time.  the customer service i got was great.  very good English was spoken in my experience.  besides  it s usually a good sign if they DON T speak english.    someone here complained about them using lard...   it s a Mexican bakery   i d be disappointed if they didn t use lard   if you want a lame American knockoff go to central market or something...
Mi Tradición,324,Very cheap but very delicious Mexican bakery.  I like this place. There are many different kinds of Mexican bread and cakes. However  almost always  you have to wait very long. Each time I was there I had to wait for five minutes or more.  this place is so popular that it seems like people are willing to wait around-the-clock  whether early afternoon or late evening. One star deducted because of the long line.
Mi Tradición,325,Pan Pan Pan  amp  Chicken   Go here for the bakery   One of the best and for sure the best in North Austin.  Too many delicious pastries to choose from and the ambience takes you to Puebla.  Their coffee isn t the best but good enough to dip if you are a dipper.   Oh and Chicken   I m talking about the amazing smell of Chicken you get from across the street from Regios.  It has nothing to do with Chuy s Bakery or does it   Because it adds to my experience   
Mi Tradición,326,The pastor in this little gem is by far the best I ve ever eaten. Enchilada steak tacos are delicious as well. Had some pineapple with orange fruit water and it was right on point. Fresh bread and tortillas used on the tacos and tortas. Very clean establishment and great service. Been twice now and still have not tried the pan dulce but if it tastes as good as it smells when you walk in  I can only imagine how amazing it is  This is definitely our go to spot for some authentic Mexican food.
Mi Tradición,327,If you don t go here for tortas  empanadas  and pan dulce  you are a dang fool. They have some tasty business going on down here. Seriously  if there s a better torta for the money  I have yet to partake
Mi Tradición,328,What a find.i recieved a coupon for a birthday basket of pastries from mi tradicion and decided to pick it up and also eat  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fhere.so amp s 5854f309cc744a6a41d7b6ff16a07b57a6c6e14c9fd7e00667fe378d5ca607ab  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  here.so  a  glad i did.the pastries look wonderful and furtive nibbling on a few confims they taste good too.we had a ham and egg torta which was filling enough for both of us split in half.since the prices are so reasonable we splurged on fresh q Squeezedorange juice and horchatas..deliciosa.nive ambience very clean mouthwatering smells from the bakery...a new regualr place for us.
Mi Tradición,329,Loved this place   Have been only once and have had only one thing  but no hesitation in 5-star rating.  Very clean  nicely appointed and welcoming restaurant with attached bakery. Got the Cuban Torta and it was delicious.  Didn t really fit the mold of what I had pictured as a  Cuban   and I honestly thought they served me an incorrect order  guess I was assuming ham  pork  mustard and pickles  but no  it was just an interesting take on the Cuban.  Difficult to describe - main meat layer was like a very thin breaded cut of some type of beef steak  very similar in looks  taste and texture to a very thin chicken fried steak   underlying a layer of very tasty grilled hot dog slices  yep  sounds weird  but it worked  and topped with cheese  jalepenos  avocado slices  lettuce and tomato.  The Torta bread was so good it probably wouldn t have made much difference what they stuck inside. My only objection - if you care to call it that - was that sandwich was way too big  and I ended up being able to eat only half.  First world problems  right   A nice nearby homeless lady was a happy and grateful recipient of the other half.... though I noticed she too was puzzled by its appearance    The pastries and breads in the bakery section all looked really good  and I look forward to trying something from there next time. This place is a gem in an unexpected location.  A little tricky to find - it s behind and to the left of the main strip of stores  but definitely worth a try 
Mi Tradición,330,This place was good.  I got the Beef Torta and it was very tasty and fresh off the grill.  I enjoyed that it was also a bakery and we got to get some tasty pastries to take home. My husband had a taco and he seemed to enjoy it.  I apologize this is not the best review I ve done.  It was long ago but I will say we did find it to be a place we would come back to definitely.
Mi Tradición,331,tortas  tortas  tortas  very delicious and most important huge... i have been eating soup all day due to sickness  ok I have a cold . Come on soup gets lame after eating it all day  besides i made homemade horchata and i was not going  to drink it with chicken soup. Aside from the torta named torta chilanga that is huge and shared it with the hubby  i purchased fresh outta the oven bread and some kolaches  and let me tell you    yummm yummm yum  even my baby had some kolache  and he was crying for more. this bakery rocks   They serve authentic baked goods  and their food   the only one that i ve tried is tortas so far  is delicious. I m probably going to hit this place up consequently. by the way they have rosca de reyes  Kings bread  and i hope is good too.
Mi Tradición,332,I used to love this place.  I ate here saturday night  the weekend of ACL.  I had a ticket for ACL sunday.  I was unable to go due to the FOOD POISONING that I received at Chuy.  I had the Chicken Potato quesadilla and was up all night sick.  I am so disappointed in this place.  There is a trust you place in the restaurants you buy food from.  It is a sad thing when that trust is betrayed. Never again  CHUY 
Mi Tradición,333,This is my new favorite place in all of Austin.  Super awesome  authentic  Mexican baked goods.  Churros  donuts  flan... and an authentic restaurant.  Fresh  steaming hot bread comes out of the oven on a regular basis.  Yum 
Mi Tradición,334,I m only reviewing the cafe  not the bakery.  I had a torta and my dining partner had a steak taco plate.  Neither of the dishes was really all that great.  There were no vegetables in the torta  just meat and bread . I was told you had to request veggies. Whatever.  It s counter service and very indifferent. You are much better off going to Aranda s or one of the other many tacquerias in town.
Mi Tradición,335,I first saw Chuy s when I was shopping at the Target across the street. I had been meaning to try it for ages when my friend suggested we stop by there for breakfast one day. I ve been going about once a week ever since. The prices are fantastic and almost everything tastes amazing. I ve had the mushroom quesadilla and the chicken and potato quesadilla. The mushroom is definitely my favorite. They make fresh-squeezed orange juice in the cafe  and it s a great addition to any breakfast.  I always grab about three pastries from the bakery each time I eat there. I like to sample something new every time. The croissants are probably the best I ve ever eaten. They are so soft and flaky and the center is filled with a rich buttery taste. Some of the pastries can be a little hit or miss. I recall one that was triangle shaped with what looked like vanilla pudding. Alas  the bread was very dry  and the filling tasted like an awful chemical margarine product.    The best thing that I ve tried from Chuy s is the Tuxedo Cake. I nearly died when I tasted it. It s the perfect combination of chocolate and vanilla.  I usually get sick of cake after a few bites  but I just kept wanting more after I ate this one. This is the best cake I ve ever had and that includes wedding cake  I think it was  3.50 for a decent sized slice. My friend and I also bought a tulip-shaped chocolate confection with mousse in the center and split that later. This was great as well.   I highly recommend checking this place out. They have plenty of sweet things and savory things. I think it s easy to find something for everyone here 
Mi Tradición,336,Wow.....all I can say is wow. I love Mexican bakeries  so I m not sure why it took me so long to find this place. I had a Cuban sandwich and it was probably the best one I ve had since visiting South Miami. It s also very reasonably priced considering the amount of food you get. Restaurant on one side and bakery on the other. Both are amazing. The cheese danish is really more like custard than traditional cream cheese. Either way  it was really good. For only 75 cents each  they really are a bargain. I ll definitely be back time and again. Can t wait to try their pastor tacos. I can see this going up to 5 stars on my next review  but have a hard time giving 5 stars to a place after only 1 visit.
Mi Tradición,337,Excellent  Been here a number of times for lunch. Cheap authentic Mexican sandwiches and tacos. Plus a tasty bakery section. Service is quick and plus there are a few options for good dessert if you are interested.
Mi Tradición,338,I went here after reading all the great reviews on yelp but was disappointed  go across the street for a better burrito or grilled chicken.
Mi Tradición,339,I went to a party where they got the cake from here and it was awful  When I got to the party  there was a guy trying to fix the icing because apparently they botched it. Well he had a different color blue than was already on the cake. And when I was served a piece of cake  it was extremely dry and had no taste. It was like biting into Styrofoam. The piece I got had strawberries but those tasted bitter. I m not sure what happened with this cake but I will never order from here.
Mi Tradición,340,I loved everything about this place. The smells  taste and the cultural. I tried items from the bakery side  including empanada con tinga  empanada guayaba  and pan dulce. I can t wait to go back and try some of the homemade icecream and items from the restaurant side. Even on a busy Sunday morning there was plenty of product and room to sit and enjoy.
Mi Tradición,341,Badass place  I ve been looking for a panaderia in Austin that comes close to those found in Juarez San Eli El Paso  and this is it my friends. Tortas  tacos  bolios  pan dulce...I ll take it all  Only thing stopping me from going every weekend are the extra lbs I ll pack on and a 20 min drive to get there.
Mi Tradición,342,new favorite place  i discovered this place trying to take a new route to work and getting lost. for so long i had been searching for a good panaderia  and decrying austin s seeming lack of them. well search no longer  mis amigos. i know my pan dulce  and this place has more than i ve ever seen - kinds i ve never even heard of  and they are all  mostly  delicious.   i ordered a birthday cake from here that was also amazing - the tuxedo cake. it was a bit pricey compared to the pan dulce  amp  other foods  but worth every dollar. it s like a mousse-cake combo. soooo good. so good it caused  a family fight.  and then  to top everything off  i finally tried the tacos  amp  tortas on the other side of the bakery and they are just as good as the sweet stuff. great green  amp  red salsa  amazingly fresh and authentic aguas frescas  and the AL PASTOR. holy shit. this is the best pastor i ve ever had. and you can get it in so many ways - in tacos  tortas  tostadas  huaraches  etc    amp  all for very cheap.  do yourself a favor and get to chuys bakery. it s some of the best mexican food  amp  sweets austin offers.
Mi Tradición,343,Every time I enter Chuy s the angels sing. With my platter and tongs I instantly become a kid in a candy shop. Just typing about Chuy s has me thinking I should stop typing and get back there in time for some warm hard rolls. Good thing they take credit cards 
Mi Tradición,344,This is the best panaderia in Austin  I love conchas and the ones from Chuy s are so soft  I also love the cookies and other pan dulce. The store has lovely tiles and wooden cabinets for the pan dulce. They also serve food  everything is cheap and tastes great. I fell in love with the mushroom quesadilla. The Quesadilla is heavenly  the tortilla was crunchy and the insides were creamy and mushroom-y. UGH  just thinking about it is making my mouth water.
Mi Tradición,345,They have a clean establishment  friendly staff  delicious food and inexpensive prices   Recommended 
Mi Tradición,346,This is why I love Yelp  and Austin. You gotta check this place out.   This is the perfect place for breakfast when you have family in town. Just load up on empanadas and everything else  take it home to the family  and enjoy a taste of everything.   It s helpful if you know a little Spanish.
Mi Tradición,347,If you are looking for pan dulce and great Mexican food this it the place to be. My mom started to go since they open this location and I always wonder where does she gets this delicious pan dulce   Finally I asked mom and she told me. I couldn t believe it. It taste like real pan dulce from Mexico. Geez    I went with mom in one day and we decided to try their food. We were thinking it was going to be good as their pan dulce. And yes   I had me some torta and mom some guaraches. DELICIOUS I must say  This is the real necks  place to be    glad to have one here so closed by my house.
Mi Tradición,348,The best tacos al pastor I have ever had    I think they may be missing the boat by not calling out the amazing tacos  or maybe it s to be a best kept secret .  Definitely will be back soon 
Mi Tradición,349,I m a fan. Nothing fancy or pretentious  this place brings back good memories of the traditional fondas in Mexico. Their sweet bread is better than the one at Fiesta s and I had the Torta al Pastor which I would order again but their tlacoyos definitely hit the spot. Cheap  good food  good feeling. What else could I ask for 
Mi Tradición,350,Holy cow  this place is AMAZING   Everything from the delicious plethora of baked goods  also at an unbeatable price   from the mouth-watering tortas.  I ve been here quite a few times already  most recently this week.  I had the Napolitana torta  it s a must-try.  The torta sizes are pretty big as well  more than filling.
Mi Tradición,351,I love this place because you can buy 10 things and somehow it costs about  4. I d love to try some of the sandwiches  tortas   but I ve only had a couple of pastries so far. Good stuff and cheap.
Mi Tradición,352,Pretty decent place... crowded on a Sunday afternoon but the pastries looked smelled delicious and the workers are quick with ringing you up... fresh pastries and I think there is a restaurant on the other side - we only went to the bakery side of things.  Lots of people mean a high turnover which means a lot of fresh baked goodies... I like and will definintely return here again.... great stuff 
Mi Tradición,353,Very good Mexican bakery  amp  good tortas  tacos  amp  quesadillas.  The baked goods are always fresh and constantly replenished. I ve been there in the morning on a weekend and late afternoon on a weekday  quality is the same. They recently added seating area so you can eat the tacos and quesadillas right there. They were good  almost as good as the bakery but definitely worth trying.
Mi Tradición,354,Dang   Authentic mexican panaderia. Great prices. Friendly. Great choices. Love it  Reminded me of the panaderia my grandmother used to take me to in her barrio.
Mi Tradición,355,Food is always good  both the bakery and the restaurant. Wait isn t too but if you order at the restaurant  make sure you wait in front of the counter  otherwise they will forget about you by putting your orders aside and let it sit. If you get something from the bakery side  I would avoid going late during the day. I went once about an hour before they closed  got one of those pastry with meat in it. I guess it had been sitting there for long and the meat was spoiled. So I had a diarrhea as soon as I finished my food.
Mi Tradición,356,So after my experience today at Mi Tradicion  I thought I should share what happened. I have been a customer for 5 years and have brought both locals and out of towners to this establishment always raving about how good the food tastes. So today i wanted to pick up a birthday cake. The cake at the front of the fridge had a sticker that said made on Friday. I wanted a fresh one made today so I asked the lady for a fresh cake. There were now two girls working behind the counter trying to find a cake made today. One of the girls grabbed the cake made on Friday and ripped off the sticker as I was watching. She then says  here  this cake was made today  She lied right in my face as I saw the whole thing. As I am asking the lady to show me the sticker she just removed  the other lady comes by and says in Spanish  Tell her it s from today. Then a couple of other workers came over  one of whom apologized to me. I said she shouldn t be lying to your customers. She pretended like there was confusion  but there was no confusion.... She was trying to pull a fast one and she got caught. She completely took advantage and she should be fired. She is the face of the business and although I ended up buying the cake for the sake of time   I will never go back and I ll make sure everybody knows about this. It s such a shame because it s one of my favorite spots in Austin. Had to change my previous rating from FIVE stars to ONE.
Mi Tradición,357,This place is amazing.  The Torta Cubana was awesome.  I will be going back with the wife to sample the delicious looking baked goods.
Mi Tradición,358,Go for lunch for best sandwiches in Austin  served on freshly made rolls.  Go in the morning for the best croissants in Austin.  Or rolls with a great crunchy crust.  Very nice environment too.  I haven t tried the fancy pastries  but they look delicious.  If you don t know spanish  as I don t  you may have to order blind  but I ve never had anything I didn t like.
Mi Tradición,359,FRESHLY BAKED GOODS    Decent coffee and wonderful Tortas ...   Why four stars  you say   There isn t much for someone who does not eat meat.   I had an Egg Torta -- which was delicious ... but it was the only non-meat item available.  Still -- i will go back for more because the prices were great and who does not want to eat a sandwich made on freshly baked bread 
Mi Tradición,360,Great Mexican bakery   If you grew up in Texas you have probably been to a place similar to Chuy bakery and they don t disappoint on the classics.  I had the Cubano torta and a horchata.  I would recommend either items on your first visit.  The restaurant menu isn t expansive  but the flavors are on point.  If you are visiting for the baked goods or the hot food it will be light on your wallet and heavy on great flavors 
Mi Tradición,361,AWWWWWW.....found this place just as I was trying to start my diet  I love me some pastries....I really love me some authentic Mexican baked goods   Finally  finally found good bread in Austin  The fresh bolillo rolls...yum  The kolache was good  however being a Pole from Chicago...I still am mystified by this TX treat...kolackys are cookies from where I m  from .  Empanadas  the sweet  are yummy. My husband didn t go much for the savory ones...he prefers South American ...these are more reminiscent of croissant  but still pretty good and RICH none-the-less.   Can t wait to go back 
Mi Tradición,362,My workplace isn t far from here  and many workday mornings  this is where I get my breakfast. I m hooked on their guava empanadas  picadillo empanadas  and coconut macaroons. Their coffee is also excellent and always freshly-brewed. The staff is friendly and the whole store is a delight 
Mi Tradición,363,This place has the best pastries in austin. Everything is fantastic. I don t know what most of the stuff is  but it s all great. And cheap too. You can pick up a whole bag filled with goodies for the same price as coffee cake at starbucks. The selection is ridiculous and each thing is better than the last  and it s all made fresh and in house. Its great for breakfast in the morning or desert and coffee.
Mi Tradición,364,Everything about this place is DELICIOUS  The smells will amaze you  the food is wonderful  the place is spotless and I can t wait to order our next cake from the bakery    ENJOY 
Mi Tradición,365,I have one thing to say  OK  two things  1  the blue-corn quesadilla is the best thing I ve ever eaten  and 2  they have a bakery. Love this place.
Mi Tradición,366,A trip to Chuy Bakery is like a mini-vacation to Mexico. Everything is authentic from the decor to the food.  I love the Tortas  massive sandwiches on fresh bread with chorizo eggs  ham etc.   How many places you go to offer guava soda   The bakery is really great as well with all kinds of Mexican treats or Pan Dulce.  I love the mocha cream churros  how do they get that filling in there  
Mi Tradición,367,Cheap bread that I won t eat   They also have donuts and flan.  I didn t like the flan.
Mi Tradición,368,oh wow. why did i wait this long to make this a daily ritual  baked goods - awesome  especially their pink sugar cookies. also  their breakfast tacos are fantastic - especially the egg  bean and cheese. Great for those who live in the 183 Ohlen Burnet area
Mi Tradición,369,This may be our new favorite place  at least for breakfast tacos. Living in this part of town isn t always wonderful  but being so close to this place makes it a little better. We stopped by there on Saturday morning around 11 and after the cashier consulted one of the kitchen guys regarding whether they were still serving them  we ordered two bacon  egg  and cheese tacos to go and grabbed a jalapeno cheese sausage kolache and a dulce de leche filled churro. Total came to  5.50 and I was stuffed after splitting these few things with my fiancee. The tacos were huge and absolutely delicious and the salsas that came with them were tasty as well. The churro and kolache were also wonderful. The dining room area is brand new  very nicely decorated  and looks like a great atmosphere to dine-in. I want to try everything in this place  especially the cappuccino tres leches slice I saw in the cake case for  2.99. I heard the cashier say that one of the beautiful full size cakes in the case was  17  which sounds like a good deal to me. The staff is friendly  though the cashier s English was a little shaky so placing the order took a few extra moments to be sure we were understanding each other. Can t wait to go back for more 
Mi Tradición,370,I love this place   I love the tortas  I love the pastries  I love the bread  I even love the psychedelic flowers set in gelatin.  They have also made two wedding cakes for me  well  not for me-I was catering for friends  weddings  two birthday cakes and I even had Chuy make a croquembouche for me which have all been awesome   I have a hard time getting anyone in town make a croquembouche.  Cake prices are very reasonable. Love 
Mi Tradición,371,We ordered a cake for a sweet 16 and the whole cake crashed to the floor. They said they would put it themselves because if we put it we would put it on wrong. Within the next hour that they left it fell. Not very good service at all.
Mi Tradición,372,Not impressed at all. The muffins I bought were dry and had almost no chocolate chips in them. I don t think I ll ever go back there.
Mi Tradición,373,wow...fell in love...you go in grab a tray and help yourself to a huge variety of pastries and bread and cakes and cookies and soo much more..cases filled with endless sweets and deliciousness... go for the CHURROS.... came back here twice for it...soft crunchy warm and filled with an amazing filling.... and the pocket that is filled with cheese...taste like a crunchy cheese danish.... everything was good..the tres leches cake was amazing...
Mi Tradición,374,ARTISAN BREADS    I m not all that fond of a lot of Mexican bakery. Much of it is not very delicate. However  I have been looking for a bakery that makes good bread. AND THIS IS IT  Even Whole Foods at Gateway now wraps all it s  artisan  breads in plastic  removing all of the crispness of the crust. It also alows the store to keep the bread longer if it doesn t sell. And HEB-- all their breads are now in plastic.  And what did the lady say when asked why all the bread has to be in plastic   Because the flies get on the bread  sir   she said  OMG. But Chuy s Panaderia has the best crusty  high quality bread in town. No platstic wrapping. It s just as crisp as when it comes out of the oven.  Hard to find  but once you ve found it  you ll keep coming back. The prices are great.
Mi Tradición,375,Their chocolate chip muffins are fantastic. Went there twice in the same day for breakfast and lunch because I was so impressed  Their tacos were great too  Got way too much breakfast for 4 and it was only  10  Amazing 
Mi Tradición,376,my friend has gone here 5 days in a row  various times  breakfast  lunch  dinner  and has had an amazing time
Mi Tradición,377,While the service left a lot to be desired  this place has great food and amazing breads and desserts. When my sister suggested it I was thrilled about the idea of breads and desserts but I was concerned about the idea of authentic Mexican food. The closest thing we have where I m at in Colorado is Taco Bell. I had the pollo con papas quesadilla and some of the tuxedo cake. Both were fantastic  However I m not sure what exactly was on top of the quesadilla. Might have been just sour cream but there was a bit of a different flavor to it and there was some kind of cheese sprinkled on it too. If anyone knows and can tell me that would be awesome. I m going to attempt to recreate it here at home.  Again  awesome food
Mi Tradición,378,Mexico City style street tacos.  Great Al Pastor tacos.  Sopes.  Huaraches.  Excellent food.  3-4 different sauces and salsas - spicy    Their bakery inside takes the cake - excellent home baked breads  pastries  etc. to go with the Nescafe style coffee.  Couldn t recommend more 
Mi Tradición,379,Do yourself a favor and go get a torta here asap. So good. The bakery items are delicious  I don t really know what half of it is  but I haven t picked too much out of the cases I didn t like. I have to keep myself from going to this place too often or else I ll have to be wheeled in and out.
Mi Tradición,380,Would give it s 3 stars for their varied selection and efficient service. The bakery products didnt taste that great though.  There was a constant stream of people coming and going so I am sure its popular with a lot of folks..
Mi Tradición,381,Bakery reminds me of Mexico.  EXCELLENT horchata.   It s a beverage... My friend says it tastes like  liquid rice pudding.   She s spot on.  I ate the torta al pastor...  Whoever thought of putting pineapple and avocado on a pork sandwich is a friggin genius.
Mi Tradición,382,A co-worker told me about this bakery so my husband and I tried it out. Wow  I am not a big bread pastry eater but this place is great. My husband loves this kind of pastry and he fell in love with this place. The Churro is delicious and we are customers for life now. I recommend anyone who loves mexican pastry to stop by  you will not be disappointed.
Curra's Grill,1,I have been going to Curra s for breakfast since 2015.  I am not local but stop by when I am in Austin. There is a lot of overrated breakfast tacos and Tex-Mex in Austin and I was a bit hesitant seeing some of these negative reviews.     I was there twice this past weekend and it was fantastic. Yes  the service can be a bit slow  you may have to ask for something twice  and it may take some time for food and drink if they are busy. It is worth the wait. Bloody mary and the migas plate with chorizo and spicy salsa is exactly what I want when I come to Austin. Very well balanced  good heat and delicious. Ali Mays plate and Huevos Con Chorizo were also enjoyed by our table. Everyone was very happy with our food.   This is not a large operation and they are working hard to serve a their version of an authentic homemade Mexican breakfast. A little patience will help you enjoy it more. Cannot speak to lunch and dinner  but my experience with Curra s breakfast has been nothing but outstanding.
Curra's Grill,2,There s a game the wife and I have been playing for two decades. The premise is simple  let s find a place to eat lunch during a holiday. Eventually  a solid set of suspects became standard  we had Hill s Cafe  Shady Grove  La Feria  El Gallo  Katz s and The Tavern. All but the last one are now gone  and the latter self-eliminated due to an un-admirably steadfast commitment to comically bad service.   Enter a new  but actually old  candidate  Curras Grill. Back in the day this was the place for the famous avocado margaritas  I know  weird but good actually . We actually hadn t been since 2007 and here we were on Labor Day  looking for an open place...  And we found a new holiday standard bearer...  The menu is impressive but that s half the battle. You can list cochinita pibil  carnitas and puerco con chile Colorado all you want but it s all vaporware if you don t execute.  While a purist might not like their cochinita pibil  it was not only well textured but also a solid advertisement for their moles. While I appreciated it  I get some may not.  Wife got the carnitas and it was good  while a little busy. The charro beans were on point and the kiddos quesadillas pretty solid considering it s just cheese and a tortilla.   All in all  a solid four stars. Great tortillas  good drinks  excellent service when you know they d also prefer to be off like the rest of us.  Definitely recommend.
Curra's Grill,3,Have to say I m really disappointed in the service at Curras grill but hopefully this will get their attention to improve things going forward. I ordered food online last month to pick up along with a margarita. When I came to pick up my order I noticed they didn t give me the margarita I paid for. Ok no big deal so I ended up calling them back to let them know and asked if they could refund me the money back.   About two weeks go by and still nothing on my end. So I decided to call back again and see what was going on. This time I get the manager Jorge on the phone and re explained the whole situation not to mention I gave him the transaction number  the date it took place  my credit card info literally everything you would need. He tells me he s going to take care of it  Well after a month that goes by I still haven t received the funds I m owed and what makes it worse is that I was pretty much blatantly lied to during the whole situation.   I thought their food was good but after dealing with this type of service and staff as well as this place stealing from me I will never come back here. I d be careful to watch your transactions with this place so you don t have to go through the same experience I had to.
Curra's Grill,4,Guys. 5 stars. Always. Since I moved here in 23 years ago. Still today. Order  Nachos Yucatecos for lunch. Cochinita Pibil for dinner. Or anything mole. For breakfast  ahhhhhh... breakfast. Order your fav breakfast taco ingredients but make SURE to ask for red corn tortillas. Come on. Trust me. And a Oaxacan . Curra s is one of my top 3 spots in Austin for a meal less than  50. Getcha some 
Curra's Grill,5,I had the best relleno in a long time - their Cancun Relleno.  It s a cute place with terrific murals all over the walls  including  gasp  St. Ed s over the door  and an outdoor patio.  Our service was excellent  warm and fun - thank you Tony.  Or as you expressed  NeetToe   Made me laugh and made me remember your name.  Plus  you had just returned from holiday and your happiness is infectious.   For those who have complained about the service  maybe it was  trying to find workers  related.  I hear it s tough to get folks.   Whoever decided to use Tajin as the  salt  on a margarita s rim is a genius.  I can t speak to what my friend ordered  but he was equally happy.  I m looking forward to dropping in again.
Curra's Grill,6,Very good and the waitress was great. My daughter had the cheese enchiladas and she enjoyed it. I had the ceviche and I also had the avocado margarita and tried the Wendy watermelon and they were both pretty good too. We will go back. The price was expensive for just us two but it was nice not to do the dishes for a night.
Curra's Grill,7,Had a fabulous time Halloween night at Curra s  We ve been coming here for over 20 years and it s better than ever. All 5 meals were delicious and ya can t beat their loaded queso and ceviche apps  Excellent service and the bartender was so cool and accommodated  my weird cocktail substitutions due to allergies.
Curra's Grill,8,I stumbled on this underated latin  Mex cuisine spot decades ago. The original owner has passed unfortunately but  the restaurant remains almost the same. The food is unexpectedly good and service prompt.  You won t find your typical straight up Tex Mex. There is a mixture of interior Mexican with other latin American influences. After decades of meals I don t think I ve ever been disappointed.  I ll be back and you should  Go 
Curra's Grill,9,Worst service  I ve been coming here for 30 years. When I went to St. Ed s I came here weekly. I just moved back to Austin and wanted to get breakfast mid morning with only 3 other tables in the restaurant. The waiter was chatting up the table next to me then he disappeared. No water  no coffee  nada  The bus person cleared the table next to mine and the table the waiter was chatting up. After 15 minutes and no service I left. I saw the waiter behind the bar talking to the other servers. Nobody said a word to me. I m very disappointed.
Curra's Grill,10,These folks racist.   I promise you that.   I came in after taking the bar exam  so I had a very long day. When we sat down  the energy from server was immediately off. After ordering our food   which took a while cause she didn t really come by the table that often   the food looked awful.  After I tried to change it  you could tell she wasn t trying to be accommodating   and then she went to the owner  and as I walked by to go outside to clear my head  her and the owner looked at me like I was the most disgusting thing they had ever seen.   After I walked back inside  the owner tried to get my attention  but at that point I didn t wanna talk  so I told her I was good  and kept walking.  The server then came to our table and told us we had to pay for our food and leave.  Literally kicking us out    I will never come back  and I suggest you don t Either.   This place deserves 0 stars but I unfortunately can t do that.   After finally ordering
Curra's Grill,11,We had been told about this place for quite some time and are so glad we finally came  The gentleman at the door was so welcoming and kind and it was such a nice touch to have the bar right inside the door so you could enjoy one of their famous avocado margaritas while you waited for your seat   verdict  it was pretty good    The enchiladas were incredible  the service even better  the salsa  the guacamole  the drinks  we cannot wait to go back. Really great Mexican food  amp  not the same old same old. I overheard someone saying his father is a mole sauce snob and says this place has one of the best  so if that s your thing you better make that jump     See you there 
Curra's Grill,12,Earlier we had the most unaccommodating waitress. Our house margarita was very watered down and the only fix she could offer us was to purchase an over priced top shelf margarita. We were a party of 8. She was completely uninterested in splitting the check. Her unfriendliness ruined the meal for us.
Curra's Grill,13,Man  how the mighty have fallen. My family has been taking me to Curra s since I was in diapers and I have loved every bite of food I have eaten here  and have made so many memories here  which only makes this review so much harder to write. I have been a business owner  and I know how hard it is right now to work in the service industry  but it s in the name  service.  The first problem was  we ordered a round of happy hour drinks and they were way more watered down than usual. When we pointed out that the drinks weren t of the usual quality she basically scoffed at us  and when we ordered a different drink she brought us the wrong one. And every time we needed water we had to take extra measures to get her attention just for water refills. When we were ready to order  she came by and asked if we needed anything and then before we could ever answer she had moved on to another table  this happened multiple times. And when we were ready for the check she refused to refused to split it  and only let us pay with four cards and made us all manually calculate our portion of the Bill  I d totally get it if it had been a policy all along but as early as a month ago they split the check any way we wanted and they still had the same point of sale systems so there s no practical reason why we wouldn t be allowed to split it. Our experience left us wondering what we did to upset her  and We felt incredibly unwelcome at a restaurant that we have spent so many evenings enjoying. It was nice while it lasted..
Curra's Grill,14,Everything our server suggested was delish and she was just right helpful not in your face. Hubby had the cucumber marg with chili lime garnish. The veggie enchiladas were very good. Multi choice of sauces take your pick I had the chicken tamales..What a bonus to be able to have really good tamales during summer. The black bean pico salad was just right. Annoying to have to pay for just okay chips and salsa. Shouldn t those come with  Outdoor patio absolutely not beautiful but fans going for good  ventilation and shades so iit wasn t too hot.
Curra's Grill,15,A lot of people recommended me this place  So I tried it with some friends who used to go there. We didn t have a good experience. First we were outside and we got the fan and the mist all over our table and our faces. We asked the waiter to turn the mist off  but he told us he couldn t to do it. It was Weird because some other fans were on without mist. My friend asked for an avocado cocktail. She was disappointed because it was a smaller glass than usual. We ordered tacos al pastor  and again we were disappointed because they were very dry and not very tasty.  That s why I just put 2 stars.
Curra's Grill,16,Straight fuego     Don t sleep on this gem. You foolish is you go anywhere else.  Just foolish.
Curra's Grill,17,Been coming to Curras since they opened. It is a family affair and the food is great. My kids grew up eating at Curras. The flan is the absolute best  we compare all other flans with Curras flan
Curra's Grill,18,I order Oaxaca coffee beans from time to time  and it usually takes about a week to get to me... I live on the east coast.  My last order seemed to just be stuck and nothing was happening.  I sent a couple of emails to get a status  but didn t hear back from them.  I tried to call  but nobody picked up or returned my call when I left a message.  I was just seeing when I could expect to get the order.  I suppose they re really busy... maybe  and that s why nobody is getting back to me  and still don t have my order  It s been weeks now...
Curra's Grill,19,Everything was incredible. Wish I took pictures. Tried the avocado marg  all the reviews are correct it s delicious and similar to a smoothie but you can taste the booze. Had the Award Winning Vegetarian Enchiladas with borracho sauce  side of rice  and side of fideo soup  and it was all so DELICIOUS. Couldn t recommend it more.
Curra's Grill,20,Our go-to tex mex spot in Austin. The service is great and we always have really attentive waiters who are happy to offer recommendations. Highly recommend the prickly pear margs 
Curra's Grill,21,I was looking forward to the food here but was a bit disappointed unfortunately in my 2 visits here.   I ordered the cochinita pibil and was expecting some flavorful food but ended up with a dish that was underwhelming and lacking flavor. The pork was decently tender but the dish was bland.   I did like the chips and salsa here  Their drinks were pretty good too.   They have an online ordering system too which is cool 
Curra's Grill,22,Atmosphere  was great  food was fantastic but the star of the night was our lovely server Patricia. Very pleasant and attentive  she really made our night   
Curra's Grill,23,I got the avocado margarita and prickly pear margarita. The avocado one intrigued me since I ve never seen that variety before. It kinda tasted more like a smoothie than a margarita  but not bad. Others in my group tried the mango margarita and blackberry margarita. All margaritas were delicious. My friend ordered a queso dish she thought was a dip but it came with tortillas instead of chips. Wouldn t recommend that but my friend probably read the description wrong.
Curra's Grill,24,I ve been to Curra s Grill a few times in the past and decided it was time to write a review. Having ordered several different things on their extensive menu  I ve found my favs for which I m writing this review.   I almost always order Chile con queso. I figure if someone can make a good cheese dip  then most likely everything else will be tasty. It may sound funny  but it is a gauge I ve used in the past and has held thus far.   So on my last visit  I ordered their queso and chips along with a side of salsa. A   on this starter  Nothing bad at all to say about this dish. I can honestly say that Curra s queso easily stacks up against any place in Austin with this on their menu.   On to the main entre  the Enchiladas Curras Plate - filled with Monterey Jack cheese and smothered with Carne Guisada. These enchiladas look like the inside was on the outside  sort of deconstructed versus standard enchiladas. That aside  the  Enchiladas Curras Plate  is by far one of the best Mexican dishes I ve ever  devoured   The flavors were outstanding and exploded in my mouth. Very mild in the heat factor and delicious in every other detail.   Finishing off the evening  I ordered Curra s legendary Tres Leches. It is a cake soaked in a mix of three different kinds of milk  hence the name . Their version is topped with whipped cream and has the perfect moist to wet ratio. The  Tres Leches  is a large enough portion to share with someone else  however  I was stingy and finished it all by myself.
Curra's Grill,25,I come here for the nachos and the Avo marg. The latter is just seriously good. Every time I ve come here and ordered one of their entrees  e.g. Cochinita Pibil   it s been sort of a hit or miss with regard to how the food tastes. Sometimes the beans and rice are shockingly bland. The meat is sometimes underwhelming lacking in richness. In any case  something keeps bringing me back. Maybe Curra s is a one trick pony.
Curra's Grill,26,Best MX food in Austin.  Reasons    salsa    red corn tortillas   margs   outdoor seating    dog friendly patio   funky south austin vibe   mole   portion sizes    parking   Oaxaca coffee   staff
Curra's Grill,27,I came here for the flies and music...Curra s did not disappoint. The fauna is something out of a storybook. The hatch of flies was quite friendly and enjoyed our drinks and queso  just as we did.  Now  the music. Top notch. There is nothing better than listening to a 3rd rate  Mexican hair band blaring from the speakers while your trying to eat a breakfast taco at 11am. At one point  I swear I heard a Mexican Metallica cover of Enter the Sandman. I wasn t mad.  Duerme con un ojo abierto      Honestly  the service and the food is always great here. It really is. I have been coming here for over a decade  and it remains one of my favorite places in Austin. I do recommend the avocado Rita to anyone that hasn t been here  as well as the nachos Oaxaca.    There is one Metallica. We have many styles  it s called Metallica.   -James Hetfield
Curra's Grill,28,Yesterday I went to Curra s for Chile Relleno when I left it was 21 dollars and some cents there is a place on Manor road that sells that same dish for 10 99.Now the dish I got at Curra s came with rice and the dish at the place on Manor road came with rice beans snd lettuce and tomatoes. I will no longer go to Curra s for a Chile Relleno.
Curra's Grill,29,I understand that times are tough with covid and restaurants are struggling. But what has happened to Curras   Over the past several years  in my opinion they have declined in quality.  Today  we ordered queso with ground beef. There were 6  teeny pieces of beef. It was served cold so we had to send back to have it micro d.  The frozen margaritas were icy and really blah even with the floater of gran marnier  we ordered.   The best part was our aweaome server   Hannah. She is a keeper and great upbeat attitude.   Picture is 1 of 6 pieces of ground beef granule.   Won t be back. Back in the day  this was our  go to .
Curra's Grill,30,The staff at this place is horrible  The food is good but they treated my friend with the utmost disrespect. They don t enforce masks but they were adamant about a rule that they could not serve her more than 3 drinks when she was completely coherent  citing that if she got in an accident they would lose their TABC. As a former service industry manager  I personally know there is laws protecting restaurants and bars from that exactly. We came as a group and all ordered entrees as well as dessert  but somehow that was not enough to garner decent service  I would give this place 0 stars if I could.
Curra's Grill,31,Really good service but it seems like they ve changed their plates for the worst. Huevos motule os used to be a huge hearty plate. Today it was just a tiny plate with just eggs on top of soupy black beans that were hard to eat. Had to order more tortillas and tacos to slop it up and be full. Would suggest going back to your roots.
Curra's Grill,32,Avocado Margaritas.  Forget how it sounds and just do it.    As for what I had to eat   Not even sure it was on the menu.  I just told the guy to bring out whatever he would have..I was not disappointed.   It was some sort of shredded BBQ style pork or lamb leg.   I ve had a lot of mexican food  but never anything like that.
Curra's Grill,33,I m still a super fan of Curra s  The chilequiles are STILL incredible  It seems like the prices are still as dirt cheap as they were 8 years ago. Parking can still be a challenge  but I will just turn around and back in the neighborhood because this place is worth it. Breakfast is still the best in town and their corn tortillas a great.   I am willing to get on the wait list if it comes to that to eat here. It s worth the wait.
Curra's Grill,34,12 31 2020 - Made an effort to order out from here a few times this year. This place holds a ton of memories for me and it s worth the drive even though it s out of the way for me nowadays.  On the last day of the year  there was no question on what was for dinner.  As always  the food was impeccable. The mole here is the standout  though. As good as everything was  the mole is just excellent. The tamales here are great  too  as were the other enchiladas we ordered  Chiapas Curra s .   The customer service here is excellent  too. I do not expect perfect service. When there is a mistake here  though  the staff goes above and beyond to make things right. This above all else will keep me coming back.   As renowned as this place has become over the years - and despite the growth  amp  change of the city in that time - this place still runs with the pride and attention to detail of a family owned restaurant. Admittedly  as I get older this place becomes equal parts restaurant and time machine. Extremely grateful this place has stuck around.  As things  hopefully  regain a sense of normalcy after this pandemic  I can t wait to have a family breakfast here again. For my    the best breakfast restaurant in town with a damn good cup of coffee.
Curra's Grill,35,The best flan  best tortillas  best avocados  best whole black beans - owner is amazing and treats you like family even if you are just visiting.
Curra's Grill,36,Curra s is probably the best Mexican breakfast in town  and my personal favorite for a relaxed  boozy brunch whenever I am in Austin. I have been to this out-of-the-way gem numerous times over the past couple of years  and it was at the top of our list on our recent visit to Austin. We visited with a friend on a recent Saturday early afternoon  and were immediately seated on their intimate covered patio. We started with their exceptional margarita on the rocks  which might have been followed by several more. We started with an order of their excellent and decidedly Texan yellow queso  topped with guacamole and pico in typical Austin fashion. After much indecision based on their large and tantalizing menu  she went for the classic breakfast tacos with an excellent side salsa and our friend had the most delicious looking enchiladas verdes  whereas I had the most delicious huevos sucios- Mexican rice  topped with fried eggs and the richest and most delicious mole in Texas  served alongside frijoles. It was exactly what my Texan expat soul needed. Mexican breakfast is a must when in Austin  and Curra s does the food  the drinks  and the atmosphere absolutely right. I am already looking forward to my next visit.
Curra's Grill,37,Best Mole in TX. Perfect balance of flavours. Charro beans a little spicy but great bite. Spanish rice like your grandmother made it
Curra's Grill,38,The food was okay  not bad but not great. Definitely not worth the price. We ordered chips and salsa  steak fajitas  chicken fajitas and carnitas tacos  and a margarita. It was  80 after tip. I think a good price for what we got would have been like  30. The meat in the fajitas was very low quality steak  the carnitas lacked flavor. The margarita was tasty but not strong. Service was good. Just not worth the money would never return.
Curra's Grill,39,Great spot for avocado margs. My favorite items are the Migas plate for breakfast and the black bean tamales for dinner. Always the nicest staff 
Curra's Grill,40,This was absolutely the worst service experience I ve ever had. I asked for sweet and low  refills of chips and salsa  a clean fork and my bill several times to no avail. The food was pretty good but I ll never come back again due to the service. Come to find out.... Our server was actually the manager. No  they were not busy as I could understand if they were distracted. I felt embarrassed that I recommended it to my friends. WORST EVER   
Curra's Grill,41,Came here for brunch right before leaving Austin.  It felt like a diner in the section we sat at. We started off with the salsa sampler which was a work of art. I loved a good portion of the plate with only a couple I didn t care for. It s not a deep portion of salsa so don t think you ll be swimming in it.  The borracha  salsa was one of my faves so I looked for an entre that featured it. The guisado was good and came with homemade tortillas.  It had a food flavor but wasn t as strong in flavor as the salsa plate s borracha salsa.  The meat was a bit tough.  Would certainly come back if I m ever in Austin again.
Curra's Grill,42,So I came here specifically to try their frozen avocado margarita which was quite yummy. I was expecting it to have the consistency of your typical frozen drink like a slush or daiquiri but it tasted more like a smoothie... so an avocado margarita smoothie is what it was. Either way I enjoyed it. I also tried their chip and salsa with an order of their queso flameado. The cheese in the flameado was really thick which didn t make it great with chips but perfect for a tortilla. Also their chips are not your average tortilla chips theirs are much thicker and much better. The Chile Colorado enchiladas were great as the meat was really tender. Overall great Mexican cuisine.
Curra's Grill,43,The scene  Old school Austin Mexican food  great for going out with friends. During COVID  they have options to order online by phone and picking up is easy with minimal contact.  Good for  Cochinita Pibil or any of their enchilada dishes are a solid bet. They have common Tex-Mex salsas and more traditional Mexican salsas as well  all delicious. There are a selection of different types of tortillas and sides as well.  Must have  Their avocado margarita. Yes  I said that correctly. Think mango lassi meets frozen margarita  it s so creamy and smooth while respecting the deliciousness of a good frozen margarita. My husband that doesn t like to travel more than 15 minutes for food but has no hesitation traveling to the other side of town for this.
Curra's Grill,44,Came for lunch and enjoyed the complex mole sauce.  Veggie enchilada with mole sauce - 4 5. Heaping mole is the complex  medium spiced dominant source of flavor. Solid tortilla and veggies.
Curra's Grill,45,Food was good. Salsa was great  Queso was a little runny  but tasted creamy. Rice was too watery and zero flavor  the beans however were good. The Old Fashion had way too much bitters. We d come back to have more of a happy hour  apps and to hangout.
Curra's Grill,46,Delicious food and great safety measures. My first meal out since covid. Socially distanced tables and everyone s wearing masks. Try the salsa island and Chile relleno. Thanks for a great experience  I ll be back soon.
Curra's Grill,47,Haven t visited Curra s in a while. Went down on Longhorn Game Day  Austinites  Longhorn fans will understand  to eat some Mexican food before the game. The patio was nice  a cooler Autumn day.  Service was pretty good  the food was good  but they have raised their prices.  15 for enchiladas is pricey.
Curra's Grill,48,The parole was bombbbbb. It was super flavorful  and the meat was very tender. The staff was super friendly as well. Visiting town and highly satisfied
Curra's Grill,49,I loved the avocado margarita  no prices on the menu but I believe the waitress said it was a little over  5. It was like an alcoholic smoothie. I m all about that.  The queso was okay  as was the salsa. The salsa was spicy but watery. The queso kinda was like velveeta cheese  Idk wasn t amazing or anything. Chips were ok.  The food was delicious though. Best enchiladas i ve ever had in my life     The flan was the absolute best though  so so so tasty. I want like ten more. I really liked this place and even though i spent a ton of money trying a l it was worth it  
Curra's Grill,50,Ordered for curbside pick up and the food was good. I think really a 3.7  so I land at a 4. We ordered the Curras Enchiladas  carne guidada  and the chicken taco plate. The enchiladas had a nice flavor but some pieces were a little too tough to chew. The chicken tacos were okay  but the red corn tortillas were pretty soggy. The chicken was also a bit dry. It s kind of hard to judge because it was pick up  so maybe at the restaurant it could be a different experience. The drinks are a bit overpriced.
Curra's Grill,51,Over priced  much better options for Mexican food in Austin. Really expensive  very tiny tacos. Margaritas weak and pricey. Go to Chapala on Oltorf  much better food  way better prices.
Curra's Grill,52,Unsweetened tea   good  comes w a lime.  Taco  they don t have hardshell but did toast my last corn shell.  Queso  tastes a bit like melted Velveeta but I love that so I m down for it. Has avocado in it and I m obsessed.  Chips   very salty. Good but salty.  Speaking of salt  most everything tasted high in sodium. However it was a decent pre flight meal in an interesting resultant.  Note the place is nicer on the inside than it looks on the outside. 
Curra's Grill,53,Okay  we were tourists staying at a nearby hotel  shout out to the Wyndham   for ACL. Every food vlog I consulted mentioned the avocado marg and the salsa sampler. We had a bunch of places bookmarked in Austin and it just so happened that our hotel was less than a mile from here so we went here the first night we arrived. The marg was just okay  I don t know what I thought it would be  but I m glad I got to try it. I wouldn t get it again. But our food was so good  so filling  such a pleasant family space to hang in  there were just 2 of us  but it wasn t a bad atmosphere for anyone. In fact  we liked it so much  we came back the next night and that s really pretty rare for us when we travel.   Second night was just as good. I had two different cocktails that I liked and every single menu item we had was good. I m not a Mexican food officianado so I can t speak to authenticity but it wasn t a mall Azteca either. I am convinced everything on their menu is delicious after 2 meals. Try the avo marg if you must but you ll probably enjoy something else on the menu more.
Curra's Grill,54,Honestly this place gets 3.5 stars BUT the avocado margarita gets it to 4 because it was AMAZING    It tasted like a delicious green smoothie   alcohol  can it get any better   I really liked their salsa sampler and all the food was good   However  super slow service. It took over 30 minutes to get the salsa and queso we ordered. Maybe an hour before we got our main entree. It s Mexican food  it s not supposed to take this long.  Overall  I would definitely go back  It could just be an off night. The avocado marg is worth it.
Curra's Grill,55,If you are a member of GoLocal which you should be if you live in Austin  they offer 15  off total bills 
Curra's Grill,56,Nachos Yucatecos are unbelievably delicious. Get the salsa sampler. Service fantastic. Will definitely come back 
Curra's Grill,57,This was not my choice  I asked my friend to take me to an authentic Mexican spot in Austin which should not be hard and she picked this place.  Chips and salsa were ok  the queso was ok  my carnitas plate was ok. Seriously folks nothing to write home about food wise    Now their signature avocado margarita is damn good  The only thing that stopped this from being a two star review. Do yourself a favor and order it as soon as you walk in it will blow your mind.  Other than that place is good for larger groups just don t expect to be blown away by the food.
Curra's Grill,58,Truly the best Mexican food in town and BEST margaritas. I usually judge a Mexican restaurant by their tamales and Curra s did not disappoint. I hope they make it through the pandemic and will continue to support them to help  Don t sleep on Curra s  y all.
Curra's Grill,59,Ambiance 3 - average typical Tex mex decor. Service - 3 average service accommodated large party of 9 with minimal wait. Only bused part of our table... big pet peeve of mine. Food was average - the tequila martini tasted like a shaken margarita  nothing unique or wowing about it. Avocado margarita had a cool creamy texture n color but really could not taste the avocado which might not be a bad thing. Taquitos had chicken and beans inside and nice slices of avocado on top. Loved that they used a goat cheese. Rice was blah and nothing to write home about. Sweet tamales were good but average and nothing u inquest or special. Molletes were awesome with black beans and chorizo but the bread was soggy and fell apart. What ever happened to real bolillos - crusty crusted yumminess vs  fall apart mushy bread 
Curra's Grill,60,I came because we were in the neighbourhood and I had a jonesing for fish tacos. I keep coming back because of their caldo and their  weekends only  Pozole - which  as a person who lives 1000 s of miles from my mama  is the best possible food when I m feeling under the weather. Hearty without being overwhelming and just the right level of spice. It s good to go too.   I d love to give you a full breakdown of all their other menu items  but I m a creature of habit   if it ain t broke... the chips and salsa are good though.. 
Curra's Grill,61,Curras never disappoints. I highly recommend the salsa sampler  which has all their sauces to try before you order  so you know if you want those enchiladas with the habenero or the chipotle or the mole. The avocado marg is also a winner. They have some outdoor seating and parking on site. Really eclectic and fun interior with giant murals on the walls and doors.
Curra's Grill,62,I LOVE Curra s. They re known and famous for their frozen avocado margaritas  which are good - a creamier take on a normal frozen margarita  though I prefer their blood orange margarita  which is the perfect combo of tangy and sweet.   Immediately when you sit down  you re served chips and a tomato onion garlic salsa. All of the entrees are great. The chipotle chicken is an enormous grilled chicken breast  smothered in chipotle sauce and cheese  served with grilled onions and fresh avocado on top. Beans and rice and tortillas on the side - and you have a super filling meal  or lunch the next day.   I highly recommend the queso as an appetizer - it is creamy and served with fresh pico on top. With or without beef - delicious either way. The service is always quick and friendly. The only issue is that the parking lot fills up fast  I ve had to find street parking in a nearby neighborhood a few times .
Curra's Grill,63,Just wow  and not in a good way. Old Austin is officially dead. Worst service I have received. Anywhere you ask for eggs over medium they usually come out over easy. Which mine did. Waitress rude from minute one. Rather than helping me with my order the waitress walks off saying   she s going to get me a paper menu but when I go inside she s chatting with the bartender. I order  and when my eggs are raw  slimy and raw  I request they be microwaved for a moment so I can eat them and get back to work. When she brings it out like five minutes later  by law they have to recook it fresh which they did   I said I had requested rice as well. She says  I m not your server.  Clearly not...sad I will never come back here again.  Plus these tables can never be cleaned and are just disgusting -- so unappetizing. On the website the street name is spelled wrong. They don t have my favorite dish which was the jalape o relleno. Everything is more expensive than it ever was. The manager was nice when I spoke with him on my way out.
Curra's Grill,64,Fantastic food  The service was prompt and friendly  but the food is the star. I had the tacos al pastor  which were superior to every other taco that has ever existed.  I also tried a chicken tamale  which was plenty good. The habanero salsa is killer -- sweet but with high heat. Everyone at the table was quite pleased with their dishes.
Curra's Grill,65,I can t say enough about this place and the owner Jorge  Anything and everything is soooo tasty and authentic here. The drinks are great  Amazing service. I m a fan of the ceviche and mole and all the entrees available. Hmmm so many favorites     Covered outdoor patio and private parking lot.
Curra's Grill,66,Though the staff was friendly  amp  helpful  it was not a great experience. Mediocre Mexican meal. There are WAY TO MANY Mexican restaurants in Austin to not try harder or have a standout  signature  dish.  Drinks are good  amp  have some unique flavors. I d go back with friends for drinks to enjoy the staff.
Curra's Grill,67,Decided to randomly stop here shortly after flying  into Austin. Really only came to grab a drink  but ended up ordering some small appetizers as well. Let me start with their avocado margarita. Most would be turned off by the idea of a avocado flavor cocktail  let me tell it s is amazing  So creamy and delicious. I highly recommend it  just ask a sample of it if anything. While enjoying our cocktails we decided to order the salsa sampling plate and the jalape o relleno. Food came out fairly quickly. The jalape o relleno was was the the most delicious big ball of cheesy  chili pepper goodness  Came with a small  side of beans and rice. The salsa sampler was so much fun too  Pretty much a large plate with several different salsa that have on it. All yummy and fun to try. Service was nice and helpful  drinks were strong and delicious  and food was good. What more do you need  
Curra's Grill,68,  I appreciate them having some vegetarian options. The veggie chorizo is delish and their award winning enchilada with salsa verde was ok. Not a place I d come back to personally.     My friends ordered meat dishes and they looked incredible. They seemed pleased and cleaned their plates.
Curra's Grill,69,Service was fine. Food was fine. Didn t have a drink and I hear that s what they re known for  see Avocado Margarita . We sat next to a loud table in the back dining room so it was tough to have a conversation.  Seems like one of those Austin spots that has been there forever and won t go out of business because they have such dedicated regulars  even if the food and service is just decent.  I ll give them another shot  but I would sit at the bar and have a marg with my meal.
Curra's Grill,70,The salsa sampler photo should speak for itself but also the manager is a prick  amp  I m pretty sure our waiter  was as high as the moon. With all the amazing mexican places in Austin  avoid this at all costs. ALL costs. My goodness I spent 50 dollars for actual garbage with lousy service .
Curra's Grill,71,First meal in Austin  And it did not disappoint at all    Came here based on a recommendation from a co-worker who went to college in Austin. We got there around 4 30pm on a Tuesday and mainly wanted to try their avocado margaritas but decided to get some grub as well since we hadn t eaten since breakfast at the airport.   We didn t have to wait too long to be seated. Austin our server  how appropriate right   greeted us not too long after that and we loved him  He was so helpful  gave us his recommendations on entrees  provided us with samples of the avocado margaritas before we committed entirely to each having our own. He checked up on us and even gave us recommendations on what to do in Austin and even contributed to our discussion on what type of credit card was better -- points or miles    We tried the salsa sampler which gave us a little taste of all of their salsas. Loved that because I didn t have to just choose and stick to one. Made my very indecisive self very happy.   I ordered the Tacos Carnitas Plate  comes with guacamole  onions  salsa  rice and beans  and your choice of tortilla. I don t eat carnitas often  but these were pretty good. Add some sour cream and some salsa and mmm.... Ended up liking the avocado margarita  so I got one all for myself  with no one to share with    Really enjoyed Curra s Grill. Definitely worth checking out when in Austin. And hopefully you ll be as lucky as us and have Austin as your server 
Curra's Grill,72,I love Curras . It s an Austin institution. Great food . Tacos al Pastor. Great breakfasts and drinks. Dog friendly patio . Oaxacan coffee is super. Curra s Pappas  Al Pastor  cochinita pibil. They have refried black beans and red corn tortillas. The queso is great .  I m sure everything is good on the menu. The dilemma is try something new   or go with old favorites . The pork tamale with borracho sauce is great.
Curra's Grill,73,Ordered for pickup and got the yeti celebration cup with an avocado margarita and the kids meal cheese enchiladas. Enchilada TRULY hit the spot and the yeti cup was so cute  The margarita fell short...for  12 I hoped to at least taste the alcohol which I didn t . Other than that everything was really good 
Curra's Grill,74,Wow. The best food we ve had in our stupid lives.  -avocado margarita -salsa sampler -house salsa -house-made chips -steak fajitas -carnitas tacos- carnitas being marinated in coca-cola  milk  and orange juice -service was excellent. our server asked us if we were happy.. and we genuinely were. -authentic -wow
Curra's Grill,75,This is possibly the most disappointing restaurant with a good reputation in Austin. I m getting really sick of these  Austin staple  restaurants that give little to nothing to be happy about. Who are these know- nothings with no taste boosting these grifters   Why would anyone ever say a good thing about getting so obviously ripped-off  We ordered 2 margaritas  which required that we also buy food so we got 2 tacos too. It came to about  40 after the tip. The tacos were very light  had dry meat and low quality tortillas. Only got 2 tiny salsas that had no kick. Also included a pile of iceberg lettuce and some shriveled tomato chunks. The drinks were weak. Tasted good if you were expecting a lemon slushy  but tasted like it had no booze in it at all. Don t go here. Stop listening to people telling you it s good. It s not. These crappy places need to die a quick death.
Curra's Grill,76,Many positives. Well prepared classic mexican. Good menu  well done. Best margarita ive ever had  Avacado  who knew 
Curra's Grill,77,Some of the best chips and salsa I ve had in a long time.  Their avocado margarita is so good. Creamy and blends well with the alcohol.   The queso with chorizo was spectaular. I paired it with the flour tortilla  which was wonderful.   I got the Colorado enchiladas and it was superb.   I m so glad I got to try some great Austin TexMex.
Curra's Grill,78,I absolutely LOVE Curra s Grill  Anytime I m in the area  I always suggest going to Curra s and I always order the same two things  avocado margarita and cancun chile rellano. I m not sure about any other food there because any time I think I would be adventurous  I cannot bring myself to order anything else. If I can give you one piece of advice  try the avocado margarita   In terms of everything else  the atmosphere is definitely casual hole in the wall-esque. But I think it speaks to its charm and is...festive. The service has been hit or miss. I ve had some great servers and some impatient servers  who must be at the end of their shift because doing their job was too much for them. But...the food and margs keep bringing me back 
Curra's Grill,79,Best avocado margaritas  Owner was fantastic and so welcoming. Ceviche was incredibly fresh 
Curra's Grill,80,Came here to try tamales for the first time- got the Jr Tamales plate. Came with one each of pork  chicken  veggie  dessert tamales  salsa  side of rice and beans. I am persuaded on tamales. The chicken was super dry  though. The dessert tamale was delicious  and the veggie tamale had great flavor and a small kick.   Also ordered the conchinita pibil plate. Did not enjoy that as much  the homemade corn tortillas were impressively thin and looked beautiful  the black beans were surprisingly good  the plantains were yummy  but the pork itself was just meh. Good rice and cool marinated onions. I wish it came with more onions veggies  though.   The place is super cute  loved the festive and cultural feels. Good service  but chips aren t free  ._.
Curra's Grill,81,Awesome place  Highly recommend. Had the blackened fish tacos and enchilada con Colorado. Incredible.  Get the Texas Sippers.
Curra's Grill,82,First off  the hyped up Avocado Margarita is exactly how it s described by others - Unique  creamy  and delicious. It has the consistency of a thick creamy smoothie and the color of light guac. My only complaint  Where s the Tequila   I imagine a person would get Full of drinking them  before they ever got a buzz.  Now the Bevo Margarita on the otherhand  packed a Punch  Light  fresh and a nice bite of tequila with every sip  Two Thumbs Up   Let s talk appetizers  bc that s all I usually order anyway.  Ceviche with Shrimp  amp  Octopus. They give you a choice of 2 of 3 total options. Fish. Shrimp. Octopus. We chose the shrimp and octopus. It was reasonably sized portion served with chips and salsa. Super Fresh  Very clean tasting. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes ceviche. Excellent Dish    Veggie Molettes Probably the most delicious Mexican vegetarian dish I ve ever had before   It was soooo GOOD   And the serving was Huge - easily enough for 3-4 ppl. It s basically its an open faced sandwich served on bolillos bread  like a thick French bread   covered with black beans  veggie chorizo  avocados  and Monterey jack cheese.  I m definitely looking forward to coming back soon   FYI - Parking situation is CRAPPY  We found parking across the street in the neighborhood. Watch out for No Parking Signs too.
Curra's Grill,83,Amazing food. Amazing margaritas. My go to Mexican spot. The carnitas are all amazing. Also their tamales and avocado margarita. I love this place so much and am have been going for over 10 years
Curra's Grill,84,Due to Covid 19   we have started getting take-outs.  We had had Curra s tamales awhile back and knew they would make a great meal.  We ordered 6 pork and 6 chicken.  The tamales are huge  the masa is almost fluffy and there is a LOT of meat  so we had four meals from 2 pkgs of tamales.  Soooo good. I usually put ketchup on tamales but not on these.   Their masked employee brought the pkg to our car after we ordered and paid over the phone  so we were very comfortable with the process.  Just wish I had asked for a couple of margaritas to go.  Will do that next time since they have tamale varieties I haven t tried yet. Curra s never disappoints.
Curra's Grill,85,I decided to try Curra s one day after work after driving by and seeing the packed parking lot for almost a month. I ordered a tacos carnitas plate and my partner got the steak tacos.  Solid 3 stars from me.  The chicken tasted good  but I didn t get any of the flavor in the description  Coca-Cola  orange juice  etc .  The black beans were well cooked and tasty  but the rice was just  meh .  I didn t try the steak myself  but my bf said it was good. Overall  the meal was solid and I would definitely try it again.
Curra's Grill,86,I ve loved Curra s for many years now  but as I ve moved away from the city my trips are more infrequent these days which means I savor every trip there. However  today I had a horrible experince with the lunch staff  in particular a waitress with curly hair that worked around 12 30pm today .   My husband and I walked in and it wasn t very busy  yet no one greeted us. Since we had only been there for dinner we thought maybe it was seat yourself. So my husband walked up to the waitress behind the bar and asked if we should seat ourselves since we waited 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. She snapped back  No  and walked away without another word. So we continued to wait by the door for another 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. The same waitress even closed out a few tickets at the bar and even looked over at us a few times without saying a single word. Needless to say my husband and I left as we were very upset to have been treated so rudely.  This experince has definitely left a bitter taste in my mouth and I m not sure if I will make the effort to visit again.
Curra's Grill,87,I m not a particularly adventurous diner  but of the few things I ve ordered  everything has been great  and so also the food for all of my companions.  This is a great place to bring a group  for drinks or dinner. I have easily been coming here for 15 years and never once had anything but good to excellent food and drinks.  Now the bad stuff.   Parking is always tough  and the wait staff is unpredictable. Do NOT go there in a hurry  especially in the period after lunch rush.  Between say 130 and 4 o clock  it is just a disjointed experience.   Today was super terrible.  It was not busy by the time I arrived. Food came out wrong TWICE  and the mistakes ate up my lunch period. The waitperson didn t care to help me make up the time by bringing the check.   I have to say  the food was great once it came out.   Once I had been charged  the check came back without my card.  The server did not acknowledge that it was missing at first which led to me looking all over my area for it. It was found but not before even more time was wasted  and I don t feel all that good about it. It felt weird  almost deliberate.  The whole experience was somewhere between careless and unapologetically hostile.  So bring cash maybe   I kind of blame myself for going there in off hours. I know this about the place and still  I kind of hoped I might get lucky. Nope.   Again  if you re not in a hurry and don t mind parking around the way  the food and drinks are always GREAT. Curra s has been around forever due to the food.
Curra's Grill,88,Had this place bookmarked to try while in Austin and decided to take a friend from Seattle out for another Mexican meal.  It was not crowded as we got there right before 5PM and were sat inside  since it was 95 degrees out  guess summer is here .    Drinks -- Was asked to try their margarita  which I probably should have tried the Mexican Martini or Avocado Margarita.  Decided on a Negra Modelo and friend got the Dos XX.  He said his was not cold from the draft  so they must have changed line.  Oh well     maybe next time.  Appetizers -- We started off with the queso that was really good with a scoop of guacamole in it.  Cheese was warm and consistent.  Also got their house salsa but heard to get the Borracho sauce.  I really enjoyed their house salsa  much more than their Borracho that tasted more like a marinara sauce.    Entrees -- I decided on the Carnitas tacos and friend got the Enchiladas Con Chile Colorado.  The carnitas were a little dry but helped to have the sides of onions  cilantro  tomatoes and their house-made salsa.  I subbed the refried for the borracho beans  even though I was not a fan of their sauce.  So glad I made this change because these drunken beans were the bomb.  They had a chirizo flavor that was some of the best beans out there.  As for the Enchiladas Con Chile Colorado  friend said he enjoyed it and ate this cheesy plate that came out on a hot plate melted.  Looked good if you want a cheesy plate.  Service -- Server was good and kept the beers and chips filled.   He couldn t really speak Spanish and we laughed at how he said Dos Equis     There was a big party that came in next to us as we were getting our food and looking to have a fun night out.  Started to get a little noisy  but were not rude and the servers were busting their butts getting drink and food orders out to this group of  20 people.    Recommendation - I think there are better places in Austin to eat  but I was not overly disappointed.  I would recommend Rosita s Al Pastor that is a little further east  though it is outside and can be a little warm.
Curra's Grill,89,Curra s has been in Austin a long time  at least as long as I ve lived here and that s at least 25 years. And as someone who bemoans  all too frequently  the changing landscape of what once used to be a weird little town  I want to hold onto these places because they remind me of old Austin. Is the food great   I ll say it s aight. Fantastic service  A little slower than I d like  but still friendly. The prices  Here s where I give Curra s an extra star because they re priced right. I m paying for what I get  not  14 for a plate of eggs  tortillas and beans like I have started to pay in most other Austin joints  or in NYC for crying out loud . Thank you for staying true to your weird roots  Curra s. Keep on keepin  on 
Curra's Grill,90,Great Mexican food  I got the pineapple tacos  queso  mango madness  and the avocado margarita  The avocado margarita was amazing and thick 
Curra's Grill,91,The Avocado Margarita is what Curra s is all about.. its incredible but its hard to keep calling it a margarita when I feel like its more a smoothy but it is very very good. I m giving them 4 stars hands down just because the margarita is so good.   The food can be hit or miss  sometimes I feel like I get an incredible dish sometimes I feel like I get a just ok dish. I like the variety of sauces and I especially like the pecan sauce.   I ve been eating here for years and a one point a couple of years ago the consistency issues with  the food didn t exist. It also seems like maybe they started freezing more ingredients or cutting cost to get them cheaper. Its hard to identify what happened here but Curra s was at once point a 4 star experience .. now I would say the food is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.   I say go to Curra s take the chance and see if you have a good experience. If you drink enough of the Avocado Margaritas I think its impossible to have a bad time.
Curra's Grill,92,Y all are too excited here on Yelp for these Avocado Margaritas  It s NOT THAT GOOD    We ventured to Curra s after reading reviews about their  fantastic   damn good  Avocado Margaritas. My friend and I just didn t understand WHY.   Imagine an Avocado. Great  now image a margarita. Think you re going to get that creamy texture with a splash of alcohol  No. It s just a slush of limey zest. Nothing to rave about.   WHAT WAS GOOD was their nachos. I m not sure if this is how Texas makes their nachos but it was DAMN GOOD. A tortilla chip topped with a spread of bean paste  chicken  beef and cheese. Dip that into guacamole and sour cream. You can thank me later.   Go for their nachos  not the avocado margarita.
Curra's Grill,93,I put in an online order Sunday Feb 2  2020.  The site said it did not go through so I did the transaction again.  Of course they charged my card twice  but that was not the real kicker...we get to the location to pick up our food at the 6pm pick up time and nothing   No cars  no lights on  no people  locked up tight.  They charged me TWICE for one order on a DAY they were not even open for business.  We had been hiking and rock climbing at Enchanted Rock all day and were starving so that was just one more negative hit in a horrible situation that has not been resolved.  Transaction posted to my account today.  Glad I could pay for food I never was ABLE to pick up      Horrible.
Curra's Grill,94,I came here for the avocado margarita  but their frozen machine was broken so I ve yet to try it. I went with their La Currita margarita instead  and it was decent. My friend got the same and loved it so much he got two  so maybe it s just not my taste. My other friends got a speciality tequila drink served in these really pretty cups. I didn t care for the drink because of the soda  but they both really liked it. It had tequila  grapefruit soda  and I m not sure what else.   While I could ve been more impressed with the drinks  the food was so good  We started out with the salsa sampler  and it was fun and interesting to try all the different salsas. My favorite was the avocado salsa. For my entree  I ordered the chicken asadero enchilada  and it was delicious   The sauce on top was amazing. I got charro beans instead of refried beans  and that was the correct choice. I m not really a fan of refried beans  but the charro beans were so good.   The desserts were the perfect way to end an already delicious meal. My friends and I split the mocha chocolate cake and the flan. The flan was very thick and creamy.  In other words  delicious  The mocha chocolate cake was very rich. Both desserts were good  but I think I enjoyed the cake better.   I m definitely coming back here again. Not only to try the avocado margarita  but also for the food 
Curra's Grill,95,Quirky. That s the first word that comes to mind when you walk into Curra s. Upon further inspection  you might come up with eclectic  grungy  or even authentic. It s an ocular experience before you even see the menu.   The Curra s menu doesn t venture far off the typical Tex-Mex path here in Austin. They have Fajitas  Enchiladas  and more involved entrees. So there is almost a guarantee that if you enjoy Mexican food  you ll find something to please your palate. We ordered the Fajitas  which we were expecting to come on a cast iron plate and sizzle all the way to the table  but instead  it was served on a regular  white plate  which was a little disappointing. The flavor was all there  though  so we didn t care. I think the short time it took us to inhale it was proof enough that it was good.  The only thing that I d love for them to change is the charge for chips and salsa. It s not complimentary and the food is already  1 -  2 more than their Austin counterparts  so it felt like we were being nickeled and dimed  so we didn t try too many things. Don t let that last sentence deter you from visiting though  Curra s is special and I love it still 
Curra's Grill,96,My friends and I LOVE THIS PLACE  The avocado margaritas are an absolute MUST TRY  We also got the plate of salsa  it s unique and fun to try with a large group of friends too. You really can t go wrong with anything here  it s all fresh and made to order.
Curra's Grill,97,Food as usual is very good.  Service as usual is hit or miss. If you re dining by yourself  as I was  be prepared to be mostly ignored. They were very busy  so that s probably part of it. But I ve had indifferent service from them in the past when they weren t so busy  so hence the 3 stars.
Curra's Grill,98,Parking is terrible  hot sauce was good had just enough heat. The food was good  but the charra beans where great by far the high point of the meal in my opinion. I would have been happy with just a bowl of beans.
Curra's Grill,99,The BEST Mexican food I ve ever had. Fresh  delicious...amazing like Abuelittoi was in the kitchen  Had fresh guacamole  then Pollo Maniaca...OMG...perfect Original Margarita and AL Pastor tacos. Topped off with Flan that we reminded me of my grandma s  Run don t walk 
Curra's Grill,100,Absolutely delicious. Stopped in for lunch today with colleagues and it was absolutely delicious. May go back for dinner. Great staff  Great food  Beautiful murals  Fantastically spicy salsa 
Curra's Grill,101,Visiting from San Diego  you tend to know what authentic Mexican food is and this place is legit   Great food.  Their avocado margarita is a must try.  Kind of weird though. haha  what was surprising though was that the chips and salsa were not free.  It s like  2.50.  Booo
Curra's Grill,102,Worst experience ever. I was visiting Austin and read good reviews about this place and wanted to check it out. Bad decision. Took 20 minutes for a queso to come out to start. Then I ordered the Cancun Shrimp Enchiladas and asked for no bell peppers and onions. 45 mins later the waiter comes up to me telling me my food was given to another table  the manager follows up behind saying  the kitchen made that special for you because it s a premade mix so they re not making it again for you  He didn t even care or offer to make up for it and was really rude about it so I ended up picking off my fianc  s meal. Terrible customer service.
Curra's Grill,103,Once again a Sunday morning Austin staple   Food is authentic and atmosphere is eclectic.  4 of 5 stars again  the flies  flock of flies  buzzing around like your eating outdoors.    Get past the flies it s a good stop.
Curra's Grill,104,Still one of my favorite spots in South Austin  Stopped by to try the new tequila. It s pretty awesome and makes a tasty Mexican martini. Food is great as always- had to have the tortilla soup on a cold day.
Curra's Grill,105,Food was good but pricey.  Service was good.  THEY CHARGE FOR CHIPS AND SALSA   What mexican food place in Texas does that   We won t be back.
Curra's Grill,106,We live in Dallas and come to Austin a few times a year...Found this place by accident a few years ago and tried their avocado margaritas and have been hooked ever since. LOVE THIS PLACE   Food is delicious and if avocado  margaritas aren t your taste  no worries they have lots more great drink choices. The service is great and it s run by many very handsome people . See you there
Curra's Grill,107,We were visiting Austin and decided to go here because they were known for their special  avacado margarita .  I ordered it but found it was strange that there were no prices on the drink menu.  When asked  the waitress  she said she would ask the bartender and tell us the price.  The margarita was average.  But the food we ordered was not edible.  The ceviche was bland and dry with no lime juice marinade. It was dry and served on a plate with lettuce.  It looked more like a salad then ceviche.   The second dish was red snapper Veracruz.  It was a dry pan fried piece of fish with burned garlic on top.   I would not recommend this restaurant.  One of the worse Mexican restaurants I have ever been to.
Curra's Grill,108,Well  it happened. We had a very not-good experience at Curra s in January. We chose the place that night because we were trying to get a quick  yummy dinner on the last night my parents were in town. We all had to be up early the next day and we were concerned that it would take too long to go someplace else we like that typically has a long-ish wait  such as Matt s el Rancho. We settled on Curra s at my insistence based on proximity and past good experiences getting a relatively quick  nice meal.   I arrived at 7 00PM on a Sunday night with my partner  brother and parents. We were quoted a 15 minute wait for a 5-top. All the larger tables were occupied and sitting  not leaving. The entire restaurant staff was completely beside themselves attending to a table of 20  people who had taken over the entire back room so we had a drink at the bar.  Almost 30 minutes later they crammed us into a circular 4-top booth where our knees all banged together and our elbows were constantly in each other s ribs. We were quite hungry so decided to make the best of the situation and stay. It took the waitress another 20 minutes to appear at the table and take our order and our food didn t arrive until over 30 minutes after that  so we were all starving when we got our plates.  The food was mostly fine- we got the platter of sauces  mole enchiladas  very good   green enchiladas  also good   the tamale plate  good   tacos de carnitas  very dry  nearly inedible   and the chile relleno  good   but we were all very uncomfortable  having been stuffed into a booth that was way too small for our party. My poor brother only had one cheek on the bench for most of the night.   As we were eating  there was a commotion across the room and we witnessed patrons scatter and staff panic as a rat the size of a chihuahua tore around underfoot.   We suddenly lost our appetites and had to wait another 25 minutes to close the check and leave. I was mortified. As we were exiting the building  around 9 30PM  for those keeping track   our waitress  whom we hadn t seen in about an hour  appeared  apologized and explained that there were new kitchen workers who hadn t yet gotten the memo to always shut the kitchen door to the outside so they didn t get any  visitors.  Cold comfort  I m afraid.   Now my family all refuse to let me pick the restaurant  will never let me live down that night  and they all refer to Curra s as  El Raton.  Food gets 3 stars  service and atmosphere get only one star  for an average of two stars. No bueno.
Curra's Grill,109,If I could give zero stars I would.   Nothing to do with the food or drink  they were delicious. And I will remember them fondly  as I will not be returning to this restaurant.  My zero stars comes from an inappropriate interaction with the manager owner.   He approached me with a pleasant  How was your food   Thinking this would be a quick 5 sentence exchange of complements  we exchanged pleasantries and I shared what brought me to his restaurant. He noticed I was halfway finished with my avocado margarita  passed me his business card depicting a naked woman barely covered by a margarita glass and avocados   That s what happens when you drink those  That s you  Keep drinking     He then proceeded to insult my hometown  claim my boyfriend was apart of the KKK because we re from AL  and tell how me how my work in Austin will FAIL because  again  I m from Alabama. I ve never been so insulted  in so many ways  in such a short period of time.   This is a good time to reiterate the fact that this man wasn t some jerk at the bar being a dick  I was his customer.   Our conversation ended with   Oh don t be mad  We ll see you next time  You re not mad are you    Hey J  Guess what    I m mad.
Curra's Grill,110,Avocado margaritas while the salsa sampler are a must here. I m usually not a fan of margaritas but this one was exceptional-- not too much of an alcoholic kick yet refreshing. I was intrigued by the description of the carnitas plate where the pork is marinated in Coca-Cola  milk and orange juice. I m a native San Diegan and love a good plate of carnitas. Here at Curra s the carnitas are different from SoCal TJ style -- it s more like slow-cooked  thick pieces of meat. I think the Coca-Cola  milk and orange juice helped keep the meat juicy and tender.
Curra's Grill,111,The avocado margarita alone got this place 5 stars. Thanks to Yelp I found this place close to where I was. I had the chicken tamales   beans that are like soup  forgot the name lol  and rice. The food was excellent. Best Mexican food and drink I ve had in Austin.   I m devastated that I just now finding  this place because I m moving from Austin in a couple days  so I am definitely going one more time before I head out 
Curra's Grill,112,Chips and salsa served almost immediately  love that. The salsa was cold and the chips were warm  and light . Nachos  Flautas  and Tamales were all bomb. The Nachos were actually half a corn tortillas fried with the toppings. An interesting and flavorful twist. Everything was plentiful  we were full and had since that made it to-go. The Fresca was lime  very good. And since I was pokemon hunting while sitting at our table  we ordered a Pikachu   She loved it...
Curra's Grill,113,We went to Curra s on Tuesday  early evening  after running an errand in South Austin. We sat outside on the patio since it was gorgeous  but the evening started on a sour note because the table was dirty and our waitress had an attitude right from the start.  We started with the Mexican margarita and the famous avocado margarita  both were refreshing and the avocado one was interesting  unique  and worthy of its reputation. For dinner we ordered a small chili con queso  too watery  blegh   the veggie enchiladas  and the blackened fish tacos. The enchiladas were fine  but the tacos were bland and the fish didn t taste particularly fresh.   We re giving this place 3 stars because of the snobby service and a couple of lackluster dishes. That said  we d definitely try it again if we were in the area in the hopes of ordering better and lucking out with a nicer waitress. The vibe is cool and Austinesque.
Curra's Grill,114,The margaritas are why this place gains all three stars. Hella good margaritas. If I only went to this place to drink margs.... it be 5 stars.  The fact that you must pay  2.99 for chips and salsa is a huge deal killer for me. The salsa needs work  especially if you are specifically paying for it. The food is so-so with the exception of the chipotle chicken which is actual trash.
Curra's Grill,115,Service here was good but the food was terrible  The ceviche had no flavor  so we asked for limes to add some juice and added salt ourselves. Then we ordered the nachos with shrimp and had to send it back. I literally never send anything back this is a first  which shows how bad it is. The shrimp tasted like it was sitting in a bag of water defrosting for hours. Such a gross flavor. Only reason I am giving 2 stars and not one star is because the avocado margarita was really good. Another weird thing is that the server dropped the check with the nachos still on the bill  and we threw the nachos out since they sucked. Had to remind the waiter to take those off. In my years of serving I would never drop a bill before I have the item comped. Either way I wouldn t come here again it was bad Tex mex.
Curra's Grill,116,Enjoyed by all five of us and enjoyed more by three of us than the spot visited last night at 4 times the cost.  Curra s in back in the radar for our yearly visits go Austin.
Curra's Grill,117,Looking for a legit and authentic Mexican restaurant that steers clear of Tex-mex food and the million taco joints in Austin  no knock just wasn t in a taco mood   my wife and I decided to give Curra s a chance.   Chips and salsa may have been a sign  the chips were warm but tasted like they were from a Tostitos bag  salsa was good and was spicy but not too over done...knowing I didn t go there for chips and salsa my hopes were still high.   I went with one of my go to plates and ordered Caritas with charro beans while my wife ordered fish tacos with black beans. My carnitas was unfortunately dry  which the tenderness and juicy quality of the meat which is what warrants Caritas a good dish. The rice was good though and pretty authentic  the charro beans which were 99 cents upgrade  was a wise choice. But for  13.99 just for carnitas it seemed pretty pricy to me.   My wife s fish tacos were so-so the fish was breaded just enough and we re generous with the amount of fish in both of the two tacos. The flour tortillas were dry and hard however and made it hard to enjoy them  the black beans had a touch of bleu cheese in them which made them pop and taste good.   Was hoping to find a good spot  authentic place here in Texas and I ll have to keep towards my journey sadly  sigh 
Curra's Grill,118,I ve been coming to Curra s since it s opened. I love the new decor and the avocado margaritas   8   However  I have a few suggestions  first of all  please update your menu with prices on your drinks. Sometimes I want a  15 margarita  and sometimes I would like to get two margaritas for that price and call it a day. You can t expect your servers to know the price of each one  and it is definitely worth it to me to know the difference. It feels like a ruse to trick your customers into spending more  and that doesn t sit well with me.  Second  the salsa sampler   2.99 . Interesting concept  but all those salsas run together and it becomes a hot mess. Charge a dollar more and get some ramekins to put those tasty sauces in. I d buy it. Especially since you re the only Mexican restaurant in town that charges  2.99 for chips and salsa  also a pet peeve. Maybe a  1  but  3      I ll keep coming back because I have been forever and there are dishes I love  but I ll continue to be the person who asks the price on things and taking up your busy servers  time.
Curra's Grill,119,Great Mexican food at reasonable prices. My first time to Austin and locals kept raving about this place so I gave it a whirl.  I tried the the Carnitas tacos and they were everything... With rice and beans - for less than  9  I also had their signature Avocado Margarita - a was definitely apprehensive. Two types of things that don t typically go together. But the bartender mixed up a sample for me and it was surprisingly satisfying.  I also enjoyed their version of the Ruby Red  delicious.  The staff was great  super helpful  and looked like they enjoyed their jobs. I loved it 
Curra's Grill,120,This place is good for a few dishes  but most of them don t really stand out. I think their pork tamales and mole sauce is the best in town. I ve been here a few times and usually get their rotisserie chicken  which is OK. I ve also tried their tacos Al-Pastor and while they re good  Austin definitely has better versions  Veracruz food truck   . The worst dish I ve had here is the seafood ceviche. It was bland  and the seafood didn t have much flavor.   They ve good margaritas and their avocado margarita is definitely worth a try.
Curra's Grill,121,Curra s used to be my jam for Mexican food when I lived in Austin after college.  Nowadays  I rarely stop by because it s near Riverside and I hate sitting through the traffic on I-35 just to get to it.   Curra s is still up to snuff and makes the most wonderful  comforting food.    The avocado margarita is still velvety smooth.  I went with the chicken enchiladas covered in mole sauce.  Their mole is sublime.  Not too rich  but hearty and savory  with just enough densely layered spices to bite back at you and make your nose slightly run  after you ve practically licked the entire plate.  My server was cute  bubbly and warm  even as she served two bi-racial couples on my right that had brought their dog inside  sitting in some type of little zippered puppy dog stroller.  Ahhh Austin  don t change too much with the new money flooding in  at least I know Curra s will still be in fine shape.
Curra's Grill,122,the food was mediocre  nothing to rave about but decent. the location is great. the staff is completely terrible. i would give them 0 if i could. the owners wife harassed me while i was eating. i was with my boss  amp  she came up yelling calling me an escort asking if his wife knows he s here.. since when is it illegal to go out eat with my boss  we do roofing together  even if we didn t work together she was way out of line. i saw her yelling at another younger woman too. it s sad when older woman treat younger woman like this. we all get old woman should stick together.
Curra's Grill,123,Two words  avocado margaritas.   The avocado margs are life changing. But the food is ALSO great  The mole anything  especially mole tacos  are phenomenal  and when I m feeling like I want simplicity  their enchiladas with salsa verde and salsa roja hit the damn spot. But seriously  avocado margaritas.  Also pro tip  if you sit outside  try to snag a bench table. The ones with chairs are so low compared to the height of the table.
Curra's Grill,124,Somehow kinda forgot about this place but not any more.  Showed up during happy hour. No big deal  0.50 off domestic bottled beer and I think  1.00 off house margarita.  They are really cooking here. Lamb empanadas  Octopus ceviche  Yes and they were original and tasty. Not your average Tex-Mex menu.  Little touches like a sprinkle of goat cheese on the black beans. They had whole black beans  refried black beans  charro beans  refried beans. They had all of the beans.  The corn tortillas are large  supple and very corny  yum  Carne guisada was nicely spiced  though doubtful it was flank as indicated on the menu. Beef round stew meat seems to be what it is but not a problem.  Prices are good  margaritas decent  service pretty good and a menu with a number of things to try.   Worth a return visit for the other Mexican food.
Curra's Grill,125,A co-worker of mine told a me about this place so conveniently located in south Austin. I quickly referred to yelp for advice and luckily everyone seemed to agree....this place is amazing   The Smoky Rita was really good and a great gentleman s margarita. My wife loved the Avocado margarita  its smooth cold texture was perfect. This place is beyond a 5 stars and has become a new favorite of ours    I definitely recommend this awesome place      Oh  And the art on the wall is stunning 
Curra's Grill,126,I went to Curra s for the first time on Sunday and it was immediately apparent what the owners are doing here.When we sat down  the table was dirty. No joke  the host came with one thin napkin and waved his hand around a corner of the table and walked away. It was appalling. We asked another employee to clean the table and he did only a decent job as my arm was still sitting in sauce through my meal.   Anyway  on to our meals.   2.99 for chips and salsa  which is free anywhere else.  Hint  Try Rosita s around the corner on Riverside. Amazing food  amazing prices  free chips and salsa  an establishment you feel good about patronizing  We took the bait and ordered the salsa sampler. I have never  in my all my years of dining out  seen anything so pathetic. The salsas  12 or so of them  came out on a PLATE. Each salsa portion was maybe a teaspoon s worth. If you don t believe me  order it and see for yourself. No exaggerations here. Anyway  we looked forward to trying each and deciding which we liked best. I love salsa  so a sampler is right up my alley. My friend made the comment that she couldn t taste any of them because there wasn t enough depth to the plate to get any on her chip. It quickly became a joke and we ordered multiples of the regular salsa so we could at least get something to dip our chips in. There are no drink prices on the menu and the servers  surprisingly - womp womp  don t know the drink prices. Of course they don t. And it s not their fault. My friends and I worked in the restaurant business for years and it was clear  very quickly  that all of this was is by design. I get trying to cut corners  but this is ridiculous. My friend and I split a  15 plate of carnitas  thinking a couple stuffed tortillas each would be plenty. It came with three  large  tortillas and a serving size of carnitas that was certainly not  15 worth. We had to ration it out to get a little in each tortilla. Overall  a very terrible dining experience and was overpriced and unsatisfying. We could not sit and enjoy because everything we ordered came out with a corner cut. Word to the wise  me and my friends took this hit for you... go try your luck elsewhere and write Curra s off as a loss.
Curra's Grill,127,We swung by Curra s to try out their popular Avo Marg.  The atmosphere was chill  we sat outside for HH and also got some ceviche  chips  amp  salsa.  We had a big dinner planned  so we didn t want to eat too much.    Service was very nice but food and famous avo marg were nothing to rave about.  Maybe the other food is better  but I left feeling indifferent.
Curra's Grill,128,So good  so dependable. My husband is in love with the ceviche  And I try different things  but am never disappointed. And yeah  the avocado margarita is delicious  but definitely heavy and rich. They ve been giving out free  and very generously sized  chips and salsa with take out orders. We ll see you tomorrow Curra s 
Curra's Grill,129,Excellent Tex Mex   Delicious and perfectly strong margaritas  had Kelly-Rita  Ginger and Spice and La Paloma .  Friendly service too 
Curra's Grill,130,Sad decline of an old Austin landmark restaurant.  Went on a Monday night - about 1 3 of the tables were full  plenty of servers on hand. Told server I was waiting for a friend  sat down  he brought one menu. Never got chips salsa  asked what I wanted to drink  told him water and I wanted to look at the drink menu then I d order a margarita.  This is where it got disgusting. Opened the menu and there was dried salsa and other food particles all over the inside of the menu. It looked like it had been months since anyone even considered wiping it off.   None of the margaritas or other cocktails had prices listed  there weren t any happy hour specials listed  and my server never came back in 10 minutes... and like I said  the restaurant was maybe a 1 3 full.   I started looking around... tables were gross  it was hot in the restaurant  everything on the table had a nasty film on. When my friend arrived  we promptly left and went somewhere else. At that point I was glad the server never came back to check on me.   This place was once a really good Mexican restaurant. I loved the food  vibe  and drinks. Not sure what s going on now  but it was a pathetic situation. So disappointing.
Curra's Grill,131,Quick review. Hostess sat me and my two friends inside. Our waitress took or drink order and food order. We then asked if we could sit on the patio because it was a little cold inside. I watched her tell the guy who was working the patio and He said   well they are kinda past the point of no return .  The waitress took this rude comment in stride  came to us and asked if we d still like to move. We said yes  and she said would move us outside but that the patio server wouldn t help us  she would bring us our food instead.   I ll come back another time and hopefully the servers will be more accommodating. One the one hand  it s upsetting to have that one guy refuse to serve us because we wanted different seats after we sat.  That s the kind of reaction that makes one fear that spit someone will spit in their food. One the other hand our original server was amazing. She did a fantastic job covering up for her jerk coworker. She came out repeatedly to make sure we were fine. Because of her we will be coming back.
Curra's Grill,132,When am in the mood for authentic Mexican food this is my spot and don t get me started on the avocado margaritas Mmmm good   
Curra's Grill,133,This place is just ok. We came here for the avocado margaritas and they were good but nothing over the top. As a native Texan I don t know what they are thinking charging for chips and salsa. Personally I don t think that s a norm for Mexican food in Texas. We didn t order entrees because the menus were too sticky and the place just doesn t feel clean. I would not return back personally.
Curra's Grill,134,Anytime any one asks for Tex mex suggestions for Austin - I ALWAYS say Curras. While I think the food is just alright  the avocado margaritas on the other hand give me life. It s refreshing  smooth and delicious.   GO FOR THE AVOCADO MARGARITAS 
Curra's Grill,135,My favorite New Mexican restaurant in the ATX. Super friendly staff and great food. Can not wait to come back  
Curra's Grill,136,There are a lot of places that I say  I ll definitely be back   about and then get distracted by all of the other terrific places in Austin and sadly  don t make it back. This is not one of those places. I LOVE Curra s. The food is good  the atmosphere is good  the drinks are good. The service is always friendly  though sometimes a bit slow. My only complaints would be that the bathroom always smells ...weird..... and every time I ve been  they re out of something on their drink menu. Luckily  it s never tequila  so I always get what I want   tequilalikewater   but my friends always try to order something fancy and they re out of some ingredient and can t make it.   Side note  the birds are really ballsy here. I ve seen them eat food off of a plate while a person is also eating off said plate. I find it amusing  but if you re particularly scared of birds or not a fan of bird poop  you might want to sit inside.
Curra's Grill,137,Love this place   Their salsas are amazing. The avocado margarita is to die for... Sorry for the half eaten salsa sampler and half drink margarita   you won t regret coming to this colorful hopping place because the food and drinks are wonderful 
Curra's Grill,138,Probably my least favorite texmex in town  but I haven t tried them all yet. The food is actually pretty good  but it is pricey. Unlike all other texmex places  there are no  complimentary  chips and salsa.  My visit yesterday was one of the slowest lunches I ve had in a while - and the place wasn t even that busy. My order was correct and the food was pretty good - the beef burrito though isn t as beefy as others around town. I ve had the Carne guisada before  and it was good. My. Coworkers love the al pastor tacos the most.   Another issue I ran into was of tables not being allowed split checks. It was divided equally. I don t tend to order as much as others because of my budget. The change for me was a 40  increase to my bill.
Curra's Grill,139,I love coming here for breakfast. The Mexican coffee is chocolatey and smooth. It s a great way to start the day. The carnitas tacos are sweet  moist and served with a pineapple salsa that is perfect. The only complaints the average corn tortillas.
Curra's Grill,140,I ve been looking for a Mexican restaurant that makes their own tamales and no doubt this place not only makes their own but they make them HUGE   It takes 2 corn shucks to hold these tamales.  The masa is awesome  not too thick and not too dry.  I had their tamales plate that comes with 4 tamales  rice and beans.  I choose 2 pork and 2 chicken  but was only able to put down 2 of the 4.  The filling and masa proportion was excellent  not too much masa and not enough filling.  Really like to taste of both pork and chicken.  For Christmas me and the family does a traditional Tamale Throwdown.  Where we go around town  San Antonio  and get the best of the best tamales and do a blind taste to see which one is the best.  This year we are going to do a Throwdown between the best between San Antonio and Austin.  I am going to pick Curra s tamales to represent Austin and my sister-in-law is bringing San Antonio s favorite Ruben s tamales.  We will see who s makes the best tamales.   We also ordered their flautas plate  which they were also a huge size.  They are definitely your traditional size flautas for sure.  They are made in-house and filled just like their tamales.  The Mexican rice is awesome with flavor very fluffy.  This was our first time here and it won t be our last   Also  great thanks to  Red  the restaurant manager for making room in the parking lot so we didn t risk possibility of being ticked or towed.
Curra's Grill,141,Bit late to leave my say on this place... Been here at least 10x. It s honestly one of the best Mexican restaurants in Austin. The staff are always friendly  the atmosphere is very electric. Cool murals  lights people etc. I always get the Avocado margarita and Tacos Encebellados.  Highly recommended on my part if you re simply visiting or looking for some good authentic Mexican food
Curra's Grill,142,First time trying this place. Parking lot is small but went at a good time so no problem there. Went with a group of people. Everyone had mixed reviews of their orders. I had the half chicken plate which included beans and rice.  First off  it was expensive   15. Wouldn t have been a problem if it tasted good.  The chicken was dry and flavorless. Beans and rice wasn t anything special either. The waitress was forgetful and seemed in a rush. Also  chips and salsa are not complimentary which is NUTS  Have passed by this restaurant many times  next time I ll keep on driving. Disappointed.
Curra's Grill,143,Alright spot with delicious avocado margarita. It s smoothie like  and I like to think healthy if it has avocado in it. We had the pibil carnitas  and chicken mole. The order took longer than I expected so we ended up some chips and salsa. Overall not bad spot.
Curra's Grill,144,Authentic Tex-Mex on Oltorf that serves great food and makes great drinks - including an amazing avocado margarita.  Great outdoor seating as well 
Curra's Grill,145,I ordered the avocado Margarita that they are famous for. I was not disappointed. It was super creamy and they add just the right amount of alcohol that creeps up on you     I also ordered the tamales- also were very delicious.
Curra's Grill,146,Highlights  the avocado margarita and queso. Curra s has a huge margarita menu  but if it s your first time here  don t miss out on their infamous avocado margarita. Think margarita meets avocado smoothie - it s pretty great. They have plenty of great queso variations as well  Beware though  this place is pretty pricey. And while we loved the queso and margs  the fajitas didn t cut it for us.
Curra's Grill,147,Love this place.  When ever I am in town I have to have their mole .  It is some of the best I ve ever had.  The avocado margarita is pretty darn good.  I m glad to see they a tee still open  
Curra's Grill,148,Delicious. Best Al Pastor ever. No one else can come close. I wish they had Suavecito Tequila.  Then they would be flawless.
Curra's Grill,149,If I was Mexican this is what I imagine my mom s food would taste like. Everything is always perfect. Nothing fancy just good old fashion great medics food. I especially love the margaritas and the simple no nonsense feeling of being at home here. Great food. Great prices. Wouldn t go without a meal here when I m in town.
Curra's Grill,150,I really enjoyed my visit at Curra s. The food was tasty and the service awesome.   Food  4 5 We ordered the veggie and fish taco plates  a big order of guac and a few of the avocado margaritas. The portions are perfect and the food well seasoned. The margaritas were really special and unique. You can t really taste the avocado but it gives the frozen margarita a smoother texture. I also thought the chips and refried beans were delicious. Beware  food is salty  guac and beans especially.    Service  5 5 Our servers were attentive  kind  and patient. We immediately felt welcome by everyone in the restaurant    Space  4 5 Low key and colorful space with slightly limited parking. We found street parking easily  though.
Curra's Grill,151,I had the carnitas tacos. They were pretty tasty  but the queso was the highlight of the meal. They have some special queso appetizers that I plan on trying next time. I also hear that this place uses avocado in their margaritas. I will definitely have to try those out when I return.  All in all - good eats. It s sort of a Tex-mex interior mexican combo.
Curra's Grill,152,Attentive  fast service  Great food  Avocado margarita is the MUST HAVE  The queso was good and thick  We had the fries and they were okay but would try something else from the appetizer menu  Over all fun spot to try and great service.
Curra's Grill,153,One of my all time favorite places. Starting coming here the first week they were open. Have enjoyed the authentic  amp  delicious dishes  amp  was so happy when they added their famous avocado margarita  Amazing 
Curra's Grill,154,While I wasn t overwhelmed by the food here.....it was pretty decent.   My friend and ordered some veggie tacos. She picked corn tortillas  I picked wheat. The veggies were decent and not incredibly flavorful.  I did REALLY love that they fried up some plantains for me sans the honey and cinnamon and butter. The vegan in me was appreciative.   That avocado margarita however...  HELL YES  It was creamy  and yummy and smooth and LOVELY. I would go back just to sit at a bar and drink that again. Seriously...give it a go. While it may not be for everyone .... if you re adventurous and want to take a chance on an unconventional margarita.....hit this up.
Curra's Grill,155,We loved the salsa tasting plate - yum and definitely a must  The Avocado Marg was creamy and tart  but didn t have an overwhelming avocado flavor - so good I had to have two of them.  We were impressed and will be coming back 
Curra's Grill,156,This place is so good  We spontaneously chose this restaurant and were so glad that it was still open for dine-in during covid. But all employees were wearing masks and social distancing was highly enforced. Appreciate that. This food tasted like it was distinctly from the deeper parts of Mexico. Absolutely amazing  I m used to eating more Tex-Mex food that you find on the border but this was unique. Definitely coming again  Staff is so friendly too 
Curra's Grill,157,Mole was some of the best Ive had   but the ceviche was mostly tomato  and wasn t very fresh tasting. We chose the fish and octopus  and there was only a single piece of octopus in it.  The avocado margarita was good  but a bit overpriced for the size. The Daylon margarita that my boyfriend had tasted like the glass still had dish soap on it. Our waiter was very pleasant  but it seemed as if he just had to up sell the  unauthentic food .  Overall... Not very ideal.
Curra's Grill,158,Quite delightful experience  They have 17 different salsas which include mole  verde etc. their house salsa is amazing and ooooo Lordy the Kelly s quest was amazing definite must when coming here  My mom enjoyed her chicken tacos and I got the shrimp tacos. I m not big on the pineapple style shrimp tacos I would rather have the pics and jalape o style but these where pretty good  We had the avocado margaritas th t where pretty good but definitely a one time drink not light enough to drink all night   Make sure to sit on the patio and go in the evenings to enjoy the Austin cool breeze
Curra's Grill,159,This joint has been open for 26 years and their leadership is still operating on training wheels. Will NEVER return to this pathetic and poorly led joke. Absolute  h t     Disgusting. Entitled.
Curra's Grill,160,Having worked near downtown Austin  Curra s was a go to place for lunch.  Seems like my favorite was the Tacos Al Pastor.  Overall it was a filling meal  however this time the pork seemed a little overdone  dry  and the tomatillo salsa verde was a little flat.  Regardless I have eaten here many times and would recommend you at least give it a try.  Cold cerveza  outdoor seating  it can be relaxing.
Curra's Grill,161,My fave  Always awesome  The best stuff  definitely an Avocado Margarita  Tacos al Pastor     Enchiladas with Chiapas sauce  Queso    Carnitas 
Curra's Grill,162,I ve had better chips but the salsa and food are very good.   If you drink stop by and get an Avocado Margarita
Curra's Grill,163,The food here is extremely cheap and nothing about this place taste it off and take whatsoever. I ordered two enchiladas  one cheese and one chicken  and it came with rice and beans. The rice tasted like something that was once frozen with corn and green beans in it  i ve never had authentic Mexican rice with corn and green beans in it before . The refried beans were average and as for the enchiladas  I ve never seen anything like it in my life. They took what tasted like canned nacho cheese and dumped it all over the top. It was like the kind of processed cheese that comes in a giant barrel. See picture...  I ordered a drink that I ve had 1 million times and South America and is traditionally served at every bar. I was excited because they had it on the menu here and I asked the server if it was just the standard  traditional make of it and he said yes. While I noticed that use tequila in it instead of vodka  the entire drink was completely wrong and I couldn t even stomach it. They basically mixed tequila with soda water and squeezed a bunch of lime into it.  When we were about halfway done with our meals  the server came back and started asking us if he could take our plates  I felt extremely rushed out of there. It was either that  or he noticed I wasn t eating the plate in front of me for fear that ingesting 6 pounds of queso dip that essentially turned my enchiladas into a soup would make me physically ill.   Either way  this is probably the single worst Mexican food restaurant I ve ever been to and if you re looking for authentic Mexican food with an awesome ambience  this is definitely not the place 
Curra's Grill,164,I ve been to Curra s countless times and I ve only ever ordered tacos with a side of rice... I know what I like. Great tacos  no complaints at all. They re not necessarily the fanciest  probably because I don t order them fancy  or most sophisticated... why would they need to be  though  The worst I could call Curra s is mediocre  but even that s a stretch.  I usually get my order to go on my way to work  it s always done quickly.   I ve also done catering orders with them and they re super responsive and easy to work with. Probably my most painless catering experience. One time the staff  forgot  to make the order  which was kind of a pain in the ass  but they threw in some free stuff and all was forgiven. Staff generally is friendly but I ve had my moments of standing around at the bar  also the pickup counter  ignored for five minutes. They re usually pretty busy.  Give them a try 
Curra's Grill,165,Great food and margaritas and very nice staff  Only downside is the chips and salsa are  2.99  even if you purchase an entree  and the margaritas are pricey.
Curra's Grill,166,Terrible experience with a large group.  We went for happy hour on Friday and they don t have happy hour on Friday s.  Thirteen people ordered drinks and apps.  The waiter would not let us get our bill until everyone had completed their tabs.  It took them an hour and a half to get our credit cards back.  He came back and told us some of the food was unclaimed  in spite of us all writing our orders out on paper.  I just wanted my check  several of us told him what we ordered and needed to leave  he still would not give us our cards.  Until all items were claimed.  Someone offered to pay them  so we could leave.  Still another 40 minutes    We talked to the manager  he finally got out checks.   Even if the food was good  it was a terrible experience.
Curra's Grill,167,Avocado margaritas. That was the only reason why I was dragged here. They were so creamy and flavorful. I definitely had a little buzz going on as I sucked down two in one hour.   It s a tiny little place with a wrap around patio. Open kitchen. Food was pretty tasty. We got chips and queso and a jalape o rellano with habanero salsa. Queso was definitely the stringy kind. I couldn t stop dunking my chips. Jalape o rellano was okay. It was pretty cheesey. The habanero salsa though was no joke.
Curra's Grill,168,5 stars bc their soup heals anything. Feeling really sick  this will cure you. Have a sad heart break  don t worry  this soup has you. I think they use holy water in it. The avocado margaritas are also really good.
Curra's Grill,169,Unlike a stolen car who s parts are worth more than the whole  I m  writing my 100th review with an Austin favorite  Curra s  who s better because of it s parts. Especially the margaritas.  While this little Tex-Mex eatery has a reputation for marginal service  you can get lucky but don t count on it. Take a seat on the patio that overlooks the parking lot and watch the cars roll by on Oltorf. Chips come out somewhat warm and the salsa has a little spice. Your first order at this point is the Avocado Margarita. Trust me on this. I know it sounds strange  and it is  but delicious. You will become a fan.  With Avocado Margarita in hand  look over the brunch menu for Chilaquiles  add chorizo   Migas or a good ol Huevos Rancheros. Too late for breakfast  May I highly suggest the Enchiladas con chile Colorado which has guajillo and chipltle marinated pork smothering cheese filed goodness. Not wanting pork  Go with the Mole or Verde. You pick the filling and the sauce.   Curra s may not have the best service or the best view but it s friendly  easy atmosphere delivers delicious food. This locals Tex-Mex joint will do just fine to cover that hangover with warm  gooey goodness and kick your day in gear. And for that  I thank you.
Curra's Grill,170,Two words  Conchinita Pibil. Two more words  Avocado Margarita.  I had both of these at my recent first visit to Curra s. Both were fantastic. Conchinita Pibil is marinated pork leg in a banana leaf. It was full of flavor and so unique. Definitely recommend. The group I was with was super jealous they didn t get it also.  And of course avocado margaritas. It just enhances the margarita so well. Smoother and delicious.  I will definitely go back but it is going to be difficult to get me to try anything else.
Curra's Grill,171,Food and atmosphere we excellent. Tried the avocado margarita and it was smooth but you have to like avocado. The tamales were homemade and filled with flavor. Black beans were yummy  I like the service friendly staff. Too stuffed for dessert so maybe next time I will have to indulge in that 1st
Curra's Grill,172,I ll agree with what seems to be the consensus here. 3-3.5 - the avacado margaritas were great  But the food did not impress me. We order Pescado Veracruz     I think. Came in a sauce that smothered the flavor of the fish with flavors that didn t seem to go well together - like olives and mushrooms. Also ordered shrimp relleno and it had pineapple in it. Also didn t seem quite right. Gray location and service and atmosphere.
Curra's Grill,173,This is 3.5 star food with 3 star service  and 5 star avocado margaritas.  I don t know if Curra s was the first to do an avocado marg  but I know they do it well. It basically tastes like a good frozen margarita  but just a bit creamier.  The service throughout our entire dinner was odd and slow. The waiter didn t crack a smile once  but did his job. The kitchen and bar  however  were very slow. We had easily polished off our large bowl of queso  and my margarita was down to the dregs well before our food came out.  The white queso was good. At first  I didn t love the Taco Bell style ground beef on top  but once we mixed the cheese  guacamole and beef together  it was a really nice combo. I really liked my Colorado pork enchiladas in red corn tortillas. But be warned  they are cheese enchiladas with the Colorado pork chili on top  still good  just not exactly what I had expected. I paid 79 cents to add banana to my rice thinking it meant fried plantains  but it was literally a sliced banana. My Mexican husband said this is a trick parents use to fill their children s bellies and get them to eat their rice.  I d go back for a margarita and would end up eating while there  but I wouldn t recommend you go too far out of your way to visit.
Curra's Grill,174,My usual place when I m craving Mexican in Austin. Chill place  nice prices  and delicious food.  I usually get the blackened fish enchiladas or pescado al mojo de ajo. The pozole available on the weekends is amazing  After trying their honey habanero salsa from the sampler  I asked if I could buy a whole container to go and they let me. Their tacos encebollados have that I believe and is also delicious.  Great place.
Curra's Grill,175,We live just down the road and had been wanting to try this place out for some time. It was packed on a chilly Thursday night and we sat outside  those heaters REALLY work   Parking sucks but you park on the side streets and risk your life crossing riverside.   The food was okay  nothing spectacular but it tasted good. Overall I d say a little overpriced.  The avocado margarita is very popular and while it s good  I don t think you need to spend the money on it. My boyfriend had their Chamoy lemonade - definitely pass on that  short of exciting.   They have Chili Colorado which is a family favorite and hard to find a good place to get some around here. Their sauce wasn t perfect but it definitely hit the spot. So if anything  give that a try.  A quick note on service - it was a busy night and the server was still very attentive  I think they can handle crowds pretty well.   Nothing was bad  nothing was incredibly great  it was all just okay. I d give it 4 stars but honestly  I don t know if we ll go back  it s not something we ve since said we re craving or dying to get back to.
Curra's Grill,176,My favorite just-Mexican place in Austin  but I don t think I can recommend it easily anymore. Shady service has lowered my opinion.  They charged me twice for my steak substitution  they told me it would be  4 but then charged me  8  claiming later t was  4 per enchilada  wtf    . The main thing that makes this restaurant good is the sauces. Well I probably won t be coming back any time soon. I asked to tak to the manager but gave up after maybe 10 minutes and with the person I talked to basically hinting that the manager wasn t going to fix the over charge. Serious bs.   Also their  6 guac comes from a giant pre-package  not house made. Their rooms are acoustically crappy too  so it can be really hard to hear whoever you are with  and it just gets worse the more people there are  or if there s just one loud one   I will miss their mole and other sauces. But not much else.
Curra's Grill,177,Avocado margaritas to die for. The ambiance was typical hole-in-the-wall  but clean and comfortable. The service was good  my friend was in town and we went two nights in a row  the first for dinner and the second for drinks and queso.  I had the conchinita pibil  which was fantastic  The guacamole was nothing special but I d be willing to knife my own mother for the queso and the avocado margs were heaven. My friend had a basic burrito which looked great. The prices range from reasonable to a little high   8- 15  but we both had leftovers and they had to-go containers for our leftover queso. I ll be taking my mother to dinner here when she comes to visit.
Curra's Grill,178,Honestly the food is pretty good  very authentic and they have a large diverse selection of drinks. It is the only Mexican restaurant I have ever been to though that charges for chips and salsa. They loose a star for that one
Curra's Grill,179,Ceviche was dry and charro beans were too spicy to eat. Margaritas were small and not good at all. Changed it up to a michelada but first sip was thick tomato juice. I prefer mine with Clamato. Wouldn t recommend
Curra's Grill,180,It s not bad but it s nothing really special. Like everyone else  I really liked the avocado margarita. It pretty much tastes like a margarita smoothie. I also liked their queso and the chicken fajitas I ordered weren t bad. The service wasn t bad either... It was just okay. This wouldn t be my first pick  but I wouldn t be against coming here to eat.
Curra's Grill,181,I ve been eating at Curra s every week for over 15 years. The mole enchiladas are perfection. I m a lifelong mole fan and search everywhere for good mole  Curra s has the best. I get mine with chicken AND cheese inside - you have to special order that.   Looking at the few bad reviews on Yelp  Curra s just isn t about chips and salsa... they re not Tex-Mex... and they get SLAMMED during peak hours  so factor that in if you have a big party or are in a hurry. Otherwise...  Excellent hand-made tortillas. I often get the pork tamales for takeout. Their justly-famous avocado margarita is perfect and unlike anything you ve had anywhere else. The breakfast items are very good and served all day. And sometimes I get the chicken soup  which is a BIG bowl and very good.   The owner Jorge is almost always on site and is a great guy. He seems to know everyone. A lot of celebrities eat at Curra s.   The food here is far better than that other fancy place in Austin that specializes in Central Mexican cuisine  with way better prices.   Parking can be tricky when they re busy... then you have to park on the street around the corner. Tip  best bet for the best experience is to go to Curra s at an off-hour... it gets really packed at peak hours. Or at peak hours  just call in the tamales for takeout.
Curra's Grill,182,I like this place  but it is very inconsistent. Avo margs are great  but sometimes very watery. Last week I came here and ordered the chicken enchiladas and the chicken was dry and the sauce was cold. It was expensive for that kind of quality food.
Curra's Grill,183,45 min later  on a slow morning  luke warm breakfast arrives and it s incomplete. The waiter offered a discount  but not til his manager arrives. Who s in charge of this place right now  As I m writing this review 5 more minutes have passed and I can t even begin to eat  and my food is getting cold.   So at this point  I m telling him I m leaving and leaving money for what we ate  which is one plate.  Oh...and they charged us for all of it. No discount. What kind of customer experience is this 
Curra's Grill,184,I LOVE THIS PLACE   I ve been here a handful of times and did have bad service once  but honestly i didn t care enough to let it ruin my experience  lol. I can t say I have tried many Mexican restaurants in Austin  I don t live there  but I am sure glad I was told about Curra s. I usually go every time I visit and it does not disappoint.
Curra's Grill,185,A-ok seems a bit strong...  For years Curra s has been a reliable and busy Tex-Mex shop anchoring the South Side. Tired of fighting the bullshit trendiness of SoCo but need your fix  Go to Curra s.  And that s about where it ends.  On my latest visit we found the tacos good but strangely lacking normal sides - roasted peppers  onion or pico de gallo. You don t have to ask for that often. The rice was meh  but hey  its really hard to get Spanish rice right.   The chips were adequate - why did my server have to be told to bring them when others were showing up with them without asking  which is the way you do it folks  - but the salsa was primo.  The tortillas  corn and flour  were just adequate  but the borracho beans were amazing   As noted our server could use some lessons on serving - and please for the love of god when we re through eating bring the check  I do not want to  lounge  any place with screaming kids  servers who drop plates  right next to me  or people jammed in like sardines. I m done  let me pay and get out of here.  Should you try it  Yes  its been around forever. Should you expect greatness  No. Its just a place to go when you don t wanna go farther.
Curra's Grill,186,When being given waters at the beginning  we asked for straws. We watched the waiter walk around  chat with his co workers  lean on the bar... We got our own straws after several minutes. Then we ordered a salsa sampler  appetizers and entrees.  20 minutes later we tried to get the waiter s attention. He was too busy hanging out at the bar  10 feet away. We discussed how nice it would have been to get our salsa....   Our meals came out after 25 minutes. We told the poor guy who brought our meals that we hadn t even gotten out appetizers and he finally got our waiter s attention.  So our meals got sent back to sit under the heat lamp and dry out until we finished our pre course. Incredibly frustrating  disrespectful  and unpleasant. Oh and we still left 20  tip. That guy has no business being in the service industry.
Curra's Grill,187,Heard the buzz about their avocado margaritas so I had to try them. Absolutely amazing..    BTW  the recipe is copyrighted to if you have one anywhere else in town it a knock off...so just go here for the real thing. Now for the food...DELICIOUS.   You should start with the salsa sampler so you can choose your meal by the sauce you like best. This will help you avoid getting something too hot or not spicy enough. The Pastor is great  the enchiladas in a Mole sauce is great  the chili  relanos are great...but the authentic Yucat n pork dish with plantains is absolutely one of the best Mexican meals I have ever tasted. Bottom line  if you re in Austin you must give this place a try. You won t regret it.  
Curra's Grill,188,One of my favorite recommendations for Mexican food in town  my family took my out-of-town uncle here tonight. We noticed the service was kind of slow  which I have never experienced here before. However after receiving our drinks and queso we ordered our entr es. Then after an hour still no food had arrived. I finally had to bail because of prior plans and asked the manager to take my order off the check. I feel sorry for leaving my family there.   I am really applauded that Curra s  lost our ticket  for an hour as the manager explained to me. Its unfortunate because of this experience and a couple other recent visits that I will not return nor recommend anyone to go here. I m a local Austinite and had honored this place for being so constant for so long. Scratch this place off your list.   Totally bummed  -Tony
Curra's Grill,189,Good margaritas but that was about it I was disappointed with the food this time  The service was lousy . The waiter didn t know about the food and cloud not suggest the right dish According to my diet restrictions
Curra's Grill,190,Echoing much of what Mariah D. said  as we visited together. Good queso. Great avocado margaritas. Bad mezcal drink.   Our waiter seemed a little annoyed with us  and it definitely brought down the mood.   The mole enchiladas were yums  and not too spicy for me-- a person who can handle no spice at all. Which brings me to the seafood chile relleno I ordered. They didn t deseed the pepper. WHYYYY   I ended up trying to scrape seeds out and ultimately ended up just having a few bites of it  and then eating the rest of the food  which was pretty good  I must admit.  Parking was not abundant  but we still managed to grab a spot and go in without a wait on a Saturday night at prime time.  But  between the service and the overall vibe  I m going to take this 3.5 review to the 3 end.
Curra's Grill,191,Curra s was the site of many a bright and bawdy breakfast for my friends and myself in the early 2000s- we passed off an avocado margarita and ceviche as a healthy breakfast whenever we could get away with it. The avocado margaritas are now pre-made  and the food is sub-par. I took a date here recently  and felt really embarrassed about it. I will try not to come here again  especially with companions I want to make happy. Thanks for ruining my love life  Curra s 
Curra's Grill,192,Awesome chips....very light and not excessively salty like many other places and very fresh food.
Curra's Grill,193,Classic Austin  Parking lot is a bit of a prison shower but once you re in  everything is great. Drinks are strong  wait staff is attentive  food is excellent. Patio is small but utilized well.
Curra's Grill,194,One of my FAVORITE little holes in the wall. The food has excellent flavor and they have an Avocado Margarita. Which I know that sounds weird but it s not weird. It s amazing. The consistency is more like a soft serve ice cream which I really enjoy. For sure stop by if you are in the area.
Curra's Grill,195,Still one of the best Old Austin places around. Most entrees are close to  8. Avocado margaritas are the best  frozen mango a close second . Always love anything with the chilorio  even the breakfast  items.   Get the sauce sampler if you have not mastered the menu. They have 12 sauces and the menu can be intimidating. This is NOT tex-mex.  Parking sucks at peak hours.   Get banana added to the rice and order the black refried beans as hardly anyone does them anymore.
Curra's Grill,196,Still excellent fare.  The Avacado Margaritas are the best.  Upsize it for  2 more.  Kelly s Queso is also a nice warm up.
Curra's Grill,197,It s pretty clear that they hate their customers here. We arrived around 8 00 this evening and we stood by the  Please Wait to be Seated  sign for a solid 5-10 minutes with no one saying a word to us. We finally stopped one of the waiters rushing by to ask if there was a hostess and he pointed out a woman who said she would be right with us.  After a couple more minutes  she finally came over seeming annoyed that we interrupted whatever she had been doing and when we said  two for dinner  she said  that will be a 25 minute wait.   So we left.  And there were a lot of empty seats.  Spare yourself the miserable experience and go eat somewhere else.
Curra's Grill,198,I have been eating at Curra s for years  they even catered my wedding.  Heck  I used to eat there when it was Guero s before they moved to Congress. .     Admittedly  I have moved around a lot and not eaten there a lot since moving back a year ago.  I have  however  eaten there twice recently and while I m happy to say the food is still delicious and was consistent both times   the service was quite lacking both timss.  At least the service was friendly on the 2nd visit  that goes a long way.    Both visits were marred by abnormally long waits  to order in 1 case and to get the check in another .  And while they were busy  they weren t crazy  there was no wait for a table .  Special requests  for limes and red corn tortillas  got forgotten   long waits and glasses empty for 10 minutes in between water refills.   Nothing horrible  but not what I recall from what had been my favorite Mexican restaurant in a town with a lot of Tex-Mex or mediocre taco joints.  The only food beef is that if I m paying for chips and salsa  in the old days before the California invasion no self respecting restaurant charged for that   the chips should not be stale.  The service on the first of these 2 visits was just downright strange though.  Maybe he was brand new  but it was if everything he said was off a cue card with no genuine care or connection.   If I was at a national chain where the   of pieces of flair is top priority for waiters I would expect that.  But at an Austin original I expect folks to be genuine or even funky funny.  I don t expect 5 star service at Curra s but I definitely expect better than this.  1 visit and I would figure it was an off night.  2 visits in a row and its starting to look like a pattern.   I m going to give it a rest for a while and reevaluate one last time.  I gave it 3 stars because the food was still great and consistent.   Service was more like 1.5 stars.
Curra's Grill,199,Just moved to Austin and quickly made taco Tuesday a thing for myself. Looked this place up and read all the reviews and realized that it was sort of a staple in the south Austin community and quickly realized why. I experienced great service the moment I walked in the door. I was seated quickly and when I asked for a margarita I was notified it was happy hour and was recommended the avocado margarita. It was amazing    So good  odd consistency at first  but soooo damn good  Ordered the carnitas taco plate. Nothing to write home about but good nonetheless. The rice was honestly the star of the plate. The waiter wasn t super annoying or pushy with me  asked how everything was and was prompt in getting me out of there  which is my style. The interior is vibrant and colorful. The art was stunning. Definitely will be returning on more than just taco Tuesday for this gem.
Curra's Grill,200,This is my breakfast stop and has been for many years. Great coffee  perfect mole  wonderful staff.
Curra's Grill,201,Good food but I wouldn t recommend ordering online. They seemed pretty annoyed that we showed up to pick up an order. Also no utensils or anything. It s fine but not great.
Curra's Grill,202,It was pretty good but we walked in with the expectation that it was the BEST Mexican in Austin. We wouldn t say it s the best  especially since you have to pay for chips and salsa. The parking is also very limited. Overall not a bad place  but not the  1 spot for Mexican in ATX.
Curra's Grill,203,Amazing food  the mole  the cochinita pibil  the palomas with mezcal. The servers are nice  they actually do their jobs and do it with a smile. No attitude. Simple authentic mexican food.We even enjoyed the flan that was made with goat milk too cajeta... mmmm  I love that the staff was diverse too  not the usual tired old place with them same tired old people. It was lovely  diverse  tasty and young. Made me smile. M 
Curra's Grill,204,It s a hit or miss with this one. I ve been a couple times now and I still can t find a dish that I fall in love with. People come here for the famous Avocado margarita. Although I did not personally like it  others seem to really enjoy it.   The parking is a struggle most of the time. It s very limited and most of the time you ll have to wait for a spot.   Overall  the staff is friendly most of the time. Since it is so close to me  I will probably go back and keep searching for my perfect dish.
Curra's Grill,205,Food is pretty good and it is in a convenient location. Only thing is they are a little pricy. Food for 2 people would be like  50.
Curra's Grill,206,Love it   Delicious food and just love the corn tortillas they make in the restaurant  absolutely amazing and makes any of the dishes taste even better. I m a fan of the tacos encebollados  al pastor tacos  mole enchiladas  pozole  campechana  shrimp cocktail  and carnitas. The borracho salsa is my fav but the other ones are equally yummy and the habanero one is the perfect combo of hot but also kinda sweet.  Flan is my favorite dessert. Lately it just tastes more delicious.
Curra's Grill,207,I LOVE CURRA S  They need to get their servers staff right  Today s server was slow as hell  I was sitting for 10 minutes before I got my soda  I asked for a straw  which came 5 minutes later and a bus boy had man handled it...he handed it to me without a wrapper. Why even bother  I finally got my queso and asked for a little plate....never came. This was not a busy time  4 30PM on Sunday and several parking spots in the drive way. No excuse. The food is delicious but the service gets progressively worse with each visit. sigh.
Curra's Grill,208,Definitely not coming back here for a meal.  My husband and I went for a 4pm dinner and service was great. He got the enchiladas and substituted in the steak for an extra  3.75. When we got the bill it looked like the charged us twice for the steak  but apparently the  3.75 is PER ENCHILADA  which is 2 on the plate . So shady. Tried to talk to the manager but he never came out to talk to us about this so we just left after standing around for 10 minutes by the door.  The  6 guacamole is pre-packaged which is why it tastes only like a garlic bomb. I ve had it before  it comes from Trader Joe s and is  3.75 per package. They also use pre-packaged avocado for the Avocado Margarita. What a shady place.  Salsa sampler isnt worth the price either. It s just one plate with little shallow pools of different salsas on it. I guess they expect you to fill up on chips because they kept dumping those on our table.
Curra's Grill,209,This place has a massive menu and indoor and outdoor seating. The food was not impressive. But our waiter was soooo great. We had a group of 16 - he took so many drunk orders  split checks  etc. 3 star place  5 Star waiter    
Curra's Grill,210,Avocado margarita is always on point. Manager was super attentive  and even customize the enchiladas for my girlfriend. Been coming here for 11 years and will continue  love it
Curra's Grill,211,Ohhh I was having a hard time between three and four stars. The service was just so here and there but the food and the company made up for it so Curra s you get four stars. Hubby and I were meeting our friends for brunch on Sunday. They got there before us so they were situating our tables. The hostess that was getting a table for us was so young bless her heart. My friend was trying to be light and joke around with her but she just wasn t getting it. We were trying to be easy and simple. We told her we would take whatever table we could get.  They sat us outside in this covered semi enclosed patio. The table and chair size ration was a bit odd. The table was a bit high but I m pretty short. Our server was nice but sometimes not as attentive for the duration of our service. We ordered queso and salsa to start off with. There were so many options to choose from and everything sounded so good. I finally decided on the Enchiladas Curra s. It had a blend of a few things I wanted. It was a cheese enchilada with Carne Guisada on top. I was very happy with my selection. My husband kept it simple and got three chorizo and egg tacos. For beverages hubby got a regular margarita and I got the famous Avocado Margarita. Growing up Filipino having avocado shakes and eating them with either condensed milk or just milk and sugar was not a strange thing to me. I was excited about this concotion. The best way to describe it is a very creamy margarita. Avocado has a very subtle taste so it doesn t really change the flavor profile very much. I think it enhances it. Our dining companions enjoyed there food as well. One dish was a little better than the other. The Cochinita Pibil was their favorite of the two they ordered.   I would say this restaurant is a hole in the wall  dive place. Totally chill  laid back environment. We were there a while just enjoying our Sunday  food and drinks. Because of the cramped quarters of our dining area I got put in a very awkward position. Since I was the smaller person of my group I squeezed myself into the corner spot and was backed up against the way. The table next to us was very close and our dining neighbor was not so nice. He just took advantage of whatever space he could get leaning back in his chair all up in my business. I was afraid my hair was going to get caught in his chair while he was rocking. He got up to go to the restroom  I adjusted my chair and I moved his chair. When he came same no care in the world jerk taking up all the space he could. I literally had to squeeze my self out. I wanted to elbow the guy so bad. Anyways that s not the restaurants fault but be aware of your space when you re sitting outside.   Overall I think this is a hidden  hole in the wall gem in the south side and I would happily make the trek again to meet my friends.
Curra's Grill,212,I came here to Curra s Grill on Thursday  July 18  2019.  I hadn t been here in a while.  One time  I tried to come in  but there was no parking.  Anyway  I arrived at around 11 00 a.m.  so parking was not a problem.  Prior to arriving  I checked out their website to refamiliarize myself with the menu  and prices .  I was disappointed that Curra s site didn t have a full menu with prices...like most restaurant websites have.  No dice.  I had to look at the Internet for a restaurant menu site.  I found it.  Also  the front of the Curra s website specifically shows  a section that promotes lunch and dinner specials. Before I ordered  I asked the waitress for the lunch specials.  She mentioned there were  none.   Never mind that their own website promotes lunch specials.  I was silently annoyed.  Talk about false advertising    I sit down and decide to order the beef and chicken enchilada plate  along with charro beans.  The service is not the swiftest  I must say.  After a significant while  my order arrives.  I take a couple of bites of one of the enchiladas.  It was kind of lukewarm.  I ask the waitress to send it back.  When the order was finally reheated  the enchiladas were very warm.  I ate slowly.  I really liked the charro beans.  They were hot...and kind of spicy.  My question is   If they don t  have lunch specials....why are they advertised on their own website.  It doesn t make sense.
Curra's Grill,213,I see the reviews about the service and I know that sometimes it s hit or miss there but I ve never had a horrible experience. I think I m a little more forgiving at Curra s though because I moved from Austin to Ohio 15 years ago and it really is hard to find great Tex-Mex in my area. When I come to town Curra s is usually the first place I go and I am not never in a rush to leave. I usually sit on the patio  even though it just faces the parking lot  and drink a margarita  order queso and a plate of tamales and eat way too much. To me  the food is terrific  it s comfort food. It s casual and tasty. I love other Mexican style restaurants for some of their other dishes but I can t pass up Curra s when it comes to my tamale fix. There aren t a lot of places that offer such a variety of tamales. I love the vegetarian or the green chili   bean. I used to go on Thursday nights when they had live music. I once saw a great band called  The Green Cards . I recommend you give this place a try if you love tamales and when you have the time to enjoy it  sit on the patio on a brisk spring day and have brunch  their coffee is fantastic too. It s good for the soul.
Curra's Grill,214,We were here for dinner celebrating my sister s birthday. Our waitress was pleasant  but once we got our bill  we were in for a surprise. We were nickeled and dimed for extras that were never brought out such as cheese on a taco  etc. etc. None of us even brought this to our waitress  attention though and brushed it aside. We brought in a small cake and sang to my sister then were charged a fee for doing so. They never brought this to our attention upon entering with said cake. We tried talking to owner about the cake fee and asked if it could please be waived because we weren t aware of the fee and have never been charged this fee anywhere else. He then proceeded to tell us he would waive the fee if we promised to never come back. Imagine the shock on our faces  We had been nothing but kind and polite throughout our entire dining service. We will NEVER COME BACK  Thank you Jorge  for being so rude during our family s birthday dining experience. We will take our business elsewhere. If I could give this place zero stars  I would.
Curra's Grill,215,One of my go to places for brunch.  Amazing coffee.  And lots of vegetarian options.  Love the Juju plate   
Curra's Grill,216,I had read and heard so many things about this place  that it was the first place we went to when we visited Austin.   When we arrived  we didn t have any of the parking issues that other reviewers had.  We entered  but decided to eat outside since the inside had a very nasty wet rag smell.  The first thing I ordered was the salsa platter as an appetizer. Our server brought chips and salsa instead  and seem to have an attitude once I asked to change it. Since we had heard rhat their shrimp items were delicious  we ordered the Cancun chille relleno as well as the Cancun enchiladas. Of course I also orderd an avocado margarita.  Although the food was just  ok nothing really to brag about   I was disappointed with the service.  Our server did not like the idea of me giving him my phone to validate my check in free offer from Yelp.  Our check came out to  51. My husband and I thought that a  10 tip would be reasonable. However  once we were walking to our car  the server made a very rude comment about the amount of the tip.....  I m not sure if I want to go back  I am pretty sure there are plenty of other places were the servers will be happy with my 20  tip.
Curra's Grill,217,First time here in over a decade and clearly should have been back sooner. The tacos encebollados were wonderful  the coffee dusting much better than expected . Their take on chili cheese fries  fries with chrozo and cheese  were wonderfully satisying and my Avion Caliente may be the best spiked coffee I have ever had. Kids loved their food too.
Curra's Grill,218,Everything about this place is just OK.  I like the food generally  but I wish that there were homemade tortillas and chips  especially when the chips and salsa are not free. They are  free  when you buy queso  guac  salsa sampler  etc. Those things are far more expensive than the   2 for the chips and salsa.  I ve had fajitas and enchiladas and been pleased with my food  but it s overpriced. My husband and I paid nearly  50 for a meal that would have been  35 at another Mexican food place.  The service has never been great. It has taken us about an hour and a half to eat on all three occasions we have been  even though we really could have been out of there in half the time. It takes them so long to take your order  bring your food  bring your check. Seems like it s family run  and I ve often seen our waiter waitress talking and not working.  Overall  I prefer other restaurants in the area  but I can see why this place gets business.
Curra's Grill,219,Im new to the Austin area and I have been craving GOOD HISPANIC food. This was the FOURTH restaurant I ve been too  so before I went I was sure to look at pics online and read the reviews. I said  what the hell  let me try  A waste of my THIRTY DOLLARS  The nachos were weird to me. Half fried corn tortillas with big chunks of chicken and the tamales  one was so hard on one side  that it wasn t edible. Im sorry guys  y all probably do good business  but my food was gross  
Curra's Grill,220,Quaint little Mexican restaurant. Clean with friendly waitstaff hostess. We were seated immediately and approached for drink orders pretty quick. Not Tex Mex but more of your traditional Mexican cuisine. I had the carne guisada enchiladas. Tasty  The avocado margarita was sweet-- really good  and I m not into frozen drinks. I also ordered the chipotle brownie. It was ok but the more I ate it  the better it became. I think hint of chipotle I got at he end of each bite made me like it more. Would have been better with a scoop of ice cream on top. Salsa and chips were really good  Queso was not that great.  Servings were a fairly decent size. I was pleasantly stuffed.
Curra's Grill,221,Came here to have an early lunch with some family. This is the second time I have been here.  As I walked in I was greeted by a nice young man who walked us to our table. Within minutes our server came and dropped off three waters and walked away without saying anything or letting is say anything. After a while I started drinking when a person in my party said I am not drinking that there is something floating in my water.   I then stopped drinking mine and noticed mine also had food stuck inside the cup and then we looked in the third persons drink which no surprise also had food debris in it. We then waited a few minutes for our server who we ended up having to ask someone to find him.   He came barreling out of the back looking upset and got to the table and asked what we needed.   I began to explain the drink situation and before I could finish he grabbed the cups and started walking away. I was still talking during this. I then looked at the other people in my party and we quickly decided to leave.   The server whatever his name was  was horrible and obviously upset.   I doubt I will return here is this is what I have to look forward to.
Curra's Grill,222,We found the barcode sticker on the carne guisada bell pepper     We ordered to go  Beware     They don t was the veggies   
Curra's Grill,223, Where s the Beef  I had a taco plate that should have been with strips of beef but instead it was full of beans  literally I got four pieces of beef and the rest of the taco was beans onion and cilantro  mind you the plate already came with beens on the side  the rice had no flavor  the corn tortillas looked like flour and didn t have a corn tortilla taste  yes you can say it was not a good experience. The price I paid was not worth it at all  2 tacos   10.99.
Curra's Grill,224,The food is not that great it s a little overpriced for what it is. The alcoholic drinks are definitively good though. I will go back for the avocado margarita but not for the food. The service was really slow. If you try this place definitively order drinks. We got the ceviche and it was ok  al pastor tacos were kind of dry and the fajitas were also dry ish the fajitas weren t worth the  20 they skimp on the guac that comes with it  it was a tiny scoop. Overall food is nothing that makes you want to go back to eat here. Good place for drinks and maybe appetizers 
Curra's Grill,225,After I convinced a group of friends we should have dinner  amp  drinks at Curra s I left embarrassed for choosing to go to such a disgusting restaurant. I Found a dead fly stuck to my melted cheese on my Curra s enchiladas plate. It was the single most disgusting thing in the world  I had already eaten my entire plate and I saw the fly on my last bite. Who knows what else I ate without realizing it  Ugh disgusting  it made my stomach turn  amp  I was furious. The server of course didn t charge me for my meal but the entire table of  6  had already lost their appetite. I will never go back to Curra s Grill  amp  I d never recommend it to a friend.
Curra's Grill,226,Solid place for Tex mex on the south east side. The chili con queso was pretty good as well as the beef tacos and enchiladas.
Curra's Grill,227,Incase you don t want to read my rant-  Pros  -Avocado margaritas   Cons  Everything else -Service was terrible -Salsa sampler was disgusting  Took a friend from out of town here because we both wanted to try the avocado margaritas  they were awesome. Definitely recommend   They re  8 just incase any of y all were wondering. However  the service was HORRIBLE. When we sat at the bar waiting for the table  the bartender took 15 minutes to get our margs to us because he was chit chatting with other staff. When we sat down we ordered the salsa sampler  which was DISGUSTING. Don t let the picture fool you like they did me. Half of the  salsas  are sweet or taste like barbecue sauce mixed with j ger and cinnamon. I had to remind our waiter to bring the sampler after 15 minutes of waiting for it. The food was alright  but we could not get over the service. Our waters never got refilled and we had to flag down a different waiter for everything we needed. All in all I won t be back because the service was terrible  but the avocado margs are something special.
Curra's Grill,228,I ve been here many times  but tonight was exemplary. Lee was our server. He was freakin amazing  He was very personable  but still professional and respected our table. He catered to our every need and set expectations correctly. I ll continue to come here  but it is partly motivated by the service received from our server.
Curra's Grill,229,Good food. Good service. Parking lot is small and my kids had to park around the corner. Certainly can t go wrong picking this restaurant for Tex Mex. The ceviche appetizer is worth getting. I ll probably come back next time I m in Austin and in this part of town. They do have an eclectic mix of margaritas and the one I had was tasty. But not very big.
Curra's Grill,230,This is a happening little spot  Great vibe- good service and food is AWESOME   Thanks - glad to find this place  It s a little tight - I wish there was a little more space  and the parking lot sucks - but otherwise on point
Curra's Grill,231,Curra s consistently delivers delicious food and great service. Their enchiladas are some of the best I ve ever had and I always have a great time when I m there. Highly recommend for anyone looking for great Mexican food.
Curra's Grill,232,My favorite Mexican food on the face of the planet    Their moles are out of this world. I make an attempt to eat here every time I m back home in Austin.
Curra's Grill,233,Curra s  what happened to you    Sigh. Such an Austin landmark. My husband and I used to be regulars here. We had bad service a time or two so we started coming here less. We had a hankering for some yummy Curra s cuisines and we were sorely disappointed.   We went for an early dinner  at 5pm . They were very crowded.  We had a back up plan in case they were crowded.  We were seated promptly. And then we waited.. and waited. And waited    Another table was sat and they promptly received service drink orders . We flagged down the waitress that was serving the outside area. Finally got our drink orders in. and then more waiting. sigh. I usually have lots of patience with servers. I understand when you have a big group. I understand when you have more tables than servers. I understand when you are understaffed. However  when that is NOT THE CASE  I get upset because that just means you re lazy and can t handle your 4 tables. Maybe our table was just in that invisible zone  huh   joking  not really joking   The queso that we ordered wasn t a large. So thanks for that overcharge. Thanks for not checking in with us after taking our orders. We had to flag you down many times just to get some extra napkins. And this is with you glancing around and somehow just missing our table.   Curra s  I hope you guys improved on your service. Your food is overpriced and no longer that delicious. It s so sad to see how downhill you have gotten. It s sad that you re such an Austin landmark and you treat your customers like this.
Curra's Grill,234,Delicious  large margarita and not weak. Big portions of food for good price. I was visiting Texas for the first time  I m from the NYC metro area. In general  nothing I had in Texas packed as spicy a punch as what I get around home  but it was tasty. Get the Ceviche appetizer  big enough for up to 4 people 
Curra's Grill,235,Love this place.  Try to visit whenever I am in town.  The margueritas are great.   The chili con carne queso was one of the the best quesos I have tasted and the hot sauce and chips.  Careful if you order this because you can get full before your meal comes because you can t stop eating.  My son had the chicken enchiladas chialapa  I think that is how you spell it  and that was delicious.  The charro beans were excellent.  The rice is really nothing to write home about.  It s not your traditional Mexican rice but more of your Cuban looking white rice. Not a whole lot of flavor.   I ordered the half rotisserie chicken with rice and charro beans.   Chicken was good but small for half a chicken considering the price.  Overall it was delicious and I will be back
Curra's Grill,236, lategram - this is one of our FAVORITE ATX venues all because of these two items - the Juju  breakfast  plate and the delicious  avocado margarita - OMG  So amazing  We always enjoy their service  we love the relaxed  easy going ambiance  amp  the food and drinks are hands down  slap yo momma  good  We love Curra s    
Curra's Grill,237,So I ve heard a lot chat about this place on Yelp about the notorious  avocado margaritas . Sounds creamy and delicious because it is  I d say you should totally try one out.    We went on a Friday evening at about 8 and barely had to wait. Not too shabby. We got sat outside which wasn t awful but the humidity was about 200  and the fan was blowing away from us.... Besides that our waiter was super friendly. And not in a creepy way.   We all got different plates. I ordered the veggie fajitas and they were bomb. The queso was decent and the salsa was SUPER yummy. I d come back solely for the salsa honestly. Like give me a straw   noshame   Anyways  the overall experience I m giving 3 stars. The seating is really crammed  the parking can be a cluster but then again  it is Austin  and I wish they had maybe some more fresher items in the menu  I.e. Salads...   Give it a try. It might be your new favorite authentic Mexican food spot  Cheers
Curra's Grill,238,I m not sure how good the food is or how the amazing sounding avocado margaritas are there  because the moment I sat down on their patio I was swarmed by fire ants and have about twenty bites on my arms  neck and torso. When we reseated ourselves and told the server about the fire ant problem he was nonplussed about the whole situation. Another patron pointed to the wall that had a 12  wide path of fire ants crawling up and down the entire height of the wall. I wouldn t be so upset about it  but when I spoke to the owner about it he just shrugged and walked past me when I told him I had been bitten. He didn t even offer up an apology.  I can forgive so many things  but can t accept an owner who takes the profits of an establishment  but who is not willing to offer up an apology to a person who has been hurt in their restaurant. Bad form Curra s Grill.
Curra's Grill,239,The lamb empanadas were not very good. The queso is average and the asadero enchiladas with chilirio are not bad. The sauce on the enchiladas was the best part.   Wait staff was not very attentive and almost seemed put out by our presence. We had several of the staff make eye contact with us and then ignore us as we were trying to get them to come over to bring us more napkins. I don t think we will be back.
Curra's Grill,240,Overall a good experience- took a bit to get our food  and it s true  they charge for everything. It s a bit on the pricier side for Mexican food in Austin. That being said they do have some authentic dishes not common to many other joints.
Curra's Grill,241,I would have skipped this place due to the powers on Yelp. Goes to show you you can t trust reviews. Curras has great food  drinks and the service has been great. No wonder this place is always busy
Curra's Grill,242,the only place where I ve found red corn tortillas.  Talk about unique  and GOOD   The breakfast tacos are good  and the Oaxacan Coffee is delish  with hints of vanilla.  Waitstaff is a little bit sloppy dressed  but overall a good place to eat.
Curra's Grill,243,Love love this place  Don t miss the avocado margaritas  We had the salsa sampler which was the best I had ever had-the tacos are to die for 
Curra's Grill,244,Food is okay but this place is filthy  Flies all over and their one bathroom is disgusting. Too bad. This place used to be good. I don t know what happened.
Curra's Grill,245,Great food horrible service. Ruined my entire experience. I will never return. From waitstaff to management this place needs to be trained in customer service.
Curra's Grill,246,Oh Curra s. I wanted to like you so badly.   So here we are  I m not sure where to start with this place. As pointed out by other reviewers I don t really feel like this place is    being as I spent almost as much here as at El Naranjo a     restaurant.   We walked in and I asked to be sat outside because the inside has a funky smell  but this becomes a catch-22 being as the outdoor seating has terribly uncomfortable chairs  and a weird table to chair height ratio. Our server was horrible. Like so bad I almost wonder if it wasn t for homophobic purposes.  I was there with my boyfriend  We waited forever for our appetizer and when it arrived it was cold so there s that. I had to flag him down for refills on water and napkins. He stood around a lot a watched television.  a table next to us had dirty dishes on it the whole time we were there   The food was good. Fun twists on your basic tex mex. Enjoyed the Nachos Oaxaca which was our app  would have enjoyed it more if it had been  I don t know  fresh and warm. The mole is actually not good but quite stellar. The blackened fish enchiladas were also good. But that s the thing  all the food was good  good texmex that I would have been totally happy with for  6-8 not  15   and only 2 enchiladas for the price     Their famous avocado marg  the real reason we were there but that was less impressive than the food. Not only have a had better avocado margaritas elsewhere  but even better avocado smoothies other places.  Reading some of the other reviews it seems inconsistency is their biggest issue. So  while I understand that this may have been an off night for them  I won t be back if I can see that this could be a continuous issue. If you re looking for texmex on Oltorf try Habaneros. Where the food is just as good  but for actual texmex prices  and with good service.  Sorry Curra s  I wanted to like you so badlly.
Curra's Grill,247,Blahhhh. Drinks are good. So many other places to go for good Tex mex. Sorry guys but that salsa sampler almost made me vomit looking at it.
Curra's Grill,248,What a fiasco  Came with a party of six  we were seated in the far back of the restaurant in a rickety picnic table. The had bird crap all over the bench  which we had to ask to be cleaned. Then she wiped the top of the table with the bird crap rag. Chips and salsa were good  but no silverware or napkins for 15 minutes at least. The service was gut wrenchingly slow. Drinks stayed empty  dirty dishes piled up. And the restaurant had all but cleared out. The table next to us waited so long and were so annoyed that they complained to the manager.. it took a full two hours for mediocre food  at a disgusting table. Upon leaving they gave us the wrong check. I would have definitely said something but the people I was with just wanted to get out of there. What an awful experience       
Curra's Grill,249,The service was great  the ambience was fun  but the food was meh. Maybe I just don t know how to order here  but I didn t like anything I ate. We were told by a local to try this place out after we raved about the queso at Torchy s Tacos  but I m not sure who would suggest this place to out-of-towners. Nothing we ordered was anything I d ever want to order again. We had vegetarian enchiladas and tacos - neither of which had much flavor. We didn t order drinks  so maybe that s the draw to Curra s  I don t know. Anyway  this was our last meal in Austin  sadly  and we re on our way  as we leave town  to grab some Torchy s queso for the trip home as I write this. Sorry  Curra s  we won t be back  unless it s just for drinks.
Curra's Grill,250,We didn t plan on stopping here  but the place we were going to was closed for renovation. This ended up being a very nice surprise.  We sat outside  they do have sun shades that pull down when it s bright. The table wasn t that clean  there was salsa on it.  The service was good  but the food was even better. We ordered breakfast and if this place wasn t so far away  I would go all the time   I had chorizo with scrambled eggs  refrained beans and flour tortillas. It was delicious and very flavorful. Even better when they has Tabasco I could put on it.  I would recommend checking this place out.
Curra's Grill,251,Food  ambiance  and drinks all A . Chicken mole enchiladas were stellar  a little kick to them but just enough  not overwhelming. 1 2 rotisserie chicken was one of the best I ve had in Austin. If you ve never tried rotisserie chicken before I suggest getting it from here. All in all worth the wait if you can t just walk in. Avocado margaritas will have you singing about this place
Curra's Grill,252,Had a great experience here  been looking for good tex-mex and margaritas place in Austin and i really enjoyed their food and drinks  and omg their  Salsa that they make- wow. Environment could be a little nicer but it was all in all a good time
Curra's Grill,253,If going in a large group be prepared to either split the check evenly or have to figure out how much each person owes since they will not separate or do separate tickets. The food and drinks were great but it took us an extra 20 minutes to figure out the ticket.
Curra's Grill,254,Delicious food  And amazing drinks-the avocado Margarita is an all time favorite   even there alcohol-free avocado drinks are amazing  so far as I m concerned    Just a couple miles south of downtown and a third of a mile from South Congress  Curra s is also in a great part of town 
Curra's Grill,255,Good food and service. Just a bit pricey... Alot   12 plates or above. I was also very disappointed that there s no kids menu. But good Mexican food.
Curra's Grill,256,I really like this place.  Casual  comfortable restaurant with exceptional service both times I went.    The pollo maniaco is incredibly tasty out of the four dishes I ve tried.  The chicken just falls off the bone.
Curra's Grill,257,My coworkers and I were leaving work and were craving margaritas. I heard about their avocado margarita  so I had to check it out. It sounds like a weird combination but it was pretty damn good...very smooth  The food was ok. Nothing that really stood out. I grew up eating Mexican food all the time  in case my name didn t give that away   so it s pretty hard to impress me. Either way  it wasn t bad.  One pet peeve that I had with Curra s is that  they didn t want to split our bill. I absolutely hate it when restaurants do this. I think it s lazy service especially when it s not busy. Too add to it  the waiter seemed a bit agitated when 2 of my coworkers had questions and weren t too sure about their order. He took our order and nodded his head as he walked away.   The restroom is pretty nasty and you have to yank the hell out of the door to get it closed and locked with a latch lock.... reminds me of every bathroom door at Matamoros Mexico  -   Anyway  I can t give them a 2 star only because some of the best Mexican restaurants have smelly restrooms and won t split bills. Those hole in the walss will amaze you at times.  3 stars mainly for their tasty margaritas  reasonable prices  and ok food.
Curra's Grill,258,Stopped by for lunch earlier today. I ordered the Queso Flameado  Tacos al Carbon and the person I m with ordered the Chicken Enchiladas.   Queso Flameado  this was great. It came with grilled peppers and corn tortillas. Very delicious   Tacos al Carbon  The meat was good  although a little overcooked. Refried beans were decent. Enjoyed the plate  but probably wouldn t order the plate again.  Chicken Enchilidas  These were very good. I had a few bites  and enjoyed them much more than Tacos Carbon.   The place wasn t very crowded. It has a cool atmosphere and while it wasn t  great  for lunch  I could see this being a good place for grabbing drinks and light dinner.   My biggest gripe is actually with the menu. At the top of appetizers page it says  Free Chips  amp  Salsa with any order of queso.  Despite this  I was still charged for chips and salsa. I mentioned this to the server  they checked with the manager and informed me that Queso Flameado wasn t included. Not a huge deal  the chips were  3  but if you are going to say it comes with   ANY   queso  you should actually honor it.
Curra's Grill,259, People I trust love this place.   I ve been offering that phrase up a lot  lately - generally to soften the confessions of disappointment that follow.  It s as if I m trying to say   I don t know...maybe it s me    People I trust love Curra s.  Alas  I found their chips to be cardboardesque - terribly dry  flat  and lacking in flavor.  I did enjoy their very fresh-tasting  bright salsa  but it was truly the star of the meal - and the chips were so terrible as to very nearly ruin even that for me.  Plus  they make you pay  1.99 for the chips and salsa here.  Call me spoiled  but I believe that chips and salsa should be the birthright of every diner at a Mexican joint.  I had high hopes for the famous and interesting-sounding avocado margarita.  In the  mind s eye of my tongue  yes  my tongue has a mind of its own   I pictured it to taste elegant and intriguing - similar to a great avocado bubble tea.  After our first sips  Michelle G. proclaimed that it tasted like that 7-Up and lime sherbert punch that was popular back in the 80 s.  She was spot on.  For those of you who were but a glimmer in your parents  eyes back in the 80 s  that punch tasted pretty good  but much like its main ingredient  lime sherbert  it was neither elegant nor intriguing.  For my entr e  I chose the tacos al pastor plate   7.99 .  Sadly  I found the al pastor to be dry  the rice insipid and flavorless  and while the texture of the refried black beans was nice  the flavor left something to be desired.  And just to rub salt on my avocado margarita wounds  our server said to us - after we d ordered  but before we received our food -  Did they mention to you when you came in that we re closing early today  in half an hour    No.  No  they didn t mention that.  People I trust love Curra s.  Maybe I shouldn t trust them so much  anymore.
Curra's Grill,260,First time to try this place  The parking is limited but it s down town Austin so that s expected. The waiter recommended the frozen avocado margarita to me when asked what he prefers. It was good  and very original.   The menu has plenty of option for both entrees and sides. If you are a fan a corn tortillas try their red corn tortillas that are made in house. The food was great  but if you are going with group be prepared to split prices yourself  They cannot split the bill per person. Overall  great experience would go again.
Curra's Grill,261,It was Cinco de Mayo and I wanted a margarita or TEN   It was decided that it was time to revisit Curra s Grill and sit out on the deck  being a very pleasant day. When checking-in on Yelp  I noticed  redeem your check-in offer  1free drink special . Unfortunately  someone forgot to put  soft  in front of drink. Nevertheless  I ordered Marco s Margarita  Maestro Dobel Diamond tequila  Cointreau Noir  triple sec  fresh lime juice and sweet and sour to quench my thirst. Then ordered the queso which was excellent but my only complaint was that the chips were on their way to becoming crumbs. Would have appreciated a basket of whole tortilla chips. My entr e was the Cancun Shrimp enchiladas which had jumbo prawns saut ed with bell peppers  grilled onions  guajillo chilis and pineapple. I could have had another plate for dessert. The enchiladas were awesome   However  I opted for another margarita for dessert. Although Curra s was packed  the service was very good. It was too late when I noticed that they have lamb empanadas so that means that I will be back..
Curra's Grill,262,Been to Curra s 4x w in the past year  my how time flies  and it started out as a 4  star experience  however  my last 2 visits were less than spectacular and  unable to recapture that wow-factor.  Overall I d say 2.5 stars is the call  so we ll be fair and round it up to an  A-OK .    My first visit was great  on a late Saturday night.  A couple of friends and I got queso  Curra s Papas  Tamale Dinner w  red corn tortillas  and some Avocado Margarita action.  The queso was really good but the highlight was definitely the Curra s Papas - fries w  chorizo and mozzarella  it was a large plate fit for a king and plenty for the 3 of us to squander.    I returned at a later date for a repeat of those Curra s Papas - - it was the same as before  just as good  and the tall blonde skinny volleyball waitress was very courteous and nice.    Next visit was breakfast several weeks ago w  some friends.  I got the Huevos Motulenos  2 eggs w  refried black beans  chipotle sauce  fried bananas   and they got the Huevos Montados  2 eggs w  corn tortillas   sauteed onions   borracho sauce .  My friends  from Chicago  were so excited to try these dishes  however  in the end we were a bit underwhelmed.  The quality  they say  just wasn t there  and my Motulenos sounded appetizing but fell short on taste.  It wasn t bad  just wasn t that good.     Enter my last visit  a late night stop for a repeat of those Curra s Papas.  When they came out in a timely manner something was very noticeable......this baby that was fit for 3 is now good for 2  the portion shrank..  Whereas before it was served heaping on a round plate these came on an oval plate and were....flat.  The waiter re-emphasized it was a hefty portion  but you can t fool a foodie - it was definitely less than my prior experiences  although I still had leftovers to take home.  Maybe Curra s has a new cook in training  or they re trying to add to their bottom line by stretching their inventory.  Service was friendly  although he didn t fill my water.     Quite a disappointment because I do like Curra s and often recommend it to my out of town friends  however  I m a bit puzzled at this point.  I m thinking if my craving for Curra s Papas comes along I may give them another shot to confirm and see how that goes.  I m hoping it was an off night.
Curra's Grill,263,So we stopped by here for dinner on Saturday during the photo scavenger hunt.  I d been once before but couldn t remember if I liked the food.  Our waitress was cute  but she wanted to play Musical Cups with our drink orders.  Here s how it went down   Dave and I each ordered an iced tea.  Tara H. ordered a Diet Coke  and Edison a Dr. Pepper.  Edison got my iced tea and I ended up with water  which no one ordered  so we switched.  Tara thought her Diet Coke was Dr. Pepper  so she gave it to Edison  who confirmed that it actually was Diet Coke.  - Are you still with me  -  Edison reordered his Dr. Pepper  and I got up to use the restroom.  When I came back to the table  I saw that my iced tea had magically turned into water again.   I know I need to drink more water  but come on    But at least Edison finally got his Dr. Pepper.  And I managed to get my iced tea back.  I ordered the fried fish tacos  which were quite good.  I liked that it came with pineapple.  Whatever the sauce was  it was good  too.  The only problem I had was when my second taco completely fell apart on first bite.  It simply did not want to be eaten.  But I showed it... I shoved that taco in my face and chomped away.  So THERE 
Curra's Grill,264,OK... one of the best places in town for a hangover breakfast. lunch. brunch   I never knew they MADE their own tortillas or about the red corn ones until today. It is like getting a red chili enchilada as a bonus in your taco.   I had the Huevos Curra s  eggs over Carne Guisada  with the red corn tortillas and made great breakfast tacos out of those with my refried black beans.   My friend had the Carnitas  they make them with OJ and Coca Cola. I managed to get a small taste... sweet and perfect.   Of course I cannot pass up the Avocado Margarita.   I took a half dozen of the red corn tortillas to go.   Also - some of the best service yet from Mario  George Clooney s Spanish brother   
Curra's Grill,265,Favorite.  This is my brothers favorite as well as several of my friends.  Their Mexican can t be beat.  Where to start.... The pork is sooo good  carnitas taco plate  al pastor refried black bean tostadas and the con Chile Colorado are all amazing.  Even their enchiladas are mouth watering  the borracho sauce is great   Tamales are HUGE.  And you can t leave out the avocado Margarita - it ll add up your bill though.    If you haven t been here yet  go now.
Curra's Grill,266,I have to say that hands-down this was the best mol  sauce I ve ever had in my life. The. Best. The tortillas are fresh. The salsa is tasty. The staff was friendly and attentive. My family and I will definitely come back the next time we are in Austin.
Curra's Grill,267,I really can t decide whether I want to give this place 4 or 5 stars... it was REALLY good   I went with two other friends and we were greeted promptly by our waiter. I never caught his name but he was very patient and helpful.   Of course I had to try the avocado margarita. It was some weird shizzzz. It was essentially an avocado milk shake  but they didn t skimp on the tequila. I kinda liked it  kinda didn t. It was  8  which seemed pretty steep. But it s their signature drink so I figured it was fine. I m glad I tried it  but next time I m going with a Mexican martini  Or just a regular margarita.   Anyway  I went with Mark F. s advice and ordered the enchilladas con chile Colorado. It was melt in your mouth  cheezy oozy goodness. The pork was very tender and there were big chunks of it atop the enchillada filled with smooth  delicious cheese.  I got a little carried away and left several pictures for people to feast their eyes on...   The rice was moist and yummy  and the chipotle sauce covered the entire plate making the rice extra flavorful.  One of my friends ordered the tacos carnitas  marinated in coca cola  milk  and oj... super weird sounding but very delicious  and she loved them  And the other ordered the enchilladas with verde sauce. I had to steal a taste because I heard that they won some award for their verde sauce. It was spicier than I was used to  but quite YUM.   I also learned that you have to pay for chips and salsa. At first I was turned off by this... but then again I was a little relieved. I have no self control and I always get carried away with eating the whole basket of chips and not being hungry for my actual dinner. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise.   I will certainly be back to try more unique and exciting dishes. The ceviche looks fantastic and I can t wait to try it 
Curra's Grill,268,Unless you re a vegetarian  you have no excuse for ordering anything else on the Curra s menu except the enchiladas curras   the ones with cheese and carne guisada sauce  and a side of refried black beans. This dish is melt-in-your mouth perfection -- by far the best enchiladas I ve ever had in Austin.  My one complaint -- and I feel like I m channeling my grandmother here -- is that it s always a little off-putting when Mexican restaurants charge you  2 for mediocre chips  amp  salsa...especially when your server doesn t mention this fact when she oh-so-brightly asks  chips and salsa   as soon as you sit down.
Curra's Grill,269,Not really sure what has happened to this place but it seems to have gone downhill quite a bit  At least the service has really gone down hill... I wouldn t be able to tell you about the food because our server was so bad we got out of there before ordering any food. we sat down for happy hour... Ask the waiter about happy hour specials to which he replied it s  .75 off everything. I asked if there was a drink menu  or happy hour food specials to which he replied no. All the drinks are listed in the back of the regular food menu  none of the drinks have any pricing and the server couldn t tell us what the prices of anything on the menu were. After getting past the initial annoyance and shock of this place not having a single price on their drink menu and the server not knowing the prices of anything  I decided just to order.  I asked for a reposado margarita on the rocks  I wasn t specific about which rep  I wanted  though I told him something like cazadores would be fine. He came back with a small rocks margarita  it wasn t terrible but certainly not what I had in mind and at that point I didn t want to ask anymore questions I just wanted to enjoy my happy hour. My friend ordered a Mexican Martini type thing that had pineapple juice in it. She asked how much the drink cost but the waiter was unsure  he replied  I think it s about  9.50 ... Okay so then with hh price that should be  8.75... SHOULD be... But when we got the bill and it turns out her drink was actually  11 and it was not on special for happy hour. My bill reflected a regular house margarita  at  4  which would explain why it was not the tasty reposado margarita I was hoping for. When I mentioned it to the server all he said was  our house margarita is made with a reposado   though he didn t know which one. At that point we didn t really care we just wanted to get out of there. We paid our bill and went somewhere else to finish our happy hour and eat.
Curra's Grill,270,This place was great  The margaritas are suburb...you can get them without all of that fake sweet  amp  sour mix. Tried the avocado  original  and skinny. My favs were the avocado  amp  original. Not too sweet. Had the nachos w  shrimp as an appetizer and they honored my request for no cheese but they were still awesome  This place was very close to my hotel  amp  I went twice during my 3 night stay. Outdoor seating and right beside the SOCO district.
Curra's Grill,271,Very busy in evenings  an older joint and a bit run down.  Food is pretty good  but nothing to write home about.  I got chicken fajitas and the meat was good and salty  which I like   the rest of the meal of beans and lettuce and what not was so bland.  There are other places in Austin for good Mexican food and I will probably give them a shot.  Again  nothing wrong here just nothing amazing either.  Also to me the avocado margarita looks disgusting.
Curra's Grill,272,Curra s is some kind of Austin staple apparently. Usually  you ll be able to get an open table or two even at the busies of brunch times as my group did. Service is pretty quick and attentive.   I keep getting the Aliss which is two eggs with tomato and peppers on top of your choice of meat. I go with the carne guisada and get a side of the borracho sauce  a tangy tomato based sauce.   Curra s is pretty cheap and filling. Their Oaxacan coffee isn t bad either  and they ll give you as many refills as you want.
Curra's Grill,273,I felt dissapointed after eating here because I was expecting a great experience from all the rave reviews but my visit was far from that. It was not only the food that was lackluster  but the service was horrible.   Let me start with the service  we went there as a group of 8 so I understand that it can be a lot but the only time we saw our waiter was when we ordered and when he dropped off the food. There were no water refills or anything and even flagging down one of the other waiters was a chore. If it was a busy night I would have been more understandable but it wasn t and it was very frustrating overall.  For the food and drinks  I don t understand the hype about the avacado margarita. I was hella excited to try it but it was MEH  There was nothing avocado-y about it and it wasn t even great as a normal margarita. Am I missing something  Everyone I talk to raves about the avocado margaritas at curra s and I ve seen it on so many top margarita lists but it was such a HUGE LETDOWN. For the food  we got their salsa sampler  not sure wht tie correct name was  and it came out with a bunch of salsas just ladled on a plate similar to ethiopian food. Within 5 minutes of getting it  the salsas were all getting mixed...would have been so much better if they had come out in small bowls. Also  with a group of 8  the way it was presented made it really hard to try and there was no explanation as to which salsas were what  missing waiter . For the main course I got the veggie enchiliada and my friend had the chile relleno...forgot what the rest of the group got. Both were bland  flavorless and my enchiladas were watery. Overall  I don t think I ll ever be going back here again seeing as Austin has no lack of good mexican food.
Curra's Grill,274,One of my top five favorite Tex-Mex places in town. I LOVE that they have lots of seafood options. My favorites are the ceviche--a perfect light dinner on a hot summer night--and the blackened snapper enchiladas. SO tasty.   The margaritas are just right and the queso with vegan chorizo is the bizzzzzomb.  I d give it 5 stars except the parking sort of sucks and the service can be spotty.   But still  4 stars isn t bad for a place that once housed a mini mart.
Curra's Grill,275,My wife is all about breakfast. It s bananas. We could wake up at 3PM and she would still want eggs and pancakes. Our 1st day in Austin  we woke up around noon and desperately needed nourishment. We wound up at Curra s and were seated immediately. What a coincidence it was that on the menu it actually said    The 2 Things one should never eat before Breakfast  Lunch and Dinner.   We got a kick out of that. So my girl and I ordered a mimosa and a mexican coffee  respectively. Awwww yeah. That s how we roll while on vacay. Four bucks got her a half full champagne flute of orange juice with a cherry in it  a small bottle of bubbly  and a separate rocks glass full of oj for refills. That s like 3 mimosas for half what we d pay for one in New York. When we stopped freaking out about this fact  we ordered food.  I got the Migas with added cheese and refried beans. This was the first day of the rest of my life. Migas are the greatest breakfast ever and my new goal in life is to eat this for breakfast as much as possible. The tortilla chips  peppers  onions and cheese were incredible. Curra s migas have a LOT of peppers in them but I m into that sorta thing.   For good measure I also got a breakfast taco with chorizo  egg and cheese. There s something about Chorizo  Egg  and Cheese. Texas hasn t seen 3 stars that play this well together  since Tim Duncan  Tony P  and Ginobli started winning championships.   My wife got the Huevos Rancheros. These were also amazing. Maybe not on the same level as the migas but close. The food was so good that we excused the very slow and inattentive service and came back the next day. I would highly recommend this place for fans of traditional Mexican breakfast.
Curra's Grill,276,This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. If you are visiting from out of town  this is where the locals go for genuine Mexican food. It is owned by a lovely family. The carnitas are my favorite and my wife loves the chicken mole. And you must try the frozen avocado margarita  a Curra s original 
Curra's Grill,277,Oh dear. After such wonderful  amazing  unparalleled food at Curra s Grill on Burnet  I had high expectations for the original Curra s on Oltorf. Everyone raves about the place. We were so excited to try it  Maybe that was the problem.  The place was packed. Good. A crowded house makes for a better atmosphere  most of the time . We were seated at the only table left indoors. Unfortunately  it was directly - and I mean directly - in front of the line order pick-up window order computer system. Our ambiance for the evening quickly became the hiss of fajitas and slam of plates as orders came up. This would have been fine  but it didn t stop there. The manager on duty felt the need to  quietly  yell and heckle his wait staff to be faster and to make sure they charged tables who asked for extra sauce. Ugh.  Oh well  we thought  the food is worth it  Curra s can t be beat. We started with a Queso Flameado with mushrooms. I can t cook and I know nothing about food prep  but the queso was horrible. We might as well have ordered 1 large melted mass of cheese with a 1 2 inch layer of grease. To add fuel to the fire  the queso dish cost  7.00 and we didn t  qualify  to receive free chips and salsa  you have to order one of their other appetizers or pay  2 . In a city where people throw chips and salsa at you  I can t justify paying for it.  The vegetarian enchiladas are consistently excellent. Curra s rice is absolutely fantastic...the best I ve had in Austin. The black beans are also very good. I would still recommend Curra s to people  and I have yet to try their brunch  which is supposedly divine.  Curra s claims to be  the Mother of all Mex . Their food is usually awesome  but I ve now bad service experiences at two locales. I hope they were isolated incidents.  Curra s has a third location on Parmer.   Tepid now  but I m keeping my fingers crossed for my next visit.
Curra's Grill,278,I stop at Curra s every time I come to town.  The Margaritas are fantastic as is the food. Everyone is so nice also. You can t go wrong there 
Curra's Grill,279,Absolutely delicious food and the avocado margarita is a must try  The variety salsa plate is also pretty great. Fun fact  Chips and salsa are NOT free unless you buy queso or guacamole so buy a SMALL guacamole and it s the same price as the salsa and chips so you essentially get it for free 
Curra's Grill,280,So this time my experience wasn t nearly as good as last time. The food was good  not amazing. My biggest issue this time was the service.   The food took a long time to come out and the restaurant wasn t that crowded. That wouldn t have matter as much if we didn t always have empty waters and and an empty chip bowl while we waited. We rarely saw our server. I was pretty disappointed this trip   . Luckily the chile con queso was still awesome when we actually had chips to eat it with.
Curra's Grill,281,There was a wait  but it moved fast and we were seated within 10-12 minutes. It s a little loud in the dining room and the tables are really wide so I felt like I couldn t hear my dining companion  but no biggie.  I ordered the  award winning  veggie enchiladas that came with rice and beans and an avocado margarita. Both EXCELLENT. She ordered a diet coke and fish tacos that came with rice and beans that she said was pretty good though a little dry. We split chips and guacamole that was super creamy and very tasty classic-style  Ordered a flan to go that was out of control delicious   I would come back for the enchiladas and to try other plates  Our server and host were very attentive and friendly as well.
Curra's Grill,282,Don t get the enchiladas. I m 31 years old and I ve never had enchiladas like this. The ground beef was the first put off  and there was potato in it  but I could deal with this. But the sauce was chunky. Chunky   Why TF is enchilada sauce chunky  I thought they had given me the wrong sauce. They were nice enough to take it off my ticket and the queso was good. But I can think of few things worse that a weird chunky sauce full of who knows what.
Curra's Grill,283,Amazing  Love  Love  Love the avocado margarita is delicious. We really enjoyed the salsa tasting platter   It s not your tourist spot and a tad off the path but fun for foodies who like to try new things 
Curra's Grill,284,I don t quite understand Curra s.  I was told that their breakfast tacos were amazing but I just can t like them.  The tortillas have a weird consistancy and flavor and they dry my mouth out too much.   The chips they give you also taste like nothing.  I keep trying to like this place but I just can t  I m sorry 
Curra's Grill,285,One of my all time faves and was just what the doc ordered after a long SXSW Saturday.  The carne guisada was just like Mom used to make and service was wonderful as always.  Will be back for breakfast and that Oaxaca coffee soon 
Curra's Grill,286,I came here with my guys from work. Man I was amazed at how much food they give you. I was really full and had to take some back to the work place to finish it up later. I order the tamale dinner. You can get it with four or six tamales. I am glad I chose four because they were huge  I mean my tape worm was in heaven with just two tamales. The charro beans are right on and the Mexican rice was like mom s home cooked rice  The staff is very attentive and make sure you re drinks are filled. They even have a little bar to get drinks from.
Curra's Grill,287,One of our go-to Mexican restaurants. Literally  we eat here 3-4 times a month.   The GOOD  the food is consistently solid. Some favorites are the refried black beans  fried plantains  al pastor tostada plate  the breakfast tacos  on red corn tortillas    and the veggie enchiladas with green sauce.  The BAD  they nickle and dime for everything. Chips and salsa  That will cost you. To-go order  That will cost you extra. The drinks don t have listed prices  why  because they are expensive.  Overall  we love the food. This place would make more fans if they didn t try to squeeze    from every sale.
Curra's Grill,288,Food is ok  a bit on the greasy side.  Service is friendly.  Restaurant looks dirty  grime  dirt  roaches .   What s your threshold on the number of roaches that you see strolling by while you eat   If that number is three roaches or fewer  then don t look around because I ve seen at least 3 on each of my visits.    The location is convenient for me  so I ve given Curra s a pass.  But the goods do not outweigh the bads. The place needs a thorough power wash.  I ve worked in restaurants before  and know that every place has bugs--especially in Austin.  I d rather not have the roaches pull up a stool and hang out while I m chowing down though. . Maybe it s just me.  The avocado Margarita everyone raves about is just plain strange.  Like a thick vegetable smoothie with booze. . I haven t been able to get past a few sips. Well  this IS Austin  so that drink definitely meets the weird criteria.  Not what I look for in a drink though.  I ll keep the avocado in my tacos  thank you.
Curra's Grill,289,Curra s was the first Mexican Restaurant I went to when visiting Austin before I moved here.  Every time I come in for a visit I always remember that first trip and sitting on the patio with my friends drink an Avocado Margarita   Everything on the menu is great  but for me my two favorites are the Avocado Margarita and the Tamales. I m in heaven every time.
Curra's Grill,290,Ol  Rooster recently has recently looked beyond the traditional Tex-Mex and tried to find the mysteries of interior Mexico. My focus is primarily mole  each one being unique and usually a family recipe passed down for generations. A few days ago  I dragged mom who works a few blocks away into Curra s for lunch.   I m a child of South Austin via Hays County. After my first visit  I m sad I hadn t visited prior. I blame that on a guy I used to work with who also worked for Curra s part time and always steered me away claiming  refrigeration issues  would be the end of the restaurant. I waited another ten years just to make sure I wasn t gonna hurl eight hours later.   The chips weren t worth paying extra for which we did. We paid extra for charro beans as well. Why  Tiny bits of meat jacks up the price  Regardless  we had a good visit starting with the well documented avocado margarita. Healing property rumors aside  it was a good mixture with mi madre noticing the waitress dumping avocado into the blender.   The mole chicken enchiladas proved a good plate. Hints of chocolate with subtle spice notes paired well with the white rice. Mom liked her chipotle cream version of the vegetable enchiladas. One suggestion for the management  when you have almost a dozen sauces put it on a side menu or insert. Our waitress who was a gringo from Boston made it thru four options before we became bored of the descriptions.   Overall a good visit considering the space. The digs could be fixed up  like no Longhorn duct tape holding the vinyl in the booth together. Its rustic I suppose  maybe that s just fine for West Oltorf next to a former used car lot where a sales guru tried to sell me a VW Corrado with a busted ignition.  If you lift up on the key while turning it starts  a safety feature   400 fix  that nobody knows about but you .
Curra's Grill,291,Yes the avocado margaritas are wonderful  and I would go JUST FOR THOSE  but it s also really awesome that they have so many vegetarian options on the menu. Their veggie enchiladas are absolutely delicious  I highly recommend them   It s a little odd that they charge for chips and salsa though  that s my only gripe.
Curra's Grill,292,Found this place from a blog that was listed as a  regular favorite  but was a bit disappointed. As soon as we walked in the door we were hit by a strong odor of bathroom cleaning supplies so immediately requested to sit outside.  Not the restaurant s fault  but the weather that day was very hot and it felt suffocating outside . Later on I also heard someone else complaining to staff about the smell.   I ordered the Tacos Vegetarianos Plate but the chorizo was very dry and the dish overall just didn t mesh. Not sure if the chef really taste-tested the dish  the ingredients just don t seem to go together. My refried beans on the side were also dried out. The diced tomatoes were bland  maybe not fully ripe. Had expected them to be sweeter and more flavorful  especially in the southern climate.   Was expecting more from a Mexican restaurant near the border but I ve had much better food up north 
Curra's Grill,293,Kinda disappointing. Sort of average tex mex with nothing super memorable though I must note that our server was super nice and brought us out this really great super salsa plate sampler that let us try a little of everything.  I think in the end  the bummer was that my carnitas was kinda dry. Sigh.
Curra's Grill,294,I m usually a very easy customer but when I went to Curra s I felt like I was one pain in the ass customer. However  Mariah was so patient with me  she ended up winning me over many times over that evening.   Mariah was one of the best severs I ever had. When we got there  we checked in on Yelp and got free non-alchohic drinks  soda or agua fresca . Then I asked her if she can recommend some dishes. She took her time to go through the 10-page menu with us and explained what she loves and what it was. Then I told her its our first time at the restaurant  she instantly got us a basket of chips  usually  2 but she gave it to us  and a plate with a sample of every sauce in the house for us to try so we can figure out what we like or didn t like. After I figured out which ones I liked she told me those sauces goes with enchiladas and tamales. Then I told her I actually don t like enchiladas and tamales. So she asked what kind of mexican food do I usually like. I told her that I like rice and meat. So she went back to the kitchen and got me 2 additional samples of the meats she recommends. Out of the two I liked the chile colorado. It was like a tomato beef stew. Delicious  btw. After we were finally settled and got our food  she checked in with us many times to make sure everything was ok and that we were happy with our food. Not once did she lose her patience or her smile.        My gf ended up with the blackened fish tacos. They were delicious. It tasted really fresh and the fish had a great smokey flavor to it.   They give refills on soda and agua fresca. I had the mango agua fresca  it tasted like boxed juice so I don t recommend it.  We also tried their famous avocado margarita. It was just ok. Nothing was special about it. Tasted like a regular margarita but just creamier.  Food is great  service was even better and prices are super reasonable. I had a fantastic experience here.
Curra's Grill,295,I went here solely for the avocado margaritas and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was  margaritas too . I had the jalapeno relleno- stuffed with cheese  black beans and rice on the side- red corn tortillas came with it as well. It s on the appetizer menu but it was a meal for me  My boyfriend ordered the carnita tacos- yum. We enjoyed the food and drinks so much we came back the next night. Service was good  parking was awful- but that is a city issue not the restaurants. I ll be back.
Curra's Grill,296,Food is amazeballs    I had enchiladas curra s. The meal was so perfect and cheesy. The rice  love the veggies in em   and beans are on point  I even used a free drink check in to get a hot chocolate cause it was chilly out. I do think my server may have been on heavy painkillers or something because ...I dunno something wasn t all there ya know  Nonetheless  food is goooood 
Curra's Grill,297,A stop at curra s is always on my itinerary when I m in Austin. It s one of a kind  Great food and Rita s
Curra's Grill,298,Service was great. Food was solid. Ordered tamales - four per plate  portions were stupidly big. Will absolutely come again  will probably do a pickup order for a mess of tamales at some point.
Curra's Grill,299,One of my faves in So. Austin  Great house margaritas no mixes all fresh  Food is always great. They serve fried plantains to die for  You won t be disappointed
Curra's Grill,300,   Top 3 Tex-Mex restaurants in Austin.  Curra s Grill is classic delicious Tex-Mex. Located in South Austin it s a tiny restaurant with an outdoor patio and it s always busy and well worth the wait. The best item on the menu is the Enchiladas Con Chile Colorado which is pork tips with jack cheese and it s covered in a delicious chipotle sauce. The chips are on demand and a great way to enjoy the patio while chatting with friends.  Tourist nots  The most famous item is the avocado margarita  and it s the one item that I ve had there that I would say it s just above average  but it s well worth trying at least once especially for all those avocado lovers.
Curra's Grill,301,It s good  it s cheap  I d definitely go back  but no really for the food. The portions are nice  the drinks are good and inexpensive  staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice. Don t go expecting any amazing Mexican or Tex-mex food... but enjoy everything else. The avocado margarita is delicious  but since it is frozen  it is sort of heavy...
Curra's Grill,302,This was a pleasant surprise. I came here with a friend after the original place we were going to was closed...  When you walk in  it feels like a Mexican diner with a nice divey feel. The food was anything but divey. I cannot speak for any other dish but the cochinita pibil and please  do yourself a favor and order it. You re welcome.  I am normally one to hop around a menu trying various things  but I can t see myself ordering anything else other than the cochinita pibil on future visits. The pork was succulent  tender  packed with flavor  the sauce is amazing  it tasted home cooked as if grandma had been cooking it all day.  Our server  I think his name was Richard  was fantastic as well.
Curra's Grill,303,The ceviche is literally unthawed frozen fish on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce. That s really all you need to know.
Curra's Grill,304,So a friend saw Rob Balen s review on TV and wanted to go here.  I missed the review so arrived with no preconceived notions.  We went on a Sunday at around 1 30. Not too crowded.  Easy to find a seat.  Weather was nice so lots of people were sitting on the patio.    The salsa and chips were okay.  Salsa was a little spicy  but chips were mostly broken.    Our waiter was nice  although not as attentive as I like.  We ordered the salsa sampler  which is free and a great way to try out their sauces before you order your meal   but he forgot to put in the order  so we waited about 15 minutes and then he came back  realized he d forgotten  and placed the order.  It arrived in about 5 minutes.  He came out and explained all of the sauces to us.  Our favorites were the mole  tomatillo  avocado  and poblano sour cream.   I ordered the Tacos Al Pastor  pork served with cilantro  onions  pineapple  and avocado sauce  and recommended by the waiter  and my friend ordered the Tacos Carnitas  pork marinated in Coca-Cola  milk  and orange juice then fried  and recommended by Rob Balin .  We decided to order our tacos in one corn and one flour tortilla so we could try both.  Both meals come with beans and rice  but beware  if you order Charro Beans they tack on an extra 99 cents  although they may not tell you that  it s on the menu though .    The flavor of both orders was good  although I preferred the Tacos Carnitas over the Tacos Al Pastor.  We also preferred the flour tortillas over the corn.  Food was tasty  but didn t make me scream  Oh my God  I HAVE to come back here.     My friend also ordered the avocado margarita to give it a try.  Unusual flavor  kind of a dreamsicle with something strange in it.  Not worth the  8 they charge.  So  if someone said Hey  let s go to Curras  I d probably go again.  But if someone said  Hey let s go out to eat  where do you want to go   I d say Sazon  which is also Interior Mexican .  Margaritas there are  5 and the pipian sauce is to die for.
Curra's Grill,305,I took a group of work colleagues here after I heard about the avocado margarita that I had to have.   Overall  the service was pretty attentive  though I had to wait for 5 minutes for sour cream  maybe they were making it     the space was great for a group  the food came out pretty fast and when some things tasted just fine  others tasted great. The avocado margarita falling somewhere in between. It s just fine. Though I think I could make a better one  it definitely made me feel better about drinking a margarita.   As for the food  the queso was delicious and the special got great reviews. I ordered the famous veggie enchiladas and the guacamole  were just fine. However  I did enjoy the red bean tortillas.  So overall  this is just another Tex-mex  bordering on Mexican restaurant whose x-factor is the avocado margarita. I would not travel out of my way to go there again.
Curra's Grill,306,When I moved to east riverside  I was quickly on the hunt for restaurants in my area. I had been here once before working a promo  so I decided to check it out.  This has a very fun and young atmosphere. They are famous for their avocado margaritas.   I give them 4 stars only because chips and salsa are an additional 2.50--which I think should be free at a Mexican restaurant.  Always a great place to go with friends that is just down the street from me.
Curra's Grill,307,Tampiquena was incredible. Everything looked great. Wide variety of margaritas  all generous and well made. Chips are a little thin and processed. Old diner atmosphere is typically Austin roadhouse casual.
Curra's Grill,308,Lot s of good options for the no-meat-but-fish crowd. We had a giant heaping of  6 guac and chips to start things off. I ordered the blackened fish tacos  which were less spicy flavorful than other similarly prepped fish I ve had in TX  but the rice  beans  mango  chipotle cream sauce added plenty of flavor.
Curra's Grill,309,Authentic delicious Mexican food in a convenient spot in South Austin  right off Oltorf.  1. The food was really good  I was also told it s very authentic by my Mexican friends. 2. The Avocado Margarita was really good  but I did not find it as amazing as the reviews made it sound. Still  really good and worth a try. 3. The Currita Margarita was really weird - sour and strange but still pretty good  4. I ordered the Cochinita Pibil which was very flavorful and the tortillas were great. 5. The beans did not impress me though as they were cold and rather flavorless. 6. The server did not bring me silverware which was pretty annoying. 7. This place is super busy all the time so try to avoid the rush.  Overall 4 stars.
Curra's Grill,310,On my first visit to Austin  my hosts were raving about the avocado margaritas here - and they were RIGHT  They were the absolute best avocado margaritas I have EVER had. The guacamole was just OK but we still enjoyed it. I also tried one of their regular spicy margaritas and loved how fresh every drink tasted. Would definitely recommend stopping here 
Curra's Grill,311,Food is amazing. Drinks are amazing. Super loud inside though - have sat in several spots now and it s almost impossible to hold a conversation with anyone because you can t hear each other. Staff has always been just ok  but the food makes up for it. If you can sit outside it s better.
Curra's Grill,312,No idea what happened yesterday while dining here.. Our waitress was a bitch then disappeared after we put our order in... I hope she got fired...  Then the host brought us our food  which was cold  and forgot the corn tortillas I ordered  and some random guy closed our tab..   Now as a person who has waitresses before this place was unprofessional and seemed to be flopping  however  this was just MY experience  every other table seemed to have impeccable service.    The reason the have 2 stars and not one is because my husband actually like the food. I thought it was cold and salty... And the fish  snapper  was really fishy and cheap tasting...   This was the weirdest experience to have in a restaurant in a long time.
Curra's Grill,313,Definitely a must here in Austin  I m glad that this is one of the first brunch places I went to when I first moved here. The food is great  the atmosphere is awesome and the service was phenomenal. Can t wait to come back soon.
Curra's Grill,314,Unfortunately this review is based entirely on the treatment we just received from the hostess. We walked in and told her it would be four  she glanced around the room and shrugged her shoulders and said  we don t have tables for four . Truly  there weren t any tables available so that wasn t the problem  though her dismissiveness was odd. Then she asked if we wanted to put our name down on the  empty  wait list. When we asked how long the wait would be she said  ummm... It could be 20 minutes... It could be 40     It was the strangest encounter I ve ever had with a hostess and she made us feel like we were not welcome for some reason. We left pretty quickly after that.  UPDATE  there is a DELICIOUS little joint 0.5 miles down the road - Habaneros. Great food  great prices  great service. Go there instead
Curra's Grill,315,The food is decent. Not great  not terrible. The main issue with Curra s is their deceptive pricing. I called in an order for pickup and the order was  20 more than expected. When I asked why  turns out the pricing on their site is outdated  AND they charge a 10  to-go fee. Whaaaa  How  Sway  Steak fajitas for 2 and a beef burrito was  49.99  dead serious  this was the price . If you live at the District at Soco  never give this place your money.
Curra's Grill,316,Reasonably priced and so good for a casual Mexican breakfast  Love the fresh mango juice. So many things I wanted to order on the menu  Settled on the eggs  amp  retried beans over tortilla with plantains and a side of buracho sauce for some kick.  Full and happy 
Curra's Grill,317,Yesterday at 1 17pm    Curra s Grill i am a regular about 4-6 tomes a month however i will not stand any eatery that treats folks much less the disabled as poorly as I was by what i believe to one its owners there were clean open tables that he not would seat me or the other disabled person we were told to wait out side with Everyone else which is not a solution i do not write this for me but any disabled person they have done wrongly they said thet were short staffed that does not mean tho seats were not empty and it was gonna be our turn any way not matter how ggod the coffee was so i wonder did this person have a stroke and not know better or were the true colors of his Biz finally coming to light if any one know the true owner i am willing not to escalate until i hear from them however if i am not contacted one way other the other i will have no option but to seek justice thru newspapers TV etc leading to a possible boycott willing to listen to reason if they have a good one until that time i am ashamed of every   i have given them
Curra's Grill,318,I was born and raised in S. Austin and I m so sad to see this restaurant have such horrible customer service. Very disappointed. Parking is a nightmare.
Curra's Grill,319,First  let me say  that I moved to Austin in the 70 s to go to school here  so I have eaten my share of Mexican food in this town. Curra s Grill is by far  my favorite Mexican food destination in central Texas. Honestly  I rarely eat Mexican food anywhere else.  I almost ALWAYS get the Blackened Fish enchiladas  made with red snapper. Every once in a while they are out of red snapper  and that s always a bummer. The blackened fish enchiladas come with a chipotle sauce  which is good  but I always opt for the borracho sauce instead.  I also usually ask for half the amount of cheese to make the dish a little lighter and to save room for chips and hot sauce. Curra s borracho hot sauce is the best sauce in Austin I think  very unusual  very flavorful  and very hot. I think it has carrots in it. It s so  so good.  The fish tacos plate is also great  when I don t want all the extra carbs of the enchilada dish. It has no cheese and comes with fresh fruit.  And for breakfast  the migas are excellent. You can even get veggie chorizo added for an added thrill. Just don t forget to order plenty of borracho sauce and extra corn tortillas  But honestly  I ve gone in for breakfast before and couldn t resist ordering the blackened fish enchiladas. They are THAT good   BTW  The wait staff is usually very nice. One time we went and our waiter hooked us up with a beautiful array of all the hot sauces they offer. I had to take a picture because it was so beautiful. Check it out.
Curra's Grill,320,While in Austin for a few days was craving authentic mexi and yelped a good dive to head to and came across Curra s so glad we did   Our service was spot on terrific and the burritos were to die for   We each had three of the famous Avocado Margaritas followed by going back to hotel for a nap in our food coma state  
Curra's Grill,321,We love Curra s for breakfast  lunch or dinner....it s great whenever.  First timers should ask for a free avacado margarita - it s delicious.  Also ask for a  sauce sampler  in which they present all of their wonderful home-made sauces on a plate to help you learn the menu.  It s easy for people of varying dietary needs to eat here. Vegetarian options are as delicious as meaty versions  actually  the veggie chorizo queso is sinply divine.
Curra's Grill,322,Enjoyed dinner here last night with some friends. Service was on the less than responsive side - the waiter could certainly be accused of lacking table-side manners. Food was good. Frankly  after three days in Austin  with plenty of eatery experiences elsewhere  this won t make the top our  hey  go there list .
Curra's Grill,323,I want to like this place but to be honest I think it s overrated. I always hear people recommending it so I give it another chance. And I always arrive at the some conclusion  it s okay.  It s got the funky Austin hipster thing going and it s always fairly crowded. The parking situation stinks  if you re meeting someone consider riding together instead.  The cochinita pibil was respectable. The pork was really dark  they must do something interesting with their sauce. The pickled veggies didn t have the vinegar-y bite to compliment the pork  but maybe that s just something I like. The corn tortilla was average. I don t recall how the beans and rice were.  My post meal coffee was good  but I should note that the waitress seemed a little offput to have to re-bring the check. It s cool you brought the check out before I asked for it and all  but if you pull that move you can t make a face when we ask for something.  I d say if you went on an off night when you could find parking and not wait for a table it s a decent spot. Otherwise you might try Sazon  Azul Tequila  or Polvo s.
Curra's Grill,324,It is not pretty. It is not pristine.   But the food  the drinks  They are delicious.  We live minutes away and we bring all of out-of-town guests here if they ask for Mexican  amp  Margaritas.
Curra's Grill,325,Let me preface this by saying I did not eat here  so I have no idea as to the quality of there food. This review is for how I was treated.   Yesterday a friend and I were meeting a group of friends here to try the Avocado Margaritas. We were all very excited and had been talking about it all day.   we had just come from Barton Springs pool so we had the dog with us. We wanted to make sure they allowed dogs on the patio so we first went inside leaving the dog in the car to ask.   We advised the server there would be 5 of us and we had a dog. I then asked if they allowed dogs on the patio. The server responded by saying of course so I told my friend and him to go ahead and I ll grab the dog.    I went and grabbed the dog  and as I was walking back up to the entrance I could see someone running from the inside to the front door like it was his mission to make sure I did not enter a foot into his establishment. He abruptly said to me in a very rude tone   We don t allow dogs here  .   Now I have no problem if a restaurant does not allow dogs. I completely understand it. This is why I went inside to ask first as I do not like to assume just because we re in Austin it is allowed.   I responded to him by stating ok no problem however I was just informed otherwise and I think it s important to make sure all of the staff is on the same page.   He then stated again very rudely and raising his voice   We don t allow dogs here    This is where I am feeling incredibly agitated at his very abrupt rudeness. Why is it you couldn t simply state   Hey I m so sorry for any kind of confusion but unfortunately it is our policy that we don t allow dogs  So much easier and polite. Instead you were rude to someone who has never dined here before and will never be back if that s how you treat customers.   I promptly put the dog back in the car walked in and grabbed my friend. I explained the situation to her and we were out of there. I will not spend my money somewhere like that.    Bye Felipe    Ps he was Hispanic with a goatee. he was wearing a read button up shirt. if you re actually reviewing your yelp reviews.
Curra's Grill,326,The manager was my  waitress   and both dishes we got were wrong out of the kitchen... she never came back to check on us and her horrible attitude was not okay at all.  The sweet bartender tried to help her but she is so stinky and rude she should not be customer facing.  Curras would be better without you Ms. Bad attitude manager. We might try take out next time... but after 10  years we likely will go somewhere that feels like they want our business. Food is very very average.
Curra's Grill,327,All you need to know is get the avocado margarita. It s like an alcohol milkshake... Amazing  Service isn t bad  this place is what it is  the food is always good  the salsa is fresh  and I keep coming back 
Curra's Grill,328,We really enjoy Curras. The food is quite delicious and the place is chill. The artwork in the bathroom is a special treat. I especially LOVE to heaters for the outside area in the  cold  months here in Austin. My main complaint is the lack of prices on the drinks menu. We have really enjoyed each one we have tried but are always a bit shocked by the prices when the check arrives. Regardless  we keep going back.
Curra's Grill,329,When we pulled up at 9am on a Monday  my boyfriend was a little skeptical. However  always up for a good dive spot that s recommended by a friend  we went in. Their queso is SO GOOD. We split the migas breakfast and we were glad we did. The portion was perfect for two. The service was stellar  with a very attentive but not overly needy waiter. We will definitely go back on our next trip 
Curra's Grill,330,I am glad I moved this past year closer to Curra s  and can walk and eat breakfast here on the reg.  I am a firm believer in  If it ain t broke  why fix it . This applies to Curra s too.  The chilaquiles ain t broke  in fact they blow my mind by how amazing they are   why order something else .  The coffee is probably the best drip coffee I ve ever had.  The service is spotty  but when its good  its really good. And the food more than makes up for the spotty service.  Love the mural in the main room. The decor is very  typical mexican restaurant   which I love too.
Curra's Grill,331,The breakfast plates and homemade corn tortillas are excellent. The strange thing is they tend to nickel-and-dime you. Once  my guest and I ate less than a basket of chips and they put down two more and stacked the bill.  I went back and had this refunded.  Tonight I ordered a plate that came with tortillas and  in an attempt to specify which variety  I said  red corn tortillas.  They gave me an extra roll of tortillas and charged me for each. There are no drink prices on the menu and they are more than you would expect. Expect an extra charge for cheese on some items  but not to be told about it.
Curra's Grill,332,Curra s     Hello Curra s  Are you still there   What the heck happened   No really...Your food was scrumptious last I visited a couple years back.  It was fresh  tasty interior Mex  like no other in ATX.  Been a fan since the 90 s.  I returned to sample my favorite dish yet again  and lo and behold...the suckage was so major I had to re-review you guys.  Pescado Veracruzano...What happened to the fresh  never frozen  Red Snapper filet  The capers  The fresh...OH so fresh veggies   I could ve gotten fresher fish at freaking Luby s.  And the veggies were soggy frozen crap.   What the heck   Did Polvo s buy you guys out and start an all new suck-fest   Listen Guys  people are used to quality at your place.  Are you going nouveau ATX on us   As in  who cares if it sux...we got CUSTOMERS            Sure seems that way.  The service has always sucked...I looked around that cos the food was awesome.  Now   Please do something to bring back loyal customers.  Please 
Curra's Grill,333,When I first walked into this place I thought  okay...now this is going to be the real deal Mexican style ....It was a-ok. Not a 5 star though and let me tell you why. The beans and rice need work. I tend to base my  mexican ratings  on the beans and rice. I think the beans just had a little bit too much rosarita taste to them and the rice wasn t moist enough.  The atmosphere screamed  mexico cantina  but the food didn t speak the same language. Fajitas were alright. The flour tortillas tasted home made and this is always a bonus. The best thing I had here was the Curra margarita  This was one of many choices of margaritas. Hands down the best margarita I have ever had  I will return again for drinks  
Curra's Grill,334,Chile Con Queso  4 5 -  Cancun Shrimp Enchiladas  4 5 - The enchiladas had shrimp  bell peppers  grilled onions   amp  pineapple. The enchiladas came w  rice which went great w  a whole bunch of queso. Service  3 5 Ambiance  3 5
Curra's Grill,335,Based on all the Mexican Tex Mex places we have tried  this is a solid 3 stars. Its a dive for sure. Chips were fresh and crisp. Salsa had a great flavor  with a bit of a kick. Queso was good  but the ground beef was non-existent. I m not a fan of a charge for chips and salsa  but its free with a queso order. Wife had the enchilada plate with beef and chilorio  Chilorio...GOOD ....Myself went with the Enchiladas Con Chile Colorado...really tender pork with some very  cheesey  enchiladas. Solid in taste. Refried black beans were Delish. Rice was good  standard issue Mexican rice. Service was good  DebZ did a great job. The Chilorio alone is worth the trip back.
Curra's Grill,336,The avocado margaritas changed my life.  My friend who doesn t even like avocados ordered one by mistake and loved them.    The rest of the food was very good but we all know the star.
Curra's Grill,337,I am visiting from DC and came to this location on the recommendation of a friend  who told me about the avocado margaritas.  I tried it and loved it  The margarita is distinct  I enjoyed the smoothness the avocado added to the tequila.    Most of the food was delicious   too. I ordered the first item listed on their entree list.  It was marinated pork leg served on a banana leaf with plaintains  rice   beans  and homemade tortillas. It was so yummy that I cleared my plate  The rice wasn t special   but all the things combined were wonderful. My sister ordered enchiladas and I thought those were great   too. For us  the pork filling was more satisfying than the chicken. So now that I ve finished summarizing  I d recommend a pork dish  -   Oh  And I enjoyed the chips and salsa.  I did not think the salsa came out of a jar.  The flour tortillas were handmade   too- no packaged  mission tortillas . Solid place 
Curra's Grill,338,I ve been eating and drinking here ever since they opened 20 years ago. Have brought myriad friends. Not once  never  have I or anyone I ve brought had less than an excellent meal. Some of the best ceviche and house margaritas in town. Brian Thur-Sunday is the best bartender in town. I highly recommend the enchiladas colorados and the 16 oz El Presidente margarita.   Think I like this place  No  I don t. I  love  it.
Curra's Grill,339,First off... What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn t give you chips and salsa for free   We ordered the ceviche and it was terrible   We even asked to get it taken off the check  It wasn t marinated in any lime juice  had no flavor  and seemed as if it were simply chopped up in the back with tomatoes and onions and thrown in a dish   Next I ordered the chilequiles and i was expecting crispy tortilla pieces but they weren t. Also I was expecting it to come with a ranchero sauce  but it was simply the salsa they serve with chips. Next  I ordered potatoes to substitute my beans and they were FLAVORLESS  Lastly  my cup of water was dirty.  Maybe this was just a bad day  but definitely not coming back for breakfast in a long time.
Curra's Grill,340,used to be great. They ve gone downhill.  I ate there tonight and had some lame watered down mole enchiladas. Chips were disgusting  they had a bunch of burned pieces in it and even the non-burned ones were bland and chalky tasting.  The avocado margarita tasted watered down and was very weak.  I asked the guy who brought our food if I could have some water and he told me I had to ask our server in a very rude tone. He couldn t just tell our server  If you re going to have that kind of attitude your food better be great and it s just not.  I want to like this place again but it s just not good anymore.  The only good thing I can say is we didn t have to wait a long time for our food. I probably should have given it one star but they get an extra one just because they used to be awesome.
Curra's Grill,341,Solid places--I ordered food but no drinks.  It s not a fancy place  and it doesn t try to be one either  but it s a great place for a sit-down casual dinner with someone     I had the Enchiladas Chile Colorado--delicious.  Didn t change my life  but was it actually trying to do so   No  but it did make me curious about the rest of the menu  so I ll probaby be back 
Curra's Grill,342,So. Overall the food was fine. Not very memorable  though.  Avocado margarita is good.  My complaint  Ordered a side of chicken fajita meat. When we receive the entrees the runner attempts to confirm my side order of chicken as shredded. I correct him and say fajita  not shredded. About 20 minutes after getting our food he comes back and gives me shredded chicken anyway. I ask the waitress for fajita chicken  she takes the shredded back  returns about 10 minutes later and says   that chicken is gonna take like 10 minutes to make. Are you sure you want it   Seemingly with some attitude.   Hm. Well at this point it s been at least 40 minutes since I originally ordered it. Could ve had about 4 orders in that time... But whatevs. No chicken for me.   Then the chicken was still on the bill.   Long story short  food is just ok. Service could be better.  Grab an avocado margarita if you find yourself here.
Curra's Grill,343,The best avocado margarita and spicy salsa  Other than that the food was pretty mediocre bad
Curra's Grill,344,This is a review for Curra s breakfast. I come to Curra s once a month for a business meeting and always enjoy the food. I ve had the migas  standard   the chilaquiles  delicious but SPICY  and the huevos montulenos. The latter is my favorite - two eggs over ranchero sauce served with black beans and fried plantains. It s a very unique dish and  while a little weird  is really yummy. The famous Curra s red corn tortillas are also great.  Even though the food is delicious  my favorite part of Curra s is the coffee. They make a mean pot of Oaxacan coffee that I drink at least 3 cups of every visit. The coffee is flavored with vanilla and cinnamon and is the best I ve had period.   The prices for breakfast are low  but despite all of the positive Curra s gets 4 stars because of the service. My coffee cup is rarely empty  but I ve missed many a meeting waiting on my food. I usually come in a large group  8-10   but it regularly takes 40 minutes to produce the food which I find to be way too long for breakfast tacos and eggs. Even when it isn t crowded  which is most times when I m there  it takes forever.
Curra's Grill,345,Food was way too expensive for what it was. I guess because of the location and its rent it s super expensive here. The service was okay the guy was nice but I think he was new and did not wait on me properly. I would not come back and I would not recommend it.
Curra's Grill,346,I was in Austin for family vacation and the front desk manager for the hotel we stayed at said this was some of the best Mexican food in Austin so we tried it out.  When we arrived the greeter was nice and showed us to a table right away.  Our waiter was great and VERY friendly.  He was told us what they are known for and told us to try the Avocado Margarita.  My mom tried it and loved it so much she had 2.  While we were waiting for for our food the waiter made sure our drinks were full and we had chips.  The food came out in a good amount of time.  It was piping hot and very good.  It tasted like it has homemade.  While we were eating there was a rain storm that came over and the staff did everything they could to accommodate the people eating outside.  Through out our visit it showed that the staff really cared about customer service.  I had a great experience at Curra s and would go back again next time I am in town.
Curra's Grill,347,Great place for breakfast  Good prices  Their signature carnitas plate is bomb  along with the chilaquiles and aliss breakfast plate. Can be hard to find parking  and you have to know a little Spanish to know what to order
Curra's Grill,348,Oh my  oh my.  Avocado margs  yes please. The Caldo - DELICIOUS. I can t get over it. It s so good and hits the spot PERFECTLY. I spent four days in central Mexico  having gotten back last night  and a  looked all over the place for a soup THAT good  with no luck   and immediately upon arrival in Austin  purchased a Caldo at Curra s.  Thank you for living down the street  Curra s. You make my life complete.
Curra's Grill,349,okay okay the food is stellar. my previous review mentioned the poor to go service. it s definitely better now  parking is a little tough. but the sauces galore and avocado margaritas are top notch. this is a south austin staple
Curra's Grill,350,The Oaxaca Dark Roast is hands down one of the best brewed coffees I ve ever had. What is in that stuff  It s delicious. I want it right now.   I ve had the juju plate  the migas with veggie chorizo  and the.... really long spanish name thing that s basically a breakfast quesadilla. All of them were delicious  but if I had to make a single recommendation  it d be the juju... so much flavor on one plate  and relatively healthy  to boot.   I ve heard great things about the avocado margarita  but I ve only been there for breakfast  so haven t been able to sample it yet.  Service can be spotty - generally it s been friendly and quick  but sometimes we ve had to wait a while to get noticed.  The restaurant has that South Austin vibe... quirky  casual  and relaxed--one of my favorite breakfast spots 
Curra's Grill,351,The breakfast tacos taste amazing all day long   And the ratio of meat in them is superb. I have not tried anything else there because they taste so good. I like Torchy s but after awhile the crazy flavors over there are too much. This is what a taco is originally supposed to taste like. They are big and two is tough to eat for a great price 
Curra's Grill,352,Jorge is such a kind hearted man  amp  I support this restaurant 100   Great food  amp  staff.
Curra's Grill,353,This is just the kind of place the tourists  the locals  amp  frequent Austonians are looking for.  1. It s weird   2. The food is Awesome   3 the service  amp  friendliness is superb  4 the menu selection is out of this world. You get the Mexican  Tex-Mex  Seafood   Austin weird   Outdoor  Casual  trendy all rolled into one homemade flour tortilla  We loved it. And Yes the AVOCADO MARGARITAS ARE VERY GOOD 
Curra's Grill,354,Their food is great when they actually get it right. Especially the guacamole  ceviche  and all of the shrimp dishes. We have loved going here for a long time and I guess that s why we have continued to go back  despite it being a game of roulette with the food. The last few times we have gone  they have gotten at least one part of our order wrong and food has been soooo salty it s inedible. When we went last time  my fianc  wasn t eating his food so the waiter asked and he told him what was wrong. Waiter offered to bring him something else but he decided to just snack on what I had. So they very kindly gave us a credit towards our next visit. Nice. So last night  he goes to redeem our credit and they literally got every single part of our order wrong. We ordered veggie tamales  they gave us pork tamales. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito- which we specified no meat  just bean and cheese- and they gave us a ground beef and rice burrito with beans and cheese. That was really the last straw with them and I don t think we will be returning after this. It s almost like they have to actually try to mess up this bad
Curra's Grill,355,My friend and I went one night and it was pretty good  We loved the quest and the drinks were great  I d definitely go again 
Curra's Grill,356,I have been going to Curras for about 5 years now and the place is just great. I have never had a plate there that I don t like. Yeah there s all the comments about the service  get over it people. Its a very busy restaurant. The food is kick ass and so are the margaritas. My favorite are the tamales. You can order a junior plate that comes with 4 huge tamales  beans and rice  and have left overs for 2 days later. Unless you can eat it all right there. Next best would be the carnitas plate. Don t listen to all the shit reviews from these foodie wannabes. Curras is awesome  
Curra's Grill,357,The avocado margarita was delicious    It has great patio vibes and the service was decent. But apparently they can t do separate checks so keep that in mind if you are going with friends....
Curra's Grill,358,What happened Curras  I ve been to Curras before and the food always seemed very fresh  and made with quality ingredients. Today  I was very disappointed. The food was mediocre and the service poor. When I read the menu  everything sounded delicious and I couldn t wait to get my food. My husband s enchiladas tasted like they had canned salsa  mine were ok but the beans were bland and the rice was stale. They brought a taco in flour instead of corn like I had requested  forgot my husband s side of refried beans  and brought me regular bananas with my rice  instead of the fried plantains I ordered. I m sad to see Curra s go downhill from the amazing food they used to serve.
Curra's Grill,359,Had a really fun afternoon here with hubby. We had the nachos and a whole lot of other meals. All were good.
Curra's Grill,360,So glad I gave this place another try. I went to the location off Burnet many years ago and recently revisited with a friend for lunch.  Pros  Quick  nice service  good atmosphere  when everyone is drinking during lunch on a Tuesday  that s got to make you feel good   I got the nachos and they were delicious  and enough for leftovers  patio area Cons  So it doesn t have the best ambiance  but it s bright  friendly people and the best part of my whole trip... I glanced around and thought to myself   Damn  those are some green margaritas. If I had known any better  I d say they had avocado in them.   And sure enough...they do. Sounds pretty nasty  I am a sour cream over guac kind of girl myself   but these creamy  smoothie-like alcoholic concoctions were two big thumbs up.  Also noticed they were voted best Mexican Food by Citysearch  it was a small little hanging on the wall so not sure if it said 2009 or 1989  and exactly who voted  why don t I ever hear of these things   but it must have won for some reason  and that reason still exists.
Curra's Grill,361,3.5 stars if I could.  The best thing  the avocado margarita. Very tasty  You would think the avocado would weigh it down or taste weird but it doesn t  it s more like a margarita smoothie.  The worst thing  hidden up-charges. Chips and salsa aren t free   Menu says 79c extra for charro beans buried in the bottom corner in tiny print. Bill came back with 99c for the charro beans...waitress never said anything. I m okay with extra charges but be up front about it. Just seems like there s a lot of little things where they nickel and dime you here.  Other thoughts  I like the atmosphere. It s a little dumpy and run-down but that s more my style anyway. Seems like it s family-owned. Aside from the hidden charges the prices seem pretty fair. The salsa was very good but the chips seemed cheap and bland  I think they could use an upgrade in that department. We tried the ceviche and it was pretty boring but there were four of us and we were all satisfied with our main courses. The wait was pretty short and everyone inside seemed to be having a good time. This is just your basic  neighborhood family Mexican restaurant  you went to in the 1990s and I m okay with that.
Curra's Grill,362,This is more a 4 and 1 2 stars. It s fairly priced  and the portions aren t as big as other TexMex restaurants in Austin  but goddamn the food is so authentic. Anything  chipotle  they have is incredible. Their variety of sauces will enhance any meal.  They also have the famous avocado margaritas. It s  8  so a little pricey for a 5oz  at most  glass. But it will fill you up since it s really thick and it ll kick in right when your food comes. By that  I mean loads of alcohol.  I ve seen the guy make it.   BUT THE BEST PART OF THIS PLACE  THE FLAN.  Maybe I m just a flan enthusiast  or whatever  but damn  I think this is the best flan in town. Very rich and the texture is perfectly creamy. The caramel is just enough  and for  3.49  you can t go wrong.   The tres leches cake is amazing too. Super big slice  
Curra's Grill,363,I went here two years as it was recommended by friends who used to live here. I was blown away.  So I went back last week when in Austin again. Was not blown away this time.   From the chips which seemed a bit hard and tasteless to the avocado margarita which was one of my favorite drinks of all time  but is no longer  everything was mediocre tp good at best. Except the fish tacos  which were well-cooked  and enhanced significantly by the mango salsa.  The service was excellent--friendly  and quick.   The portions are huge for what you pay  and we did bring home leftovers and scramble them with eggs the next day  and those were really good.  But I don t think I d go back next time.
Curra's Grill,364,I m really not sure how I haven t written a review for Curra s. It was the first place I ate when I moved to Austin in 2006. We lived right around the corner  and ended up living at Curra s basically for the first year in Austin.  Every time I m able to go back to Austin  I head there to load up on their delicious tamales  and my favorite  the  award winning  veggie enchiladas. I m not sure what awards they ve won  but that s what the menu says  I am also in love with the avocado margaritas.   It s probably incredibly packed during busy times  especially brunch. So it s a bit hard to find parking at that time. As long as you re planning your trip accordingly  it s no problem to park and not wait too long for a table 
Curra's Grill,365,Ok. I know this place is beloved in south austin  but frankly  I m not really sure why.   This place is so cheap  and not in the good way.   Chips and salsa are  3  the price for queso is absurd. In addition  I got no cheese on my tacos.    Also  my food was cold.
Curra's Grill,366,I was in town for ACL and this place was amazing     I loved the avocado margarita and I don t even like avocado... and my meal was delicious    Will definitely be back next time I m in Austin  - 
Curra's Grill,367,I have been to Curras several times and always enjoyed the food. Today I left without having received my order because an hour was not long enough to get my salad that I ordered for lunch. I asked the waiter to check on it several times  and he just kept saying  sorry   without being able to solve the problem. I even tried to pay in advance thinking I might be able to take my order to go  but the server overcharged me  charging me  10.99 for fish tacos rather than  4.99 to add fish to my salad. I gave up and went back to work hungry. This was so frustrating that I will not be visiting Curras for lunch again. Inexcusably bad service.
Curra's Grill,368,A friend brought me here when I was visiting from Ireland as I asked that we go for some good tex mex  which we don t have much of at home. We both ordered tamales and they were really good  there was a lot of food and it was very filling  but you definitely get your monies worth. I also tried the avocado margarita and it was amazing. The service wasn t great however  the guy mumbled most of the time.   A few days later I checked my debit card statement to find I d been charged twice  one charge had been processed and one was still pending. I called Curras to make sure the pending charge was a mistake and that I would not be charged. The first time I called they couldn t help me and needed a manager. The girl on the phone asked me to leave my number  being from out of town Ireland  I have an Irish cell phone number. I had to explain the concept of an international dialling code to her... I told I d be called back in a few hours.  No one called me back by the time I was told a manager would be on duty  so I called again. I spoke to a manager who tried and failed to find my receipt in the system. I hadn t retained my copy  who does   but I told him exactly when we visited and who served us. Again I was told I would be called back...  Aaaaand of course no one called me back. I checked my statement again after a few days and the pending charge had dropped without being applied thankfully  but why could no one call me back   I gave up because I was traveling to Canada for a few days and didn t have the time to chase them.  In summary  nice food but pay in cash..
Curra's Grill,369,I have seriously never been disappointed at Curra s. After reading some of the reviews below I jokingly am imagining I ve been to an alternate universe version of the place... but I ve always had friendly and prompt service  since coming here at least once per month. I m vegetarian  so though I can t comment on meat-based dishes  the veg options have been delicious so far. And of course those avocado margaritas are divine.   Great that they have outdoor shades now too  I suggest it all the time  and will continue to come here.
Curra's Grill,370,Such a yummy place. My parents knows Francisco  the artist who painted the murals and recommended this place. Everyone in our party was satisfied. We went with  our service recommendations  and were not disappointed. Best mole I ve had in years. Handmade tortillas were the bomb. Cochinita pibil like my abuela made. I can t wait to come back and try more off the menu. Service was sweet  attentive  but not overly so. Just the perfect Austin interior Mexican food spot.
Curra's Grill,371,The drinks are horrible. The quality of the food has definitely gone down and the chips are cheap store bought tortilla chips. Service was poor and even though we didn t order anything complicated  the order somehow still got messed up. Place looked dirty even in dimmed light which is not a good thing. I remember this place being so much better than what it is now. Not expensive for the  location but not good enough for the price. Wouldn t come back unless they change everything they is. Lol
Curra's Grill,372,Man  I love Curra s. I ve been coming here for years. It s a little out of the way for me  but it s always worth the trip. They have some of the best Mexican food in town. It s simple and authentic  but it s a little more upscale  pineapple in the pastor  high-end margaritas  etc. . I get the Tacos Al Pastor a lot  and I love their mole.  The margaritas are great. Get the one with brandy in it. So delicious. Their Mexican Martinis are really good too. You can taste the olive  but it s not overwhelming  I m talking to you  Cedar Door  . Tiny parking lot  but deal with it. It looks a little run down  but it s very clean  and the staff is great. Food comes out fast. Need to go out of my way a little more often.  Gracias.
Curra's Grill,373,Great food   Only thing that sucks is the sound of those chairs grinding loudly every time someone pulls one out. Please get some of those circle pads from home Depot for the legs   Oh ...and your prices are high enough for you to give the first round of chips free   
Curra's Grill,374,I am now completely and utterly addicted to Avocado Margaritas thanks to this place.  5 stars for the margs.  Heck  I may just start putting avocados in all my drinks from now on.    The menu is extensive and we were excited to get our food...however the excitement didn t last.  There were some really great choices of interior Mexican food which is a welcome respite from the standard Tex-Mex.  Unfortunately  the food was mediocre and frankly disappointing given it s predecessor  the marg  being so great..  If I return  it will be for happy hour apps and margaritas.  Maybe if I have two or three I won t even care how the food tastes.     I hope this was just an off night because the vibe  the friendly staff and the margs all were stellar...the entrees just missed the mark.
Curra's Grill,375,Curra s has been a destination spot to take traveling friends for 13 years because of the amazing avocado margaritas and veggie options. Sad to say though out last 4 visits have been extremely lackluster. Our trip today put us over the edge and we won t be going back    Between the extremely aloof service  the smell  the laughable small breakfast tacos  and the inedible empanadas  we are sadly underwhelmed. We really hope Curra s will gain back their ranking as one of the best local business  in Austin 
Curra's Grill,376,The food is delicious but margaritas are garbage. We tried different menu items and they all had good taste and presentation. I asked the server to surprise me with a good margarita  whatever she recommended and I got a tall glass of lime syrup. The server was nice and replaced it with a spicy flavored one and it was just another tall  10 glass of spicy syrup. I d say come for the food and avoid their drink menu..
Curra's Grill,377,We stopped by to try this place because it had good reviews.  We were in town to visit Austin and sight-see.  We loved the artwork in the building and cute lil patio... we always prefer to sit out if it is nice weather.  We tried the salsa sampler and it was a nice plate to try out all the different salsas they have. The mimosas were  5 and nice to enjoy and relax while sitting outside.   We all got tacos and they were delicious   We would recommend stopping by for some good food with good prices.
Curra's Grill,378,Not impressed. Heard was a great Mexican spot to try on our stay in Austin and definitely did not meet the hype that we expected. Find another local spot for Mexican food. Service was just okay. Really just not that into it.
Curra's Grill,379,My husband and I used to LOVE Curra s. We would go a few times a month and also get food Togo pretty often and it was always wonderful. We moved away about 2 years ago  but still make a point to visit Austin every 2-3 months. Curra s has always been one of the places that we make sure we visit while we re here  but the past few times haven t lived up to expectation. The food is different. We can t figure out what is different about it  but it s just not the same. The food has been very cold the past few times. This past visit  I was served the wrong type of beans  no big deal  but I couldn t find my server to tell him until I was 3 4 the way done with my meal. Service has been kind of iffy. Plus they charge you for chips and salsa  which we ve always overlooked because of the yummy food  but I think it s time to find a new Austin Tex-mex favorite.
Curra's Grill,380,When I saw that this place had an avocado margarita  I knew I had to try it. I went with the husband and another couple last Friday night about this time. Warning  small parking lot. You may have to look for parking on a side street if you come during peak times. Despite the fact the parking lot was full  we were seated right away. The hostess that sat us was super friendly and made a couple drink recommendations. I wish I had equally good things to say about the rest of service. First  service was slow. Then they didn t get our orders right. I checked in on Yelp and they had a free drink offer. I asked and it was for a non alcoholic drink. Sad face. Saved it for later. I did enjoy my Mexican martini. They say it s a 24 oz shaker. It s not as much as the Trudy s Mexican martini. I would say it tasted similar though. My husband ordered the avocado margarita and it was sweet with a hint of avocado flavor. We also tried an Arnold Palmer which was decent. I asked for a skinny margarita since the hostess recommended it. My server didn t know what she was talking about. She said she would find out and bring it out. She brought me a drink  but there was definitely nothing skinny about it. Now to talk about the food. The salsa sampler was fun. I don t think you should have to pay for regular chips and salsa though. I ordered the salmon. Since it took an hour to come out I was famished and I promptly killed the dish. My husband order a chicken dish that he enjoyed. The couple that was with us tried ordering some different tacos. Instead of bringing a shrimp taco  they brought us the shrimp taco plate. They also didn t get another taco dish they ordered correct.  Would I come back-yeah probably. It wouldn t be my first choice though.
Curra's Grill,381,While the food was 2-star  the service was definitely less than a single star.  Our experience started with getting seated at a table right outside the mens bathroom  which was very busy  so... not off to a good start.  Then  our waitress takes our drink orders and disappears for enough time for people to be sat around us and order and receive their drinks.  My wife s margarita tasted suspiciously liked it lacked alcohol  and was very watery... I imagine it sat at the bar for a prolonged time before we asked where the drinks were.  My margarita tasted awful  if not a little fresher than hers.  The service was mostly non-existent... I guess they don t like hanging out by the bathroom either.  The food finally came  and it was mostly cold and entirely mediocre. Portions were average. The only thing above average was the bill  which was about  80 for food that didn t rank with Taco Cabana.
Curra's Grill,382,I really like coming here for my tex-mex fix.  When I m in the mood for some guilty pleasure  we order the french fries topped with chorizo and cheese...I know  it s a heart attack...but it makes me feel better that I do this every once in a while     I get the carnitas tacos and they are delicious   Lots of flavor and enough to fill you up   Downfall is the parking- really tight and small.  Lots of seating indoors and outdoors on the patio.
Curra's Grill,383,If I could give 0 stars I would but it ll suffice  and the Avocado  margarita was good  Today we celebrated my SIL s birthday  party of 20 people  Service was good  Waitress was sweet. We ate  we sang happy birthday  all was good until we received our bill  we were charged for a  flan   5.99. We questioned the surprise charge since the waitress was curious as well. The owner Jorge came out to tell us it was for bringing in our own 7 inch cake  We spent well over  400 so what s  6. The manager came out dukes up told all of us  if we promise to never come back  he d take it off   We were in total shock  still are. We will Never be back  Who treats their customers in such a manner   
Curra's Grill,384,The pork tamales are my go to meal. I highly recommend them.   The avocado margaritas are pretty good  but not life-changing . I would try them at least once just so you can say you ve had one.   My husband had the burrito last night  and usually gets the tamales . He said it wasn t very good.   I d stick to the tamales.
Curra's Grill,385,I don t think they charge for chips and salsa anymore.  The meats have gotten better and the margs have been on point.  Way to go.
Curra's Grill,386,Visiting Austin I stopped here by myself and sat at the bar. The bartender was AWESOME  I ordered the avocado Margarita because everyone raved about it on yelp. It was OK  different is always cool. As I was sitting at the bar the bartender noticed me on yelp and asked if I was reading reviews on what to order. I said yes and he asked what I liked. I ordered chips and salsa to start and told him that I like chicken. He went over the menu with me and we decided on chicken enchiladas with a green creamy sauce with refried black beans. The enchiladas were so freaking good  The sauce was so flavorful I was in heaven  The overall experience was awesome  My service was amazing and the food is to rave about. I will definitely be back 
Curra's Grill,387,Avocado in a margarita  hmm...intrigued. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. A creamy concoction blended to perfection. It was more like an avocado smoothie with tequila than a margarita -- but this girl isn t complaining. It was the best part of my meal. Service at the bar was a-ok  the bartender was pleasant and made me a mean margarita. My dining server was fantastic  accommodating  efficient  amp  knowledgable of the menu.   I ordered the  tacos al pastor  with corn tortillas  comes black refried beans  amp  rice . The meat was tender and nicely seasoned.   Parking spots can be difficult to find so check out the side streets next to the gas station for spaces.   If you haven t been to Curra s yet  come on out  amp  try their avocado margaritas  O le
Curra's Grill,388,Warning Vegetarians   The food here is quite good.  The margaritas here are excellent.  My concern is that the menu items that are touted as vegetarian come with non-vegetarian sides...just a slight oversight.  Now  I don t consider myself a militant vegetarian  but I also hold people to a certain standard if they are going to make specific claims.  None of the rice they offer is vegetarian  but if you order vegetarian enchiladas guess what you get   More disappointingly  the servers seems to be aware of this issue  but won t mention it unless brought to their attention  at which point they will offer a different side.  How about some positives   The veggie chorizo they use is delicious...especially in the breakfast tacos   The margaritas are simply delicious  smooth and creamy.  The service is usually prompt and the servers are quite polite.  The parking situation is a little crazy  but definitely manageable.  There is also street parking just a block away.  This is a great place for a quick drink and a little relaxation...just make sure you ask the right questions if you have any dietary restrictions or you may end up with a surprise 
Curra's Grill,389,I ve been wanting to eat here for a while now. I ve passed it a few times and its always busy. So  since we were on the south side of town  we headed over at about 5 PM.   It s a cute little restaurant  nothing extremely special. Sat down  received our waters. Then  our service just went downhill from there. We hardly saw our waiter  like at all. We sat for 30 minutes AFTER someone other than our waiter picked up our plates waiting on the check. Drink refills  Non-existent. So where was our waiter 90  of the time  Hanging out at the bar laughing and sitting around with his co-workers  clearly not giving a crap about his tables.   Curra s received three stars because the food was AMAZING. The charro beans tasted like what I grew up eating. The empanadas app with lamb gave off such a Cuban flavor and they were so good paired with the pepper cream sauce. I had the Colorado  something or another  enchiladas. They were Monterrey jack cheese enchiladas smothered in a red enchilada sauce and goat tips. Omg. Just so good  The rice isn t orange guys  It s seasoned ever so slightly and tastes like authentic Mexican rice.    Service  HORRIBLE  Food  AMAZING.
Curra's Grill,390,For my money this is the best interior Mexican restaurant in town. I ve been coming for decades and the quality is as good as when I first started coming. Some of my favorite dishes include the Carnitas Plate  Al Pastor burrito  and enchiladas con Chile Colorado. Their tamales are fabulous  chock of well seasoned fillings with an unparalleled masa. There are great vegetarian options too - the huevos motulenos  mushroom burrito  and cheese enchiladas with verde sauce are all tasty. They have excellent margaritas with interesting flavors like avocado. They have the best flan - it s so creamy and delicious. You won t be disappointed.
Curra's Grill,391,F this place seriously. Why do I have to give them a whole star  that seems excessive.  I m totally done with them and their crap TO GO service. They screwed me a year ago with a burnt rubber band in my food. And they had just a few months ago earned back my business.   But GOD DAMN not once but twice in one night they didn t give me the food AFTER I CAME BACK THE SECOND TIME TO GET WHAT THEY FORGOT     I called and told them the food was not given to me.  I was BACK at the restaurant and they were still debating what happened to the food telling me the cooks said it went out.  What the HELL   I m sure it did but not to ME      No one really TOOK ownership of the mistake.  All I kept hearing about was how the EXPO called out and really left them in a situation.  Holy moly.  Every business in AMERICA has people call out.  It happens.  If you can t function because one person called out you need to shut the doors man.  Went through sooo much crap to get them to make it. And as I said before no one took ownership.  The guy claiming to be the manager basically asked me  what was he supposed to do       I told him to take the fajitas off the order because they were at my house turning to crap getting cold while I was sitting there.  He ordered the bartender to redo the bill but he  didn t really take ownership  once again it wasn t his fault  it wasn t the bartender s fault who took my order or got the tip.  It was this mysterious EXPO guy who called out to hang with his sick cat.  He tried to offer me a free queso which I turned down and he did a little hand gesture at me which wasn t a middle finger but was certainly a sign he was done with me.  And I left the second time without all my food.  I m sure it s my fault... why didn t I double check the bag   Because I saw THREE guys look in the bag I never in a million years thought they would let me leave the restaurant again without the two things they forgot initially.    I don t want to hear about your runner that called in sick. I want you to look in the GOD DAMN bag and check the fucking food order. In the time it took to make the seven excuses you could have checked the bag.  I have ZERO sympathy. I worked 10 years in food service and you triple check to go orders because you only have that one time to get it right. Yes despite ALL THEIR CRAP I still tipped  10 trying to be understanding.  And got home to find they forgot all my food a second time.  Curra s you suck and I m done with you.  Right now million dollar idea. You only tip once you get home and find the order is correct. So fucking betrayed because I tip big on these order because I know so it s hard work. But if you get over ten fucking dollars on a to go order you make sure IT S FUCKING RIGHT YOU ASSHOLES   
Curra's Grill,392,Curras avocado margaritas are what make them such a stand out restaurant in a city full of fantastic Mexican cuisine. The salsa is delicious and fresh with just the right amount of spice and garlic. I had the Cancun shrimp relleno which was fresh  flavorful and generously sized. Our service was warm and genuine. We can t wait to return for breakfast.
Curra's Grill,393,Unlike any TexMex restaurant.  Been here three times already and it will certainly not be my last. Drinks are also phenomenal. Highly recommend it.
Curra's Grill,394,The tamales were excellent  as well as the salsas. We had chicken  bean andMy wife and I ordered guacamole  too and it was pretty tasty. I had heard so much about their avocado margarita I just had to try it even though I am not fond of frozen margaritas. I know now why it s so popular. It was delicious  like an avocado smoothie with a shot of tequila.  The only thing is the tamales are huge. We each got an order of four  but along with the chips and guacamole it was just too much food. We took home four of them. One order of tamales  which includes rice and beans  would have been plenty for the two of us. On the plus side though  I had two of the tamales for breakfast the next day. Yum 
Curra's Grill,395,Lord help me  I am completely addicted to their tamalespork if you re wondering.  Also...try their veggie ones.  I know...if you re looking for MEAT  that s NOT the way to go  but they are SO. GOOD      They may even become my new fav over the pork ones.  All due to a suggestion from the waitstaff.
Curra's Grill,396,Food is good but I ve had some bad experiences with the wait staff. Last time I was here the woman who served the food spilled a tall glass of ice water all over my lap and walked away without saying anything. When I told my waitress she said   maybe she didn t see.  Clearly a lie since the server s eyes were the size of eggs when she heard the splash. Total nightmare. Also  I ve always noticed a sort of sewage smell as soon as you walk into the place. Maybe there is a plumbing issue not sure but it s gross.
Curra's Grill,397,Friends who live in the area ordered take out from here for us--we tried a sampling of beef fajitas  cheese enchiladas  and stewed beef or carne guisada like stuff--plus chips  guac  and all the chip fixings.  I really like the gushy soft quality of the cheese enchiladas and the beef fajitas were tasty. I liked that it came with a lot of grilled veggies too. My hubby went with the friend to pick up food and I don t think he said much about the inside of the place  but I think we ll be back for more food and to try that famous avocado margaritalove avos and margaritas so I can t miss this 
Curra's Grill,398,Used to love this place  but sad to say it s really gone downhill.  Food isn t what it used to be and the service has taken a skid.  The whole place feels like it could use a really good cleaning and the restrooms are awful.  Sorry Curra s  but i won t be back.
Curra's Grill,399,Really good migas  The services was a little shabby but they were busy. Same with the parking super packed. They have a avocado margarita that was yummy. Overall really great prices. Would go again.
Curra's Grill,400,I was in town not expecting to be out and about Austin. But it happened and when i was taken to this small building with hardly any parking i was taken aback. I love my mexican food and where im from i havent had anything like this. I had the Oaxacan Nacos   And that was enough. The quantity was more than what was needed.  Big thumbs up from a Mexican who thought she had tried it all.
Curra's Grill,401,Their Tacos Carnitas plate is really good  I was hesitant to try it because of the marinade they used but it was surprisingly really good  Their avocado margarita was okay. Also this isn t the typical Mexican restaurant where you get free chips and salsa but that s okay because I don t need the extra calories anyway lol. The only bad thing about this place is the parking but there s plenty of street parking on the street next to it.
Curra's Grill,402,Came here for dinner after spending a day in downtown Austin. Tried the salsa sampler which was delicious. So many different tastes on one plate. It was a little hard to scoop onto the chips though as it is served on a flat plate. Ended up trying the mole chicken enchiladas. The mole sauce was good and a little spicy which I like. Many places make their mole way too mild and bland. It was pretty busy on a Wednesday night. Our server was very kind and attentive. I enjoyed the place a lot.
Curra's Grill,403,Mexican food is in regular rotation at home  so if I m going out to eat it  it needs to be something special. Curra s isn t mind-blowing  but it is delicious  and just as importantly  it s consistent. This is a place I feel I can go when I m undecided about what to eat  and know that I m going to walk away satisfied.  I ve had all three of the shrimp dishes and they were great every time. My favorite was the Camarr nes Diablo. The shrimp are large  cooked in a delightful dark red sauce made with chipotle peppers and mezcal. If there is a problem  it s that the entree may not be big enough for someone with a large appetite like me  but I suspect that s what it takes to maintain quality and keep the price reasonable.   Curra s is generous with their chips and salsa - and that salsa is really good  too  a nice balance of savory and spicy. The lime agua frescas always hit the spot - tangy  refreshing  sweet  wonderful. And did I mention that you can refill them for free   The restaurant dubs itself the  Mother of All Mex   and indeed that is what it feels like to come here. While there may be better chefs out there than Mom  you know you can always come home for a delicious meal.   Unless your mom CAN T cook  in which case  I m sorry. But  all the more reason to go to Curra s  then.   
Curra's Grill,404,One of the best Mexican restaurants in Austin. I ve been coming here for years. I especially like the huevos motule os.
Curra's Grill,405,Came here the first time because it s literally down the street from where I live. Came here the second time because bf s family was in town from Kansas and it was a convenient  quick tex mex option.  Food is consistent but not quality. Ok service - a little slow and not very thorough  the space doesn t exactly look clean nor is it at all fancy or  nice .  Most tex mex tastes the same to me - too much cheese  canned re-fried beans  bad guacamole. This kind of falls into that same category.  I d choose other tex mex places over this one unless I just want to go somewhere close to home. Overall it s forgettable but it isn t bad.   You go  you eat  you leave. Nothing more  nothing less. I would never go out of my way for it. Meh.
Curra's Grill,406,Im not really getting what all the fuss is about here  and upon reading some of their most recent reviews I can see that this mediocrity is a trend.   I came in the other day wanting some basic TexMex before an appointment that was in an hour nearby. I figured I d be in and out of there in 35 minutes tops. Unfortunately  that wasn t the case.   I started out with the white chili con queso with veggie chorizo  which was actually really awesome. However  I couldn t fully enjoy it because I had been waiting on a soda refill for about 10 minutes  and I m one of those weirdos that just really can t eat without some Diet Coke nearby. Also  I didn t get a straw for my water  which my server explained was a managerial decision -- getting cheap on customers leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I had the fried fish tacos for my entree  which is supposedly one of their best and most popular dishes. I really can t see why  the plate was served totally separate from each other. The fish came in little fried bites  maybe about three or four  in a tortilla. The  mango salsa  that accompanies it comes on the side  and there really isn t enough of it for two tacos. Again with the getting cheap on the customers  They charge an upgrade for their charro beans  which I was fine with  until I tasted how bland they were.   Once we were finished eating we had to wait another 10-15 minutes for the check  constantly glancing toward the server station to no avail. Our waiter kept appearing  but only to laugh with other staff members and take care of his other tables  it was a slow day  so he maybe had 2 or 3 aside from us .   On top of all that  it s really expensive. My rule of thumb with Mexican is generally that the more expensive it is the less delicious it is. Curra s is not an exception to that rule.  Overall not really worth it  but I might give it a second try anyway.
Curra's Grill,407,This place has a lot of history to it along with some great tasting food  We were here to grab a quick bite for lunch and finally had their famous breakfasts for lunch  We had the Huevos Curras with Guisada meat. Was a good choice for a tasty short meal. Will definitely be back here for more   It s a decent place to stop by and experience the past  
Curra's Grill,408,This is definitely my go to spot when in ATX. My family and I frequent this place often.   Always start with an Avocado Margarita. There is no if and or but s about it. Chips are brought to the table with yummy salsa. Now what to order. There are varieties of enchiladas and tacos. TIP  you can ask for a sampler of their sauces since there is quite a few to choose from. I usually opt for Tacos Al Carbon with red corn  if feeling healthy . I have tried the fajita s  sorry  nothing to write home about . Also  the fish tacos are pretty tasty.   I suggest patio seating. Indoors can be very crowded and loud. Parking can be a PAIN so park in the neighborhood off by the gas station and just walk off that feast you just had 
Curra's Grill,409,It took me 7 years of driving by this place to actually stop by and check it out. And I m glad I did. The parking lot is always full but there is plenty of street parking nearby.   What we got  Steak nachos especiales  carnitas plate  and al pastor taco plate  Make sure you have a big appetite when you order the carnitas plate  It s a LOT of food. Add that to the 3 basket of chips salsa you just devoured and you will be struggling to finish your entree. The al pastor was amazing too. Probably the best al pastor I ve tasted in Austin. Nacho appetizer was good too  but kinda overpriced.
Curra's Grill,410,What a fun experience. Great staff  hot salsa  avocado margaritas to die for  superb meal and the owner was totally delightful. 5 stars all around.
Curra's Grill,411,The blackened fish tacos are SUPER salty. I think everything else I ve tried is just meh. I really don t get the hype.  They are friendly about gluten intolerance though which added a star.
Curra's Grill,412,Best Mexican food I ve had since I moved to Austin  The patio is cute how they have it set up and all of their salsa selections are outstanding 
Curra's Grill,413,As a native Texan I m already skeptical of any actual Texmex restaurant that charges for chips and salsa. I get not expecting things for free but they re not even included with an entree and I was just unhappily surprised. The service was average. Not bad but when I received the receipt there wasn t a pen and that was just annoying. I had to get up to grab a pen from another the table. The food was below average. I got the Curra s enchiladas and they weren t very good. Edible  but not very flavorful and really salty. I love cheese enchiladas and I know cheese is pretty salty but I could still taste the salt on my tongue when I got back to work. The Carne Guisada it was topped with wasn t the right consistency either  it was like water with chunks of meat instead of a dark gravy and it was  12. The restaurant looks pretty run down which actually made me think the food would taste better. Seems like this place is only good for drinks. I didn t have a margarita but that s the only reason I might consider going back.
Curra's Grill,414,I ve been giving Curra s random opportunities to WOW me over the past few years but it s honestly just  meh . The food is actually not bad  I really love the campechana and their steak fajitas  however  the service and lack of attentiveness from the staff leaves much to be desired.   Last night  11 15 2016  I ordered the steak fajitas using the delivery service  Favor. Gosh darn it  Curra s did not include my tortillas. Fajitas without tortillas  That s terrible. I know it wasn t my driver s fault  she was not responsible for packing the food.   Other times using Favor or similar services  other items have been forgotten by the staff member responsible for packing up my order and even when I have picked up my order myself  I have had to ask for chips or tortillas.   All in all  I feel that there are plenty of other Mexican restaurants in the area that have great food AND great service. Those two things should go hand in hand. And yea  the avocado margaritas are overrated.
Curra's Grill,415,Came in for lunch  at a time when they were not very busy  but were well-staffed. Nobody glanced in my direction for 10 minutes after I sat down. Finally  a guy saw me looking around and slowly walked over to ask  what s up   I asked if he was our server and he said he was. I asked if I could get something to drink and our chips and salsa. Turns out this places charges for chips and salsa  the first sign of a bad Mexican food restaurant. The server wandered around some more and eventually brought my tea  asked if we had any questions  at which point we ordered our food. The food eventually made it to our table  but was lackluster at best. I ll skip this place next time and head to any number of better restaurants nearby. These guys obviously don t need or want my business.
Curra's Grill,416,I have not been to Curra s in a very long time and that was a big mistake. The veggie enchiladas were incredible. I took our waiter s recommendation and had it with the tomatillo sauce  green  and it was tangy  but not too spicy  caution- I like spicy  so nonspicy folks usually don t trust my judgment .  We were there with a semi-large group from the office and the service was quick and everyone loved their meal. I ll be back soon 
Curra's Grill,417,As greasy-spoon tex-mex goes  this is among the best Austin has to offer. Breakfast is where they shine. Is it  authentic   Surely not. Does it taste good and come out fast  Every time.
Curra's Grill,418,The parking is very limited but the food definitely makes up for it. We ordered the enchiladas and carnitas along with the salsa and queso which was amazing. This place is definitely authentic and I love that it is so close to downtown. No complaints for this place.
Curra's Grill,419,Curra s has simply the best mole in town  and great avocado margaritas.  It s also a classic old Austin restaurant.
Curra's Grill,420,Went to Curra s as part of our quest to visit the  essential  Austin restaurants. The chips and salsa  smoky and slightly spicy  were great  and we added a salsa sampler for a few extra bucks. The avocado margaritas were delicious and creamy. We ordered the carnitas and the veggie fajitas - both were fantastic. The veggie fajitas were enough for a full meal of leftovers. Definitely would recommend Curra s 
Curra's Grill,421,Curra s stands out amongst the rest of the Mexican food places around Austin with excellent service. Food quality above the norm  but so is the price.   The  5 house margaritas got me in the door  but I ll be back to try their delicious enchiladas again.   Apparently their avocado margs are fantastic  but I was content with the house on the rocks.
Curra's Grill,422,Enjoyed a delicious dinner at Curras... UNTIL A RAT ran over my feet and under the tables. The staff chased the rat through the crowded restaurant into a corner  and then stomped on it in attempt to kill it in front of all of the horrified customers eating dinner. The rat kept squealing  so they used the kitchen broomstick to jab it until it stopped screaming. I don t think I will ever return to this restaurant.
Curra's Grill,423,The food is good when they get it correct  but beware take away orders.  They can t seem to distinguish between corn and flour tortillas.
Curra's Grill,424,Great eats. Great prices. Nice spot  I had the mole chicken enchiladas and enjoyed every second of it.
Curra's Grill,425,Gotta try the avocado margarita. The food is 3-4 star and the service is usually on the slow side but the margaritas make it a solid four 
Curra's Grill,426,One of my favorite restaurants in Austin. My entire family and guests always enjoy it. It is nothing fancy  but consistently serves tasty food. Chips  hot sauce and guacamole are delicious. K so dip is excellent. Tacos of all types are very good  generously portioned with a lot of options. The tamales are delicious. They also have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages and excellent coffee. Also  for those of you who are vegetarian vegan they have many options. If you want a casual Mexican food restaurant that is consistently good I recommend Curras.
Curra's Grill,427,Curra s was awesome  I ll definitely be back   Jake and Rick were very friendly and helpful    The enchiladas asadero were some of the best I ve ever had     That Avocado margarita thoo     
Curra's Grill,428,So it s possible that my boyfriend and I Ordered the wrong thing  I got the burrito with steak and he ordered the ceviche. My burrito was not as flavorful as I would have liked so I had to improvise with some guac and salsa. The ceviche according to my boyfriend was filling  it s an appetizer  but didn t hit the spot as he expected it would. The service was great  They were very patient when we asked to be moved to a both that was within viewing of the TV   the Cowboys were playing  . Wish we could rate this place as a five star since we live so close by to our apartment.
Curra's Grill,429,Service was awful - the waiter was discourteous on all fronts. Flies everywhere in the restaurant. Very dirty tables.  The large guacamole is more like lettuce salad plus one avocado. I think they out mayo or sour cream in the guac  which is gross.  Steak tacos were decent. Blackened fish tacos were decent to good. Chicken fajitas were sub par.  Not planning a return.
Curra's Grill,430,Bomb avocado margies and good food variety. Not my favorite but very solid and worth a try.
Curra's Grill,431,I love curra s tacos and every time I come to Austin I come here but the service has gotten worse and worse.  I placed an order to go and showed up 20mins later when they told me it would be ready.  I went to pay and thru a series of events found out they hadn t even put my order in. I had planned my morning and had 5 people waiting for food and we were on our way to the airport.  This is not the first time this happened to our family it s just the first time I called them out on not putting the order in. The waiter gave me a pathetic excuse about dealing with his 1 table and not having time.  It had been 20mins     the food is good but don t expect to be on time If you are in a hurry.
Curra's Grill,432,Loved it. Cool atmosphere  very clean  efficient friendly staff. I had some sort of migas breakfast dish the exact name of which escapes me. It was mighty fine  and cheap too. I love trying all the different Tex Mex joints in ATX  there s so many of them. And now I have one more on my long list of happy places.
Curra's Grill,433,Food is awesome   I love the avocado margaritas   The service is not so bueno.
Curra's Grill,434,Surprisingly good breakfast tacos.  Good salsa.  Good for lunch.  Parking requires patience  but it s worth it.  Celebrity sighting  The Tribune Editor talking Texas politics over lunch.
Curra's Grill,435,We had really good food  our service was unusually slow  but I could tell it was just our server. I ll be back for the food for sure and well hope for better service next time. Slow  inattentive service won t keep us away.
Curra's Grill,436,Not a fan. I came here is Sept. 2013 for dinner with a few friends to try the avocado margarita. Don t worry about trying it  it taste nothing like avocados. Avocados don t have much flavor to begin with  so it just tasted like a thick margarita. We got the queso  which was really good. I was excited that since the queso was good  the food would be good. For me it wasn t good. I have the enchilada curras  but from the look of other yelp photos  my dish looks like the enchilada Colorado. Which I know I didn t ask for  bc I don t like chipotle sauce. Oh well  either way  I didn t like it. I ate very little of it. My friend had the mole enchiladas and I tried them  I hated them. She didn t hate them  but she wasn t a big fan either. Our other friend got some kind of soft tacos. I believe she had the best meal out of the three of us. I will not be coming back here. Not a fan of the food.
Curra's Grill,437,I ate at Curra s for the first time last night. We sat inside because my friends from Portland didn t want the heat out on the patio  but that meant we were stuck at the table by the Men s room door . The patio doesn t have particularly great ambiance because it s right by the parking lot.  If you want a huge patio with room for kids to run around and nice foliage  this isn t the patio for you.   Our server was super friendly and helpful. He did a great job of describing the different sauces to help us decide. I had the veggie tamales  which were exceptional. The  jr.  plate was huge  4 big tamales  and I brought leftovers home. The chips and salsa were awesome  and they make great Palomas.   It s not the cheapest place around  but the food was fairly priced and worth every penny. Average ambiance  nothing fancy or touristy  that is  with more emphasis on the delicious food and friendly fast service.
Curra's Grill,438,I give this place 4 5 mainly because I wasn t too pleased with my meal but my parents were. Plus the avocado margaritas were incredible. We were all skeptical but all ended up very happy we got them. I thought my meal was a bit too spicy and couldn t eat much of it. I am sensitive to spicy and they said this was the mildest they could do but it was still too much. I ll go back for the margaritas but that s it. My parents enjoyed their food. Also  a bit pricey.
Curra's Grill,439,Best enchiladas that I have ever had and I ve ate a lot enchiladas... the restaurant itself though was kind of dumpy but the food is outstanding huge portions and lots of flavor
Curra's Grill,440,Portions are large and delicious. The staff is attentive and friendly and the manager came out to keep us updated on the status of our wait. We were a fairly large group but the service was still great. I would come back when I visit Austin to get my TexMex fix 
Curra's Grill,441,After my plane from rainy Charlotte landed  I definitely needed some Mexican food. This was the place. Our super friendly waiter went over any ingredients that we didn t recognize  and our order was promptly filled even though it was an awkward three PM. We got the chips and salsa-- salsa is hot and peppery but had a good flavor. The real winner was my Tacos al Carbon. I asked for some chipotle cream sauce on the side as a whim and added it to the smoked steak-- divine. Dad was beyond impressed with his enchiladas  which he built himself with the help of the knowledgeable waiter. A great first impression of Austin 
Curra's Grill,442,The looming inside Curra is nice. Foods is just ok ok. I could have a better Mexican foods.
Curra's Grill,443,I m upgrading my grade to a B for Curra s. On a recent visit I tried the salmon enchiladas  and they were actually quite tasty. They were cheesy without being overwhelming  and the sauce was nice. The charro beans were also pretty good.  I like the chips and salsa - mainly because the chips are corn and not too greasy. Still irks me to pay for chips and salsa  though.  Also  the coffee is excellent. So there s that.
Curra's Grill,444,Recommended by the chick on the plane. Glad she did. Great spot for a casual Mexican brunch.
Curra's Grill,445,Worst margarita in town unless you want non alcoholic  What happened     If you re going to pay for the tequila in the drink  they need to add it to the drinks     
Curra's Grill,446,I ve been to Curra s about four times at this point  and I must express that this restaurant s hype and history do not necessarily reflect the quality of the food.  I know it s tempting to fall in love with a restaurant that has tenure in Travis Heights and claims to offer traditional Tex-Mex comfort food. Maybe it s because I m a new comer to Austin  but I just don t feel that connection to Curra s.  There are things I like about this restaurant. The margaritas are really  very good  especially the mango . I also quite enjoy the soy chorizo molletes.  Otherwise  I ve always had the impression that Curra s is not clean. The menus arrive covered in an interesting film of salsa and bean juice. The restaurant itself is really falling apart and holding on for dear life. It s begging for a remodel and a proper expansion.  As a vegetarian  I have tried every non-meat dish on its menu. I ve had every variation of meat free tamale  enchilada  taco  and burrito. No matter the meal  something is always quite off. The sauce is either very bland  the cheese is hard and cold  or the vegetables are slimy and unseasoned.   I may be back strictly for drinks and appetizers  but I don t plan on having dinner here again.
Curra's Grill,447,had the cucumberita and a regular house margarita both were delicious      only  13 total  our server was great. don t know his name   but great atmosphere    
Curra's Grill,448,I ve been here before when the food was alright  but still nothing to write home about. However  my most recent trip left me extremely disappointed.  I went for lunch with a few coworkers and went through really bad service and really bad food. We were waiting for our food for upwards of 40 minutes  while other groups were sat  served  and given the check even though they were seated after us. And after we finished our meal  we had to wait an additional 15 minutes to get our check. Normally  waiting doesn t bother me too much  but during lunch time they should understand that not most people have an hour limit before they have to be back.  I got a dish that was supposed to have fresh pineapple on top of my enchiladas  but I got gray  overly sweetened  canned pineapple. Needless to say  it ruined the portion of my food it was touching. Additionally  the tortillas definitely did not taste fresh.  Another of my coworkers got the tamales  but found them to still be frozen.   Our waiter never checked on us the entire meal  so we couldn t say whether we enjoyed the food or not  nor did we get any water refills during our lunch.  Another thing I saw was that they keep the towel and cleaning solution bucket right next to the take-out boxes and let s say the workers shaking out the towel didn t try to keep the chemicals in the bucket...  I don t think I ll be back here again unless someone pays me to.
Curra's Grill,449,One of my favorites    Great margaritas  La Flaca . and tacos al pastor are to die for   
Curra's Grill,450,The food was god awful.  Not very good service. Ordered the Curras molletes and I m going to be honest- it was basically hot dog buns with wolf brand chili and cheese on top  baked.    I sent these back immediately.  I ordered the cochinita pibil.  I love cochinita pibil dishes  but I wasn t a fan.  It was a bit on the sour side for me.  Boyfriend ordered the special- basically a chimichanga.  Nothing special.  The avocado margarita was okay.    Overall it was too expensive  and it didn t sit well.
Curra's Grill,451,Walked in  we sat down. Server brought us waters  all cups were dirty. Server rude and no eye contact. Server got upset because we asked him to change our cups. We were there approximately 10 minutes and we never even got to order. We also asked the server to tell us of any lunch special and he just murmurred something and pointed at the menu  in no direction in particular  and walked away. We have ate here before and the experience has been great  but today I would rate this place a one star or below because of the horrendous service.
Curra's Grill,452,Nice dinner - I went at a local s suggestion  glad I did. We drove up and the place looks a little rough  but the service and food made up for that initial impression. This is not your usual Tex - Mex - very authentic dishes from Mexico - I had the Cochinita Pibil - very close to what I have enjoyed in the Yucatan. Beer was ice cold - a lovely evening in all - I will come back the next time I visit Austin  
Curra's Grill,453,They took 15 minutes to attend us and they didnt even ask what we wanted to drink  just gave us water. It then took 20 more minutes to get our food to us  and by this point it was 15 til closing. We had ordered chips and salsa but they never came out with them. The food was cold  average tasting  and too expensive for molletes  veggie enchiladas  queso flambeado and chicken mole. They also gave us the check halfway through eating  basically rushing us out. Overall bad service and food. Will not return.
Curra's Grill,454,If you want to be  hip  in S. Austin  I guess this place is Ok.   I d go elsewhere if I wanted really good food.
Curra's Grill,455,Yelpers have long debated the infamous  morning after  cure.   Well  I m here to tell ya  that Curra s Pappas may in fact  be the holy grail for which ye seek  aka  Mexican equivalent of chili cheese fries.    French fried potatoes smothered in chorizo  chipolte sauce and jack cheese. Looked like they d been set under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the top.   Those with portion control issues  heed warning  Go ahead  unbutton your pants. They re worth it 
Curra's Grill,456,Queso  chips and margaritas are my chosen poison at nearly any Mexican  or TexMex  restaurant. So when I discovered that Curra s does all three expertly  I just had to slide right into that booth.  The queso comes topped with a dollop of guacamole and a sprinkling of those perfect accompaniments. We went through baskets of chips until we cleaned the bowl dry. Of all the melted chili con quesos in the world  Curra s hosts  by far  my very favorite.   Where margaritas are concerned  there s a long list of options with all levels of liquor. Their very famous one is the frozen avocado margarita. For those of you who scoff at the idea  just imagine a frosty limey beverage with a little thicker consistency. Admittedly  it tastes like a less familiar margarita  but I certainly enjoyed it. As for my main glass  I opted for the margarita with a shot of brandy. A fine and strong choice indeed.  My shared burrito was merely the supporting actor to my main queso squeeze but like everything else  this wrap came bulging and satisfied on every level.
Curra's Grill,457,They have a drink called Horni Presidente Rita which translates into  Clinton used more than a cigar  or  I thought her name was Monica  and if you drink 3 of them you will be wondering - if he stuck to the cigar story the whole time - how did she end up with that stain on the black blue dress and why didn t she take it to the cleaners.  Also  if you have 3 of them  it really doesn t matter what you order.  By the way  the garlic Snapper filet is amazing. Pescado al Mojo De Ajo.  Sometimes the rice is dry like sand.
Curra's Grill,458,Went to this place for the first time. Had the Enchiladas Chile Colorado. I love enchiladas. I Love  carne de puerco con chile. An absolute genius decided to put these two wonderful dishes together. The Chile Colorado is very flavorful and the Carnitas are very tender and taste like they ve been simmered in the Chile for a good while. The Charro beans are also very flavorful. The enchilada plate with rice and beans cost me  14  which seems a little pricey  but a good splurge. It was my birthday. TREAT YO SELF 
Curra's Grill,459,Our waiter was really good and nice but I wouldn t go back here again. Their menus were covered in who knows what  like they hadn t been cleaned in years. The avocado margaritas deserve all their hype tho  We got a floater on top cuz we heard the drinks here aren t very strong and it was necessary for sure. I would recommend this place if meeting very casually with someone for drinks  however I don t think I ll be back.
Curra's Grill,460,It s not my first time here but today I have to say that service was horrible  there was only 2 waiters for the entire restaurant  never once saw a Manager or at least someone that appeared  that was in control. Very poor service and management
Curra's Grill,461,Curra s somehow managed to transform my desolate  absolutely irate dad into a giggling puddle in less than 30 minutes. I timed it.   After Mom and I had absent-mindedly left him stranded at a rendezvous point for an hour  we picked him up  though he was beside himself with frustration. Feeling like the d oh-d oh-head daughter that I was that day  I meekly suggested a fairly decent Mexican restaurant that boasted good mole.   At  mole  Dad changed his tune. Started asking how my work was going  how my living arrangements were falling into place  and such. By the time we walked into Curra s double doors he was looking more curious. Less fuming. Good thing.   Enter menus  Gasps  denials  whoops and pointing ensued. This is my Dad happy. Apart from the avocado margarita  neighboring plates of Cochinita Pibil  Pescado a la Veracruzana and something marinated in Coke  I think  completed the final stage of his transformation.

Curra's Grill,462,Worst service I have ever experienced as a restaurant customer in Austin. Was told the wait would be around 20 minutes  waited about 45. When we finally sat down  our waiter Brad was a complete douche. He then served us salsa with a moving bug in it...I repeat  THERE WAS A MOTH BLATANTLY MOVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOWL OF SALSA. Upon realizing this  I notified our waiter  who promptly removed the tarnished salsa  with a big smirk on his face the whole time. Picking up on the fact that we were upset he then returned to the table to ask what to do next. We calmly asked him to cancel our dinners and that we would like the check. They then CHARGED US FOR THE SALSA and for another dish we had already been served. Overall it was a horrible  horrible experience that ruined a night out with some friends visiting from out of town. Please for your own sake  take your money elsewhere.
Curra's Grill,463,It breaks my little heart to write these next four words  I have banned Curras.   Yes its official. My favorite spot that I frequented more than 20 times ... which cured me many a times on a Sunday morning. Has been banned. No not for the food or patio or that delish avo marg or whole wheat tortillas or veg chorizo. No none of that.   The service. To make my sad story short - went here for my kid sista s b-day. Waiter went ballistic on me - literally he yelled at me and said  You ve been acting like that all night     I asked if they could split checks for our party - hey I get it you can t no big  say it don t spray it  Literally yelled - everyone stared. I was honestly scared as he yelled and threw down all his plates - I thought he was going to hit me and so did chubs - because Chubs had to stand up to defend me  amp  tell the guy to calm down. The manager was worthless. Hardly an apology. I was willing to move on from that night. Until I wrote Curra s two seperate emails and recieved no response. That was 2 months ago.   I often wonder what happened to that waiter... not only did he yell at me and my table but he yelled at another table the same night.. .. I feel sorry for the guy .. yellin like that .. well thats gotta be deep in his soul..   Either way I can t bear the thought of going to a place where a night like that was completly ignored by the mgmt.  huge sigh  Goodbye old friend.
Curra's Grill,464,Love the Avocado Margarita  food and Salsa . The reason for  4 stars is the chips... not homemade..
Curra's Grill,465,I m sitting in a somewhat torn vinyl booth looking out onto the authentic patio and the long bench out by the door.  I m looking out into the street that might suggest I could be anywhere.  I take a deep breath  close my eyes and alas...I m in Mexico.  Excuse me sir  can I bring you something to drink   asks this tall clean cut white boy with red hair.  I turn from my window in Vera Cruz and up into the green eyes of Satan.   Why aren t you a hot little senorita with dark hair  brown eyes and maybe a couple of inches of cleavage who can barely speak English   I wonder to myself.   I tremblingly order a coke as I gaze through the menu.  Oh God I m really screwed now.    I m waiting on my friend from Colorado who wanted Tex-Mex  but all I see is a Cochinita pork thing and banana leaf.   Uh sir  better make that a Tecate and can I get an order of the complimentary chips n salsa also    Well they are  1.99 sir  he says.  What   Okay  maintain.  My friend arrives  orders a Tecate too and dives into the chips n salsa.  He turns through the pages of the menu  smiles and sets it aside.  He doesn t know the chips n salsa aren t free yet  but what about whitey the devil and the leaf   He orders the steak fajitas and I get the pescado al mojo de ajo.  We have a couple more Tecates and the bill comes.  Did I pull it off or did they   I got what I wanted.  My friend got his good ol  Tex-Mex and there was no charge for the chips n salsa.  Happy and full we leave.   So what did you think of the place    I asked.  Oh  it was great  really delicious  but what about the white boy waiter      And there you have it.  He was nice and a good waiter  yet my only complaint.  Please know why.
Curra's Grill,466,There are some restaurants in town that do one dish so well   The Dish    they becomes my go-to restaurant for that dish.  When a restaurant becomes a go-to restaurant for a particular dish  I can no longer order anything else from the menu  as I will end up spending the entirety of my meal wishing I had not strayed.  When friends family come to town  you can bet your ass we re stopping by the go-to restaurants.  This is one of those restaurants.  Now as a disclaimer  when I rate a go-to restaurant  I m rating it only on The Dish.  The restaurant may have many other great dishes  but I wouldn t know  because I m not the douchebag who goes to the go-to restaurant and orders anything other than The Dish.  Whether you want to be the douchebag is up to you.  What Curra s does well  and I mean better-than-anyone-else-in-town-and-I-know-because-I ve-fucking-tried-them-all well  is breakfast tacos.  Amazing breakfast tacos made with the kind of love your mother used to use when she cut the crust off of your PB amp J.  What s their secret   After 2 years of detective work  I ve narrowed it down to this   they melt the cheese on the tortilla before they put they put the breakfasty goodness in.  That means you are never served a breakfast taco with a bunch of cold  unmelted cheese stuffed on top that you have to wrap back in the foil and wait 5 minutes for it to melt.  Add to that their special boracho sauce  and no matter your particular ingredients  you ve got the best god damned breakfast taco in town.  But if you want to do it up right  you ll get a sausage  egg  potato  and cheese  at least one on flour and one on corn .  I ve tried every combination of ingredients they have  and after 1 345 692 421 tacos  I can assure you that this is the optimal mix.  If you re a guy  I would recommend 2 tacos if you re only moderately hungry  3 tacos if you re pretty hungry  and 4 tacos if you re really hungry and there s no queso.  If you re a girl  1 taco will probably fill you up  2 tacos should leave you with left overs  and 3 tacos  well  if you can throw down on 3 tacos  we need to hang.  Cause you re cool.  Not hold-hands-and-walk-down-the-beach cool.  More like watch-that-Kobayashi-dude-hoover-fifty-hot-dogs-in-twelve-minutes cool.  But that s damn cool too.
Curra's Grill,467,If you ever  like me  somehow thought that most people shut down on Sundays in anticipation of the burgeoning work week  well  amigo  you would be wrong.  There s a bustling little underbelly that crackles with life on Sunday nights  and this night  the gleaming bulb I found was at Curra s.  I ve been to this location a number of times  but last night was my first crack at the Conchita Pibil  a rich pork leg  plantains  black beans and rice combo whose richness was only matched by the textured melange of the plate before me.  Staff was friendly and at the ready  and never too close for comfort   and our meal came out piping warm and muy delicioso.  Now I know at least a little bit more what the fuss was about here  and thanks to tonight s dinner du jour  I have a new go-to sample on the plate of my life.    A plate that just got considerably more full on Sundays.
Curra's Grill,468,So back and forth I went on Oltorf from my condo to HEB. As these trips progress I always noticed Curras Grill. It was packed and the people that parked their cars were unfortunate parking their cars out on the street. It s a small restaurant but luckily the restaurant was not packed at all.   As my fellow yelpers have warned me  they charged for chips and salsa.  I know sports bar and other places would probably charge for it but I m surprised a Mexican restaurant would charge for chips and salsa. What was interesting was the waitress asked us if we wanted chips and salsa as if it was free. We got the guacamole but it was more expensive then getting the chips and salsa by itself. Chips were decent and the salsa good.   Our food was really good. I had the migas and I think this is the place to go for migas. Stick with the breakfast portion of the menu if you want to go cheap.
Curra's Grill,469,I had one single thing that I enjoyed at this place  the mole sauce.  Everything else was a complete disaster and I can t see how this place consistently gets good reviews.    The avocado margarita s are a totally novelty.  In truth they are chalky  too salty  and just downright weird.  They have only the slightest hint of a margarita taste to them and they are a rip at  8.  Our service was abysmal.  Everything took a million years to come out  my cheese enchiladas were stuffed full of ground beef  we had to walk over to the server station to get the iced tea pitcher to refill our own drinks  and nothing was taken off our bill for all the mistakes and waits.  Actually  the server acted like he did us a favor by taking off something so we thanked him and then realized he just took off the first mistake he made which was bringing me a meat enchilada.    The prices are high and the food is nothing special all.
Curra's Grill,470,Kevin N  my awesome Austin host  brought me here for lunch the other day.  I d told him I was lookin  for some Tex-Mex  when in Rome...   and his pick of Curras was just right.    I had been saving up my appetite for the late afternoon -- most hotel eggs-n-toast are a waste of stomach space in my book.  So  by the time we arrived  I was ready to chow down.  CHOW DOWN. No kiddin  here  folks  I was hungry.   Our server was speedy to the table with the chips and salsa  which I started feverishly devouring right away. However  after we told the server that we needed a minute  he got a little distracted with other customers and seemed to disappear. Luckily  another server noticed our glances  and was happy to jump right in.   I got the Pescado al Mojo de Ajo. I don t remember my Spanish very well  but this was obviously fish  Snapper  plus garlic  two of my favorite things. I wasn t disappointed.  The garlic was nice and flavorful -- a little sweetness to it even -- and it set off the taste of the snapper quite well. Rice  beans  and a fresh little bit of greens with avocado rounded otu the plate.   Of course  even though I started off with a growling belly  I wasn t able to get through quite everything on the plate.  This wasn t for any lack of deliciousness  though. Hope to revisit and try a few more dishes the next time I m in Austin.
Curra's Grill,471,Sad face  indeed.   It was supposed to be a lovely evening. The Dining Partner called to beckon me out to see a film we ve both been dying to see. Our meal spot ended up being Curra s. Lightning did not strike twice  unfortunately.   I ordered these Shrimp Tacos that were more than pretty disgusting. I tried to mask the flavor with black beans and rice  but it was to no avail. Take the phrase  fish flavored vomit  and imagine that taste. Then and only then will you understand what I was trying to choke down. I couldn t even finish.  The saving grace of the night was my amazing Avocado Margarita. I want that in my life all of the time. It s like a milkshake of heaven s best ingredients.
Curra's Grill,472,Avocado margaritas   Sticky booth seats   Veggie Molletes   Stoned-ass waiters   Kiss-ass managers   Nogale sauce   WHY THE EFF DID BOTH NORTH AUSTIN LOCATIONS CLOSE           Note  Avocado ritas best with a buttload of tabasco sauce in  em.  What   Try it 
Curra's Grill,473,Usually a big fan  but after breakfast today  we may not return. Food was tasty until my wife found a hair in her food halfway through eating. Definitely wasn t hers. I saw it and it was a different color and texture. My eyes aren t perfect  but even I could see that  Another waitress takes it back. Our waitress comes back and says she is deleting it from the bill  no problem. That s fine with us. It was  5. Who cares either way    BUT then she KEEPS TALKING  She tells my wife she is sure it s her hair because it wasn t there when she set down the plate  My wife goes into all sorts of reasons that it s not her hair - it was buried in the sauce  it s not her color  etc . . . and she still insisted it was my wife s hair    We did tip  same as the incident at Enoteca Vespaio  but I sort of regret it now. Really weird attitude. Definitely wrong to be so accusatory towards a customer. Probably should have said something. I was just in such shock that someone in customer service would speak that way to us that I just wanted to leave. Doubt I will return. My wife will definitely not.
Curra's Grill,474,Good food and good customer service  food takes while to come out but is worth it. I recommend their oaxacan coffee   
Curra's Grill,475,Sigh. This is a review of the Curras of yore. They took away both of the north locals and those were the ones I used to frequent and that I miss now. What I yearn for  besides the creamy avocado margs and the damn fine guacamole  they do have a way with the little green fruit   is the cochinita pibil. Remember in  Once Upon a Time in Mexico  when Johnny Depps CIA agent was on the search for the best cochinita pibil in Mejico and when he found it he went into the kitchen and killed the cook cause he didn t want anyone else to share in the perfection he d just experienced  Well I think the cooks at Curras would be fearin for they lives cause that is the best pork I have ever put in my mouth  Tender juicy and served with the pickled onions and plantains. Oh mother    So all you peoples that live south  thank your lucky stars that you can hop over to Curras and still experience the ecstasy that is pork leg  Us northerners no longer have that luxury and my memories haunt me.   
Curra's Grill,476,I have honestly enjoyed every meal Ive eaten at Curra s so far.  The only thing that really stood out and comes to mind is the Avacado margarita.  Its fantastic  especially with some spicy food.
Curra's Grill,477,Try the veggie chorizo  in a taco or with a plate . Either way  you can t go wrong. This coming from a carnivore. I grew up in the 04 area  but now I live in the 23. I still drive here through traffic every morning for tacos. Yep  Curras Grill is just that damn good 
Curra's Grill,478,This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town.  I have eaten here many times and have enjoyed the experience every time.  When I really REALLY think about it I am not sure that I am completely enamored with Mexican and Tex-Mex food in the way that many people in this area are.  Sure  I like fajitas as much as the next guy and I have such a low standard for breakfast tacos that I have been driven into ecstasy by no less than two dozen breakfast taco places in Austin.  Heck  I even scarf down the huge breakfast tacos we occasionally get delivered to work even if they are cold by the time they reach my lips.  Not only that  but I will be looking for anyone who does not want theirs.    Wait  wasn t I supposed to be reviewing Curra s   Okay  the point that I am laboriously attempting to make is that if there were more places like Curra s  I would be completely in love with Mexican food.  My ass would also be about thirteen ax handles wide  but that would be okay.    Everything I have had at Curra s has been at least better than good.  I particularly like the carnitas  the tuna dishes  and the tamales  and  yes  I have been driven into ecstasy by their breakfast tacos.
Curra's Grill,479,Good food and had good service...BUT seriously      ...youranAustinrestaurant ...why o why are you serving flour tacos with Mission brand packaged tortillas  ...ridiculous when you can buy homemade fresh flour tortillas  The torts you serve your customers should only be served at Taco Bell...you diminish the quality of your food using those horrible tasting tortillas.   Someone needs to speak with management. If you want to buy packaged tortillas  you might want to consider using the brand Sandy s Tortillas which are packaged in raw form to lock in freshness...once you heat them up they fluff up and are delicious...give them a try.
Curra's Grill,480,Have you ever fantasized about eating dinner while onstage with Nine Inch Nails playing live   Or perhaps having  your ear drum directly attached to blasting tejano music while eating a burrito   Then you will love Curra s    Seriously  this place is so fricking loud   I thought I was going to lose my mind.  The volume of the diners gets so loud I couldn t even hear my friend I was eating with. I get that it s wildly popular  but invest in some acoustic soundproofing  Curras owners  sheesh.  I had eaten here a couple of years ago and had some outstanding enchiladas.  This time i had the fish tacos and they were good but not great.  The fish had a strange  mealy texture.  Perhaps overcooked   I had asked for corn tortillas and they brought mine on flour tortillas.  The servers all seemed confused  I don t think they could hear the customers.  The refried beans were excellent  but the rice was mediocre.  I tasted my friend s carnitas and they were really delicious.   My friend had been craving carnitas and was really excited to eat here  but I will have to be bribed big time to ever go back again.
Curra's Grill,481,I was thinking considering the other reviews I would call this place mediocre  I was wrong. We started with the salsa plate and the variety was great. I enjoyed the mango habanero way more then I thought I would. Our waiter was super knowledgeable and was laid back while still being speedy. I had tamales   I will say they were made very well  not spicy enough for me but I had the roasted salsa to spice it up. Great experience  have faith in my Mexican food ratings   Believe me it s a good call   - 
Curra's Grill,482,My favorite Mexican place in all of Austin.  Mad props to the delicious margaritas  mango and avocado being my favorite   enchilada plates  barracho beans  and the bananas in the rice  costs extra .  Do yourself a HUGE favor and ask for the salsa sampler with your chips.  This array of about a dozen sauces will help you decide which one to get on your entree.
Curra's Grill,483,I discovered Curras a couple of years ago  and have never had a bad meal there.  It initially struck my interest when Texas Monthly Magazine rate its Taco al Pastor the  7 taco in Texas  and some friends as us to go so we gave it a try.   On the plus side   1  Curra s has my favorite tortillas in Austin.  I hated corn before finding this place  and now I can t get enough if it.  2  Their enchilladas are also my favorite in town.  The fillings are always nice and juicy  and they compliments those fantastic tortillas well  3  The prices are amazingly cheap.  4  Whether it be the carne guisada  burrito  enchilladas  tamales  or the brunch  I have been a fan of every dish that I have hare  On the down side   1  The service has been spotty at times.  Never rude  just has a little too much of that laid back Austin feel.  2  On a weekend you re looking at a pretty long wait  as this place isn t very large considering its reputation  and there isn t ample space to wait  so many end up outside  3  Parking is kind of a mess  as the lot is also small  4  You have to pay a couple of dollars for chips and salsa  noting that this fee is waved if you buy guacomole or queso.  For me this isn t a big deal as the queso is only  5  and I d get that anyway  For me  the crowd  the wait  and the so so service are worth it as this really is some of the best interior mexican around.
Curra's Grill,484,Two words  Breakfast. Tacos. Let me say it again  Breakfast Tacos.   Mmmmmm.   Sorry  I got distracted. Visions of veggie chorizo dancing in my head and whatnot.   Anyway  Curra s does breakfast tacos in a style that should make this city proud. Ever since moving to Austin  I have started a love affair with the things. I cook  em  I order  em  I love  em. And Curra s does a pretty great version.   My standard order consists of egg  potato  cheese and veggie chorizo--the ingredient that I think really makes these babies stand out. I m not a vegetarian  but I love this less-greasy-but-oh-so-delicious addition to my breakfast tacos. The tacos come with a salsa on the side  but I prefer the  what I consider to be  more flavorful salsa that is served with their chips. I always ask for it  and the servers are nice enough not to mock me for my special request.   To be fair  I haven t really ventured past breakfast at Curra s  so I can t speak to the rest of their menu. But if you re looking for a great  and cheap   breakfast or brunch  these warm  savory breakfast tacos are where it s at. Oh--and if you like coffee  make sure to try the a Cafe Oaxaco. It s a dark-roast with hints of vanilla  and boy it is good.  I once saw a guy stagger into Curra s looking pretty hungover just to buy a bag of the stuff. That s saying something. 
Curra's Grill,485,I ve been here a couple of times and every time I come here I say I ll never come back. The food just doesn t taste good to me. I came to Curra s last night and ordered lamb empanadas and I literally could not eat it. I also ordered a skinny Rita which was waay too sweet and just not worth  10. The ladies room smelled like someone had peed all over the floor. I don t know why people come here...
Curra's Grill,486,This is an excellent place to eat.  Besides being listed in Mexican  you could also list it in Tex-Mex.    I eat veggie and they have a several selection of dishes in most categories.  It tends to be busy.  Went with a group a couple days ago and we waited for awhile.  I have had their Tamales and their Veggie tacos. Both excellent.  There is outdoor seating as well as indoor.  I will go there again.  Of course living and working near by helps.  I upped this to a 5 because the more I go the more I like it.  Lots of great paintings on the walls from local artists adds to it as well as the endless bowls of hot chips.
Curra's Grill,487, And you get another Gold Star.   Aw Curra s.  Stopped in for some brunch today lateish for Austin on a Sunday.   Avocado Margaritas  Excellent   Breakfast Tacos  Excellent   Service  Spectacular  Not waiting longer than 15 min. on a Sunday after 11 30   An extra Star from Ryanasarus.
Curra's Grill,488,Inconsistent         Major wrinkle-causing frown face.  SO was craving Curra s food - especially the rice. Weird  right  He said he liked it so much that first time  we had to go back. Except the rice was orange today  and the rice we liked was white  with veggies. Uhm - wha  The waiter explained it s white rice only on Friday  Saturday and Sunday. Why  God  why   The veggie tacos were a lot less flavorful this time. A few bites in I check things out  and find something... not right. Green mushy stuff  That looked like slugs - or worse  OKRA   I ask SO what the hell it is  and he tells me it s cactus. It s what   Cactus. When we got it on a Sunday  it was veggie chorizo with crispy veggies  peppers  onions and the like  with flavorful seasonings. This time it was slugs. Puke.  As if to drive home that you could indeed have a bad dining experience at Curra s  they also hired screaming children   to sit at a table nearby. They even hired a pregnant woman to play the role of an idiot mother who allowed the supreme screamer to continue at full volume. SO and I were concerned that she would be having another kid to parent moronically and ruin even more dinners.  Sorry folks  but the first time your kid throws an unjustified scream-fest  threaten to take them home then follow up on the threat  even if it ruins your meal once or twice. Next time  they ll know you mean business and will stop when you ask them to. It IS NOT better to just let them scream and get over their  phase  eventually.   Finally  right on queue  the waiter spilled my water all over my lap and onto my special shoes. During the clean-up  the last bit of margarita I had was also removed  and I was left with freezing skirt and a reserved spot for that last margarita gulp.   The manager  I think   came out and offered us dessert to go  and that was nice  reluctant  1 star . But overall  I m sad. Maybe the avocado margarita was the only real connection we had  and I mistook it for love.    Nothing against okra  but if your grandma slow-stewed them for like 72 hours and you and your cousins spent a summer putting them all in baggies to throw them on the roof of the house  and that s all you ever knew about them  you d hate okra  too.     I understand this wasn t exactly Curra s fault.  1 star. 
Curra's Grill,489,The winning point to come here for brunch   The Oaxacan coffee.
Curra's Grill,490,I truly get a tear in my eye when I read reviews for Curra s that explain horrendous experiences patrons have had with service and tasteless food.  I want them to give them another shot.  Please  for me.   lower lip forced down  puppy dog eyes in full effect .  This is the first place I think of EVERY time someone asks me where I want to go to dinner.     Motulenos in the morning will cure your ills  whether they are beer vodka related  opposite sex annoyances   I could have done without that curve ball life just threw at me  downers  and the like.  The dish consists of refried black beans  a fried egg   cotija cheese  maybe  and bananas.  Very simple  but the banana adds just the right amount of  WTF   for your taste buds.     This is the place that taught me veggie chorizo existed.  Cornerstone in life moment... similar to your first car   ahem  first time  first veggie chorizo mollete. You know  don t you     I also love the concept and the creaminess of the avocado margarita.  I have had to force less adventurous types to taste it  and they are always pleasantly surprised.  I do have a bone to pick with the lack of tequila.  I am a pretty solid lightweight when it comes to liquor  so if I don t have much of a buzz after one of these  there is some splainin  to do.  Their patio is small  but there is always a seat  even when they are crowded.    I  personally  have had good to great service each time I was there  except one.  This leads to why my fave has 4 instead of 5 stars.  Went once where we waited outside at a table  after moving from the itty bitty bar  for 30 mins with no one asking us if we needed another margarita  hell yes we do  or if we wanted to order.  I chalked it up to the new waiter  who is no longer there.  I am obviously a little more patient at my fave place than I would have been if it were my first time.   I am a fan.
Curra's Grill,491,If I may  the avocado margarita is like a heavenly mix of the old orange julius  my mom used to make and the twinge of lime you get from key lime pie. Creamy   citrus   home run.  Also I ve tried the octopus  amp  shrimp  after making sure the shrimp was local  ceviche  as well as the blackened snapper tacos  and the consensus is - Curra s is among the most bang for your buck you can get in Austin. The quality is top-notch  the service is friendly  and the prices are practical. I can t believe I didn t try it sooner.
Curra's Grill,492,Mammamia  Pappapia  yummy tamales and tortillas    I have always had good food here....especially the tamales    MMM...any of the tamales are great....  Watch out for the parking  it is sketchy     Oltorf is so narrow right around where this is  I usually take a paper bag with me when trying to park to breathe into  kidding  kind of ....  The prices and atmosphere make this a great place to try for some Tex Mex sumthin  sumthin.....try it 
Curra's Grill,493,Woah woah woah.  2 for chips and salsa with absolutely no fucking indication of that whatsoever until the CHECK  Welcome to my 1 star review.   This place would be 4 stars  BUT the menu SUCKS. No prices on drinks  no prices on desserts  no list of available drinks  no info on what 14 different choices you re going to be asked to choose from when you order an enchilada. Come on Curra s  get your shit together. Redo your menu and get RID of charging  2 for chips and salsa and I ll maybe  MAYBE consider coming back. But that s such bad business it s a huge maybe.  PLUS I got a  sweet  tamale that was inedible. And to top it all off  service was meh.
Curra's Grill,494,Curra s is a staple for us. Here s why   - awesome queso  we get it filled but sub the veggie chorizo  - good  cheap breakfast tacos - delish margaritas I can indulge in when not pregnant - huevos sucios  heaven   For a while  we were eating here once a week. It s affordable and reliable  food-wise.   So  why not give it five stars  Sometimes the service is not so fab. This hit or miss quality of the waitstaff just makes me a little nervous about going whole hog with 5 stars.
Curra's Grill,495,I can t believe how often this place is mentioned as one of the best tex-mex restaurants in town. It is not.  If Nicole L wants to know why the North Austin locations closed  it s because Curra s is not good....not good at all. Plus  the service at the Burnet location  which is where the new location of The Frisco Shop is  was absolutely horrible. Slow  rude and non-attentive. Only took me one visit to that crap-hole to realize I d never eat there again.  Now...back to the location reviewed here. From the small parking lot to the  austin hip  waitstaff  it s nothing but a disappointment. To be honest  I haven t been there in a couple years. Why you ask  The main reason is that IT SUCKS    The food is average at best. You can go to any fast food mex place and get better tacos. I could list other things that are lame about this place  but why  Just suffice it to say this is one of the most overrated restaurants in town.
Curra's Grill,496,After all the hype I was a little disappointed in the avocado margarita. It was indeed  pretty tasty  very different  It was also  however   6.50. In a place where you don t want to touch anything  let alone anything in thw bathroom   maybe they could knock a buck off or have a special to be competitive.  Also coming in at  6.50 was some mexican mocha concoction with enough brandy it to burn a hole in your throat. It surprised the hell out of me. At first  I wasn t that into it  but as it cooled down and I mixed in the whipped cream tower  yes   I became a fan. Now that I know what to expect  this could be something I crave.  The chilaquiles my date got were exceptional  great sauce  loads of crunch  and really fun to say out loud   I fully intend on ordering this next time because I had food envy. I got the grilled fish tacos  tasty  and the chipotle sauce like Amanda says  is truly naughty   but just those chilaquiles...also  the tacos were like 9 bucks. Granted you could get whole wheat tortillas  and the fruit salsa was fancy...but I dunno. Seemed a little rough for a couple bites of fish....or maybe I m just cheap.  Pricing is the only reason I m not giving this place 5 stars.    Alas  I will be back to get in on those chilaquiles and  when the mood strikes  another avacado marg or mocha thingie.
Curra's Grill,497,I m sure everyone s said everything there is to say about Curra s  seeing as how there s 299 reviews for this place  but I ll just rehash some of the points.  Avocado marg  Yum. Imagine a smoothie with tequila in it. And it s green.  Blackened fish tacos  Also yum. The rice is tasty  the refried pinto beans are good  and the fish tacos are fresh and spiced just right.  Tacos al pastor  Also a good choice. The meat is really tender and nicely seasoned.  Really  you can t go wrong with anything on their menu.  The only sh tty thing about Curra s is their parking. Fergawdsakes  get a bigger parking lot. Buy out Valero s next door if you have to  and just turn it into additional parking. Kthnxbai.
Curra's Grill,498,So the Avocado Margarita was kind of an interesting innovation.  Thankfully tangy  without being sweet  sweet being the bane of a good Margarita experience .  It also had an interesting creaminess from the Avocado.    That s where the superlatives end and this place turns into yet another gooey chese  refried beans  Mexican joint.  Not bad  but nothing good.  Oh yeah  and the service was slow and kind of slackery which always kind of annoys me.  Guess I m too Type A for the laid back Austin thang.
Curra's Grill,499,Curra s has great drinks  great food  and a great atmosphere.  I ve always been impressed by the service - every server has always been very nice  helpful  and laid-back.   Definitely try the Avocado Margarita. It has a really interesting taste  amp  is more like a smoothie than a traditional marg. I have also tasted the Presidente  strong  but good   amp  the regular margarita on the rocks. All good  and not too expensive   As far as food goes  I like the guacamole for an appetizer - again  cheap  amp  tasty. Carnitas are great  the fajitas are great   amp  I ve heard good things about the tamales  amp  tacos.   Go to Curra s  even if it s just for a drink and some guacamole 
Curra's Grill,500,Edit  Come here for the migas. One awesome egg-experience plus one OK one  below  equals 4 stars.  waiter was great  menu was OK  dishes weren t much to brag about. my dad had the tacos al pastor  and he said the meat was great  he even liked the beans  which he normally doesn t. his girlfriend had spinch-mushroom quesadillas  which she pecked at  but which she said were pretty good. I had the  award winning vegetarian enchiladas   and I can t believe they won any award. the squash inside was clearly unripe and not fully cooked. they were far too smothered in cheese and had one or two crunchy corners where there shouldn t have been any crunch. rice was lovely  beans were great  and lard free  .
Comedor,1,Snagged a lucky last minute reservation to Comedor while visiting from Kansas City. They sat us 30 minutes early  which was amazing.   The restaurant is beautiful  really nice aesthetic touches through out. Our table was in the open air area of the dining room  which was perfect for the weather.   Ordered a ton off the menu but only managed to get a few pictures  sometimes you just have to enjoy what you re eating and forget about the phone.   We loved basically everything we got but one of the fish tortas  which was just ok.   Mezcal Margarita was delicious  bone marrow tacos are super rich  so definitely recommend splitting between more than 2 people  and getting dessert is a must.   TIP  Visit Garage  next door. It s a super cute cocktail bar great for pre or after dinner drinks 
Comedor,2,Wonderful food but if it starts to rain  do not expect them to honor your reservation time even though they have texted you a half hour in advance to make sure you are on time.    My advice is simply cancel and go across the street to Lonesome Dove.    If it starts to rain  they move their outdoor guests inside and you will be delayed 45 minutes to an hour without notice.    Their hostesses are clueless and they seat recently arriving parties before you.
Comedor,3,Absolutely adorable hidden gem. I couldn t find it and then I found it. Very open and airy interior with a fantastic brunch vibe.   Brunch was just ok and for the price I ve had better. I d give all food a 5.5 and apparently the quesadilla was a10 but it s cow tongue so I ll pass.   Nothing memorable about the food but the service and ambiance were fantastic. I ve heard great things about dinner so I ll have to venture back and give it a try
Comedor,4,We walked past this place as we didn t notice the dark colored restaurant name against the black door. The interior was really pleasant looking. We sat at one of the communal tables but inside the restaurant there is a small outdoor patio that looks even more delightful for a dinner in a late September weather. That s where I would ve booked our table next time    Very friendly waiter. We went with 4 dishes shared between the two of us. My favorite was the octopus. It was grilled to perfection  soft to the bite  not chewy at all  perfectly seasoned  salty the way I like it. My second favorite was the bone marrow tacos. Our waiter asked if the bone marrow tasted rich. Frankly  it didn t taste rich at all. The dressing on the kale and the lime juice balanced all of it out. It was a delicious dish    We also got the charred squash with black beans. I really like the black beans. My husband liked the grilled carrots with orange mole sauce.   Amazing dinner  Will come back here again.
Comedor,5,The food was delicious and filling  but fyi this place is hidden and not by accident. When a worker saw my girlfriends and I walking past the door he asked what we were looking for and explained they only want people to dine there who  know where they re going . It was a little off-putting but the interior was so whimsical and stunning I forgot all about what he said until now. This is a tapas-style  upscale Mexican restaurant. I shared the Avocado Tostada  Tuna Aguachile and Texas Mushroom Quesadilla with a friend and it was the perfect amount of food. Plus the drinks were fresh and original. Will definitely dine here again and next time I ll know how to get there.
Comedor,6,Came here for brunch with a few friends. The space is really beautiful and the vibes were great  I d say the food was just ok. We got the pastry plate  huarache and the mcconcha. The pastry plate was probably my favorite  the churro was amazing. I thought the huarache was a bit too salty and the mcconcha wasn t too different from a typical breakfast sandwich. I d come again to try dinner just for the atmosphere.
Comedor,7,The cocktails are amazing     Tortilla weren t that great. The chicken was too salty. The tap water tasted pretty off. Tostada tasted a bit stale. There was a lot of touches that made the food ok but not great. Service was great and the ambiance was pretty nice. I will probably come back but only to have a nice cocktail.
Comedor,8,A family favorite in Austin  The indulgent bone marrow tacos are indeed a must-order every time -- they are paired with smoked butter and a pecan gremolata that are just  chef s kiss   The tamal de chocolate dessert is also super rich.  The first time we visited  we were particularly blown away by a charred cabbage dish and the veggies in general  my sister thought the carrots were revolutionary   the second time  we felt that the veggie dishes we ordered were a little too salty. Regardless  we continue to applaud Comedor s vibrant flavors and delicious sauces  and will keep coming back.  Last Dined  November 25  2021
Comedor,9,Perfect brunch spot  All the dinning is outside but covered it is so unique and cool. The ambiance is exceptional. I came here for a birthday brunch with a few girls. The staff wrote her a birthday card and all signed it. The food was delicious and family styled so we could try lots. I can t wait to come back again soon to try dinner 
Comedor,10,I came to Comedor to meet a friend for happy hour this week. We both ordered the micheladas on draft  and I thought they were great. I loved the spicy rim and hot sauce mixed throughout. We also ordered the smoked tuna tostada and the mushroom quesadilla. Both were tasty  but I was obsessed with the blue corn tortilla the quesadilla was made with   Overall  the service was the best part of my experience at Comedor. Everyone I interacted with was so professional and welcoming. I really love that in a restaurant  especially ones like Comedor that have a luxurious  artsy atmosphere.   I wish I could give 4.5 stars  because this place totally deserves them. The only criticism I have is that the food is a bit overpriced.
Comedor,11,This is quite a unique space to dine. I arrived in the early evening about 5 o clock and although it was considerable daylight still  using natural light in an atrium style felt too dark. The sound was difficult to talk over and for these reasons I m not sure I would go back again. Although the staff were friendly and fairly responsive  the food was quite enjoyable.
Comedor,12,The food was good  but nowhere near the price they are commanding. 3 stars for decent food and sexy ambiance. I wish they had more variety in cocktails too  I wasn t a fan of any that I had and I m not usually particular with cocktails.   We went for my birthday and our table was 40 minutes late. I understand there are some things you can t prepare for so we tried to make the best of it at the bar. The ribeye was good  but the mole was not an ideal pairing in my opinion.
Comedor,13,Trendy  fun  tasty -- and a bit overdone.   Date of Visit  9 30 22   I ve been to Comedor twice  and I ve left both feeling the same way -- a really neat building with great energy  super tasty cocktails  and a wildly interesting menu -- albeit many dishes have a little too much going on. Prices are a bit high for what you get  but that s pretty unsurprising for the area.   All that said  I d go again. Don t miss out on the Tuna Aguachile  Tacos de Pescado  or Bone Marrow Tacos.
Comedor,14,Absolutely fabulous food  service  cocktails  wines selection   We couldn t say enough good things about this restaurant.   Beautiful space and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly   Do not be deceived by the items on the menu  everything looks simple but is fantastic   We had 6 courses and we are more than satisfied but interestingly not stuffed or heavy.    Love Love Love
Comedor,15,This chef is amazing  and her talents show in her dishes - from the simple salad to the complex aguachile.  Came here for a date night and loved the vibe and set up.  Honestly this was the best  high end food we had in our visit to Austin. Just oozes Oaxaca flavors. My favorite was the Tuna Aguachile and Steelbow Salad  shocker  I know . The seaweed chicharon on the Aguachile was so tasty and unique - more of this please.  Would definitely come back.
Comedor,16,Comedor is a place perfect for date night  small group gatherings with the dark atmospheric vibe but beware that it is pricey. Very little lighting...resulting in flash photography needed for food pics and videos.   Main entry door is sort of hidden  Fiance and I almost entered at the service side door.   Love the industrial architecture by the famous Architect Kundig.   Our whole table ordered several dishes to have shared with our significant other. To be honest it was hard to really share most dishes with a large group because of the portion size.   Dishes my fianc  and I shared  bone marrow tacos  avocado tostado and NY strip steak. The NY strip was cooked to perfection but the sauce was a little off.   Everyone at the table agreed that the bone marrow tacos were flavorful but too greasy. Holding the taco in hand you automatically see a flood of oil dripping down onto our plates. Corn tortilla were on the thicker side which I didn t mind being that they didn t break down easily as traditional thin corn tortillas.   Avocado tostado were a hit but really hard to share between more than two people like I said...portions are small.  Be prepared to spend    . I was actually a little hungry after our dinner and we spent a little over  200 per person  cocktails included .  I hope to come back and try their happy hour menu as I don t think I would come back for dinner.
Comedor,17,This place is gorgeous  from the street very unassuming but when you walk in  it s like you re in a secret dinner club. The dark decor  high ceilings  the patio is relaxing and soothing with a very sexy vibe. It s really meant to give you an intimate dining experience away from it all.  This space was definitely architected and designed by someone with a vision  and the food is a great compliment to the atmosphere  creative  reimagined  and delicious.   We sat at the bar and had amazing service from our bartender  great drinks  and menu suggestions.    We started with the sunchoke tostada  great flavor  creative presentation  and all about the ingredients.   We had the mushroom quesadilla  this was good  but not creative like other dishes on the menu  but a solid vegetarian option.   Next  we had the Tuna Aguachile  this was delicious  and gave you a kick of spice. The way it was presented was unique  in a cold sauce that you would eat like a broth.   Finally  we had the half chicken with mushrooms  it came with tortillas to eat it like tacos. My only issue with this dish was it was salty.   I will definitely come back when I m in Austin on a warm summer night to enjoy the patio.
Comedor,18, How was the food    Meh....and such tiny portions   It s impossible not to begin with the portion size at Comedor. If your menu is a  shareable  menu then the portions should be shareable sized. Not the case here where everything is served in doll house proportions. The tostada was laughably small and to call it something you could share was ridiculous. At least it s also over priced and not particularly tasty. That said  the cocktails were fine in that typical way these kind of trendy spots that have overtaken Austin make interesting overpriced cocktails. If you re really jonesing for something in this vein Suerte is a better option but honestly  if Mexican food is what you re looking for just go to Matt s El Rancho and eat a real meal.
Comedor,19,Comedor is an incredibly dark restaurant  both hard to find on the outside and hard to navigate on the inside. That said  it has beautiful architecture and reminds me of being in Mexico at a dark restaurant at night.  The bone marrow is the best I have ever had due to the combination of the delicious gremolata topping and accompaniments. We really loved the tostada and cocktails as well.   In all  I d say this is a must visit restaurant in Austin  but as far as modern Mexican food goes I would recommend ATX Cocina as the best in Austin. There is room for two great contemporary Mexican restaurants  and they both offer a unique and delicious menu.
Comedor,20,Quite possibly my favorite resto in Austin  Seriously. Excellent - and endlessly inventive - food  with great ingredients  a seemingly infinite selection of mezcals  and staff that are all too happy to work you through what you should be eating and or drinking. I ve been there almost every week  and have not gotten tired of it yet...
Comedor,21,This place was so cute and the aesthetic was great. Also amazing customer service. I thought it was overpriced though and the food was great but not amazing.
Comedor,22,Food was great  mostly. The half chicken entree came out RAW  I m sure it tastes good when cooked but ours was not and was returned. All the other entrees were great tasty. They came out little by little  chef recommended    I also want to note portions were kinda small  however it was delicious.  We went for dinner and as the night went on when the lights were dim the place got DARK  almost too dark we sat in a booth . I m a visual person  the plates were pretty but hard to take in visually lol
Comedor,23,Perfect ambience for couples. You hardly see bright light any where. Its Candle lit.    Food its really different compared to traditional Mexican places. Its more like Mexican Fusion. We enjoyed the food. Best part is the dessert - Mexican Affogato. What a perfect ending  
Comedor,24,The atmosphere and architecture of Comedor are a highlight alone. But the 5-stars don t end there as the food lived up to the ambience. We came for brunch and had a breadth of the menu. Next  we ll be coming back for dinner and can t wait.
Comedor,25,I ll start off this review by saying that this restaurant is definitely a must-visit mainly for the modern chic decor and the impeccable service  The food  on the other hand  was not too impressive. I still gave 4 stars because I m feeling generous and I would probably go back for the ambiance and service alone. Firstly  the restaurant is inconspicuously located and marked by a black door  making it all the more alluring. The interior is dark and trendy and it opens up to a beautiful garden space filled with succulents and fountains. We went with our two year old at around 5 30 pm and while it doesn t seem like the best setting for a toddler  they were very accommodating. The dishes seemed appetizing based on the menu descriptions  but were bland in my opinion. We ordered the fish tacos  quesadilla and salad and none of them were particularly noteworthy. The one item that was noteworthy however was the chocolate dish we got for dessert  I would love to go back and hope to see more flavor and variety on their menu.
Comedor,26,I saw that LAND did interior design and or brand identity for Comedor and felt inclined to check them out. LAND has done a lot of Austin TX stuff I enjoy  like Easy Tiger and Madre Mezcal.   Comedor came across like a speakeasy with their entrance and door barely visible from the street. The interior has very brutalist styling and feels pretty chic  and cold  TBH .   Food vibes  I compare it to Eberly meets Barley Swine.  We got the tuna tostada  fish tacos  and bone marrow tacos. I thought all 3 were just OK. I m not ever going to get an urge to go back for any of it.   Expensive. One of the handful of restaurants I ve booked in Austin that exceeded  200  we got two appetizers  one entree  one dessert  and 4 cocktails .  Great cocktails.
Comedor,27,The food is pretty good and I highly recommend grabbing a drink next door at garage. We sat at the bar and had a great time with the Comedor bartenders who were generous and knowledgeable about their spirits. The grilled octopus was perfect and you have to try a dessert from their James Beard nominated pastry chef. We had a great time although for some reason it was FREEZING inside. Probably felt in the low 50s so cold  I have no idea why they keep it so cold when it s 70 outside. Otherwise  an enjoyable meal for sure. It s not the best Mexican food in Austin but it sure is good and I m sure you ll have a nice time too.
Comedor,28,If you are celebrating an anniversary  this is the place to go. We were given a handwritten card and it made the occasion all the more special.  Some tips  -Getting a reservation was simple but they do charge  25 per person if you end up cancelling -Street parking is almost impossible to find. They do have a parking lot right next door and offer valet -The restaurant is also slightly hidden so keep a look-out for a large set of doors and a really small sign -Happy hour menu is only if you are sitting at the bar   This review is mainly based on the service  ambiance  and drinks  seeing as we ordered only one appetizer and about 4 drinks each .   The service was impeccable. Our server was Tyler. He was incredibly knowledgable and checked in on us often. If you are overwhelmed by the drink menu  just ask  He recommended some off-menu cocktails and ran through the entire mezcal menu with us.  Sit outside if possible   The greenery  the bar space displaying all their liquor  and the overall ambiance of their dining area is perfect. It is obvious that the owners really care about the atmosphere and dining experience. Even the bowls and spoons were very chic.  I NEED to come back to try the bone marrow tacos.
Comedor,29,We went here for dinner for our friend s 30th birthday when visiting Austin  TX  Amazing Mexican-inspired food and drinks and impeccable service. We were a little thrown off when we entered the restaurant as it was VERY dim lighting  50 shades of grey-esq vibes because the full restaurant had dark interior style and was completely dark with little candle lights on the tables . We tried a bunch of dishes to share between 7 gals   - Ranch Ribeye - meat was tender and very flavorful  one of our top picks  - Hongas Tostada - beautiful flavors with a kick and the pickles accompanied with it was a great touch.  - Half Chicken - very moist and not much to say here.  - Bone Marrow Tacos - can t go wrong with bone marrow - its literally meat butter. one of our top picks  - Smoked Tuna  Octopus  Shrimp Tostados  - Shrimp Tacos - one of our favorites  My favorite thing about the meal was the blue corn tortilla accompanied with many dishes - it was warm and a different type of tortilla I ve ever tasted. Never seen it here in Boston  MA.  In summary  I would check it out for a special occasion dinner if in Austin  TX as it is on the pricier end.
Comedor,30,Entrance is nondescript but once you open the door the interior is chic and welcoming to enjoy a good dinner. I came around 5pm so I didn t experience the darkness others did.  We ordered a variety of dishes  really enjoyed the bone marrow tacos  had a little sweetness to them . Other dishes on the appetizers were a little bit too salty and spicy for our taste  but this is Mexican food  .  I also enjoyed several of the clase azul reposado  the real reason I came here as that s been hard to find .  Staff is great  and they explain everything we.
Comedor,31,Came here for my brother s birthday brunch  The inside has a really cool modern industrial feel. The Damiana Mimosa was definitely the most unique and fanciest mimosa I ve had.  Our waitress recommended ordering family style and gave a lot of good recs.   We started with the pastry plate. Really interesting pastries such as s mores concha  tomato jam scone  and guava kouign Amann.  Next  came the huarache. Probably our least favorite dish - too sour and healthy tasting lol. The McConcha was my favorite. I d probably get this for myself if I wasn t doing family style. Having the concha as the sandwich was the move.  Last was the carne asada. The purple tortillas were pretty and soft. Not a ton of meat sadly and some was chewy.   Prices were kinda high for the portion sizes but it was a unique brunch experience with interesting dishes.
Comedor,32,Really cute place and the food and drinks are amazing  Can t wait to be back again. Service was on point.
Comedor,33,Guaranteed you will walk past looking for the door - such a cool place but very unassuming from the outside. It s fairly small but offers three seating options - high table  restaurant or patio. The patio is beautiful and feels like you just have a giant skylight. Great service and staff. If you re checking out the menu and planning ahead  everything is served as small plates to share with the table. We had bone marrow tacos - you scoop out the bone marrow and fill a tortilla  and it melts in your mouth. The chocolate dessert was very rich but we shared so all good. We also had the sorbet  pork Pibil tacos  YES   as well as the fish and some vegetarian options. Also some great cocktails 
Comedor,34,Interesting variety of foods and beautiful interior. I really loved the unique cocktail selection  the bone marrow tacos  the ribeye  and the deserts.   The interior is very dark and subject to weather changes. It gets hot in the summer and cold in the winter because the outdoor area is connected via large glass garage doors that are always up. So  bring a jacket on the winter time and dress comfortably in the summer  or go while the weather is gorgeous .
Comedor,35,I can only speak great things of my experience at Comedor. From the ambiance  to the service and attentiveness of the staff and not to forget the food and cocktails were procured. Highly recommend the dishes we ordered. Forced to go back to try the octopus  Can t wait 
Comedor,36,Coming here  it s easy to forget that you re in downtown Austin. The ambiance here is enough to transport you into another realm  This is a perfect place for a classy candle lit dinner.  Although  it is super dark here so be prepared   The food was delicious  especially the fish tacos and desserts. Even though the dishes we ordered were fairly simple  the flavors were unique and memorable. The architecture is absolutely stunning as well - that alone was what initially drew me into dining here.
Comedor,37,We totally enjoyed the place. The service  our bartender Seth so knowledgeable and attentive to all details and food pairing
Comedor,38,Unforgettable bone marrow tacos. They re worth going here for even if you get nothing else  but the vibe and service wat excellent as well.
Comedor,39,Absolutely loved this place  It s hidden in plain sight but such a gorgeous space as soon as you walk in. We went in recently for a date night and were not disappointed. We started with a few Repo Ginger cocktails which were phenomenal - and dangerously easy to drink  For starters  we did the Smoked Tuna  Octopus  amp  Shrimp Tostada  Tuna Aguachile  and the Texas Mushroom Quesadilla. The tostada was incredible  amazing flavor and generous portion. For the mains  we did an order of the Tacos de Pescado and the Bone Marrow Tacos. Both were substantial in portion and delicious to the very last bite  We typically like to eat - like EAT eat - and we struggled to finish everything  but it was so worth it. Service was good  and the ambiance  and decor was so unique to anything else here in Austin. We will definitely be back 
Comedor,40,Soooo good  I was so looking forward to coming here and was bummed when I thought I may not get an reservation. I called one evening and they had just had a cancellation. The space is just perfect. Moody  modern  and chic.  I don t recall our server s name  which is why I need to start doing reviews in more real time. But Bone Marrow tacos were the STAR  Also mushroom tacos were unbelievable. Those were the ones we thought we d like the least and ended up being a favorite to the marrow tacos. Will certainly be back on next trip to ATX.
Comedor,41,Brunch review. Dis-ap-point-ed. I was so looking forward to this meal  and now am shockingly disappointed. This place is all over the  best of  and  best new   and in my book that added up to five star expectations. Not even close for our Mother s Day brunch.   I had actually booked this place for brunch in 2020  but Covid of course spoiled those plans. So imagine my delight at getting reservations for this years Mother s Day  Too good  huh   The place is beautiful  as you probably already know. That is  if you can find the entrance. A bit of a chore to spot it. Once inside it is a beautiful place. Our service also was very good  as you would expect .   I had coffee with brunch  and it was served in a ceramic cup  not a mug - no handle . Cool idea  except for the burning fingers part. Yes  they served piping hot coffee in a cup with perhaps the best heat conducting potential of any material on the planet  so that the heat travels straight to your hand on the other side. I had to ask for a napkin to wrap around it. Better than lukewarm coffee  though  that s for sure.   I could not resist ordering the mouth watering-sounding Pambazo. Instead of the spicy  stuffed beauty I was expecting  I basically got a bread sandwich. The bread seemed more glazed with spice  rather than dipped and grilled  and the result was two very thick pieces of bread. Filling included black bean  avocado a fried egg  and picadillo. There was so little filling that  again - it was just a bread sandwich. The picadillo - what I imagined might be a good sized portion - was so thinly spread on the beans that it was hard to tell that it was supposed to be a constituent of the sandwich. The picadillo and black bean might as well have been condiments. And sorry to say  the fried egg was not enough to make the meal.  Maybe the only semi-redeeming dish was the pancake with cajeta and brown butter. I love cajeta  so I m not sure this could have been made badly enough for me to not like it. It was good. The pancake was cooked well  and the sauce  while not too sweet  provided a delicious and different sort of flavor.   Overall  however  really disappointed.
Comedor,42,Recently went to Comedor to celebrate my 39th birthday and there were two reasons I chose it over many other options  1  great outdoor dining option  sp trying to stick to outdoor areas  and 2  their food is delicious    It did not disappoint. Not only was the outdoor dining area as lovely as I remembered but they ve also managed to make it pretty warm and cozy with heaters throughout the space. We even took our coats off at one point and this was in January at night    The food was also just as scrumptious as I remembered  and their attention to detail was evident with my partner s food allergies and their handwritten birthday card  The Tuna Aguachile was so flavorful  I couldn t waste a drop I actually picked up the bowl to slurp up every drop. Only minor thing I would have changed was getting something other than the grilled broccoli. I know  my fault  for selecting that over their other wonderfully amazing dishes but I was trying to get something green. It wasn t bad. It just wasn t spectacular like their other dishes so felt I missed out on something else.   So...go to Comedor for extraordinary food  great ambiance  and first class service. Thank you Sarah for making it a great experience   p.s. I was a little bummed to see the previous Executive Chef who was Latino but shall not be named for reasons you either know or don t know was replaced with a non-POC Executive Chef  especially for a Mexican restaurant BUT Chef Speer is not only putting out some great food but also apparently  doing some great work in the service industry community. That discovery will forever hold a special place in my heart.
Comedor,43,Everything was delicious from cocktails to the enchiladas and shrimp taco was excellent the ambience and place is pretty cool but for sure make a reservation
Comedor,44,Very cool spot  a great vibe  awesome service  the food looked beautiful and the music and decor were on point. So everything was great except I was not as big of a fan of the food itself.   First off  I was not sure if I was at the right place. It is well hidden and looks like a warehouse with a sign that is very easy to miss. It feels like you are entering a dungeon but then it opens up beautifully. It s a stunning space and a great date spot or place to impress.   The quesadilla that I ordered was good.  Beautiful presentation and plating. The sauce was a little spicy and they were nice enough to bring me another sauce and some guac to cool it off. For the main course  they mentioned they are known for their bone marrow tacos. It looked amazing and I do like bone marrow and was excited to try it. However  it was WAY too rich and oily. It could have used some more acid and even the kale beneath it was soaked in butter. It was just too much and I am still regretting eating all of it a few hours later.  For dessert  I was told the specialty was the chocolate tamale from their award-winning party chef. Again  it looked stunning but the flavor and texture were just off for me.   Everyone I interacted with was great  I wish them the very best.
Comedor,45,This place is easy to walk by without noticing. Dark on the outside and a bit hidden with the garage entrance next to it.   Once you get in  Fantastic flavors and ambiance. Classy place with higher end prices. The corn tortillas were beyond fresh. I enjoyed the fish dish as it was flavorful and hearty.
Comedor,46,From the outside  this place looks like a hidden nightclub. You come in  and you re transformed to a chic  sexy  and dimly lit restaurant. The service is fast and our server  Cal or Kal  unsure on spelling   was kind and helped with recommendations. That said  the drinks were creative and superb  but the food was not fantastic. Wanted to love this place  but between the 4 of us we split 6 dishes and 5 6 were not awesome. The tostadas had good flavor  but tortillas were so too hard I thought I d break a tooth. Additionally  the pork cheek dish was 90  rice  and lacked depth.  However  the NY strip was sublime  I believe our server said she was unable to think of anything else while consuming and the whole table agreed  an absolute must if you re dining   If we come back to Austin  I d try this again  but would hope the flavors and menu evolve to meet the scale of atmosphere and price point.
Comedor,47,Best customer service experience I ve had in Austin. Food quality was above and beyond and the cocktails were on point.
Comedor,48,Yum  The tacos are excellent but the ginger cocktail was my favorite. The staff is great and very attentive. Comedor has a nice ambience and I love how it is tucked away in the heart of downtown. When you walk in  it instantly opens up to a beautiful room with natural light coming through. Certainly a unique set up that is perfect for date night or a fun night with friends. I wish they wouldn t charge you if you miss your reservation though - it definitely makes me think twice about scheduling with friends that may have to cancel a few hours before our dinner date because of their work schedule.  Overall  lovely staff  delicious food and wonderful ambience. Highly recommend 
Comedor,49,Authentic  refined  modern Mexican cuisine like what you would find in Mexico City s Polanco District. A la  Javier Placentia  or  Enrique Olivera  - Those names alone will give you an idea of what kind of dishes are coming out of the kitchen at Comedor. I do not award many  5  star reviews  but this is one of them - very worthy    I ll start with the ambience which is neo-modernistic and chic. Wood meets black iron floor to ceiling windows and brick that opens to the sky in some parts along with full size trees and other natural elements. Very comfortable seating and an atmosphere that transcends a conventional dining experience. The Servers appear to have just a few tables they are tending to  so our service was very attentive and personable. The cocktail mixology was cutting-edge and were all handmade. I recommend the Oaxaca Margarita  which was perfectly balanced with Reposado  Mescal  lime  lemon and Cointreau - one of the best margaritas I ve ever had and that s saying a lot since I m from San Diego  CA.   I can honestly say I did not recognize 90  of what was on the menu - which was so wonderful  We trusted our server to guide us through it and  as a party of seven  we decided to try 7 different items and share  tapas style  - that was the perfect call  Things like bone marrow tacos  blue fin aguachile  live scallop crudo  mole  Spanish style octopus  Pulpo en su Tinta   goat barbacoa and an array of Mexican vegetables and tostada s thoughtfully spiced  habanero ash emersion for example . The flavor combinations were out-of-this world  and everything was prepared perfectly and plated so beautifully.   The dessert menu did not disappoint either- they are too hard to explain but artfully presented containing a glorious blend of nuts  caramels  gelato  chocolate and crisp. The texture and flavors were very memorable. What a great experience this was  and the price was very reasonable  under  90 person including 3-4 cocktails each   tip . Perhaps it was because we ordered Tapas style - but we were all very full and satisfied.
Comedor,50,My first time here was for their brunch and everything was so good  My favorites were by far the fish tacos and the pastry plate  which had a nice variety of different pastries to try. The McConcha was good  but not my favorite out of what we ordered. We also tried the pancake  which was very fluffy and tasty as well. Definitely going to come back to try their dinner menu 
Comedor,51,This place is a little hidden which makes it even more enticing to try. I was able to experience this place at a party where our host rented the entire restaurant. We had the bone marrow tacos  fish tacos  roasted chicken and a few other items. These three were my favorite and absolutely mouth watering. Our table was so excited when they gave us a second round of fish tacos.   The cocktails were also amazing. They had some cocktail with espresso that was pure heaven. I d love to know the band of it.   After reading some reviews I wanted to come back and add more. 1  this place is a vibe and yes it is on the darker side which I like. 2  the plates are not large and that s on purpose. The point is for you to order multiple dishes and have a little bit of each. 3  there is some spice  to some of their foods  just go lighter on the sauces. 4  this is not Tex-mex so do not expect that either.   I highly recommend going to eat here and ordering multiple items to share.
Comedor,52,Finally got a chance to try this place and it did not disappoint  It s a gorgeous set up and the food is amazing   We got the Tuna aguachile which was so light and refreshing with a delicious spice kick. The quesadilla is definitely a must have too but the bone marrow was hands-down the showstopper. I will be getting this every single time now. Super rich and just perfect 
Comedor,53,Comedor was my favorite restaurant in Austin going into my most recent dining experience there  unfortunately I don t think I can say this anymore. As far as the vibes go  I feel like they are always right at Comedor. The atmosphere is always so unique and it makes you feel like you are upon something very special. Unfortunately this time around  the food wasn t quite as good as I remembered and the service was lacking.   To start  no real smile or hospitality from the hostess when we came in and we were left with that awkward feeling of  alright where do we go next  .  Our server forgot a drink we ordered and wasn t as attentive as other servers we ve had in the past which had made the Comedor experience truly special. Also being Mother s Day - I was expecting an experience or service that was a little more special  our server barely remembered to say anything about Mother s Day .  The mezcal I tried the last time I was at Comedor came with a complimentary side of oranges and sal de gusano  this time around  our server did not offer this and there was an extra charge for it once I requested it on the side.  The tacos Al vapor used to be my favorite dish but I was grasping to try and remember what I liked about them this time around  felt like these were lacking a little salt and were extremely acidic in the most random bites . The bone marrow tacos were just OK in our opinion and weren t as mind-blowing as I was expecting  they were much sweeter than we were anticipating . On the flip side  every dish was beautiful constructed  visually .  For the price that we paid by the end  I was definitely feeling that we could ve had at least x2 the experience and food at somewhere like Suerte.  Overall  a very  meh  feeling experience when I was expecting to remember why I really loved Comedor. Will probably still come back but it won t be as soon as I had initially thought.
Comedor,54,holy moly    I came here for my birthday dinner and was so impressed by the service and food. We made reservations and when we arrived they handed me a comedor birthday card that the staff signed. When i booked the reservation i booked a high top not knowing what that meant. High tops are longer tables in the middle of the restaurant and can seat multiple parties . We were seating with two other couples with one chair  in between each couple. Our server Michael was awesome and super knowledgeable. My husband loves mezcal and we didn t know where to start on their expansive list and he helped us choose some. He  knew all about the origins of all of them and how we might like them.  I hate mezcal but  Michael suggested one and I ended up really liking it. I also got the repo ginger drink which was awesome.  Michael explained that the menu was in order from  lightest dish to heaviest dish and we went from there. We ordered the smoked tuna  octopus  shrimp tostada  the hominy salad  the quesadilla and the tacos de pescado    The tostada was the perfect bite    It was so good and flavorful--they also give you a napkin to cut it on if you share it    Hominy salad has a beet pur e and my fav part are the corn nuts it adds the perfect crunch  There is also a dill oil they make which is soooo good and compliments everything so well.   The quesadilla was easily the star of the show   I m not the biggest mushroom fan but this was otherworldly. The cheese stretch  the mushrooms are marinated and seasoned to perfection and it comes with this AMAZING home made salsa. It s super rich--so keep that in mind.  Lastly were the fish tacos. So good  Four of them come to an order. They are small and perfect to end a meal with. The fish is crispy  and there is charred purple cabbage that adds a smoky sweet flavor  of course accompanied with another great salsa.    We thought we were too full for dessert but they had an affogato with Mexican vanilla ice cream and corn cookies that we had to try. The ice cream is so flavorful  cinnamon  vanilla and nice flaky salt.    As for vibes I was wearing a jumpsuit and heels which was fine there were people dressed more casual but you can honestly wear whatever you feel like in this environment and be comfortable.   The food was awesome but we had one of the best service experiences ever. The way the food was presented  the attentiveness to detail was spectacular.   We got four dishes and dessert between the two of us we were stuffed     Roosevelt room is across the street  and garage is next door  great options for after dinner drinks 
Comedor,55,Absolutely fantastic food and drinks with impeccable service in an upscale atmosphere. A foodie s dream  Perfect for a special occasion  Expensive but so very memorable  Come here if you have an adventurous palate  Sorry for all the exclamation points but seriously  this place is top notch.
Comedor,56,One of the best and most unique meals I have had in a long time. I was able to find a spot at the bar and was immediately greeted by several bartenders. They were super helpful throughout the meal and gave outstanding recommendations. Started with several drinks  including a margarita which was outstanding. As for the meal  I started with the smoked tuna  octopus  and shrimp tostada  which I could have eaten ten of them it was so good. The spice and amount of seafood on the tostada was outstanding. It was then recommended to try the tuna aquachili  which didn t sound appealing to me but was one of the best dishes I have had. Although spicy  the flavor of the broth  along with the tuna and kelp  was perfection. Lastly  I ended with the Mexican Affogato  a perfect coffee dessert for the end of an outstanding meal. If I was to living local  this out be my go to spot for an upscale Mexican meal. A must stop location.
Comedor,57,I went to Comedor for a special private dinner but the food overall was fantastic. I loved the bone marrow and the chef really used a lot of acid in his dishes  which I enjoyed. Would definitely go back for a mid range meal.
Comedor,58,By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the state of Texas  It exceeded my expectations - the food  the ambiance  and service was fantastic. I will definitely be returning  and will recommend this restaurant to everyone.
Comedor,59,Really dark  food wasn t good  service wasn t good. I couldn t see what I was eating and server was not friendly
Comedor,60,Came here for some margaritas and food with a friend.  We were able to sit at the bar bc we went on the earlier side but you now even need an reservation for the bar area  So keep that in mind.  Tip  It s located right by garage bar  the door is large black and unmarked - can be a bit hard to find.  They do have valet available right in that garage next to it.  The service and drinks were great  I had the comedor margarita.  For food we shared the quesadilla with veggies and mushrooms as well as the tacos al vapor. Highly recommend both    Also had dessert- I can t remember what it s called but HIGHLY recommend- see photo below.  In the center was warm chocolate 
Comedor,61,OMG  Gastronomic perfection   The food was amazing   The bone marrow tacos are a must   So is the half chicken. When a place like this has chicken on the menu  you k ow they re doing it right  Service was on point and drinks were impressive. Took a few weeks to get a table for a Friday night  but really was worth it   Can t say enough great things 
Comedor,62,Went here with a friend last night  it was amazing    Everything was well executed  super flavorful  but in a very thoughtful and balanced way. The sauces were delicious.... I m not a fan of octopus  but the seafood taco was really good  and I ate every bite of my 1 2 of the taco  octopus and all   While everything we had was delicious  the two standouts were the ribeye  melted in your mouth  with flavors that made you want to keep eating  even when you re full    and the chocolates masa with ice cream  which was the only dish we actually finished  devoured....      Oh  bone marrow tacos were also quite tasty    Definitely an outstanding meal...   
Comedor,63,Comedor is the spot  The space is aesthetically stunning and it s my go-to restaurant to bring out of town visitors. The dining room and patio are both great options and can be booked via Resy.   I credit Comedor for my newfound taste for bone marrow. Those tacos are so decadent and seem to get better every time. A fun experience that is available but less publicized during covid is to use the emptied bones as a luge to do a mezcal shot.  One note for those with lower spice tolerance  the jalape os here are HOT. I don t know where they source those but they are no joke 
Comedor,64,Really interesting and authentic food. As a vegetarian  they had plenty of options and I liked most of them   We had the avocado Tostada to start and it was awesome  then we had the quesadilla and it tasted great with the corn tortilla and the unique cheese they put in it. We had the tacos which were super soft and tasted okay just really spicy. Lastly  we had the desert with caramelized milk ice cream and I LOVED the ice cream  just wish I could have gotten more of it.
Comedor,65,Definitely recommend this restaurant.   The food  drinks and ambiance are all superb.   We ordered the agave guava and the michelada and both were delicious.   We ordered the mushroom quesadilla as an appetizer and wow... amazing 
Comedor,66,I thought the food here was generally good but nothing was outstanding except for the bone marrow tacos.   Food  Avocado tostada - good Seafood tostada - very good Mushroom tostada - delicious  Bone marrow tacos - delicious and must order  Fish tacos - good Pavlova - ok Chocolate dessert - ok
Comedor,67,First time in Austin and asked around for a cool  nice  bougie spot and a bunch of people recommended Comedor. WTF was I thinking not utilizing this glorious platform and trusting real life humans   OK I get the cool dark  trendy  Mexican vampire vibe but that doesn t mean everyone working there has to act like a blood thirsty model at Paris fashion week who can t be bothered with customer service. My wife and I were told that we could leave by the manager after we relayed our honest opinions of our experience despite the fact that she had come over to our table on her own accord.   I got ahead of myself... so the experience.... We weren t ravenous because we had indulged in a few tacos at our hotel pool  the Fairmont  and wow those were spectacular. Oh sorry  Comedor review  battling my subconscious that tried to erase this terrible trendy Austin experience from my memory. We ordered the Tuna Aguachile and Tacos. Oh and when in Rome  some mescal.   First  the alcoholic part. I ADORE mescal solely due to the fact that it s a smokey cousin of tequila. I asked the waiter for a suggestion  mentioning that  and was pointed towards two options. Side note  my wife pulled out her compact make up mirror and tried to see the waiter but couldn t... too dark a restaurant or VAMPIRE    Presentation was traditional with orange and worm salt however the mescal  while smokey  reminded me of some Appalachia moonshine with a heavy dry bite. Call me what you wish but I ve had bottles  remember  alcoholic   of mescal far superior that cost the same price as the glass.   And now to the Tuna Aguachile. We were excited because the waiter mentioned  sushi grade tuna  but never expected the unpleasant heat that it would be doused in. The fish was placed in a melon and chile sauce that was unbearable. My wife and I live off of spicy food but I think someone in the kitchen went a little overboard  at least on our dish  making every bite quite distracting from the beautiful cut of fish. It got to the point where we were literally scraping the fish along the edge of the dish in order to free the tuna from the nasty fire melon sauce. Sad. Two positives on the tacos  the tortilla and the aesthetic. Flavor didn t do much and after finally cooling down from the tuna dish we were excited to wash that disappointment down the pipes but alas  no.    So whatever  food and drink was a flop we were ready to pay our bill  tip our waiter  and find somewhere else to drink the misery away BUT THEN the manager came over. We are an honest pair of people so we told her our thoughts then asked her where she was from  Florida  and my wife told her that her friends from Miami were joining us the following day and then concluded with  but that s not really Florida . There was a slight reaction in Mrs. Comedor s eyes  noticeable even in the darkness and with the face mask  so we shifted to inquiring on any other suggestions for food in Austin. My wife said that she wanted the Texas food experience  I corrected her and stated that we were looking for the bbq experience because the rest of the food in Texas was so so... We were then told that we could leave and she stormed off.   Get a grip  we all have a opinions and you re welcome to receive or dismiss them but being in management  especially in hospitality  you ve got to keep it together. As stated above  the tacos at the Fairmont pool were superior to this place at half the cost AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE. Go at your own risk  I don t know how we made it out alive with all those thirsty vampires working there.
Comedor,68,Very interesting and tasty combinations.  We have visited for dinner and brunch and have not been disappointed.  Take a tasting menu approach and try several dishes.  Along with the photos pictured  we also had chiles en nogada  and the Bone marrow tacos.  It can be spicy  but not overwhelming. The cocktails complement the menu very well.  Deserts are yummy.  Service is phenomenal.  We will be back 
Comedor,69,I was a lil disappointed with this place. Maybe because I had high expectations but it was not as I expected.  The place look really cool and has a nice vibe.  The drinks were ok but I was expecting amazing margaritas and it was just ok. Nothing special about it.  The service was really good and Pablo was very attentive. He identified everything vegetarian on the menu for me  what was not a lot but enough options.  Unfortunately our reservation was quite late so they were out of the salad I want to try so I went with the other salad  which I regretted completely. It was basically a lot of greens  some bitter ones that I dont usually see in restaurant salads and the dressing was on the bottom of the plate instead of the top of the salad  so it was really hard to mix and feel the dressing flavor. The mushrooms tostadas was pretty good but the tostada was a lil too hard. The mushroom tacos was very good and very spicy too. The food overall was good but it took for ever to get to our table. Pablo said it was because it was a busy time  which I disagree a lil since it was after  10pm and the restaurant was starting to slow down actually. Anyway nobody likes to wait too long for they dinner.
Comedor,70,The quesadilla changed my life. Every single thing I ate was delicious and gluten free. The service was excellent as well.
Comedor,71,When i think of my favorite restaurants ive ever been to  this pops up in mind. The seafood tostada and bone marrow tacos are out of the world. 6 5
Comedor,72,Yessss yess yess  Comedor marked all of the boxes.   1. The ambience  darkly light  dull but regal. Bold and chic. No loud music  just the chatter of other patrons. Candles on every table of course. Slight lounge vibes   2. Dinner menu   I wasn t expecting for every plate to hit the nail on the hammer but every bite of every dish had me say  woooow . Everything was delicious and this includes the cocktails.   I ve been hopping around trying different dining experiences around town and typically each establishment seems to lack something somewhere but for me Comedor had it all.   Would love to try their brunch menu 
Comedor,73,Excellent atmosphere and delicious food. I really wish the bone marrow tacos were offered at brunch.
Comedor,74,Stopped in for dinner with my boss. Long story short  fantastic meal. We took the waiters suggestion and ordered the tuna aguachile  huitlacoche quesadilla  smoked cabbage  and bone marrow. All of them were delicious but the cabbage and bone marrow were life changing. Great cocktails and service to boot. Can t wait to bring more folks to check it out.
Comedor,75,Lord forgive me  I paid  37 for a taco plate and I loved it.  In an unassuming building on Colorado St  you ll find not only a stunning interior  but some of the best high end Mexican cuisine in Austin. The wife and made our anniversary reservations at Comedor. She knew where she was going  but I would have walked right by the front door. Ostentatious  this place ain t.  Once inside  the entire restaurant opens up  literally  with huge ceilings and a small open air patio. Despite the small footprint  everything is smartly laid out  and they manage to pack a ton of liquor into the modest sized bar.   Service was excellent  the staff gave us not one  but two hand signed  happy anniversary  cards  We arrived just as happy hour began and we didn t deviate from the discounted menu much...the food was just too good   Tacos  We had the cochinita pibil  lengua and carnitas  with the cochinita being our favorite.  Tostadas  We ordered all three of the tostadas. The veggie tostada is amazing. EVEN IF YOU RE A DEVOTED CARNIVORE  ORDER THE VEGGIE TOSTADA    It s the best thing on the menu  by far. We ordered it three times. The smoked tuna octopus was great as well  though the flavors are very potent.  We did venture into the proper menu to order the bone marrow tacos. Be warned  Anything in the  for the table  category is going to have large portions  they aren t messing around. My wife is a bone marrow freak and they served us enough for 4  people. There was so much food  and it was after we had gorged ourselves on the happy hour menu  that we tried giving it away to other tables.  Drinks  The drinks were really well executed. Nearly everything on the menu utilizes either sotol or mezcal  and credit to the bar for taming the smoky flavors they re known for. I thought the Charanda pineapple was the weak link  you can stick to the two HH drinks and be just fine.  Dessert  The tamal de chocolate is an incredibly ugly  but incredibly delicious dish. It s essentially chocolate masa with ice cream. Beautifully balanced and a great way to finish our meal.  As we move out of the pandemic and more restaurants open up  make Comedor a priority.
Comedor,76,Really enjoyed coming here to celebrate my boyfriend s birthday  They were really accommodating when we asked to be seated in a more private spot as the high top is at a communal table  with distancing  but the patio was nicer. However  they only do HH at the high top and bar which we didn t know  so that was a bit of a bummer. Loved the avocado tostada  yum charred corn on top  especially and the fried fish tacos  The Sandia Bonita cocktail my bf ordered was so good I had to get one too. They also wrote a birthday card for him which was sweet    Although no free cake or dessert... I know we shouldn t expect it but the card made me think maybe there would be something lol . But the staff was so nice and helpful with suggestions  would absolutely recommend 
Comedor,77,The bone marrow tacos were to die for. Espresso this martini. Realizing I need to commit fraud  sitting here sippling a sotol mattini. I need to commit fraud I explain   It s a splendid time at the divine corridor known as commedor   commendatore  Don t forget to check out the gate to martii narnia in the 7th bathroom door. Roar.  You definitely wanna climb over the garage and jump down into the courtyard. Skip the fuss.   Make a name for yourself  don t talk about it. Realize something here  We are made for more we are made of marrow.
Comedor,78,Incredible food. Delicious drinks. Not the greatest service  but the food made up for it. Waited 30  minutes for drinks and then had to remind waiter we even ordered. He forgot to put them in. No problem. But then the drink never came and our waiter disappeared. Like legit disappeared. He left the restaurant bc it was the end of his shift. No one told us or asked if we needed anything. Had to flag someone down to let them know we didn t get 2 of our entrees and multiple drinks. Bizarre experience overall but the food makes it worth it. You can t miss the bone marrow tacos.
Comedor,79,Came with a group of 8 for a business dinner.  It was very dark and had to use lights from cell phone to read menu and divide portions once served so we could pass around table.  This is not a traditional Mexican restaurant. We were there about 3 hours which was too long even with an empty restaurant. Had to ask the staff to speed up our dining experience.  Food tasted  ok  but would not return.
Comedor,80,For someone heading to the restaurant for the first time  the menu can be very intimidating  at least it was for me . But upon arrival  we were put at ease with best of class  and also personalized  service. The staff asked us questions  provided us information and did not hesitate to go over each of the menu items with us. I was beyond impressed.   The atmosphere was fun inviting and the food different than I expected  in a good way . I most enjoyed their ability to make fresh garnishes and well developed sauces shine on every dish   I would strongly recommend  And don t be afraid to have an honest conversation with whomever is taking care of you about what to order based on your preferences and how much to order. The sizes of the dishes vary as you go down the menu.   Their signature fish is the none marrow tacos  but I loved the fruitful carrots and the whole grouper.
Comedor,81,I visited Comedor a few weeks back and was excited to finally try them out. My only complaint is my stomach isn t big enough to try everything  I reserved a high top to enjoy happy hour mid-week  which I definitely recommend. The taco options on the HH menu blew me away - specifically the Texas Mushrooms  amp  Huitlacoche. That taco packed a punch of flavor  so don t shy away from the veggie options. I ordered each taco on the menu to split with my husband - if you are ordering multiple dishes to share  a single taco is enough for two people.  By far  THE most amazing dish of the night was Smoked Tuna  Octopus and Shrimp Tostada - topped with a cilantro emulsion and salsa macha. Now  everything was good  but the tostada was insanely good. I almost reordered  but was too full     Of course  I had to try to famous bone marrow tacos and they did not disappoint. The mix of of buttery bone marrow and pecan germolata is a unique and delicious bite.  I could go on and on - the drinks were also top notch  along with the dessert. Overall  we ordered a variety of dishes and not a single one was a miss. Can t wait to come back and try more 
Comedor,82,This is a review of their brunch offering. We got the pancake  pambazzo  and mushroom quesadilla. And I would rank them in that order as well. This isn t a knock on the quesadilla but rather the other two were just phenomenal.   I highly highly recommend getting the pancake. It s likely the best pancake I ve ever had. Period. The brown butter and sea salt drizzle is good but the real star is the pancake itself. It has the perfect light crispy exterior while maintaining a warm fluffy interior. It s outstanding. A must get for brunch.
Comedor,83,Came here with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. It was raining so we had to sit in the covered area outside. The food was good  but i cant say it was anything exceptional. HTe bone marrow tacos were pretty cool but i found them a bit greasy and the pecans on top were really sweet- something about all the flavor profiles didnt sit right for me. We had the octupus and shrimp toastada as well which was pretty good 
Comedor,84,Exceptional cocktails  the food was excellent and unexpected in the combinations and ingredients. An excellent place for a date  not so much a business meeting. Would be great to take a group of friends too.   This isn t a typical Mexican food place. Not by any stretch.
Comedor,85,Stay away  Only 5 months ago I had returned for a second visit and was delighted by the unique  vibrant flavors that had shocked me the first time I d visited--Comedor shot up to my  1 restaurant  and I was thrilled with what I d found in the Austin downtown. Fast forward to now  I was happy to endure a 3 week waiting list for my reservation. I needed something to lift my spirits after a tough summer  and my heart was broken.  Clearly there s someone new in the kitchen. Gone were the bright  unique flavors. Everything was muddled and heavy. After several lackluster dishes  my  45 chicken was a decimated  desiccated piece of leather. And I know everyone has been having a hard time getting front-of-the-house employees  but service was polite but nonexistent.   400 for two people  and I would have been much happier at El Mercado for  40. The food is awful. Only go if you want the privilege of spending a lot of money because it makes you feel elite. Any proper foodie should stay far  far away.
Comedor,86,What a great place  During my road trip  after stuffing myself a few hours before with Texas BBQ  I also really wanted to try Comedor.  I initially had reservations on a Saturday night for around dinner time  but moved it to close to closing time  The person on the phone was very accommodating and nice even though it was Saturday night .  Finding the place was super cool and the inside was this hidden gem of a place.  The decor and ambiance was amazing. The had an indoor area and outdoor area  I think that there was a retractable ceiling .  I got seated inside  there were still quite a number of people close to closing  and got to people watch from where I sat.   Our waitress came over pretty quickly and gave suggestions.  I know that they have a big selections of mezcal.  I am not a huge fan of mezcal  so I skipped.  I ordered a few items off the menu  it s tapa style to share .  The food was amazing.  The highlights were the bone marrow tacos  this is a must get  and the octopus  which was tender and had a crunch from the quinoa it was coated with .  I also tried to broccoli tamale  which I thought was OK  but not my favorite.  The food are in smaller portions  so I would suggest getting a few things to share.  The food was came out pretty quickly  but even spaced.    All in all  I am glad I came here.  The ambiance is great and the food makes it even better.  I will definitely come back here when I am in Austin.
Comedor,87,This is in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Austin. The restaurant design is beautiful. The food is such an incredible take on oaxacan food. Anytime someone is in town I bring them here.   So my review is not about the food or anything. It s about the bad taste the management staff left after I brought 11 people to dine here for my birthday. I was torn between here and a private room at Hestia for my birthday dinner. I chose Comedor because I thought the shared plates and food would be a better flow vibe.   This is after the governor removed all restrictions   Comedor chose to keep their rules for covid. So maximum of 10 people per table  so two of my guests were in a booth next to us which was weird but fine we accepted it.   The problem was when we were getting ready to leave after spending  1500 there  everyone had their masks on ready to leave when a woman came over and said if we re standing to wear a mask and at the same time we realized someone was in the restroom and we stopped to wait. So my brother sat back down in our booth and she comes over to him and says no you can leave.   The policy is if you are seated you don t need a mask. He SAT down the second she said if you are standing to wear a mask. So for her to come and attempt to kick him out was extremely disrespectful  especially when there are no other safety measures put in place. If you care about protecting people from covid- you would not have a restaurant at 100  capacity  a kitchen packed with workers not six feet apart. The three people at the host stand are not even a foot apart.   The virtue signaling this restaurant puts on as a facade for people as a covid friendly place is disgusting. I don t respect hypocrisy and the management team there chooses it  so I am choosing to not spend my money here for the time being. It was such a SOUR way to end what was a lovely dinner.
Comedor,88,Very delicious food. Highly recommend if you like creative take on Mexican food.  Ambiance is great but a bit dark inside. Harder to see others and the food on the table.
Comedor,89,This review is coming in a week later after my dining experience. It s impact is still heavy and truly made my trip to Austin one to remember.   If you re into fine dining  and need a break from the classic bbq and Tex mex options  look no further than to Comedor.  My friend brought me here knowing I was a huge foodie. He explained that this was one of the best restaurants in Austin.  Sooo start with service review  impeccable from start to finish. I love coming in and having them explain the dishes  inspiration  dish recs  preparation details  what pairs with what  etc.   Our server was ON it with giving accurate information and attending to us from start to finish...  Now  on to the food     - Smoke tuna  octopus  shrimp tostada  cilantro emulsion  salsa macha  5 5 This dish  this was unreal and gave me an explosion of flavors that you just can t replicate. From the perfect textures and flavor of the dish with the salsa and emulsion that was so flavorful it was the star of dinner.  -My second favorite was the SPICY SPICY SPICY Tuna aguachile  watermelon  Chile costeno  kelp chicharron 5 5 Warning  this had a spice level that would bring even those who can handle heat to tears. That being said  I gobbled down every delish hot bite with these playful flavors of watermelon and kelp lingering in the broth  it made for a killer entree.  - A table favorite of both my friend and I was the Bone marrow tacos... 5 5 Rich flavor  dense full feeling after a few bites for me but overall a star of the night as well  - We also got the Hominy salad consisting of maiz cacahauzintle  root vegetables  hoja santa  5 5 This dish was extremely filling and had crazy textures  there was so much complexity in this salad I could not get over it..  We also had the margs which were delicious  and some fish tacos that were good but honestly the first four dishes blew the tacos out of the water.  Location is downtown Austin  inside vibe was industrial classy.  I truly cannot explain how much dining here made my trip  Thank you again  and I will return bringing friends from my city next time 
Comedor,90,We had drinks and appetizers on Comedor s patio--what a fun experience   The restaurant made me feel like I was in Mexico City at Pujol--the restaurant vibe is very modern  and the food is creative and fun.  I ordered a Comedor margarita  and it was great--even the salt had a special savory flavor.  For appetizers  though I guess they could be entrees too    we ordered the fish tacos and the avocado tostadas  and both were excellent.
Comedor,91,Absolutely delicious.  Everything is shareable. And it is meant to be eaten that way.   Started with the tuna aguachile. Wow. Stunning. Amazing piece of tuna with a spicy citrus sauce.   Next  cochinta pibil tacos. The best tacos that I have ever had. Ever. 5 large tacos served in a basket. The most flavorful meat and homemade tortillas  topped with roasted cauliflower. Delicious.
Comedor,92,Comedor is seriously and easily one of my top picks in Austin. It s nestled right in the middle of downtown  in an unassuming dark building. If you re not looking for it  it s easy to miss. But  once you step inside  there s a beautiful interior  complete with huge windows and plenty of natural lighting. There s a minimalistic  concrete jungle-y feel to it that s super breathtaking. From the moment you walk in  you re guaranteed to have a really good time.  The servers are super knowledgeable and helpful here. They explain everything on their menu  and give the  best  suggestions. We tried 4 5 of our server s suggestions and they were truly all great. The food is unique  but still cultural  and it doesn t give off any fusion-y bastardization vibes. The food also tastes really incredibly good. If anything  the bone marrow tacos are a  must try   The best part is that you really get a bang for your buck here. The items are a little on the pricier side  but the portions are big enough that you ll leave feeling satisfied. Plus  the flavors and ingredients they use aren t ones you can easily find around the city. Their drinks were just as good too.  Over all  I have too much praise for this place. I m begging you to please try the bone marrow tacos. Can t wait to go back 
Comedor,93,Comedor is a vibe. Such a pretty space  amazing food. Incredible interior Mexican. They change out the menu frequently so I know every time I go I can try something new. I love going here for a night out and always a good time  great atmosphere and delicious mean. The staff is friendly too. Definitely on the pricey side but worth it for a night out  Incredible drinks and mezcal bar 
Comedor,94,I could write a novel about Comedor. A love letter  at the very least. The service and quality of food is some of the best in Austin. The restaurant itself is so beautiful and perfect on a day with great weather.   We ve been here a few times and I have two items I will continue to order every time  the bone marrow tacos and the chocolate tamal. They re thoughtfully prepared and I m already dreaming about the next time I can eat them. Some of the items are unique  but don t let that spook you.  There s a reason this gem is booked back to back every weekend - it s one of the best higher end spots in Austin. I can t recommend it enough.
Comedor,95,Wow that was great. Definitely more about the food than posing  though you absolutely could since the setting is modernist and beautiful. Somehow they knew my name and employed it during the meal which was a nice touch.
Comedor,96,Delicious creative food and a great atmosphere. I highly recommend the tostada and the salads.
Comedor,97,This place is AMAZING and they are so kind to vegans    Our server marked all vegan options and told us ways we could make menu options vegan  which was so helpful and above and beyond. There were so many options  The drinks and food also exceeded my expectations. This will be a place I take out of town guests for sure and can t wait to come back 
Comedor,98,My husband and I loved Comedor. Perfect date night spot with good food and drinks and they offer an early happy hour. We tried a couple of drinks each  some appetizers  the bone marrow tacos  which definitely live up to the hype   and dessert with an espresso martini  so good . Everything we had was delicious  amp  the serving sizes were good. It s a little pricey   even with happy hour pricing  but the service was good and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly 
Comedor,99,We got almost everything on the menu and food was really good  but you can read about how great the food is in other reviews and on food blogs. The service was cold and unwelcome. We went to celebrate a birthday and they wouldn t let us bring a cake from a bakery. This policy is fine  but instead of problem solving by offering their own dessert menu or responding in a human way  the hostesses clambered over each other to prove their fealty to Comedor  repeating over and over and over again  sorry we don t allow outside food or drink   as if I m trying to bring my own plate of dinner into the restaurant.   The manager was very kind and let us add 1 more person to our table and stored the cake in their fridge. But these small asks felt like huge favors  as if we were a burden. The general air of superiority in Comedor is the antithesis of hospitality.
Comedor,100,Service and food were amazing  We went to celebrate and this was the perfect spot. Highly recommend the bone marrow tacos 
Comedor,101,Wow  what a quick turnaround. We started by meeting up with old friends and were looking for a place just to catch up. We chose the Comedor due to its location and a great name. We walked in and were instantly amazed at what was before us.  We were promptly seated at the bar where we met with one of the best frontmen I ve ever met  Seth. Seth started by making us feel welcome  like old friends  and excited by us being there. We reviewed the menu and were instantly brought on a journey through Oaxaca by Seth.  The menu was explained  described  and immortalized by the passion  knowledge  and presentation by Seth. We selected five items and were impressed by each. We experienced warmth  spice  textured  depth  savory  and sweetness throughout the meal. Each dish had an exclamation point added by Seth and his knowledge and presentation.   We had no expectations for the Comedor when we entered. By the time we left  it was a place of fond memories  delicious food  and energetic staff  and a fantastic encounter with Seth. I cannot recommend the Comedor more than five stars  but it deserves so much more. I cannot wait to come back 
Comedor,102,The ambience  food  drinks and the service were all really great. I am so glad that I went to this place. Their mescals and drinks are amazing and nowhere else to be found. The only disappointing dish was the dessert and the rest were really good 
Comedor,103,I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and it was amazing  I made reservations online and the only table available was at 5 30 on the patio. Obviously this place is popular bc it s hard to get a resy  I normally wouldn t sit outside at 5 30 in July in Texas  but we made an exception and I m glad we did. It ended up raining a little and they moved us very quickly to a covered table so it was a fun little adventure.  Our server  Michael  was incredible. He was super knowledgeable and gave amazing recommendations. We had the carrots  quesadilla  fish tacos  and bone marrow tacos. Everything was incredible. We hadn t planned to have so many tacos quesadillas but that s what Michael recommended and he was spot on  We had a few great cocktails as well.   For dessert  we had the atole and I had an espresso martini. Honestly  the espresso martini is one of the best drinks I ve ever had. We also brought a bone marrow bone back for the dog and she is still working on it to this day. Definitely would recommend this place for a sweet happy hour or celebratory meal. Thanks again Michael 
Comedor,104,I ve been curious about this restaurant for some time and finally got a reservation. First  it s a very cool space  has an industrial vibe. When I describe the food  it s like a bang of flavor in the mouth. Many flavors and some dishes were quite spicy. Stand out dishes for me were the Tuna Aquachile  mussels  particularly the sauce  and the star was the half chicken. The Mexican ice cream with coffee and corn cookies was a great way to end our meal  I decided at the last minute not to have the bone marrow but seeing it come out to other tables  I regret that decision. I ll definitely be back 
Comedor,105,Wow  It doesn t get better than this. We visited Comedor to celebrate our anniversary and it was the perfect place to do so. We were greeted with champagne and a handwritten card from the staff  which was so unexpected. The cocktails were delicious and our server was so great and knowledgeable. She offered some great suggestions and hers were some of our favorites. My favorite dish was far and away the fish tacos. They were insanely good  The chicken was also beyond and really blew me away.
Comedor,106,This is a beautiful facility  very elegant and modern. The patio is nice even in cool weather thanks to the heaters and Mexican blankets laid over the chairs. The service was quite good - ask for Juan  He was knowledgeable about all the dishes and could really describe them well. The cocktails are just killer. We had the ancho guajillo vodka  the sotol tepache  and the mole old fashioned. Love love love the sotol cocktail.   The chicken liver mousse was so scrumptious I ate before I got a picture  sorry not sorry . Even if you think you don t like liver you should order this. The corn spaetzle is like nothing you ve tasted before and also like every corn thing you ve eaten at the same time. Soft and crunchy and creamy and spicy all at the same time.   The salad was so beautiful I hated to mess it up. And it tasted divine. Gorgeous heirloom lettuce  herbs  pea shoots  wafers of radish and a chile dressing. The yellowfin tuna was insane with its tender sashimi and layered spicy broth.   Next we had bone marrow tacos  oh myyyyyyyyy   black squid ink octopus with grilled leeks  and a coulotte steak. The tacos were exquisite and super rich and you definitely should order them  and share . The octopus  which was tender  was also bitter and not a favorite. The leeks served with the octopus  however   were quite good  as were the sauces. The coulotte steak had excellent flavor but was tough and would benefit from a thinner slice. The housemade corn tortillas were excellent  tender and corny and held together well.   Dessert was guava sorbet and a tres leches cake to share amongst us  accompanied by a boozy espresso things to drink  can t remember the name but what do you expect after a dinner like this . Order it though  it s really good. Also order the tres leches  which is a sorta Baked Alaska. The guava sorbet was ok but not a favorite.   We shared all the dishes so everyone could try everything. I highly recommend this strategy. We also tasted each other s cocktails. You should expect to get your hands dirty here  what with tacos and other finger foods. And make a reservation  The patio is great even if it s cold.
Comedor,107,Such a refreshing dining experience when visiting Comedor. I planned a bday brunch for a friend who had recently visited for dinner. She raved about this place for weeks  so when planning her bday  I thought this would be perfect  and to no surprise it was     First  make reservations ahead of time  You can make reservations online or call in. Bradley was accommodating when I was booking  we had a large party and was able to help me out to seat us all comfortably as well as getting us in promptly to enjoy the full brunch experience.   Walking in is such a lovely  chic environment. We sat on the patio and the design of the building kept it cool and shaded. Its only February but it was 80 outside so being comfortable on the patio is an important key to bruncher happiness. ALL the staff was so friendly and attentive  I will definitely be back.   Hablemos de la comida  Must order items from the brunch menu pan dulce  amp  pancakes  I will come back just for these sweet treats. I ordered a side of pancakes on top of my main dish and they were a slice of heaven. Everything was just so mouthwateringly delicious. The staff was kind enough to go above and beyond to confirm gluten-free options for one of our friends.   For brunch  it was a little pricey but definitely worth it. TREAT YO SELF  Extra bonus  I just read that Texas Monthly named Comedor one of the best new restaurants  even more reason to visit.
Comedor,108,Tacos tacos tacos... The great thing about them is how many types there are. Today I wanted to talk about a unique variation I had during my visit at Comedor.  What I got to eat was their Bone Marrow taco dish. If you haven t had bone marrow before  it s almost like butter  but a bit more nutty and sweet. Mix that with their pecan herbal sauce that was on top and WOW  the flavor explosion in your mouth is insane. So good  You simply scoop from the bone itself and place it on your tortilla.  Now what I got for dessert is their Milcrepa dish which is made with layers of crepe  Mexican chocolate  crunchy almonds  pomegranate  and gelato. As a crepe guy  I was a huge fan.  In terms of how big the bone marrow dish was  I recommend that you split it because that s what I did with my friend  and got an extra side of tortillas  and after eating dessert - we both left satisfied. It may not seem like a lot at first glance  but the bone marrow is really rich and heavy  so you ll be okay    All in all  I am a huge fan of the place. Yes  it s upscale  but it s worth it to come at least once for a night out with friends or date night because not only is the food delicious  but the ambiance is gorgeous and low lit  at night . Romi was my waitress  so ask for her  She was so nice. I definitely wanna come back to try other dishes 
Comedor,109,Worth the hype and we enjoyed our dinner very much.  The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  The food was great and the flavoring was balance and strong. We tried a variety of dishes and enjoyed the majority of the dishes.  Oaxaca influences are apparent in the dishes and drinks we had.   We had four dishes  para la mesa   for the table  and two entrees and 1 dessert for two people.  You need to bring people to share and eat. My favorite is the octopus tostada because it had the most flavor out of all the dishes we ordered.    The entree dishes  it was great but I would love to have a side or two with it or even tortilla serve with it.  I order a la carte the tortilla to eat with the entree as they don t really come with anything but that one fish or pork...just need something extra.   Otherwise food and drinks - no complaint.  Happy Sharing  
Comedor,110,This place is DARK. Holy hell. we had an 8pm resy and it was pitch black  The server put 3 candles on the table and that was it. For a table of 11    We literally had our cellphone flashlights out to help us read the menu AND see our food.  The ceiling is so tall that whatever ceiling lights were up there  it didn t help at all  It was very frustrating.   Food  I got the bone marrow and liked it.  Friends didn t enjoy their meals.  They said it wasn t alot of food in each plate and wasn t very good for the price point. I think everyone left hungry.    Drinks  got the Oaxaca margarita and it was so so.   I really expected much more based on the other yep reviews but i think the darkness just ruined everything.  I ve been in dimly lit places but this was not comfortable.
Comedor,111,The marker for the restaurant on google maps is off so be careful to look for their sign outside the door  see some pictures already posted of the entrance  because the sign is not grand and when we walked past it at first it wasn t lit up or anything so it kind of looked like someone graffitied the wall. It s a little hard to find but once inside you know you ve food a good food trove. Dark and moody - very low lights   architectural dream vibes. One of the staff told us they re barely open 7 months but they were the busiest restaurant on the street. The building was once a parking lot as well  and now a restaurant.  We had 2 drinks  a camomile tea mezcal cocktail and michelada. Their house made michelada had a lot of the Lucas Chile spices on the rim and at the bottom of the cup. Can pack a little bit of spice but overall it wasn t the best michelada I ve had. Other cocktail wasn t too sweet and just right.   Onto the  tomal  filled with barbacoa- I really liked all the tastes associated with this simple dish. There was guacamole paste and mole paste on the top and all balanced well. The bone marrow tacos came with 6 small corn tortillas in a tortilla warmer. With four hefty bone marrows filled with delicious filling  and pralines it seemed   I would have liked maybe 8 corn tortillas so we didn t have to pack the other tacos but we ended up so full after the 5th taco  While the flavors here are amazing  it remastered a tad greasy.  Amazing service.
Comedor,112,Worst experience ever. Was on a waitlist for 45mins and were told it was some big party reshuffling and they couldn t seat us in. Such a  poor management.  No value for anyone s time. Worst experience ever 
Comedor,113,Disappointing. This was our first time for dinner having been there once before for brunch and enjoying it. The service for a Friday night was fine and atmosphere nice but the rave reviews about the food seem to be exaggerated. The octopus in the over sauced tostada was mostly rubbery with hard bits  we spit it out  and the bone marrow tacos were gorgeous but so over coated in butter that they were dripping in grease. My plate was a pool of oil after eating one extremely messy mini taco. Bone marrow really doesn t need all that extra fat added to it and the bed of saut ed kale the bones sat on was so salty and yellow in parts that it was inedible. The garlicky broccoli was tasty as were the homemade corn tortillas but I don t think we will be back. This wasn t worth the wait.
Comedor,114,My boyfriend and I came in a couple nights ago. Wow. Bone marrow tacos were out of this universe  And the mezcal selection was insane. The server taught me about pechuga. Apparently it s like mezcal except more meaty. I m addicted   
Comedor,115,The staff here are very nice and make sure you have a good experience but in the end I think I found the food a little overhyped for the prices.   Me and my girlfriend started with the avocado and tuna octopus tostada and they were both great and it was a good start to the meal. We noticed the constant theme at the beginning was smoke  and smokey flavors are present in most of the dishes we had. After the starters  they brought out the fried grouper tacos which were awesome  definitely the best dish of the night and the last dish before things started to turn.  We ordered the quesadilla and the bone marrow tacos as well. The quesadilla was actually good but it was just a cheese and mushroom enchilada  so...nothing to write home about. The bone marrow on the other hand just wasn t doing it for me. The kale felt gritty and the marrow seasoning just didn t compliment to marrow so the tacos were a miss. It was too buttery oily and rich so I didn t get the hype.  For dessert we wanted the Tamal but they ran out of ice cream so we waited a while until they finally told us they couldn t recreate the ice cream so they gave us a complimentary dessert which was the pavlova which was very nice  but the pavlova wasn t that great  so shockingly I would ve been fine just not getting any dessert which for me is crazy to say.   Overall  it started as a strong meal and ended on a weak note. Ambitious dishes with some flawed executions  so would I come back  Possibly  but I would want to change the order for sure
Comedor,116,One word  exceptional. You cannot visit Austin without making a stop at Comedor. Don t miss it 
Comedor,117,I would go here for the atmosphere alone. It s located in what was previously a parking lot  and I must say that the owners did a fantastic job with the construction. The entry is a little hard to find  and if you didn t know that it was a restaurant  you would think that it s a vacant space. Enter through the door on the side.   The interior is open to the outside seating  so don t be afraid if there is only outside seating available. There are heaters and blankets for everyone. The place is small  so I would recommend making a reservation.  The cocktail menu is extensive and prices are about what you would expect  average  15 . The food menu is small and changes frequently  I was told. My favorite item that we had were the bone marrow tacos. They are pricey   33   but worth it. I especially loved that they come to the table deconstructed  so I was able to enjoy just the marrow by itself.  We also had the fritters  quesadillas  barbacoa tamales  and the grilled octopus. With exception of the octopus  everything was good. Unfortunately  I was very disappointed with the octopus. For the price   25   you don t get much  and it was overdressed and overcooked. I would not recommend it. All in all  I liked the food  but I wasn t overly impressed with it.  I would definitely come here again to enjoy the atmosphere and have some cocktails  and perhaps share the marrow with someone who was willing to share the cost.
Comedor,118,My company took part of the cook along that the restaurant offers with a chef. We basically received the food and heated it up while following along with a chef and cutting up various  already prepared and cooked  parts of a dish. We had the vegan option which was surprisingly delicious. The vegan option included avocado tostadas  mushroom tacos  and masa lava cakes. All of which was very flavorful. Altogether a Fung activity 
Comedor,119,I had been looking forward to dining here and now that I have accomplished that  sadly  I left disappointed with the experience. We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and we were kindly accommodated and were seated 1 table over from outside so we were able to enjoy a little bit of both the indoors outdoors and as it was a tad breezy outside  we considered ourselves lucky.  Shortly after being seated  we were greeted by our server who explained the menu to us while also pointing out some of his favorites. We were told that when we placed our orders  the preference is to order everything at once and our food would be spaced out. As soon as we placed our drink orders  we ordered the following  Smoked tuna  octopus  shrimp tostada Hongos tostada Quesadilla Half chicken So  at the top of the menu  it says  Para La Mesa ...for the table. You can understand our confusion when we ordered the tostadas and were presented with 1 of each. How is 1 tostada for the table  From there  things got less impressive. We received our quesadilla before our drinks. You really can t mess up a quesadilla  so it was good as was the accompanying salsa. We finally received our drinks and as we took our first bite of our quesadilla  the 2 tostadas arrived...so much for spacing the food out. The smoked tuna was very salty and this is coming from someone who pretty much puts salt on anything savory. The hongos were good and then the chicken....we were told it was fried and then grilled  so we were expecting a pretty crispy chicken and it was not  it was also over seasoned. After reading and hearing about the crown jewel that is their tres leches cake  I was disappointed to see it was not on the menu. We chose the chocolate tamal which was pretty to look at and that s it. If I took a bite of the tamal without the ganache  it was dry and tasted like black dyed corn. I never leave dessert on my plate  but I ended up leaving half of this dessert. The staff was nice and the vibe was rocking  but the food and drinks left much to be desired.
Comedor,120,I was excited to try this place. It was very easy to find and was greatly very nicely by the staff. That escort you to your table because the place is very dark.   Food looks and sounds good  but that s as far as it goes. We ordered the Fish tacos that are made from grouper  and tacos vapor that s suppose to be cochinita pibil  pork . Presentation was nice but the fish didn t taste like much and the cochinita vapor tacos are just colored red  not much of any flavor and very greasy and falling apart. Very disappointed in a place that claims to have authentic Mexican cuisine.   The atmosphere is ok a bit dark for my liking. I think the restaurant is going for a romantic ambiance but it feels more like a dingy dungeon.   I would strongly advice folks to not waste their money on this place. Expensive food doesn t equate to good food.
Comedor,121,Everything we ate was delicious. The cocktails were amazing. The restaurant is sleek  stylish  and unique. Loved the doors opened to the patio which  oddly  didn t make the restaurant hot.   We sat at the bar and the bartender was a bit obnoxious and loud but that s really my only complaint. He said  my friend  no less than 3 dozen times while we were there.   The Smoked tuna  Octopus  amp  Shrimp Tostada  Cilantro Emulsion  Salsa Macha was perfect. I could ve eaten 10 more of these. The flavors complemented each other deliciously.   The Huauzontle Fritters  Quesillo  Habanero Ash Emulsion were a nice starter side. Great  interesting flavor with the emulsion.   The Texas Mushroom Quesadilla Was simple compared to the other dishes. The mushrooms were prepared perfectly and were inside a tasty corn tortilla.   Pulpo En Su Tinta  Spanish Octopus  Black Garlic Mole  Quinoa was beautiful and smelled amazing. This took some time to prepare and came out some time after we had finished the other three dishes but was still super yummy. I had never eaten octopus in this manner with these flavors. Glad I ordered it.   Will absolutely be visiting again.
Comedor,122,The food was good enough  but the portions were small even for tapas. It was INSANELY expensive. But the service was amazing.
Comedor,123,Wow  Words cannot describe how amazing Comedor is. From the modern decor to the fantastic bartenders to the phenomenal food  my entire experience was top notch    I sat at the bar and asked for a cocktail with mezcal. The bartender  Seth  quickly asked my likes dislikes and customized the drink based on my preferences. The drink blew my mind  I ordered 2 more and each got better and better. I ve never had a mezcal cocktail that was so customized and so delicious    For food  I ordered the bone marrow tacos and the chocolate tamal for dessert. I ve never had bone marrow so I didn t know what to expect. The dish was presented beautifully and the bone marrow was tender  flavorful and so damn good. Each bite melted in my mouth. The chocolate tamal was also presented beautifully and was the perfect way to end the night.   Without a doubt  I would come to Comedor again 
Comedor,124,One of my favorite restaurants in Austin. The food is quality across the board and the bone marrow tacos in particular are unreal. Service is top tier - knowledgeable  warm  prompt  and pays attention to detail.  Can t wait for my next visit 
Comedor,125,Been saying I m going to come here for so long  and I finally got it done. Yellow rose on tap -- let s go      The sushi tostada was great... so well done  I did it as one of the appetizers. This would be my go to. I didn t expect it to be as good as it was. Great dish.   Truly the quesadilla was disappointing--bland. The tortilla shouldn t be the most flavorful thing associated with a quesadilla. I think Gordon Ramsey would have taken it out of his mouth in front of the waitress  and made a   disgusted face .  That same masa was used as the boat that my pork belly tacos came in. This was the dish I came to Comedor for. It was done wonderfully. Our table ate it all. Not the best in Austin  but it s the second best  and I ll be back to eat it again.   All in all. 4 people we ate and drank a lot -- came out less than  300 including a good tip. Great value for what we got in my opinion.   Kinda fake uppity though... trying to draw in a specific kind of clientele. They want a date crowd  not a loud group looking to have a good time.   Nice place  well laid out  and the food is solid.
Comedor,126,I ve had a lot of tacos. None gave ever come close to what we had during brunch  fish tacos.  Absolutely unreal.  Don t skip the homemade Bloody Mary either. Extremely well done.
Comedor,127,Seriously amazing experience here. The service was absolutely impeccable. We were celebrating my friends 40th birthday and they even went above and beyond and had a card for her on the table signed by the whole staff  Every dish was absolutely amazing. They re taking The recommended precautions because of COVID-19  they do have a shortened menu because of that as well so I can t wait to go back and experience their full menu one day  For me  the highlight was the pork belly  Also  the cocktails were insanely delicious. This place is a stand out Austin MUST.
Comedor,128,I had to write this immediately afterwards so I wouldn t forget our experience and what we ordered. We came to Comedor to celebrate our 2 year anniversary  and we honestly couldn t have picked somewhere better. First off  they ve done a great job with accommodating to COVID. Everyone was seated pretty far away from each other  and every single table had a bottle of hand sanitizer. Waiters wore masks  so it still felt like a personal dining experience. Our waitress was really kind and came frequently to ask us how we were doing and if we wanted more drinks.   We ordered 4 things to share  it s recommended that you order plates to share with the table  and two cocktails. We both enjoyed our cocktails a lot. I can t really take strong alcohol  so my ancho-guajillo vodka was perfect. It was fruity and a bit heavy because of the mango. My boyfriend thought his drink was really well made too  Oaxaca Margarita .   The food was phenomenal. We loved  loved  LOVED the pork belly. It was seriously one of the best pork dishes we ve ever had in our entire lives. Everything was so well balanced  and the pork was tender. I m not a huge fan of black beans  but you ve got to try theirs. Pair it with the sauce because each bite will give a nice kick. We also really loved the tuna. It was a bit acidic and tart  but the crispy kale chips gave a nice texture to the soft tuna. I would say our least favorite picks of the night were the bone marrow tacos and the little salmon tostada chip. It wasn t to say that they weren t good  but they were less impressive than the other two dishes we ordered. I know the bone marrow tacos are probably what Comedor is famous for  but I d actually pass on them next time I visit. The bone marrow was a bit too heavy and at some point  it felt like eating candle wax. That s strange for me to comment on because I m a huge fan of bone marrow  but it wasn t doing it for me tonight.   We were so impressed with Comedor. I highly recommend you visit and order the pork belly. My boyfriend isn t easily impressed by restaurants  but we couldn t stop complimenting the service  drinks  and food the entire time we were here. Thank you for a memorable dinner  Comedor 
Comedor,129,We loved this new Austin addition to the restaurant scene.  I beautiful decor.  Fabulous courtyard patio.  Garage doors into the dining areas for spring and fall will be lovely.  Such cool space  architectural details.  Maitre D  was super welcoming and professional.  Waitstaff team were friendly  helpful with ingredients  how to eat  context of the menu  favorites  etc.  The perfect Austin cool  friendly  professional  knowledgeable combination.    Dishes we tried   Bone Marrow Tacos  of course   amazing so full after eating ONE taco with one spoonful of marrow   The octopus with black and green mole  so so tasty  .  The Fish special  tonight Halibut with green mole and jicama slaw  was amazing and tasty.  We will be back to try more dishes   We recommend you try Comedor.  What a lovely AUSTIN dining experience  date night.
Comedor,130,Amazing food  amazing service  amazing atmosphere  Perfect place for a special occasion  Can t find food like this easily and we ll worth the price for a special evening.
Comedor,131,My girlfriends and I made reservations for a Saturday evening to this new modern Mexican restaurant and everything we ordered was incredible. First off  the atmosphere and design inside was very intriguing. The high glass walls of the building sheds in lots of natural light    The waitress explained the menu to us after our cocktail orders which was very wonderful. I can t quite remember what it was but it had pineapple flavoring and very refreshing     We ordered 3 small plates and 2 entree plates to share. It was definitely filling for 3 gals.   -The seafood fluke was soaked in a citrus-like broth and the flavors were amazing   -The quesadilla that was made with blue corn was fantastic. The filling was a earthy and sweet huitlacoche aka corn fungus with a chile salsa which made it perfect   -My favorite were the Bone Marrow Tacos - so buttery it melts in your mouth with a side of tortillas  The kale underneath was great and seasoned wonderfully   -The Pork Belly dish was on a bean tortilla creation with a marmalade sauce - delicious   And lastly   we had the Pulpo ensu tinto - octopus covered in black squid ink Wouk spicy mole    I give this restaurant a 5 star for the food   excellent service and great ambience  
Comedor,132,Comedor provided a top-notch experience for 7 of us celebrating graduation. The restaurant design itself is very impressive and makes a great atmosphere to enjoy some fantastic food. The menu is very simple and everything is meant to be shared family style. Even with various dietary restrictions  this was not a problem. I started off with the Agave Guava drink and it was very refreshing with a hint of smokiness from the mezcal that was not overpowering. Everyone else was also satisfied with their cocktails. Next up were the tostadas  which were all full of flavor and crunch. The tacos de pescado were fried grouper tacos that had an excellent batter that was crispy yet soft and buttery. The tuna aguachile was a great combination of citrus and spice. We also got the mushroom quesadilla which was just alright. The roasted artichoke was perhaps the one low point - it was too salty and they did not peel off the bottom layer  making it very hard to eat. The pi ce de r sistance came at the end  however with the bone marrow tacos. The bone marrow had a divine caramelized pecan layer on top  combined with some lettuce and lime made for some very unique tacos. Comedor does an excellent job of serving Mexican food that sticks to tradition but also experiments with some new bold flavors.
Comedor,133,Brunch was wonderful. The ambiance is super trendy  especially outdoors. The servers are quite knowledgeable  and the wine options...while pricy...are excellent. We enjoyed the Texas mushroom quesadilla and the Plato comedor. Both were really filling. You might have to skip some of the bread that comes with it  depending on your appetite.
Comedor,134,If I could do a review and summit up in just one word it would be amazing  Truly  amazing. The food was unlike anything I ve ever tasted in Austin  the service was perfect  everyone was knowledgeable and the experience was definitely memorable. Chef Gabriel came to the table and wished me a happy birthday with a birthday card signed by all of the staff on duty. It s true what they say  you may not remember the person who gave you service  you may not remember all of the food you had but what you will remember is how they made you feel. Thanks for making my birthday so incredible and so memorable. Can t wait to see you all again 
Comedor,135,Oh Comedor.  You so sexy.  Let s start with your cover.  The exterior looks like a chic loft of a famous celebrity New Yorker who has all the monies but doesn t was the Versace flash.   And the interior boasts more of the same.   Incredibly chic   well designed with high end finishes at every turn.  The windows walls raise so its a true indoor outdoor experience with the lighting making both spaces intimate and romantic.   The food holds its own against this scene.  This is the most creative  unique food I have had in Austin in years.  Black garlic mole  habanero ash emulsion  bone marrow tacos  all just incredible.  Close your eyes and savor incredible.  Make a reservation and come every week incredible.   A new true gem of Austin  Speer has outdone himself.
Comedor,136,So this place is somewhere I had been super excited to go visit. However  they unfortunately are closed due to covid but that hasn t stopped them from sharing some of there delicious creations   They have a delivery service or pick up option now I believe and I got to experience there bone marrow tacos. Which at first I thought was maybe a little weird but they were so tasty    You prep food for maybe 20 min and boom  ready to eat   I kind of like this idea better then takeout as sometimes I order and by that time it s not the same . So this is genius and highly recommend for a night in of great dining 
Comedor,137,This place used to be fantastic  Not sure if they changed chefs but we literally had the worst  400 meal possible.  Every dish was bland at best and cold   Also  the atmosphere is great but a little more lighting would be appreciated  we literally ate in the dark  Drinks and service were fantastic but the food was horrible. They also serviced it on rolled up napkins that was frankly gross.  Dish towels harbor bacteria no matter how many times they are washed.  This is not a unique presentation it s just gross   Generally I give a restaurant a  one off  but it was so bad and there are too many restaurants for me to give this another try.
Comedor,138,Incredible flavors in classic dishes and great additions  caviar  grasshoppers  etc . You may pass the door and not realize it s there. Look for the black building. It has lovely outside seating and great sunlight  inside  amp  outside .  We tried the guacamole tostada  lettuce  amp  avocado salad  quesadilla  pulpo  Spanish octopus   and tamal de chocolate.   The staff were very welcoming and versed on the menu.
Comedor,139,Food is not good  it is horrible  This place needs to be shut down. Today. The food is absolutely bad. The bartenders are slow. The service bad. The manager is a disaster. The restrooms are creepy. Don t go here     
Comedor,140,The Comedor space doesn t look like much from the outside but is awesome inside  however  it s literally lit by candlelight only so it s really  really dark. The food was over priced  very salty and generally not good. I was expecting more from the  300 tab we got. There s a lot of potential there and I d heard good things  but at the moment I would not recommend. It was bad.
Comedor,141,I was very skeptical about how much I d enjoy coming here because I don t like bone marrow and only heard about this as the signature dish. BUT  there are other spectacular dishes I really loved  For starters  the avocado tostada sounds basic  but it s charred smoky cauliflower balanced by the fresh  citrus ingredients brought it to a new level. I could eat ten of them. I asked for a good mocktail  and the waitress suggested the guava aguas frescas. It is now my current obsession  The wild mushroom quesadilla with Oaxaca cheese probably ruined quesadillas for me. The cheese is out of this world  slap yo mama amazing. The crispy fish tacos with purple cabbage was a satisfying protein dish. You got to love house made tortillas  I was wondering why they decided to serve the charred choy sum salad last  but after the first bite  I understood why  because of the salty savory flavor. It s topped with crispy pumpkin seed dukkah and drenched in shoyu powder. Eaten and enjoyed almost like a steak  Would 100  recommend this fine dining Mexican restaurant to anyone looking for elevated food in a nice atmosphere.
Comedor,142,I cannot begin to describe how amazing this place is. It is truly worth all of the hype  I promise   It s a place to go with friends  where you can a bunch of plates to share  and split the bill because it adds up FAST   and experience as much as possible.   I recently tried the Taco Tasting happy hour option and it is worth five times the  25 price. Get there a few minutes before Happy Hour starts to secure a spot at the bar  because it fills up quickly  And get ready to have your tastebuds be delighted. Apparently it can change daily  but my tacos were fried fish  braised beet greens  carnitas  beef tongue  and an amazing dessert taco. SO. GOOD.  On the regular menu the beef bone marrow tacos are the star  but every ingredient was fresh and flavorful. There wasn t a single bad bite on the menu   Plus their drinks are just perfect.  I will definitely be back  and often.
Comedor,143,After reading reviews we decided to make a birthday party reservation at this place. They required to sign a contract indicating that if cancellation happen less than a month before the reservation we will be charged 100  of the dinner price  They even asked us to preselect drinks in advance  We had to follow so many rules and obligations  and of course we expected to get the best service and food. Unfortunately upon arrival we were informed that they can not accommodate our party at one table and will sit us at 2 different tables  When we expressed our concern about it and asked manager to do something about it to fix the situation  he showed zero compassion and willingness to help  not even trying to offer a simple solution  He had to bring a GM to  see what he can do . After some time of their negotiations  management finally decided that they can move tables together  OMG- it seemed to be a vey hard decision to make for them from the beginning  And Again no single apology for the created f ck  up and ruined mood  As for the food  it was TERRIBLE  Each individual portion had to be shared for 3 people    Without any thought from their side how this process will be happening  Basically  all 3 people had to stick their spoons and forks  at the bowl and try to break the food apart to get their piece    No other option  It was Just HORRIBLE   1. Tuna was covered in a super spicy sauce which nobody even told us when it was served  No taste of fish- at all    2. Salad- plain leafs of undressed     lettuce and no other ingredient  Everyone was shocked how bad was it  3. Tacos with bone marrow- super acidic kale which can t be chewed  and no taste of bone marrow Due to the overwhelming acid  killing all other flavors  ohh I wish I could not eat them at all- but unfortunately there was no other food  4. Fish tacos- tasted like chicken from KFC. That s all  5. Bloody chicken   2 of the chickens served were with blood  After showing this to the manager  he saw it and agreed to change it.  But When the substitute chicken was even more bloody  GM decided to tell us that it s not a blood  but a brine  and  it is not possible for this chicken to be raw because it goes through multiple stages of cooking    Really         I will leave pictures here for you  to see that disgusting food they served to us   And drinks were long awaited and not spectacular as well  
Comedor,144,A secret sanctuary and an amazing meal. Meant for those who appreciate really good food. It s a surreal experience.
Comedor,145,On a business trip and looking for a place to eat.  We  stumbled  across this place and we didn t have a Rez.  Get one  .  Nevertheless we were accepted graciously and sat in a prime part of the restaurant   The service was outstanding and the recommendations were excellent n point.  Do not pass on the bone marrow tacos    And do not pass on trying tequilas.  It s going to cost you.  But should cares  YOLO .  Hello new favorite fancy Austin restaurant   
Comedor,146,So it s kinda tricky to find even if you re looking at it on a map  lol. Very discreet  we drove past it once and then managed to walk past it after we valeted the car  Ha    The interior is as sleek and modern and lovely as everyone raves about. The outdoor patio looked super cozy with blankets and standing heaters with lots of greenery. Def planning to come back for HH and try to snag an outdoor spot.   Service was top notch. Our waiter Jared was on point     Some of the dishes really wowed me. Others I could definitely do with out. The ones I LOVED  big eye tuna and scallop crudo. Both were silky smooth in texture and the marinade was danky good with a definite kick for the tastebuds.   The broccoli tamal was very good    The mother flipping bone marrow. Y all. Full stop. So I d never had bone marrow before. My boyfriend was afraid it wouldn t be my jam. He was wrong. I liked it soo much I almost fought him over the last bit  on his birthday dinner  AND he was paying- aka worst girlfriend ever  it s ok he loves me and we shared. The greens underneath the marrow had been charred with burnt butter I believe and while one could think they are merely a garnish they were a force to be reckoned with in and of themselves and I ate them all.   Dishes I could live without  the heirloom tomato salad. It just was underwhelming to me. Alll I could taste was the hard masa pieces. For my main dish I ordered the Tilefish. This was partly my fault. I was thinking it was a white flaky light fish. Turns out the texture is more like lobster  dense and not my thing. The broth was one of miso and mushrooms  both of which I like but the dish was overall very earthy and I just didn t care for the textures and flavors. Should ve gone for the beef option but how was I to know  Next time. The manfrand had the pork dish and I thought it was heavy handed on the Achiote or whatever it s called but it was pretty good.   I had the vodka drink that went down like juice  And the Comedor margarita which was lovely. Boyfran had the martini and it was perfection for sipping.   Chef sent out  their avocado mouse and chocolate dessert concoction for my mans bday and it was delightful. So many things happening on the palate  We had already ordered the guava and chamomile option and were thrilled with both.  So the bathroom situation was kinda disappointing to me. Yes it s gender neutral Bc that seems to be very important these days. Waited for one of the 4 doors to become open. The cells  I mean bathrooms  are something between what you d find in prison and an airplane lavatory. Small  dark  cold  depressing. Maybe they thought if they made them this way they would become free quicker    Had a really lovely evening here. I understand their big eye tuna is  on HH so I ll be back for that and an order of marrow and some dranks 
Comedor,147,Another girls night dinner yields another yelp review  Anyways on our monthly dinner adventure we went out to check out the highly rated comedor and let me tell you the hype is there but the food wasn t mind blowing to me or the other ladies. The ambiance of the restaurant feels too upscale for Austin  it reminded me of a combination of a bar in brickell  Miami and an upscale restaurant in Dallas. The patio area is nice but the whole ambiance is dark super dark.... Jared our server provided a lot of help navigating the menu and thus we ordered about 5 small plates and an entree. The small plates were as follows  the scallop crudo  huauzontle fritters masa spaetzle  chicken liver mousse  sotol-grilled carrots  and a yellowtail tuna aguachile. I think the table favorite was the masa spaetzle  it was pleasantly surprising with of its complex textures including corn nuts. The picture isn t instagram worth as it s brought in a black bowl and has been charred on top. They sure do like to put a kick to everything  If you don t like spice don t order the yellowtail aguachile it had a lot of kick to it. The fritters were good but lacked some textural notes and also were a bit over salted  I did enjoy the ash emulsion which was unique. Lastly one more note on the chicken liver mousse with churro and beets is that the flavors by themselves were good but combined together wasn t overall spectacular or my favorite.  We ordered the pork belly entree which was large enough to share between the three of us. It s presented with two strips of pork belly  some shredded pork  pickled red onions  and a blue corn tortilla made in house. Same as the small plates is that it was good but nothing to rave about.   Lastly we always end dinner with dessert and ordered the tres leches with corn milk. I was thoroughly impressed with the presentation  probably one of the most beautiful desserts I ve seen. The corn milk poured into the dish upon arrival topped it all off. This was probably one of my favorites.   It was worth the food adventure but I don t think I ll be back anytime soon  the prices are quiet high for the portions and nothing was overall super memorable.
Comedor,148,This was an amazing experience   This place deserves the 5 stars.  A group of us girls went here for a friends birthday dinner.  We made reservations prior to showing up  and upon arrival  they had our table set up with a birthday card with all of the employees signatures   This was a great personal touch.  Our waiter was super friendly and very attentive.  All of the food that we tried was delicious.  It is a little pricey so be prepared to pay a little more  but it is well worth the price.  The parking garage is very close and very convenient especially for downtown.  The drinks were also amazing   Basically I can t say enough good things about this restaurant 
Comedor,149,I m between 2 and 3 for this. Bumped up to 3 for the good service. Food  was meh. Their Huauzontle Fritters were easily forgettable. The ash emulsion seemed like a cool thing to do  but for me  it fell flat on flavor. The Goat Barbecoa Tamal was nothing special  mainly to it lacking flavor which is kind of a problem.  At  29  the bone marrow tacos  is stupid expensive. I love bone marrow and before Comedor  I have never paid more than  19 for it anywhere  and that includes major US cities like NYC  Chicago  and LA. Was it the thing we liked most out of the 3 dishes we tried  yes. Was there an ample amount of bone marrow making the price more palatable  yes. Do I like that the accompanying tortillas are made in house  yes. Do I wish the flour tortillas were bigger  yes. Do I wish the corn tortillas had any flavor at all  yes. Where there enough tortillas  not at all. Would I get this dish again  no. This is one of those  I m glad I tried it  but I would not get it again.  The place is undeniably cool. That said  I don t know if the architect or those who built it are to blame  but we came in on a super rainy night and they literally had buckets out trying to catch the rain as it was leaking through the ceiling  and along one side by the outside area  there were huge puddles we could see from the window.  For drinks we got wine and beer. I refrained from any of their cocktails  mainly because their bar program is run by the same people behind Garage  cocktail bar  next door. Garage  very similarly to our Comedor experience  is cool on the outside  but not much else.  Comedor is chic  the new hip kind in town coming on the scene last year and people are going to flock here. I think most will love it. For me however  I cannot say I won t return  but nothing we ate gave us any confidence or desire to return. Sadly I felt the same about Bonhomie  Speers previous venture . Comedor is a cool concept and I wish them well.
Comedor,150,updating review after my most recent experience.  food and atmosphere were still amazing  but way too salty  but service took a major nose dive since my last review.  we were seated and ignored for 15 minutes.  then we ordered drinks and food. there was a hiccup when we asked for pescatarian recommendations and were given steak and chicken as suggestions.   got a few dishes of food before and we asked where our drinks were. we were told they were being made    still had a great evening but being ignored and not getting drinks for over 30 minutes kinda put a damper on thinks.
Comedor,151,We just prepared the steak and seafood dinner from assembly kitchen. It was superb. I can t believe how every element went together so well. It was as good as in the restaurant but with just a little more work and learning built in.The online instructions were fun  funny and informative. The accompanying playlist was genius.  Now  just to ally your suspicions that I m a sycophant plant  I cook at home daily from my garden. This was far better than I could do. Am I jealous  Just a little.
Comedor,152,You d think you would be polite to patrons that spend thousands of dollars at your establishment instead of throwing them out for a minor issue about a mask. Oh well.
Comedor,153,Cute spot  somewhat of a hidden gem behind the nondescript door.  Nice outdoor patio dining area and indoor area.  The food was delicious   I ordered the Cochinita pibil  amp  pork belly memela  Xni-pec.  Very flavorful and tasty.  The smoked tuna  octopus  and shrimp tostada with cilantro emulsion and salsa Macha was also delicious.  The quesadilla with Texas mushrooms  huitlacoche and queso de Oaxaca was good but the tortilla was a little dry and bland.  Overall we enjoyed our dining experience at this place.  The servers were very friendly  knowledgeable and attentive.  Romi was excellent  As the sun set  the lighting was there but it s more on the dark side  casting lots of shadows.
Comedor,154,One of the best meals we ve ever had. Great service and atmosphere  incredible food  quesadilla  grilled broccoli  and bone marrow tacos. Chocolate tamal for dessert was delicious. Nice cocktails too.
Comedor,155,New restaurant that has a lot of potential but still needs to get their act together.   - Their location on both Google Maps and Yelp shows it being in the middle of the intersection. And the fact that their door is black  barely marked and flushed against the wall  it s very hard to find the spot.  - Menu is quite limited. There s like 7-ish for appetizers and another 7-ish for the entree. And that s about it. If one has dietary restrictions  religious or and health  it s down to about 2 choices.  - Wish portions would be a tad bigger or would come with a bigger side.  - And this is going to be a controversial one  No free chips and salsa    That being said  the food is quite delicious. There are definitely better classy-Nuevo Mexican restaurants in Dallas and OKC I ve been to but being a new one I m willing to give this one a second chance. Good luck 
Comedor,156,Comedor in the evening is  swagggyyy. The space is beautiful. The dark tile with high gloss finish is super romantic. I had dinner with about 10 people there. I was surprised they where able to accommodate us but  I m glad they did. Our group was a mix of sober  vegetarian  vegan  and omnivore eaters. They where able to cater to each of our preferences without fuss. Our servers where very kind and patient. The mezcal selection was very impressive and the non alcoholic drinks where delicious and bright in flavor. The menu is made to share  so if you re a particular eater  I d recommend you order a couple of dishes for yourself  as the food comes out as it is ready and you do t want to be stuck waiting for a single dish while your friends or date enjoy their food.
Comedor,157,Great food. Great drinks. Cool atmosphere. We asked the bartender to give us the full experience and order for us. He did not disappoint.
Comedor,158,Great food. Interesting flavor combinations and great quality. Friendly service. Lovely setting Highly recommend 
Comedor,159,JUST WOW  I felt like a judge on a chef show trying these dishes and falling in love with each item. We were extremely impressed with every single dish here. Delicious is an understatement. It was so unique  the flavors were refreshing  amp  bursting  and everything made with attention to detail. The service was great.   I would HIGHLY recommend finishing with the chocolate tamal    YOUR LIFE WILL CHANGE.
Comedor,160,My boyfriend and I went here to Valentine s Day and I loved it  They asked if it was our first time and gave a quick run down of the menu  but the waiter told us it s best for us to make our choices on our own rather than them give suggestions  although they did highlight that the bone marrow tacos are popular.  We got the bone marrow tacos  octopus dish  and pork belly  They bone marrow and pork belly were soooo good -- quite possibly some of the best things I ve ever put in my mouth. My boyfriend and I both agreed the octopus had a bit too much squid ink though  we couldn t finish it.
Comedor,161,We really enjoyed our experience at Comedor. First  the ambience and decor are exceptionally cool. The steel and glass is a beautiful setting for a restaurant. The outdoor patio is enhanced by a brick wall. They have full length garage type doors that open to the patio but it was a little too warm for them to open it while we were there. The servers  all dressed in black are very knowledgeable and helpful in picking out food. The food itself is extremely unique. We had Items that we never had before. We love the idea of the smaller tapas moving towards the larger meals on the menu. We enjoyed the avocado tostada  Ahi tuna with a watermelon soup base  delicious eggplant dish and finally bone marrow tacos. We ended our meal with a very decadent deep chocolate dish  complimented with maple ice cream. One of the fun experiences at this restaurant was people watching. I m not sure I ve ever seen so many beautiful people in one place.
Comedor,162,5 stars  obviously. Now here s why  this is the closest you ll get to experiencing anything like Pujol and Quintonil this side of the Rio Grande. Comedor absolutely nailed this iteration of CDMX cuisine. Layers upon layers of flavors while using unique ingredients. Every bite offered multiple flavors. The staff is amazing and knowledgeable. The ambiance  although a little too darkly lit  is perfect for the location and the restaurant s theme. We had the tuna aguachile which was incredible. We also had the eggplant conserva and ate it taco style  amazing. We had the desert sage cocktail which was pretty unique. The agua frescas were tasty. Don t hesitate to get dressed up and make a reservation here. Cheers 
Comedor,163,It s the coolest restaurant I ve seen in 2019. Seriously  wasn t this a sketchy downtown parking lot last year  If you look up  amazing restaurant design  in the dictionary  there s got to be a picture of this place.  I just don t know enough about real Mexican cuisine to tell you how good it is. Pretty much everything I tasted had a fiery aftertaste - I bit it  it bit me back. Is this genuine spicy Oaxaca  Your mouth certainly won t get bored.   What I do know is the bone marrow dish and the mushroom quesadilla are superb  and if that s all I could get on my next visit here  I d be perfectly happy. The service is impeccable. Oh  and maybe some more of that chamomile mousse  while I figure out how to frame Frost Tower through the plate glass windows. A spectacular nighttime shot. If you just need to impress somebody with the current state of downtown Austin - or even maybe yourself - Comedor has you covered.
Comedor,164,TL DR  I hope you like cinnamon.   We had a late reservation and asked if we could go in early. Waiting list was 1 and a half hours long even though there were plenty of empty tables. I guess it adds to the mystique if it s hard to get in.   Our reservation was only 45 minutes away so we headed to the bar. Delicious cocktails.   We ordered the chicken liver mousse while we waited. The mousse was perfectly silky  but it was accompanied by a sickly sweet Meyer lemon marmalade and topped by a well crafted churro with cinnamon on the top.  Challenging  our waiter called it. More like confusing  I d say. Every element was exquisitely prepared but together they made no sense. I m all for mixing sweet and savory but the marmalade overpowered the mousse - which was delicious on its own. Adding to the mess was the cinnamon in the churro. Why was it there  Did it get lost  Did the kitchen confuse cinnamon with pepper   Spoiler alert  I think they did .   Once at our table we ordered bone marrow tacos  goat tamal  Spanish octopus  the pibil memela and the culotte.   The goat tamal was good  if basic. The red salsa with goat fat was tasty but not all that different from an good enchilada sauce. The goat barbacoa was slightly salty  but well cooked.   The bone marrow was rich  well cut and expertly cooked... then covered in brown sugar and caramelized. Why  It s not a creme br l e. The quelites on the bottom were serviceable but little more than an afterthought. Again  lots of well executed cooking throughout leading to a confused dish.   The Spanish octopus was good. Could have used some tortillas on the side.   The memela itself was good  but the pibil was overpowered by cinnamon. I understand cinnamon is traditionally used in some families on pibil but this was overpowering. The pork belly was an unnecessary addition to the dish. Too fatty and cut into a long strip that made no sense. Also... more cinnamon.   Finally  the coulotte. The meat was terrible. It was cooked to the perfect temperature  but the meat was tough and chewy. Certainly not worth 42 dollars. The mole would have been great  if it didn t taste of... more cinnamon. I really think the kitchen messed up a container during prep today.   Overall  a very mediocre meal for the price. Service was good  which is why this gets two stars.
Comedor,165,Outstanding dining experience   First  the restaurant s architecture   interior design is crazy impressive. As you walk in  Comedor has that New York City restaurant feel with high ceilings and modern industrial design.  We ordered the following  with brief comments regarding each   Starters   1  Smoked Tuna  Octopus  amp  Shrimp Tostada  Cilantro Emulsion  Salsa Macha. Tasty  but you literally get one tostada  I would recommend avoiding this plate. It s way too small to even eat by yourself.   2  Chicken Liver Mousse  Churro  Beets  Apple. Not the best chicken liver mousse I ve had.   3  Quesadilla  Texas Mushrooms  Huitlacoche  Quesillo de Oaxaca. Exemplary example of what a traditional Mexican quesadilla from this region tastes like.   4  Bone Marrow Tacos  Quelites  Smoked Butter  Hoja Santa-Pecan Gremolata. This one is a must order item and maybe one of the best plates I ve had this year     Platos Fuertes   1  Spanish Octopus  Black Garlic Mole  Quinoa. Very good  but only if you like Mole.   2  Halibut a la Plancha  Mole Verde  Turnip  Fennel. Very tasty and a generous portion.  3  Peeler Ranch Coulotte  Chichilo Negro Mole. My second favorite plate on the Menu--again you have to like Mole.   All together  this is a 5 Star Austin restaurant  much like what you would encounter in NY  DC or San Francisco.
Comedor,166,Truly a hidden gem in the city.  It might not be easily spotted from the outside given its low key appearance from the outside  walls of dark bricks  and the restaurant name appears to be an amulet with vertical writing.  The architecture inside is pretty unique. The nice bar and the dining area opens to a patio with the ambience of a garden stroll. A mini escape from the car traffic outside.  The food and the cocktails are fantastic. I went for Agave Chamomile and Ancho-Guajillo Vodka  They were full of layers.  Don t skip on the best bone-marrow dish ever. It is served taco style and doesn t come with blandness. Fatty and loaded flavor  the sprinkle and the kale salad bed. They make kale taste sexy.  These are the good dishes I ve tried so far from the Appetizer section  Para La Mesa    Smoked Tuna  Octopus  amp  Shrimp Tostada  Heirloom Tomato  Big Eye Tuna.  One of the good dishes from the main entrees is Spanish Octopus. It is well balanced between chewiness and mushiness. Black and green mole are smooth.  I also had the grouper dish and it was not my favorite.  Wrap up the dinner with a tawny port. The tres leches cake did not leave a good impression on me.  I have been here twice and I won t stop there.
Comedor,167,Everything is fresh and good can t go wrong it is pricey but worth it. You won t regret goong
Comedor,168,If you re not an adventurous eater or appreciate trying different foods  this may not be for you. This was an amazing food luxe experience  I ve been here twice already and it s been consistently good and a unique dining experience. I definitely enjoyed the aguachile  snapper tostada  and the barbacoa tacos. The food definitely filled me up  The bone marrow was okay and was slightly too sweet for my taste. The drinks were also good and if you love mezcal this place is for you  The portion sizes were small for what you were getting. The only thing I didn t like was the grilled salad as I was wanting a side of raw greens instead of the charred  bitter greens they served. The dessert was interesting. The chocolate ball was extremely bitter  dense  and decadent while the sweet ice cream cut through the rich chocolate flavor. To be honest  I m not sure if it satisfied my sweet craving. Also the lighting was very dark so I would ve liked it if it was a little bit more brighter. It was quite hard to see inside. Overall  I definitely see myself coming back for special occasions 
Comedor,169,Comedor is a beautiful restaurant that serves upscale Mexican food. My favorite thing on the menu is the halibut tacos. They are fried to perfection and have the perfect blend of ingredients on top. I also enjoy the critters that come with the habenero ash dip  literally to die for. The drinks are delicious and the bartenders are friendly. This is a wonderful restaurant downtown. Great for happy hour  date night  business dinners  or any occasion 
Comedor,170,I drove in from Fort Worth to meet with a friend just to try a restaurant we have not been to before. We could not have been any happier with our choice. The food was phenomenal. Our favorite being the bone marrow tacos. Brittany Y was our server and she was a bonus with this culinary experience. Every bite of food  and Brittany made dinner so much fun. Ask for her if you want the best.
Comedor,171,This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to and has the taken traditional Mexican cuisine and elevated it to another level.  The flavors  the vibe  the service was absolutely spot on. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu and nothing disappointed .. from a humble cabbage to the chili oil infused braised pork .. absolutely amazing.  I will make a trip to Austin just to eat here   
Comedor,172,One of the top ten meals I ve had hands down  Ive been twice   Not only is the food amazing but the service is some of the best I have ever had.  The servers  food runners  managers everyone we came in contact with was on top of everything.  We practically ordered the whole menu so I am just going to highlight some of my favorites.  The Mezcal cocktail is my fav drink on the menu.  As for food some of the standout  can t miss dishes are  Huauzontle Fritters  the Ash emulsion is so unique and delicious    Bone Marrow Tacos  Not to be missed  not to mention beautiful    Yellowfin Tuna  Light  refreshing  and delicious   Masa Spaetzel  not the prettiest dish but soo good   and the Double-Cut Pork Chop  wow  .    This spot just popped up out of now where  it used to be the most random empty lot downtown .  Now its this discreet oasis in the middle of downtown.  I love the glass bricks and black walls hiding this little gem.
Comedor,173,We had a delicious  and surprisingly affordable  brunch here. When you walk in  you re immediately stunned by the soaring  modern architecture. It s truly a beautiful space. They have a gorgeous patio outside too. We had a reservation but the place wasn t crowded. All the employees were dressed in suits  fancy    but they were still very friendly.  Unlike dinner  which is more family-style  you can order your own plate during brunch. But definitely share if you want. For 2  we shared the pambazo torta and pan dulce. The torta  stuffed with red chorizo  potatoes  guac  refried beans  and a fried egg  was huge and SO good. It had the perfect flavor profile in each bite. The pan dulce came with 4 pastries  elotes scone  mole  amp  chocolate babka  guava  amp  queso kolache  and ensaimada. All of them were buttery and delicious  I love how they creatively incorporated Mexican flavors. The selections change each weekend  but I m sure they re all great.  The portions were large. We split the torta and took some pastries to-go. Brunch was a steal  especially compared to the pricey dinner. However  I ve noticed that their prices have increased a lot since when I visited  around  3-4 extra per plate . Seems a little fishy  but costs are expensive these days. I want to come back to try the taco tasting happy hour 
Comedor,174,Beautiful transporting place. Great cocktail. The food was OK  but not good enough to want to go back to the place.
Comedor,175,Love the atmosphere  food and service. Great place for a date night. Delicious food and crafted cocktails  Indulge a little.. it s worth it 
Comedor,176,The investments made in Comedor are extraordinary. The first thing about Comedor that one notices is that it is in a brand new stand-alone building on corner in downtown Austin.  The design is stunning with soaring ceilings  and a hidden patio garden.  It would be nice if they could add a shade system to the west facing windows.  For half of our meal we were blinded by the sun streaming in through those beautiful high windows and that really marred what was otherwise a spectacular culinary experience.  The caliber of the staff was the next thing that we noticed.  Everyone one that we saw was hyper alert to taking care of guests and elegant in how they held themselves. Throughout our meal every server we had was knowledgable  polite  and at the right level of service. At one point a server with a spoon in his hand appeared just as I was peering at the mole at the bottom of a bowl that I just wasn t able to scoop with my fork.  Watching and anticipating what guests need is an exceptional level of service that is rarely experienced.  And then of course there was the food.  Best level ingredients.  Perfect preparation. And top notch presentation.  For two people  we ordered four shareable dishes and a dessert. This amount left us a bit full  but the food was worth it.    However when they say  shareable  you ve got to be on pretty good terms with your table to share for some of the items.  For instance the pea tostada on the August 2019 menu is a single tostada that is a bit messy to break into portions.  Other items are single units that are not discrete units and everyone will be dipping in to the same item.  One item that worked super well for sharing was the bone marrow tacos. Four sections of bone served on a bed of cooked kale  served with a basket of six tortillas  both flour and corn   making it easy for a table of sharers to each make their own taco.  Not only were the bone marrow tacos super shareable  they were super special and delicious.  Comedor completely delivers on high-end  upscale Mexican cuisine.
Comedor,177,Excellent food  excellent service  can t wait to come back with a flashlight so I really see the place   
Comedor,178,The best margarita in Austin HANDS DOWN  Seth is absolute gem of a bartender  I can t wait to come back 
Comedor,179,Absolutely perfect   New favorite restaurant in Austin hands down. Everything was amazing- the food  drinks  service  ambiance. The vibes are just so great. Our waiter was fabulous- we ordered based on his recommendations and everything was delicious   the presentation was beautiful. Our favorites were the tacos al vapor  bone marrow       chicken  tuna aguachile. Cant wait to come back and order more.
Comedor,180,Save your money and go somewhere  anywhere else in Austin. Food was salty and not good at all. No idea why the other reviews are so great. Service was disappointing. After spending over  300 on dinner for 2  I couldn t even find a clean restroom stall. Gas station restrooms are cleaner than Comedor s. If they aren t cleaning their restrooms who knows what else they are doing in the kitchen.
Comedor,181,This was my second time dining at Comedor  and I cannot speak more highly of the food  service  and COVID safety.  Our waitress bartender Brandi made our experience positively perfect.  She makes a mean spicy margarita      We enjoyed the Tuna aguachile  the Pork Belly Memela  and the always-incredible bone marrow tacos.  Pretty sure the chefs here can do literally no wrong.  Can t wait to be back 
Comedor,182,Comedor  You can t have 12 ppl sit at the same table bc of Covid.  Us  Okay  what rule is that  And does it actually make any sense   Comedor  It s old city guidelines. We just follow guidelines.  Us   Okay  but it s not a guideline anymore  you said your policy is to follow guidelines  do you think you should allow it now   Comedor   We just haven t changed our policy yet.  Us  Okay   continues to have a 12 person dinner with 2 of our friends sitting at a completely different table and having to stand up to share food with them the whole time   Us   Hey server  does the kitchen follow the 6 ft separation and mask rule in the kitchen   Waiter    laughs  No.  Me   standing up getting ready to leave with no mask on.   Manager  You must wear a mask while standing up or you have to leave  Me  Okay I ll just sit down.   sits   Manager   No  you know what  you can actually leave.   points to door   Me   Why  I just sat down  you said I don t need a mask if I m sitting.  Dumbest policy in the world   Manager   Continues to tell me to leave  My party    walks out  and gives them a piece of our minds while the managers sat there with nothing to say.  I ve been here multiple times in the past and have had no issues.  This is how this particular night went.  Their policies are idiotic  I think they actually know that themselves  but they re too self-righteous to admit it.  Even with good tasting food they left a real bad taste in my mouth.
Comedor,183,WOW is all I can say. As someone visiting Austin from the NYC Boston area  which has spoiled me into a food snob   I wasn t expecting to be impressed by the restaurant scene here in Austin  but if this is an indicator of it  I would live here in a heartbeat.  During our first night in Austin  we realized we needed dinner reservations. It was Friday and we were booking last minute  so we got worried we wouldn t be able to find somewhere good and close by. An easy reservation  at a peak time   and a 10 minute walk  from most hotels  later  we arrived at Comedor. Granted  it was hard to find  but once inside  we felt like we were in the most hip industrial-type place ever. It reminded me of the most trendy NYC space ever...Comedor is a dark dim  sexy garage. The place was buzzing  and we got seated right away.   Two glasses of br t later  we started ordering. We weren t crazy hungry  but we ordered 2 fuerte plates and a smaller plate  plus dessert later. I was seriously impressed by the food. I had just come back from Mexico last week  and the menu has dishes with authentic Mexican ingredients  a modern twist on the classics.  We tried the goat tamal  octupus  and coulette  followed by tres leches. Everything was absolutely wonderful and I could not recommend everything enough. The goat tamal had wonderful mole sauces  and I loved the toasted leeks on the octopus. The coulette steak was perfectly medium rare and served with the most delicious corn tortillas which I assembled tacos with along with the incredible smoky-mole-esque sauce that came with the steak. Finishing with tres leches is a must- the combination of toasted merengue and ice cream made for the most exquisite texture flavor combination of tres leches I ve ever had.   Service was good  price to portion ratio was ok  but the space and food blew me away too much to consider these two things as the main indicator of my experience. I would highly recommend coming here for a trendy Mexican fusion dinner 
Comedor,184,Food and service was amazing     4 star instead of 5 because we showed up at 4 51pm for our 5pm Reservation and were told they don t open for another 10 minutes. So we went back outside in the heat and they locked the door until 5pm. If we didn t have a reservation  we would have gone somewhere else. The food was amazing  Just didn t appreciate the treatment for being 9 minutes early. Most places appreciate people being early for their reservations.
Comedor,185,The ambience and decor of this place is very cool. Drinks were solid but the food was just ok. Very surprised that they did not have good vegan options. Overall  feels like they ve tried too hard to be upscale but have missed the fundamentals of great Mexican food.
Comedor,186,One of my new favorite spots in Austin  Bone marrow tacos are unique and delicious  the sweet potato dish with the white chocolate sauce was also nicely done. I came here with my boyfriend during Covid season and it was easy to make a reservation. He liked the crudo the best and i thought it was really nice as well. I like how the drinks have the percent alcohol listed on the menu so you know how strong they are. Service was great as well  my only criticism is that the pork belly was a touch dry and I thought the dishes overall could ve been better without so much excess oil. I definitely plan to come back and try everything on the menu  though
Comedor,187,Wow. Gorgeous everything. Architecture  furnishing  tableware  and food are all lovely to look at. We had an amazing night  but I only give 4 stars because it s just not my kind of place. The Mexican cuisine is delicious and small plates make for a fun  leisurely evening. But when I want Mexican  I want the the not so fancy kind...chips  salsa  a spicy burrito and dirty margarita. More dive bar than architectural masterpiece. You can take the girl out of the neighborhood  but you can t take the neighborhood out of the girl... Sorry Comedor  I liked you and for a special night out you are perfect  but  as my brother would say  you re not my jam.
Comedor,188,I really want to do a 3.5 but Yelp is a fascist integer-only starred regime so 4 it is. Let s get some things out of the way  All of the cocktails were great. Standouts for us were the mole old fashioned  the martini  and the tequila carrot. No complaints there. Second  the soundproofing SUCKS. What is up with Austin restaurants with absolutely no consideration for soundproofing  Put all the money in the contemporary  minimal hard edges  and wood and metal and angles and glass but ignore your diners  comfort. The amount of chatter and noise we had to deal with during dinner almost ruined the experience. Third  the service was good  but they are still new and could be better. Food pacing was a really fast yet they made us wait  too long  for tortillas. But this will get better with time.  Upon first glance and taste this seems like an easy 5 star place but then you start looking and tasting closely at your dishes. Nothing was bad  and most things were very good  but I often found some of the most interesting ingredients hidden under other flavors  not showcased enough  or not necessary.   The tostada touting paddlefish roe and cured nopales was so full of guacamole that s all we could taste. Usually I wouldn t complain about this but we ordered it for the roe and nopal  it d be nice to taste it.   I was real excited to finally try huauzontle. The waiter mentioned they are trying to bring this green stateside. But they were bound together as fritters with so much batter they resembled a hush puppy and the huahuzontle were lost in the dish completely. When I asked a friend from D.F.she said their huauzontle fritters are just egg washed  breaded lightly and then fried  on stem. The fun of eating it are to place the stem between your teeth and pull and scrape the little florets off into your mouth. I feel like I still don t know what huauzontle tastes or looks like. Disappointment.   The famed bone marrow tacos desperately needed some salt. It d be nice to serve some sea salt table side for the diners to add as needed. The house-ground corn tortillas that come with this dish were great  but we specifically asked for 5 tortillas for our table of five  we were promised 5  and only 4 came out. We pointed out the error and one person had to wait patiently for their tortilla under fear that the marrow would turn cold. They finally brought out more tortillas to make the one taco my friend had been patiently waiting for and also charged us  4 for it we found out later     The squash blossoms in the quesadilla seemed lost  or scarce  but the hoja santa sealed outside the tortilla was nice.   The sorbet dish with ants sounded exciting because of the ants but then when I ate it I wasn t really sure why there are ants on them. There were like 3 of them  they added no flavor  just some crunch  but there were already crunchy sugar shells in the dish. This seemed unnecessary and a desperate attempt to be Noma. It might work better as a ground up  furikake with other spices like the cricket seasoning at Odd Duck.  Chocolate tamal was an oddly baseball shaped and sized lava cake  and definitely might disappoint some people as it is a masa base and just straight dark chocolate with very little sugar. You could smell the earthy unflavored masa which put some people off. The amaranth on the ice cream the waiters kept pointing out were non-existent once you tasted it. I think this dish could use some work.  No complaints about the other dishes like the pulpo  the beans and mushrooms with mexican dumplings   my fave   the goat tamal  and the pork memela. It seems they shine with these entree and protein dishes. The different salsas were all great accompaniments to their dishes too. Everything in general could use a little more salt. The desserts in general were ok  but I wasn t wowed or needed to have another bite. Have another drink for dessert instead.
Comedor,189,Courtney is a goddess and treated us like queens. Best server in the establishment. Come to Comedor if you want a good time  good food  and a beautifully secret experience that makes you feel like Cersei in the GOT.
Comedor,190,Wow  Incredible  electrifying  any words that shows excitement lol  I tend to  dislike  austin food bc im a bouchy Houstonian but Comedor was amazing.  For a short staycation to austin we got lucky and came for their covid19 reopening night.  The atmosphere speaks for itself and gives off a modern sleek look that invites a mood of a  good time to be had   We had several dishes starting off with the red fish tostada and the tuna ceviche  they had fancy names that i cant remember  both were a good size portion and very refreshing that wasnt overfilling to interfere with our main entrees  The highlight of the menu has to be their bone marrow tacos. Amazing-balls  food-gasmic. A must have. The bone marrow fattiness is complemented by the sauteed kale vege mixture that creates a heavenly melody of flavors in your mouth lol once you finish  the staff recommends to do the  luge  where you get a shot of mezcal and do a shot down the bone marrow  more fun then anything   We also had their sweet potato dish and their steak. Both very good dishes but definitely overshadowed by the bone marrow tacos.  The drink menu and cocktails is also impressive. We tried 4-5 different cocktails on their menu. A nice compliment of refreshing and intelligent drinks that welcomes different taste  Lastly the staff was awesome giving great recommendations and accommodating during this covid19 crisis
Comedor,191,Food is not that good and overpriced. I have had better fish tacos at Cabo Bob s for a fraction of the price. Definitely felt like they are trying to take advantage of a trendy atmosphere
Comedor,192,After a year  of take out and delivery  my wife and I decided to start dining in person  outdoors  at some of the places who had caught our eye. Comedor was top on that list and man was it a fantastic experience. Our server was great and walked us through the unique drinks and food they were offering making several suggestions. We went with most of what he said and everything was amazing. We particularly enjoyed the salsas that accompanied each dish. The dishes were outstanding without them  but once those salsas were added  it was ridiculous. We ll definitely be back there soon.
Comedor,193,One word- AMAZING  This is definitely a must try restaurant  Our waitress  Romie  made the experience over the top. She explained the menu in detail and just had a friendly and welcoming personality. We were kind of hesitant about trying the bone marrow tacos  but Romie highly recommended them. This was by bar our favorite dish in our Austin visit  As soon as you take the first bite  you get a mouthful of flavor. Do not go there without trying them  We will definitely be coming back to try other tasty dishes 
Comedor,194,Oh. My. God.   This place was perfect. I m not kidding. I ve eaten at more than a couple Michelin star restaurants and this place is definitely a contender. Every dish we ordered had perfectly balanced flavors and was cooked to perfection. The Comedor martini and michelada were great. Big eye tuna  goat barbacoa tamale  and chicken liver mousse churro were all fantastic. The bone marrow tacos were maybe the best thing I ve ever eaten. And the pork belly two ways was delightful. Did I mention the desserts    The tamal de chocolate and chamomile mousse were out of this world. Seriously  this meal was so good we had to personally thank the chef. I hope everyone gets to experience the joy of eating here.
Comedor,195,The food is good. The service was good. The lighting is horrible. It s dining in the freaking dark. Either turn up the lights a bit or and more candles on the tables. Not sure I would return.
Comedor,196,Wow  We had an amazing dinner and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Every dish was beautiful.   We like some spicy heat in our food and Comedor delivers  Many of the dishes come with a kick. I was especially happy with how tender the octopus was. Octopus can often be tough  but here it was soft and texturally pleasing.  The habanero ash emulsion is a showstopper. So good    I ve never seen a gray sauce like that before. Eating at Comedor is an adventure in food because of unique items like the habanero ash emulsion or ants on guava ice cream. Few other places in Austin are bringing these traditional flavors to the table.  I also want to give a nod to the architectural and engineering team for creating a comfortable atmosphere. The outdoor garden area is bathed in sunlight.   The comfort of home cooking paired with exciting twists was fun. Thanks 
Comedor,197,Found this place on the recommendation of a friend and was blown away. My mom and I had no idea what to order but luckily our waiter knew so much about the menu as well as the restaurant s history and style. We ordered the Bone Marrow tacos  avocado tostada  and ahi tuna watermelon with chili sauce starter that was my absolute favorite  despite not being able to remember the name . Everything was so great. Also extra-credit for all the safety protocols they put in place to ensure a clean and covid-free environment. Very impressed all around. Can t wait to try more things on the menu 
Comedor,198,So glad this place is open and serving. A nice outside patio. Good service. Amazing presentation of food. The food is artistic and made with fresh ingredients. Bone marrow was great  but my favorite was the halibut  sweet potato  chocolate mouse desert and the chamomile desert with guava sorbet. Those got eaten before we could even take a picture 
Comedor,199,Ok now this place is off the hook  Yelp only allows 5 Stars and I ve been to the best restaurants in the USA and finally I found a home  I love the Architectural Digest Interior BEST SPACE EVER  Le Bernadin eat your heart out   Per Se who Great service. Excellent knowledge of dishes. Best looking people in Austin. LA vibe with a little Miami coolness. I ll be coming back here Boca in Austin  This Pork chop is heaven sent. 6 STAR RESTAURANT 
Comedor,200,Overall  a very nice place for a fancy dinner. The atmosphere is really nice  with a cool indoor outdoor dining space  and service is impeccable. The menu was interesting with a list of tapas through larger main entrees. Here are items I recommend  Drinks  Desert Sage - not too sweet   Appetizer  yellowfin tuna aguachile - deliciously spicy and well balanced flavors   Main  Grouper fish tacos - may seem basic but came out hot and fresh and perfectly crispy   Dessert  Tamal de Chocolate - Amazing. If you re getting dessert you have to order this  It s just decadent enough without feeling like too much. The perfect end of meal treat.  The only reason I didn t make this review 5 stars was because I wasn t too thrilled with the tostadas or the meringue dessert.
Comedor,201,The food is delicious.  But  before I continue you must know that this is a Dining Experience versus going to a restaurant and I think that is important to know.  I did not know that going into this event with 4 friends.  It is very dark inside and we had to ask for votive candles on our table...like the other diners already had.  The waiter instructed us that the dishes are  made to be shared  and that the chef would send out the food in a specific order  I don t remember why .  First off  they may think the dishes are made to be shared  but a single quesadilla that we have to ask for a knife to cut into 5th is not.  Every dish  except the tacos required us to figure out how to split it up and didn t split by 5.  Also  we ordered exactly what the waiter told us to order as we had never been here and didn t want to over or under order.  The Tuna Aquachile was essentially a log of something in a broth so we had to each take a bite and pass the bowl around the table.  Very  intimate  with the food so thankfully we knew each other well.  Additionally  each of the 5 dishes we ordered came out one at a time  like many dining experience restaurants and the waiter stands there and explains everything about the dish .  Then they put  the dish on the table and each of us got a bite  sometimes two bites and we waited until the next dish arrived.  This happened four more times.  Each time  our conversation was interrupted to spend 3-4  minutes explaining how they prepared the food before we get another 2 bites.  By the time the Bone Marrow tacos arrived  I have to say I was done with the experience and I just wanted a dinner.  I ordered another glass of wine while my friends ordered 3 overly complicated desserts.  In summary  if you are looking for an evening with a friend to have a dining experience and the focus is on the food  and you aren t hungry starting the night   this is a good place to try.  If  on the other hand  you are a group of friends who want to share a good meal and catch up with one another and the restaurant is just a backdrop to the story this is absolutely NOT for you.  The constant interruption to explain the food  the food coming in forms that aren t really shareable  the 2 bites at a time dinner where we left hungry...well  this wasn t the right venue for our night.
Comedor,202,So I went in here with super high expectations given the hype around the place and prices of everything. Right off the bat the experience was horrible though. Nobody talked to us for the first like 10-15 minutes  kind of just danced around us and let us wonder what was going on. After our waiter finally came to our table I was convinced he might be the most clueless server in the house. Asked for recommendations and he gives us the classic  oh everything is good....  I put together an order though and sent it in. Past that the waiter had to be reminded to bring us each thing we ordered after waiting forever for each dish. Also they never would remove dirty dishes after we finished so the table just stacked up plates and the servers just moved them around each time and set stuff around it. Was so weird. Most of the food was god awful though. However the fish tacos were amazing. Quite literally the only thing that saves this from a one star restaurant. Would be willing to try again possibly but would need to be convinced and out of options for other food lol
Comedor,203,I ve not been to this restaurant a total of 5 times and have brought various friends with me. Each and every time  the food has been phenomenal  the service superb  and the atmosphere inviting. I am a pescatarian so I usually get the fish tacos  mushroom tacos  or some other dish of that nature. Every time  they have been spot on. My friends  who eat meat  have raved about how consistently great the food and service is. And then there were drinks. They have a full bar but the options on the menu are amazing. There is one currently on the menu that has a smokey flavor. Ask about it and get it. I ve never tasted anything like it but I will defensively be getting it next time. I would recommend going online to make a reservation because it does fill up fast.
Comedor,204,This place is incredible. My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary here last night and both of us were blown away. The restaurant itself is gorgeous  and the service is top notch. We got the smoked mackerel  octopus  amp  shrimp tostada to start  and the flavor was almost unbelievable. We then got the bone marrow tacos  which in my opinion is a requirement if you re coming here. One of the best dishes I ve ever had. Next we got the goat tamal and the quail  both of which were truly exceptional.   Comedor quickly made its way into my top 2 favorite restaurants in Austin. Do yourself a favor and check it out 
Comedor,205,I sat at the bar with a buddy and we basically told the bartenders to bring us good stuff.   Sorta like Hispanic omakasai.    What we got.... - fritters and ash emulsion - ok fritter  great sauce - yellowfin crudo dish with spicy watermelon sauce.  That was fantastic  - masa spaetzel - at first I thought it was just ok.  But I kept going back to it and really enjoying it.  - pork belly entree - it s huge and somehow it s crunchy and moist.   - we had a few cocktails - who knows what they were called... but all were good.    Bonus  They also have European style individual bathrooms instead of big bathrooms with stalls.
Comedor,206,It s expensive. Most of the dishes are small. Everything was amazing. Well  almost. The food and our waiter were. The hostess  she s got something up her butt. Idk why either. We asked for a table for 2. She said they didn t have any availability. I replied   that s ok  we ll wait.  Then  She mumbled something so I said   I m sorry  excuse me   And she blurted our   just give me a minute   I looked at my girlfriend and back at her and was like   you were talking to me.... but yeah  take your time.  It s 7pm. Another gentleman walked up and looked down and said   yeah we can seat you  as long as you can leave by 9pm.  I was like   YEAH  It s not going to take the two of us over two hours  Wait  how long does it take to cook your food    He laughed and responded with   some people like to linger.  The ambiance is great. All of it was a culinary experience. Very flavorful. It s a shame the hostess doesn t know how to be courteous.
Comedor,207,Impressive. Comedor is basically on par with ATX Cocina  but is more sophisticated nuanced refined than the latter. We came here on Monday night  first time  to celebrate our anniversary and left on a high note.  First of all  the space is beautiful  minimal but interesting and there s a great indoor-outdoor flow design. We opted to sit outside--where the space heaters actually work --but didn t love that certain speakers were directly blaring over our table. A nice touch that immediately cemented our good will was receiving two glasses of champagne and a  happy anniversary  card signed by the staff. Classy  Thank you  Well done  The three cocktails we had  Masa Old Fashioned  Granadela  and their margarita  were solid.  We started with the Avocado Tostada  the Smoked Tuna  Octopus  and Shrimp Tostada and the Market Salad. Both tostadas were perfect--each one was balanced in terms of texture and flavor. No complaints. The market salad didn t impress that much  but we weren t expecting anything special in trying to get some leaves in. It was fine with a healthy array of greens and mandoline ed roots...but whatever. For dinner  we shared the charred cabbage and their well-known bone marrow tacos. We love bone marrow  but somehow this version seemed a bit greasy  the butter     though the pecan germolata was an interesting take. Honestly  the best dish of the night was the cabbage. Sleeper hit  So good  Definitely came out charred as advertised and had a killer sauce with other accoutrements that made the whole dish Pop -Pop -Pop  in the mouth. Dessert was the tajin pavlova that was more fun and refreshing than anything else.  Service was a bit clunky at first as we were trying to figure out our seating  but improved throughout the meal. Restaurant pet peeve that Comedor excels at  large plates for small ish  portions meant to be shared on small tables. Ugh  why   In terms of value  the prices are sliggghtttllllly higher than they need to be  but we felt that the quality they were putting out extinguished any complaints. This is more 4.5 stars  but we re rounding up to 5 because there s such a dearth of Austin restaurants that actually deliver the goods.   Bottom line  One of the more impressive restaurants in Austin s glutted   high end  scene. We d recommend it and are excited to come back.
Comedor,208,OMG  The food is amazing and taste like authentic fine mexican cuisine. I was inlove with everything 
Comedor,209,Everything was amazing  I can t remember the last time I ve eaten that much. We had the avocado tostada  bone marrow tacos  birria tacos  whole fish  shrimp  amp  quesadilla. Everything was honestly amazing.
Comedor,210,Went for a friend s birthday  the service was pretty terrible. We had a reservation for 9 30pm and it took them 15 minutes to seat us  and even after they did sit us it took another 10 minutes for the waitress to come over. Some of the people at our table had some specific dietary restrictions and the waitress could barely be bothered to explain the ingredients in the dishes. Most of the party weren t native English speakers and when they asked about specific ingredients that they weren t familiar with the waitress was very rude and clearly thought that explaining the dishes was beneath her. Dishes were varying levels of spicy and there was no warning at all about the more spicy dishes  and none of the party were especially spice averse . The chocolate tamal desert was very savory  and while I personally liked it the waitress didn t think to mention that either  not to mention that she completely ignored our complaint about it . It really is a shame since the food and cocktails were pretty good  but there is no way we ll be coming back to a place that sells itself as an upscale eatery but treats it s customers like that. I can go get excellent food in other places.
Comedor,211,A true gem. Flavor profiles are out of this world. Some of the tastiest and most fun meals I ve ever had in my life have been at Comedor  The waitstaff and bartenders are brilliant and fun  and I couldn t recommend this place more 
Comedor,212,This is now one of my favorite places in Austin  we will definitely be back. Our experience at Comedor was great from start to finish  and I had high expectations going in . Presentation  textures  and flavors of the food were amazing. Great ambience and unique dishes. Juan our server was excellent and very knowledgeable  he made great recommendations.
Comedor,213,I felt ripped off at the end of my dinner.   Taco for over  20 each   I would pay that if it was good but it tasted awful and took for ever to come out   Drinks were also disappointing  the only thing that was nice was the bar but over all had a horrible experience.
Comedor,214,Patio is open  some seating inside is available.   They have sotol  which is nice  it s tough to find in commercial settings  and makes for a very good drink in conjunction with strong bitters and herbal notes  IMO.  Foodwise  I only had the  to-go  menu because my unwashed ass did not Make a Reservation. Next time  I will hack this by asking for to-go versions of the  mesa  menu  or by asking for a  mesa  order and then asking them to box that up. Free your mind. Four hour workweek.  The veggie torta is too spicy and leafy to make for good eating. Reconsider this entire dish  folx.  The cochinita pibil torta  however  can only be improved by making it two or three smaller tortas. It s too much samn dandwich  yall      Their avocado tostada  nopales in the guac is nice  but it s definitely not a standalone dish. Layering it with other flavors like pork crisp  chorizo  queso  something. I don t think to-go fried taco shells work  generally  they harden entirely too quickly.  The tres leches is  I suppose  their Crown Jewel  para llevar  the hint of lemon in the cream goop was nice  but the sugar dusting was a bridge too far  the gritty texture ruins my palate s immersion in super-rich and sweet cream flavors. It s also insane to treat this as a personal dessert. It s to be shared.  Not far from here is a shuttered bar  Handlebar  which bears a wooded window reading   DISPOSABLE BUSINESS.  We re living in the greatest mass delusion outside of Milagro del Sol and the tulip delusion of 1637. Good luck dealing with your broken families shattered over the Omega Hypothesis.   a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Ftwitter.com 2FEthicalSkeptic 2Fstatus 2F1300291498701971456 2Fphoto 2F1 amp s 154d933946cfd219189ede06ec385254bd62eb68b208b89e908416cc543f97e5  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  twitter.com EthicalSkept   a 
Comedor,215,High end Mexico City   Chocolate tamal  nuff said.  More than 50 different types of Mezcal    
Comedor,216,Awesome experience.  The restaurant was beautifully setup with an open air concept that flowed through the open roof on the interior patio. You fee secluded away from busy downtown Austin even though you re right in the middle of it.  The food and drinks are well thought out and everything obviously has purpose. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable about the food and drink menus. Seth was the best waiter I ve ever had  definitely ask for him .  The bone marrow tacos lived up to expectations. The bone marrow had a unique flavor that I m not sure could be replica
Comedor,217,Service and food - 5 stars    We had dinner here on a Saturday night with a group of six. Our waiter was great  so knowledgeable about the food - loved talking with him. I also loved that he recommended dishes well and I enjoyed all of our dishes. I started with the house margarita and it was perfect. My favorite dishes were the blue corn goat tamale and the heirloom beans with masa and Texas mushrooms  entree  was AMAZING  One of the most unique and delicious dishes I ve ever had. I also loved the blue corn tortillas  My dessert was delicious too - I had the yellow rice with Fredericksburg peaches. I don t remember what it was called exactly but it was so good.  I enjoyed everything about our experience -- the only thing that I didn t love was that the restaurant is really loud music is loud. We sat inside but there is a nice outside seating area and they have the ability to open up the glass wall so the whole restaurant is open and it s beautiful.
Comedor,218,Went here for dinner and brunch and was not disappointed  Think I actually preferred the brunch better. Our favorite part was the McPlancha- the most insanely large egg sandwich on a homemade English muffin with crispy hashbrown  tomato  cheese  avocado  and hot sauce. One of the best things I ve eaten in a while. Favorite things at dinner were the masa spaetzle  cochinita pibil  and the mushroom quesadilla. However everything we had was delicious.
Comedor,219,Holy sh t  This place is phenomenal. From the moment we walked through the door  we were amazed. The aesthetic is unreal. The food is unbelievable. The drinks  BOMB. The dessert was a little bit weird but honestly  the drinks hit us by that time  so my palate could ve been on par with a 5-year-old.
Comedor,220,My wife and I went here for the first time for our anniversary dinner recently. I was a bit skeptical it would live up to the hype  particularly since I am not a huge fan of other high-priced Mexican food restaurants in town that I won t name here.  I was blown away by the meal and the experience. If Michelin published a Texas restaurant guide  this would no doubt be a Michelin star restaurant.  I ll start with the service first - every single employee we encountered at the front of the house or the table wished us happy anniversary  and we received a complementary bottle of bubbly. Kudos to the staff  as we really appreciated that detail.  I should also mention the space itself is beautiful  particularly the large patio.  Now  let s go to the food and beverages. I was blown away by how great everything was. The comedor margarita was outstanding  as was the old fashioned with a mole bonded rye.  For the two of us  we ordered four small plates and one large plate. Each dish was spectacular and unique  and I would easily recommend all of them. We started with the heirloom tomato dish  then had the goat barbacoa tamal  huitlacoche and mushroom quesadilla  and bone marrow tacos  my personal favorite . We then had the peeler ranch coulotte  skirt steak  . The amount of food we ordered was perfect - we had a tiny bit of steak and a tortilla left  which we could have eaten had we not wanted to try the dessert. We chose the tamal de chocolate  which did not disappoint. Every dish had lovely and delicious Mexican flavors.  Though Comedor is on the pricier side  expect to pay about  100 per person   it was worth it. While our city may be known for its good eats  I don t think we have had a dining experience on this level. Go here  it has earned the hype it is receiving.
Comedor,221,Upscale  modern  interior Mexican cuisine that is the essence of real Mexican food. The building itself is a modern marvel with both indoor and outdoor seating. The food is exceptional. Based on yelp reviews we started big with the big eye tuna  the broccoli     and the carrots. Each was perfect. Had the octopus for the entree  excellent but the mole was only pretty good. Luckily we had saved the sauce from the tuna and the octopus was great with that  Don t let them take the leftover tuna sauce away   Great food  great ambience  great service.
Comedor,222,Incredible food. Excellent service. If you re coming to visit Austin  make sure you stop by for brunch or dinner at Comedor. We went for brunch and had the papas fritas  the pancakes and the memela. All visually appealing and incredibly delicious  I will definitely be back next time we are in the city.
Comedor,223,Dined on the patio  service was solid  ambiance was good. One of our appetizers  although great  was shockingly small. The other was the pork belly--it was all right. Both desserts were  in my view  underwhelming.  For our entree we ordered the bone marrow tacos. They were absolutely incredible. I will return  but mainly for this dish.
Comedor,224,This is a cool spot for business dinners or really special occasions but come with an open mind because the menu items can be out of the ordinary. They recommended 3-4 smaller plates and 2 main courses because portions are fairly small and they re meant to be shareable so it gets expensive fast. There were 5 of us. Not very many menu options. It s not the best place in Austin but overall a good experience.
Comedor,225,WOW Comedor. Flavor that is just out of this world   I was genuinely blown away by each dish  but the Sweet Potato Pav  is really something to write home about. Magnificent 
Comedor,226,Happy Hour until 6 30 on weekdays offering  8 cocktails and  9 wine.  4 dishes for  8 each including 2 types of cocktails and 2 types of aguachile.  Menu itself isn t too large but hits everything from vegetarian to seafood to meat.  Good bar but pricey  beer list about 10 bottles and 3 draft  but nothing rare or destination  and most at  8.  I came alone so opted to try a few sharable plates and a margarita.  Fine drink but at  8 on Happy Hour still pretty expensive.  The aguachile was a spicy soup but extremely fresh raw fish that reminded me of quality sashimi in line with some fo the best Japanese restaurants.  Interesting dish but not very sharable.  The bone marrow on the other hand was huge and perhaps the best dish I ve ever had in Austin.  Whether daring to eat alone or share  this dish was all around perfectly presented and extraordinarily tasty.  Weird to say  but this might actually be a hit for vegetarians as well with some great roasted kale and greens below the bone marrow that acted as a salad on its own.  5 fresh corn tortillas and 3 large bones that came garnished to give the marrow texture and more hardier taste.  Bone marrow tacos is a novelty I would love to see on other menus.    In all  prices are steeper  but you get what you pay for in quality of food as well as just ambiance of the spot.  Indoor and outdoor within the same hidden restaurant on Colorado.   10 valet or find parking somewhere along the street.  Might be closer to a 4.5  but that bone marrow truly blew me away and I am craving to order it again right this very second.  Definitely in my top 5 and probably higher of best things I ve eaten this year.  Great addition to the high end Mexican food scene branching out in Austin.
Comedor,227,Came here for a friend s birthday and service was amazing  They wrote and signed a card for her it was such a lovely surprise.   She had the taco tasting with the mezcal pairings. It s only available at the bar and you cant make any adjustments to the tacos offered so keep that in mind  The bartender was SO lovely. He explained all the mezcals and their tasting notes in an approachable way.   Can t recommend it enough for happy hour 
Comedor,228,The menu and food preparation here is good. I had a bad  and disrespectful experience with their staff. It seems that it is under new management.
Comedor,229,Pros  Stunning building and patio.  Cons  The 3 dishes and two drinks we ordered were unremarkable. The highly recommended pork belly was dry and flavorless. We ve eaten oodles of interior Mexican food and this place is not a standout. It s also so loud  At the end of the meal we wondered how the place got so much buzz. Must be the building. It d take a lot to get us back to Comedor.
Comedor,230,The place is very difficult to find  otherwise it looks great with an industrial modern look inside and out. The kids menu is very basic like quesadilla and no protein can be added. I can only guess that they re premade. All the plates for the table were small. They were more like individual portions. Ever share a one piece nigiri with someone  Its like that...I m exaggerating  but we didnt leave with full bellies. The main concern was that everything was overly seasoned and salted. My mother couldnt eat more than a bite of everything. Most of it did however have good presentation. Gotta work on the quesadilla plate though. If you put that little effort in the most important people in our lives  we aint coming back. Oh also  our arms were tired by the end of the night with shooing away flies. One last thing  have the hostess thank the guests as they re leaving instead of ignoring them us .
Comedor,231,I was leaning towards a 4 star  but that was not accurate. I d do 4.5 if it existed  but 5 it is   I was going to deduct a star for the high prices  and the fact they made me walk around trying to find the place for 3-4 minutes because it is not easily discovered on any map service  someone fix that   but then I thought those are not accurate reasons to take away a star for a place that has amazing food  great drink list  really cool vibe and design  and good service.   I d go back again and again for the Bone Marrow Tacos  and the Pork Belly.  If they added a few more items to the menu it would be nice  fix the mapping issues  then it deserves every bit of a 5 star.
Comedor,232,Comedor is an easy 5 star review for me.   They nailed the overall customer experience by A. setting a unique   memorable atmosphere  B. friendly and knowledge dining staff  and C. fun cocktail menu  and most importantly D. dahm good food   The only constructive feedback I have would be to refine their happy hour dining experience. I have had a couple awkward experiences  slow service  clunky bill splitting  trying to get service during happy hour.   Kudos to the relatively new Brunch setup. If you ve been and liked the dinner  I highly recommend the brunch. I personally think their pastry offerings are on par  maybe better  than the best I ve had in CDMX  ie Rosetta  and elsewhere in Mexico.
Comedor,233,Great ambiance  drinks and food. However the grand finale desserts killed the vibe. My group had a nice time at the restaurant but all agreed that the banana split at TCBY would make a much better dessert than any of the offerings at Comedor.
Comedor,234,We had the best experience for our anniversary dinner at Comedor. We had the margarita and a few Mexican martinis  fritters  bone marrow tacos  spatzle  double pork chop  tuna ceviche  and the Barbacoa tamal. The bone marrow tacos are the most popular and unique dish  but we would not order it again. It had wonderful flavor  but was entirely too rich for our taste  The spatzle was incredible  along with the barbacoa tamal. Our food came out in an incorrect order after a long wait  got the pork chop first  BUT the staff generously took care of us and made sure our experience was special. We will be back 
Comedor,235,Went here on a suggestion. When we arrived we didn t see the sign to get in but it is the black building and Comedor is written on the wall. Very chic place that had a cool vibe. Ordered the quesadilla that was very good and took a shot with the bone marrow tacos. The tacos were very savory. I could not finish the dish  heavy and rich  but tasty.
Comedor,236,I am very grossed out with this place and the way this situation that we experienced was handled. First things first the food was delicious and if this hadn t happened we would ve definitely came back but we saw THREE RATS right next to our table I freaked out and moved all the way to the other side of our table and I politely told the waiter there were some rats next to our table and he just said  I m so sorry about that  he then quickly came to get payment from us when we weren t even done eating. We obviously weren t going to finish because how do you eat with RATS next to you going up and down the building it was gross. When the waiter was taking payment acting like nothing one of the rats started moving and I know he saw it. I told him is this normal for you guys  And he said  I mean it s downtown Austin  I understand that but the thing is this place is not cheap they have  16 margaritas that are very crappy for them being that price I was expecting to be able to enjoy my meal with a good friend who was visiting from out of town. We were charged full price for our meal and the waiter left like nothing happened. I ve never had this happened to me so I honestly didn t even know how to react or what to say. Also  my husband is very private and a little too nice so he just didn t want to cause a scene and we didn t. But if you re thinking of eating here I d just go somewhere else.
Comedor,237,Wasn t sure if I would like the bone marrow tacos because of the texture but I m glad I ordered them. One of the best dishes I ve had in my life. 10 10.
Comedor,238,I was really excited about this place  and it did not disappoint   I made reservations months in advance and was pleasantly surprised to be seated in a large  back booth for me and my boyfriend to dine cozily.  The waiter was so knowledgeable and helpful with our food selections.  Many of the items are shared plates  and the main course items take a little while longer so make sure to order in advance.  The smoked tuna tostada was our least favorite -tasted like a bbq chopped taco.  The prices are reasonable for the amount of food and the flavors are fantastic   Definitely a must try for any foodie in Austin 
Comedor,239,I had an extremely uncomfortable experience. My server was great  so I went to make sure that s known. However  my server was more professional than the manger on duty. He was extremely condescending and uninviting. He should not interact with customers.
Comedor,240,I usually go to a restaurant at least a few times before I call it my favorite  but it only took one trip to Comedor to solidify it as my new favorite restaurant in Austin.   The menu is extremely creative. I ate things I don t even like and I loved them. You can t go wrong here. Just trust the chefs  because they re literally the among the best in Austin.   If I could give more stars  I would. I m an expressive eater  but this was a new level. I literally almost cried at one point in the meal  when I tried the pork belly   and throughout the meal I had to just stop and take it all in. The cocktails are incredible too.   It s pricey  but I left feeling like it would have been worth it to spend twice as much as I did. I will definitely be back for more.
Comedor,241,This spot was super cute and modern inside. Very inconspicuous place from the outside. The atmosphere  ambiance and music was on point. It is a tapas dinner spot and they do suggest you share everything family style  but we wanted to each get our own plate and then share a few other items. The only downside to our experience was our waitress. She seemed a bit pretentious and upset on how we ordered. I understand they prefer us to order a certain way but she was a bit rude on what and how we decided to order. We also got a cake for my sisters birthday and they wouldn t let us bring it in. Because covid  but still a little ridiculous. Anyways  we got quite a few dishes. My absolute favorite was the bone marrow tacos. It was delicious  All of the food was amazing and I don t think you could go wrong with anything you ordered. I got the agave guava mezcal drink. Super tasty and smooth  I would definitely recommend this spot for anyone wishing for a great food experience.
Comedor,242,Amazing dinner here recently. We ordered tuna  hominy  cauliflower  mussels and the rib eye. The tuna was savory and delicious in flavor with a pop of watermelon at the end. We would pass on the hominy and cauliflower when we go again  but glad we tried it. Mussels are sitting in a chorizo broth that brings just enough flavor into the dish. The rib eye was cut thin with a mole that brought depth to the dish. There are tortillas served alongside the dishes but we didn t feel the need for them. For dessert we ordered the chocolate dish but they had run out of it  so to accommodate us they brought two dishes we didn t know what they were. They were okay but nothing to remember. Overall fantastic 
Comedor,243,Not covid friendly outside. Tables are 2-3 feet apart  and we didn t feel comfortable eating outside. There was no way to maintain a safe 6 feet so we left without enjoying our reservation
Comedor,244,We re 20 minutes in and our ambassador  Nacole is emulating this place. Drinks are sublime  octopus is audacious and flavorful  and drinks are powerful and delectable.   The all steel structure is a chic  industrial design with glorious natural night.  Looking forward to coming again.
Comedor,245,A hidden gem with extremely tasty  and spicy  food  They take reservations and were very cautious with safety protocols which I appreciated.
Comedor,246,Very good. It might be the best restaurant downtown. Favorites for me were the aguachile  octopus  and the greens that came with the bone marrow tacos.  The cocktails were very tasty and obviously made with care. A little surprising  given the unimaginative descriptions on the menu. The wine and beer list seemed like an afterthought. I hope that changes.   Service was gracious with some missteps like an unordered dish arriving. They re very new  so hopefully they ll work out those kinks soon.   The space and lighting are urbane and current. It feels like you re not in Austin anymore. Very refreshing after so many restaurants opening with album-art murals and cursive neon signs. I do wonder how they ll keep the patio cool in the summer.   Go before it gets too popular.
Comedor,247,Incredible space  it is truly one of the most beautiful restaurants I have ever been to in Austin.   Food was OK  I think a lot of the kinks of the evening could be ironed out once they get into the groove  they ve only been open a couple of months so they might be just figuring everything out. These were  water not really being refilled  drink orders taking forever  any ordering period taking forever.   Food again  was OK  the bone marrow tacos were the best thing we had. A lot of what we ordered felt almost imbalanced  too spicy  not enough spicy  too oily. Everything was just a little... off. Not sure how to describe it.   That being said  I would definitely come back. Maybe for a client dinner  If you re looking to impress someone  this is definitely the place.
Comedor,248,Had the quail with mole here- perfect combination. Great atmosphere  music  and service. The wait staff was well versed on the menu for only having been open two weeks. Do yourself a favor and don t skip on dessert-- literally the best Tr s Leches cake I ve ever had.
Comedor,249,My sister and I stumbled upon Comedor on a business trip to Austin. We arrived with no reservation but were able to be seated on the outdoor patio right away. The restaurant  amp  patio are beautiful with a modern  sleek vibe.   The service was incredibly slow  possibly we caught the staff on an off night. The waiter did comp an item from the bill unprovoked to account for the delays  which was the right thing to do  amp  much appreciated.   We both had the Sherry cocktail to start  which was bright  amp  refreshing. As for food  we shared the bone marrow tacos  red snapper aguachile  goat barbacoa tamal  and shrimp  amp  smoked trout tostada.   Bone marrow tacos- This dish was far and away the most disappointing on the menu  although it is deemed a customer favorite. The bone marrow came out cold  amp  congealed  the kale under it cold  soggy  amp  under seasoned. The freshly made tortillas were overshadowed by the rich  texture-less fillings. The dish lacked acid  heat   amp  salt and cost more than a few bones.  Red snapper aguachile- This dish was just OK. The fish was fresh  amp  the aguachile had great heat from the habanero. However  the dish was served in an odd manner- a large bowl of aguachile served soup style  with 4 small pieces of snapper on the side. The dish looked cool but was not intuitive to eat. Confusing.   Goat barbacoa tamal- The favorite of the night. The goat  amp  masa were super tender  and the salsa made with chiles  amp  goat fat was unctuous  amp  spicy. We ended up using the tortillas from the bone marrow debacle to sop up the salsa  amp  avocado left over. Would order again.  Shrimp  amp  smoked trout tostada- Not really much to say about this one. The seafood was again fresh  amp  the tostada crunchy. The dish just lacked anything special. We were looking for it to be very acid forward  or present a bold flavor. It fell flat.   Comedor is a new restaurant  amp  has a ton of potential  however it is seemingly trying too hard. Potentially we caught it not on its best night. But  I ll always take bold flavors over flashy dishes. We are in Texas after all 
Comedor,250,Went for the first time this past Saturday on a date with my boyfriend. We always sit side by side because it s hard for me to hear at times and we find it easier to talk spend time together when we re not sitting across a large table. The hostess would NOT allow us to sit side-by-side at the high-top  even though over the next 2.5 hours  no one sat in the empty seat next to me. Additionally  there was a loud concert going on at Summit  the building attached to Comedor to the back  and so it was very loud inside Comedor with a booming bass. Thankfully my boyfriend made the decision to sit at the end of the high-top  catty corner to where I was sitting  so we were able to be somewhat close  otherwise i would have been yelling to him the entire dinner. Was very annoyed by this situation. The building is an indoor outdoor concept with high ceilings and a somewhat modern industrial look  but i didn t think the architecture was as jaw dropping as other reviews made it seem. The food was good  but they reused several ingredients over and over again  grilled cabbage  corn meal  so it felt like it we could have had more variety for the price we were paying. Our server was nice. Drinks took a very long time to come out. Overall  for the hype and price  I was expecting a little more.
Comedor,251,The ambiance is a little dark  but the food is quite tasty. The servers were very attentive but our food came out a bit too quickly. We felt a bit rushed. The snapper tostada and bone marrow tacos were delicious  We might go back when we are in Austin again  and we might not.
Comedor,252,They will probably not last past the pandemic with the poor attitudes of the staff. So  if you re dying to pay way too much for mediocre food you should go now before it s too late
Comedor,253,NOM NOM NOM. Definitely for the adventurous eater but hands down the best octopus I ve ever eaten  Incredible creativity with the dishes  above-average drinks and gorgeous ambiance. Was a hot July Saturday night but even outside  the fans kept us comfortable the whole meal. Don t believe the    rating on OpenTable  though....it s definitely expensive  but worth the price if you re a foodie looking for a sexy venue for date night 
Comedor,254,This place is a must   First off the restaurant is absolutely stunning. The atrium inside reminds me of Mexico City. Second the service was great I can t remember our server s name but she was a star  Then the food omg so delicious   I went two times while visiting Texas cause I wanted to try more on the menu. These pictures dont the restaurant justice but do yourself a favor and go here  
Comedor,255,The night started off a little rocky as the host staff seemed either very new  or not very creative when we showed up 25 min early for our reservation and were told we couldn t wait that short time at the restaurant s bar  Which had maybe 6-8 empty seats  There were 8 of us so a few hadn t heard that this wasn t encouraged and they ordered drinks from the very eager to help bartenders. Evan  one of the very capable management staff  saw this situation and jumped in  offered us a warm welcome and was able to change the course of our evening immediately. That s a true gift of being a solid hospitality manager and leader. Improvise and adapt.  After we sat  there wasn t a single thing we were fed that wasn t outstanding.  Service is a bit non-traditional as the plates are mainly sharable  but our man Caleb navigated an impromptu tasting menu for 8 people in a loud dining room with precision. And did I mention the food yet  Best food I ve had in Austin in a long time.
Comedor,256,I have heard amazing reviews about this place so I decided to go with my friend who I grew up with. Seth at the bar gave me the best foodie experience I can ever ask for. He knew his stuff and had an amazing personality. We started off with drinks. I didn t know where to start so I asked him for recommendations  he asked me questions about what I was in the mood for and then brought me this amazing spicy mezcal drink. I then asked him what he liked on the menu and I trusted what he said he liked. My tasted buds went for a ride. Started off with the Bone marrow tacos  the sweet and salty flavors combined so perfectly. He also made me a very refreshing cucumber drink. Then we had the agnolotti pasta. It was the perfect combination of cheesy corn and lime  I would of never thought those flavors would go so well with each other. Followed with the pork belly and masa. It s literally melts in your month. We ended with the chocolate tamale. Seth told us to pair it with Dessembers I believe it was called  it had very small notes of melon that went will with the bitterness of the chocolate tamale and the sweetness of the ice cream. Seth gave us an experience that I feel would be featured on chef s table. He is amazing and I m was very satisfied with his suggestions.
Comedor,257,Second time here- first time was almost 1 year ago. I would say the food is even better than I remembered. Cocktails are also excellent. Being Belgian I m a harsh critic and difficult to please. And I usually don t provide reviews  but this restaurant is so good that I needed to provide the 5 stars. We ate outside and the restaurant was really good in terms of social distancing. A true gem.
Comedor,258,Incredible meal  we absolutely loved every dish  amp  cocktail we tried   Elevated modern Mexican cuisine  executed to perfection. I m a huge fan of chef Gabe Erales.  It s tough to pick a favorite - but a few dishes you shouldn t miss out on are the Live Scallop Crudo  Smoked Mackerel  amp  Shrimp Tostada   Windy Hill Goat Barbacoa Tamal  Bone Marrow Tacos   amp  the Black Fin Tuna Aguachile.  For cocktails the Mezcal Cocktail  amp  Repo Ginger Habanero 
Comedor,259,One of my favorite restaurants in Austin. The decor  ambience  service  and food are all impeccable. I ll visit again and again  Perfect date night spot with low lighting  and they make a mean mezcal margarita. Catered to my veganism  and my meat eating friends rave over the bone marrow tacos.
Comedor,260,Will provide more details later but all the way around just an outstanding meal - the drinks were refreshing and creative  the food was excellent and the service could not have been better.  For a restaurant that only officially opened yesterday I was shocked at how well everything went - not a single hiccup   A special shout-out to the staff  especially our server Brittney  who made this evening be something beyond our expectations 
Comedor,261,Every single dish was unbelievable.  Comparable  if not in some ways better than the famed Pujol in Mexico City.  The dishes are a little less dressy and creative  pretentious  and I don t mean that in a pejorative way  than Pujol  more approachable  but every bit as tasteful and brilliant.
Comedor,262,This might be one of the best restaurants I ve ever eaten at. Both my husband and I traveled from Dallas and ate here twice. We had the manager wait on us one night and he was fantastic. Everything we have eaten here is outstanding. You have to try the quesadilla and my husband loved the bone marrow tacos. Highly highly recommend.
Comedor,263,Went with 10 people for a birthday party. Great scenery. Drinks were too sweet and food was mediocre. Most importantly though was that the service was very slow. I like spending extra for a nice night out  and I am accustomed to downtown restaurants being overpriced and generic  but this was particularly bad in terms of food  drinks  and service. Had the ambience not been so nice  it would have gotten 2 stars.
Comedor,264, 1 new restaurant in Texas in 2020 - lived up to its title  We made 5 30pm dinner reservations on Saturday night  and was very surprised to see the restaurant completely full by the time we arrived. Even bar was full with every seat taken. That s always a good sign. The entrance to the restaurant is very minimalistic - black wall  black doors  golden letters spelling Comedor. Absolutely loved it  made the place feel mystic and upscale. Once you are inside  the decor is amazing. They have a nice courtyard with vines growing on a red brick wall - cannot wait for warmer months and try it out for a date night. Indoor part has extremely high ceilings and top part is all glass  bringing light into the restaurant.  We ordered couple cocktails to try  even though we are more of wine people. We were not disappointed. Our waiter recommend to share 4-5 dishes  and so we did that. We licked our plates     Food was amazing  They have a nice variety of vegetarian options and meat eaters will not be disappointed as well. Flavors were strong and presentation superb  Waiter informed us that they change their menu quite often  so you can always try new things when visiting. We have been to Pujol   12 restaurant in the world in 2019   and so Comedor reminded us of it. So happy to have such an amazing restaurant right here in Austin   We are already planning our next visit.
Comedor,265,Only having a couple nights in the city  it was hard to narrow down dinner choices  but Comedor did not disappoint.   The staff was very friendly and accommodating  turning a good experience into a great one. Drinks-wise  the old fashioned was more impressive than the Oaxaca margarita. The appetizer of goat barbacoa was okay. For the entree  I wanted the Spanish Octopus  but they had run out for he night. The bartender recommend the Cochinita Pibil  which turned out to be much better than the barbacoa  but it was a lot of food.  I could have done with out the barbacoa in retrospect. Sitting at the bar made my solo dining experience un-awkward and even fun with a couple friendly and entertaining solo-dining cohorts.  One even shared her leftover corn tortillas with me which were also very good.
Comedor,266,I love this place.   I visited Austin twice in a week and a half - once for business   once for fun - and went here both times. The menu is perfect for sharing with friends and filled with amazing options. Everything is delicious  but definitely look to your server for suggestions  Not only was the food top notch  but cocktails were also wonderful.  The space is great and service is 5 stars. A meal at Comedor won t be cheap  but it will be worth it 
Comedor,267,The atmosphere was excellent.  We loved sitting in the courtyard.  Food was great as well.  Perfect date night.
Comedor,268,I m giving this place 1 star because the food and drinks were really good. However  the service and the rudeness of the staff were the worst I have ever experienced in Austin. We had reserved a table for 6 specifically for a business meeting which we told the reservationist beforehand that we needed space. They tried to jam us into a booth that could only fit 4 people. We asked if they could move us to a different table and they said  no  you can eat at the bar   this was at 5 p.m. and we were the only party at the restaurant. When we left the bar at 7 p.m  there were still 3 open tables with no guests. The manager and staff were extremely rude and inexperienced. Even though the food was good  you will be disappointed with the service and attention. They do not care about gaining support from repeat customers. They do not even have any signs that are visible from the street  which makes you wonder what s their purpose of operating this business.
Comedor,269,Worst food every...good drinks  but very expensive. Definitely not    This should be top dollar food but The fish was so disgustingly fishy. Not fresh at all.   Cool science but just for drinks.
Comedor,270,This restaurant is a little hidden and appears very dark from the outside  but inside is a beautiful bright space with a gorgeous courtyard garden patio.  The service was excellent and the food was very unique.  Of the 5 dishes we had  the yellowfin tuna in the chile melon broth was my favorite.  My husband liked the pork belly and the heirloom beans best.  The octopus made for a nice Instagram photo  but was a tad too rich for us. Oh and they have a lot of craft cocktails.  We had the Repo Ginger Habanero and it was divine.  This is going on our list for out-of-towners who think Mexican food is all tacos and quesadillas 
Comedor,271,Exemplary portrayal of Oaxaca flavor. From start to finish an incredible palletes of tastes textures and visual experiences. Having grown up on the other side of the border for a majority of my young adult life  I truly appreciate a break from the usual border fare.  The drink menu gets things started in a  a varied and tasteful way.  Thank you for bringing us such a gift to Austin.
Comedor,272,Amazing food and service. We stumbled upon this place by mistake and decided what the heck lets try this fancy mexican food.  Was skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised.  Food was incredible.  Wow wow wow  def a gem.
Comedor,273,Amazing food. We enjoyed every dish we ordered. The server and manager convinced me to leave the ants on the grilled radicchio because they told me it wouldn t be noticeable  but they were the biggest flying ant  butts  I ve ever seen. See the photos and judge for yourself. They re known for their bone marrow tacos and they did not disappoint. My husband was always been a little put off by bone marrow  but he tried this dish and loved it. There really isn t much flavor in the bone marrow itself so it s the toppings baked on top give it the amazing flavor. And if you have room left at the end of the meal  do yourself a favor and order the tres leches. You won t regret it.
Comedor,274,This restaurant gives ATX Cocina a run for its money  First time here and the atmosphere is great  lights are very dim  a candle is placed on each table  romantic vibes. The waiter was great  explained the bone marrow tacos to us which we couldn t resist  The cocktail list is all margaritas  I decided to have the jalape o cucumber one  which was refreshing and delicious. I love the glasses they use  the margaritas are a bit larger than expected because of the taller glass. The food was delicious  stayed till the restaurant closed. Will definitely be coming back  Have been raving about this place to everyone I know 
Comedor,275,Comedor is incredible across the board.  Great ambiance  cocktails  and food.  We ordered  nearly everything on the menu and it was nothing short of amazing.  Especially a big fan of the bone marrow tacos  Texas quail milanesa  pork farm chops  huauzontle fritters  and the chicken liver mousse with churros.   Please do yourself a favor and get the bone marrow tacos    We will be back.
Comedor,276,Easily one of the best meals and experiences the wife and I have ever had. As soon as I walked the host greeted us and make us feel welcomed. The building itself is gorgeous  truly wonderfully designed. Then we sat down and Seth greeted us and walked us through cocktails and drink. He also made sure he stayed within a budget  which I appreciated. The wine pairing was perfect and now I m on the search for the wine I had for my fridge. The food was amazing and I can not emphasize that enough but whats more the staff knew every single detail about it  almost as if they prepared it. The manager even stopped by to make sure everything was perfect  which it was. The most surprising thing was how clean the bathrooms were. Each is its own stall and stocked  and clean. I always say  if the bathroom is clean  the kitchen is clean. As far as the food goes  please don t be shy about doing a bone marrow mescal shot. Ask the bartenders. It messy but amazing. Also the vegetarian dishes were as good or even better than a few of main dishes  which were also amazing. I could go on and on. Cheers 
Comedor,277,Had the scallops  bone marrow tacos  steak and beans.  Absolutely delicious.  Beans were a surprise.  We sat at the bar and had Sal  he was great helping through the menu.
Comedor,278,The hype around this restaurant was very high  so I went in with high hopes and expectations.  I found it very underwhelming with the exception of the broccoli tamal  which was very good.  Everything else we tried  around 10 dishes  was over engineered and underwhelming.  Oddities like corn nuts in the masa and over seasoned and over battered octopus.  They rely on mole in several dishes and I was not impressed by the mole at all at Comedor.  The gold standard of Mexican cuisine in Austin is Fonda San Miguel and it s crown is safe.
Comedor,279,This was probably hands down the worst twist on Mexican food I ve ever experienced.  The dishes were just NOT  good - no other way to describe it.  Hoping the chef was just having an off night but we won t be back 
Comedor,280,The ambiance is super cute. Dimly lit with good music. The food was flavorful and different.
Comedor,281,There s not much to say because you really just have to go. It s a ridiculously beautiful space  kudos Olson Kundig  serving delicious food. Drinks were amazing  too.
Comedor,282,Had a great meal at Comedor. Would give 5 stars but we were given old menus and ordered like 2 things that were no longer available  got new menus 10 minutes in. Highlights were scallop crudo  tuna aguichile  fritters  and seafood tostada.
Comedor,283,Best in town. I fell in love for the seafood tostadas  my fianc  loves their bone marrow taco. I am happy they haven t changed too much their menu. Everything they serve is very tasty   from start to finish. Special mention for their desserts  always very attractive visually and always delicious.
Comedor,284,Been here twice now and love the place. The food is really fancy and not anywhere close to what you imagine when you think Mexican. This would be great for a special occasion though. Be prepared to order many plates. They are very small portions  but amazingly executed. They have a liver patt  churro and it very unexacting  but a fun spin to foie gras. We also got tocos that we re garnished with seasoned crickets  You could say its an adventurous menu. Besides the food the ambiance is beautiful. The architecture is very pulled back and celebrates the materials. All in all it is a very enjoyable restaurant 
Comedor,285,HUGE fan of the beautiful space. Drinks on the patio in the evening is divine  I tried many of the menu favorites and must say the pork chop was the best plate on the menu. Keep it coming team Comedor  can t wait to return.
Comedor,286,The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Illy companion and I offered six dishes. We loved five of the six dishes we ordered -- the exception being the goal tamal  which was short on goat relative to the tamal.
Comedor,287,I went there for my birthday recently after hearing so much about this restaurant. We made a reservation  but we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table. They did have a lovely birthday card signed by everyone  which was a nice touch  but I honestly wasn t impressed with the food. The appetizers are labeled as  para la Mesa   which means  for the table  in Spanish  and one of the items we ordered was a tostada  and it was just one  one  How are you supposed to share that with the table  Our entrees were full of flavor and I was surprised by how big the portions were  but they needed more. Both entrees we ordered  the octopus and the porkchop  were all that was on the plate. It was just a plate with meat  I was hoping for some greens or starches  especially since the meal was pretty spicy. The ambiance and elegance of the place was definitely there  but I won t be returning for the food.
Comedor,288,Get the tres leches desert  Omg so good  This place is great for a date night. It s dark and romantic. Restaurants these days are so noisy  but we sat outside and it was quiet. I loved the ambiance. The food was excellent too. We weren t all that hungry so we got the corn  the tomato and one other dish plus the desert and we liked everything but the desert was amazing 
Comedor,289,One of the best meals of my life   We had an amazing time with a fully curated experience by our waiter  Mark  who made this the best meal ever    We got the tomato aguachile thing  so fresh and bright  bone marrow tacos  which is a full last meal dish   big eye tuna - which was like butter it was so fresh  spaetzle with more corn than I could imagine and such big taste  goat tamales with goat fat salsa  the chicken liver mousse  which was just divine  and the Chocolate Tamal. EVERYTHING WAS SO STUPID GOOD. I at the end was just so blown away that I lost track of time and was in a complete trance.  I was to go back every month to try whatever is new  and I want to sit in wherever Mark section is because  he just elevated the whole experience 
Comedor,290,Spectacular service and amazing interior cuisine  My wife is Plant Based and Gluten Free  they were incredibly accommodating.
Comedor,291,Everything is exquisitely well thought out. First  I appreciate the service  presentation and materials of the tables glasses tableware  granite floors  patio and high ceilings. Then the food - I appreciated the choice of rare raw ingredients and Oaxacan history just as much as the taste  which combines complex flavors with everything I love about Mexican food. It was unique yet familiar. To top it off  we were celebrating a friend s birthday and the staff not only wrote my friend a birthday card but brought 3-4 complimentary dishes for us to celebrate with. We also celebrated with memorable bone marrow mezcal luge shots - so smooth and savory   It was an extremely generous and loving vibe while being upscale - it currently wins as my favorite restaurant in Texas
Comedor,292,The restaurant is beautiful  staff is very attentive and nice  These are very small shareable plates  but I don t really see how they re shareable for a big party of people. It s great for 3-4 people max  a few items are underwhelming for the price  I m glad I tried it but not really excited to go back.
Comedor,293,Overpriced and Under delivers.  Went there for a special holiday meal. Great expectations based on word-of-mouth and reviews. Net Net - disappointed.  The building is nice and the design is elegant. The food was presented well - but the darkness of the restaurant made it hard to appreciate the colors of the food. The  teams  of servers did make the food delivery go well.  However  the server waxed eloquent on the building more than the food. After we explained our food allergies  the first dish he recommends we could not eat. Told us one dish was not spicy - it arrived at a spice level my wife could not eat. His recommendations sounded like canned patter - not considered consultation based on our input.  While we expected to spend a bit - the tab of   100 per person  WITHOUT drinks  was over-the-top for the food offered. And  we felt nickel-and-dimed by a  10 valet charge AND a  health care  added line item on the check.  SO  it is just not worth it. For the money  we were disappointed. Uchiko is so much more worth it - we are consistently pleased with that experience even after several years of dining there.  Suerte is better and a far-better price performer.  Net Net - worth a trip just to experience what people are talking about. But we won t be back.
Comedor,294,Worth the hype. The restaurant is beautiful and service was so helpful. We had four people and we got  - Yellowfin Tuna Aguachile  must get  tuna was so fresh and the flavor was unique and spicy. My only complaint is I wish there was a bigger portion. - Bone Marrow Tacos  every review says this but they are right. This was one of the best bites I ve had in my life. We kept the sauce from the yellow tuna and added it to our tacos and it was great. We also did mezcal shots down the bones which was a fun experience. You won t regret ordering these. - Tomato Aquachile  so refreshing. Wasn t the most unique dish we had that night but I m really glad we got it. Simple and flavorful. - Emery Bay Halibut with Coconut Veracruzana  the halibut was cooked absolutely perfectly. It was a great dish but the sauce was a little too rich for our preference.  - Pork Belly Memela  Cochinita Pibil  amazing flavor with a HUGE portion. Don t get as just an entree for one person. The sauce on the side was our favorite. My only regret on this dish was not ordering extra tortillas to make tacos because the corn bottom was too hard to cut through.   Overall  we loved every dish. If I went again  I d probably still order the two aguachiles and bone marrow and maybe try new entrees. Also the Comedor Margarita was awesome and with the right amount of spice and you must try to Repo Ginger just for its unique flavor.
Comedor,295,Honestly my second yelp review but I was so thoroughly disappointed with the dinner. Two stars only because the ambiance is super cute both inside and on the patio and the service was super nice and super quick. BUT the food and drinks were both not up to par for traditional Mexican food  I really prefer Suerte or even Licha s tenfold. I ve lived in Austin the last 6 years  amp  get super excited whenever a new authentic Mexican place opens. The seafood tostado was good  but the mackerel tostada I couldn t even eat because the fish was sooo fishy  the quesadilla was about the same as my drunk quesadillas I make at home  but the spicy sauce was good   and the fish tacos... I mean jeez. The fried fish tacos tasted something like what I would imagine the fried fish fillet tastes like from McDonalds  being a bit dramatic but still mad I paid  30 for something I could make better at home from Trader Joe s .  amp  the drinks weren t the best.... Hope they get a little better  maybe we went on a bad menu night  I heard the mole was great but wasn t on any of the menu options.
Comedor,296,I reserved a high-top table a week in advanced for myself and two friends  and when we came in for our reservation we were told that we reserved a seat at the bar. When we told them we reserved a high-top we were told that we called them the day before and switched our reservation to the bar. When we confirmed that we had not called  as we were flying to Austin and couldn t have called  we were then told that it was a mistake and they didn t have any other seating available so the bar was the best they could do. We would have been happy to sit at the bar if they had asked us if that was okay but the fact that we were told we had called and changed our reservation was very unprofessional. No apology was issued and the manager came and told us the best they could do was send us some free food. We of course were gracious to have a seat but our  compensation  was a mediocre salad. That being said  the food we ordered was good and our bartender server Brandy was kind. However  the fact that we were the only non white people in the entire building as well as the fact that we were the only people under the age of 30 in the building  and we were the only people who seemed to be forced to change our reservation  is disappointing. We would have been happy to accommodate if we had been asked or notified but the lack of communication and general mannerisms were very rude. If you are young and or not white  I would not recommend this establishment. There are surely better places in Austin to spend your money. The overall experience was underwhelming and honestly subpar  but if you are simply looking for a decent food and service you can find it elsewhere.
Comedor,297,Clearly in the minority here  but I really cannot understand the hype behind this restaurant. For it to be listed in Esquire magazine as one of the top 20 new restaurants in the country for 2019  I was expecting to be blown away by the food  cocktails  and ambience. Well  that wasn t the case.   Of the four dishes I tried  huauzontle fritters  barbacoa  pork belly entree  and steak entree   I wasn t particularly impressed with any of them and wouldn t order them again. The highly recommended pork belly dish in particular was just not hitting - dry  chewy  and the flavors of the dish just didn t seem to compliment the meat. I didn t even finish it  which is saying something considering my reputation for cleaning my plate. The other dishes were better but  again  I found them kind of bland and forgettable. Don t get me wrong - I love interior Mexican cuisine - but this was just not a version that I found interesting or appealing. The margarita and other cocktails were  fine  but nothing memorable.   The ambience was very nice  albeit  definitely not Austin-y  and the service was friendly  but  given the high price point and the mediocre dishes  I wouldn t come back.
Comedor,298,One of the best meals I ve ever experienced....  Sat at the bar with Seth as my bartender and tour guide extraordinare   Started with the mezcal amaro  which is a strong starting point for someone whose go to drink is a rye Manhattan.  Ordered the heirloom tomato aguachile.  This was a great start.   Followed that with the seared tuna aguachile.  Amazing combo of flavors and an appropriate kick from the chiles used.  You ll want to save the broth as a nice dip for future courses.  Seth then  prepared for me an off menu grapefruit and reposado cocktail which was fantastic.  He then suggested the seafood tostada which was an amazing mixture of smoked salmon  octopus and shrimp on a small house made tostada shell.  Amazing   I left it up to Seth to set up the final course.  I asked for something light.  He said his favorite dish on the menu was the carrots  yes  really carrots .  He then invented a reposado cocktail in front of me to pair with the dish and suggested tortillas to soak up the previously mentioned broth.  Wow   Next time I m in town  I m going to find Seth and just ask him to set up my food and drink menu.  I m sold     Thanks Seth and everyone at Comedor.
Comedor,299,Ruined my birthday. Reservation at 8 00pm really means  wait in the corner indefinitely until the people at your table leave .  Total attitude at host stand. It s Austin. Not NY. Will not go back. Done. So many other amazing choices in AUSTIN.
Comedor,300,Hole in the wall place. You walk in and really taken back. Great atmosphere with great outdoor area. Very well design with amazing food and drinks
Comedor,301,Wait  people like this place  Cool atmosphere but that was it. First  it s hard to find and doesn t look open The waiter was rude when we asked questions about the menu  the prices are outrages  I mean insane outrages  the waiter did recommend the quesadilla  it was weird made with fungus  my friend hated it and my stomach hurts the day after. The waiter also told us some of the things on the menu take an hour to cook. Then my glass broke because they use thin glass and spilled everywhere. Ohh and did I mention the healthcare surcharge  what bull  This is one of the fake ritzy fufu places that will close down in a few years
Comedor,302,Amazing food  Takeout menu is smaller than regular menu but I understand certain food doesn t travel well. Really great tortillas  Will definitely be back 
Comedor,303,Came for brunch today..had the pancakes  fish tacos  masa barbacoa  mimosa and michelada. OMG  So amazing that we have already booked our return visit. Seriously ya ll..that good  Yeah  yeah I have a mimosa buzz right now BUT super GOOD 
Comedor,304,This place is way over hyped and over priced. The food is good but there are way better options in Austin.  17 for the quesadillas is a joke - it s a tortilla with cheese and 4 mushrooms. Aguachile is a pass - would not order again. The way to go is definitely the tostadas at happy hour. Bone marrow tacos are relatively small  but good flavor - again there are way better dishes in Austin for price point. Ambiance is cool and nice set up but trying to be something that is not Austin.
Comedor,305,Expensive  small plates  Be aware if you are hungry you will spend a lot of money    The patio is gorgeous and the drinks are good.
Comedor,306,Spectacular     Ordered the Quesadilla  Yellowfin Tuna Aguachile  amp  Cochinita Pibil Memela. Truly the best Mexican Restaurant in Austin. I am from Mexico City and Comedor is at Pujol s level Congrats to the Chefs
Comedor,307,Lovely in every way possible. The food is fantastic. The service is great. The atmosphere is sublime. Thank you Comedor.
Comedor,308,Comedor has a soft opening for their new brunch service today and Chef Speer graciously invited my son in law and family  me  too  and what a delight it was   We shared carnitas tacos  waffles with frog jam and fresh figs  eggplant quesadilla  and a few other dishes  the names of which I ve forgotten... everything is plated beautifully  and the plates are gorgeous  btw  and the flavors are spot on perfect   Our Damiana mimosa was yummy as were the Bloody Mary  Paloma and Michelada...a boozy brunch it was and nothing wrong with that  The space is gorgeous and I m looking forward to cooler weather when dining in the courtyard will be so enjoyable 
Comedor,309,If I could give this place a lower score on Yelp I would. Totally rude  inexperienced hostesses who refused to even allow us to go into the bar and have a drink standing. In fact they didn t even want us to walk into the restaurant at all. We were well dressed for a Friday evening  coming from red Ash actually.   I don t know what the food is like and quite frankly  I really don t care. We will not be back to this pseudo-trendy pretentious place.
Comedor,310,Seriously  the bone marrow tacos may be the absolute BEST tacos I ve ever eaten  They were DIVINE  The atmosphere was perfect  waitress was great   amp  drinks were SO yummy  Highly recommend. Cant wait to trry the 5 course Happy Hour 
Comedor,311,Wow  outstanding restaurant. We came for brunch having read about it on Eater. Michael  our server  was helpful and very nice.   I never thought I d order a quesadilla for brunch but I m so glad i did. Delicious - especially the salsa on the side. The dish had a kick so a Bloody Mary or michelada is a must. The corn tortillas which are made on site are different than any corn tortilla I ve ever had - so good.   To top it off the space is beautiful. I wish it was a little warmer today because i would have loved to enjoy the outdoor space.
Comedor,312,Great atmosphere and tasty food. Unassuming entrance but what a lovely space when you come inside  We loved the bone marrow tacos. I could had just that for dinner.
Comedor,313,I got to go to a soft opening of Comedor before they opened and it was UNBELIEVABLE. I had the Bone Marrow Tacos  Huauzontle Fritters with Habe ero Ash Emulsion  Gem Salad w  Hoja Santa Vinaigrette and Avocado  Chicken Liver Mousse and Savory Churro  Amberjack with Greens and Onions in a Mole Verde  Guava Sorbet w  Chamomile Crema Mezcal Foam and Chicatanas  ants   Molten Chocolate and Caramel Ice Milk  and 2 other desserts I can t remember. The cocktail game was strong too. Had their Pineapple Mezcal cocktail and a Sherry Cocktail which had jalepe o  cucumber  and tequila. It was seriously mind-blowing. Oh and the ambiance is super cool. They have an open air courtyard next to a high ceiling main dining area that plays with natural light using huge windows up high and glass bricks down low. HIGHLY recommend going here 
Comedor,314,TLDR  The next big thing in Austin dining. Strong connections to traditional Oaxacan ingredients and dishes blended with modern techniques and interpretations.   Pros  Breath of fresh air for Austin fine dining AND Mexican food.  The whole menu is great but... Bone Marrow Tacos  good app for sharing   ANY mole dish  Pork Chop and Mole Negro wow   Seafood Tostada  Thomas Kundig designed building that will take your breath away.  One of the best house martinis I ve ever had   Cons  Didn t LOVE the preparation on the chicken liver mouse last time I went.  There are very few  whether you live in Austin or are visiting  just go.
Comedor,315,The food is amazing  I love the bone marrow tacos   Great wine and cocktail selection. My server was extremely professional...we were full from some of the appetizers and she ask if there was a problem with our main dishes since got about half way through them  we replied no everything was great  But the fact that she ask meant a lot  We had the manager and I think the sommelier    come by and check on us as well. I m kicking myself because can t remember her name  but we had a great dining experience.
Comedor,316,Amazing bone marrow tacos. Delicious cocktails. Exceptional service. Got seated on the patio and it was pretty hot but we cooled off with some great drinks and had a wonderful time.
Comedor,317,Had been looking forward to trying this place since it opened  and I decided to take my fianc  here for his birthday. Hosts were not the friendliest  but servers were very knowledgeable. The ambiance and architecture are beautiful   The cocktail I ordered was amazing  Great use of tamarind  although the mezcal margarita was not anything extraordinary. I was a bit disappointed with the food  as it was spicier than I expected and it took 40 minutes to get a dish. If you re looking for authentic Mexican food  I would recommend Suerte or Fonda San Miguel instead. Also  don t expect anything special like you would at Uchi for a birthday. Overall  I would say Comedor did not live up to the hype.
Comedor,318,I had this on the list but wasn t sure enough to make a reservation  but every server we spoke to while in Austin confirmed that it s a must try so we made a last minute reservation. We ended up sitting at the bar and I think our experience was actually better than if we were to have a table. In large part to Seth who was an amazing bartender and Nacole  our server  was just as awesome. We ordered the beat and carrot tostada  spaghetti squash tamale  purple corn quesadilla  scallop crudo  yellow tail and the halibut. All of the food was super fresh and tasted like gold. We split everything and it was almost too much food  but we were glad that we tried it all. A definite highlight in our trip 
Comedor,319,Great vibe  had just returned from vacation in Tulum and felt like I was right back there. There was a lengthy wait  table for 6  but after 10 minutes we were able to get an entire high top and the bar to ourselves. Drinks were great  service on point  highly recommend the bone marrow and quesadilla 
Comedor,320,The atmosphere is amazing.  It has a  wow  factor that is unrivaled with any other restaurant downtown.  The food is just as spectacular.  I encourage you to try several things to fully appreciate the Comedor experience and all it has to offer.
Comedor,321,Maybe my expectations for Comedor were too high.  Overall I feel like their spin on modern Mexican is just average and overpriced.  Don t get me wrong the bone marrow tacos were tasty but the other 5 dishes we ordered were nothing special.  The octopus especially was lack luster  great mole but chewy.  So many great options in Austin  Comedor did not live up to the hype.
Comedor,322,I love interior Mexican food  so I was extremely excited when Comedor opened and anxious to make a first of what would be many visits.  Am I disappointed.  I guess I will continue to eat interior Mexican at La Condesa  La Fonda San Miguel or El Alma  three of Austin s long standing restaurants with excellent and creative cuisine  albeit in less attractive spaces.    First of all  to build a new  free-standing restaurant isn t an inexpensive undertaking in any city.  Especially one such as this with a drop-dead  stunningly gorgeous interior.  I applaud the architect and owners for creating this visually beautiful space.  However  the choices of materials results in an interior space that is LOUD and noisy  so forget enjoying a comfortable dining experience.  The place is more suitable to have drinks at the bar  if you enjoy expensive cocktails  with friends  and people watch for about an hour.  But forget about staying for an entire meal. It s a painful experience unless you are part of a large  loud group where conversation is shouting over the person seated next to you.    Second  the dishes we tried were pretty to look at but uneven in taste and appeal-- some very good  others very disappointing.  I think this is a kitchen staff who try too hard to produce creative  visually beautiful food  often resulting in dishes that lose their central focus resulting in a quagmire of ingredients that look pretty but don t necessarily taste wonderful when paired together.   Third  the price.  This place is for millenials with trust funds and limitless credit cards who don t care about anything other than being seen at the trendiest spot in town.  For diners who actually care about value and taste when eating out  there are better restaurants to go to for interior Mexican  mentioned above  although La Condesa is just slightly less expensive.  Two of the least expensive appetizers on the current menu are Grilled Carrots  Creamer Peas  Fermented Chile  Masa Miso  14  and Masa Spaetzel  Esquites  Burnt Corn Husk  13.   For the main courses  Halibut a la Plancha  Mole Verde  Turnip  Fennel is priced at  34. A double-cut pork chop is  48. There are a few main courses priced at  26 and above which is about par for any decent restaurant in town these days.    So here is a thoughthow about offering a limited pre-fix  pre-theatre early bird dining menu from 5 00pm to 7 00pm  before the noisy crowds  for those who want to try the food but at a more reasonable price  I suspect there is a large segment of our population who will take advantage of such an offer.
Comedor,323,From start to finish  best meal I ve had in Austin in a long  long time.  Beautiful space. Creative cocktails. Delicious food. Attentive staff.  There were six of us and we had damn near everything on the menu.  Some unreal dishes.  And I can t remember a single misfire.  Total home run.
Comedor,324,Comedor is a fantastic modern Mexican restaurant. We made the mistake of over ordering as the plates were a little larger than expected but the food was equally as good for leftovers. The Strawberry Mezcal cocktail was on point. I was not super impressed with the Oaxaca marg but could just be a preference thing. The steal with mole was cooked to perfection and same for the squash tamale.   The ambiance is also great as the place is very modern and unique. I will definitely be coming back here 
Comedor,325,This restaurant is hands down the nicest finished out restaurant and decorated place in town. The service and food match but my only hope is that it never goes downhill because they re right at perfection rn
Comedor,326,The whole esthetic from the plates to the staff s uniforms are absolutely incredible. An amazing experience.
Comedor,327,There are so many excellent things to say about this restaurant that I will never be able to cover it all in one review. We sat at the bar and had the most incredible staff waiting on us. Seth  the artist  he s a true artist at his craft  made the best drinks but also had the best and biggest personality and educated us in the history and very interesting facts about ingredients and just everything really. Our other artist  Nacole  was so attentive and made me a cocktail which was not on the menu but exactly what I wanted. From the very beginning these people made the experience beyond great. We ordered a lot of appetizers and every single ingredient was so fresh and pure. You could taste everything individually and the way it came together. We also ordered one entree  the halibut  and shared it. It was out of this world. The green sauce was light but so delicious. I feel like I want these flavors to stay with me forever. This is the highlight and star of this trip to Austin. This is how all restaurants should approach service and the whole experience aspect. Seth was really something special and should get a five gold stars.
Comedor,328,Amazing authentic Mexican food  Great service and atmosphere. Unique cocktails as well. If you are looking for a unique Austin restaurant  this is your place 
Comedor,329,Austin  be prepared...Comedor will exceed your highest expectations  Refined and downright sexy from its romantic  candlelit courtyard to the desserts that will definitely leave you wanting more  My husband loved LOVED the bone marrow tacos and the Rosewoods Farms 12oz Strip  and I  the pescatarian in the family  was THRILLED with the Huauzontle  fritters and amberjack   Fluke  with mole verde. The wait staff was friendly and spot on with their recommendations and we even got a warm welcome from owner William Ball and executive chef Philip Speer. We can t wait to go back 
Comedor,330,EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. The ambiance  the food  the service  EVERYTHING. The dessert  GTFO.  Perfect balance of sweet and savory.  My biggest regret  Not ordering the marrow bone tacos...the table next to me ordered them  and I literally thought about just going up to them and asking if I could try some...but I didn t because that would just be weird and awkward.  Soooo...I guess next time I will just go and order them myself like a big girl. Oh  and the mezcal.....dear god  so many choices...if I had that Rockefeller money  your girl would be swimming in it.  Just go.
Comedor,331,Food is really good  loved the service  could do without forcing us to pay for their employee benefits. Separate charge for your employee benefits politicizes an otherwise wonderful dining experience. Lots of choices to dine in Austin  explore 
Comedor,332,Still unbelievable. Menu changes weekly based on freshest ingredients. The entire staff is thoughtful and caring and committed. Definitely at the top of Austin restaurants.
Comedor,333,Wonderful food but if it starts to rain  do not expect them to honor your reservation time even though they have texted you a half hour in advance to make sure you are on time.  My advice is simply cancel and go across the street to Lonesome Dove.  If it starts to rain  they move their outdoor guests inside and you will be delayed 45 minutes to an hour without notice.  Their hostesses are clueless and they seat recently arriving parties before you.  Food deserves four stars  too much sugar  but mechanics of seating suck
Comedor,334,When you step back and think that you had 3 teaspoons of bone marrow  some kale  a bit of corn and 4 beers for 120  you have to reevaluate what you are actually getting for the money.  It s not bad  but it s just not worth the asking price.
Comedor,335,We visited Comedor about a week after the restaurant opened. I had such high hopes for this restaurant....  However  the food and service were very subpar. The building is absolutely gorgeous though and I could see ya coming back to meet friends for a cocktail in the open air courtyard.
Comedor,336,Great vibes  food  and cocktails. My husband and I went recently and tried lots from the menu. I ll admit  I m not one who is great about venturing far from my usual comfortable palate... but I felt like Comedor did a great job at mixing otherwise unconventional dishes and Mexican cuisines in a very approachable  and delicious  way. We ended our meal with whatever chocolate choice was on the dessert menu and it was amazing. We will be back.
Comedor,337,This might be one of the best restaurants we have discovered in Austin. Comedor seems to have captured the essence of the new vibe of modern Austin. It has an intimate but energetic ambiance   maybe the best mezcal selection in town and the food is somehow an amazing fusion of traditional Mexican and Texan. This is the restaurant we ll take visiting friends to crown the Austin Experience.
Comedor,338,Only came for a cocktail and sat at the bar but the cocktails were fantastic. The vibe is very trendy. Cocktails will run you  13- 16 which I think is typical. Food menu looked great  very foodie-like.
Comedor,339,Entrance to the resturant is deceptive  no markings outside to indicate it s a resturant. I am glad I came. The ambience is fresh and open  not like any Mexican resturant I have ever been to.  The cocktails are fresh and have excellent quality in alcohol  the food is amazing. Not just in presentation but in creating unique flavors.  I came here on the off chance  wanting to eat Mexican yet not the usual. Well here I got the unusual yet great in flavors.  I had the Spanish octopus - Pulpo EnSu Tinto. I highly recommend this place and will be coming here the next time I am in Austin.    the service is with the right touch  not over bearing and the wait staff are knowledgeable so trust them if you don t know what you want but know the mood you are in.  You are in for a treat if you make it here.
Comedor,340,Ambiance was awesome.  Drinks were yummy. Food was interesting and good.  Roasted grasshoppers  Ewww  Bar staff were not very friendly.  We thought they were trying to give off an unfriendly NYC vibe. That won t work in Texas  One guy was friendly but the girl working next to him  Another story. Not ONE smile the entire 1.5 hrs we were there. Very offputting.  I would definitely go back though.
Comedor,341,Inventive  sleek  original  delicious  adventurous  complex.  For such a new restaurant  Comedor delivers a meal of successes all around.  Suerte seems to be getting all of the acclaim in the elevated modern Mexican cuisine realm right now  but the experience at Comedor blew it away in our opinion.  Do not miss the Huauzontle fritters  squash and mole  or chocolate tamal dessert  a subtle  dark  earthy take on a molten lava brownie.
Comedor,342,a hidden gem..unique modern decor  well trained and well dressed professional staff  pleasant outdoor space. we loved pork belly dish and tres leeches. will be back and try bone marrow tacos
Comedor,343,Just opened a week and a half ago. Friendly staff and a very fun menu. We got the tostada and lengua quesadilla. Drinks- mole oldfashion 
Comedor,344,Very impressed with the service and quality of the drinks and food.  Beautiful Space    Highly recommend  
Comedor,345,Delicious food  different and a welcome change from the norm. Great space  great music great vibe. Bar staff friendly and knowledgeable. Reasonably priced and highly recommended.   I m no food critic but the bone marrow tacos were indulgently good.   My first visit to Austin but not my last and I ll definitely eat here again or just come in for drinks. Either option is good. Try it  you won t be disappointed.
Comedor,346,What a great dining experience  Wonderful food and great ambiance  Thee wait staff was so helpful and warm.
Comedor,347,The best huauzontle fritters I ve ever eaten  First time in Austin and we accidentally walked in here thinking it was the Garage cocktail bar.  What a pleasant surprise.   There were very few vegetarian options though. But the cocktails were amazing.  The staff was very friendly and we had a great tome   Would love to come back to Austin for Comedor again.
Comedor,348,I think the menu changes but bone marrow tacos were AWESOME  beef tongue quesadilla was great  barbacoa tamal was pretty good  tres leches dessert was also awesome  there s a  20 corkage fee for those wanting to bring their own bottle. This is definitely a pricy option but it s so worth it 
Comedor,349,Comedor is the ultimate hospitality experience in Austin. Not only is it one of the most beautiful spaces  but consideration is given to the smallest of details  and the execution is superb. Love the cocktails and the food  Philip Speer s desserts cannot be missed - especially the Tres Leches.
Comedor,350,Beautiful restaurant space inside and out. Edgy  modern yet comfortable.  Reasonable  prices for downtown. Great cocktails. Food is well executed  however  it s tough to put together a well-rounded meal. Your main plates have meat and sauce but little else. We did order one of the vegetables we could find on the menu as one of our appetizers  a spaghetti squash tamal. Disappointingly  it comprised a lot of masa with almost no squash filling. The fritters were quite good. The moles and sauces  even when billed hot were quite tolerable. The quail tasted like Italy met Mexico - interesting but it would have been better if accompanied by something beyond the sauce. Chocolate tamal and ice cream balanced out our meal with a taste of bitter and sweet. Service was attentive though felt a little rushed for a Sunday evening with half the tables empty.
Comedor,351,Where to start.... the outside looks very unassuming but once you enter the vibe is very modern  industrial.  Lots of steel and glass but with a comfortable vibe.  Greeted immediately by a friendly hostess and had a table within a few minutes.   The menu was a little overwhelming as we were not familiar with most of the items but our server  Courtenay  was amazing   She explained the dishes and gave us some recommendations.   The octopus torta was out of this world      So much so that we got a second one.   We also got the mushroom quesadilla and the halibut among other items.   All amazing    If you are in Austin  definitely take the time to come here   
Comedor,352,Great Mexican food with a unique twist. They make great drinks as well. The vibe is cool  modern - not your typical Mexican joint - but not pretentious. Very friendly and knowledgeable wait staff. Really enjoyed the experience.
Comedor,353,Let me start with the food...so delicious  Very authentic and unique. Our waiter  Jared  was extremely professional and helpful. He recommended a bunch of dishes and explained all of them. Very good service  The interior design is beautiful. This is a great date spot  or a fun place to come with friends for dinner. You will not be disappointed. My favorite dining experience here in Austin.
Comedor,354,Beautiful atmosphere  great music  stellar service  excellent cocktails and the food was so unique and so delicious. Flavor combinations and flavors I have never tasted. I enjoyed everything about Comedor and would put it at the top of your list when you visit Austin 
Comedor,355,Bone marrow tacos for the win. They are worth the   and a good amount of food. The restaurant is beautiful and very cool on the inside  but not homey.
Comedor,356,What a cool spot. 5th and Colorado. Open air patio and eclectic dining area set the tone. Music is a perfect compliment. The food hits all the marks. Creative  delicious  great presentation. Staff was plentiful  helpful  and fun. Amazing this restaurant is run this well so soon after the opening. Must go here. If your date doesn t go well  the relationship is doomed.
Comedor,357,GENIUS    SEXY    Finding the sign and entrance at night was like solving the mystery and getting the key for an escape room. I was so confused about signage and windows and lighting on the outside until I stepped inside. Suddenly the vibe you are going for clicked. BREATHTAKING AMBIANCE   SERVICE  DRINKS   amp  FOOD LIKE NO OTHER in Austin. Reminds me of Cartagena Colombia or Buzios Brazil. I salute who it was that had the vision for this restaurant and then the ability to see it through to perfection.
Comedor,358,Comedor has a clean  modern interior and an amazing courtyard. The space is super well-designed. If you happen to be there for the food and drink    they won t disappoint either. For us  the Bone Marrow Tacos and Quail Milanesa were standouts in a meal where we tried a lot of their dishes and everything over-achieved.
Comedor,359,Amazing service and food. The building is absolutely beautiful. Drinks are great too. Hard to pick my favorite part about it  Order the bone marrow tacos and the Comedor margarita.
Comedor,360,Hands down best food and service I ve ever had    Victor at the bar was amazing and gave us the best service ever  He new about everything on the menu and he recommended a great mezcal selection and as well as cocktails  The bone marrow tacos were amazing  The desserts are outstanding  This restaurant will for sure beat the charts as the best restaurant in Austin 
Comedor,361,Fabulous food   Impeccable service   Awesome atmosphere.  The bone marrow tacos are to die for. The pork chop sublime   The desserts delicious    Especially loved the chamomile mousse 
Comedor,362,The service was really good but the food was really not that good. Honestly  I was a very very try-hard menu. I love interesting ingredients and fun takes on food but this is so overdone. The food is DROWNED in sauce and the flavors are not well balanced.
Comedor,363,I have to say  it s not very often that we have such an amazing dining experience that it causes me to reach out to the restaurant to say thank you.  We came in for drinks as a group of 6 and 4 of us stayed for a dinner reservation.  From the moment we walked in the door  the entire staff was so warm and welcoming and all seemed genuinely excited to be there.  The food was sensational  cocktails unique and delicious and atmosphere beautiful.   I will say  after the sun went down  the dining room did get a little dark...I would liked to have seen my food a little more than I could.   Thank you  sincerely.  We look forward to coming back soon  and will be making lots of recommendations to friends to come see you  
Comedor,364,This is a tough one. It always frustrates me when a restaurant does the hard stuff well and they drop the ball on the easy stuff and it really messes up the whole experience. Since this is a new restaurant  my hope is that they can fix the issues. Let me start with the pros.  Pros  The food. Every dish we had was very well executed and tasty. You can tell the quality of the ingredients were there and the chef knows what they are doing. The moles were all fantastic which I know is hard to do. Also the restaurant design is very cool and the outdoor patio is nice. The waitress we had was also quite good as well.  Cons  The tough part about this dining experience was that it did not start well. I had called to confirm the large group reservation twice to have a table that could seat 7 and to not be in the bar type seating  because someone in my party could not sit on those high chairs . Something must have gotten mixed up and they did not have a table big enough for us and they sat us outside. It was 97 degrees outside and I was never told my reservation was outside but they told me when I arrived that  if you do not request inside you automatically get outside . Which for a Texas summer you really need to communicate. Especially if you make a large party reservation 4 weeks in advance and email call to confirm twice. I did also go inside at one point and noticed it was very loud inside so maybe outside was the better call anyway. Next con was the expensive cocktails that were watered down weak. I was trying to compare ATX Cocina to Comedor and this was one thing ATX does much better. It is rough spending 12-15 dollars for a weak drink. I would say another issue was the menu composition. The entrees are meant to be shared but most dishes contain just a meat and a mole which is fine but there are no vegetable sides. The vegetable dishes they have are actually in the appetizer part of the menu which does not make sense and was not communicated to us. Our group ended up just eating meat and mole which just made every bite pretty boring after a bit and heavy.   For a restaurant this pricy and this hyped  it was a bummer to have the small things mess up the whole experience. There are many solid high end Mexican restaurants in Austin that do those small things well that are less pricy so I do not plan to returning in the near future.
Comedor,365,We visited Comedor tonight for the first time. We experienced great service. The outside space was nice but hot and music was way too loud  The food however was not anything I will be coming back for. Everything seemed to have a lot of spice and most dishes had a mole of some kind. They are going to have to step it up to keep people coming back in this fiercely competitive restaurant environment 
Comedor,366,Feels like you re transported out of downtown Austin straight into Mexico City  Super swanky  super sexy. 10 10 food  service and atmosphere. The fritters  bone marrow tacos and the choco tamal are must orders. The food is interesting and unique while still being approachable. Servers do a great job of explaining the menu. If you re not an alcohol drinker  the bartenders will gladly whip you up an amazing mocktail.
Comedor,367,My first experience. Its important right  Especially when you know you will be spending a bit of money. So you take the wife out on a date. The waiter seemed okay  but only stopped at the table once in the hour we were there. So I was without a drink or drink order for at least half an hour. My wife and I decided then that we would go elsewhere for dinner. The table next to us was there first and never received their food and a manager spoke with them several times. No one spoke with us. My second drink order came late even though it was a beer and to top it off  they brought the wrong beer. I didn t drink it. The waiter says to me   would you like me to take it off your bill   I said  yes please.  Funny interaction. No apologies  no compensation   no visit from a manager. I would ve handled it differently.  So far  pedigree only.
Comedor,368,I was delighted to be a guests at this stunning new downtown restaurant. It was a delightful experience. We sat on the beautiful interior patio which is architecturally interesting and elegantly furnished. Our table had a variety of dishes which we shared on small plates . The food is delicious and attractively presented. The service was friendly and impeccable. A great experience  I ll be back with friends and family.
Comedor,369,Five star experience from start to finish. The host was outstanding  the wait staff did a perfect job  and the food hit the mark. The bone marrow tacos are a must have. The only down side was that the guacamole could use a second serving for the cost.
Comedor,370,What a huge disappointment on every level for our group at brunch today.  We had made reservations weeks ago for early afternoon.  They said 1 45 was the only available.  RED FLAG as when we got there 15 minutes early to an uncrowded restaurant  they were out of some of the wine....and it took 10 minutes between filling drink orders only to be told we had to substitute since they were out.  Next was the order of pan dulce for the table.  10-15 minutes later a  gift from the kitchen in the form of a pancake  was delivered.  No mention that they were out of pan dulce and it wouldn t show up.  Next came the entrees of which were the most pitiful and inedible we have ever encountered  much less had to pay for in a restaurant.  The English muffin sandwich couldn t be cut with a steak knife and had blackened cheese on one side  a gray soggy uncooked hash brown on the other muffin side  about three tablespoons of somewhat scrambled egg  a tasteless tomato and a teaspoon of mashed avocado.  All served on a totally white plate with no garnish or color.  A mushroom quesadilla was done the same.....on a white plate  no garnish and a dangerously almost raw egg with no seasoning.  Miniature fried fish tacos were not greasy but the tortillas were old and fell instantly apart.  Service was trying but lots of important looking management had no clue what they were doing.  We will not return and certainly recommend that others avoid this restaurant.  Food this bad should never have gotten the recent hype as there are so many excellent restaurants in our city 
Comedor,371,quite simply the best and most interesting restaurant in austin. comedor is in a class of its own.
La Cocina de Consuelo,1,Very cute mom-and-pop Mexican restaurant. Enjoyed the food  service and my overall experience. Food is as authentic  and delicious  as it gets   TIP  Breakfast burritos are served ONLY before 11am  
La Cocina de Consuelo,2,Small place. Cute decor. Super sweet service on 4th of July when my son wanted tacos and this was the only place open near us.   Ordered a lunch special- Flautas with Mexican rice and Fideo  Tostada Plate with Mexican rice and refried beans and a Chicken Tortilla Soup and 1 Taco Combo for the kid. Total price with tax and tips was  34 which translates to a little over  11 per person.   Food is made fresh so there s a wait and it looked really good. Once we actually dug in  we were surprised by how bland and underwhelming the flavors were. It was really disappointing considering everything else  including the quality of ingredients were top notch. To briefly go through the items   Flautas - super bland and the chicken was kinda stinky Mexican rice - good and flavorful Fideo - first time trying and i really liked this dish Refried beans - basic  not my favorite Chicken Tortilla Soup - kid didn t like it so I had it. It was pretty good Taco - super basic and boring. Can t believe soup and one taco is like 12 dollars. Lowlight of the meal. Tostada - the round fried tortilla was really good. But it needed something to make it stand out as the dish as a whole was super bland.  So I m sad to say  despite the friendly and warm service  the food just didn t do it for us.
La Cocina de Consuelo,3,Always looking for mom amp pop restaurants when visiting cities. Happen to come across this place. I ordered chilaquiles with an egg  husband ordered machacadas and fresh flour tortillas. Servings are the perfect size. I usually have left overs  but we ate everything off our plates. Chilaquiles were the perfect spices and crunch. Husband usually doesnt care for chilaquiles  but he was picking off my plate. Flour tortillas tasted just like my Abuelita s flour tortillas  so fresh and fluffy. Highly recommended. If we every visit again  would definitely come back.
La Cocina de Consuelo,4,This is a little place that warms your heart and feeds your soul. The people here were very nice and the decor is so cute. Loved the tortillas and the salsa.
La Cocina de Consuelo,5,If you re looking for breakfast with no hype but with high-quality Austin s homestyle LatinX Mexican flavors  this is the place to go. We like getting their breakfast burritos. Some of the burritos are named on the menu. You can also get custom burritos from favorite ingredients  plus yummy barbacoa and nopales  The service is great and friendly. The coffee is rich and accessible for refills. Their tortillas are made with homemade flour  corn  or wheat. We are just addicted to the flour ones from Consuelo s. These are the top-shelf tortillas  the kind that your Abuelita would make if she could. We cannot wait to come back for other times of the day to try their lunch plates.  With the pandemic still lingering  the whole staff is masked and every table is cleaned between patrons. The place is small  but you can order takeout.
La Cocina de Consuelo,6,Some of the best queso in Austin  hands down.         La Cocina de Consuelo is in Rosedale.  You normally think  real deal  Mexican restaurants have to be on the East Side  or in Del Valle  right   Mexicans are all poor right   And if they are rich  they can t cook because their household staff does all the cooking for them  right   Wrong  wrong and wrong again.         La Cocina de Consuelo is an outstanding Mexican restaurant  founded by a rich woman.  Her family was well enough connected in Mexico  that when she came to the United States  people were able to introduce her to the Bush family.  She adores cooking. She cooked for the Bushes. Her dream was to have a restaurant.  Her income was secure enough that she did not have to settle for a trailer by the side of Highway 812.  She bought a beautiful cottage on Burnet in Rosedale.  She decorated it tastefully and well.  The place looks a lot like the way Pasha did before it closed.  She put in a team of excellent people to execute her recipes.  And that team makes food to die for.         La Cocina de Consuelo is small.  There are maybe eight tables in there  tops.  In its early days  it had no tables and was all take out.  Now a handful of people can eat there at a time.  Not unlike the fancy omakase restaurants you can find over on the East Side where you sign up a year in advance.  At least at La Cocina  you can just walk in.         The clientele is about 3 4 Mexican.  I and one other professorial looking Rosedale couple were the only Anglo tables in the place.  The Mexican clientele ranged from lower upper class to middle class to upper lower class.  There were two plumbers from Lago Vista.  There were two tables of what looked like office workers or social workers from the nearby State of Texas Government Complex.  Another person was wearing sleeveless outdoor gear with absolutely clean unsullied clothes. A site supervisor   There were some business people too.         My queso was absolutely memorable ... a destination dish.  This was the variety with chorizo.   This was firey but not unpleasantly spicy   Savory and complicated with flavors that changed around the bowl   Rich and filling without invoking cheese overkill.  I absolutely inhaled my bowl.         The menu is small.  The house is small.  The flavor is big.  Check this place out.  Why should you let the Bush family have all the fun 
La Cocina de Consuelo,7,Came here on a Sunday around noon with my boyfriend  didn t seem terribly busy which we were happy about. Got in line and ordered at the front  told us next time we can take a seat and they will serve us     Ordered two tortilla soup and taco combos with the beef tacos. Also ordered the tacos al pastor with fideo. Also lemonade. Oh and the tres leches cake and flan.   Everything came out super speedy and everyone working was so nice. Once we began eating the delicious and flavorful food  it started to get a little busy. The employees and Letty  Handled the rush very well and were still attentive to everybody.   Good thing we came on a cloudy cooler day bc the soup and fideo slapped  Warmed me from the inside out and made me feel so cozy. The al pastor was well seasoned. The flan  sourced locally from Algo Dulce  was sooo creamy and lightly sweet. The tres leches was moist from the creamy sauce but still fluffy yet dense.   Will definitely be returning to this small restaurant  fell in love immediately 
La Cocina de Consuelo,8,Sometimes the simplest things are best. The lunch special was chicken mole  served with a side of rice  beans or a mango jicama salad  I chose the first and last  at this small but very charming spot. Mole is one of those dishes that when done well will have you thinking about it all day. The mole here was just like that. Three juicy hunks of chicken  steam-cooked and slathered in this immensely rich and flavorful sauce. The flavor was closest to poblano than negro  and it was mildly spicy. The companion of the deep red flavor was this thick mole that had all sorts of notes  guajillo  cascabel  -- I felt warm but also nostalgic and thought about the last time I had such a pleasing mole.   I had the delicate rice with the fresh fruit salad  which also has this crisp pico de gallo  tiny leaves of finely minced cilantro . Needed a little more acid and seasoning but it really worked well here.   The limonada agua fresca hit the spot too  as did their somewhat delicate flour tortillas.   I ll only quibble with the inconsistent service. One moment the young server  looking Inexperienced  forgot my tableware as I was being served. Two minutes later I overheard the next table ask for their knife and fork too.
La Cocina de Consuelo,9,Always great service and excellent food.  Daily lunch specials during the week that help make choosing what to eat very easy.  Chicken flautas with mexican rice and refried beans are the faves but everything else is also excellent.  Tragic they don t have charro beans  those would be epic with the way everything else is at this restaurant.  Parking is a bit tricky but worth it.
La Cocina de Consuelo,10,This food was not good i m sorry. Not real mexican at all  it is extremely tex mex. It is very beautiful inside for sure   i love the decor. The lady named Thu was extremely friendly and attentive. Super attentive she made sure we were well taken care of. But i do not like the shredded cheese and lettuce type of tacos. The soup grew on me  but it was more just like a regular chicken soup. It didn t taste like tortilla soup at all. I just didn t like it  the only thing i really liked was the salsa.
La Cocina de Consuelo,11,One of my top go-tos in North Austin for amazing Mexican food  and they never disappoint. My favorites are the chile relleno  Friday lunch special   crispy tacos  spinach enchiladas  migas burrito  migas plate  nepolitas  and jicama salad. Sheesh everything on the menu I guess  Except the only thing that doesn t really do it for me are the tacos al pastor.
La Cocina de Consuelo,12,I don t often get enchiladas as my entree  but damn La Cocina de Conseulo kills the game there. With a variety of stuffings and toppings to choose from  you can t go wrong with anything here.  I got their Enchilada Plate where you get 2 enchiladas to choose from  a crispy taco  refried beans  and rice. For the two flavors  I got the  - Potato with Chipotle Chili sauce  - Beef Enchilada with Chili Con Carne Sauce  Both tasted great. It s fun to balance out the rich meaty flavor of the beef enchilada with the more balanced lighter potato one. I like the mix  amp  match aspect here because one was more on the cheesy side and the other was more on the tomato sauce side.  If you don t care for enchiladas then no worries they have other classic dishes too. As for the service  It was very kind. The owners are passionate about what they do and it s evident in their work and their hospitality. The ambiance of the restaurant is cute since it resides in a former house  now turned into a restaurant. All in all  I had a great time.
La Cocina de Consuelo,13,What an amazing restaurant  I had the chilaquiles with eggs and chicken. My wife had selected to make her own burrito which was also great. The chilaquiles were delicious with a little bit of spice the chicken was juicy tender and very very good  I had the eggs over medium which were cooked perfectly.  They make their own flour tortillas enough said stop for breakfast or lunch.. .
La Cocina de Consuelo,14,Easily 5 stars. LCdC is in a small house on Burnet. Myself being from the Rio Grande Valley and since our move from SA  the Mrs and I have been hungering for good Homemade Tortillas. We found them here  This is not an easy find in Austin  Texas  We stopped in for a late breakfast and seating is quite limited even during off times. I had the chorizo and egg breakfast plate which came with refried beans  potatoes and of course tortillas. The Mrs had the Chilaquiles plate and it came with the same 2 sides. My plate was a hit all around and she really enjoyed hers. The portions are adequate and very reasonably priced. We spoke to the owner herself upon checking out and thanked her for bringing such great food to the area. We highly recommend La Cocina de Consuelo and I highly recommend you get there ASAP 
La Cocina de Consuelo,15,It s a small restaurant with capacity of 20 people  yet their hearts are big enough to welcome the entire world. Service for me is everything. They were attentive to all their clients and made sure we were taken care of. The food is true home cooked with fresh ingredients. The quality of the handmade flour tortillas was incredible. Definitely recommend anyone wanting a good Mexican brunch  as that is what I got at 1pm on a Monday.
La Cocina de Consuelo,16,Love their fideo  it s so comforting  reminds me of my childhood . Breakfast tacos are tasty and filling  tortillas are excellent. Had their cheese enchiladas recently and I can t complain. I work in the area  but I m mostly working from home these days  once I m back in the office  I ll definitely be trying other dishes there.
La Cocina de Consuelo,17,What a great find    If you want delicious authentic  style Mexican breakfast along with homemade flour tortillas  then this is the place to go. Service is swift and on point. Ladies there were very sweet and accommodating. Definitely coming back    Note  Had the barbacoa  which I don t order just anywhere . Not fatty or drenched in grease. Sooooo good   
La Cocina de Consuelo,18,This place has AMAZING food   It s ridiculous how delicious everything is. My absolute favorite thing  that I will one day happily OD on  are their migas burritos with red salsa. Their red and green salsas are equally delicious  but that red on those migas.. perfection 
La Cocina de Consuelo,19,Love this place   It was recommended by a friend and they never disappoint.  The restaurant is small  but we ve never had to wait very long to be seated.  We have been there for breakfast and lunch and have always loved what we ordered.  My favorite plates are the enchiladas with ancho chile sauce  the chile relleno plate and their chilaquiles. Their homemade tortillas are delicious.  I just wish I lived a little closer so that I could go more often.
La Cocina de Consuelo,20,A couple consultants that was onsite this week wanted to try authentic Tex-Mex. I tried searching on Yelp but didn t come up with anything so Google came to the rescue. I found this list   a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.thrillist.com 2Feat 2Faustin 2Fbest-tex-mex-restaurants-in-austin amp s cf6b190a391e60de9886c7fc6e721aec2b651e5f63f08635d59c67becf6bb8b1  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  thrillist.com eat austin   a    My friend picked La Cocina de Consuelo and I m glad he did. It s a small hole in the wall kind of place and made me feel like I m eating at my friend s abuela s house.   Things you need to know  1  There were four parking spaces in front and additional parking in the back.  2  It s BYOB. 3  Food came out quickly. 4  They have daily specials - Wednesday - Mole   I m not a fan of Mole  so I opted for the Beef Fajitas with the Nopal  cactus  salad and the Mango Jicama Salad as my sides. These sides come with an upcharge of  1 each. I was very happy with my choices. The beef was tender and flavorful. The salads were light but packed with flavor. Also  I ordered corn tortillas. Get them  They were homemade and so good 
La Cocina de Consuelo,21,Found this hidden little place while in Austin. The food and service is great  The prices are some of the best in the area. There s not a lot of seating but we typically took ours to go. The tortillas are freshly homemade  Nothing fancy but the food is great.
La Cocina de Consuelo,22,Bro this spot is so cute and authentic  As a Mexican myself I truly enjoyed the tortillas. I had a burrito taco it was like my grandma made it no lie.
La Cocina de Consuelo,23,Enjoyed the huevos rancheros. The chewy homemade tortillas were great  as was the spicy salsa.
La Cocina de Consuelo,24,This is a very small restaurant with Mexican home cooking. We love the mole  It s definitely worth the drive from wherever you are. Love to promote and support small business owners with good food.
La Cocina de Consuelo,25,Their home made tortillas make the best breakfast burritos in town    Big burritos  cheap  and fast-to-go.  My favorite combo is the eggs  rajas  and avocado on flour with salsa verde.
La Cocina de Consuelo,26,My family ordered their enchilada dinner that fed 4-6 people and it was delicious. It was so easy and so yummy  and affordable for great food  We ordered a few days in advance and then drove up  amp  got our food very quickly and smoothly. There were 5 of us and it was plenty.
La Cocina de Consuelo,27,My wife and I love their breakfast burritos which are wrapped in house made tortillas and come with very good salsa  red or green .
La Cocina de Consuelo,28,Yummy chile relleno   We stopped by for lunch at La Cocina de Consuelo this past Friday  and noticed other tables enjoying their chile relleno plates.  Apparently this was the daily special.  For  7.99  it included two sides of your choice  not just Mexican rice or refried pinto beans  but also black beans  nopales salad  mango  amp  jicama salad or fideo  and an iced tea.  Plus complimentary chips and salsa.  It sounded like a great deal.  We both ordered it.  Our food arrived quickly  accompanied by the tastiest handmade flour tortillas ever.  The corn ones were fine  but the flour ones were out-of-this-world delicious   Chile relleno stuffed with beef and most of our assorted sides were very good.  My only complaint was the pinto beans.  Some melted in your mouth  yet others were quite hard  obviously needing a lot more cooking time.    I ll happily return to explore more of their menu.  I love mole chicken  and - oh  good news - that s their special on Wednesdays.
La Cocina de Consuelo,29,This has to be one of the best neighborhood gems. I have been wanting to try this place since I pass it frequently. The only thing I hate is how it took me this long to finally try it. Hands down one of the best mexican restaurants I ve been to  and I ve lived in Houston with multiple mexican restaurants . The people are so friendly and welcoming. Please support this restaurant during these hard times. You ll be rewarded with amazing food too 
La Cocina de Consuelo,30,Chances are if you don t live in the surrounding neighborhood you ve driven by this gem and not realized it. Do yourself a favor and STOP  These are hands-down the best enchiladas I ve had outside of Mexico. And they are that good  every time  without fail. My partner and I take all of our out-of-town visitors here. He s tried many other things on the menu and enjoyed them all  but I can t pry myself away from the tomatillo enchiladas. Other good things to note  the salsa is fresh and packs a punch  have your water handy   you can BYOB  and they hope to reopen evening hours soon  we ve asked  repeatedly . If you want your dinner fix before hours change you can pick up their dinner deal   55 enchilada dinner for six with rice and beans - what  .   A few months ago I noticed some lower reviews from long-time customers over customer service. I think there was a brief transition period that s definitely passed. Our last few visits are back to superb service and the best Mexican food in Austin. There s a lot of chain restaurants in Austin and a lot of Mexican restaurants trying to fool you with blas  food and a flashy ambiance. This family- run business will restore your faith and leave you smiling.
La Cocina de Consuelo,31,I was searching for a place that serves chilaquiles  and Lord be hold  here I am. Great place and even greater people.
La Cocina de Consuelo,32,Under new management  and sounds like they kept the business in the family. My first time here was with my visiting family from Houston. Loved the chilaquiles. The salsa was delicious  and authentic. My grandma was with us  and she s worked in the food industry all of her life  so she s quite picky if we go out to eat. She was happy with food  and service. If it s grandma approved then I know it s legit good. I loved to see how there are many regulars that come here. People who have been loyal customers for many years have certain tacos food named after them. How cool is that    Wish I lived closed  so I could be a regular. Keep supporting this local  and family run business 
La Cocina de Consuelo,33,My friend and I are from Dallas and we ordered their migas breakfast burrito while we were in town... and we still talk about and drool over how amazing it was. Seriously  You won t regret ordering food from here. It rocks  
La Cocina de Consuelo,34,I like this spot. The food is consistently good and I like the back patio they have. It s an inconspicuous place next-door to the bakery. I mostly come for the breakfast and I m looking forward to come back and try the lunch. I hope this place can remain here because it s not as big and fancy as the newer places that have moved into the neighborhood but the food is solid and it s a nice place to bring people.
La Cocina de Consuelo,35,I ve been frequenting Upper Crust and Pacha - both next door - for two decades and never noticed La Cocina  I found this place via Yelp and was so glad I did   First of all  in my book  there s no chance for five stars unless you make fresh tortillas. They make both flour and corn here and they re just perfect  I especially love he corn tortillas  small and soft  just like I remember them on the streets of border Mexico growing up.  Their breakfast tacos are outstanding and they actually make bean and egg tacos the right way  scrambled  not layered. Another plus.  Their red and green salads are made daily and don t have vinegar or other unnecessary ingredients. Just tomato  onion  serrano peppers  cilantro  and salt. Simple  high quality ingredients is all you need   I ve yet to try lunch or dinner  but if comments overheard by other patrons  as I ve worked on their WiFi network  are indicative  you won t be disappointed.
La Cocina de Consuelo,36,Great food  great value  and kind staff. Breakfast burritos are delicious and the lunch specials are good too.
La Cocina de Consuelo,37,Ok... wow. Maybe I was hungry when eating this food or maybe the food was just THAT good.  I think the latter . I got the combo plate with the chicken enchiladas. I had a bite of my husband s burrito. The food is out of this world.The only thing that I m upset about it that we didn t order more so we won t have leftovers to look forward to.
La Cocina de Consuelo,38,I love this lil spot. I have always wondered about it driving by. I m glad I walked into this cocina in Rosewood for what I call a true Mexican cuisine experience. It s more authentic than Tex Mex and their fresca ingredients set it apart from other area spots. The tortillas are homemade as is their salsas- in true Mexican food tradition that s where it starts. The breakfast taco I ordered was piping hot and fresh and even after it sat for 20 minutes it was still warm  They had chili rellenos as their lunch special so they let prepay for it and pick it up at 6p when I got off work so I could have it for dinner  No one else on earth would let me do that. It was as delish as the chorizo and egg breakfast taco I had for breakfast. It was lightly battered and not greasy. Their rice was so yummy and the beans tasted slow cooked. If you like fresh ingredients and real authentic Mexican food made by an abuelita this is your new spot.
La Cocina de Consuelo,39,Just go in  Trust me. You can t go wrong with anything you order. I am so glad they are open during COVID. Go support local small businesses 
La Cocina de Consuelo,40,It breaks my heart to write a poor review for La cocina de Consuelo. I ve been many times and the food and the help have always been great until today. Honestly  I m struggling to explain the size of the gap between what happened today and my past experiences. Perhaps the ownership has changed  or perhaps some small emergency in the kitchen threw everything off.   Let s start with the salsa--normally red hot and flavorful  but today is was flavorless and not nearly as spicy.   Each of the dishes we ordered today was barely edible. Between the three of us  we were all profoundly disappointed with the quality. Burnt meat  lukewarm enchilada sauce out of a can  and a completely different tortilla soup. The food was many notches below the worst Mexican food I have ever had in Austin.   Then there was the service. While no one was unfriendly  there was a clear level of incompetence. They came back after taking the order  because they forgot to ask key details. Then the tacos came without meat  and they plated the wrong type of beans on the other dish. They were very slow to refill drinks and chips  and the waitress had to come back to check that the credit card we gave them was from our table before running the bill.   Wanted to provide constructive feedback. Please tell me this was an aberration and that there s hope that the restaurant can be great once again.
La Cocina de Consuelo,41,This place has potential to be a good Mexican restaurant.  The environment is nice and cozy and I can see my family coming here every Saturday morning for breakfast. Wait...what they are not open on Saturdays    When you walk in  no one greets you  and there s no sense of direction on to order at the counter or be waited at the table.  You have to order at the counter.  I  did see a couple came in and again no one greeted them.  They sat at the table and waited for someone. They end up leaving the place.   On with the food... I ve ordered the Migas plate with a side of barbacoa. They ran out of potatoes and asked if I would like rice instead. I personally don t eat rice for breakfast  unless eating leftovers.  The Migas were weak in flavor  skimping with the eggs and the cheese was not melted.  The refried beans was not refried and was not completely smashed.  Their flour tortilla was good  not many restaurants hand make their tortillas.   I m willing to come back  but not rushing it...
La Cocina de Consuelo,42,We live in Houston but every time we take a trip to Austin this place is a MUST   Nothing fancy but always absolutely DELICIOUS.
La Cocina de Consuelo,43,Well  this shall be a first. I will review this locale as I am here. It is a small l location. I had to find parking in the back  but once you become familiar with this area  you notice it s like that around here.  There apparently is an order window here. Not very clear on how things work   but I managed to put in an order for a barbacoa burrito and a coffee. I also told the lady up front that I would look at the menu and see what else struck my fancy.  I sit down and about 5 to 10 minutes later I m approached by that same lady asking me if I d like for her to submit my order. I giggled. I basically just reordered everything and added a milanesa torta to my order while letting her know I d already ordered what I d previously said at the counter.  Oh  she also happened to inform me that the coffee is self serve.    Breath in  breath out.  No chips. No water.  Make sure you flag her down if you start getting thirsty.  My food arrived. Looked awesome.  How did it taste  Awesome   What can I say  It s a mexican joint being taken over by hipsters in a white city that wants to call a taco a taco and a gyro a gyro  but all tasting american bland.  These ladies are coping  but sticking to good preparation in their kitchen. The food they produce is delicious and takes as long as it takes to make it fresh. You will have to ask for what you need since they can be swamped on weekends. It s basically a taco stand in a hipster neighborhood where they started asking for WiFi and frappuccinos. They are trying to have good service  but are overwhelmed and I don t care as long as they continue to churn out good food.  I am from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.  Where we know how to make a good barbacoa from both beef head or cheek.  Period. My opinion of this places barbacoa  They score an A.     The torta was also delicious too   It had the required peefectly thin sliced breaded steak. My official ruling is always on whether it has beans as a spread or not. I dealt with this heartbreak one too many times in El Paso. The beans were there  and they were delicious.   I was allowed to pay after since I ordered twice and had already sat down when I told her my meal was for here. Looks like you normally pay before...if they remember to charge you right away that is.
La Cocina de Consuelo,44,Breakfast burrito haven.  Homemade flour tortillas  everything is made to order.  Always good to find a great small establishment like this. Salsa is homemade and perfectly completes the burritos.   I will be back in the future 
La Cocina de Consuelo,45,I was desperate for some authentic Mexican so after consulting yelp came across la Cocina de consuelo.  We came for lunch  our server wasn t friendly at all but at least he was fast. We were seated quickly and orders was taken right away.  So the food  Almost everything was under seasoned a bit but there was salt and pepper on the table and with a little salt added everything was delicious  Some of the best Mexican rice I ve had in a very long time. I had a combo plate and they accidentally messed up my enchilada order so brought me additional enchiladas on the side which was great. The tortillas are amazing  so so so good. The chicken in the chicken taco was a little dry but still good flavor. I had thought  3.75 for a taco sounded a little ridiculous but the taco was massive.  My boyfriend had the Sunday special which was the barbacoa -- it def needed salt  it wasn t very warm but once we added salt it was delicious.   Overall the food could use some more seasoning  salt on the table worked fine  the service could be a little friendlier  but it was the exact hangover cure I was looking for.
La Cocina de Consuelo,46,We have been going to Consuelo s since she opened and it is THE best   Don t let the tiny appearance fool you  this place is big on flavor  quality and value   My personal favorites are the handmade crispy tacos  the enchiladas ... all of them  but I love the beef and the green chicken.  Also  IMHO the breakfast burrito is THE best in Central Austin   We love the Mr. Bob s burrito  and for extra goodness add extra chorizo  amp  avocado.  Oh and did I mention the flan   You know how many Mexican restaurants have rather lousy desserts   Well  you have got to try the flan   it s very different and so much better than any flan you have ever had   Sadly they are never open on Saturdays and that tends to be our favorite day for Mexican food  but we have managed to get in on the other days.  We start to have withdrawals if we don t get us some Connie s at least every couple weeks    Sad to hear they will no longer be open evenings - but admit we mostly ate there for dinner because we usually eat dinner before 6  amp  they did not reopen until 6.  We also always loved that they allow you to bring your own wine  amp  they will provide glasses.  This was nice when family visited.  Consuelo s is a little Rosedale gem we hope will continue to be around for a long time 
La Cocina de Consuelo,47,BEST breakfast burritos in town    Hands down    Absolutely love this place. And the staff is always so nice and friendly  You gotta go here 
La Cocina de Consuelo,48,Perfect  little cozy place  Felt right at home. The breakfast was truly authentic  just like my mom s. And the service was phenomenal as well 
La Cocina de Consuelo,49,Absolutely a hidden gem  The lady in front is so sweet. It feels like I m ordering food at my family s home. The food is great and the tortillas are homemade just like my grandmas. I LOVE the breakfast burritos.
La Cocina de Consuelo,50,We have loved Consuelo s since they opened. Their delicious breakfast burritos are a great deal  and their lunch and dinner entrees are great  too.
La Cocina de Consuelo,51,Best tortillas soup ever    I ordered to go and it was super fast and convenient  Staff was super nice   10 10 overall rate    definitely recommend coming here 
La Cocina de Consuelo,52,So I gotta say...I just don t understand the hype and rave reviews a out this place...I must be missing a piece of the puzzle because not only did I find this tiny lil Mexican kitchen overpriced  but the food was absolutely nothing to rave about in my opinion.  I had the spinach and mushroom quesadilla as the flour tortillas have been touted as the best in town. My friend  who had come one time before  had the same cheese quesadilla as she had ordered previously and an order of the guac for two. We also had a Mexican Arnold Palmer  which my friend suggested as well  which was the mexi-limeade mixed with iced tea.   For  4.25  each quesadilla was surprisingly small and though the tortillas were good  they were not anything to write home about  and coming from a Mexican family that could definitely lay claim to AWESOME handmade flour and corn tortillas  I know a good tortilla when I have one . Even my friend  who had recommended we come here and had a quesadilla before  said that it just was not as good as her first time. The guac was honestly a joke...for  4.99 the tiny bowl of guac accompanied by some salsa and average tortilla chips was just not worth the price.   It is a cute lil place  but very very small and cramped and the seating is extremely limited. We ended up sitting at this tiny lil table by the back entrance  which comes off the parking in the back  which was unfortunate as I had to stop several times between bites to scoot my chair in so as not to continue to get hit by the flinging opening door from incoming customers.  Needless to say  I really wanted to like this place  but aside from the nice lady who seemed to be the owner  there was just nothing to bring me back. I might try the breakfast tacos at some point  but we ll see. It s just hard to return to a place where you spent  20 for two quesadillas  some guac and two non-alcoholic drinks and then had to head over to TacoDeli because you re still hungry.
La Cocina de Consuelo,53,On the hunt for a good breakfast burrito in Austin  and drove by La Covina de Consuelo and saw a sign that s said breakfast burritos so I had to make the stop. I miss the breakfast burritos we had at the local taquerias back home  so I m looking forward to finding a good fix here in Austin   I got  Johnny s  breakfast burrito which had eggs  refried beans  cheese  potatoes  and I added jalepe os. The burrito wasn t really stuffed like the breakfast burritos I m used to  but the homemade tortilla was great  The fillings were a little on the bland side  but not intolerable by any means. Although their salsa was pretty damn good and helped balance the flavor that I was looking to get.   I ll try a breakfast plate before I decide if I d make this a place I d consider going to regularly.
La Cocina de Consuelo,54,This is my go to spot for breakfast and lunch. The food is delicious and the staff are really friendly.
La Cocina de Consuelo,55,Little inconspicuous spot serving some of the best Tex mex in town. Their flour tortillas are the freshest I ve seen in Austin. The chicken Monterrey is my go-to... but be warned because it s blazing hot. Like torchys diablo levels of hot. It s small on the inside and parking is limited so I always order takeout. They re so nice here and are happy to modify whatever you ask for. Breakfast is equally delicious here. You can t go wrong with whatever you get.
La Cocina de Consuelo,56,This place is a bit over priced and not authentic.  I got the soup and taco combo for lunch. The soup was like chicken veggie soup with tortilla chips soaked in it. The taco was mostly cheese. I left here still hungry. Even though I eat a lot in general  you can t get full off a small taco filled with cheese and a small bowl of soup.   I felt like I was eating American food. The chips and salsa were pretty good but that s about it. I definitely wouldn t be coming back.   Their parking lot is tiny. If it s full and you went to the back  good luck turning around. The restaurant is tiny as well.
La Cocina de Consuelo,57,I have been coming here for seven years and have had the stuffed burrito almost every single time. It is the best burrito I ve had and has even ruined some places for me. My mother gets the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and she loves that dish more than she loves me. You will not be disappointed with either of these or probably anything on the menu 
La Cocina de Consuelo,58,I ve been interested in La Cocina de Consuelo since long time Yelp pal Don P. reviewed this place  not to mention Christine A. s instant beard between her legs on her visit. So today when Ol  Rooster had an appointment in North Austin I swung in for breakfast.   I noticed instant promise as soon as the chap took my order at the counter. Yep  looks like a Grandma wearing a hair net complete with spatula at the grill. A few minutes later I was presented with my Huevos Con Queso with Asadero cheese refried beans  potatoes  and a huge charred flour tortilla.  The scrambled eggs with the cheese and green chili sauce were delicious as was that frisbee sized tortilla. Decent flavor for the beans  but the potatoes while tender could have used more time in a pan or griddle. Not enough browning for a crisp exterior. I asked for some extra rojo only to be presented with more green chili.  Service was minimal most likely filled with prep as I arrived about ten minutes before the posted hours  but the open signs were lit. Perhaps a few more minutes and I would have been leaning towards a better star rating. A good adventure for a Southie  a few tweaks including bringing the small details up to the price and I d really love this place Better than The Omlettry these days
La Cocina de Consuelo,59,Been going here for years  especially on Wednesdays for their mole special. Best mole in town. Love the homemade tortillas. They are also doing take out during the quarantine.
La Cocina de Consuelo,60,First time trying la concina. Nice little hole in the wall. Food was good and the salsa has a good kick to it  Food seemed slightly pricey but overall pretty solid food. Finding a parking spot may be the only down fall to this place  the parking lot only has about 10 or so spaces.
La Cocina de Consuelo,61,Been A VERY longtime since the last visit..After all we have to keep the adventure going  ...This run...I was solo  and it was for breakfast...I am a Huge Migas fan  and plan and simple..it was good...packed full of flavor  but when it comes to bang for you buck  portion seamed small  and only received on flour tortilla...one Large  burnt  stiff flour tortilla...for a  10 dollar bill including tip for breakfast seams step...customer service was decent...Not sure if I would venture there again for breakfast..for a  10 spot I could pack myself out somewhere close to home..
La Cocina de Consuelo,62,I came here about a month ago  and my experience was far worse than I ever expected or I thought could happen. I used to come here often and was always taken care of by the owner s family member  and our service was always phenomenal.   We came on a weeknight and took a long time to get greeted. Finally  our server  that I never have seen there before  sat us and left without seeing if we wanted anything to drink.  When she finally came back  we ordered water and queso right away. It took almost 15 minutes for us to get our water  and another ten min or so queso.  After waiting another 15 minutes for the server to come back to take our order  we just asked for the check and then left. Not to mention  there was a table sitting outside that she kept forgetting about.   I totally understand being in the weeds while serving at a tiny place and being the only server  but she wasn t that friendly at all  seemed too stressed out  and she could ve been vocal about being busy. A little more attentiveness and communication goes a long way.  Sadly  I don t know if I will ever be returning to eat here any time soon.
La Cocina de Consuelo,63,I went today because I wanted to try something  new . I logged into yelp  and came across LA COCINA DE CONSUELO. It felt like home  The food was great  The atmosphere all around felt nice. Ugh I ve tried so many different Mexican locations and this is by far the best 
La Cocina de Consuelo,64,I have been here a few times  amp  I just love the food.  Reminds me of my moms cooking.  Very nice staff  amp  good food.
La Cocina de Consuelo,65,This is place is great  Food wise  great 5 stars. Taste like someones grandma cooked it  they have beans that taste homemade.   Now customer service wise  they 2 stars. On two separate occasions on different nights of the week we were denied service.   The first time we showed up at 9 30 on a Friday night  their hours show they close at 10. The lights were all off and it was closed.   Second time  we CALLED and asked what time they closed they said 10. So we showed up at 9 40 and as we are pulling into the driveway I see someone run up to the sign that reads  open  and turns it off. When we walk in  same person  very rudely says  we re closed  no chance to say anything or even explained we called prior to driving there.   I would love eat at this establishment again but I keep missing out. I work late so I rely on the hours they show on their page. Disappointing.
La Cocina de Consuelo,66,Favorite restaurant in Austin. If I could give more stars  I would.   Wonderful service  laid back vibe  adorable ambiance in a cute repurposed house - serving delicious and authentic Mexican food incl. incredible homemade tortillas.   I m a proud regular here. And this place consistently exceeds my expectations every time I go. It s truly a safe haven among all the new  super-trendy  and overpriced  restaurants that seem to be popping up everywhere in Austin.   Consuelo is all that a restaurant should be and more. Can t get enough.   And did I mention it s BYOB  
La Cocina de Consuelo,67,Mmm Mmmmm  So I will have to start this by saying that  I have only gotten breakfast from here but  it s amazing and  I m their dinner menu should be just as good  I m sure    I ordered the migas because  I m a big fan of ordering them from any restaurant that has them  and seeing which has the best  and this place has THE BEST migas. My favorite thing about this spot is that  they cut their potatoes to a decent size so you can load it up in your tortilla  Nothing worse than when I m eating migas  and they damn potato takes up all the space. The ONLY critique is they could stand to use a little salt on the eggs  but I mean hey  just add your own.   Did I also mention their takeout containers are perfect for meal prep   yup. The bomb.  FREAKIN YUM  YO. Love this place 
La Cocina de Consuelo,68,I don t know where to begin. I was overall disappointed. First visit  last visit.  I walked in  wasn t greeted  no one said anything to me. I assumed I could just seat myself  so I did. The waitress bought some chips n salsa and then asked me if I needed a menu.  Ummm  yea I did   She walked off  got a menu  took my drink order. She asked if I knew what I wanted to order yet   I literally just got the menu  I asked for a few minutes. Scanned through the menu  and decided on the Tuesday special  Carne Guisada  with two sides. Waitress took my order. Snacked on chips  salsa  both cold. Salsa had a good flavor. Took a sip of tea  and the tea was unsweet. I asked the waitress for sweetener. The waitress pointed out the cabinet with the sweetner coffee area and told me  it s over there  ...so ok  I guess I have to serve myself.  Food was brought out. I noticed the  guisada  was brighter in color than I expected. The carne  meat  was tough and soooooo bland       The entire plate was lukewarm. The hottest  temperature  thing were the tortillas. The tortillas were great  the food not so much. The guisada had carrots and potatoes. The carrots were ok. The potatoes were so mushy and GRAINY  I was like WTF       How is that possible    ....the guisada was some sort of tomatoey mush  it was also grainy. I ate what I could and left. The only reason I ate it was because I was hungry. ...
La Cocina de Consuelo,69,Service was  mostly  efficient with an ice tea refill forgotten by our server and scant time for pleasant convo  as well...BUT the barbacoa was moist and tender and delightful with rice and beans on the side and the corn tortillas are to LIVE for.  Prices are moderate  food quality is great  parking is a problem.
La Cocina de Consuelo,70,The homemade tacos on their MASSIVE breakfast tacos are the best. They are so fresh they still have that dusting of flour on them.   I ve never tried anything but the tacos but they are well worth it. And if it s raining their patio gets the best breeze and view of the rainy Austin day. FYI.   Parking is kind of a bitch. But where isn t it here.
La Cocina de Consuelo,71,Honestly  the lunch items here are consistently hit or miss  we ve developed the theory that there are different cooks and you ve gotta luck out to get the good one...   But  the breakfast burritos are SO RIDICULOUSLY GOOD and the service so friendly that Consuelo s still gets 4 whole stars.  I am 199  serious. Go eat these breakfast burritos. They are huge  made to order  plenty of filling options  and both the tortillas and salsa are made in-house.  I actually intended to type 100  up there  but I m leaving it as 199  because burritos.
La Cocina de Consuelo,72,Excellent mole plate  Tasty food for a great price. Would stop by again for a lunch special
La Cocina de Consuelo,73,Outstanding  What a gem  I highly recommend trying this place if you want authentic Mexican food.  The queso  salsa verde  refried beans  beef fajita tacos  tortilla soup  and crispy beef tacos are all outstanding     
La Cocina de Consuelo,74,Neighborhood gem.  Come for the relaxed  friendly atmosphere  brilliantly painted walls  and low prices.  Stay for the delicious comida.  I literally enjoy catching a cold just so I can relish eating Consuela s piping hot  nourishing chicken tortilla soup that much more.
La Cocina de Consuelo,75,Their food is delicious  I have searched high and low for a place that serves a good Machacado taco. Everywhere I go it is not machacado. Here at La Cocina de Consuelo they make it perfect. Not only was my taco huge but it had egg  machacado meat  potatoe and pico. Wow was it delicious. Thank yall for making my morning. Should have taken a pic but it was too good.
La Cocina de Consuelo,76,Good for the money and good for the hungry morning people. Picked up a nice variety of breakfast tacos. Nothing extraordinary. Flour tortillas were tasty  chewy  and not bad. I drenched everything in the sauces. Will come back someday when I feel like.. not Torchy s.  Also  parking is difficult and the streets feel very dangerous to pull in and out if you park directly in front of the shop. In the morning  they don t turn on all the lights  yet the restaurant is still packed  7am on a Friday . Looks like a local favorite.
La Cocina de Consuelo,77,Overpriced for the quality  cannot describe how awkward she made me feel  serving size was so small I was wondering where the rest of my food was  no music and very dirty
La Cocina de Consuelo,78,I had high hopes from the previous reviews and was expecting an authentic Tex-Mex experience. The food was terribly under-seasoned and the salsa and guacamole tasted rancid. The worst part was the service  our waitress made us feel bad for asking a questions about the menu and was hesitant to give us an extra fork after we accidentally dropped our fork. Don t come here if you are expecting a nice place to enjoy a BYOB.
La Cocina de Consuelo,79,Above average tex mex  but not by a huge amount. A cute  cozy ambiance in an otherwise-mostly-residential neighborhood gives it a bit of an edge  but not enough for me to make it a regular in my line up.   I came on a Wednesday to get the mole and it was really only OK. Admittedly  OK mole is still really yummy  but I ve come to expect more from places in Austin since you can get such good mole if you look. For example  Hecho en Mexico in South Austin and the  admittedly more expensive  Fonda San Miguel that s just around the corner.   My wife got a more standard plate of enchiladas and they were also fine  but nothing to write home about.   In a city littered with great tex mex  this place felt more run of the mill than exiting  which is too bad because it s right around the corner from home and feels like it could be a great neighborhood establishment.
La Cocina de Consuelo,80,Just took my last bite of that breakfast burrito and OMG.. that was good. Just moved to TX from CA and had a breakfast potluck at work.. saw this cute place and saw good reviews on yelp..  I am in agreement with all the good comments .. can t wait to try their dinner menu. The tortillas were amazing  the egg was nearly perfectly cooked and the avocado just topped it off well.
La Cocina de Consuelo,81,I always first judge a good Mexican restaurant by their table salsa  and Consuelo s salsa does not disappoint  It is spicy so beware. This gem is located in a small cottage style house off of Burnet in a great part of town  so space can be pretty limited during busy hours. They have specials throughout the week  I ve had their chicken mole that comes with 2 sides and it was so good and homemade. Their fideo reminded me of my grandmother s  so needless to say it was delicious. Their tortillas are homemade and all of the sides of tried so far  noplaes  rice  beans fideo  are great. Parking is a little limited in front of the restaurant but there s additional parking in the back. Try their mango jicama salad  it s amazing 
La Cocina de Consuelo,82,Gah  I ve had some good food here  and they make their own tortillas which is great  but the last two times we went  we had bad experiences unfortunately. And the service  well  it s not great. There are too many consistently good places around to chance another poor one here  so we have just passed on by
La Cocina de Consuelo,83,Delicious fresh food with authentic flavors  you can tell someone s grandma is back there     Great  prompt service. What more can you ask for  One of the best Mexican restaurants in town for sure. I would have taken a picture but by the time I realized that  the food on my plate was gone lol.
La Cocina de Consuelo,84,WTF    How does this place have such great reviews  This place was horrible  Do NOT go  not worth your time or money    I was really hopeful about this place but damn....
La Cocina de Consuelo,85,Hidden gem on Burnet near 45th. Surprised that this wasn t in the Google  best Austin breakfast tacos  search results.   I ve been ordering from here for the past 8 years and they never disappoint. Homemade everything. Good prices. Even better  the hipster to non-hipster ratio is acceptable.   The salsa is amazing. Beware  it s spicy. Ask for the green salsa  your taste buds will thank you. Seating is limited and parking even more so but trust me  it s worth it.
La Cocina de Consuelo,86,We did breakfast  chorizo and eggs with homemade tortillas and refried beans  corn tortillas were perfect and the salsa homemade with the perfect amount of heat   Coffee was great   Free WiFi.  Authentic Mexican Food.  Nice people.  Great experience - THANK YOU 
La Cocina de Consuelo,87,Server is super rude  prices are ridiculous  food is tasteless  I dont get how people give it more than 1 star  one server for the whole place  No wonder she is rude. You have to get up to get your own coffe. The barbacoa is half grease and half meat. Save your money    8 for a small plate with 2 eggs and probably 2 spoonfulls of bad beans and rice  and go somewhere else.
La Cocina de Consuelo,88,Not authentic Mexican food. My husband and I heard good things about this place so we decided to give it a try. Big disappointment. I asked for the queso fresco enchilada combo. It was very bland and the portions are very small compared to other actual authentic Mexican restaurants. I guess overall  food is okay but don t go in there thinking it s authentic Mexican food. Oh and if you ask for tamales  just know they are not fresh  they re frozen. We asked for a dozen tamales to go and the lady came back with a frozen bag of tamales  When we asked if they had any fresh ones  the lady said no and she looked at us like if we were crazy for wanting fresh tamales. Don t think we ll be returning again.
La Cocina de Consuelo,89,The food was sooooooo good here  It is definitely some of the best Mexican food I ve had in Austin  I will definitely be going back 
La Cocina de Consuelo,90,First of all  the map seems to incorrectly locate this place next to 46th street. Just walk or drive 20 more yards south and you ll see the place.   Secondly  the tacos here are amazing. I didn t expect this  but it looks more like a burrito. The serving size is more than enough so don t expect to eat two tacos if you re not hungry.   I got the Stacy which had beef  pico and some good stuff  egg and avocado. It was perfect. The end.
La Cocina de Consuelo,91,The day I wrote my last review...literally about an hour after I wrote it actually...I was working on my laptop at one of the few small tables in the place. I d done this on occasion staying maybe for an hour and a half while I enjoyed a gigantic breakfast burrito. On this day  I was approached by an older woman  she may have been the owner   who asked me if I could move outside or leave because  I was clearly looking for a library.  I know this place doesn t advertise as a coffee shop or place to come work  but  up until that point  I had been a loyal customer and brand advocate telling everyone I knew to go try their food. I was embarrassed and thought she was very rude about the whole thing. I had purchased not one  but two burritos over the almost three hours I was there. Not like I was squatting.  Still giving the place a three because I like their food  but I haven t been back since.
La Cocina de Consuelo,92,Total cuteness. So Austin-y. And before I forget--BYOB--which you can t beat with a stick   Before you go  you should check their hours on their website  because they re a tad inconsistent. You should also know that the space is pretty small  so you may have to wait. And a group of more than six might cause some issues  so take the big parties elsewhere .   This is the type of food you would get if you gathered the freshest ingredients  left out the super-heavy Tex-Mex sauces  no disrespect to those   and kept everything as simple as possible. If you expect processed cheese-laiden enchiladas and burritos smothered in queso and chili con carne  this is not your place. On the menu you ll find some thing you might not have seen before  papaya and jicama salad as a side  Fideo  Potato chipotle enchiladas  Everything is made fresh when you order it    If you forget to B your own B - walk across 45th street to the cute corner store where they have a huge selection of beer and wine.
La Cocina de Consuelo,93,Very limited menu  breakfast burritos only served during certain times. Food was alright  not the best.
La Cocina de Consuelo,94,The migas con chorizo are awesome. The family  that runs the place is terrific  and be sure to order extra tortillas to take home because there are none better in the city.  I used to live around the corner and went every weekend. Now I m a little further away but get there when I can.
La Cocina de Consuelo,95,I picked up two dozen tamales today. They were for a company lunch and everyone had positive comments. Spicy but not too spicy. Yummy. Planning to go for lunch some day.
La Cocina de Consuelo,96,Edit  Wed Sept 28. This is now our favorite breakfast place.  We go a few times a week  and are never disappointed.  After trying several breakfast taco burritos  I have created the best ever. It s vegan  but the meat eater husband loves it too. Refried beans  potatoes  pico de gallo  avocado  rajas and salsa in a flour tortilla.  Now  if they would just name it the  Jenny   so that I don t have to list everything when I order it several times a week  that would be perfect.  ..... Homemade tortillas and spicy salsa   i ordered a black bean  potato  avocado breakfast burrito.  it was giant  hung over the plate... yeah  two meals    and tasty simple.  the husband ordered the migas.  it  looked  good  but the orange grease  like chorizo grease  was too much for him.  i can count on one hand in four years the number of times he has left food on a plate  and this was one of them.  he said the migas were okay  but the grease was just gross.  so  a win-lose for he and i at Cocinas.
La Cocina de Consuelo,97,Yes  my precious   I ve always been intrigued by the quaint  red establishment that unassumingly yet happily sits on the corner of Burnet and 45th. On a sunny Sunday morning  I had to find some hearty hangover food for myself.  La Cocina is a stone s throw away from my place  so I finally looked up their menu online and called in my order.    I ordered six breakfast burritos.  There s a reason why they don t call these puppies breakfast tacos.  They are HUGE  but priced as if they were cheap breakfast tacos. How else do I love thee  Consuelo   Let me count the ways   1  They make their wheat  flour  and corn tortillas in house.  The tortillas they hand make are wonderful.  I had all three  and the wheat was the best  and almost had the texture of roti--I imagine some people wouldn t like this  but I loved it. 2  Machacado is an option for breakfast burritos.  I haven t had machacado since Houston   Thank Buddha someone in Austin does it too  3  All of the staff is super friendly.  They always warmly greet you. 4  The breakfast burritos are high quality and made with LUV   The standard is three ingredients w no charge  not two like many stingy places 
La Cocina de Consuelo,98,This is how authentic Mexican should taste. Everything seems to have been made from scratch and has just enough spice as to not trump the meats in the dish.  I wanted to pour the salsa in my pocket and stuff the tortillas in my hat  The folks there are very friendly  love feedback  and want you to leave stuffed. Seriously  check this place out- you won t regret it.
La Cocina de Consuelo,99,Let s see...Mexican cooking done by a woman in more or less her own kitchen  while the food is delivered by what I assume to be her son.   The food is fabulous.  The service is fabulous.  Both people are over-the-top polite.  How can you not support a business like that 
La Cocina de Consuelo,100,BREAKFAST BURRITOS. La Cocina de Consuelo has the absolute best breakfast burritos in existence  They make their own tortillas and salsa  both of which are amazing beyond words. They have them until 11AM and they re SUPER affordable and ULTRA delicious  so go eat them all.
La Cocina de Consuelo,101,Authentic. Inexpensive. Did I say authentic  Great breakfast tacos. Forget trendy Tacodeli  or Torchy s....these are in a different league for less price without the line  or corporate trendiness. Easy parking. A feels like your in Mexico interior. Good for kids. Good for a casual date. Great outdoor space. Actually  it s a screened in porch with ceiling fans. Home made tortillas. Home made everything. Food tastes like my friend s Abuelita s  Grandmother s  home cooking.   I ll never tell her that.  Great daily specials. Mole on Tuesdays  Best Christmas Tamales town...order the in advance and yes you have to wait until late November or early December to do so.
La Cocina de Consuelo,102,Wow  This is amazing  Connie IS THE BEST  The breakfast tacos are amazing and BIG  The homemade tortillas are to die for. I tried the spinach enchiladas and they were great as well. The salsa is fantastic with just the right amount of spice.  Great atmosphere. You can even taste the love in the food    Great food  reasonable price.   IT S also BYOB.
La Cocina de Consuelo,103,Best migas in West Austin. Simple and old school style Migas  fresh made tortillas. Yum.
La Cocina de Consuelo,104,Coming from a Hispanic girl raised in San Antonio  I d have to say that this is the best place I ve ever tried in Austin    Not only does it have that great  hole in the wall  feel  but the food and staff are great  This is the first place in Austin that I ve tried where they make their own tortillas  which are amazing btw. Their salsa-- suuuuper pica but also very good  It s a little on the expensive side as I paid a little over  7 for 2  breakfast burritos  which were normal taco sizes in my book. The only main reason I didn t give them a full 5-stars is because I think their beans could use a little more flavor  i.e. add more lard  bacon grease  etc. . However  that s just me being picky. I m mostly just happy they weren t from a can  If you want REAL Mexican food  take it from a San Antonian  and check this place out.
La Cocina de Consuelo,105,This is why I love Austin. Simply fantastic and authentic food in a hole-in-the-wall sort of place with only about 15 tables. Right along Burnett  you could so easily look right past it.   I was pointed here by fellow Yelpers and truly  thank you guys. My experience at La Cocina de Consuelo today is definitely in my top three for Mexican food   Cervantes of Albuquerque  NM and  Tacos Tierra Caliente in Houston  TX .   When my husband and I came in  we weren t sure what to do so we went up to what was seemingly the order counter - but a very nice gentleman   who was our waiter for the afternoon  pointed us towards a table and asked us to bring menus with us. We chose a nice table along the wall - although their screened patio looked awesome. He came by right away and took our order for drinks and food. From there on out  our drinks  appetizer and food came out in fair succession and our waiter was attentive the entire time...very friendly too.   We ordered a variety of dishes - a chicken soft taco plate for myself with the Nopalito Salad and Mexican Rice  the special of the day for my husband which was the Chile Relleno Plate in chicken with Mexican rice and beans. He ordered a beef crisp taco to the side. We also ordered the Chile con Queso and two iced teas. Let s break this down  shall we   Complimentary chips and salsa  Pretty good. Homemade chips...spicy salsa with an elevator of heat... good.   Chile con Queso - Amazingly wonderful. Included queso with a generous dollop of excellent guacamole in the middle  chiles and green onions throughout the queso itself. Some of the best we ve ever had.   Chicken Soft Tacos - Amazing. Totally in my top two or three tacos I ve ever had. The tortillas were excellent and the meat was not only full of flavor and seasoned well  but tender. All toppings were very fresh as well and this made for a knockout of a taco.   Nopalito Salad  amp  Mexican Rice  The salad was really interesting - full of pickled cactus strips  fresh tomatoes  cilantro and onions topped with cojita cheese... delightful  The rice was fairly good - definitely homemade.   Crispy Beef Taco - I think my husband loved it. It was gone before I looked up from my plate....freshly fried up taco shell and he said the beef was  very well seasoned.   Chile Relleno - Probably the best he has ever had in this style. This was a non-fried huge poblano stuffed with the same moist chicken I had in my tacos  covered in cheese. He finished the entire thing   So... I have a very strong feeling we re going to be coming back here soon - and we re going to be bringing friends. Although we d hate to see this place get busier   for lunch on a Friday people were trickling in and out and it wasn t that busy  we d love to see them sustain  And...sharing great places with friends is what we re all about. So five stars and cheers to La Cocina de Consuelo for a fabulous lunch 
La Cocina de Consuelo,106,I read the excellent reviews and decided to try this place.   Let me explain how it works. You walk in and order your food as well as you pay for your food.  They then  bring it out to your table.  Coffee is on a little table on the side  you get up and get your own coffee.   I don t mind that at all . The food takes a bit so be patient  food is homemade after all.  I truly enjoyed the Chorizo and Egg plate  it had potatoes and beans on the side.  HOMEMADE flour jumbo sized tortillas.   I am a new fan and I plan on returning the next time I am visiting Austin.
La Cocina de Consuelo,107,Don t expect to be able to enjoy a nice margarita or Mexican beer with your meal because they do not serve any alcoholic beverages.  If you order take-out  they do not include chips.  I had beef fajita s that cost around  16.  The flavor was good  but the meat was sliced into very thin and small pieces.  It was barely enough for two fajitas which worked out  I guess  since they only included 2 tortillas in my take-out order.
La Cocina de Consuelo,108,Tried la Cocina for the first time today and I m not going to lie it was really good and they give good portions so you get your penny s worth. I wish the staff had been a little friendlier. Also make sure that if you are dining in   tell them   otherwise I think they ll assume it s to go. I got my order to go but was sitting at a table. Other than that environment is nice and the food is good 
La Cocina de Consuelo,109,The food here is absolutely delicious. You should eat here at least once.  The salsa and tortillas are phenomenal. Portions are smallish for the     but I d pay it every week if the parking weren t so limited.
La Cocina de Consuelo,110,My favorite green chicken enchiladas and fideo in Austin  TX. 5 Stars for this place  They have a small indoor seating  but there s outside seating available as well. Tip  Check the restaurant hours before coming by.
La Cocina de Consuelo,111,Best. Tortillas. EVER  I m a tortilla snob  and I ding Tex-Mex joints for not serving handmade tortillas with their meals. La Cocina literally has a grandma in the back who makes them by hand  as they should be  and she s got a recipe that would make my grandma celosa  Of course this isn t the only reason why I come to La Cocina de Consuelo  but it definitely makes the meal that much more authentic to know that an abuelita is back in the kitchen hand flapping Mexican goodness. But I digress. I ordered migas  as I usually do at most Tex-Mex joints  and Consuelo s was very good yet unique. I say this because the fried corn tortillas were cut in strips and not in squares or triangles  and Consuelo also adds some hearty and flavorful peppers and salsa to really bring out the taste of this Tex-Mex staple. Add a side of charro beans  pappas fritas cut in strips with caf  con leche and I took a brief trip back in time to my abuela s house out in the rancho.
La Cocina de Consuelo,112,Came in with a friend. Having never been here before  we weren t sure if we sat ourselves  or waited for a host. No sign to indicate  so we walked up to the kitchen window. Guy looks at us like we re bothering him.  Hey  how s it going   Blank stare. Alright.  We ve never been here before--do we seat ourselves  or...   There are tables in the back. Find a place  amp  I ll come out and help you in a bit.  Okay...not super friendly  but maybe they re short staffed. Supposedly the food is good--we help ourselves to menus  amp  find a table. About fifteen minutes pass. I m ready to leave  but my buddy says we should give it a few more. Yelp reviews have been overwhelming positive  and it s probably just busy. A busboy passes by  we ask him if there s a waiter--he tells us we should have checked in at the front  but he s sorry about the wait.  I m not sure why we still stuck around  but we were finally waited on  placed an order  and found out coffee is self-serve  which is nice because since service was lacking  at least there wasn t a wait for a refill.  The food was super mediocre. The refried beans were bland  and the beef enchiladas tasted like something you could prep with canned sauce. The tortillas I ordered on the side were enormous though  and though on the thin side for my tastes  were pretty good.   Wouldn t ever come here again. Such a shame. I d hoped to find a good Tex-mex place close to where I live  but alas. It s not to be.
La Cocina de Consuelo,113,The food was good for a Mexican restaurant its more tex me but other than that place is clean and music is soothing I will come back agian if I have a chance
La Cocina de Consuelo,114,The restaurant it s inside a house  looks super cute and has a cozy feeling. They serve authentic Mexican food and they have bottomless ice tea and fresh lemonade and also good prices.   I totally recommend this place 
La Cocina de Consuelo,115,Huge burritos for breakfast   Inexpensive and fast get in and get out.  The mild and medium salsa are hot and hotter   Whew the green salsa woke me up   A little bit goes a long way.  I feel full and satisfied.  Walking through the back door is like walking into my grandparents house and being greeted by a nice family preparing my meal in their home kitchen.  Small place but old school Austin charm.
La Cocina de Consuelo,116,Stopped by here for lunch on my quest to find the best steak burrito in town. After all the great Yelp reviews  I was pretty disappointed with my burrito here. The steak was more like Mongolian beef from a Chinese restaurant. The flavor combination didn t work well. Maybe I ordered the wrong meat  but don t think I ll be back to find out.
La Cocina de Consuelo,117,Stopped in for lunch for business. I small place. Well-kept. Food was delicious I had enchiladas  exquisite.
La Cocina de Consuelo,118,A hidden gem that s for sure  but in some ways it s still a diamond in the rough  the rough-rough. Prices are high - especially for breakfast items and the value isn t there.   -  After many successive weeks of trying to go there on a SATURDAY  they re closed on Sat .  I finally get it into my thick head that I should try on a Sunday.  La Cocina de Consuelo is a small hole-in-the-wall on Burnet near 45th  right next to Upper Crust Bakery.  The parking lot is awkwardly small but we found a spot  of which we were parked in...  but that s another story .  I ve been wanting to eat at LCdC on a personal recommendation about the breakfast tacos  read  breakfast burritos .    NOTE  They don t serve breakfast burritos after 11am.  Strolling in at 11.30 with our post workout hunger and sun drenched glazes we waited no more than five minutes for a table.  Success is 80  showing up and 10  timing .   As a previous reviewer said their salsa is fiery and good  but charging  3-4 for a refill and chips is a bit steep.   After confirming that there were no breakfast burritos in our future  we all unanimously ordered migas plates.   The food was hot and fresh and the homemade tortillas were nice however most of the plate was filled with  filler  beans and potatoes. The eggs which should have been the star of the show were lacking and although we filled up  we wanted a plate of eggs. Not a plate of starches.   Also if you took into consideration the chips that were in the migas I think there  might  have been one egg in there.   Honestly I think I ll be headed to Zocalo or eve Kerbey Ln for my migas next time. Better quality and somehow cheaper.  You can t beat that.  So disappointed after waiting for so long.   LATER .  The other week I stopped in to get some breakfast burritos for my co-workers.  Counter to our previous experience  the burrito was HUGE  but unimaginative and I m not sure what was going on with the bacon but Taco Shack has nothing to be worried about.    Weak bacon and other combinations that were a big yawn.
La Cocina de Consuelo,119,With the number of good breakfast taco places in Austin  I just can t see coming back here.  First of all  though we were the only people in line  no one greeted us for a good 2 minutes as we stood at the counter. Once the guy did  he took our order quickly.  We then waited almost 15 minutes for our order of two burritos and a plate of chilaquiles.  The burritos  egg  bean  avocado and a bacon egg bean  were fine - no especially good seasoning or flavor.  The chilaquiles were sadly lacking any sort of flavor whatsoever - disappointing for something covered in a deep red sauce. The accompanying potatoes were sliced and boiled - no fry or salt  and the beans were what you d expect from a  0.39 can at heb.  Oh and there was a bone in my chilaquiles.   No way to refill tea once the line started going as the refills are with the guy who takes the orders  and with the line at 10 people I decided against asking for my missing tortillas as well - didn t want to slow down service for the remainder of the people here.  Head 7 blocks up for torchy s and get faster service and better food.
La Cocina de Consuelo,120,Saw this place on yelp and had to try. I m from San Antonio so I know what good homemade Mexican breakfast taste like. This place was great   Fresh tortillas and everything we had was wonderful. Had the barbacoa and chorizo taco. Authentic   If you want great tacos  come here  You will not be disappointed.
La Cocina de Consuelo,121,Several visits have amounted to a 1 star review.  My first visit was in 2011  I thought the food overpriced but still good.  Mostly ordered chicken tacos.    Then about 18 months ago I took my man and he ordered 3 beef tacos a la carte.  He was given his bill and said   but wait  the taco plate  the exact same thing  with rice beans added is  2 less    Owner   Yes  but you ordered a la carte - it s more.   Him   can I just change it to the plate  amp  get rice beans       Owner   no you already ordered     We boycotted the restaurant for bad service  but 2 nights ago we tried again and the SAME thing happened again     He orders the 2 cheese enchiladas meal and a crispy taco    11.50 per the menu  but this is also known as a combo plate on their menu and therefore they will only ring it up as such.  Price    13.99.    Anytime you don t side in your customers best interest you are going to lose that customer.  We will never come back which is sad because we live 5 blks away and love to support our hood 
La Cocina de Consuelo,122,Very intimate dining location.  I think its perfect for a date or double date.  Friendly staff  also very helpful if viewing the menu for the first time.  The food is wonderful  some of the best I ve had in Austin.  I can t agree more with Shelly about feeling that you re in someone s kitchen.  I thought it would be awkward  but it was very nice.  I really can t complain about anything apart from serving soda in a can bottle  no free refills   but that is getting picky.  I m also lactose intolerant  which makes eating Mexican food slightly tricky sometimes.  A lot of time I have to filter out the menu to 1 or 2 items and still ask for no cheese.  This place is very tolerable and they have many different options.  It s nice to see such a thorough menu for the tiny restaurant that La Cocina is.
La Cocina de Consuelo,123,Maybe we hit it on a bad day. I  really  wanted to like La Cocina. However  I eat a LOT of Mexican food  amp  tacos in this town  and this place definitely missed the mark  on many fronts.    Location        Super cute place in a great location just off Burnet   45th  near Upper Crust.  Parking        Adequate  but tricky  as the back lot is only accessible via a one-lane driveway. Leads to several stand-offs.   Ambiance     Weird  romantic country songs playing  but otherwise quaint and cozy.   Service         Terrible. There was one  sour dude running the place at lunch time. He was the waiter cashier expediter etc. And he was PISSED. No pleasantries  no chit-chat  which is unnecessary  but surly silence is really off-putting    We ordered take-out  as I had to get back to the house. No offer of water or chips and salsa while we waited for our order. And he seemed to really resent our request for additional salsa after he handed us the plastic bag with our meals.   Food        The most bland  average Mexican food I ve had in the past year. And that includes Mexican food in Ohio. I got a breakfast platter and my boyfriend got the Lunch Special  carne guisada . Neither of us enjoyed any single part of it. The eggs were supposedly cooked with pico  but were completely tasteless. The beans were not even salted. The potatoes were decent once I heated them up and added my own spices. The tortillas were clearly homemade  but perhaps made yesterday  Chewy as all hell and no sense of lightness or pillowy goodness that I would want in my tortilla.   I would perhaps give them one more shot on a morning for a breakfast burrito  but otherwise  this is off the list. There are too many other good places nearby.  I m looking at you  Taco Flats  amp  Taco Joint  
La Cocina de Consuelo,124,I thought I knew good enchiladas. I was wrong.  Cocina De Consuelo had been at the top of my must eat list  yes  I have a list  for about a year. For some reason I didn t make it in until a few weeks ago when my boyfriend and I were hungering on a Saturday morning. He wanted Trudy s  but he must be ecstatic that I steered him in the right direction.  When we first walked into Cocina  I was a bit confused as to what to do. You seat yourself  you get your own coffee  you order at the front.  at least on weekend lunch  Despite the Huevos Rancheros calling out to me  I knew I had to order the Queso Fresco Enchiladas. Boyfriend ordered barbacoa and... something else  I dunno. I don t care.  Sit and get chips and salsa. I loved the salsa. It s not going to win any awards  but it s certainly better than 85  of the salsas you will get... anywhere.It doesn t play- I warn you- If you don t like spice  you will not enjoy it.  Our dishes come out and I just gasp. My enchiladas just... look amazing. Queso fresco in fresh and delicious tortillas covered in ancho chile sauce with my delicious VEGETARIAN refried beans.. Honestly  I m drooling thinking about it. I can t remember the last time I ate something that just looked that amazing. So I take a bite and... that s it. I cannot tell you what made it so amazing.. it just was. Boyfriend is quoted as saying   I don t like enchiladas  but.. oh god..   I ALWAYS devour my Mexican food in salsa. But.. with this dish  I just couldn t. It was too amazing to sully with any other flavor. That is truly a first for me.  My boyfriend s meal was average  but based off of his two bites of my enchiladas  he REALLY wanted to come back next week  and come back we did- With my grandparents the next week. I decided this time to go for the potato enchiladas. Connie is famous for enchiladas  they must also be amazing  right  Eh. They re good.. but nothing compared to the queso fresco. My  grandpa ordered an extremely enticing nightly special- the salmon enchiladas. They looked AMAZING  if not... unique  and he loved them. My boyfriend got the queso enchiladas... and they were  again  godly. Why did I choose something else   This place is amazing. The only warning I would give is that the service has been extremely slow both times I ve visited  because there is one waitress for the entire place  and the portions did not satisfy the men  although  I thought they were perfect .  Note   I overheard the sole waitress say that there is no pork in the entire restaurant and that their refried beans are completely vegetarian friendly.  My recommendation is to come here and order the queso enchiladas  and afterward- as you apparently will most likely not be full- go next door to Upper Crust Bakery and order their chocolate cupcake  the best cupcake in the city . I m truly upset that I ve already experienced this meal so I cannot do it again for the first time.  I m drooling too much to continue writing.
La Cocina de Consuelo,125,Where are the GOOD Mexican restaurants in Austin  because this isn t one.  The carne guisada was more like beef stew and the frijoles refritos had no sabor. First and last time eating at this one.
La Cocina de Consuelo,126,If you want authentic Mexican food. This is your place. Very cozy atmosphere  my partner and I had the best time. And it s BYOB
La Cocina de Consuelo,127,Home-made tortillas  fresh ingredients  delightful fillings  great prices. This is by far my favorite breakfast taco  technically a breakfast burrito but not in this part of the country  place in the Texas Hill Country.  The only minor complaint is that they serve cheap coffee. I would be willing to pay a little more for something better than Folgers or grocery store brand.  Try the taco with avocado - to die for  It will keep you full of energy all the way to lunchtime.
La Cocina de Consuelo,128,When I walk in  I feel like mi abuela will come rushing towards me  grab me into a big warm hug  and immediately plop a heaping plate of deliciousness into my hands while saying  Eat  Eat  You re too skinny    But alas  I have no abuela  I m a Czech German gal...with a few extra curves to spare  but La Cocina de Consuelo is the next closest thing. Whipping up fabulous migas  homemade flour tortillas  spicy hot salsa  enchiladas  crispy tacos  and THE BEST TORTILLA SOUP in town -- all in a tiny kitchen in small cast-iron skillets and pots. This is by far the most authentic Mexican food you ll find in town.
La Cocina de Consuelo,129,I won t be returning here. Just wasn t good. I tried the Chicken Milanese Torta and the Juevos Rancheros. The torta meat was really gamey  tasted a little like road kill honestly  and the Juevos Rancheros was so so. Beans  I ve had better and the allotment was less than generous.  The salsa was good  But that is really the only thing going for it.   The atmosphere is quaint  but they turned off the music 30 minutes closing and the whole place was awkwardly silent. It was as if they were telling us to leave. Wasn t the friendliest of environments  and I think that could be easily changed.  There is potential here  so hopefully they step it up.
La Cocina de Consuelo,130,I found my new Sunday brunch spot  and this is it.  Have to say  hot damn  Their salsa has a serious kick to it  and one of the regular customers even commented that it was hotter than usual. I hope on subsequent visits they keep the level of  hotness  up. Someone made the comment that the chips are bland  but that s fine with me since it would just get in the way of the incredible salsa.  The huevos rancheros plate I ordered came out within 5 minutes along with two flour tortillas. These are best consumed while still hot because they harden up quite a bit if they sit for too long. The re-fried beans were standard fare and the eggs cooked just the way I like them.  This plate is nearly identical to one served over at La Guadalupana Bakery and Cafe in Houston  which means it is excellent.  I like the fact this place is busy  but not so busy you can t get your food fix quickly.
La Cocina de Consuelo,131,I loved the breakfast taco so much I went back for their lunch. Everyday they have a different special. I will be making this place a regular stop. They make all of their own tortillas and even have wheat.
La Cocina de Consuelo,132,We have been twice for a weekday dinner and both meals were awesome    For me  it s all about the tacos and enchiladas. The food is incredibly fresh and the flavors are amazing  Among the best I ve had in recent times. It almost feels like you are at someone s house and they are serving you grandma s best.  They do not serve alcohol  but you can BYOB.   Love this place   
La Cocina de Consuelo,133,Three words  TRES. LECHES. FLAN. This dessert of a wonder is a fusion between the famous Mexican Cake and Custard combined. Not too sweet  with almost a Creme Brulee kick. The handmade corn tortillas taste just like home. Two thumbs up  WAY UP   
La Cocina de Consuelo,134,You guys have to eat here  It s kind of a hole in he wall and the service is odd because at first they re a little rude but then they have a change of heart while you re eating  It s weird but who cares because this food is GOOOOOOD.  I had jicama and mango salad  fideos and Picadillo. I had heard great things about the place but lost a lot of faith after seeing the interior but damn the salad was SO crisp and surprisingly fresh and the picadillo was incredibly flavorful given it was essentially just potatoes and ground beef.   I no longer work in that hood otherwise I would go regularly. Apparently their breakfast burritos are legendary.
La Cocina de Consuelo,135,The tortilla soup and avocado taco was exceptional. Homemade tortillas were delish. Fidel was great as well as the limeade. Atmosphere was cozy and felt right at home.
La Cocina de Consuelo,136,This place is one of those small hole in the wall locally own places you would find throughout any border town. The restaurant is small and reminds me of my grandmas small kitchen dining area. With that said taking large parties here would not be the best thing  anywhere over a party of 4 would be hard to manage with the limited area tables.   The one item that won me over was the home made tortillas.Both corn and flour homemade tortillas here were great and completed the authenticity of a true Mexican restaurant.   I tried the Huevos a la Mexicana  great breakfast dish at a reasonable price.
La Cocina de Consuelo,137,New favorite Tex Mex in Austin. Quaint little shop with only a few tables. The sweetest woman took care of us. If you are a fan of delicious and SPICY salsa  then this place is a grand slam. Enchiladas were superb. I cannot say enough. More people need to eat here 
La Cocina de Consuelo,138,I Really Like This Place  Simple  Carefully Prepared  Interior Mexico Food  Flavorful HOT sauce  muy picante   Fresh  hand made corn tortillas  dense  not the flabby lard laced ones  Authentic mole  The plates and plating show me the kitchen cares about their food and its presentation.  ...and big bonus - I eat my lunch on a shaded screened porch absent central Austin s archetypal menagerie of techies talking shop  hipsters and posers.  I Shall Return 
La Cocina de Consuelo,139,Hubby and I come here from time to time. I like their food  but I found the menu to be a bit limited  so I don t come here often as I get bored fast eating the same thing. Everything I had here had been good. I had Pollo ala Monterey the last time I came here. It was darn good and spicy. Usually  other places have their verde sauce really mild. La Cocina s verde sauce had a kick. My favorite side is always the mango jicama salad. Hubby let me had a taste of the cactus salad. It s good but not for me.  -   On our last visit  we dragged our two kids here for dinner. It turned out they thought this place was cool  decent food and bright colors everywhere. They gave their thumbs up.
La Cocina de Consuelo,140,We went here yesterday for the first time  even though I have lived in this area long before this place opened.  We were so impressed   The servers were all super friendly and responsive and the food is absolutely delicious.  Best fresh squeezed lemonade I have found here  and the crispy beef tacos and chicken tomatillo enchiladas were fantastic   The salsa was a bit too spicy for my palate  but my pepper loving husband and his buddy loved it.  And the jicama mango salad is definitely worth paying the extra buck for  so good   We will be back  and often 
La Cocina de Consuelo,141,It was OK. Not great  not terrible. Just Ok.  I love that they have handmade tortillas but most of the food was lacking in flavor.
La Cocina de Consuelo,142,Food is tasteless  and really bad service. Make sure you ask for a bottle drink or they ll give you foucet water.  8 breakfast plate    It s not about the money  but for that much I would have gone to La Madeline. Don t waste you money here. I wanted to leave no star but you can t.
La Cocina de Consuelo,143,Authentic  delicious  and local  this friendly house really does feel like you are being fed from the heart directly from Connie s kitchen.   The small house is simple and cute.  The tortilla chips are my favorite in Austin  seriously .  I recommend whatever she has on special or Tacos Al Pastor.
La Cocina de Consuelo,144,Definitely fresh mexican food.   We got there at 11 15 am and there weren t anymore breakfast burritos...It was our first time there and I really wanted the tacos since they claim to be the best in town. Are burritos here considered tacos  I m a little confused   Anyways  we had   chorizo plate huevos mexicano plate and chilaquiles plate  Chorizo plate I tried and it was good  It wasn t greasy like other mexican restaurants. I would get this is I went back. Huevos mexicano plate was also tasty. Chilaquiles plate -- I ordered and wasn t satisfied. It looked like chopped beef on a plate. The chicken was good but it wasn t my favorite.  Restaurant was VERY SMALL  Also  if you haven t been  you walk in and pick up a menu at the front. Then go sit down. If you want coffee  go to the coffee station and get it yourself. The waiter was a little rude when I didn t know the logisitics of the restaurant and that you get your own coffee....All other drinks  you order with the waiter.   I ll be back to try the tacos...or should I say burritos  Can someone let me know if burritos here   breakfast tacos  Thanks 
La Cocina de Consuelo,145,Some people throw around the phrase  best breakfast tacos  a little too casually  I m not that person. I take my breakfast tacos seriously and am highly critical of them  see  review of Bob and Mike s  so when I say that Cocina de Consuelo has the breakfast tacos  I m not kidding. The foundation of a good taco is a homemade tortilla and hers are to die for. The wheat ones are my favorite  they are so amazing and thick and tasty that it s hard to believe that are wheat. I always get potato  egg and avocado but really  anything you put inside is delicious. Then  finish it off with her homemade super spicy salsa and I m in breakfast taco heaven   But wait  there s more  Ha  Not only are the tacos delish  but her enchiladas are incredible. Seriously. Eat them there  get them to go  eat them in a boat  eat them in the snow  it doesn t matter  they are amazing.
La Cocina de Consuelo,146,There are two things you need to know   1  This is the tiniest restaurant in Austin. 2  It s BYOB.   The food is delicious. I had the Al Pastor tacos and my date had the spinach  amp  mushroom enchiladas. The fresh-squeezed limeade was awesome  but needed the tequila I didn t realize I should have brought. Next time we re bringing our own drinks.   Seriously  this place is comically small. The wait-staff will bump into you repeatedly as a matter of course. But a very fun little spot  highly recommended.
La Cocina de Consuelo,147,Breakfast burritos are the best.  You can customize it for pick from the local list.  They are quick and everything is made fresh in house.  I need to go back for dinner 
La Cocina de Consuelo,148,It s hard to please my Mom and Dad with Mexican food  but this they loved  The reason for only 4 stars is because there was only one guy doing the serving and maybe even the cooking so it took a long time to get out food and refill our drinks. We will be back 
La Cocina de Consuelo,149,La Cocina De Consuelo is a family owned  amp  operated quaint brunch shop in North Central Austin.  The location is a bit out of the way for the typical downtown crowd  which is what i LOVE about it  Sometimes there is a wait  but the food is so authentic and succulent that it is worth the wait. Yes  I said succulent  and if that s what you re looking for  try the barbacoa   I usually go for the chilequiles myself  but I always make the hubby share his meal with me so that we can taste eachother s and get a sample of everything.  The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is quaint and cute. Always be prepared for a wait...that way you are surprised if there isn t one  amp  not disappointed if there is a short one 
La Cocina de Consuelo,150,This place is uniquely good  go here for some breakfast and basically build your own burrito - well made to order that is.  But the taste is so fresh and different you could stop liking other Mexican food.  The price is right  but it s not always open when I need it. Horrible parking.
La Cocina de Consuelo,151,The Migas were by far the worst I ve ever had.  The beans had no flavor  the potatoes were greasy  and the homemade tortillas were disappointing. East Austin still has the best Mexican breakfast. Seemed like a lot of people were ordering burritos so maybe that s the way to go.
La Cocina de Consuelo,152,I came back  Austin is lacking decent breakfast spots that dont make you crap yourself and pray for death. La Cocina is always fresh  and if you stick to a 3 item burrito and tea like me its affordable for the most dihard cheapa   like myself. And the mexican muzak is top shelf 
La Cocina de Consuelo,153,A solid 9 10 for authentic Mexican food    Randomly decided to go for lunch with my dad. Their homemade lemonade was delicious. And they had limes to offer with my soup and tacos instead of lemons which is a plus to gauge how authentic they are. The salsa that came with the chips was delicious and spicy    As a half Mexican who grew up in San Antonio  a city with superior Mexican food  I say not bad  not bad at all.   Only thing  their menu could stand to have a little more variety. And perhaps more aguas frescas.
La Cocina de Consuelo,154,Tiny lil place  6 tables. Everything was outstanding. Green salsa - hot and flavorful. Carni Quisada was the best I ve had  accompanied by a perfect cactus salad and black beans. Topped off with the best  creamy tres leche this side of the border. Really  I couldn t ask for better. Paid for by my daughters well mannered BF  to a dad that definitely means a lot  Ole   Really  this should be at the top of your must try list.     no booze license is the only negative.
La Cocina de Consuelo,155,The server here today was horrendous. The place itself is tiny  maybe 6-8 tables and it was not fully occupied when we arrived at 11 30am for lunch. He brought water  literally threw the menus on the table and turned and walked away. Ok      He comes back  asks if we were ready to order  we did and again  immediately turns and walks away. Didn t even ask if we d like anything other to drink than water  which we did . Brought our food  placed it rather harshly on the table and left without one word. My husband spoke up and said he d like a coke and I would like a Dr. Pepper. He mumbled really fast and annoyed and asked if we wanted ice. Huh   We were like  yeah      and he turns quickly away. Bottom line  this dude might have been the only worker in the place. It seemed as much  but seriously. Just a hint of friendliness would have gone a LONG way. Beyond that  the food was disappointing. It wasn t inedible  I had enchiladas  which was way better than the dry burrito my husband got. Heaven forbid he would have asked for some sour cream. I think the server would have spit in it  he was that intense. So  yeah. So much for trying somewhere different. We must have really come on an off day.
La Cocina de Consuelo,156,My first time there. I really liked it. Very small tho  make sure you go when there is no one there because you will enjoy it better. Good food.
La Cocina de Consuelo,157,GREAT TACOS. It was my first time heading down and I didn t regret it. These homemade tortillas are bomb  Best little restaurant for tacos . I deff will be trying some other stuff they offer
La Cocina de Consuelo,158,I love love love this place.  I can t say enough about how much I love their food.  Everything just tastes so fresh and not greasy. As a vegetarian I have a lot of options and I am mildly obsessed with queso fresco and the potato enchiladas.  The queso is also top notch and you can tell is made from real cheese.  This a must try and will definitely become your favorite 
La Cocina de Consuelo,159,Delicious Food.  Just like my grandmothers home cooking.
La Cocina de Consuelo,160,My wife is originally from Mexico City and her mother is a very good cook  so went in with a high bar.  I was pleasantly surprised to find The torta Milanesa and Sopa Fideo at La Cocina.  These are two dishes that her madre does very well  so I had to get the plate.  My wife got the tortilla soup with side crunchy taco.  The sandwich was delicious and surprisingly not too filling and the sopa Fideo was good.  My wife s tortilla soup was very very good  but the taco was ok.  All in all  a very satisfying lunch.  Service was kinda haphazard but not the worst.  All in all  a nice start...will definitely be back for another lunch to further explore the menu.
La Cocina de Consuelo,161,absolutely blown away on how delicious their food is. i can t wait to go back and try more options. my entire family enjoyed their meal  amp  they are hard to impress when it comes to authentic mexican food
La Cocina de Consuelo,162,I ve been back here a few times recently and I have a new rave. Drumroll please. MY FAVORITE QUESO IN AUSTIN LIVES HERE.  After eating many quesos across Austin  I have given La Cocina s Queso the crown. My friend ordered one for the table  with a dollop of fresh guacamole in the middle. Cheesy heaven. The cheese was a little bit smoky  smooth  mixed with tiny slices of jalepeno and onion. If you wanna clog your system with delicious queso  you should do it in style here.  Also  the Friday special  salmon enchiladas in avocado sauce  is delicious to the last forkful. Be sure to come out on a Friday to try it.
La Cocina de Consuelo,163,This place makes me want to quit my IBM day job and put my mom in the back kitchen to make migas for hung over Austinites.  I stopped in here before rehab  the knee kind not the Amy Winehouse kind  to grab some breakfast burritos and damn they were good.  Their salsa was out of this world and the single reason that I will return every time I m in the neck of these woods.  And no I m not trying to steal their recipe for salsa so I can open my own north location La Cocina de Madi  so stop your accusations.  But don t be suprised if you re invited to the 2019 grand opening.  See ya IBM 
La Cocina de Consuelo,164,While visiting Austin  we were told to get breakfast burritos because that was all the rage. I googled  best breakfast burritos in Austin  and Concina was number one on one of the first lists we came across. I can totally see why. The tiny restaurant looked to be a house once  but it was perfect.  The home made tortillas were so soft and delicious. Unlike any tortillas I ve ever had. The chorizo  potato  and egg filling was just right. The flavors were all balanced and not over powering one another. It was THE perfect breakfast burrito.  My boyfriend ended up having to get himself a second burrito because he was so impressed and really wanted to try one with black beans in it. I tried the second burrito  too  and it was delicious. The people who sat down next to us both got two burritos each. Everyone who came through knew exactly how and what to order  which was really awesome to see.  If I m back in Austin any time in the near future  I will come back for sure. I would even buy extra burritos and freeze them 
La Cocina de Consuelo,165,I only get to Austin once a year  but head here every time.  I m not exactly an early bird  but the time I made breakfast here I ll never forget... and all the other times with the later in the day menu were good too.  Get there before 11AM for their breakfast burrito menu    The tortillas is what everyone remembers best- hand made  with an amazing thick just out of the oven texture. You won t find better tortillas anywhere  I promise. The variety of breakfast burritos is great  and everything feels home cooked with good ingredients.  I know they re not breakfast tacos  which have a special place for Austinites  but this is the best Tex Mex I ve had in town  period. And if you get a chance to meet the owner  you ll be meeting the heart of the place  and it s obviously a labor of love. Also  remember it s closed Saturday    
La Cocina de Consuelo,166,Hands down the best queso in Austin.  Connie blends delicious cheeses  strips of green chilies and chipotle peppers together to create a most heavenly dish.  I would like to bathe in it myself.  Get the queso with the scoop of guacamole.  It is a wonderful combination with the cheeses and chilies plus it cools down the smoke of the chipotles.  During our last visit  I had the queso fresco enchiladas in chile ancho sauce and they tasted like those I used to eat in Mexico.  Oh Connie...where have you been all my life 
La Cocina de Consuelo,167,I m throwing down the a       card with this review. It feels like perhaps most reviewers don t want to break Consuelo s heart or stomp on her dreams- but this restaurant is seriously lacking.   The salsa wasn t tomato based  strong roasted chile flavor and worth the extra dollar to keep it flowing.   The chipotle potato enchiladas were seasoned and decent the sauce stood out the most  and the refried beans were tasty while the rice was blander than bland.   The flautas were a DISASTER. They came out  and the expectations were high based on the flavorful salsa. The first bite  beyond the crunchy tortilla  was a monstrosity of beef fat not of the enjoyable sort  and charred beef  that tasted like it had been stewing in the bottom of a deep fryer that has been neglected of the cleaning it necessitates for clean greasy goodness. I was expecting home-style flautas that I grew up with in the valley- beef that has been stewed with onions and chiles and tomatoes- just the building of flavors and salty juicy amazingness. Not delivered here. NO flavor was delivered here..not even  beef     If you re going to make fideo- use vermicelli noodles and toast caramelize them the way they re supposed to be done. Don t give me spaghetti noodles that are completely untoasty and floating in a flavorless broth.  I hate to hate  but there was nothing genuine about our meal except Consuelo herself.   I really just felt had- as though I paid ten dollars a person to support this charming woman s beautiful story of following her dream- not for good eating. I ll be back but just to try the breakfast..will update my review based on that experience.
La Cocina de Consuelo,168,The great  It s cheap   The OK  The food itself. My egg  avocado and black bean  breakfast burrito  was actually two corn tortillas  open-faced  with a generous amount of spongy  chunky egg  a scoop of bland black beans and three slices of avocado on top. The salsa was pretty delicious  but it wasn t quite enough to make up for the funny egg texture and the overall blandness of the food. My friend s potato  egg and cheese  burrito  had considerably less filling  but still a meal-sized portion.  The not-so-good  It s HOT  I m not sure if their air conditioning wasn t working or they just don t have it  but the two ceiling fans and one upright fan weren t cutting it in the tiny dining area.  The woman behind the counter was decidedly unhelpful when my friend and I asked about the burritos -- given that they cost  2.25 apiece  we weren t sure whether we ought to order two  as we would with breakfast tacos  or one  if it were something more like a giant Tex-Mex burrito  but she just said   It s a burrito.    It was definitely NOT like any burrito I ve ever seen  actually  but it was fine when we weren t expecting much.  Will I be back  Possibly. It gets such good reviews I feel like I must have been missing something. Perhaps the lunch menu is better. But for breakfast  Not likely.
La Cocina de Consuelo,169,So maybe she warned me that the salsa was spicy  but you never really know what one persons version of spicy was.  This was spicy  not so much that you couldn t eat it  but enough that you felt like a man for doing so   The enchiladas were also very good.  Didn t wait to long and when they came out the plate was hot and full of food.  I enjoyed mine  the lady enjoyed hers  and we both agreed that the atmosphere was fantastic.  Not the best I have had  but price   value   portions   ambiance   flavor still   a great stop.
La Cocina de Consuelo,170,This is a terrific little joint with beyond-surprisingly good Mexican food.  We dropped by for dinner last night.  Since they ve only been serving dinner for about a month  there weren t any other customers eating at the time.  Walking in felt like we were going over to someone s home for dinner.  The ambiance is what it is...an old house converted into restaurant.  Simple furniture.  That s pretty much it.   Oh  but the food   Everything is handmade by Connie  who got her start catering for some famous Austin residents like Laura Bush and Ann Richards.  We ordered the beef fajita tacos and green chile enchilada.  Both of the dishes were fresh and served steaming hot.  The prices were reasonable  although not dirt cheap.  The wife liked the mango salad and I did try something new as a side dish  cactus salad.  I thought it was good  but just as our waiter warned me  expect a somewhat sour taste that takes some by surprise.    A couple of things about this place that I wished were different are  their portions are somewhat on the small side  was just right for the wife  not quite enough for me  and their menu was also somewhat small.  But these were not enough to take a star off  given how good the food was.  Overall  give this place a try if you re wanting real Mexican food  at a higher level than the numerous taquerias around town.
La Cocina de Consuelo,171,Anyone who knows me knows that Queso is my  trapped on a desert island  food.  And my  fair game celebrity list   you know the list  includes Claire Danes  Julia Stiles  and Polvos Queso   not in that order .  In fact  rarely do I come across a golden-haired beauty that won t captivate me and reduce me to the human equivalent of grunts and drools.  Frankly it s not a big jump from where I normally exist... but I digress.  So suffice it to say that anything that can garner my attention in the face of Queso is a big deal.  And while Connie s Queso was delicious  with a huge dollop of fresh guac in the middle ... I couldn t stop eating her salsa... my new favorite salsa in town.  Summary   sorry Claire Danes  there s no longer room on  the list  for you.
La Cocina de Consuelo,172,I have no idea why I have yet to review this place. Go on Wednesdays for the chicken mole. Barbacoa breakfast burritos are phenomenal  Finding a table inside can be tricky at lunch sometimes since it s such a small place but it sure is worth the wait  I m originally from El Paso  so it is hard to impress me with the so called Mexican food in Austin  but this place hit the nail on the head. Tastes like home
La Cocina de Consuelo,173,I can t think of another so-called  Mexican  restaurant that deserves five stars as much as Consuelo s cooking does. We were on our way to P. Terry s for dinner when we drove past Consuelo s. Husband pointed jokingly and said  Let s eat there  . I took a glance and was unsure if it really was somewhere to eat. After I said  YES    he went around the block and parked. Now  parking is scarce here  as is the seating.  We walked in and were amazed that we were basically eating in the living room of a house. This didn t deter us  because we re believers in  the smaller the kicthen  the better the food . Boy were we right.  There s about 5  6 tables. Only one seats up to six people  but they have no issue with putting tables together to accommodate more. Just a fair warning though     We sat down and the waitress  I like to call her Consuelo s assistant  could tell this was our first time. She explained the specials and what was really good  although I m sure EVERYTHING is good  . She brought us chips and we ordered the Queso Especial. DEEELISH   Husband and Kiddo went with the usual water  I ordered the lemonade. DUDES  THIS IS REAL LEMONADE  At least  the way my Mom and  Abuelita  and pretty much any Mexican  make it. This was HEAVEN   We placed our order  I went with the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo on top. I LOVE how you can order sides instead of having to forcifully get rice and beans. I got the refried beans  I am convinced only my Mom has mastered the art of making amazing refried beans  and the mango and jicama salad. MANGO AND JICAMA SALAD  Y ALL   There s about six different sides you can order besides the usual rice and beans. AMEN TO THAT   I also ordered the kid s flauta for my son. He s as picky as they get  so this was truly a test.  Our food didn t take very long  which in other restaurants that seats about 50-100  would be a bit concerning. Seeing as how we were only one of 3 tables  it was only logical. Everything looked beautiful.   We carefully dug into our food  as if eating anything impeccably would ruin the deal. After our first few bites  it was on like Donkey Kong. My chicken enchiladas were out of this world. They reminded me of the ones my Abuelita would make. With each bite  I was taken back to my summers in Mexico and the grandiose dinners my aunt and Abby would make each night. Each bite bursted with the same love  care and taste as the food from the country I haven t visited in 3 years.   I ALMOST CRIED. CRIED BECAUSE NEVER AGAIN DID I THINK I WOULD EVER EAT FOOD AS GOOD AS MEXICO S  as GOOD as my Grandmother s    HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. It took everything in me to not run to the kitchen and hug Consuelo. This woman makes the SAME food as my familia en Mexico makes.  Greasy  NO  It was incredibly hard to find anything greasy at all   Everything was absolutely perfecto  They even have vegetarian options. The beans aren t cooked with lard or pork  so no worries there   OH LORD  THE FLOUR AND CORN TORTILLAS ARE THE EXACT SAME TEXTURE AND TASTE AS THE ONES IN MEXICO. Handmade from scratch tortillas. FINALLY   When we visit other  Mexican  joints  our stomachs and colons are usually ninja-kicking our innards by the next morning. Saturday morning  we had no stomach issues. Another BIG plus   You can guarantee on finding my husband  son and I sitting here every Friday night. It has become our staple. If you see me crying  it s because the food is truly well made and delicious and bringing me back memories I thought were always going to be that... memories. Now  I can relive those memories every Friday night.  Take it from a Mexican  Visit Consuelo s... you will NOT regret it 
La Cocina de Consuelo,174,Connie s tortillas are to die for. Seriously  I ve had dreams about them. I have never had a better homemade tortilla...it s almost pastry-like. And when you fill its giant warmth with black beans  cheese and avocado  you have my favorite breakfast taco  actually burrito  in Austin.   All the food is fresh  authentic and made-to-order with love.
La Cocina de Consuelo,175,If there were more than 5 stars  Connie  the owner  would receive them   I work near this  mexican kitchen  where everything is made fresh and made to order.  I have never had   1  a better breakfast taco  and I am hard to please in this arena because well  they are typically UNhealthy   2  a happier experience talking with Connie  who is usually making something from scratch in a very visible spot.  3 more excitement when I am eating the actual taco  and my favorite would be  the WHOLE WHEAT  only way to go  with egg  turkey bacon  the only kind  with avocado    MMMMM  The cactus salad is ok  and I really haven t tried anything else because I really am not into enchiladas  burritos  or tamales.  So  I guess when it comes to rating a mexican place 5 stars  it is an exception to my rules        Go before 11 to get breakfast tacos and they just opened for the evening 
La Cocina de Consuelo,176,The food was not that good if you ask me. The waiter was rude as hell even after we said it was our 1st time here. You would think they would want to provide great customer service to keep us coming back. The only good part was the coffee witch you have to serve yourself. It was also over priced. I would tell people to stay a way from this place
La Cocina de Consuelo,177,I love it when grandmas make me food. It feels very close to home I suppose. This place has a very nice atmosphere and felt very comfortable. I initially came for the breakfast tacos  which are actually burritos  so don t be fooled. I felt the breakfast burritos were slightly expensive  but they were bigger than I thought and filled me up pretty well. There are too many different combinations for the burritos  so just check out the menu... or  you can check out her recommended  favorites   which are helpful.   Connie the owner grandma  makes her own torts  which makes it all the better  although I kinda wish the tortillas weren t so hard  but they were good.   I went back for lunch and had the barbacoa  which was good. I also had the fideo as a side  which I was a bit surprised to see that it was in the form of a noodle-soup and not dry like I usually see fideo. It wasn t bad though.   The cactus napolita sp   salad was a bit strange. I never had cactus prior to this  so I have nothing to compare it to. It did have a sour taste as another person mentioned.   Definitely give this place a try  although you may want to battle for a parking spot  or you can sneak over to Upper Crust s parking lot... shhhh. If you do feel bad about using their parking lot  you can go there for dessert. mmm. dessert.
La Cocina de Consuelo,178,Whoever said that the tortillas are good has a gift for understatement - they are the best I ve had.  Please tell me I m wrong so I can try your place.  Grilled veggies were exceptional. Lots of folks were rocking the soft tacos but I loved the crispy ones. If you don t get the flan for dessert you missed an amazing treat.  Call me a Nor easterner that doesn t know Mexican food but I know what I like and Connie s rocks.  We ll be back again on future trips.
La Cocina de Consuelo,179,This is another one of Burnet Road s hidden gems. Everyone is right about the tortillas. They are homemade and very good. I ve been here several times but only for breakfast. The migas are tasty and I also suggest trying their breakfast burritos  only served till 11am on weekends . The restaurant also has a cute outdoor patio. The place is small but that s what makes it feel homey and like I m really eating in Consuelo s Kitchen. Also  there is more parking in the back of the restaurant.
La Cocina de Consuelo,180,This place was terrible the waitress took a long time to take our order she told us she would come back to bring us plates we had to go up and ask for plates for the appetizers because she took so long and when it came to charging us she overcharged us  13 for the combo plate when the plate was originally  8.50 I will never go to this place again
La Cocina de Consuelo,181,Holy moly  little did I know that this teeny tiny joint would surprise me so.  Decided on this place after doing a yelp search to find a new breakfast taco joint on my way into work. I took a chance upon years and years of passing by this place.   So I walk in and go up to the counter to order.  Me   2 potato egg and cheese please   Him  That ll be  5   Thinks to me self  ooh that a little steep  but oh well.   Let me repeat  little did I know. After a few minute wait  I was presented with this bag of 2 huge burrito sized breakfast tacos. And for only  2.50 a piece  what a steal    So good  so good  The tortilla  I believe was made in house. It was thick and warm and held the pillowy goodness inside of it.   I definitely could only finish off one breakfast burrito but had the other for lunch and it was well worth it 
La Cocina de Consuelo,182,I went here once hoping to get some breakfast tacos.  And someone to notice that I was there and  to take my order.  I didn t get either.  And that was my first visit.  I went back with my husband.  Never got seated.  Again.  I don t know how this place stays in business.  Maybe their food is amazing.  I ll never know because NO ONE GAVE A SH T  to so much as look up at me  serve me or try to help me at all   I didn t go in there expecting service like I was at a 4 star place  just average stuff like don t act pissed off that I asked to see a menu or don t make me ask you if I can be seated to eat here  etc.
La Cocina de Consuelo,183,A Hershey s bar in my chicken     This quaint little Mexican house offers some pretty solid food  but it doesn t have that authentic character of a taqueria.  Nonetheless  it s pretty delicious and moderately priced.  Though you won t get as big of portions for the price  you get some great flavored stuff for under  10.  For dinner at least  it s more of a sit-down restaurant with a menu and what not.  Not nitty-gritty tacos-to-go style.    The chicken mole special at  8.99 came with 2 sides  and sadly not a lot of meat.  The mole was definitely some of the best I ve had.  Though I found a huge chunk of cocoa in my sauce  most of the sauce was nicely prepared  with the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  Chicken was super tender.  Beans were nothing special  but good.  Tortillas were freakishly fresh.  Just baked  they had crispy edges and soft centers.  Awesome.    Overall  not too good of a value  as other Mexican food will run you less  but delicious  regardless.
La Cocina de Consuelo,184,While breakfast tacos in this town are a dime a dozen  these breakfast burritos are something special. Let s start with the tortillas  honest to goodness  these are the best I ve had  ever. The chorizo  avocado  cheese  egg and potato burrito covered in the homemade salsa will have you coming back for more.
La Cocina de Consuelo,185,I love this place  it s a tiny family owned Mexican restaurant. This place probably has about 6 or seven tables it really feels like you are actually at someone s house it s really neat I must say finding a place that makes their own tortillas is hard to come by and this place makes fresh tortillas daily. They have a small menu but everything is really good they open at seven serve breakfast and lunch and close at 3 and reopen for dinner at six. They also have breakfast tacos and burritos available until 10 if you are looking for a quick in and out. I was really impressed with this place and continue to be and I have been a frequent customer. However the server that works most of the time is far from friendly he is actually kinda rude  thankfully the woman who owns the place is really nice and the food is awesome so that kinda makes up for the rude service. This place deserves 5 stars but the rude service just doesn t allow it.
La Cocina de Consuelo,186,I had pretty high expectations when I came here based on reviews I read  but it was just ok.  The food wasn t bad  but it wasn t spectacular either.  I believe I had the chicken mole with the nopales salad and the fideo.  Mole was decent but the fideo was not so great.  The fideo didn t look or taste anything like fideo I ve had before.  I just tasted like a bland pasta salad.  Servings were a little on the small side too.   The place is pretty small and cozy  but was empty when I had lunched here.  Service was really good-the staff are really nice.  I will probably come back to try other dishes to see how they compare to the one I ve tried.
La Cocina de Consuelo,187,I m from Houston and this was my first time here. I ordered the Milanese torta and my boyfriend ordered the huevos con chorizo  the food was fresh and delicious . The coffee was so good and the homemade tortillas were on point   It s a very small restaurant   a great place to eat and run  The waiter was very serious with no personality   no people skills. Other than that I would def come back or recommend to others 
La Cocina de Consuelo,188,Virgin review and I could not pick a better place to start. I hail from southern California where we have a certain expectation of Mexican food ... and it is not Tex-Mex. I have been searching all over Austin for the type of food that reminds me of home and I finally found it here.   The ambiance - like being in your grandma s house while she is cooking for you in the other room. The food - Fresh tortillas  incredible enchiladas  and yes oh yes breakfast BURRITOS. The biggest thing I miss from home. Don t get me wrong I will throw down my fair share of breakfast tacos but nothing screams socal louder than a breakfast burrito.  We were lucky enough to roll in when they had tamales for Christmas too. We bought 40    and they lasted 2 days.  Nuff said.
La Cocina de Consuelo,189,Went for a breakfast taco-  burrito . I wanted whole wheat burrito with the stuffing of black beans  cheese and avocado since I am vegetarian. Stuffing in the taco was generously proportioned and full .I  was quit satisfied with the food I got. My hunger was satisfied.
La Cocina de Consuelo,190,Amazing new find  for us  on Burnet Rd  Thanks Yelpers for again steering us in the right direction for a great addition to our bfst repertoire.   The burritos are fabulous  you get 3 items included for a mere  2.50  And choice of homemade tortilla  we went for the wheat  very good and chewy . Fresh avocado doesn t count as an extra ingredient. just loved this place  including the local favorites listed on the wall in case you are too foggy to make your own ideas up in the early morning. Must try for a dinner or lunch next time.
La Cocina de Consuelo,191,Great customer service  great food  and the people are amazing  I recommend this place if you re looking for an authentic Mexican food. Thanks Sandra for being awesome...
La Cocina de Consuelo,192,I usually eat here at breakfast here. FRESH corn tortillas with a huge portion which is why they are a bit pricy. You can add a wealth of different things to your taco including nopalitos  avacado  machacado. . ..not a big place at all but i ve never had a problem being able to sit down.   A literal family business the same woman consuelo  is cooking everyday. The freshness of the food  seems to beat out other places that are comparable. . not greasy... . just plain good food.  Their salsa is HOT. yes    I ve only eaten tostados for lunch because they are a staple part of my diet. I plan on trying out some of their lunch specials soon.  eat here at night and have the tacos al pastor... .. wow  delicious
La Cocina de Consuelo,193,Connie is an amazing cook and SO nice. This place is by far the best place for so many good tex-mex food. The food is really made with love  with care taken in every subtle detail  from the handmade tortillas to the salsa  queso  enchiladas  desserts  etc.  etc. I wake up dreaming of the breakfast burritos  my favorite is potatoes  eggs and avocado   but sometimes struggle with my decision of morning dish because the migas are also damn good. Best migas outside of my kitchen I would say.   As for dinner  kudos to that as well. The queso is the best I ve had in Austin  and the enchiladas are just as good as everyone says. My boyfriend got their taco salad  which was really delicious. I haven t had anything here I didn t swoon for.
La Cocina de Consuelo,194,This place is great for breakfast brunch  We arrived a few minutes past 11  so unfortunately  we could not order from what i guess was the breakfast menu  it had lots of choices of burritos  but only served until 11am .  we ordered from the regular menu.  I got the migas and they were great  The potatoes were a tad salty  but overall  everything was very tasty    This place is very quaint  and the little old lady working there was very attentive to us as soon as we walked in.
La Cocina de Consuelo,195,So  yesterday I ran into Mr Queso  er Don P.  and Lucy at the Dog Park and one thing lead to another and we end up talking about Tacos and Enchiladas. Then he starts telling me about La Cocina de Consuelo and the amazing Potato Enchiladas she makes. As I am leaving I realize it is after 2PM and I still had not eaten lunch so I call up some friends to meet me there. Unfortunately  they were already closed by the time we got there    Check their hours   After almost 24 hours of craving enchiladas I finally made it to La Cocina today  I sat out on the patio and the weather was just absolutely amazing and only added to the experience. I did not see the Potato Enchiladas on the menu that Don P. raved about  but  the Spinach and Mushroom Enchiladas sounded even better so that is what I went with. My S amp M Enchiladas were loaded with the healthy stuff and light on the sauce and cheese and still tasted indulgent. I am not a fan of rice or pasta so I was glad I could choose my sides - both the refried and black beans were very flavorful.   The service was spot on and made me feel like I was a family friend. I am holding back a full 5 stars because I felt intoxicated by 70 degrees cool breeze.
La Cocina de Consuelo,196,Horrible service  horrible food  and completely overpriced    This is the most dysfunctional restaurant I have ever been too. When I asked my server for sweetener she simply pointed to some boxes under there beverage area and told me to help myself. Really    Never again  
La Cocina de Consuelo,197,I ve passed by La Cocina de Consuelo numerous times on my way to work. This morning  I should have kept on going. It s Friday  so I decided to order a breakfast burrito with eggs  potatoes  and cheese on a flour tortilla  needed some carbs .  The tortilla was flaky and not in a good way. It crumbled and fell apart. I know I ordered cheese  but for the life of me  couldn t find or taste any. The eggs were gritty as if they were cooked on hot Austin pavement.  Was it worth the  3.09  No.  The menu listed the price at  2.50  so plus about 24  tax  I got a crappy burrito.  Avoid this place unless you re hungover and not caring what you eat.
La Cocina de Consuelo,198,I live in South Austin  but on some weekend mornings I wake up early and convince my fiance  Travis  to travel for breakfast. And where do we always end up  At La Cocina de Consuela   This place is tiny  and always packed and if you get there after 11 they stop serving their delicious mouth watering breakfast burritos  which is what happened last weekend. So I was real grumpy and ordered the migas haphazardly. Much to my delight and surprise- the migas were the best I have ever  and I mean this  had. I am from South Texas  where one you momma joke- your mommas so white  she makes your migas with corn flakes  and these migas kicked all those migas.   The best things about this place  their cheese which is queso fresco  their handmade fresh tortillas  breakfast burritos with tops of fillers to choose from and their migas   I will travel for breakfast  and now that they are serving dinner  for dinner to La Cocina de Consuela 
La Cocina de Consuelo,199,Just returned from lunch from here after seeing the solid 4 and 5 reviews.  As others have noted the parking nor the dining area is plentiful  but we were able to  make a spot  in front of the dumpster and were seated without problem.  Service was attentive.  As a first timer the gentleman let me know what the veggie friendly items were on the menu.  He offered up a second basket of chips before we needed to give him the  can we get more chips  look.  I ordered a torta without the breaded steak  basically an avocado sandwich  which came with one side  white rice  and my friend ordered the potato enchiladas which came with two sides.  No complaints about the torta or white rice.  The potato enchiladas were also good which had some spice to it.  We both ended up taking half our food home since it s more than we would normally eat.  I don t find this place a value compared to Taqueria Aranda s where I am satisfied with essentially the same torta I ordered at about half the price.  Coupled with the lunch time parking issue this place rates 3 stars for me after my one visit.  I will give it a bonus half star for being a local  family owned place.  I won t turn away the suggestion of eating at this place  but I m not going to go out of my way to eat there.  Meat eaters may appreciate this place more than me so La Cocina de Consuelo may be worth checking out for yourself.
La Cocina de Consuelo,200,I love places that feel like someone invited you into their home.  I know there are times when all people care about are good parking  fancy presentations  and good service  but there are times when you just want something truly that comes from grandma.  There are times when you go to restaurants and you think   I could have made that.   But this place is one of those   ahh  some real caring human made this.   The  imperfections  are what make it personal.  A few friends told me about this place.  It s a small little house behind Upper Crust Bakery.  Not a lot of seating - but that s what makes you special about being there     The salsa has some kick.  You can tell it was made in the kitchen.  Not chunky like canned stuff.  I got the chicken mole lunch special.  I love fresh tortillas.  This place is beyond the tortillas that you get made from places like Taco Cabana.  They are not some perfect circle.  I had some flour and some corn - all amazing.  The mango jicama salad made me want to make some at home.  The fideos were in a nice little tomato broth.  The mole had a good thickness to it - perfect for sopping.  Not too sweet  not too spicy . . . just homey.  As I was paying  it wasn t like it was the owner chef asking me how my meal was  it was lick my little abuelita.    It s one thing when mom makes you food.  Another thing when grandma makes you food.  Lots of soul  lots of love.  It just makes you smile and want to give grandma a hug.
La Cocina de Consuelo,201,My husband  amp  I went there last night for dinner. We split an order of queso  amp  the beef fajitas. The queso was good  but I ve definitely had better. It almost tasted a bit velveeta-y to me. The fajitas  on the other hand  were PHENOMENAL. The beef was tender  marinated is some sort of deliciousness  and the homemade tortillas were great. We also really like the refried beans  they had lots of flavor  amp  were still a bit chunky  as opposed to being like soup . My husband really liked the fideo  sp   basically mexican vermicelli . I wasn t a huge fan  but it s just not my thing. This is the first mexican restaurant where we ve ever seen them offered.  However  compared to Taqueria Arandas  this place was much more expensive. So  unless I m specifically craving great fajitas  I ll probably stick to Arandas.   NOTE- The salsa is super spicy  WAY too spicy for my whitey taste buds  but apparently some people find the heat a good thing  so while I don t think it s a negative  be forewarned 
La Cocina de Consuelo,202,I frickin  LOVE Consuelos. The building is super small and looks semi-sketchy from the streets  but don t let that scare you off. It s family-run and the food is amazing  The chips and queso are great  and they have a really funky salsa that comes with the chips. There is seating inside and outside. You can also order something that s not on the menu  and they ll probably make it for you anyway  and it will still be amazing. The waiters are super nice too. The only caveat - the sit-down service is kinda slow  so I d only go if you re in the mood to camp out with friends for a while and enjoy your meal.  BEST. QUESADILLAS. EVER.
La Cocina de Consuelo,203,Very good Mexican food  home made tortillas are great. Very reasonable prices.  Service is also very good.
La Cocina de Consuelo,204,Why I ve been putting off trying this place is beyond me.  I finally made my first trip to Connie s today and let me tell you  it won t be my last. In my opinion  the best cooks are little old ladies. I don t care if they re black  white  hispanic or asian - little old ladies KNOW how to cook. Connie is one of these ladies. There are not a ton of choices and there aren t any combo plates  but beyond that the food is AWESOME   I also think their salsa is just about as good as you can find. It s a slightly different color than what you ll find at other places  it s a little more orange in color   but the flavor and heat factor are both perfect.  I had a couple tostadas for lunch. The meat was seasoned perfectly and the tortillas were perfect. Rice and beans were very good  but they re pretty much just like the rice and beans you ll find at any above-average tex-mex place.  Places like this are hard to find. I sure hope she s around for years to come since La Cocina de Consulo es muy  muy buena 
La Cocina de Consuelo,205,I feel like I should apologize to Consuelo  but in my defense I really wanted to love it.  I really did.  Places like Serranos are great  but I prefer the up and comers.  The ambiance was fine although all the tables were dirty  but the staff quickly wiped down one for us.  We placed our order for drinks and they came - nothing exciting about a tea and a dr. pepper.  We ordered our appetizer and entrees.  Entrees came and then the appetizer. No biggy  but it was only guacamole that was chillingly cold  so maybe they forgot about it.   Right before I picked up my fork the waitress noticed I got the wrong dish it belonged to the table next to us.  They didn t complain and took the food  but I couldn t recover my food since he had already started chowing down on my tasty spinach and mushroom enchiladas.  Well my bf got his food and kindly waited to start eating his plate until they fixed my plate of enchiladas up.  My food came maybe 10 minutes later.  Now it s time to pay for the couple next to us.  Oh for the trouble Consuelo says - you only have to pay for one entree.  Good deal  I m thinking since they got three entrees-- what they both ordered plus what I ordered.  I heard their total it was 8.65.  Next it s our turn to pay 2 drinks  appetizer and 2 entrees  37.  WTF I m the one who had to wait  where s my discount   And wait a minute.  They actually overcharged our card by  6.95 so they gave us back  7 cash.  THEN HAD THE NERVE TO ASK IF WE HAD A NICKEL    A NICKEL     You made me wait for 10 minutes for my food after you tried to give me chicken and you have the nerve to ask if I have a nickel    Never again Consuelo  never again.            Rant END  I d like to think  I m nice  but people who say they are nice are usually arseholes  so who knows maybe I got what I deserved 
La Cocina de Consuelo,206,We were looking for a new place to eat lunch  and were surprised to find that we had never been here before.  La Cocina is located in a converted house  so when you enter  you feel like you are about to eat in someone s living room.  The lunch menu had your standard dishes  from enchiladas to tacos  although judging by the signs scattered around the store and awards proudly displayed on the walls  their breakfast tacos are supposed to be some of the best.  Unfortunately  they do not serve them after 11 am.  Disappointed that we woke up too late to try these breakfast tacos  I dejectedly ordered the mushroom and spinach enchilada plate.  The food was good  although nothing spectacular.  It may have been that I had my taste buds set to breakfast tacos  and enchiladas didn t satisfy this urge.  The prices for lunch were slightly higher than I would expect.  As with most small places on Burnet  there s parking right in front  which always presents a fun adventure trying to back up onto the busy street.  La Cocina is walking distance to Pacha  so maybe next time I ll try breakfast tacos from Cocina  then jog down for coffee from Pacha.
La Cocina de Consuelo,207,My first time here i unknowingly tried to order 3 breakfast burritos. they are SO cheap so i thought they would be super small. thankfully the guy working questioned my motivation and warned me  so i cut it back to one.  ohhhh man. yes. they were big. and freakin gooood  i ordered a  tanya  off of their regulars menu. props to tanya  wherever you are  you know how to order a burrito   basically  i got an amazing breakfast for 3 dollars and in 3 minutes. so cheap and so fast  if it wasnt out of the way for me  i d come here much much more regularly.
La Cocina de Consuelo,208,La Cocina is a superb  affordable  cozy joint for a great breakfast burrito. Lovely little dining room of 6-8 tables. It looks like there is also outside seating for warmer weather. But for  5 you ll get a killer breakfast. Can t beat it 
La Cocina de Consuelo,209,Honestly it was expensive  the food wasn t particularly anything special  and the server was totally creepy.  Must ve been an off day or something but that ll forever be my impression of the place.  There is better food cheaper  elsewhere.
La Cocina de Consuelo,210,Consuelo kicks ass and so does her cooking   I think we ve eaten here more than any other place in town.  Everything is fresh  clean  not greasy and very well prepared.  I don t know what she puts in her lemonade  but it is really  really good.  It perfectly offsets the burn of the green salsa.  I ve ordered just about everything on the menu so far  and I ve not been dissapointed yet.  My favorite items on the menu are the chicken plates  whether it is tacos or the Monterrey     they re all good.  My husband is a tried and true fan of the stuffed burrito.  We had to get used to her strange hours during the week - we showed up once or twice and she was closed.  now that we have that down  we ll keep coming back for as long as she is a-cooking 
La Cocina de Consuelo,211,The menu is not gi-normous  but...it s like having your  or a friends  mom cook for you.  And really  how many things can you really expect mom to do at once. Different lunch specials daily.  Wednesday is chicken mole day - YUM   All white meat chunks of chicken breast in a not too sweet  not too spicy mole sauce.  The fideo is super yummy  and the rice is simple and tasty. Taco Cabana might be cheaper and faster  but this is GOOD  REAL  food cooked and served by good  real  people.
La Cocina de Consuelo,212,Wow  This place is awesome and my favorite stop for breakfast tacos. All the tortillas are homemade and the tacos are HUGE   The lunch and dinner menu items  on the small but awesome menu  are spectacular as well. If you have been in Austin for any time at all you have probably driven past this gem. You owe it to yourself to stop and check it out  just don t tell anyone else because I love the quick wait times and the fact that they recognize me when I walk in.
La Cocina de Consuelo,213,Chicken enchiladas   YUM  BYOB   AWESOME  This places get a sold 4 stars for great food and a cute atmosphere.  I will say that I wouldn t necessarily go here on a first date  since it s so tiny that privacy is at a minimum.
La Cocina de Consuelo,214,I ve only eaten the breakfast tacos here but can report that they are excellent.  They are huge  more burrito than taco  and well worth the  3.00 or so they cost  so don t let the higher than standard price discourage you.  I love the fact that they have these chewy whole wheat tortillas  obviously homemade  since they are never totally round .  They also have unusual innards to try - calabacitas  squash   rajas  grilled peppers   dried shredded beef  and turkey bacon when you are feeling like something salty crunchy but don t want to go whole hog.  They have both red and green salsa - I always ask for one of each since they are both good.  Overall  the quality of food here is far superior than your regular run-of-the-mill b-fast taco place.  The only problem with the tacos here are their size.  They are so delicious you can t just eat half and save the rest for later - impossible - so only go when you are feeling gluttonous.  I d go there more often myself  but do not want to lead myself into temptation too often.  I mainly go when I want to treat myself - like when I virtuously refrained from dessert the night before.
La Cocina de Consuelo,215,La Cocina de Consuelo was a great little find for us. We went there on a Friday night  so it was just a little busy. We were able to sit outside on their nice little patio  which was a nice change from the inside which was a little cramped.   I am a salsa fiend  and this stuff was awesome. Warning  For those who dont like spicy food  do not try this. It had a lot of heat and a lot of flavor.  I decided to stay on the safe side  so I got the beef tacos. They were very fresh and and flavorful  served with the standard beans and rice. I wolfed them down in a hurry.  The service was great and the food was even better. Alex  our waiter  did a great job of recommending dishes for us. This is definitely a cocina I will be back to in the very near future.
La Cocina de Consuelo,216,For a Mexican breakfast in Austin  a city that thrives on the cuisine from immigrant workers and influence south of the border  La Cocina de Conseulo does not live up to the competition.  I do appreciate the handmade tortillas.  On the other hand  they re dense.  They don t make me feel the way I want to feel after breakfast.  Given the pride from the homemade food  their salsa was lackluster.  Not that this is the end-all be-all of a mexican restaurant  but it says a lot  and if you don t bring something unique or flavorful to the table  I won t be telling my friends about it.  The ingredients were of average quality  but the menu was lacking in diversity or originality.  Eggs  cheese  beans  tortilla  salsa.  It seems like every item was the same.  If you re a power lifter looking for calories after a workout  these tortillas are great.  Other than that  the place was just another bland Mexican diner.
La Cocina de Consuelo,217,Authentic taste  intimate setting. You can really tell the difference with the handmade quality of the dishes. It feels like coming home  with care that s put into the quality of both the service and food.  Update  -1 star   The customer service is socially inept. And they refuse to servE breakfast tacos at dinnertime  which I honestly think is why it s empty for dinner when I ve gone. I m not a morning person  so they could definitely increase their profit margin if they served breakfast all day.
La Cocina de Consuelo,218,Yum   We started with the queso  it was small but good.  The table salsa was a little too hot for us.  The fiance got flautas and he says they were delightful.  I got the Pollo a la Monterey with salad and beans.  The salad was a nice bowl of mixed greens.  The chicken was super flavorful  I asked to make it less spicy .  We finished off our meal with the  flan   but tasted more like ricotta pie  still delicious.  All and all a solid dinner.
La Cocina de Consuelo,219,Been here at least four times  every time the experience is solid. Nothing fancy  no frills. We re talking plastic cups and cheap plate ware. But the little place is charming  with painted wood tables  an open kitchen  and a covered deck for outdoor eating. I have to admit my partner and I have been totally boring  always ordering the same thing - he  the enchiladas with tomatillo sauce  me  the enchiladas with red sauce - but I have yet to be disappointed. They also provide complimentary chips and salsa  the chips are warm and crispy  the salsa is wonderfully hot . Good portions  good prices  sweet  efficient wait staff. Always seems relatively busy  even on weeknights  but hey  this IS Austin.
La Cocina de Consuelo,220,Consuelo s is a great little spot for  home cooked  Mexican food. Connie really puts her heart into what she cooks in that little kitchen of hers.  Parking can be tough  especially with only a few spots out front. If you can t find anything in the back  go through the narrow path along the side  you ll likely have to hoof it from a block away.   The decor is pretty humble and there aren t more than about 8 tables inside and out  but the food and great service easily make this a 4-star place. Most of the items on the menu are above average but the killer dish has to be the mole. It s served as a Wednesday special so if you go  definitely do it on hump day and give it a try. Home made tortillas and the nopalito  cactus  salad help put any of the dishes over the top. If you ve got room left for dessert  try the flan - it s done a little differently and extremely sweet.
La Cocina de Consuelo,221,I was lured here by the 4- and 5-star reviews  and while I came away satisfied  I was not motivated to the point of  Yay  I m a fan.   We got there fairly early on a Friday night  6 30 - 7 00  and were able to snag one of the few parking spots out front.  The dining area is small  around 6 two-tops indoors  some  I suppose  could do for crowded four-tops  and around 4 tables in back on the patio.  We wanted to sit outside  but there was another couple out there and  as close as the tables are together  it just would have been weird to plop down right next to them with no one else in the joint.  Service was incredibly friendly and fast.  Our server took the time to go over the menu with us and point out the specialties of the house  chicken enchiladas and spinach  amp  mushroom enchiladas  she said .  My one serious knock on the service is that she delivered our water glasses by grasping each glass over the top with her hand  insuring that her fingers were squarely placed right where my mouth was supposed to go.  Ew.  Fortunately  there were some straws up on the left-hand side of the front counter to remedy this.  The complimentary chips were nothing special  but the accompanying salsa was above-average - much spicier than the usual bland stuff many places throw out to satisfy a table s most sensitive palate.    I found the heralded spinach and mushroom enchiladas to be just okay.  I give them points for not being drowned in grease and sauce.  There was enough cheese on top to complement the dish without making you feel like you were eating a deconstructed pizza.  But there were about as many mushrooms in those enchiladas as there are plastic babies in a king cake.  Popeye would have been pleased  but I want my share of shrooms too.  Maybe I chose poorly on the sides  but the rice was ho-hum and the black beans had that fresh-out-of-the-can flavor.  By now this may sound like a 2-star review  but I give Consuelo a third star just for being BYOB.  Austin so desperately needs more of these.  She does offer Mexican sodas and soft drinks for the teetotalers.  Maybe it was an off night.  I ll probably go back just to support a BYOB restaurant and hopefully see some improvement.
La Cocina de Consuelo,222,Oh  La Cocina...  How I love you.    This review is solely for their breakfast  as I ve never been there past 11am.  Although based on those breakfast burritos  I d trust anything they cook.    After moving to Austin from San Antonio a few years back  I quickly went into fresh-made tortilla withdrawal.  Homemade tortillas are the norm in the Alamo city  but not so much up here unless you go to Chuys or Taco Cabana.  Well  enter La Cocina on Burnet.  Fresh  huge flour tortillas wrapped around several tacos worth of eggs  meats  veggies - anything you want.  Don t think Chipotle or Freebirds  instead imagine a classic breakfast taco tightly packed and on steroids. Homemade  delicious taco steroids.    Do yourself a favor and try The Rachel.  Their red and green salsas are extremely fresh and while very different  equally delicious.  Can t think of any better salsas around.  One breakfast burrito is a meal.  Get two and you ll probably be full all day.   For only about  3  one of these burritos beats Torchy s breakfast any day     Resist the urge to go to Upper Crust right next door  and go get the best breakfast taco  that isn t really a taco  in Austin.   They also have pretty decent coffee  a nice dining area and a patio  and one of the nicest staffs in town.  What are you waiting for   Go 
La Cocina de Consuelo,223,Just ate amazing al pastor tacos with grilled pineapple in them. Amazing    Must try 
La Cocina de Consuelo,224,After having read the reviews  I figured I d give La Cocina a try.  I won t be back a second time.    I ordered a bacon  egg  cheese and potato breakfast burrito and was looking forward to munching down on a giant tasty treat.  Instead  I got not even a whole piece of bacon  nor a whole egg  a good size pile of  tepid  potatoes and a smattering of cheese.  The tortilla was nicely grilled and the salsa had a good kick to it.  But for the money   2.75   more for 4th ingredient   I ll go down the road for a Torchy s taco any day.  My companion enjoyed her burrito  but did comment that they had also gone heavy on her cheapest ingredient.  Why not just raise the price a bit and fill  er up with the good stuff   
La Cocina de Consuelo,225,Wonderful little place that feels very cozy and comfortable inside.  I usually get the breakfast burrito and man those tortillas are soooo tasty   A little on the thick side but you can taste the homemade love.  Haven t tried much besides that and the migas but definitely worth a trip.
La Cocina de Consuelo,226,I absolutely LOVE LOVE L.O.V.E. La Concina de Consuelo  LaCo I call it for short . The tortillas are delicious and warm with homemade deliciousness. I love ordering the breakfast burritos on corn tortillas - they make my life. The chirizo is amazing and pairs well with the egg and cheese. If you haven t been to LaCo yet  do NOT leave Austin without it.
La Cocina de Consuelo,227,I have to go against the grain here and say that I thought the food was not as good as it could have been.  I ordered the Migas breakfast for myself and a bacon  egg  amp  cheese burrito for the boyfriend.   Both he and I were disappointed. My migas were undercooked and his taco was less than flavorful.   I will try the food here again but am a little hesitant.  The ambiance is quaint  and I enjoyed it.  Well worth another go 
La Cocina de Consuelo,228,Let me start by saying I do truly love the huge breakfast burritos here  lunch is meh  but the reason for my poor rating is the disrespectful and incredibly rude employee  who works there. I think he owns it or is part of the familia.  You know who you are  I dread coming in every single time due to knowing I have to deal with this jerk.  He always ignores you  never a smile on his face   then after he s barked the amount owed and quickly swiped my card - I asked for two extra green salsas. Well they re 20 cents each. I slide my card back towards him. He rudely says  it s not worth charging  and throws 2 salsas at me. How about if he asks me if I want salsa prior to running my card  I say  you know  I m actually thirsty too so ill take a soda and you can charge the salsas .  He responds with  still not worth it  and turns away.   As much as I love their breakfast  I can t justify ever returning and rewarding the bad behavior that I ve encountered here not just this time but EVERY time I ve been in. There are too many places in Austin that are grateful for your business.
La Cocina de Consuelo,229,First off  thank you Yelp for helping me find this place. Nom nom nom  Salsa   spicy  not overbearing  deliciousness. Spinach mushroom enchiladas   yummmm. Ample spinach  not heavy on the sauce  thankfully. I actually felt healthy eating this. Sides   I got nopalito salad and fideo as my 2 choices. Holy shenanigans. Pure bliss. Service   amazing. I felt like I was a guest in their home. Everyone I was with LOVED their meals. I doubt you can go wrong here. Side notes   Inside seating is very limited  there is outside seating too. You can bring your own alcohol. There IS parking. Get here immediately. Eat. Leave happy   .
La Cocina de Consuelo,230,The ONLY mexican restaurant in Austin I ve found to be worth while  Yes  I realize there are tons and I have definitely not tried them all. .  I love a good ma and pa kinda place and the fact that this restaurant is still run by family makes it a gem.  Service  Friendly  amazing  and accommodating.  Had the same server each time and she remembers us even if it s months between visits.  Food  Fantastic.  There is a daily special each weekday.  I LOVE the mole  more mild than I m used to but rich in flavor   the tacos al pastor  delicious pork with pineapple   and I can t wait to try the relleno  D  During the holidays  they have ready made chicken or beef tamales for purchase.  Drinks  BYOB.  They ll even provide a corkscrew and glasses upon walking in the door.    I love La Cocina de Consuelo.  One day  I hope to meet Consuelo  D
La Cocina de Consuelo,231,Best tortillas in Austin  I love the breakfast more than lunch or dinner. Yes  they do have the best breakfast tacos in town  I love bringing family and friends here when they are in town and they always love it.  Got the huevos a la mexicana  and added cheese today. It was delicious aside from the new potatoes they have switched to. Tried my boyfriend s chilaquiles con pollo plate and that awesome  Love how the corn tortillas don t get soggy in the mix 
La Cocina de Consuelo,232,This is an update for Consuelo s breakfast.  The SO and I stopped off on a Sunday morning for breakfast after a morning swim.  The food was awesome.  We had migas and a breakfast burrito.  Everything was super-fresh  and the homemade corn tortillas were amazing.    I still have to take away a star for parking and atmosphere issues  but Consuelo s is now on the Mavis F. Breakfast Restaurant List.
La Cocina de Consuelo,233,Dang... I really did want to love this place. Walking in  you feel like you re in someone s house. I suppose if I were Mexican  this would be how I would imagine grandma s house... anyway...  The ambiance is awesome... they even have a great fenced-in little side patio.  And the food... it looked awesome. My migas were the most beautiful I ve had in Austin  and the corn tortillas were clearly freshly made.  But here s where it broke down  sorry imaginary Mexican grandma ...  The potatoes were undercooked  the beans were bland  the tortillas tasted terrible  and the only saving grace was the actual migas  which were quite good  but not great. How could something so awesome looking taste so meh   It was such a neat place  I may try again  but I ll stick with flour tortillas  and skip the beans and potatoes for sure. Otherwise  I ll just stick it away in my head for when I m eating some tasty migas at a dirty dive  so I can close my eyes and picture this place instead.
La Cocina de Consuelo,234,Stopped for a quick breakfast. The fresh homemade corn tortillas are the star. The burrito is build your own. Excellent and quick 
La Cocina de Consuelo,235,I felt warm and fuzzy walking into this place on a beautiful Sunday morning. Though small  the decoration is quint and homey. The kitchen is right next to the dining area  separated by a cashier counter.   The food arrived not long after we ordered at the counter. I had the huevos ranchero while Mat enjoyed his migas burrito. I enjoyed my breakfast very much  every single bite tastes so homemade that I strongly believe the old lady at the back of the kitchen was the one who cooked for us. The patio looks very nice but a bit small  perhaps it is best for a romantic dinner for two.
La Cocina de Consuelo,236,Solid Mexican food here.  I decided to check out this place for lunch after reading all the great reviews- I was somewhat let down by the lack of flavor  but hey  that s because I am used to TexMex as opposed to the true Mexican flavors. They were accommodating in fixing my daily special  Chili Rellano  vegetarian style. The Chili was not breaded which I appreciated  but I would have liked some more cheese and some sauce. The tortillas  both flour and corn  were fantastic and the true star of the place. The salsa was fresh  just not my style. I think this place could probably be a 5 star for the breakfast tacos  which they stop selling after 11am  so I was unable to order one. I am not itching to go back right away  but I have a feeling I will make a stop for breakfast at some point in the near future.
La Cocina de Consuelo,237,Believe the hype  Hands down the best tortillas I ve had north of San Antonio.  The salsa was spot on.  Paper plates  nice touch...made me feel like I was in South Texas again. Thanks Yelpers...Another gem I would have missed.
La Cocina de Consuelo,238,My  favorite mexican place in austin. The best value breakfast taco burrito in town. Their tortillas are homemade  great  and come in wheat. salsa s are spicy  not for the weak meek. barbacoa is also pretty..pretty good.   Atmosphere is super homey  super laid back. I really can t complain about this place
La Cocina de Consuelo,239,La Cocina de Consuelo makes some of the best breakfast burritos in town.  It is a slight pity that they don t offer breakfast  tacos   but seeing as I would just get two of those  the burrito is A-OK   Let me just describe it   A delicious  soft-yet-chewy  handmade flour tortilla  not sure if lard or shortening is used  I think the latter  cradles a very wide variety of fresh ingredients  all cooked up to order.  You can get eggs  potatoes  beans  chorizo and the like  of course  but you can also get machacado  avacado  rajas  a couple of varieties of cheese...  My personal favorite is machacado  egg  avocado  and cheese.    It all tastes great  but what really takes it over the top is the value.  At  2 and change  these burritos may just be the best cost taste size value in town.  I keep meaning to check out this place for dinner  but haven t been by yet.  Parking in the  back is limited -- four side-by-side spots along the back fence  and one parallel against the building.  Some more parking out front  but it can be hard to back out onto Burnet when traffic is heavy.
La Cocina de Consuelo,240,I was really excited to try this place. Went for breakfast and I was really disappointed. The people behind me in line were served a good 10 minutes before us. I m pretty sure they forgot about our order. The tortillas were good and homemade  but the taco lacked flavor. Probably won t be back.
La Cocina de Consuelo,241,This place is very unique and crazy awesome.  First  there is seating for maybe 15 inside.  It s an old house that s converted.  The kitchen is far bigger than the dining area.    Tortillas are awesome and homemade.  They have three types  flour  corn and wheat .  I can vouch for the flour and corn  unreal  being good  but haven t had the wheat yet.  They have the best salsa I ve had so far in Austin  I ve been in Austin for 9 years .  Have a great green sauce too if you like the very spicy type.    I will frequent this place at least twice a week for the duration of my stay in Austin  which may be forever.  Try it out.
La Cocina de Consuelo,242,My new favorite place for migas. They re very different from any others that I ve had. The eggs are scrambled with a red sauce  corn tortillas and cheese. That s it. They re excellent  esp. wrapped in fresh flour tortillas. The sides of black beans and fried potatoes are very simple and very tasty. The table sauce is a green sauce that is spicy and very good. This is a tiny place  very casual and friendly. Can t wait to work way through the rest of the menu.
La Cocina de Consuelo,243,The much touted breakfast burritos are not served after 11am  including on Sundays. When you notice that the inside dining area can t accommodate more than 15 people  you realize that they can t sell the cheap stuff all day. After all this place started out as a carryout and only later became a dine-in on the instance of some of Connie s friends. So you gotta make that worthwhile.   But at about 30 minutes just to get migas and tortilla soup  you have to really question the choice of dining in. We did. But the food was tasty. The migas were a bit dry but the tortilla soup was grand. And the home made flour tortillas were excellent  though their thickness made them come across more like an Indian roti. The salsa that came out with the chips is pretty hot.   Friendly service.   The next time  we got the takeout Burritos. They are good with the home made flour tortillas. Only complaint is that the rajas was a bit oily. It s probably best to go with one of the recommended flavor combinations  but they re not listed on the take out menus. This would be a no-brainer for Rosedale residents  for sure  but it feels a little funny spending gas and time to pick up really cheap burritos.
La Cocina de Consuelo,244,By far this is the BEST Mexican breakfast in town.   Really authentic   Tortillas are to die for.   Will be my favorite spot for a good breakfast.  Need to come back to check out lunch and dinner menu.
La Cocina de Consuelo,245,My friend and I shared a Breakfast Burrito and Migas plate. Small dining room for an intimate setting. I loved the salsa  Spent a nice lazy morning reading the paper and chatting with a friend.  Thank you yelpers for the recommendation 
La Cocina de Consuelo,246,We d heard good things about Cocina de Consuelo from a friend  so ventured out to try it this morning. UM  YUMMY   It s small  just a few tables  but you honestly feel like you re a guest in their home  which we loved. Order up at the counter  husband and I both got the migas  and the little one got a breakfast taco . Service was very sweet  even offered to make some homemade lemonade for us when our daughter wanted it    The salsa was yummy and spicy. The tortillas were GREAT - huge  and freshly made.   The migas were tasty - very fresh  and just enough a portion that I didn t feel like I was going to die immediately after eating them  like I do at some places in town . I REALLY liked the potatoes that came on the side  they were nicely browned on the outside - a little crispy just like I love them - and nicely flavored seasoned . The beans were also good.   We will definitely be back - this is a little gem in the neighborhood that I m anxious to try again   UPDATE  We ordered their tamales for the holidays  and YUM - they were delicious. A little hidden spicyness to them  and amazing flavor. Would definitely have them again 
La Cocina de Consuelo,247,I go NO WHERE else for Mexican breakfast. Family owned in a little house with music. It feels like going to grandma s. My favorites are the Michael s breakfast burrito  the chicken enchiladas  and the beef fajitas. I cannot forget the flour tortillas - always warm and yummy.
La Cocina de Consuelo,248,Ding  Ding  Ding   We have a WINNER    My wife and I stumbled in here this past Saturday - a day when they are normally closed - but open due to the  LoBurn  neighborhood street party this past weekend. Matter of fact we stopped because the neon sign was flashing  Open  but the sign on the door said closed.  We almost left.  Thank g-d we didn t.  Had some of the best migas ever  and my wife had a GIANT breakfast burrito  two coffees  a coke and water and with 20  tip we were out the door for  15     The tortillas are to die for.....big as a plate  made fresh and served warm.....  We came back Sunday for breakfast.  Same great food  service and price.  I am in food-LOVE.    Order at the counter  find a seat  they bring it to you.  Self-serve coffee  though they charge .50 for coffee refills.....my only frown .  I almost deleted this post.....I want to keep this place a family secret.  So now you owe me.......please come late to breakfast on the weekends so I don t have to wait in line.
La Cocina de Consuelo,249,I fell in love with this place as soon as we stepped in the front door   We were greeted by a lovely woman who not only took our order  but cooked it as well   I had the picadillo burrito w  lettuce  tomato and rice and beans wrapped in a homemade tortilla.  It was delicious and I didn t have that   Holy Moley...I can t believe I just ingested that much food   feeling.  The best way that I can describe the food is that it is  clean Mexican .  No orange grease...and not overly cheesed     Lovely interior   Very Colorful with limited seating  which lends to a quaint dining experience.  We loved it and will definitely be back.  We might even try the back patio next time  
La Cocina de Consuelo,250,This is one of those places that s been on my radar and I just haven t made it in.  For the last 15 years I ve either lived within walking distance  or I ve driven past and said to myself to   That looks like my kinda place   or  Why haven t I stopped in there    Well  I finally made it in  and this time I said to myself   Where have you been all my life      Consuelo s place is a simple little unassuming haven of Mexican authenticity  and they do the things necessary to keep it small and simple.  There is very little service  and it doesn t  look  warm and accommodating.  So  that s what keeps it from getting a fifth star.  That s perfect  however  because if this place had full service and were big and pretty  it would be packed to the gills all the time.  Instead  they have a steady take away flow  and that makes it nice to be able to eat quietly and enjoy.  Huevos rancheros con frijoles y papas could hardly be prepared better to my liking.  Just the right amount of the sides  and the salsa has a nice bite to go perfectly with the eggs and a wonderful handmade tortilla.  It s so ridiculous to me  by the way  how many places have handmade flour tortillas but the corn and wheat ones are floppy store-bought junk.  La Cocina de Consuelo does it right  which should be expected at all Mexican and Tex-Mex places  since corn tortillas are so easy to make properly   My honey had the migas  and I wish I could say they were great  but she wolfed them down so fast  this is very unusual for her  that we didn t get to trade bites like we normally do.  So  I ll trust her judgement that they were  delicious .  The salsa is fantastic.  It s not too hot  but they aren t afraid to give it the kick that most places fear will burn their poor customers  widdle gringo tongues.  Authentic and yummy   Finally  my daughter s breakfast taco with eggs  black beans  avocado  cheese  and tomatoes in a wheat tortillas was the size of her forearm  and I did actually get a bit of that.  Also fantastic.  We WILL be back  and it won t take 15 years.
La Cocina de Consuelo,251,So after living here for going on 10 years  somehow I ve never eaten here.  Sure  I ve passed by it god knows how many times but have never set foot in here.  While my opinion may not be popular it s totally unbiased.  This place is TINY and has plenty of charm.  The parking is as minimal as the seating  so be prepared to be dealing with frustration depending on when you decide to try it out.  Observations  There was literally one person working the counter and floor.  It wasn t crazy busy but I could see how this could create issues.  The menu isn t very big yet options are to be had.  The tortillas are seemingly made fresh and you can definitely taste it.  The salsa is freaking delicious  one of the best I ve had in town.  The prices are definitely a little on the high side.  I mean  I get it  you re place is small and you re in a very high dollar real estate area.  I had the beef fajita taco plate and was a little underwhelmed when my plate arrived.  I had their vermicelli and refried beans as side dishes.  The tacos themselves were literally beef and sauteed onions.  No accoutrements  no garnish  nothing.  The last impression I had was the counter person server seemingly being rude to my dining partner.  Thankfully  I didn t witness it but surely not a positive thing.
La Cocina de Consuelo,252,OMG   This place is amazing   It s very small  but you forget about anything else once they start bringing you food.  The food   The service   The cute little dining areas   All wonderful 
La Cocina de Consuelo,253,Wow. New favorite breakfast place in Austin. Just wow. Much like my love for Cabo Bob s  the tortillas here are out of this world good. Thicker  chewy  nice char on the fresh made tortillas help make it the ideal container for all the yummy goodness that goes into the breakfast burritos  which as it sounds  is much larger than a breakfast taco. This hefty roll of your choice of 3 things  I split 2 with a friend  so I tried half of each  definitely fills you up and has high quality taste and homemade love written all over it. I really liked the combo of manchacado  shredded beef   eggs and potato. There s not a ton of beef there  but it flavors it just enough for that wow factor. I also tried eggs  potato and chorizo and that chorizo flavor just permeates through the mixture. Simply fantastic.
La Cocina de Consuelo,254,I don t think there is a bad item on the menu.  From breakfast burrito to guacamole to a famous Friday night Salmon Echilada  you will not regret your visit to this tiny little old house.  give it a go
La Cocina de Consuelo,255,I was fortunate to attend a party catered by this restaurant last night.  If you want THE BEST Mexican food in Austin...you will eat at this restaurant and or schedule them to cater your next event.  I strongly recommend the beef enchiladas-my personal favorite.    Two thumbs up for Abdel  a great asset to her business   
La Cocina de Consuelo,256,Homey with good service. The food is fine  but nothing special-- could have made it myself at home. Not sure I would go back.
La Cocina de Consuelo,257,Did not like the place at all food was bad and the parking is horrible I will never go back
La Cocina de Consuelo,258,I placed an order here for an office lunch of 30 people. It was delicious and everyone loved it. It was all neatly packed and ready for me to pick up when I arrived. It was priced appropriately and didn t taste like they placed quantity over quality. We got beef fajitas with all of the toppings and green chicken enchiladas as well as rice and beans. I ll definitely be back to dine in.
La Cocina de Consuelo,259,Homemade tortillas  amazing breakfast tacos  and friendly service 
La Cocina de Consuelo,260,I can  tbelive that it is only one person cooking  I loved that we were the only people in the restaurant house. It was very good.
La Cocina de Consuelo,261,Breakfast tacos- A ....3 ingredients for  2.50. I got egg  turkey bacon  and avocado and was full  Usually I eat 2 bfast tacos but here they are bigger.  Salsa- good  very spicy. It actually tastes a lot like the salsa you buy from HEB that comes in a bag. More watery than chunky.  Queso-  Large chunks of what I believe were sundried tomatoes. Small quantity for 5ish bucks. It was also quite spicy. Pretty thick too.   Chicken Enchiladas with tomatillo sauce- A         I had never really tried tomatillo sauce before but WOW  these were awesome. Very flavorful.   The entrees are kind of pricey for being such a tiny  mostly take-out place. But they are made fresh and delicious so I can t complain too much. The drawback is that you have to pay for chips and salsa whereas at a sit-down place  they are bottomless and free.   To give an example  I got chips and salsa  a small queso  and the chicken enchilada plate and it was 20 bucks. I got this to-go and the prices of food are nowhere listed on the website  so that was a fun surprise.
La Cocina de Consuelo,262,Went in for breakfast tacos... er... burritos... Again... pretty much blown away.  NOTE  THEY ARE NOT OPEN SATURDAYS... AT ALL...  Handmade tortillas really made the dish. I had machacado  egg  cheese  avocado... w flour again...  This time  the handmade tortillas were far from dry... soft  pliant  tasty as hell...  Oh  and I know I said that price is never a factor in my reviews... but  2.50 for a breakfast burrito 2-3 times bigger than your average breakfast taco...  I m heading back again and again...  Lemonade still tasted fake... even though they claim it s homemade.
La Cocina de Consuelo,263,Great bang the buck breakfast burritos. My favorite is the Tanya- just know they use turkey bacon instead of the usual kind. I also love I can stop in on my way to work and be back in the car on my way in less than 5 minutes.   Their tortilla soup is also fantastic. Tastes authentic and fresh. Looking forward to it now that it is cooling off.
La Cocina de Consuelo,264,Mmmmm.... Mexican food.  Okay  Yelpers  thanks for helping me find this place.  I m not as fond of it as most of you are  but I thought it was  A-OK .  I had the taco plate  refried beans  and fideo.  My wife and I also shared an order of guacamole.  The tacos were fine.  Not good  not great  they were fine.  I would have liked a little more punch to them  some more zesty flavor  but I m going to chalk that up to personal taste.  The fideo was very good  and the beans were basic.  My only real criticism of the whole lunch was that I would have liked to have my food hotter.  The whole thing was more than room temperature  but not hot.  The guacamole was good.  The chips were good.   Nuff said about that.  I wouldn t go out of my way to eat here  but if I were in the neighborhood and I was hungry it would make the list of options.
La Cocina de Consuelo,265,Real queso. Homemade tortillas. Tacos el Pastor. Amazing.      It s tiny and has no bar  BYOB . Nice little patio. Tight parking. Well priced.        I hate to tell you about this place - it s going to get very crowded - but I want Connie and her niece to thrive. This is the best yet for gettin  my TexMex fix.
La Cocina de Consuelo,266,So we rolled up late afternoon and were the only patrons  which I generally find a little weird. This place is teensy inside and I couldn t figure out if I was supposed to order at the counter or not you re not  FYI .  Man  I m glad we weren t scared off by that  or reviewers only talking about breakfast burritos. This stuff is the real deal--it appears that there is a woman in the kitchen dedicated to crafting delicious mexican creations. I had the torta milanesa with nopalitos salad and a vermicelli thing I had never heard of...but made my week. Best Mexican I ve had in Austin so far  and rivals some of my Dallas favorites. 
La Cocina de Consuelo,267,First visit   brunch. I had the chilaquiles con pollo  he had the migas.         House salsa  spicy and fresh and delicious.        Atmosphere - perfect  fabulous. Patio  amp  indoor seating. It s a true mom  amp  pop shop  the owner  amp  the waiter knew everyone in the place but us. Full but not too crowded  clean.       Service - prompt  amp  friendly.      Homemade flour and corn tortillas - he loved the flour. I had corn - they were obviously fresh  but a little bland  which probably just means they weren t overly salted like what I m used to .      Chilaquiles had a generous dose of cheese and grease. Tasty  but not as flavorful or spicy as I d hoped  maybe a little too much grease for my taste  but they re chilaquiles - I think they re supposed to be greasy  right  .    Beans  amp  potatoes were bland  potatoes were very greasy.  The atmosphere was enough to convince me to go back next time I m craving authentic Mexican fare - plenty of menu items I d like to try.
La Cocina de Consuelo,268,Breakfast was great  not to many options but enough.  Clean environment  and nothing to complain about the service  I is worth to try it .  Thanks
La Cocina de Consuelo,269,Amazing tortillas  I believe they are hand made. I had two large breakfast burritos and loved them both. You have the option of filling it with up to three fillings so I made the ideal burrito for me. The woman behind the counter was extremely kind and helpful  I felt like I was getting a personal at-home meal. I recommend this place for its atmosphere  the food  and the people
La Cocina de Consuelo,270,Fabulous home-made Mexican food in Austin.....and it s cheap ....and the service is excellent  not the uptight  snooty kind  but the come on in  we d love to feed you kind  ....and the dessert is even better   I gladly give this place 5 stars.  Home-cooked by three extremely friendly women who serve you just like you were their grand kids  literally  the grandkids came in while we were there .  From the tortillas  to the fideo  to the jicama mango salad  to the rice  to the enchiladas  to the brownies.....It s fabulous.  Please go try this place.  Just like grandma s kitchen  it s small and often full  so don t come with a big group without calling first.  They do have a cute outdoor patio and about 6 tables on the inside.    My non-vegetarian boyfriend had the migas and raved about them.  There are lots of veggie selections and I highly recommend the potato enchiladas     They don t serve alcohol  but you re welcome to bring your own beer and wine.
La Cocina de Consuelo,271,I absolutely love this place. Good ingredients plus adorable setting plus small feel and great food makes this place one of my favorite mexican places in town.   Things are a little on the spicy side  but there are plenty of options for kids and all of the dinner and lunch specials are great  Another plus  it s BYOB   Yo amo la cocina de consuelo.
La Cocina de Consuelo,272,This place is well worth a visit. The food is good  the atmosphere is authentic  and you can bring your own booze.    I got the Al Pastor Taco plate which had delicious marinated meat and big chucks of pineapple  however  my sides of black beans and rice were bland.   The chips  salsa  and queso were spicy and well worth trying as well  however  we were unable to get a refill because the server was inattentive.   If you do visit La Cocina de Consuelo you must get a side of corn tortillas. They are hand-made  thick  and fantastically amazing.
La Cocina de Consuelo,273,We liked everything about this cozy little place. The old house has a great feel. The menu is simple  fresh  healthy feeling and just done very well. Their salsa is mostly pepper based and has good spice--a nice change from the tomato based salsa that is more common around town. They offer several options for sides. Their salads are a nice option in lieu of rice and beans  though my husband got those and they are great too . We both had the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce. Very fresh  well executed and not too heavy. Definitely order the tres leches flan before you leave. It is a special recipe. Light  sweet and very unique...Glad to have a new tex-mex staple.
La Cocina de Consuelo,274,I have had lunch here several times   always very good.  The portion sizes are not large  like some Tex-Mex joints  but that is not a bad thing.  The salsa  is very good   as well as the queso.  A couple of notable dishes would include the chicken mole   excellent      and the burrito.  The homemade tortillas are nice and fresh  the sides like refried beans are very tasty.  Please note   I did try this place for breakfast one morning and it was  OK .  Nothing great - coffee is fair   and the eggs were OK.  I do not think I would go back for breakfast as there are too many other options around this place that are much better. You cannot miss for lunch though   just get there early as parking can be difficult  
La Cocina de Consuelo,275,We cheated on Fonda tonight and couldn t be happier.   Great refried beans- get nachos w guacamole   Enchiladas awesome - potato w chipotle and chicken tomatillo both amazing  Beef crispy taco was rich with guajillo flavor   chicken mole special was great  Homemade flour tortillas best in town  Friendly service  good portions and unpretentious   Classics Austin tex-mex  No booze  but it ain t gonna kill ya
La Cocina de Consuelo,276,So my experienced here wasnt that great i had enchiladas and the rice wasnt cooked the server didnt apologize or gave me cooked rice. Service was bad.I expected to be better i regret giving it a try since i read good reviews about it.
La Cocina de Consuelo,277,Best Mexican in Austin hands down.  Best breakfast too.  This place is absolutely fabulous.  I can not speak highly enough for the food  service and homestyle atmosphere.  Wonderful 
La Cocina de Consuelo,278,Best breakfast burritos  Their chorizo is amazing  and made w beef  a plus for those who can t eat pork . Lunch is good also but a breakfast burrito and lemonade hit the spot.
La Cocina de Consuelo,279,Great food  good quick service. Only complaint it is a little pricey.....it s not crazy expensive but for two people only two entrees no apps and tea to drink  we usually spent 35 bucks......not really sure how it adds up but that seems a bit much for me
La Cocina de Consuelo,280,I love the breakfast burritos here.  The tortillas are made fresh and the combination of beef  egg  cheese  as well as avocado is quite devastating.  You ll definitely want to add their hot salsa which will have you searching for some napkins to wipe off your sweat.  I would definitely recommend eating these while they are hot because the last time i got them to-go and the tortillas  which are thicker than store bought ones   tend to dry out.  I love this place except for the looong name which i always forget when my friends ask me where i got the burritos from.
La Cocina de Consuelo,281,This is one of my favorite places to get Mexican food in Austin. The food always tastes fresh and delicious. You should definitely try the Tacos al Pastor or the taco salad   This is a local business you will like eating at and feel good about supporting.
La Cocina de Consuelo,282,This place is yummy   The breakfast tacos are huge. Everything is freshly made. The salsa is hot but fantastic. The beans are delicious  The potatoes are soft not old and hard like in other breakfast tacos. The rice was just okay. The beef fajitas are good but they are not grilled. The tortilla soup is very good. The tortillas are homemade and huge. The Barbacoa was good with not a lot of fat. Highly recommended. We go every Friday morning 
La Cocina de Consuelo,283,I recommend it for the breakfast tacos  delicious   Great salsa and tasty tortillas   Plus you have the options of wheat  flour or corn tortillas  and for the charm of the little restaurant.  Make a trip at least once    I only gave four starts because the enchiladas I had one day were good  but not much to rave about.    Also  the place is small  so it s good if you are alone or with one or two other people  but if you are in a large group you will need to pick a different restaurant.
La Cocina de Consuelo,284,Delicious little hole in the wall. Only downside is no alcohol. Highly recommend the soft tacos.
La Cocina de Consuelo,285,Barely mediocre food and excruciatingly slow service.  Never. Going. Back.
La Cocina de Consuelo,286,Such a great find   Small place with huge character.  Everything I have had so far  chicken tacos  enchiladas  soup  have all been outstanding.  Their tortilla soup is the BEST I have had in Austin.  Keep up the good work Consuelo 
La Cocina de Consuelo,287,Go to this place and give Consuelo your money.  The enchiladas are the most succulent  freshest  hot-out-the-oven little tubes of deliciousness I ve ever had.  I m sure the other stuff is good as well  educated guess .   My only complaint - rice and beans should come standard with an enchilada plate.  I have to order them as my 2 sides  and then order an additional side of mango jicama salad or green salad  which is fine  but beans n rice shouldn t count as sides  they should be part of the meal  before sides.   That s my big complaint  and it s little.  Dinner at somebody s house slash restaurant is always a little bit magical.  If you are blessed enough to find such a place  you should patronize it  often  and be thankful.
La Cocina de Consuelo,288,the food here was so understated. like your Mexican grandma s cooking. the flour tortillas are home made and gangster   the re fried beans and the tortilla just by themselves were so good it nearly made me cry. I m not a fan in the least of the Mexican food in town  this place is the real deal. breakfast  lunch  dinner  dessert  yes to all of these   DO NOT COME HERE  please
La Cocina de Consuelo,289,Mmm the comment about feeling like grandma s house is right  that is if you have a Mexican grandma that cooks great food  About the only negative thing that I can say about this place is that the seating area is tiny  so it s not good for large groups. I don t mind it though  it makes it feel more homey  like you are truly in someone s kitchen. Our waitress  which I swear also helped cook the food  was not super hyper  amp  fake-happy  just nice  amp  friendly without being overly friendly just to get a good tip. Salsa was spicy  amp  authentic and the mole enchiladas were awesome. It s not very close to where I live but I ll definitely go back.
La Cocina de Consuelo,290,Probably the closest to authentic Mexico food you can get in Austin.  No  not Tex Mex.  You can go to Chuy s for that.  I m talking about Mexican food like from Mexico.  The place is very small  which I love and reminds me of Mexico.  Their salsa is so incredible and so hot.  I went for lunch and had the taco plate with fideo and refried beans.  Everything looks and tasted like it was from scratch  even the taco shells looked and tasted how I make them at home.  Can t wait to go back to try their breakfast and more of their lunch dishes.  Definitely a fan 
La Cocina de Consuelo,291,Everything is handmade and it feels like you are sitting in a dining room.  At other taco stands I have to get two breakfast tacos because they are so weensy.  Their breakfast burritos are just like those little tacos  but bigger and meaner.  A filling  fresh  personal breakfast for  1.75.
La Cocina de Consuelo,292,Came here for breakfast burritos but they only serve them before 11 am. So I had a regular burrito instead which was fresh however tasteless and a bit light for the  6 price tag. Slow but friendly service and nice ambiance. - asked for chicken but got beef... I won t be coming back for lunch.
La Cocina de Consuelo,293,Technically I am giving this place 3.5 stars but since that isn t an option I ll be nice and round up.  The food was good but standard.  The salsa was a little different than normal - greenish with a kinda gooey texture.  But I was waiting for a long time and I ate a lot of it cause it was good  flavorful  and not too spicy.  Really the downside to this place is only that the menu is pretty limited.  There were only maybe 6 lunch dinner options.
La Cocina de Consuelo,294,La Cocina de Consuelo is a little diamond find.  And I do mean little  5 tables total  - what a quaint  sweet place ..... my kind of place in the sense of cozy casual.  The waiter and Consuelo herself are genuinely friendly and could put a smile on just about anyone s face.  The food is good  but what I like most is that it is fresh - very fresh.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are perfect - not too much  not too little.  Although  queso or guacamole for two must mean two toddlers as I can eat both in their entirety myself.  In short  if you want good food at a fair price  with friendliness and charm that s hard to find  this is the place to nestle your little kitten tail and curl up for awhile 
La Cocina de Consuelo,295,Positives  Nice lady.  Clean interior.   Cons  Disappointed.  I d consider myself fairly experienced with Mexican cuisine due actually sampling the representative food from many of the states  queso in Oaxaca  ceviche in Veracruz  mole from Puebla  street food from D.F. etc. This was very underwhelming considering how much attention it has gotten from Yelp.    I ordered the  famous enchiladas  in ancho sauce with mango and jicama salad.  The enchiladas were paper thin and smaller than my palm. The ancho sauce lacked its rich smoky flavor.  The total came out to around  10.  I had to vulture nacho crumbs to stay full.  I m also seeing a lot of people praising this place on Yelp because it is  authentic  and  little Mexican ladies are the best cooks  and other variations on the theme called keeping it Real.  Please stop exoticizing this place.  You want real Mexican or Tex-Mex food  take your gringo butt to a place where they don t speak English and deal with the loud Tejano music and unglamorous pencil eye liner.
La Cocina de Consuelo,296,I realize that reviewing a restaurant on the basis of a single dish from a single visit is kind of silly  but it seems that is exactly what most people  or at least I  usually do. I wasn t too impressed with this place when I came for lunch a couple months ago  BUT  I decided to give it a try for breakfast since very few places in the area are open at 7am. All I can say is WOW. The black bean  potato  and calabaza burrito I had was delicious. I could eat one of these every single day and never get tired. Now I am definitely going to give this place another try to redeem itself during lunch and I am definitely coming back for more breakfast.
La Cocina de Consuelo,297,Jeez. don t tell anyone about this place  It is small so if you re the sixth table in  you re about out of luck. Come early  enjoy  Very good Tex-mex food and affordable. It s like a secret place that hides in plain sight. You can eat and laugh at all the poseurs going to the high priced silly bakery next door  Upper Crust  hear that  . I hope they put in more tables  I just keep coming back 
La Cocina de Consuelo,298,Just had breakfast for the first time here and really liked it...the price was a little high but worth it when I realized they were handmade tortillas  Also no wait  so for someone on the go in the morning this is a good thing. Had a breakfast burrito  chorizo and egg  and coffee and felt like I had just found a neat little gem of a nook. I ll probably come back to try the chicken mole since not to many places in Austin can do mole right...so I will be back.
La Cocina de Consuelo,299,Connie s famous enchalidas were A-OK.  You just can t help but root for the little guy  or gal  in this world.  I d eat here before I d go to Tres Amigos  Chuy s  El Rancho or Trudy s.  The salsa was blam  I just made that up      You should know before you go that they do not serve alcoholic beverages.  No Dos XX  no margaritas but it is BYOB.
La Cocina de Consuelo,300,If you want yummy mexican food that is carefully  amp  lovingly handmade  look no further.  I checked out this quaint restaurant one day while searching for breakfast tacos in my neighborhood. Unfortunately  I was too late for breakfast tacos  they stop serving them at 11 am   so I ended up ordering lunch. I ordered the crispy beef tacos and they were out of this world   They serve an awesome mango salad on the side that by itself is worth the trip. The proprietors are so friendly and welcoming - every table in the small restaurant was full and a line was forming at the counter for the lunch crowd. I m definitely going back to check out the breakfast tacos  and more  ... this place is a keeper 
La Cocina de Consuelo,301,Easily my favorite stop for breakfast burritos  very fresh and delicious. Excellent homemade tortillas  I go for the wheat every time. For lunch  you can t beat the taco  amp  soup combo  her tortilla soup has quickly become my favorite in town. Park around back as it s easier to get out than from the few spaces in front  and don t go on Saturday as they re closed for catering pickups. Excellent  expertly-prepared Mexican food that doesn t leave you bloated from the overuse of cheese  sour cream and other heavy ingredients.
La Cocina de Consuelo,302,Delicious salsa  The breakfast burritos are worth waking up before 11 am to snag.
La Cocina de Consuelo,303,Second favorite breakfast spot after Las Manitas  and top spot for breakfast tacos. They re huge  one will fill you up  two will leave you feeling stuffed   delicious  the tortillas are awesome  and the salsa adds a nice touch. The migas are also really good. And to top it all off  every time we ve gone here  it hasn t been that crowded.
La Cocina de Consuelo,304,Very rude service here this past Sunday.  I went in with a friend who loves the tacos there.  It was my first time.  We went to the ccounter to order.  We both started with an appetizer.  She ordered a tostada and the lady said in a crappy tone  if I knew you were just getting an appetizer  I wouldn t have brought out chips and salsa   Why not   Stupid.  Then I ordered a spinach-mushroom quesadilla.  Her tostada didn t have beans when it came out to the table.  My quesadilla didn t have mushrooms.  When my friend asked her to put beans on it  she acted put-out.  She brought it back with beans slopped on top.  The food was OK  had it come out the way we ordered it  but certainly nothing to write home about.  The salsa IS quite delicious.  That s the only good thing about this place but there are tons of good places for salsa in this town.  I won t be going back to La Cocina de Consuelo.
La Cocina de Consuelo,305,Damn this place was good. Sure  I was hungover in a big way but we sat outside in their little patio space  enjoyed tortilla soup  huevos rancheros and migas in the quaint setting. The corn tortillas seemed hand pressed  the salsa was tomatoey and had a great flavor and my huevos cooked perfectly - over medium with runny middles and hard cooked whites. One tip  The refried beans aren t that delicious. If you re getting a burrito  I d skip them. The only drawback on Sundays is that there s only one person taking orders and that means it can be difficult to get refills on salsa and such.  Oh and they don t have micheledas... although I m snobby about those things anyway.
La Cocina de Consuelo,306,Still being fairly new to Austin I tend to research places before I go. That being said I usually know what I want when I walk in. I can place my orders so direct   it would make the soup Nazi blush. Small dining room and its very laid back. Everyone can get their own refill of coffee  but the staff is more than happy to get it for you. The best part was the green chile  hot sauce. This was the closest I have had to New Mexico green chile  lots of flavor. And a little heat too. Just enough to help sweat out that Sky vodka from the night before. Really want to come here for lunch or dinner for second visit. Feel pretty positive this place wont suffer from the sophomore slump
La Cocina de Consuelo,307,I hate writing poor reviews about local mexican places  but honestly  they are the restaurants that frustrate me the most.  I know how easy it is to cook good Mexican food and it does not need to be expensive.  I also don t understand how said restaurants get rave reviews from people.  Are these people from Rhode Island or some Mexican Food deprived-state   I truly don t get it.  The eggs were medicore  very bland  the tortillas were stale and broken.  The salsa was unimaginative and unsuccessful in its simplistic execution.  All this for only  13.00 for my dining companion and myself.  Mexican Food FAIL.    
La Cocina de Consuelo,308,Server was so standoffish which makes no sense when you re such a small place. The food was less than okay. We re tourists and disappointed.
La Cocina de Consuelo,309,Good tasting breakfast burritos  expect for the fact that they don t fill the burrito all the way with ingredients and the prices are too high for the amount of food that you get.
La Cocina de Consuelo,310,It s like your own personal grandma cooking for you. If you want a taste of home cooked mexican food  texas style . This is your place. Watch the salsa  it s muy caliente 
La Cocina de Consuelo,311,The tortillas are the best in Austin...I get breakfast tacos or burritos here at least once a week.  The portions are large and inexpensive.
La Cocina de Consuelo,312,The only place in Austin we felt compelled to visit twice while on a five-day visit.  And that was mostly for the tortillas.  Migas were great.  Nopales salad was good.  The black beans in the breakfast burritos weren t that great  but the tortillas--SO GOOD.  Did I mention the tortillas   I d eat almost anything made of those.
La Cocina de Consuelo,313,Let me just say that I eat here all the time  and the food is always freshly made and different from most other Mexican restaurants. The breakfast tacos are a healthy portion packed with good stuff in a remarkable tortilla - whole-wheat is my favorite.  The lunch specials are a good deal. You should definitely try this place 
La Cocina de Consuelo,314,. . . so you need to think of this places as a  kitchen  - not a traditional restaurant  and you ll be fine.  what i mean is  you shouldn t expect your server  to wait on you hand and foot and  god forbid  you might have to get up and ask for a water refill at the counter - bc after all your server is also the cook  the hostess  and the bus boy.  with that being said  imagine yourself at your abuelita s house.  you come in  she s excited to see you  but more excited to feed you  bc she just made a new batch of enchildas.  don t forget  sabado gigante is on the little tiny tv with the foil antenna  and she needs to give you back the pants she hemmed for you  bc guess what  - she s a super-multifaceted abuelita deluxe.  yeah   do you feel warm and fuzzy   i do.  that s exactly what this place is.  we walked in and immediately were greeted by a very nice and kind cook host server hybrid  1 of 2 only  and got to ordering.  i had the al pastor tacos and friend had picadillo.  we both got our food relatively quickly and thought to ourselves  this is how mom does it.  our tortillas were thick and fresh.  our meat was perfectly seasoned and garnishes seemed freshly chopped instead of yanked out of the fridge from some sysco container.  salsa was great.  its tomatillo based and has raw based ingredients in it but something is definitely sauteed  maybe the onions  before its all mixed together.  needless to say we finished 3 little bowls off.  prices were ok  8.99 for my plate   but honestly  i didn t really care when everything seemed so freshly prepared and handmade.  this food is cooked with love.  they seem like they would be almost as happy if it was just a kitchen and there was no profit being made - like they just wanna feed ya  make your tummy feel goooood.   if la cocina de consuelo was a person  i would smile and hug it.
La Cocina de Consuelo,315,Just the type of place yelp helps you find - I ve been about 10 times now  often bringing new people and they ve all loved it.  The verde chicken enchiladas are possibly the best you ll ever eat  and the fresh tortillas are probably unlike any others you ve tasted.   I also love the mango cactus salads and fajitas.  Further  because it s always the same cook  it s consistently excellent.
La Cocina de Consuelo,316,I go to La Cocina de Consuelo for their big as your head breakfast burritos that are muy delicioso. If you go for dinner and are a vegetarian  your options are limited. But  the mushroom and spinage enchiladas are great  especially when paired with their mango jicama salad.
La Cocina de Consuelo,317,The enchiladas are wonderful  the salsa is hot  and the monterrey chicken is one of the best mexican dishes ever  also very hot   Tuesdays special  carne guisada is probably the best I ve ever had  and I try it everywhere. The wait staff is wonderful  I go here about once a week and feel like I m at home.  I love the small seating area  and the attention to detail in the cuisine.  I ve had everything on the dinner menu and couldn t say a bad thing on any of it  this is just real clean interior mexican food served with heart and soul.  Sadly  I ve not had the breakfast menu here  though all I hear is great things  and if it s anything in comparison with the dinner there should be no let down here. BYOB
La Cocina de Consuelo,318,The tacos were very good  as were the tortilla chips and salsa.  However  I don t know when we ve encountered a surlier waiter.  Perhaps takeout would be a better option.
La Cocina de Consuelo,319,EXCELLENT breakfast tacos.  Had egg  turkey bacon  and cheese on a whole wheat tortilla.  Pretty good size  was full after one   and the temperature and texture of the tortilla was GOOD.  Would like to return to this place to try their other menu items.
La Cocina de Consuelo,320,The breakfast tacos here are delicious and cheap. I definitely recommend getting calabasita  sauteed squash  as one of your fillings. The place is cute and cozy too 
La Cocina de Consuelo,321,3.5 stars. tiny place  blink and you might miss it. parking and seating are limited so maybe try coming during an off hour or getting it to go. service was pretty slow but it seems to be a small  family run business. prices are a little high for mexican food. the salsa is spicy  queso is good but small portion. I tried the potato enchiladas and they were really tasty.   will definitely try to make it back for breakfast and if in the area  wouldn t hesitate to stop in.
La Cocina de Consuelo,322,This place is Great   I honestly felt like i was at my Grandmas house sitting at the kitchen table and she was cooking me dinner     Everything was very good from the chips  amp  queso to my Beef Enchiladas   The hot sauce is a little spicy but very authentic... Seemed like everything was made fresh    I would highly suggest This place if you want to feel like your at home getting a good home cooked meal   
La Cocina de Consuelo,323,Very tasty large tacos and large burritos with good flavors. We go in off hours because parking and access can be a problem.
La Cocina de Consuelo,324,Best tortillas in austin. Amazing queso. Great eggs  migas  breakfast tacos  or huevos rancheros  Eat here.
La Cocina de Consuelo,325,Who wouldn t want their very own  hispanic abuelita to make them a meal   Now you can have it  This restaurant is just that  Consuelo  your very own abuelita  spanish for little grandma  cooking to your exact specification.  Move over taco deli  move over breakfast tacos everywhere... the stuffed breakfast burrito of the cocina has fresh and tasty ingredients you won t get other places  peppers  zuccini  real fresh tomatoes and onions  turkey bacon  quality meat chorizo and more.... three ingredients of your choosing all for   2.50.  AWESOME 
La Cocina de Consuelo,326,Yummy  Sara s special wrapped up in their fantastic wheat tortilla. Very nice and fast service. Convenient parking in the back so you don t get stuck trying to back out onto busy Burnet.
La Cocina de Consuelo,327,BEST BREAKFAST BURRITO EVER    Literally my wife and I eat here every day we humanly can. Large burrito  high fiber  not to greasy  veggies from spinach to napolitos  good protein but doesn t taste that way or you can cancel all that and get some greasier food. However  even their chorizo in its savory goodness is prepared better than  Salsa not five alarm fire hot but not for the timid.
La Cocina de Consuelo,328,It s my new fav Mexican spot. Their fideo is excellent. The potato enchiladas are the best. Must try 
La Cocina de Consuelo,329,Visiting Austin. Like pungent salsa. Don t miss out on this Mexican delight. Food is tasty. Tortillas are hand made without any machine. Don t miss the Chile Relleno special on Fridays and the Tortilla Soup and Taco combo. A food connoisseur s top 10 favorite for sure.
La Cocina de Consuelo,330,I m from the Rio Grande Valley so I ve got some high standards for good tacos  burritos  etc. This restaurant was great  Limited seating inside  but I liked that. Super friendly and helpful staff too.  On to the food. I got a breakfast burrito with bacon  avocado  egg  beans  and cheese all wrapped up in an amazing homemade tortilla. The fillings were delicious  but the tortilla clinched it. I don t know what it is about Austin  but places around here that serve  breakfast tacos  use store bought tortillas and commit the ultimate sin of not heating the tortilla on a comal until its slightly crispy. Who wants a cold  gummy tortilla  Anyways  La Cocina de Consuela does it right. The coffee s not bad either.
La Cocina de Consuelo,331,First off   this place has a really cool  hole-in-the-wall atmosphere. It s definitely just an old house that s been converted. The food was pretty good  the salsa was incredible  We got barbacoa and a stuffed burrito with their ground taco meat. Barbacoa was sort of tasteless  the taco meat was awesome. However  the service was terrible. We sat on the patio and felt basically forgotten about. After taking our drink order  water and tea   my husband had to go to the front to find out where our server went  after minutes of waiting.  Further  he had to walk to the counter to get his tea refilled  after waiting for over 10 minutes with an empty glass . We wanted to rate it higher but the staff just wasn t up to par.
La Cocina de Consuelo,332,This place is so good    and i can walk to it from my house. i love her cooking and her portions are very generous. Shes a bit pricey but its worth it    
La Cocina de Consuelo,333,First off  I should say that true mexiacan food is not something I m overly familiar with. As a Canadian  mexican food typivally consists of Taco Bell and Chilli s if you re  really feeling adventerous   Anyhow  this little place was amazing  I had the Huevos rancheros which was served with a freshly made  warm tortilla served beside homemade refried beans and french fry potatos. It was the last meal I had before leaving Austin and it successfully left a lasting impression.
La Cocina de Consuelo,334,Absolutely love this place.  The food is fantastic.  It feels like you are on vacation and stumbled upon someone s kitchen  they invite you in and insist on cooking the most amazing meal.  I ll be honest  I ve only eaten breakfast there  but can only imagine that dinner would be equally as good.
La Cocina de Consuelo,335,Tell them you want a Gerry.  It s potato  egg  cheese  bacon and avocado on a wheat tortilla.  Actually if you tell them you want a Gerry they will probably just look at you funny because it has yet to make it onto the list of specialty breakfast tacos next to the register. But nonetheless  La Cocina de Consuelo produces the best breakfast tacos in Austin hands down.
La Cocina de Consuelo,336,This small  unassuming place along Burnet just doesn t stick out in any way -- and for that I m glad   It might be too popular otherwise   With only 5 or 6 tables inside one might first think that maybe it s not a good place to eat.  Instead I was reminded of home.  The food reminded me even more.  My friend had the mole  which he said was great.  He had a side of nopalito  cactus  salad.  That was very good.  I had beef fajita tacos  and they were very good as well.  It s hard to mess up fajitas.  These were seasoned perfectly  had plenty of meat in each taco  and I left wanting more.  The refried beans on the side definitely took me back to my childhood.  I grew up on food like this in South Texas.  The queso  while good  was just too small of a serving.  The chips and salsa were perfect for me.  We also tried the tres leches flan  which Consuelo herself said she made.  It was amazing   I have never been a fan of flan  but I m a convert now.  Their main business apparently is catering  which is why there s not a huge deal of attention paid to the eat-in decor.  But it is pleasant enough.  I ve also had the breakfast tacos here  and they are large.  All tortillas are homemade and made on site.  Prices are reasonable  and portions are large.  I ll be back.
La Cocina de Consuelo,337,Went here 4 times during a week stay in Austin- once for dinner and thrice for breakfast. And it was a 15 minute drive from where we were  The migas are SO GOOD  Their enchiladas are incredible  And as other reviewers have mentioned  the tortillas are mind blowing. Thicker than usual  perfectly grilled  you ll be scarfing them plain. Mango   jicama salad was great too. Friendly staff  super fast service  and cheap.
La Cocina de Consuelo,338,This is my favorite neighborhood spot for  breakfast tacos   more accurate to call them burritos . They use these thick  homemade flour tortillas that are different from any other Austin breakfast taco joint  I highly recommend you try them out some morning. It s a tiny place  though  so call ahead if you re in a hurry.  There s a decent selection of vegetarian options  my favorite lunch dish is the chipotle potato enchiladas....really love that fiery  smoky sauce.  Parking can be a problem  it s best to park in back  if possible  and it s a small place with a small staff  so know these limitations before you go there.  And a couple of times  out of maybe 100-150 visits   the potatoes in the breakfast taco were undercooked.  I thought about taking off one star for these minor flaws  but c mon...I love this place  so five stars is what they get.
La Cocina de Consuelo,339,It s ok.  The barbacoa was A bit oily.  I have has some barbacoa that is tender and not greasy on the East side. Hint  try chapala s.
La Cocina de Consuelo,340,This morning I decided to stop by this place since I ve had my eye on it for a while. I ordered two breakfast tacos since they are always kind of small and I have a big appetite. There is no way I can eat two of those  but luckily  there is always lunch. It was SO good  I can t wait to try the other items in the menu. I think the name says it all  you walk in and it s like you are in someone s kitchen and it looks like they make everything from scratch.
La Cocina de Consuelo,341,Completely disappointing for a group that loves Mexican food. I cannot recommend anything about the experience  the food was insipid and they messed up half our orders.
La Cocina de Consuelo,342,I have driven past Consuelo s Kitchen a bunch of times and thought  I need to try that place.   After going last week  I am truly sorry that I waited so long.  Let s start with the basics.  Consuelo s refried beans are awesome.  In all the rush to go lard-free  sometimes it s nice to have the real thing.  These taste like my aunt s refrieds and that s damn good.  Bacon makes everything better.  But Consuelo s no one-trick pony.  Tortillas  another pillar of Mexican food  are homemade and fantastic.  Both flour and corn versions were fresh and tasty  perhaps the products of recipes and techniques passed down from generation to generation or maybe off the back of box of masa harina  Consuelo was busy  so I didn t get the chance to ask .  Either way  they re delicious.  You could make a meal out of both  but you don t have to.  Our breakfast brunch visit started with the queso  and this was a good entry.  My migas rocked with the potatoes and salsa roja.  My wife was shocked to see nopalitos and rajas on the menu for breakfast burritos  and they are an excellent addition  that s from both of us .  The restaurant is in an old house that has only been partially converted  still a bathtub in the bathroom .  Frankly  this is part of the charm and consistent with food and service that is like being invited into someone s house.  Warm and friendly.  The dining room is a little tight on space  but I d say it s cozy  especially on a cold day.  If you haven t been yet  take a trip over to Burnet and 45th.  You ll be pleasantly surprised.
La Cocina de Consuelo,343,Ugh  I almost hate to write a review for this place because it s such a hole-in-the-wall tiny little place and I can t have it getting crowded when I walk over from my house for dinner.  But. I shall suffer through per the demands of yelp gods expecting me to do my duty.  ha  duty . SO. La Cocina de Consuelo is a fabulous little joint waitressed by Consuelo s niece  and she has the sweetest face and some good service.  To start with-The salsa  no  haters  it isn t tomato based  that s why they call it  verde  salsa not  rojo   leaves a good warm spice in your throat and leaves your tongue aching for more  I think that s the crack they put in it...  The chips are just chips  but they re chips. I had the Pollo del Monterrey  which was well cooked and the chicken was juicy-but it was a simple dish  chicken  cheese and a different verde sauce than the salsa.  My dad had the Tacos al Pastor  delicious  with the jicama salad was sweet and went well with the spicy  tang of the salsa.  The price was pretty great too   60 for five of us  They also have parking in the back.
La Cocina de Consuelo,344,Really  like eating in someone s kitchen  in the best possible sense. The apparent owner is wonderfully mothering. The plates come with a wide variety of sides not seen at your average tex mex place  fideos  nopalitos  mango jicama salad . And the main dishes are a little different too. We got salmon enchiladas and tacos al pastor. The enchiladas were good but a little too salmony for me - I m not marking off for it because I ve decided I probably just don t like salmon in my enchiladas. But the tacos al pastor were perfect. I was a little uncertain about beef tacos al pastor  but they were incredibly succulent and flavorful. But the clincher was the  tres leches  flan - about 5 times bigger and richer than your average flan - like the perfect mixture of flan and cheesecake  but like I said  bigger. Beware though- this place is not open Saturday  or Sunday or Monday night 
La Cocina de Consuelo,345,Had the Wednesday special today - Chicken Mole.  The Mole was great but the chicken was way overcooked  dry and tough.  The Flan was unbelievably good 
La Cocina de Consuelo,346,went on sunday morning.  sevice was horrible.  did not want to accommodate our large party.  food was not the best. next time i want bad service and to eat off a paper plate  i ll stay home. hade to even get my own coffee.  will never recommend.
La Cocina de Consuelo,347,Amazing place -- best salsa EVER and best tortilla soup    This place is so quaint and cozy.  It s my favorite lunch destination.
La Cocina de Consuelo,348,The number one reason why I love this little place  the salsa.  It is on fire and flavorful.  Number 2  great homemade tortillas and Number 3  migas - great for hangover especially because of the side of home fries.  Drawbacks  Limited space and my friends noted the last time we were there that the refried beans actually tasted a little fishy  literally . I haven t tried it for dinner  yet  but know that it is byob  so that is definitely in the works for the future.
La Cocina de Consuelo,349,I found La Cocina de Consuelo to be very charming and low-key  family-owned restaurant. Very simple and everyone is friendly. I had the taco salad  which was pretty good. I m giving three stars because I d like to go back another time.
La Cocina de Consuelo,350,Fresh tortillas made on the premises add even more authenticity to already honest homemade food. Everything we had for lunch was delicious from entree to sides. We will come back here again and again.
La Cocina de Consuelo,351,Amazing and locally owned mexican restaurant.  Consuelo was back in the kitchen making everything that hit our plates...including the tortillas   Prices are super reasonable too.  They don t have a liquor license  but you can do BYOB  so that works for me   I was with a group of five and we all had different things  each was delish   In fact  I was torn as to what to eat  so had the waiter pick from the enchiladas for me and his pics  chicken and potato - yep  potato  were amazing   Highly recommend 
La Cocina de Consuelo,352,Everything is lovingly made from scratch... And Connie and the staff are extraordinary. Great food in great ambiance for a great price. Look no further. This is where you ll be glad you went there.
La Cocina de Consuelo,353,Forget going home to eat my mom s home cooking  Cocina de Consuelo took that spot. This place has the best Mexican food this side of Mexico  Now if only she would make some menudo.....  D
La Cocina de Consuelo,354,A-OK exactly describes my experience at La Cocina de Consuelo.  The interior of the restaurant was small and charming.  The food  however  was nothing spectacular. I had the beef flautas with a side of rice and refried beans  which also came w  sour cream. Everything needed a bit more salt  and the complimentary salsa was not particularly crave-able worthy.  Wasn t bad.. wasn t particularly memorable.  Pluses  Great location and parking in the rear.
La Cocina de Consuelo,355,I m Mexican-American. I don t always eat Mexican but when I do  it s probably authentic. This place is. Stay thirsty  my friends
La Cocina de Consuelo,356,i rated it ok bc today was my first time. Its was a nice cheap hole in the wall with good food.
La Cocina de Consuelo,357,Had a veggie stuffed burrito. Wife had the tortilla soup  and her sister had the taco plate. All was delicious  and we ll definitely go back. Small joint. It s byob  but very warm and friendly. Even on the back porch. The homemade tortillas are the best part. It s like Mexican soul food.
La Cocina de Consuelo,358,best food  best prices  huge portions   tiny parking lot    
La Cocina de Consuelo,359,I don t even know where to start.. I ve only had their breakfast burritos and I literally felt like I was in Mexico. Talk about authentic. They were diligently rolling out the dough for my burrito when I walked in and my mouth started to water immediately at the sight  I can t believe I ve JUST barely tried Cocina de Consuelo and now consider it one of Austin s best kept secrets. I
La Cocina de Consuelo,360,Delicious food just like mom made. great and fast service. I recommend this to anyone who likes authentic Mexican food.
La Cocina de Consuelo,361,The restaurant is in a converted house. Parking in back. There are just 6 tables inside and a few outside  so don t bring a crowd and expect to dine in. The food reminded me of eating at grandma s. I can t wait to go back. FYI  No alcohol is served  but you are welcome to bring your own. The menu is on their website  but doesn t list the dessert options. They do have desserts  and they are yummy. I expect to be a regular customer.
La Cocina de Consuelo,362,Being from Houston I believe the food was ok. I don t know just that I m use to all the taqueria  being very ghetto yet very good. This place has a pretty nice interior yet the taste was just off for me. I guess with good Mexican food it s the opposite of the looks. Maybe this may sound a bit harsh  I could be wrong though thinking the food in Houston is much better might be due to the fact we usually eat there after a night out at the  bar.Lol. But don t get mr wrong there are still plenty of bad ones in Houston as well
La Cocina de Consuelo,363,Excellent salsa  great queso  fantastic chicken enchiladas. Can t beat it for the price  in my experience.
La Cocina de Consuelo,364,I had breakfast there for the first time this week  how have I not been there before   and it was fantastic.  If you re looking for tasty  hot tortillas filled with fresh ingredients made to order  then you ve come to the right place.  I had a burrito filled with egg  avocado  and potato and a coffee for about  5.  The burritos are about the equivalent of two breakfast tacos and definitely enough food.  I would eat the tortillas just plain they are THAT good.
La Cocina de Consuelo,365,Everything tastes so fresh  light  healthy and delicious.   Love their Friday lunch special - Chile Relleno. They use just the right amount of cheese  unlike other places where there s way too much cheese . I always get their mango jicama side.
La Cocina de Consuelo,366,Breakfast tacos are boss. Chicken mole is wonderful and the chicken tacos are tasty. The salsa however may as well be lava in a bowl.
La Cocina de Consuelo,367,Good food and great lemonade. It s like eating out in someone s home. The service was prompt and the food was fresh. BYOB 
La Cocina de Consuelo,368,These breakfast burritos are the best  Fresh ingredients  multitude of filling options  and the tortillas rock. Wish they were open on Saturdays.
La Cocina de Consuelo,369,I love this place   Great breakfast tacos....they re not greasy at all  amp  they re reasonably priced.... and  of course  they have great enchilada plates  that s what they re best known for .   I ve been waiting for an excuse to use them as a caterer.....someday I ll get that chance    oh....and they have the best Tres Leches I ve ever had in my life 
La Cocina de Consuelo,370,My first impression visually made me want to find somewhere else. Its a tiny hole in tje wall. But I went ahead and went in. I am SO glad I did. It was some of the best Mexican food I ve had in a long time. I haven t cleaned my plate totally in years  but all I had left was a little residue. To start we had great chips  spicy  but not too spicy  hot sauce  fresh guacamole and great queso. The people I was with had the fajitas and tamales. Fajitas were the best he s ever had. And her tamales were seasoned perfectly and she didn t bathe them in chili like normal. My enchiladas were fantastic.  Even the tea and pralines were awesome. AMAZING service. Friendly and helpful. Food came out very quickly. I will definitely eat here again when I come back through Austin 
La Cocina de Consuelo,371,Thanks to all the great Yelp reviews we tried La Cocina de Consuelo  and what a lovely experience  I felt like I was back in my grandmothers kitchen who s name was also Consuelo. The rajas and the corn tortillas are home made as is the rest of the food the migas are awesome. I can hardly wait for Friday to try the chile rellenos for dinner.
La Cocina de Consuelo,372,Cute little lunch spot with freshly-cooked homestyle Mexican food.  I went for lunch and had the cheese enchiladas.  It s a very basic plate -- fresh-tasting tortillas  red sauce  cheddar cheese  and refried beans -- but it was flavorful and not greasy.  For sides I had black beans  excellent  with an interesting spiciness  and the jicama-mango salsa  which lent a nice balance to the plate .  As long as you re not expecting anything too fancy  you should be pleasantly surprised.  The salsa verde served at the outset was chunky  spicy  and entirely enjoyable.  Note that there are only a couple of tables  maybe 5   but it turned over pretty quickly while I was there.
La Cocina de Consuelo,373,Food was very good. Question adherence to food safety. Seeing the cashier go from taking cash  drinking a soda to cutting tomatoes and other prep without washing hands was not encouraging.
La Cocina de Consuelo,374,So very good.  I work nearby so I am tempted to go there often.  I usually try to get their specials and have not regretted it once.  I love their carne guisada  caution  it doesn t have the gravy we all are familiar with carne guisada but once I had their version  I didn t miss the gravy at all.  I loved their cheesy chile relleno.  It was HUGE and so very delicious.  Love their chips and salsa.  I have to force myself to stop eating the salsa.  Their tortillas are like mom s tortillas right off the comal. For those of you trying to eat a little more healthier  there s a mango jicama salad that is refreshing and light.  Also  the napalito salad is great and is not as heavy as eating the traditional rice and beans.  But it you do go for the rice and beans  you won t regret it.  The plates are very reasonably priced and  once the server gets to know you  you even get a smile.    
La Cocina de Consuelo,375,Excellent food and friendly service.  Loved the fajitas and looking forward to trying the verde chicken enchiladas next time.
La Cocina de Consuelo,376,The breakfast tacos are HUGE and only  2.99   When I got my order I was happy that I only ordered one because it was a behemoth.  I am really impressed by their food and laid back atmosphere.  The turkey bacon is the best I have ever had hands down  and the homemade flour tortillas were so good.  I will defintely come back soon 
La Cocina de Consuelo,377,The best chicken enchilada w green tomatillo sauce I ve had in many  many moons.  I recommend the mango salad side too.  The salsa is also a notch or two above standard fare.  Very spicy with flavor to match.
La Cocina de Consuelo,378,I stopped in for lunch today because it s only a stones throw from my house. The weather permitted me to sit on the patio in the back and I throughly enjoyed the breeze while nibbling on chips and salsa  which had a spicy kick. The waiter recommended the special of the day  Fajitas. I was especially impressed by the variety of sides that Consuelo offers...not just the monotonous rice and beans routine. I tried the Fideo  vermicelli  and Mango Jicama salad. The vermicelli was kind of like a thick Mexican version of Campbell s chicken noodle soup. That s a compliment  by the way. I d never had jicama before and found it to be quite crisp and refreshing. One thing I didn t like  however  was that the Chicken Fajitas were a bit bland. The taste completely changed after a sprinkle of salt  though. I loooved the freshness and quality of the ingredients. The portion was not too overwhelming  either. No i-can t-move-for-two-hours food coma afterwards. This left room for dessert. After much consideration  I tried the cheese flan  which was near perfect. It seemed like a flan that could be appreciated by those who don t usually like flan...if that makes sense. Next time I ll have to try their breakfast tacos 
La Cocina de Consuelo,379,this place is the best. my wife is a regular and I get to go on the weekends. fresh homemade tortillas  hard to find in Austin  and good overall food  amp  service. the barbacoa was the best I have had...topped with fresh pico.
La Cocina de Consuelo,380,We hired Connie  aka Consuelo  to cater our wedding and I am so happy with how it turned out. Everything was impeccable  from the authentic Mexican service ware  to the mouth-watering enchiladas to the speedy service and clean-up. The whole night my guests kept commenting to me about how delicious the food was. Connie and her catering staff were great during all the planning and extremely flexible  even to the day before the wedding  So glad we chose them to help us with this special day 
La Cocina de Consuelo,381,Possibly the best flour tortilla I have ever had... and I love flour tortillas.  Super nice.  Super clean.  Super friendly.  Great vibe.  The coffee looked cheap... but it was wonderful.  I can t wait to come back for dinner.  I was going to go today but closed for dinner on Mondays.  There is always tomorrow.    
La Cocina de Consuelo,382,Love this place  Best breakfast tacos in town. So fresh and non-greasy. Wish they were open on Sat. though.
La Cocina de Consuelo,383,Food was excellent   Authentic Mexican food made with soul but not too much grease. Guacamole was delicious. Affordable price and comfortable atmosphere.
La Cocina de Consuelo,384,Yay  I finally found my perfect neighborhood Mexican joint  Came here today for breakfast and had chilaquiles that were made with an amazing red sauce with chicken that tasted like it had been roasted stewed all day - it was stunning. Served with skinny fried potatoes that tasted like Mom s and some pretty damn good refried beans. The salsa and guacamole and corn tortillas were AMAZING. Looking forward to trying the barbacoa lunch plate next   Very small place - only about 6 tables inside and 3 outside  but it wasn t crowded. Nice and quiet and chill... def going back 
La Cocina de Consuelo,385,So I finally made it here. I have been wanting to go but cant seem to get there before 3 PM. So once inside there were only like 5 or 6 tables they seemed steadily busy at about 1 30 PM. Me and my girlfriend grabbed a couple menus and were told to have a seat anywhere. The special today was chicken mole but I did not try it. So they gave us chips and salsa and I ordered a guacamole. The salsa was good a bit too spicy for the Mrs. The guacamole was very stringy and was in dire need of salt. I ordered a Milanese tor ta that was an actual piece of meat instead of mystery meat you always find at other places. BUT  the roll was pretty old and kept flaking and falling apart. There was like shredded orange cheese on it and back to the meat it was pretty tough and grissly. She had enchiladas which were bland and dry the whole plate looked like leftovers the next day out of the microwave. The white rice was not too good either. I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED we both wanted to like this place    
La Cocina de Consuelo,386,nice mole burrito. chips   salsa were meh. nice people  like the atmosphere
La Cocina de Consuelo,387,Delicious salsa.  I had the torta de milanesa which was very good.  Great bread.  I had lemon  limeade to drink which was very refreshing.  Want to try the breakfast tacos next time we re in Austin 
La Cocina de Consuelo,388,great burritos and breakfast tacos. only thing  i wish they were open on saturday and i wish they had taco sized options for lunch.  delicious fresh real mexican food
La Cocina de Consuelo,389,I had first heard about this place from yelp and the stellar reviews got me excited to check it out. Before I went  I told my mom about it and she decided to go. She said the mushroom  spinach enchiladas were amazing but since I basically think all Tex-Mex can only get so good I thought she was over exaggerating. Turns out she was right  These enchiladas were unlike anything I had ever encountered in my 25 years of Tex-Mex dining  all you ever really eat in TX . The cheese was light and not at all greasy and the spinach was plentiful and fresh. I think they must have used some sort of wine reduction in the sauce because it had flavors that certainly aren t part of the standard Tex-Mex offerings. The queso was really great too - also light but extremely flavorful. As for the service I can t complain  We came 30 minutes after they had closed for the day but they still let us in and were completely friendly - despite the fact that we didn t order that much food.  Looking back we weren t exactly ideal diners - sorry   I will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend this place  What a great find - thanks yelp 
La Cocina de Consuelo,390,My boyfriend and I were having a battle for the best chorizo taco in town and while he chose Torchy s  my favorite is Doug s breakfast taco at Consuelo s. He did admit that Consuelo s uses better quality ingredients. Not only does this place have good food  but Consuelo herself came out of the kitchen and jump started my car on a busy weekday morning  I love this place.
La Cocina de Consuelo,391,For authentic mexican food made fresh and hot  then go here. Consuelo just opened up her kitchen for dinner and WOW her food made our mouths water and our bellies very happy. She makes all the food herself...even the tortillas   Check out her breakfast tacos also  Love  love  this place.
La Cocina de Consuelo,392,The food is absolutely unbeatable  but make sure to check the hours closely--closed on Sunday evening and Saturday. Cramped parking lot  and tiny inside  but worth it for the food.
La Cocina de Consuelo,393,I love this place  never been for breakfast  but for all the people that don t like it or didn t think it was that good. Then PLEASE don t go there anymore so I can have a nice peaceful lunch and not have to worry about a huge crowd  please stay away.  And let me also say this place is NOT Tex-Mex  anyone who thinks it is is off their rocker  this is Mexican Food...........and some of the best around.....
La Cocina de Consuelo,394,YUM  We headed here when a place down the road was too busy Sunday morning and I m so glad we did  It s as tiny as the other place but didn t seem as crowded. Louis had a couple of breakfast burritos with eggs  amp  other stuff  I wasn t paying attention  and said they were fresh and tasty--and the tortillas were exquisite. I had a chicken quesadilla. It was very good  but had only three slices where I m used to seeing four of that size. What pushed the meal from good to fantastic was the  special queso  with a huge dollop of guac. OMG  spicy and flavorful and so  so fresh. We ll be back 
La Cocina de Consuelo,395,I had the breakfast burrito with eggs  tomato  refried beans  and chorizo. He had migas with black beans. Both were quite delicious  Service was friendly and fast  and the price was great.
La Cocina de Consuelo,396,Fabulous  Good service  unpretentious surroundings  friendly people  and pretty good food. It is no 5-star restaurant  but for what it is  it is lovely. A great little neighborhood Mexican kitchen with spicy salsa and fresh ingredients.
La Cocina de Consuelo,397,Outstanding migas with excellent homemade corn tortillas. The migas aren t super cheap   7  but the price is reasonable for what you get.
La Cocina de Consuelo,398,I just bought and devoured a chorizo egg potato and cheese burrito on a wheat tortilla. It was awesome. I actually got nostalgic because it tasted just like my grandmother s growing up. Also  the salsa is spicy but delicious on top. Thanks for making my morning La Cocina de Consuelo 
La Cocina de Consuelo,399,Consuelo s is the best Mexican in Austin  hands down.  I visited there three times per week for four years and they cared for me as if I was one of their own from the very first day.  The food is so good  very consistent  and the service is excellent.  The atmosphere is great  the chips and salsa and GUACAMOLE are a must.  I moved recently to the other side of town and am kicking myself over it.  I miss walking across the street to eat this amazing food.  Get the avacado tacos if you are vegetarian  and the cheese enchiladas are also deelish.  Amazing amazing place.  Love it.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,1,My friend and I came here for happy hour and really enjoyed the restaurant  It s very causal inside and there is a lot of seating. I ordered the happy hour nachos and she ordered the sliders. Both of our dishes were delicious and the service was great too.  The cornbread was complimentary with our meal  but I personally did not enjoy it. The cornbread came with three pieces and weirdly enough  one piece was sweet and the other two were spicy... not what a were expecting  but they were free  so no loss there haha 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,2,Not good at all. Watery con queso sugary salsa Nothing to write home about nachos are full shrimp tacos the deserts were so bad the bread pudding was bad real bad and the flan was nothing to write home about  Service was reasonable aside from the fact that the champ spilled margaritas on my pants and did not even notice or apologize and each time he would bring a spoon or something he would hold it by the tip where you are supposed to put in your mouth  Another server who brought the guacamole had his finger on the side of the ball inserted in the guacamole  I enjoyed spending time with my friends of course so I m giving this place two
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,3,Visited Z Tejas while in town for a conference and had a pretty good time  The strawberry margaritas are superior to the regular  the queso was very appetizing  and that s saying something because I m a guac guy   the cornbread was a lot better than expected  and it was an all around good experience  The one exception is that the Diablo pasta could ve used more flavor  what type  not sure--maybe even salt would have done the trick   but my friend loved hers so that certainly shouldn t be a dealbreaker. Would recommend 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,4,Z tejas is one of my favorite places in Austin    Best weekend happy hour  You can t go wrong with anything on the menu. A must go 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,5,Z Tejas has been an all time favorite for many years  I rarely find myself in that area  West of Lamar on 6th   nevertheless when I happen to be stomping around that neighborhood I make a stop. They have one of the most delicious frozen Marg recipe  I m an unofficial local expert in the frozen beverage department  Enjoy drink  amp  food  vibe  decor  layout  multiple level seating  finally cheerful staff 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,6,Hard pass for me. Z Tejas seems to pass itself off as a higher end Tex-Mex restaurant  but this is where I draw the line. First  don t expect complimentary chips and salsa and second  don t expect refried beans    I ordered the Shrimp Enchiladas  which comes with cilantro-lime rice and  not refried  beans on the side. I truly believe all sides served should compliment your main course. I will give credit where it s due  The Shrimp Enchiladas   but as for the rice and beans  bland. The Shrimp Enchiladas were tasty  tender  and savory 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,7,This was a pretty decent place for lunch    My friends and I ordered the Nacho Z s  Yuca Fries  and Shrimp Tostada Bites to share. All of the appetizers were really great and I especially liked the nachos   I ordered the Baja Spinach and Mushroom Tacos for my entr e  but I was unfortunately disappointed by these. The tacos were soggy and falling apart. They tasted okay  but I was definitely underwhelmed after how great the appetizers were. I would ve given this place 5 stars if I didn t get the tacos  so I d definitely come back again but would order something else.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,8,Went here on a Saturday night and it was completely empty which was strange the food was super good though and very spicy the only think I wasn t happy with was the lack of chorizo on the salad. Also deff ask for the habanero salads
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,9,Mmmmmmm.  These crimini mushroom enchiladas were as tasty as they were beautiful.     We were greeted and seated quickly  we got there right before the Friday lunch crowd   and our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   We were there for a leisurely lunch  and the service was paced to match.  Our server checked on us several times  and we placed our orders when we were ready.  When the meal was over   we stayed and chatted and never felt hurried to leave.   No one was waiting for our table by the way.   Of course  the food was delicious. Can t wait to return 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,10,After hearing this Austin staple was closing early next year I decide I finally needed to check this place out. Not that we re lacking any Mexican restaurants in town but as Austin keeps changing we re fast losing old school Mexican joints like this one. ZTejas had it all for me  an extensive menu  ample indoor outdoor seating  downtown parking and good service what else could you ask for  I ended up trying out their migas dish for brunch while my partner tried out the adobo chorizo meatloaf. My migas was good but nothing too special but by far the meatloaf dish stood out to me for both its flavor and uniqueness. Brunch was accompanied by a nice view of the intimate outdoor patio seating a some live music that rounded out a nice dining experience. Don t come here looking for a fancy dining experience but I for one enjoyed myself and do hope they end up finding a new location downtown for future Austinite generations to enjoy 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,11,Update  Both my boyfriend and I were given an email to talk to management about our experience and for them to  make it right  I m sure that s JUST for aesthetics to make them look better on review platforms because no one has bothered to reply to both of our emails. Either that  or they re always  busy  and need better time management skills. I don t think there s a need to give Z Tejas another chance  plenty of other places with better food and definitely better customer service skills
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,12,We came here to celebrate my brother s girlfriend s graduation  and their eventual engagement  and had a party of about 15-20 people. They placed us in a party room with a major leak coming from the ceiling onto the stairwell to the table. Knowing this  they still placed us in that room. Their temporary solution was to have rags stuffed into the ceiling  hanging   which continued to leak and offer a very unappealing and unappetizing sight.  After a few drinks  the waiter said the leak was coming from the AC unit and they decided to turn off the AC. We re talking 90  degrees outside and humid. I notified the manager and asked if we could be placed in another room. He said he had one available but it was up to the waiter to move us. Their solution was to turn the AC back on and have a bucket placed below the leak.   The food was mediocre at best and the celebration was shadowed by the horrible experience.   Please do not come here.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,13,Cool little spot for happy hour and dinner. They have parking  but it s limited  and can be difficult during peak hours. There s both indoor and outdoor seating. When I arrived at 5pm  there was still plenty of indoor seating. Great spot for happy hour on Tuesdays. Half off margs and tacos a la carte on Tuesdays. They also have other happy hour deals. We sat at the bar where the bartender Scott gave us a couple recommendations after I had asked about the frozen margaritas. I m not a huge tequila person  yeah yeah  not the best place to be for happy hour   but they can make other drinks without. My friend ordered a frozen house marg and I ordered a frozen house marg with watermelon muddled. We ordered the Z Trio which came with their salsa  queso  and guac. It was fantastic. I really loved the queso  The thin chips also pair well with the trio.  Regarding customer service...Scott was helpful  but I m not sure if it was because he was in a bad mood or if I asked way too many questions that he seemed somewhat annoyed. He rarely checked in on my friend and I  even though we were sitting right in front of him at the bar. It s astounding how people rave about the customer service here  but I simply did not receive that same experience. The food and drinks were good nonetheless. I would come by again for happy hour out of convenience since it s close  but wouldn t go out of my way for this spot.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,14,Decent vegetarian options .. nice causal family setting but does looks like the place needs a bit of a renovation. service was good and fast.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,15,Love this spot. We visit every time we re in Austin. Drinks are great as well  Highly recommend   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,16,Great food and service  Tuesday night tequila half off. Margaritas are great. The guacamole and salsa was a good choice to start. For dinner the artichoke stuff chicken was very good.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,17,We always try to eat here at least once on our trips to Austin. Great tequila drinks Great patio dog friendly. Even have resident cat. We like  Catfish Tacos great for snack Inside large with bar area Enjoy the atmosphere Sometimes parking a bit tricky
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,18,I wrote off Z Tejas as a chain for way too long  My friend suggested it for brunch  and as soon as I reviewed the menu  I knew we had to go. I was craving breakfast enchiladas  and theirs sounded like exactly how I like mine. I ve never seen enchiladas listed with flour tortillas but that s just how these were made.  I m not a fan of corn tortillas.  Then  I had them filled with cheese  with eggs and a fruit cup on the side. My friend got a vegetarian omelet and was glad they could substitute a side of vegetables to make it even healthier. I don t know if complementary corn bread is only served at brunch  but it was another great touch. I ll have to come back to try more dishes soon 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,19,Wife and I were invited to the newly opening Ztejas palmer lane location.  It was a test run of the staff and kitchen.  Very good food  there was some hiccups from the kitchen  got my salad after I finished my main course  wife didn t get her strawberry lemonade or three dish appetizers until she asked the waiter twice  Those were the main issues  but the food was hot and tasty.  I had the Ahi appetizer and the Diablo Pasta with Shrimp  wife had the combination fajita platter.  We were both content.  I know the owners and management will get the wrinkles out before grand opening on April 18th. Give it a try  you ll be pleased.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,20,Stopped here along a road trip since they were able to get us in quickly. I m very glad we found this place because the food was delicious. I order their Barbacoa steet tacos and a margarita and it was very tasty 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,21,Have been wanting to try this for quite some time and finally got out here on a Friday night with a large party. We were able to get a table for 10  the day of and the servers here were pretty great.  The food took a while to come out  but we kept quite happy with the delicious corn bread that is served before the meals. This is better than bread and chips so it was a great first time having something like this.  It was about a month ago when we made our way out here so I don t exactly recall what I had  but the meal was delicious and certainly a good experience. The prices were very fair as well for its location so that was another positive note that I didn t expect. Definitely recommend this place to others 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,22,I love this restaurant. It has been more than a year since I last stopped by. The restaurant is attractive  spotless  the food delicious and the staff very accommodating. So glad to come back 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,23,Great food   fresh atmosphere and family oriented  Great taste in music  Cute food displays 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,24,I love this place for frozen margs and queso. They normally don t have a wait for small parties and parking is pretty easy. They have cornbread as a free app and it s SO good. Quesadillas are good too 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,25,It s my birthday. I made a reservation a week before mug birthday. I called on my birthday to confirm and they said they didn t have a reservation for me even though they confirmed it day of making. Showed up and was seated after a wait  didn t get our drink order for over an hour  didn t ever have our order taken  we had to order on their app. We we re a party of five and every single person was brought their dinner at least 15 minutes apart. Worst birthday ever. Don t ever come here  music is shitty and too fucking loud and you ll be lucky to see a server. If I could give this place negative stars I would. Thanks for ruining my birthday I love eating cold enchiladas because y all s kitchen can t pace it s fucking dishes. DONT COME HERE       
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,26,We just got here. Ordered an ahi tuna salad wanted to get an extra slide of tuna fish and they wanted to charge  20 dlls MORE. Isn t that extreme 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,27,The whole building needs to be gutted and renovated. It smells like mold. The a c has dropped condensation on me while eating. I ve had a bug in my drink twice. The food has really gone down hill. It s unfortunate because years ago it was good.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,28,Almost didn t stop here because of some recent reviews  but we did since it s so close to our Airbnb - and we re so happy we did   Everything was fantastic  Our server was wonderful  and pointed us to the appetizer trio when we tried to order queso. Best guacamole  queso  salsa trio ever  I was torn between fajitas and enchiladas  and our server let us know that the enchiladas were more popular. So I got cheese  which comes with 2 enchiladas - one with green sauce and one with red. The default side is rice and black beans  which I thought were wonderfully seasoned. Everything tasted fresh  My husband got chicken enchiladas with pinto beans instead of black  and cleaned his plate. We also got spicy margaritas  which came with huge strips of peppers. It was a Monday night  but the atmosphere was lively and everyone seemed to be having fun  The place is also huge  and has tons of space for private parties and a really big patio. We loved it 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,29,Always great food and fantastic service  The bearded wonder waiter us just all kinds of great and attentive. Thank you.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,30,What an amazing experience  Had a large group of 12 come in for a friends birthday and it was amazingggg  The food was another great review itself  BUT the service was amazing  Micheal was so attentive and fun  it was 10 10.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,31,Dirty water glasses  food wasn t hot  margaritas were meh  and the place just seems a bit  dirty. Our waiter was nice  but he boasted about the top shelf margarita saying it had the  heaviest pour . Nope  it did not. the chicken had a strange texture-it tasted low quality. I don t think I ll be back unfortunately.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,32,This used to be on my list of top places  with a particular penchant for their happy hour. But this time I was a little disappointed. Portions have shrunk over the last couple of years  and it was honestly not as good as I remember. They do a good job bringing in local music and playing it in the next door building  so I would go for that  more than I would recommend their happy hour  even with the discounted pricing.   We did throw them a curve ball with adding two more guests to our table  and the staff did well with that. I do recommend the patio seating  which has heaters for the warmer days  and a cross breeze for the hot summer ones.   All in all  it is decent place to grab a meal. Just maybe not top of my list anymore.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,33,Have been wanting to try this for quite some time and finally got out here on a Friday night with a large party. We were able to get a table for 10  the day of and the servers here were pretty great.   The food took a while to come out  but we kept quite happy with the delicious corn bread that is served before the meals. This is better than bread and chips so it was a great first time having something like this.   It was about a month ago when we made our way out here so I don t exactly recall what I had  but the meal was delicious and certainly a good experience. The prices were very fair as well for its location so that was another positive note that I didn t expect. Definitely recommend this place to others 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,34,This was a last min attempt to grab some local cuisine. Hmm not a pleasant experience. Despite the somewhat decent facade the interior screams greasy diner. The emphasis here being reasonably priced alcohol or grub.  We ordered the following guac and chips  sans the queso  and green chile enchiladas. The free cornbread is actually decent.  The guac and chips are poor. The chips were shimmering with oil and left a greasy oil residue after holding them. One of the rare occasions where a guac and chips were left mostly untouched.  The main didn t fare any better. The enchiladas have a nice kick but the filling is mundane and so are the sides. Hmm not worth a revisit.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,35,This was The best Mexican restaurant we ate at while our visit to Texas   Mushroom enchiladas with mole sauce was out of this world yummy. We added Steak to ours.  Service was amazing   Our server  Michael  Was so friendly and careful in catering to my gluten and many food allergies.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  The building may turn you off but don t let it.  The food is amazing 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,36,Great spot for happy hour - everyday  complimentary cornbread  yummy  . We had the chicken fajita and enchilada. Both dishes were really good. Our waiter said we couldn t go wrong with any entree  so take that as you will. However  I highly recommend checking this place out. Taking away one star because the parking situation is intimidating during busy hours. Not the restaurants  fault but still apart of the experience.   Get the paradise margarita   Trivia night on Wednesdays Taco and tequila night on Tuesdays
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,37,Used to come to this location long ago. Too bad the quality of service has gone down. Appetizers and drinks took so long to come out that we decided to get entrees somewhere else.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,38,4 stars because the asada tacos were bomb    this place has a cute atmosphere  and nice outside patio. Staff is friendly and they place nice Spanish throwbacks
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,39,Went to to Z tejas for Happy Hour  and it was such a great experience  The waiter Nicholas was awesome  super friendly and chatty.   I had the street tacos from the appetizer menu and they were delicious  I def want to go back and try more of the apps to share    I also had the spicy jalapeno margarita  it was refreshing yet spicy  just how I like it. Not overly powerful spice  I also had the frozen margarita  which was actually very good. Not like your typical frozen margaritas  which give you a brain freeze to even take a sip  I was nervous about getting it  for this reason alone  but Nicholas assured me that they don t make theirs so frozen that you can t drink it.   Also  super cute patio  large enough for a group or just a few  I will definitely be frequenting this place again 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,40,I didn t try the whole menu  so I can t speak to the whole experience.  The ceviche app was as good as it comes. Full of flavor and very well put together.  The ranch water and margaritas were exceptional.  And catching a 50  off tequila Tuesday made me a true fan for life. Great experience at this establishment.  I can easily give 2 thumbs up and a strong  Recommend 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,41,Living in Austin for my whole life  I tend to forget some staples like ZTejas. I am Celiac and had called ahead. I felt pretty confident with the host s answer regarding dietary protocols.  Leaving the gym  my dude and I decided to stop in for an early Saturday dinner. Our server Michael is hands down the BEST server in the entire Austin area and beyond. We eat out at restaurants 3-4 times a week and are blown away by Michael s level of service. He is very entertaining  a perfect host who ultimately cares about the diner s experience and knows what is tasty. Plus he knows a Celiac conversation and already speaks to it  leaving me with a huge sigh of relief. He recommended the mushroom and spinach enchiladas and while that would have never been on my radar  I took him up on his suggestion. That is how fast I trusted this guy. The enchiladas were so so goooood  And they were light enough and filling. My favorite part is how Michael made a seemingly low key quick dinner into something very special  despite us still being in gym clothes. Michael is a hoot  a real entertainer  and part of an excellent dining experience. I will be back asap 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,42,It was ok.  My brother booked a catered lunch there and the menu was enchiladas  chicken  beef  or mushroom .  The mushroom was the worst tasting and the sauce on all three tasted like it came from a can.  It was just not very flavorable.  The rice and beans were not very tasteful.   Just overall kind of bland.  The drinks were good but not fancy.  They had a lot of bottled beer and that was probably the best thing overall.   My brother should not have been the one to plan the event.  It just was not that good.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,43,So  the staff was nice and the setting  we sat outside  I loved that they had the heaters outside. The only reason I m giving a 2 star is because they charge  5 per strawberry lemonade. They do not advertise that there are no free refills  and would ask if we would like refills.. of course talking and enjoying the conversation you drink a lot so we ordered 6 thinking they were free  NOPE  Got the bill and had  30 worth of strawberry lemonade which is RIDICULOUS because no way in hell would I spend that much on a non-alcoholic beverage. Called the manager and asked if I could be refunded due to not being told that they are not complimentary and he said no  and that he d remind his staff to let people know.. if I wasn t made aware  then I feel I should be reimbursed because that s miscommunication on the facilities part..disappointed with the whole place now. Just include it on the menu to let others know that there are no free refills for strawberry lemonade. For a family on a budget and this being our first night out to enjoy with some friends who came in from out of town.. hate to have paid this much..Went from thinking our family meal would be less than  60 ended up paying close to  100. Won t be back
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,44,Outstanding experience for dinner on a Friday evening. Service was prompt  and server informative and friendly. Food presented in attractive way. Items all tasty especially seasonal Fall Salad. Margaritas great. The interior patio type area is nice. Best part of our visit was simply a responsive  helpful staff group. Each person was courteous  kept a sense of humor. Was great to feel welcome and taken care of from entry to departure.  Parking spots were available at 6 30 but does require the skill to back into an angled space with traffic flowing around you   Worth it. Thanks  Z Tejas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,45,This restaurant is in an adorable location and the inside is very classy. My family and I met here for dinner and enjoyed the chill ambiance and wonderful food. The noise level was average and I didn t have to raise my voice completely to have a conversation with someone across the table.  We started off with the Tejas trio and let me tell you  that quest is to die for. I ordered the Crispy Salmon with a double serving of veggies. I was unsure if my serving ended up being double or the portions were really small because it didn t look like I got two servings of vegetables. I tried my sisters Diablo Pasta and really enjoyed that  as well.   The service was decent at most. Our waiter rarely checked on us and mumbled half of the time. I realize he might ve been having a bad day since it happens to the best of us.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,46,Great food and great atmosphere  Wait staff were amazing and the view was nice  Cool mural out front also.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,47,Good food and great atmosphere. Went for a good friends birthday and had a great time. The owner came by and welcomed us.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,48,TexMex in an ideal location on W 6th. This place has been here quite awhile  and seems like their menu has been fairly consistent throughout the years.  I was recommended the cucumber mule  honestly not the best Moscow mule I ve ever tasted  a little much on the cucumber  just got for the regular Moscow mule even though they say it s strong on the ginger.  Cod fish tacos were great  Perfect amount of crisp and light fish flavor  def try these.  Overall seems like a decent place  nothing super unique but has some decent staples 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,49,While this long-time Austin favorite had been hit and miss for a few years  they seem to have gotten back on track.  The brunch we just had was spot on. Migas were delicious and the French Toast was as good to eat as it was amazing to see. Wish I had snapped a photo.  Am definitely interested to see if the rest of the menu has been revived as well.  Staff was helpful. Great location and atmosphere.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,50,Adequate Tex-Mex. So yeah  this is Austin  which means there are about a bajillion Tex-Mex places around  this being one of them. The thing is  it s pretty much average at that  Arroyo  just down the street  is far   far  better .   The food is  well  TexMex  and won t surprise you in any way.  Mind you  the menu  at first glance  _does_ look interesting  but that kinda fades once you actually get the food. It s all perfectly good  but there is really nothing that makes you want to come back.  Then again  you re not going to be  unhappy  you came either  and  I guess that s a good thing   Anyhow  go to Arroyo...
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,51,We ve been in Austin for several days and I kept hearing about ZTejas on several food sites so we tried it last night. Since it was a Tuesday at 7 00 pm the crowd was not overwhelming. We got seated immediately and the back bar keep  Scotty  was also our waiter. Scotty was very helpful with drink and food recommendations. I had the braised short rib enchiladas and they were really good. My daughter had the chicken enchiladas and she said they were good. My wife had the fried fish tacos. The fish portion was huge in all three tacos and they were delicious. The batter we found out was beer based but it also had a slight sweet taste that along with the slaw topping resulted in the best fish tacos we ve every eaten and we ve eaten a lot of fish tacos. Good service  great food  and prices were reasonable for Austin TX.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,52,My family and I ate at Z Tejas last night.  Food and service was exceptional.   The manager and chef came to the table inquiring on our experience which was a nice touch.  Our server was fantastic.  It s been an  Austin favorite for a long time.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,53,We came to Z-Tejaz last evening and it was nothing short of amazing the food and service. Everything was incredible      Thanks Randy   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,54,The food and drinks here are DELICIOUS  We had the crab stuffed mushrooms  paradise margaritas  and street tacos. Service and taste exceeded our expectations. Thank you   - 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,55,I ve been here three different occasions. The last one was for a bachelorette party of 15. They always have great service and good food. The staff is sweet and very accommodating  I ve liked everything I ve ordered and have zero complaints. I love the salsa  queso  guacamole  and cornbread too 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,56,Worst Tex-mex in Austin. Took an hour just to get appetizers. Worst Paloma I ve ever had. Food was horrible. They messed up my girlfriend s very simple order request. Way over priced for frozen food. Stay very far away.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,57,Welll...we found a hair in our queso. Broke my heart because usually this place is on point. Complimentary valet  strong drinks and yummy food. We live super close so we like coming here. It s about  150 for 4 people so it s a typical downtown Sunday Brunch. We like the laid back vibe and nice servers as well   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,58,Great margaritas. Great food. Sweet setup. And they give military discounts. Would definitely recommend.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,59,I have been going to this location of Z Tejas since 1990  always a favorite.  However  because of  the covid  we have not been by in a while.  Tonight I took my family  in from out of town  thinking it to be a  solid choice.  The second we walked through the door I knew we should have turned around and left  but old habits die hard  so we stuck around.  Stuck that is  as in our feet stuck to the floor  while the smell of what seemed to be urine simultaneously stuck in our nose.  We made it as far as appetizers and lost our appetite.  The food was mediocre at best  and the smell was the proverbial elephant in the room.  Just overwhelming.  Perhaps a sewer line backed up   Also  the more recent  remodel  has stripped away all the lovely charm  color and character this restaurant once had.  Sadly  like many once great Austin eateries  this one too has bit the dust  and hard.  Never goin  back.    
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,60,They have a variety of great Tex-mex and southern dishes to try  not to mention the complimentary jalape o corn bread is to die for. They have a great happy hour with a lot of tequila and margarita options. Only once in the many times we ve been there have they made a mistake  but they quickly and very nicely corrected the problem at no expense.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,61,We ve been coming to Z Tejas for years. Unfortunately  our visit on Sunday will be our last for awhile. First  the prices have increased  like all prices seem to have done  so that was to be expected. Then it got weird. Not in the  Hey  we re in Austin it s supposed to be weird  way  but in a  is a restaurant really run in this way  weird. The server was friendly at the beginning and knowledgeable about the menu. He brought us coffee and cream. But the cream was served in these tiny plastic to-go containers that dripped cream everywhere and were only enough for almost two cups of coffee when four of us were drinking coffee. We asked for more cream and I said   We all take cream in our coffee   and his response was   I ll bring some with the decaf  and he did about 10 minutes later  but it was in another tiny take-out dish. We had to ask for each refill of coffee on the rare instances the server came around. Instead of bringing the pot  he brought each of us a new cup each time and never took the old ones away. We ended up with almost 16 coffee cups on the table. We were hopeful that the table busser would take some of them away  but when he came  he only collected one of three empty mimosa glasses. The food was ok  my husband and I ordered French toast which was served already swimming in syrup with a chocolate strawberry. I could taste the orange in the mix  but overall it was wayyyyy too sweet. A person was singing and playing an amplified guitar. I support live music  but with the amplified guitar  it was unpleasantly loud. I hope that Z Tejas will be able to return to friendly and efficient service and let their patrons add condiments to their own plates and cups in the future.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,62,I love the smoked chicken chili relleno so much that I never want to get anything else. Plenty for 2 people to share. The yuca fries were good. Our server  Christian  was excellent.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,63,Been coming here for 6 years  each visit is better than the last. We always try something new on the menu  and find a new favorite every time. Super friendly and attentive staff. Visit on Tuesday if you re in the mood for a tequila cocktail or on weekends for a great brunch  anytime really. You won t regret it.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,64,I didn t really know what to expect here since I have only been to Z-Tejas when it used to have a location based in Bellevue  Washington and also I am not 100  comfortable with being inside restaurants during a pandemic. So  I was really comforted by how serious they took guest comfort with temp reading at the door  required hand sanitizing before entering and masks if you are moving around the restaurant. My group tried a bunch of things but the highlights are the Woo Woo Margarita which I think has a pomegranate puree in it  the very filling jalape o sausage deviled eggs  Catfish beignets  more like breaded catfish fingers  with really good sauces  Z Burger and the best part the Chorizo Meat loaf  This is what I really wanted to experience with Tex-Mex to have a hybrid Mexican American unique food flavor.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,65,We had a party of 20 coworkers over at our condo building this weekend and had Z tejas cater the food and drink.  Very easy to work with. On time delivery. Well organized.  Provided place settings and serving spoons and really great margaritas by the gallon.  But the food..... I had so many compliments on the taste of the entrees.  We ordered the steak and chicken fajitas and spinach mushroom enchiladas vaporized quickly once word for our how good they were. The queso dip was seriously the best I have had here in Austin.  I will use them again in a hot second.  Enjoy 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,66,I agree with the last poster.  My family liked the food ok but I thought the entrees were extremely bland.  Not just mild but no spices or salt at all. The Diablo pasta tasted like Olive Garden fettuccine Alfredo unless you ate a jalape o slice.    Fish tacos were ok but not good for the price.  So strange especially for an Austin restaurant. Dessert was good  corn bread good  service good.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,67,Ate here last night. Smells like sewage. Really bothered me how run down the place has become. Made me sad this used to be awesome. The Tostada bites are not on happy hour anymore and the bartender was very strange. It felt like he was listening to our private chat.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,68,Cold uninspired food  smells like sewage. Service while well intentioned was bad. Only come here if you have a thing for being easily parted with your money.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,69,One of the best burgers i ve had here in ATX. Queso was incredible too. Highly recommend 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,70,A-ok. Actually I came in with relatively low expectations and it was better than expected    HH goes til 7. Got a rum  coconut and pineapple cocktail that was deeelicious  though on the pricey side   8.50 on HH  given how small it was   Appetizers  half off during HH   - Tejas trio  salsa  queso  guac -- guac was the best of the three  queso solid  salsa meh  - grilled shrimp tostada bites  best of the appetizers we tried. Flavorful  comes with 8 - Barbacoa nachos - these weren t nachos. Actually more like lackluster mini tostada s - hard skip.  - Catfish beignets. these are actually tasty but WHY are they called  beignets    It s fried catfish. Nothing beignet about them     Entrees  I got the chicken Chile relleno. This is a grilled  not fried  relleno with no breading. And instead of ground beef inside  the pepper is essentially wrapped around a very generous amount of chicken. Chicken was ok  a tad on the dry side so it had to be cut up and swooshed in the sauce. Not much flavor from the chili pepper  and overall  no heat at all in the dish.   Other people in my group got various other dishes I didnt try. Made a mental note that the Ruby trout salad looked WAY better than the Ruby trout entree. Chicken avocado sandwich looked really dry.   Parking was no problem - there s parking in front  to the side AND at the back. I parked on the side to avoid having to deal with backing into the spaces at the front on 6th St.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,71,I remembered Z Tejas fondly from when I lived in Austin 10 years ago  particularly because of the corn bread. Visiting Austin for the weekend  I was curious to check it out.   My husband and I grabbed lunch here on Sunday. We opted to sit outside and although there were fans we were still a bit miserable from the heat. Their patio has fans but our table didn t feel much from them. Our server was fairly young and didn t bother writing our lunch order down when we gave it to him with our appetizer order. We thought he was just committing it to memory so we were very surprised when he came out with the appetizer and asked us for our order. He even told us that he hadn t bothered to write the order down before and that he hoped it wouldn t be a problem for us. Lol  The food was fine. Queso appetizer was good but we didn t love the  z  written in it with smoked chipotle sauce. Barbacoa omelette from their brunch menu had good barbacoa and eggs but the papas bravas were mushy. Bloody Mary was fine. My husband s steak and chicken fajitas stole the show. The steak  in particular  was delicious. The pinto beans  however  were mediocre.   Food was okay  service was fine. Heat was bad.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,72,There was only one other occupied table besides us inside the the area we were in. To be blunt the service was bad  the food lukewarm  when we got it   amp  the room freezing. We even asked about turning off or down the air  amp  got no response 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,73,SOOOO GOOD  The Tejas trio with queso  guac and salsa is so good  You get so much food and all three are superb  The margaritas are strong and delicious  And food is so great  Be sure to say hello to Kiki the porch cat 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,74,Tasty off the grid entrees and you can always count on the quality of the food. Texmex smashed into Texas food at Z Tejas and the creations are out of this world. DON T BE IN A HURRY when you come here  take your time and enjoy the ambiance and a great glass  or two  of wine. Bring your out of town friends and family for a meal they will remember and want to repeat in the future.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,75,Just ate here for the first time for a dear friends birthday with a small group and had a lovely time. Delicious food and drinks  complimentary birthday dessert  and AMAZING service from our waiter Chris. He was so kind and funny  Will return. Huzzah 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,76,Well to say the least  this was my first day in Austin and this place is about a 15 minute walk from Graffiti Park  Hope s Gallery .  I stumbled upon this gem while I was walking and roaming the streets on a Friday afternoon.  Thinking Texas was close to Mexico  I thought the burrito game was on point.  But apparently a burrito in Texas is WAY different than California.  Instead of something wrapped up that you could eat with your hands  it kinda looks like they just stick cheese and meat on a tortilla and just fold it a couple times  So that was kind of interesting.  It wasn t as tasty as I thought it would be  it was more cheese than anything else.  I loved the way this place looked and the people there were fantastic.  I met a man there that was a HS bball coach and we got into a long convo about the NBA and he was telling me about his experiences as a coach. It was nice.  Then he bought me a beer  It was incredible. People in CA don t do that. So thank you again  if you are reading this 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,77,Corn bread is meh and margs were too sweet. Sad atmosphere but could be fun if more people were there and good music.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,78,Wow...just had the most amazing dish  possibly ever .  It was a  special  and not yet permanently on their menu but according to our lovely server  Blue  it will be soon.   It was a Lemongrass Glazed grilled Pork Tenderloin served with pork chorizo  mashed potatoes  sweet yellow peppers  all saut ed in habanero butter and drizzled with their amazing sweet lemongrass glaze.  It was a perfect union of sweet and spicy and I would give it 6 STAR S if I could    Their extensive margarita menu was incredible and authentic  using only fresh lime juice  an amazing selection of tequilas and orange liqueur s.  I highly recommend the  Caddie Margarita  . We are only visiting Austin but I simply cannot return to Tucson until I have this dish at least once more  so I ll be bringing some family with me in a few days to savor it yet again.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,79,I ve been here multiple times  mainly for appetizers and drinks during happy hour or for lunch. Overall  the food is good  but it s expensive.   I came here for lunch today  and while the food was quite tasty  the price point was a little high for the value of the food. I ll start by saying that we were greeted properly and that the host was incredibly friendly. We were seated right away inside. The space is a little casual for how expensive food is. The ambience just isn t able to justify a  16 lunch plate  which becomes  20 after tax and tip  even with tap water. Our server was knowledgeable and charming.   I just wasn t pleased with the quality of the chili relleno. My spiced chicken relleno  while spiced well  had two thick pieces of gristle in it  and also came with charred paper attached to the end of the chili pepper. My two friends both got enchiladas  and they were happy enough.  I d recommend this place whenever someone else is buying  and maybe skip the chicken relleno.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,80,SPECIAL EVENT  Booked the bright and sunny Terrace Room  Z  Tejas own photo attached  for a plated brunch with three tables of 8. First off  the positive. Our server was accommodating and polite. The cocktails and beverages were reasonably priced  the variety of brunch offerings was nice  the food good. At the time of the booking  I wrote the event coordinator that I realized the space was larger than I needed  but I liked that it would give us room to stand and socialize for drinks. I paid what I thought a premium because I wanted a private space due to COVID concerns. At no time was I told in advance that the room would not accommodate more. The number grew at the last-minute  my fault  so I requested an extra table. When I arrived they had moved us to an  upgraded  space where  we would be more comfortable.  It was not as cheerful  windows by tables opening to view of asphalt driveway  but I didn t complain because I sensed set-up already was running a bit behind. I did not complain in front of my guests during the event  but contacted the event coordinator who had not been present the next week. That s when the excuses began mounting up. Suddenly  I was informed we had to be moved because the room would not accommodate more than 25 seated guests at once  an unusual number and one that does not seem to match up to the advertised photo. Then I was told they moved us because of the party on the balcony. No one had ever mentioned when I booked our  private  space that the group on the balcony would be entering  going to the bathroom and leaving through the space I had reserved. Also that food and beverage service for the group would pass through as well. All of this is to say  the brunch itself was fine  but ask lots of questions before booking a space there. The pictures really don t explain the facility. The Terrace Room must be a whole lot smaller than it appears  and make sure your  private  room really is.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,81,We called to reserve a table for a large party of 14 people to celebrate our mother s birthday. When we arrived  our reservation was not found. Luckily  the staff organized a table for our group in the back and we were seated within a few minutes. After we were seated  a large group of young men celebrating arrived and sat at a table across from us. The room was occupied by these two tables only. It quickly became unbearably loud for us to speak. The staff even noted the noise level. We asked to be moved  but we were told there were no other tables available. Our waiter was wonderful and apologetic. He even sent the management to quiet them down. We tried to rush out  as we literally could not hear each other. When we received the check  we asked the manager to consider a discount due to the ruined dinner. We told him that we would compensate the waiter fairly. And we did. The manager said he could not offer any discounts  he did not apologize and said  you should have asked for a private room . A family dinner does not necessarily require a private room. We eat at restaurants as a family often  and have never had this issue before.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,82,Unless you are there for Trivia night don t go on Wednesday night. Don t go with kids. Visiting Austin after very long drive. Almost a 2 1 2 hour dinner with three kids because the staff was distracted by trivia night drinkers. Felt like I was escaping at 10pm when we finally Got out   Rushed by the distracted server only to wait forever. Waited too long for water for children  drinks and silverware. Asked about specials and told there were none only to see specials on the hard to read phone scan menu  just use disposable paper menus    . Salmon  when it finally showed up  was good but mashed potato cold and asparagus overcooked. House margarita tepid. Z Tejas Margarita very good. At end presented with distracting card reader for the Bill with tip already selected  Food good  atmosphere and patio excellent but hospitality and process need improvement.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,83,This was a wonderful Tex-Mex restaurant. I want to preface by saying that I m a very good cook and so my standards are quite high. Z Tejas did NOT disappoint  Our server Michael was very pleasant and the specials and dishes he suggested were EXCELLENT. We will definitely be back to try some of the other items in the menu.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,84,Places in Austin can always be so busy  however I visited on a Saturday morning when the opened at 10 and there was plenty of seating. I like this pace because it s a bit off the beaten path but has great indoor and outdoor seating with beautiful trees around. Our waiter was very attentive and was easy to talk to. He gave us his favorite dishes and I chose one of them. My omelet was delicious a lot better than the 300 dollar hotel I stayed in served me. Next time I m in Austin I will visit  great desserts and drink offers  something about drinks before noon remind you that your an adult now and do what you want   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,85,Although I have visited Austin many times  tonight was my first visit visit to Z Texas on 6th Avenue. First  I liked their complimentary valet service. Although it is a very popular place  it was not noisy. I loved the smoked chicken enchiladas. They came with chipotle sauce and Chile sauce. Black beans and rice also accompanied this very tasty and ample dish. The food and ambience were great. I highly recommended ZTejas 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,86,Came here for dinner after my sister spent a few hours looking for restaurants with 1  vegetarian options for me  2  gluten free options for her  and 3  outdoor seating for our dog. They totally delivered  We sat on the deck streetside and someone brought out a bowl of ice water for our dog before we even had water for ourselves. THATS AWESOME. We started with the cornbread and honey butter  which was in fact awesome. I had the vegetarian chopped salad  and it was divine. It arrived in a sort of deconstructed manner  which was nice because I ended up scooping out a lot of red cabbage. It had iceberg  pumpkin seeds  black beans  corn  and a few other additions  and a really delicious ranch vinaigrette on the side. Oh  Bonus  it was listed as a chicken salad for  14  and then underneath it said  vegetarian  10  so you don t have to order something and say no meat but still pay the same price  Food was amazing  and our server was personable  informed  and prompt. 10 10 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,87,Ironically  they re serving TexMEX food but won t serve you if you re Hispanic. On a pretty slow Tuesday night we got seated and waited for 15 minutes as every table got served  greeted and checked on but us. Literally not even eye contact to acknowledge we were seated and waiting or anything  Pretty disappointed - not to mention the  manager  was walking around checking on tables. Again  everyone but us. We ended up leaving despiste is being as patient as we could have been.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,88,Loved this place-- such a great ambience  wonderful service  and awesome food. We tried the cornbread  diablo pasta  and the calabacitas con elote  comes with beans and Spanish rice   and loved all of it. Portion size is good too  with easily enough for a take-home meal as well. Would definitely come back here 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,89,I used to be a regular at the happy hour but after moving to the eastside of the city  I have stopped going. That  and a really bad meal one night at the bar  just after the restaurant had changed up the staff.   With guests from out of town  we chose ZTejas for a dinner.  It has a broad variety with that tex-mex twist. The Palomas were weak. It didn t really taste like anything. Even after returning the one with salt. The waiter tried to rush us  and in a room with a brides  party. Yes  they are happy and really loud in a room with all hard surfaces.   My meal was meh. The grouper was small under the crust and the crabmeat on top was cold. It was fine. But not good. And the staff needs better training  and they need to at least act like they care about customers. Our waiter acted like we were a problem. Never smiled. And I can t say that I will  ever go back.   Which is sad because it was so good once.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,90,I love that the cornbread actually has corn in it. The butter has a sweet aftertaste and it s so light. It s great. Get the cornbread  you won t regret it.  Pretty much everyone at our table got the diablo pasta and although it is one of their signature dishes  I felt like it was a little underwhelming. Maybe it was the thickness of the linguine or the sauce not being as flavorful as I was expecting. I can t really pinpoint what it was. It was still good  though. The chicken really saved the dish imo.  If you re looking for a really good appetizer  get the grilled shrimp  amp  guac tostada bites. The plate comes w 8 bites and the bites are a good size. The appetizer was big enough to share w another person  at least  for me anyway. If I eat too much of an appetizer  I won t eat my entr e. The flavor of each ingredient in the bite works well with each other. Not a surprise that it s a signature dish.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,91,Love their food and drinks  I always get the stuffed poblanos and sangria margarita   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,92,The most amazing place for brunch. We had a large  rowdy group of 17  and our server Michael made sure that we were taken care of and never had an empty Bloody Mary margarita. The brunch menu is delicious  and they are great with accepting substitutions. They have a great outdoor atrium with tables for when the weather allows. A must-go in Austin.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,93,I love this place  it has great ambiance  amazing food  and impeccable service. The best thing on the menu is the smoked chicken stuffed poblano  it has a blend of savory cheese and chile mixed with sweet golden raisins  apricot  and pecans. It sounds weird but when you try it you will be delighted with a harmony of flavors. The mushroom enchilada are the best we have had and a great veggie option as well.  We love to sit outside on the patio and have brunch or dinner.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,94,Came here earlier this month  8 12 2018  for happy hour and because the Tastebud app was offering 50  off. The margaritas are mediocre  nothing special  but with 50  off happy hour prices  it s hard to beat. The server was also the bartender at the time and not pleasant whatsoever.   I went again today  8 24 18  with coworkers because Tastebud was offering 40  off. Clearly  I like a discount. The lunch menu is healthy so that s a huge plus. They also give a yummy corn bread in a small skillet for free to every table. I ordered a turkey burger because it was suggested by the waiter. VERY mediocre. My coworker ordered a  15 chicken enchilada plate and it was filled with bones. Ew. Then the waiter accidentally charged all of us incorrectly  which messed up our Tastebud discounts and caused a lot of confusion. The manager was very helpful with this issue.   Overall  mediocre food. I would only go back if I had a 50  off from the tastebud app.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,95,I just want to start off by saying that Claire was amazing  Her service was great. She took care of us even after we paid out. Super friendly and attentive  I love the ambiance  especially on the  breeze way . The margs were a hit  After two I was . The food was also great. I would like to add that the guacamole could have used a little more salt. But other than that  I was very pleased with my experience. Way to go Claire  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,96,Service  5 stars. Food  4ish stars.   We tried to make it to Chuy s this Saturday but the traffic going towards the Barton Springs location was horrible. So... I convinced my family to come here. My head was on the chopping block and subject to my Asian parents   dis approval. Z  Tejas better serve  after 40 minutes of driving around and mounting hangry levels inside the van.   We drove around the block 3 times and finally made it into the complimentary valet parking entrance. Valet   hi  How are you   Dad   fwee    Is this fwee   Then the valet had to explain how valet parking works.  Facepalm  wow  we re off to a great start.  idontknowhim  Luckily waiter Benny tried his best to make our nights better with his jokes and bantering. I had to take it up for my table because my family was too hangry to speak at this point. I won t go into details  but he did an amazing job despite being slammed with the volume of UT fans pouring in at this point.   Food was good. The serving sizes were large for Europe  average for most of America  and hence smallish for Texas. The chopped chicken salad was amazing even though they didn t add the bacon as listed on the menu. The enchiladas  amp  burritos were good from what I could swipe.   The highlight was the cornbread   So amazing. I am a baked good snob and I usually hate cornbread  but this was perfection  moist  flavorful  with bits of corn inside.   I might be back... If the Z Tejas valet will still take us.   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,97,Z Tejas was my favorite place to go to when I lived in Tempe  and I have been so bummed living without it for the past 10 years in Chicago. When my friend and I planned a trip to Austin this weekend  I was absolutely delighted to find out that Z Tejas was right around the corner from our AirBnB    Dalton was our server  and he was so incredibly nice and attentive and SUPER KNOWLEDGEABLE about the menu. Everything we ordered was everything I dreamt it would be and so much more.   Thank you  Dalton  for a truly great experience - we hope to be back next time we re in Austin and will ask for you 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,98,For father s day  we were having trouble on where to sit down to eat  but i m so glad we found Z-tejas. the servers were super nice  and have such a nice sense of humor  and knew how to make us laugh. The food was excellent and nothing short of delicious  I highly recommend for group outings 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,99,I would probably give this place 3.5 stars overall. We ve only ever been here for brunch  which was good  so we thought we d give dinner a try. Granted we went in at 8 on a Sunday  but it was very quiet. I could hear myself think. A little louder music at those times might help the atmosphere. The waiter and service was great. My husband got the fajitas and he rated them a 3.5. Everything was pretty good except their beans tasted really off. I d give the five cheese Mac n chicken a 3. Do not order it if you don t like bleu cheese. A little pricey considering the food isn t anything that really stands out. The highlight of the meal was definitely their cornbread. You get one skillet for free and it was delicious. My husband doesn t even like cornbread  but he liked this one 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,100,Not only is z tejas located in a cute quaint location  surprising because it s just around the corner from the bustling whole foods area   but this southwestern spot is great for good food with good company. Ambience is so lively with the bright colored decor and large windows everywhere to let in that beautiful Texas sun.   Cornbread is complimentary and unlimited  Yummm it s freshly baked every 30 min- super moist and delicious. I also got the z  chicken salad for lunch- a lighter fare for those who had just eaten an hour beforehand...oops. But even with food already in my tummy  I was able to finish this plate because it was that good. The other dishes looked great and plentiful  and I was able to try some tasty ones too. Worth trying were the seafood enchiladas  that salmon...so good  and breakfast relleno  everyone s favorite at the table .  Would love to be back  Great brunch and happy hour specials 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,101,I was so bummed when the Z Tejas at The Gateway in SLC shuttered its doors because I LOVED their food. I was jumping for joy when rolling through Austin and a Z Tejas appeared like a manna from heaven  okay  I might be exaggerating. Austin is one of the best food cities in the U.S.  so I woulda  been fine without it .    Everything is good  from their drinks to their cornbread to their queso  I recommend the starter Trio  guacamole  chile con queso  and salsa picante  to their entrees  I can t seem to stop getting their blackened catfish tacos .  Yums all around    I m taking two stars away not for the 6th Street store but for the fact the company left Utah without a Z Tejas. I would be happy to return the stars when you return to the Beehive State. This town has plenty of successful restaurants ... shame on you Steven Micheletti 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,102,I m really conflicted to how I feel about Z Tejas. I came in on a Thursday night at 7pm for a work dinner on the recommendation of the person we were meeting. We were seated outside as we requested and then were ignored for the next 45 minutes. Literally  no one stopped by to offer us water or ask us if we wanted drinks.   I finally had to pretend to make a trip to the restroom to hunt down someone to ask where our waiter was. I have to compliment the busboys behind the bar who were very helpful to us the entire time while we were trying to find our waiter.   The food was great  once we got to make an order. My drink was SUPER strong and I m usually not a lightweight  but this one was hitting me. I had the mushroom enchiladas  which were really tasty. The table side guacamole was also really good and definitely hit the spot.   I m not sure if our service snafu was a one-time situation or not  but it really put a damper to the night. I don t think I can recommend Z Tejas despite the good food.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,103,The food tasted fresh and the outside sitting area was nice. The server was also kind and helpful. I m only ranking 4 star because nothing special stood out to me. I also ordered the Mac amp Cheese. It was yummy but on the spicy sode
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,104,My husband  MIL  and I went here for lunch today.  First  and this is our fault  we didn t realize there was a Longhorns game today so the place was ridiculously packed. However  we did make a reservation for 1 30pm. We didn t get seated until after 2pm which was a bit frustrating.    We ordered the nachos but asked for chicken instead of pork or barbacoa  I don t eat beef or pork   and they told us it would cost extra. Personally  I m thinking to myself  barbacoa and pulled pork are definitely more pricey than chicken but okay  whatever.  The nachos were tasty  but not worth  16 for 5 nachos to share between 3 people... Plus  I ordered the chicken fried chicken entree which cost less than the nachos    What sense does that make  truly     So frankly  the food was okay. It was nothing to write home about though. Both my MIL and husband got the chicken fried ribeye and were disappointed  said it was dry and grizzly.  Definitely not worth the money.  Basically  you re paying to eat at an extremely yuppie establishment on 6th street. That s pretty much it.  So after waiting 30 minutes for a table  and overpaying for nachos  and having sub par food  this place doesn t deserve higher than a 2 rating.  Sorry y all.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,105,These folks have made a good thing better  They ve been around Austin for a long time and I ve seen their ups and downs but they are on the UP now. They just invested a ton of time and effort into revamping their 6th street location. New entrance  new paint  updated signage  sleek remodeled bar  and wonderfully new  clean  and useful restrooms. But  the best overhaul of all is their service and food. They still have a lot of favorites but they ve updated their menu with new and exciting Spanish and Mexican inspired food. They are a great value and  at lunch  they put many fast food restaurants to shame with their super-fast lunch service. I spent 20 min in there and got to enjoy my food for most of that 20 minutes because they got the food to me FAST. Really FAST   They are worth trying or going back to if you have stayed away recently. Great job Z-Tejas. I ll be back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,106,Flew in from Nashville and needed a place to store my bags until I could check into my AirBnB. Stumbled upon this spot through BagBnB and stayed for lunch. Five stars for food and service at this hidden gem  Brian  manager  and Scott  bartender  we re so warm and friendly  they really made my solo lunch special and gave me great tips of where to visit during my stay. The brunch scrambled egg relleno was fantastic - they do TexMex so well 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,107,The food and service was good. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed. They have seating for large parties and small tables for 2 next to the bar. They do have happy hour menu with food and drinks. The location is a little out of the way. They do have valet parking on site.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,108,Wanted to grab Tex Mex for brunch during our stay in Austin and we chose Z Tejas based on the photos and the reviews. I wasn t feeling well and didn t have much of an appetite so I just had a bowl of simple tortilla soup. My friend ordered one of the brunch skillets and it came with a basket of the mini muffins.  I ate all of the mini muffins and they were great. The tortilla soup had a good amount of avocado  other than that  it was very average. I was genuinely surprised by how tiny her skillet was. This is Texas and I was excepting something bigger than a 6  diameter cast iron skillet.   It was a quiet Sunday at the restaurant and it just didn t feel very brunchy.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,109,My husband and I love this southwestern restaurant  They bring cornbread to your table instead of chips and salsa but you can still order chips and salsa. We ve tried several things on their menu and they ve all been great 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,110,Excellent food and customer service. Everything we ordered was amazing  We ordered the catfish beignets as an app and there was free skillet cornbread  both delicious  We got the 6th Street Frozen and Hard Day cocktails. After one drink my head was spinning  The bartender was excellent    We then ordered steak  amp  chicken fajitas and Barbacoa enchiladas for dinner. Tres leches and apple peach cobbler for dessert  Stuffed to capacity 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,111,I hate to leave a bad review for such great food restaurant. But I was really disappointed with the treatment at the bar tonight . All I did was place an order to go and pick it up... really rude employee BUT great food 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,112,I tried Z Tejas for dinner  it was an okay experience. The food was alright  I ordered something small since I ate a big lunch. I tried the cornbread for a cause and the tortilla soup. The cornbread was much hyped in the pictures  it was good but not the best. It actually has little pieces of corn in the actual bread  which I like. The tortilla soup hit the spot  not to salty overall would recommend if you d want something easy to eat.   What I really liked about this place was the actual restaurant  The inside was so big with lots of windows and seating areas  My friend says it would be a cute date place. I liked the color and multilevel seating areas  they also had outdoor seating .   Would come again for the company  but the food didn t blow me away.  Wanted to give 3.5 stars  but I won t be rounding up 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,113,It was happy hour  so came here for a few drinks. Ordered the jalapeno cucumber margarita and the exotico martini. Both were really good. We sat at the bar  and the bartender seemed a little moody. Heard him complaining to the other bartender about work stuff. I ve heard from other people that the food is pretty good  so maybe next time I ll try some dinner.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,114,Heard this place was great for brunch. Heard awesome things about their corn bread...and it came out like cold. Def did not feel like it was fresh  almost stale  And I had to pay for this   - Side note  they brought some complimentary muffins and one of them tasted like fruit loops  those were good and free    The food here was OK  again  it came out like room temp  so I m not sure what was going on. We didn t even have a large party. Sounds like they may need extra hands in the kitchen  I m not sure i would try this place again to be honest  but it s def a popular spot.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,115,Love this place   One of our go to places in Austin   The food is always fresh and tasty and the drinks and workers are great   We always get the cornbread and we are never disappointed  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,116,We went to Z tejas downtown and it was such a different setting than the one at the Arboretum but with the same great dishes. They have outside seating  signature cocktails  and amazing Tex-Mex.  We were able to be seated fairly quickly despite having a lot of friends in our party.  The service was superb and the house was clean.  All I want is more of their cornbread   Great for happy hour  apps  and dates with the wife.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,117,Gorgeous building  amp  delicious food  Great service from our boy Raj. He gave great recommendations and was attentive and friendly. Lots of patio space that looked shaded and pretty. We will definitely be back when the weather gets nice 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,118,A small get-together brought a party of 9 to Z Tejas  a first time for us all.  With a reservation made  we were easily accommodated.  The service was excellent and no mistakes were made.  Sometimes  you gotta appreciate the little things.  Our table shared two appetizers  the Tejas Trio and the Cornbread.  I also ordered the Diablo Pasta with Chicken with a Patron Fruzion.  The Tejas Trio came with guacamole  chile con queso  and salsa.  Didn t have much of the salsa  but the chile con queso and the guacamole both were delicious.  The guac could ve been better with the chopped onions though.  Many reviews raved about the cornbread.  Although they were pretty good  they weren t mindblowing.  Nevertheless  the table really enjoyed them.  Another heavily raved dish was the Diablo Pasta.  The sauce was good  but wasn t enough for the amount of noodles.  Essentially it was eating a plate full of noodles with maybe a hint of taste from the sauce.  Not a fan.  The Patron Fruzion was pretty tasty  but I wish it was more  frozen .  Like Trudy s margaritas  frozen .  Overall  we all had a fun time there  and the waiters definitely made everything run smoothly.  The food was a bit disappointing  but definitely more on the menu that caught my eye.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,119,Another incredible visit. Especially after Austin marathon. An Austin jewel. Dog friendly patio 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,120,Every time my boyfriend and I are in Texas  we always make a point to get Tex-Mex. I found Z Tejas via Yelp  but I regret not asking the locals what is a  good  Tex-Mex restaurant.   First  I ll start with the good. This franchise location had a nice patio deck area where my boyfriend and I had our brunch. We went on a Saturday morning of Memorial Day Weekend  which was surprisingly not busy. Also I was feeling the DJ who was playing a really good mix out on the deck as well. I started my brunch off with some delicious cocktails  I had the cucumber jalapeno margarita and prickly pear margarita. The cucumber jalapeno margarita was very light and refreshing--perfect for the hot and humid weather. I love eating prickly pears  so I instantly loved the flavor and sweetness of the prickly pear margarita. Our waiter was the bomb  I wish I could remember his name. He was a young  nice guy  and he was super personable and highly attentive. Since my boyfriend and I weren t around here  he took the time to give us a list of some trendy  obscure bars that only the locals would really know about.   The not so great about Z Tejas was the food unfortunately. I found the food being far from Tex-Mex. My meal  in particular  lacked the Southwestern Tex-Mex flavors I was hoping for. I ordered the breakfast relleno  and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and steak fajitas. The breakfast relleno is just an Anaheim pepper stuffed with an omelette. It did come with a green and orange sauce  but I found both sauces bland. My boyfriend s fajitas were pretty basic and no better than fajitas from Chevy s.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,121,This is a great place to get some decent TexMex food over drinks with friends. It is a little pricey but the food is quite great  there is a large menu of options to choose from   and the drinks are good.  Their hatch chili menu is great  I highly recommend the hatch chili burger  this is one of my new favorite burgers in Austin. It was super juicy and flavorful  and the chilis added a sweet kick to each bite that I love.  I m not huge on queso but the queso here is killer as well. I also really enjoy the drinks here  especially their mules. I would come back just for the mules but I hear they are known for their margaritas 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,122,I would have loved to give this place 4 or 5 stars but the service was bad. Granted  it was a Saturday night but reading through the other reviews proves I m not the only one who feels this way.  I love this location and have passed by several times wanting to try it. The location is great and the place is really cool...up some stairs with indoor and outdoor patio seating.  I don t want to dwell about the bad service but basically here s the run-down  we were never offered chips  amp  salsa  like the tables around us   I had to track someone down for water refills  they were in a rush while taking our order and the food took about an hour to get to our table  and I had a salad .  The salad was excellent and I can tell that people come here because of the quality of the food. I had the Red Chile and Steak Mango Salad  mixed greens  bleu cheese  spicy walnuts  Roma tomatoes  mango citrus dressing  which I absolutely loved. I love that you can choose to make any entree vegetarian.  Too bad I won t be coming back due to the service.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,123,Had a pretty good time at Z Tejas  Went with 2 toddlers and a few adults and were sat in a nice spacious area in the back. I gotta say I couldn t get a good take on the food. I ordered the queso and chips which were great. For some reason myself and my friend did not feel like ordering standard Mexican fare for dinner. I ordered the chicken fried steak and my friend ordered the tuna tartare app. Can t say I d recommend either. The tuna had a grayish color and tasted alright. The chicken fried steak was pretty much inedible. Fried just right but the chewiest piece of steak id ever had. Not even sure why this is on the menu. I had asked the waiter before hand if it was good and he said it was amazing. To each their own I suppose... My wife had the salad which she said was decent.   The happy hour was also good. I ll be back but next time will stick to the fajitas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,124,In light of being New years Eve  l will make this pretty short. Went here earlier in the evening and food was pretty good. It was busy so it took a while for food to come out.   The only negative was that they brought out just a burger patty when I ordered a normal hickory burger without the bacon. When I told them I ordered the burger  they asked if I just wanted the bun  Dumbfounded  i started to question myself do I even know what a burger was anymore   Anyhow  when the the burger finally did come out  it was pretty tasty.  Lastly  the men s bathroom was the issue. The toilet and urinal were in the same room which did not lock  so anyone could ve walked in on you doing your business. Luckily  no one came while I was in there  but because of this crucial mishap  giving this place 2 stars.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,125,This adorable little restaurant was pretty good. The service was great but there were two things off for me-the water cups were tiny-two sips and it s gone  It s like they re trying to get you to buy a bigger drink...guess I could of asked for a bigger cup. The other thing was the seafood enchiladas-SUPER fishy tasting  No thank you   All I could taste was the water those fish were in-ruined the entire plate for me. Will probably come back because the restaurant is so cute and will try something other than the seafood.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,126,Got a to-go order and it sucked. Not the first time but we decided to give it another shot. We ordered a total of 5 items. 2 side orders were right  2 entree s were completely wrong and the appetizer didn t even show up. No bueno. There are much better Mexican restaurants than this in Austin. Don t waste your time here.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,127,Have to ding a star for slow slow forgetful service. Our waiter was very nice personality wise. He immediately made amends for none delivery of my cup of soup. It got upgraded to a bowl. The chicken tortilla soup  salad  catfish strips were all excellent in temperature and flavor. The atmosphere was a little cold and drafty because of the cold and drizzly weather outside. There are not any warm sections at this location. Most  patrons like to eat outside  so outside seating is what they boast.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,128,Great place for some tex mex  I m a big fan of their apps.  Queso -  The grilled shrimp tostada bites - cilantro pesto shrimp  house-made tostada rounds  guacamole  chipotle  spicy cucumber salad Street Tacos - beef sirloin  cucumbers  avocado  Cotija cheese  chipotle cream sauce  salsa verde  corn tortillas  The entrees weren t as impressive. I was so full I couldn t order an entree  but I got a bowl of tortilla soup and shared half a salad. The tortilla soup was almost inedible  and the salad was - a salad.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,129,A hefty group os exhausted ladies  e.g. us   popped in here around 2pm on a Saturday for a late lunch after a long walking tour of some local graffiti spots in Austin. We were able to be seated immediately  and were met with waters all the way around  which was great  we needed hydration . A few girls ordered drinks  and the consensus all around was that they were tasty and refreshing. One girl wanted the cucumber drink but they were out of the cucumber vodka and subbed in grapefruit but it wasnt as tasty as she was hoping.  For lunch  we started with queso  which we demolished within minutes. The chips were light and thin  just how I like them . We ordered a variety of entrees  mushroom enchiladas  burritos  breakfast enchiladas  salads - everyone seemed to enjoy their food  because it was all completely eaten . The portions are huge  lots of beans and rice  and the salsas all had a nice kick that we tried.  The service was attentive without being smothering. Drawback was that we were stuck next to a loud college party of 20  people... which made it really difficult to hear our own conversations  or hear ourselves think . Ambiance was fun and easy-going  and the bathrooms were clean.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,130,Review update    Z tejas is pretty cool. I ve become a greater fan over the years. However  I was disappointed with their catering menu- there isn t really much  Tex-Mex  about it    Anyway  the last time I came here I ordered the seafood enchilada and I was really impressed with them. It packed a ton of flavor and multiple different friends of the sea. There was also the shrimp tacos which were filled with goodness and quite delicious.   The cornbread is no longer free but if you buy it the proceeds go towards a local charity  win .   Still Westlake-y but I ll just have to get over that.   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,131,They are now under new management and they ve changed For. The. Better.   The service is excellent     They also changed their menu and the food and margs are SOOOO GOOD and it all comes out hot.   Lastly  and also my favorite thing they ve changed  is you can now bring dogs to their front patio AND it s now covered     This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant to go to and I live within walking distance.  But  they also have parking out back  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,132,Great place to come for happy hour after work. It has a nice patio and they changed the menu. Was fast on service and the food was fresh and tasty. Will definitely come back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,133,Z Tejas is by far my favorite Tex mex restaurant in the Austin area and I m always satisfied when I visit. Today definitely marked another great experience  My boyfriend and I came in for a Sunday brunch around 1 45  we made a reservation but we probably would ve been fine without it.   I ordered the breakfast quesadillas and they were delicious. I especially liked the perfect amount of firmness in the tortilla. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo pork scramble skillet and it was very tasty too. Both were generous portions and we were able to take leftovers to enjoy for breakfast tomorrow   Service was attentive and the food came out super quickly  less then 12 mins   which was great because we were in a hurry  As far as parking  it can be tricky at peak hours but they have a small lot on the left side of the restaurant and back-in parking along 6th street. If you re coming later in the day  I think it s usually after 3 pm   complimentary valet is offered. Overall I had a great experience and always look forward to coming back 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,134,Stay away from this place until it is under new management.  It used to be wonderful.  Now it is the epitamy of how not to run a restaurant in Texas.  My reservations were acknowledged and ignored the waitstaff was non-existent and complained about their working conditions  the food was not correct and we were forced to leave a 20  tip because of COVID-19.  HASTA LA VISTA Z-Tejas.  It is truly a shame.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,135,Great environment  loved the background music  but the food was not good and our waiter was not attentive. He came back to refill water once  forgot multiple times to bring us straws  and he took forever to bring the check. We sat outside and had to ask several different workers to turn on the heat lamp. Cornbread is bomb 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,136,I m going to be honest  I do not do yelp reviews at all and quite frankly if I didn t do one for Z Tejas I would be doing a disgrace amongst humanity. These catfish mango tacos saved my life. I was in a dark depression but after having 3 of the most delicious tacos in the world I came to a realization that my life was worth it. This is now my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin and I will be coming here forever. God bless and enjoy your tacos
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,137,Adults want to feel young again  Then eat at this location and request to sit in the treehouse. So quaint and cozy. I love their menu  All of the dietary needs are posted right on each item  and the server will assist with any additional requests. I ordered the ruby red fish. I was worried it would be dry. Nope  It was just plain yum. The price is extremely reasonable and there was plenty to fill me up. My friend had a steak salad and he couldn t finish all of it. It was a wonderful experience after a two hour canoe trip on Lake Austin.  Thank you Z Tejas 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,138,Yummy margs  great happy hour  super friendly staff. Great experience. Will be back.  Had the trio appetizer  salsa was great. General manager was very attentive and happy to help with anything we needed.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,139,Mason and Scott took great care of our party of 6 tonight. We think Mason especially is amazing at hospitality and remembered us by name from another restaurant. We re pretty sure he ll be running the place soon. Great service and  as always  the food was great. We ll be back 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,140,Very disappointed with my last trip to Z Tejas. I ve enjoyed the food in past visits but this most recent one was extremely sub-par. I came with a group of about 22 and Z Tejas clearly cannot handle groups. Our waiter forgot our queso orders for the entire table but still tried to charge us   I had a mojito and it was way too sweet  It was almost undrinkable  I had the steak burrito and again I was disappointed    It was only steak and rice with some cheese. There was really no flavor to it  The steak was well cooked but the whole meal was very bland  I am a big fan of Mexican food so this was super disappointing. I think Z Tejas is a good place but not for groups.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,141,Reserved a table for brunch on my birthday and they still held it for me after I called letting them know I was going to be late.    Food was good   margaritas were strong. What more could I have asked for 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,142,Amazing food and awesome service  They give you free corn bread and it is so good we had to come back the next day to eat here again    I think our group loved the  1.99 margaritas at happy hour as well  I had the ceviche one day  and the eggs Benedict brunch the following day. I can t rave enough about how great this place is  if we lived in Austin  it would definitely be a staple 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,143,A good taste of Tex-mex food.  So many choices on the menu   Although there were many savory dishes  my favorite of my entire meal was the ancho chili pie   I would go there just to get that  So yummy 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,144,Always one of my first stops when I come to Austin to order my favorite drink the Chambord Margarita or two always good for a  quick snack from the happy hour menu the service is always pleasant the staff is friendly and professional the food is very tasteful and a great value
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,145,Nice sized restaurant on 6th Street far from the main group of bars and action.  The menu has a wide selection of choices. The deep fried catfish was amazing. The Street taco with steak was enjoyable.  The trout with cilantro pesto was superb.  The fudge pecan pie was excellent also  Margaritas were very tasty.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,146,Do not rely on them for food to go in this time of need.  They tried to sell me a   17 salad which I declined.  They said that was the price  right now 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,147,I have been to this restaurant a few times and the food is fresh  the menu contains many dishes to choose from and  most of all - haha - they have a beautiful little kitty named Kiki who lives there and likes to greet guests on the outside deck. The reason I am posting today is that our waiter - Michael - was one of the better waiters I have ever had - anywhere. He has been there for many years but we hadn t had his as our waiter before but he made the experience  a family lunch while one of my daughters is home from college  very pleasant and funny  We are a joking-type family and he joined right in.   I would always recommend this location but today I felt that it was an extra special occasion due to the company  menu and Michael. Ok and also the beautiful cat Kiki  Adorable 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,148,I think this place is over rated. It s got a decent atmosphere  but the food is super average. I wouldn t come here if you are looking to wow your palate. I have been multiple times over the years and had the tortilla soup  fajitas  enchiladas  among other things. It s always good  never great I would say. I m not sure if the drinks or margaritas are any good. I m sure they are decent as well. Anyways  if you have one meal in Austin or are craving great Mexican  look a few other places before you decide on Z Tejas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,149,Always a delight to eat here. I love the homemade cornbread. They also have really good queso. We have had several things on the menu but my daughters favorite is the Five Cheese Macaroni  amp  Achiote Chicken. I love the street tacos. I have tried most of the menu and the quality of the food is consistently great 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,150,Update  management reached out to me a few weeks ago to apologize and offer to make it up. I appreciate the outreach and offer  and though I won t be in Austin to accept it  I have updated my rating to 3 stars because of it.  I had a pretty terrible experience here. The wait was long when we arrived  which we were aware of and fine with. However  after two hours  and multiple check ins with the host  they had FORGOTTEN us. And we d been at the bar the whole time. We finally got seated and had to wait another 20 mins for a server to even come by. I know they were slammed but after 2.5 hours of waiting  we were starving and unhappy. Food and drinks also took so long to come out that we just had to pay and leave.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,151,Somewhat rainy Sunday and after a morning of shopping decided to head to Z Tejas for late lunch early dinner.  I used to go to the Z Tejas in Bellevue  WA and loved it until they closed down.  Had always had amazing meals and great service so was expecting nothing less in Austin.    Pros    - Great location and the old house it is in winds around with open indoor and outdoor spaces.  Imagine at night it is pretty as well as lights were strung up outside. - Nice menu and drink selection.  They used to do a great bloody mary bar on the weekends.  We were there a bit later so not sure if they still do.   - Our server was super sweet and balanced quite a few tables successfully as everyone seemed to want to sit in her outdoor section. - Salads we ordered  pecan encrusted chicken and jerk chicken  were both relish.    Cons   - Reception desk girls seemed less than thrilled that we were standing there waiting for a table. We had a reservation  not that they were busy  so got seated right away but a little less tude would have been nice. - Tableside guac was pretty bland.  Not much flavor so I would recommend something else if you can. - We found street parking  but kind of a busy area so not sure how hard it would be at a busier time. - A small thing.. but the manager  guess by his attire  was standing up front eating food and not interacting with the guests.  Everyone needs to eat  but doing it standing at reception  shoveling food in   Didn t look very professional.    Maybe it was just too much to think this location would live up to my previous experience.  Had hoped I had found an old friend  but given all the choices in Austin for tex-mex food  not sure we will be back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,152,I would have liked to at least try this place  however  when we arrived  we were seated  and got to watch a table get their drinks  order  and get their food without ever having a server even  talk  to us.  I would not go back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,153,What the heck happened to Z Tejas  A beloved Austin restaurant now with all the charm and ambiance of Olive Garden. They changed the lighting for the worse  brought in generic furniture and redid the menu. They staff seemed confused by some of he changes and had no answer for some menu related questions we asked  Bring back the real  Z Tejas 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,154,Corn bread with butter is a nice touch. Nice outdoor sitting area. Food is ok for what it is. Reasonable prices.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,155,Perhaps in a fit of nostalgia leading up to my 39th birthday  I felt it necessary to have another go at some of my old Austin favorites. Second stop on the list being Z Tejas. Its been roughly 20 years since I had the ruby trout entree that I used to love  revisited it lived up to its former grandeur.   There are alot of bites I still wish I could still consume. The Italian chicken fried steak and the happy hour chicken and eggplant pizza for  3 comes to mind at Spaghetti Western now Freddie s Place in South First. One last batch of fried catfish filets at Convict Hill Restaurant in Oak Hill  maybe one last slice of Pantera s pizza.   Enough reminiscing  we started our meal with the cornbread. If my memory is correct it used to be thin baguette slices. Served in a small cast iron skillet  the yaller paired well with the sweet cream butter. We also sampled the shrimp tostada bites for an appetizer. Perfectly cooked shrimp with guacamole and a dab of chipotle. The slaw garnish was also really tasty.  The ruby trout was close to what I remember. For some reason I think the mango in the relish wasn t there in the past. The fish nicely grilled with crispy edges was a blast from the past. Decent rice and flavorful green beans rounded out a great dish. Mrs. Rooster opted for the wild mushroom enchiladas and came up with similar praise for her dish.  Looking around while we were waiting to be seated  the digs haven t changed that much. One of my friends exclaimed that he gave up Z after Jack Gilmore left  and they took his favorite Navajo tacos off the menu. The day we visited  the tacos were actually a lunch special so their still around from time to time. Great service on our lunch visit  I only wish I could have had a few drinks after the meal instead of going back to work.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,156,We were thrilled to be able to eat at Z Tejas again after most of their locations outside Austin closed. The food and service are excellent. To be fair  some items are more standout than others but the standout items are really good. Highlights for us are the Tejas Trio  Shrimp Tostada bites  Santa Fe Enchilada  Smoked Chicken Relleno and Fajitas. Also love the margaritas  especially the Cadillac. Great staff  great service  great food. We highly recommend Z Tejas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,157,Delicious  perfect location. Great new management team   Nice balcony views. The Ruby Red Mimosa is the best Deep Eddy grapefruit vodka  cheers to brunch.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,158,We stopped by here on our way home from Port Aransas.  It was Sunday at lunch time so they had their brunch menu.  The menu was definitely different then typical Tex Mex.  I wish you also had the choice of standard lunch menu as well.  Its a little odd to have to pay for chips and salsa.  My husband had several cocktails but were small.  We each got ceasar salads to start.  We also had the cornbread which was very good.  They are good with a little different flavor  but small for the price.  We then shared the chorizo pork scramble skillet.  It was large and glad we shared  but it should have come with more then 2 tortillas.  It was good  but a little one note  it needed more of both sauces.  The food was a little better then average  but the service was awful.  We were sat right away  but the food and drinks took a long time.  The waitress barely paid attention to us and we had empty drinks many times.  I won t go back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,159,Today was my first time out to a restaurant since COVID-19 hit and I couldn t have been more impressed with how Z Tejas managed their business   Masks required until you get to your table and if you walk around  hand sanitizer everywhere  tables wiped and scrubbed  paper throw away menus and throw away cups utensils  tables distanced far apart  all employees with masks  and bathroom spotless.  I was out with 5 other nurses so we have that discerning eye   Brian  the manager  and Genesis  our server  made sure we had a wonderful lunch experience and as always  the food was delicious       I commend them highly for taking such great care of their customers 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,160,Great food  great service  great outdoor COVID-safe eating area.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,161,Came here for dinner for the first time and I got the Tejas Trio for appetizer which is queso  guacamole  and salsa with chips. The guacamole was pretty good and the queso was awesome as well. Very filling. For dinner I shared the mixed Fajitas with shrimp and chicken. Pretty good. Nothing too special about Z Tejas  it s your typical tex-mex. The prices were good as well as the customer service. Left satisfied and i d come back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,162,Blue provided excellent service and the food was amazing  We had Chorizo Stuffed Pork Tenderloin and it was delicious    Their drink specials  are reasonable  do take advantage of their happy hour and try the Jalape o Cucumber margarita    The only thing I was not a fan of and I am picky when it comes to this item  is their cornbread. Some may like it but I was not a fan  it was good  don t get me wrong  just not my favorite.   All in all it was a great experience with very appetizing food.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,163,Food was amazing but the service was terrible. We waited for 20 minutes to be greeted  and then an additional 20 minutes to receive our check. Additionally  our group noticed the customers buying alcohol received more attention.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,164,The drinks are delicious and we enjoyed the outdoor seating. We were able to find some interesting and fun items on their menu. Even the rice side was something that stood out as special.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,165,Fuck. Yes. Honestly so incredibly fun. Amazing customer service  wonderful space and the food is really tasty. Corn bread to start is all the hospitality you need 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,166,Worst restaurant experience in many many years.   A party of 30 happen to be there at same time. Which caused our order to be delayed an hour after seating. I get being busy but the waiter was so flippant about it. Casually mentioned that our order got in after the party of 30 So all of their food must be made first. When our food did come it was lukewarm and some of it actually cool. Literally no heat to the food. Two orders had wrong side order as well.   Waiter didn t communicate properly. Just a terrible experience. This restaurant used to great.   Seriously gone downhill. Not what it was 5  or 10 years ago. Way too many great restaurants to choose from.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,167,I had lunch at the 6th street location today and was reminded once again why I have been a customer all these years. I had a bowl of the tortilla soup for the first time and found it to be excellent  The soup had plenty of actual chicken chunks and the portion  bowl  size was very generous. This was thick tortilla soup  full of the good stuff   I also ordered my usual favorite entree  the Chicken Diablo Pasta  with the chicken pecan-breaded this time  which was fantastic. I sat at the bar and my bartender server  Bleu  provided attentive  fast service.  I should also mention the adequate parking since that is always a factor when deciding on a downtown lunch visit. No driving around and around the block or paying for valet.  I love this place 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,168,I can t believe I lived in Austin for some three years and failed to experience this place.   After a nostalgic run at Towne Lake--um  I mean Lady Bird Lake--I wanted a somewhat healthy brunch  so Melody L recommended Z Tejas. First thought of seeing the place--after our 10-minute parking escapade--was   Ahhhh.  Inviting  relaxing  perfect for a beautiful Austin day  I was totally  feelin   the place.  First up  bloody Marys. Fresh  cold and savory  yes. Spicy  no. But I didn t bother sending it back. After a night of heavy drinking  I m not sure if more Tabasco is what my tummy needed. Skipping the yum-o-looking app menu  we went straight to the good stuff. My Barbacoa Beef Breakfast Enchiladas   8.99  were borderline perfect. Not fatty at all  like how barbacoa meat tends to almost always be. The enchiladas were layered barbacoa between tortillas with  hot and tangy  green chile sauce  cotija cheese  green chile rice and black beans  topped with two eggs cooked over easy. Oh wait  there weren t eggs on my plate--either they forgot or ran out. But it wasn t a big deal to me. The enchiladas  black beans and rice were more than enough for this mujer.   Brunch was served with our choice of a freshly baked muffins  along with a fruit cup. We somehow didn t get one of our fruit cups  but like I said  food was more than enough  so no biggie. Mel and I shared.   The highlight of our meal was our waiter Lenny. He was full of positive energy  talkative  funny and an absolute delight to have. Request him on your next trip to Z Tejas. And check out my pic I posted of him. Now THAT S a kewl dude.  I ll definitely be back. Good food  service  prices and atmosphere.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,169,Wanted to try some TexMex so Decided to try this place out based off the Yelp reviews.  I m not sure why there are so many rave reviews.  There was nothing special about this place and actually thought my meal was subpar.  I got the Barbacoa enchiladas.  There was nothing particularly bad about them but nothing really good and for  12.50 I thought the meal was greatly overpriced.  The service started out questionable but when we said something it got better.  The best thing about this place is the tortilla chips.  Given that I was only in Austin for a few days I felt cheated by wasting one of my meals at this place considering how many good restaurants and food trucks there are.  I say skip this place.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,170,Great foo  street tacos 8 10. Will definitely return to try the smoked chicken street tacos. Atmosphere is nice for indoor outdoor. There is another building attached which makes it great for banquets.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,171,I used to really really enjoy this place... It was a spot that had a consistent menu of favorites. This most recent visit however  was a bit of a disappointment. Service was fantastic - so much credit to the folks working hard to give customers a top notch dining experience.   The issues for me were solidly based on the quality of food. It s just not what it used to be... Maybe this was a rough day  but not a single thing I ordered seemed to have been seasoned at all. The guacamole - bland. The shrimp tostada app - bland. The salsa - bland.   I had the Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad  which is one of my faves  was also a bit of a disappointment. The chicken was flavorful  but the black beans were not strained at all before being dumped into the salad... resulting in a soupy salad. Don t even bother adding any of the Ranch Vinaigrette... Food was swimming in liquid.   We used a gift card  tipped generously  but likely will not be returning anytime soon to use the remainder of the balance on the gift card.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,172,We came in on a Tuesday evening around 8. It wasn t busy  there was lots of seating. But for some reason they put our party of 7 very close to another table of 4  very loud women  in a room that felt like it was closed off from the rest of the restaurant. The music was loud and the ladies were even louder  And everything just echoed in this room  Our group couldn t even hold a conversation  We had to start yelling at each other across the table to be heard. This was verry frustrating for everyone so I kindly asked the waiter if he could ask the other table to bring it down a notch  we would like to enjoy our evening too. But he never did. So we had to to deal with them cackling and squealing for the majority of our dining experience until they finally got up and left. I didn t want to be rude but the wait staff should try to keep all of their customers happy.   So... I wish I could say the food was at least worth the headache... unfortunately that isn t the case. I got the beef fajitas which didn t taste as great as I had hoped. I didn t even bother taking home leftovers..  But I had 2 glasses of wine during dinner  the only good thing about my night here .
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,173,Food was pretty good. Nothing special overall though. I could name 5 taco food trucks that are leagues better than Z Tejas. Service was solid.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,174,The food isn t anything groundbreaking  but it s a really cool place with a lot of outdoor and patio seating   Their happy hour is pretty great - with  5 signature margaritas and appetizer specials   They have live music sometimes  too 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,175,I use to love this place.  Service was absolutely terrible from the moment we walked in.  There was barely anyone in the restaurant yet we had to wait for the host to seat us.  Serve the person in front of you NOT on the phone.  My waiter Morgan was  the worse. 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,176,In January  17 I dined at the one near the Arboretum off Highway 360.  I just flew in and was taking 3 other guests out to dinner.  We ordered the corn bread as the appetizer to share along with drinks.  It took FOREVER to get our drinks  we wound up ordering food after 15 min of looking at the menu yet still not having our drinks  and the corn bread finally arrived.   I was the lucky one to take a bite into it and discovered a long black hair in it   Obviously  we all ceased from eating it   I pointed it out to the server and they didn t offer to replace it.  We were all finally served our drinks  then meal  ridiculous amount of waiting time  and simply didn t enjoy the meal like I know this place normally can do.  We were never given our check and management never showed.  Our server totally disappeared.  I went to the bar tender to tell him our table and get our tab  it was about an hour later than it should have been so it felt  and told him what happened.  He never offered to do anything about the hairy corn bread experience nor even pointed it out to management.  I was even charged for the corn bread we never finished    I was so pissed that I just paid it and left.  I then sent an e-mail to corporate shortly after that and to this day  haven t heard any response.  About 10 months later  they filed bankruptcy  go figure  BUT somehow the Arboretum location still survived    I even have a code for a free appetizer  saved the receipt   yet I ve purposely refrained from ever going back.  Anyone who mentions Z-Tejas gets to hear about my experience  including no response from anyone after trying to reach out.  After seeing this receipt on my desk for a year  I decided to Yelp my experience.  I d avoid this place at all cost   If I do happen to hear from someone at corporate who cares  I may add a more favorable response to this  but I feel completely ripped off by this place and have no problem sharing my horrible experience with anyone who wishes to hear about it.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,177,This has always been one of my favorite restaurants. Food is different and oh so tasty  Great bar and outdoor seating.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,178,Horrible service. Waited 30 minutes to get our first drink and another 30 minutes to place an order. Got the food and it was cold. One of the dishes had paper in between the cheese.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,179,The best mushroom enchilada I ve ever had    This tip   review is a month late haha.. Better late than never  Will be posting more tips and pictures as I clean up the memory of my phone.  We went during happy hour. Great service  good food and nice location with huge patio area  Parking can be hectic on weekend nights tho  It is nice to add another vegetarian restaurant on my list.. I love it  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,180,If you can  sit on the patio  Draped with vines  you get a sense of covered privacy while still open to the world. Birds come in to visit  cool breezes wafted. It was like being the Swiss Family Robinson for the length of one meal.  We got there in time for Happy Hour  so our drinks  appetizer and my companion s quesadilla entree all qualified  Our appetizer was the Tejas Trio  salsa  guacamole  and  my favorite   a small skillet of queso with a spicy sauce drizzled on it.  Drinks were strong. I was on my ass after one Chambord margarita. My companion held it together with his OJ-infused marg.  I m not seeing why everyone has a hardon for the pan of corn bread  it was fine  but I didn t feel like it was terribly special.   For my entree I had the green chile barbacoa enchiladas  the meat was great  but the sauce was not as inspiring as I would have hoped. My laconic companion declared that his chicken quesadilla was  not bad.   Our waiter was affable and alerted us to the happy hour specials that we likely would not have realized otherwise.   Overall  a nice choice for Tex-Mex along the 6th Street strip.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,181,I HATED it here   The experience left me feeling horrible     To start  we actually had a nice green chile appetizer  but when the actual food came out  the disappointment began.  The big disappointment was the basic caesar salad.  After the waiter  offers  to switch out the dish for us  the manager came out to to replace my salad.  You know  the one they claimed to have a  Z Tejas twist  while actually tasting like watered down dressing with romaine lettuce.    So I found out he was the manager after awkwardly asking him  are you the manager  .  No introduction.  Would ve been nice instead of suddenly seeing this random man drop a tortilla soup in front of you with no explanation.  After that  the kind waitress who dropped her name almost 20 times to us  probably in an attempt to show how attentive she could be   became aloof and standoffish.  She seemed especially irritated when I insisted on boxing my own food saying something like  I was trying to be indulgent  in a flat tone.  I really didn t understand the mission of this restaurant  nor the reason I was there.  I wasn t expecting anything coming into a chain restaurant  and  I wasn t looking for much  just an acceptable standard food and a consistency of service.    Also  we had a couple burritos  tacos  and fajitas as well  wanted to sample the variety of their dishes .  Nothing stuck out. I ve had better  southwestern grill  food in a drive-through at New Mexico.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,182,Decided to try their takeout yesterday due to COVID19.   They are taking good precautions by everyone wearing masks and taking everyone s temperature upon arrival.  The food was well packaged and very tasty.   The only knock was their chicken fried chicken supposedly had a light crust on the menu  but what we received was a very thick crust.   It was still pretty good  but I removed a bunch of the crust.   Overall  I would recommend you try them.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,183,This restaurant is just like any other TexMex restaurant and blends in with the others-that is to say nothing unique about this place. We asked to sit at the  tree house  that was mentioned in a mother review but it was reserved and off limits. The inside is on the smaller side and our server seemed rushed and preoccupied even though he was polite. The rubbed ruby salmon was an okay entree but lacked serious flavor.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,184,Very delicious food. We had the cornbread with sweet butter. Wonderful  We had thr Tejas Trio as our appetizer. Fabulous  The green Chile chicken fried rib-eye with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed squash and carrots were excellent. The gravy that came with this dish was stick to your ribs goodness. Definitely would eat here often if we called Austin home.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,185,I ve eaten here once and I don t think I ll be coming back. I was a little disappointed because the food was average and I was expecting it to be really good  It wasn t bad but the portions are huge so you get your money s worth. I decided to give an extra star for that and also the restaurant provides complimentary valet parking.   Anyways  I m generally not picky with the food but the service here also made me upset a little. I think the server may have been recently hired or the place was a little understaffed. The food took awhile to arrive  our server repetitively kept giving us the wrong food because he got tables mixed up. I guess I just came to try the place out at the wrong time but this place didn t interest me enough to come again.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,186,I have been really excited to try Z Tejas for a long time  especially considering the connection to Chef Jack Gilmore  Jack Allen s Kitchen . We took some friend s for brunch this morning  arriving a little after 10 30am. The set up is an old house converted into a restaurant  which is pretty common in the West 6th area. It was clean  but not the vibe I was expecting.   I got the Breakfast Rellano  which was decent  but definitely didn t live up to what I was hoping for. Rather than the pepper being stuffed with egg  cheese  veggies  and meat  it was more like a pile of that stuff with a roasted pepper draped on top. I ordered some extra tortillas and just made tacos out of it. My wife ordered the meat hash with an over easy egg  which was good but not great. The flavor was pretty good  it just didn t seem as fresh and exciting as I was hoping.   The service was really bad. The server did not seem to have menu recommendations or appear to care to pretend like he did. After our first round of drinks  we didn t see him for nearly 25 minutes. We had to walk to the bar to ask for refills on water and new drinks. I saw a hostess go to our server after noticing that we were walking to the bar and tell the server  during his 25 min absence   and we still didn t see him until well after another employee brought our food out.   Overall  a very underwhelming experience. It was by no means bad  except for the service   but the food has some potential with the correct execution I think.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,187,We were originally on our way to have lunch down the street when I said   oh look  Z Tejas  They have been bookmarked on my yelp for a while so let s check them out   It was 3pm on a Friday and not busy at all. Only a few tables were occupied both inside and on the patio. There was a hostess stand to the left of us when we walked in but no one was at it so we stood and waited.   5 minutes went by and several staff members passed us without saying anything like  hello  just a minute  or  we ll have someone right with you  so I started to wonder if we were supposed to seat ourselves. If that was the case they wouldn t have a hostess stand I figured  so we continued to wait another 5 minutes and finally had someone acknowledge and seat us.   We gave him our drink order and he promptly got them out to us minus the beer my husband ordered. That came another ten minutes later after we had been sitting with our menus closed the whole time waiting to order.  Chips and salsa aren t free here  they are  5 but bottomless and come with three different salsas. The chips were stale  but all 3 salsas had a decent punch to them which I enjoyed. Our favorite was the avocado salsa verde. Not too long before our food came they brought a skillet cornbread to our table with honey butter. We weren t sure if that was due to our wait and the slow service  or something they do with every table. It was alright but nothing mind blowing. I did like that there were actual chunks of corn in the cornbread.  The rest of the food was good but not worth the hefty price tag. I got the street tacos and my husband had the chicken fajitas. Street tacos are meant to be small and they come 4 to a plate with a side of rice and beans for almost  13. I can get the same plate essentially at On the Border for  10 and wouldn t be able to taste the difference.   It just didn t live up to the hype for me. There are many  many other places to go in Austin for better and cheaper Mexican  where they even give you free chips  If they brought the prices down it could be a winner but as is just left both of us feeling meh.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,188,Delicious and nice atmosphere. Had great service  The margaritas were so good. The ceviche was sooo good  Different but amazing  Had the fish tacos and I highly recommend  so good. Perfect flakey crunch and pico. Fianc  had the burrito and enjoyed it as well. Basic Tex mex but delicious and great if you wanna see 6th street too.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,189,The food is good but the best part is the server  JoJo. He is so incredible and awesome and the highlight of the night by visiting here.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,190,Not the same ol Z Tejas. They do have music now on the patio which is cool. I would prefer it if they would grab an old menu from a couple of years ago and go back to that.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,191,This was our first time eating here at Z Tejas and we had such a great experience  Scotty was our waiter and he was amazing with how welcoming he made the experience  The food and drinks were also great  We will definitely be back for drinks and dinner anytime 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,192,This place has gone down hill. There brunch takes forever with no one in the place and the sausage puff pastry was just a puff pastry. Yawn.  I m done with this place
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,193,First time back since reopening after COVID-19 and had a wonderful experience  Sat in the breezy patio  enjoyed delicious margaritas  queso and piping hot chicken fried chicken. Our waiter was direct and honest about what to expect and it was so nice to be out and about  in a safe environment. We ll be coming back very soon for some patio margs very soon.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,194,Insulting to real Tex Mex restaurants.  I get that I came  right after a massive rush ...I used to work in a restaurant and sometimes it takes a few minutes to get caught up- but the strand of hair in my wedge salad  warm  lettuce I might add - was a sign.  Smothered burrito was anything but. It was dry and cold- salad was warmer.  Pass....
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,195,So I am Austin native and really made NO effort to try Z Tejas. Finally gave them shot  HAHA I think I realized why I never gone after last night.   Not sure if i want put all the BLAME on the server or the hostess. But our server was beyond  OVER SEATED. He had more than 4  tables with more than 4 seated. So of course he was unable to attend to our table. But the service he provided was beyond disappointing.   He was forgetting drinks left and right  barely any refills. Crap I would have liked another margarita  but by the time he asked me for another I had already finished my meal. We honestly had to remind him we ordered a frozen margarita.   You know that complimentary chips and salsa offered with every meal  yeah we asked for that. Guess when it arrived  Yep after the entrees arrived. No. I do not want those chips and salsa anymore. They re over 50 minutes late. We ve already eaten appetizers and starting on our entrees.    The real icing on the cake was  the check. He asked  would we like the check split. To which we all said NO     So please explain to me  why he felt the need to split our check 3 ways. That was the exact thing we asked the server NOT to DO. Sorry but isn t one of the top skills as a server is to LISTEN. Because you re clearly missing stuff. Like drinks  chips and salsa  and no split checks.  It was so aggravating to watch our server provide A   service to his other tables and just drop the ball left and right with our table. I m sorry  did he think he wouldn t get a great tip from us.  I will swear up and down  he provided chips and salsa to every single table  while our just sat on the wall wondering WHY       1. Forgot Drinks  NO REFILLS only on water. You should be pushing the liquor to make sales. 2. Forgot complimentary Chips and Salsa  would have increase liquor sales.  3. Dirty Silverware  yeah  Never got the clean fork I had to ask for. Really  4. Split the Check  when it wasn t asked for. Glad you thought it was good idea. NOT. Smh   Obviously will NEVER return. I was just disgusted with my service. Your food can be great  but when your service is this poor. Ain t nobody got time for this. They re plenty of better restaurants in the Austin Area and especially in the Downtown Area that will be wiling to provide adequate service and amazing food.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,196,The good  you re going to find everything you would love in Tex-Mex here. good margaritas  good enchiladas good rice and beans. Etc. etc. The service is pretty quick also.   The Bad  BRUNCH REVIEW  if you order anything with potatoes be aware they are spicy. I love spice so enjoyed them  my dinner partners did not enjoy it very much though.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,197,We love this place  Stopped in here on my first night after moving to Austin  and it was such a great welcome to the city. The margaritas are amazing  the staff is wonderful and so kind  and the food is fresh and satisfying. Cannot recommend Z Tejas enough  it s quickly becoming our go-to spot for casual  and delicious  dinner and drinks. Can t wait to be back 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,198,Yes  I come here often...that speaks to how much I like dig place   We are usually there for brunch - I literally crave the breakfast relleno  but tonight we were there for my birthday dinner celebration with my sister  bro-in law  niece and nephew  looking for a kid friendly place for a 4 and 6 year old  not easy  It was a perfect place for all I thought  We were there early enough for happy hour  till 7 on weekdays  so our chips and trio of dips was only about  5. And  5 Rita s - however my sis and I weren t crazy on the original rocks  too sweet for our taste  but our waiter Jordan had a great recommendation of the Tejas Mule and Skinny Rita which we liked SO much better   The Smoked Chicken Relleno was awesome and the Street Tacos appetizer. I can t speak to the other meals at the table since I didn t try them but the ancho chili pie was like the pie version of Mexican hot chocolate....although the adults wanted more heat with the chili  however my niece polished it off so it was a good one for all   Jorden was a great waiter - always there to fill our waters or see if we needed something else  easy going yet efficient. Thanks for not disappointing Z 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,199,UPDATE  So we had ordered the Diablo pasta but with no chicken or meat cause my friend was a strict vegetarian. When it first came out there was chicken in it and once we told our server  he apologized and got us a fresh new plate. Since we were full we took it home and next time discovered little chicken bits throughout the dish...  Took off one star for that    Wonderful service here   We arrived less than a hour from closing  but we were promptly served with a welcoming smile. We got the cornbread with honey butter  green chile queso  Diablo pasta  and the smoked chicken enchiladas. The food was superb especially the green chile queso   Our server Eric was exceptional and extremely helpful. He went out of the way to make sure we were fully satisfied with our meal  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,200,Recently we dined at this little gem in Austin  WOW WHAT AMAZING FOOD ATMOSPHERE AND SERVICE   Our waiter Carlos was so informative and friendly  He rec mixed drinks and appetizers that did not disappoint    Then on to our entrees... AGAIN.SO.DELICIOUS  One caveat parking is a bit limited. Nonetheless this a must  for any and all who live or visit the city of Austin 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,201,The restaurant and service is all very nice  the three stars is only because of the food. Mainly  their mushroom enchiladas. The free nachos came with really good thick salsa  better than most Tex mex places. The cornbread was really good and so were the shrimp tostado bites  even though they were pretty overpriced   12 . However  the enchiladas were so onion-y it was overpowering. The mango salsa on top of the enchiladas were also packed with onions you really can t taste any of the mango. If you want something on the menu similarly priced  I would get the chicken avocado sandwich   12 . I saw the dish at someone else s table and it looked really good-especially the fries which were huge.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,202,Alright  I ll admit it. It s a chain. There s no getting around it. It s a fact I tried to avoid for all too long. It wasn t until my own mother told me there was one in Arizona that I finally succumbed to cold and bitter fact. We all have those things we re in denial about. For some  it s substance abuse. For me it was finally admitting that this place was actually a chain. But the fact that Z Tejas is a chain does not take away from the fantastic meals they provide that takes tex-mex to a whole new level. I ll never forget the first time I experienced the Southwest Chicken Enchilada that changed my world... forever.   I was still a young man  a student in fact at the University of Texas at Austin  hook  em   taking a beautiful girl on a first date. Of course  I had no idea I was taking her to a chain  but I would do it all over again. I wasn t 21 quite yet so I ordered an ice cold Coca-Cola and we enjoyed the spectacular atmosphere and partook in that typical first date jargon. The place was pretty cool  but I wasn t blown away quite yet... but then my meal came.   A smoked chicken enchilada with the perfect amount of classic southwest kick whose origins come from somewhere around the Mexican border. It was one of those moments when you consume your food in utter disbelief because your mouth doesn t quite know the joy it s experiencing. I occasionally commented on the incredible quality of the meal  but for the most part  the 1st date jargon was over and my new priority was focusing on destroying this unreal tex-mex dish.    I must say  as a Michigander  I was still new to tex-mex  but the incredible taste still remains after all these many years  2 . Every now and then  I ll go back to Z Tejas with that same beautiful young lady and enjoy the taste of that enchilada one more time.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,203,Ordered the chicken tortillas soup yesterday and was very disappointed in what I received. There was more broth then anything and vary little chicken and no avocado even though I requested it. I have eaten here numerous time and was surprised by this.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,204,I have been a loyal customer for years.  This was our go to place when in doubt.  We use to love this place and the food.   When free cornbread stop being free you could tell that someone was making changes and not for the better.  Portions have gotten smaller  more expensive and just not the quality they use to have.  Then they changed the big steak fries to small thin fries  not a good change at all.  Also the burgers use to be cooked on char grill  now they are preparing them on flatiron.  Our last visit was our last visit.  Horrible service and food was marginal.   Sad to see what use to be one of our favorites going down the drain.  Yes they have already closed Avery Ranch location  waiting for the rest of them to shutter their doors.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,205,Quality food but definitely pricey  The food is pretty good but I just can t help but feel that in a city with so many cheap delicious food options it s a bit of a waste to splurge on a place like this.  Food is good and more fancy and varied than street fare or barbecue but it s not phenomenal. Pork tenderloin is recommended
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,206,This location is convenient to my office  so I end up going for lunch pretty frequently. The food has never totally wow d me  for the price there are simply other places I enjoy going more if given the option. However  their customer service wins it an additional star from me.  I had the misfortune of having a pretty bad experience when I had lunch with my coworkers--slow service despite the location not being very busy  an inattentive server  mixed up order  and hair in the food  no comp . Had it stayed at that  we probably never would have returned.  However  my coworker brought the issues to the attention of Z Tejas via social media  and they responded by inviting us back for lunch complete with appetizers and desserts. The manager even came over to us and spoke politely with us about the issues from our previous lunch. I m not one to condone rewarding complaining  but considering we were a group that frequents the restaurant  it was nice to see them put out the extra effort to win us back.  Z Tejas is not one of my favorite spots in town  but it s convenient  tasty enough  and they obviously care about their customers. That s why I ll keep going back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,207,Fabulous happy hour menu. Great outdoor patio - allow dogs on patio    Drinks and service are usually always great. I ordered sesame ginger dressing to-go after how good it was on my salad 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,208,I actually really like z tejas and dont understand when people tell me that its overpriced. I get the cheaper summer deals and they actually come out really good. I liked the fish tacos that i ordered. The problem with z tejas is they have pretty bad side dishes. The mexican rice is really bitter and seasoned weird. The black beans dont taste right as well. I like the beef fajitas i got but didnt care too much for the sides.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,209,It only took us 5  years to get to Z Tejas  and I can guarantee it won t take nearly so long for us to return   I had the Bananas Foster French Toast  and my only complaint is that the portion was far too much for me to finish. Oh  I wished I could enjoy every cinnamony  banana-filled bit  though  It was excellent. My wife s enchiladas were excellent  too.  My other  first world   complaint is that I had a heck of a time choosing from the menus  Lunch or Brunch  and EVERYTHING sounded fantastic  We plan to return soon to try more items.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,210,So I ordered the Diablo Pasta with jerk chicken and personally I didn t like it. It was too greasy and wasn t tasty or flavorful. The dish wasn t worth the price in my opinion.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,211,A real solid Happy Hour offering is the best reason to venture to Z Tejas. Overall the food is good but it s not great. The drinks and the casual nature of the restaurant are the highlights. Beyond that it is typical Tex-Mex  you can t really go wrong with fajitas  tacos  amp  margaritas  but don t expect to be blown away either. Happy Hour runs Monday-Friday 3 - 7pm  amp  Saturday and Sunday 3pm - 5pm  amp  the highlight is the  5 margaritas.  We haven t been but I have heard good reviews of the brunch on the weekends on Saturday  amp  Sunday from 10am - 3pm with a  5 build your own Bloody Bar.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,212,Z-Tejas has been around for many years now and has been a stable in our lives.  This original location has so much charm and quirkiness to it  it s usually our go to rita stop when we find ourselves in West Austin.  We have our favorite items which ties us over while have a few of their ritas.  We generally will start  with the Tejas Trio.  A great combination of Queso  Salsa and Guacamole.  The chips are always excellent.  Their Salsa has a great smokiness to it  perhaps Adobe spice  not sure  but it is a bit different from other Tex-Mex offerings around town.  The Guacamole is fresh and Queso is creamy with a swirl of salsa placed on top.  We then jump into the Aha Tuna appetizer.  This is one of our favorite appetizers in town.  Often copied elsewhere  but they don t quite hit the mark like they do at Z Tejas.  Blackened and encrusted with sesame seeds makes for a crunchy  velvety tuna experience.  They have a peppercorn vinaigrette which is laid down on the plate first  with the Tuna placed on top.  It s a great play on the sweetness of the vinaigrette and the blackened spice rub on the Tuna.  And for the win  their friggin cornbread served in a skillet.  Who would of thought such a simple dish could round out these two appetizers  but it does.. in spades.  Make sure you ask for a serving when you are there.  Drinks are on point.  During their happy hour you will find the above Appy s between 5-7 bucks and signature margarita s at 5 bills.  We usually like the frozens with a chambord swirl in them.  They are pretty dang potent and will get you there pretty quickly.  They have skinny rita s for the ladies and a good selection of beers.    Although we generally find ourselves there for HH  they have many solid dinner items and offer a seasonal menu. How I missed reviewing this years ago is beyond me.  They have always consistently provide us with excellent service  we always like to sit at the bar  and great times to celebrate the day with.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,213,I came on to trustworthy Yelp to determine whether or not I wanted to take my parents here. Well  should have gone with no. I m going to give an account from start to finish. We walked in to a semi-crowded restaurant where the hostess came over  asked if we had been helped in a mumbled tone and then proceeded to answer the phone and help another customer. Hmmm  I believe door customers are greeted and dealt with first  Strike one. We sat down only to be staring at menus for 15 minutes before my mom and I shouted  because of the noise  to a waitress passing by to see who the hell our waiter was. She offered nicely to get our drinks and walked up to the guy who was supposed to be our waiter. The waiter gave us some garbage about being tied up with something in the kitchen....code for  I was shooting the breeze with my other coworkers . Strike two and two and a half.   Onto the food. The best I can give you is that it s like a mediocre Chili s....and I like Chili s and would prefer to eat there over this place. The cornbread was pretty good and the margaritas were decent  albeit there is too much ice with ones on the rocks. My mom and I both had the cilantro trout which was bland even with the mango salsa and you couldn t even taste the cilantro.   Save your money and eat somewhere where the service is better and the food actually pleases your palate.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,214,Since the change in ownership I ve been overall mildly disappointed with the food. While still a good option in a pinch and a fun atmosphere  I generally feel like the food is just  Meh . Their cornbread  which used to be delicious  and free   is now half the size and not as flavorful as before. Not to mention that now that it costs money  you re supposed to feel good about it because it s for charity. But when you read the fine print it s only  a portion of the proceeds  from the cornbread that goes to charity. Seeing as it use to be free  I d at least feel good about it if it all went to charity and was still tasted as good.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,215,Have NOT been to this place in years  but my wife and I decided to give it a try last night  early on New Year s eve. My wife ordered a chicken dish and I decided to go with the ahi tuna ceviche. Service proved just fine  food needed work. Over-salted veggies with my wife s dish  and an overpowering seasoning on the ceviche for me. Nice touch was the complimentary corn bread  would have been better with another few minutes in the oven.  The meals at this restaurant rocked under chef Jack Allen  maybe current management should take note.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,216,Good as usual. Another must visit place when we travel to Austin.  Great food and margaritas. I had the chicken and pesto sandwich  the bun seemed fresh baked.  The service is always great and the staff is friendly.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,217,This place is cute. No food specials for happy hour and very small drinks for the  price. I m not going  back
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,218,They have a good reputation  but our meals and the service was very disappointing.  I had veggie fajitas- the majority of the veggies were baby carrots.  No seasonings. Strike them off your list.  Slow inattentive service - had to get up 3 times to get the waiter to finish bringing our food to the table. Had to get up 2 times to get them to process our check.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,219,What can I say   We were looking for Tex-Mex but I would classify this as Southwestern - and it was great Southwestern.  We had the trio appetizer and could have created a meal out of it.  Queso was fantastic  salsa solid  guacamole a little bland but we doctored with salt and pepper and it came right back.  My daughter had the jerk chicken salad and loved the jerk seasoning.  My son had the shrimp fajitas and was raving about them.  My wife had the smoked chicken enchilada which was stacked - unusual preparation for us  but very tasty where you could really taste the smoke with the cheese and red sauce.  I had the VooDoo Tuna which was solid - great combination of seared ahi - blackened  ginger and soy.   Very good.    Service was fantastic  prompt  friendly and engaged.  Vibe was very cool.  All in all - a fantastic meal and experience.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,220,I went here on Sunday when my family came to visit me  The service was tremendous   The waiter was extremely friendly  amp  got us everything we needed. The food was very good. I had the breakfast quesadilla  my family had the fish tacos  beef fajitas  amp  the breakfast special. Will be back soon  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,221,Chile Pork Verde  amp  Catfish Beignets are wonderful   3-7 HH  Mon-Fri.  This places double as a chill spot to hang with friends or a great spot to take the family to. There chile pork are bursting with flavor and smothered in cheese. Definitely  not the healthiest   but a solid cheat meal for sure. I also LOVE their catfish.Everything came out nice and hot. During the HH they also have special drink pricing. There s lots of seating at this joint   including outside. The staff are nice and helpful. I needed ketchup for my beignets   but our waitress wasn t around so another server came to me and asked if I needed something  He had my ketchup to me within seconds  If you re picked  you ll get a receipt to fill out survey and when complete you ll get one of those bomb appetizers free.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,222, lategram - one Saturday afternoon  we stopped in for an afternoon delight  amp  had a simple guacamole  amp  queso with chips along with some delicious cocktails and truly enjoyed the vibe  the service  amp  of course the food and drinks. The service was friendly  amp  the prices were great  We will definitely return to dine at this location again. Parking was actually not that bad during the afternoon time frame.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,223,The OUTSTANDING service is what made this meal memorable. Our waiter was friendly  fast and just super helpful. He was super accommodating with all of our requests.   Food isn t the best Tex Mex I ve ever had  but it s tasty. Probably 3 stars. The salad was eh  not super fresh or exciting  but fine   the Tejas Trio was yummy and good to share. The drinks were delicious. In particular  I liked the skinny strawberry margarita - ask for it with jalape o flavoring.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,224,I stopped in for some tacos and tequila. The Tacos were solid street style with onions and cilantro. I sat at the bar the the bartender was friendly  attentive and she was quite attractive as a bonus.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,225,I always enjoy the food and the overall experience at Z Tejas. The elevated layout gives it an aerial feel and the decorations create a homey atmosphere. I always split the trio appetizer with a party and really enjoy the consistency of their guacamole. Every dish is delicious but my favorite is the Achiote chicken chopped salad. This is a great place for a Tex mex enthusiast  looking for a fun place to eat with friends 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,226,The food is not bad  SW comfort food. The four stars are for the jalapeno margarittas which are fantastic.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,227,You guys. Save yourself. Do not order the southwestern bake at brunch. It sounds like a delicious egg sausage bacon m nage of a breakfast casserole. But it is not. It is like they tried to make banana nut bread but with tiny bits of sausage and no banana. Then they soaked the entire thing in a green and red salsa and bits of soggy bacon until it s unrecognizable and you have to take a few bites before even realizing it s just a loaf of bread that has been disgustingly dressed up and soaked in other things. 90  bread though. Very misleading. My mother got so sick even looking at hers that she had to send it back and get pancakes instead  we were charged for them  and I was able to just delve into my Bloody Mary and the muffin basket for sustenance. Do not order the breakfast bake.  Waitress was super sweet and professional though.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,228,I ve loved Z Tejas for years. Decades   Great margaritas  great food.   Can easily fill up on just the great appetizers  so have to pace. Because the entrees are awesome.  So enjoy the tostado bites and catfish tacos and table side guacamole.  But save room for baked seafood enchiladas or one of the great pastas or the trout.  All good.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,229,Staff was very friendly  had 1 person in our party under 21  Z was only place on 6th that would allow us in to eat. Food good  prices good 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,230,We came here for a bachelorette party and we have never received any better service  Benny was the best server  The owner even came over and made sure that we were happy  They were amazing  The food was AMAZING  What a great choice for such a great weekend 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,231,ZTejas has always been a consistent restaurant for me. Good food. Friendly staff. Today  I was sitting outside alone on the patio hanging brunch. My server was very nice  but I think he may have gotten pretty busy with his big top table inside  because he was a little more scarce than the the usual service. He apologized for taking a long time to bring my hot sauce that he offered to have my meal entirely comped. I told him that it wasn t necessary. I could tell he was working as hard as he could and didn t hold his infrequent stops outside against him. I m not a high maintenance customer anyways.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,232,VERY average. The appetizer and entree arrived at the same time  the ceviche was tasteless  We had to ask for limes to juice to make it taste like anything. The rest of the food was overpriced for what it was. Too noisy  uncomfortable  and the service was also lacking. I can think of a dozen other places in Austin that serve the same style of food but do it so much better. They get points for not charging us for our appetizer  but we won t be going back simply because there s no good reason to  Food  service  environs   very average.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,233,Yum Yum. I think I found a great spot for great corn bread and fish tacos AND not have to fight for parking.  I went on a Friday night for dinner  and I was already anxious about having to find parking on the street. Luckily  ZTejas has complimentary valet and all I had to do was tip.   To begin  I m a huge fan of cornbread. I travel back to Houston on a bad craving  besides having to visit family. The cornbread here turned out to be really good. It s not crumby  but very moist  not too sweet  and consistent in texture. If you re used to your corn bread having little corn kernels  well  this doesn t have it..but who cares  it s good corn bread close to home.   I had the blackened catfish tacos. The portion was huge..at least for me  but if you re a hungry man  I think it ll suffice. Imagine two large tortillas filled with blackened catfish  sweet slaw  and bright green avocados  then both cut in half. To do honest I was expecting the little  individually stuffed tortillas rather than wraps. It was delicious.   Some people rave about the service  but my friends and I think we got the shorter end of the stick. Our waiter was nice  but maybe he was tired and wasn t as accommodating as we d expect him to be 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,234,We rented the downstairs venue for an anniversary party.  Staff was great leading up to event and outstanding service  food and follow through at the event.  Would highly recommend  none better in Austin. Mark
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,235,Still the standard of excellence for Southwestern cuisine.  Quality ingredients  obviously cooked pretty much from scratch.  Loved the appetizer of chips  salsa  queso  and guacamole.  Even though it s a common appetizer  Z s manages to make this a phenomenal start to the meal.  It s obvious that none of the appetizer plate came from a jar.  The chicken fried ribeye is my new standard for chicken fried steak excellence.  Combine that with the mashed potatoes.   The mashed potatoes were uncommon in that they weren t seasoned or flavored with any other flavor.  Just good mashed potatoes that didn t require any accompaniments.  Combine this meal with a server who was efficient  friendly  and full of recommendations about the menu  yet who wasn t overly chummy  obsequious  or familiar and you have a five star dining experience.  It s little wonder to me that Z Tejas still is open after all these years.   Good food and good service go a long way.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,236,I just had the best  friendliest service at Z Tejas. Our server was super friendly  just the right amount of attentiveness  and I actually believe he loves his job. He spilled a tiny bit of water and said something like  Sorry  Spillary Clinton 2016.   Love.   Anyway  I ve been coming here for years  pre- and post-chain  and I can vouch for all their brunch items. Entrees are around  10 and there are lots of vegetarian options. The restaurant is airy and bright  and makes me feel like I m on vacation.   Other standouts   - ancho chili pie - wild mushroom enchiladas  so. good.  - eggs benedict - z  salad
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,237,This place is awesome. Michael petty is the best server ever. Food is amazing  He s amazing . Do not pass go...stop here. Next exit  Now  Love this place.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,238,Love this location  Our server was great along with our food. Definitely will be eating here again  Very satisfied 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,239,This was a great restaurant good food and great service.  The cornbread was delectable.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,240,This was my first meal in Austin and  to be honest  it was a bit of a letdown.  We started with strawberry margaritas which were good and had the tableside guacamole  i.e.  the avocado is mashed into guac along with other toppings right in front of you  and it also was good.    But I had the santa fe chicken enchilada and my friend had the wild mushroom enchilada  and neither was anything special.  I expected more from Austin and particularly from Mexican food in Austin.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,241,I love this place. It s an icon in Austin and when I was a junior attorney and lived Nextdoor   this was a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Today it is still wonderful  Today is also its 30th  Or 40th anniversary. Come on by and say hi  Cheers 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,242,Went last night for a late dinner. Food is always wonderful. Michael was so attentive checking on us throughout our meal...even took my phone to the back to charge for me since it was about to die  Great experience all around.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,243,If I m in Austin I eat here  Must try    Service  food and staff is everything I could ask for.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,244,The food was great and the waiter was very courteous and professional. Would definitely recommend this place and try it again.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,245,I am very impressed with this restaurant. We came at a very slow time and didn t eat an actual meal but our frozen house margaritas  salsa  queso and complimentary cornbread was SO GOOD  On top of our service from Uriel that was top notch. The patio was perfect place to catch some rays. I can t wait to come back
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,246,Z-Tejas is surprisingly great.   I don t really know why I didn t expect much before I went the first time  but every time I ve gone I get amazing service and fun  non-traditional   extremely tasty  mexican-ish food.  I m surprised this place doesn t get amazing reviews from everyone because I really do think its a gem.  --    5 5  The bread that they serve with the entrees is fresh and perfectly baked. Both the cornbread and the other one were incredible.    5 5  Chile Rellenos.  Sauce was perfect.  Textures were perfect. Its an fun dish with a lot going on.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,247,It was long overdue for a trip to Z Tejas  a place I used to frequent with friends when they were looking to have a  Big Stix Showdown .  Oh geez  don t ask how those went......what a blur.  I can t believe they allow us back into the place.   I ve kinda been on a Happy Hour binge lately  so I met up w  my friend Mr. Imbiss who came in from The Big E lgin .  I m glad I came here because I forgot how nice this place is  especially with all the sunlight and good weather  it s almost like an oasis.  It s very bright  plenty of outside seating  and even when you re inside you feel like you re on an outside patio.    For HH they have  0.50 off beer   1 off cocktails   margaritas   wine  and half off appetizers.  We shared the Blackened Catfish Tacos  Seared Ahi Tuna  Catfish Beignets  and Grilled Shrimp  amp  Guacamole Tostada Bites.  Pigs you say   Shoot  give us a reason to get together for food and drinks and we ll show you a damn good time.  Yeeeee HAW   Overall the food was pretty good  nothing outta this world  but still very good.  My favorite was the Seared Ahi Tuna  the quality was excellent and it tasted great.  The Grilled Shrimp  amp  Guac Bites were my next fave  the shrimp were large-marge and it was like a party in your mouth.  I did not think the guacamole had that much of a distinct taste  but I would order them again.  I thought the Catfish Beignets were a dessert item and be on the sweet side  but they were deep fried catfish w  a dipping mayo - - not greasy at all  and I liked the dip.  And the catfish tacos   Oh yeah  tasty  although I prefer more blackened - - next time I ll ask.   Our server was good - yet busy  but the managers walk around and help clear the tables and fill your drinks.  We had a nice conversation w  one of the female managers  she was very nice and personable  easy to talk to and eager to please.  It got crowded at dinner time  a wait list developed.  They also have complimentary valet parking too - - which is quite cool.    I will definitely go back very soon  it s an enlightening and colorful place to hang out with family and friends.  Just beware of the Big Stix - - WHOA 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,248,A favorite place of mine for what I would call more of a southwestern style for Mexican dining. I live downtown so it s just a quick bike ride or walk  but there s both street parking and valet parking available for those who have to drive.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,249,This is one of my favorite restaurants in town  not just because of the food  but because of the service. This one server  Dalton  is by far my favorite server there. He is very genuine and caring about what you want and need as a guest.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,250,I don t understand why people think this place is so special. Great restaurants with great salsa don t charge you   5.00 for it. And another thing  what s the deal with glorifying guacamole  You cut it in half  take the seed out  and mash it up. Salt  lime  and pico if you want...nothing to it.  Enchiladas should be rolled    SMH  Ever left your beans in the pot too long  That s what mine looked like.  Chef  please focus less on presentation and more on flavor.   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,251,My brunching circuit took me to Z Teja s this morning. YUM.   One of my faves so far  for sure.   Started with a delightful Mimosa-- 3  not quite the  1 mimosa at Taverna  but in all fairness--it tasted AWESOME. We had a quick 20 minute wait--no problem at all  milled around on the patio in the sunshine.   Once seated--waitress was fabulous. Very efficient while still being friendly. Her suggestions were spot on  I was having trouble deciding whether to get the toast  muffin  or pancake w  my brunch selection .   I had the chicken and potato hash--SO TASTY. Involves chicken  potatoes  red peppers  diced poblanos  chipotle hollandaise  corn with two over easy eggs cooked on top. Next time I ll prob ask for the eggs to be over medium  they were a teeensy bit under done for my liking.   My bruching partner in crime got the huevos rancheros--also a hit. She said they were quite tasty w  fresh avocado slices and pico.   Both of us got the pancake as our side item. HOLY COW. AMAZING. Don t waste any time pondering which side-get the pancake. HUGE plate sized sucker that s fluffy and thick and SO GOOD. Did I mention it was good  It was.  Total bill was  25 with tip for two people  mimosas were ordered at the bar--so with mimosas  prob  30 or 35 .
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,252,Seriously skeezed out at my last visit... After a long night out met friends for brunch Sunday.. And I found some weird shiz floating in my beverage  I then found some cool left overs in my fork before I used it... Thank goodness I didn t toss my cookies but I asked my waiter politely and discreetly and he got pretty defensive that this wasn t his fault  he can t control any of this.. I said  yes but you can get me a clean fork   HELP ME HELP YOU BRO there were flies all over inside  I couldn t even bring myself to eat... I ve had it with Z. Just feels so 10 years ago  why bother when there are such fun places in Austin   Bottom line if you re a germaphob don t go 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,253,Oh Z   I used to love thee. I ve eaten so many meals at or from Z that I ve lost count. So when I had to take my family out for a special occasion  and we had a vegetarian in the mix  I picked Z Tejas.  Service was great and attentive. Our waiter came by multiple times to check on drink app food orders. The cocktails were good  and the salsa trio app we ordered was delicious.  Beyond this  things broke down a bit. My folks enjoyed the pork tenderloin and the veggie quesadilla. My husband s tortilla soup was bland  and way too smoky. My voodoo tuna was burnt on the outside but cooked correctly  medium  on the inside. I tried scraping off the char  but the burnt smell was too much to handle. My waiter brought a replacement  which was now rare on the inside  and still charred on the outside. By this time  my appetite and special occasion were heading downhill rapidly.  To their credit  two different managers came out  talked to me  offered to cook up one more tuna  and comped part of my bill. I found this very classy and considerate  and appreciate the gesture. My family was done with dinner and dining at this point  but of course I insisted on dessert to take away the bitter tone the meal had taken. The ancho fudge pie did rescue a lot.  In all  somewhere in the bottom of my birthday experiences. Won t be here to celebrate again  but I do appreciate the waiter and managers all trying to make it right to me. I think what Z needs is a menu shakeup  and to focus on what they used to do well- grilled fish  yummy enchiladas  and good apps. The 6th street location seems to be on a slow slide  and it makes me sad.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,254,Best margaritas in town hands down  Get the queso  guacamole  fajitas and quesadillas and you will leave that place fed and full  Thanks for the great service  valet parking and outdoor seating right next to the live band  This place is epic 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,255,My friends and I LOVE going to this place. There is UNLIMITED cornbread served in a cute little mini skillet which is oh so amazing.  I ve come here twice before and had the chicken fried chicken and diablo pasta. Both are DELICIOUS and I would definitely recommend both of them.   The ambiance at this Z Tejas is really warm and cozy so I definitely recommend groups of 4-6 for a night out. One small thing is that it almost feels like if you re a college student they pay slightly less attention to you  which I guess is expected since they probably won t get as much tip.  Overall  I m a big fan and I encourage you to eat as much cornbread as possible.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,256,Unfortunately Ztejas has gone down hill  way down hill  We use to love this place  it was definitely are goto restaurant for Mother s Day  when family was in town  etc. The menu has changed from inspiring to dull   what use to be fresh and flavorful  has morphed into overcooked   tasteless and over priced.    To the owners  What happened  to the best bloody marry buffet in Austin   Who decided to take the good food off the menu and replace it with over cooked  tasteless menus items.      ZTejas our family will miss you   On to better things
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,257,It doesn t get much better than the Fruzion margarita  the skillet cornbread  and the half-price appetizers at Z Tejas.  Even with some good outdoor seating  the waits can be long at this location. Don t worry. Just grab a Fruzion margarita. It s the very good house margarita with a fruit infused Patron floater. Absolutely addictive.  Dinner is great  too  but I m all about the happy hour here.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,258,Our first meal in Austin and it couldn t have been better. 2 adults and 3 kids for lunch. The waiter sat us in a private area and catered to our fussy  northern palates. The chicken on the chicken  amp  waffles was out of this world. Fajitas were more than enough for 2 meals and the tacos were served with plenty of fresh avocado. Delightful lunch and a nice welcome to Austin 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,259,Great for happy hour.  Good selection of appetizers and drinks.  We went around 5pm on a Thursday at got seated just fine.  We got about 4 appetizers.  The best bang for the buck were the catfish tacos.  They were delicious and you get a lot of food for only  5.  For drinks try the margarita sampler.  You get three  six ounce glasses of three different types of margs  each has a different type of liquor in the bottom  which was a nice touch.  So in total  you get 18 ounces of marg for the same price as a 10 ounce glass.  Parking is a little tough  but if you get there earlier in the happy hour  you should be OK.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,260,THE FREE CORNBREAD IS THE BEST PART.  Incredibly buttery  crisp at the edges  and fluffy in the middle. Definitely the highlight.   My main meal was the green chile enchiladas which were definitely on point. Tender juicy chicken and awesome rice and beans. Will definitely come again 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,261,Great place and ambience .Server gave very good recommendations. We flew in from Miami and were starving and found this place .Manager Brian made us feel right at home.Food and margaritas are A1..D Definitely A Must in Austin
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,262,Every item we ate was marvellous   The best was the Amazing shrimp and guacmole appetizer   I would highly recommend again
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,263,Z Tejas on 6th has become my girlfriend s and my favorite Tex-Mex spot for happy hour around Austin.  We average every other week for happy hour at this spot  and it never gets old.  A few reasons why include the happy hour menu  the strength of their drinks  and the vibe at the 6th street location.  --The 6th Street location has the best vibe and setup of the three Z Tejas locations I ve visited  other ones being Arboretum and off Parmer .  You can choose outside or inside  and the inside dining room has a nice back room and front room that are quieter and less bunched-up than the main dining room by the bar.  --The drinks are tasty  but most importantly  they are made strong.  You can get a lot of good drinks for cheap on their happy hour menu  but the best part is that they are made with a punch.  I don t mind spending good money on drinks as long as I feel it.  I ll pay  20 for a cocktail if it knocks me on my butt.  But nothing pisses me off more than ordering margaritas or other mixed drinks  and feeling like I just drank a virgin slurpee.  You won t find that at Z Tejas.  --The happy hour menu is great.  The Tejas Trio is a must.  The street tacos are outstanding  and the quesadillas are great.  They are all on heavy discount during happy hour  and if you order 3 appetizers between two people  you don t need to bother with an entree.  Ensure you ask for the corn bread as soon as you sit down   Hint  in case they ask you trivia about the corn bread  the secret ingredient is yogurt  which makes it the best corn bread I ve ever eaten  sorry  I m not from the deep south  but I did live in Mississippi once...   --The staff has always been great.  On the rare occasion that we do decide to split an entree in addition to the appetizers  they are kind enough to bring them out on two plates so that we don t have to share off one plate.    Overall  we ve had great experience after great experience  so I think you ll enjoy it as well.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,264,Great time as it was nice to sit outside after traveling from the east coast. Food is good but not great. Highlight is the table side made guacamole.    Plenty of others places that are better in Austin.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,265,Pleasant atmosphere  food is really good  hosted needed to smile more. Our server person was nice  pleasant to talk to   just wished this person checked on us a little bit more like our drinks were empty for longer than normal. And this location normally the servers bring out cornbread without having to ask for it. Great cornbread by the way. This time music level was just right.   Laid back  good music  great food  service better than average  then this is your place to enjoy
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,266,This was the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Austin and also my first  tex mex  experience  it remains one of my  Top 10  favorites  five years later.  This particular location offers an internal eclectic maze of rooms and an outdoor multi-level deck  offering the perfect place for either group parties or a lazy Sunday brunch-for-two. I have tried at least half the menu and have narrowed it down to three favorites  the wild mushroom enchiladas  three kinds of shrooms  avocado  tomatoes  and a delicious ancho mole cream sauce   the smoked chicken chile rellano  poblano pepper stuffed with chicken  pecans  apricots  raisins  and cheese  covered in a green chile cream sauce   and the Diablo pasta  red pepper and spinach linguine  jerk chicken  cotija cheese  jalapenos and a zesty sauce .  I m also quite fond of their prickly pear and the ginger pomegranate margaritas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,267,Z Tejas drew me in with its snazzy looking building  but for the price the food is unimpressive.  I had a seafood enchilada with black beans and rice. The beans and rice were bland and the enchilada was over spiced and topped with 2 over cooked shrimp.   I do like their drink selection and dips though. They have various   skinny   cocktails which I LOVE because if it s   skinny   I can eat all the chips I want and won t be bloated and irritable the next morning...umm  right  RIGHT   I think I ll just stick to appetizers and drinks next time.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,268,I hadn t been to Z Tejas in probably 3  years  which I realize was a big mistake. My sister-in-law suggested a lunch here so that we could spend time together along with my baby nephew. The experience was absolutely fantastic - from the moment we walked in the door  the manager  the hostess  our server  all were genuinely friendly and accommodating. The manager even came and chatted with us and the baby at our table  making us feel welcome. The food was very tasty - I highly recommend the 5-cheese Mac with Achiote Chicken.  I had a hard time choosing from all the options   Guess I ll have to go back very soon to try the rest 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,269,The food was great  My boyfriend and I both got salads. Mine was good but his was amazing  I got a wedge salad with steak. He got the Grilled Ruby Trout salad but with grilled salmon instead of trout. It was very light and refreshing. We also got the Tejas Trio appetizer and it was really good. I would recommend it.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,270,I could go back to Z Tejas again and again   It s perfect for any occasion  a dinner date  a night out with the girls  or even a business cocktail reception   My favorite menu item is the Red Chile and Mango Steak Salad  and the queso and strawberry margaritas are also amazing 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,271,Had a terrible experience at this restaurant. Service was slow  one of my fellow diners received his entree only to realize after sampling it that it wasn t what he ordered. My boyfriend and I both got the street tacos and the meet was gummy and stringy and I literally couldn t chew most of it  I had to spit it in my napkin  not cute  . When the waitress came to clear our plates she noticed we had barely finished half and when we told her we both thought the tacos were not good she had both removed from our ticket. I thought that was very nice  but not enough to make me ever want to return.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,272,I ordered the seafood enchiladas for dinner. I thought their food is pretty bland. Their food is incredibly heavy for some reason however. The food didn t have a lot of spices or flavor  and overpriced. I ended up paying  40 for just two people. We both ended up feeling a bit sick afterwards too. I d recommend Chuy s if you re looking for tex-mex that is more affordable with much better food.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,273,I came back to Austin and this use to be THE happy hour destination so we went back after not being there for 5-6 years  was total shit  the happy hour specials use to be SOOO good and now they aren t worth it at all  paid  30  each for 2 beers and a couple apps. Food quality wasn t as good either and now they charge you for the amazing cornbread. Was so bummed as this use to be one of my favorites  no reason to go back now. Apparently they changed ownership and everything sucks now  total bummer.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,274,Best Mexican food  The spice is on point. We loved the food  drinks and atmostphere  The patio is also dog friendly which was great because our dog travels everywhere with us  Great experience and great service 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,275,Repeat offender...of greatness   5 of us enjoyed a wonderful evening at Z  Tejas. The place was packed and we were seated in a quiet corner. Our waitress was more than attentive and my margarita showed up promptly after I ordered it. Frozen love in a glass baby. But that s no comparison to the amazing Chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin. Fantastic flavor and just the right amount of food. This dish is a must have and one I ll be sure to try and duplicate at home. Chorizo  peppers and cheese filled the tenderloin which was covered in a cream sauce. Yummy   Thank you Z  Tejas for a great evening. I ll be back
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,276,I just ate here once again with one of my girl friends.  I ordered the wild mushroom enchiladas.  They were delicious.  It is very creamy and loaded with mushrooms and avocado  right up my alley.  It s a filling  yet seemingly nutritious meal.  Our waitress was super nice.  I got  10 off my meal since it was my BDay yesterday and I am part of their email club.  Not only that  but the waitress offered me a free dessert.  I chose the fudge pie which I brought home to my hubby.  The restaurant is very cute and filled with light.  They have a nice patio  but because of the heat we sat indoors.  I liked that I was not freezing sitting inside.  A lot of restaurants keep it Arctic indoors.  It might have been because I was sitting near the patio door and would get occasional gusts of hot air on my back.  Anyways  I like the atmosphere and the temp.  All 3 times I have been here  the service has been stellar.  I would definitely recommend sticking to Tex-Mex when ordering.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,277,I used to frequent this place as a great happy hour  but fast forward 10 years and it s really gone down hill.  The interior still stinks of dirty tables and urine  the right side of the joint   happy hour has been collapsed to basically nothing  4 drinks options and 3 food items   the prices have jumped sky-high   12 guacamole    and I sat at my table for 11 minutes before any waiter decided to greet me.  Awesome.  And so I left.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,278,TLDR  Rude head staff but was made up for by Andrew   Z tejas overall has mixed reviews. At first when our party of 12 came in after going on the pubcrawler which is right down the street  the staff told us that our reservation was not in their system and we would have to go elsewhere. I then showed them my phone with the multiple phone calls to their location when I made the reservation 3 weeks ago. I called multiple times to confirm it was the 6th street location because I saw they had other locations  and the woman on the phone said yes it was the location on 6th when I asked 3 times. Finally the staff believed me and decided they would  see what they could do  and seated us at two tables pushed together  which they told us was available only until the reservation at 8 30 was coming  at which time we would have to leave. We were waited on by Andrew who was very kind and took care of all of our needs. The food was delicious and prompt  When the food came out  the manager came to remind us that we only had until 8 30 to eat  it was 7 50 at this point  and at the rate we inhaled the queso  I don t think they had to worry about us taking a long time to eat . He said  so just don t do your 5 minute snap chat videos  make them 30 seconds.  Personally  I wouldn t mind a 10 or 15 minute reminder for the next reservation coming in  but to tell us right when our food came out  and not even when all the plates were served   felt unnecessary and rude. They also didn t offer us any dessert menus or ask if we needed anything else. They simply gave us all checks and expected us to leave. If someone is truly apologetic for THEIR mistake of not having our reservation  I of course wouldn t mind leaving when another party came in. But if instead they choose to rudely remind us multiple times that we shouldn t make ourselves comfortable and don t offer dessert or time to ourselves but instead rush us out  it doesn t leave a good taste in my mouth.  If it weren t for this  I would ve said the restaurant was perfect. Great food  excellent wait staff   Amdrew   delicious drinks... but apparently no matter how far your plan ahead or double check your reservation is at the right place  Z tejas won t care and will make sure they get you out so  as the manager told us   they don t get yelled at by people who  actually  made a reservation. 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,279,Went Saturday night for a bday dinner.  Really awkward bad service.  Long long wait between table touches.  Drinks went oddly awry.  Thank goodness for the triple dip app.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,280,I can t believe this is my first time coming here   What an awesome grill  We went here on Sunday during their brunch  and started with the guacamole. Or Table-side Guacamole  which is literally made to order right before your eyes. The a truce was great  I never needed to ask for a refill  and my Achiote Chicken Salad was the salad I ve been waiting for. My friends Chicken Burrito  although enormous  was also delish. FREE CORNBREAD TOO  Why not   Definitely coming back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,281,Hard not to like Z Tejas. The menu is large and choices for everyone - I like that they have a fit lower calories choice if I m feeling particularly healthy some day.   The street tacos are as good as everyone raves. And on Mondays they have a great happy hour  live music in the back bar  and tacos for  2- 3 each. You can try all four different kinds and rack up a bill of less than  10.   The music is a hit or miss-- we particularly enjoy a younger girl that comes with her older guitarist. They sing acoustic version of the 90s songs and sing-along is more than welcome.   I would highly suggest the downtown location if you are having family or work company out to dinner. It s a little taste of Austin without throwing them to drastic levels.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,282,I love the food here and have loved it for 27 years.  However  i am a delivery driver for Uber.  I am always pleasant and courteous whenever I come to this restaurant because I am trying to be quick and efficient.  I am always directed to the bar to wait.  I don t mind waiting  that s part of the gig.  What I DO mind is being treated rudely by the staff  especially the bartenders.  The least they could do is offer me a water.  What they don t realize is that I have been a regular  paying customer at ZTejas since before they probably knew how to tie their own shoes.  Cut the pretentious millennial attitude and learn how to treat your customers  including the folks like me who are delivering your product.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,283,THE CORNBREAD - you have to ask for it sometimes...delicious  Last time I got the chicken fried rib eye...every time i see the word ribeye i associate it with delicious.  however  the chicken fried version of it wasn t that good.  I think anything that has a  Z  is good.  My friend got the  Z Gets Fresh  and my other friends got the mushroom enchiladas and both liked their dishes.  Note to self  don t try to order a steak  much less chicken fried steak  at a texmex restaurant.  It was kind of pricey  but overall pretty delicious
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,284,For a place that is relatively upscale  I must say I was somewhat disappointed with what I got.  The place itself  at least where we was sitting  did not have that modern feel  or even same level of detail as say the bar or the ball room.  Just very meh.  I came here with a lot of people  but we didn t really see our waiter much either  especially after we got our food.  So much for even water refills.  We also ordered a lot of food  queso  guac and salsa to start.  Queso was nothing too special  but was pretty velvety.  Guac was fresh as was the salsa  and chips came out warm.  Cornbread also had an excellent texture to it.  I ordered the Pan Fried Snapper  which was okay but fairly overwhelmed by the pesto  so I couldn t really taste anything else  which is sad because I couldn t taste the freshness of the fish or even tell that it was crab on top of the fillet.  Didn t help the fish was a little dry too.  Its an ok place  lots of interesting options  but with the price you pay and the food you get  could do better  could do worse.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,285,Very much enjoyed my mushroom enchilada. Our whole table was happy with their food. Not the usual inexpensive Mexican food. A bit on the pricie side for lunch but a good treat. My margarita was good. Nice atmosphere and friendly service.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,286,I really liked the ambience of this restaurant  it was clean  the service was great and welcoming.  I went with a group of friends from church during 4th of July weekend  and I ordered the Red Chile Mango Salad w  beef tips.   It was DELICIOUS and it became an instant favorite of mine     The dressing was so unique and flavorful   I highly recommend it   So now  this location and dish has soared onto my must-eat-list in Austin   Yum  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,287,Food was ok the waiter was rushing us to order main course as he kept saying it s busy not this past Saturday night   2100 hours   Trout good and tacos margaritas weak
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,288,Michael Petty our server was fantastic. Wonderful service and very attentive to our group.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,289,Maybe good folks in Austin just have terribly low standards but this place ain t work 4 stars. The bar is flat out terrible. And I don t think the friendliest food inspector  in their right mind  would pass this place.  Food isn t the worst. It s really the bar. So if you re here for dinner  you ll pass the low tex-Mex bar. Otherwise  it s a total waste. And to think  they operate in an expensive neighborhood. Seems to me they ve been enjoying the revenues  but not returning the favor with high quality food and drink.  Won t be back. Especially when there are such better places in Austin.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,290,Born and raised in Austin. Z Tejas never disappoints  Have to get the corn bread.  Mary is excellent and super entertaining and knows how to pour a mean drink  She rocks my world and .... I m gay.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,291,3.5 stars rounded to 4 for great service.  Tried the Santa Fe Enchilas and a Flight of Margaritas  3 .  My friend had the Chicken and Avacodo Sandwich.  Also tried the tableside Guacamole.  Everything was solid but nothing really blew us away  the Guacamole was probably the highlight     They have a nice mix of indoor   outdoor seating and the place seems great for a date night.  Would love to check out the music some other night.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,292,Second time to Z Tejas for business lunches and find it s my go-to spot in Austin  far enough away and quick enough with perfect food to have everyone agree to the agenda   The cornbread tasty - I love the small skillet and the crispiness around the edges - sharing is the only issue among co-workers.  I had the seafood enchiladas - not as good as last time when I had a special fish taco  but still wonderful.  Coworkers had the steak burrito and the steak salad - both were delicious.  Wait staff was fantastic - reconfiguring our table for additional people and patient when we were waiting for our driver - the only issue is parking - tough at lunch time to find a spot.  Looking forward to visit number three 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,293,Excellent service amazing food.  Sebastian was our waiter and he did a awesome job    Would come back any time.   Thank you for the wonderful food and experience.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,294,Yummy table side guacamole  Yummy corn bread  Strong  5 happy margaritas...what s not to love about that combo 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,295,Uh so so overall. The food was good but the service was not great. They forgot one of our drinks and my burrito wasn t made correctly.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,296,So my boyfriend and I came here recently and requested to sit outside because it was quieter. It was about 7 on a Friday  so it wasn t too hot. We ordered our drinks and food  and about 30 minutes into our visit I noticed how itchy I was. We were sitting in a swarm of mosquitos. After eating our food  we got home and noticed that we had been completely torn up. I emailed the restaurant and they never responded. Not a good dining experience for me at all.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,297,I love this place.  I have gone here off and on over the years and have never been let down.  This time I swear we got the best waitress in AUSTIN.  Did you know there is a good waitperson in Austin   I didn t until I went here the last time.    Food - awesome Portion and value great Parking-difficult  Why was the wait person awesome   They did the usual but they would notice when you needed something and bring it without asking. Drink refills  an extra napkin  fresh utensils  and the list goes on.  It was seamless service that did not interrupt the flow of conversation.    I loved the experience.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,298,I was visiting Austin  Texas for a few days and my friend and I went to Z Tejas  downtown location . I loved this place  I wish we had more authentic Mexican places like this in Minneapolis. Although  maybe I just haven t been to any good ones. I would like to find a place like this in MN.  I had the Smoked Chicken Chile Relleno. A stuffed Pablano pepper with chicken  spicy cheeses  raisins  apricots  pecans  drenched in a picante cream chile sauce. Oh my goodness it was magnificent  I wish I had taken a photo of this masterpiece. The presentation of their food is amazing. The lunch came with delectable warm cornbread and butter. I left extremely pleased  and we had enough cornbread to take back to my hotel. Made for a very good breakfast  with coffee.  I heard it was a super fun place to be at night  but we only went for lunch so I guess I will have to go back to Austin sometime soon 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,299,Average TexMex fare in an average restaurant vibe. Solid good food but nothing special.  The free cornbread they give you is really delicious and was a great start to our meal.  I had the green chile barbacoa enchiladas. The shredded beef was really good but the sauce and overall flavor was a bit disappointing and bland.  I will definitely find a less corporate chain place next time I m in town.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,300,Maybe the worst in Austin  definitely not worth the money.  They put sugar in their salsa.  The margs were from concentrate or at least tasted like it. The sea ench were  16  a small portion  I think the fish was salmon-which is just bonkers for ench filling  sauce was uninspired  and were just plain bland. They dont even have refried beans. This is Texas  why waste your time with out of tune Cali-mex. We wont be back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,301,I have been regularly dining at this place since around 1998.  I loved their strong coffee  fresh baked banana nut muffins and smoked trout salad.  I would always bring out of town guests here for this totally laid back Austin experience.  Let s fast forward to 2020.  There has been a change of ownership and everything tastes different.  The coffee has a very strong floral note-which may be your thing but I prefer a more traditional Italian roast.  The muffins are no longer crusty on the outside and soft on the inside-seems to be the recipe changed.  The dressing on the trout salad was overpowered by the vinegar.  I couldn t even finish it. My dining companion ordered simple pancakes.  They had absolutely no taste-I ve eaten better at a church pancake breakfast.  Both the waitress and manager were extremely attentive and apologetic. The manager also went to the trouble to make up an additional salad for me to take home-hence the three star review so I applaud their professionalism and positive attitude.  Unfortunately  I don t plan to return.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,302,Living in Austin  I get a lot of visitors. I always make sure to show them Z Tejas for the perfect  upscale tex mex experience.   The complimentary cornbread is surreal. Also don t leave this place without ordering the Tejas trio  guac  queso and salsa...Yum  Beware though. You might be too full before you even get your entree  At this point  I ve started taking my guests here for the appetizers alone 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,303,Proof that Texas is the most friendly place in the universe--couldn t decide what local beer to get and out of nowhere two excellent beers arrive courtesy of the table next to us.  Seems they know beer and love to share   It was a wonderful local couple.  How flippin  nice     I could eat Tex Mex every meal  but I love it when some place mixes it up a little.  I had the pasta.  It was really good.  Appetizers were okay.  I had a flight of frozen margaritas after my beer ran out.  It s a cute idea  but a poorly conceived one.  Tiny glasses of frozen stuff become tiny glasses of melty stuff really fast in Texas.  They tasted super strong in their melty state.  Service was good.  Free valet is always a plus.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,304,We have been here several times and we love to people watch on the patio. The food is just ok. It s hit or miss really. The drinks are very good  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,305,I am a vegetarian.  The cornbread was amazing  couldn t have enough of it   I tried the mushroom enchilada - the sauce was perfect. The dish had a side of beans  rice and chopped mango.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,306,Z Tejas was fine.  We walked way too far to get here for it to disappoint  Service was terrific food seemed healthy and fresh  and my green chile pork appetizer  that I got as my main  was YUM.  But it just wasn t what I was hoping for in terms of an Austin experience.  After all  this is a chain and the food is similar to what I can get in Atlanta at TexMex restaurants.  It just wasn t that unique or special  especially for the wait that we had or for our awkward seating on top of a large birthday party  sigh .  Head to 2nd street or Rainey street for a fun night out in Austin 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,307,The food was good not amazing but still tasty and the service was very attentive and welcoming. I wouldn t mind coming here again.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,308,Solid food  but nothing particularly special. Great selection of drinks though  Next time  I would definitely come back during happy hour. The table-side guacamole was excellent.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,309,Ate here the other night with a friend and was once again wow ed  Amazing food   I had the crispy salmon which was served with an amazing chilled garnish of something  sorry don t remember . A glass of La Crema Sonoma 2007 and a blackberry apple cobbler to finish the meal.  So good that I wanted to go back in time and re-eat the meal   Oh and let s not forget the cornbread. I hate cornbread but this particularly variation is excellent  if a tad sweet for my tastes.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,310,So it has been awhile since we visited Z Tejas.  We used to love this place and it was one of the first places we ate when we moved to Austin 11 years ago.  In fact one of my favorite desserts I have ever had was at this location.  Tonight we had dinner with 4 of our friends  6 people total  and it was a disaster.  One of our party ordered Nachos without sour cream.  The waiter came by and explained sour cream was added by mistake so they were rushing out new nachos.  We were about 1 2 done eating by the time her replacement nachos came out.  No offer for anything while she waited except for chips.  Ok this is fine I wouldn t normally ding a restaurant for this because I personally don t expect to be comped when something happens.  My wife ended up with a hair in her food.  She was starving so she cut out that part of her food and ate the rest because they had already messed up the nachos and the waiter took forever to come back.  So we didn t say anything because we were enjoying the company of our friends.  Then the final straw was the waiter enticed me with a  chocolate cheesecake with raspberry sauce .  I love chocolate and raspberry and I knew my favorite dessert was a cheesecake from Z tejas so I figured I would order it.  So then when the dessert came out the waiter stood there with a slice of cheesecake awkwardly and told me it wasn t really a chocolate cheesecake but a prickly pear cheesecake.   Then he asked if I would like to try it and I thought he was honestly offering it to me for free.  I said I would try it and would even be willing to pay half.  Then he said  Oh I would have to talk to a manager about that.   I thought I was being nice because I thought he was giving it to me for free.  No he was offering for me to try it at full price.  Usually waiters should come to the table and tell you that there was a mistake and offer something else if the dish you ordered was not available not bring you the wrong dish and offer for you to try it for full price.  Then after this awkward exchange he said he would go see if the manager would comp the cheesecake for me.  He then comes back after I had 2 bites and said  If you eat it you have to pay full price for it.  Do you want me to take it away from you or not .  Being with friends and not wanting to be awkward I offered to pay for it.  I also mentioned for reference that my wife s food also had a hair in it. And he said  Oh I could have comped that if you would have told me earlier.   I didn t say anything else.  The cheesecake was ok but if I was offered it as what it was I would have never ordered it.  Then on the way home my wife told me that she didn t even think the waiter talked to the manager.  She said he went and stood at the top of the stairs for awhile scratching his head and then came back to the table.  I couldn t see as I was facing outside and she was facing the restaurant.  I have to say this was the worst display at a restaurant I have ever seen.   We won t be back.  On top of all that the food wasn t that great as we remembered times past so no reason to come back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,311,I liked this place  but I m not sure if it completely deserves all the hype. There s a great deal of seating  and a lot of it is outdoors. The building itself is a converted Victorian house  which is pretty cool. The menu for both food and drinks is extensive and a bit intimidating. We stuck with appetizers to narrow our choices  and we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was a 50  off appetizers happy hour. I had a hankering for a margarita  but I had a hard time choosing one of these as well. Plus  it seemed like the  fresh lime juice  was coming from the  Sun Orchard  and our waiter  while friendly  could have been more knowledgeable.   We had the bottomless chips  which come with chile con queso  guacamole  and salsa  the chile pork verde  and the Leo s Street Tacos. The tacos were my favorite  as they came Mexico-city style and with great presentation. Even so  nothing wowed me.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,312,I ve been a fan for years. This last trip was bad. We were a group of 6. 1. There was a long hair on the side of one of the plates... Not in the food  bust still gross. We did not send it back. Just pushed through. It wasn t in the food.. 2. They got the order wrong on one of the dishes. When it finally arrived we were halfway through with our meal. 3. 3 people mentioned that the food was bland  needing spices. They all had something different. 4. The waiter pitched the desserts and someone in our group ordered something. When he brought it out he explained how it wasn t what we ordered. So the guy who ordered offer to buy it at half the price  invade he didn t like it. The waiter leaves the dish  and goes back to the manger   then comes back  my buddy is already eating it at this point  and says that he can take it now and not charge him or he has to pay full price... After that the waiter never came back to fill up water or coffee. 5. The waiter charged us twice for the nachos that didn t come out till midway through the meal. We had him correct the bill.  This was just the worst I ve ever had at z tejas.  Maybe he was a new waiter  Maybe they got new management or something. But it wasn t worth the money this time.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,313,Second time in town  both times I ate at Z Tejas. It must be a family favorite and I can see why. This last time we went for bunch and man was it good. Mimosas were spot on and do they give you a ton of food or what     Entree with fruit salad and a huge muffin. Too bad they give those to you first and then you get what you ordered with barely enough of an appetite left.  My advice  come hungry  leave satisfied.   Waiters were very attentive  split our bill no problem. Prices for brunch cocktails were crazy cheap and the food - delicious 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,314,I ll preface this review by letting you know we went w   group of 24  so I know that s tough for any restaurant to handle.   The ambience   Nice  Indoor outdoor seating w  trees to provide a little shade on a sunny day.  Staff  Our waiter was amazing. He ran himself to the bone teying to accommodate our every request because his female sidekick...well  she just didn t add much help.  Food  Appetizers were good  especially the trio and the shrimp tostadas. Most people from the group said the food was just ok w  a couple even commenting their veggies were cold.   If you re in the mood for Tex Mex  you probably won t be disappointed.  I just think there were better restaurants in Austin.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,315,Absolute garbage is there any way to leave no stars wouldn t recommend this place to my dog......
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,316,it s a BIG place but CROWDED.  We went around 7 30pm on a thursday and we waited for at least 30 minutes for a table of 6.  the food was worth the wait.  our waitress was amazingly efficient and attentive.  the mojitos are great.  We got the trio of dips - salsa  guac  and queso.  yum. the fresh cornbread is amazing - with bits of corn in it.  the grilled shrimp tostatas were cute.  i had the seafood enchilada which had plenty of seafood without tasting too fishy.  it s tex mex at its best - not too greasy or heavy - just flavorful and fresh.  great atmosphere too.  maybe when it cools down  we can eat outside...  UPDATE - had the brunch there.  Amazing apple bran muffins - pieces of raisin  carrots  and apples - warm and sweat with a hint of spice. yum  the breakfast quesadilla was good but the chicken hash dish was awesome.  the table side guac is a must and the pancakes were yummy too.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,317,This is literally my second review ever and I highly recommend that if you are a minority DO NOT COME HERE  Never ever dealt with such racism in my life. All the workers were staring  pointing  and laughing at us. Extremely unprofessional service. The manager himself accused me of giving my younger brother alcohol even though I didn t. They were very adamant that I did  basically calling me a liar.  The food was good but not worth the humiliation.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,318,Wow. This restaurant has really declined in every way possible. The service was painfully slow. At 2 00 pm the restaurant was nearly empty  but it took 2 hours to get street tacos  3 salads and 4 kids meals  The food was okay. They now charge for the cornbread too. Do yourself a favor and go to Jack Allen s instead.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,319,What a find  We did not want to wait an hour for a seat and just happened by Z and scored a parking spot- hard to find in this area. We had awesome seats on the patio and the manager was quick to fire up the heaters to make sure we were comfy. The food is so delicious- we had the breakfast relleno  farmer s market skillet and chicken fried steak. Everyone was delighted with their food- the staff is great and we will DEFINITELY be back soon 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,320,5 star service tonight  Shout out to Cliff on the patio for perfectly splitting our salad and entree s. They have turned a corner from a service standpoint.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,321,I first dined   z tejas in 1997  when I worked for WFM.  I moved to south Florida and every year when I return to visit family  I always make it a point to go there for one of my meals.  The eclectic charm have given way to a more grown-up  well-run dining establishment.  The consistency of the food offerings is what I like most about this place.    I ve dined at their other location on Jollyville but much prefer this 6th street location.  There is a lot of natural light if you dine inside  the ambiance is very  Austin   I ve tired most of their appetizers  but the standout is the grilled shrimp tostada bites.  The cornbread is also a big hit--I always have to remind myself to not consume too much as to miss out on my entree  I have tried a wide variety of the entrees over the years  and you can t go wrong with any of their chicken or fish dish.  I am not really a big cheese bean lover  but I once tried their chili Rellenos and damn....I couldn t believe how much I loved my dish.  They can still pleasantly surprise my taste buds after all these years...and why I always come back.  Today  I took my dad for a Father s Day brunch  and had CLIFF as our server.  I eat out quite often  so obviously exposure to all kinds of folks who tend our tables.  And I have never had such great attention to the details of our dining experience. Example  I had an order of sweet potato fries to go with my burger.  I was brought out regular fries.  I wasn t gonna have a hissy fit about it and ruin the wonderful time w my parents  so I continued my meal.  Cliff then brought out a plate of sweet potato fries a few minutes later without any prompting.  Before he gave us the bill  he made sure my dad got the promo bonus gift card that they were giving away. Z Tejas executes the  little things  well  that includes hiring the right people.  It is a shame that diners have been reduced to expecting so little  but when everything comes together perfectly  like today s meal  it inspired me to highlight those that made it possible.  Thank you  ztejas and thank you Cliff.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,322,I came here with my Dad and sister when they were visiting from New England and helping me move from Arlington to Austin. I did the Fun Bar and was pumped to find out the Bloody Mary bar included slim jims. The ztejas benedict was SO good - but I was told it would be spicy so I got the hollandaise on the side and substituted regular bacon. I loved it. Our shrimp tostada appetizer was also delicious - loved the slaw in the middle. And  the complimentary banana nut muffin and fruit is a great touch at brunch  I will be bringing other guests here.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,323,Place is awful   It is run down and dirty looking. My plate was supposed to be white but was so old and stained   My food was cold and dried out. It felt like it had sat for a long while  Like before I ordered it  Don t go  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,324,Use the valet parking  We were also happy to discover they have mosquito spray for the asking.. Never a bad meal and very understanding on gluten free issues
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,325,This place was awesome -- can t believe I never went the four years I lived in Austin.  Probably all the reviews will say this  but that cornbread -- it s divine. I probably ate an entire loaf on my own. They serve it in the iron-cast skillet it was baked in. It comes out warm and fresh with seasoned butter. It s just the perfect combination that enhances your southwestern experience and hits the spot before a meal. Don t overeat though  which is easy to do since it s that good  otherwise you won t finish your entree that you order   I got the wild mushroom enchiladas. Here s the menu description  Roasted crimini and portobello mushrooms with avocado mango relish rolled into corn tortillas  finished with ancho-mole cream sauce  Jack cheese and sour cream.  The avocado mango relish is on the side  not really rolled into the corn tortillas  but the bite of freshness is nice next to the heavier ancho-mole cream sauce and mushrooms. There may have been too much going on the plate  but nonetheless  it made sense and all was delicious. Unfortunately I was so full from the corn bread that I only ate one of my two enchiladas  but that just means I ll know better for next time.   Though I came for dinner  I d love to go for lunch and sit out on the patio. This place is huge and fits hella people.   Service was exceptional  aside from the fact that I had to get up to pick up my own silverware  but we were the last to leave on a Friday night late dinner  so I will let that little detail slide this time.  Too yummy  I want some right now. Next time I m in Austin  I would love to come back to this place 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,326,To put it simply  I love Z Tejas   The complimentary valet parking  the wild mushroom enchiladas  and the kickass cornbread always makes this one of my go-to restaurants in Austin.   Z Tejas is great for business lunches  birthday dinners  and date nights   Seriously order the wild mushroom enchiladas- holy moly yum  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,327,Don t get the tenderloin with chorizo if you have a sensitive stomach  The chorizo is undercooked and that s just the way they cook it. Only get it if you can handle under cooked meat. They tried cooking it twice for my gf and it came out the same both times.   My Parmesan crusted chicken salad was soooo good. The night manager and or owner was very understanding and nice. He took care of our entire bill which we did not expect for the chorizo inconvenience and bought my gf a steak. Our waitress was soo sweet. Great atmosphere and professional service.   Thank you cant wait to go on a sunny day for brunch    
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,328,A waiter that didn t care cold fish sloppy food placement a bad manager... Needless to say this place was terrible
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,329,I don t know why this place is rated well.  I went in for dinner on Sunday around 6pm.   Atmosphere  amp  Overall service   restaurant  1. There were not many customers  but still there were many waitresses and waiters.  2. Tables were tightly arranged  so those servers hit my arms whenever they passed by. 3. Table was dirty  window  floor  ceilings  every possible areas you can see in the restaurant were dirty. Oh  restroom was relatively clean compared to the dining hall. 4. dirty silverwares and napkins. My napkin had footprint in it. 5. Our server was nice  but she was slow 6. music inside. I don t know if it is appropriate to play loud Britney Spears  Crazy at Tex-mex restaurant. where most of customers were grandparents.    Food  1. Complimentary cornbread was the only thing we liked. 2. Diablo pasta with Shrimp  mediocre taste  3. Portobello Enchilada  Good to Ok. it was small compared to the price. 4. Price range is high  Conclusion   I m not going back. I can get better tex-mex at better price at some other places.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,330,We came here for my sisters birthday before we headed out on the town. First we sat on the patio and it was so hot it was miserable. We had to ask for the chips and salsa which was strange. Our food came and my fajita chicken was a little dry but it was okay. But the WORST part of our experience here was the rats and cockroaches running around our feet the entire time. PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,331,Love this place.   Just had the best service ever.   Ryanne was amazing.   Friendly  knowledgable.   Great enthusiasm.   She was over the top.   Food was great.   All four people cleared their plates.   Delicious.     The only reason I give it a 3 star instead of five... The girl that ran our food had a skirt so short I got to see what color panties she was wearing.   And her her was down to her waist.  Not pulled back.   I noticed her several times playing with it.  Brushing it with her fingers.   Disgusting.   Pull that hair back.   Yes... Her hair is beautiful.   But you are in the industry.  You need to pull it up.   And I never want to see the color panties you are wearing.   Save that for the club.     I ll be back..... And definitely requesting ryanne.   Amazing server 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,332,The reason for the one star review is to reflect my utter disappointment and complete shock when I found out that Z took their two best items off of the menu  maybe the two best items completely since being bought out. To the new owners  it s great that you came in and saved Z  but to take off the seared tuna and dumplings because they re too asian inspired is a huge oversight on what your loyal customer base wants. I have been eating at Z for over 20 years. I have celebrated many important milestones in my life here. The FIP margaritata  now not called that  is the best marg in town. Sadly  unless the new owners add back the tuna and dumplings I will no longer have Z as one of my staple go-to s.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,333,Went there for a business meeting. Food was great and our waiter Scotty was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu which helped make our experience even better.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,334,Right off the bat the hostesses took forever to sit us  It wasn t that busy. A tall gentleman saw the struggle and confusion between the 3 hostesses so he said we could be seated in his section. It was quite pleasant the greeting  He made us feel quite welcomed  Especially because it was a group night out after not seeing each other in a while.   He recommended the surf  amp  turf and all 3 of us got it. Southwestern grill it is  Delicious  fine steak and salmon. He has a fine taste in food. And our drinks  Never less than halfway empty before he swooped in to get it refilled.   He never neglected us during the time we were there  and we stayed for a while because again  my friends and I were catching up.   Nice smile  Nice attitude for it to have been so close to closing time. Absolutely coming again for that surf and turf and for the server  john carlos. Great idea to come here.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,335,Stopped by for a late lunch and found the place almost empty. Opted for a table on the patio so we could enjoy the pleasant fall weather. The waiter was prompt  nice and gave us appropriate amount of attention.   My wife and I split the Green Chile Pork nachos. Excellent dish and very large portion. This plus the complimentary corn bread was all we needed. We each had a margarita  which was okay but served in a small glass and was over priced.   Overall a good experience.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,336,Place is okay. Food is mediocre.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,337,Friendly staff and very good food. Live entertainment was enjoyable. Believe they have live entertainment on a consistent basis. Try the grilled shrimp tostadas and the mushroom enchiladas. You won t be disappointed.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,338,Great service at the bar. Steak fajitas were ok. Small portions and I had to ask for more. Too much peppers and onions and not nearly enough meat. Bartenders were hopping and gave excellent service. It got busy quickly. I recommend getting there early.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,339,GREAT margaritas  food and service   We wish we would have found this place earlier than the last day of our trip 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,340,The menu has a deep bench of choices for all tastes and diets.  I would compare them to Hyde Park Bar and Grill.  American and Tex Mex.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,341,I have not been here in years for brunch and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I especially loved the Mimosa and bloody Mary bar that they had set up. You could have them make it or you can make it yourself with different toppings. The brunch menu had a nice variety of options as well.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,342,First of all  it is almost impossible to find a decent place to eat accompanied with great waitstaff. When we came here we were greeted and taken to seats of our choosing. We had a 3 year old with us and he is nothing short of straight up picky. But no matter the request we flew at our waiter  shout out to Michael P.  he without hesitation helped with everything we needed. Turning the ambiance music down  when he forgot to bring muffins he brought back more than plenty  and plus some to-go    and the icing on the cake... Z-Tejas does not have toast and jam.. Which was what our 3 yr old wanted  and to our major surprise  he went back and found some Texas toast and honey. MAGIC MIKE HOST. To everything you did for us and showing your kind hospitality we Thank You  Looking forward to our next visit for sure  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,343,I took dear friends for a special 91st Birthday lunch.  I called the day before to get lunch reservations and requested that we receive catfish beignet and their wonderful skillet cornbread immediately upon being seated. They delivered in spades   Everything was perfect  As always  the catfish beignets were Delicious  The skillet cornbread was Amazing as well.  We thoroughly enjoyed the  ruby red trout salad as well as the tortilla soup. All wonderfully prepared.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,344,Street tacos were amazing  chill atmosphere  nachos  amp  chips were meh... But still a fun place to hang out and do brunch 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,345,My friends and I are visiting Austin and this place was recommended by a friend. We started with the trio of gauc  queso  and salsa that on top of the homemade cornbread had us full before our meals even came out  but when the food finally did come out- my mushroom enchiladas were in true Texas jargon  dank . My friend got a chicken and avocado sandwich and was also a big fan  we also both liked the  5 Margaritas. There were so many choices on the menu I really had trouble deciding but there is a wide range for the picky and the adventurous eater 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,346,This place used to be good. It s the equivalent of a Chili s now  maybe worse as I don t eat at Chili s. The food is low quality and the margaritas were bad. There are great places in Austin for Tex-Mex and Z Tejas is not one of them. It s hard to make food this mediocre but they ve succeeded. I don t expect they ll be around much longer. Completely dead last Saturday when we are there at peak time.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,347,Don t get me wrong  I love Z Tejas his food  and have been coming to both the six Street and Arboretum location s  for years and years  it things seem to be changing.   At the 6th St location my favorite  there s no more live music  and they appear to have closed the  annex  bar altogether  and this once really busy downtown restaurant and bar seems more dead than alive these days in terms of crowds I ve heard a number of regulars complain about the same  and they seem to be going elsewhere as well.   Again  the food is super although the new owners  Cornbread Ventures I believe  have already begun removing some of the  in my opinion  most noteworthy Z Tejas offerings  notably the Ahi Tuna.  There s also no more live music in their annex bar  which featured known groups like The Brew  Blue Mist  and others.   It seems to me that the management could make a fortune if they marketed their live music offerings properly.   I miss Z Tejas
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,348,This place had such potential  but was overall a let down. Very overpriced for the portion of food you get. The taste is also nothing to write home about. It seems like this place would be really trendy and have awesome tex mex. Unfortunately  it misses that mark.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,349,Visiting Austin and wanted Tex-mex. found this place on google and gave it a shot.  Delicious food  well prepared in a fun inviting atmosphere with really great staff. Would return if I lived here 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,350,Solid Tex-Mex showing with some character for ambiance. Our group ordered the trio for an appetizer and received queso  guacamole  and salsa. The salsa was average but the queso and quac were very good. I ordered a seasonal fish special that came with rice and beans  it was very flavorful and I was pleased. I also tried my friend s Mac  amp  Cheese with chicken and although it wasn t the best I ve ever had  my Wisconsin roots have set the bar very high in this category   it was some of the best I ve had in Austin. Lastly  I felt compelled to try my friend s Smoked Chicken Chile Relleno because it sounded so different-- it was awesome. Very unique flavor combo which included both raisins and apricots cooked with the meat.  To top it all off they offer unlimited fresh baked cornbread which was delish   Parking was a little annoying and probably even worse on the weekend  but this place is definitely worth checking out.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,351,Holy guacamole  Z Tejas knows how to make killer guac and their Cast-Iron Skillet Fresh Fruit Cobbler is worth every single calorie. I ve traveled all over the country and this is one of my all time favorite desserts.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,352,Went for lunch today.  Got the Enchilada and tortilla soup combo and it was a good price and pretty tasty.  Didn t get a drink  but they looked good.  I will definitely go back  wanting to try the happy hour and the Sunday brunch  I ve heard good things 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,353,Four stars  I would go back preferentially   I ve always heard of Z Tejas as a fine dining place  and it does have that feel and taste.  What I didn t know is that Z Tejas is way more affordable than the sorts of places around town that serve good food in this ambiance.  I ll be baaaaack...  Friend from San Antonio was in town  and I met her at Z Tejas for dinner desserts.  She d had the tortilla soup there already  and I d already eaten dinner  but I figured dessert would be a good option.  I noshed on the chips  Bottomless Basket  amp  Three Salsas  while my friend finished her dinner.  Good salsas.   5 good   Well  good enough  let s just say.  We ordered the ancho fudge pie and the fruit cobbler  listed as the  cast-iron skillet fresh fruit cobbler.   True to reputation  the fudge pie was super chocolatey and delicious  although I confess I could not taste the ancho chile in the pie.   Moar spice needed  the spice must flow.   The fruit cobbler was indeed served in a mini-cast iron skillet  which almost made me paranoid about scraping every last bit of it off with some if I didn t want to ingest lots of metal.  I did taste the bourbon ginger caramel sauce  and the ice cream was awesome.  Think of an upscaled Kerbey Lane or Magnolia s with a more Mexican flavor  and you ll get Z Tejas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,354,After visiting the graffiti wall we looked for the closest Mexican restaurant because I was craving a cold margarita and queso. We walked less than a half a mile to Trejos and got great queso and great service. Michael was an excellent server and knowledgeable about the menu and nearby area. He was very kind and did great with up-selling to the top margarita and adding on guacamole. Randy  the manager  personally came and sat down at our table and said hello. He sat with us for ten minutes while we talked about our trip to Austin along with baseball pastimes as it was during the World Series.  I d definitely recommend coming here for lunch or drinks. Wonderful service.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,355,I m very satisfied at all the good this location has to offer. The food is beyond my expectations and the price is just right. They could use a little more customer service but it s ok. The location feels very like at home 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,356,I was at z tejas three weeks ago and noticed that the fish is not fresh and has a really bad taste. A week ago I went back with a party of 10 and the food was worse. I ve been sick now for 4 day and my mom was sick on day and a friend of ours was sick for two day.  The food here is not fresh.  This is one restaurant that does not care to feed anyone that is a foodie. This is only a place to have drinks.  Do not eat here.  The food is not fresh.   They used to be a good restaurant.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,357,I have been dreaming of the guacamole for the last two months since I went here. The drinks  cornbread  and fajitas were good. But the guacamole was AMAZING  A bit of the beaten track but totally worth it 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,358,This used to be our go to place to eat in Austin but  it s lost its struggling to provide a customer-oriented experience.  We made reservations for a table outside and were told that outside was actually only first-come  first-serve.  So we were placed in a room with two large parties.  My family of four could not even talk due to the noise.  My daughter stared crying bc the noise was making her head hurt.  I finally went back to the hostess stand and was emphatic my reservation for an outdoor table was honoured.  They finally placed us at a decent  outdoor table.  We ordered table side guacamole  which generally means they make the guacamole at the table .  Instead  we were offered some chopped avocado with Tabasco  jalape o and cheese that we could add.  The waitstaff seemed confused when i asked for salt  lime and pico so I could make the guacamole myself.  The waitstaff finally got a little more with the program as the meal progressed.  Even still  it will be a while until I return.  We left while one of the hostesses gave us an unbreaking  expressionless stare.  I felt like saying    look  I never complain and try to make whatever situation I am handed work but  this was pretty unworkable .
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,359,I came here for brunch the other day with some friends at the 6th street location. They have a make your own bloody mary and mimosa bar  amp  they re very generous with the champagne  thank ya very much  I COULD NOT decide what I wanted to order  but the waiter suggested the chorizo pork scramble skillet  amp  it was absolutely delicious. It was so much food that not only was it my brunch but it was also my dinner  amp  snack. My friends ordered the Z eggs  the breakfast quesadilla  and the typical migas--all of which looked super good. We arrived early  around 10  but when we were leaving there was a huge line  so I d suggest arriving early. All in all  it was a good brunch  amp  I m willing to try it again.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,360,On the fence and not sure which side I will fall on. The interior is a little quirky and quite cold on this brisk day due to the old glass windows. The menu had a number of choices but when you start removing large groups like hamburgers  salads and various enchiladas it gets much smaller.  We started with chips  queso  salsa and guacamole. It was all good. The guacamole was very fresh and done properly. The salsa was good but could have used a litter more acid and heat. Queso was good but the chips were a little thick for me.  Mains were chicken fried steak and short rib enchiladas. CFS was decent but was too thin so the meat was cooked well done.  The batter was also sliding off from the bottom. The enchiladas were interesting but the mushrooms could have been left out and the mole sauce was unusually thick like a paste. We both opted for cauliflower mash that was a plus.  Prices were ok except beverages  tea  2.95 fairly watery and Miler light  3.95.  All in all I am at 3.5 and need to flip a coin. Ok heads it is and Z Tejas  gets a 3. Will probably go back but not in a hurry.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,361,This place is a notch above most Mexican options in Austin. Best Chilli Relleno I ve ever had  The complimentary corn bread is delicious and a nice alternative to chips and salsa.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,362,We had late reservations - close to closing time - and we were a bit late to get there  but they were happy to host us anyway and prepared to have us later than closing. Their service was exceptional. Food was exquisite. Highly recommend.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,363,Food and service are always amazing.  The decor feels casually private.  Sit outside if it s nice out 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,364,I used to love this place  but felt a bit disappointed tonight. They sat us in that weird part of the restaurant to the right which I have never liked.  They could really use fixing that part of the restaurant up.  As soon as we sat down I noticed that my bread plate had a wad of food stuck to the bottom of it. Instant gross out factor for me  Then I noticed that they started charging for the cornbread which really didn t bother me since it was only three dollars and the proceeds go to charity. However  the cornbread was cold and left a lot to be desired. I remember the days when it would come out piping hot and the butter would melt upon contact. Sigh   My husband ordered the fajitas. To be fair he has a pretty strict diet and nixed the tortillas and cheese  but the meat and vegetable portion was skimpy at best. His beans were served 1 2 full  but the waitress was nice enough to get him another side. I ordered the Santa Fe enchiladas  which seems to be consistently excellent. We  like some of the other reviews  were upset to see the ahi tuna go. In general  Z Tejas needs to step it back up. In general  the old school ambiance and appeal was not there. We probably won t be back for awhile based on tonight.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,365,Nice vibe and food just needs a touch more pride in the food and service. My sandwich was good once I removed the bitter white lettuce. My waiter did not seem to mind even after I told him. There was at least 3 pieces so it really wasn t good.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,366,Hooray for corn bread   I love this location of Z Tejas. It just seems so Austin inside. It feels local  and I like that. The menu has some tasty dishes  and if it has catfish in it  just order it  catfish beignets  WHAT   . The margaritas are pretty good  and the service is good too. It s a little pricier than I would like  but it s sort of downtown  so it s appropriate.  Try the cobbler.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,367,One of my highlights of a recent trip to Austin - the Chili Rellenos was amazing - and nothing like I d ever had before  most delicious  For an appetizer I had shrimp on avocado on little crisps - forget what it s called  but quite good as well. This is a for sure meal on my next trip back 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,368,Great fresh good with excellent service  We stopped here on a Sunday afternoon and I had the shrimp guac tostado bites for app and wild mushroom enchiladas for entree and both were amazing
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,369,Visiting Austin on a business trip  we decided to try this restaurant following an advice from somebody local. This was a great experience from start to finish. The mahi mahi was delicious. Even the chips and salsa were above average. The service was also perfect  fast  personable. The margaritas were also very good. I would definitely come back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,370,Great margaritas and very friendly attentive bartender  Autumn . Definitely coming back for lunch 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,371,We had large family group of 15  service was okay  but food way below par. Shrimp tacos not very good and seafood enchiladas had small amounts of seafood and soupy cheese sauce. left there still hungry  only reason I didn t sent enchiladas back was that we had to get to a child s musical performance. Never again  rls  houston
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,372,Of all three locations  this is my favorite because it has that true Austin feel. I ve been here many  many times  but finally made if for brunch on Saturday. The bloody mary s and mimosas are  3.50  ask for spicy-much better--I tried 2 spicy and 1 regular to make sure . Spicy bloody mary s  not spicy mimosas. Although that might be good too.  Tara M. s description of Z s food as Nuevo Mex is right on because this is the only place I have found that serves enchiladas  New Mexico style. They re flat  not rolled  chicken with red chile sauce and served with an over-easy egg on top. Mouth-watering.  Perfect brunch.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,373,Another one of these places where I m always surprised that it s taken me so long to stop back in  the dessert lover and I hit Z Tejas last night for some Sunday night cocktails  if you ve not been... go  for those..they ve brought in experts  some appetizers  and a little good cheer on the local veranda.  The menu combinations of Tex-Mex staples and a moderately refined approach to Americana dining seem to weigh well with locals  and it s not unusual to approach a crowd upon entry.  Worth mentioning that there are a couple of choke points regarding the way this place is laid out  one right by the front door and one on the way to the restrooms  so they re especially noticeable   so come prepared to be patient while in the way of others. But otherwise  easygoing bands in the bar across the walkway  at least this night   great dining out in the open in two areas  and a kind of Spanish-inflected easy intimacy throughout by virtue of it s Austin victorian home setting. A relaxing  largely satisfying stop.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,374,My attempt to eat healthy and also squeeze into a special occasion outfit this weekend may actually come to pass.  The menu at Z Tejas features three items that are less than 550 calories.  I had the marinated chicken served with a nopalito salad  grilled asparagus  cauliflower  zucchini and tomato.  My pomegranate green tea was refreshing with zero calories.    Me  I ve never had nopalitos.  What do they taste like  Server    with full and complete authority and knowledge  They taste a little like a french fry but crispier. Me   Okay.  Uh. No. They taste nothing like a french fry   I think they taste like a limp green chili.  I thoroughly enjoyed them  however  in the spicy salad  more like a salsa  served atop my chicken breast.    The interior of this special restaurant is subtle and downplayed in the simple art  wood chairs and tables.  I love the fact that the owners have kept much of the Old Austin charm in this original Victorian home.  Because of the rain  we sat inside but I m a fan of sitting at a table under one of the umbrellas on the front deck.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,375,Dear Z Tejas    I am very sorry that my friend passed out on your floor.  She really hadn t had anything to drink.  I m serious.  I am very sorry that my friend destroyed your bathroom and puked everywhere.  I feel bad for the girl that was in the other stall and for the employee who had to clean it up.  We swear  she didn t have the bird flu.  I am very sorry you had to call the paramedics.  Personally  if I were her  I would have had my butt carried out on a stretcher to show that I was seriously ill.  She was seriously ill but her pride was a bit wounded.  I hope you understand.   I am sorry we caused such a commotion but I think it was the puke you really care about.  You guys were very understanding.  We appreciate it.  I m pretty sure she s never coming back again though  simply from embarrassment.    My mac and cheese was awesome  by the way  as always.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,376,Good food  very good margaritas  great patio on a nice night.  Our service was frequent  though our server must have been brand new. The wait for the patio was very short  and it s a great spot to eat.  I had the Diablo pasta with blackened chicken and jalape o cream sauce. It was very good  though not life changing. We also had the queso trio which was a good starter.  If they didn t have the patios  this would be 3 stars all day... the patio definitely made the meal.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,377,Z Tejas has been a favorite of mine for many  many years.   I ll just say it once. Again. For the 100th time. And no more. But maybe the next time I go.... Bring back the Navajo Taco    For real   But since that didn t happen this last time  I ll say that once again Z Tejas did not disappoint. Once again  delicious. I made reservations for myself and mom and my step-dad for our  Christmas  dinner.  They live out of the country and that s what mom wanted .  We got right in.   I usually get delicious margaritas  but the three of us shared a bottle of wine. Don t remember what it was  but it was tasty  although a bit warmer than it should have been.  I think I got the winning dish of the table  the pan-fried snapper. It was topped with crab meat and cream cilantro something.  can t go wrong there  . Mom got the crispy salmon  but ordered green beans later on  since the fish was all she had on her plate. I had the beans on my plate--they were delicious and crispy. My step-dad got some sort of meat  although I didn t pay much attention  honestly. He did love the mashed potatoes  though.  For dessert  we shared the never-let-me-down Fudge Ancho Pie  or whatever it s called  . It s always delicious. Always scrumptious. Tonight was no exception.  You pretty much HAVE to try this if you haven t already.  I ve never been disappointed by a meal here  and I ve been here for brunch  for lunch  and for dinner. The wait staff is very pleasant  the decor is nice  the food is wonderful.  It was a very nice place for a family dinner--not too terribly fancy  but no Casa Garcia  either   Oh  and P.S. I miss the Navajo Taco 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,378,Does food turn you on   If the answer is no you should stop reading immediately and get your next meal from Taco Bell.    If the answer is yes  your going to love Z Tejas. This place is truly as unique as Austin itself.  From the Hand Pulled Pork Nachos to the Ginger Pomegranate Margarita  all things Z Tejas Rock.    The service is great  all my previous waiters have always known exactly what to recommend and have had top shelf knowledge of all the ingredients and sides to every dish. I don t look at the menu too much  I simply ask what they like and I will usually go for that.  Last time I was there I had the Fish Taco App  and Stuffed Pork Tenderloin.  It was freaking amazing.  One of my home girls absolutely loves the Skyy Cherry Limeade. I m a huge fan of the Z Top shelf.   I recommend the Ahi Tuna  Tortilla Soup  Red Chile Mango Salad and the Blackened Catfish Enchiladas.    Ya know  I think I m gonna have to go tonight.  UPDATE  So I did go last night 8 15 2008  and was a little disappointed.  At the bar with a friend and I got skipped over a good 5 times before being told we would be helped after the bartender made a  couple more drinks.  Also  we waited about 20 minutes to pay our bill.  I was almost to the point where I was going to get up and have the manager take care of it.  Besides that everything was great.  And some friends from another table bought us a round of shots  so that s always nice.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,379,A friend was in from out of town and wanted Tex-Mex. Another friend and I both wanted something not quite as caloric...Z Tejas was our compromise. All the taste  with a few more options on the healthy end of the spectrum.  Extra points to our excellent waiter...not only did he keep the olives coming  almost as fast as the drinks  but he politely ignored the very serious conversations going on around the table while still catering to our every whim in the most unobtrusive way.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,380,What a great happy hour spot  All the appetizers were half off  and the margaritas were  1 off from 4-7pm. My friends and I met here around 5pm on a Thursday  we found nearby parking easily and got a table immediately. The building is an old house that has wood floors  bright but not garish colors  and unique art. Everything felt very cozy but still open  casual but very cute.  I think it would make a good spot for a date. The weather was mild  so we opted to sit on the patio  which I found comfortable and appealing. There s plenty of natural light  but the space is designed well enough that people won t get sun in their eyes.  Our server recommended a Chambord margarita  which was definitely above average.  But personally  I was happy with the regular house frozen margarita  which was about  1 cheaper. The drinks were good sized for the price  around  5-6   and they had just the right amout of kick.  The handmade guacamole was mild but fresh and delicious  and the portion could have easily been shared among 4 people. The pulled pork nachos were also wonderful.  The pork was moist and well seasoned  and the chips were substantial enough to hold a lot of  toppings. Again  the portion was reasonable  since the 3 of us shared it and didn t end up wanting dinner.    My only complaint is how long we waited for our bill.  I think our server forgot us or went home.  We sat there a LONG time after our drinks and food were all gone.  Despite that little glitch  I d definitely go back to Z Tejas for happy hour or a date sometime.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,381,Last Sunday was a gorgeous day. It was mid 60 s  a perfect sunny January day and DH  dear husband  and I set off to have something to cure our mild hangovers and sit outside and drink beers.   Z Tejas on 6th was perfect. Yes  the crowd was mostly hung over sorority girls with big chanel sunglasses and frat boys with their hats on backwards... so I can see during the off school times this place could be even cooler with more people over 25 in attendance.  DH had the pork enchiladas that were awesome and I had an amazing chicken avocado sandwich. Mine came with fries and they were great. His enchiladas were really more like a really messy stewed pork taco you had to eat with silverware. Also  the chips were really warm and fresh and the variety of salsas that came with were a nice change from the usual slopped together salsa business at most tex-mex places. Yum 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,382,Z Tejas is special only with regard to the fact that nothing is bad. It seems to be well run  seems to have good service  ingredients are freshish  and the atmosphere is comfortable  and perhaps interesting if you re quite bored .  Nothing can be described as  inspired.  There s just nothing that s new  and there s nothing that s amazing.  If you re hungry  you want to be satisfied  and you don t want to risk a bad experience  Z Tejas is a good  safe bet.   Bonus star for serving breakfast tacos at dinner  if you ask  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,383,Two Sundays in a row where I ve rolled myself out of bed and into the world of brunch  granted last week there was a run . I d eaten dinners and gone to happy hours at this location in the past and always remembered having a pretty good time plus this location is a skip and a hop away from the casa. Wait time was minimal  weather was almost perfect  the company fantastic.  I ordered the Z eggs  two sunny side up eggs  home fries  pancake  for  5.49 which is a hell of a steal if you ask me. Simple  delicious. The huevos rancheros looked yummy  and the pasta dish   who doesn t get breakfast food at brunch    looked equally yummy. I m also tipping my hat to their margaritas as there  myself excluded since I decided to get a Coors s light. What   It tastes good sometimes......  were a variety on the table and they were a perfect balance of tequila and flavoring.   So why four stars  My bloody mary was bloody sad. On the plus side I got a a double for free thanks to an error in my favor behind the bar  but it tasted like V8 mixed with vodka and a dash of pepper. No pickled veggies  not even a piece of celery. Bloody marys are at least 36  of a brunch experience in my experience  so I hope that this was an isolated occurrence as I plan on going back in the future.   Sigh     Time to go run off all of the nom-nom.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,384,Met for a girls lunch. It was delicious as always  The food  the service  the friends made for a perfect day 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,385,Everything  is  bigger in Texas  I am quickly finding out. After reading the reviews on yelp  I decided to walk from the Intercontinental down 6th St to the restaurant for a late lunch after a long flight. I thought to myself  it s only 12 blocks  how far can that be   Well  30 minutes and a dozen loooonnngggg blocks later in 100  degree heat  but it s a  dry  heat  whatever    I arrived fairly panting and the shaded patio and welcoming cool air conditioned interior of Z Tejas grill was a very welcoming site.  My server responded right away and promptly brought me a huge glass of ice water and I ordered some chorizo con queso and chips to nosh on. Wow  delicious and bubbling hot queso in a cast iron skillet  but the portion was ample enough for a table of 4.  I asked  his opinion on the macaroni and cheese with chicken and after a very positive recommendation  I decided on this as my entree. It was fantastic  A large shallow bowl of housemade macaroni and 5 cheeses including a blue variety for a bit of tanginess topped with some bacon specked breadcrumbs and 4 pieces of clear  beautiful grilled ancho dusted chicken breasts made for a very memorable dish  and I am a macaroni and cheese conoisseur   I didn t expect this  but the server also brought out a piping hot cast iron skillet of the most delicious cornbread I have ever tasted  tender and spongy moist bread studded with fresh corn kernels and served with a delicately flavored whipped honey butter. I should have taken the rest of this to go and noshed on it tonight for dinner  it was so delicious.  Great experience for both food and service and a perfect welcome to Austin s great food scene  Can t wait to go back for Happy Hour and enjoy a margarita or two next time...
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,386,They put raisins and pecans in the CHILE RELLENO.  Horrifyingly delicious  that s all I can say.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,387,Me and my girls are trying out the hottest happy hours every wednesday...  and for this Wassup Wit it Wednesdays....we have a winner    1 for the complimentary valet - super nice in the headache that is 6th street.  I ve been dying to go to Z Tejas after reading all the great reviews  especially of the margaritas  We each ordered a different Margarita. I had the superfruit and it was so delicious it made me wanna slap my momma. At first I was wary because it came with a sorry little shaker but it made a good 3 glasses. They are good at masking up the too-kill-ya taste especially since me and patron have never been friends. nor jose cuervo... me and him just don t get along.  We ordered Blackened Catfish Tacos  Catfish Beignets  Spinach and Mushroom Quesadilla  and Shrimp and Guacamole nachos. Everything was delicious. Cat fish  got my tongue leaving me speechless and moaning like the herbal essences girl after a ginger-pomegranate-blackberry-acai-cucumber shower.  oooh and that cornbread... don t get me started. It s so soft and delicious and the asian in me makes sing hallelujah because it s free.  Would be a much happier happy hour if the prices were better. The appetizer prices were great but the drinks were still pricey for this college holla fo a dolla balla on a budget.

Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,389,Dear waiter  I don t know if you re aware of this but when I request a  house margarita  that s code for  bring me some margarita mix with a splash of cheap tequila.  What I received was the most amazing concoction of tart booze that has touched my lips to date. I m very upset now and slightly tipsy  therefore I will be overtipping you. THANKS.  But seriously  it was that good. The food was wonderful too. Next time I want to eat dinner in the lounge  because whoever sings on Tuesday nights is fantastic 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,390,I went here for brunch today with my mom  my brother and sister in law  and the boyfriend. I was hoping it would be awesome- the Z Tejas back home in So Cal is classy and elegant.  The interior is adorable  and I frankly love the change from fancy upscale to comfy tex-mex with bright interiors.  The food and service were just kind of meh. We all started with double mimosas- these were fabulous. Mommy like.  We ordered our brunch- it took awhile for our server to get to us. He forgot all of our muffins and fruit and we ended up receiving them after our food. By  them  I mean we got five muffins but only one tiny cup of fruit. I m pretty sure that s not the way it was supposed to go.  Boyfriend got the migas  decent  nothing special  and I got the relleno with scrambled eggs. It was alright  if you don t want to taste anything but smothered cream sauce. I gave most of mine away and ate a muffin- not really my plan. Mom had the chicken flat top enchiladas  which were fair to middling by her description. The chili con queso and chips were the only other thing that were stand alone good.  For brunch  i would try someplace else. I m sure this place is better for dinner.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,391,Z Tejas was a go-to restaurant when I was in college. It was fun and casual  with a great patio and an even better brunch. Now  it s a chain restaurant desperately trying to differentiate itself from the myriad of other Sysco outposts in town by giving things an  Austin  twist. The result is another mediocre  Southwestern  chain that s only a step above Chili s  but with much less revenue and patronage.  In the race to expansion  the menu has been dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. Good dishes like the red snapper have been replaced by the likes of grilled miso salmon  a first-year culinary student dish if there ever was one. Migas are gluey and served with gummy flour tortillas. Muffins were rock hard  and the skillet cornbread was soft and pillowy  with no hint of a carmelized crust. Even holdover signatures like the shrimp and guacamole tostadas have morphed into unrecognizable  poorly-seasoned versions of their former selves. The service has suffered as well  our server s attitude was as lackluster as the iced tea he served me.  Like most good chain menus nowadays  vegetarian and gluten-free options are clearly demarcated for those with dietary restrictions. Also  the patio remains one of the best in Austin. My recommendation  Go for happy hour but skip everything else.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,392,Z Tejas is an awesome restaurant. The specials are always good  but you can t go wrong w much there. Monday night  including Christmas Eve  has half off bottles of wine  yes please  Not to mention you can take it home if you don t finish it. I had the Southwest skillet with seafood and it was pretty spicy but delicious. The meatloaf was also pretty good  but a little over cooked. Salads are amazing as well. It s nice there is so much seating  which really cuts down on wait time  which is much appreciated. We sat outside by the heaters in Winter and there was no one else out there so it was quiet and no children yelling and we loved it  They only take reservations for one of the rooms  which again  cuts down on wait time for walk-ins. Also  you can call ahead  which is also a plus in Austin. Will definitely be back  and most likely on another Monday  Beth  our server was great too  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,393,HAPPY HOUR   HALF-PRICE APPETIZERS   Get yourself the Tejas Trio of chips  guacamole  queso and salsa. They have surprisingly delicious queso. Next  if you feel ready  get the seared sesame tuna. It s warm and red in the middle  with a millimeter of smoked and seasoned crust on the outside. I think I could eat about 5 orders of this. The rest of the appetizers look fine  but we have yet to stray from our winning combo.  2 beers  one margarita  two huge apps --  25 at happy hour  Done.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,394,VEGAN REVIEW  Z Tejas has been a staple of Austin cuisine forever.  We have been enjoying their food long before we became vegan. Changing our diet was not going to stop us from continuing to enjoy their restaurant--so we thought.   This is one place that has made the effort to include vegetarian and vegan options on their menu. For this I applaud you. They have even marked them with a fancy  V  to make it easy to see what few choices there are for us  Yes  I m being snarky already . I DO appreciate the effort. I DON T appreciate the execution.   All they really did was remove the cheese and chicken from their normal dish and called it vegan. Or  like the dish I ordered today--Veggie Platter--which was nothing more than a few different veggies grilled with a walnut dressing on top. For  12    This is by far the least creative Vegan dish I have ever had. And this  coming from an extremely creative restaurant.   I have struggled with this review because of such fond memories shared with so many different friends. I have eaten at all three locations in Austin... birthday parties at the loud and lively Arboretum location  drinks and appetizers after a round of golf at the Avery Ranch location and many Sunday afternoons of brunch on the 6th street location s front porch. We even wanted to have our wedding rehearsal dinner in their 6th street party room  already booked .  I guess there is nothing more to say really. The good news is  they have options for vegans. The bad news is  they are boring  tasteless and overpriced.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,395,Great food  great service  great people  I had the steak burrito which was awesome  though I wasn t a huge fan of their rice  and the pork verde appetizer which was also incredible. The bartenders and the manager  Andy  were super cool and nice to me and I ll definitely be going back there and bringing people with me  
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,396,We went to Z Tejas after hearing so much about it after living in Austin 20   years but I doubt we ll ever be back. We opted for the complimentary valet parking perk and were excited to see such a service. After a meal where the service was slow for every table in our section and food that didn t live up to expectations  we got back into our car to see the low gas light on.   When the car was dropped off  it had at least a half tank of gas left in it  if not more . The estimated range for the amount of gas left in the tank when we got the car back was 9 miles. The gas cap on the car is such that it can only be opened via a lever on the inside of the car  rather than popped open from the outside. This means  even if the valets were not  in on  the gas siphoning  they left the car unlocked in the valet lot while we were dining. In some sense  we re lucky gas was the only thing missing when we got the car back.   When we called Z Tejas after discovering what had happened to notify them  we were met with a hostile response. Even though the only point of the call was to notify management of what occurred so that they could protect future patrons  we were met with hostility and a manager who refused to take any amount of responsibility for what happened while we dined.   In sum  we lost at least  20 of gas while eating sub-par food from slow service and were met with hostility after trying to notify management for their own good. The food and service may be just an opinion of mine that others don t share. Regardless  I would warn any future diners of their cars being left unlocked while they dine if they choose to use the complimentary valets. It may just end up the most expensive complimentary service there is.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,397,I had a reservation but there was a short wait to sit outside  a Wednesday night  bout 7  - instead the waitress recommneded the  side bar  which is a seat-yourself area off to the  aptly named  side from the main area. There was a bar there with a band  but you could sit out on the porch. Neat cuz you could overlook the other patio  scope the valet  and hear just enough of the live band coming through the doors.  So there are a billion drinks to choose from  I went with the mandarin margarita and was so pleased I didn t stray the rest of the night. Started with apps and could have eaten all of them. Got the shrimp n pork dumplings seared in a cast iron pan - wow. These round dumplings  nice crisp thin wrapping  came sizzling in their own juice.  Could eat all of them for a meal. Got another appetizer cuz I couldn t resist  the shrimp and guac mini tostadas. Yum  I would come by here again and again just for a great drink and an app   For dinner went with the pork wrapped in pork  chorizo-stuffed pork tenderloin  which was fantastic. The focus is really on the chorizo - the pork loin wrapping was pretty thin.  Just a heads up if you only wanted a  hint  of chorizo. The mashed potatoes were perfect as were the steamed green beans. At first I thought it was expensive for the portion size   15   but the quality makes up for it.   A special note for gals  anywhere outside has wooden planks that are spaced pretty far apart - I wore heeled sandals and about ate sh-t in front of my date several times  and I only had two margs . There was also the one time I stood up and was stuck in the floor. Awesome. Wear wedges or flats.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,398,Thoroughly enjoyed my meal with coworkers at Z Tejas.  The freshly baked cornbread was delicious and I would definitely recommend giving it a try  I was scared it would fill me up but my baked seafood enchiladas were so delicious I finished every bite .  One of my coworkers is VERY celiac so she often has trouble eating out... the tiniest morsal of wheat will put her out for a whole day. She had no trouble here and said the gluten-free enchiladas she ordered were  absolutely delicious   For photos  Check out my ZapVM review   a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.zapvm.com 2Fzap 2F6B80D6E54C7306D46303 amp s c0d4ec8cdf371235a7f95192f17c4d3324650395f0a1c6b230da1fb810991f8f  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  zapvm.com zap 6B80D6E54C   a 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,399,3 1 2 stars really.  Atmosphere a little like a carnival. If you can sit outside  it s pretty charming  and W 6th street is not noisy like you would think.  Service - competent but rushed  iffy. If a bunch of guys sit down at a table  no need to start calling us  girlfriend  and assume that s charming. Seriously.  Food...hmmm. Catfish beignets are quite good  Catfish tacos not bad  can t remember much about entrees  which can t be good.  I always take out of towners here when I go blank  and it s never a roaring success.   Great location  however.... parking isn t awful  and they do valet.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,400,GREAT happy hour. Their Z Pepe margaritas are to die for- no mix  just good tequila  orange  agave  and lime  My mother loved the Grilled Shrimp Tostada bites  I loved the cornbread and Chili Pork Verde. We also got the chicken fajitas and the chicken and mushroom stack  incredible   5 margaritas and  3 off appetizers is a great deal.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,401,Seems in the last few years ztejas has had a lot of ownership changes. I found the recent visit my best in along time. The menu and selections are varied and reasonably priced. I had the Farmers Market dish served in a cast iron skillet and served with choice of orange or banana muffins and fruit  both much smaller portions than in the past but ok with me  I ordered a small stack of pancakes and by far they were the best I have eaten maybe ever. The special syrup was delicious as well. Service was nothing to brag about but not bad.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,402,I got the street tacos and my coworker got the enchilada plate. Her enchiladas were very very spicy  so mild palates beware. My street tacos were only OK. I wouldn t recommend this place for anyone visiting the area.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,403,I love this place   The food is consistently good and the drinks are tasty  although they could be a little stronger .  They have my favorite chile relleno in Austin  not breaded  thank you  and the texture and the flavors are just so delicious .  I m also a fan of the salad with the trout on it  their flash-fried spinach  melts in your mouth....mmmmmmm...   and those shrimp guacamole tostada bites.    The interior is Austin-funky  with hardwood floors and a rotating art selection.  It does tend to get a bit loud in the main dining rooms  so if you want to carry on a serious conversation or are dining with somebody soft-spoken  that might be an issue.  There is a catwalk between the main dining area and the separate house that contains a little bar music venue and a private dining area  and you can sit out there if the weather is nice and it s quieter.  There is also limited patio seating out front.    At peak times  there is a wait  and their parking lot  behind the restaurant  is tiny and a little treacherous.  I usually end up jockeying for a space on the street and often have to walk a couple of blocks.  Sign up for their e-mail list  and they ll send you a coupon for  10 off on a meal during your birth month.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,404,Z tejas got fresh with me  and I liked it.  Tex-Mex can turn out quite heavy and greasy which is great sometimes  but my experience at Z Tejas was more of the fresh and light variety  and that s a quality that will keep me coming back for more.  The grilled shrimp tostada app was delicious and the shrimp was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  We also split a salad- and z tejas split the plate for us which was very nice  and without charge  double nice .  It had avocado  corn  black beans  sunflower seeds  cheese and a nice vinagarette.  Neither of us wanted the bacon or meat in it so we got grilled shrimp instead- again  perfect.    The cornbread was an unexpected perk  and even though I m not from the south and don t have a soft spot in my heart for cornbread  I have to say this one was DELICIOUS.  Moist  warm  with corn kernels in it.    5 stars 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,405,Boring. That s what I have to say about Z Tejas. It s another one of those AustinLand  tm  places that everyone raves about that I just don t get. The food is boring and uninspired. It s too loud in there as well  and I don t like margaritas so they can t impress me with those either. Sucks to be them    The building itself seems to be going through some sort of identity crisis. There s that back porch thing  that front room to the left of the bar and the one to the right and honestly  I just don t see it all connecting. It all seems like an afterthought.   With so many other good choices in that same area  I d have to say skip Z Tejas and go with something else.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,406,I love the rambling tree house feel of this restaurant. If I could afford it  I would buy this place and turn it into my house. Except then I would also have to hire the staff to feed me their delicious meals.  I also love that they combined the following ingredients into one completely mind-blowing mouthgasm   Cheese. Lots of cheese. Muy different kinds of cheese. Chicken. Macaroni noodles. Jalapenos. Onions. BACON. Bread crumbs. Bell Peppers.  Holy crap. I may never be the same.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,407,First of all  they have complimentary valet  I did not know this and turned before Z Tejas in order to find street parking. Wise choice even so  as i didn t have ANY cash. I always tip complimentary valet guys something.   I think this is another one of those times where I just got the wrong entree for me. Trusted Yelpers are all giving 4 stars and I am certain if I went back I would find a 4 star entree.   Z Tejas  service was fantastic through the meal. We sat on the patio  which could probably use a tiny bit more light at night. Maybe a candle on the table would be helpful for my old man eyes.  The cornbread is sweet and soft. We received two refills on that   For an appetizer we ate the chips  salsa  guacamole and queso trio. Salsa was good. The other two were unfortunately average. I wonder if the table side guacamole is better  It usually is in other places.  I had the green chile barbacoa enchiladas and felt they were just too DRY. That s my chief complaint. They weren t saucy enchiladas. And that s probably unfair since this seems to be a Santa Fe Southwest inspired restaurant.   Wasn t crazy about finding a big cauliflower on top of it either. I like those  but not on enchiladas. Give them to me steamed   Shredded lettuce was also on top  which I don t mind. I love lettuce and lots of it  I just wish it was off to the side somewhere. The green chiles weren t very spicy to me at all. Black beans and rice were pretty good.  I ll be giving Z Tejas another shot but finding something else on the menu 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,408,Z Tejas is ideal if you are wanting something different. You won t find a plain burger or club sandwich here. What you will find is delicious pork medallions in raspberry sauce and the best damn mashed potatoes.   So  I like to come here when I want something a little out of the ordinary  and a really good margarita.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,409,I went here just a few days ago when I was making my way back to Houston  by stopping in Austin for a night  of course. I was about six of us and we came around 9 PM. so it was close to closing  but there was no attitude about that.   We sat out on the patio  which was very nice  well lit and plenty of fans. I got the chicken avocado sandwich. It was delicious  down to the bun  which seemed freshly made. It was not just topped with avocado  but packed with avocado on top  which in and of itself melts my heart  And to top the avocado off  they had some pico on it as well  yum yum  accompanied by some spicy mayo. Muy muy rico  I believe with sandwiches such as these ones  is the reason why gluttony was made a seven deadly sin  One of my friends ordered a burger  again delicious. I sampled it and you could tell that the meat was actually fresh and just complied into a patty in the kitchen  not taken out of the freezer and removed of a square wax paper that separates it from the other frozen pre-made patties.   Because I am still 20  I wasn t able to order one of their well known margaritas  but my sister and her friends were  all in all the majority ruled a double thumbs up in the taste and in the potency    If you are in the mood for something fresh  tasty  with the plus of a relaxed atmosphere I highly recommend Z Tejas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,410,This place is great  It has been a favorite of mine since I moved to Austin  the food is usually either hit or miss  but if you go for Brunch  the brunch is AMAZING  The homemade muffins  you get with every brunch order  are the best damn muffins you can get in Austin  Oh and if you happen to go for your birthday or someone else s  the cake brownie thing they serve is mind-blowing  I think it is made from mole sauce  Whatever the hell is in it  just get it   It s very true to Austin  you can go with a hangover in what you wore the night before or you can dress up  you won t feel out of place in the least  It s also a fun place to go to see and be seen  but not in the pretentious way at all  It is definitely a local favorite and on different occasions I have dined next to Lance Armstrong  Sheryl Crow  not while they were together   and Alanis Morisette. Imagine the surprise when my friends from out of town were sat next to Lance Armstrong  How much more  Austin  could it get 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,411,This place charges for chips and salsa   I mean free chips and salsa is the sign of a good meji place on my radar. First strike against z-tejas...though..I knew I was walking into a yuppie chain  it was kind of disappointing. Is this how they make themselves seem more upscale    Sure  the atmosphere is nice and it has all the tools to be a good after work or happy hour hang out spot  but the food is mediocre at best and the drinks were the same. They put a ton of ice in my cadillac margarita and the waitress screwed up my man s beer order the second time around. Had the smoked chicken chille relleno which tasted o.k.  but was kind of lukewarm in the middle. Underwhelmed by z-tejas all in all.  I guess just go here for the scene  not the food or value.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,412,This used to be a good atmosphere and solid food for years and years but our dinner today felt more like a Mexican Food diner with cheap seats  bad food and second rate service.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,413,I have been to both the Arboretum and 6Th street locations and both are consistently good.  This location is 6TH Street funky flip flop friendly.. I consider the food Neuvo Mex - not traditional Mex or Tex Mex..    The Catfish Tacos  Chile Relleno and Miso Salmon are excellent - flash fried spinach   moans of yummy pleasure.  If you work downtown this is the perfect place to wait out traffic over 1 2 price appetizers and discounted Margaritas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,414,My husband and I hosted a brunch here for 40-50 people this past Sunday the day after our wedding. Most of our guests were from out of town  including ourselves  and were enjoying the Texas hospitality all weekend. One of our guests  a white guy with an Asian girlfriend  approached the bar politely for a drink. The bartender happily obliged while referring to our friend as  Mr. Miyagi.  We didn t learn about this until the next day  as our friend didn t want to make a fuss or scene in the moment  and we let the manager know. She was appropriately horrified  but after speaking with the bartender in question  let us know that he assured her that no such comment was made. She is the only who is assured. Food is good but not good enough to overlook the incident.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,415,I have loved having dinner here with large groups and small groups  through Z Tejas seems to have a hard time coping with large parties. The chicken and artichoke stack is a crowd pleaser. The cornbread served in a skillet is delicious and when your server isn t too bogged down  it is wonderful how quickly they replace it.  This is in my top 10 for happy hours. The prices are fantastic  1 2 of appetizers   a lot of options  and the margiritas are tasty and reasonably priced for happy hour. Also  the service is great. The happy hour drawback and most places is the service. No one wants to pay much attention to you because you aren t paying enough. Not at Z Tejas. They are attentive and friendly.  I support local businesses  but when a chain provides a local-feel  great prices  and great service  you are going to choose what makes you happy and is easy on the wallet. It is quality quality quality at Z Tejas.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,416,Z Tejas is one of my fave spots in the ATX. This lovely  tree-shaded old house has been the scene of many a Chambord  margie throwdown  simply delicious  and a Texas Trio gobble-up for my beloved and myself  usually on a Saturday afternoon and usually followed by an art walk up and down the boulevard.   The ambiance is old-school Austin  what with the creaky hardwood floors and none-too-fancy yet extremely comfy chairs and tables. The food is always yum  and I m glad to see they re offering things like ahi tuna bites  scrumptious little perfectly seared and seasoned bites on small  crispy  round chips  served on a long  white plate. The queso is creamy  spicy and served with both blue corn and yellow tortilla chips. Love it.   Basically  everything here is fresh  service is great  margies are amazing  and I am a margarita snob  to say the least   and if you sit at the bar  I guarantee you re going to meet some characters worth having a conversation with  especially if we re there.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,417,Update  I ended up here last night around 5 00 and had the pleasure of enjoying their Happy Hour. From 4-7 it s  1 off margaritas and half price appetizers. We tried the catfish tacos and they were absolutely delicious. Soft flour tortillas and the perfect spicy sauce. Yum  My friend had the green pork verde enchiladas and they were surprisingly light  and the avocado salad sprinkled with feta with a real treat.   This remains such a good  reliable option.  I ve come here multiple times and I am never disappointed. Well  except for the waiting  which is torture to my impatient self  but it s always worth it.   I always start with the Tejas Trio. Queso  Guacamole  and salsa. 9 times out of 10  if a place has queso I m ordering it  but here it s truly delicious. I ve also had the shrimp and guacamole tostada bites  and they were definitely good but not  must have.     In terms of entrees  the Santa Fe Chicken Enchiladas are very good  but probably not as adventurous as you should get here. Try one of their specials or try the seafood. I remember the miso salmon being particularly delicious.   If you can manage the parking situation  this is great place to come and enjoy the patio  the strong margaritas and very  tasty food.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,418,Our last night living in Texas   We chose to have our last supper at Z Tejas with toasting with the best Margaritas in town   Always excellent food made with love and as always welcomed with a great staff and chill music  Tonight was extra special and the manager Shane and our server Bruce really made us tear up  We can t wait to make it back to Austin and chow down at Z Tejas  Truly a special place everyone must make a memory here   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,419,When I think of Austin  Z Tejas comes to mind.  Probably because it is one of my staple resturants.  I love that it is ok to come and hang out in your shorts and flip flops and nice enough to take a date.   That is just how Austin is and why its so great.  The food is consistantly good and interesting.  Not the usual tex-mex here.  The fish tacos are the best i have ever had.   I am not a big fan of fish  but I tried some when a friend ordered them and was instantly addicted.   Smokey catfish enchaladas  was equally as good.  For desert you should get the fudge pie.  I know it doesnt sound good   but it is their specialty.  You wont regret it.  The margaritas are all good.  I espcially like the jalapeno and strawberry.  They have a great brunch too.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,420,Happy hour deliciousness   Half-price appetizers and dollar off drinks.  No need to order entrees because appetizers are enough.  Love the shrimp quesadillas with the tasty scoop of guacamole on top   They are totally drool-worthy with big  fat  fresh shrimp and cheese slapped between two tortillas.  Seared ahi tuna was ok  a little small to fill you up by itself .  If you go to the Arboretum location  be sure to ask for some cast-iron skillet cornbread  not on the menu and not available at the 6th St location .  Also  very good apple cobbler and good mojitos too     Additional note  Oh  how I miss the apple cobbler so   Served sizzling hot  spiced just so  paired with a scoop of creamy cinnamon ice cream melting all over the apples...
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,421,Deliciousness  I forget how much I love this place until I actually sit down and taste the food     The skillet cornbread is amazing  as is the Tableside Guacamole  with pumpkin seeds .  I got the Green Chile Barbacoa Enchilidas--HEAVEN    My sister-in-law got the snapper topped with crab and it was like butter.   Also  no Z Tejas visit is complete without a Jalapeno Margarita  which I thoroughly enjoyed.   Thank you for making me look good to my out-of-town guests  Z Tejas 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,422,My friends and I have met here for birthday celebrations for many years  but our last visit was very disappointing. Delivered the wrong salad to the birthday honoree  and then it took almost 30 minutes to bring the right salad. It s a salad  How long could it take   Also  while they have a parking lot  valet parking was the only option. Won t be back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,423,Mr. Smidgens s GF wanted to get together with some old friends for a few drinks and some din din. We all concurred on ZTejas on W 6th.   We found parking on a Friday night at 7 30pm just a block away. So far so good. We walk into ZTejas and I go up to the hostess stand. Two young ladies are standing behind the stand talking about some friends party and what they were going to wear. I was staring at them in amazement because Mr. Smidgens is a 285lb man who can be very intimidating without his cute little fuzzy bear head on. They finally turned around to acknowledge me after a few minutes.  One girl just stared at me and the other one..the tiny brunette said hello. I said Hi...can I get a table for 4 please  She said  sure thing. FA or do you have a preference...I said FA.  So  okay not a great start. C mon ladies you are the face of the establishment. Acknowledge your customers that help pay your tiny little wage. I poop bigger than you     Sorry...I digress. We sit down at the bar and wait. They are not that busy. A steady flow of patrons but not slammed. A bartender turns around and looks at me. I smile and wait for him to approach. He throws down the traditional bev naps and we place our order. I figure a Z-Top shelf rita should calm me down. It did. Just a smidgen.  BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...WOW THAT WAS FAST   Time to settle the tab and take a seat.   Our wonderful friends show up shortly after we are seated outside under a patio heater to keep the nice chill at bay for the ladies. We ordered the bottomless basket of chips and three salsas. Always a good app to start with. After some lively conversations about some colorful sex acts.....Not sure how the discussion got started we place our entree orders.   I decided to go with the Gorgonzola NY strip..medium. The entrees came out muy rapido. I cut into the wonderful looking strip of meat and it s medium rare. I figure okay no biggie I bet it s still delicious...ehhhh. most of it was too marbled with chewy fat. I mean c mon I love a marbled steak that is cooked to perfection and the fat adds a flavor and melts into the savory flesh but this was just too chewy. I enjoyed about a 1 4 of that what seemed so promising steak  all of the delicious potato cake  and the tasty seasonal veg med.   Mr. smidgens has learned his lesson. Only order steaks at a steak house and stick to TEX-MEX at a TEX-MEX establishment. Shame on me.   Smooches
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,424,Still love this place - every time I go I love it just as much as the first time.  If you don t know what to get  well...I have a few favs  Patron Fruzan frozen margarita  Spinach  Chicken w goats cheese salad  seared ahi tuna  appetizer   and yummy yummy santa fe chicken enchiladas.  Also - I love how they switch out salsas every day - so if you get the salsa sampler you re always in for a new treat.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,425,Just the facts  Mam   this is  not Tex-Mex.  This is what I call  Honk-Mex   i.e. made by Honkeys  that s white folks like myself .  So  if you re craving Tex-Mex it s best to look elsewhere.  Under cooked  under salted  crunchy black beans and under cooked  under salted  crunchy rice.  Pico de gallo without the pico  guacamole without garlic  thick sub-par tortilla chips  and boring luke warm queso...  you get the picture.  Dumb down food for people that don t like too much flavor.  Surprisingly  Z Tejas comes with some built in attitude on the menu  vs. the service  which was excellent .  No cheese enchiladas  no pinto beans and  we don t have pickled jalapenos.   Unfortunately  the food didn t come out as lofty as the aspirations.  Margaritas were the typical let down  what is so hard about making a drink with three ingredients  .  The unwelcome trend of adding agave nectar to skimp on Cointreau was in full effect at Z Tejas.  So  if you ask for a real Margarita with no sweet  amp  sour or  um  agave nectar   it will come out with little Cointreau and the same amount of lime juice.  In other words  super tart and lacking balance  and I like  em tart  it s a tart drink .  And since the drink is so watered down you can t really taste any Tequila or Cointreau - it tastes like lime  amp  water.  To be fair  El Meson on South Lamar  one of my favorites  is guilty of the same trend.  Maybe I should type up a recipe for a Margarita and give it to the server   2oz silver agave tequilla  1oz Cointreau  1 whole lime.  Real rocket science in action.   Overall I would give this five stars in the  Yawn  department.  The best part was that they were open on New Year s Eve day.  I can t understand the excitement on this restaurant  including the Fearless Critic .
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,426,Grateful for the complimentary valet and call ahead seating  but can t say we were happy with our dining experience. Service was awful and super slow.....the kitchen was allegedly backed up. Had to ask multiple times for drink refills  chips  plates  utensils  etc.  etc. We were a party of 5  and the food sort of trickled out as it was ready  but each meal that came out was luke warm at best. We chalked it up to the waiter being inexperienced. Disappointing overall  but would probably return to give it another chance since we did have a good experience on another visit last year.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,427,Stopped by for drinks with co-workers and took a chance on the 5 dollar endless chips and salsa. 3 different types of salsa appear ranging in hotness and consistency that were all above average and done well. While no one likes to pay for chips and salsa I didn t mind after trying it.   We sat in the annex portion of the building where a great  Nora Jones-esque  lounge singer was performing at just the right decible level to still have a conversation. We sat   stood around the bar where a long haired bartender was patient and witty with our group of people.   I had a great happy hour experience here.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,428,This was our first time here.  We stopped On our way thru town and it was So worth the stop  We sat on a great outdoor patio.  Our waiter was fabulous and the food 5stars.   Try the cornbread for sure.  I had beef street tacos.  They were by far the best I ve had 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,429,Always a great place to come and get out of the heat  Service is great. The patron fruzion margarita is by far my favorite. Be careful they are strong can sneak up on you. Atmosphere here is the best  Casual and funky with many rooms and also outdoor seating. I always feel comfortable coming here when I am alone and sitting at the bar to eat  Sunday brunches are tons of fun as well.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,430,As long as you show up a little early and beat the crowds  this is a great spot for lunch. Food is always excellent and friendly staff.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,431,Food is just Alright. The atmosphere is what makes this place worth going for.  We ordered the gauc and queso dip which was hmm alright and then ordered the steak and chicken fajitas. I couldn t say it was bad but also couldn t say it was really good. I would recommend going here if you re not very picky or if you want to have a nice view sitting outside.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,432,Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. It was fairly crowded but not crazy. It was a little chilly outside so we asked to sit indoors. Since the main dining area was full  they brought us to a back room which they said they had just opened up turned the heat on  so it should get warmer. It was pretty freezing and didn t get a whole lot warmer.   That said  that is my only complaint with Z Tejas. I ordered the breakfast enchiladas per the recommendation of the waitress  and my husband ordered the breakfast quesadilla. Both were really delicious  made with fresh ingredients  and had the authentic Tex Mex flavor I was hoping for. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,433,Hands down this is my most favorite casual restaurant in Austin- I moved here in  95 and have been going here since then on a regular basis.  It is truly my go-to spot for a casual get together with friends  a spot to grab a meal with family and also perfect for a business lunch.  The food is consistently yummy and the margaritas rock.    In addition  at this downtown location when the weather is good  the patio is the place to be 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,434,I like Z Tejas  but let me remark about the TERRIBLE and inconsiderate valet service here.  First off  I hate valets. I HATE THEM b c I see and know what they do with cars they park. If I ever have to valet  I tip them ahead of time to minimize this risk.  Well  I was out on a date and normally  I will drive myself around to find a strategic parking spot I like. I m a car guy and this is a guy thing. However  date won t like that so I use the valet.  I tell the guy to park it where there isn t risk of door dings and tip him well. My car has a very distinct exhaust and know what my car sounds like. We sit outside and the next thing I hear is my car s engine being reved to redline a couple of times. I should have watched my odometer.   When I get my car back  the valet has reprogrammed my seat memory  changed my stereo settings and changed songs.   I emailed their corporate and they said they would talk to the valet -- somehow I doubt that.   DON T VALET YOUR CAR IF YOU HAVE A NICE ONE.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,435,All of the food and drinks are fabulous here   They are usually always busy but there is open seating at in the bar are and they serve a full menu there too    I love the complimentary cornbread brought out in that cute little skillet   It actually has kernels of corn in it too    I started to give specific food recommendations and then realized that everything is consistently great here.    Both locations have unique patios that make outdoor dining great  but the inside is just as festive.   Kudos to Z Tejas for serving up great Southern-inspired dishes 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,436,This is a fantastic restaurant to go to for a business lunch or a dinner date  The queso is delish  but I ve had better guacamole. They give you cornbread as a table freebie  but you have to order chips and salsa  guac  or queso.  No problem getting a table on a weekday for lunch without reservations. Parking is not extensive  so account for a little extra walking time if you re meeting someone.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,437,The weather has cooled and there is not a single creeper cloud in sight. After you re done trying to buy that Dali lithograph on W 5th  the most appropriate place to go is Z Tejas.  Never has melted cheese been so fancy  or the steaks given you as much of the it s-sleepy-time fulfillment as it is at Z Tejas. I want to sleep forever in the nothingness as the warm cow meat travels in me like an expedition in a Jules Verne novel.  Even if you re by yourself you can sit and eat at the bar  as I have seen many middle aged men do. Perhaps you are brave enough to strike up a conversation with one of the ladies that randomly walks up to buy a margarita. You ll never tire of this chore  because it is true  not only are those margaritas delicious  but everyone in this place is fucking beautiful.  There must be some yoga class or soccer field nearby  as Z Tejas is not only bountiful in magnificent chips and salsa  but also lovely cougars looking for prey. So after you finish your steak or fajitas  hit one up  they keep Werther s in their pockets.  A 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,438,We had a reservation at 6 45 Friday night. We were pleasantly surprised that happy hour was going on and included all table seating  not just the bar. We ordered 5 appetizers--the street tacos  two tuna apps  Texas trio  and shrimp-n-guac bites. Everything was delicious  and the apps all ranged from  5 to  7. We also enjoyed the  5 margs. Our waiter Curtis was FANTASTIC--he pre-ordered our 2nd round of margs so we could get the cheap price but didn t bring them out until we were ready for them  well after the 7 p.m. cut-off for happy hour.  We ate and drink very well and left stuffed  and we each spent  25 apiece because of the happy hour pricing  we didn t order any entrees . Huge thumbs up 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,439,Terrible service. Hostesses are clueless and therefore can t get anyone seated efficiently. A reservation makes no difference. Plenty of tables just a terrible management system. Never mind the food. We never got around to that. Didn t feel like waiting 45 minutes just to be forgotten about once we got seated.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,440,Mothers Day and a complete disaster.  Reservations are not being honored.  Patrons are waiting up to an hour on their reservation times.  Understaffed.  Poorly managed.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,441,I have been a long time fan of Z tejas  but lately the service has been wanting.  Our server did not check with us between appetizers and entree to check about chips and more drinks. It was not a busy night  so it would have been very easy to check on us. We ordered the tejas trio  a favorite  but they never give enough chips. It was only when he delivered the entrees that we were able to ask for more. We ve had this server before at brunch and he was very inattentive. Water glasses were not refilled  he didn t ask if we wanted more drinks  etc. We had friends with us from out of town  so it was a little embarrassing. The food is always good  but they really need to work on their customer service  if they want us to continue to introduce friends to this longtime Austin favorite. And also  folks should know that they have stopped letting kids eat free on Sundays. As a parent  this is very disappointing. I know Z tejas has been purchased by another company and I m grateful they re still open  but I hope they get back to their roots of good food AND good service.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,442,I came here once for a late second dinner  don t judge - I had already had dinner but I couldn t let a friend eat alone .  I had heard so much about this place and was really excited to try this place.  We each ordered a glass of wine - pretty good.  I got the Mirassou Pinot Noir and he got the 14 Hands Merlot.  Cornbread is my ultimate comfort food  so I was excited when they brought some to the table.  I appreciated the kernels of corn I found in there but it was pretty dry and not as flavorful as I was hoping.    Since I had already eaten  I ordered the tortilla soup.  It was pretty run of the mill and a bit on the watery side for me  nothing exciting.  My friend ordered the Red Chile and Mango Steak Salad.  He was very happy with his  man salad.   I will say there were some interesting items on the menu that I would have tried had I not eaten before.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,443,Great outdoor seating area  The cornbread they serve while you wait is delicious as well 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,444,The good  Patio is beautiful no denying that. Also my meal the chicken and potato hash was great with the chipotle hollandaise with the eggs over easy. Loved it.    The bad  Service leaves much to be desired. I won t deny that the food is good either. However  because Z Tejas has become an Austin icon they seem to have lost attention to detail in the service aspect.  Pass on the drinks. Mimosa took forever to come and and was fairly standard. Bloody Mary - watered down. Screwdriver - watered down.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,445,Stacy was awesome best server at the 6th st location we had a great time  Check out tequila Tuesday half off margs
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,446,Let s start with the drinks  They have a really strong pour    I had the flight of margaritas and could feel it. The corn bread is phenomenal  especially with the sweet butter. I could not get enough of that stuff  A friend had recommended that I try the pecan crusted chicken salad. It was AMAZING  The portion was large and definitely left me full    This place is perfect for everyone. Great drinks  appetizers  entrees  cornbread  and the prices are very reasonable 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,447,I have been to this location several times  and the service is consistently great.  My favorite thing to order from here is the beef fajita plate- on point.  Tender  juicy  and very flavorful.  I ve also had the street tacos which were underwhelming.  They just lacked flavor overall.  I ll stick to the fajita plate.  I hear that the table side guac is delicious  but I ve never tried it.  Queso is pretty good-but nothing amazing.  Overall- run of the mill Tex Mex food  not GREAT but not bad.  Silver Lining  I did have their Skinny Cucumber Mule which was delicious and oh so refreshing.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,448,Great food except the banana nut muffins are sub par at best. However the cheese looking lemon muffins with seeds on top are very good     
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,449,Portions are smaller and prices are higher than in years past  but still seems to float above the bar for Austin restaurants.  Parking is horrendous  valet available   building is charming  and catch great live music in the bar  check calendar - saw Kat s Meow the other night. Great brunch  filling salads  and overall not many  holes  in the menu. Best Salad  Pecan-crusted Chicken Spinach Best  Speciality   Mac N  Cheese w  chicken or Pork Tenerloin Best Sandwich  Chicken Avacado Best S amp S  Seafood Enchiladas or Cilantro Ruby Trout Sleeper treats  Catfish Beignets and pulled pork nachos  To sum up  it s a pricier and more  be seen  version of ZAX.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,450,Z-Tejas on West 6th...so very Austin.  Warm  fuzzy memories of their fish tacos  the first restaurant meal I ever had in the city.  Of watching and listening to Abra Moore croon like a cat stretching in a ray of sunshine beaming through the window.  Of playing hooky early one afternoon with a margarita or 3.  And even the day when our offer was accepted on our house and we knew we d be moving here...and a grackle shit on my wife s head.  Good times.  Because there s nothing that really stands out about this place.  The food is good  but nothing is exceptional  and other than the fact that they use tortillas  call the cheese queso and make tequila drinks is there anything particularly mexican about it.   The service is generally good but rarely great.  The atmosphere is pleasant  but won t bowl you over.  And it s in a neighborhood  but also on a busy street.  And this is the original Z-Tejas restaurant  which should give it major points  except that they inexplicably moved their corporate headquarters to Phoenix.  I think they put something in your water glass that makes you happy when you re here and keeps you telling the bartender or waiter   Oh  sure...I ll have another  and makes you tip large.  Just look around at your fellow patrons...see their faces    Warm  fuzzy feelings...and no real understanding of the reason.  I love Z-Tejas.   I just wish I knew why.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,451,I m in texas and eating mexican food  so I guess this is tex-mex. If so  I want to refuse the crap I ve been eating back home.   I was here on a pre-paid work function  so we had  limited menu. I ordered the Diablo Chicken pasta and it was delicious. Not too spicy  but flavorful. I would have liked to try the mac  amp  cheese as it sounded interesting.  The margaritas pack a punch as well
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,452,Another fav for Austin.   There great lil eclectic Austin feel mingled with Tex Mex and great foods. Exceptionally fresh margies.  My favs  - Fish Tacos - Seared Ahi Steak - Dumplings - Fresh Margy
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,453,April was a month of a lot of Birthdays. Several  9  friends gathered at Z Tejas for a Birthday celebration happy hour. It was a Thursday at 6 15. It happened to be a hot afternoon  so we gathered at a table inside.   The waitress was extremely attentive  yet not annoying. She was prompt to refill cocktails  without having to flag her down. And she was friendly.   We ordered several appetizers at different times during our time there.   the serving dishes were cleared from the table as soon as they had been passed around and emptied onto our plates. This is a huge deal for me  I hate to look at empty plates on a table.   A delicious brownie a la mode was delivered to our table to top off the celebration. the brownie was comped - thank you.   If it couldn t get any better...we ordered the bill. A separate check had been produced for each of us  with our drinks  yes the ones the we drank ourselves not a group total  were listed on the check  as well as the numerous appetizers that had been divided by 9. We didn t request splits checks  she did it and we loved her for it    My faith in Z Tejas has been restored.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,454,There is no excuse for a restaurant  especially one as expensive as this  to have a bathroom with a public toilet stall.  No door  1 2 walls  WTF.    Ancho Chocolate pie is good.  Apps during happy hour are good.  Dinner is overpriced for the amount of food given  pasta was tiny . I just can t get over the lack of privacy in the bathroom.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,455,YUM   This place is great   I came here with the recommendation from Amber at the Livestrong offices.  She recommended this place to me to get some great TexMex food since I was in town for only a few hours.  The place is pretty big and can accommodate many people.  I came during the lunch rush so it ended up being pretty busy.  The waitress service was very good and attentive.  She recommended the chile relleno.  I ve never tried one before so I was anxious to taste it.  The food took about 10-12 minutes to cook.  It wasn t that long.  They serve you this great cornbread to eat while you wait for the dish to come.  It comes out warm and flavorful.  I ended up getting my chile relleno.  It looked and tasted as good as I thought it would be.  The chile set the meal off.  There was also a great tasting salsa that I would recommend trying as well.  Overall  it was a great experience.  I didn t know that they had locations out in Orange County so I ll definitely be sure to try it out again since its local.  Great place for TexMex food.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,456,We made a lunch reservation at 1230. Parking is always a pain. But it just wasn t busy.  Food is ok. Was good..nothing to write home about. Food came out fast. Waitress was on top of drink refills. But at 1230 we expected it to be full..
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,457,Absolutely one of my favorite places to eat in Austin. There is very little on the menu you can go wrong with. The grilled shrimp and guacamole tostados are the perfect appetizer to start off a fish or steak entree. If you re in the mood for comfort food  go for Jack s mac and cheese.   And if you like you margaritas strong  this is the spot to visit.   BTW  if you get a chance to take one of the Cooking with Jack classes  I highly recommend it.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,458,Went there for the first time this past Tuesday for dinner.  Good points   Complimentary valet service.  Very much appreciated   My Skyy Cherry Limeade.  Like candy in a glass  which I like.  The patio is gorgeous and inviting.  My grilled redfish over orzo and zucchini strips  a special  was pretty good.  Some green sauce drizzled over it that was like a pesto  but tasted more like arugula.  Very tasty.  Mediocre points   My girlfriend got the crispy salmon  which was good  but it was sitting in a giant puddle of oil in the plate.  Gross.  She ended up transferring the fish to a side plate so she could eat it.  The catfish appetizers.  Spiced well but YET AGAIN overly breaded.  People of Texas  stop coating your seafood in enough batter to coat chicken.  It s fish  it should be able to suffice with little more than some seasoned cornmeal.    Our waiter was super friendly  but he seemed to forget about us a lot.  He may have been busy  I m willing to grant him that since we sat down at 6 pm.  But the patio wasn t crowded  so who knows   Kind of overpriced.  Though I m not used to paying this much for fish  and that s because I m not used to living in a landlocked area.  So maybe my problem is that I m still adjusting to the price increase that comes with moving away from the coast.  So three stars.  If I m paying that much money  I want to be blown away.  And I wasn t.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,459,This was our first visit and we were there with our granddaughter for her birthday. I made reservations online. We arrived early and were seated right away. Everything about our experience was first class. From being able to have complimentary valet parking to the last bite of dessert we were well taken care of. This was our waiter s first night  Ernie  and he did a wonderful job.  There were four of us at our table and we all had something different and everyone really complemented their meals. Ernie did not believe in our tea glass getting low.  It was great not to have to ask for anything.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,460,So I have three no-fail recommendations I m finally getting around to writing about....1  Texas Trio - although they used to put a whole Serrano in the queso and now you must request on the side....do it. 2  Fish tacos - the best. ever. seriously. 3  Wild mushroom enchiladas - once and a few times since then  I strayed and ordered an entree....sinful and almost worth not having the fish tacos.  Otherwise  good wine list - light atmosphere - sort of local.  As an aside - how can  queso  not be a word on yelp spellcheck  UPDATE - just posted a blog entry on the fish tacos w pics    a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fkathywarren.wordpress.com 2F2009 2F08 2F15 2Fode-to-fish-tacos-at-ztejas 2F amp s 7cfec95e55058ccfc28a254524fcff7c2d5b178dd8bff0c7de01d5f5331ce358  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  kathywarren.wordpress.co   a 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,461,I just went to Z Tejas yesterday for the first time and really loved it. I had the Grilled Shrimp on Tostados with guacamole and shreds of carrots as an appetizer  and it was half-off since it was happy hour. That was extremely delicious.  Then I had the    11.39  Santa Fe Smoked Chicken Enchiladas Our house-smoked chicken layered with red chile sauce  chipotle pur e and Jack cheese  served with green chile rice and black beans.    and that was extremely delicious as well. I ate until the plate was clean. Then we topped it off with a cheescake   which flavor varies depending on the day   and it was incredibly light and fluffy and the crust was so good. Ours happened to be a strawberry cheescake  the whole creamy part had a slight strawberry flavor  with a chocolate crust. Very good.  It s a nice place  too. You can sit inside or out. Being on sixth street  parking can be terrible  but thankfully they offer complimentary valet  which is really painless. For all of that we got out of there for about  22  which seemed like a great deal for the food and the experience. I d love to go back and try more.  UPDATE  This has become one of our favorite restaurants. The complimentary corn bread is great  and pretty much any other thing you eat is fantastic. My favorite right now is the Ahi Chipotle Citrus Bites  and the Grilled Cilantro Pesto-Rubbed Ruby Trout. The happy hour prices for the appetizers make it perfect - really affordable for what you get.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,462,I love Z Tejas  I ate here today for Memorial Day with my hubby. I had the Trout Salad. It was so delish. A generous portion of perfectly cooked trout  and lots of goat cheese. Heaven.  We also had the tableside Guacamole which I m pretty sure I will dream about tonite. It did need some lime though  but I had one on the table  I didn t know that they had a vegetarian and Gluten Free menu available upon request. That s pretty awesome.  Bloody Marys  Patron Fruzion  need I say more 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,463,I enjoy coming to Z Tejas. They are always lively and packed  and it s a great environment.  Their food is great  drinks are great...Strawberry daquiri  mmm   Came here for my college graduation lunch  dates  and just to come. Great for all types of occasions.  Downside  sometimes their service is a bit questionable. One time we came  and they sat us all the way in the back where there was absolutely no one else. There was not even a waiter there. The waiter arrived 10 minutes later  apparently  she had just gotten into work. Why did they seat us at a place where they had no coverage  Anyways  regardless  she took our drink orders after 15 minutes of waiting  and was a bit slow to bring that  was a bit slow to take our order as well. But our food came out delicious  and it comes with your choice of a muffin or cornbread  unlike any that I have ever tasted  might I add   and we were satisifed at the end despite the rough start. Recommend 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,464,the food is good  small portion  compare to other Mexicans  but taste better  however  I m not gonna go back because a lil while ago I informed them about a mouse that was running around on the roof in the back patio  and they pretend that it s not important actually  my day was ruined because my guest was scared and I was embarrassed in front of my guest and we had to leave with our plates full  because the mouse was running and the leaves from the roof fell on my guest plate and they did nothing but laugh. so disappoint.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,465,Just had a great -- no  fantastic  -- lunch at Z Tejas on 6th.  I ve eaten at the 6th Street location before and I ve always had an excellent experience there.  The food has always been top notch  as has the service -- and for me  service is everything.  Great service -- or the lack thereof -- will make or break a place for me.  And I have room to gripe if I wish  because I waited tables   bartended for about 4 - 5 years of my life many years ago.  I know what good great service is.  Z Tejas is a little on the pricey side for lunch  so I don t do it every day or even once a week   17 for myself for meal   iced tea today   but for the quality of the food and service that you get  I d say it s a steal    I had the Spinach  Artichoke and Mushroom Stacked Chicken  available on the lunch menu  and not only was it cooked to perfection  but the presentation was phenomenal.  My two sides were mashed potatoes and julienned  sp   vegetables.  Both excellent as well -- though it s hard to screw up mash potatoes  lol  but I have seen it done   Our server had excellent service and timing.  In fact  come to think of it  that s the best service I ve had at a restaurant in quite some time   Not only was he polite and on top of keeping my glass full  but he knew the perfect timing to check on us and when I asked him some about the history of Z Tejas and the building we were in  he had answers to all of it   Obviously a server that cares about his work and place of employment -- it definitely showed.  I ve not ventured here for diner too often as it always seems to be crowded  but the times I have I ve always had the same type of experience as well.  Though depending on how busy they are sometimes the service can slow a little and it can get quite noisy if you re in the dining room rather than on a patio balcony dining area.  All in all you can t go wrong with Z Tejas on 6th  whether for lunch or dinner.  I love taking guests from out of town there for the first time.  They love it every time  without fail   I hope Z Tejas is around for a long time and that they stay at that location on 6th because it has such great character and is so uniquely Austin 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,466,Great place for a private party   Manager and staff are extremely helpful and easy to work with.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,467,Had a 5 30 reservation so traffic getting there was bad  but once we did their free valet parking was nice at the downtown location.  Margaritas were good  not great  but the ahi tuna appetizer was fantastic.  All the entrees were good and service was too.  The chocolate pie for dessert was tasty  although the aerver said it was  spicy   but it wasn t unfortunately.  Overall a nice experience for an early Friday evening dinner.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,468,Went there last night.  Sat on the patio.  Service was excellent  though our server was busy as hell.  All appetizers were 1 2 off all night  Monday .  The green chili pulled pork nachos were bomb   I got the baked seafood enchiladas for my meal and my man got the mushroom enchiladas.  We shared.  Both were wonderful...mine was better if you must choose.  Drinks were slightly weak...but hey  I like mine strong.   And to top it all off  Tim Riggins  from Friday Night Lights was at the table next to us   Lookin  very sexy 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,469,All right  I ll admit it.  I love this place.  Ambiance is great  food is awesome.  I happen to be a big fan of those shrimp and guac tostadas  been terrific for me every time .  You can t go wrong with any of their enchilada dinners  and for a special kicker...go with the jalapeno margaritas.   Only reason I don t give it 5 stars is that the wait can sometimes be a pain  and parking is always a drag.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,470,I met some friends here for lunch.  I think I ve only been to Z Tejas once  and it was up North and it was YEARS ago.  This was a lovely afternoon  aside from the fact that it was the Wed. before Thanksgiving and traffic was entirely screwed  making me about 20 minutes late.  Fortunately  my party had not yet ordered anything other than drinks.  I ordered water with lots of lemon  and our waitress brought out a small bowl with what looked like an entire lemon sliced up.  Score   After perusing the menu  I decided to take a chance on the chile relleno  and while I was waiting for it to arrive  I enjoyed some of the delicious cornbread sitting on the table.    Wow   I ve got a new favorite chile relleno  my next favorite is in San Antonio at the Rio Rio cantina    I was pleased that the poblano wasn t heavily breaded  and I loved the flavors and textures.  The whole thing was perfect.    One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna appetizer  which he invited us all to share.  It was fantastic   After lunch  we ordered a slice of ancho fudge pie to share.  It was delicious  although I personally would have liked a bit more heat from the ancho - I mean  it IS the first word in the name of the dessert   My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow at times.  Once we d decided we wanted to order a dessert  it took quite some time to track down our waitress...  I tend to be a creature of habit  so I m not sure that I ll ever manage to try anything other than that marvelous chile relleno  but I do think I will be back to Z Tejas sooner rather than later...
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,471,ZTejas...what s happened      Not only has your food quality  portion size  amp  selection decreased significantly but the poor service we received last weekend coupled w the increased competition for our business is moving this Austin institution to the bottom of our list - which makes us very sad.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,472,Me and five of my friends ate lunch at Z Tejas on March 13  2009 and I can assure you ever time I come back to Austin  I ll come back here. The food was spectacular  I can eat their guacamole with a spoon ... for hours   the environment was casual but quirky  the interconnected old houses that make up the building give it a tree house kind of vibe  which is neat   the margarita was outstanding and the service was solid.  I had the blackened catfish tacos  which were delicious. I m not sure what the dipping sauce was  but use it - it made them even better. We also had some appetizers which were very good. Their queso was great as well. It s all a little spicy  as you would expect from a southwestern grill  so make sure you keep the water handy  but all six of us loved our meals.  Highly recommended.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,473,A chilled mimosa  delicious Shrimp Tostadas and tasty Grilled Ruby Trout Salad atop Z Tejas open-air patio on 6th street is about as good as a Sunday afternoon brunch in the great city of Austin gets.  If you get there around 12  you won t have to wait long. The staff is fabulous and the food is consistently amazing  after 5 years of regular visits  I have never had a bad experience.  Tip  If you re having trouble finding a parking spot  pull thru the breezeway to the parking lot in the back 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,474,I used to live right around the corner from this place so I ended up here more often than usual. The food here is generally  ok  with a few things being really good but being a chain the cooking has a lack of  soul.  The drinks are the main draw to this place and they have some nice margaritas with the prickly pear flavor being one of my favorites. For the price there are a lot of other places in Austin I would rather go but for convenience when I lived here this was an  ok  place. Parking is horrible here so if I didn t live near enough to walk I probably would have rarely gone here and the location at the Arboretum is much easier to access.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,475,Everything we had here was unforgettable. Our server immediately made us all feel at home during a mid-week  vacation  lunch-- suggesting the fruit-infused Patron margaritas  DO IT. Absolutely delicious  to start. We gobbled down the fresh cornbread  on the house  and our guac  made with pumpkin seeds  different but very very tasty . Two of us had the mushroom enchiladas with shrimp  another suggestion by our wonderful server  and they were marvelous. I wish it hadn t been so hot so we could have enjoyed the outdoor patio-- but I guess we ll just have to come back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,476,For most restaurants  in order to serve fresh and inventive food  they need to limit their menu to a few items and do them well and from scratch.  Z-Tejas is one of the few exceptions that offers fresh and inventive items yet a very diverse menu  and does them all well.  Always a go-to place to make people happy  I have taken clients here  family here  out of town guests  friends and dates.  I ve had brunch  lunch and dinner. And I have never walked away hungry or unsatisfied.  In fact  all meals have been memorable.  Z-Tejas gets inventive too with dishes you ll crave but may never see anywhere else--like a Southwestern Eggs Benedict served inventively on a fresh homemade square of cornbread rather than an old-school English muffin.  The side dishes are as good as the main dishes and I ve had dish after dish of great dinner fare.  Better yet  there is something to please everyone because the menu offers traditional dishes and more inventive ones.  Yet  nothing tastes pre-made or frozen or from a can.    Done right.  Great patio too.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,477,Tried the original Z Tejas on a Saturday night with some friends who were visiting. We weren t blown away by the food  but it was a good experience overall.  Pros    We found parking on a side street easily  They take reservations  via Yelp Open Table   We were seated promptly  Service was quick  The restaurant itself is cozy and cute. Also  they have a decent amount of vegetarian gf selections.  Cons    I specifically requested salad dressing on the side - when it arrived at the table  I glanced over to see a server pouring it on himself.  It wasn t a huge deal  so I didn t say anything.   The Food    Mixed reviews. The Santa Fe Chicken Enchilada  from what I could tell  was so-so. I actually really enjoyed my Anchiote Chicken Chopped Salad  and my husband ordered the Barbacoa Enchiladas and cleaned his plate.  I can t say we re dying to go back  but it was a successful last-minute pick for a Saturday night.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,478,Food - Disappointing Atmosphere - Austin version of Chili s Service - OK  3 years ago I would have said that ZTejas was one of my rotating favorites to get a decent meal  especially for happy hour. Their half priced appetizers  mainly the trio  was my favorite.  It was usually consistent and you could bank that you were getting what you paid for. Decent - meaning not fancy  but quality and satisfying.   Today  I stopped by during happy hour after years of a hiatus and ordered off of the happy hour menu. Trio and Street Tacos. It was about 5 30pm and the place was half empty besides some families and 35  crowd.  After placing my order  I popped in to the ladies room and it immediately felt and looked grimy.  The upkeep and decor looked like it hadn t been updated since the last time I was there 3 years ago. You might be thinking   so what it s the bathroom   but that was the vibe of the whole restaurant - Stagnant.  This is Austin  we pride ourselves on design  ambiance and fresh flavors. ZTejas no longer meets any of those standards.  They must have changed management or have none at all.  Our waiter was....meh. When I asked what ingredients were in the skinny margarita  I despise pre-made sugar margarita mix  give me fresh ingredients darn it  It s not that difficult to squeeze a lime and add tequila...I digress . So I asked and his response was  um it has less calories and comes in a taller glass . Needless to say  I didn t order one.   When our street tacos came out  the corn tortillas were already soggy and had broken a part on the bottom and the. meat. was. cold. COLD.   unacceptable. I asked to speak with the manager and he quickly came out and confirmed they were not meant to be served cold. He politely said he would get us a fresh plate of tacos and remove it from the bill. He returned five minutes later with the same plate of tacos that had been microwaved. I could tell because the same disheveled pile of lettuce and tomatoes had not changed.    The trio was decent  but all components were overly sweet  especially the salsa.  If you consider this Tex Mex than you deserve to be punched in the face by Mr. Matt s El Rancho himself.   Verdict  Embarrassed that this is an Austin original and has the same standard as a Waffle House.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,479,With tex-mex and mexican places on just about every block  I wasn t expecting anything special. However  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was here.   I had the mushroom enchilada and my table ordered a chips  amp  dip trifecta that included guacamole  salsa and queso.   BOTTOM LINE  You will leave with a full tank.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,480,I m convinced that a sign of a good bartender is their ability to lip-read. Bars get noisy and individual voices fade into the abyss  but people still want their orders to come out exactly as they requested them. When I dropped in to Z Tejas for lunch today  I had a bad sinus infection and almost no voice left from having to talk all morning  yet my order came through loud and clear to whoever was working at the bar. Z Tejas isn t an unusually noisy restaurant--I was just unusually quiet. I didn t even have to repeat myself when I ordered. Thank you  ma am--you made one sick mute s day    The last time I went to Z Tejas was at their Bellevue  WA  location where it was the lone oasis of Tex-Mex on Seattle s eastside  so when I saw that there was a location between work and my apartment  oh  yes  this is exactly what I wanted for lunch. I went in craving the crawfish enchiladas that I always used to get only to find that they re off the menu now  but they ll still make them upon request. Eeeexcellent.  I highly recommend asking for these.   I decided to try the seafood enchiladas this time since they sounded good and I wanted to try something different. They came packed with salmon  tuna and shrimp. Totally packed. Plus  since they re made for each order  I could get them without the mushrooms--huzzah  If I order these again  though  I think I ll leave out the green leafy bits  spinach   since they didn t really mesh with the texture of the fish all that well to me. Well  that and a solid mass of fish between tortillas would RULE. I did wish that the sauce for these was a bit spicier  but that wasn t anything that the addition of a little salsa couldn t fix.   I did order one old standby  though  the queso. I love Z Tejas  queso  and now I know it wasn t just foodie Stockholm Syndrome at work. The cheese they use is more flavorful than your standard Velveeta and it s thick. Eventually it coagulates back into a near-forkable mass  but the chips are thick enough to compensate for this  so it all works. Thick queso beats the runny stuff any day for me. It comes with a glob of pico de gallo and a Zorro-mark of chipotle sauce on top. The roasted flavor of the salsa that comes with it is pretty tasty  too.   One problem with this  the queso was  8  Asking that much for queso was absolutely acceptable in the barren Tex-Mex wasteland that is the Seattle area  where queso is the first printing of two super-limited edition boxed sets of Unobtanium Deluxe. But in a place like Austin that s swimming in melted cheese and Ro-Tel  LOLWUT. I m quite fond of their queso  but I probably won t spend that much for it all that often unless I m stuck in the big sad north for way  way too long. The rest of the prices on the menu seemed to be on par with the rest of central Austin s noms  but the queso was a bit much. I must find this happy hour that the rest of you Yelpers speak of and nom the heck out of some reasonably-priced chip dip.   The building itself is lovely  bright and cozy inside  like a big house with one of the nicest patio areas I ve seen in town. If I hadn t been sick and just eating lunch by myself  I might have wanted to sit outside. The big patio is covered in shade.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,481,I had never been to this location before  as I don t frequent downtown very often due to living up in Cedar Park. A friend and I were shopping at some different stores downtown and stopped in for lunch. She is new in town  and this was her first  Z  experience.   What a cool location  We loved all of the windows  the patios and walkway - it was all decorated up for the holidays and the atmosphere was really great   The food as usual - always good  We had the chips with salsa and added queso and guacamole on to or order which were excellent  She got the turkey avocado burger and said it was really good. I got the mac n cheese with cheese with chicken which is one of my favorites and never disappoints. We sat and talked and ate our lunches for quite a while  just enjoying the nice atmosphere. Our waitress was attentive and nice - and when we had stuffed ourselves she boxed up the rest of our food for us.   It was nice to take my new Austin friend to a place that impresses. We were going to go somewhere else  but as we were driving past Z Tejas  I pulled in really quick and said   We re going here instead.. you ll love it.  And she did   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,482,This is my new favorite happy hour spot in Austin.  The title was formerly held by 219 West  but then they shut down for a while to move to a new location  and Z Tejas snuck in and stole my heart away.  Sorry  219.  It s not you  it s me.  I ll be the first to admit that Z Tejas isn t the only place in town - or even the only place on the block - that offers  1 off all drinks  and half-price apps during happy hour  but it s all abut QUALITY here  and you just can t beat the margaritas and queso at Z Tejas.   All the fruity margaritas are good  but the pomegranate is probably the best.   But the real winner is the 20th Anniversary Margarita.  It s the perfect combination of wildberry syrup and Grand Marnier.  But regardless of your drink of choice  you MUST try the Tejas Trio appetizer.  The chili con queso with chorizo is the best in town  and the salsa and guacamole just make it even better.  And it s half-price for happy hour  so order two of  em 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,483,It is so truly hard to fault this place. The food is delicious  the service is good and the consistency of both is outstanding. I have gone to all 3 locations for many years and still enjoy it every time I sit down. Take advantage of the free appetizer on the survey and save a ton on the next visit. This is a great place for a date or to take the parents.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,484,The people I came with said four stars but I over ruled then this place is a five star place   I had the smoked chicken chile relleno and oh my goodness it may have been the best chills relleno I ve ever had and I ve had a lot. The filling was incredible and the pepper was a perfect addition. They put two sauces on top of it that were both very good but very different  The rice and beans were also good the rice was very fresh with seasonal vegetables.  If you come here order the salsa trio or the trio with the salsa cheese dip and guacamole their salsa is for sure the best salsa I ve ever had  The mango steak salad which my sister has was also incredibly delicious. They didn t skimp on the dressing which I find as a problem in a lot of places but not here.  The corn bread is also good and homemade if you like that   The restaurant is very small and up several steep steps.  The service was fantastic very friendly and attentive. I will come back next time I m in Austin Hopefully for a tamu Vs. tu football game  Thanks and GIG EM 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,485,An impressive locale. This Sixth Street restaurant is housed in an old Victorian  the proud original  and arguably the coolest  in the Z Tejas family.  They now have ten scattered throughout the West.   Z is upscale without the snoot.  Z is expensive.  Z is an airy atmosphere with low-hanging trees  multiple-level dining areas  indoor outdoor seating  and the creaks of a structure that s been sitting for awhile. Z offers delicious appetizers and strong drinks. Try the Tejas Trio or the Grilled Shrimp and Guacamole Tostada Bites. Z does not offer many vegetarian options.  Great stop for a semi-formal lunch  a celebration dinner  or maybe a happy hour.  Scrumptious.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,486,A really great dining experience.  A nice progressive crowd and a varied menu.  Service great and I enjoyed my mojito.    Buen Provecho 
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,487,This place was OK not bad but not great some of the food just didn t have enough flavor.  I had the Baja fish taco and I just wasn t  that into it  it just tasted like plain battered fish with no seasoning. The corn bread they give you though is amazing  atmosphere was real chill and relaxed nothing fancy which I did like and a cute little patio as well for the nice weather days.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,488,What do you get when you combine a free birthday coupon and ravenous birds   No its not a trip into an Alfred Hitchcock thriller  its a dining experience at Z Tejas  I had recently acquired a coupon to score a free meal as a result of my advancing nuptials into manhood and promptly grabbed my coworker and embarked on a crusade of near epic proportions  We arrived mid lunch rush and were seated rather quickly on the outside patio. After glancing over the menu  I decided on the red snapper while my partner in crime ordered some tacos  While we waited for our food  the real action took place. There was a food dolly sitting in the middle of the patio that seemed to be a large bullseye for all nearby birds. We watched in utter amazement and hilarity as a multitude of birds swarmed down and grabbed a near entire plate s worth of French fries from the dolly.   Hilarity ensued  we were both easily amused  My partner seemed to enjoy her tacos but I had mediocre feelings about my snapper. The fish was cooked just fine but the pesto rub flavor was almost non existent  I felt as if I had made this dish a thousand times during my early fitness meals  need MOAR protein .  Overall I left throughly entertained but not really inclined to give it another reach around
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,489,I really love this place. I have to say that they have some of the best margaritas in town. Awesome margaritas and a nice assortment of Mexican martinis. The Millionaire Margarita is my favorite. It is strong  though  so you have been warned  The food is good  although much of it is quite rich. My favorite is actually an appetizer  which is the green chile pork  which comes in a cast iron skillet with tortillas on the side. I make tacos out of it. The flavor is amazing. The only downside is that this place does not provide you with chips and salsa for free. They do have great chips and salsa that you can purchase  which comes with about 3 different types  and I always get it. But on the bright side  they do provide yummy  hot skillet cornbread with a side of honey butter  which is great  with all entrees.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,490,I ve only been to Z Tejas to see Will Sexton at his Wednesday night residency.  On a night when Will is in the zone  this is some of the best music you will see in town. Will s broken-hearted yet well spun  lyrics and cool delivery are singular and palpable.  Throw in a margarita with Heredura Silver tequila and you have yourself the makings of an evening  mein freund.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,491,The boyfriend and I went for Sunday brunch  and my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach that day  because I had a giant pancake  eggs  beans  veggies  and a huge corn muffin.   I love this place because it s not like any other place you ll ever go  the wait isn t long  and the food is GOOD. And that s saying a lot  because I love breakfast foods so much that I even like Ihop.   Never been there for dinner or for a real lunch  only brunches  so maybe it s different at night. But during the morning  it s the best.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,492,Picked this place for a friend s birthday dinner. Thank you Z Tejas for making me look good  Four of us showed up an hour early for a reservation  prepared to drink at the bar if need be  and were surprised to be escorted to a perfect table on the patio. We could hear great music wafting outside from the inside bar  were given excellent  friendly service  and the food and drinks were delicious.   I work in the service industry myself. From that perspective  you learn to really appreciate when a place gets everything right... it s no easy production  Will definitely be back.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,493,I came here for a business dinner and thought it was a great rustic  low key  adorable restaurant. After 3 30 pm  they have valet parking.  We started with their dumplings and could have eaten 2 more sides of these. Flavorful and delicious  Next  we had our entrees  Chicken Enchiladas  Ruby red trout and the chorizo stuffed pork chops....seriously just terrific. Perfect tex mex on a plate to say the least.   A great place for a family  business gathering or margaritas after work.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,494,Sweet outdoor set-up. Our waitress was hilarious  attentive  and made great suggestions. Table side guacamole blew my mind- the smoked Tabasco  pumpkin seeds  and goat cheese really took it to the next level.  Just wish the guy who prepped it cut up the avocados better. Margaritas were fun and festive. Food was good- Chorizo stuffed pork was delicious  my friend raved about the mushroom enchiladas  and I had the barbacoa enchiladas  which were good but not great. Price was right   Great spot   
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,495,Sometimes long wait  sometimes empty.  It s strange.  The food is not terrible  the drink list is pretty impressive and it can be a nice place  depending on your server  ranges from top notch to wanting to walk your tab   I m a diablo chicken fan but most other stuff is not bad.  However  their happy hour has to be one of the best in town.  Half price appetizers and pretty good drink specials.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,496,I come here for the ambience if I want to have a drink with a girlfriend some nachos some o clock on a Friday night. Besides that it s just completely ordinary.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,497,Great outdoor patio  Have been here for a couple of happy hours  drinks are not too pricey and the appetizers are half off.   Parking can be a pain though in you get there after 5 pm.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,498,I LOVE this place  This is our favorite happy hour place. Their appetizer is about half off during HH and we always go there for that. Our favorite items are Chicken Quesadillas  probably the BEST quesadillas in Austin  and Chile Pork Verde. Even though those are only appetizers  it can make two people s dinner and was pretty filling.   We tried other dishes such as the Street Tacos  Catfish Beignets  Catfish Tacos  and Seared Ahi Tuna  and they are all very GOOD. The quesadillas and Pork Verde are still our favorite though.  They also give a complimentary  super yummy corn bread. The service is always great... the servers are very nice and respectful  and I love the ambiance of the restaurant. Everytime we go there we end up spending around  15 including tax   service fee   20 if we are super hungry. It is totally worth it  Will definitely go back for more yummies there.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,499,Have been looking forward to trying this place for almost 4 years...I should have forgotten about it. Best parts  service  margarita  amp  dessert. Everything else was over priced hype. There s way too many restaurants in this city...one  amp  done.
Z'Tejas - Austin 6 STREET,500,I had high expectations fro Z Tejas because it used to be my favorite restaurant when I was in college. I came back to Austin with a few friends for the weekend and was sorely disappointed with my meal. It could have just been my meal choice.   I had the guacamole for appetizer  and it was a bit bland. It could have used more lime and a bit more salt. I had the red pepper and mango salad for dinner  and it was DRENCHED in salad dressing. So much so that the lettuce and veggies were soggy. I had a couple bites of my friend s mushroom enchilada  and that was much better. I also used to dream of the corn bread that they give you upon arrival  but that was oily and bland as well.   Overall  very disappointing
