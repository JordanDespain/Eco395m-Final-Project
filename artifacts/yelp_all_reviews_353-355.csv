Fajita Pete's - MoPac,1,So glad I found this place  Fajita Pete s   I was stuck in the car  waiting for my wife at a doctor s appointment and it had gone on more than two hours.  I was famished and I wanted to get a bite to eat.  My choices were so limited.   I m trying to eat healthy and all I could find were greasy fast food burgers  or pizza  or other things that would not fit what I was looking for.   But I found this place Fajita Pete s on Yelp and went in there.  Sure enough I was able to get a healthy chicken fajita salad. nice protein  and very few carbs     The fajitas were outstanding  and the staff was really  really nice and really helpful. They even gave me a sample of the chicken and the beef before I placed my order so I knew which way I wanted to go.   Great place and I ll be back
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,2,I really wanted this takeout place to work out. Apparently  they have done well in the Houston region.  That said  it s pretty risky for a TexMex takeout business to come into Central Texas and try to pull off a takeout TexMex concept. There are some exceptional TexMex eateries to get takeout from in Austin. You have to be just as good as everyone else. The  Fajitas for 2  takeout order we had  Cons  - Very little onions and peppers included  - Mixed beans were the worst I have ever had  - Not enough tortillas  - watered down tasteless salsa  Pros  - the meat was seasoned well and tasty - the rice was good - they deliver... includes Margaritas   In short  Fajita Petes is just not up to par with most local Tex-Mex restaurants. There  I said it.... I wish them luck in other cities  but they will have a difficult time making it in Central Texas.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,3,Anyone who know me  knows that I m a snob when it comes to Mexican food.  I grew up in Mexico after all   So I had Fajita Pete s today for the first time.  Went with the beef fajitas  boracho beans  flour tortillas and of course  margaritas.  A  on all of it   The fajitas were tender  moist and tasty.  The tortillas were homemade.  The boracho beans were good -- wish I had more of them.  And the margaritas were excellent.  This is a place I will be coming back to for sure   Thank you Fajita Pete s   
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,4,Sergieo can definitely provide miracles   Evening tough days  he comes through   The food and Margarita s were delicious too   Definitely would call on him again in the future   Thank you Sergio 
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,5,I was really excited for Fajita Pete s to open on Balcones  because it is on my way home from work  and I was looking forward to many easy pick-up meals in the future.  So with great anticipation  I ordered the 4-person fajita pack for dinner tonight.   The good - online ordering was easy  and my food was ready right on time.    The bad - when I got home and opened the bag  I was totally taken aback by the tiny amount of food. A small flat container of protein  a 16 oz plastic container of rice  a 10 oz plastic container of beans  and an even smaller  maybe 10 oz container  of salsa  a pack of tortillas  and a huge bag of  cheap filler  chips.  This was for FOUR people   With tax and tip  my total price came to  74.  I m generally not a complainer  but this was ridiculous.  I called the store to ask whether or not they had given me the wrong order.  They confirmed it was all correct.  I told the manager  who was very polite and nice and was clearly trying to be helpful  that this wasn t right. After some discussion  he offered to refund my money if I brought the food back.  So I got in my car and drove it all back  and got my money back.  And then I drove directly to Taco Cabana and got their family fajita pack  slightly less protein  more beans  more rice  more tortillas  plus some fried onions guac cheese pico  none of which Fajita Pete s includes  for  35.  Literally less than 1 2 the cost.  Plus I don t have to order ahead - just hit the drive through.  I really can t comment on Fajita Pete s food at all.  I didn t touch it.    TLDR  Unbelievably overpriced for what you get.  With so so so many other places in town to get great fajitas at a fair price - don t waste your money at Fajita Pete s.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,6,Went during their pre-open when they had an invite for the neighborhood to come try it out. Got some beef  chicken  rice  beans  fajita toppings and flour tortillas. All was tasty. My only beef  heh heh  was that the beef was a tad chewy  and could have used a bit more of the toppings  lettuce cheese etc  to stretch across all the fajitas I constructed. Other than that  I enjoyed every bite  and I m impressed by the homemade tortillas. Want to try the corn tortillas next time. Will be going back.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,7,This feedback is intended more for the manager  if they are paying attention  than as a slam against them. They are new  and possibly struggling with post-Covid issues relating to hiring competent people  but they are nearby  and FAST delivery. After several orders I have found the quality to be mediocre and very inconsistent. They re fajitas are quite bland. This could be indemic to the chain s recipe  but Chipotle  as an example  has more flavorful meat. Seasoning and marination would help. The beef has been quite tough every time. Either a higher quality of meat or a better marination would help. At a minimum  consistently cutting it into smaller pieces would avoid the situation where you re taking a bite and end up pulling a 3  piece out of your fajita with your teeth. Same goes for chicken-large hunks are not appropriate for fajitas....train your people to chop better. Tortillas is another area of inconsistency. On one order  we ordered both flour and corn and  although commendable  the manager check the order when I picked it up  the corn were actually missing when I got home. Another time  although I commend them for cooking the flour flour tortillas in-house  if you don t cook them  you might as well buy pre-cooked tortillas from Sysco. Mine were mostly raw on this occasion and gross. Lots of potential  but a this point  for fajitas in Austin  a 3 out of 5 is generous. Generamkye  there seemed to be many problems with consistency and a generally very bland flavor.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,8,My neighborhood group posted this little gem so I had to check out what all the hype was about and yummo   The perfectly homemade tortillas were the best I ve ever had.  I got the chicken  shrimp and beef fajitas because I couldn t decide.  The beef was tender and melted in my mouth.  The chicken was charred to perfection with the desired taste of a delectable fajita meat and the shrimp was mmmm mmmm good   Chips  queso and salsa were a perfect addition with just the right Tex-Mex taste.  Sweet little churros ended with a bang and the kiddos sure loved those.  Will definitely return 
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,9,Our first time and it is wonderful   Everything was fantastic...the corn tortillas are so unique...really handmade and kinda thick.  We got the mixed shrimp and chicken and it was excellent.  Also the refried beans with no lard are fantastic  and nothing is salty....just the right amount. The other items they give to go with the fajitas were all really great. I am totally impressed and will definitely go back.  So glad they are in the neighborhood. You will not be disappointed 
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,10,OMG  this place is totally awesome the food was great I am coming back I m telling my friends about this place.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,11,Veggie fajitas... greasy cooked on a flat top. Plain uninteresting tortillas  meh sides. So many other places doing so much better food. It s just not worth eating bad food anywhere  including this place.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,12,Meats we re decent. Salsa like a bland tomato sauce. Refried beans had no texture  more like baby food. Hubby likes the queso. Overall  think food is better  amp  cheaper at Taco Cabana. The nearby Zuzu s is better quality and better flavors.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,13,We ordered takeout Fajita s and overall enjoyed our order. We ordered online and it was ready in about 20 minutes. We got the beef and chicken fajitas for two  and it came with all the toppings as well as rice  beans  tortillas  and salsa. I think the flavor was pretty good  especially with the beef. I agree with several other reviews though that the portions were pretty small. We only got one small container of rice and beans and the toppings  lettuce  cheese  etc  were really only enough for 2 tacos total. I think this place has good potential but should be a little more generous with their portions.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,14,Whoaaaaaa   I was surprised and saddened to see some of these negative reviews as this has not been my experience. It is probably pretty hard to get delivery drivers etc during this employee shortage so I am sure it can be pretty hectic over there.  BUT so far we have ordered their fajitas 4 times and had them delivered.  I ve used the app and I also called this evening when my order hadn t arrived.  I realized I had screwed up and made the order for tomorrow.  I just told them to keep that order and I would figure it out for tonight since it was clearly my mistake.  No big deal.  But they were super nice and brought the food right over.  The gentleman on the phone was so nice.  I really appreciated it.  I own my own business and work in the service industry.  I know first hand these reviews can make or break a business.  I hope they stick it out and gain a following here as it is really nice to have something new and easy delivered to the house when I don t have time to get dinner together.  Their fajitas are good too.  I prefer the beef and shrimp and the queso is super yummy.  Oh and the mushrooms.  So good.  Thanks for your hard work everyone 
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,15,Over-priced for the amount of food provided.  They messed up the order.  After being told 20 mins after my delivery time that my food was waiting on the delivery driver  I drove to pick it up.  It was cold.  Hope they figure things out because the Houston Bellaire location was amazing but this franchisee hasn t figured it out yet including pricing.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,16,Loved our Fajitas Pete s order  Ordered the La Familia to cover us on lunch today and dinner tomorrow. Taquitos  guac  and quesoooo. The chicken beef fajitas perfect and corn tortillas absolute must.   I do wish fajitas came with shredded lettuce. Kids loved the churros too  We will  be back 
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,17,I was quoted a 20 min pick up time. After placing order  they changed it to 60 min. I called store and attempted to cancel  but they told me it would be ready in 20 min. I drove to the store  and then they said it would be another 60 min. Unreliable and bad customer service. At least I got my money back.
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,18,Fajita Pete s hit it out of the park last night   They catered our meal for our son s wedding shower for 50 ppl.  The process was seamless.  The food arrived perfectly on time and was set up efficiently.  It was SO delicious  fresh and savory.  Everyone enjoyed it   We cannot recommend them enough  Scott Family
Fajita Pete's - MoPac,19,The concept is nice but still has some issues.  We ordered online and everything went fine.   Food was ready when noted and was hot even in the case of having to drive a bit.  Overall the beef fajitas were good  similar to Lupe Tortilla.  The issues is three things. For the money the amount of fajitas you receive is very small.  We got the fajitas for four and it turns out to be about one fajita per person.  Then on top of that even though the website states you get guacamole with your order it did not come with any.  When calling to inform them that we did not receive guacamole we were asked if we ordered by phone or online.  When we stated online the response was oh that is the problem we are telling everyone when they call in        There was no real interest in rectifying the order.   As of today the website still states you get guacamole.  Not sure if this has been fixed but for the prices charged.  Lastly the tortillas were good but wrapped tightly together in tin foil.  By the time we got home each of the tortillas had molded together and were fairly useless.  The taste was good but for a togo fajita shop the detail of how the food travel is important and when you charge a premium it needs to be addressed.
La Sirena,1,La Sirena came to my complex for a food truck night and their shrimp quesadillas are   Besides how delicious it was It had so much shrimp and they were a really decent size. Loved it and can t wait to try some other foods from them 
La Sirena,2,Decent tacos  made me pretty happy. They were a decent size and the shrimp was flavorful. I only got the camaron so I ll need to go back and try the beef ti has a full understanding of their range.
La Sirena,3,Recently I was on Rainey St. and visited La Sirena which is located right in the middle at that food truck park.  I got the   - Camaron  Shrimp  Tacos  which also has house slaw  mandarin  queso fresco  and a blend of tomatillo avocado vinaigrette. This was interesting and had an array of flavors. The shrimp was great both in its flavor and it s texture - 8 10   11 for 2   - Carnitas  Slow Braised Crisp Pork  Tacos  which also has onions  cilantro  and queso fresco. Good flavor with hints of richness - 7 10   8 for 2   - Steak Quesadilla  this for the job done and was great. Simple  yet delicious - 8 10   12   Overall  if you re already on Rainey St. then this is a good spot to visit. I wouldn t come specifically for the truck  but that s okay because the food was good  the prices are fine  and the food came out quick. With that said  I give them a 4 5 for having some good and some great qualities.
La Sirena,4,Tacos and quesadillas  what else could you want  Quick and easy to order street food. I went with the bistek encebollardo quesadilla. For the price it was very filling and well worth it. I was beyond pleased with the service and how quick the food came out. The staff was great to be around. I will definitely eat here again the next time I m out on Rainy Street.
La Sirena,5,My thought process was that Mexican food would be better Texas right  Since it s so close to the border  I was wrong and slightly disappointed by this place. It s a small food truck on Rainey Street and at first glance it looks authentic enough that it pulls you.   Star 1  How was the service and atmosphere  The service was fine. It was easy to order and are fairly quick on making your food depending on wether or not there is a line. There wasn t when I went so it was quick.   Star 2  How were the portions and quality relative to the price  Portions were decent  and pricing seems fair. It s comparable to what the other food trucks  some that also sell tacos  within feet away we re selling.   Star 3 and 4  How was the food  The food was slightly below average that it s hard to grant even 2 stars in this category. I ordered the elote which I was so excited about. Upon receiving it I was left disappointed however. It s almost like they could ve made something great but didn t put enough effort into it  There was a tiny bit of Mayo and a tiny bit of spices that by the time you get to the second bite you re left with a cup of plain  lukewarm corn. The tacos were similar. They just lacked a little something extra  spice  toppings   to really make this a memorable meal.   Star 5  Would I be excited to visit again   Unfortunately  I would not be excited to visit again. Since it s located among so many other food trucks they really need to step up their game if they want to compete 
La Sirena,6,They ran out of bistek and it was only 8 30pm.. thankfully the chicken tacos were great 
La Sirena,7,I will say coming from South Texas  I have had the pleasure of knowing what good tacos taste like and this place really hit it out the park. I was there on a late Friday evening waiting to get some food which my wife recommended we get tacos. Food trucks can be hit or miss so we took a chance and we were wow d I had the bistek tacos which were flavorful however I would ve liked a little bit more meat. My wife had the elote and shrimp tacos. As soon as she took one bite of the shrimp tacos she knew it was the real deal. They were bursting with flavor and my wife added that the food tasted very clean which can be cautious coming from a good truck. The elote was also good  All in all I give this place 5 5.
La Sirena,8,OMG  that was damn delicious   I just had the fish tacos and the corn in a cup. My wife had the carnitas. Both were seriously full of flavor  and the corn in a cup... the name doesn t do it justice. It s bursting with flavor. I know this sounds over the top. I don t generally tend to hyperbole  but this meal was really satisfying.
La Sirena,9,Food here was definitely amazing we drove way from Steiner Ranch to try these tacos and also the crab quesadillas the prices are a little up there but hey that s what it cost when you are getting good food I love this place I love it the only thing I hate is that they open up at 5 PM maybe 4 30 PM sometimes but it s definitely worth it and the customer service is amazing the quesadillas have Oowee gooey cheesy mess going on plenty of onions and bell peppers I will be back
La Sirena,10,This Taco truck is AMAZING   They have a small menu but everything they offer is of the highest quality of ingredients  they make the food made to order right then and there and its everything you should expect from a food truck  5 STARS. I recommend the fish tacos  the crab quesadilla  carnitas tacos  and the elote  corn in a cup topped with butter  mayo  parmesan  Valentinas hot sauce  amp  a special chili salt spice mix . Oh and they even have a vegetarian option   
La Sirena,11,Amazing food and Josie is wonderful definitely stop by when you are out it s fantastic and they are wonderful  
La Sirena,12,I tried this place out yesterday and had a good first experience. I went around 9pm and the line wasn t too long. I ordered the Camaron  shrimp  tacos and I thought it was pretty good. I didn t have to wait more than 15 mins for my food.
La Sirena,13,I paid 8 dollars for 2 tacos of bistec all the way. I thought it was pretty expensive but when I received the tacos it had a bit more meat than I was expecting so I was happy  until I bit into the taco and I was greeted by crunchy meat. It was extremely over cooked tasting only of charcoal. Spending so much I was hoping it was only a small part of the meat  maybe it was just some scraps from the side of the grill  but as I tried the rest it all tasted the same. I will never try this place again nor do I recommend it to anyone.
La Sirena,14,I was a fan of the fantabulous trailer and sad to see it go but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is the parent truck. Located in the food trailer park on the south end of Rainey st  This truck s menu is a little bit larger than the former fantabulous trailer but the quality has diminished slightly and the prices seem higher. Not a good combination.  A decent Austin street taco can be found here though it still pales in comparison to those found on the west coast and even Austin as a whole.  Still on the hunt for the best street taco in Austin  The service was fast and friendly. This place is worth a go but you can definitely find better tacos elsewhere.
La Sirena,15,A very very mediocre taco with only corn tortillas. Very underwhelmed and feel gypped as they were  10   I could get many more better tacos at  bettys tacos on east.  No wonder there was literally no line.
La Sirena,16,I LOVE this taco truck  For me  hands down  the BEST steak tacos I ve ever had  I eat here about once a month  and the great food and friendly service is consistent. Keep up the great work  y all  I ll be back soon - 
La Sirena,17,This truck is subpar at best.  Food was 1 star.  Carnitas taco had lots of fat that I had to rip out of my mouth on my first bite.  Terrible   Service was 1 star....asked for 1 chicken and 1 carnitas taco but the lady handling the window stated  sorry we can t do that   Really   Is is that difficult in a taco truck to offer your customers the opportunity to mix their taco selection.  Never tell your customer NO if its a reasonable request.  That customer service 101.  Anything I can do to help you   My vist was 2 15 20 at midnight
La Sirena,18,If I could give zero stars I would. The lady taking orders is extremely rude. She never told me how long it would take to make the food. I only asked for a single order of shrimp tacos. I waited for what it seemed like an eternity.  In the end I waited too long for what I asked for so I asked for a refund which they gladly gave me. JUST AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS FOR REAL TACOS GO TO BUNGALOW.
La Sirena,19,I was going to give them a chance  but with a derogatory menu on the list like  la beaner  I would never support them.
La Sirena,20,I ordered two chicken tacos and waited for about 30 minutes only to be to that I never ordered anything. I watched as my friend got his tacos despite ordering minutes after I did and made friends in line who got their food before I was told I apparently didn t order. In the end  they were unwilling to accommodate my order. An incredible disappointment all around.
La Sirena,21,Friendly staff  fast service  good tacos  reasonable prices. The green sauce is delicious but SPICY  Overall I was happy w my experience
La Sirena,22,Delicious bean and avocado tacos  Probably wouldn t order the corn in a cup again especially for the price  but definitely recommend the vegetarian tacos  Yum 
La Sirena,23,This place had terrible service. The lady with black hair who takes the order was so lost and confused. She tried to double charge me. Refused to give me my food and was a complete asshole. After waiting 20 minutes they tried to get an attitude with the customers for being late on be orders. She threw my food at me and said here bye. Horrible service and not soo good food
La Sirena,24,We got the Bistek tacos and the Pez tacos  fish of the day was Salmon  and both we absolutely incredible. Tacos are 2 for  8 and 2 for  10 respectively. All in all delicious  but a little pricey for small tacos.
La Sirena,25,Today I tried this food trailer for the first time. I got the veggie tacos that were supposed to be avocado  beans  and queso fresca. The avocados were mostly black with the little black strings that avocados get in them when they are old. I would not serve that to a guest at my house. They should have just said that they were out of avocados. Ordering was difficult  the lady had us repeat our order 3 times  even though it was only 2 items and we ordered right off the menu with no modifications. 4 dollars a taco for very mediocre tacos with black avocados is a very bad value. I will say that their tortillas and green sauce were good. I will not ever be going back.
El Pollo Rico,1,Came here for an early lunch. There s a lot of gnats  and the wait was very long just for three things but the food was really good. Their green sauce is my favorite  Added that to my Rico bowl and it made it even better. Plantains taste like the frozen ones but are still delicious. Definitely will try another el pollo Rico though. Wish they had a drive thru
El Pollo Rico,2,2 people in front of me ordering. 1 white guy  than 1 Mexican guy  than me white guy . The other white guy goes and sits down in the back playin on his phone. We all order our food. Mexican woman comes in after me and orders. 5 minutes later both the Mexican dude and the Mexican woman got their food. When I watch her hand them the food  she s looking at me like she knows she is doing it on purpose. She had the kitchen prepare their meals first instead of doing them in order. No AC so sweating bullets the whole time. I finally get my food  and the white guy who ordered before all us was still playin on his phone as I m walking out the door. Than when they say my food is done  they left the bag of food on their side of the counter so I had to reach across and grab it instead of her just sliding it to me. Than when I say thank you have a nice day  get no response. Get home  I had ordered a 15 dollar mex mix meal. And i didn t even get the chicken. They left out half my meal. This place absolutely sucks 
El Pollo Rico,3,After driving by El Pollo Ricos for years  I finally decided to stop by this location to see what it was all about. I was intrigued by the smoke that always seems to billow out of these stores and don t know why it took so long for me to realize that they make charcoal grilled food here.  I ordered the full chicken and two sides  rice and plantains . The girl who look my order did not speak much English  but was very cordial and accommodating when she initially rang up my order wrong. The meal took a bit longer than I was expecting   15 minute wait  and it was confusing how you aren t given an order number when you get it to-go. The inside is pretty drab but I wasn t expecting much since I was going to take my order out.  Flavor-wise it was on-point  Very nice smoky taste but what I loved was how well the chicken was seasoned. Reminiscent of some of the flavorful grilled chicken meals I have had in African cuisine Nandos. I was disappointed with how small the sides are  seriously for the size of the chicken meal  you would expect larger sides to accommodate the amount of people eating . The rice was standard but I loved the plantains- sweet and large. I would definitely eat here again  and would encourage you to try it out too 
El Pollo Rico,4,I came here early on Friday for lunch because I was hungry and wanted spicy.  They fed me well and I got some zing with my salsa.  So  all in all  mission accomplished.  If there s a downside or two here  it s that the food isn t all that fast  but it is worth it  and English is definitely the second language here.  But these won t be enough to keep me from coming back.  Trust me on this.  The chicken is good  but this is now of my favorite places for a fajita platter  although they call it a carne asada platter.  Because I m finicky  I order mine without onion.  What you get is a huge platter of thinly sliced beef on a sizzling platter.  You get enough beef to feed two people of average appetite  but in the interest of maintaining my Elite status  I did sacrifice and eat all of the beef to ensure a good review experience.  The beef is well done and has a good seasoning to it.  You also get your choice of two sides.  For me  it was fries and rice.  Both were excellent representatives of the carb family as were the corn tortillas.  I was also impressed with the salsa bar.  It was clean and there were a good variety of salsas with varying levels of heat.  Plenty of good iced tea available and a variety of Pepsi products and Mexican soft drinks.  This is about as authentic as you can get and still get something of a Tex-Mex experience as well.
El Pollo Rico,5,Thiss was my first experience at El Pollo Rico. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I was craving chicken and was actually heading to Church s  but then I saw this place and decided to try it.  I got the two piece chicken special.  I got a flame broiled leg and thigh that were delicious along with charro beans  Mexican rice  2 corn tortillas  and a drink for  7.69.  Everything was really delicious.  I ll go again.
El Pollo Rico,6,Reminiscent of an old dingy run-down fast food restaurant where you don t really want to think about cleanliness.  Just don t even think about it. Focus on grabbing some chicken or some tacos with meat grilled over wood.  Beef Tacos or Rico Bowls.  Yum.
El Pollo Rico,7,I order online  got charged showed my confirmation number and I didn t get anything because they didn t have the order   Fuck this place   I couldn t even get a refund  
El Pollo Rico,8,The atmosphere isn t great but the place is big with plenty of seating.  The chicken is well seasoned and tasty off the wood grill.  I m not sure it is as good as its neighbor across the street but we can eat in here.  Fried plantains and charro beans the best sides.  Don t forget the salsa bar.  Lots of people having carne asada.
El Pollo Rico,9,Food may be well seasoned and good for value. But customer service is crap.  1. Ordered  they completely forgot  waited 30 minutes  and they looked at my receipt and questioned me as to if I had really not received the food.  2. Asked for a refund  was told no. Which I hadn t pre-tipped  I would have asked for that back too.  3. The lady gave me an option on white and dark meat. Only dark meat came  and seriously pathetic pieces. Their portions have gone down significantly.  Seriously  I ve been to fast food chains that are brand  that know when they messed up and do something to remedy it.
El Pollo Rico,10,I hope this is the right El Pollo I m reviewing  on Lamar near Rundberg . The shredded and roasted chicken is deliciously seasoned  the rice and beans are good authentic Mexican. They sell Madrinas dairy free horchata  yum   I don t think the tortillas are homemade but they re good. The service is nice but nothing special and they usually mess up my order. There is a drive through. Just check your order before you leave.
El Pollo Rico,11,One of the female employees answered the phone. I told her that I wanted to place a to go order  and then she left me on hold for 15 minutes. I hung up and called back  but I got voicemail. Really bad customer service.
El Pollo Rico,12,Salsa s are amazing  chicken is always good and the tostadas are my favorite   Great food when you re looking for something quick  I call in orders often and they re always perfect 
El Pollo Rico,13,Love your food but when you dont answer your phone I just call a different restaurant. 3rd time I ve done it - figured y all should know.
El Pollo Rico,14,Its on the way home  so its easy. I used to prefer the place across the street  but this one is so much easier to get in and out of  so it has become my go to.  They have all your normal El Pollo  name here  foods    a baked potato with carne asada in it.  Nothing has been bad  its all quite delicious. Occasionally the people behind the counter have attitudes  but it doesn t bother me too much. I am here to get some tacos or a chicken and head on out.  Their salsa bar is kind of fun  I like the red sauces here  the green one is great too  but can be a little to full of burn later.  The menu is extensive and they have lots and lots  but I keep going back for the chicken and carna asada. The Mex Mix plate is just about perfect. Its half a chicken and some carne asada with tortillas  onions  and pico. Of course rice and baracho beans in there too.  Should you come here  Yes you should try it out.  What should you order  Chicken or Beef tacos.
El Pollo Rico,15,I love coming here for the chicken that s 5 stars. It s so good. However I dislike the customer service. Some of the employees have a stank face and roll their eyes when you ask for something. Also when you buy a half chicken you get two sides one rice and one beans. Shouldn t the full chicken get 4 sides  Two rice and two beans  Oh and hold the attitude next time please.
El Pollo Rico,16,There s so much to say... I don t even know where to begin. For the longest time I ve espoused Pollo Regio s virtues. Juicy chicken  Great green sauce  Cheap Cheap  And I ve found over the past four years those things have become untrue. In swoops Pollo Rico  pun intended  to cut Regio off at the knees. I wish I was creative enough to write some epic rap battle but you re going to have to settle for the facts about Rico V. Regio.    Regio  Whole chicken meal has gone from  13 to  16  Rico  Still  14  Regio  Has virtually abandoned red salsa. Or at least  they never give it out anymore  even when I specifically request it. Frustrating. Rico  Gives you both red and green  Regio  Famous for their green salsa. Now it s inconsistent flavor means you re either disappointed or on fire. Rico  Like buttah. Spicy  savory  fantastic  Regio  Giving out lemons Rico  Still handing out limes  Regio  Questionable walk up window Rico  Nice indoor restaurant  Regio  75  of the time  chicken is dry where it used to be succulent Rico  Dripping with juice  hot and well seasoned  Rico  Free chips and salsa bar Rico  Free cold cucumbers served with lime  mexican style Rico  Friendly service Rico  Active facebook page Rico  Parking lot that won t result in a 7 way crash  Did I mention they are across the street from each other  RIP Regio. It was real.     I have yet to try the other items on Rico s menu but I m going to assume that they re the same quality or higher than Regios. This review is only for the Pollo Entero meals  
El Pollo Rico,17,Food is not bad  chicken sometimes is juice and fresh sometimes is hard and dry   They keep changing way to serve when they first open they use to serve chips by the salsa bar not any more  I can to the line and ask the cashier for those changes and she said yeah we are not serving chips anymore mm I said well I been to  other  locations and they still serving chips and then she said well we give chips only to those who ask for hahahaahah well I look at her and I said can I ask for it she said ok. Chips were inside the hot box were the chicken is so by the way she is the only one ride server in that place the rest is very nice   They reduce the portions from the whole grill onion to half    that s bad  I may have to try pollo regio next time
El Pollo Rico,18,After a long day of tending to errands  we stopped by quickly at any random area looking for a place to eat since most restaurants were closed due to Easter. The interior was simple looking and for the most part looked like it was well kept. We ordered our food and I cannot comment on whether the server was friendly or not because we did not interact much  but it was overall pleasant. I opted for the Rico Bowl and got it within 5 minutes  It was quite good. My sister got a burger and several items which she said suited her taste  she says this to everything that is edible so.. I cannot really comment on it . In short  I will come back if I can.
El Pollo Rico,19,Went to pollo rico it took 25 minutes to get some tacos and then just to find out my friends tacos are delayed because they ran out of chicken and didnt figure it was important enough to tell us until we asked
El Pollo Rico,20,It d been years since I ve eaten at an El Pollo Rico  but today I stopped in at this location to pick up lunch for the family.  The interior was roomier and cleaner than the other one I d been to that was on North Lamar.  And it the time it took to process my order and put together my order would ve made Jimmy John himself jealous.  I mean freakishly fast   The whole chicken dinner comes with a side of rice  a side of beans  and some corn tortillas that tasted freshly made.  It also came with a couple small cups of salsa which were very good  though there was a larger variety of fresh salsa by the entrance.  I didn t grab any extra salsa since I didn t see any to-go cups there.  But the food was great regardless and there ended up being enough for a second meal.  Tasty  convenient  and affordable - can t ask for much more.
El Pollo Rico,21,El POLLO DELICIOSO        This place is amazing. The chicken will bring you in and the price will bring you back.   The whole charcoal grilled chicken with all of the sides  tortillas  beans  rice  a grilled onion  and limes for 16 bucks is an absolute steal. I have tried to buy all of these items at the store and I come out more expensive. My girlfriend and I can each get 2 meals from the whole meal. If you don t have that many mouths to feed don t fret they also have a 1 2 chicken option.   If you like chicken and haven t tried this place give it a go  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.   I have also had one of the tortas when I was on lunch from work and they are also spot on.  If you want the chicken meal in a nice neat lunch package go with the Rico Bowl.  It is rice  beans  pico de gallo  sour cream  and your choice of beef  chicken  or pastor.  I never finish a whole one but they are only  7.
El Pollo Rico,22,Didn t get to try the food. We wanted to sit down and eat and when we walked in the lady was complaining about the time. It s 9 35. They don t close for another hour and they are saying they are only doing take out orders.
El Pollo Rico,23,The war of the dueling Pollo on Ohlen.  Showdown at noon.  I m actually giving Regio the edge on the taste of their chicken alone.  It s just a little bit better.  However  this place has some major benefits  1. I m not told often that they are out of chicken tacos.  Seriously Regio  if you have whole chickens  you also have the makings of chicken tacos.  I ll wait. 2. A dining room.  Yay for somewhere to wait instead of sketchily skulking in or around my car. 3. Chips and a huge salsa bar for dine in  or while you re waiting  for free. 4. The green sauce I believe is on par with Regios  and they also have a red sauce that s the best  and two other ones if you re not as much into spicy  5.  Marinated onions and peppers and fresh pico.  Here are the downers  1. The chicken is GOOD but not as good as Regio. 2. I can get a plate of tacos from Regio for the same price as two tacos from Rico.  The real deal is that due to the a  dining room b  fact that they ve never told me they re out of something they are actually not out of  and c  they re slightly more convenient on the way home to turn into and park... they re our pollo mainstay.
El Pollo Rico,24,This is like the Taco Bell of Grilled Chicken places. The food is bland and the service is less than stellar. We ate here because it recently opened hoping for some great pollo. What we got was tiny fatty portions of chicken with bland beans and out of the box rice.  Aside from having to wait for the teenager to help us  we also had to remind them that we bought drinks. Never going to eat here again after seeing flies buzzing around the garbage bins inside.   If you want really good grilled pollo go across the street to El Pollo Regio.
El Pollo Rico,25,Very good Mexican style pollo and carne asada. Whole chicken meal comes with charro beans  Mexican rice  and corn tortillas. Chips and salsas are complimentary and very tasty.
El Pollo Rico,26,Been craving chicken for several weeks.   fried chicken   but was tired of the same old places where they always overcook the chicken. This particular night  went to Arby s and was dissatisfied with the food there and still craving chicken  declined to get some to go. Now the inside of this restaurant isn t nothing spectacular  but what was  was the taste of the food. Ordered a half chicken  just by itself and on the drive home  my mouth was watering. Nice sized serving  juicy and the right seasoning.   reminded me of Hulihuli chicken  I used to get back in Hawaii.   Definitely going back     Can t tell you about the taste of the nachos or the beans  but the chicken was Ono.
El Pollo Rico,27,Hey. If your close to this location  try it for a quick lunch. I had a chicken burrito and it was really good. They have a salsa bar for chips and your meal. I cant wait to go back with the lunch bunch at work. Many options but the focus is Mexican style grilled chicken. Ehmm  Pollo. Give a shot folks.
El Pollo Rico,28,That was a tasty chicken.  Too bad I gave half of it away to my mom and sister.  Horchata was mediocre.  Al pastor was bland and flavorless.  Can anyone get this meat right   Always go for chicken at Chicken places.  I see why men should still order for women.   J k      P.S.  Please fix the speakers.
El Pollo Rico,29,Ugh  Came here to pick up chicken only  amp  was over charged for a different item. They couldn t correct it  amp  over charged me  amp  everyone just shrugged their shoulders. Too busy having personal conversations that come in to loiter the establishment than to pay attention to a customer order or to learn how to correct an error.
El Pollo Rico,30,I love the food here. The carne asada is delicious  and that green sauce... THAT GREEN SAUCE    What I -really- don t love is the fact that they simply do not take the time or care to ensure that their delivery orders are correct. I ve ordered the same thing through Uber Eats close to a dozen times  and about half of that time they ve sent me the the wrong order. There s a checklist on the Uber Eats app for selecting your sides  so everything I want is written out  plain as day. There s no excuse for getting it wrong so frequently  and the only explanation is that they just aren t concerned with getting their orders right.  In summary  eat inside the dining room or go through the drivethru - and then check your order before driving away  Don t order through a delivery service  because it means you have a 50  or less shot of getting what you paid for.
El Pollo Rico,31,Not clean at all - it was pretty filthy inside and there was a bad chemical mop soap smell.  Food was ok.
El Pollo Rico,32,Good pollo  good salsas  amp  even better prices   Love their green salsa. Usually order their half chicken meal and it comes with rice and beans and corn tortillas.
El Pollo Rico,33,Tried again this morning. I really like the food  but they can t seem to get their shit together in the mornings. If you are going to open for breakfast  then OPEN for breakfast.      WTF  Please change your hours of operation or BE READY FOR SERVICE IN POSTED HOURS OF OPERATION
El Pollo Rico,34,Today I had the worst roasted I ever bought. In the past  I was a fan of Pollo Rico. Today s chicken was so dry  it was nearly inedible. It tasted like it was roasted two days ago and left on the warmer. The skin was nicely seasoned but rubbery and gross. I order chips and queso  but they were out.   I hate wasting food and money. I decided to chop the chicken meat and make salad. Even with the addition of mayo  it was still too dry.  For less than a third the price  the warehouse clubs have better rotisserie chicken. Even HEB s is far better. YUCK   The good news  the beans weren t awful. The flour tortillas were only slightly rubbery  and the rice wasn t as dry as the chicken.
El Pollo Rico,35,First time customer. The food  sides and sauces were great. That was the highlight    The parking lot and entrance were littered with debris and very unsightly   The front doors had so many hand prints and smudges.  It looked like it hadn t been cleaned since the 90 s.  The cashier had no enthusiasm and seemed as if she wanted to be somewhere else.  Loud noises from the kitchen were distracting. Thank goodness the food was good but I will go across the street to their rival from now on
El Pollo Rico,36,Place smelled good  staff was quite friendly  Place looked clean and the food was prepared very quickly.  My only complaint is that my cuesadea was quite greasy.. However it tasted really pretty good  It cost me  8 flat. Would eat here again in a pinch.
El Pollo Rico,37,Strange place.   Not sure how I feel about it.   Clearly lots of new opening bugs to work out.   Only half full of tables.  Menus on tv screens that keep changing milking it hard to order.     Counter girl didn t speak any English.    Food prep time slow.    Aqua fresca really tasty.    Gordita t so so
El Pollo Rico,38,Disappointed at best. Expensive for what you get. Food was not fresh at 7pm. Try pollo regio 200ft away 
El Pollo Rico,39,I have had the whole chicken with beans and rice before so I decided to try the quesadilla. I got chicken with guac  sour cream  and green salsa. I must say that I was impressed. There aren t a lot of places in Austin to get good Mexican food on the go so I may frequent here more often. I do think  8 is a bit much with no drink included but it was filling without any sides.
El Pollo Rico,40,Check the reviews for El Pollo Rico before making a decision to eat here. There are more there to give a more accurate picture of this restaurant. My experience was not good here and truly feel it is a health risk from what I saw when I was there. My chicken seemed leftover and reheated   it was very dry.
El Pollo Rico,41,After this place opened I was curious what kind of food they served  quality  price  service . Finally I stopped in.   Like the rest of the surrounding area  it is helpful if you at least know some spanish. The people working the counters are friendly and will provide catering service.  But they have problems clearly comprehending English. Still they are very friendly and courteous. They will work hard to get your order right.   Your order is custom made. You go to your table and wait for it to be brought to you. Although this place is now a  fast food resturant  in it s previous incarnation it used to be an IHOPand the structure loopks strange with several of the tables taken outand the customer seating area still physically here. These people want you to seat yourself after you place your own order. It took me a while to figure this out    When my order finally came  the portion size was HUGE. I had only ordered one quesadilla--just wanting a quick snack. But I was stuffed. I can t imagine how full I would feel if I ordered any of the complete meals on the menu.WOW   I  was stuffed and happy after my snack.   I tasted at least three different cheeses in my order--definently authentic mexican food. I definently see why the food is priced as it is even though it comes out to you on a styrofoam plate. And you use plastic utensills to eat it. This was well worth the cost.    The only bad thing about this place is that the exterior looks more  upscale  which when compared to the long-standing mexicn grill  shack  immediately next door or the surrounding area. I was one of the very few people inside the dinning room--which even in the reconfiguration  was set up to seat many more people than was currently seating. It was not a busy night at all. If I wanted to  and had room   I could have gone back and ordered another quesadilla because they were not busy at all.    Unless you re familar with the product brand or consider the pricing a necessary trade off for food quality  you re not going to eat at this place. It s in a part of Austin where people don t have a lot extra money to eat out. I hope they are able to stick around.
El Pollo Rico,42,I have been going to the one on north Lamar this past year  but used to go to the one on Runberg by Jack in the box  the chicken has always been good in both locations  but the last 3 out of 4 times the Lamar location has forgot something on my order  the 1st time no limes  I let it go  the 2nd time no grilled onions with the chicken  then today 1 11 19 I go in and tell teh young lady about my onion last time and she just kind of smiled but didn t say anything  so she went to get my order and I ask her is the onion in there and she said yes they put it in with the chicken  well obviously they miss some because I didn t get one  well anyway I m late for work so I leave  this is about 4 45 pm  I work from 5 30 pm til 2 Am  and take lunch at 9 30 pm. I m hungry too thinking about that grill chicken and onion on the tortilla with that green sauce  keep in mind I ask her to check for the onion which she didn t but she really should have made sure everything is correct  so I open the bag and eat the beans with a little rice mixed  very good  so now I m ready to eat . NO  UCKING TORTILLAS  I m so pissed that I m confused. I call the store and told the young lady no tortillas   she said you close you can come get some  I told her let me speak to the manager  now this what really pissed me off I hear her ask the manager if he could speak with me and he said he was too busy  WHAT I eat here all the time and he too busy to speak to one of his customers  I told her I wasn t going to eat it and will bring it back tomorrow for a refund  then I will drive to the other location and get my chicken. Poor customer service. Austin Texas
El Pollo Rico,43,I selected this restaurant because of Uber eats. I was really amazed at the quality of our dishes  I had the half-chicken plate and my husband had the Carna Asada .  Everything was fresh  nicely seasoned and well-prepared. We will definitely return to try more of their menu items.
El Pollo Rico,44,We got the Chicken  Beans  Rice. It was very good  Kind of tasted like we were back home in Laredo in a good way..lol . We will be going back. I think the A C was out but this Mexican pulled through.
El Pollo Rico,45,Food was fine but service was horrible. That s what I get for betraying my first love  El Pollo Regio  across the street.
El Pollo Rico,46,Small chicken parts  looked and tasted about 4 days old. It was also dry. The beans had a good flavor. The plate and portion sizes were excellent for a kids meal. My daughter had the burger and it was huge. I m disappointed. First time and won t be returning.
El Pollo Rico,47,Beans and flautas were good.  They were confused by our order and we had to wait a while to receive all our food.  The manager gave us a cheesecake for the mishap.
El Pollo Rico,48,They sell chicken   mine was Cooked sometime before I arrived like several hours.  Food was warm.  They boast the bladest rice and beans I had in awhile.  They also offer cold stale chips if you want them. Next time will eat across the street
El Pollo Rico,49,This was my first time here. I tried the newly opened location on 183 and Ohlen. Prices are reasonable for food was terrible. I had 2 tacos al pastor with rice and beans. The al pastor lacked flavor and was VERY greasy. The beans were cold and rice was nothing special. I gave it a shot but won t be coming back. Even Taco Cabana is better.
