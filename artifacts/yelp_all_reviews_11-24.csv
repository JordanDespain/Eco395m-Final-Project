Lazarus Brewing,1,Love this place. Always easy to find a spot. Space outside is great and the food is simple but nice.
Lazarus Brewing,2,Great tacos  Coffee  Really nice bartenders and servers  very helpful for out of towners .
Lazarus Brewing,3,I m dropping you a star.  If you claim to play World Cup you may want more than one television. I m down with having an event to draw people but make sure you can support it. Don t claim World Cup and have one television. This honestly annoyed me. I wasted my time coming here vs so many other places. I know it s not a sports bar and I love that fact but DO NOT claim World Cup or any other televised event with one television. It s a joke and the owner is lost if he thinks one TV checks the box.  So if you want to attend and event just don t bother with Lazarus. If you want a good time that isn t aligned with an event then this place is boss   I genuinely like this place but the sad attempt to draw business for an event is weak. Don t bother  go elsewhere for those things.  You guys need at least 3 televisions only for these events. Don t advertise otherwise.
Lazarus Brewing,4,Eh  it was okay. Was in Austin last month and searched Yelp for places to get a bite and a beer or cider. This place looked great  but the food was just borderline okay. We had the quest  which I was excited to try because of reviews  but was not my favorite. The tacos  about the same. Service was nothing put of the ordinary.
Lazarus Brewing,5,I had so much fun here   There is a ton of outdoor seating.  This ranges from an outside bar facing the street with bar stools  small outdoor tables  to larger picnic tables.  There is also some indoor seating but not as expansive as the outdoor.  The food and beer was great   I got a hazy ipa and quesadilla.  Options were limited compared to some places  but I like that because it makes the decision process easier.  For beers  there were about 1 option for each kind of beer.  Example  1 hazy  1 double hazy  1 Oktoberfest  1 German Pilsner.  The menu said they don t have quesadillas everyday   but tacos are always an option.   Service was friendly and quick for the most part.  You order food at the bar and they bring it to you.  It took a little while to come out  but I wasn t in a hurry.
Lazarus Brewing,6,Great beers and food  They have a huge patio and it was packed at three in the afternoon. Fun  upbeat vibe. I had their Street Tacos and they were delicious. The line to order was long but the food came out pretty quick. My cousin had the Torta and she really liked it. Lots of dogs on the patio which was cool. They had Mexican Coke  which is always a plus.
Lazarus Brewing,7,Stopped at Lazarus Brewing after landing in Austin. Met our son and his wife here for some beers and a bite for lunch. Plenty of street parking available. Place has outdoor beer garden and an indoor bar area.  Beer for me and a white wine for my wife. Ordered a carnitas torta for my wife and a chicken chipotle rice bowl for me. The food and the beer went very well together. Maybe it was because we were famished  we left our house at 3am to catch the flight from Newark International. Love trying the local breweries when traveling and Lazarus didn t disappoint.
Lazarus Brewing,8,i love this brewery  it has so much outdoor seating with some covered and uncovered. it s in a great area in east austin where you can just park and bar hop down the street. it has amazing food  particularly their queso and quesadilla. they have a great selection of beer and awesome merchandise. their cold brew is pretty delicious too  probably my favorite brewery in the austin area.  also  they have oktoberfest going on and their giant glass steins are  25 with  10 refills. pretty cool.
Lazarus Brewing,9,We had a negative experience waiting at Counter Caf  and decided to walk next door and try Lazarus. Blessing in disguise    Lazarus is counter service and they offer plenty of seating both inside and on their expansive patio. Breakfast ends at 1pm and is quite delicious.   The torte was quite filling and the tacos were just as delicious. We were pleasantly surprised as to how good the drip coffee is.
Lazarus Brewing,10,It s cool place to hang out with your co colleagues after work or friends and family. Also nice place for a date night . Casual and u find yourself plenty of drinks to choose from and food is pretty decent . My favorite was Queso Fondito. Good for appetizer. I got rice bowl with Asada and loved mine . Hubby got street tacos and said they are pretty good. I will definitely come here again. If you are looking quite place this is not the place since they music is on louder side but we didn t mind it.
Lazarus Brewing,11,We came here as a large group one Friday evening and were fortunate to score their couch seating area  which worked perfectly for our group.  The staff is friendly.  It s nice that they offer wine for those of us who were their to hang out  not to drink beer.  The place is very loud and gets crazy crowded.  Parking is very tough in this area as well.
Lazarus Brewing,12,Wanted to go to a brewery with food after a long day of activities.  Lazarus did not disappoint   Super relaxed vibe  great selection of beer and delicious street tacos     We tried the carnitas  brisket and al pastor.  Our favorite was the carnitas..so good we ordered one more for each person.  2 tacos are big enough...I got 3 since I was ravenous from such an active day.    The service here is on point   We sat at the bar and witnessed an amazing team at work - Kina  Victoria  Adam and James   Despite of being such a busy  the staff really took care of us - never once did we have to wait too long to ask for anything.   James seemed like he had two sets of arms  ears and eyes - attentive  efficient and friendly 
Lazarus Brewing,13,Great spot for get together with family  friends and colleagues. Even if you don t like beer  still a fun spot to meet up at.
Lazarus Brewing,14,I enjoyed this spot over on the east side. It was a nice place to hangout and work on a Thursday- they have great coffee and sell tacos tostadas etc. Their beer is also great  and I find it neat you can see them making it during the day.   Patio seating is available with shade and fans for larger groups. The parking is pretty tight- don t park in the lot next door as they tow- but there is street parking nearby.   Their coffee drinks and tacos are good. I highly recommend the carnitas street taco. The coffee was solid but nothing made it stand out  and it was on the pricey side. They also serve mimosas for a casual brunch spot.  Overall recommend as a chill hangout spot.
Lazarus Brewing,15,1st time  Great spot  great selection  a lot of indoor and outdoor seating.  Friendly staff  worth checking out.
Lazarus Brewing,16,Great tacos with great beers  what more can you ask for   We came in on a hot afternoon. We were so grumpy from the heat  but the beers saved us from a fight  D. On top of that  we could not stop eating their tacos. The pollo verde had the perfect taste   It was an amazing experience
Lazarus Brewing,17,I ve had the chance to visit a few times now and I love the massive outdoor space they feature. I always tell myself I ll come here for coffee  but somehow I always end up with a beer. What is this witchcraft I keep falling under  Lucky for me their beers  mainly their IPAs  are so good that I have no problem being under the Lazarus spell.  They have a few bites for you to enjoy and the ordering system is super easy. Can we all appreciate how beautiful the woodwork is and those member glasses goblets that stand proudly in display.   The team at Lazarus is super laid back and very inviting.
Lazarus Brewing,18, visited October 2021  A friend visited about a month prior and reccomend we stop here  so we did  Ordered queso  tacos and beer  Simple ordering process and the staff was super helpful when trying to figure out what beer I d like  the one I originally chose was out . Food came out quick and was amazing  especially the chips  amp  queso  Enjoyed eating our meal outside and just relaxing. Great brewery vibes   food
Lazarus Brewing,19,Back a few years later and even better then I remembered  It s gotten a larger patio and an additional indoor spot  service is quick  and the food is still amazing. We loved the carne asada and the pico  red chips were awesome too . Their light beers hit the spot on a hot day 
Lazarus Brewing,20,This was our first time and we were very happy to enjoy a sunset brew and tacos on their spacious patio. The outdoor seating is great for large groups and pups. The service was pleasant and laid back  but we did get everything pretty fast despite the place being nearly full. We tried the 86 Mike  Brown ale   Amandus  Belgian   and the queso fundido. The queso is large enough to share and came with the perfect amount of crisp and tasty chips. The beers were smooth and suited my preferences. We also tried the shrimp taco Gobernador. The tortillas were great-tasting corn  which is saying much coming from a flour tortilla lover. We enjoyed this place and will return for breakfast soon.
Lazarus Brewing,21,Lazarus is a great spot to grab a drink with lots of outdoor  and indoor  seating. It was pretty chill on a Sunday evening and had a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Great variety of beers on tap and lots of unique flavors as well  Looking forward to going back and trying out the food.
Lazarus Brewing,22,If you aren t eating here  you re missing out. The vibe here is beyond cool. Awesome outdoor and indoor area. Amazing helpful  friendly staff. And the food and drink here are so so soooooo good. The best queso fundido and homemade chips one could imagine. The carnitas taco was the bomb too   For drinks we had the sweet cherry cider and the IPA  wish I could remember the name.... Closed road    Sorry....  was  so damn good . I want to be here daily and work through the remainder of the menu    UPDATE  the IPA was called holding pattern and the cider was called cherry red city orchard.
Lazarus Brewing,23,I have been here once before with my brother. The concept and the location itself are lovely. What was lacking was a service.   My brother and I went to the bar to order a flight of beers. The menus are all taped to the bar so you can t actually look at them unless you re standing in front of the register. So I scanned the QR code to check and see what was available. We chose and then waited in line. When I got to the front we ordered our flight.   She proceeded to tell us that a few of the beers we had chosen from the menu online were not available. Please have an up-to-date menu if you re going to pull the QR nonsense. Otherwise  spend a few cents to print menus so your guests know what they can order .   We then asked her about some of the beers and the flight size. The server was so rude and didn t look us in the eye. I understand that it s a Saturday  but I am a server too and work weekends - you can look at us when you re talking to us. She was very short with us and very rude. She did the bare minimum and charged us our money and went on with her day. I would ve loved a bit of explanation about the beers.  Tip  The flights are four 8-ounce pours which is quite large. It s easily shareable with two people. The biblical theme of beers  stained glass windows  and Bible stories  is very fun.
Lazarus Brewing,24,Five stars all around  Awesome atmosphere  friendly service  great beer selection  Llama hair and Prodigal pils are my favorites    and delicious tacos  We ve already returned for a second visit during our stay in Austin and plan to return again before we fly home.
Lazarus Brewing,25,Stopped in for after work hour catch up w some coworkers and it s a nice spot. Has indoor and outdoor seating options. Some food  mostly apps to choose from. Only had the chips and pico and the pico was super fresh and had a good fresh but healthy amount of spicy kick to it. I m not a beer fan so I was happy to see they had wine options and they also have hard cider options but just have to ask what are the specials that week. Overall it s a good atmosphere  if you re lucky enough to get front parking but otherwise parking around the side is also available.
Lazarus Brewing,26,Big fan of Laz. The staff are all so fantastic and friendly- all the way from the bartenders to Eduardo grabbing dishes. I m looking forward to the cool weather when the stouts come back because they are so good  but their funky sours and summer beers don t disappoint.   They are opening a second location and selling one beer every day forever. Check out their website and join 
Lazarus Brewing,27,Thursday late afternoon - stopped by here to check out yet another brewery on the street. Mostly packed with people working on laptops  but the open air setup doesn t make it feel too crowded.  Was able to quickly get a seat at the bar and order from the scannable menus. Decided on the Prodigal Pills   6  to go along with a Breakfast Taco   3.50 . Pilsener is light and crushable  though not much flavor. Breakfast taco comes out fast - packed with eggs  cheese  pico de gallo  and bacon. Thankfully not a stale tortilla and even balance of ingredients. Finished the day off with the Double Predestination IPA   7 - definitely more of a kick  possible some overkill on the hops.   Service is a bit hectic as the bartenders work off the many tables. Fine spot to relax  especially outside where there are tables available.
Lazarus Brewing,28,We didn t try any of the food here but had some really solid beers. It was our favorite brewery that we checked out during our quick weekend trip. They also sell coffee as well  so I d love to come back and try those coffee drinks. We sat at the bar. Super chill vibe  nice employees.
Lazarus Brewing,29,We checked this place out during a quick visit to Austin. We really enjoyed the laid back vibe of this brewery. There was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating  with fans . We loved that they offered breakfast and lunch food and drink options. We tried the street tacos and hazy IPAs. Everything was delicious  Can t wait to come back again.
Lazarus Brewing,30,I love Lazarus. As someone who was diagnosed with Celiac back in 2019  I ve been dying for a good gluten-free beer. Lazarus offers SO many options  Their outdoor patio is spacious  a great place to WFH or just enjoy a Saturday afternoon   and their food is mostly gluten-free as well  just avoid the torta  the quesadilla  and any flour tortillas when ordering tacos . Have I gushed about their chips and guac yet     My only recommendation  If possible  please add allergy info to the food menu
Lazarus Brewing,31,We just had coffee here at this brewery roastery. I dunno- the first sip tasted like beer  but it grew on us...  I wasn t as happy about all the dogs in the restaurant. Some people like that- we don t...
Lazarus Brewing,32,Love the old converted garage vibe and the outdoor space. Beer and food both good. The guac had a extra Limey flavor that I loved. Tacos were also really good  my favorite being the al pastor. All the meats were moist and fresh.
Lazarus Brewing,33,You wouldn t think of good tasting tacos at a brewery. I can t speak for the beer because I didn t order beer and don t drink it  but the Carne Asada tacos were a hit. The guacamole and chips were my favorite  too. I paired this with a side of ros  wine.
Lazarus Brewing,34,This place is awesome  They have a huge beer selection  and you won t find anything bad on the list. They also have awesome tacos... which always go great with beer  They have live music sometimes  and last night s band was amazing. Very spacious outdoor area. You must check this place out 
Lazarus Brewing,35,Gluten-free beer   Enough said since a friend can only drink it.  Huge covered and uncovered patio with fans and misters everywhere  lots of nooks to drink in indoors and open to outdoors  great coffee and food too.  The tortas are amazing.  Friendly and helpful staff.  5 stars.
Lazarus Brewing,36,Just had the rice bowl with verde pollovery good has some spice. Also tried chips and guac . Also frank a flight which was an assortment of my choice. They had about twelve beers on Tap. Place is nice but was here on hottest day of the year and place is partial open to patio so warm inside even with fans and ac. But worth a try
Lazarus Brewing,37,Yum  What a fun place and good vibes for a big group. And the tacos were good  I wouldn t say it was the best or most authentic street tacos but it hit the spot just fine. It s a dog friendly place but if you re wanting to sit inside  let s aren t allowed because it s against health code. They have plenty of seating outdoors and you can also reserve a room for reservations if you have a big party. Beer was good and they also have a 20  off promo for wine if you order a whole bottle on Tuesdays 
Lazarus Brewing,38,First brewery stop in Austin and it did not disappoint. Great options and loved the atmosphere.  Service was great and staff were nice.  Again  the seating options and drink choices were a huge bonus. Coffee beverages looked delicious. Friend got an espresso and recommended it.  Locale is fantastic as well. Very accessible.  Would definitely recommend 
Lazarus Brewing,39,Good spot to chill with friends. I came here last weekend with my husband to meet up with some out-of-state friends who were visiting. Their guacamole and tacos were good and so was their beer selection. I honestly don t remember which one we got  but just had whatever the servers recommended and they were all good.  The outdoor seating area was nice at night with the hanging lights and is dog friendly  always a bonus for us  .   Street parking is close to impossible to find in the area  but there s paid garage parking. It is pricey  but the only spot we were able to find that wasn t too far from Lazarus.
Lazarus Brewing,40,I wish they had more beer options but we got the Pilsner and one of their Belgian beers. Both tasty.  The atmosphere is great for hanging  day drinking  or even work related meetings. They have a huge patio space and the inside is also nice to hang.  Overall where they excel at  is their tacos  I got the carnitas and asada thinking  4 for a taco was too much... but then I got them and they are bigger than expected. My bf got the two chicken tacos and we ate them soooo slow just because they had so much flavor and the meat was so tender. I d go just for the tacos every time. Hats off to the cook 
Lazarus Brewing,41,Lazarus has become a must on my trips to Austin. I was there in the middle of the day on a weekday  was planning to work from their patio  and it seems thats a pretty common practice  I saw tons of other people with their laptops enjoying beer food wifi on the patio. The Queso fundido is too large of a dipping challenge for chips so you have you fork knife it onto your chip  but it was SO good
Lazarus Brewing,42,Amazing vibes   We are visit Austin and this place is a must  Dog friendly and the beer is super tasty.
Lazarus Brewing,43,We brought a large group here the day after a wedding. It is often challenging to plan an activity for dozens of people  or to find the space. We decided we didn t need to bother reserving space as many people would come and go during the day. Ultimately most people stayed as the beer  coffee  and food were great. We were also able to secure about four continuous tables which was great to host our family and friends.   I plan to come back as I ve heard their beers are gluten reduced as well.
Lazarus Brewing,44,I ve been here twice and each time was a different experience. If I were rating solely on my most recent visit on a late Sunday around 8 30  it would be 2 stars. The beertender literally saw me walk in off 6th before a tech bro on the side closest to him  saw me  then proceeded to serve the other guy...the line was so short with only 2 people  one of which was me. So I walked over to the other area  amp  he walked away. Luckily another server saw me and helped. Not sure if he was judging me bc I was wearing a mask  I m traveling hence being in Austin ...but check your self brah. If this review was based on him alone  I d say f this place.   BUT I m basing this review on my beer experience and that is a solid 3-4 star. I had the winter warmer during my first visit and it was tastier than others I ve had. More recently I had the lightning wolf IPA which was a bit more watered down than i was expecting. Still flavorful  less hazy than I thought it would be  and very subtle.
Lazarus Brewing,45,Lazarus Brewing is great  Lots of different beer options. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. It is also dog friendly. Staff was super nice and helpful 
Lazarus Brewing,46,Combine great beer  Amandus   patio  live music sometimes and huge   food and location...tough to beat. Thus I come here very very often
Lazarus Brewing,47,Very good IPA beer. The melted cheese and chips were not worth the money. Melted cheese with no flavor and house made chips didn t cut it for the price.
Lazarus Brewing,48,If I were a local  this would be my hangout spot. The beers were superb. I got a Disco Prophet  a strawberry lemonade sour  and a Big Sky IPA - delicious and refreshing.  But the real star was the appetizers. We got chips and fresh guacamole  which paired excellently with the beer. But the real winner was the fried chickpeas  which were like seasoned corn nuts  I ve never had anything like that  and it s enough for 3-4 people to share  despite only being  3.  The place was clean  staff was friendly  and there was plenty of seating. Definitely a must-see brewery if you re in the area.
Lazarus Brewing,49,Excellent tacos and even better beer  My big compliant is that they need some ac or fans because it is hot inside. In fact  the people at the other table near me were using paper fans which goes to show you how hot it is inside.
Lazarus Brewing,50,Good beer  fine service at the counter though wish they served coffee at night too. Having a cockroach crawl on you twice in the course of 30 minutes while sitting on the patio--NOT awesome  
Lazarus Brewing,51,Good quality beer with a variety of awesome food. This European style brewery always seems to have something going on.   Showed up on a Thursday evening for dinner and was impressed with the amount of people who were here. There is picnic table seating out back with tents in the front for additional seating. There is also plenty of seating inside. There is plenty of seating but the like to order may take some time to get through  so plan accordingly.   I went with the torta as my meal. The bread was authentic and the fillings inside were great. If I had to change one thing I would have asked to get the torta with chorizo although it isn t listed as a protein for the sandwich.   This is a great local spot to check out and a place I will most likely be a regular at.
Lazarus Brewing,52,So fancy  We showed up just in time for the great weather. The beer and the food are both equally good  Great patio vibes and plenty of parking for easy in and easy out.
Lazarus Brewing,53,This place has plenty of outdoor seating with fans that keep the flies at bay mostly. The inside was nice and they have everything you d need to hit the spot. Tacos and beer.   The beer was pretty good. The only sour beer they had at the time was a Ros  flavored one that unfortunately tasted a little too much like wine  but was still digestible. My hazy IPA was not hazy at all  but was still fine. I wish the beers were served a bit colder.   The fried chickpeas were a good deal for  3 we thought they could serve like 10 people. The 2 of us only made a dent in like 1 5 of the bowl. But hey  they re snacky so maybe someone could down the whole thing if they really wanted to   The carnitas taco was really good. I highly recommend it. The al pastor was alright but didn t pack the flavor punch of the carnitas. I doused my tacos in the free salsa that was in a mini fridge nearby. The red salsa was so good and added a layer of light smokiness to my tacos. But then after a while I thought I sensed some heat  I assumed it was the green salsa so I continued to douse my tacos in the red. Idk it must have been the red salsa that was hot  because by the end of my meal I was feeling sick to my stomach. Never felt that way from spice but needless to say the beer didn t taste too good after that either. Luckily I recuperated by sipping 2 glasses of their Yeti water until I didn t want to vomit anymore.   I can t place my distaste after this meal on the restaurant since it was mostly my own doing . I assume they label their salsas and I just didn t see it.
Lazarus Brewing,54,Great tasting beer paired with some awesome quesadillas. Outside seating was nice with fans misting water.
Lazarus Brewing,55,My wife and I were in Austin for a long weekend and this could be the best tap room I have been to in a long time. Tons of outdoor seating and great free water. I got the 40 Days and 40 Nights and the Lil  Sebastion Bach Maibock and the Walking on Water.   I ordered 3 beers and they were spectacular and the service was splendid. I ordered an al pastor taco and the carne asada tacos. They were super flavorful and perfect  especially for a tap room.  I got a couple of stickers and the atmosphere was just fantastic. You should definitely try this place 
Lazarus Brewing,56,Brought my sister here because she was visiting and wanted to try some breweries. I d also never been so it was a good chance to try something new. Lazarus just became my favorite brewery in Austin. Excellent vibe  great beer and plenty of space to sit and chill and chat.
Lazarus Brewing,57,Got the kolsch and enjoyed it. Chill vibe nice environment  nice staff. Easy parking.
Lazarus Brewing,58,Hands down the best brewery experience we encountered in Austin. It s a little bit if everything and that s not at all a bad thing as without exception they are all done well. We saw they were open early so we went in on a weekday thinking we could knock this off our list of a full day planned. We weren t real clear on their hours entailed so there was a not so unwelcome idea of a little day   morning drinking to get the day started. We realized this was going to leave us with the opportunity to have a few small samples or perhaps one nice pour. Upon our arrival we were impressed at how the location spanned the corner of the street and had many  compartments  of seating areas. I m no way were Amy of them on the smaller side. Street parking was easy enough and we headed on in.   Very impressed to be greeted with smiling faces along with plenty of good morning exchanges. We were very pleasantly surprised to see they offered an array of espresso drinks. What a welcome pivot to our plan. We ordered up and came to realize they had food as well. Pretty happy about that. There were the assorted pastry items and breakfast TACOS  I noticed there was also queso fondido on the menu and that was screaming please try me. I went to order and was told this item is generally served later in the day. I suspect my sadness to hear this news showed as there was a quick offer to fire up the required kitchen equipment to make this happen  the salamander for those curious .   The lattes were delicious. So much so we ordered up a second round. Near completion of those the awesome cheesy chorizo goodness arrived. Bubbly hot and looking superb. It was all I could do to keep myself from grabbing a chip and putting a scoop of this bubbling sub nuclear cheese in my mouth at the price of completely burning my entire mouth. With a little patience I snuck a few small bites being mindful to blow as to not scorch my mouth. OMG was this delicious in every aspect.   Right away we knew this was just fine with a latte but was screaming for a beer to accompany this perfect breakfast fast. Such an awesome selection of beers. The bartender was beyond sweet and gave us many short pull samples of the tappers. I landed on the one that worked for me. My wife found one that worked well for her. By the time the beers arrived it was clear this was not going to be a short stop. Instead it was clear this was our impromptu plan for the morning. Completely five star experience from the word go. So much so we took the liberty of an evening stop later that week. The vibe of this place was so cool with any hint of pretentiousness. I m no expert on all the brew options in Austin but this was clearly number one for us based on all it included and the absolute outstanding hospitality from the coffee bar to the bartender to the cook who brought us the miraculously amazing queso. No matter you plans I would highly suggest  in fact nearly insist this is a stop not to be missed. This reviews has been locked in draft land fir a while but there is no doubt this place is still thriving and for all the right reasons.
Lazarus Brewing,59,I have come to Lazarus Brewing twice in the past couple months. The first time during SXSW and the 2nd for a Yelp event. Both times were a nice experience  I love the mix of outdoor and indoor spaces to choose from. During SXSW there was a stage for the bands  and this most recent time I came it was full with seating again. The pico dip and chips was amazing and I will back for it 
Lazarus Brewing,60,This brewery was walking distance from our air bnb when visiting Austin. It quickly became our favorite spot and we went back a couple times. Beer was delicious and staff was extremely friendly. They also offer other things besides beer. There s a lot of space here too. All around gem 
Lazarus Brewing,61,We must have visited on the wrong day.  There were just 7-8 beers on the menu and nothing really intrigued us.  I went with my favorite kind which is a stout on nitro.  I hate wasting beer but I drank just half.  Not only were the beers not flavorful but they were not cold.    I will say their tacos were really good  and the place is super huge.  For a Monday it was pretty packed at lunch  but still spacious enough to stay 6-feet away if desired.  It s not hard to find a seat bc the place is sooo big.    Wouldn t come back for the beer  but for the tacos   Yaaassss 
Lazarus Brewing,62,Casual atmosphere with a cute outdoor patio area  great drinks  and delicious tacos  I m not a huge fan of beer  but luckily  they ve got ciders  I think the flavors they had when I was there were  paloma  rose  and cherry. I got the paloma and rose ciders  and they were so delicious  Paloma for its fruitiness  rose for its sweetness. I got the carnitas taco with avocado  and that was quite flavorful  hit the spot     Definitely recommend for grabbing drinks and bites with a friend 
Lazarus Brewing,63,Best beer in town and great place to hang.  Also chips and guacamole are fireeee   Go on a Saturday and you can check out live music
Lazarus Brewing,64,A new favorite find  New Year s Eve could not be better remembered. Love the ambiance  including the music playlist. The patio is simply perfect. The beer variety has something for everyone and the tacos are a handy nibble option.
Lazarus Brewing,65,Food is fresh  amp  good. Good beer variety  amp  good atmosphere. Been a couple times but most recently stopped by hoping to catch an out of network NFL game  amp  grab some grub pre ACL - 3 tacos  chips  huge bag   amp  very decent sized serving of guac to go - ab  30 w tip... felt reasonable and was tasty. Kinda wish they had TVs or at least one screen for the early NFL games during fall  
Lazarus Brewing,66,I have been to Lazarus multiple times and over the weekend had a horrible experience. They close at 11 and at 11 07  an employee came up to our table and told us  I have to take your beers  its way past closing time . I had half of my beer left when she ran us out. I have never had this kind of service and she was extremely rude.
Lazarus Brewing,67,I love the atmosphere of this place    they have a very very large outdoor area  and there is a lot of room for big groups. I was disappointed that my glass was not full- a good amount of foam. They don t have many sour or cider options so if you don t like beer don t really recommend coming here.
Lazarus Brewing,68,Great place to hang out. I wouldn t go in the daytime summer heat. So many flys and moisture made it an atmosphere for more to be desired.  That being said  everything else was fantastic  service and consumables 
Lazarus Brewing,69,This is a great spot for drinks and they also have non alcoholic drinks at night too like chai and matcha lattes. There s also plenty of seating.
Lazarus Brewing,70,This place is awesome. Very hip place to work with your laptop. It is also dog friendly and there is easy parking outside. They have wonder Queso con Cherros.l along with a yummy taco selection. It s beer is also good but so heavy for me.   There are benches outside and inside a c seating. I strongly recommend checking out this hipster place  
Lazarus Brewing,71,By coincidence I happened to have meetups at Lazarus two nights in a row. Last night I got the  Rajas Quesadilla  and I know it will be my go-to order if I ever come back. It was slightly too big and too spicy  but worth it. I thought the corn and peppers inside  and the included crema and guacamole balanced out the rich cheesiness and the spices baked into the tortilla.
Lazarus Brewing,72,I wanted to try this place but a 30 min line just to get a drink is insane. You would think they would have more than like 4 bartenders. Very thankful for the fans and misters but seriously only two cars and a 30 min line to get a drink for each one is insane.
Lazarus Brewing,73,This place has a great vibe. We were here on a chilli Tuesday night for drinks and dinner. We were greeted by the host who informed us about their COVID-19 rules. We order upfront and pay  we were given a number and then waiter would bring us the food. You can take off mask at the table. There was a decent amount of crowd but every one was socially distant.   We had a combination of tacos that consisted of carne asada  carnitas and chipotle chicken. All of them were very delicious. If you don t like cilantro then please say that upfront when you order otherwise you will be surprised to see a bunch of cilantro and onions on your taco. Nevertheless I really enjoyed my dinner and drinks here. I felt safe and had a great time.
Lazarus Brewing,74,I love Lazarus  Awesome vibe  good beer  great tacos quesadillas and ample street parking 
Lazarus Brewing,75,Super cute spot to hang out with friends  They have a ton of outdoor seating and can accommodate large parties. We had about 20 people in our group and we were able to pull up tables and chairs for everyone.   The place is really well decorated so we were able to snap a few cute pictures 
Lazarus Brewing,76,First off I m really happy with how dog friendly  covered patio vibes with heaters this place is. Beer was solid  not big of a menu but just enough.  Coffee was a big plus.  No TVs so don t try to catch a game here but it seemed like they had WiFi. Parking was a little hard in the area. Would give it 5 stars but there was too much smoking in the area for my liking.
Lazarus Brewing,77,I love Lazarus  This has quickly become one of my favorite spots in Austin- whether you re there for coffee and tacos in the morning or high quality brews at night  you really can t go wrong at Lazarus.   I showed up on a Saturday afternoon and ended up staying until after dinner  The ambiance is fantastic- with ample seating both indoors and outdoors and picnic tables for groups of all sizes  Lazarus attracts all kinds  from people working from home to big parties.   The tacos were really great  We ordered the pollo verde and al pastor tacos and they were fantastic. They were a great portion to pair with drinks and while the line seemed long the service was really quick.   Overall  this is a great spot for regulars and I ve found myself returning for a reliably good time.
Lazarus Brewing,78,Stopped in for a cold one after a nooner. COVID restrictions firmly in place. Pretty good beer. We had a few. Chips and pico were great. Hear the tacos are great. Lots of outdoor seating in the shade and under the mister fans. Mutts welcome.   But the couple with the screaming 2 year old needs to go back to San Diego...
Lazarus Brewing,79,Breakfast tacos and coffee to queso and beer  That s my kind of establishment.  Lazarus is mostly patio seating and is very spacious  with covering and misters if you need that . It s also dog friendly.  They ve taken safety seriously and there are a lot of extra measures in place so you can dine out comfortably.  They also sell their beer to-go 
Lazarus Brewing,80,Enjoyed their two  Best Sellers   40 Days  amp  40 Nights and Lightning Wolf.  Both were good.  The 40D amp N with a light IPA that finished clean. The Wolf had a citrus essence  but definitely not a  hazy  in body or mind.  Ended with Shackleton.  I m partial to IPAs and 40D amp N was a different take on the American IPA  but it was well worth it.  A great beer.  Between beers  I also enjoyed a carnitas taco and a chipotle chicken one.  Both were very good.  The outdoor seat and free Wi-Fi make this a good place for travelers to kill time.
Lazarus Brewing,81,Huge seating area with lots of great options for beers or coffee. Lots of area to distance yourself and the staff was great on cleanliness 
Lazarus Brewing,82,     do not come here if you re going to ruin the vibes  I love this place. I love the staff. I love the atmosphere. I love the the food. I love the assortment of dogs that are found chilling by their owners on the large patio.   Please come here if you vibe with those things.   p.s. probably the best breakfast tacos in town
Lazarus Brewing,83,Loved the atmosphere and bartender. Very kind and patient with our questions  Would come back here for sure
Lazarus Brewing,84,good vibes and what I ordered was tasty. The food menu is limited but I guess that s because it s a brewery lol
Lazarus Brewing,85,My all time favorite brewery in Austin  Truly  if I had to choose one brewery to go to for the rest of my life this would be it   I haven t tried a beer I don t like there. To make things even better  they add something that makes all of them gluten free without sacrificing taste   I ve tried the tacos  tortas  and queso and all are to die for. Chicken mole tacos  seasonal veggie tacos  and the black bean torta are my favorites   They re also doing great to-go options compatible with social distancing right now  I ve been picking up beer and tacos from there about every week of this shut down. Not sure if I would survive without this place 
Lazarus Brewing,86,Lazarus Brewing is a large and beautiful brewery with quite the selection of beers. Their enchiladas are also very tasty. I would recommend you check out Lazarus Brewing for yourselves.
Lazarus Brewing,87,We really liked the outdoor seating  which is what pulled it up to a 4 star rating for us   but the service and the beers were not our favorite. Kinda plain and not all the special  3 stars from me .
Lazarus Brewing,88,Great spot - good beer  solid food.  Taking off a start for the staff. They seemed rather over any kind of interaction or suggestions. I always ask what their favorites are. A couple of different people where rather blah about the question.  The beer was good - 40 days and 40 nights was our favorite. Light  crisp yet decently strong IPA.  The tacos were great - especially their breakfast tacos.  Really enjoyed coming in a second time in the am to get some work done and having a coffee and taco.  Aside from my personal hang-up s with the staff  it really is a great spot.
Lazarus Brewing,89,I was in Austin for work and took the hubs along with me...last night  we went out to dinner and wanted to grab a drink  but we re just not the party animals we used to be  so we weren t super familiar with the bar offerings on 6th street.  We didn t want anything rowdy...enter Lazarus Brewing. It s a beautiful space with a TON of seating  both indoors and out.  There s a cozy corner that looks like someone s living room  with a disco ball deer head .  We noticed that there were quite a few people on their laptops there  which is pretty cool  because I d love to get some work down with a nice cold brew     The menu is not extensive  but there are quite a few beers and wines  as well as food offerings and their own brew of coffee.  We didn t get any food because we had already eaten  but I chose a Prodigal Pils  German Pilsner  that came in a 16 oz pint glass.  It was crisp  cold and refreshing.    I was really impressed by the friendly customer service by the staff.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the  amenities  in the ladies  room...everything from hairspray to bobby pins and  monthly supplies   you girls know what I mean .  I don t think I ve ever seen that kind of thoughtfulness in a restroom anywhere   We will most definitely be back 
Lazarus Brewing,90,Great brewery close to downtown Austin    I stopped by here on a Sunday night and enjoyed one of their Belgian beers. It was pretty crowded on this particular Sunday after a festival on 6th Street. But I still grabbed a seat at the bar and enjoyed the company. The beer was fantastic and their brews are diverse - something for everybody  Beertenders were friendly and super attentive despite the crowd.   Parking was not easy when I visited. I circled the surrounding blocks four times trying to find a lot that I wouldn t get towed. I parked at the bar next door finally and figured I could dip out quickly  but I wouldn t recommend parking there during their business hours. Uber or Lyft if possible 
Lazarus Brewing,91,I ve hung out here a good bunch of times both during the day to get some work done and to grab drinks on the weekend. I think Lazarus is a great spot for both. There s plenty of outlets and tables for people with laptops. If you re looking for a hang out spot the environment outside is awesome and given their large space I ve never had issues getting a seat outside.   The only reason I m not giving them 5 stars is that the 2 big food drink items you d come here for are just okay. The big one is of course the beer  I ve definitely found some here that I like  but as someone who s pretty curious in their ordering  the inconsistency here can be a bit frustrating. They often have new intriguing offerings  but even within styles of beer I ve had a really wide range of experiences.   I ve had quite a few people rave to me about their tacos and I personally don t get the hype. They re definitely a solid option if you re here and happen to be hungry  but if tacos are specifically what you re looking for I think you ll be disappointed.   I think for a brewery their coffee is surprisingly good and they change their pour over offerings pretty often. Definitely an underrated spot to come by during the day and hang out even if you re not drinking.
Lazarus Brewing,92,Love old Saint Nick delicious beer. The polle verde tacos are delicious. Great spot to hang out and even get some work done.
Lazarus Brewing,93,This was stop 1 of the Austin Eats tour and I would ve been happy just to stay here all day  It s in a very new gentrified area of Austin with new apartments  shops and restaurants popping up.  I love how this place is very large and open with a ton of seating from small to large groups. It is dog friendly with endless outdoor seating  both covered and uncovered  and some indoor seating as well.  They have numerous beers that are amazing and I hear they are rotating them quite a bit. If you aren t one into beer  they are also pretty well known for their coffee- it sure smelled amazing and I was totally eyeing and iced coffee someone was sipping on.  I got to eat one of their chorizo tacos with green sauce and oh myyy  I could ve eaten 10 of those. They were so fresh  flavorful and delicious. Normally I think breakfast tacos are breakfast tacos  but not here  Apparently they have a other taco options as well.  This is definitely not a place to be missed   amp  fun fact  the owner is a pastor  hence some of the beer names and the stained glass roof on the patio 
Lazarus Brewing,94,Lazarus is an asset to East Austin. The staff is dedicated  the  beer garden  has great vibes  the beer is some of the best in the city  there s a full espresso bar  and OMG THE TACOS
Lazarus Brewing,95,This place is great  Lots of beer options and their queso is amazing  Nice outdoor area with music.
Lazarus Brewing,96,Tacos are bomb    Great beer too. Dog friendly  nice open area and friendly staff. Great place to hang with friends or do some work.
Lazarus Brewing,97,Good beer  delicious food  amp  excellent ambiance  We loved sitting at the outdoor bar  amp  people dog watching. I love a good dog friendly patio  I had the rajas quesadilla  amp  it was delicious 
Lazarus Brewing,98,This place seems a little tucked away but they had pretty good drink specials. We got there too late to get any food but we weren t really in the mood anyways so that s fine. They let you brung your dogs in so I m sure that helps with their popularity and the outdoor seating is spaced well. We did have to wait a while to get served though  they were pretty full that night  just a nice place to stop by for a drink
Lazarus Brewing,99,Carnitas taco was probably top 5 ever.  They have a great covid setup - menus to look at when waiting in line to get in  masks required for ordering at the bar  then distancing in the outdoor area with water cups and single serve salsas. Definitely a lot of thought and effort went into making this a good and safe experience.  Beers were also good - American IPA being stand out.  Only disappointing thing was no flights  But not enough to make the experience any less good
Lazarus Brewing,100,Definitely a new favorite. I love their set up - open air everything  with a cool  Austin-y vibe. Even when you re inside ordering it s nice and breezy and for a pandemic-concerned citizen like me that is everything.   Loved the migas breakfast taco and the service. Super friendly and helpful. Also obsessed with their mugs. They re just cute and they make you feel happy when you hold them.   I ll be back for the queso and beer when it s not 10am - no judgment if that s your thing I just had work to do 
Lazarus Brewing,101,Really enjoyed and felt safe  Ample seating on the patio  with tables spread out. You wait in line  didn t take too long   order up front  and then sit down at a table and everyone not at a table is masked. The Stein is  25 and comes with two fills  and you keep the glass AKA an amazing deal. We may or may not have ordered 3 of the German pretzels with beer cheese mustard seed dipping sauces... pretzels were smaller than expected but delicious 
Lazarus Brewing,102,Nice spot with outdoor seating  decent selection of food and drinks  courteous staff  and good COVID protocols.   A group of 4 of us came here for a snack and some drinks to hang out on a nice sunny day. They had the shop partially open  with different booths for ordering and picking up food  all pretty much contactless  and wearing masks. It was pretty quick and easy  they had the menus available at the ordering booth.   It was busy  but people kept their distance  food came out quick  and tables were spaced well enough that we weren t close to others. I appreciated that they had cider  gluten  in addition to their wines and beers  so unfortunately although I couldn t try their brews  it was a nice spot and I d go again.
Lazarus Brewing,103,I called in and asked if they had a tasting   the asso std they  didn t. I then std that I was uneducated about coffee and had specific questions. The asso confirmed that they had an educated staff that would be able to ask questions . When I got there and asked about the roasting  the women   in yellow with pigtails  was bothered and  extremely condescending.  There was no line  We would have ordered bags of coffee otherwise as was our intention for Father s Day .
Lazarus Brewing,104,Yiur not going to find a better beer nor a better atmosphere that Lazarus Brewing  Everything is simply perfect  Even the food is amazing  And I must admit the staff are so far above the other pubs in the hospitality game.   I thought this place couldn t be any better  then COVID and the ice storm hit Austin hard and they showed their true colors of helping  not only their own staff and workers  but the community around them.   This place deserves the key to the city or something.   Did I mention they have a great beer        Just go here. Your taste buds  your heart  and your community will thank you 
Lazarus Brewing,105,We had an amazing time at Lazarus. There s a big open patio with lots of picnic tables and tables. The beer selection was great with lots of craft options. We also loved the chips and guacamole  tacos  and quesadilla. I felt very safe here during covid with masks required inside and everyone sitting outside at their own tables.
Lazarus Brewing,106,Very disappointed with my experience. For as great as the IPA was  the service from the bartender was very unfriendly and unwelcoming.   Bartender had short slick-backed black hair with a hint of white privilege. Asked him for a beer recommendation and told me he liked them all evenly. Never seen that question answered like that before  especially from someone providing customer services. You aren t mixing drinks bud  you literally just pull a tap.   When visiting the east side again I would rather drink the beer from the beer mats at Zilker than have a beer at Lazarus. I would rather grab someone else s used beer glass and fill it with free water at Zilker than to order a beer from bartender Lazarus brewing.
Lazarus Brewing,107,Cool spot  Lot of seating options depending on what vibe you re looking for  and the beer was tasty. Our bartender was really friendly and gave some nice suggestions.
Lazarus Brewing,108,Definitely one of my favorite brewery stops while in Austin last week.  The bar space itself is rather spacious and is even work-friendly with plenty of outlets  even right by the actual bar.  And staff is super friendly too  And  in similar fashion  the beer is damn fine too    First up  I enjoyed a tall glass of Tall  Dark  amp  Handsome  ironic as I m only one of those 3...and I m 5 5 and pretty ghostly pale   . This is some plummy deliciousness  But at 10.3   there was tons more I wanted to try  and I needed to make it to dinner  truth be told  I somewhat barely remember my tasting menu experience at Barley Swine lol   so I opted for a flight  including Double Predestination  40 Days and 40 Nights  Fleur de Lis  and Cool  amp  The Gang - all very much enjoyed.  If you like good beer  good vibes  and good people...and are lucky enough to be in Austin  stop by Lazarus.
Lazarus Brewing,109,Parking is typical for that area. The decor and design of this spot is awesome.  Great for solo trips or groups. Pick up menu and order at the bar. Food came out in a decent amount of time. Hubby got breakfast Torta. He liked it. I got a fajita taco  yum ad the mahi taco...... not yum. I went to the bar and told them and they gave me another fajita taco. I m happy.  I also got a stout beer. It was a little flat and not as cold as I would like.  I would come back after all that  order a different food and beer and see what round 2 holds for me.
Lazarus Brewing,110,Beer was good. Staff was incredibly rude  un-welcoming and didn t bother at all to try to accompany our party of 6 when we came to see a friend s band. Instead of leading us to a new table or area  once we sat the staff told us we had to leave or we could stand outside in the 40  weather. We got our beers and were standing off to the side and the cashier told us move out of the way so people can order- we weren t in the way  people were not ordering. While I m writing this we are witnessing more customers treated poorly in the line. Seems like a lot of non-Texans are working here and it shows. Never will I ever come back to this establishment. Signed- Native Austinite
Lazarus Brewing,111,Excellent beers  and pretty good food too. A good recent entrant into the plethora of breweries in Austin  this place focuses more on English Belgian-style beers  though you also get other stuff. And  more importantly  there is pretty good food  and wine too   The staff is friendly  and more than happy to spend time discussing life  the universe  and everything with you  which is pretty Austin-like .  BTW  Don t let the facade fool you  the whole place is pretty big. That said  it s been broken up into chunks that make the place simultaneously less barn-like  and still pleasingly spacious  and that s good...
Lazarus Brewing,112,Well if you have been following my reviews I drink IPAs. They only offer two on their menu but wasn t able to get a flight to try anything else so my review for the two IPAs  one is not on the mobile menu . Got the 40days and walks on water. The lighter of the two is 40 days  I think  is a good beer and would get again the other not so much. The bartender was not friendly at all and kinda rude didn t ask if we wanted food or anything seemed more annoyed that I was there and I had asked about flights  which they don t have due to covid and touching to many glasses terrible excuse I think. That should be my choice whether you touch them or not not yours but it s your business . Anyways prolly won t be coming back not trying to spend  7 to try one beer.
Lazarus Brewing,113,Lazarus is a quaint brewery on E. 6th. Kid friendly and dog friendly. Order food and drinks at the bar and grab a seat. There are plenty of picnic tables outdoors to enjoy the weather. There are hard ciders or hard kombuchas for non beer drinkers. The June Shine honey ginger lemon hard kombucha was light and easy to drink. Queso fundido is great for sharing but beware if you are not an onion fan. They are all throughout the queso fundido. A must are the black bean tacos.
Lazarus Brewing,114,Delicious and refreshing beer   Friendly staff and lots of seating to choose from. We are from out of town and happy we stopped in   
Lazarus Brewing,115,A funky concept has you order every round at the register  but the space was open with lots of seating  both inside and out  the beers we got were really good and all the tacos were delicious  we ordered one of each . I wish I could take some of the crawlers home with me  but I didn t want to check my luggage  so we drank our fill instead.
Lazarus Brewing,116,I have been here twice already  and it s because it s near free street parking and lots of patio workspace. Their beer is also good  as well as their coffee. Good place to work or hang out 
Lazarus Brewing,117,One of the staples and must go s anytime of the year in East Austin  Whomever visits me here I always take them to Lazarus  and of course Whislers . Came here on a relatively busy Friday afternoon to finish up on some work with my coworker and her doggo. For the amount of people  and doggos   the WiFi connection wasn t pretty good.  Inside Outside - 5 5 Much like all the awesome patio breweries  Lazarus has 4ish distinct seating areas. There s of course the inside with the bar  couches  and high tables. The outside with the long picnic tables. And my favorite the barrel room  that isn t always open from my past visits . It probably has a better  official name  but I forgot to ask. The last-ish part is a covered outdoor seating that edges into the outside picnic tables. What makes it a 5 5 for me is how open and welcoming the place is. It doesn t feel cramped  and there are doggos of course.  Brews - 5 5 I m personally a seasonal kind of beer drinker. On warmer days I enjoy a good blonde or pils. On colder days I enjoy a Belgian ales or porters. What makes Lazarus selection good is that all their brews cover that exact spectrum I enjoy. My personal favorites are the Desperaux  French saison  and Amandus  Belgian golden ale . Read the menu and taste them for yourselves    Service - 5 5 Like all Austin breweries  the staff here are amiable  kind  and knowledgeable. They re attentive and enjoy their job  or at least they look like they do . I mean that s all you want when going to a brewery right   Overall - 5 5 Whether it s your first time or your last  or you have people visiting from out of town  Lazarus is a spot you have to go  Brews  doggos  and tacos.  Simple as that.
Lazarus Brewing,118,Love love love this place. Great chill hip atmosphere serving bombast tacos coffee  teas  kombucha and craft beers. Come and have a cold Jolted Phoenix. Yummy yummy coffee infused Golden Ale at 4.3 . So delicious house made coffee too is great.
Lazarus Brewing,119,A solid brewery close to downtown.  Lots of good beers  many of which are also available in cans.  Staff is helpful and knowledgeable and  while they have indoor seating  they have a huge patio  for any size groups.
Lazarus Brewing,120,the WORST customer service that I ve in my life       How is possible that I staff said   shut your and finish your beer  I know it s was last called for getting last service  but please if you don t wanna have more clients PLEASE dont sell more drinks  really bad experience in this place.
Lazarus Brewing,121,Lazarus Brewing  another solid Austin Brewery. Tasty beer. Tasty Tacos. Plenty of room. Great taproom experience.  Been here a dozen times at various times of the day and week. They always have a good following. People working on projects. Friends catching up. The beer fan tasting delicious beer. That  me.  COVID-19 has change how they do business. We all know the rules. Lazarus Brewing follows the rules within reason. Do I feel safe  yes  but I try to be very careful.  Lazarus has plenty of room  but it gets very busy. They probably have 40 50 tables in various sizes  but people are not always following social distancing. I stay away from the groups.  If you are a beer lover there is something for everyone. A nice cross-section of styles and if you like IPA then try the 40-40. Good stuff  lol. It has all those great qualities of a good IPA.  Tacos and tortas all are a home run. Large and filling. Oh yes  tasty. Queso and nachos are great for sharing. The food certainly pairs well with their beers.  Overall  a must-visit in Austin for craft beer. No Cash. CC only. Great service. Spacious. Parking is a pain in the butt  but they have three spots for to-go orders and pickup. Lazarus is one of my go-to breweries in Austin.
Lazarus Brewing,122,Lazarus is a staple and neighborhood favorite for my household  and it s held that position for over 4 years. Both the food and beer are great. They also did a good job expanding the outdoor seating for Covid life.  Note to Lazarus  Bring back the seasonal fish taco  please  
Lazarus Brewing,123,I had they only hazy IPA and it was enjoyable. The outdoor space was very nice as well. The surrounding neighborhood was very rundown but the city appears to be in transition.
Lazarus Brewing,124,Beer  wine  coffee  and tacos... What else do you need   Lazarus brews up some amazing beers and has other options on their menu if your not a beer person. They have a nice big cozy patio out back which is great for larger groups. Check this place out 
Lazarus Brewing,125,Favorite Brewery yet  Love love Lazarus. Their beers are so good  amp  different from other breweries around. The thing about Lazarus is that their food menu might be small but it s SO GOOD. Unlike other breweries  you ll eat well when you visit Lazarus.
Lazarus Brewing,126,One of the best breweries I ve ever been to anywhere in the world. It s that good  Here s why   1  The beer  They have a large beer list and it s all local. It s also seasonal so it rotates often. I went in March and enjoyed their new sour ale  the fact they brew a sour ale proves they are on a different level . Also  the price point is good. My sour ale was  6 per glass.  2  The atmosphere  It s in East Austin next to a great dinner spot  Whisler s . Lazarus Brewing is  a large space with plenty of indoor seating and a massive outdoor back patio with picnic tables  tables  and a stage for live music.   3  The food  The best carnitas tacos I had in Austin. They were perfectly seasoned and required no salsa or toppings.  If you want an Austin chill afternoon  grab friends and hang out at Lazarus Brewing. It s one of the best things to do in ATX.
Lazarus Brewing,127,More craft brewery in Austin  Our 3rd brewery by 3pm... we were on a mission. Zilker told us to heck Lazarus out if were trying all the good breweries.   Place was pretty packed... everyone was on their laptop inside and drinking coffee... and outside everyone was eating their delicious looking tacos. I got a lighter beer  I think the Kolsch or something along the lines. Good ending to all the IPAs that I was drinking.
Lazarus Brewing,128,An incredible brewery experience-  an excellent selection of beer  delish tacos  and a wonderful patio for hanging out. The staff is warm and friendly. I cannot wait to return 
Lazarus Brewing,129,These are probably the best tacos i have ever had. We went for breakfast before we left. The bartender at small victories another great bar  told us about it  The beers we had were the Solomon s fancy  batch 200 and jolted phoenix. They were phenomenal  Everyone is super friendly  this spot alone makes me want to move to Austin. As for tacos the pollo verde and al pastor were amazing. You don t even need extra sauce. It s a coffee shop and a bar so it s a perfect place to do work or chill with friends. They also have a great patio. For breakfast tacos we had the migas  black bean  and chorizo.  Add crema and avocado  Literally so great  we have talked about them since we got back. We will definitely be back just to go to Lazarus  oh and the coffee is great too.   Also in the women s restroom they had free pads  tampons and Bobby pins    Lastly if you have never had Richards rainwater you must try it while you are in Austin. Its actually amazing   
Lazarus Brewing,130,Great space  beer selection and location. Terrible idea to make you exit beer garden  wait in line outside to get another beer with multiple people trying to get in. Should have separate line when u want another. Bartenders were outstanding.
Lazarus Brewing,131,When I come to Austin  always stop by this area  and either have a glass of wine  a pot of beer or a cup of chai  before on board. Never had good here but my coworker loves their beer  as good as Portland     I love this space  very open and also counter seating for solo  outdoor seating if whether is nice  or if you are smoker .   They also have hard cider and kombucha as well if you are not into beer  or wine .   WiFi works well  perfect place for after meeting hang out.
Lazarus Brewing,132,Love the vibe  ambiance  the beer of course  and the tacos   Very cool place to chill   try a few beers  and eat   I love me a brewery that serves food  and tacos at that.  When in Austin...  The bartenders are beautiful  the backdrop of the bar looks amazing.  The flight of beers that we had were all very flavorful.  I loved how each type of beer has a story behind the flavor.  The darker beer  the Christmassy flavored one  was my favorite.  I can t even tell you the exact name  sorry   But I m sure you can find it on the menu   I m so glad I tried the steak taco while I was there.  It was one of the best steak tacos I ve had  and I ve had me some great tacos before.  Just like everywhere in Austin  there s a large outdoor patio to this one.  Something about drinking beers outdoors on a warm night pulls at my heart strings.  Like I said  the ambiance at Lazarus was great.  Definitely feeling this brewery.  Their swag wear was pretty dope Too   Til we meet again  Lazarus.
Lazarus Brewing,133,This was our first brewery stop while in Austin. The beer style is more english german style beers. They still have all the classic beer styles that you are use to  but a lot of styles you may not be as accustomed to.   Everything I had was pretty good. Nothing blew me away or shocked my palate but everything was well crafted and had a good flavor. A solid brewery for sure   Oh and the location is huge and has a ton of space indoor and out.  If you do visit these guys  zilkers and blue owl are not too far away. Plan a trip to hit those three and you could possibly walk.
Lazarus Brewing,134,Great place. Great beer. Great people.  Went here on a whim to kill some time and lost track of time completely  It was pretty busy when I got there but such a lively and homey environment.   The staff was great and were kind enough to walk us through the different beers they had to offer. There was great seating options and the vibe fit very well with the decor of the place   Highly recommend the beer there as well 
Lazarus Brewing,135,Very relaxed area. Many people bring their dogs here to have a drink. They sell clothing merchandise here which I attached a photo. They have an outdoor seating area as well. Which was nice when it s cooler at night.
Lazarus Brewing,136,Came to Lazarus on a Saturday for brunch beer and loved it  Atmosphere is super chill hip. Plus  the location is very convenient and near downtown. It s a great place to hangout  with plenty of tables and patio space for large groups.   I ordered the migas and al pastor taco  both of which were delicious and generously filled. After getting stuffed with tacos  our group split a flight  5 for   12 . I liked that you get to customize your own flight. The only downside is that their menu offers mostly IPAs and stouts  which I do not like . Fortunately  I was still able to find 2-3 beers that were good. The Yukon Cornelius  Amelie  and American Samurai are solid options if you re looking for something with distinct flavor but with a lighter profile. They switch out their menus dependent on season  so I ll definitely be back to try out other brews  Go to Lazarus if you re looking for good food  beer  and atmosphere 
Lazarus Brewing,137,Awesome local spot that has  great beer selections  tacos  coffee...nice patio as well  What more do you want  Saturday gets busy around late afternoon time. Parking is mainly street parking.   Very cool setting with a living room area inside but yet opens up to a garage feel to the patio. They have live music on the weekends. You order at the counter and they bring food out to you. Pets allowed.   Try the beer flights  Chips are fresh and Pico is has a nice kick to it  Tortas are huge 
Lazarus Brewing,138,I must disclose this review is strictly for the beer.  Looks like there are very favorable reviews with the food.  Went here about 7 30 on a Thursday.  This just seems like any microbrewery  I ve been to whether it be Florida  Pennsylvania  Colorado  New York  etc so I m scratching my head at the high scores.  Just had a couple of flights at the bar featuring some standard brews and a couple seasonal.  Nothing too noteworthy or that blew me away.  Once again didn t order the food so the other good scores could come down to that.
Lazarus Brewing,139,Amazing place . I love their beer  their patio and my favorite is their guacamole.  Kid friendly.
Lazarus Brewing,140,Perfect for those who like good beer  good tacos and good dogs. In other words  I guarantee you and all your friends will love this place.
Lazarus Brewing,141,Whoa  I m a recent transplant from Denver and Lazarus made me feel like I was right at home with it s Denver brewing vibe   I love this place and would like to come here every day.  1  Puppy friendly patio  2  Coffee  beer AND tacos  Cmon  it s like they re not even giving me a fighting chance. 3  Quick service. 4  Non Alcoholic options for the DDs out there   Seriously  do not pass this place up. We stopped here while passing through Austin and I m still so happy about the experience. I got a few 5 oz pours of the Amandus  40 Days and 40 Nights and Prodigal Pils and all were solid. Smooth to go down and left me wanting more. They have a huge patio space quite ideal for some day drinking so it s a good thing we were hitting the road because I could have stayed here for awhile.  And oh yeah  the tacos  Do not pass on these. I thought tacos  smacos but gd  these were perfection  The fish were my favorite and the carnitas and pollo verde was wonderful as well. No taco or beer left behind......
Lazarus Brewing,142,I LOVE Lazarus. I ve come here alone a couple times  ordered a beer and some tacos  they re good     and just sat there in complete bliss. Honestly it doesn t get much better than this  -   They have outlets at the tables  so it s a great spot to pull out your laptop and get some work done as well.
Lazarus Brewing,143,Super cute space- books and couches in a brewery   Yes  Great addition to the eastside. The staff was super super nice too. Loved the whole vibe  The beer was decent- there weren t any hefs or lighter options though  which I was sad about. He said they usually have a wheat or saison but they were out     I also didn t get to try the food  so I will definitely be back 
Lazarus Brewing,144,Line is always a problem. They have 3 POS and most of the times only one is working. Beer is good but the long wait standing there discourage me to go. They need to speed up the process. there are not the only brewing on town.
Lazarus Brewing,145,I love visiting other cities to enjoy the great food  sites and...well  frankly  the beer. Visiting a beer centric city like Austin made for a wild few days brewery hopping. Loved it   I walked in early evening and was greeted by a super nice gal behind the bar. I love when folks at the bar are happy  welcoming and sporting a smile. That set the tone.  The don t do flights on happy hour but they do tasters for  2 each. I bellied up to the bar and got a few tasters.  Here s what I got   New hefe they had just added- What the Hef  Made with orange peel and Amarillo and strata hops. Citrusy  crisp. Super light and bubbly. Greatttt summer beer. I really enjoyed it  especially after walking a good while to get here. This quenched my thirst.  40 days 40 nights - IPA A little more body to this one. The hops were subtly and didn t punch me in the tongue. IPAs are growing on me  and this was a nice one.  Despereux 2 - saison with melon. Really nice. The last few trips I ve been hitting up saisons...and like IPAs they are growing on me.  Pacific coast - American pilsner. Did not like this one. Tasted like watery Heineken  if that s possible. They can t all be homeruns  and while I did hear a good amount of folks ordering this one  it just wasn t for me.  Awesome play list of upbeat oldies soft rock. The bar was super nice  wood and made for a great backdrop for all my pics haha.
Lazarus Brewing,146,Great selection of beers and fast friendly service with a cool vibe. Love the books and sofa area.
Lazarus Brewing,147,Spent time at Lazarus Brewing on Sunday afternoon. Lazarus Brewing was definitely one of the highlights of my Texas trip. A solid brewery with good food and a cool space  absolutely worth of a visit for both locals and visitors to the city.  Quality  Two Flights got us tasters of all ten beers on draft. Prodigal Pils  Despereaux  40 Days  amp  40 Nights  Walks On Water  Nottingham  Achilles Heel  Thirsty Pilgrim  Hollaback IPA  Green Drake  and Jolted Phoenix. I was impressed by the selection. Walks on Water  an American IPA  and Jolted Phoenix  a coffee infused golden ale  were my personal standouts. But there was not a weak spot on the menu. I also ordered the House Chips  amp  Guac to snack on  which was the correct choice. The Guac had tremendous flavor that kept me digging in. Quantity  Bigger pours and larger Flights are always a welcome treat. Value   12.50 for a Flight of five 5oz tasters. Ambiance  Lazarus Brewing is located a bit east of Downtown Austin. It is a fairly large brewery with a good sized outdoor patio and spacious taproom. The outdoor patio is prepared for warm summers with plenty of shade and fans on rotation  but we still opted for a spot inside. We were lucky to find seats on a couch in their lounge area near the entrance. They also have seats at the bar and plenty of high tops. The air conditioning was pumping and the music was excellent. It was hard to convince ourselves to leave. Crowd  Packed from when we arrived to when we left. Families  friends  and plenty of folks grabbing beers to go. Service  Fast  but not too friendly. The bartenders seemed overwhelmed and did not have the same time to interact with customers. More a testament to the great beer than an indictment to the staff. Parking  Street parking is available in the area.
Lazarus Brewing,148,Really cool vibe  amp  ambiance.  Tried a few beers  all of which I enjoyed.  There s a bar  some tables inside  and a patio.  It s air-conditioned inside  which is essential in Austin  though they could turn it a bit cooler .    I wish they had a little more room inside to accommodate bigger groups  but it s honestly a reasonable size right now  so I won t knock  em for that   I would ve considered buying merch  hat T-shirt   but nothing caught my eye.  They also have garage doors that open to the patio  which I assume they open on nice days  today s too hot .  Some of the beer names are clever  playing off the Biblical character  Lazarus  .  Unfortunately can t attest to the coffee or tacos  but from the beer side of things  I recommend 
Lazarus Brewing,149,3 5 since this a chill brewery with good beer but be very careful when ordering their rice bowls  Our rice was crunchy and undercooked  almost inedible bc of the spice level  coming from two vegetarians who enjoy spice   and we ordered the veggie bowl that came with no veggies  just whole peppers and bay leaves  all while paying the same price as people who purchased a bowl with meat. That being said I had the black bean taco a while back and it was delicious   Maybe it s just an inconsistency in the kitchen but our food was real bad and I don t really leave reviews often
Lazarus Brewing,150,First timer came on a recommendation from friends.  Initially make sure you have good parking and not in the wrong place . The staff enforced social distancing when waiting to make an order afterwards we got a table with our friends and it was chill during mid day. Not an avid beer drinker they have nothing but beer and whine but that s okay the bartender was helpful on what I perder and was okay price  I would go back with friends if invited . Other than that I wish they played music
Lazarus Brewing,151,A place so great you ll think you died and went to heaven  only to resurrect yourself like Lazarus every night to do it all over again   GIGANTIC beautiful spot right at the edge of the lively east austin scene on 6th. With coffee  tacos  beer  lots of space and plenty of love...you ll want to keep coming back for more and more. Beer options are varied and all tasty with that classic crushable Austin style where you can drink pint after pint of anything on the menu. Also one of the COOLEST brands and logos I ve seen at any brewery  and they had the sickest holy grail glass you can get once a year around christmas for a  1000 donation I believe and lifetime drinks  If I was a local I certainly might be tempted...  Do yourself a favor and visit one of the best spots in Austin.
Lazarus Brewing,152,Coming back here for the tacos and tortas  This place has a great environment and good for casually hanging out with friends. It can get a little crowded on the weekend. My husband enjoyed their beer but it s the tacos for me. Definitely check this place out
Lazarus Brewing,153,This place is a Great Find and their Beers and Tacos are so delicious   Fun find for a lazy Sunday afternoon 
Lazarus Brewing,154,Stopped in on a Tuesday night  ample parking around the area  plenty of spots next to a warehouse by the train tracks on 5th and Comal . Due to it s location  the place seems pretty popular for anyone wanting a drink after work hours. Spacious seating indoors and out  the whole place is as cozy as you want it to be. Didn t get a chance to try the food but from my wandering looks of it  looked pretty good in quality and quantity. Overall rating of 5 especially because the bartenders seemed genuinely nice and concerned about our experience   Lazarus.   Favorite beer of the night  Amandus  Belgian Golden Ale  8.5 
Lazarus Brewing,155,I have been wanting to check this place out since it opened  so I was excited finally get the opportunity on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I also wanted to check out the crystal goblet that entitles you to  beer for life  was worth the  1000 penance to become a Patron Saint.  The space itself is pretty great  open  airy  and meshing rustic  industrial  and post-modern d cor. It is also part of the hot trifecta-hybrid trend of having beer  wine  and coffee all in one spot  The ambiance is very laid back Eastside and I love that this place can serve several functions...there s a reading nook for when you want to just chill  there s communal seating inside and on the patio for when you want to socialize  and there is individual bar seating for when you either need some alone time or just want to really focus on their draught offerings.  This place brews its own stuff and I was wildly impressed w its Golden Belgian  my fav . I tried just about every beer they offered and none of them really wowed me other than the belgian  but there is definite potential in a couple of their brews  namely their porter and dry stout . The others were just not my style or palatable. However  I d love to come back and try some different batches. I also had their coffee by way of an Americano. You can tell they know their espresso and use quality stuff  so next time  I am going full on shot as my friend s looked and smelled divine  I also really appreciated they served the shot w a sparkling water chaser.  The staff was a bit hit or miss  but you ll have that in hybrid places like this  I suppose  where you have the snooty wine caf  baristas  the bit more engaging bartender types and the  I m just here for a paycheck  cashiers. But  if I m here it s not to make friends w the staff. Though  the bouncer  Michael  was a thoroughbred sweetheart   I also liked that they had some sweet sounds by DJ Gatsby going the entire time. While I love live music  and this is Austin after all  it was nice to have a respite from battling a band just to have a conversation.    Had we not just eaten  I d have given their food a shot. That is def on the  to-do list  for my next visit. I am still leery of having wine at a beer joint  but they did the coffee well and it looked like they had some decent selections on their menu  so I might go all-in for a full-on  holy trinity  the next time I m here.
Lazarus Brewing,156,Great beers and food. A little tedious that you have to get back in line every time you want to order something else but the line moves pretty fast even when they re busy. Also dog friendly and lots of outdoor seating.
Lazarus Brewing,157,Definitely my new favorite brewpub in Austin  Great prices  location  and unique combination of coffee  beer  and Mexican street food. What s not to love   Went on a Saturday evening and the crowd peaked between 7-9pm. There was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating  and the lines moved quickly.   My favorite beer was the Signs and Wonders Porter   5.50  and my favorite dish was the carnitas tacos   3.25 each . Would highly recommend both  so check out the photos   Will plan to stop by anytime I m back in town 
Lazarus Brewing,158,If you re in the mood for tacos and beer this is your spot  Lazarus has delicious beers. I had the jolted Phoenix and the Pilsner which was so good  My friend had the lager and walks in water which was yummy  The breakfast tacos were also great paired with the wonderful local brewery 
Lazarus Brewing,159,This brewery seemed to be pretty full on the weekends  but there s  plenty of space for larger groups. There are also plenty of separate bar areas it seems where you can get quick service. I tried one of the Indian Brown Ale called the 20 Pound Brown and it had a great flavor. They have plenty of interesting beers with biblical names that relate to their brewing company name. Check this place out if you re in the East Austin area and looking for a chill brewery with great beer.
Lazarus Brewing,160,Great vibe- love the patio  shade or sun  options. Was nice to bring my dog  they have water bowls too.  I m not a big beer gal  but I really enjoyed my Beartooth  amp  saison I got. I waisted money on the Queso cause it has thicccc onions in it  and I hate onions. Overall I d come back if I was local- but just inquire more on the food I order next time.
Lazarus Brewing,161,Guys  easy 5-star  None of the following is hyperbole   Easily my favorite brewery on the East Side. They are repping an amazing ESB EPB  their Shackleton is a fantastic representation of the style. It is  by a large margin  my favorite ESB in town. Also their Nottingham English IPA is earthy deliciousness. My wife fell in love with their Achilles Heel dry stout on nitro   bonus points for the smoke on the back end.  Their tacos were fantastic also. While the tortillas weren t hand made  the meat inside is perfectly executed. The pollo verde was our favorite.   I can not wait to be back. Now if I can only convince my wife to let me become a patron saint  hand made glass and free beer for life .  Our server Allie was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We will be back soon 
Lazarus Brewing,162,This was the first stop on our two-stop mini-tour of breweries in the area  while we were in Austin a couple months ago. They definitely have a great open space  and some good beer - I shared a flight of 6 tasters with my wife  including a pretty good kolsch  a pretty good sour  a couple pretty good porters  a very good biere de garde  Solomon s Fancy  though I gather that one was a small batch  so this review is probably way too late to be useful in that regard   and one saison  Despereaux  that was waaaaaaay too bitter  unexpectedly for a saison  we couldn t finish it .   The service when we were there was also a bit lackluster. Might have been a one-off  but despite being one of only a small handful of groups of customers  it took a bit of handwaving to get our questions answered about the beer  and several minutes to get the check  because the two bartenders seemed more interested in chatting with each other than paying attention to the customers. Again  I was only here once  though  so that could have been a total aberration.   I wouldn t go out of my way to come back here  but if I happened to be back in the area  which  if I were ever in Austin again  I would be  because there are some very good food places nearby   I d probably pop back in to see what had changed. I d give it 3 1 2 stars if I could  but 3 seems too low - I did enjoy 5 6 of their beers  even if nothing totally blew me away.
Lazarus Brewing,163,Lazarus makes a decent Chai Tea.  The beer is good too.  However  the bacon breakfast taco is really worth a trip in.  I have had many of them and sat on the sofa while enjoying them.
Lazarus Brewing,164,This place has an amazing selection of good craft beers for every style of beer. They had plenty of seating space even with the social distancing.  Food came out pretty quick. We tried the chipotle chicken  carne asada and carnitas tacos and they were all great 
Lazarus Brewing,165,The two times I ve been here  I didn t get a beer  Ugh  I ll really have to remember next time  it s just that the food has a reputation that precedes itself  Tacos are stuffed and the queso fundido is   fun. Kind of like a pizza without the crust  the queso has a mozzarella pulls to eat. Pull apart the cheese with a fork and top onto tortilla chips  for a unique experience. It s stuffed in the middle with meat and peppers.  Parking around here is awful  but at the end of the journey a chill environment awaits. A couple of bar stool tables on the inside of the brewery and lots of picnic tables out back. During warm summer nights  they open all the doors and sting up lights everywhere. This little brewery can pack quite the moody and romantic atmosphere    6 beers   4 tacos  and plenty of space to stretch out legs.
Lazarus Brewing,166,The chips and guacamole here are the BEST IVE EVER HAD. The Jolted Phoenix  a coffee infused light ale is delicious. I mean truly well done. It s not dark and bitter like most coffee beers  but light and flavorful. Just so good.   I also got a shot of espresso over ice and it was sooo delicious  lots of fruity and deep notes  really impressive. The set up is great  there is a cafe lounge on the inside and a cool porch setup.   Lots of cute doggies.
Lazarus Brewing,167,You don t often think of going to a brewery for brunch  or maybe you do   but I ll happily return. The staff was friendly  the outdoor seating great on a warm day  the chai delicious  and the breakfast tacos awesome   One day I might even return to try some beer.
Lazarus Brewing,168,Lazarus Brewing Company wasn t quite my glass of beer. Today was my first trip to Lazarus  and I decided to start with a flight to try out their assortment of beers. The brewery storefront is sizeable  with plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors and two counters available to order from.  I ended up having a flight of 4 beers   2.50 for regular ones   3.50 for their specials   and then a glass of the Despereaux  Solomon s Fancy  Biere de garde   I was not a particular fan of this beer. It was light  and did not particularly emphasize the flavors of pomegranate. The beer had a concluding note   aftertaste of plain water  which was a tad disappointing.  Prodigal Pils  German Pilsner   This was likely my second favorite of the night. The pilsner is crisp  with sophisticated flavors built into the beer.   Signs  amp  Wonders  Porter   This was an average porter to me  you can definitely taste the molasses and cacao  but not many elements stand out otherwise.   Amandus  Belgian Golden Ale   I had high hopes for this golden ale  but unfortunately I didn t quite care for the blend of flavors. The beer ended up being a tad bitter without the other flavors I d care for to complement it. This also had a final aftertaste of plain water  which I didn t really care for.  Despereaux  French Saison   This beer was a tad on the hoppier side of beers  but had some pleasant and smooth fruity flavors. The beer goes down easily and was likely my favorite among the five I tried.  Overall  I found the beers to be mediocre  nothing in particular particularly impressed me. The brewery itself is a nice site and would be a decent place to meet up with friends or find a table to study at however. I might come back to give it another try at some point  perhaps the beer was just not sitting well with me on this particular day.
Lazarus Brewing,169,Went here a while back but just realized I never posted a review  Really cool place with a great ambience. A lot of seating and some fun games to play  My friends and I had a great time and hope to go again the next time we re in Austin
Lazarus Brewing,170,Stopped in after a day at the river for a quick bite to eat and a beer. No problem grabbing a place to sit as they have plenty of picnic tables  patio tables and indoor seating. Fried chickpeas were amazing. The chorizo queso got a thumbs down from the table  but the guac made up for it  Everyone got tacos which were good  but the torta was a crowd fave   Have to come back for another beer or to try the coffee. Would stop back in if in the neighborhood.  Oh and I totally agree with some other posters. It was clean 
Lazarus Brewing,171,For myself  I had not been able to enjoy  beer  due to my gluten allergy  and this place changed that  Great tacos  large selection of brews  and great WFO or hangout with friends environment 
Lazarus Brewing,172,What wonderful Belgium brews. I would have given it a 5 for beers and atmosphere but service was satisfactory.
Lazarus Brewing,173,Unfortunately we discovered this place the last night we spent in Austin   The beer is top-notch and the tacos were bomb as hell   Salsa was a win  ambiance was a win  with 3 kids in tow   staff was friendly and their service was stellar.   Don t go to the brewery across the street  they sound like an old German brewery we went to once in the middle of nowhere Wisconsin that sucked. They make their own chips and salsa in addition to everything else. Oh  and they roast their own coffee. It s a win-win here   Love it    
Lazarus Brewing,174,I don t drink beer often but I love coming to Lazarus  They have a big selection of different types of beers. The space is large  inside and out. They also have great tacos. I usually order the chips and salsa guacamole when I come. The chips are thicker chips which I m not a fan of. There s a Lick ice cream truck into he back sometimes too. Parking is very scarce but if you re planning to drink just take a ride share 
Lazarus Brewing,175,Lazarus Brewing was amazing   I got the chilaquiles and Despereaux.   It s been a few weeks and the Despereaux has faded from memory but the chilaquiles has not.  In the chilaquiles  -best pulled chicken I have ever had        The green sauce was immersed in the pulled chicken and the chicken was so tender.  -the beans were sooo good -i opted for the red sauce and it was the right amount of spicy   Highly recommend  I liked it better than my friends  burgers and sandwiches.   In addition to the delicious and memorable food  the ambiance at Lazarus was wonderful  People were working and had access to outlets  others were smoking and laughing with friends  and even more were doing beer tastings. Very chill vibe.   I will be back during my next trip to Austin 
Lazarus Brewing,176,Phenomenal cup of coffee and a great area to post up outside and do a little work and soak up the Austin vibes.
Lazarus Brewing,177,Overall a pretty cool place. Wish they had posted the amount of beer you are getting with each pour though.   Beers will cost you around  6 each. And they have a ton of different types. They have a bunch of picnic tables and an outdoor garden with some heat lamps that are really cool.   We tried some of the food there. The chips and guac were really good but limey. The roasted chickpeas were also limey. We didn t end up trying any of their tacos.   Great place if you just want a few beers and to chat or if you love limes. Would come back next time to try their tacos and grab another brew.
Lazarus Brewing,178,Best beer. Best queso fundido. Best tacos. Honestly  need I say more   The food menu may be small but it s phenomenal. The beer is great and they also have wine for those who don t want beer. Highly recommend this for a happy hour  late night bite  or even mid day lunch.
Lazarus Brewing,179,Our favorite taqueria brewery in Austin. The tacos are awesome  The homemade corn tortillas are soft and hearty  but don t fall apart like a lot of others I ve had. The seasonal tacos are always my favorite. This summer the fish taco was the best I ve had in Austin  and yesterday I tried the fall chicken mole taco  which was also superb. The queso is AMAZING  It s white traditional Mexican queso  not the cheese whiz looking stuff I often see in this city. Pair the food with one of their beers  we liked the 40 days 40 nights IPA  or with a coffee drink.   Great big patio and TV room which plays soccer instead of football on Sundays. Very East Austin  very hip.
Lazarus Brewing,180,The beer was pretty good  the food was pretty good  the layout is nice with an array of indoor and outdoor seating options. Even in the heat the fans and misters kept us fairly comfortable.  But they really need to do something about the service.  I don t want a bartender acting like they re doing me a huge favor just by doing their job.  The bearded fellow with the short cropped hair on the sides had no joy in him and while not overtly rude  he carried an air of annoyedness about him.  I understand people can have a bad day  but this is my second experience with him and it was the same both times - so not a positive thing to be remembered by.    When closing out my tab I dealt with a different bartender and to be honest  she wasn t very nice either.  Just kind of a sour  annoyed look on her face.  You d think she d be a little happier I just dropped  50  with a 20  tip.  I know a job is a job  and perhaps this is the vibe of East 6th  but this is the service industry we re talking about.  If they re going to be representatives of your brewery  they should lighten up a little and make an effort to be a little friendlier.
Lazarus Brewing,181,Cannot state clearly enough how much I love Lazarus.  Truly exceptional beer  top-notch coffee  amazing food  and a really fun environment.   The beer. These brewers are geniuses. The list of what s available is always changing  because they are always concocting new brews  so don t fall in love with one particular type. The layers of flavor and complexity are other-worldly.   They have live music some nights. Their tacos are legit. They also have wine on tap   Favorite brewery in Austin. Hands down.
Lazarus Brewing,182,When I think to myself   I HAVE TO BRING MY SISTER HERE   That means it s a keeper.   The inside is ADORABLE. Super chill  the most AMAZING book collection. I was intrigued by the first beer on the menu and was not at all let down  It s light  delightful  and feels just like a cooler version of my summer day.   I will be back by myself soon to grab a book and park my butt on that cute leather couch.
Lazarus Brewing,183,THANK YOU LAZARUS  I ve always loved coming and getting the usual el pastors  BUT TODAY IT HIT DIFFERENT...many people have been starving the past couple days due to the snow storm due to no power  or no food in the grocery stores    and Lazurus handed out free tacos and held an optional donation to the people impacted most by this crazy storm.   Thank you for what you do for the community  I am beyond thankful 
Lazarus Brewing,184,Awesome place for beer  food and sports watching. They have some parking out front and pay parking on the street. They have a great selection of brews including one whiskey barrel aged brew. The food menu is mostly Mexican food  with tacos and tortas which were delicious. There is indoor and outdoor seating. There is a room with a tv for sports watching. The place is kid and dog friendly 
Lazarus Brewing,185,Lazarus brewing has an amazing  huge  dog friendly outdoor patio.  The vibe here is great. There is a ton of seating space indoors as well as outdoors.  The customer service was great and very friendly  This is another East side gem in Austin 
Lazarus Brewing,186,Love this place. We have been here a few times including Xmas Eve. Great beer selection.   We ve tried the queso fondue. It s different  but good.   Will definitely come back.
Lazarus Brewing,187,Pretty cool brewery on the east side of 6th street  and was a great place to grab some food and beers after a long bike ride all over Austin.  We knew the tacos were good here  in addition to the beer  so we made it our first stop.  It s got a pretty unique vibe  as the front part of the bar feels like a living room with couches and a very comfortable homestyle seating arrangement.  Beyond that is a large bar  with plenty of bar stools and high top tables lining the wall and towards the back.  It was about 4-5pm on a Friday and the place was definitely busy.  It was cold  so not many people were out on the patio to the side  but there were heat lamps and we were able to secure a table right under one.  We shared a flight of 6 beers  and they were solid...none of them were bad  but none were truly memorable either.  The American Samurai was interesting  but tasty - definitely worth a try   My favorite was probably the Abominable - this smooth IPA.  I thought the Fire  amp  Brimstone was a complete miss - tasted terrible and it does smell  and taste  like ham.  The tacos were awesome  in addition to their guac - fresh   It was a great compliment to the beer  and thankfully  we were starving.  Overall a solid place you should definitely check out.
Lazarus Brewing,188,I always like coming here when I m in town. The patio is a great spot to stop and chill in Austin. Good beer and cool atmosphere.
Lazarus Brewing,189,This place is pretty cool. Food is pretty good  got an assortment of tacos  and the service was quick.   The way you go about ordering beer is strange but it seemed to work  once you figured out how to do it . They should probably put a sign up   just saying ...
Lazarus Brewing,190,Lazarus has my heart  Their beers are consistently delicious  and their tacos are some of the best in the city. They ve responded to the pandemic well with the new setup and have multiple sanitizing stations available. The staff is polite  efficient  and masked. The outdoor patio is actually much larger than it looks and the misters are a huge help in the Texas heat.
Lazarus Brewing,191,I swear it s not the delicious beer talking but this place is an amazing spot   Beer is incredible and so flavorful. Tacos are to die for  I recommend the AL Pastor . Vibe is great  It s so welcoming and it feels so nice and cozy here.  Outside patio has both covered and uncovered and there s a nice inside spot to chill at.  Great spot to hang with friends 
Lazarus Brewing,192,Great tacos. We had the Chipotle Chicken  the breakfast taco and the Carne Asada. The chicken was so tasty  the chipotle sauce was just out of this world. We reordered it for the table   The Breakfast Taco was amazing. It was fresh with the right combinations of ingredients.
Lazarus Brewing,193,Brewery   coffee shop with a great outdoor patio  Swung by Lazarus Brewing for a drink to cool off in the afternoon and loved the  vibes  here. I got Isle of Skye for  5.5  which was a dark Scotch ale with hoppy notes. Not typically the drink I would get  but I enjoyed it  Didn t get any food here  but many people seemed to be enjoying the tacos. This place was really popular during the afternoon 
Lazarus Brewing,194,Nice outdoor seating and indoor as well. But let s get to the beer  the most important part of the establishment. Beer is pretty good. I ordered a flight of random beers. I just chose without really thinking through it. I Out of all the beers I chose  I really enjoyed the Achilles Heel selection. I enjoyed the little hint of coffee in it. That beer was smooth. The guacamole and chips were pretty fresh as well. Nice place to hang out and chill with friends. I d come by this place again when I m back around in town.
Lazarus Brewing,195,Beer and tacos and coffee  oh my  Lazarus was born on the idea that craft beer  cheers our hearts and brings people together   boy were they right. This East Side treasure is a great spot for the squad  Their craft brews are amazing and they are on point with their seasonal special releases. My favorite of their brews  Amandus  Belgian Strong Golden Ale   is super refreshing for having nearly 8  ABV and can be enjoyed year round  Let s not forget about the food    First off  get the guac  it is extra and it is worth it. After that  snag a couple tacos or even a torta  The pollo verde and al pastor are both off the hook. Also  they recently had lick ice creams slide thru and set up shop on the back patio. We know  be about your fitness  boo boo...however  love yourself and get a damn ice cream sandwich.
Lazarus Brewing,196,Uhhh the best thing about this place is the aqua blue walls. Everything else sucks. Beer is not worth it  but what ruins it is the service... I have come THREE times and each time the people working here are R-U-D-E. Which is a shame cause the stained glass umbrella is cool and location is prime. But wtf it s like they only hire people with terrible attitudes to work here    Stay away and go to Zilker brewery. Or home. Just not here.
Lazarus Brewing,197,Place smells amazing inside. The beer coffee and tacos concept is . Nice patio. I tried their coffee and beer. Beer selection isn t huge but it s not small either. Lots of IPAs which I m not really a fan of anymore. Didn t eat. Coffee was perfect. Seems like a cool place to go with friends.
Lazarus Brewing,198,Great space  friendly staff. The Amandus beer was my favorite  Looking forward to going back home. Cheers 
Lazarus Brewing,199,Don t miss this place whilst you re in Austin   I randomly starred this place as somewhere to check out whilst in Austin on a trip and am SO glad I did  as their beer is delicious    I typically like beers that are a little stronger with hoppy or malty flavors - and they certainly do a few of those - and I ended up coming back on more than one occasion during my trip to sample more of their beers   Soooo gooood    They do crowlers and growlers to go  and have both indoor seating  where there is AC  such a godsend whilst I was there   and a TONNE of outdoor seating with fans and misters and cover for those who are used to the overwhelming heat.  This place also has coffee  food and branded merchandise for sale.   I can safely say that if I lived in Austin  I would be a regular here  and will definitely be back on my next trip.  They have WiFi  an amazing staff and I challenge you to find something on their menu that you don t LOVE      
Lazarus Brewing,200,Lazarus has easily become my favorite brewery in Austin    The beer is incredible. I love trying the new brews on tap  but I always end of ordering the Amandus. A 8.5  Golden Belgian Ale with a slight fruity taste.  The atmosphere is cool  relaxing  inviting  and not at all pretentious. The bar tender told us that the owners were from Montana and they have tried to bring that essence to the space.  The food is phenomenal  I ve now tried the mahi mahi taco  the Al Pastor Torta  and the queso  and all were exceptional. This queso is truly some of the best I have ever had.  Locals and visitors should absolutely add this to their lists of places to visit on the east side.
Lazarus Brewing,201,Live music  in house brewed beer  a good wine selection and some tasty tacos  do you need anything else from life  I tried two of their beers  the saison and the pilsner  lightweight  I know   my buddy got the 40 days and 40 nights IPA  he says it s the best beer at that place  and we were quite happy  even though that tends to be part of the effects of alcohol. Their tacos were good  my chicken one was better than my Al pastor. For my buddy the black beans  vegetarian option so I would never touch it  was the best though he also really liked the carne asada  I should have gotten this one  dammit Francisco  you and your poor choices . Great place overall  kind of loud at times but I guess that s the sound of fun
Lazarus Brewing,202,Interesting brewery that seems to focus mostly on session beers with a few big beers thrown in for good measure.  Solid offerings with a nice tasting room and patio.
Lazarus Brewing,203,Like others  I was quick to judge the new brewery in town. They took over an old-school East establishment that I loved -- The Cool Store. I was a frequent shopper there  so when I heard Lazarus was taking over the spot  I was hesitant to see what they were all about. Well  they are all about a lot and they do it well.   I ve been here for early morning tacos  late beers and everywhere in between. Lazarus not only has great food  but they also brew some pretty good beers. It s that place that feels comfortably approachable. You can go in with zero knowledge of beer and you ll find something you like. The staff will also be helpful  providing samples and the like.  The tacos were surprisingly great. I had the chorizo breakfast taco on my last visit and it may have already secured a spot in my go-to list. It s next level.   Check this place out  it s worth the visit. Between food  staff  and beer  it s a hit on my personal list.
Lazarus Brewing,204,Just a beer review.  It was fine.  Cool atmosphere  had none of the food and the beer was just fine.  I d come here again to hang out and have okay beer.  So maybe a 3 rating would be more appropriate but based on beer alone  it was a 2.  Lots of better beer in the area.  I don t like reviewing places that I don t like but I felt like I wish people were more honest since there are like 20 breweries to go to in a limited time.  So  this would not make it to my list of where you must go in Austin.
Lazarus Brewing,205,This is my favorite place. Whether you fancy a beer  coffee  taco or just some good ol  friendly Austin camaraderie  this place has it all. I went there this morning for a coffee and was greeted by a warm and friendly staff  including Eva who was especially welcoming. As I waited for my breakfast tacos  I was kept company by the soft auditory presence of Billy Joel s  Piano Man  as well as the ambient bumbling of my fellow Austinites  quietly working or chattering with friends over breakfast. I left with a big smile  eager to return  likely tomorrow morning. Because  let s be honest  when you ve found your spot  you ve found your spot.
Lazarus Brewing,206,Great place. Good beer  great Taco s and app s.. Just frustrated a the credit card swiping. They put the tab on the wrong bill  and took days to get back. And at this point I worked it out with the other person. Not great experience  I never even sign for the amount I was charged. Should of helped the customer sooner. Be more careful on the tabs Y all swipe.
Lazarus Brewing,207,3.5 stars overall  weighted more to my beer experience. If it werent a brewery and just a bar  it d be 4-4.5 stars for sure.  Came around 6p on the weekend.  3 for the beer  3 means average.  Got the 40 days and 40 nights a-ipa and the Achilles heel Stout on nitro. The ipa was good but the stout was too light and watered down for my liking... It was only 3  so should have known. Would like to try more of their beer though - should have gotten a flight instead.  4-4.5 stars for the design and ambiance  particularly the live band that was playing. Staff was great. Music was great. Dogs were great.  plenty of seating but you just had to get your hands on it - it was pretty packed at times. Saw one or two people doing work even. They have coffee. They have food. Nice chill atmosphere. Really awesome place.  Would definitely come back to try more but the two beers I had didn t blow me away.
Lazarus Brewing,208,cute little spot I spent a few hours at on my birthday. Had a few glasses of wine and moved on to whisler s my fav. this was a cute little patio area and I enjoyed it with the warmers outside. Id love to come back if it wasn t so far from RR.   Lots of beer flights. more to try  tacos  coffee  etc 
Lazarus Brewing,209,Lazarus is the best of both worlds. I ve gone here to get work done over a cup of coffee and have a breakfast taco. I ve also gone to grab a beer or cider with friends.  Drinks are excellent  tacos are great. There s lots of seating inside and a huge patio outside with tons of misting fans to combat the Austin summer heat. There s even a few parking spaces out front. Must try Lazarus.
Lazarus Brewing,210,I probably have nothing to say that hasn t been said. Amazing coffee  beer  and food. We ve been coming here regularly ever since they opened and have never been disappointed in quality or service. I particularly appreciate their diverse beer output - among the most wide-ranging of any local producer I can think of.
Lazarus Brewing,211,Great spot nice and close to other breweries if you want to hop around a little. The interior and outside patio are both really nice. Great selection of beer and they even list on the menu which ones are popular  making it a little easier so you don t miss out.
Lazarus Brewing,212,Loved the beer and the decor  just wish there were some games or things to do with people there. Had the blushing bride  which was excellent  the mother of god  which was ok if you re into barleywines  and desperaux  which was just a step below blushing bride.
Lazarus Brewing,213,This is a cute hidden restaurant located in Austin that I was brought to by a friend as a out of town guest.   The parking is limited and I don t know that you would notice the restaurant just by driving on the street. Once you walk in though  they have a very open space with outdoor indoor seating.   The breakfast tacos are so good and the coffee drink I got was great as well   I really look forward to coming back here next time I m in the area.
Lazarus Brewing,214,I wanted to give this place 5 stars because there were so many great moments.  I have been here a few times  and every time this place is packed.  The downfall is that the beer lines are always sooooo long and they move sooooo slow.  I usually wait in the line for upwards of 30 minutes.  Not sure why it takes so long.  The food is amazing.  They serve street tacos that are so good.  I could eat these every day.  They also have pretty bomb chips and guac.  They usually have live music and both an indoor and outdoor seating.  They have tons of seating so even when it s busy you can usually find a seat.  The beer selection is great and I always find a new gem.  I will continue to frequent this place.....just wish it didn t take so long to get a beer.
Lazarus Brewing,215,Good beer  good food. Nice location on the east side. We brought the dog and he had a good time too
Lazarus Brewing,216,We love Lazarus for the atmosphere  beer  and food  They are my favorite chips and guacamole and tacos in Austin  The selection of beers is great. I recommend it to visiting friends all the time.   BUT  I can t give them 5 stars because the staff never seems very friendly or happy to be there  with the exception of maybe 2 or 3 people I ve seen over the past 3 years.  Especially the bar staff. They always seem kind of like they have better things to do and places to be  and they are just annoyed a bit by the costumers. It s just a bit of a shame based on how awesome the rest of the place is 
Lazarus Brewing,217,Excellent beers all around.  I just came in by myself and had a few drinks at the bar.  Got a great rundown from the bartender of each beer and he also gave me a few samples as well of some of his favorites.  The food was excellent as well.  I got an al pastor taco for only  3.50 that was a  snack  size.  However with the 2 tortillas it was easily made into 2 large tacos.  The flavor was excellent and there were a few sauces to spice it up as well.  The setup was very good as well.  They had a standard bar area with seating  an outside patio area and a third room inside that was very chill and had a few tables surrounded by what I assume were beer barrels.  Oh  they have coffee too if that is your thing   
Lazarus Brewing,218,Stopped here for some crowlers and samples.   Holy Mother of God--Belgian Barley wine. Chocolate undertone. Alcohol taste is noticeable with an alcohol finish. Mild carbonation. Strong smoky barely flavor. A good powerful beer. However  I would have liked a little more nuance.   Tall Dark and Handsome-- A limited release Belgian strong ale. Undertone of wine.  raisins and plums. Smooth with a subtle sweetness. Really good beer.  Double the Destination--A very hoppy DIPA with a strong finish. Probably the most grapefruitiest of any DIPA I ve ever had. Great with BBQ.  Despereux-- French Saison. I was disappointed in this beer. This saison seemed like it was missing that fruity note. It is a very mellow  maybe even watery saison. What comes across is the spice and it does have a crisp finish. But I didn t care much for this beer.   Lazarus is a great brewery  but I think they have a penchant for darker  robust brews.
Lazarus Brewing,219,We came here for drinks and we were very happy we did. We sat at the bar and for excellent service. We got the Amandus and 40 Days  amp  40 nights. Both were excellent and we would get it again. We did not get food but it looked good so maybe we will try it the next time we are here 
Lazarus Brewing,220,Honestly  I thought every breakfast taco was the same.   I was wrong.   Lazarus Brewing is seriously an awesome place. Best chai tea latte I ve ever had. My friend and I got some chorizo and bacon egg breakfast tacos. SO FREAKING GOOD    I really enjoyed everything I had here. The sauces that they provide were both really good too. They had a salsa verde and a spicier salsa. As good as they were they were really unnecessary. I enjoyed my breakfast tacos as served and I don t see why anyone wouldn t.   What really made this place special besides the chai tea latte was the guacamole and chips. Holy guacamole that junk was out of this world. It just tasted so fresh and brightened up my day. Perfect balance of acidity  saltiness  and savoriness. If you don t get the guacamole here you are wrong.   If I m ever in Austin again this is definitely one of those places I will make sure to eat at before I leave.
Lazarus Brewing,221,Lazarus Brewing is making some great beer on the Eastside.   Go in the morning and you re greeted with delicious breakfast tacos cooked by alums from Austin favorite El Primo and a great kitchen staff. Go with the bacon or chorizo... or if you re feeling super hungry make it a breakfast torta. You might have to have a nap afterward  though... those things are huge.  The coffee is good  too  and roasted in-house by one of the owners. They tend to be non-third wave in their roasting profile  going darker and roastier than most other coffee shops in Austin. I appreciate it as an alternative to the myriad floral and acidic options here. Their espresso drinks are also good and there is cold brew on nitro.  For lunch  you can still get breakfast tacos  but try any of their other lunch dinner tacos or tortas. The al pastor and the pollo verde are delicious  and they have housemade hot sauces to accompany. The tortilla chips are thick and crunchy  served with solid guacamole or a good pico de gallo.  But the beer  right  Matt Couch  the brewmaster at Lazarus  came from Victory with a strong pedigree. The work he s doing at Lazarus is world-class  starting with a range of English and Belgian styles and moving into delicious German beers and experimentals. They won gold at the Great American Beer Festival 2017 for their Amandus Belgian Golden Strong Ale.  IPA-wise 40 Days and 40 Days is full of tropical fruit notes  super drinkable  and packs a good ABV punch  while the Double Predestination  theology... get it   is one of the smoothest  most drinkable DIPAs I ve had... and sincerely dangerous. I personally love the Achilles Dry Irish Stout  served on nitro  as one of the best Irish stouts I ve tasted in the States. I d pick it over Guinness any day and it s as drinkable on a 100  summer day as it is on a chilly winter night in Austin. The Shackleton English Premium Bitter is great and roasty  and one of my go-tos.  The best part is that the beers rotate a lot and the brewers are playing with new stuff all the time  like the Greyhaven English Mild brewed with Earl Grey tea and served on nitro  or the range of single-hopped Pilsners  or their Amelie French experimental hops series. Matt and his brewers are creative and supremely skilled  and that translates into excellent beer.  Finally  Lazarus is a great space filled with great people. The owners and staff are friendly and great to talk to  if a little opinionated ... but that s what I like. I want recommendations from people who care about their craft or vocation  and you can get that from the Lazarus folks. The brewery itself is comfortable and can fit a lot of people  with a patio under a gorgeous custom stained glass dome  a living room area  long tables  and a hand-hewn bar.    If you re drinking craft beer on the Eastside  don t miss Lazarus.
Lazarus Brewing,222,I really liked this brewery. Here are the important things that they totally succeeded in    1. Friendly staff. 2. Speediness of food. 3. Variety of drinks. 4. Cleanliness.   Seriously the people are nice  staff and allies alike. Their food  which are primarily  tacos and tortas came out quick and tasty  and we re provided with a red and green sauce. They have quite a few beers of all different kinds to choose from  as well as wine and coffee. And shit was clean. Bathrooms were clean. It was taken care of.   It s dog friendly. And they have a really great amount of seating  inside  outside  and a covered outside. It s cool.  I don t have much more to say but I like it and will be back 
Lazarus Brewing,223,Unless I m missing something obvious here  this place is pretty darn amazing. What was it before  a garage  Whatever you think about East Austin gentrification  it sure does draw a crowd.    I have no idea how good their beer is  but I do admire the clever names. And Lazarus is not screwing around with their coffee here - my Kenyan pourover took about ten minutes to make  but was well worth the wait. Wonderful stuff.   The business hours are interesting  we ordered the queso fundido but appeared to get a very Sicilian fennel-onion gratin instead  and on this Sunday night bar-crawl it was my turn for the bill  and I confess I had a brief moment of sticker shock over our wine  beer  coffee  amp  queso total. But I did score rock star parking  so all s well  etc. And you know  the more I calculate how their  1000 custom glass offer amortizes  it starts to sound like a really good deal. Hmmm. Okay  I ll give that one a little more thought.
Lazarus Brewing,224,SHORT VERSION  I m here 3-4 times a week. This place is legit. The beer  YES. The tacos  YES. The coffee  YES. The staff  YES  They re all very attentive and friendly -- all of them. I especially recommend Tony and Marcus  Hey Bobby E. -- he s the actualy manager  -- but I love their WHOLE STAFF. You should come drink beer here  eat tacos here  drink coffee here. Period. Whatever that Bobby E. guy is talking about is TOTALLY not true.You can ignore his review.  LONG VERSION  These guys opened over Christmas 2015 and immediately shot to the top of my Austin brewery list. Yes  there s Hops  amp  Grain  Zilker  St. Elmo  Austin Beerworks  and many other QUALITY spots. But this one takes the cake.   They stole  invited   their brewmaster from Victory and he s been pumping out HIT after HIT. I don t even like half the styles of beer they produce  but because of the high quality  I can t stop ordering them.  THE BEER  Start with the 40 Days and 40 Nights IPA. They run out of this one the quickest  so if it s on the menu  order it. Lots of it. It s my favorite on their menu.  Second favorite is the Double Predestination  double IPA . It s got some nice sweeter notes and packs a punch.  Other highlights include  Amandus  Shackleton  Road to Damascus  and Nottinghame. You really can t go wrong.  THE FOOD  You know it s dangerous when you want to eat tacos at a brewery over the tacquerias in the neighborhood. The folks in the kitchen are cooking MOUTHWATERING tacos. For breakfast  stick with the Chorizo or the Carnitas tacos  for lunch dinner go for the Pollo Verde  with crema  or the Al Pastor.  THE COFFEE  Yes. A brewery with coffee. And it s SO GOOD. There s another Austin coffee joint next door that only does coffee and I ll drink Laz s coffee over there s. The owner s wife even roasts her own beans for most of the coffee. And the pour over is around  3 -- you can t get quality coffee for that price anywhere in Austin.  IN CONCLUSION  Most places that try to do coffee  tacos  and beer usually do one well and the rest average. This place NAILS ALL THREE.   Coffee -- Beer -- Tacos -- Joy  Come spend your money here. You won t regret it. Despite what Bobby E. says.
Lazarus Brewing,225,Hip new brewery on East 6th with indoor and outdoor seating.  The bar is pretty great.  The outdoor patio is nice and allows pets.  Bring your dog or other leashed fur creature.  I ordered the American IPA which was quite good.  Next task was food.  Ordered the queso fundido which came in a sizable portion.  This was cheese goodness.  There is some chorizo in the queso so vegetarians beware.  Also ordered the guacamole.  The guacamole was good  but they added a  lot of lettuce filler to make the portion size seem larger than it was.   Kinda cheap move on that. The main course was tacos which were great.
Lazarus Brewing,226,Pretty good tacos. Fully loaded and lots of extra toppings are optional. I ordered the chicken verde and the Carne asada tacos with sour cream and avocado. Pretty good beer from what I had tried.
Lazarus Brewing,227,Really cute brewery in Austin. While the selection isn t super big  they do have a wide variety of brews. Great prices  outdoor seating  beer and mexican street food... what more could you need   Went on a Sunday around 1pm and there was plenty of seating outside  but the inside was completely packed with people hanging out and studying.   Highly recommend the carne asada tacos with the Despaurex brew. You won t be disappointed 
Lazarus Brewing,228,Beautiful brick patio. Cool Renovation of the old 6th street Cool Store. A brewery with tacos. This 3-star review is for the tacos.  You order food at the bar. Service is meh-to-okay. The barkeep said they re  known for  the al pastor tacos. I ordered two with avocado and crema at his suggestion. They were tasty but underwhelming  especially for the steep price of  4.75 each.   The food runner who brought the tacos was too busy to bring me extra napkins and I had to find the salsa myself  inside  next to the kitchen entrance in a little fridge . It s annoying to have to order and pay before you get your food  since you re asked to tip on service you haven t yet received. This arrangement frequently results in tipped employees not being motivated by tips  or lack thereof  as they normally would be and generally tends to lead to worse service.   The corn tortillas were not homemade. Pastor tasted good but not spectacular. Avocados were fresh and the proportion of cilantro and onion was good.   Average food at above average prices. You re paying for the atmosphere  which is nice  but not  5  taco nice. IMHO  no taco in a store bought tortilla should come close to  5. It s not that hard to make tortillas.
Lazarus Brewing,229,This coffee shop is so cute   I just randomly strolled in here while I was in Austin and I loved the vibe. They serve beer  alcohol and tacos  What more could you ask for   They re menu is pretty simple so you won t get overwhelmed by a complicated menu.   It s also very spacious on the inside and there is more than enough room to study or get some work done. I also think it s a great place to just chill and relax and catch up with a few friends.   I didn t stay too long but if I m ever in the area again I ll definitely stay there a little longer and I ll definitely try their tacos 
Lazarus Brewing,230,We heard this was a must-stop in when in Austin  and we are so happy we did. We dropped in to end our Sunday evening  and the beers were just great. Someone also put some thought into their names  always a plus. The bar tenders were also very personable and made sure you were satisfied.   We came post-dinner  so i wish that we could have tried the tacos.
Lazarus Brewing,231,This new kid on the block is doing a lot of things  and doing a lot of them well. To start  the atmosphere is pretty cool. It s open and welcoming whether you sit outside on their patio  inside at the bar or tables  or in their lounge caf  style area. They had two espressos to choose from. I went with the Costa Rican one over the Kenyan and it was fantastically deep and rich and I didn t want it to end. I tasted their mocha as well which was great too.  Then it was time for beer. They were out of their Belgian Strong Golden Ale  Amandus  which is the one I really wanted to try. I settled for their Robust Porter named Signs  amp  Wonders which was good and I would get it again. I had a sampling of their Irish Red Ale too  Ulysses   but wasn t a fan.  I easily could have rated them 5 stars  but one of the bartenders was a tad bit too pretentious for my liking. Marcus  who I remembered from Hopfields  and the guys slinging coffee were awesome though and I could see after some more visits and if their food is legit this getting bumped up.
Lazarus Brewing,232,Great beer and yummy eats but I just always love the environment this place has. It s always buzzing with interesting people and everyone seems content and happy. Great patio for dogs too. Feels comfy like home.
Lazarus Brewing,233,Excellent street tacos.  Homemade rootbeer is excellent.   I especially liked the fish taco. It was spicy and complex. We were little confused about ordering at first but figured out you just order at the bar.
Lazarus Brewing,234,Our plan was to hit a couple brewing companies in the area on Saturday. We ended up staying here for almost 2 hours. I tried 10 of their 12 beers. Some of them were lacking in flavor  but the good ones were really really good.     This place has an awesome set-up for people to sit outside  bring your dogs and just enjoy the beautiful weather.
Lazarus Brewing,235,Their beer is chill. There s a bergamot one I adore  but sometimes it s sold out and I m not sure if it was seasonal or not. Love the atmosphere and the vibes  and dogs  they also have rotating and guest beers if you want to spice up your Lazarus vocabulary. Their chicken quesadillas make me happy. I like to get those or and their guac any time I go   the quesadillas do come with guac on top too . They re very yummy especially compared to some other brewery foods I ve had before.
Lazarus Brewing,236,I probably wouldn t have tried this place but I was with a friend who is the brother in law of one of the investors from out of state.   The front girl who took our order was rude to one of our party. There were four of us. We all wanted to try their Amandus beer  as none of us are IPA fans and that seemed like all of the other choices. They were sold out of that beer.   As I was scanning the menu for any other options than IPA  one of our party asked the bar tender what a good choice was for someone who didn t have a lot of experience picking craft beer. Truthfully  he was speaking for our whole party as we are all middle aged and not hipsters in the beer scene. We can hold our own with wine  but not beer.  The bartender pointed us a beer they call  Pilgrim s  something   and said it is the most watered down beer they sell. Not knowing what to order and not feeling like she was interested in helping us decide  we all ordered that that beer. Wasn t bad beer  but we felt like where being talked down to by a beer snob. We had planned on eating there  but after our bad experience with the bar tender  we just drank our beer and took our money elsewhere.  One in our party asked for a particular manager because he wanted to talk to her about the service. She wasn t there and shut him down quickly with her sarcasm.   Hopefully management can get their customer service turned around. I don t think I will go back. I like trying new craft beers but like the rest of my party  I need some help understanding what the options are.   I am certain my friend whose brother in law is an out of state investor got an earful as soon as he could get to a quiet place to call him.
Lazarus Brewing,237,The place is hip and cool with an industrial look and feel which i like. Lot of Beer options..if you like stout definitely try the Achilles Heel  We also ordered tacos here which comes with egg.. different from most places.. i did like it though  There is a lot of seating indoors and outdoors which is nice.
Lazarus Brewing,238,There are three different areas to sit  we chose the picnic tables with a nice view of the stage.   The music was good  the food was damn tasty  and so was the beer.   The environment was very chill  and it had a great vibe to it.  This was my favorite brewery in Austin  and would be at the top of my list for a return visit.
Lazarus Brewing,239,Six great beers to start with  including a couple of really unique ones. Lazarus  I m super impressed.  1  Amandus - Belgian Strong Golden Ale - This beer has a winey body flavor to me. I think its the fruitiness of the yeast  with the mild malt flavor. Delicious.  2  Double Predestination - Double IPA - Some serious theological discussions here... lol  no but really  this beer is great. It has the kind of citrusy hop flavor I love from IPAs  and is not overly punch-you-in-the-face bitter.  3  First Noel - French Saison - I love Saisons  yeast characteristic in general. What makes this beer unique is how it somehow provides with the same Belgian yeast esters  but feels somewhat clean easy drinking and accessible.  4  Nottingham - English IPA - The next two beers on the menu were the best surprises for me. I am not normally into the maltiness and fruitiness that covers up the hop flavor in English IPAs  but this beer is wonderfully balanced to me.  5  Shackleton EPB - English Premium Bitter - I have not had this style of beer many times  but this was tasty. Malty sweetness  balanced with a different kind of punchy bitterness  not like American hopped IPA bitter .  6  Achilles Heel - Dry Stout on Nitro - After sharing samples of all six  you can buy 5 oz pours for 2.50   I had to get one of these to myself. I really enjoy beers that are very flavorful  but low ABV  and this is one of the better low ABV stouts I have ever had. Me and a couple of the guys that worked the bar were talking about how the smokiness of this beer is cool and interesting since they did not actually add smoked malt to the beer like some breweries do. Anyway  I could drink this guy pretty much all day  any season.   I haven t had any of the food yet  so I will have to update later on that.   Also  it was super cool having a chance to talk to the owner  Christian. He seemed to find a few minutes to talk to every one that came in. He told me that it is their hope to get 16 of their own beers on tap  and really make them for drinking on location. Also  the brewer s background definitely adds something fresh to the Austin beer scene. He learned to brew in England  we have very few English style beers in Austin  and then brewed at Victory  which focuses on German styles .   From what they have said on the internet before opening  they want this place to be for community and conversation. I kinda rolled my eyes  because I keep hearing that lately  but then a business only caters to a small demographic. However  these guys really do seem to be very inclusive and I really appreciate that. They offer tacos  a couple vegetarian options  beer  wine  their own rootbeer  coffee... really almost something for everyone. Very cool. Anyhow  I m quite excited about this place and will be back many times down the road. Cheers  Lazarus 
Lazarus Brewing,240,I brought my oldest daughter here for beers and tacos as we explored Austin. We came around 6 00 PM on a Thursday and were very pleased to not only find close street parking  got lucky   and no wait. Mr. Beardy behind the bar seemed like he had something stuck in his keister. Dude  if you re having a bad day  suck it up and put on a smile. Act like you want to be there. You re selling beer and tacos     I ordered the  40 Days and 40 Nights  IPA and it was quite delicious. It was a cloudy IPA so the visuals were a bit unusual  but the flavor and aroma were right on. Great beer. We ordered a combination of carne asada and pollo verde tacos  all of which were fan-freakin-tastic  Absolutely great food  great beer  great price  and cool vibe. Everyone else on staff we encountered was great  so perhaps the hipster behind the counter who took our order had just run out of beard wax and was feeling down.
Lazarus Brewing,241,I ve been a fan of Lazarus beers for a while  but had to write a review after eating their food. The al pastor taco and queso were SO good   I think one of my favorite tacos and queso in Austin. I was so pleasantly surprised.   Of course  the beer is also great. I generally do a small flight to taste their rotating drafts  I love the sours    but the 40 days and 40 nights is always solid if you like IPAs.
Lazarus Brewing,242,Last couple times I ve gone there s been a line to get beer due to Covid and each time you want another drink you have to get back in the line to order again. Lots of tables and all outdoor seating however and great beer.
Lazarus Brewing,243,In the up and coming part of Austin there couldn t have been a better addition than Lazarus Brewing.  Locally owned and operated  they bring a ton of experience to this location.  I didn t get a chance to try their tacos but they looked amazing.  As for the beer  wow  but not a surprise. The pilsner was fantastic. These guys know what they are doing and I m super excited to see what they do next 
Lazarus Brewing,244,Lazarus was my first stop while poking around Austin this afternoon. I was looking forward to trying their beers based on reviews on Yelp and Untappd. Overall  it was good.  I had two tacos. The carnitas taco and the black bean taco. The tacos were solid. Very flavorful.  I had a flight of five  Shackelton  Amadeus  Despereaux  Kovenant  and Jolted Phoenix. I liked the Amadeus Belgium ale. It was a good representation of the style. The Jolted Phoenix was a coffee IPA  which was good was well. I didn t find the beer daring.  Overall  the beer and food were good. I expected more from the beer  though.
Lazarus Brewing,245,Great place to people watch or dog watch while enjoying a tasty beer.  Even have a few wines if you are not a beer drinker.  Tacos are delicious.
Lazarus Brewing,246,Awesome new brewery in Austin  They have coffee in the mornings and beer from the afternoon and on. It gets extremely crowded in the afternoon  so I d get there before 2 if you want a seat. There s a lot more outdoor seating  but in the summer it isn t ideal.   Their beer options are great and you can get flights to try different ones out. Their queso and tacos are excellent as well 
Lazarus Brewing,247,Just visiting Austin  from Florida for cinco de Mayo and found that this restaurant was amazing. Having celiac disease  is a challenge .I ordered food twice from them  tacos an queso fundido and I tested for gluten with my Nima sensor. It come out gluten free .  I m very happy . Their tacos  are amazing . The best tacos I have ever had .
Lazarus Brewing,248,This place is very well designed  and set up. It s a cozy place on a chilly night.   Everything we had was good but not great.   If you re going to sell Tacos and tortas make sure you consult with someone who has ties to authentic Mexican cuisine. The salsas and the meat were sweet  no Mexican meat inside a taco or salsa is ever sweet.   Tacos and Tortas are a Mexican street food favorite  and this joint has missed that mark. Go down on riverside drive and compare to some of the more authentic places  or at least attempt their seasoning. It was quite sad..to pay  3.50 Per taco that have sweet meat and salsas to top it with.   One of the bartenders  who first helped us  could use a refresher on customer service skills. He was rude to our friend who asked to sample one of the taps.
Lazarus Brewing,249,Stopped in with my lady on Christmas Eve for their soft opening. Not super busy  but definitely a small crowd. FYI - since this was their soft opening  take my review with a grain of salt. I ll update it after they have been open for a few months and have gotten into their groove.   Atmosphere  Huge bar with several high top tables  some nice couches over to one side and a pretty sweet outdoor area. Oh yeah - and an awesome elk on the wall wearing chainmail   Food  All about the tacos here  I got 1 carnitas and 1 carne asada - both were really heavy on the cilantro  not a big fan of that . Once I pulled off a decent bit of that  they were quite good though. They have a red sauce that  while not needed  definitely makes the tacos even better.   Beer  I did a 5 beer sampler  short-pours  and they were all quite good as well. The  Double Predestination  DIPA was my favorite  followed closely by the  Nottingham  English IPA. The stout was my least favorite  which is odd since I usually dig stouts. Looking forward to see the beers and styles here evolve over time though.   Service  Not so great. Normally I would have deducted some major points for service  but I m holding back due to it bing their soft opening. There were 3 bartenders working when we came in. 2 seemed to really know their stuff  but we got the one who was apparently having a very off night. Sat down and it was several minutes before we were finally greeted. We told the bartender we were looking for food and beer  after he asked . He then proceeded to greet some other customer  who came in as we were talking to the bartender   take her order and serve her before finally coming back to us to ask if we were ready - where we reminded him that we still needed menus...  For the most part  that s how the service was for the rest of the night also. I m thinking the guy was probably just overwhelmed because it also seemed like he was having some major issues with the cash register. Other than some other  soft opening  issues  both our meals coming on one plate  no napkins until we asked  drinks not being refilled until after several minutes of sitting empty  etc  everything was great.   I ll be glad to head here again in a month or so once they have worked out some kinks. I definitely foresee some really good beer coming out of Lazarus in the future 
Lazarus Brewing,250,A great community focused brewery with a fantastic location in East Austin. In terms of beers  the robust porter they have on tap is one of my favorite beers in Austin. I m still waiting on them to brew a heavy and rich stout   Also  if you re looking for a place to work  they open early and serve great coffee and breakfast tacos in the morning.
Lazarus Brewing,251,Great beers  awesome ambiance and location. I tried the walks on water and the 40 days 40 nights - both of which I would recommend.  Food  Tacos I would give 2.5 5  skewed by Austins great tacos . Overall the al pastor and carnitas were pretty dry  how given the fat content of these proteins   Black bean was pretty decent but not a great value for  3.75.
Lazarus Brewing,252,Took a road trip to San Antonio and on the way had the brilliant idea of stopping in a random brewery in Austin. The place doesn t seem like much more than a reconverted old gas station...DO NOT let this fool you   Parking could be a bit more ample. I parked in the back which I assume is for employees only.  Inside the atmosphere is trendy and very cool  Nice wood mixed with the stainless from the beer tanks and leather seating. Reminds me of places in Williamsburg Brooklyn.  Nice house selection of beers and gifts. Got the Am lie 4 which was nice body fruity with some earthy hints. Service was great   Now this place is Beer and Coffee - well let me tell you first time in the US  espresso coffee is served the correct way - with a small glass of club soda   Espresso was GREAT   Would I come back again  Hell - I d move to Austin just to have this nice little cozy place near by 
Lazarus Brewing,253,Love every inch of this place and the attention to detail is oncrddiable  From the glassware to the bar stools the place is awesome    I had walked in and sat at the bar and was greater with a smile from everyone behind the bar   I started with the amandaus and then a flight of a red  stout and porter.  I ordered the carneasada torta and Jt Blew my mind   Beer is great and good follows I will be back  
Lazarus Brewing,254,Lazarus has a more upscale  polished d cor.  Nice choice if you want to impress a date or relax in a more refined environment.  Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.   The beer was good and the breakfast taco was excellent 
Lazarus Brewing,255,How do I give a 7 star   My buddy has been begging me to visit Lazarus Brewing since it opened.  Since I am not a big beer fan  I was reluctant.  I discovered that I am a fan of GREAT beer.  The atmosphere is fabulous  casual  trendy and very comfortable.  The chairs  tables  furniture and design features are impressive.  The owners clearly put a ton of dollars into this place.  Now back to the beer.  The menu lists numerous speciality craft beers with detailed descriptions of all the beers.  I can t even remember which beers I drank  but they were both as good anything we tasted in Germany.  The staff is very friendly  knowledgeable and more than willing to guide you through all the menu items.  They also have wine  numerous coffee types and other soft drinks.  And finally   they actually have a generous water dispenser with real glasses.  Thank you.  And the biggest surprise  the tacos were amazing.  We started with chips and pico  which was also perfect.   The tacos arrived along with bottles of a red and green sauce.  I would go back to Lazarus just for these sauces.   Try them on the chips  wow.   The prices on everything are incredibly reasonable.  If you plan on going on the weekend  get there early  we tried to go on a Saturday  and as you would expect  they were incredibly busy.  Lazarus is to beer and tacos  what Franklin s is to barbecue.
Lazarus Brewing,256,TRENDY FUN HIPSTER-ISH AUSTIN EXPERIENCE- GREAT PLACE.         Lazarus is a brewery in Austin that creates really interesting  themed  and fully-developed beers. They don t seem to experiment much  but they ve perfected the art of brewing the double IPA and the Belgian Strong Golden Ale. The atmosphere is busy  even on a Wednesday  and the service is rushed. The brewers know beer  though  and and willing to share their expertise.        Amandus Belgian Strong Golden Ale  bold with banana  pear  clove and plenty of power for a light beer  this one s a gold medal winner. Highly recommended  and I typically only drink IPAs and stouts.        THEIR BEST BEER  Their double IPA  the Double Pedestrian. It s citra and simcoe hops  and Is full of bitter  juicy grapefruit flavor. Try it. You can chew on this beer.        WHAT NOT TO TRY  don t bother with the Desperaux French saison.        We loved the Jolted Phoenix coffee-Infused golden ale  as well as the Nottingham English ipa. The Nottingham is truly fig  toffee  and tea flavored- they aren t kidding. The Jolted Phoenix is simultaneously somehow coffee-tasting and deeply golden. Loved both.        Their tacos are full of meat- simple and wild and wonderful.
Lazarus Brewing,257,Whether you are a local or from out of town  if you are looking for a good beer  from light to dark bodied  go here  Every beer I have had  all but one  including the homemade root beer  is solid.   Because of the amazing beer  the delicious tacos  breakfast or dinner style   the superb service  and the great ambiance  I am definitely a believer and a patron. Austin is spoiled with great beer throughout the city  but this place definitely has me keep coming back  Highly recommend.
Lazarus Brewing,258,RAD. Can t wait to go back. Outstanding atmosphere  open concept architecture and done right  super cool knowledgeable staff AND the tacos and tortas are insane    try breakfast torta   .  I give 5 Lazarus stars because it s the quintessential east side dig that fosters conversation with intellectual and talented patrons mainly because of it s  heady  decor and creative menu- The beers live up to their thoughtful names and their designations . See ya ma ana...
Lazarus Brewing,259,Fun and cute brewery pub bar on the east side. Has a small amount of parking but I would recommend taking an uber there because it is hard to find a spot in the area.  AMAZING QUESO. My friends and I  about 8 people  ordered and finished 3 skillets of queso and a few of them ordered various tacos and really enjoyed them.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating - sometimes with live music outside with local bands. They have some wine as well but a very limited selection.   Cute venue to grab a drink and have a chill night.
Lazarus Brewing,260,They were very organized when it came to ordering beer and food before seating yourself. They had plenty of seating space even with the social distancing. Food came out pretty quick. Beer was delicious and so were the tacos  We tried the chipotle chicken  carne asada and carnitas tacos and they were all great 
Lazarus Brewing,261,Dope tacos  dope vibes and good coffee.  Perfect spot to chill and get some work done or relax with friends. Decent parking for where it s at.  Friendly staff.   All the tacos are super flavorful. Definitely will be coming back 
Lazarus Brewing,262,Phenomenal tacos  great atmosphere. I actually went back for more tacos because they were so good. The service is alright  but the bartenders could be a little more friendly. They re kind of in robot mode where you can t tell if they enjoy working there or not.  I also bought a couple of cappuccinos  both good. They have a Slayer espresso machine  which was cool to see  they re insanely expensive and you don t see them much .   There were lots of dogs to pet  so that was also a plus. I would definitely come back here if in the area again.
Lazarus Brewing,263,This place some inventive flavors that I really enjoy. One of the places I always suggest when people talk beer. I absolutely love the look of the place  In the summer they have fan misters running. The outdoor seating area is pleasant. The people behind the counter sometimes appear to not want to be bothered by describing beer and prefer you order and go  but I don t let that bother me much.
Lazarus Brewing,264,I loved the beer  amp  food. I favored the Achilles Heel -dry stout  which was super. I hear they like to change up their beers often. They also  have a great selection of tacos. I had a Carnitas  amp  a Pollo Verde  w avocado . The green salsa was very tasty  red was spicy. The chicken was outstanding.   The atmosphere  amp  decor was very appealing. Loved the turquoise  logo  Achilles hanging out on the wall. I got there quite early for my ladies beer drinking group and sat at the bar. With the exception of the first curly headed kid  who was kinda a punk  the service was excellent too. I ordered a sampler and the kid gave me the Double IPA instead of the dunkle  he told me he didn t need to write it down. Then when I told him I drink according to IBUs he told me they were in order  amp  made a slight smart alleck remark. They were not in IBU order. I m an older woman  amp  I don t think he listened well and I know what I m drinking. No matter  liked the next several people who served me. I ll be back 
Lazarus Brewing,265,It s great that there s both indoor and plenty of outdoor seating here. Tacos   misted fans to keep you cool are awesome  
Lazarus Brewing,266,I come for the tacos and the atmosphere.  This is probably a very controversial topic  but I think these are top 5 best tacos in town. Nothing too fancy just delicious simple tacos Breakfast and lunch tacos are both great .  This is starting to become an east side staple sticking to the east side art hipster vibe  plenty of seating   free WiFi   live music   great customer service  quick food  cheap beer.  The beer is hit or miss  I have a few go to s now  but I like to try the rotating menu. But plenty of options for any beer drinker.  Keep up the good work and don t go a changing
Lazarus Brewing,267,Lazarus Brewing was a favorite during our one recent trip to Austin  The music was great  the staff were fun  but the food and beer were phenomenal    Right when we stepped out of our uber  we could tell this place was hopping   It was crowded everywhere.  We finally found two spots at the bar where we sat  ordered beer and food.  They had a fun and lively crowd that consisted of college to middle aged individuals.  The music was quirky and perfect for the scenery.  We really enjoyed it   OMG the food was TO DIE FOR    I ordered the carnitas and carne asada tacos. We split the chorizo cheese dip.  It was fondue-like and I basically ate it with my fork.  Let s just say nothing was left behind   I forgot what stout beer I had  but it was delicious.  I d love to go back again 
Lazarus Brewing,268,We stopped by for lunch amd were not disappointed. The beer was good amd the tacos were amazing.  The tacos are really big portions so with a guac amd chips appetizer each of us cold only finish 2 tacos. I highly recommend the pastor taco.
Lazarus Brewing,269,Lazarus brewing is amazing if you want good beer and amazing tacos go there. They have amazing queso verde and there chips are made in house the owner is amazing and I am sure you will love it.
Lazarus Brewing,270,Great new addition to the East  side  6th Street  A full selection of beers  including the recently added   Ulysses-Irish Red   Coffee  Espresso  amp  Lattes.  The atmosphere and staff are warm  amp  inviting  with suggestions and or tastings. There s plenty of seating at the bar  high top tables or outdoors. The tanks are visible directly behind the taps  so one gets both the feel of being in a brewery  while simultaneously enjoying a beer  and sampling one or more of the menu options like many other brewpubs.  Back to the beers  which of course is why you are reading about Lazarus BREWING  I sampled had 6 of their 7 offerings and all were well crafted  tasty and hit the mark squarely for their respective style    1  Nottingham-English  inventors of the style  IPA  was as expected  nice hop aroma and not overly bitter.  2  Ulysses-Irish Red  malty but not too sweet  with a slight crisp bite in the finish.  3  Shackleton-English Premium Bitter   don t let the  Bitter  in the name fool you  malty  dark  refreshing  so far  my anytime   go to beer. 4  Amandus-Belgian Strong Golden Ale  Belgian notes evident right away which nicely give way to a refreshing  Proseco like finish   as was perfectly described by my server  and the 8.3  is not easily detected. 5  Double Predestination-Double IPA  the malt body balances the hop profile nicely  refreshing  amp  juicy and again  the 8.2  is barely noticeable. 6  Achilles Heel-Dry Stout  on Nitro   Who needs a Guiness  when there s Achilles Heel. Toasty  roasty and the 4.0  makes it easy to down several  20 oz  pints   So go to Lazarus  imbibe  get to know your staff  ENJOY   Cheers 
Lazarus Brewing,271,As far as a bar goes  this lace has an ambiance of a lounge.  Comfy chairs and really good music.  Coffee as well as house beers and some good looking food.  Beer in house isn t the best in the area.  They hit all the styles  but their IPA just didn t do it for me.  But pretty large list and flights of 5 available for less than  15.  Overall a nice spot directly center on 6th of a bunch of bars and food so a good spot to start or end a night bar hopping in the area.
Lazarus Brewing,272,So glad I found this great spot before I left Austin  It was only one of a few places that offer flights so that we could try a handful of the local craft beers  Their patio area is super inviting and the diversity of their selection is great for all lovers of beer. My girlfriend and I loved the Queen Lucy. Their rotating selection means there s always a reason to come back 
Lazarus Brewing,273,Eat tacos  drink beer  skip the guac.   Good tacos. Great beer. Ample seating. Terrible guacamole. Why did you put lettuce in there  You can t fool me twice charging  8 for lettuce filled guac again.
Lazarus Brewing,274,Breweries  restaurants  and coffee shops that can scale with business acumen sit highly in my rankings. Case in point  the Patron Saint business model. Those who purchased a  1000 artisan-blown glass goblet effectively netted a  5000 present value return  by my calculation as of Cinco De Mayo of 2017 . The benefits for Lazarus likewise compound  saints will bring in more people  and the  1000 cash infusion sets the operation on a strong trajectory.  Onto the actual content. Lazarus does all physically consumable things with excellence  hiring talent in the kitchen to product quality  authentic tacos and queso fundido  you will need to use an exfoliant facewash after eating it   bringing in some of the best brewing masterminds in the industry  and in-housing the roasting of coffee beans.  Additionally  partnerships with local non-profits  an affinity for the local Christian church  you ll hear the Gospel message on Christmas eve   and a community-oriented  unique  and inviting space set Lazarus above the pack. And when I say pack  I mean... amongst coffee shops  breweries  and restaurants alike.  You may have read all the way to the bottom and asked  what should I get  With a stacked beer rotation  fully satiating tacos and tortas  and fresh-from-the-roaster-herself coffee... you can t go wrong.
Lazarus Brewing,275,I love this place. Always good food. Great beer. Spacious. They have music outside sometimes. Cool looking space. Reliable place to go  and this is a place I do  and will  frequent.
Lazarus Brewing,276,We arrived in Austin and headed out from our east side bungalow to explore. Lazarus appealed to us as the owner  here in yelp  stated they have a focus on lager and Pilsen style beer.   They don t. But they do have one nice pils...  That little too but aside  very cool joint  Plenty of beers on tap to please IPA lovers  like every f in brewery. Guys  there are other styles of beer  and they also do tacos and coffee.   The vibe was very cool. Very friendly. While I had hoped to sample a few lagers  over all  it s a sweet spot 
Lazarus Brewing,277,I visited Lazarus to refill my water containers during the recent snowstorm in Austin  purchased a couple of delicious tacos as well    and the team was nothing short of accommodating  kind  and efficient. Even when I called ahead of time to confirm that they still had potable water  the man on the phone made it clear that even if I didn t want to order food  I could just skip the line and go straight to the bar and someone would be there to take care of me. When I did arrive  the bartender offered to take my whole bag of bottles to fill them up while I ordered my food. The restaurant industry in Austin really knows how to step up for the city  and I m forever grateful. Lazarus Brewing has just gained a new repeat customer  and I will be bringing all of my friends there  Thank you all so much   
Lazarus Brewing,278,This place was pretty good  but very limited on food items  since it s mainly a bar type of setting. The food was delicious  but pretty pricey. The beer was very good  They had a lot of options for beer that weren t typical beers. Lots of flavors from fruity to coffee to chocolatey.   There were limited places to sit only because it was packed  but thankfully we found a place. Otherwise  they do have a lot of seating. We were hoping for more than just tacos  but there s only like 3 different types of food to choose from.  Overall it was a pretty good place  just thought it would have had more to eat  since with good beer  you need good food.   Parking is limited. Good luck trying to find a place to park that is close. I believe we parked like 4-5 blocks down away from the place. Just expect to walk.
Lazarus Brewing,279,Can t speak for the beer as I didn t drink. The server was short and unfriendly taking orders. Tacos were just meat in a corn tortilla. LOVED the space however. Pretty crowded.
Lazarus Brewing,280,This brewery is awesome  I loved the selection of beers and the outdoor space was so nice. I got a flight and tried 5 different beers and my favorite was the Amandus. They also serve wine and coffee and some food. There is a bunch of bars and breweries in the area but I loved hanging out on the back patio and sipping some brews. It was pretty packed but a really great way to spend the afternoon 
Lazarus Brewing,281,Favorite place for a brew anytime of day. Great spot to crank out emails while enjoying a coffee or beer at the bar. Often local music playing on the weekends with a wonderful outdoor atmosphere to geT the downtown vibe without having to fight the downtown traffic. The prodigal is a must try beer as its the original  so I ve been told . We always take friends here  groups small and large.
Lazarus Brewing,282,Great guac and chips  and great Hefe. Wish I had time to go again before leaving town  Also enjoyed the porter. Has some snack options that were veg friendly  the guac  a veggie taco .
Lazarus Brewing,283,I ate before I went. Will definitely be going back so I can try the food. Very friendly and helpful staff. Clean restroom.
Lazarus Brewing,284,Hadn t been back in awhile  after some let downs with the food. Went this morning and was quickly reminded why. I wish I had been told my taco would primarily onions  and I would have ordered differently. Besides that  it was really soggy and inedible. 2 tacos straight in the trash unfortunately
Lazarus Brewing,285,This place trash. Beer just isnt creative or executed well  the bartenders are drones  and the merch is SUPER overpriced. Bye.
Lazarus Brewing,286,Awesome locale great place for tacos and beer.Hands down the best breakfast taco I have ever had. Wish I had a place like this back home.
Lazarus Brewing,287,Absolutely love this brewery. I love grabbing a beer with my breakfast tacos in the morning.
Lazarus Brewing,288,Definitely the nicest brewery we went to in Austin. The ambiance is incredibly hip  cozy and welcoming. Kind of hipsterish but I could deal with it. The IPA s were bomb and I loved how they had a full on coffee bar for those that don t drink. That area seemed popular too as the foot traffic was heavy. Back patio area available too and dog friendly. Solid spot worth checking out
Lazarus Brewing,289,This is my favorite place in Austin to get drinks. It s a little further out from the heart of Sixth Street  so it s a quieter place to enjoy drinks outside. The craft beer is fantastic and there is always something new to try. Their tortas are to die for. A great place to bring people who are new to Austin.
Lazarus Brewing,290,Nice spot with a lot of seating inside and out. Had a couple of IPA s  quac and chips. The beer was tasty and the chips that came with the quac  were homemade and phenomenal.   This brewery is dog friendly. Try and stop out when they have a band outside. Overall a lovely afternoon.
Lazarus Brewing,291,The beer here is wonderful but the service makes me wonder if they are somehow torturing the baristas and bartenders or they are all so overworked they are clinically depressed. I have given Lazarus a number of tries and each time I feel unwelcome and bummed out after ordering and paying. The women are friendly but the men working here refuse to make eye contact during transactions  NEVER smile and answer with monosyllables. It s the most unfriendly place on the Eastside  which is kind of ironic given that it s run by a pastor and is supposed to be a place where you feel community.    Another hint for management  when the server puts the food down on the table  please teach them to make eye contact  say  Here s your food   and ask if this is what you ordered and if you have everything you need. The servers put down food like a drive by  grab your number and leave without a word. Would it hurt them to exchange a sentence  Why are people acting like robots here  Do you need more staff to allow people to act like human beings   The server should ask if you need anything else and tell you where salsa is...since you are serving tacos in Austin  it s likely people want salsa. I have no problem with the DIY aesthetic but the communication is abysmal.  Why should the customer need to go wait in line again to learn salsa is in a little refrigerator in the corner  from someone who seems annoyed to be asked    You all need to do better in the service department to not alienate your customers. I get that everybody has a bad day. But at Lazarus it seems like EVERY day is a bad day for your staff. They never smile  never say thank you  never say you re welcome when I say Thank you  and only look at the register  never at me. Seriously  I ve been here more than a dozen times and never had a positive interaction at the bar. I m a super kind and friendly gal and I live nearby so I d love to make this a place I go regularly  but I m about fed up with the hostility or whatever is the problem with the people working at Lazarus Brewing. Please do better.
Lazarus Brewing,292,Great seating for large groups. Beer  wine  and coffee. Was so glad they had a full coffee bar for me to drink while my friends drank beer. Very YoPro Austin crowd. Dogs allowed. Street parking a findable and free nearby.
Lazarus Brewing,293,Great beer with lots of variety  with something suiting everyone s taste. Nice chips and queso. Food wasn t so great but ambience was very relaxing
Lazarus Brewing,294,First stop off the airplane when we got to Austin and it set expectations high. Hazy IPAS were really good and liked the outside seating. Plus there is a food truck and a vegan food truck across the street 
Lazarus Brewing,295,We liked this place so much we visited it twice during our long weekend in Austin. Hubby liked the fact that he could also get a gourmet coffee after his beer. I was a huge fan of the saison while my friends did the flights. The menu is simple and straightforward with the tacos. Great patio where kids and dogs were running around.   Service was helpful  the 1st time we sat at the bar then a few days later we sat outside. Gorgeous day to be out in the sun with their communal dining and a few spots were shaded as well.
Lazarus Brewing,296,Such a great spot to hangout and chill with friends anytime. They have live music on the weekends or on Fridays  which makes it such a great atmosphere. Great selection of brews and even wine too 
Lazarus Brewing,297,Part coffee shop part breweries on the East Side. Can t get any more hipster than that. This place is much larger than it looks  plenty of sitting inside and the whole outside is open too. They have a pretty diverse selection. Pours range from 12oz - 20oz depending on the beer. I got the Despereaux which was a really good saison. Typically I don t like my saisons too fruity which is exactly what this beer offered.
Lazarus Brewing,298,Cute place to grab a drink or tacos with friends. I was in Austin for the day  so we stopped here for a flight  5 tastes for  12.50 . Loved the inside decor and how reasonable the prices were.
Lazarus Brewing,299,With all the construction going on around this place  I m glad I was persistent and found it  Small batch brewery with great indoor outdoor spaces. Dog friendly  free wifi. Most importantly  great and interesting selection of their beers many of which were aromatic and hazy  quite drinkable.
Lazarus Brewing,300,I ve been going to Lazarous since its opening. I live a few block aways.  Interestingly  the beer is good but the food is outstanding  Not sure where they sourced the cooks recipes  but the Mexican tacos and tortas remind me of Mexico City.   Cheers
Lazarus Brewing,301,Great place to watch sporting events... one large TV.  Great food and beer  A very chill vibe and patio seating.
Lazarus Brewing,302,Okay beer. Expensive compared to other local breweries. Unfriendly staff. This joint is trying way too hard.
Lazarus Brewing,303,Where to start  For those quick yelpers  yes  this is a MUST STOP if you re in the area. Amazing tacos  unbelievable beer selection  and irreplaceable staff.   Not so quick yelpers  Hello  Not enough awesome things to say about this spot. Chill vibes  live music on weekends  outdoor seating  AMAZING tacos  and last but certainly not least  the BEER    Morning person  You re set. BREAKFAST TACOS are unreal. Bacon black bean is my go-to. Latte along with that and my mornings are set. Great coffee espresso   Afternoon evenings   Yep.   If you re an IPA fan  40 days 40 nights is my favorite. Can t stop leaving without a canned growler  yes you can grab one on your way out   they ll bottle it right in front if you    Wine drinkers  They ve got you covered too  Their wine vendors have amazing taste. Have yet to be let down with their selection. You re set.   This is a must-see if you re around the east side. Whether for a quick beer  or a longer evening with some tacos and a flight  you re covered.   The staff you ask   I ve had the pleasure of being served by Brandy  Jess  and a few others   I d honestly have to write a whole separate 5 star review for them  but you get the point.   Cheers 
Lazarus Brewing,304,Love this place. Always bring my pup and do work. The cask house they built is the best. Beers great  coffee Is damn good  and the tacos are amazing. Always get the carnitas.
Lazarus Brewing,305,Came to this brewery in downtown Austin. It was amazing. Was really hungry and I had the pollo verde tacos . They were delicious  I was in luck as the brewery had released that same day a new sour beer with the Blue Owl brewery 
Lazarus Brewing,306,Love Laz  I m here more than I d care to admit and always have a good time. It s casual and fun  and the beer is delicious.  There s indoor and outdoor seating  so it s dog friendly. I ve seen kids  but none have been a nuisance. There are misters outside for hot days  and most of it is shady. There s a little library where you can borrow a book while you re there  and it s a pretty good selection.  The staff are great. Friendly and knowledgeable. They are good at recognizing folks and are happy to give you a sip of something to see if you like it before you buy.  The tacos are great  I recently stopped eating meat  so I can only eat the black bean tacos now  but those are good. The carnivore tacos are bomb. They have fish tacos on Fridays  starting at 4  and they are AWESOME. Want them to be full-time or to have another option for veggies in the interim. The sides are pretty decent.  Favorite beers  Pacific Coast Highway  pils   Amelie  3  French ale   and Amandus  Belgian strong golden ale . Get a flight  and just do it.
Lazarus Brewing,307,Many great beers to sample.  The pico was to die for. Great service and a good vibe in this trendy brewery in Austin.
Lazarus Brewing,308,A very fun and relaxed brewery. The location is really ideal and not busy with traffic  I was able to find street parking not a far walk away. What I liked most about this brewery was the atmosphere  there were people on the patio and inside conversing  someone inside working on his computer and I had settled on one of their couches and there was no disruption in the atmosphere. Their beer selection was really incredible to choose from  but since I was driving I only got the Cool and the Gang  a sour English mild  which was delicious.   All in all  I really love his brewery and if I hadn t eaten somewhere else I would have gotten some of their food as well since they had it. The bartenders were also incredibly friendly and knew so much about the selection  they really help you settle on what you re looking to drink for the evening. All in all  you should definitely swing by this brewery if you re in the Austin area  the ambiance of the place alone is worth the visit 
Lazarus Brewing,309,Amazing tacos  beer and coffee.  No more needs to be said   This place is very cool.  Converted old gas station turned into a superb gastro pub.  The queso Fundido is the best in town.  Believe me you will have a great time at this place.
Lazarus Brewing,310,This is a really neat restaurant  They have an interesting selection of beer and the tacos I had were awesome  Our food was served quickly and cleared quickly. Service is great here. The outside patio is awesome  My only complaint is the parking. It was a little tricky but worth it  The green and red sauce they give on the side are definitely worth trying too  Such a fun place. It was even busy at an off hour. I recommend this place  
Lazarus Brewing,311,The beer and ambiance here are great  Both the indoor and outdoor areas have lots of seating options. The beer is also so delicious  so much so that both my roommate and I like it  and neither of us are really beer people.
Lazarus Brewing,312,Loved it  Awesome atmosphere and live music. Felt very relaxed and easy going. The lights and ambience were nice. I could hang out here all day. I did not try their tacos but they looked really good and pretty cheap. The beer choices were more along the lines of a Belgian  European style. Even though I m not a Belgian beer person  I would definitely go back. My favorite beer was the American IPA. Prices were good and the staff was friendly. Limited parking that I saw.
Lazarus Brewing,313,This place gets busy so come early.  Family friendly and dog friendly.   Decent selection of taps but I m not really a fan of coffee beer so be wary of that.   Nice and clean place and no complaints.  Would recommend and will return
Lazarus Brewing,314,This was our first stop on our vacation in Austin and it definitely set the bar very high. We had a flight of beer and we are particularly impressed with holy mother of God. We also enjoyed a few of their tacos and would highly suggest the Pollo Verde. We were there on a Friday for lunch and it was pretty darn busy.
Lazarus Brewing,315,Just visiting from New England  but I love craft brewing  and Lazarus offers  all-around  one of the solidest lineups of beers and menu items I ve seen in the US. Such impressively wide brewing influences - French ales  Saison  English IPA  stouts - their brewer has clearly learned widely. My favorite was the 40 Days and 40 Nights IPA  rightfully dubbed their  desert island  brew  being the one selection I would take with me on a desert island. A bit cloudy and very well balanced  though still not quite on par with Vermont IPAs I know .   Only tried the chips and guacamole  delicious   but a fellow customer had the tacos and said they were outstanding.  Staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Chatted with one of the owner-investors who is from Montana. Only one year in and they are winning brewers awards. Great fun place and one to watch if you know and care about great local beer.
Lazarus Brewing,316,Lazarus has NO BUSINESS being this good at Mexican Food AND Beer .  Im legit Mexican  like born there  like Spanish was my first language like my grandma and mom taught me to hand make everything.  This place has legit tacos   but the tortas are my favorite. Salsa is spicy and tasty. Al pastor is fun and filling  I love the food.   We saw some World Cup games here and it s fun and they have specials.  Y all should come in grab a pint  grab a torta  listen to the dope live music  and enjoy austin.   The restrooms are generally clean and easy to use. Especially for a bar setting 4 5
Lazarus Brewing,317,Came to check out what the hype was about this brewery and walked away feeling happily  tipsy  and very satisfied.   I actually came just for the brews and man I was blown away. I got their Robust Porter -  Signs  amp  Wonders  and the name justified the experience. Coming from Oregon  I ve got to taste the best beers of the country  only to find that this porter has sneaked into my top 3 porters that I ve greatly enjoyed.   Oregon breweries still hold a special place in my heart  but Texas breweries seem to quickly close the gap to being the best in the country. Wish you guys the best of luck 
Lazarus Brewing,318,Good vibe  beer was good too  I like the explanation they give for each beer they offer. Good patio seating  dog friendly  indoor area as well 
Lazarus Brewing,319,Great brewery.  We came in and had their new Octoberfest beers  Big Top and Katie s  and both were really good.  The place was absolutely packed but they are following all of the distancing measures  ensuring everyone wears a mask  and doing all they can to keep the place sanitized.  There was a really long line for beer orders but it moves pretty quick.  The food is also really tasty  especially the queso fundido.   Outdoor seating is plentiful.
Lazarus Brewing,320,Such good tacos and brew  Coffee and tea also. Really nice outdoor space as well  Definitely recommend. Order at the bar and they ll bring it out 
Lazarus Brewing,321,This brewery won me over during SXSW. They had stellar bands performing from all over the world. A muy excellent music showcase I was impressed they got such big name international bands to play here. Open to public too  Also the layout was super cool and easy and very nice staff. Fresh beers and good tacos here for the pickiest of eaters 
Lazarus Brewing,322,Lazarus Brewing was founded by Christian Cryder and his wife Marilyn who relocated to Austin from Montana.  Christian was previously in the tech industry  and a pastor.  They have accomplished their goal of creating a great community spot to hangout.  Lazarus is located in an amazing space.  There are unique different hang out areas.  I loved the living room lounge area  the community tables and the outdoor patio sections.  I also love their logo and glassware.  Unfortunately  the beer itself was just OK  nothing amazing.  They also roast coffee  and I found that my glass of cold brew was being sipped on more by my friends than their beers   They have done a nice job on the caffeine.  They also serve wine and tacos.  So lots of options to choose from.  The place was busy on a Saturday and it was tough to find a space.  The parking is limited  just a couple of spots out front.  Mostly street parking  which is typical for this part of town.  Awesome venue to just sit back and hang out with your friends.
Lazarus Brewing,323,Stopped by this place because of the reviews. Very cool  casual place. The fish and carne asada tacos were excellent. The food here is fantastic.  There are a lot of places to sit. You order at the front. There are no waitresses. It makes it a peaceful place. Lots of dogs here. Must be a place where the neighborhood is full of dogs. There is outside and inside seating. Great place. It s very busy so the drinks must be good as well.
Lazarus Brewing,324,Highly recommend. This place is awesome. The tacos are great. Beer is on point. Tons of great selections to choose from. I really noticed how legit the atmosphere was. Everything was done with excellence. Staff was friendly and helpful too.
Lazarus Brewing,325,A true east Austin gem. Great for working  dinner with the girls or date night. I had the walks on water IPA  delicious   It was a little perfumey so if you like more traditional IPAs  go for 40 days  40 nights  so good   The tacos were probably one of the best I ve had in Austin so far  being from Chicago  it s hard to impress me with food. Unfortunately  Austin has mostly fallen short of anywhere I ve dined in Chitown  but this place is definitely on Chicago brewery dining levels.
Lazarus Brewing,326,Tasty beers  great tacos  solid service  wonderful setting  great people watching.  Parking sucks  but to be expected given the area.    Met a friend here end of last week to let off some steam and really had a great time.  Loved the Blushing Bride  orange blossom tripel  while my friend downed several Amandus  nice Belgian .  We both had al pastor tacos  which were solid.  Very cool addition to the area and some seriously tasty beer.
Lazarus Brewing,327,This place looks great  but their service is terrible. We were doing a brewery bus tour with around 15 people on Sat. I got to the area early and parked at Lazarus  went in to get a taco and wait for the others to show up  I organized the whole thing . I waited for 30 min exactly. I ordered at the bar  walked out to get a picnic table  then walked directly back in because my food never came out. I sat at the bar  and numerous employees walked by me  saw me  no one asked if I needed anything or where the food was. Never got my food. I had to go meet the party  so I left.   We planned on coming back to this place at the end of tour to eat and do some tastings  instead I took my party of 17 down the street where we would actually be served. If they were too busy to wait on just me  no way would we ever get service with that many people.
Lazarus Brewing,328,This was the third brewery we went to and normally  after having been to that many breweries in a single day  the third brewery gets the crap end of the stick. By that time  all IPAs are hoppy  all Blondes Kolschs are too light and the milk stouts are too damn sweet. However  Lazarus was the third brewery of the day and made me say   Damn  what was I doing at all those other breweries     First of all  when you walk in it doesn t feel like the average brewery that s in some warehouse in a business park. It s a really cool space that ll make you want to just hang out there. The staff is awesome  as well. They seemed to be really patient  which is a plus because they have great beer  good coffee  and good food. I m sure they have to handle a lot of people that walk in and have no idea what they want. In fact  while we were there some guy got a taste of a beer and wanted to stop and pick up every taste in his one ounce pour. The girl at the counter was so patient. Hell  he was even getting on my nerves.  We ordered the chips and guac and they were so good. The chips tasted fresh and the guac was so flavorful. This is saying a lot from someone who grew up in SoCal where we put guac avocados on errrything.   Ok  on to the beer. My favorite was the Saison. Why  Because brewers are so hop-sessed these days that I feel like Saison doesn t get the shine it deserves. I mean  this beer was originally brewed for thirsty farmers. It s a very refreshing style  And  Lazarus did the style justice. They didn t try to dry hop it or do anything crazy. It was a great Saison. The IPA was good  too  but my other favorite was the DIPA. It was juicy and well balanced. AKA  you don t need to be a hop head to enjoy this.  Thank you  Austin  for Lazarus Brewing.
Lazarus Brewing,329,Tacos are delicious  I got the Barbacoa and al pastor. The setup service is a little weird but everyone was super nice and it s cool that you can do coffee  tacos  and or beer depending on your mood.   It has a great vibe for getting work done -- lots of laptops in the middle of the day and the servers were very friendly  Def recommend if you re in the neighborhood.
Lazarus Brewing,330,Something amazing is brewing on E. 6th Street.  This place is both a coffee roaster  and a beer brewery. They ve got a pretty cool setup here with their brewing  with a bunch of fermentation tanks behind the bar going that are brewing up some fantastic beers. I opted for the imperial IPA  which is usually an over-the-top type of beer that has a lot of bitterness. However  this one was full bodied  but not overly hoppy- a great balance of malt and bitterness that s hard to find in an imperial IPA. No bitter beer face here   The bartender barista was knowledgeable about the beers  and made some great recommendations. He knew what went into the beer  and could articulate the beer quite well.  The place was clean  well lit and comfy with large tables outside  big sofas inside  and plenty of places to plug in. I really enjoyed the decor  with Achilles  the metal elk overlooking the bar. Look closely  and you ll see that he s really made of servicemen s dog tags. Deep   The bookshelves were lined with books on Harry Potter  Frodo  and all kinds of books in a series. You can tell that someone really thought this out instead of just buying the  books by the yard  for decoration.  I was wildly impressed by this place. They have a great beer list of their own beers  coffee  food  and tea. I will certainly return. Apparently  they have a crystal goblet that you can purchase for a paltry one thousand dollars  and it gives you free beer for life. Why can t I be 21 again 
Lazarus Brewing,331,Lazarus Brewing was the first brewery we hit while visiting Austin. We fell in love with them immediately. Great beers  extremely friendly and helpful servers and very good food options 
Lazarus Brewing,332,RUDE. IMPOLITE.   The atmosphere was pretty rad  but the staff s personality was tasteless  much like the drinks.  Bartender barely made any eye-contact with myself and the two others I was with  and was not helpful when it came to our asking questions. The other guy  probably manager  was also a jerk  curly  nappy hair with glasses   but each time I looked over  they both seemed to have been having great communication with other patrons at the bar - smiling and chatting.   They probably didn t like us as people  which is NOT okay. If you re in the service industry  you treat everyone equally.   I hate you.  Certainly not going back.
Lazarus Brewing,333,Lazarus Brewing was an awesome stop on our Austin trip. The outdoor area was a a fantastic place to enjoy a beer and some chips with friends. The vibes were awesome  even on a cloudy day . Especially loved the fact that this is a dog friendly establishment- it made the visit even better. If I end up in Austin again I would certainly go again.
Lazarus Brewing,334,I am visiting Austin and checked out most of the local brewing places. This one is excellent. The beers have a clean filtered polished taste and are served very cold. They have some nice English ale options rather than just aggressive IPAs. Nice atmosphere inside. I would recommend this place is worth going to.
Lazarus Brewing,335,Just so impressed with this place. Great coffee  great breakfast tacos  great service and ambience too  Come get here you wont regret it
Lazarus Brewing,336,Great beer. Beautiful ambience. Nice staff. What else can I say  The mid-century modern decor is adding a classy touch to the whole room  but they kept it approachable and laid-back. They had great sour beer on tap  
Lazarus Brewing,337,Moderate prices  great breakfast tacos  stellar beer selection - it gets busy for a reason. Great study spot  their fast  100 Mbps  wifi rocks. However  they don t have Splenda or even standard sugar. Only raw sugar and honey to sweeten coffee.
Lazarus Brewing,338,Summary  Great tacos and great beer   I ve been here twice and I love the beer and the tacos. The chicken tacos were only a couple buck but they were delicious. I love the red and green sauce you can pour on them. My fav was the red sauce. I m not much of a beer drinker  but they had two light beers on tap that I really enjoyed. The outdoor patio was quieter with mist fans to help you keep cool. I also like how they have parking right in front or to the side of the building. Def will visit this place again 
Lazarus Brewing,339,We really enjoyed this place. Huge variety of drinks. They also sell coffee and food but we only got drinks. Lots of seating and prompt service.
Lazarus Brewing,340,Cool cups  great authentic Mexican food and nice relaxing comfortable environment to hang out . The people working are friendly and nice . They make sure your order is correct .
Lazarus Brewing,341,Had a really great lunch here after a few hours of climbing at the Austin Bouldering Club  I expected the food menu to be a bit more extensive  but it is a Brewing company after all  so I can t really fault them  I ordered two of the black bean tacos and the boy and I split the chips and guacamole  no drinks for us since we were driving my sisters car in a place we are not familiar with  I would say it was quite busy here for being 2pm on a Monday  looked like a lot of people had their laptops logged in and were working as well as some business-like meetings going on. We sat outside on the covered patio which came with a great ambiance and fresh air  without the sun beating down on us. As for the food  I d say it was super fresh and pretty solid  The guac was still chunky  super green and tasted like it was literally just made. Same with my tacos which were so full they required two tortillas  I really enjoyed my lunch here and would suggest it to anyone looking for a quick meal and drink when they are in the area 
Lazarus Brewing,342,Disappointed with the service.  The male beertender acted as if we were an inconvenience when we inquired about the beer.  I ordered tasters and the girl brought out full pours of the 4 beers I ordered.  Once she realized she made a mistake she was pretty upset and yelled out   walked away and then brought pack my tasters.  LAZARUS please remind your employees they are public servants.  We don t demand you to kiss our ass but we do demand respect and courtesy.  3- stars because the IPA s were pretty good.  Please work on the customer service.
Lazarus Brewing,343,Such delicious beers  My favorite is the 40 days and 40 nights. Their food is also really good. I had their pollo verde taco and a chicken fajita taco. They were both so delicious  and the chicken was really tender and flavorful. Their queso fundido is so amazing  especially with the chorizo.
Lazarus Brewing,344,Love this chill atmosphere. A mix of people studying and also drinking. Offers a wide variety of drinks and food
Lazarus Brewing,345,The rudest service I have ever received. No problem with Covid accommodations but being nice is a must at any times.
Lazarus Brewing,346,Such a cool place  Previously tried the 40 Days and 40 Nights  delicious IPA  at another local brewery who were showcasing Lazarus  brews  so tried out the Walks on Water beer. Super dope  Loved the taste and atmosphere of this place. It s definitely very Austin-like. Additionally  I got the queso fundido with chorizo and wasn t disappointed at all. If you like cheese  then get this. It was almost like a Mexican pizza  They got a nice little outdoor area too if you want to melt or turn a few shades darker in the Texas summer heat. Awesome joint  will be back here when in ATX again 
Lazarus Brewing,347,Great substitute for church if you re looking for a Sunday brunch. I love the theme  not too sure if it s a tribute to Friars and monks that brew back in the day or they just really like church lol. Great staff super friendly and helpful. My recommendation the 40 days and 40 nights IPA it s worth the trip. Smooth floral almost citrus IPA.
Lazarus Brewing,348,Great spot  Love the beer and wine I ve had there and the seating and atmosphere is super cute for day drinking or after work happy hour. I need to try the food there but the drinks alone make this a 5 star place 
Lazarus Brewing,349,Talk about a great venue to enjoy fabulous beer.   My wife and I have been on multiple occasions and this place does not disappoint.   The staff is passionate about beer  the owner actually makes an effort to speak with all the patrons and the people we have met thus far are top notch.   Hope this place is a staple for years to come.     Oh.....and the beer is so tasty.    For those Guinness out there.....they have a stout that will knock your socks off.
Lazarus Brewing,350,You get great beer and great tacos. I mean  seriously   how do you go wrong     The employees we talked to were all super friendly and knowledgeable.   Oh and they do have parking  You need to get their early to get the parking but any parking is better than none   The only reason I m not 5 stars is I  feel that the price is a little steep for a brewery. I mean  you don t have bottling or distribution charges  why you so much  
Lazarus Brewing,351,We ordered the Pollo Verde and Carne Asada tortas and they were delicious  The bread was fresh and crispy - overall yummy sandwich  Seriously considering ordering another sandwich after a few more beers.   We also ordered the flight of all beers available and loved the Amandus and the First No l.   Super cute place 
Lazarus Brewing,352,Beers slap  food slaps  music slaps  Came with some family  some of which don t drink   and they had a great time.  Food trucks in the back and dog friendly.  Also the service slaps.  Highly recommend 
Lazarus Brewing,353,Lots of indoor and outdoor patio space and cool decor. This placed was PACKED on a Saturday afternoon. Nice place to hang out right in the heart of hipsterville.
Lazarus Brewing,354,Bad service  ok beer  and the bartenders drank more than I did.    I asked for an ipa the first bartender was awesome.  The second ruined this brewery for us. Actually it was almost funny how he doesn t even try  he answers every question with sarcasm  and a  passive remark. He slams another drink then talks loosely like he s ready to be fired opening a 6 item menu in front of me and my date when I asked him for the IPA that isn t a double. There are only 2 but its another chance for him to be passive agressive pointing to the menu as if he doesn t know the other IPA.  Then vents to his boss about guest s vibes. Maybe if he served his guests they wouldn t be giving him odd vibes.   My wife says it s not a big deal. With more than 20 breweries in austin we ll never be back here. There are three breweries within a mile. Hops and Grain  Zilker Brewery   and Blue owl.
Lazarus Brewing,355,Woke up super hungry for a breakfast taco and walked down to Lazarus on 6th street. Got the chorizo one and it s pretty dang good  Egg  chorizo  cilantro and pico de gallo. Also enjoyed their nitro cold brew. Kicks Starbuck s butt
Lazarus Brewing,356,Lazarus came highly recommended  that only added to our disappointment when we had lunch here. While my wife rated the beer  she had the Despereaux  a solid 10  the food was at best a 4. The veggie queso fundido was basically a sliced onion with some cheese melted on top. The torta cubana was mainly shredded lettuce  wan tomato slices and a ton of black beans  WTF   What little pork it included was more of a garnish than an ingredient. Additionally  the bun was super chewy. With so many great food options to choose from  we won t likely return.
Lazarus Brewing,357,Wow  Beers are fantastic  the Pollo Verde taco is amazing   Service at the bar is wonderful. They also serve wine and coffee and espresso. Seriously  you need to come here if you re remotely interested in any of the above mentioned things. Great place to chill in Austin.
Lazarus Brewing,358,This is a must  Super friendly atmosphere and staff  They offer wine which for the wife of a craft beer lover that only drinks wine  is a crucial deciding factor when we decide where to spend our time. Their food menu is simplistic Mexican offerings of Tortas  tacos and chips  but well executed. We will recommend Lazarus to our friends.
Lazarus Brewing,359,One of my favorite brewery in Austin      It is a nice nice looking spot with great outdoor patio  dog friendly of course. The seatings are comfortable and tasteful. Of course the beers are legit. This brewery is a great Hang out spot for those new to the scene or a veteran. Their beers rotate often so you can always try new brews 
Lazarus Brewing,360,Happened to make it by the opening day  Christmas Eve  while passing through Austin. Had the French Saisson  which was light floral almost a hint of lemon refreshment. The English IPA was malty with a finish of hops. There are several large group tables  bar seating  lounge area  and outdoor seating. They offer a small food menu mainly consisting of tacos and various snacks.
Lazarus Brewing,361,Cortado and carnitas breakfast taco were fantastico  I don t understand the hype of the migas taco. Mind you it was still delicious  but the carnitas was especially amazing  And the cortado was very nice and refreshing   I would recommend this place to friends and family.
Lazarus Brewing,362,A nice spot for hanging out but limited beer selection. For a brewery the beer here is amazing. Parking close by is limited so be prepared to walk or maybe take an Uber.
Lazarus Brewing,363,Teal walls  string lights and tons of outdoor seating  Beer was good. - a lot of French style beers. Our favorite was Amelie  2. We got the guac and chips and they were fresh and delish  The rest of the food looked good too. It was pretty crowded for a Friday afternoon.
Lazarus Brewing,364,Big fan of Lazarus  I ve enjoyed everything I ve eaten here  and everyone I ve ever taken has as well. They have great tacos  SUPER awesome queso fundido  and pretty good beer as well. They also have really great  quality salsa for their tacos  which is a big plus. I hate going to a taco place with boring salsa. That s like 25  of the taco when I eat.  I don t remember every beer I tried  but I remember liking the French ale. At least from my experience  I don t think you re going to be blown away by anything you drink here  but you ll enjoy it. Also  that could just be me. People always tell me I m super critical  I did just give them five stars  but whatever . Really though  I like this place a lot. Friendly staff  quality everything  cool vibes.
Lazarus Brewing,365,The vibe here is the best  It s nice to sit outside especially when there are bands. You can bring your dog here too. The beer is great  my favorite used to be called Jesus walks on water now it s just walks on water. The taco are pretty decent too.. but the guac is a must  
Lazarus Brewing,366,This a great spot    It s super cute and cozy with a lot to offer. It s a mix between a coffee shop  brewery and foodie kitchen which surprisingly all works very well together.   The beer was absolutely delicious with a great selection  Each very unique and tasty. The street tacos were amazing and complimented the beer well     Definitely a must go    Also  there s a cute little outdoor patio that looks like they are expanding it
Lazarus Brewing,367,Awesome evening  so thankful for Eva- brewmaster    Thank you so much for a great experience 
Lazarus Brewing,368,This has become my favorite coffee shop on the east side  Breakfast tacos super tasty. I m sure the beer is good too but I no longer partake. Give it a shot  I assure you that you will not be dissatisfied.
Lazarus Brewing,369,I enjoy having this place on the east side as an alternative to the strictly coffee shops or strictly breweries.   They NEED recycling. I cringe at throwing away my Topo Chico bottles.
Lazarus Brewing,370,Good beer  great atmosphere  food is good.   I would wish that they didn t put lettuce in the bottom of their guacamole and give you a bigger portion for the price  but over all a great place 
Lazarus Brewing,371,Cool vibes. And delicious pico and chips  The beer is heavy on the malts  and staff could smile and be a bit more personable. We are from out town and enjoy learning what the locals like.
Lazarus Brewing,372,It seems that there are breweries popping up nearly every week here in Central Texas  and in a lot of cases  they tend to be the some old  same old. Well  my wife surprised me for my birthday and took me to this cool joint for some R amp R...and beer. Opening the front door  we were greeted by a very friendly and willing to help staff. The guy that took our order  Bryan  was really nice  helpful  and very knowledgeable about both the grub as well as the drink selections. We both got tacos...my wife  the back bean  and for me  one chorizo  one carnitas. Both were delicious and filling...all were topped with their house pico  which is actually quite spicy.  I added house tomatillo sauce as well as habanero sauce  with really kicked the heat into high gear. And since it was my birthday  my lovely wife was also my DD  so she had a cafe mocha while I dug into the expansive beer selection. I got a tasters flight to start  ranging from a lighter kolsch style to the IPA and English styles.  All were very good...their brewmaster knows his stuff. Ended up getting another pint of the Thirsty Pilgrim too. Finally  I tried a sampler of the GOSE  a sour style.  I m not big on this type of beer  but they pulled it off.  There was a lot going on in that beer. I also brought my growler  and got that filled with their 40 days  amp  40 nights IPA. We are already figuring out how to get back there next weekend  and even though it s an hour from our house  the beer  the atmosphere  the food  and the great staff will make us regulars. Thanks again Bryan 
Lazarus Brewing,373,We just visited here for the first time a week or so ago and loved it. Great job at distancing during covid and providing a clean and comfortable environment. Not to mention the food was amazing  
Lazarus Brewing,374,Great tacos  great beer and hell of an ac unit. Not from here but if I ever come back I ll bring friends here.
Lazarus Brewing,375,This may be my favorite stop in Austin  Incredible beers that offer beers that span from porters to lagers and beyond. The flavors you taste are beyond awesome. And let s talk thief tacos... maybe the best in Austin I ve found to date  The people are welcoming and make you feel like you re part of the family. I will be forever a patron as long as they are around  Definitely stop in and enjoy this unforgettable experience.
Lazarus Brewing,376,Lazarus is like a coffee shop but with beer. It has a very chill vibe and when we stopped by on a Thursday around lunchtime  there were several people working on their laptops. We had chips  amp  guacamole  chicken tacos and a beer - everything was delicious. They also had heat lamps on the patio for a chillier day 
Lazarus Brewing,377,Love this place    Everything is SOLID    Where else can you go that has coffee  beer  tacos  tortas  chips salsa guac  and iced cold water    Would def recommend Lazarus. I sampled five beers and all were so fresh tasting and packed with flavor. The gose is amazing and the IPA s are killer 
Lazarus Brewing,378,Best place to get beers in Austin. Really cool vibe without feeling stuck up  great staff  and amazing beers. For the lover of hoppy things I recommend the Double Predestination. Top 5 beers I ve ever had.
Lazarus Brewing,379,Had a great time here on Friday night  My friend lives in a condo nearby so we were able to walk and didn t have to deal with parking. The line was almost out the door when we arrived  but went pretty quick and luckily we were able to find a table  squeezed in with some other nice patrons who were nice enough to scoot over to let our party of 6 sit down .   Tried the King Frank and 40 Days and 40 Nights and both were very good  I preferred the King Frank .  The chicken taco was delicious and the food came out super fast. The sauces they bring are also really good. Will definitely come back here 
Lazarus Brewing,380,Solid spot for coffee and beer. It s only been open for 3 days so far and they seem to have their ish together.
Lazarus Brewing,381,Love this new East 6th brewery. 1st the beers  their variety is ever changing and offers something for everyone s palate  from the novice beer drinker to those seeking the most unique complex . 2nd the atmosphere  indoors or outside  cushy chair or stool at the bar  hang out alone or bring all your friends. 3rd snacks and food  while I haven t had a torta  they look amazing. The street tacos were legit  and cheap  and the fried chickpeas were a solid  slightly spicy snack.  I ve been 3 times already and will go back as much as I can.
Lazarus Brewing,382,Amazing concept...coffee  tacos  beer  and joy. This is a true brewery and fun place to hangout. Just had an Americano and the black been torta for breakfast. The salsa is fantastic and the torta was delicious.
Lazarus Brewing,383,Out of all the brewery pub beer bar options in Austin  Lazarus is my favorite. They ve barely been open a year but are absolutely crushing it with a wide variety of beer styles. Also  Kyle is an amazing person  and your life will be better having met him. He s so happy and helpful    edgelord
Lazarus Brewing,384,As everyone  and their dog   says  this bar is chill. Plenty of space  even when it s busy. Good beer at reasonable prices. Lots of outdoor space  some of which is shaded and amidst the barrels  making for nice ambiance.
Lazarus Brewing,385,Came for the award winning beer and was surprised to find such a wonder place with a wonderful atmosphere  awesome food  and did I mention the BEER  Lord have mercy  Leather tufted couch in chill area is super comfortable. Will grab a growler and ease home.
Lazarus Brewing,386,Best new brew pub in town    Atmosphere is great   Outdoor seating is perfect and lots of parking    Try the 20 lb Brown    He lives  
Lazarus Brewing,387,Our group stopped in for a quick visit on a Tuesday afternoon. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their beers and the bartenders were attentive and quick. I tried the lager and Pilsner  both were crisp and refreshing. I wound up ordering the Slovenian IPA which I have never seen anywhere else. It was interesting  hoppy  and had hints of pineapple. Very good  indeed. I only wish I had gotten some to take home  Side note  this place also has a coffee bar.
Lazarus Brewing,388,The best tacos I ve had in a long time.  Did a flight with 5 solid beers.  Hope to go back someday.
Lazarus Brewing,389,Looking for craft beer and food  This place has both  I enjoyed a flight of five tasty beers  along with breakfast tacos  fried chickpeas  and some awesome queso  Lazarus is a bit pricier than some of the other tap rooms  but the food was delicious and it has a polished atmosphere. I look forward to visiting again.
Lazarus Brewing,390,You must try the Vegan Chocolate Chocolate ice cream with the Achilles Heel dry stout   So delicious and brilliant  I had never paired a beer w ice cream and this one made my day 
Lazarus Brewing,391,Their IPA kills it  their fish tacos stuffed my belly  but it s kinda even better for breakfast tacos - because  at least when I went  it wasn t crowded at all  and my dog got to hog the whole patio and her very own water bowl. The bartenders have zero attitude  they will hook you up.  Oh yeah  and books. Not sports TV  not Rumph TV  books. These guys must be smart.
Lazarus Brewing,392,Great place for an evening drink  The beer was tasty  and love that it s all their own. Strong too   The queso fundido was sooo delicious too  Would come back for that alone. Cool area outside  really enjoyed it.
Lazarus Brewing,393,We stayed just over on 5th St and walked her daily  sometimes multiple times per day .  We started off eating breakfast tacos here on Saturday morning and let me tell you they were delish  I don t even eat eggs but had a few bites of the chorizo  egg  and cheese taco and couldn t say enough good things about them  They have either green or red sauce to top them off and you can t go wrong with either choice  We tried several of their beers and I think the blackberry infused beer was my fave  It kinda had a kombucha vibe to it  My next fave was their PMD  light and easily drinkable.  We then went back Sunday morning to get some brunch lunch. This time we got their chilaquiles  with carnitas  and some tacos  carnitas  amp  pastor .  Just do yourself a favor and get them all  Literally.  While there  we tried a few more beers and chatted with staff about what to do while in Austin. We had great recommendations from them  and they were happy to answer all of our touristy questions. Monday night was our last night there and we finished it at Lazarus  Haha  We ordered one of each type of taco  the Queso fundido  and a couple beers  Needless to say we really liked this place  Chill atmosphere  great food options to go with a nice selection of beer on tap.  Felt like our very own neighborhood bar  We will definitely go back.
Lazarus Brewing,394,Wow this place is good. The ambiance is one of casual luxury. It feels as though you are sitting in the back patio of a rich friend. Their beer is so tasty. I am not a fan of sours or IPAs so I always choose lagers stouts amber ales. They have tables and wifi or picnic tables available for seating. I always have a good time while I am there. I would love to go for a tour sometime  but I have not yet
Lazarus Brewing,395,This is my second visit to Lazarus and I had a solid experience.  The tacos are on point   I had dinner the first time and breakfast on my visit today.  The beer was delicious and Sonia their coffee  The team that works there are friendly and very welcoming.  I stopped by to work for a bit and the environment was perfect for that.  The garage doors were open and the open air made my morning perfect. I would bring work guests and friends to this place.   Salud 
Lazarus Brewing,396,Came here on February 11. Had a good time  the tortas and beer were great  Vibe on the pick nick tables was chill.  Looked at my bank statement today to find server Alli W overcharged my card  5.  Fuck this place and their thieving employees. Won t ever be back.
Lazarus Brewing,397,Fun place to hang out with friends and grab a few good pints. Ambiance was relaxing and casual  which was nice after a long day. The tacos were decent and worth the trip  but a little underwhelming over all. Would certainly visit again  though for the beer and ambiance rather than the snacks.
Lazarus Brewing,398,I have too many great things to say about their beer  coffee  and atmosphere - but right now my belly is thanking me for eating the most delicious meal in town - this chilaquiles. Now  time for a nap.
Lazarus Brewing,399,Good beer selection  solid patio  only been open 3 months. Coffee  tacos  and great beer. Plenty of IPAs  double IPAs  pales  Belgium strong  etc. not that many light beers but might be a seasonal thing.
Lazarus Brewing,400,Great tacos and delicious beer  I think about this place when i return to the mid-west  So tasty    This place has awesome service and eccentric decor. Very clean and worth visiting if you re on east 6th street. I stop in a few times a year when I m in town.
Lazarus Brewing,401,Stopped in to kill time before checking into our hotel. It was a very chill vibe. I got 2 tacos which were super tasty and big. I got the hazy IPA which I thought was really good as well. Worth a stop if you re in the area 
Lazarus Brewing,402,One of my favorite places in Austin. Very good beer  amp  very good tacos with a good atmosphere.. 10 10 recommend checking this place out
Lazarus Brewing,403,Thought this brewery was great  the beers were fresh  and they were knowledgeable about each beer.  The atmosphere was nice as well.  Each beer had its own character.  Overall great brewery with great beer  definitely recommend it.
Lazarus Brewing,404,I ve been craving to come back here every day since my first visit. Delicious beer and ridiculously amazing tacos  Thus far my favorite taco place in Austin  I recommend the carnitas and el Pastor tacos  Killer 
Lazarus Brewing,405,Lazarus is a beautiful brewery with plenty of open air space. I had the King Frank  Franconian lager  and was completely blown away by how smooth and perfectly toasty it was. I loved all of the different eclectic German style beers. The space and ambience make this brewery one that I would definitely return to 
Lazarus Brewing,406,Lazarus brewing has only been open five months or so  but if they keep producing beers of this quality  I ll be glad to add them to Austin s upper echelon of brewpubs. I walked in and was hit in the face by a wonderful grain aroma that you don t usually get unless you brew  so that was a nice surprise. My only complaints are that the tables outside didn t have great coverage from the sun  and the coffee beer tried to be bright and coffee at the same time  which just left me scratching my head and deciding I wouldn t be having that beer again. The stout and the bitter were excellent.
Lazarus Brewing,407,Lazarus has easily moved into a top lunch destination for me especially during the work week. A delicious assortment of house made craft beers  exceptional espresso  and the tacos  Super tasty    Texas prides themselves on tacos. Coming from California  however  I gotta say... sorry Texas you ve got nothing on a California taco  I know  I know that s blasphemous in these parts. Having said that  Lazarus in particular does a killer street taco. Arguably one of the more flavorful street tacos I ve had outside of southern California. Tons of onions and cilantro  citrus with some lime on there. I recommend the Al Pastor and add the Salvadoran Crema for a rich creamy tang. The red and green salsas are also great  flavorful without overwhelming heat. Lastly  the Fundido... and amazing addition to any order. Definitely will continue frequenting this spot  One star off just because accessibility parking is a nightmare right now. So much construction across the street and on their own lot. Also  a lot of pretentious coffee house folks just hogging tables... laptops out and one coffee they bought 2 hours ago ... move over 
Lazarus Brewing,408,This was our first stop in Austin and I am so glad it was  We had a flight  and guacamole  amp  chips. All the beers were delightful and the guacamole was fresh. All guac I ve had before this is garbage and I can t go back.
Lazarus Brewing,409,Pros   - Friendly staff - Good eats - 40 days and 40 Nights IPA is excellent. Well balanced between grapefruit citrus burst and medium bitter finish.   Cons   - So popular  the parking was limited on a Friday around 5 pm.   Tips   - Have the chicken  flour tortilla  tacos. They re more flavorful and less fried meat tasting than the beef tacos. Didn t get a chance to try the pork tacos. The nachos and pico were pretty good too.   - Enjoy the Mexican coke. If you are 40 and older  this is the  real sugar  coke from your childhood.
Lazarus Brewing,410,Beer and atmosphere are 5 star.  I didn t try the food  bur people around me gave it a thumbs-up.
Lazarus Brewing,411,Such a great new spot.  Love the story and that the beer is only sold local.   Just disappointed we aren t local and able to come more often 
Lazarus Brewing,412,Gave Lazarus Brewing two chances and was never blown away  nor severely disappointed on either encounter. The breakfast tacos were hearty and flavorful  the beer was weird but tasty  except for an English tea beer -- ew    and aside from one woman behind the counter who couldn t be bothered with questions from customers  everyone was real friendly. Would I go out of my way to recommend it or go back  Probably not  but if you are in the hood and need a decent spot for food and drinks  Lazarus rises to the occasion.
Lazarus Brewing,413,My least favorite thing about this place is how every day in the winter they open all their windows and doors and everyone in the coffee shop then either leaves or puts on coats and hats and layers to try to keep warm. I  and others  have asked that they not open the doors so that the temperature doesn t drop to frigid temps  and the most recent response from the staff was   Sorry  the owner wants them open.  Seems to me if you re going to charge  3.25 for a 6oz cup of coffee  you should be able to afford to heat cool the place and not freeze your tenants out.
Lazarus Brewing,414,Great new East Side Brewery. Absolutely loved the beer and the tacos were some of the best I ve ever had. Service wasn t excellent by any means  but it was fine. Met the owner briefly and he was very nice. Very cool space and good prices. Will definitely be back.
Lazarus Brewing,415,Being from New England I m spoiled with beer.  I can drink their DIPA all day.  They have an open concept which is so inviting and nice. Will def returns
Lazarus Brewing,416,Great new spot on E. 6th  Stopped in last weekend to check it out without realizing it was brand new. Good initial beer offerings with more to come. I had the First Noel which is a French Saison. Really unique taste for a saison but delicious nonetheless. The tacos looked and smelled delicious but I didn t get a chance to try them this time.  We sat at the bar and were pleasantly surprised that we were sitting next to the owner  Christian  who chatted with us and told us his story of how he became a brewer. I m happy to support such a nice guy who brings a unique perspective to the brewery scene here in Austin. I loved the decor as well  and will return for lunch and or coffee as they also offer a full coffee bar.
Lazarus Brewing,417,Went here on Friday night at the recommendation of some friends. It s a solid example of the East 6th Street makeover refurbishment stories gone right and I definitely am a fan. I tried two beers - Double Predestination  an IPA that wasn t overly hoppy  and Freudian Slip  also an IPA with a more citrus-like palette . Both were solid and ones I would try again. I also had a Carnitas taco  which had a solid flavor and went nicely with my beer selections. Great to see that the patio is dog friendly and there s a lot of space to sit inside or outside. My only slight complaint was there was live music  always a plus   but it was super loud and I think could have been taken down a couple of notches and still provided ample tunes for the patrons. All in all  a place I would return to as they seem to have lots of beer options and a continually changing lineup. Staff was friendly and food service was relatively quick even on a busy Friday night.
Lazarus Brewing,418,I live in Houston and I visited this place for the first time on April 9th 2018 when I was in Austin for a conference and was blown away  I had the Carnitas Tacos and they were fantastic. It is a really nice environment perfect for having a conversation and hanging out with friends. One thing I especially love is that you can get 5oz pours of the beers which allows you to try more of their brews without getting drunk  D I really liked the Double Predestination  it was a fantastic double IPA. I will definitely be back the next time I m in Austin 
Lazarus Brewing,419,Yum yum yum. We were initially hoping to get into another restaurant down the street  but after finding this place on Yelp  opted to come here instead  and we were not disappointed  So much food  I loved the queso fundido  veggie version . And the chips  whatever their consistency  were different but better than any tortilla chips I ve had before  Unfortunately  the fish tacos were sold out by the time we came  but the chicken ones were amazing. I also got a steak taco  but the chicken was much better. Just a preference.
Lazarus Brewing,420,My favorite place to grab a beer  Trent is awesome  He knows his stuff and makes us feel at home.
Lazarus Brewing,421,One star for atmosphere  airy industrial feel with outdoor options also. One star for delicious tacos  only  3   fresh organic free range chicken verde  add the crema and avocado slices  very good    I m not a beer drinker so I have nothing to offer there. Wine selection was limited and pricey for the quality.   8-9 a glass  the food service was quick but the bartenders seemed a bit pretentious and unfriendly.
Lazarus Brewing,422,I think Lazarus is a great concept. Not only is the beer good  but they have really great coffee and tacos  too. All the major food groups in Austin. It s a fun place to work during the day  and easy to switch from coffee to beer after 5  or if you re into it  earlier . It never feels packed  so you can have a nice little meetup with a friend or small group to catch up over beers and tacos and enjoy each other s company in this cute space. Hooray  Lazarus 
Lazarus Brewing,423,Creative and tasty proprietary brews offered in a chill and inviting atmosphere make this a great spot. The bad staff reviews aren t warranted aside from hipster skeletor  who  judging by his attitude and work ethic must be the owner s son.  The rest of the staff are friendly pros at this top notch watering hole on the east side.
Lazarus Brewing,424,We stopped here for beers only but had a great time  This place is huge and super cool with indoor seating the moves seamlessly into outdoor seating. I loved my Amandus Belgian golden ale  Plus Lazarus is at the intersection of all this cool happening in East Austin  Beer  coffee and tacos  what more could you want 
Lazarus Brewing,425,Came for the beer  stayed for the tacos. Large indoor  amp  outdoor areas. Pet friendly  so bring your dogs to hang outside. They seem to stick to the traditional beers. Their tacos are amazing  as to be expected in Austin.
Lazarus Brewing,426,I popped in quickly after walking by and seeing this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.   Thought it was just a new bar  but was intrigued enough to grab some beer when I saw they were a brewery.   The outside seating and patio area is inviting and full of people hanging out with their dogs and seemed like a great atmosphere.   Inside  the place looks cool with barrels on one side and brewtanks behind the bar with some bar seating as wells as tables.     I got a quick 3 beer sampler and tried the Honey IPA  their What the Hef  and their ESB.   All were really great beers and a bit unique for their respective styles  and I would get them all again.   The Honey IPA was flavorful  dryish without a huge residual malty sweet backbone  but with really fresh bright clean flavor.  The Hef was the most out of style to me  and didn t really have that standard Hef yeasty estheriness or traditional wheatiness  but tasted more like a crisp pilsner  and the mint used really peeked through to give it a clean refreshing flavor.  Not your typical hefeweizen for sure  but a great tasting and easily drinkable beer for summer.  I really loved the ESB as well  which seemed the most to style with a dry but biscuity ESB familiar malty grain flavor but with a citrusy hop finish that keeps any sweetness easily in check.   Really flavorful and balanced and just a fantastic beer.  The food menu was pretty sparse with some tacos  a couple small apps and some queso  but seems worth giving a shot.  In addition they offer some wine and have some legit looking coffee machines so I m hopeful they could make some good coffee here as well.  The bartenders seemed average in terms of service friendliness.  Not the most welcoming or hospitable  but not outwardly rude.   Overall  the beer and ambiance is great and I d look forward to coming back and trying a few more beers  coffee and food here and maybe even bringing the four legged furball with me.
Lazarus Brewing,427,Tacos and beer  Can t ask for anything more. You must get the Achilles Heel. Looking forward to trying their Tortas. Cool little spot in east Austin to chill on the weekdays or weeknights. Parking is a little difficult to find around here.
Lazarus Brewing,428,Great atmosphere with great brews. They have food  I didn t fry on this visit .  Quick friendly service. Reasonably priced. You can get a flight of five 5 ounce pours. Great outside area. Would recommend.
Lazarus Brewing,429,OOOOOOMMMMMMMGGGGG I have been to this brewery so many times and while I love my beer and coffee.....this rave is for the food    the queso fundido            it was like a Mexican pizza melted in your mouth    of course I always love the new brews out and the late night coffee.  glad to see this place up and coming......thinking about hosting my engagement party there.
Lazarus Brewing,430,Parking is more convenient than most places  which is a huge plus. The decor is great and it lends itself to a very laid back and enjoyable vibe. We had their tacos - the Al Pastor were yummy. I especially enjoyed the Jolted Phoenix from the beer list  the coffee taste was great 
Lazarus Brewing,431,Stop what you are doing right now.  Get the address.  Head there.  Why are you waiting   I don t really need to tell you that their breakfast tacos will make your tongue explode right   I also don t need to tell you that it is in my top five breweries in Austin right   They had me when I saw  in-house brewed beer  coffee  and tacos.  Austin has an array of breweries  places to get tacos  and coffee shops.  Make it a point to at least swing in and say hi.  I go in every time I am in town.  I got to learn sign language on our last visit.  They don t teach a class or anything  but I was lucky enough to interrupt a conversation and they taught me how to say taco in sign language.  You know you going to need that one night when you are a little tipsy on 6th.
Lazarus Brewing,432,I ve been coming here for quite some time and almost feel guilty that I haven t left a review. These folks are fantastic  If you re visiting Austin and looking for some breweries to checkout  do yourself a favor and visit these guys   The Shackleton is phenomenal  it s an English bitter. They also rotate quite a few.  I ll also mention that there at least 3 others nearby that you can also visit just in case you need the extra push.  And if you need yet another reason...legit tacos. I love the pollo verde and as well as the carne asada  and If you come on a Friday-Sunday day then you gotta do the fish tacos  Back on the beer--they have two nitros that are great  so if you enjoy that style you re in luck. Cheers 
Lazarus Brewing,433,Good beer  food  music and coffee. It s my Austin go to. The staff is friendly for such a hip  trendy town. It s in Austin s east side. All the cool kids come here 
Lazarus Brewing,434,I would recommend this place for all. The esthetics with cozy interior forms a welcoming environment. It s more than just beer with delicious homemade tacos and guacamole. Come hungry or not and you ll be satisfied 
Lazarus Brewing,435,Unparalleled. My girlfriend  amp  I came here during their opening weekend  amp  were shocked how good their tacos were. They have breakfast tacos  amp  dinner tacos too  carnitas FTW. We ve been back numerous times  amp  they consistently outdo themselves. The newly opened section has AC plenty of seating  amp  always keep cold water filled. The indoor is great with a super chill area that is great for a morning coffee  yes they serve coffee too. Tons of seating types to choose from  bar-height tables inside  amp  benches  tables  amp  high bar stools outside. Dogs are welcome  amp  there s always well-mannered pups around. Lighting is great at night too. However  it seems increasingly more common for parents to let their kids run free outside which is aggravating but not enough to effect my rating.
Lazarus Brewing,436,Great  spacious beer garden with misting fans to stay cool  Atmosphere was very cool  Beer was pretty good  coffee was great  Great spot to visit on a short trip to Austin 
Lazarus Brewing,437,Great brewer with an amazing stout  The atmosphere inside is great and comfortable. The beers have a variety of flavor  beyond the generic fadish trend of making overly hoppy beers.
Lazarus Brewing,438,I am updating this review after speaking with the general manager of Lazarus Brewing. The general manager  Marcus took the time to personally call me and discuss a previous complaint that I left. The fact that he took the time to discuss my opinions with me shows the quality and reputation of this establishment. Marcus made a conscious effort to ensure my complaint was resolved and Marcus was sincerely apologetic about any negative views that I previously had. Due to Marcus  kindness and dedication to ensuring my happiness I will definitely be giving this place a second chance. Overall it does seem like a cool place and I am happy that the time was taken to clear up any misunderstandings.
Lazarus Brewing,439,This place has some of the best beer in Austin and their atmosphere is very welcoming.  The food and coffee is pretty good too.   It s great for groups or a date.
Lazarus Brewing,440,I flew into Austin on a Saturday night  dropped my stuff off at my brother s house  and immediately went to get food at Lazarus. It s a really great place - the decor on the inside makes it feel like a brewery slash gastropub  and  of course  there s an outdoor area that allows pups and that s major points for the lack of dogscrimination. We shared 2 al pastor tortas among 3 people  which was plenty  the tortas are huge  It was so flavorful and after adding some house hot sauce  it packed a nice punch of heat. All in all  I d definitely go back and I want to try their coffee. That is all. On with your days  my friends.
Lazarus Brewing,441,Great beers  excellent service  outstanding tacos and chorizo dip.   Crowded on a Saturday afternoon but luckily a few spots at bar opened up while waiting for food.  Friendly crowd and worth a special trip.
Lazarus Brewing,442,Love this brewery. They just added he second half which is indoors but have huge garage doors that they ll open which  is going to be awesome for summer months. Fun place to have a bday party. Great tacos. Loved the al pastor
Lazarus Brewing,443,Awesome beer  tasty food  great ambiance.  Very dog friendly   Really like what they are doing in East Austin.  Hope Lazarus remains an anchor in this trending part of town 
Lazarus Brewing,444,I ve been here a few times and I really loce this place. Just a few weeks ago I was here when they were unveiling a new beer so I bought a bottle of it. The first bottle I bought I noticed the bartender pouring it in the glass looking at it and then he dumped it and went and got me a new one. Then he poured that one in and was still looking at it awkwardly. I didn t think nothing of it. Grabbed the bottle went outside and started drinking thats when the bartender came up to me and was like can I talk to you. I was like am I in trouble  I m like sure  he s like the bottle I sold you isn t up to our expectations so we re pulling it and he s like you re more than welcome to drink it but we will be taking it off your tab. I m like wow I wouldn t have known it didn t taste the way it did. I was like thank you very much I really appreciate it. That was a very cool gesture. I will definitely be back. If you do go here and they happen to have the tall dark and handsome you have to try it. One of my favorite beers in the planet. It s sold in limited releases
Lazarus Brewing,445, used to live right up the street  so extra points for being right up the street    but seriously  this place is great. the coffee is on-point. the tacos are legit delicious. yes  and the queso fundido  oh my the queso fundido  I dream of you. cheesy meaty savory deliciousness   the beer is great  the space is thoughtfully decorated  check out the books on the shelves - these were hand-selected by the owners as their favorites   and the people who work there are all so friendly and accommodating. seating is ample both inside and out.   Lazarus is a really wonderful addition to the neighborhood 
Lazarus Brewing,446,Great selection of beers. Went with the flight of beer so I could sample 5 different beers .  Bartender was super helpful with suggesting what beers are right for you. Breakfast tacos were delicious. Can t go wrong with a taco and a flight  
Lazarus Brewing,447,Cool  hip  and chic spot to get your East Austin fix. Lazarus has a real San Francisco feel to it. The bar  patrons  music  and beverage selection all come together nicely in a small setting. I recommend this place for early afternoon drinks and small plates  or for after 8pm drinks with friends.
Lazarus Brewing,448,     reader note  i rate based on ambiance and yumminess of food. i never consider service in my rating  no matter how bad or good         Short review  come here for the beer and the beer only. The food aint worth it. I really want to give this place a 4 star for its beer  but I had the tacos and chips and queso which were complete let downs  not to mention expensive. If you want tacos  just walk down to the Michoacana down the road. BUT the beer was delicious   Beeer  5 5 Food 1 5 Ambiance  4 5
Lazarus Brewing,449,Awesome brewery with a quaint feel. They have everything here from beer to coffee and food  and even wine . Mike gave us incredible recommendations. His friendly  amp  knowledgeable conversation added so much to our experience. The entire crew working were super friendly and all made us feel incredibly welcome. It was a true Austin welcome that we have heard of but not yet experienced. We had an awesome experience and the East of Eden is the best saison we ve ever had. Big Top and Achilles Heel were also two favorites. We will definitely be back  
Lazarus Brewing,450,Everything you need.  This is a special place. As the story goes  it all started with growing vegetables in the founders  backyard garden.   They tried their hands at growing hops  then tried their hands at brewing beer. They succeeded with both.   Now  on the corner of 6th and Chicon  they brew spectacular beer that you can only get on site. They make tacos that rival the best in the city  try the carnitas breakfast taco with crema and avocado . They also brew a mean cup of coffee  frequently have live music  and I haven t even covered the best part yet.  The people.   The folks who keep this place running every day are awesome. Welcoming  on the ball  care enough to get to know you  kinds of people.   As a new comer to the city  they ve made me feel welcome. As a beer lover  they ve kept me coming back with their craftsmanship  quality and variety. As a taco lover  they ve made me fat and happy  and somehow I keep asking myself if I can handle just one more.   I love this place.
Lazarus Brewing,451,I dug this place....stop 2 of a brewery tour after the Cap 10K.  This may have been my favorite bc they had FOOD.  Really awesome tacosthey made my tired  already drunk body happy--that s for certain.  Beer was super tasty and you can also take home glasses from this joint too if you want  for a price .
Lazarus Brewing,452,Everything here was absolutely delicious  I loved the homemade chips  queso  and phenomenal street tacos  Definitely will be going back   
Lazarus Brewing,453,This review is specific for the breakfast tacos   which I would have to say are some of the best I ve had and the tasty non acidic coffee  specifically Migas tacos. Ambiance is very nice and chill  will repeat for breakfast options.
Lazarus Brewing,454,Seriously love the food here.  I get excited when we re on the east side and someone wants tacos.  They are the perfect size for the price and delicious.  They have a wide selection of beers.  The couple that I ve tried were good.  They are also dog friendly   
Lazarus Brewing,455,Awesome place  good prices beer and friendly service. Let me taste test a couple... plus outdoor seating for my pup  Highly recommend.
Lazarus Brewing,456,The food    The dang tacos are straight up LEGIT y all. Also  amazing beer  Love this joint.
Lazarus Brewing,457,I like this place a lot  Nice decorations  Yumi food   beer and coffee and is pet friendly   
Lazarus Brewing,458,What a quaint little spot  Enjoyed coming here on our trip to Austin. Both my husband and I enjoyed some beer and I also enjoyed the root beer as well. Chips were light and fresh and guacamole was tasty. Loved the carne asada tacos. We sat outside because it was a nice day. The only thing lacking was some kind of music games out on the patio. There s a lot of construction going on next to the patio and across the street.
Lazarus Brewing,459,Great place  Wonderful customer service  amp  incredibly inviting atmosphere  Would highly recommend the coffee
Lazarus Brewing,460,Awesome atmosphere  Even better beers   This place is so great I wish we had one in Louisiana 
Lazarus Brewing,461,So good. Great service and friendly environment  Bathrooms so clean  and love the music
Lazarus Brewing,462,A modern speciality pub and coffee shop  with colorful decor and quality products. Although a tad pricy  the coffee  beer and food is well worth the splurge. Ask for recommendations or play it safe with a cappuccino  either way you ll notice an attention to detail and an expertise that s both comforting and impressive. My only criticism is the slightly tacky nature of the decor and ambience. It s nice  but looks more like a knock off Johnathan Adler store than an Austin brewery and coffee shop. Regardless  check it out and decide for yourself 
Lazarus Brewing,463,I went here over the holidays and had a great experience. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. The beer was great  I would recommend to anyone that loves a good craft brew.
Lazarus Brewing,464,Holy moly this place is awesome. Bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable about the beer  made excellent recommendations. Queso with chorizo is one of the best quesos I ve had in town. Will definitely be back.
Lazarus Brewing,465,I usually don t write reviews on places  but this place deserves it. Beers are amazing  prices are super reasonable and the atmosphere is awesome. The owner  Christian  is such a friendly guy with a great story  Do yourself a favor and stop in and get the Amandus or Ulysses brew    Not even from Texas  this place is just that good 
Lazarus Brewing,466,The staff was friendly and helpful and the beer was delicious. We didn t end up ordering tacos but the guacamole was super tastey. The setting was great  we sat out on the patio. Definitely recommend this spot 
Lazarus Brewing,467,Great place to come drink a beer with friends  listen to some live music  and grab some food  I love the vibes of the outdoor patio too 
Lazarus Brewing,468,Went there with a group of 7. Were able to find a table pretty easily at around 7 30 on a Friday night. We brought bananagrams and code names to play and listened to the live music  southern country  and drank some coffees and a glass of wine. For  8 the Nero d avola wasn t bad. Would be cool if they had one higher end wine on the list though. Overall though had a great time and would totally go back.
Lazarus Brewing,469,Walked from downtown to east Austin at night  pretty good walk but enjoyed the location of brewery with patio and indoor setting.  Sat at Bar  enjoyed sample of 6 beers which were pretty good.
Lazarus Brewing,470,Place was cool  cheap and delicious. Good beer selection and quality. The double IPA recommended by the bartender was awesome. I don t typically drink double IPA s because they are just too much. This one was subtle and overall very satisfying. The tacos were really good as well. I had the carne asada and al pastor on corn  different bartender recommendation  and they were tasty. Definitely will be back  often.
Lazarus Brewing,471,Great staff  We weren t familiar with the beers they had  we told the bartenders what beers we liked and they provided the Via Delarosa  an amazing belgian dubbel. We ended up having a couple more a piece. Great atmosphere. We had a very nice time and we will more than likely stop back in before we leave town.
Lazarus Brewing,472,Great beer and awesome staff. Environment is great also. Don t like that they charge a credit card fee. Kinda bs when I m buying a 6.50 beer that is a 8oz poor. So I can t in good conscience give them a good rating. If it was clearly labeled or told to me that they would charge this then I might give them a 4. But it wasn t so I have to give you a 3 star on this place.
Lazarus Brewing,473,Beer was good. Especially the coffee infused lager. Tried 4 different tacos  pollo verde was the best. Quest fundido was delicious also. Cool interior with plenty of seating inside and out. Our bartender seemed disinterested at best.
Lazarus Brewing,474,Well I went to your establishment 3 times this week. I visit 3-5 microbrewries every week in all 50 states. I like to support other breweries. Therefore I purchase 2 pints plus a  70.00 Growler. I took it to the patios when your bearded bartender followed me out to the patio and said you need to take the growler home you can t sit and serve yourself. Well I brought the lack of professionalism to his attention and he could care less. In the last three days myself and business partners have spent close to  1000.00. THE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM  is concerning. I will be contacting the  Brewers Association and make sure thy do not support Lazarus Brewing. This guy obviously had a power trip.   I will not come back to this establishment. In fact there are other local places such as High Sign and Hops and Grain that treat their customers with much more respect. DO NOT SUPPORT LAZARUS BREWING. They need to be shut down and allow people that give a shit to grow their business.  Give your money to a brewery that actually cares. This place is not what you think. They could care less.
Lazarus Brewing,475,Lazarus is awesome. Great coffee. Fun beers. And really good tacos. Atmosphere is super cool and with the variety  you could enjoy any hour of the day at Lazarus.
Lazarus Brewing,476,I want to like it.  It s just not very good.  Saving grace is the Amandus Belgian at 9  and named after st.  Am Andy s the patron saint of hospitality
Lazarus Brewing,477,Smug hipster place with bartenders that don t even acknowledge your presence. Unless of course you are a semi metrosexual looking millennial or a senior citizen. I must ve stood at the bar for 10 minutes trying to order for my girlfriend and I and watch them serve several other people first before I threw the menu down and we left. I tried to get their attention - they just pretended they didn t hear me or see me. I guess cowboy boots and baseball caps that are bent  the way they were supposed to be  and not flat as a pancake  are not welcome here.
Lazarus Brewing,478,Great spot on the East side of Austin that was just up the street from my apartment.  Beers are outstanding  love their barley wine beer   high alcohol beers - full of flavor   and the atmosphere is great  Habib is one of the bar tenders there  always smiling and very friendly and he takes care of his customers    Before Lazarus  the place used to be my go-to convenience store  the Cool Store  or something like that ....glad it was turned into a micro-brewery  E. Austin is where it s at 
Lazarus Brewing,479,Great atmosphere  beer and amazing tacos. Coming from Mexico I can truly say that they are authentic Mexican tacos.
Lazarus Brewing,480,A great place to hang out and have a few drinks. The food tastes good as well  went there 2 times so far with my fiance and had a great time.
Lazarus Brewing,481,I stopped here twice while in Austin for a Texas business trip. Great beer selection  tacos were good  and the environment for indoor outdoor seating is great. Each time I was there it was packed  and loud. I guess that is a good sign of popularity. It reminded me of Big Star in Chicago.
Lazarus Brewing,482,This has to be one of the best craft brewers in Austin.  The location is awesome  with a great vibe  and impressive stained glass.  The beer is excellent.  I ll try the tacos on my next visit for sure.  Service is excellent  too.  They are very cool to support Barks for Beers.
Lazarus Brewing,483,Excellent breakfast taco - Migas - and mocha. Friendly staff  great service. Nice atmosphere. Was here at 8 am and not busy. Nice addition to east Austin 
Lazarus Brewing,484,The el pastor taco. SOOOO GOOD. Just get it. With the special crema. Yesssssssss pleaaaaase.
Lazarus Brewing,485,What a great up and coming place near downtown.  Plenty of seating both inside and out.  Went a couple of times during a recent trip  breakfast tacos and coffee were great and nicely priced. Evening has a great atmosphere  wonderful ambiance  this new expansion looks like it s going to be really special.  Staff are amazingly friendly and engaging.  The Brewmaster obviously has a passion and will definitely find time to talk with you about everything on tap.  Definitely worth a visit if you re in the area.
Lazarus Brewing,486,I will have to admit that the food is pretty good   however one of the bartenders and food servers were pretty rude and unfriendly   Austin has lots places to choice from were staff members are much more friendly . I wish i can give this place a better rating but feel that they pick and choose who they want to be nice too . But again good and beer is pretty good 
Lazarus Brewing,487,Phenomenal place   Great beer  unreal service  specifically Brandy   and the space is super cool. We are visiting Austin and had to come back 2 days in a row because we loved it so much 
Lazarus Brewing,488,Hella good beer but the customer service SUCKS   We chose not to eat here because of it. Come for the beer  leave for the next cause of the service.  If I were you  I would come have a flight then head down to Zilker for better customer service and comparable beers.
Lazarus Brewing,489,Anyone not looking to do C  or be enamored in your computer phone tablet  look elsewhere. The beer  so-so. I appreciate the work the brewer has done and can t condemn them for their clientele  but the appeal is lost on me. Probably the sour taste I m left with. In any case  the pils was good and I wish you the best of luck in the future.
Lazarus Brewing,490,Difficult to find parking  a given for this area  but good beer selection and great bands
Lazarus Brewing,491,My wife and I were lucky enough to attend the Lick Ice Cream and Lazarus Brewing beer and ice cream pairing night here.  The beer was amazing  i NEED that mint hefe in my life but i think it was just for that night.  The head brewer was there explaining the processes and he was very knowledgeable.  Loved the atmosphere are well.  Will definitely return 
Lazarus Brewing,492,Came here with some friends  sadly during closing time and didn t get to spend as much time. The staff were all very nice and attentive  you can tell they were all very knowledgeable. Great beer selection of every kind. I enjoyed the fact that they didn t serve the typical bar food and really kept it simple. Tortas are bomb  tacos are legit 
Lazarus Brewing,493,Meeting up with a friend  we both wanted to go somewhere neither of us has been. Lazarus it was. First off  great parking  on location and 2 blocks away at 4th and Chicon  is a great start. While waiting for my friend I took a look into their chilled barreling room. Foeders  Hell yes  I love places that invest in these as part of their aging program. More breweries also need more  or any  water misting fans for their patios. This summer especially  myself and many like me will be seeking out those patios with misting fans. First beer I had was the 40 Days and 40 nights as it claimed it was the last beer they would want if on a deserted island. While this is not the last I would want if I were on that same island  it is a damn good IPA. I ll go so far as to say the best IPA in Austin IMHO. My friend ordered the Chips and Guac and was pretty good and priced sensibly.  Second beer  despite the others listed  was also to be a 40 days and 40 nights  that good. 4.5 Stars.
Lazarus Brewing,494,Loved all the beers we sampled here. We didn t eat but the food next to us also looked amazing. I say come here and definitely check out this place. You won t be disappointed.
Lazarus Brewing,495,Limited selection of good tasty beers around the  6 mark.  Standard  brewery interior with plenty of seating space and some outdoor space that faces the parking lot and 6th street. Breakfast tacos are available until 2PM for  2.50. They were quite large and very tasty. Watch out for the red sauce because that stuff is HOT. I was only going to get one because I wasn t that hungry  but the cashier said he eats 2-3  so I got 2. They were large enough that 2 was very satisfying. I hear the gas station portion on the other side of the patio is going to soon be a restaurant. I ll definitely be back to feel the place out  before and  after that 
Lazarus Brewing,496,Such great people  service and top notch quality on beer and all tacos wether you are a vegan or meatatarian. Awesome blossom 
Lazarus Brewing,497,Good beer  solid food  a cool atmosphere. I think it s a converted automobile repair shop  which makes it very open  accessible and unique. Parking can be tight but not too bad.
Lazarus Brewing,498,Excellent brews excellent service  awesome physical plant  great menu   What a great little place  the only disappointment is that you cannot purchase their brews to enjoy at home. This being said  I do understand their vision  and why you can only purchase this delicious beer on site. Nicely done.....
Lazarus Brewing,499,My favorite brewery in all of Austin  and I have indeed visited them all  and I home-brewed for 30  years . Bright  clean taste in all their brews. Consistent rich flavors  skillful use of hops  great flavor profiles. The excellent staff  wonderful tacos  and smell of fresh-brewed coffee just add to the ambiance. Sunday at 10 for a Sampler and breakfast tacos is a great great hangover cure.
Lazarus Brewing,500,Excellent beer and just an awesome place to hang out. Super friendly and knowledgeable bartenders.
FoodHeads,1,Foodheads has been on my list of places to try for a while now but I don t often find myself in the area for lunch. When we arrived  12 30 on a Saturday  there was a line out the door and plenty of people seated around the lawn area enjoying their food. The wait staff was bringing food out and calling patrons by name to deliver their lunch. Despite the long line  things seemed to be moving quickly and my boyfriend found a seat while I waited to order. It took about 20 minutes to get to the front of line  however it was just enough time to read over their pretty large menu and decide on our order  I felt that they offered a pretty good variety of options and different style sandwiches. While in line watching the previous orders come out I noticed that all of the sandwiches looked really yummy and had fairly large portions for a  deli-sandwich  especially for the price points - most sandwiches on the menu were between  8-13 each.   We settled on the Apple Pork Sandwich and the Old School Brisket Sandwich with a side Zapps chips. Our food came out at 1 15 right around 20 minutes after we ordered. Both of our sandwiches were large and very filling    The Apple Pork Sandwich was very fresh and light but still so filling  lots of complex flavors that were very well balanced. The apple slaw had some onion in it but was not over powering  The grilled tenderloin was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. I also was pleasantly surprised by the ciabatta which was very moist and airy - often times I find that ciabatta has a pretty hard crust shell around it which hurts my mouth personally. I only ended up finishing half of this sandwich and was satisfied.   The Old School Brisket Sandwich was really yummy as well. My boyfriend claimed this one but I stole a bite to report back  The brisket was very nicely done  extremely flavorful and tender. The smoked flavor was not overpowering and there was an impressive serving of meat on the sandwich    Overall the environment was busy  a but loud but very welcoming and inviting. It felt very homey and casual  perfect for a Saturday afternoon sandwich  Prices were extremely fair and despite being consistently busy there was plenty of seating and service was timely  We did not find a private lot for parking and theres not a ton of street parking space available so I would say thats the only downside here 
FoodHeads,2,Such a good  wholesome  healthy place    The prices are affordable and the food is quality  If you re looking for something light  filling  variety  check this place out    The people working here are always so kind and patient  The vibe is also adorable.   I got the half prosciutto and egg salad sandwich with brisket chili and both very tasty  The sandwich was delightful but it wasn t my favorite  I would try the squash or chicken amp eggplant sandwich next time 
FoodHeads,3,Second time coming here and this time I ordered the chicken eggplant sandwich. I wanted to order the combo with their brisket chili but they ran out at the time  Ordered a London fog latte with oatmilk and they said they were out of oatmilk as well  but found more later on. Loved the food and drink but would recommend taking the food to go as the indoor seating was full. Would recommend coming early to ensure they don t run out of anything  My boyfriend ordered the chicken Caesar sandwich and that was really good too. Definitely would come again 
FoodHeads,4,The menu is what brought me in here. An egg salad sandwich with prosciutto  You know I had to stop in here. This was my first time so I went with what brought me in  The egg salad prosciutto sando. It s on toasted nine-grain bread with alfalfa sprouts  tomato  amp  red onions. I love alfalfa sprouts but the do go a bit heavy handed on those  so if you re not a huge fan... say easy on those. I also got an iced latte and it was very yum. Great espresso pulls. I ll be back to try many of their other cool options
FoodHeads,5,Wow  Spectacular  Who would ve guessed such a wonderful cafe existed so close by  Reminds me of Fricano s  RIP  but with better vibes   Tomato coconut soup 5 5 - non spicy Thai curry packed with flavor - creamy - thick  Pulled pork 5 5 - juicy and tender pork - bread was so perfect... no other way to describe it  Apple Pork 5 5 - pork was tender - good balance of apples with sauce and veggies - bread was nicely made and tasted fresh  - very dynamic and involved in every bite  Plenty of seating and friendly staff.
FoodHeads,6,A really casual affair. Smaller  max 4 chairs   empty tables where you grab everything you need from the self-service station after ordering at the counter. A nice touch is the quantity of outdoor seating with available bug spray on the outdoor counter. Different entrance and exit doors that lead you out through the outdoor seating and help control the flow and spacing  particularly during this time.   I was there for breakfast and got three different tacos and a muffin to go. The pumpkin chocolate chip muffin was tasty  but closer to a homemade size than massive restaurant portions elsewhere. You get the feeling this is a family affair and they are not setting out to be fancy in decor  presentation  or service. Working on making you feel at home instead.  Of the tacos my favorite was the egg  bacon  and cheese. The migas and the egg  bacon  potato were a little dry and required salsa to spice them up  not enough flavor on their own   and the vegetables in the migas were more prominent  larger chunks  than I ve had elsewhere. But the egg  bacon  and cheese taco was delicious  and I would definitely go back to get that one again. All the tacos were above average size while being very reasonable prices. I also got a London fog and don t know I would do that again. They used a tea that had an interesting different flavor  my guess is it was meant to be rose  that made it a little too aromatic for my tastes. But  as with everything else  it was a very reasonable price and presented by caring staff.   Would come back here when in the neighborhood and looking for home cooking I don t have to do myself. I would not come here looking for a culinary extravaganza. Love it for what it is.
FoodHeads,7,Quality sandwiches are found here at Food Heads. First off  there s no parking so keep that in mind when you re planning your visit. Secondly  order the chicken and eggplant sandwich with ciabatta  instead of whole wheat   it gives it a nice crunch  The sandwich was super tasty and I d return again however I ordered to go and it did take awhile for them to make the order so plan for extra time. Additionally  I m a huge Italian sandwich girl so I was disappointed they didn t have anything with prosciutto or any hot peppers  I know we are in texas but this is a sandwich shop- no sandwich should be left behind    I gave this 4 5 due to the wait and the menu.
FoodHeads,8,Sandwiches were a 5 5  This was my first time going here and the food was very tasty and fresh. It also came with homemade pickles on the side  which complimented the sandwiches really well. I preferred the ciabatta bread on the apple pork sandwich over the other one. There was no line on a Friday around 1pm  but we had to park a bit away from the place  since the street parking nearby was full. The outdoor seating area is nice  but there were lots of flies inside and outside the place. Would definitely come back though to try some of their other unique sandwiches 
FoodHeads,9,After many years passing by this place  I found myself in the area early enough to beat the lunch rush and have a sandwich. This popular sandwich shop is located in the North University area. It s on a strip of business housed in craftsman style homes. There s plenty of seating out front and on the sides of this building as well as on the porch. There are several fans to cool you when it s summer. There is also seating inside.  There is a QR code on the door to view the entire menu which I had trouble scanning  thanks Apple  and when you order inside there is a wall of blackboards that also show the popular sandwich and salad options. Like all sandwich places ordering can be daunting as there are always people behind you that know what they want so if your undecided or new it s a challenge to get through all the options. As for the sandwich  I had the steak chimichurri torta. It was flavorful more like a salsa verde without the heat but that was fine with me. The sourdough bread was nice and toasted - a rarity in sandwich shops. The vegetables where nice and crisp. It also came with a side of butter pickles. I normally don t like butter pickles because the smell can be nauseating but these were fresh and were balanced between sweet and sour. As for parking  it s all street parking.
FoodHeads,10,I got a build your own sandwich and it was so delicious  Great customer service  very cute interior  very casual. Got food to go and really loved every bite.
FoodHeads,11,FoodHeads  how I ve missed you  I haven t been back in a few years and don t know what s taken me so long to return. They have brisket specials right now which are the way to go  I got the brisket bahn mi- so flavorful  The bbq brisket sandwich also looked great. I haven t ever had a bad meal at FoodHeads  The salads are massive and the converted house into the restaurant is a place you must visit.
FoodHeads,12,I love FoodHeads  This is one of my top favorite spots in Austin today. FoodHeads is the rare establishment that still feels like old Austin  unpretentious  homey  but with a sophisticated palette.   Everything here is good  but I especially enjoy the pork and apple sandwich - so good 
FoodHeads,13,A casual brunch place with coffee  sandwiches  breakfast tacos  soups  salads. The service is friendly and the seating is nice both indoors and much more outdoors.   The half sandwich half salad was great  since both portions were good. However what took a star away is the flavoring of the food. Although the chicken breast was juicy and the bread was nicely toasted  it was all quite bland. I had their tacos before too  and they were not bad but lacking in flavor too. The custom egg is interesting.   There s WiFi and some cooking and Christian books inside.   Overall  I d come back for another brunch and try another sandwich.
FoodHeads,14,To my starving stomach  this was temporarily satisfying. To my tastebuds  the food was distasteful and unsatisfying. I ordered the fish tacos for lunch. Not sure if I was expecting something more satisfying due to the price  but the tacos weren t too filling and seemed unseasoned. The place is small and hip. There s outdoor seating and the staff members were courteous and helpful. There s this neat table to grab your food and go for people who order their food to go. I thought that was a neat and cool concept. Parking was a little hassle. I think there s only street parking. Overall  I most likely wouldn t return.
FoodHeads,15,This place is truly a slice of old Austin cool.  I ve been in Austin since 98 and it reminds of   back in the day    There is a surprising variety of non meat sandwiches including melty veggie ones  egg salad and a hot tuna melt. I settled on the tuna melt and was glad I did. It was such a nice mix of arugula  and three kinds of melty cheeses.  I opted to not add dijon mustard and subbed in their own version of honey dill mustard and chipotle mayo and requested it on toasted sour dough. The vibe is super laid back and is a rambling old house with a porch outside for dining alfresco. The chocolate chip cookies and red velvet cupcakes looked homemade. Bonus  each sandwich comes with a side of home made sweet pickles.
FoodHeads,16,Very cute place with a lot of outdoor seating  if only the weather was nicer.. . I think they have like two vegetarian options  out of those two I ordered 1 2 of the squash sandwich and a small greek salad. Sandwich was flavorful and the salad was refreshing  They put sauces on the side  which I appreciate.
FoodHeads,17,Just wow. Today was the day I had the best sandwich I ve ever had in my life. The squash sandwich was everything I never knew I needed in a sandwich. Mozerella cheese was super fresh and the balsamic glaze you can drizzle is the cherry on top. Service was great  waitress was adorably sweet and you can tell they truly value customers. Today was my first time  but not close to the last time.
FoodHeads,18,Loved the breakfast tacos and muffins  First time stopping in and will be back. Seemed like they were prepping for a large lunch order to be picked up and thought that could be a good option for teacher lunches in the future.
FoodHeads,19,Foodheads has been my go-to sandwich place for years now. As a college student  I find it affordable  filling  and unique. It s a great place to meet  because there is ample indoor and outdoor seating. Everyone is super friendly and there s a rotating seasonal menu. I m personally a huge fan of the chicken and eggplant sandwich and get it every time. My friend got the banh mi brisket sandwich last time we went and said it was delicious. I always ask for extra pickles.   There is street parking  although it does filled up. I ve been able to find parking in front of the restaurant every time I ve gone  but be prepared to circle around the residential areas for parking.
FoodHeads,20,Are you kidding me   This place is the type of thing that is making Austin famous. Low-key  local  friendly and delicious. The food is what you wish you had at home. Sweet little house  great outdoor seating  with fans .
FoodHeads,21,Foodheads menu feels like taking a fun  or crazy  detour that always pays off.   Foodheads has been in Austin forever and I remember trying it out in high school. The fresh ingredients really showed me how you can cook something great by starting simply and preparing it carefully. It has been 20 years since my first time at Foodheads  in high school   and I ve taken way too many culinary classes since then and cherish cooking in my life. I like to think Foodheads was a little part of that growing up.
FoodHeads,22,I had warm pastrami. Very good and completely filling. There are many tables for seating with outdoor seating. The service is also very good. Only drawback is parking but available.
FoodHeads,23,Their breakfast tacos are AWESOME  A great neighborhood spot with yummy food and friendly staff.
FoodHeads,24,Dined at FoodHeads for lunch    This follows covid protocol with sanitizers everywhere  masks  and social distancing.  Dined with my boyfriend.   We had the Chimichurri steak sandwhich and the Smoked Brisket Banh Mi Sandwhich    They are absolutely flavorful and delicious    Def recommend and go back for more      Beautiful day to dine outside we well and plenty of outdoor seating.
FoodHeads,25,This is such a great find  They have an amazing front porch yard for outdoor seating. It s just cozy and quaint. But the food is really where it s at. So tasty. Amazing sandwiches and salads. Everything was delicious. It was the perfect lunch spot for mid-town Austin. Laid back  casual  and cute.
FoodHeads,26,Such a cute Austin classic  I love the vibes here especially on a nice sunny day with all the outdoor seating. They have great soups and sandwiches with some fun sandwich options. I ordered the chicken eggplant sandwich. The eggplant was a little mushy but I loved the combo of the chicken with the pesto and goat cheese. Overall  a great place to have a casual lunch in Austin.
FoodHeads,27,I like this place.  Quite and cozy space.  Delicious food.   I ordered the eggplant and chicken sandwich.  It was a great selection.   Coffee was very good too.  Highly recommended.
FoodHeads,28,Right off the bat  this place makes you feel right at home. It s literally located in what seems to be a single family house. There s a good amount of outdoor and indoor seating so it s ideal for a sunny lunch date   We ordered the Banh Mi and the Chimi Steak Torta. I originally came here on a mission to try the Banh Mi sandwich  but I actually ended up enjoying the Chimi Steak much more  The combination of the dressing  the freshness of the greens  and the crunchiness of the bread pulled the meal together. The Banh Mi was good too  but the brisket was a little dry for my liking.   Overall  the staff was really kind. The cashier mentioned that a lot of people who come by are regulars. With how affordable this place is and how many options are on their menu  I can definitely see why  I m for sure going to be back to try more things on the menu.
FoodHeads,29,Super nice service  cool place. Love that the menu keeps it interesting for a sandwich shop. I had no complaints at all. Plenty of outdoor seating  Just be aware flies will instantly find you when you get your food
FoodHeads,30,okay YUMMMMM  This place absolutely wowed us  We have driven by a few times but super glad we were finally able to grab some. I got the chimichurri steak sandwich and added a fried egg and jalapenos. It was a bit messy but worth every bite 
FoodHeads,31,Hostess was rude.   A few visa letters options for us to sit down but we were refused and asked to wait outside.  The food may be great but the Hostess ruined our experience.
FoodHeads,32,Outstanding sandwiches.  Multi grain bread is tasty  crispy and holds together with their meal sized fillings.  The squash and the the lami are my favorites.
FoodHeads,33,The BEST sandwiches in Austin. They are so carefully designed with an incredible range of unique  delicious combinations. There is something for everyone here. The house itself is adorable and there s tons of outdoor seating to take advantage of on a beautiful afternoon.   You can always find the owners  Chip and Candi  working hard to make their customers  experience great every time.   I recommend the salmon salad  salmon bagel  tilapia torta  breakfast tacos  and anything from the smoker. And the Lami  And the coconut cupcakes  This is a spot where I could close my eyes  point to something random on the menu  and I would be happy wherever I landed.
FoodHeads,34,In what used to be a house  now repurposed as a restaurant  Foodheads aims to provide you with an experience that makes you feel right at home. Not just in the laid back environment  but in the food too. They offer delicious homestyle sandwiches that are some of the best in town. I got the   - Brisket Brioche Banh Mi  Brisket  slaw  red onion  cilantro  serranos  and sriracha mayo. Great array of smokey  citrusy  creamy  spicy  and rich flavors. They recently acquired a new smoker  so the brisket is smoked in-house  - Chicken  amp  Eggplant  Grilled chicken  roasted eggplant  goat cheese  basil pesto  tomato  spinach  and balsamic reduction. This one is a contrast to the brisket sandwich as it s much lighter and wholesome. - Gumbo Soup  This was my first time ever having gumbo  This one left a bit more to be desired as I felt the flavor could have been elevated more. Maybe more salt  Still good nonetheless. - Tomato Coconut Soup  Loved this one. Think tomato basil  but with a coconut milk aftertaste. They put a bit of curry in there - unique   My overall thoughts is that the portion sizes are huge for the affordable price tags you pay. I love the variety in sandwich choices too. There s a couple more I want to try  so I will for sure be back   Great food  great environment  great customer service. Highly satisfied 
FoodHeads,35,I m so upset with myself for having lived in this area for so long without having visited this Austin staple  especially for how delicious it is. I ve heard nothing but good things from friends and this did NOT disappoint  I had the pork sandwich with apple salsa and that made for the perfect lunch. It s a cute little spot with almost a coffee shop feel to it. Need to make plans to go again soon.
FoodHeads,36,I had the sandwich pictured with the dog  And it was amazing..  coffee was really good as well  I d highly recommend.
FoodHeads,37,Great neighborhood spot. Long-ish wait on the weekends. Everything on their menu is made with quality  fresh ingredients. Try their smokehouse specials  We can t stop thinking about the brisket bahn mi. Other favorites are the pastrami  chimichurri steak  and chicken salad.
FoodHeads,38,Ordered catered breakfast for a group and it was delicious  perfectly packaged  no issues  and everyone loved it  Easiest part of a long weekend of planned events.
FoodHeads,39,I had the chicken and eggplant sandwich and loved it. I m so pleased when a top starred place on Yelp actually delivers. If you want a good sandwich  you can t go wrong with this spot.
FoodHeads,40,This place is now my favorite sandwich shop in Austin. I m not a huge fan of sandwiches  so I wasn t expecting much when my friend suggested we go here for lunch. However  my sandwich met and exceeded my expectations--it was soo delicious  I got the chicken and eggplant because I like chicken and absolutely loove eggplant and I saw that it also included a pesto basil spread  yum  . The bread was nice and crunchy and healthy looking but still yummy  and all the ingredients were cooked well and super flavorful. If you re a fan of sandwiches  or even if you re not   I would highly recommend giving this place a try    As for the environment  it s a pretty small shop  I think they converted a house  with limited seating inside and a few tables on the porch area. It s nice and homey  and sitting on the porch was fun since the weather was really nice today 
FoodHeads,41,Sometimes getting excited about a sandwich shop is the simplicity we need and Foodheads is the deserving recipient of such accolades  Many of the menu offerings are sandwiches you ve seen before  but with a twist. Finally decided on the grilled chicken eggplant sandwich and was beyond pleased. Definitely will return to try the other contenders on my short list  egg salad and prosciutto  roast beef and brie  and a cup of soup. The staff were all super friendly knowledgeable and the atmosphere vibe is great both indoors and out. Highly recommend 
FoodHeads,42,Fantastic restaurant true to classic Austin style. Superb sandwiches and an owner with a heart of gold. While waiting for my order somebody came in and tried to take a to-go order. When she was asked the name and got it wrong the jig was up. Instead of kicking her out or calling the police the owner asked her not to take other peoples food  asked if she was hungry and then offered to make her something for herself. It was awesome to see an owner offer a leg up to someone down on their luck in our community. The love and care transfers to the food 100 . Highly recommend 
FoodHeads,43,LOVE this place  It s so cute  plenty of outdoor seating. There are so many good options on the menu  it was hard to choose  My niece selected the pulled pork sandwich and wow was it amazing  She devoured it  I ordered the Cobb salad with chicken and it was excellent  Food came out quickly and service was friendly. We loved the vibe of this cafe. Parking is on the street  but we had no problem finding a spot.   We highly recommend this breakfast  brunch  lunch spot...
FoodHeads,44,I just had FoodHeads for the first time and wow    Best sandwich ever    I just happened to be nearby and saw it had good reviews and popped in real quick  and it was so delicious  I ordered the Steak Sandwich with chimichurri sauce and it was to die for    The steak was very tender and easy to eat  and the sandwich was stacked with meat and other topping that all went together so good  The icing on the cake was the pickles the sandwiches came with  they were really sweet and almost tasted like just sweet cucumbers instead of the usually tart pickles. The sweetness with the steak was so good together   My boyfriend ordered the Apple Pork Sandwich which was also delicious  The Apple pico is super unique and was perfect with the pork  reminded me of homemade pork chop dinner on a sandwich.  FoodHeads was super busy when I went it which only made me especially impressed with how quick the service was  It s a great casual coffee shop vibe with great service  amp  even better food 
FoodHeads,45,Good food  very crowded but loved the atmosphere. The food was fresh and authentic  and everything on the menu looked unique for a sandwich  like you might have a hard time finding it elsewhere. Everything was great   
FoodHeads,46,Tuna Melts are one of my favorite  go-to  dishes. Because I am currently pregnant  I can still eat tuna  just not frequently.  Yes Karen  it s ok to eat tuna in small amounts when pregnant. Calm down.  So I was on the search for an amazing tuna melt that was worthy of my small allotted amount. The following are two true statements I spoke to my husband after having the Tuna Melt. 1.  This is one of the best tuna melts I ve had in my life.  2.  When I go out to eat in Austin  this is the type of meal I expect every time.    I remembered to take a photo only after I devoured more than half of it.   The arugula was amazingly fresh  the bread was crispy  the price was great. The overall restaurant had a small bistro feel and I definitely plan on coming back 
FoodHeads,47,I depend on reviews... so do you... so we should write them   I went to FoodHeads for the first time this week  believe it or not. Cuz the reviews were great  and only because they were great  did I take a relatively long ride from my home near the Domain to get to W. 34th St. No much traffic on a Saturday afternoon and parking in front is available. So  what did I find  OMG  Scrumptious   I went with the favorite picks  but still... The chicken and eggplant sandwich was divine. The tomato coconut soup was perfect. There you go  5 out of 5 easily on the food and more. And the place is truly  Ausitn-y .  I plan to treat my staff to lunch from here this week    Loved it  ENJOY 
FoodHeads,48,Food Heads is your ravishingly beautiful hippie chick girl friend.  She is magically charismatic.  She is mega-hot.  You really want to do some weed with her.  You really really want to get her into your sleeping bag.  Can she cook   Not so much.  But you don t really care.         Food Heads is a Moosewood style sandwich shop on 34th near Guadelupe.  It is totally carnivorous but otherwise the Moosewood aesthetic holds.  Blackboard menus in Moosewood script.  Cooks and servers in maxiskirts.   Sandwiches are exotic with lotsa different ingredients.  There are lots of homemade soups with loosely chopped ingredients to give you that all-natural earthy feel.  The crowd is keep Austin-Weird-Cool.  Average patron  28ish.  The average patron voted for Bernie or Elizabeth Warren.         Everything has great ingredients and sounds on the blackboard like it is going to be wonderful.  Execution is hippie-dippie-on-again-off-again.  I had a steak salad.   That is the kind of dish that upscale American places do very well.  Here it was ho hum.  The meat quality was not great.   But any steak salad is like having your feet rubbed ...  So I was not unhappy to have a ho hum steak salad.  My Tomato Coconut bisque was full of chunks the way all natural soup is supposed to be.  It had a mix of strong good tastes that came from the core ingredients - sometimes coconut milk  sometimes tomato  sometimes whatever the chunks and leaves in the soup were.  The flavors were not exquisitely wonderful.   Things seemed tossed into the pot kind of randomly.   But the different spoonfuls of soup varied and had something to say.  The soup held my interest but not my love.  Pickles here are outstanding. They do a very short term pickling in a honeyed or sugared brine  giving you a very crispy crunchy sweet but spicy cucumber.  I make a comparable pickle myself but I loved their version.   I inhaled my pickles happily.  The woman I love was not thrilled with either her soup or her sandwich.   Some of the sandwich problems probably came from the ride home.  The baguette might have been better served fresh on Food Head s own premises.         There may easily be better things on the menu than what we had.  The food combos are sort of hit or miss   But hit or miss implies that sometimes you hit.  Food Heads at lunchtime is very very crowded.  So I will bet you sometimes they hit.         Note that Food Heads being super-crowded has some implications in this era of coronavirus.  Ordering here is slow.  I mean slow like Pacha slow.   Getting your coffee at Pacha takes more time than getting a home mortgage.   The crowds mean there are a lot of people in the room with you waiting to order.  They are all young  progressive  intelligent  charismatic people.  This will be the wonderful generation we all lose to COVID-19.  They will all get the disease waiting to order at Food Heads.  Food Heads house may be super-cool.  The staff may be charismatic and look like Stevie Nicks.  The room may give off excellent vibes and happy auras.  But I still want to live  thank you very much.  So I say you eat your stuff at home.         Samuel C s Advice   Order from Food Heads knowing you are entering the lottery on food quality.  Order on line and pay in advance.  Arrange to have them bring the bag out to your car.  Eat something that will survive the trip home.   Not the type of sandwich that will get too wet over time turning the bread underneath soggy.   You might do very well.         Or you can bring your mask  Come early enough to get the first outside seat in a corner  And do the Moosewood Ithaca Experience.  Pretend the Grateful Dead are playing nearby.  If you get unlucky and catch anything    You can still get the chance to meet Jerry Garcia in heaven.
FoodHeads,49,Try the Squash and Fresh Mozzarella sandwich - you won t be disappointed. This is my all-time favorite casual meal in Austin.
FoodHeads,50,Delicious sandwich shop. Kind workers. Fun menu with lots of variety and options for all. Cute little shop with a good amount of outdoor seating. Would go back any day 
FoodHeads,51,I. LOVE. FoodHeads    It s been a few weeks since I last had it and I am massively craving it again  so until I can get there I might as well give this place the five stars it so deserves     First of all--love the location. Cutest little former house. Great outdoor seating. But obviously  the pull here is the food   The chicken and eggplant sandwich is possibly my favorite sandwich in Austin. The flavors  textures  everything are so unique and yet so comforting  and go so well together. My boyfriend always gets  and loves  the chicken special sandwich  he says the tarragon mayo is what makes it but somehow  when he tries to make his own and just add it to a homemade sandwich  it s not the same. Only FoodHeads gets it right    The squash and portabella sandwiches are amazing vegetarian options. I tried these the first few times I came here because I eat vegetarian 95  of the time  but once I tried a bite of the chicken and eggplant I was hooked. Congrats  FoodHeads  on your sandwich being one of the 5  of non-veg things I eat     Oh lastly  The pickles    This is coming from a lifelong pickle hater  I more than hate them  I will run away from anyone who puts them near me  but I made myself just  try  the homemade pickles that come with sandwiches from FoodHeads and surprise surprise  I loved them. They are not your regular dill-y  pickl-y pickle. They are sweet and tangy and not as broken down as pickles from a jar. Big fan of these and ONLY these pickles  which is quite a feat.   All that to say  thank you  FoodHeads. Please don t ever take the chicken and eggplant off your menu or change your pickle recipe.     
FoodHeads,52,Had the chicken caesar sandwich and it was incredible  Hope to come back and try some of their other stuff
FoodHeads,53,All during Covid this restaurant was bustling.  They did an amazing job of people doing pick-up and curbside pick up.  It has to be an excellent place as it is always super busy.  I finally made a visit.  I got a half a sandwich with watermelon gazpacho.  The soup was delicious - just perfect.   The sandwich was also very good.  I do not like my condiments to be overpowering so I would say order light on the mayo mustard etc.  Also  as stated previously  this place is busy - so it is not fast food.  There is plenty of outdoor seating and there is indoor seating as well.
FoodHeads,54,Great spot for quick business lunch. Counter service only but would love to see them expand this 
FoodHeads,55,DONT ORDER INLINE.  Order at the counter  it s much faster.  Great food.  Online orders consistently take 3x longer and are never ready when they say.  But still great food.
FoodHeads,56,Got the roast beef and Brie sandwich the beef tasted like cardboard and I couldn t find any Brie. Coconut cupcake was dry icing was good. Austin will never let you down shit food and service and always over priced. I can count on one hand how many good restaurants with good service there are in Austin.
FoodHeads,57,the food was great  i got a sandwich that was BYO. however  i was pretty disappointed when I ordered online way far in advance to make sure it was ready when i got there  9 30am  i had my pick up time set for 11am. my order was 20 minutes late  i lost nearly a third of my lunch break on waiting. i felt ignored as well when i was waiting to be helped.. wish my first experience was different.
FoodHeads,58,The food  as ever  is delicious.  But I wish the owner would fire his rude and thoughtless staff and start over with people who actually care about other human beings.  I placed an online order a day earlier for an 8 15 pickup.  I was there at 8 14 on the dot  at which point the front staff proceeded to... glance at me occasionally while chatting with one another.    Eventually  at 8 25  one of them came forward with my sandwich and a promise that my latte was forthcoming.  Incredulously  I asked why my drink was not even ready now after 10 minutes delay  let alone the original pickup time.   Someone turned off the cappuccino machine last night  and now it s still warming up.   This response boggled my mind on three different levels  because A  why is someone this stupid on staff  B  why didn t they turn it on earlier in the morning  when they arrived instead of waiting for me to show up first and C  WHY didn t someone approach and explain the situation at 8 15   It would have gone a long way to helping.  And apologizing for the inconvenience wouldn t have hurt either.       It took another five minutes to get my drink  so a grand total of 15 minutes waiting for an order placed a day earlier.  Still no apology.  Just  Here you go  bye.   Lord above  waitstaff  I realize that we tip ahead of time when ordering online and you literally have no incentive to be nice  but you could at least pretend to care.
FoodHeads,59,This spot has an amazing atmosphere along with excellent food  Definitely somewhere you can pop in for coffee with a nice patio. Their lunch sandwiches are unique and huge  The pastrami melt special melted in your mouth  and the toppings went well with it. You can get tuna Nicoise on a sandwich or as a traditional salad  which is very unique.
FoodHeads,60,Wow  this place is a gem  Suddenly became one of my go-to places for a damn good lunch salad  steak and arugula . Their veggie sandwich is also killer.  Side note  I almost threw away the pickles  but as I opened the container to toss them in the compost  I got a whiff and they smelled amazing and the are  Not usually a pickle fan  but they re slightly sweet  more of an asian pickling.
FoodHeads,61,I m completely baffled by the quality of food here. Ordered the pastrami sandwich and was so excited to try it as New Yorker used to Kat s deli and other quality locations. I couldn t even swallow a single bite. Where do I start... the mustard sauce was horrific and way too overwhelming. The pastrami was disgusting too thick and dry. The pickled onions were a night mare. I had no choice but to go back and ask for a plain salad. Didn t even want the change refund. Just something decent to eat. My salad was even worse. How can you screw up a salad  I was served a salad with 2 cherry tomatoes. Moldy leafs that were uneatable. How is that near acceptable to serve  Can t be. I m absolutely horrified. Can t forget the nasty taste of the single bite I took from the sandwich. If you re from NYC. Don t even bother.
FoodHeads,62,Gypsy Grove is seductive. Meaty  fatty  moist  with plenty of freshness and zest from the pickle stuff. The pork is actually juicy.  The ciabatta was sturdy yet spongy soft.   The lami was good  but nothing special. The bacon was crispy  the salami was potent  but the execution seemed just average. The bread is of course fresh and a delight to eat. I felt this one could have had some creaminess  fat  or sauciness added more to the profile.
FoodHeads,63,More like 3.5 stars  Would get again  - apple pork sandwich - great flavors and comes on the most beautiful ciabatta I ve ever eaten - tomato coconut soup - on the chunky side  tastes even more amazing dipped by bread  Would not get again  - lami sandwich - just some salty meats  I prefer more combinations of flavors  We came in on a Saturday around 1 30pm and it was packed  Line to the door  and very loud and chaotic. We spent maybe 15-20 minutes waiting in line to get to the register  there s only 1   but after we ordered it only took about 10 minutes to get our food. It was difficult to get a seat inside  lots of people were saving seats before they even ordered   but they do have a lot of outdoor seating  and some of it is heated.  Next time  I think I ll try calling ahead to order to-go. It did get quite empty around 2 30pm though.
FoodHeads,64,Amazing sandwiches  We tried the chicken eggplant sandwich and it was delicious  The chai tea is also very good. They re doing takeout during Covid which is very convenient. We will be back 
FoodHeads,65,Amazing food  amp  service  Bailey made me a special chia latte without caffeine using spices and almond milk. They are so kind and the food if delicious  Highly recommend going for brunch  Great vibes
FoodHeads,66,Great food  great manager. Staff is a little bit upsetting as they don t prioritize the customers right in front of them  but that s to be expected with the age group. Will be back again very soon   
FoodHeads,67,Parking here was a bit difficult  the restaurant is basically a small house  typical Austin  and I had to drive down the road to park underneath a building. Questionably legal.   I ordered the roast beef and brie sandwich  came out in about 7 minutes  and it was delicious  At first glance I was disappointed by the size  but as I sit here typing this I ll say that it s filling and the quality of the ingredients justify the price.    It comes with two small containers with...I think they re pickles  At first  I ignored them because I usually hate pickles  but on a whim I tried one and I was so mad that I didn t try them sooner   They changed my view of pickles forever. Adding the pickles to the remaining half of my sandwich elevated the flavor to a whole new level.   All in all this place is great   I ll definitely come back to try something else. As long as it comes with those pickles.
FoodHeads,68,One of the freshest  most delicious salads I ve ever had. Adore the atmosphere. Very Austin  yet still mellow and humble.
FoodHeads,69,Best Sandwiches that I ve had in a while   Came in around 12 30 with a friend on a snowy day in Austin  like what  . The parking lot is around the corner  just a little quaint area that allows a handful amount of parking spaces.  There s one big table  fits about 7 people   and the rest of the tables inside fits about 2-4 people each  so when it s busy and when it s cold outside  you might have to wait.   The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. I got 1 2 a Chicken Eggplant sandwich  WOW  and the Tomato Coconut Soup  also WOW . It s different  but a good different. It s a different type of sandwich place and I love it. I followed someone else s review that the  pickles  that come with the sandwiches are not your typical pickles  I hate pickles  but these are more like a marinated cucumber that I wouldn t call pickled  so I definitely love it. Good place for a one-on-one 
FoodHeads,70,First of all  this is a very cute restaurant. It s pretty small but there s plenty of seating. I do not recommend sitting outside if it s hot and humid  we had flies and bees trying to sit on our food which was a little unpleasant but not really the restaurant s fault.  I got the chicken and eggplant specialty sandwich and really loved it. It was such an interesting and unusual menu item that I had to try it and I have to say  it did not disappoint. The goat cheese and basil pesto worked really well together. I also advise you to try out one of the many condiments they have to offer. I loved the FoodHeads hot pepper relish. I definitely recommend eating here 
FoodHeads,71,FoodHeads has been a go to neighborhood lunch stop for the past decade. Ever sandwich I have ever ordered has been consistently great. During the pandemic the FoodHeads team has gone the extra mile to improve their to go packaging and for those eating onsite their cleaning practices look top notch. While I was waiting to take my order to go a member of the team was constantly cleaning tables  chairs  doors  etc.
FoodHeads,72,Really like this cozy place where you are your dearest friends can meetup for lunch or evening. The food was amazingly fresh and delicious. Really enjoyed the fish tacos and the Cobb salad was fresh  crisp and plentiful. We got there close to closing and the chef came out and offered everyone free pastries. That was very nice of them. Also received  5 discount on my next visit. Will definitely be back to experience other menu items and wonderful service.
FoodHeads,73,I LOVE this restaurant.  First off  sandwiches are my favorite food and Food Head sandwiches are delicious.   My personal favorite is the chicken special sandwich. Rich  friendly taste with good quality chicken and avocado.   I ve also tried and loved their Apple pork sandwich  their regular pulled pork sandwich  and their salmon sandwich.  Their salads are also huge portions and I ve heard much praise for them from my friends.  It s very cute with seating indoors and out. Only vice would be that their changed their hours to close at 4pm everyday  which definitely makes it harder to come here. They are also closed on Sunday s.  Parking is street parking but I don t usually have a problem finding a spot down the street. Or you can take the bus which will drop you off right at 34th street.  They pair their sandwiches with a pickled cucumber side  which just complements the taste perfectly.  Love love this place  
FoodHeads,74,Came for lunch and will definitely be returning. Think old Austin hipster and you ve got this place half figured out. It s in a renovated Austin style home with a good amount of outdoor seating in the front yard and on the porch  love that there was a porch .   Parking might be hard here as it s on a somewhat busy street  depending on what time you go  and has a small parking area in the back.   Food wise  my friend got the apple pork sandwich and I got the fish torta  not what everyone on yelp recommended  and we liked it quite a bit. We were a fan of the sweet tea  sweetened with honey  as it was light  but retained the southern sweet tea taste. Soups are pretty good. We went with the chicken noodle and it was good and hearty  even for a cup size . Their cookies and cupcakes looked amazing and we ll have to try it next time.   People complained about the serving size  but I thought it was a good enough amount to where I didn t feel gross after finishing my food.  Would definitely recommend for a quick lunch.
FoodHeads,75,The hot sandwiches at FoodHeads are consistently good. Cute little shop to grab a good sandwich.
FoodHeads,76,What a cute old original house near UT. parking is ok but when you walk in you really feel the nostalgia of that time. wooden floors  mis matching furniture  and then you sit down and try to figure where the living room and dining room used to be. The menu is a decent size and they sometimes have pastries out for you to taste before you buy. I got a breakfast taco but when I opened it  it was enough for 2. so really feel like I got my moneys worth. the coffee was nice and hot and enjoyable just to be there. I like this place  cool and hip like Austin.
FoodHeads,77,I ve lived in Austin for 4 years now but somehow no one ever told me to come here. This place is fantastic  Seems as if you can t go wrong with any of the sandwiches on the menu. The menu is nicely organized by the meat featured in the sandwich  and there is one vegan mushroom sandwich option and also salads . The atmosphere is quaint and charming  I ll definitely be coming back  It s a little pricey  about  10 for just the full sandwich and a cup of pickles   but well worth it.
FoodHeads,78,At a glance this place looks great  service was the worst part of this  definitely nothing to write home about. The food  which lukewarm when we did finally receive it  took 30 minutes to be brought out  not a place to have a quick lunch. Maybe if you have a 2 hour lunch break I suppose. Very disappointed. Just another  trendy  restaurant  but nothing great. Again  it should not take that long to prepare sandwiches and a cup of soup 
FoodHeads,79,Can t believe it took me so long to find them. Delicious in every way every time I go here. London fog tea latte is so delicious. I m not even a tea drinker. Ciabatta bread is hands down the best I ve ever had. Haven t had a sandwich I didn t enjoy yet. Tomato coconut soup was as good as it sounds too.
FoodHeads,80,This place is absolutely amazing  we tried the tuna melt and portobello sandwich  we caught them 5 minutes before they closed and the staff was super helpful and delightful. A true hidden gem in Austin. 10 10.
FoodHeads,81,I loved the atmosphere of this place  the sandwiches were great and they had homemade pickles that were so good  I ll be back again for sure 
FoodHeads,82,Fish Tacos were ok they were very salty. There were some parts that were favorable The lami and the bread was so hard it cut up his mouth and was over salted and extremely greasy. keep in mind the salami is salty in general no need to add extra salt. Very nice environment very friendly.
FoodHeads,83,I can t say enough how delicious this cute restaurant is  I own a business next door and let me tell you it s dangerous  I m a creature of habit and I LOVE the beef and Brie sandwich so I get it every time but the breakfast ham sandwich is the perfect sweet and salty goodness    All the employees are super sweet  The patio is adorable I m a lucky lady to have this next door   
FoodHeads,84,  no masks   wrong order  Food looks fantastic. I ordered a build your own sandwich for pick up and they got my order very wrong  Missing 3 ingredients and they added Hummus in my sandwich. Yuck    I highlyyyyyyy dislike hummus. So  I didn t actually get to eat my sandwich just picked at the top of the bread and and had a little of the cold slaw. I wish I would have checked before I left but I felt soooooooooo uncomfortable with all the people walking around without masks I just wanted to get out of there.  People worker were wearing masks but the customers walking around and in line were not wearing any masked and did not keep any distance. Would love to give this place another try but since I m immune deficient I m not sure when it will be safe to do that.   Will update the post when appropriate 
FoodHeads,85,My quest for a good lunch spot has led me to Foodheads. It s a cute  old house that s been fashioned into a restaurant. The outside had nice seating  and some covered area to avoid the sun  whenever it begins to shine again.  I walked in and loved the simple inside. Old floors  weathered looking table tops  and bright menu board. There are many appealing sandwich choices. I went with the pulled pork and it s delightful. I could use a little more hot sauce  but the meat is juicy and tender and sits on a great ciabatta roll.  I ll be back  
FoodHeads,86,I like FoodHeads. It s a nice  cute little shop. The food is very quality and the service is always great. It does take awhile  like a loooong while  sometimes to get your food if it s busy  but it s a small  good quality food place so it s kinda expected.
FoodHeads,87,Cute little eating place with a great vibe. It was a perfect day so we enjoyed eating outside on the front porch. I had the Squash with a side Greek salad. The salad was so good and so fresh. The squash sandwich was even better. Everything tasted so fresh and was extremely tasty. Felt like I was at grandmas house on the farm. I was definitely not disappointed.
FoodHeads,88,Excellent sandwich and soup options   Lovely outdoor seating. Don t miss this great place 
FoodHeads,89,This is a local favorite  and I m glad to have found this gem that is so close to my work. I usually come for lunch during the week  and always find seating-either inside or outside. They have fans and umbrellas that keep the outside areas cool  and big tables for sharing inside. I ve ordered a number of their sandwiches from the Tuna Melt  Chk and Eggplant  Pastrami  and Vegetarian Sandwiches. All are freshly made and reasonably priced. I usually do the Half Sandwich  Half Salad or Soup combos  and their soups and salads are really good. Give this place a try if your in the area 
FoodHeads,90,Best sandwich in Austin - Hands down  Really cool spot  perfect place to meet a friend  go with family from out of town  or to hang out on your own
FoodHeads,91,It is so fun to find restaurants that will accommodate food allergies and not over-salt their food    I ate lunch at FH last week and not only was it delicious but I also felt good after and the next day. I can t tell you exactly what I ordered because I had to make several requests due to my allergies. The person who took my order was very knowledgeable about what the kitchen could do and the owner even double-checked with me to confirm.   Thanks FH 
FoodHeads,92,WoW  I was wanting to come to this restaurant for years. I finally did and it was horrible. The roast beef and brie sandwich was 3 4 spinach with a very small amount of roast beef like a few pieces. The brie on the sandwich was super tangy and sour tasting.  I ve had my share of brie  but this was not good. The potato salad s potatoes were half cooked and semi hard  so that ruined the potato salad. The fish tacos we ended up throwing away since the fish inside had a strong fishy smell and my husband took one bite and said it tasted super fishy.  We also ordered a bowl of chicken enchiladas soup.  This is usually a hearty soup  but what we received was a water down broth with a few pieces of chicken with a bland taste. The only thing I can recommend is the chocolate chip cookie. Not sure if this was just a really bad day  but we won t be coming back.
FoodHeads,93,I wanted to have fish tacos  but they were out of tilapia  it was around noon though  . I instead had tuna melt. The sandwich was served to be a little cold and had a little  fishy  flavor. Compared to the pretty high rating  it was a little disappointing  and I might not be back to try the fish tacos.
FoodHeads,94,Okay STORY TIME  so in the midst of Austin s first ever major water crisis I find this sweet little slice of heaven  I meet Kate at the register- WHAT A GEM  She s a true treasure. Very genuinely sweet and patient  this is coming from someone who works in the service industry and understands how difficult it can be to deal with first-timers such as myself . Thank you  Kate lol  I find the perfect lunch and have CLEAN ICED TEA with it  remember  water crisis  the most wonderful music  fresh flowers on each table  and cute  quirky little antiques to keep the aesthetic.  Onto the food  WOW... Coconut milk celery tomoato soup is TO DIE FOR. The Lami sandwich came out shortly after and I almost cried when I ate it- NO JOKE. I ve never had a sandwich so perfectly toasted and deliberately constructed. Props to everyone in this kitchen  This is no subway  y all    To everyone at FoodHeads  you guys have outdone yourselves and I m so grateful. I can t believe I am just discovering this place. I might never eat at any other sandwich shop again lol. Thank y all so much  keep up this wonderful work    - sincerely   A very happy tummy
FoodHeads,95,This place is cute  amp  cozy. Lots of places to sit outside and plenty of seating inside as well. The flavors of the food mix well in each dish. Location is hidden in plain site  right off Guadalupe.
FoodHeads,96,This is a review of their catering service.  I ve never been to their brick and mortar store  but I definitely want to check it out sometime.  My non-profit was having an event for 130 people and I had been looking for a place that would be able to make and deliver 260 breakfast tacos to the Domain at 8am on a Saturday.  I called at least 7 places  including TacoDeli and Whole Foods  and well  it was just too early for these establishments.  I was even willing to pay more for the early delivery time  but nope.    Enter FoodHeads to rescue.  They were happy to take our order and deliver at the time we needed it.    They even made little signs for each kind of taco we ordered which was a huge help.  Not to mention the breakfast tacos were fantastic      This was a big hit at our event and I know now where we ll be getting breakfast tacos for our future events.    Great food  great customer service.  I definitely recommend for catering.
FoodHeads,97,FoodHeads perfectly describes what authentic Austin food is  Extremely cozy and small location. Intimate and even possible for studying. Their menu is elaborate and has plenty of options--reasonably priced and the staff is friendly and helpful. They have sandwiches  teas  salads  and Homemade desserts. I ordered the chicken special sandwich. Def a go to   
FoodHeads,98,I m so upset that I found out about FoodHeads a month before I graduated and had to leave Austin  There are so many affordable sandwich choices  and it was pretty difficult for me to choose. I settled for the Bella  and it was one of the best veggie sandwiches I ve ever had. The bread was nice and crispy  and the veggies portabello mushrooms were flavorful. My friend got the Roast Beef  amp  Brie and said it was delicious. The deli is so cute too - it s like a little house and the patio area is nice and spacious as well. It was pretty busy with a line when we went for lunch on a Friday  but the line went by pretty quickly and it was so worth the wait.
FoodHeads,99,Wow this place was so amazing. I wish there was one in Dallas   We needed a quick eat before heading to New Braunfels to float the river. SUCH GREAT SANDWICHES   Our car smelled so good from sandwich fumes.  I got the Chicken  amp  Eggplant sandwich and Thai Beef Soup combo. The flavors on the sandwich were savory and amazing. There was plenty of chicken but I don t think I got a lot of eggplant. My friend got the bello sandwich  which had mushrooms and that was also sooo good. 10 10 would recommend these sandwiches to the world. The Thai Beef soup was okay. There was a lot of beef in the soup and it kinda tasted like Vietnamese Bo Kho but it didn t have rich Thai flavors that I was expecting.  The only minor flaw in my experience is that the sandwich wrapping paper is so large and it s butcher paper. It was difficult to eat the sandwich without it being messy since it doesn t fold well.   All in all  will definitely come back when I m in town again 
FoodHeads,100,This place exhudes  Keep Austin Weird with it s ecclectic  quirky ambiance in an old crafstman style house with old fashioned tables and chairs  hardwood floors  cool pics  amp  little fun stained glass window stick-on decals  bookcases  inside or outside dining  with yummy homestyle sandwiches  salads  desserts  coffee  etc. I really liked my tuna melt  bread pudding  amp  iced mocha with amaretto  I highly recommend this cool  homey  quirky place 
FoodHeads,101,I always enjoy going to FoodHeads  the ambiance is always pleasant and the sandwiches are tasty. Today I got the Fish Torta which I thought was quite good with one issue. The apples on the sandwich were diced into small pieces which made it impossible to eat without them falling out. If the apples were sliced instead  this issue would not have occurred and it would have balanced both the flavors and topping distribution. If I order the sandwich in the future  I will request the apples sliced  though I hope that my recommendation is implemented for all FoodHeads sandwiches with apples as I m sure others have had this issue as well.
FoodHeads,102,A friend and I were looking for a deli with delicious sandwiches and decided to check this place out  and I m definitely glad that we did  Good atmosphere  great food at a reasonable price  and not too far from where we live near the UT campus    Food -  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and  with encouragement from the cashier  my friend ordered the apple pork sandwich. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the sandwiches  which were bigger than the sandwiches at other delis I ve been to. I wasn t too hungry that day  so I was actually full from eating only half the sandwich and was able to save the second half to take home. The pulled pork had quite a good portion of juicy meat on top  which pleased the my inner carnivore  and the onions were a good touch to balance out the sauce on the pork. Definitely loved the toasty bread as well   Ambiance -  This is honestly one of the biggest things I notice about a restaurant  and FoodHeads was definitely to my liking. It s a cozy house that has a small interior but plenty of shaded outdoor seating. Each table had a small vase of bright flowers on it and the chairs and tables were colorful as well. Even during busy lunch hours  the place wasn t too loud and the tables aren t too awkwardly close together. It s not one of those sleek and modern looks  but a very home-y feel that makes you want to come in and get comfortable to catch up with a friend or a lunch date.   Price -  It s the typical deli prices of around  8-9 per sandwich. Quite reasonable for a college student with a small stomach like myself  but if you re looking to get something more hearty for the same amount of money  it might be better to go elsewhere.   Additional Comments -  I believe there s no parking lot  but thankfully street parking along 34th near the restaurant is free.
FoodHeads,103,Sandwiches and soups here are much better than coffee.... don t get an iced coffee here. Thunderbird cafe is closed enough  so yourself a favor. But sandwiches are always good.
FoodHeads,104,I ordered a big order for a company lunch and one sandwich wasn t wrapped properly and spilled all over the bag  meaning someone wouldn t get their lunch. I ordered myself a veggie sandwich and the order was completely wrong. This place is usually my go to because it s classic but now I am rethinking of going back if they re not going to follow very easy directions for making and wrapping sandwiches.
FoodHeads,105,I ve heard a lot of really good things about FoodHeads  so I came with pretty high expectations.  I tried two of their breakfast options  and I was a little bit conflicted as to how I felt about this place  although that apple pork lunch sandwich is starting to sound more and more appealing because it sounds so dang awesome    . Anyway  I ll start with THE GOOD first  the ham  amp  egg sandwich - sounds simple enough  ham and egg  but WAIT there s more  Sourdough bread  blackberry jam  arugula  and swiss cheese. It was REALLY good. All of the flavors went perfectly together - I loved the sweet and salty and fresh and creamy and tangy combination. The potato salad that came with it was good  too.  THE BAD  the salmon  amp  eggs.  Eggs scrambled with smoked salmon  red onion  caper  and cheese.  This tasted SO SALTY    Smoked salmon itself is already super salty  but I think they went super overboard. Then  you bite into a caper and MORE SALT  It was not good. Definitely tasted more palatable with the jam and toast  but I would probably not order this again.  Anyway  food aside  the environment is super cute. It s like eating at Grandma s house. I ll probably come back one day to try their lunch options and see if I change my mind about this place s  meh -ness 
FoodHeads,106,Food  4 5 Selections should probably come with a side.  Service  5 5 Friendly  Atmosphere  Cozy  at home feel.  Price         Outdoor Seating  Yes
FoodHeads,107,Love this place  Can t wait to go back and try more. Had the 1 2 soup and sandwich option. Tomato soup  coconut base  super delicious . Had the egg salad sandwich  wouldn t get it with sprouts though next time  but the rest was good.
FoodHeads,108,BEST sandwich EVER. SO GOOD  very cute restaurant. Also  their tattertots are amazing- I think they only serve them during dinner. Chicken eggplant sandwich  If you love goat cheese GET THIS SANDWICH. Their sandwich salad combo is great. Also the little side of homemade bread and butter pickles are fantastic 
FoodHeads,109,I am obsessed with Foodheads right now  I have always loved their sandwiches but lately I ve been trying their salads and they are my favorite salads. The salmon and the tuna Nicoise are both delicious and filling. Their dressings are really good and the garlic Parmesan bruschetta that comes with the salmon salad is amazing. It s got raw garlic and it is perfect with the cheese and the crunch I eat of the bread. Their squash and mozzarella sandwich has been a favorite in our house for years now and is fabulous. I feel good after eating their food because I know it is fresh and healthy. We have been doing curbside so we haven t eaten inside in quite awhile but the curbside speed and service has been great. They have outdoor seating and they seem to always have outside diners. I m not sure if the inside dining room is open or not right now. I love supporting this amazing local business and I love that they have options to include meals for frontline workers and other in our community in need. You can add on a meal for them to give to someone in need when you put in your order. FoodHeads is a really special place 
FoodHeads,110,Finally had a chance to make it to food heads on a Saturday evening.  This was my first time there so I decided to stick with the specialty sandwiches since that is what they are known for. I ordered the Chicken and Eggplant togo.  We also tried to order the roast beef sandwich but they ran out of roast beef before 5pm.  My sandwich was made on two large slices of toasted rye bread and tasted fantastic. Although the bread may have been slightly over toasted  it still tasted great.  The lady that took our order and brought it to us was very friendly.    I am going to keep this review short and sweet  and just let you know  if you haven t been here  I highly recommend it.
FoodHeads,111,I may have just found one of my top 3 favorite sandwich spots in town   I ordered the Hot Pastrami  half salad half sandwich . There was plenty to fill me and take away   1  Menu- love love the variety of hot and cold sandwiches. Definitely gourmet  Large portions  amp  great sides  2  Seating- very limited inside  plenty of seating on picnic tables outside on a beautiful day  3  Service- nice and quick
FoodHeads,112,Love the food  I ve tried a few different menu items now and have never been let down.  Pssst  The chicken special sandwich is da BOMB   I come here for a latte occasionally and it s so smooth  amp  creamy. I can t get over the charm of the old house  the creaky floors and the adorable decor.  My one and only grievance that I ve encountered on many occasions is the underwhelming staff  I m pretty sure she s a manager too  . Shamefully  I don t recall her name  but I ve never once seen her smile and is often barking orders at her employees.  She clearly knows what she s doing and the food is so good it s worth looking past but also worth mentioning. Slightly on the pricier side  but when you can afford to splurge a wee bit  it s so worth it 
FoodHeads,113,Excellent box lunches great sandwiches and salads great service highly recommend. Their lunchbox pickles are the best.
FoodHeads,114,Absolutely amazing place. I wish I lived closer to come more. The staff was sooo patient and friendly. They let us sample all the soups and gave great recommendations on what to get. I love the atmosphere of the are. It was a beautiful day when we went so we could enjoy the outside. Our kids were with us and they brought us theirs as soon as it was ready which is so helpful with kids. But when our food came out I was shocked by the presentation. It was beautiful and tasted better. Such great flavors  Bella sandwich and black bean soup.
FoodHeads,115,Phenomenal. I went half and half with an acquaintance with the Chicken Special Sandwich and the Chicken Caesar Sandwich.  Both very good and well put together. Saw them doing To-Go orders as well. This is a business we all should be supporting in times like these.
FoodHeads,116,FoodHeads is a weird name in a weird town  so another sandwich joint is a little disappointing.  The location is set up in a large house converted into a restaurant. There is seating indoors  on the large porch and on the front lawn. The place is charming and has a little of the  shabby chic  decor.   The menu consists mostly of sandwiches and salads. The sandwiches are not just your typical  subs  but have specialty and gourmet toppings. You can get the sandwiches on several types of bread including Nine Grain  6th St. Sourdough  Rustic Baguette  Focaccia  Telera  Bolillo. If you re not feeling one of the specialty sandwiches you can make your own fresh deli sandwich. There are also vegetarian offerings. One of the highlights of this place is they make all their own condiments in house which really got me excited.  Overall  I wasn t very impressed. There was a line of 10 people and it was busy but there was only one person taking orders. Finally  when I ordered I requested my sandwich with bagna cauda and the woman didn t know what I was talking about. The sandwich came and there was barely any condiments on it. In fact the sandwich was just kind of slopped together and was hard to eat.   Another highlight were all the specialty ice teas which were delightful.  This place is fine and it s nice to sit on the porch with an Arnold Palmer and watch the world go buy. I could easily boost the stars if the service was improved a tad bit. My suggestions are to pare down the menu and focus on the best and most popular. Really highlight the specialty condiments and let people get their own  or serve enough to satisfy . If you pay  10 overall for a sandwich it better be really good. Maybe have two people taking orders during busy times.
FoodHeads,117,Chicken special is fantastic. Chicken is cooked perfectly and the tarragon mayo is delicious 
FoodHeads,118,Top 5 Cinnamon Roll of all time. ALL TIME.  The sandwiches are great too. What a wonderful little spot hidden in central Austin.
FoodHeads,119,Each time I go here I am left amazed  All sandwiches I ve had here are delicious  I ve brought groups of friends and colleagues here as well and none have been disappointed.
FoodHeads,120,Holy cow the brownies are good. So chocolatey you d swear its a bar of chocolate with pecans  I ate three and regretted I couldn t take home the rest. The tiny little cherry pies were equally as delicious  topped with vanilla ice cream   Uhm  yes  please   The got the chicken and eggplant sandwich which was mind blowing. Chicken breast and top of juicy eggplant  with blackberry vinaigrette  It was a haunting combination. I wish I had leftovers just so I could eat more of it  but I finished it all  very quickly  too quickly .
FoodHeads,121,Great sandwiches and such a nice environment. Girls seem to love this place for its country-home feel and its mismatched chairs  sooooo quirky . I love this place because for such a quaint establishment I can still get some hefty and tasty sandwiches.  Jokes aside  FoodHeads really is quite charming. I seem to have only visited on perfect days as the sunlight always lights up the porch area so beautifully. The books on the shelves  flowers on the tables  and other small details around the house bring out the most of the restaurant.  While this description makes FoodHeads sound like a nice little tea cottage  the menu also packs quite a punch. The Gypsy Grove is my favorite sandwich  as it perfectly brings together a number of flavors into a pretty filling sandwich  tenderloin  ham  swiss  fried egg  jalapeno relish  and tabasco slaw... just wow.  I m really impressed by how FoodHeads maintains such a homey atmosphere while also serving such delicious and creative sandwiches. Easily one of my favorite places in Austin 
FoodHeads,122,4.5 stars  Dammm one of the best sandwich shops in Austin. Who knew a sandwich could be this good had the pastrami on poppy seed bread it was amazing. The side of  pickles are tangy sweet and Delicious. I come here again.  It s a little old house converted into a restaurant  the only complain is the refreshments are not ice cold but you can get an ice cup if not it be a five star  Chips not needed next time.
FoodHeads,123,Some of the best sandwiches around. Their staples are always delightful and the rotating menu is diverse enough to please regulars.   The ambience make you feel at home and relaxed. I would recommend the tuna melt to any first timer with a side of any soup.   Service is fast and efficient  especially considering the lunch crowds. They could be nicer but are never rude and usually very pleasant.   In a word  Excellent.
FoodHeads,124,We have been going to FoodHeads for a couple of years. Breakfast  lunch  takeaway  snacks-we ve tried them all and have not had a failure. Yes  we eat out a lot. With Covid they are having to do takeaway but on a cool day we ate outside. The staff are delightful. Everyone is courteous and more than willing to explain menu items if you aren t sure what you want. Breakfast was a treat after a doctor appointment. Lunch is a treat anytime we are in the area. And  yes  we have brought it home to eat-soups  though it is hot right now   sandwiches  salads and wonderful coconut cupcakes  They are more than generous with their sandwich fillings.
FoodHeads,125,Amazing little hidden cafe  Cute house. The crew is nice. The food was great  Roast beef and Brie sandwich with tortilla soup was awesome 
FoodHeads,126,Foodheads is a dope sandwich place. My favorite thing to get is the Salmon Bagel  The staff is friendly and the place has a really cute  quirky vibe to it  real Austin-y . I ve tried the applewood pork sandwich before  but the mustard was a little too pungent for my taste. Their potato salad and pickled veggie sides are both yummy  Definitely a good place to go to for a quick lunch or on a nice day.   Tl dr  nice lunch place  Try the salmon bagel.
FoodHeads,127,This is my go to for delicious sandwiches and salads in Central Austin. The Tuna Melt is just the right combo of tuna and toppings. Greek Salad has lots of fresh veggies. Love their sweet pickles.  I tried the iced coffee today and it was fresh  not at all bitter like some cold brews. It gets busy so you may have to wait a bit but it s worth it 
FoodHeads,128,Oh my goodness  this place  Delicious  high-quality food  friendly staff that treat you like old friends  fantastic iced tea  and all in a repurposed old house with a lovely porch and outdoor seating area. A local gem 
FoodHeads,129,Great venue and great food. From the converted house venue  to the variety of potted plants and random trinkets out on the front lawn  to the friendly staff  this place is unashamedly Austin. They have a ton of variety of sandwiches  plus you can build your own. I went with the Bella  a vegetarian sandwich  I subbed mine on sourdough  they usually use a grain bread  with grilled portabella mushrooms blue cheese  spinach  tomato  and a delicious blackberry balsamic glaze. I also tried a couple of their unique condiments  the jalapeno mustard and the red pepper-eggplant mayonnaise. The sandwich was literally bursting with flavor  and juiciness   I also recommend trying their iced teas and lemonade  everything is freshly made in store and taste great. The coconut-almond iced tea was my personal favorite.
FoodHeads,130,We had lunch today at FoodHeads for the first time. It was excellent. I ordered the Cobb salad  generous serving of grilled chicken  lots of warm bacon  fresh avocado  and a house-made vinaigrette that was extraordinary. My wife ordered the Roast Beef and Brie sandwich. It was also excellent  pilled high with lots of tender meat on freshly baked bread. There are several iced teas offered. The atmosphere is  Old Austin   chilled and relaxed. I highly recommend FoodHeads.
FoodHeads,131,Cute interior and friendly staff  but a bit pricey for what you get.  11 for a sandwich seems a bit steep to me and it wouldn t be the top of my list  but not a bad spot if you re meeting someone and want to stay to chat for a while to take in the atmosphere.
FoodHeads,132,Counter help should be HAPPY to get a tip  ANY tip. Bitching because your friend  only got  1 tip  on a  6 purchase  and then short-pouring my drink  just convinced me to tip 0  on the  0 I ll ever be not spending here again. Danged entitled ersatz hippie millennials  go suck an egg 
FoodHeads,133,OMG the food is so delicious  Just had it for the first time  Tuna sandwich and potato salad. DELICIOUS  And an amazing staff. Go get some food form them 
FoodHeads,134,Long story short  With its mismatched chairs and homey wall art  FoodHeads is an adorable little self-service cafe with a cozy atmosphere and light and delicious sandwiches. It s perfect for a date with your special someone or with a small gathering of friends to catch up with.   My group of 3 arrived to FoodHeads on a rainy Wednesday during lunchtime. As others mentioned  FoodHeads is a small house so there is a limited amount of seating both inside and outside.  Since it was highly recommend by Yelpers and my friends  I ordered the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin. One of my friends ordered the Salmon Bagel  and the other ordered the Fish Torta. The Apple Pork and the Fish Torta came with a side of pickles  while the Salmon Bagel came with a dash of mashed potatoes.   Personally  I did not like the Apple Pork. The dijon mustard really stood out and overpowered all the other flavors. It added a sharp kick to the sandwich. It was not what I expected it to be. The pork itself was juicy and had a light sprinkling of peppers. The ciabatta bread is hearty  so I walked away with half a sandwich to take home.  For my friends order  I simply tried their fishes. However  they did not complain about the mixture of flavors and enjoyed their sandwiches. The salmon itself was very light and fresh. The fish for the Torta was quite fishy  but I liked the black-pepper seasoning on it.  If I were to come back  I will definitely get the Salmon Bagel and possibly the Apple Pork with the Dijon Mustard on the side. In the end  if you want a little glimpse of the Austin culture is like  come here 
FoodHeads,135,Perfect place to take Mom. I took my mom here. She loved it.   If you re in the mood for some delicious soup  amp  sandwich GO If you like veggies GO If you are trying to be cute or just really are super cute GO  Indoors and outdoor seating. Perfect for a gal date. You feel healthy when really the food just tastes so good that it makes you feel good  Love that kind
FoodHeads,136,A friend of mine who used to live in Austin recommended this place and it did not disappoint  The food is delicious  the people are nice and the place is very sweet  Loved seating outside on the porch  perfect for a lunch 
FoodHeads,137,Hey Food Heads   When you list  garlic  as a condiment or add-on for a sandwich  people assume it is roasted garlic or baked garlic. Raw garlic is NOT OKAY. Unfortunately  we got our food to go  so I couldn t ask for a replacement fix. Ruined not only my lunch  but my entire evening  as I could not get the taste out of my mouth. Boyfriend can confirm.   Also  my boyfriend s bread was stale. Also not acceptable when you pay  10 for a sandwich.   Otherwise  cute place  good veggie options. May or may not return.
FoodHeads,138,I can t believe it took us so long to finally try this place  I ve lived in Austin for 21 years and my dad and I finally tried this place a few months ago and we fell in love  Not only do I love the look of the place- the restored house into restaurant- but their food is fabulous   I only wish they were open past 4pm so I could go for dinner.   My favorite sandwich so far is the chicken special  but my dad loves the roast beef and Brie as well as the gypsy grove  grilled pork tenderloin . I m looking forward to trying their prosciutto and egg salad as well as their squash and mozzarella. I have not been when they serve their dinner menu  but it looks delicious and we ll definitely be back soon to try more things out    Go go go  I m sure FoodHeads will not disappoint 
FoodHeads,139,I think this is my favorite spot to get a sandwich in Austin. Not only are there a good variety of options on the menu  but the price is affordable  the location is adorable  and the food is so bomb.  I especially like the chicken eggplant  it comes with a really delicious pesto and I always order the half sandwich because it is huge  I would also recommend trying the chicken tortilla soup. It s a bit greasier than I d like but nothing to complain about.  Overall  Food Heads is definitely a go-to brunch or lunch spot in Austin 
FoodHeads,140,Really good food and down home style. The food was cooked perfectly and had the chance to meet the owner  The owner was very down-to-earth and by the looks and feel of the place  has excellent values and principles.  My wife and I ordered salads  coffee  and dessert. She ordered the Salmon salad and I had the Steak salad. Both were excellent and the Coconut cupcake was awesome  not too sweet and very moist. I can t wait to try the sandwiches 
FoodHeads,151,This place has yummy food  We had the Lanai and the Gypsy Grove sandwiches. Delicious plus the coconut cupcake was to die for. The customer service is wonderful 
FoodHeads,152,Foodheads is delicious  I had the hot pastrami today and MMM MMMH did it HIT the SPOT  Esp with the little side of rstd red pepper mayo yum.  Their iced coffee is hands down the best in Austin. Like for reals.  When I ask if the coffee is strong and black I mean BLACK  not some weak ass tea looking shit.  And this iced coffee is black  its delicious but not acidic  and it will WAKE YOU the fck UP. SO GOOD.    It was a perfect spot to swing by for lunch and enjoy the outdoor porch with the beautiful weather..
FoodHeads,153,Place is cutesy and has some ok stuff but it surely isn t a 5 and it s not quite a 4 so it s a 3. Just had chicken special and I assure there isn t a damn thing special about it except when you go to eat it falls apart. Also the lettuce selection  I admit the lettuce is fresh but the big huge white middle pieces just doesn t have to be in the sandwich. Bulky white hard lettuce is not gourmet. The audio quality on the speakers outside is awful. We are talking bad mid to high tweeters playing some wanna be old school hipster rock. Was just down right annoying.  Place is meh at best.
FoodHeads,154,Overpriced for what it is. 2 sandwiches  one of them a grilled cheese  and a salad was nearly  40. Also for the price is expect some newer furnishings  not old tables and chairs.
FoodHeads,155,Yay for the food  but the service is meh.  I really enjoy the food and since that s the most important part for me when dining at a restaurant  I took away 1 star for the poor service.  I like a good balance between food  service  and environment...but food is my top tier priority.    I ve gone many times before during the work week for lunch  and it s typically the same girl that takes your order and payment at the counter.  She never smiles  she always looks stressed and is never friendly.  It always seems like you re putting her out by ordering food.  I ve tried striking up conversation with her  and it s just always more work and more painful to try with her  so I m done.    Prosciutto and egg salad  chicken tortilla soup  pulled pork sandwich  tuna melt- all my faves. But you really can t go wrong with any of the menu choices   There is seating indoors and outdoors.  Street parking only. Lines during lunch can get long and out the door.  Cute little house and you can walk over to Sno Beach afterwards for dessert 
FoodHeads,156,Great Sandwiches and Patio   If they have the Coconut Cupcakes.....get one    So happy we found this place and plan on coming back again on our next visit to Austin.
FoodHeads,157,Creaky floors. Eclectic garden. Fresh produce. Zapps Chips. Unique jams and drizzles. Gourmet and creative sandwiches. Cute little tasty bowls of soups. Perfect place to be basic and take a bunch of great instagram photos. Oh  and your dog can be there too. What a great addition to your quaint photo with your sandwich  friends  topo chico and the dog Ralph. This isn t a cheap stop  but it is a cute and fun healthy one. Try it out 
FoodHeads,158,The beauty of this place is in the details. The adorable house  the handwritten chalkboard menus  the pretty potted flowers  the outside tables with big happy umbrellas  the friendly service  the wifi  the quick turnaround on order  a big copper urn with water in it  crushed ice machine... and those are just the environmental delights.  I took one bite of my food and said to my lunch companion  I think a miracle just happened in my mouth . Perfectly grilled squash with fresh mozz  coarse grain bread  homemade pesto and lots of spinach. These people are doing something  a lot of things  very right. And if i didn t know better  I d say they dialed up the perfect weather as well.
FoodHeads,159,Damn. I was hoping my quest to find the best hot ham  amp  swiss sandwich in Austin would end here. But alas  Buenos Aires still rules the roost.  Fresh sandwiches  pleasant outdoor seating  quick service  moderate prices  variety for vegs   and a nice stop for a noonday meal.  Almost Scrumptious.
FoodHeads,160,We stopped at Food Heads for a late breakfast after a night of tearing it up Austin-style. This place is located on a side street in a house that was converted to a restaurant.  We arrived right before the lunch crowd did  and it got pretty crowded      We both ordered smoked salmon  lox  and cream cheese on an everything bagel  very New York of us  we know .  It came along with bean sprouts  tomato  and red onion.  We placed our order inside and waited at a table outside for our food...and waited...and waited.  We were confused because we were the only customers at this point. They delivered our sandwiches to us along with a big DELISH chocolate chip cookie to make up for the crazy long wait.  Their toaster apparently crapped out so they were scrambling to ensure that our bagels were toasted through another means.  Nice touch and very much appreciated   I love when a restaurant makes up for a boo-boo  especially when it involves a cookie that is the size of my head.  And the sandwich was fantastic.  I would have never thought to add bean sprouts  but it was a really nice accent.  The sandwiches came along with something akin to a German potato salad  vinegar instead of mayo  and pickled cucumbers.  Pretty  pretty good.  By the time we left  this place was hopping.  There were no tables open on the porch and the inside was getting pretty crowded as well.  The customers were a mix of tourists  business people  and locals.  Everyone was super-friendly.    Nice vibe 
FoodHeads,161,4.5 stars   Are the people of Austin crazy  This place is mediocre.....at best. At worst  Very bland and over priced. Staff could probably use a happy meal in the morning so they treat the customers better. I just hate feeling like I m bothering somebody when I m there asking them to do their job. I d personally avoid going ever again
FoodHeads,162,Great little lunch spot  So cute with indoor and outdoor seating  shade sun and fans  I got the tuna melt and my friend got the chicken special. Both came with a side of sweet pickles. I tried their him made lemonade which was great  Will definitely go back 
FoodHeads,163,None of the sandwiches were looking good to me  but then I noticed the fish tacos on their menu. And when in Austin I ve learned to always go with the tacos. And another taco success- may just be the best fish tacos I ve ever had.  Fresh tilapia  salsa had the perfect amount of spice to it  and the tortillas were absolutely amazing  Austin could teach Chicago a thing or two about how to make fresh tortillas.  Best of all it wasn t super crazy with all the SXSW craziness going on this weekend...I m a fan 
FoodHeads,164,Employees act as if they can t be bothered. It s not like we re paying for goods and services  or anything.   Good product  crappy staff. Austin is such a nice city  I m sure it wouldn t be hard to find more pleasant employees.
FoodHeads,165,A very good sandwich. A tad pricey for a sandwich  but on par with other gourmet sandwich joints. Cozy  cool  and quiet atmosphere.
FoodHeads,166,After trying this place out for the first time and loving it  I came back the next day with a friend to try it out again.    First the good news.  My made-to-order Deli Sandwich was superb   Roasted Turkey  Black Forest Ham  Sharp Cheddar  Brown Deli Mustard  and Fresh Elephant Garlic Mayonnaise on Grilled Multi Grain bread.  Tons of meat  sauce  cheese   amp  flavor   It should be named the  Tom Bomb.   I give it a 10 out of 10.  Check out the pictures I took of it.    Now for the not-so-good news.  My friend got the Apple Pork Tenderloin.  The sandwich overall and especially the toasted baguette was very dry.  And there was hardly any meat  especially compared to my sandwich.  We had to go up to the counter and get some Garlic Mayonaisse just to give it some moisture and flavor.  VERY disappointing sandwich for  8.75.  We have no idea why so many people raved about it.  We give it a 4 out of 10  and that s being generous.  Check out the picture I took of it  too.  Finally  we shared a cup of Roasted Onion Soup.  Extremely disappointing.  Very weird rendition of onion soup.  Nothing like a traditional french onion soup.  For example  it had crunchy onions in it rather than carmelized ones.  Not sure why they would think that s an improvement.  Very unusual flavor  and not in a good way.  We both took only 2 spoonfuls  which basically tells it all.  Stay away from this item.  Overall  4 out of 5 stars because of the 2 outstanding sandwiches I had on 2 consecutive days.
FoodHeads,167,FoodHeads finally meets my needs for a good  unique sandwich close to the south side of town. There is a place up north but that s too far for anyone living south of Airport and 35. This doesn t mean that there aren t good sandwich joints around the area  just few that can do to a sandwich that s completely different from the norm.  I have been wanting to try this place for a long time and was able to do so late on a Thursday night. It wasn t busy so I was scared that we wouldn t get good service and that many of the items may have been sold out. They slapped me in the face on both accounts. The guy handling the counter was more than gracious to have us in  and everything we wanted was available.   We ordered the pan fried crab cakes  the squash sandwich  the gypsy grove  and some of the garlic tater tots. The combination of flavors in my mouth that night left me crying for more. The crab cakes were light and were insanely fresh  not too scented and old. The squash sandwich surprised me the most. I did not expect all that flavor from a vegetarian sandwich.  I don t know which part of it I enjoyed more  the vinaigrette or the pesto. It s hard to choose between two powerful flavors.  The pork in the gypsy had some pork so moist it broke when my brother breathed on it. The tater tots were also simple but oh so good that we scooped every last bit of flavor from the tray.  The service needs to be mentioned again as it was stellar despite being so late in the day.
FoodHeads,168,I had not visited my little go to spot in quite sometime living and working in north Austin  but I had a training today off the Lamar and Guadalupe split and had to return to this house of comfort and yummms. Food Heads will never disappoint. Tortilla soup was as solid as I remembered and the chimichurri sandwich was so on point. Staff remain friendly and personable. I love this place  They have made my tummy smile for over a decade...
FoodHeads,169,Turned away 8 hungry dudes about to drop  100  5 minutes before close. Bad business.   9 16 14 3 55 pm
FoodHeads,170,If my head did turn into food - like in those old fruit Gusher commericals - it would have been a happy pig with a fried egg on top after eating here.  Really like this spot. This sandwich caf  is in a very cute converted house near campus - eclectic  cozy  crafty  kind of like an etsy shop  in a good way   and more importantly the food is really tasty.  Awesome sandwiches  I had the Gypsy Grove and my friend had the Lami  and good looking salads and desserts.
FoodHeads,171,We went here one night with friends. We were trying to find someplace new to eat  and find it we did. It was an early Saturday evening and we were easily able to find a parking spot and for some reason it wasn t packed. Why it wasn t I m not sure. The only explanation I have is that the majority of people in Austin don t know about this place.  The place is very cute. If it wasn t face-melting hot outside I would have wanted to hang outside in their outdoor seating area and probably never leave. It was very cute and actually did have fans going but since my office at work is usually about 87 degrees  I was able to persuade our small group to sit inside.  I ordered the Lami Sandwich. It had grilled salami  fresh mozzarella  spinach  tomatoes  and blackberry balsamic vinaigrette on toasted multigrain bread. It was most excellent. Everything about the sandwich was really good although I really couldn t taste the vinaigrette. Not a big deal though because all the other ingredients were very tasty. I especially liked the multigrain bread. I think I ate every little bread crump off my plate. I had the fresh fruit as a side  I like that they offered that . A friend had the icebox pickles as a side. She convinced me to try it even though I am not a pickle fan. They were very good.   The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I m already looking forward to my next visit there. The only problem is that this place ruined me for other sandwiches.
FoodHeads,172,Delicious sandwiches    I can t wait to try their breakfast  amp  dinner    I ve had a different sandwich for lunch three times  and I honestly can t pick a favorite. They were sooooo yummy     I love sitting outside on a warm Austin day  enjoying people-watching and awesome food. Highly recommended   
FoodHeads,173,What a great selection of sandwiches and salads   They have a dinner menu now that includes more entrees.  I had their pot-roast-shepherds-pie-like-yummy-thing-to-die-for and it was delicious    I can t remember the name right now  so that s what I m calling it.  It came with a huge salad and was  13.  Completely reasonable price from the amount and quality.  Trust me  I don t have a lot of money  so I m quite frugal.  The other 3 in my party had sandwiches- Grilled Salami  amp  Mozzarella  Pulled Pork and Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin. They were huge sandwiches that came with one side and were under  9.  We all sampled each others meals to get an idea of what to order next time   Staff was wonderful  inside was comfortable and looking forward to it cooling down some  so we can eat outside on their huge patio area.   This is definitely a great place to eat- fresh food  lots of choices  and great staff.   Parking is tough during the day  but after 5 Mon-Fri and all day Sat they have a lot in back with plenty of parking.
FoodHeads,174,Soup s great  sandwiches are good and wifi s available making this a pretty solid spot to get a bite to eat while getting some work done.
FoodHeads,175,Cute location and the chimichurri was soooooo good  
FoodHeads,176,The best sandwich joint in Austin  hands down. Get here before noon to avoid a massive lineup at the counter. Great patio out front  dog friendly  with picnic benches and various tables curbside and up by the building. Decently sized indoor seating area for allergy season or mid-Summer.   Truly gourmet  handmade sandwiches and soups. If there was such a thing as a sandwich artist  they would be working here - stupid Subway - putting together some pre-cut crap from headquarters doesn t make you an artist...   Any of the regular menu items are great  but I almost always get the weekly special. Todays was a fresh line caught Ahi Tuna steak sandwich on focachia bread with caramelized onions  balsamic vinaigrette and fresh avocado. Truly amazing. Some of my other favorites are the steak sandwich  the roasted lamb  the salami with fresh mozzarella and the pulled pork. You really can t go wrong with anything here.    All of the sandwiches come with a small side of cole slaw or pickles.   They are pretty expensive sandwiches    9 each  but are large and definitely worth it.   You won t leave hungry... If you don t like your bread toasted  make sure to request that it not be.  They finally bought an ice machine too  which is nice if you want a cold drink. They literally used to run out of ice  WTF    Closed Sundays.   Hippie friendly.     
FoodHeads,177,After hearing a million great things about this place  a friend and I decided to check it out for lunch on a Saturday morning. It was quite close to campus  but the surroundings made it feel like we were in another part of Austin  Parking was super easy to find as well.   Now  the food. I ordered the Fish Torta sandwich  amp  my friend had the Grilled Chicken sandwich. It was light  yet savory  Service was also friendly and quick.   Definitely recommended for brunch  and to agree with everyone else  undefinable Austin vibe   
FoodHeads,178,How in the world did I not know about this place while I went to UT during my college years    Well after my lunch here  I shall be making it my number 1 pit stop whenever I come visit Austin.   Seating can be a pain in the butt since it s very limited inside so I suggest trying to save a spot before getting in line to order  if possible  if not  it s still worth the wait to order food here.   I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Eggplant  Served on toasted multigrain with spinach  tomato  goat cheese  amp  blackberry balsamic vinaigrette  and it was worth every bite.   My sister got the Spicy Ahi Tuna Sandwich  Seared Chili rubbed wild-caught Ahi tuna steak on toasted telera with lime slaw  avocado  and habenero - blackberry balsamic carmelized onion relish  and it is definitely spicy but delicious.   The sides they give you are rather dinky so that was a letdown.
FoodHeads,179,I was introduced to FoodHeads by a friend who really wanted a breakfast taco at 2pm. She said that FoodHeads had the best breakfast tacos  and so we went. She was not wrong. The breakfast tacos here are inexpensive  fast coming out  and are deliciously made-to-order.   I ve been back a few times to try different items  but I think I ll stick with the breakfast tacos. I ve had a few sandwiches here  but I don t remember half of them. One is a custom one called the Ian  named after the cook who makes it  and it was way too spicy for me and I had to throw half of it away.  The cookies here are amazing  though  and I think they sell Dublin Dr. Pepper.  I like the decor and the fact that this place is like 4 blocks away from me  in a cute little house with funky stuff sprawled all over the front yard.   I hate the fact that they close at 4pm. I like my breakfast foods at non-breakfast times. 6pm would be more convenient for me  but I m sure they have their reasons for closing so early.
FoodHeads,180,Today I had the most unkind and unfriendly service I ve experienced in recent memory. The woman who waited on me was visibly annoyed at being interrupted to wait on me at the counter  and answered my questions in the shortest way possible  while staring blankly at me as if I were an idiot. It was actually sort of disorienting because it was so rude  and it definitely ruined the experience of my meal.   I related all of this to a friend. She introduced me to FoodHeads and goes there at least once a week. She said that she had the exact same experience  with the same employee  last week.   I like the food here  and the house itself is completely charming and adorable. I ll think twice about going back though  and if i see this particular employee again  I ll probably turn around and go elsewhere.
FoodHeads,181,Cozy  Austin-y feel - it s a cute little gem not far from the UT campus    I ordered 1 2 a squash sandwich with a side of the sundried tomato soup. The squash sandwich was delicious  the basil pesto and blackberry balsamic vinaigrette really kicked up the flavor. I was there for lunch right around 12 30 on a Friday  and the business was booming during that time. Noise level got a little loud  to the point where sometimes it was hard to hear every word someone next to me was saying.   Nevertheless  I was comfortably satisfied  i.e. full and happy  with my 1 2 sandwich  small soup side  and the pickles on the side. At first I thought I would still be hungry after finishing all that  but I  ahem  or rather  my stomach  was pleasantly surprised.   I picked up one of their buy 12 lunches  get one free card  so I will definitely be back whenever I m in the mood for a nice Austin-y environment.
FoodHeads,182,FoodHeads is quite possibly one of the homiest sandwich places I ve ever eaten at in my life. Located inside a small house  I know  so Austin    it just calls out to me and makes me want to have lunch there every day.  Their menu has everything from fish tacos to steak sandwiches and since I err on the side of there s-no-such-thing-as-too-much-meat  I tried out their steak sandwich special of the day  chimichurri steak sandwich. I knew it d be a winner.. I ve never met a steak or chimichurri sauce I didn t like.  And boy was I right. Amazing sandwich -- not too much chimichurri sauce  although I would get it on the side if you re not the biggest fan  and the steak was easy to eat. My mom got the fish tacos which was surprisingly heavy on the fish  Comparable in size to the fish tacos I d had in California earlier that week    Lunch here will most likely run you less than  10 and service isn t bad -- our sandwiches were out within 10-15 minutes of us ordering. No parking lot but tons of parking on the street. It s the perfect place to have a quick lunch during a busy work day. Oh and try their fresh baked cookies. They re just as delightful as their sandwiches 
FoodHeads,183,Hands down one of the best sandwich places in town. Parking on 34th can be a pain but they do have a couple spots behind the house.
FoodHeads,184,I hated my meal- the chicken sandwich was not good and the tortilla soup was so watery and disgusting. I am very upset as I spent near  15 and i didn t even eat it. Will not be going back
FoodHeads,185,Best sandwiches in Austin  Great variety  quality  and quantity. Heavy on the bungalow-cum-food spot ambience. Great patio options on a nice day and cozy interior as well. Can get busy  but that s a good sign  right  Inventive sandwich combinations are served up with homemade pickles.
FoodHeads,186,This place is painfully Austin in all the best ways. A very simple and ever evolving menu made of well-crafted organic choices. There are always interesting specials  salads and sandwiches  mostly that are all worth a try.  I ve never been here when the crowd is huge  but it is always strong and steady even when I ve been by mid-afternoon. A cool place to hang out and sip a tea even if you are by yourself working on a Yelp post or email to Mom.  Some locals may have missed this place thinking it was  a college spot   but it definitely has appeal well beyond.
FoodHeads,187,Was really excited to try this place after seeing all the other reviews  Clean and friendly environment. The food on the other hand...  I ordered a small Greek salad and the tuna melt. The salad was bland  nothing special. The croutons were stale.  The tuna melt...was basically like eating Dijon mustard in bread. It was so bad it made my nose burn. Highly recommend NOT getting this sandwich.
FoodHeads,188,Came here on a Monday around 11 20  and there was only one other customer besides myself. By 11 50 am the place had rapidly filled up with professionals and the idle rich  popped collar douche bag .  I had the roast beef sandwich with brie that came garnished with fresh greens and a mildly spicy mustard. The bread was sturdy enough to hold the sandwich together without being too tough and chewy.  The side I chose was coleslaw  and it was satisfyingly peppery. I think my total came to  10-11 since I had a coca-cola with the order.  I already have plans to come back and try some of the other sandwiches  and perhaps the French Onion soup.
FoodHeads,189,As someone who swears by Fricanos as the sandwich place to go  I never really took the initiative to try foodheads inspite of my friends telling me it was on par with Fricanos. Well  it just so happened my work chose to cater from Foodheads this past week so I got to finally try this place  for free at that.  I tried the Spicy Applewood tenderloin sandwich  which is apples  fresh spinach  a slice of roasted pork loin  some mustard  and a thick slice of melted gouda cheese. Suffice to say  I was really impressed with the flavor  shockingly impressed. The pork is succulent and tender  bursting with vibrant flavor with every bite. The mustard adds a little bit of bite and the apples finish it with a kiss of sweetness. It s a perfectly balanced sandwich. The only thing that surprised me was the fact they didn t add a slice of applewood bacon  given the name of the sandwich  I figured it d go perfectly  adding a bit of crunch on top of the spinach and a bit more smokiness  but that s just me being picky.  So after this rave review  why is it only 4 stars  Is it because I m a biased Fricano s snob  Not really. I actually like this sandwich in terms of pure flavor and creativity better than Fricano s  but quantity is an issue. Whereas at Fricanos I can get a sandwich for  9 and know I ll be full because it is both quantity and quality  I can t say the same here at foodheads. Even with a side of chips  I wasn t full afterwards. So if you aren t that hungry  I would choose Foodheads over Fricanos  but if you re pretty hungry  like I was at this time   I would choose Fricanos. But that s just my 2 cents. Both are great shops and I hope to try more of Foodheads creative menu in the future 
FoodHeads,190,I don t really get tired of this place. I usually get the Lamb Sandwich which comes with thick cut slices of lamb with delicious eggplant and feta cheese on it. I m not a big fan of cheese but the combo goes well together. I ve also had the Apple Pork which was pretty delicious too.  Parking can be hard to find on weekends and other busy times. The portions are big  the staff is nice  and the atmosphere is great.
FoodHeads,191,Great place not too far from west campus. I had the tuna melt and my other friends got the chicken Caesar salad sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich. They loved their sandwiches  so I d recommend them  The tuna melt wasn t alright but I wouldn t order it again. There s two parking lots and some street parking too. I ll see be coming back again.
FoodHeads,192,I really love the design of the place  I d go for the atmosphere alone. Their sandwiches are decent... I feel they sound better on paper than they are in practice. I think right adjective would be  artsy  but if you re having trouble imagining that  go try them for yourself.  Out of all the sandwiches I ve tried  the chicken eggplant seems to be my favorite or perhaps the only good one . I like how it s grilled with plenty of olive oil  and the balsamic brought the mix of flavors together. pic included 
FoodHeads,193,FoodHeads is my favorite place in Austin to get a sandwich  It s in a cozy refurbished house with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a rotating selection of delicious teas to try. I love the chicken Caesar sandwich  And the pickles that come on the side are incredible  Everything on the menu is reasonably priced too 
FoodHeads,194,Such a great local spot with cute inside and outside feel. I come here for lunch and they always have fresh salad or sandwiches with daily specials. The staff is friendly and food comes out pretty quick 
FoodHeads,195,FoodHeads rules. I love the atmosphere - a converted house tucked away on 34th street that feels like it was born to be the perfect neighborhood lunch spot  it reminds me of G s Deli down south or Little Deli a bit further north in that way .   I m basically addicted to the chicken and eggplant sandwich  which comes with goat cheese  basil pesto  tomatoes  spinach  and a vinaigrette dressing on multigrain bread  and is so gigantic that it s easily 2 meals. It s  9 and worth every penny. I also recommend the tuna nicoise or pastrami sandwiches  but you should try them first  since after you get the chicken and eggplant you ll probably never get anything else. Their side soups are also excellent  and I enjoy the potato salad too. One of these days I m going to pretend my favorite order doesn t exist and try the fish torta  or maybe get here in time for breakfast tacos.  Parking can be a drag  but it s unimpeachable in every other respect. Try walking or biking like a true Austinite 
FoodHeads,196,Just had lunch here  and it was so worth the sweaty bike ride to eat here   The salmon salad sandwich was divine   It was a great salmon salad  no mayo   with a wide variety of textures  none of them mushy.  As a little sweet surprise  there is even a small amount of apple mixed in with the thick cut tomatoes  red onion  and lettuce  can t recall the variety .  The bread they used was also outstanding and toasted to perfection.  Cole slaw was tasty sweet and matched the sandwich perfectly.  Great ambiance and service  too   Eclectic little house with a patient  friendly wait staff.  I will definitely trek back here  with a lighter backpack  to sit outside on their porch and enjoy another of their enticing wiches.
FoodHeads,197,Always a favorite lunch place  we ordered appetizers for our son s wedding from Foodheads. Everything was perfect and reasonably priced plus they had an option of providing nice platters and bowls for serving for a small charge. Would definitely recommend considering catering from Foodheads if you want a change from the standard Central Market party platters.
FoodHeads,198,FoodHeads is awesome  Extremely delicious sandwiches that never let me down. The pulled pork  hot pastrami  chimichurri steak...always good  they have excellent salads as well  the pickles and slaw is very tasty as a side and the homemade lemonade is quite tasty 
FoodHeads,199,This establishment is still the best place in town to get catering  and also a sandwich when you are hungry and picking up your catering . Friendly staff  very organized and a super sweet atmosphere overall. My orders have always been right and ready to go when I arrive. I love their simplicity and  the quality of the ingredients.  Let s keep supporting such a great business 
FoodHeads,200,Saw this as Austin s top sandwich shops. Did not disappoint. Food heads was excellent. I m a little weary of the sanitation  but the food quality is excellent. Should have clarified comment about sanitation. Simply found lipstick on a glass. Highly recommend.
FoodHeads,201,I really enjoy putting food on my head so this place is totally my style.   I was just informed that this place is not intended for people to come and decorate your head with food.
FoodHeads,202,This place makes great sammies.  It is super quaint  and usually I like to sit outside  but there is inside seating available as well.  Their chicken and eggplant sandwiches stands out  but there are lots of interesting sandwiches to choose from  and I ve never really gone wrong.  I got the fish tacos the other day to try something new  but I wish I had stuck with a sandwich instead.  They have house made thinly sliced pickles on the side with each order and they are perfection.  I also love their iced tea and lemonade set up here.  They have two zhi teas at any time as well as the regular sweet and unsweet options.  It s those little things.  We tried the coconut cupcake this time  and it was very impressive  so it appears their desserts are on point too.  You can take out  but the atmosphere is one of the best things about this place  so I recommend staying there to dine.  Prices are a little on the high side  but worth it for the quality.  FoodHeads  hope to see you again soon.
FoodHeads,203,Decided to check out this place after using my iphone and the yelp app while I was in the neighborhood.  The place is interesting. It was an old house. They don t have ANY matching tables or chairs...  Food is ok. I wasn t too impressed. The food seems a little overpriced.
FoodHeads,204,Love this place  I wish I had found this spot while I was still a student at UT. Casual  but also trendy.  A big menu selection of sandwiches and salads which are all delicious. I always have a good experience when I come here.
FoodHeads,205,My new favorite sandwich shop in Austin  Texas  Had the Lami and the Squash. Both were delicious   Finished off with a mouth-watering Chocolate Chip Cookie  on the house too  . Great customer service  
FoodHeads,206,Love this place. Has an austin feel and is great for a light or full meal. Chicken special is the most popular and definitely lives up to the hype 
FoodHeads,207,FoodHeads is the best breakfast and lunch spot in Austin  Local  fresh  and delicious 
FoodHeads,208,One of the best sandwich shops in all of Austin. Their specialty sandwich menu changes from time to time. The ingredients are fresh. The sandwiches are inspired.   Tips  They allege no nitrates in their deli meat  which is amazing. Eat up.
FoodHeads,209,Straight to the brain of this FoodHead   This is good stuff for sure.  I ve been here twice in a month and already have my third planned for tomorrow.  The sandwiches are monstrously delicious and very reasonable at under   10   person.    My first visit  I enjoyed a Chicken Caesar Salad Sammy.  I was brought the wrong sandwich  and it was not a big deal at all to get the right one in front me - stat   My coworker had a half pastrami and chicken tortilla soup for the same price.  I will admit that  even though the Caesar was tasty  his looked way better.  Which leads me to...  My second visit  You guessed it   I had the half pastrami and chicken tortilla soup - and  it was pretty incredible.  It doesn t up Little Deli  but the Harry s will always have a special plate in my heart.   I tend to miss the crowd when I visit  so I can t speak to when it gets packed.  But  for a fairly relaxed  hipster  without being saturated by them  vibe  great sandwiches with fresh ingredients  think with your FoodHead next time your North of campus.
FoodHeads,210,Usually I enjoy Foodheads  the ambiance is lovely  like all other reviews mention. It feels like a nice  cozy little Austin deli. Today I went for lunch after a medical appointment  and got the prosciutto  amp  egg salad sandwich  which is about  8 and some change. Was disappointed with what I got.. the bread was toasted hard  I should ve asked them to leave it a bit soft there   but in general it was a sad little sandwich for that price  a slice or two of prosciutto  a couple scoops of egg salad  a few sprouts  an underripe tomato  with a bit of purple onion. I was hoping to enjoy it  but it just didn t come through for me. I wished I had gone down the street to New World Deli instead  which I will probably do next time.
FoodHeads,211,I ve been to FoodHeads three times now...but I d really just like to move in. The building itself just immediately puts me at ease  I love old homes.   Their food is spectacular. All fresh  well-seasoned and delicious. Plenty of seating  inside and out. 6 choices for iced herbal UNSWEET teas everyday  in addition to regular iced tea and lemonade.   Its just such a laid back  relaxing place to eat.
FoodHeads,212,Gypsy Grove and Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin are my favorites   A pretty day in Austin   friend who likes to eat yummy food and pretty places   FoodHeads. Service is great. Once  my group of 7 or 8 people went a little before they closed  so many of the ingredients were out. To show their apology  they gave us 9 giant chocolate chip cookies. AND EVEN THE COOKIES WERE YUMMY. Both outdoor and indoor decor is great. Flowers  cute tablecloths  frames  etc. Food is great. The apple slice on the Tenderloin sandwich adds a fresh  healthy taste to it. The fried egg that comes in the Gypsy Grove can get a little messy  but it s worth the mess   The only con is that it can get tricky to find places to park.
FoodHeads,213,Cool lady boss and I went here for lunch today and we had the Fish Tortaholy hell  It was amazing     Cool little spot with great outdoor seating  great flavored tea and food    Will return again   
FoodHeads,214,One of my favourite lunch sandwich places in Austin.  It is tucked away on 34th street just off guadalupe street in a adorable house.  You can usually find parking in one of the off streets unless you ride your bicycle.    There is outdoor and indoor seating but if its lunch hour and hot outside-there will probably be nowhere to sit inside.  They are best known for their variety of iced teas but their coffee is alright  I mean espresso not standard coffee-it s nasty .    I usually get the sandwich and salad.  Their dressings are delicious for the salads.  You can build your own sandwich which is what I usually do.    They also have wonderful breakfast tacos that you can make with not the usual ingredients.    They are not open on Sundays and close by 3pm everyday.  Don t be one of those people that strolls in at 230 or 3p.
FoodHeads,215,Delicious sandwiches. Among the best in Austin  I would say. The Chicken  amp  Eggplant and the Fish Torta are especially good. Delicious sides. I love the sweet pickles. Cute  light-filled  quirky-but-not-too-quirky atmosphere. The hanging window panes are a nice touch. As is the outdoor succulent shelf.  But  dinner  here is a joke. It s basically like lunch  but with waiter service. Sorry   service.  Both times I ve had dinner here the waitstaff has forgotten about us. They did apologize by giving us free cookies  but it s becoming a pattern. They should just stick to the lunch system of ordering at the counter.
FoodHeads,216,Our office had Foodheads delivered for lunch. Outstanding  Not just the food  but the presentation. The delivery was prompt and everything was in order. The portions are generous - everyone enjoyed it. We will definitely order again 
FoodHeads,217,Pretty good for my first trip I had the spicy Apple pork . The ingredients were really fresh
FoodHeads,218,This is a 3.5. I eat here a few times a month. Their food is tasty  but inconsistent. Maybe it s the rotating cooks or busy lunch hour  Today was the last straw. I ordered two fish tortas. On one the tilapia was burnt and hard. On the other  the fish was under cooked and tastes very  fishy .   Definitely give them a try  the salads are always good and other people seem to enjoy the place. Be prepared to wait a little  during the lunch hour from 12-1.
FoodHeads,219,Great outdoors seating on the porch. Perfect fall afternoon date spot. Love the decor  very quaint and unpretentious.   Had the lami and the roast beef with Brie. The roast beef was very tasty  but the lami was very heavy and greasy.  Preferred the potato salad over the cole slaw  potato salad was very pickly.  Will try again  but was not overly impressed.
FoodHeads,220,I ve only been here once  but I plan on returning.  The place is an adorable little house turned college hipster foodie haven.  The decor is quaint  simple  garage sale-chic and the menu explodes with handcrafted deliciousness. The portions are heaping for the price  Can t stress this enough. I had the smoked salmon bagel and there was about a quarter pound of salmon piled on that plate.  It was a perfectly toasted everything bagel with cream cheese  a heaping mound of fresh smoked salmon  not too fishy  not too smokey   alfalfa sprouts  tomatoes  capers and red onion.   Wham bam thank ya ma am.  Order it.
FoodHeads,221,Trendy Place to Hangout  But The Food Could Easily Be So Much Better  The sandwich portions are small.  The pastrami sandwich is served with about 3 oz of meat and 2 slivers of cabbage  the sour kraut . The menu said it is made with Swiss cheese  but I receive a glob of soft  high butterfat cheese on my sandwich indicating poor attention to details. The butter fat flavor over powers the pastrami. The sandwich is served with an orange  mayo based sauce on the side. The sauce is bland and worse  served at room temp. Given the skimpy portion  at  7.95  my pastrami sandwhich is over priced.  The potato salad and slaw sides are non-descript  i.e.  bland. The potato salad  which is dressed with mayonnaise  is served warm...like it had been sitting out of the refrigerator too long...which any 6th grade home eco student will tell you  is  not cool .  The slaw  which is corsely chopped cabbage and shredded carrots  is also served unrefrigerated. The only flavor I taste on the slaw is salt  it is missing acid. I observe that many patrons agree that the potato salad and slaw are not worth the calories as I see many uneaten portions left on plates.  One of my lunch companions orders the jerk pork sandwich.  The spicy pineapple is the most interesting part of that sandwich.  The black tea lacks tea flavor  and has too much caffeine indicating it is steeped too long and over diluted. The berry tea does have a delicious berry flavor.  The  serve yourself  ice system is unsanitary - I use a huge scoop to fill a 12 oz cup from a plastic bin of ice sitting on a cabinet shelf.  When refilling my drink  it is difficult to add ice without splashing my already sipped from drink into the ice.  Hum  do I really want customers touching the ice during flu   cold season   Doesn t anyone see this issue and have the idea to install a simple gravity fed  self serve ice dispenser  like every other restaurant that offers self serve ice   I wonder what the health inspector says about the unrefrigerated mayo and self serve ice system   I wish Yelp posted links to the Health Dept inspection reports. On second thought  what concerns me more is that the restaurant s operators don t see any issues.
FoodHeads,222,Not sure how I managed to never notice this place considering I lived across the street in that ugly brown apt complex for a summer  but I finally came and tried it.  Grilled Chicken Eggplant sandwich - thoroughly enjoyed it.  I subbed mozzarella for goat cheese because goat cheese is too advanced in the cheese world for me.   My friend got the same thing with goat cheese and said the goat cheese made the sandwich  so if you like goat cheese  sounds like it s for you.  Butternut squash with parmesan soup - DIVINE. I wish I d ordered a gallon rather than a cup. I m not a big fan of sweet soups  so the parmesan really makes the soup.  My only quip is that the chicken was slightly overcooked. Not too dry  but not perfect.  Aside from the food  the place is ridiculously cute. I love when restaurants are small and quaint. Enjoying lunch outside on the porch in sunny 70 degree weather... perfect.
FoodHeads,223,I love coming here for the Tuna Melt sandwich  It is definitely filling for a lunch portion. I also highly suggest getting the Watermelon Gazpacho if you are looking to try something new. It is surprising good. The entree salads are fairly simple and a little over dressed but I would recommend this place if you re looking for a good sandwich. It has a nice Austin feel to it but it may be best to sit outside because gets pretty loud inside when it s busy.
FoodHeads,224,Cute little lunch spot  Been here many times over the last few years and always have a positive experience. Variety of sandwich options  nice ambience  porch seating  amp  picnic tables are perfect on a sunny day   and friendly staff. Highly recommend the Chicken  amp  Eggplant sandwich  the Hot Pastrami sandwich  and their tomato soup.
FoodHeads,225,This place has awesome sandwiches  They are a unique Austin sandwich house and are located in the heart of the UT campus area. I recommend you go on a beautiful sunny day and sit outside for lunch. The prices are reasonable and the food is great. Don t forget it s BYOB 
FoodHeads,226,Service is a touch pretentious - blame it on the part of town. Food is a touch slow to come out - blame it on the pretentious attitude. But whatever - the food is great  Sandwiches are so flavorful and their side of potato salad is so good.   If it wasn t so out of my way I would totally come here more often. It isn t  cheap  about  25 for two sandwiches and one drink. But the sandwiches are satisfying portions. I had the Bella which had mushrooms and some blue cheese and spinach - the bread was soooo good and buttery and delicious. My BF had the pork tenderloin with apples and a mustardy sauce and smoked gruyere. He was in heaven from beginning to end    Take a seat on the patio  enjoy the conversation and wait for your food. Maybe don t come right when you re starved - as we did - because you ll just sit on the patio without any conversation staring at each other hangrily.
FoodHeads,227,If I wrote this review a couple years ago I probably would have laid out only 3 stars  but that s moreso because  hailing from New England  I compare delis and bakeries and  the boug   boulangerie  to sub shops up on the East Coast  which to be quite honest  just cant be beat.  But for a sandwich shop in Austin  despite the city being a self proclaimed food mecca  this place is nearly as good as it gets...and it IS indeed quite good and I ve been back several times. Food Heads understands the delicate art of sandwich ratios  how condiment allocation and amount is directly correlated to thickness of bread for example  and they understand that with deli meats...more is awesome and lots is even friggin  better. Their pastrami and turkey sandwiches hit the spot after a day on the lake  hard workout or just being insatiably hungry.  Be prepared to wait in line if you pop by in the summer  the line will probably be out the door but it s never really unbearable. Their sides are also pretty decent and not just thrown together potatoe salad  simply to say we have it.    As for FoodHeads ambiance  you won t feel like you are surrounded by only fratheads and lululemon sorority sisters  despite its campus close location  Food Heads is a family and group oriented restaurant for all ages and is similar to that of East Side Caf  in its converted house setup. If you re low card  aka  crazy   they ve got substantial salads as well
FoodHeads,228,Never had an bad experience here- food is always on point  I ve been craving this place more since being pregnant  I m sure my baby is smiling after getting a taste of here 
FoodHeads,229,Great little lunch spot  Today was a beautiful sunny day and I sat out on Foodheads porch and had the roast beef and brie sandwich with a side Caesar salad. Service was great  food was delicious  and atmosphere was wonderful.
FoodHeads,230,The most bland food I have ever had in my life. The chicken tortilla soup tastes like water. The sandwich had great fresh ingredients  but just no taste. Bread felt slightly stale. Just really bad.
FoodHeads,231,Dallas definitely needs more places like this  and if anyone in Dallas has tried FoodHeads and knows of a place  please let me know  My brother has literally been recommending this place to me for a year  and I kept wondering how insanely good this place has to be for him to tell me about it all this time. I was finally able to make a trip to this cute  little house-like restaurant and was blown away. The sandwiches were so fresh and so delicious  and the combinations worked so well together. I got the spicy apple pork tenderloin and it was absolutely perfect. I don t even like spicy food and this sandwich was on point. I ve also had bites of the chicken special and this portabello and cheese sandwich  can t find the name of it online . All of them were so good  you really can t go wrong with any sandwich. Definitely putting this place on my  to revisit  list in Austin 
FoodHeads,232,Initially  I was a bit put off by the grunginess of this place. I ordered the salmon salad anyway though - and I m glad I did. The vegetables in the salad were fresh  and the salmon was good too. Plus  the guy working the counter was really nice. I will be returning next time I m in the area.
FoodHeads,233,I m loving Foodheads  It s at such a quaint location tucked a little away from campus in a pleasant neighborhood. The house is absolutely charming  and the staff is very welcoming. I also love the seating in the front porch.    I had the vegetarian squash sandwich which was quite refreshing with its well cooked vegetables and crunchy toasted bread  My friend had the pastrami that surprisingly packed a lot of flavor. I had their pickled cucumbers and onions as well which I expected to be more sour. They were actually really sweet  but I didn t mind. The tea and lemonade both made me feel like I was at home    Overall  a very pleasant lunch experience 
FoodHeads,234,Simple tasty sandwich place. I had the lamb sandwich with eggplant on it. The lamb was pretty chewy and fatty. The eggplant was cut too thick and not quite cook all the way through. I tried the potato salad and the coleslaw both were just ok. The ice for the drink is just in this bucket thing with a scoop beside it but I saw numerous people just dipping their cup into it. That was kinda gross. The ordering process started with a long line and then it felt a tad rushed once you get to the counter. We all paid with cards and some of us were given receipts to sign and some of us were not. So that was weird. I d try it again  but go with something different than the lamb.
FoodHeads,235,I ll start off by saying food heads is a great place to bring your mother too.  Think home is where the hearts is   crotchet inspiration X  a million.  I called in an order for the Tuna melt that they forgot to make.  No big deal.  I waited 5 minutes and the nice girl gave me a free cookie during the wait.
FoodHeads,236,I started coming here 10 years ago. Perfect atmosphere  with the quirky tables and mismatched chairs. They have fresh lemonade  fresh sweet tea. Fresh everything.  I almost always get the chicken caesar sandwich. Do I regret always getting the same thing  NO. If it s good  you get it again. I ve never been disappointed.  They use fresh vegetables grown from their own garden. This place is hard to find  but definitely worth it.
FoodHeads,237,I rave about this place too much to not write a review  Even though I have only been here once  this is almost always the first recommendation I make to friends when asked about great places to eat in Austin.   Food  The menu at FoodHeads is certainly one of a kind. I got the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin  OMG  yummy yummy in my tummy    Apple and tenderloin go so well together  Whoda thunk    Setting  FoodHeads is the epitome of Austin s hipsterness. This little cute cafe definitely has the diner feel. If I didn t know it was a restaurant  I would ve thought it was just someone s house. It s a really chill place to go for an amazing meal  especially with great company.
FoodHeads,238,Food Heads is always a good idea. I ve been twice and have enjoyed my experience both times. It s a great lunch spot with endless sandwich options as well as a salads. I ve tried the gypsy grove and apple pork which were both solid. If you re an egg lover like me  get the gypsy grove. The apple pork might sound weird but the combination of pork  apple  and brie is brilliant. The sauces are just enough and really add an oomph to the sandwiches. All sandwiches come with a side of sliced pickles which adds a nice crunch to your meal. The restaurant itself looks like the inside of a small  quaint home from the decor to the seating. I ve heard great things about the tater tots so I ll definitely be back for those as well as other sandwiches 
FoodHeads,239,I love this place. I started coming here before I even moved to Austin. A cute little house in the Hyde Park area with some of the best sandwiches in town. I take friends and co-workers here pretty frequently  and everyone is always impressed. Don t try to create your own sandwich. Trust that they have put together fabulous combos for you.  Only complaint is that since most of the seating is outdoors  there are a lot of flies  so it would be nice if they would hang the water bags or something to deter them. There s plenty of shade  so even in the middle of an Austin summer  it s still pretty nice to eat outside.  Stop thinking about it  and just go.
FoodHeads,240,This place never disappoints  Excellent quality and reasonable prices. Today I got the roast beef and brie  and it was perfect. Along with the house-made sweet pickles and the homemade lemonade  it was an ideal Saturday lunch 
FoodHeads,241,Stumbled upon this place today  Darling place. Super friendly and fast service. And the squash sandwich was amazing. They were out of mozzarella cheese so I asked for goat cheese and it was so tasty  Honestly this was one of the best foods I ve eaten at a restaurant since moving here from Nor Cal  where there is amazing food galore   I ll be back for sure. Thank you 
FoodHeads,242,Delicious sandwiches  I loved it  So fresh and tasty. I loved the eggplant chicken sandwich  it was warm and comforting. It was also a nice place 
FoodHeads,243,This restaurant is one of the few undiscovered-by-the-crowd places remaining in Austin.  It is a true gem. My favorites are the Eggs  amp  Greens breakfast and the Wild Salmon Salad for lunch or dinner.  All of their sandwiches are among the best in Austin also.
FoodHeads,244,I haven t had a sandwich yet that I don t like. I d recommend trying anything on the menu. The pulled pork is amazing  especially with a glass of the lemonade. Definitely try the lemonade. Prices are totally fair.
FoodHeads,245,Me and two of my co-workers decided to order from here today.  It was an  I buy  you fly  kinda deal.  We had to go pick up  as they don t deliver.  Parking was a nightmare and it took several trips around the block to get a spot.  I had the hot pastrami with potato salad  and  they had the fish torta and pork special with potato salad and slaw.  Let me describe the sandwiches this way.  Imagine  if you will  three grown men sitting in a closed room making moaning and groaning sounds.  It sounded as if we were chowing down on each other as opposed to eating sandwiches    That good people  yes  that good.  As for the potato salad me and friend number one didn t like.  Friend number two liked his slaw.  I guess you could say that this is the sandwich  cafe  shop that can make even the toughest curl his toes   YUMMMMMMMMM   
FoodHeads,246,Cute little place with excellent fresh lunch menu. Friendly staff and very reasonably price.
FoodHeads,247,The food here is so tasty  Whenever I visit Austin  I usually make it a point to go here for lunch. The sandwiches are super yummy  as are the soups  You really can t go wrong.
FoodHeads,248,An old house turned into a restaurant..what   That s exactly what FoodHeads is. They produce gourmet sandwiches which really hit the spot if you re looking for something for lunch that s light and hearty. The dining rooms furniture looks like they picked out the pieces at the goodwill  but that s what makes foodheads unique. I had the spicy apple pork  but I tried my friends lamb sandwich  and by golly I definitely should of ordered that instead.   The only beef I have with them is that when our party sat down on a table after the previous party left  they never bothered to wipe down the table.....
FoodHeads,249,LARD FoodHeads   You are GOOD   DeLIGalious food served by sweet ladies in a comfortable atmosphere that is SO old school Austin that the SXScum hasn t infested it during this season.  The prices are more than fair  so there is ZERO reason not to leave a hefty tip  cause this crew will remember you like a kind aunt who has a hug  amp  a snack waiting as if they KNEW you were going to walk on in.
FoodHeads,250,Tomato coconut soup is delish  Sublime flavors  perfect on even a hot summer day. Squash veggie sandwich a big hit. Apple Pork sandwich was moist and seasoned to perfection. Pickles are addicting with their celery and mustard seed.
FoodHeads,251,If you love lamb you NEED to get the Lamb Sandwich.  The lamb was cut at maybe a quarter inch  but it was enough to make this lunch the best I ve had in a long time.  There is a slight gamy taste to it  but not enough to be repulsive.  I was also a fan of the Spicy Apple Pork Sandwich  which was great as well.  I had to steal a bite from my friend as I heard this was the  go to  sandwich from fellow Yelpers.     In both instances  the meat was tender and juicy.  The ciabatta bread was just right and there is a large selection of cheese to chose from.  The food was a little pricier than most sandwich shops  but you will know why when you take your first bite.  Parking is pretty difficult to find as with many places in Austin and the AC was..well  I don t think they had AC.  Even with those minor setbacks this place definitely deserves a top mention for sandwich joints.  I will be back to enjoy my lamb sandwich again in the near future.  Thank you for the recommendation  Yelp 
FoodHeads,252,I finally ventured into Food Heads this weekend.... hoping for a sandwich that would  rock my socks off . Food heads didn t disappoint..... It was a good sandwich. The best I ve ever had  No.   I don t like crazy dressings.... I like mayo.... PLAIN mayo. So I felt like I was missing something when I skipped all of the fancy mayo they had to offer.   I also am not a huge  veggie   so they looked at me like I was nuts when I asked for the bare minimum on veggies.   I asked the girl behind the counter if I could have my sandwich grilled.... Nope. I really love grilled sandwiches  and FoodHeads could not fill that need. Do they have a grill  Yes. Do they have grilled sandwiches  Yes. Will they grill my sandwich  no.   The bathroom was nasty. I m sorry but I am not reaching into the back of the commode to hit a mystery button labeled  Push me . Yuck. Fix the toilet....  I was less then pleased that they were out of Tortilla Soup  Whole Wheat bread  cups  and tables. We literally had to fight someone for our table    The system they have for taking orders could be improved. The girl who took the orders had to walk to the back every time someone gave her an order..... we waited 15 minutes in line.   While I was in line I had to hear all of the gossip from the large amount of rich UT kids in line..... I hear ya  it must be hard to have everything you want. Yawn.   15 dollars for two sandwich s  two drinks  and a bag of chips  Not ridiculous... but not wicked cheap.   Was the sandwich worth all of that  Kind of..... it was a pretty good sandwich. Was it better than Quiznos  I hate to say it..... but  no. Will I visit again  Yes  because I feel like there is something I am missing.  Will I keep asking myself questions in this review  Looks like it.
FoodHeads,253,Awesome scene. I ve had many a good sandwich here. I m not a big pulled pork fan  so you wouldn t mind me eating that like many of the people here  but they ve got good staple eats and awesome sweet tea. I never know where to sit here because all the options are so cool.   Staff is super friendly and are kind and willing to exchange something if your order comes out wrong.  You get a choice of potato salad or slaw with your sandwich. POTATO SALAD all the way. Nice and fresh  not your over mustard and mayo classic that you find everywhere else. They use new potatoes. Big fan....
FoodHeads,254,This place was a success. My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Saturday  around 7  and it was not busy which was nice. We brought a bottle of wine and sat outside  they had Carla Bruni playing over the speakers - it was just lovely    The food was also well done. My boyfriend had the chicken cassoulet - the chicken was cooked nicely  although in his opinion  the entire dish could have used more flavor . I had the pork with mango chutney and cheddar cheese grits  which I enjoyed overall.  I think a big part was the ambience and unpretentiousness of the whole thing. The food was good  not great   but reasonably priced and the place was fun.  Overall I recommend and will certainly be going back. Need to try their sandwiches 
FoodHeads,255,Foodheads has been catering gourmet lunches for years  however a couple of years ago they began selling soups sandwiches cookies out of their 34th street location.  Foodheads makes everything from scratch with top of the line  fresh ingredients  amp  boy is it good.     Man  this place has the best damn sandwiches in town.  In fact  they have won the Austin Chronicle Critics Choice for the Best Sandwich a couple of times.  I can t believe that I lived around the corner from it for years and didn t know that it existed.    Sandwiches include -   My favorite - the lamb and eggplant sandwich.      the  lami   that combines salami with fresh mozzarella  spinach  tomato and blackberry balsamic vinaigrette on toasted sourdough bread.   a spicy pulled pork sandwich.   a pastromi on light rye.  It is very different from a traditional patromi so light with a wonderful favor.     a sirloin steak sandwich   a salmon caesar   portobello mushroom sandwich   pork tenderloin sandwich   ham and swiss   tuna nicoise  I thought that I d list as many sandwiches as I could remember as the web site is lacking.  it has not been upgraded since FoodHeads opened the 34th street location  when they only were in the catering business   in fact most of the sandwiches at FoodHeads aren t even listed on their web site.  You can either get a full sandwich for  6.75 or  the half sandwich-and-soup combo for  6.50  They also have a number of good soups including a very tasty chicken tortilla  a cream of mushroom as well as a french onion soup.  I had one of the daily special soups the other day - thai beef  yumm.   Salads include - garden  cobb  chicken caesar  and greek.   The cobb salad is awesome  they actually fry some bacon specially for your salad.  They bake serveral different types of cookies everyday.  Their bread is baked daily from up the street at the New World Deli.  In the mornings  they have breakfast tacos  pastries  coffee and espresso.  Foodheads is easy to miss as you are walking up 34th street  look for a big old house with a ton of picnic tables in the front yard.  Most of the seating is outside on picnic tables on either the deck or in the front yard.   If you are driving  you ll need to find a spot on the street but there is tons of parking in the surrounding neighborhood.  BTW - they are basically just a breakfast lunch place.  I think that they are open from about 9AM until 4PM monday thru Saturday.  Sometimes they will close early if business is slow  I ve been turned away a couple of Saturdays at around 3 30PM.  I really like this place.  The only negative thing about this place are sometimes it seems to take an eternity to place your order. Maybe that is the price one pays for when the word gets out on a place with great  food.  EDIT -   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.foodheads.com 2F amp s d9e0d684ad8ec6416af44eabdd1559af9fed21a524dc502352fb517c741aca6c  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  foodheads.com  a   has been updated since I originally wrote this review so check out all of the wonderful sandwiches there.  BTW - I noticed that they sight some  citysearch awards that they have won  maybe yelp needs some similar awards 
FoodHeads,256,Food - 4 5 Service - 4 5 Price - 3 5 Atmosphere - 4 5  Best Dish  Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin  Foodheads is a place that takes the  Keep Austin Weird  saying to heart. None of the tables and chairs match  but boy do they make great gourmet sandwiches. I would suggest that you dine here at least two or three times before making a final judgment  there are just so many quality sandwiches to choose from.
FoodHeads,257,The look and feel of this place is pretty cool.  A bit hipster-ish  but pretty cozy overall.    The food was hit and miss.  The big hit was the Gypsy something-or-other sandwich.  That shit was pretty damn good.   The misses were pretty much everything else.  Bland tater salad  according to Wife   bland coleslaw  according to me   and a Pastrami on Rye that absolutely pales in comparison to the one at Little Deli  according to both of us .    I d go back here for the Gypsy something-or-other sandwich  but that s pretty much it.
FoodHeads,258,Yummy sandwiches  great patio  friendly owner. Really enjoyed the salami sandwich and the zucchini one  very tasty 
FoodHeads,259,Look I love the food and was set on giving it 4 stars until something happened.  Stay tuned.  First  the food.  Went today with the wife and sister in law.    wifey   pulled pork sandwich   pork was a little dry for my taste but she got it with frank s hot sauce on the side so i ll let it slide.   the pulled pork is good.  the ciabatta it came on was fresh.  SIL   she got the roast brief and brie and gave me half.  it s good.  the roast beef was dry but flavorful.  i ended up dipping it in my wife s hot sauce  which she got on the side .    me   i got the spicy apple  which is a pork loin with apple relish and smoked gouda and gave half to the SIL.  really good.  the pork loin is grilled just right   moist  flavorful  tender.  very good.   the honey dijon is the perfect condiment compliment.  i m convinced nothing else in the world would go as well as the honey dijon.     so why one star   well after eating i went to wash my hands.  knocked on the door to their single bathroom and someone was in there.  i heard a flush and almost simultaneously the handle turned and the door opened.  i did a robotic turn from the waist up in half disbelief as my eyes tracked the non-hand washing man in blue walk into the kitchen.  my head snapped back around to confirm yes  the water in the toilet was still running.  the employee had not washed his hands.  sick.     i don t know if he washed his hands in the kitchen before returning to work.  i do know what i witnessed.  despite the food being really good it s enough to turn me off to foodheads forever.
FoodHeads,260,Sometimes  my buddy Karla May and I get stuck and can t figure out what we want for lunch. There are all these places we think of when we know exactly what we want and we say   We should go there next time we get stuck.  Today was one of those days  but since both of us are idiots we never write these things down and have to scour Yelp  Chow and FoodHawk to try and remember.  Thanks to Yelp  today we remembered FoodHeads. We kind of screamed it actually. To each other. Much to the dismay of the Legal Team who sit right next to us.   So we jumped in the car and headed up Lamar to FoodHeads. The sandwich combinations sounded amazing and I couldn t decide. I had seen recs here for the roast beef and brie and the lamb and eggplant  but I ended up going with the pastrami. It was really good  pastrami  brown mustard  swiss  and sour slaw on rye. The bread was lightly toasted but still soft  how d they do that  The homemade pickles that came with it were good too.  Karla May had the chicken and eggplant and declared it delicious. She also had a green salad that was beautiful. Bright red tomatoes and walnuts   I also had a cup of the roasted onion soup. I expected it to be on the order of french onion  but it was a bit different  more of a spring onion  Lots of onions  but also tomatoes and shredded carrots. I had to doctor it up with tabasco and salt and pepper to give it some flavor.  Still  FoodHeads kind of rocks. The atmosphere is really cute and it was such a pretty day that sitting outside was awesome. I ll definitely be back  but not soon because it took me 20 freakin  minutes from the time I entered the parking garage at work to get to my parking spot on the second level.   Seriously.   20. Freaking. Minutes.
FoodHeads,261,Not feeling it.  20 for two people to eat a sandwich  And mine was missing a crucial element -- Flavor.  I suspect I may give  em another try. The basic ingredients were there. It just didn t come together in any appreciable way. For now..I m classifying this one as the latest yuppy  trendy  rip-off. Stay tuned.
FoodHeads,262,It s pretty difficult to screw up a vegetable sandwich.  I mean  get bread. cut bread. put vegetables inside bread.  done.  I ordered the Roasted Veggies with olives Baked Sandwich  minus the melty cheese.  Fresh focaccia bread  it was okay.   Roasted vegetables  they were okay.  Roasted red pepper tomato sauce  genius  but not enough.    After I read the super awesome reviews of this place  I jet over  expecting to be blown away by the most wonderful sandwich ever.  Eh  not so much.  FoodHeads is a little place with bad parking  and an overpriced menu.  The meat eater got the Don breakfast taco  and the pulled pork  amp  eggs breakfast taco.  He said both were just awful  dry gross eggs  and a huge disappointment  especially the Don.  Bad eggs  where is the sirloin   no feta anywhere  and mushrooms were slimy.    So  he won t go back.  I want FoodHeads to serve that roasted red pepper sauce with a side of little toasty bread.  Now  that would be the shit.
FoodHeads,263,This place made me rethink my statement  Fricano s is definitely the best sandwich shop near campus . My consensus is that it really depends on what kind of sandwich you re looking for.   I really enjoyed the pork loin special  came with apples  pork  amazing combo btw  and some awesome sauce. Also came with a side of coleslaw that is probably the 2nd best coleslaw I ve ever had  2nd to Salt Lick   I can t wait to go back and try all the other sandwiches. Nice outdoor patio too on a nice day.
FoodHeads,264,Maybe its all the hype this place has gotten that made me have pretty high expectations  but I can say I was sorely disappointed in Food Heads.   Let s start with the entrance. OK this place is one of those  once a cute house now turned resto  kinda joints  so it had stairs leading to the main entrance. Now explain to me why  on a busy Sunday during the lunch rush  would you have a dude re-cementing the steps. Due to this  we had to dodge the swinging shovel  zig zag through the outdoor dining tables  and make our way around to the side entrance. Ugh... signs would have helped.   Once in  we were thrown into a line that seemed to meander through the tables and was constantly being redirected by the food runners as they made their way around the cramped spaces. I def think this system could be improved on.   Ordering went somewhat smoothly - and everything came out correctly  so kudos for that.   As far as seating  forget about it  If you are a party of 2 or 4  you won t have trouble  but anything larger than that  and we were 7  - good luck  However  there is an old school charm with the mismatched tables and chairs and with the waitresses aprons. Def cute    Now with the food... I don t understand what all the rave was about. The only sandwich I thought was worth mentioning was the Gypsy Grove - def a must get. Unfortunately I did not get that  but I tried it and it was very flavorful. The pork was fully seasoned and the baguette it was served on went perfectly with the sauce and meat. I had the fish tacos. They were so salty and over grilled. The Salmon Sandwich was the same  It was too salty and so soggy that the bread fell apart while trying to eat it.   As far as beverages were concerned  they had a good selection of teas and their home made lemonade was very good. Boo on not really having ice in the ice machine though. Don t they know Southerners love ice in their teas     Anyway  was Food Heads worth a try  Yes  Would I go there again  Not in a good while
FoodHeads,265,Really unbelievable sandwiches  worth every penny. Got addicted a few years back to the pork tenderloin with gouda  amp  apples  and could NOT order anything else for the longest time  but finally broke out and have tried the roast beef with bleu cheese and at least one other. Haven t had anything that wasn t killer yet   Also have a fantastic ginormous chocolate chip cookie  the size of a saucer   which I ordinarily cannot pass up either. Gah. Now my stomach s rumbling.
FoodHeads,266,A wonderful little place to go for brunch lunch.  I have gone here with quite a few friends and it s always been a good choice. Convenient part of town  for me  at least   cute setting  authentic sandwiches  all of which I have been pleased with   and overall good food.   Can get really busy  But I think that s a good sign for them.
FoodHeads,267,I have read more than one review on here that confirmed my exact experience. At first I thought maybe it was my imagination but sure enough  as several people have mentioned....the service. Food is great  I ve had the pastrami and tuna melt and both are good. The tuna melt needs to be ordered with light Dijon for sure. BUT there is one one woman at the counter that is unbelievably rude. Today as she took my order she was so unhelpful and visibly agitated to wait on us at the counter. She stared at me blankly like I was speaking another language as I ordered and when my husband asked a  simple question about a special she snarkily answered   the description is written on the board sir ...it was hidden off to the side  not beneath the sandwich name like the rest.   She honestly ruined the experience and I was tempted to ask for my money back to just leave. I served for many years so I know when someone is  busy or just a complete bi   .....Other than that this place is definitely worth a try 
FoodHeads,268,Cool and quaint little sandwich place.  I read other reviews on Yelp and ended up stopping in for lunch the other day.  The CHICKEN  amp  EGGPLANT sandwich was delicious.  I was really happy that I ended up stopping by and will surely be back again.
FoodHeads,269,The Good       location. it s located in hyde park so it s great for students and residents of hyde park.      cute place. the interior is so cozy  the exterior has plenty of seating  both covered and not. big tables so you can actually have room to eat and work on the crossword puzzle       very friendly service. people are always pleasant.      awesome homemade lemonade.       awesome iced tea      awesome caffe latte.       delicious coleslaw. comes with each sandwich order. perfectly made and balanced with the right amount of mayonnaise      delicious sandwiches. big portions and equally balanced portions of meats and fixins.        delicious soups. try their cream of mushroom soup. it s very spicy  lots of pepper  and not overly creamy       delicious breakfast tacos. the salsa that comes with it is very fresh tasting  so i think they make that in-house too.  all the fixins are delicious. try a breakfast taco with bacon  egg  and cheese. delish         they allow dogs on their patio. nice       affordable prices. breakfast tacos are only i think about  1.65  sandwiches are about  7   The Bad       they aren t open on sundays. booooooooooo      they can sometimes put too much of the creamy sauce in their sandwiches. the sauce is really good but you can have too much of a good thing. to remedy this  just ask them to put the sauce in a container on the side   The Ugly       none.  Would I go back   Definitely.  I try to make it a regular outing on my weekend mornings.  Nothing beats walking the dog over to Foodheads  getting a paper  and working on a crossword puzzle over a hot cup of coffee on a cool patio with birds chirping.  This place is IN.
FoodHeads,270,Freshness is the M.O. here as you won t find too many Sysco boxes out back. From the lemonade to the soups to the mustard  you get a sense these guys like to put a little hyde park soul in each bite. About 20  more expensive than thunder-C  but 50  tastier. And they serve Zapp s - which is an automatic  1 star. All packed in a fantastic turn-o-the-century  house with a porch made for reading and people watching.
FoodHeads,271,While Foodheads fails to deliver on its name  where s the Goat Head Soup    it s definitely one of the better sandwich shops in town.  Great vibe both inside the restaurant  a converted house  and on the patio.  The one 5-star sandwich I ve had there is the chicken and eggplant sandwich with goat cheese.  Fantastic sandwich   It s like chicken and eggplant becoming friends Tom-and-Jerry style after all the bickering caused by the question of  What s better in a parmigiana sub  .  I ve tried a few other sandwiches  like the Apple Pork Tenderloin  and they re very good but not great - hence the 4 stars.  Love the Zapp s chips selection  tobasco flavored rocks .  I also like the iced tea options - there s always something interesting like a wild blueberry iced tea.  It s so good that it makes me feel bad for Arnold Palmer-ing my iced tea.  So I love ya Foodheads but Fricano s still wears the Austin sandwich crown.
FoodHeads,272,I eat here occasionally. They are a little bit pricey  but their sandwiches are very unique and tasty. This is among my favorite places in Austin for a sandwich.  They have lots of very creative sandwiches  or you can create your own with their wide array of special sauces  all of which are very good. I specifically like the  Zippy mustard  and  elephant mayo.  They have a nice half sandwich half soup option  which works out very well if you crave more variety than most sandwich places offer.  I strongly recommend that you ask for Potato Salad with your sandwich. By default  it comes with slaw  but the slaw is very much outdone by its nemesis potato salad in the world of FoodHeads.  Their teas are always interesting. I recommend them as well. The menu can be a little scary  but really its hard to find something bad here. Go  you will enjoy.
FoodHeads,273,I tell ya what wow. I am not even a sandwich person but I crave Foodheads sandwiches. I most often think of foodheads when I have just spent days eating lots of fast food and crappy stuff and just feel saturated in fat and really want a refreshing change  something with good ingredients and that won t make me feel terrible afterwards. Thats when I think Foodheads  unfortunately that is soooo often on a sunday     Anyway  I was finally feeling like this on a saturday and was able to go  I ordered the pork special which had pork loin  bacon  and pineapple relish. Everything went so well together. And I usually dont like pineapple in savory stuff  especially pizza   but pork goes sooo well with sweet things  am I right   Anyway it was a perfectly made sandwich.   I have also tried a few others like the salami and mozzarella and the chicken and eggplant and and am convinced that you really cant go wrong. The side of potato salad is also pretty guilt-free because it s a vinegar based potato salad. Also the home made pickles are good. A little sweet for my taste  but good. The outdoor seating is lovely if the weather is nice and they re selection of bottled sodas is excellent.   You will always leave here feeling better about yourself and thats why I like it.
FoodHeads,274,Oh. My. Gawd.   I am a complete sandwich freak. In fact  I would eat sandwiches every meal of every day if I could  save for pizza and tex-mex . Most days I skip breakfast so I can eat an early sandwich lunch at 11.   Okay  anyway  point being  the sandwich I had at Foodheads is the best I ve had in Austin. Now let me say that I m a veg. So  this is purely based on the bread  condiments  and veggies  no meat . I got the build your own veggie sandwich on whole wheat bread. It comes with home made hummus  and wide variety of fixings. I got lettuce  tomato  cucs  sprouts  shredded carrots  green peppers  and roasted potatoes. They also have roasted sweet potatoes and other roasted veggies that AREN T MUSHY  YAY  It was amazing.  They have decent service  typical Austin  although the dude at the counter seemed like a newbie. He seemed annoyed as I rattled off my long list of veggies. Great location  but parking can be a bit of a pain. The shop is an old house which adds to the ambiance.   Now the bad points. The hours are horrible  and they aren t open on Sundays. Augh. WHY  This is the bane of my existence. None of the sandwich shops I love are open on Sundays  Grrrrrr. As other yelpers point out  be sure to get there early in the afternoon because they close early...  Oh yeah  I m NOT a fan of their icebox pickle thingies. But  I m from NY and have never heard of such a thing. So  perhaps I m being unfair.
FoodHeads,275,It is difficult to find a good deli in Austin  let alone one that offers healthier options. This place checks most of the boxes for me. I ordered the fish tacos  expecting a lot less than what I got  i.e. two huge pieces of blackened fresh-tasting tilapia on top of a well-made slaw. The only things I was not as happy about  long the line to the  one  register  the unnecessarily-large table sizes  and the limited hours of operation.
FoodHeads,276,I go to Food Heads for one thing and one thing only  the Gypsy Grove sandwich.  Decadence on a bun.  Marinated and grilled pork tenderloin  topped with grilled ham  topped with melted swiss cheese  topped with a fried egg  still gooey yolk  topped with jalapeno relish  which is basically a spicy russian dressing.  All of this on a perfectly crunchy crusted baguette.  Oh yeah  they give like a little thing of cole slaw to go with it.  The sandwich is  admittedly  a heart attach on a baguette  but whatever  right   You can wash down your guilt with an ample selection of iced teas  or  if you want to further the guilt  they have the real deal Mexican Coke and the real deal Texan Dr. Pepper.  Oh yeah  their other sandwiches are pretty good too.  Having been on a  health  kick of sorts this year  I opted for their salmon salad sandwich.  Nothing to write home about  but it was a solid sandwich.  The grilled salami and mozarella is  however  worth writing about.  But  come on  its mozarella and salami--what can go wrong   Simple pairing  and yet you don t really see it too often.  There other sandwich offerings  based upon my sneaking bites from dining companions  are all solid across the board.  I can t really think of a better sandwich place in town.  Their soups are ok.  Chicken tortilla has been good  the french onion a disaster  someone started salting it and salted and salted .    FoodHeads is in one of those  cute  houses on 34th street  which  despite the ugly apartment complex across the street  the vacant lot which will eventually become a monstrosity of a condo complex  and the weird green office building next door  retains some degree of quaintness.  There s outdoor seating  and this is probably the time of year you want to take advantage of that.
FoodHeads,277,I was overwhelmed my the menu  everything sounded really good  and i assume it all is. FoodHeads is in a little house-like building with a bunch of mismatched furniture. I usually dont like places with counter service  i dont know why   but i didnt mind it at all there. I sat inside  but the outdoor seating looked like it would be enjoyable if it weren t so hot. They offered a variety of tea  so  i guess if i drank tea i would be excited about that. I ended up going the make your own sandwich route  I got so freaked out by all the options i had them put mustard  one of around 10 different mustards  on my tuna  which ended up being delicious.   I feel the coleslaw was so spectacular it deserves to be separated from the rest of this review. This place could serve only slaw and still get five stars  i nearly shrieked in disbelief when i tasted it  thats right... shrieked.  I forgot to check if they serve alcohol when i was there. If they do im going back for dinner.  FoodHeads rips other sandwich places new assholes  not all of them  but most of them at least.
FoodHeads,278,4.5 stars  Great yummy sandwiches with good variety of choices for the veggie head or meat lover in you. I used to go here often in my UT college days  sigh...i miss my youth  and is in walking distance if your in the campus area  Fair amount of indoor and outdoor seating but can be crowded during lunch easily.  The only thing keeping it from being five stars is that its often slow...even if they are not that busy and worse when they are busy  Bottom-Line  great place to grab lunch when you ve got more than an hour to kill
FoodHeads,279,So many places do sandwiches incorrectly these days that when I find a restaurant that makes a decent sandwich I m super sold. FoodHeads went above and beyond my expectations.   The food is really fresh and they have at least a milli teas to choose from.  Ok...there are 8  give or take 2 .   I also enjoy non-awkward social situations and FoodHeads offers the opportunity for exactly that. Sit  talk and eat without being disturbed or ignored. Wonderful.  Parking if you re commuting can be a bit of a drag  though.
FoodHeads,280,UPDATE 1 29 2008   I wanted to up the rating to 5 stars because the service has been much better the last few times I ve gone by.  However  I m going to leave it the same because they ve upped the prices on their sandwiches.  The Gypsy Grove used to be  6.50 and I went in the other day and price went up  2.  I still love the place but I m going to have to stop going by as often.   8.50 for a sandwich without a drink   A little pricey if you ask me.                                                                            Fantastic sandwiches all around.  I ve tried at least 5 different sandwiches and not one has disappointed me so far.  Good atmosphere and perfect to take out-of-towners to for an Austin type restaurant.  My only complaint is that the service is lacking at times.  Very slow also.  I ve waited for more than 5 minutes on several different occasions without so much as anyone noticing I m there.  This is with no one in line.  That was a bit disappointing.  However  the food makes up for it.  I guess all good things are worth a sacrifice 
FoodHeads,281,Definitely a contendor for best sandwich place in Austin. There is a selection of veggie and meat options and they are all well made with quality ingredients. Aside from the crazy good food  the ambiance is quite lovely. It is a home that was turned into a restaurant  there is seating inside and outside.  TIP  Pick up a sandwich punch card 
FoodHeads,282,You know  I work nearby this place and I didn t even know that it existed until Corinne s review popped up on my screen   I came here with Steve N. and John E. for John s last lunch in Austin and I was not disappointed.  Of course  I did have little complaints here and there  but nothing too substantial to decrease my star rating.  I went with a build your own half sandwich combo  with split pea soup.  It was all quite tasty  I must say.  My sandwich was pretty basic  turkey with provolone  lettuce  tomato  plain mayo  and dijon mustard on whole wheat bread.  The other soups that I sampled were pretty tasty  as well  especially the sweet potato curry   The atmosphere was incredibly laid back  with a very Austin feel...something I really love about this city.  It seems as if this place used to be a house  then turned into a wonderful sandwich dining experience   Parking was sort of difficult  I parked almost a block away...I can t imagine how terrible it would ve been a little later on  when the lunch rush arrived   My only other complaint was that the bread-to-insides ratio of my sandwich was pretty poor...too little bread.  I may have perhaps made a bread faux pas with my selection of plain wheat.  And it s not like the sandwich was stuffed with ingredients  there was just too little bread to keep a handle on everything   Now that I know about this place  and it is so close to work...I ll be a frequent customer         EDIT       Came back today 2 1 08  in anticipation of yummy soup  I m working on a terrible cold flu some weird bug .  Yes  the soup was yummy  I had the winter tomato.  I ordered a salad as well  with Blackberry Balsalmic dressing.  The dressing was WAY overwhelming and the salad itself had little to no nutritional value.  Pretty much amounted to a mound of iceberg lettuce and a couple different kinds of veggies.  The nutritional part came from tomatoes and sprouts.  I had to drop my rating by one star for the experience today.
FoodHeads,283,Yes. and Yes. Double yes.   This place is awesome. I always forget how awesome it is because it is only open for breakie and lunch.   Stay open for dinner. Let me eat your veggie sandwhich all of the time    My only other qualm is with the togo vinegarette. Too much oil. The ratio of Balsamic to oil is off. Otherwise everything is amazing. Drool  wipe  chomp repeat.
FoodHeads,284,Fast and fresh. Do try the Garlic  amp  Herb Roasted Leg of Lamb. Perfect flavor combination. I could eat a bowl of their pickles.   Pass on the Roasted Onion soup. It was very bland and not very hot.  Wash it all down with freshly squeezed lemonade. Just like mom used to make you sell on the side of the street to help pay for her shopping addiction. Manolo Blahnik s don t grow on trees  But lemons do...
FoodHeads,285,We went to food heads on a Thursday afternoon for a late lunch. The restaurant was at about 70  capacity  so we had no problem finding a table on the porch to enjoy the beautiful weather  The sandwiches were quite tasty and the portions were more than generous. I would give the food 3.5 stars  but my lady companion gave it 5 stars.   I had a great experience and will definitely be frequenting this establishment.
FoodHeads,286,I am SO pleased with this establishment. An absolutely perfect place for lunch with friends.  This location boasts a quirky  welcoming exterior and a unique menu. I would suggest anything  it is just THAT good  They offer a lunch special  1 2 with  amp  soup  for only a few of the sandwiches  but I personally enjoy the chicken and eggplant.  Seating outside was very comfortable and there was lots a room. Bigger parties would probably be easiest set outside due to limited space inside.  Especially during peak times  
FoodHeads,287,Amazing  I ve lived here two years and this place has been on my  Austin Bucket List  for quite some time. I finally made it out and let me tell you it absolutely lived up to the hype. The Fish Torta took me back to my Hispanic roots. It was full of flavor  crisp  and just awesome all around. The ambience here is calm  peaceful  and inviting. It feels like you re visiting an old friend. My in laws from good ol  Mexico will be visiting us this week. I m anxious to see their reaction when I bring them here. Hopefully I ll be lucky enough to get a pat on the back from my father in law. Those gestures from him are hard to come by.
FoodHeads,288,These are the best sandwiches I have ever had. When I discovered the place over the summer  I went there like 4 times a week  until I realized it was  20 for two people to eat.. and that adds up pretty quick when you go everyday    But the sandwiches are really unique  I love the roast beef and brie  and the zucchini is really good too. The soups are all really good too. I have yet to try the salads.. but im going to go ahead and assume they are amazing also 
FoodHeads,289,I am in love all over again. I went to FoodHeads again today and was wowed all over again.   I have had two absolutely delicious sandwiches here.  Today I had the grilled eggplant sandwich without the chicken and it was almost too much deliciousness without the chicken  so I can t imagine what it would have been like with chicken. It came with pesto  a delicious balsamic vinaigrette  and goat cheese. It was heavenly. Plus  it was on some delicious multi-grain bread that had sunflower seeds. Yummy  I love a good multi-grain bread.   I really like how they have the tables set up.  The tables are big and meant for sharing  This means you can sit next to total strangers eating your lunch.  I like that.   I also really like their coleslaw.  There are many things that can go wrong with coleslaw - too much mayo  not enough mayo  too salty  too sweet  etc.  But this coleslaw avoids all of these pitfalls and is just wonderful. It s both sweet and savory  but not too sweet or savory. It almost tastes like there is some garlic in there. It s just delicious. Even my friend who does not like mayo liked it. Now that s saying something   The parking is a situation - there is not much of it. I ve had to walk a couple blocks during the lunch rush for a sandwich.    But the parking is really my only complaint.
FoodHeads,290,Once upon a time  I died and went to Sandwich Heaven. I do not believe it is possible for Foodheads to make bad food. As I write this I am even tempted to try something of theirs with mushrooms on it  and I am FIRMLY AGAINST mushrooms. The Baked Sandwich with veggies and green olives is one of my faves with warm sweet potato  eggplant  and squash with slightly spicy olive spread. I m starting to salivate just thinking about it.   I m surprised at other reviews of poor bitchy service because I ve been here several times during lunch rush and never encountered anyone who was less than pleasant.
FoodHeads,291,I ve been eating here for years and it s still one of my favorite spots in Austin. A cute little house turned into a sandwich shop that s BYOB...what s not to love  My favorite is the Gypsy Grove. I ve branched out and tried others like The Chicken Special and the Fish Torta but I always go back to the Gypsy Grove. Oh and ask for the potato salad it goes great with any sandwich 
FoodHeads,292, Shut up and eat   That s what I told myself on my first trip to FoodHeads. A friend and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon and had a lot of business stuff to catch up on. The only problem is that I was having a hard time keeping the Fish Tacos out of my mouth long enough to get a word in. Ultimately I decided to wait until after the meal  since the fish tacos shouldn t have to wait.  The tacos were amazing  the potato salad just right  and the sweet tea was the icing on the cake.  My favorite thing about Foodheads aside from the food  The fact that its only 3 blocks from my condo.
FoodHeads,293,I went Monday for a late lunch after dropping off my car for service.  It was dreary and cold  and I was craving a good  warm yummy sammich.  Luckily I remembered all the great reviews of FoodHeads from yelp and I was in the neighborhood.  I immediately went for the Lamb and Eggplant sandwich that I heard so much about.  My boyfriend wanted the  Pulled Pork  but aww it was sold out for the day  and he settled with the Roast Beef and Brie.  Both sandwiches were sooo good   Thanks Yelp   The ingredients and bread that were unique to each sandwich perfectly meshed and complimented each other.  You could definitely taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients.  The Roast Beef  amp  Brie - plenty of great high quality roast beef  large chunks of brie  they definitely didn t skimp  - well worth the price.  The Lamb with Eggplant  feta   amp  cucumber mayo was so juicy it dripped. Quite tasty and filling.  Very comforting. Comfort sandwich Yay     Great plus   Zapp s chips in all their varieties.  And a selection of 6 home-brewed ice tea  black  green  sweet tea  rooibos  herbal  wow    Definitely will be back to try all the other Specialty Sandwiches.
FoodHeads,294,Austin at it s best      Cooks are passionate about the food and everyone is nice. Just ask for basically anything and it s yours.   Good food  great people  good atmosphere 
FoodHeads,295,I can t believe we ve been here for two years and just now got around to trying FoodHeads. The eatery is so comfortable with lots of picnic tables parked in the sunny front yard. And the converted house is charming. It feels like stopping by a friend s house for a sandwich and soda.   The salmon salad sandwich was really tasty. It was creamy and crunchy  loaded with tart apples and tangy cucumber mayo. BF had the prosciutto egg salad  which was also very good  nutty multi-grain bread hugging crumbly yolks and salty ham.   I m kind of sad we re moving in two months. I would have made this a regular Saturday lunch spot.
FoodHeads,296,Maybe I m just a sandwich type of gal  but the  gourmet  sandwiches are just alright.  Had the Spicy Apple Pork sandwich and the Spicy jerky sandwich. I liked the spicy jerky more. Both were okay  but I wouldn t go back and pay  9 for a sandwich.  The environment is total hipster...I can see why it s popular.
FoodHeads,297,FoodHeads is probably the cutest little house-turned-restaurant I ve seen here in Austin. I love the colors  the patio  the small vase of flowers on each table  and glass bottle they use to serve water. That last aspect reminded me of my travels in Italy and France.   The chocolate chip cookies are really good  and the second time I went they were out  sadly  so  if possible  save some room for dessert  . When I came here the other day I ordered the fish tacos with icebox pickles on the side. The icebox pickles came with a few onions and red peppers--I wish I had put them on my tacos though because they tasted a little bland. The corn tortillas were great  though  My friend got the steak and arugula salad and said she remembered it being better the previous time she got it so maybe they ve altered that recipe. I ve also tried the chicken and eggplant sandwich but I remember at the time I wished I had asked for no goat cheese because it was just a little too much for me. The tomato soup is amazing   The service here is friendly and helpful  and even though it s a bit pricey I think you get your money s worth here. I ll definitely be back when I ve got a big enough appetite 
FoodHeads,298,Hands down  my favorite sandwich shop.  To begin with  the building itself is awesome. It is an old house remodeled into a restaurant with all sorts of old tables and chairs for diners to seat themselves in. It is a pay at the counter establishment with a super friendly staff.  They sandwiches themselves are great. They are fresh and made with quality ingredients. My favorite is the roasted lamb and the salami with mozzarella. Yum. Also not to be missed is their french onion soup.  They have a few options for sandwiches  you can either get a whole sandwich which is served with delicious slaw or pickles  or not as delicious potato salad  or you can opt for some of their half sandwich options if you aren t feeling so hungry.  Located in a great place between guadalupe and lamar even the street parking is not too difficult.   All in all  a great place for lunch
FoodHeads,299,I love to say I m a Foodie and anytime I get a chance to try an new place I take it.  This was off the hook on so many different levels   Fresh Fresh Fresh ingredients  friendly service  unique location and the food itself was amazing.  This is defiantly a place you want to go on a beautiful day to sit out on the deck or one of their outdoor tables.  Cant wait to get back here again soon            Happy Foodie Adventures    
FoodHeads,300,Very close to 4 stars  but I had to knock 1 star off because of the selection of bread. I feel the selection of bread size  density  kind  is one of the most important components of a sandwich. The toasted banquette used in the pork sandwich  was too thick in my opinion. It was so big in fact  I ended up taking the top portion of the bread and just eating the bottom. The other components were spectacular. The pork was cooked to perfection. It was very tender and so succulent.  It didn t taste reheated  but rather cooked right before going onto the sandwich. The restaurant had a cozy home feel to it  and probably the case because it looked like a old house converted to a restaurant.
FoodHeads,301,This place makes a meeeeeaaan sandwich  and I mean that in only the best way.  Their lamb  amp  eggplant sandwich is one of my favorites in town  as is their salmon salad sandwich.  And there s nothing like a bag of Zapps chips to make a sandwich taste even better - they ve got those  too  including the less run-of-the-mill varieties like salt  amp  vinegar and cracked black pepper .  Or  if you re feeling healthy  you can forego the chips and satisfy your crunchy cravings with their amazing coleslaw.    The atmosphere is very casual and funky  in an old house with wood floors and built-in bookshelves.  The seating options could be better - I think pretty much every time I go  I have to troll around to find an extra chair for whatever table my group ends up choosing - but that s a small price to pay for a great  quick meal.  Added bonus   they have a fair amount of outdoor seating  so you can enjoy your meal outside if the weather is cooperating.  Perfect.
FoodHeads,302,One of my new faves for a fresh sandwich.  I ve been there twice.  Once I had the  Lami ...a gourmet twist on a fried baloney sandwich.  Delicious.   Today I had the  Bella  which is portabello mushrooms with blue cheese on toasted sourdough.  Very good.  Plus  the homemade pickles are worth the trip   They were playing a Paul Simon album and the shelves were stacked with old cookbooks and copies of  Saveur  magazine.  Very cozy.   Try the homemade lemonade 
FoodHeads,303,I ve wanted to try this place for so long.... and finally did a couple weeks ago     Okay first things first  I really debated if I wanted to give this place a 3 or a 4  and I was definitely leaning towards a 3 until I changed my mind. But I ll explain why in a bit.  This place is super cute  I love the atmosphere and the decor and whatnot. Really nice employees too  always a bonus. Parking can be a hit or miss  luckily when I went there was plenty of street parking. They have a lot available also but it s only from certain times on certain days.  Off of several Yelp reviews  suggestion  I tried the apple pork sandwich. Oh... my goodness... I did NOT regret it. It was soooo good. That pork tenderloin was perfection... It was a beautiful  amazing sandwich.  But then I kept eating.  And then it was gone   Why so fast  Because for  9 I expected something huge like Fricano s equally-priced sandwiches are  But this was only a liiiittle bigger than any ol  regular sandwich you can put together with store bought sliced bread.  As delish as that sandwich was  and it was REALLY delish .. I just cannot see myself being willing to frequent this place when there are just-as-good sandwich places where I can get more bang for my buck.  But since the food really was good  I decided I ll bump it to a 4. Just know you re paying a lot for a not-so-proportionally-portioned-but-delicious sandwich.
FoodHeads,304,Funky Austin at it best. Menu keeps up with seasonal changes  but the place stays true to it s roots. Not a big soup eater  but can not help myself when I come in here  just got to have the chicken tortilla soup  it s sooo good. Only open Mon-Fri until 3 30   That s P.M. Not A.M   Sat. closing time varies  but still early. so don t expect to stop in after your last bar closes.  The good news is stone cold sober  the food is great  service friendly  and you get to remember where to send your friends for an Austin experience.  For all you non-carnivores they have a wide enough selection of vegitarian you won t feel slighted.  Check the daily specials on the board  easier than being forced to decided between so many mouth watering choices on the menu.  Enjoy
FoodHeads,305,FoodHeads delivers on the key things that make for a good sandwich.  A solid portion of good quality meats  or veggies if you prefer  on nice fresh bread.  The cheese and the veggies are also good compliments to the flavor.  I m not a big soup guy  but my wife usually accompanies her sandiwch with a cup and it always has been a hit.  Their sides are mostly  if not all  homemade and delicious although your ticket can add up fast here if you go crazy.  Adding onto the quality is a really nice place to sit down and eat  set in an older house with antique style tables and chairs.  Seating inside can fill up quick  but we ve never not gotten a table.  Sometimes it s easier to go find a five dollar footlong  but FoodHeads is worth the extra couple of bucks.
FoodHeads,306,This was a place that I used to frequent because they have so many delicious options - something for everyone. Some of my favorites  Salmon bagel  tuna melt  beef  amp  brie  and eggplant mozzarella. They also have breakfast options like tacos and breakfast sandwiches 
FoodHeads,307,The tuna nicoise and thai soup make for a mightyfine lunch   Also thought the french onion and grilled portabella sandwich were marvelous. Pulled pork sandwich a bit too tabascoey for me  but the included  thinly sliced cucumber was a nice touch   Love love love the racks of old cooking magazines. Saveur faire  Harhar..
FoodHeads,308,Really great coconut cup cakes    Egg salad sandwich was great  could have been better if the eggs were room temperature and a little bit of salt. Great little place to eat 
FoodHeads,309,I ve visited here twice recently and I m feeling a hankerin  to go again   As far as location goes  this place is hard to beat.  It s central and cute  in a little house with a great porch and lots of character.  It s worthy of a visit with your friend who s visiting from out of town   Just what she d expect from Austin...     I ll keep going back for the unique sandwiches and soups.  The foodheads in charge come up with some really creative concoctions  spins on the traditional items you d expect.  I really like their dainty side dishes of cucumber slices and cabbage slaw  too.
FoodHeads,310,I spend all of my money at FoodHeads. I have spent all of my money at FoodHeads. Spend all of your money at FoodHeads.  ... but you know what  IT WAS DELICIOUS SO I WAS FINE WITH IT     Seriously. Just go here. Beware 11am-1pm. Call ahead if that s when you gotta pop in. Also  eat Zapp s chips  BARBECUE RANCH    amp  make yourself an Arnold Palmer. Seriously. This place is cute as shit  amp  the food is DELICIOUS. If I was rich  I would eat all of my meals here. But sadly  easily spending  15 on a sandwich  drink  amp  bag of chips makes FoodHeads a Special Occasion meal for me. Go here before you regret it.
FoodHeads,311,Took my four year old to Foodheads for lunch yesterday and we had a great time.   I had the roast beef and brie and he had a grilled cheese sandwich  not on the menu but offered up when I asked what they recommended for kids. Along with this  we had the lemonade  which was the perfect mix of sweet and sour   sour cream  amp  onion potato chips and a cookie.  My sandwich was amazing  the roast beef was very fresh and had enough marbling for flavour  but wasn t greasy. The dijon mustard and brie were great compliments.
FoodHeads,312,Having had their catered foods a few times during several formal events on campus  I visited the restaurant for a Saturday lunch. Parking is a little complicated with signs pointing you into a backlot plastered with towing notices from the surrounding businesses. It s probably easier to just park on one of the side streets and walk over.  The atmosphere inside is really homely and the plastic drink cups almost remind you of being in someone s kitchen or backyard. I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich  Bellas  amp  Bleu Cheese  for  7.95 and then waited for over 20 minutes to get my food. The sandwich was delicious  especially the balsamic vinaigrette soaked into the bread. Unfortunately I felt like it was a little over-priced given how much food I got  especially with Fricano s Deli mere minutes away. If you want a solid vegetarian sandwich selection  then definitely check out FoodHeads. Otherwise you d be better off going somewhere else.
FoodHeads,313,I LOVE THIS PLACE       Always fresh always delicious.    This guy is the Soup Master   NOW OPEN FOR DINNER     yes please.   I had a scallop taco.  yum.  It had a little curry flavor but was very light and did not overwhelm the delicate seafood flavor of my scallops.  They are very careful about putting plates together and it s obvious that a lot of though goes into the food.    I am so happy that I can come here at a different hour.  They also have a very cheap corking fee of  1.50   person for wine.  There are many things on the dinner menu that I must go back and try.  Cant wait 
FoodHeads,314,Disclaimer  This review is solely on the chicken soup.  The chicken tortilla soup is gross   Way too greasy - most likely due to the chicken skin left in the soup.  All other ingredients were very fresh tasting.
FoodHeads,315,This adorable renovated cottage turned sandwich shop won me over after only one bite.  Food heads is just fabulous  If you haven t been you must go. Everything this tiny little sandwich shop puts out is always on point. From the first moment I found this little gem I have truly been in love.  For starter the transformed cottage itself is just darling. I love the decor and bohemian chic feel. They have both indoor and outdoor seating available so don t let a little rain keep you away.  The food  their pulled pork is my  1. Tender morsels of meaty goodness on a fresh baked focaccia loaf with franks red hot.  Slap yo momma good   Their soup... Oh their soup   Please please do yourself a favor and get the chicken tortilla soup. Hands down the best I have ever had. It s not overcrowded with cumin or chili powder. Just pure chicken and vegetable taste. The broth is so fresh and flavorful and the tortilla chips on top are homemade goodness.  I love you food heads   Everything you do is amazing. Please never expand or change. You are perfect exactly as you are   
FoodHeads,316,Best sandwich I haver had...sarcasm  No  Love this place   Chicken sandwich on multigrain bread with eggplant...sounds so simple but the flavors of the cheese and all the other ingredients made it so delicious. Will definitely be returning to this place during my next visit to Austin. The ppl are so nice and the atmosphere vibe is great. Laid back.
FoodHeads,317,Catching lunch at FoodHeads is now on my list of perfect ways to spend a Saturday afternoon. While the wait can be long at peak hours  you definitely won t mind taking your time here. This place provides a refreshing break from boring menus. The ingredients taste incredibly fresh  and the creativity that went into planning and preparing the recipes is impressive.  We ordered the chicken special and sirloin cheesesteak and were very pleased with the multi-dimensional flavors. The chicken sandwich included a tender  grilled chicken breast  avocado  and tarragon mayo on ciabatta bread. Slivers of sirloin steak  melted cheese  not sure what kind   and roasted bell peppers on a French roll rounded out the cheesesteak. The addition of roasted chiles provided a subtle bit of heat  which we really enjoyed. The boyfriend lamented that the bread was too hard all the way through  and I agree that a softer roll would ve been better. Both served with German-style potato salad which was also a big hit.  I m not too crazy about the prices  but it s the quality of food and ultra relaxing atmosphere that will keep me coming back.
FoodHeads,318,I had the spicy apple pork tenderloin sandwich -  marinated and grilled pork tenderloin on toasted baguette with smoked gouda  spinach  spicy apple relish  amp  honey dijon.   Absolutely delicious.  The pork was really juicy and tender  and the other ingredients were perfect with the pork.  The baguette was the right combination of crusty outside and soft inside.  The apple relish was really fresh and contained bits of apple  gala  I think   and red onion.  My only complaint is that the bread-to-meat ratio was a little too bready  not meaty enough.  But I would totally come here again.  Almost as good as Zingerman s Deli in Ann Arbor  Michigan.     Also  I really liked the location.  Incredibly cute little house with books on the shelves.
FoodHeads,319,Sub par for sandwiches. Found a hair and fruit fly in my sandwich today. Hope I didn t eat any before I noticed.
FoodHeads,320,The portabella mushroom and bleu cheese sandwich is the best meatless sandwich I have ever eaten in my life  and I was a vegetarian in Southern California for ten years so that is saying something monumental. Everything else I have tried there has also been delicious  and the bf always likes his sandwiches too. The icebox pickles punctuate their rich sandwiches perfectly.  Also  It s an adorable former house with lovely outdoor and indoor seating areas. And I think it s family-run by a charming group of people who make sandwiches so good that I want them to win at everything. When I am elected President of the Universe  I plan to award medals for valorously delicious sandwiches  and FoodHeads is first on the list to receive one.  My only complaint is their hours. I wish they were open longer.
FoodHeads,321,If they don t deliver  they shouldN T have it marked on their yelp page that they deliver.  I understand that they do  technically  provide delivery if they are catering your event  but that s kind of a no-brainer  right       Hi  I d like you to cater an event I m organizing.       Okay  but just so you know  we don t deliver.      What       Yeah  like  you have to pick up the food yourself.... and then we ll show up  and  I don t know  hand out napkins or something.     Trivia question    What are 90  of the people that visit this yelp page interested in  A   Delivery to their dorm B   Delivery to their catering event  I ll give you a hint   Neighborhood  University of Texas  You guess it    B  a catering event    Because every time I hold a study session  I cater.   It s just common knowledge.   I m giving them three stars instead of one because their menu looks freaking awesome.
FoodHeads,322,I loved food heads  It seems a bit pricey but there sandwiches eat like a three course meal. I ll be sure to visit whenever I m in Austin.  I thought the service was good  and the tea was refreshing.  A good mix of people as well.
FoodHeads,323,I get what they re doing. I have eyes. I just have to agree with Yelp s suggested review sentence of  Meh. I ve experienced better.  My fondest memory of today s lunch was the bread the sandwich came on.  A friend I haven t seen in a while made the suggestion to go here and I ve been curious so I figured why not. I chose the  1 2 sandwich  amp  soup special. One of today s sandwiches was a prosciutto and egg salad sandwich  and a soup was this chicken  lemon  and rice affair called  avgolemono.  The soup was bland city  as was my sandwich. Two bites into my sandwich  it occurs to me that prosciutto is nowhere to be found. I asked the girl at the counter about it and she blankly responded  oh  and disappeared to the back and came out with a plate of prosciutto.  Thank you  FoodHeads. I love paying  10 to build my own sandwich. I certainly couldn t have done that at home.
FoodHeads,324,I used to work out on Saturday mornings with two friends and one of their moms.  Afterwards  we d be ladies that lunch at Foodheads.  They had a lovely array of vegetarian and meaty sandwiches to satisfy all of our needs.  I also loved getting a bag of the salt-and-vinegar Zapps   What good memories of those days.  Also  I remember the sides of potato salad were also wonderful.  The atmosphere of the house is adorable  like you re eating lunch at your cool elderly aunt s.
FoodHeads,325,I thought I d revise this review...since now I ve been to Foodheads more than once now.  I have tried a few different sandwiches and I don t think I have been disappointed yet. Their pulled pork sandwich just screams to be devoured. Herb rubbed chicken Chicken special   it is indeed rubbed with herbs.  This place definitely sends off that austin vibe... maybe it s because it feels rather local and welcoming. The place is situated as a house with tables and chairs inside and outside as well. Going to Foodheads at peak hours will probably sit you outside since it can get crowded indeed.  They have quite a few different teas and they are all very tasty. We re in Texas. Tea is water to most of us I m sure... although I m Asian so maybe it s the same thing.
FoodHeads,326,Only in Austin can you buy a sandwich that roasted lamb shank and grilled eggplant on homemade bread with homemade mustard and homemade pickles.  Ponder that sentence for a moment  and shake your head in wonder - THEY MAKE THEIR OWN MUSTARD.  Now THAT S dedication.   As a pescatarian  I only eat fish and veggies   I m often limited on selections  and as an Austinite  I ve had most of the standard offerings.  While Foodhead s didn t offer anything fundamentally new  don t be fooled - the Tuna Necoise is just a tuna salad sandwich done their way   they did offer a fantastic interpretation of them.  My fish tacos were obviously fresh - with fresh fish  - and perfectly done.  I won t say they re the best I ever had  but they sure were damn good.  The fish was tender and moist  and while the flavors were subtle  I think the freshness of the ingredients more than made up for it.  I will say that the sandwiches are pricey - I looked over the  build your own  veggie sandwich option  and by the time you add it all together  you end up with a nearly  10 sandwich.  That s the other down - this place isn t cheap for a soup and sandwich joint.  Of course  you balance that with FoodHeads being one of the only places in town that you can order a tomato  lettuce  red onion  cucumber  squash  and shredded carrots sandwich on rye with roasted red pepper and eggplant mayonnaise with zippy honeydill mustard.    Ok  maybe it s the  only  place in town.  Did  mention they have roasted eggplant and roasted sweet potatoes too   Vegetarians  you re going to love this place.  Meat-eaters  the sheer novelty of a lamb shank sandwich or a roast beef and brie sandwich ought to make it worth the visit.  Catch it on a beautiful Austin day and eat on the patio with some of the handmade lemonade.  No better way to be on a nice Sunday afternoon.
FoodHeads,327,Sandwiches. Good god. Do it. Fresh  delicious  healthy  and really quirky  attractive staff. The inside of the shop has a wide assortment of furniture  which looks like a grab bag of all the best garage sale furniture one could find. They ve set up shop in a classic north campus hyde park-ish house  straddled between guadalupe and lamar  among a short strip of austin-esque dining options.  They ve always got a crowd going at lunch  and my personal preference has always been to grab some food to go. And I m never disappointed. The salads are massive  the sandwiches are hearty  and the service is prompt and friendly. Seriously no major complaints about this place  I m a huge fan.  Just so you know  do NOT park in any of the apartment complex parking lots around there...I found out the hard way that  towing enforced  means exactly what it sounds like. So  wrestle your way through the traffic and try to snag a street spot nearby  or grow a pair of legs and take a short walk from somewhere in the neighborhood.  The gypsy grove and Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin sandwhich are tied for my number 1 recommendation. You seriously cannot go wrong with either one of those sammies.  There s a reason they ve won  best lunch spot  a couple of times.
FoodHeads,328,Love this place   I was introduced to it a few years ago  and I was amazed and sad that I had not found it sooner. The restaurant is in a house  which makes it really cute and fun. Downside is that if you sit inside  you will come out smelling like sandwiches and food...but good thing there s an awesome outdoor patio seating area   My favorites are  Garlic  amp  Herb Roasted Leg of Lamb Sandwich  Grilled Chicken and Eggplant Sandwich  Fish Tacos  and the Gypsy Grove Sandwich. Their menu has items that have the most interesting ingredients  and they somehow manage to blend the flavors into something wonderful. They also have a wide variety of salads  soups  etc  and a lot of vegan options . Highly recommended  
FoodHeads,329,I returned to FoodHeads after a long time away.  They received me with open arms and a good sandwich.  The prices are high  and the menu is simple  but FoodHeads does offer some solid meat and bread.  The pork special was a great combo of very crisp bacon  roasted pork loin  lime-pineapple salsa  and coleslaw.  It was a great combination  and the bread was nicely crisp.  The only complaint was the overcooked pork.  The eggplant and chicken had a nice spread of goat cheese to give the light flavors some zip  and the multigrain bread was hearty and nutty  but the chicken was overcooked.  FoodHeads is a great spot for upscale  Austin-y sandwiches  but be wary of overcooked meat... it may surprise you.
FoodHeads,330,Good food  and very friendly staff. It s not exactly a destination place  but if you re nearby  hungry  and find it open  it s worth checking out.   I had the  Lami  greasy but tasty - the mozzarella was extremely fresh  and gazpacho  all around great .  7ish for a decently sized lunch - and a peaceful atmosphere.
FoodHeads,331,Great atmosphere  check Warm sunny day during winter to sit on porch  check Large menu with interesting combinations  check  Execution of menu  eh.  The husband and I were trying to decide where to go for lunch.  We have wanted to try Foodheads for a long time  but our schedules prevented us from heading out here for lunch.  Since yesterday was a lazy  but I don t want to go back to work day   we decided to head over here to get lunch at a place we ve always wanted to go.  Based on some of the comments I ve read  I got the lamb.  He got the apple pork tenderloin.  My sandwich was like eating a warm soft pillow.   You know  when you have those dreams when you are eating something but you can t exactly taste it   That s what the lamb sandwich was like except I wasn t dreaming.  It was warm and soft  but completely without strong flavor.  It wasn t exactly bland  but just boring.  I could taste every component  but they just were eh.  I think they needed some sort of punch like an acid component to make everything brighter.    The husband s sandwich had more punch  I snitched a bite  and definitely more flavor.  I thought the smokiness of his sandwich was too aggressive.  I get a tasty Hickory Smoke seasoning from The Spice House in Chicago and it tasted like I had dipped a big o spoonful from that jar and ate it.  It s one of those flavors where a little dab will do you and too much makes you never forget it.    I ll probably go back sometime and try something else  but I m not rushing back.
FoodHeads,332,Although parking is a bit hit or miss  this is definitely not a place to miss. The sandwiches are varied  delicious  and always fresh. The ingredients taste incredible  and there are so many unique options you really can t go wrong. My favorite sandwich is the  Lami  which is elegant while still being hearty and filling. Also  don t underestimate the benefit of the half sandwich and side salad combo  delicious and cost effective  
FoodHeads,333,Never had a bad wich here.  The combination of the ingredients on the sandwiches are so unique and flavorful  it makes you never want to pick it apart.  It s helpful to come here on a slow day  or early  other wise the line will be out the door  and you may have to wait to order  and to sit.  The homemade pickles are a bonus.
FoodHeads,334,Overall  After reading all the hype here on Yelp we decided to give it a try  but were very disappointed in the food. There are plenty of better sandwhich places around town to try out instead.  Food  5 10    7 10  Chicken Special Grilled chicken breast on toasted ciabatta with lettuce  tomato  avocado  feta cheese and tarragon mayonnaise. The bread was slightly hard  which seemed to be the theme for the other sandwiches as well. The lettuce  tomatoes and avocados tasted fresh. The feta cheese was a nice touch. The tarragon mayonnaise was very mild and lacking in flavor. Still  this was our favorite sandwich out of the ones we tried.   5 10  Pulled Pork Sandwich Shredded adobo pork roast on toasted ciabatta with lettuce  white onion  avocado  and Frank s hot sauce. After hearing much hype about this particular sandwich  we were sad it did not deliver. There was way too much hot sauce on the sandwich. The bread was soggy  and it was much too spicy for us to enjoy. The pork was not temperature hot when it came out  and we would have preferred it to be nice and warm. Unless we had a newbie making our sandwich or something...stay away from this one    5 10  Garlic  amp  Herb Roasted Leg of Lamb Served on toasted ciabatta with lettuce  tomato  grilled eggplant  feta cheese and cucumber mayonnaise. The lamb was extremely tough and tasted gamey - not herb roasted at all. We didn t expect it to be soft and tender  but this was inedible  The cheese added some nice flavor. The cucumbers were sliced too thick  but the eggplant was grilled nicely. Each sandwich comes with one very small side and unfortunately  we enjoyed the sides more than the actual sandwich. The choice of side items included a potato salad  pickles and cole slaw.  Service  7 10   We came around noon on a weekday and stood in line for about ten minutes while perusing the large chalkboard menu. The cashier was efficient and took our order. The water  tea  silverware area is self-serve  and then we sat outside since it was a nice day. Our sandwiches were brought to our table about ten minutes later. Again  the waitress was competent  but not very friendly. We weren t checked up on during our meal  but perhaps that is because it is a self-seating  casual caf . When we finished eating  we did not have to bus our table. Overall the service was good  but could use a few personal touches.  Ambiance  6 10   An old house that turned into a restaurant  Food Heads has kitschy-but-quaint decor inside. Street parking is available  but keep in mind it gets pretty crowded during the lunch rush. There are several tables inside  and a porch with covered or open seating outside. Food Heads uses New World Bakery Breads and makes its own condiments. If you work close by  it is a nice change from the chain restaurants and has that hippie Austin vibe to it. Although they offer reasonably priced food and might have been having an off-day  the gourmet sandwiches were just mediocre at best.
FoodHeads,335,It angers me when places like Thundercloud Subs win the Chronicle s  Best Sandwich  category.  I can t help but think-- if everyone in town had been to FoodHeads  that wouldn t be happening.   however  its scares me to think what WOULD be happening  considering the FH lines often wind out the door and wrap around onto 34th Street already    I am NOT one of those people that has my  regular order  at places.... noooo way   And yet- I have all I can do to hold back from ordering a grilled squash when I walk through the door   Or a chicken eggplant... mmmm... or have you tried a chicken eggplant 86 chicken extra eggplant     No   Well  you re missin out...  add tarragon mayo on the side and call it  The Jamison       Sirloin  fish tacos  and chicken special are all up there in my top picks.  Definitely try the soups too  particularly if they have wild mushroom  green chile chicken posole  or beer cheese.  Check out their menu and you ll see a world of possibilities outside the overhead blackboards   A baked sandwich is on my radar to try ... and any of their custom-made sandwiches are amazing too.... load up a ton of veggies on their delicious bread  from Mandola s  NOT New World Cafe    with some housemade spreads  they make a mean hummus and have a spectrum of different mayos to choose from too .  The ONE thing I would suggest is that they put out some bus bins to alleviate the multi-tasking  and always delightful  servers bussers expeditors.  I know I certainly wouldn t mind  would you    and it would only help speed things up when that line starts snaking out the door.  I love those food doods.
FoodHeads,336,Best Sandwiches in Austin.  Their soups are pretty darn good as well.  My personal favorite is the gypsy grove which has a fried egg inside of it.  Every sandwich I ve tried here has been delicious and their side of coleslaw is probably the only coleslaw I ve ever liked.  Just wish it was open for dinner 
FoodHeads,337,Went here for the first time today and thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich.  I ordered the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  Pork was really tasty by itself and was a great mixture of flavors with spinach leaves  fresh diced apples  and smoked gouda cheese.    The place itself is very charming - old house turned into sandwich joint with an eclectic mismatch of furniture and chairs that gives this place a lot of character.  You walk in and the place smells so good.  Will definitely be going back for lunch sometime 
FoodHeads,338,My sister loved this place so much that she took a to-go menu to give to me.  I was excited to try it  and even more excited when I found out it was a renovated house.  There was porch for outdoor seating but it was a little too breezy  why so breezy in early October   .  I was disappointed to find out that they did not make breakfast tacos for lunch even though the menu said it would cost  0.50 more after 11AM.  I opted for the Grilled Squash  amp  Fresh Mozzarella.  My friend Pat got the Grilled Portabellas  amp  Bleu Cheese but substituted mozzarella in for bleu cheese.  He and i swapped halves - the sandwiches were very big  definitely come hungry.   The squash was difficult to keep inside the bread and the flavors were good but I wish they were stronger - I couldn t really taste the cilantro pesto as much as I wanted.  The portabella sandwich was only luke-warm when I bit into it.    Our other friend Michelle got the Garlic  amp  Herb Roasted Leg of Lamb.  She said the flavor was mediocre and the meat very tendon-y making it difficult to chew.    I really appreciate the interesting combination of ingredients  especially the generous vegetarian options.  However the flavor really didn t live up to my sister s hype.  Maybe I was expecting too much.
FoodHeads,339,5 stars for the mismatched seating sets--i love their chairs and tables.  And the outdoor seating is truly magical.     5 stars for their insanely delish fresh brewed tea selection.  5 stars for their soups and sandwiches.  I tried a special of the day vegetarian sandwich and it was just so-so.  Next time I will stick with a self-made creation.  I know it will be perfection.  AND 5 stars for their ICE BOX PICKLES   I love you foodheads.    J
FoodHeads,340,Worked in the area for years  even once in walking distance. But never have I tired this place until recently.  Let me say this much  it s just not a sandwich. Unless your eating a plain jane sandwich  think out of the box and expand your palt.  I gave the Chicken and Eggplant a try  was very much please. My bread was super toasty  had plently of meat and eggplant. Was extremely satisfied  left full and super pleased. Totally recommend this sandwich  just wish I had gotten the cumber salad  instead of the potato salad.   P.S. Parking is only street so yes that part sucks
FoodHeads,341,I ve been reading such awesome reviews on Yelp about this place  but I never went around to checking it out due to pure laziness. It s a short drive from my office  but I didn t want to deal with street parking.  I decided to check it out for lunch  and I was instantly hooked  I went with the Tuna Nicoise  but while waiting for my order  they told me that they ran out of tuna...or maybe they didn t have any to begin with. They let me pick any of their other sandwiches at no extra cost  I went with the chicken special  and it was rather tasty  The ciabatta bread was great  and the grilled chicken was super tasty. Supposedly there s avocado in there  but I didn t taste any. The side potato salad was good as well  although I wish they had given me more.  It is a bit on the pricey side for a sandwich  but it s a pretty darn good sandwich  If I feel like splurging on a gourmet sandwich  I ll def go back again. I also really enjoyed the ambience. It totally has the Austin feel which I like. I love how they basically converted a house into a sandwich joint.  There s a lot of seating outdoors which makes it nice to relax and people watch. I can see parking being a pain  but if you go either before or after the lunch crowd  you should be able to find parking fairly close by.
FoodHeads,342,I m a breakfast taco convert. Recently moved to Austin from California. This is great food and the staff is super friendly. Thanks for such a nice welcome and some delicious foo 
FoodHeads,343,I was looking for a place to grab a bite before a doctor s appointment and stumbled into FoodHeads. I really liked the ambiance of the place  I got to enjoy my sandwich out on the porch. It felt like I was just enjoying a homemade sandwich in my backyard  very relaxing  even though the place was still pretty full.   The food was very good but a little pricey. I got the chicken  amp  eggplant sandwich and an iced tea and it was  12  Maybe I m being a cheapo but I think that s a lot of dinero. The ingredients were fresh and seemed to be high quality  so I can let the price thing go.  Overall  I will be back the next time I have another doctor s appointment 
FoodHeads,344,The apple pork sandwich is everything that is right in this world. I LOVE this place     It s so cute it almost hurts. Their desserts are also very good  I had the pear crisp and it was to die for. I wee bit spendy for what it is  but definitely worth it  
FoodHeads,345,AHI TUNA SANDWICH is my favorite. The tuna is rubbed in a slightly spicy seasoning and served medium rare on ciabatta  my favorite sandwich bread  . It s topped with some sort of slaw  balsamic-pickled onions  and avocado. Definitely the best combination EVER   I ve also tried their salmon salad and chicken eggplant which are both good The salmon salad is very unique. It s has apples  nuts  and raisins in it. Not your typical chicken tuna salad.
FoodHeads,346,Um  well  where to begin  There s a phenomenon known as emergence. Hordes of people   dumb luck   an almost perfect consensus. That explains the crowd that is always clogging the doorways at FoodHeads. It feels like a school cafeteria the way every table is full all the time  but like a school where you don t have to go to class afterwards and your cold pizza is replaced with a pork sandwich with tabasco slaw and a fried egg on it  for example. It s the best sandwich in Austin  and possibly the best I ve had. I have friends who  when in town for Sx  go to FoodHeads every. day. The service is quick  the menu options are beautiful--neither tedious nor heavy-handed. Well-edited. Grilled salami  roast beef and brie  the pork special  the fish tacos...they re all delicious.  It does close at 4 and is closed on Sundays  life  ruined  but the pros make it an early day priority. Because it s the best.
FoodHeads,347,Its easy to say that I m a fan of this place.  I love taking people here from out of town.  Most of the time they are excited about just the atmosphere and d cor  but once they taste the food it blows them away.   Fresh ingredients and great flavors.  Something is lacking though... its missing that thing that makes me rave about it and tell everyone.  I don t know what it is  but I hope either I find it or they do.
FoodHeads,348,I thought I d written a review of this place a while ago  but I can t find it anymore.   Incidentally  there s another profile for this same business that has only 7  5-star reviews on there. So  if anyone that s reading this can do something about that...um..do that.  Anyway  I went there about a year ago because I d heard amazing things about this place. I think I got the salmon salad sandwich and wasn t terribly impressed. Perhaps the apples threw me off. Perhaps the ciabatta was too rough on my TMJ. Whatever it was  I wasn t inspired to come back.   Today  I went there with my not-my-girlfriend  NMG  to grab a bite before taking her to work. I love what they ve done with the patio. Actually  I love a lot of the look of this place. Plus  the homemade lemonade hits the spot  and the different iced teas are lovely  if all caffeinated .  I had the Tuna Melt  which was served on  rye  which didn t  honestly  taste a lot like rye. Maybe it s a type of rye I haven t had before. One with no caraway seeds in it. I must say  I liked this better than the salmon salad sammich  but the tuna salad somehow managed to be dry in places while still managing to drip all over my hands. Go figure. I do like that they put fresh spinach on there. Nice touch.  My NMG got 1 2 Salami and Mozz sammich with their Samosa Soup. When she tried the soup  she asked me if it was supposed to be served cold. Probably not. So  she took it back and they offered to bring it out to her and offered her a cookie  which she declined  to my chagrin .   The Salami Sandwich is what she usually gets here  I think. I don t know why  but today the salami was extremely greasy. Maybe because they cooked the salami  I don t know  but it didn t look appealing to me  and she ended up sopping some grease off with her napkin.  When the soup came back out  she ate it happily and offered me a taste. And it was just....barely...not...cold. Really  We could ve taken it back again  but it just wasn t worth it at that point. Plus  it fell into a trap that most curry-based dishes fall into. Lack of salt. Maybe with all the different flavors in curry  people forget that salt should also be added  I m not sure  but I won t be getting that soup again.  The saving grace is their side of cucumber salad. It s delicious. I just wish I could ve been as amazed by their menu items.
FoodHeads,349,I have lived in Austin for five years now and Food Heads has grown to be my favorite lunch place to take friends and family from out-of-town for good local food  The restaurant has a small-town feel and the location is a perfect distance away from campus. Outdoor patio of peeeeerfect for sunny days  Lami sandwich is my go-to.
FoodHeads,350,The Gypsy Grove is one of the best sandwiches in the US. A classic Austin establishment that you ve got to check out. BYOB
FoodHeads,351,Food Heads has a great vibe and great sandwiches that are more than filling. I like to get the pulled pork bbq sandwich  it s spicy but the avocados temper it nicely.  It s usually enough for me to save half for later. I like all three of the sides  potatoes  slaw and pickles .   The cafe itself is very cute and I love that you serve yourself drinks. AND they have sweet tea  which is so hard to find in Austin. Great price and great value although I ve heard that it can get quite busy at times. So I say to head there early and try your darndest to find a good parking spot.
FoodHeads,352,One of my go-to places. Consistent deliciousness  and the nicest staff. Lami sandwich is classic.
FoodHeads,353,Dinner Foodheads on Saturday night with my husband.  Foodheads is in a cute little old house.  It was a warm night so we sat outside on the porch.  The fresh flower on the rustic table was a nice touch.  The food was pretty good.  We had eaten a substantial lunch  we shared an Apple Pork sandwich - and it was very good.  The bread was delicious - crunchy on the outside  soft on the inside  and not too sweet.   We also shared two sides  the asparagus with parmesan and lemon  and Foodheads  sexy tater-tots  the old fave with fresh cilantro and garlic .  Both were good  but maybe the tater tots had a bit too much pepper on them.  I am looking forward to going back and tasting other dishes on the dinner menu.
FoodHeads,354,This place is a food heaven. I tried the chicken basil sandwich with goat cheese and it was absolutely the best sandwich I have ever had.  The patio is lovely  with lots of plants  plenty of colorful seating  it reminds me of my grandmother s garden. My only complaint could be the store hours. 4 pm is too early to close this place. I would love to enjoy my dinner there.
FoodHeads,355,Delicious  Everything was fresh- house was packed but service was fast and efficient. Egg salad and prosciutto sandwich was fabulous  Added bonus was the Billie Holiday playing in the background   
FoodHeads,356,A friend brought me lunch from Foodheads and after reading these reviews  I was letdown. My friend ordered the fish tacos and I had the chicken salad sandwich on wheat bread. My friend said her fish taco was real fishy and could only eat one so she gave me the other one. The one I had was dry and bland and was definitely one of most flavorless that I have tasted. My chicken salad sandwich was below average. While it was packed pretty good with filling  the flavor was dull and all I could really remember tasting was the bread. Very disappointing. She also told me that the young lady that took her order was a bit pretentious. On a positive note the coconut cupwake was pretty darn good.
FoodHeads,357,This place rocks    Its beautiful  casual and the food is amazing    I had been looking for a stellar tuna nicoise salad for some time and I found it here   Also shared the bread pudding with my mom. It was perfect  I ll be back  
FoodHeads,358,What can I say - I love this place  The sandwiches are generally pretty big for one sitting. That usually never stops me because it s so delicious and I always end up eating it all anyway   I usually stop in here for lunch because I always get the craving - it can get quite crowded  amp  noisy inside though. I don t mind because the food is scrumptious and I just stick my earbuds in. I usually go alone  so if you re in a group going to lunch I would highly recommend arriving around 11 30 since the rush usually starts around 12pm.  Luckily there is plenty of seating on the exterior of this cute little re-imagined house where you can sit too. The owner is an awesome guy and I ve seen him go around and talk to tables on several of my visits.  Lunch here is definitely hectic compared to dinner time where the crowd is much  milder and less noisy. It s a perfect date spot as you can BYOB and they offer plenty of dinner options for a sandwich shop.   My favorites  the pork sandwich  fish tacos  large Greek salad with chicken  amp  the mushroom sandwich. For sides  I really like their potato salad or the pickles. The mint snowflake Tea is also very refreshing.   Go. You ll love the food and the space is so cute 
FoodHeads,359,Roast Beef  amp  Brie Melt.  Try the coleslaw.  Best sandwiches in town.
FoodHeads,360,I live on the same street as Food Heas and just recently went for the first time. Let me tell you  I wasn t disappointed  From the quaintness of the place to the food  everything just left a fine taste in my mouth.  There s inside and outdoor seating  which is awesome during Texas Fall weather. There s street parking only so you may find yourself walking about a block from your car.  I got the lamb sandwich. It was good if a bit chewy. That was because the cuts were too thick. It would have been better if they thinly sliced it like lamb kebabs.  Nonetheless  it was flavorful and very filling  I wouldn t get the lamb again but I ll definitely come back to try everything else.
FoodHeads,361,Let me start off by saying I like the vintage and unique decor to this place. My wife and I stuck to the specials menu which she had the chicken special which she enjoyed  where I had the pastrami which was good. Friendly atmosphere which we like too. Worth the visit.
FoodHeads,362,The healthiest  tastiest lunch destination ever   2 30 PM is a pretty late lunch for anybody and so my hungry colleagues and I needed a destination fast or we were going to drop. I quickly recommended FoodHeads because neither of them had gone before and what a great choice it turned out to be. We got their quickly and the place  a cozy house turned cafe  was lively as ever.   We had one order of their Fish Tacos for  7.95 described as pan fried tilapia filets on toasted corn tortillas with lime slaw  tomato  white onion  avocado  and cilantro. Served with FoodHeads house salsa.   And two orders of the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin Sandwich for  8.95 described as a grilled pork tenderloin on toasted baguette with smoked gouda  spinach  spicy apple relish  amp  honey dijon.  My friend s reviews for lunch were that they thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the tastiness of their dishes.  We ll definitely be back soon to try their other equally amazing options.
FoodHeads,363,I love this place. I even hated coleslaw in the past  but I am infatuated with theirs.  Great sandwiches  sides   cool iced teas  and lemonade...oh man  I m hungry. Perfect summer sandwich spot.  Go 
FoodHeads,364,Yeah  the menu is pretty impressive  I mean  it all sounds really great  you know  And the waitresses are hot  who doesn t like that  But  urgh  it is annoying how little this place caters to vegans    Coming to FoodHeads for the first time was a pleasant experience. Walking in  the space really reminded me of a kind of Portland  veggie-friendly  bike-friendly kind of vibe. The menu is charming - very unique  very Austin. I got the hummus sandwich  which is lovely  but the next time I went there  looking to branch out  I found my options limited. I didn t want a salad. I wanted a sandwich. I noticed they have plenty of vegetarian options  but  as is often the case  vegetarian is interpreted as something cheese-centric. Oh well though  the hummus sandwich is still good. If I was a meat-eater I think this would be one of my favorite places  but I m not  so it s not.   Still  it s a place I want to love  and it s near my house  so it s getting three stars.
FoodHeads,365,Just to look at it  FoodHeads is a little iffy. It totally looks like someone s house  inside and out. The whole place is set up with mismatching tables and chairs of odd sizes. They even have a corner with book shelves. There seems to be a shortage of seating  which was a difficulty since my friend and I went at the lunch hour. It was small  and we kept having to scoot up to allow people to walk behind us. Also  after we ordered  we had a fair wait to get our food. So why  with all these negatives  does this place get a 4  Cause the FOOD IS THAT FREAKIN  GOOD  I had a pastrami  and my friend had a chicken club or something  and they were both AMAZING  Like lights out good. No questions asked. Anyway  I would recommend going at a less busy time  but other than that  you will be blown away.
FoodHeads,366,OK at best. The bread is way too hard. We are in Texas...not in france. I don t get why yelpers love it so much. I must not be eating enough mushroom to love it or wearing enough pahchuli or trying to be cool.  Whatever. this place a just mediocre.
FoodHeads,367,The pros  -Cute spot -Friendly staff -Great take out service.  Cons  -The food. It s not terrible. In fact  it s quite fresh with quality ingredients but the sandwich I ordered was the most bland and uninteresting sandwich I can recall eating. Partially because they left off the condiments I requested. Sandwich is my favorite food  so this was disappointing. I can t even put my finger on what was wrong with it. It was just  bleh. Two co-workers ordered salads and were underwhelmed with the portion size which was admittedly tiny. Not to mention  it s a little on the pricy side.  And here s the worst part  and this is absolutely my personal preference . The pickles. If sandwich is my favorite food  pickles are my second favorite and it s great that they make their own but for the love of pickles....sweet   NO. Sweet pickles are a scourge that will not go unpunished.   Admittedly  to others this will seem ridiculous but seriously. Sweet pickles 
FoodHeads,368,Best Sandwich Shop In Austin  cutest tables and bathroom too    I can assure you this very bold statement is backed by having tried nearly every sandwich on their menu and several that are not  boy oh boy  how I miss living with a FoodHeads sandwich maker     They use only high quality  fresh ingredients and have their bread delivered daily from local bakeries. Some personal favs are the garlic  amp  herb roasted leg of lamb  spicy apple pork tenderloin  grilled salami  amp  fresh mozzarella  and the portabella  amp  bleu cheese. Okay  I know that s like half the menu... also good to note that the servers are nice and don t give you any grief for special requests. They have a wonderful assortment of hot and cold teas which I like to combine with their fresh squeezed lemonade for a refreshing accompaniment to my meal.   I don t mind paying a little extra for their specialty sandwiches and delicious soups that are good for the heart and soul. Thanks  Chip  for doing right by your happy and loyal customers    The one star reduction is for inconvenient hours of operation  closed at 4pm and on Sundays  which bites the big one since I moved down South  I could totally see a second location popping up on South 1st where there are plenty of funky old houses just waiting to be converted into quirky sandwich shop   
FoodHeads,369,Went here for lunch today and of course it was delicious as usual. I had the Chicken Eggplant 1 2 sandwich  a cup of onion soup  and a potato salad. So worth it for  7.50.   I hear the pork sandwiches are fabulous as well  but I have yet to try them. I would usually get a giant chocolate chip cookie for  1.50 from them  but today my will overcame my urge to be a fatass. Everyone else should try it though...really.
FoodHeads,370,On looks and feel alone FoodHeads deserves 5 stars.  It s a quaint little home that has touches of refurbished materials and aesthetics.  The location is perfectly located to campus and other businesses yet feels as if you are in the hill country.  The staff is different in many aspects and are friendly and efficient.  Yesterday was simply gorgeous and I could not pass up an opportunity to lunch with friends and loved ones in the early fall type weather.  I had heard that FoodHeads get a big lunch rush and luckily we went after around 1pm  some were still lingering.  But were we all just as amazed at how others took the opportunity too and how quickly the food came out.  It s definitely a sandwich lunch place with some salads and daily specials as well as yummy side dishes.  My sister got the cheese steak special which smelled like pure heaven   My boyfriend enjoyed the pastrami -- I think that s what it was.  And I had the portobello and blue cheese sandwich on multi grain.  Each of our sandwiches were heavenly and so very different  I like when something so plain can be made so different.  Really looking forward to more early fall days and opportunities to lunch outside more.
FoodHeads,371,I lived down the street from Food Heads for a year and had some of my best lunches here. The fish tacos are seriously  seriously magical.  I ve recently moved to southern CA and hoped to find it a fish taco mecca  but still have yet to try one as good as this one.  The mahi mahi torta is a brilliant and inspired sandwich with the cabbage-apple slaw and the flaky fish. And that mozzarella and vegetable sandwich on their thick grainy bread is heavenly.   Service is generally pleasant and efficient  esp. given the crowd at lunch. The first time we were there  the girl behind the counter apologized up and down and gave us free cookies because our order was going to take a little extra time. Subsequent visits were not quite as effusive  but competent every time.  Finally  the backyard-picnic table ambiance always wins me over  as do the excellent selection of iced teas  the cookies  and the FOOD. Oh goodness  the food is so good. I miss it.
FoodHeads,372,Delish   Such a selection of different sandwiches and sides  Cute little spot that offers casual eating and you can play dominoes too  Sandwiches were scrumptious and big - definitely recommend this place 
FoodHeads,373,Just had lunch here. Food and atmosphere was excellent. Had the egg salad and prosciutto sandwich. Good egg salad   prosciutto was tasty and 9 grain bun was good. Other flavors got buried a little. Friend had the seared ahi salad. Tuna was well cooked and tasty.
FoodHeads,374,The food was fine and the atmosphere was as well. The girl working the cash register however was totally rude to us and acted like she could not care less about taking our order. There were audible sighs and visible eye rolls. I thought I was back in Dallas at a snooty restaurant or something.
FoodHeads,375,We ordered and thoroughly enjoyed the fish tacos  a chicken sandwich with feta cheese  and a pork tenderloin sandwich...the pork was the best of all 3.  Definitely plan to return for more 
FoodHeads,376,Fun atmosphere  great salads and sandwiches  They offer punch card reward for coffee and entrees when you pay with cash 
FoodHeads,377,When I lived in the their neighborhood I ate here once a week I still try to eat here once a month.  They offer so many vegetable options to add to your sandwich  but my favorite remains the same - a simple grilled cheese on pumpernickel bread with tomato and the garlic mayonnaise. I always order the Tomato Soup to dunk it in when it is the soup of the day - I wish they offered it every day.  The Chicken Tortilla soup is also very good.  I give them a full 5 stars for offering a Squash Sandwich as well as a Lamb Sandwich.  The house turned sandwich shop is very cute and Austiny......
FoodHeads,378,Ah yes  Foodheads has a noggin for making good grub.  The genius that thought up those combinations to put into sandwiches deserves a Nobel prize or whatever the food equivalent is.  Ever since eating Primanti s in Pittsburgh  adding coleslaw into my sandwich  hamburger  or hot dog has been a good idea.  Enter in the Gypsy Grove Sandwich.  Marinated and grilled pork tenderloin  amp  grilled ham on garlic toasted baguette with swiss cheese  fried egg  Foodhead s jalepeno relish and tabasco slaw.  This chaotic mess bangs its way into a perfect concoction inside your mouth.  Too messy for you   Try the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  Whenever  I eat Apple   Pork  I am reminded of being in a Hawaiian luau.  But  I ve never been to Hawaii.  The workers at Foodheads are incredibly friendly.  The place is a converted house so it has a home-y  Keep Austin Weird feel.  Parking is street only.  The prices are on the upper-end for a sandwich.
FoodHeads,379,Mmmm. Great  good tasting ingredient sandwiches. Mmmmm. I m definitely a fan.  We drove into Austin for the day and decided to try FoodHeads. The atmosphere was really cute- it s this old house with warm colors that s.. a restaurant. I loved the warm feeling of it when you entered in.   We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the eggplant. Omg  they were so great and the breads was so tasty and fresh. I really think breads make the sandwich- and this place definitely did.   Definitely a stop for a fresh and solid sandwich.
FoodHeads,380,Love going to quaint old houses that house little eating establishment like Foodhead. BTW  beware of the last step to get up to the house as it s a larger step and can hurt when wearing flip flops.   Sandwiches  sandwiches  and more sandwiches  so many choices to choose from. Ate the spicy apple pork tenderloin and found it to be pretty tasty. Only down fall was that I wasn t too thrilled about the bread. The website said that they get bread delivered daily from local bakeries but it just didn t taste great. Since I ate around 3 30  which is 30minutes before close  I m going to give them the benefit a doubt and say that the bread is probably better if eaten at an earlier time. Also found my sandwich to be a little on the dry side. If there is sauce or some sort of condiment that comes on a sandwich  I like mine to have a medium to generous amount on my sandwich. Will specify next time.   Potato salad was delicious. Mucho mustard with a creamy consistency.    I ll take another Yelpers suggestion and eat here a couple more times before making an over all assessment as some variables can influence a first impression.
FoodHeads,381,It would be silly to visit or live in Austin and not eat at Foodheads.  The first couple of things that come to mind when I think about the food from Foodheads  clean  fresh  savory  and tasty.  Expect to pay about  10 per person but it s worth the price.  My wife really enjoys their homemade pickles and I m a fan of their potato salad.  You can t go wrong with anything on their menu.    I love that they have 3-4 different iced teas on hand.  Quite refreshing in the heat of the summer.  I think their teas come from Texas Coffee Traders.  Not sure about that though.  Parking is a little sparse.  There s some parking in the ally way behind the building but you re more likely find something on the street.   Truthfully I ve found that most of the really good food places in Austin have terrible parking.
FoodHeads,382,I thought the chicken sandwich was delicious and so was the soup.    And you can take your own wine for a  1.50 uncorking fee  per person .  Also liked the ambiance and the employees all seemed nice.
FoodHeads,383,True Austin   FoodHeads is a great laid back - foodie gourmet sandwich place.  The Gypsy Grove - with the fried egg  pork  tabasco style cream sauce with a kick - is amazing and just about as unique as it gets.   I love coming to this place and just enjoying the nice Austin weather  reading one of the food magazine s that Cliff leaves out for customers  and relaxing - destressing.   The main downside here is the parking - it s hit or miss if you can parallel park.   The other one being that it closes at 3 30pm... no afternoon sandwiches   
FoodHeads,384,great little place   i had the eggplant and chicken sandwich from here awhile back... DELICIOUS   the corn and basil chowder was also OUtSTANDING   the interior is pretty small  so probably not the best place for a big group.  very cozy hipster.  but if you want some fresh sandwiches or soups  this is the place to go 
FoodHeads,385,Not your usual Subway kinda place. The Hot Pastrami was great. A new take on The Rueben and Much Better  Replace Sauerkraut with Sour Slaw. Yum.  Also got some Creole Tomato Zapp s chips. Tasty.  The young lady who waited on us was friendly  engaging  and offered helpful suggestions.
FoodHeads,386,Talk about a place with your classic Austin feel. Very laid back atmosphere with an area to sit inside and out. The inside has a very eclectic feel with old tables and chairs that don t really match but come together very well. The outside is much of the same with glass tables  wooden tables  and even a picnic bench to the side.   I had the half pastrami half soup  which was pretty delicious. They use a very fresh sauerkraut that they make themselves and provide more than enough meat. My friend had chicken special which also looked yummy  and she said she liked it a lot.  The whole menu was filled with fancy sandwiches and they all sounded delicious.  Do remember though  this place is strictly a lunch-spot  seeing that it closes at 3 30.
FoodHeads,387,Came here at the recommendation of some Austin-ites and I put it on my  to-eat  list and I am definitely glad I wasn t so hungover that I could make it here for lunch with friends. A great patio area and inviting interior make for a great place to get some lunch. A quick look at the menu and a look at some of their newer offerings had me wanting their mahi mahi torta with some ice tea  incidentally I got the last mahi mahi  maybe it was destiny  lol  in any case my friends ordered the fish tacos  ahi tuna torta and the pulled pork sandwich.  my mahi torta was great  full of flavor with the right amount of greens to keep the focus on the fish. the pulled pork was soft and reminded moist throughout. the seared ahi tuna had some slightly spicy rub to it that worked really well. The fish tacos  however  were pretty fail. lack of any flavor even when the salsa and lime was put on top. A real appointment since the other 3 dishes were great.  Definitely a spot I d add on my  When you cant think of anything else  list in Austin.  Cliffs  Skip the fish tacos  and definitely sit outside on a great breezy day.
FoodHeads,388,Sandwiches don t get any better than this. It s a very unassuming place  north of campus. Haven t had a bad one yet  but the veal sandwich is my favorite. They have various kinds of herbal iced tea also.
FoodHeads,389,  cool environment   friendly staff    wide variety of food selections   - parking  street only  - difficult to find - taste  fairly bland  steak was tough  amp  large pieces made it difficult to eat - detergent taste in the plastic cups made it hard to enjoy my drink    had the sirloin cheese steak   will give it another try to see if there s something on the menu that will be better tasting. the cashier s statement that what I got is one of her favorites isn t very promising  however.
FoodHeads,390,Best Sandwich in Austin. Hands Down. GD Period.  Ive been looking for a sammy shop like this for 5 years. Fresh  thick sliced breads  a topping  amp  condiment list that will LITERALLY  flip your lid  like 5 kinds of homemade mayo  grilled sweet potatoes  roasted elephant garlic  amp  eggplant....could keep...typing. Bonus  Add whatever you like  its ALL THE SAME PRICE  FINALLY  someone got it right   Obviously  they have an artisan list of meats  cheeses  blah..blah.  One tip for the mgmt  Spread the bevvies and silverware stations out- they are too close the counter where everyone stands in the queue...people can get quite fiesty when hungry and receiving and accidental elbow.
FoodHeads,391,Ordered the Spicy Pork Tenderloin sandwich to go  as suggested by other reviewers  and was not totally impressed. I think the flavor profile is excellent  but the execution faltered. And for one sandwich to go  no drinks  chips  just a small plastic cup of marinated cucumbers  the total was  9.47. I would like to support this place  but  10 for a small sandwich is just too much.   Flavor profile is spicy pork tenderloin pieces  smoked gouda slices  red onion  and apple. But  the sandwich fell apart and was kind of dry.  Suggestions  Instead of chunks of apple and red onion  they should be thin slices so that they stay on the sandwich. Also  the smoked gouda slices were too big to compete with the other flavors. Most of all  a more reasonable price would make me return.
FoodHeads,392,Well diversified menu  unique atmosphere and dishes  parking was really confusing. We went next to some parking area that said pink elephant only  some music group . There were signs leading to parking around the corner  but the corner was never specifically found. This place is definitely geared toward college students in the area that are walking  riding bikes or mopeds.  The food was tasty and healthy and the portions were pretty large. There were also a nice assortment of teas and drinks on the menu  although I did not venture to try one at the time. For unique sandwiches that you can t find anywhere else  this is definitely the place 
FoodHeads,393,Great sandwiches for the area. I was told to skip the chicken soup  amp  go for the tomato basil. Great choice. They carry voodoo chips here  which makes any sandwich even better
FoodHeads,394,First time here. I ate the Steak Chimichurri sandwich. It was excellent. Great quality of meat and taste.
FoodHeads,395,Every time I come to this wonderful gem of a lunch spot  I find myself completely satisfied  and then some. It s like just walking up to the quaint front door makes my day 1.43 times better. The food is great -I ve always been pleased with the sandwiches I have ordered. I love the drink choices and the variety of sides that come with the sandwiches. Everything is very fresh and flavorful  making for a delightful experience.  Overall  however  my favorite part is the atmosphere. The outdoor seating is perfect for a Saturday afternoon and is dog-friendly  one of the workers even provided a dog bowl full of fresh water for my four-legged companion . The indoor seating is equally as enjoyable and even has some board games if you happen to have a few hours of time to kill. There are always a nice cross-section of locals who are interesting to observe. Every visit has been exceedingly pleasant and a great way to spend about 10 dollars.  Downside  limited hours of operation. Don t crave their tasty sandwiches at dinner time  
FoodHeads,396,I love a good sandwich and at Foodheads  they ve taken it in directions I never thought to. Walk up to order  then take a seet in one of the various rooms of the old house  the wrap around porch or the patio. There are always new specials  I love the pork tenderloin sandwich  with bits of apple--it was way to large for my appetite. But I really did WANT to finish it.   The next time I went  I ordered 1 2 a turkey sandwich and salad  Still a tasty sandwich and caesar  I always order iced tea--they have different ones every day mmmm  I had the peach ginger--delicious. The place has a green flavor to it--I love it when I see people trying to conserve-Foodheads is all about it.   I ve been with both a group and a date--it was great for both 
FoodHeads,397,Size of the sandwich is deceiving   Because it was the first time visiting FoodHeads  I tried the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin Sandwich...and loved it  sweet apple slices   flavorful pork tenderloin pieces   fresh spinach   whatever else went in that sandwich   perfectionn At first glance  you may think it s too little for you but it definitely filled my stomach and left little room for anything else    I wish I had more room to try their soups but didn t. I m definitely coming back to try other sandwiches 
FoodHeads,398,Wonderful place to have lunch or a late lunch.  Plenty of comfortable places to sit outside in the beautiful weather.    The food is delicious but costs a little more than I would regularly want to pay for lunch.  I had the spicy apple pork tenderloin and its a tasty mix of flavors with a nice kick from their mustard.
FoodHeads,399,#NAME?
FoodHeads,400,I have been a fan of Foodheads for about a year now. It s literally around the corner from where I live and I feel so lucky for being so close to such an awesome spot   I initially thought that it was just a nice sandwich place - and don t get me wrong  their sandwiches are the jam - but I recently tried their breakfast and dinner options.  Sandwiches  I ve had several sandwiches on the menu  chicken Caesar  gypsy grove  apple pork  mozzarella  Lami  etc  and they are all fantastic.  Fresh  natural food paired with a ton of homemade condiments - you can t go wrong. Complex flavors that aren t too heavy  aside from the comforty roast beef  amp  brie that is decadent and amazing . For my side I always grab a bag of flavorful Zapp s chips  nom.   For breakfast the tacos are amazing. I m somewhat of a breakfast taco aficionado and these are some of the best.   Just last night I was able to try their dinner options. I had swung by to pick up a sandwich after my workout. I would have preferred a meal with a lean protein  salad and vegetable but was opting for one of their amazing salads-  much to my surprise I was introduced to their dinner menu  I opted for the crab cakes and the Brussels sprouts. The crab cakes came with a delightful salad - field greens lightly dressed with an apple salsa. Too often dinner salads are either boring or heavy - this was perfect  And the crab cakes  they weren t overloaded with breading and somehow  the chef at Foodheads used magic to cook them so that they weren t saturated in oil. And lastly  the sprouts. I love Brussels sprouts  Uchiko sparked my addiction  and these were perfectly roasted and served with a side of garlic aioli for dipping if desired. It turned out to be the perfect dinner.   So in conclusion  if you re hungry for breakfast  lunch or dinner  only Thursday - Sunday   hit up Foodheads for a delicious treat 
FoodHeads,401,Great fish tacos  great portabella mushroom sandwich  the  Bella  .  The only problem is that they re only open til 4 pm and closed on Sundays   I love small independent restaurants in former houses - it gives it a really welcoming feel.  Great atmosphere for hanging out on the patio for hours with a big ol  glass of tea.  Also good for first dates that you want to keep pretty casual.
FoodHeads,402,I ve been meaning to hit this place up for a while now and had pretty high expectations.  I thought it was definitely above average and I appreciate a nice grilled sangie  but mine was a little boring.  I got the grilled salami  spinach and fresh mozz.  It was a little soggy w  olive oil which is not a huge deal  but more importantly it was just kinda plain.  I also tried the soup of the day  chicken and sausage  gumbo  that was pretty decent soup  but was nowhere close to gumbo  no spice  no noticable roux flavor .  The menu looks great  the atmosphere is nice and they were very fast given how crowded it was.  I ll definitely go back to try some of the other stuff on the menu  especially the one with a fried egg on it and hopefully be able to give them another star or 2.  Didn t catch any of the  tude people refer to here  but for some reason it doesn t surprise me.  Oh  parking can be a nightmare.
FoodHeads,403,Oh goodness  a sandwich shop with morals. But unlike other area restaurants that claim mantras but either never back them up or their food simply falls flat  Food Heads doesn t seem to disappoint me in that way Greenpeace always makes me feel after I walk away after a donation.  The location is adorable- located in a small house from the  40s  the entire house is filled with kitchen tables you could have used at your grandmother s house. The atmosphere is relaxed  and there is usually enough space to have privacy  even with the lunch crowd.  The menu is simple  but impressive. I usually order the Lox and Bagel  which comes with piles of salmon and sprouts all atop a warm spread of cream cheese on a crispy bagel.   My husband usually orders the corned beef sandwich  which also comes stacked with beef that could stand as tall as the Hancock Building. The sandwich is practically served with a Northern accent  and he swears it is one of the best in Austin.  In a world where places like Food Heads usually don t fit in  maybe Austin really is that weird.
FoodHeads,404,Great lunch spot    I had the Chicken w  Eggplant and it was HEARTY  amp  FABULOUS    It s one of the more pricey lunch spots but the food is delish   This place makes my stomach happy   
FoodHeads,405,It s not easy to find quality sandwiches in Austin.  From a city that specializes in tacos  it took me some time before I found a specialty shop that puts together some decent menu items.  The selection of sandwiches is wide  but not overwhelming.  Rather than throwing up every possible deli meat and cheese  they ve devised some flavorful combinations that make your mouth water and stomach rumble.  I tasted the grilled portabella and bleu cheese  which was heartier than your average vegetable sandwich  and was brought together well with the soft  chewy  toasty sourdough you envision when you think of the guys in New York who have mastered the art of breadmaking.  The pork special was tasty also  but the meat was a tad dry  and I was expecting a little more flavor from the poblano mango mayo.  I preferred the portabella sandwich to this one.  The wide selection of sandwiches will bring me back for more  in addition to the fact that the menu seems to be crafted by someone who really enjoys food.
FoodHeads,406,What a great place to go for lunch  It is a such a cute little cafe restaurant  they have real flowers on the tables...adorable  . Its a good place for a great meal with great friends.   The Grilled Squash  amp  Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich is a super delicious vegetarian meal. And for the meat lovers  The Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin Sandwich is very moist. Finally  since I am a sucker for Brie and baguette  the Roast Beef  amp  Brie Melt sandwich is super duper good.   The quality of the food is very good  since I can tell the meat and other ingredients are always fresh.
FoodHeads,407,Love it. The cute house  the friendly staff  the self-serve yummy teas and homemade lemonade...it s all great  especially the Arnold Palmer I concocted . I ordered the Apple Pork Tenderloin sandwich and it was great. Two things I would have changed  though  more meat on the sammy  and a less fluffy baguette.   But all in all...this place is a winner and I will definitely be back.
FoodHeads,408,I ve been back to Foodheads several times since my first review a few years ago and I think they deserve a fourth star. Its a great neighborhood place and if for nothing else at all  they deserve at LEAST 4 stars for the eggplant and chicken  pesto sandwich alone. Its absolutely incredible.
FoodHeads,409,This place is a pretty good place for lunch. I ordered the thai curry-soup. It wasn t what I had thought and wouldnt get again. I also ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was pretty good. All in all this place is a-okay. Worth trying something different on the menu though  I have heard the fish tacos are excellent 
FoodHeads,410,I never crave Foodheads  but yet when I come here  I m never disappointed. Got a nice honest feel. Humble and yummy.  Great for lunch gatherings.
FoodHeads,411,An associate of mine suggested we try this place. What a surprise  The food was excellent and the menu had so many choices  I had a hard time choosing  I settled on the Tilapia sandwich and it was delicious. A great find 
FoodHeads,412,Yummy  different  quirky menu that leaves you in a quandry for which item to try.  Everything we had was superb.  We definitely be back.
FoodHeads,413,Absolutely delicious food  I ve had breakfast tacos  the squash mozzerella sandwich  and the tuna and they were all great . They also have zapp s potato chips which is awesome. The space is okay but I wouldn t go there to hang out really.
FoodHeads,414,Woweee.  This was the best sandwich I ve ever eaten.  Not an exaggeration.  I got the chicken w  feta cheese on focaccia.  The chicken was cooked so it was soft and full of flavor.   No primal war of chicken vs. pulling teeth out then off the sandwich.  Not too much feta - it was just an aftertase.  I usually eschew mayo because I feel like with that kind of fat  I could have a cookie.  Um  which I did anyway.  But the mayo is made with tarragon and not just a dollop out of a Miracle Whip jar.  It was obviously made in-house.  The focaccia was fresh  - no ripping of the top of the inside of my mouth a la Captain Crunch.  Oh yeah.  And the cookie.  Choco chip.  Big huge chocolate chip.  Also  homemade.  As with any anything operating out of one of those fab old Austin houses  parking is scarce.  Also  not sure if it s the time of year for this but there s a buncha flies congregating by the outside tables.  But it s worth the battle for these sandwiches.
FoodHeads,415,Went with a friend last Thursday at 1pm for lunch. Wasn t crowded at all and I was able to find parking fairly easily. Inside the restaurant  was very cute and quaint -- loved the decor. When it came to the food  I loved all of the delicious sounding options  both vegetarian and non. In the end  I chose the roasted squash and fresh mozzarella sandwich and an iced tea. They had six different types of tea available  which was awesome  and they all looked scrumptious.   My friend and I chose to eat outside and I think that was our one mistake. It was just windy enough to have leaves blowing all over our table and food. However  our food arrived quickly and was very yummy. I also was grateful that everything was inexpensive  with almost everything on the menu under  10.  The staff at FoodHeads was pretty good  offering to turn on an outdoor fan if we were hot. When I was standing in line and ordering  they seemed a bit rushed  but not rude. Overall  it was a GREAT experience 
FoodHeads,416,After our second visit  less impressed than the first. Some sandwiches are winners  but all suffer from a giantigious mound of tough  chewy  bread  at least the Ciabatta   and even the good fillings aren t very full.  It s a sparse looking plate for 7     I came hungry and left with a hankering for Jason s Deli  and that never happens  . . .  my plate looked so lonely. . .give a brother some chips or somethin     Putting this one in my  overrated-on-yelp  bin.
FoodHeads,417,5 stars for the Grilled Squash and Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich  which may very well be a perfect sandwich.  3 stars for the Grilled Portabellas and Bleu Cheese sandwich  which was extremely greasy and kind of bland  a difficult task  considering how flavorful bleu cheese is...   1 star for the breakfast tacos that were served to me with NO salt.  Unforgivable.  And it s not a one time occurrence  as it happened to my neighbors on a different day as well.  Nice atmosphere  great patio  but given the relatively high prices and the hit-or-miss quality of the food I can t in good conscious give it more than a 3 star rating.
FoodHeads,418,I love you  Foodheads. I take out-of-town visitors to you whenever I have the chance. Your grilled squash and fresh mozzarella sandwich is amazing  and your  restaurant in  a house  atmosphere is beyond quaint.  Thanks for being consistently delicious 
FoodHeads,419,After years of wanting and hoping to enjoy a Foodhead s sandwich  it finally came to be true   And it was all it was cracked up to be. Pretty much a perfect meal.  If it wasn t 10 bucks on average for a meal and opened later  I would go every day.  I got the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  I switched to a whole wheat sunflower bread.  This was a good switch  as any whole wheat  grainy  type bread is delicious...especially when put on the griddle for a little bit.  The pork was moist and broke easily when you bit into the sandwich.  There was a ton of spinach  which I feared would not happen  but it did...and it was grand   The Honey Dijon Mustard Aioli was fantastic.  The Spicy Apple stuff was a great accompaniment to the entire sandwich  giving it a sweat heat   The only problem is the sandwich started falling apart by the end...still tasted so yummy though.  Service was great for a busy time  as they came out to take orders and get them going faster.  The tables were clean and our orders came out only about 5-8 minutes after we paid.  Very good sandwich  good service  and a perfect location.  Parking is hard  for those driving  but what do you expect for a Central-House location 
FoodHeads,420,Today was my fourth trip to FoodHeads and I felt like this trip definitely merited my first yelp review on service alone.   Service  Long story short...There was some confusion with our order which resulted in a prolong wait. While this was a bit of a let down what resulted after is what cemented my love for the place. After discovering the mix up  the waitress came back genuinely apologetic and my friend and I thought that was the end of it  we re both pretty relaxed people so apart from being hungry  the extra wait didn t phase us much . Then  the waitress returned again with more apologies and comped our meal along with a lil extra dessert added for good measure. Pleasant surprise and awesome service    Food  I got the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin Sandwich this time around. The pork was moist and flavorful  the baguette was toasted just right and all the other additions made for a great blend of flavors.   The bread pudding was delicious but this is the first bread pudding I have ever eaten so I don t have much to compare it to. Even so  I liked the well baked crisp top portion of the dessert and the underlying softer portion was good as well.  Overall   Pro-FoodHeads  atmosphere is pleasant  the food is fresh and depending on what you get can range from good to great but never disappointing and again Foodheads has definitely won me over on their service. Con-Parking is somewhat difficult on a busy day and the place can get crowded very fast  especially during lunch hours  expected of any good eatery in Austin .   Tips  Take note of FoodHeads helpful list of available parking on every table if you come often enough. The ordering at FoodHeads is order and pay inside first  find a table after and the wait staff will bring the food to you  so listen for your name especially on busy days where the noise level is up. Maybe FoodHeads will implement an order table numbering system in the future.   Enjoy 
FoodHeads,421,On the list of best breakfast tacos in Austin  these rank pretty high. These are not your trendy Tex-Mex breakfast tacos a la Taco Deli or Torchy s. These are simple and delicious breakfast tacos  with an especially nice selection of ingredients  like baby spinach  avocado  grilled poblano peppers  etc. The salsa is a little on the garlicky side for my morning taste buds  but the tacos are amazing enough to savor without it  which I do. This allows me to enjoy the fantastic coffee. Last time I checked they were using Texas Traders coffee.   I usually like the sandwiches  which are slightly pricey  but reasonable considering the gourmet ingredients and preparation  I think. The squash and mozzarella sandwich is always a winner  with olive oil soaked crusty whole grain bread. YES. I have tried all but don t love any of the the sides- potato salad  cole slaw  or bread and butter pickles. I stick with ye old fashioned potato chips  although with the size of the sandwich  I don t really need a side at all.   The inside is small and a little awkward for seating  especially when the place is hopping and the ordering line is out the door. But the patio and porch are super cute and cozy and there s plenty of seating out there. Enjoy the sunshine while sipping on one of the many ice tea flavors  and while surrounded by adorable little flower pots and plants  Cutest little house on the block.     Docked One Star  for poor sides and overly garlicky salsa. Picky  I know.
FoodHeads,422,Yum    So so good  fresh  filling and  sorta  healthy  My favorite sandwich is the squash with mozzarella and blackberry vinaigrette. I love coming here to read a book or visit with a good friend. It s a very popular place  with a line out the door during peak hours  as well as catering and to-go. Give the staff a slight break and a smile. This place is a sandwich haven  Also  their sweet pickles are a must 
FoodHeads,423,i ve never been to FoodHeads but I ve had their catered boxed lunches a few times. Today I had their chicken eggplant sandwich and it was AMAZING. Grilled chicken  pesto  eggplant  spinach  goat cheese....it goes on and on. Even the bread was delicious  I m definitely a fan and would recommend it to anyone.   The sandwich was pretty big  so I m saving the chips and enormous cookie for another day.
FoodHeads,424,Excellent sandwiches and desserts. Desserts are served in good quantities. Cobbler is great.
FoodHeads,425,The Chicken Special was really good and the potato salad that came with it was delicious.  The Key Lime Pie was lacking in the tartness department for my taste and the graham cracker crust tasted like refrigerator  if that makes any sense at all   not to mention they wanted about  6 for a slice   All in all it was really good and I will definitely be back. I ll just make sure to opt for the coconut cupcake instead next time.
FoodHeads,426,What a great find  Although it looks like a dive  it is not just any dive   not to mention being perfectly located next to amazing pizza .  The sandwiches are divine and the salads are just as delicious. You feel like you are pulling up a stool in your momma s kitchen and she s whipping together ingredients that she know will melt in your mouth and tickle your taste buds.  My advice  Pull up a stool soon.
FoodHeads,427,Bought a Lunch Deal coupon several weeks ago and was finally able to make it in today. I was not disappointed.  Love that it is in an old house - decor and ambiance are very nice - the people that worked there friendly - only thing bad is the parking. Street parking only - kinda sucks.  Now the food  I had  15 to spend - so I got the lamb sandwich - excellent flavor  great with the feta and cucumber mayo  and the sweet cukes on the side were fabulous. A bit too much fat and there could have been a little more meat  but the flavor and texture of meat were perfect. I had read about their iced teas  so I tried the raspberry mint and the black current - wonderful. I also picked up some soup to go - chicken green chile pozole  which I am eating as I write this - it to is also great - nice flavor  maybe a bit more of the chile. A bit pricey though  a small cup  I believe is  3.25  my sandwich was  8.50  with a bag of chips and the tea it came to  15.37.   The less  fancy  sandwiches are  6.50. And given what I got today  I will definitely be back to try more of their food.
FoodHeads,428,Despite what some of my friend s say  FoodHeads is one of the best sandwich shops in Austin. It s got a good Austin vibe  it s local  and it s in a house. When you walk in  you feel like a local  whether you are or not doesn t really matter. You re not at a Subway  you re in a house.   Now for the food  my repeated offense every time I go is that I don t always branch out. I always get the chicken special  because it NEVER lets me down. It s delicious  and even when I try to save half for later... it s gone within minutes of getting home.   I ve tried a few other things like their Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin Sandwich and my friends always get different things when we go. So far  FoodHeads hasn t disappointed  but I haven t found anything that I like as much as the Chicken Special  and because of this... as much as it hurts me to do this  I m giving it 4 stars. I wish I wish I could give it 4.5  alas the Yelp Gods wont allow it.   Regardless  FoodHeads is still one of my favorites  and I m pretty tempted to come back and change this to a 5.   Extra info  environment experience is always a big thing for me and food. The place is like I ve mentioned  a few times...  a house. Inside they have board games and books that you can play while you wait  while you eat  after you eat... You feel at home  and you leave happy. Every time. Guaranteed.
FoodHeads,429,What can I say  I love everything there. The atmosphere is cute and cozy  the service is friendly and prompt  though the line is long   and the food is spectacular. The fish torta and the egg salad are favorites  but there are so many more delicious sandwiches to try.   They also allow for a half sandwich half soup combo  which is a good option  though not one I choose very often because I l-o-v-e the sandwiches here too much to not consume a whole one.
FoodHeads,430,Solid Sandwiches. Go here whenever I m in Austin. I had taken my parents here when they visited from out of town. Years later  they still talk about the sandwich place I took them to.
FoodHeads,431,I have gone here for years with my daughter for lunch every time I m in town. The sandwiches and soups are always excellent  The menu is varied so there is something for everyone. Service is fast and there is always plenty of seating. An Austin favorite in my opinion 
FoodHeads,432,The mahi mahi sandwich was delicious.  It had lime slaw  avocado  onions  bits of apple I think  and cilantro.  It tased like a great fish taco  but on bread instead of a tortilla.  The side of potato salad that came with the sandwich was tiny  but tasted good.  It was mostly potato and not much filler.  They also have a good selection of iced teas so whether you like it sweet  black  or fruity they have you covered.  I wish it had more indoor seating since it is popular and there is a good chance you will have to sit outside at lunch time  but luckily today was not too hot and they have fans to circulate the air.
FoodHeads,433,This place is wonderful. Granted  a very simple idea  but that s really all you need for a great lunch place  and I m totally psyched that it s open late on the weekends now  . Every sandwich I ve had here was delicious. My favorites are the Egg Salad-Prosciutto and the Chicken Special. I recently had the Pulled-Pork and it was also sensational. Not to mention the soups are great too  It s hard to find a decent soup-and-sandwich joint where one of the components isn t mediocre. Spicy pumpkin  green bean parmesan  sweet potato...I mean  c mon  Awesome stuff.   Great out-door patio seating and a super charming indoor atmosphere. The staff is always on its game as well. I ve never had to wait too long for my food.   And where else can you choose between a Mexican Coke  a Main Root Soda  or tasty espresso  ...in Austin  maybe several places  but whatever  I LOVE FOODHEADS 
FoodHeads,434,I want to like this place more  but I ve had such mixed success with the sandwiches  sides  and soups. Nothing has blown me away and I ve been disappointed a couple times. The counter service is notably unfriendly.
FoodHeads,435,Love the design location of this restaurant. Very convenient for UT college students  I got the Pull Pork sandwich and my friend got Gypsy Grove. We split it so that we could both try the two sandwiches. I thought the Gypsy Grove was delicious. Great texture in the pork. More of a breakfast sandwich. The only downside is that it was semi expensive for such a simple sandwich. The Pull Pork was average. The pork wasn t really marinated with anything  nothing special about it  and I thought the hot sauce was a little odd though my friend loved it sandwich  Overall  this place was great  Ultimately it was worth every penny since drinks were free refills  the lemonade was delicious  and the sandwiches were better than just normal  Will come back soon   
FoodHeads,436,SO GOOD  love the people  love the sandwiches. I especially go for the squash  the balckberry balsamic is life
FoodHeads,437,Oh FoodHeads  how I adore thee. Finally a place that knows how to do healthy  wholesome  and delicious at a reasonable price. A great lunch spot for foodies on a budget and I wish so much that they were open for dinner.   I m a super big fan of soups  and they know how to do soup right. Their carrot soups are wonderful  and the Chicken tortilla soup is to die for. Best fish tacos I ve ever had.They just came out with a Tuna Steak sandwich that involves caramelized onions and avocado slices.... ooooohhhhh man  it is so good. They have really great vegetarian options too.    Foodheads  it will make you happy.
FoodHeads,438,There s just something about FoodHeads that I really like. Actually  there a lot of things about FoodHeads that I really like  the charming outdoor set-up  the rustic interior  the decidedly Austin vibe  there are not many other places really like it.  Which is why it hurts me to give this place anything less than 5 stars. As much as you can go on and on about ambiance and lighting and blah blah  it ultimately comes down to one thing  the food. I ve had some incredibly tasty sandwiches here over the years  but lately the quality seems to be suffering. It s the little things. My last visit I ordered the Tuna Nicoise sandwich -- the tuna was tasty but dry in a few parts  and concentrated strands would make some bites feel like I was licking a salt lick. The sandwich was served on french bread which was too big and made it awkward to eat. The sandwich as a whole was still very good  but these small things kept it from living up to the standard that I ve come to expect from this place over the years.  Still  even with having eaten a few less than stellar sandwiches  I plan to keep coming here and I m going to keep recommending it  although maybe not the Tuna Nicoise.  Like I said  there s just something about FoodHeads that I really like.
FoodHeads,439,SO GOOD  I love their salmon salad  fish tacos  and chicken special sandwich. Really cute atmosphere and close to campus 
FoodHeads,440,But lunch here almost every Saturday for the fam.  Decided to go with a 4  could be a 3.  Love the atmosphere and the vibe  food is good.  However  there s WAAAY too much variability in the quality and output... Sometimes I get a Bella and it s a cheese lick with no mushrooms  other times it s mushroom rich and well balanced.  Sometimes the bread is stale  other times it s fresh.  Sometimes the meat is overcooked  other times it s perfect.  Just really frustrating at times.  Oh  and they re reward program is ridiculous... Hey guy  if I buy four sandwiches that s a little more valuable than that dude who buys one... Stars are per sandwich  not per order. What a ridiculous system...  The Bella and the Squash moz are some of the best  the pulled pork is highly overrated.
FoodHeads,441,What can I say  it was just OK. I had the lamb which meant I had to keep pulling out chewy gristle from my mouth. The eggplant was not cooked properly so it was bland  chewy and spongy. Everyone else seemed to like their s but unfortunately I have to rate based on what I got. The lemonade was good. I d go back but would definitely pick another sandwich.
FoodHeads,442,Tasty sandwiches and salads. Price is average. This place is small though  there s usually a line out the door and you might have to accept sitting outside on a sunny day  or perhaps not getting a seat at all  Nice quirky Austin vibe and good service too.
FoodHeads,443,After seeing the review of the Tuna Melt in Austin Monthly I had to go try it.  It was pretty good but not near as much gooey cheese as the photo showed   I like that the tuna didn t have too much mayonnaise but if you go that route you need the extra cheese.  Bread was great   Enjoyed the atmosphere a lot too.
FoodHeads,444,My boyfriend and I just stumbled upon this place one afternoon. So glad we did. Definitely a cute place for sandwich or salad.  Just what we were looking for. We sat outside on one of their front yard tables. The weather was nice  otherwise we would have happily sat inside to enjoy our lunch. Can fill up quick.
FoodHeads,445,AWESOME spicy apple pork
FoodHeads,446,First  I want to say that I looooved this place.  Always a solid-meal that usually involved really bangin  tacos because their tortillas are way yum.  However  I think I jinxed myself.  I walked there one morning  early afternoon to most people  and was having a really good taco-experience so I said   this place hasn t missed yet.   Skip ahead two hours and I can t move off of my bed.  Poisoned. Now  I remember poking through the black beans in my tortilla and wondering if that little piece of something was bacon.  It was.   I m a really strict vegetarian so I was quite appalled and couldn t finish it.  Yet  my friend who was also munching down on some black beans  spotted some more rogue bacon  is quite the carnivore.  We both became ill so it wasn t just the stowaway pig but some other deviant agent.  Yikes.  Even though I had this rough experience there I m still going to give it three stars for nostalgia s sake.  I can t imagine going back there anytime soon but those stars are for the cute decor and the good ol  days.  I miss you Food heads.
FoodHeads,447,This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat in Austin. The staff is very friendly  the service is quick  and the food is dee-lish  After raving about it for weeks  I convinced my boyfriend  who is not a  healthy eater   to try it  and WOW-now he goes as much as he can. If you really want to experience the laid back Austin atmosphere while enjoying great food  this is the place to do it.
FoodHeads,448,Delicious soup and sanwiches. I had the half pastrami and half chicken tortilla soup and I was not disappointed.  The set up is also extremely adorable and unique  feels like I am dining at my sister s house.
FoodHeads,449,The spicy pork sandwich is disgusting. And don t be fooled by the name... spice level is a 0. Not exaggerating. Fish torta is meh. The Bella and Bleu sandwich however is out of this world. So if you go there and get that and only that you are looking at a 5-star. Great coffee too.
FoodHeads,450,I like sandwiches a lot. I also like a wide selection of iced teas. I don t like bitchy counter girls that give you the bored evil eye and are rude to my mom. I mean  really  You re working in a cute house in a cute neighborhood next to a sno cone stand and you still have a willow branch up your perfectly proportional bum  It s a shame that good sandwich shops can be so snobby. Where is the love  Let me see if I can fight through my tears and remember what I got. Egg salad on wheat bread. Yeah. It was good. Not too hard to eff up a sandwich. Let s just work on the attitude now...
FoodHeads,451,You like those American Apparel girls   The ones that are sorta hot  but sorta not   Well they all seem to work at FoodHeads and they serve the most delicious sandwiches and sides you ve ever had.  Ever in your life.  And being able to sit at one of their old shaky tables and eat your lunch with the one you love is unbeatable.
FoodHeads,452,The family visited Food heads today for a nice lunch.  It is another great Austin experience.  The soup and sandwiches are excellent and the environment very cool.
FoodHeads,453,i m a huge fan of foodheads.. i almost always order the chicken special sandwich  grilled chicken breast on toasted ciabatta with lettuce  tomato  avocado  feta cheese and tarragon mayonnaise.  aka DELICIOUS    the place is cute  if a bit small  and there s usually not a lot of tables open when i go  but i will say i m usually there during peak lunch hours.  parking can be a bit troublesome  since it s street parking and in front of a bus stop... i ve parked down the road at a large lot for businesses but then i have to walk back down the road to foodheads.  still  parking isn t always a problem  and is always worth it    reasonably priced  and always great food  and in huge portions   i ve become a huge foodheads fan  frequenting the place about once a week.. definitely worth the drive over there from west campus.  heck  i d drive to foodheads from north austin.
FoodHeads,454,FoodHeads delicious sandwiches.  I haven t had a bad sandwich here yet.  I also love the pickles and that zippy honey mustard  when I remember to ask for them .  The chicken special is yummy  and I am a big fan of the choose-your-own veggie sammy.  It is quite crowded at lunch  the service is hit or miss  and they might not have ice or glasses for water when you need them  but I do love the cute-little-house atmosphere and the relatively large amount of shaded  outdoor seating.  When you get down to it  what matters most at a sandwich joint are the sandwiches  and here the sandwiches are darn good.
FoodHeads,455,Just found this place today and I m sad it wasn t sooner. At 11 45 on a Friday the place was just getting crowded. I only waited in line for about 5 minutes and received my food 10 minutes later. If you decide to go the first thing you must try is the Apple Pork. Grilled pork loin with Apple and tomato pico  sounds crazy  right  The sandwich was amazing  This place is way out of the way from my work but I will be back for lunch soon 
FoodHeads,456,I got the Tuna melt sandwich  it was lackluster and had carrots in it.  I love carrots just not in my tuna and the melt came with a smedium ass side of potato salad. The potato salad was ok. Just eh 
FoodHeads,457,FoodHeads doesn t get nearly enough air time as they should. The sandwiches are SO good... from the bread to the spreads and all the accouterments in between. This place is on my  must go to list  every time I am in town.
FoodHeads,458,So  yes  I do think FoodHeads has the best sandwiches in Austin and possibly the best breakfast tacos. They happen to be very close to me  which is great. I love the lamb and eggplant sandwich and the gypsy grove breakfast taco. Everything else I ve had there has been pretty good also. The atmosphere is old and funky  in a good way. The people that work there are ok  definitely not bad enough to put me off.
FoodHeads,459,five stars for menu creativity.  i may have stated elsewhere that if i was an iron chef - i d be iron chef sandwich. and this place would prove to be a worthy adversary.  chances are you can t find the exact combo of ingredients anywhere else in town  unless you ask for it to be custom made.  if you re not into slaw  you can get house-made pickles instead. pretty nice in a cool and refreshing not too pickle-y way.  their specials change often as specials should  but i once had a pork with more pork sandwich that made dream about the excellent pig who died a noble death so that i could eat lunch. i d like to personally thank that pig and the kind folks at foodheads who made my lunch dream reality..... and try the  lami - it s lummy.   lami is short for salami  not a cutesie name for lamb  although the lamb is a nice sammy too. .
FoodHeads,460,Loved the hot pastrami sandwich -- hearty meat yet fresh fixings. Options for indoor or outdoor seating.
FoodHeads,461,Just so everybody knows the level of expertise going into this review  I didn t know that pastrami was beef.  I didn t know what it was at all.  So I ordered the pastrami sandwich and it was enjoyable even though it had way too much mustard on it.  The cucumber slaw was amazing  delectable  and lovely.  The variety of iced tea was very nice.  On a milder day  the outdoor seating would be perfect.
FoodHeads,462,nom  nom.   The only thing better about Foodheads than their squash sandwich is the fact that they re about ten yards from my front porch.  Today I had the Greek salad - delicious  of course  but if I were the boss I would ve put more feta on that babeh.  OMG  why did I have to rhyme that    But I m not the boss  and it was a tasty lunch  so I m not complaining. Thinking about it is making me hungry again.
FoodHeads,463,Yum  Great place for a laid-back lunch. I love restaurants in old houses and this is no exception. It s a charming  airy space. Perfect for a spring day.  Bonus points for Christmas lights on the bathroom ceiling   I had the squash and mozzarella sandwich  which I definitely recommend. Parking is a bit tough when they re busy  but it s worth it 
FoodHeads,464,I have only been here once  and I had the chicken special sandwich  which was delicious.  Everything else on the menu looks tasty and is on my  to-try  list. Nice indoor and outdoor seating and good service. It reminds me a bit of the menu at the deceased  Azul  and looks to replace it as my favorite sandwich spot  unfortunately it is a bit of a hike from home and work for me  so it will have to be a place to stop by on the way to Wheatsville Co-op or Freewheeling Bikes.
FoodHeads,465,FoodHeads is such a charming place.  The food is great  and there s not much I can say that hasnt been said.  What makes this place a 5 star for me is that you can sit outside and enjoy a good book and great tea on a beautiful day.  Traffic can make it a bit loud  but I didnt think it detracted from the food or charm.
FoodHeads,466,Adorable setting  nice staff  awesome  homemade   pickle slices  and FOUR specialty sandwiches that feature pork  I m in love. The only downside was that it got crowded around the little area where you place your order and get your drink. It seemed like a prime spot for me to run into someone and spill a drink or two  I m accident prone   but definitely no reason to avoid this place. Its a gem 
FoodHeads,467,All the sandwiches are delicious  My favorites are the chicken eggplant and the Gypsy Grove  I love the icebox pickes as the side    The salads are all so fresh and crispy  The greek is my favorite 
FoodHeads,468,Went with a couple of my friends today and ordered the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin  Fish Tacos  and Smoked Salmon Bagel.  Food  Pork Tenderloin  Yummy  Sometimes pork can be dry and stringy  but this pork tenderloin was tender  juicy  and easy to chew. The apple salsa was definitely a nice touch. Not too big of a fan of the mustard--the flavor seemed to overpower the sandwich in some places where it was spread more thickly. I wish I had been able to taste more of the apple and pork  which is what the sandwich is named for... . Bread was good--toasty and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Fish Tacos  Huge amount of food piled on top of four small corn tortillas. My friend said these were OK. Wouldn t go back again to get them. I tried a bit and they tasted very average for fish tacos. I ve had better elsewhere. Smoked Salmon Bagel  Good  fresh  light. Your average smoked salmon bagel. Alfalfa was a little overpowering  but I guess it made the sandwich taste healthier. The everything bagel was nicely toasted and chewy on the inside.  Atmosphere  Very cozy and quaint. A house-turned-sandwich shop. A good atmosphere for a quick lunch date or meet-up with a few friends. Each table inside is set with mismatched chairs  creating a very comfortable cafe feel for this place. There are also several tables to sit at outside.  Price  Reasonable. Not too cheap  about  8- 9 per sandwich   but the quality is reasonable for the price. If you re looking to be really full though  you should probably look for another place that gives you more food for cheaper. The sandwiches are very light and tasty  but might not fill up a big eater.  Other comments  Parking is hard to find. Street parking in the front for lunch  or I believe there is a parking lot on the back M-Th after 5pm and Saturday all day. I ended up parking next to Sno Beach  on 34th and Guad   but make sure not to park right in front of the pawn shop next to it  Towing is enforced   Bottom line  Would MAYBE go back again. Not too sure. Atmosphere was nice. Out of the three entrees we ordered  I would recommend getting the Spicy Apple Pork Tenderloin.
FoodHeads,469,Five of us stopped by for lunch.  Very unique menu with lots of options   I opted for a  ham and cheese on ciabatta but it came on a rather stale hamburger style bun - certainly not ciabatta   My friends all had different sandwiches and were pleased with their choices.  The lady taking orders was rather unfriendly and borderline rude but the young student delivering the food was great   Better choices for sandwiches are available.
FoodHeads,470,Finally checked out FoodHeads this week with several co-workers.  We all tried different sandwiches  and everything was fantastic.  I got the eggplant chicken sandwich  which was literally  drip down your hands  good.  Probably the best sandwich I have ever eaten   The atmosphere is very cute  comfortable  and eclectic.  We were glad we got there at about 11 40 am before the lunch rush  because as others have mentioned  the line was out the door   Can t wait to go back and try some other menu items 
FoodHeads,471,I ordered some box lunches from here last week. When I arrived about ten minutes early to pick them up  they had no idea about my order. Luckily I had printed out my emailed order to them and they turned it around in no time  I was so impressed how quickly  efficiently and politely everything was handled. Their service was fantastic and their sandwiches were a hit. We ll be coming back 
FoodHeads,472,I order from Foodhead s for our business lunches and everyone always looks forward to them.  Dorothy s Meatloaf will change your mind if you currently are not a fan of the much degraded menu item.  Also try the Pecan Crusted Chicken Strips.  The cherry cobbler should not ever  ever be passed up.  Delivery is always prompt and courteous.  Shop Local  
FoodHeads,473,Yummiest sandwiches we ve eaten in a while. A beautiful place to go along with it as well. We had the squash and the  Bella . This was in their  specials  menu. The  Bella  had portobella   blue cheese  and a well flavored raspberry vinaigrette between nicely toasted sourdough slices. The  Squash  had grilled squash with cilantro pesto on a baguette. We had the green bean parmesan soup too which we figured out later had meat  we are vegetarians . The place is very quaint with antique-look tables and the service is great. A definite must-see-visit-eat.
FoodHeads,474,Love this place. Day or night.  Cute little place with super nice folks.  The steak and arugula salad is fabulous.  The Parmesan toasts it comes with are so good.   I ve been here several times and it s always great food.  My fave place.
FoodHeads,475,First time to Foodheads. It was a Saturday afternoon and the line was long. Quite simply the vibe was great and the food was tasty and high quality but I have a big complaint. My  9 spicy apple pork tenderloin had at most 3-4 ounces of meat. The bread is big so the bread to meat ratio is high. Since I split that and had a cup of soup  I left hungry after spending something like  9 on a half sandwich and cup of soup. If I go again I will ask for double or triple meat but who knows what that will cost.
FoodHeads,476,the spicy applewood tenderloin- the way the oil and the fresh greens go in your mouth just make a symphony of awesome. the chicken portabello mushroom sandwich- i think this is the one with goat cheese  regardless of what cheese is in it  it is pretty amazing.  i loved the decor of the place  made me feel like i was in austin  a lot like salvation pizza which is RIGHT next door . I never thought that a small sandwich would be so filling. but after thinking about it some more  i realize that the sandwich is not small at all. it is packed with amazing greens and meat. im pretty sure this place is super healthy  and even if they aren t i felt great afterwards. eating a sandwich on a beautiful  this place is great even when it is raining outside  day just puts a smile on my face.  their coleslaw and or pickles were amazing with the sandwich... gah  i m hungry.
FoodHeads,477,I really enjoy going here.  I have had the fish tacos and the chicken sandwich.  I love the little side of cucumbers and onions.  Very nice venue esp outside on the porch.
FoodHeads,478,Though my friends here seemed to have had a bad time on the same day as I went  I wound up loving this place.  Vegan samosa soup made to taste like an Indian samosa    How cool is that   The atmosphere made me feel like I was in my Granny s house  the music was appropriate for the mood  windows letting in loads of gorgeous sunlight... I swear  the feng shui was all pointing to  Happy.     The sandwich choices are endless  and great for vegetarians.  I wish they d have some soy cheese options  MAJOR HINT .  Hands down  best lunch ever.
FoodHeads,479,What so amazing about Austin TX is the people  who make up Austin. This small place made the best sandwich I ever had and the cool part everything is organic. The menu always change  depending on season and what they can provide. So they always have something unique.
FoodHeads,480,Delicious sandwiches in a laid-back  outdoor patio setting all add up for a great lunch experience at FoodHeads. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich on ciabatta  which was really tasty. The rest of the sandwiches looked great as well  so will definitely be coming back again.
FoodHeads,481,This place is great  Friendly staff  counter service   unique sandwich menu with the option to customize everything  You really can t go wrong here because everyone should be able to find something on the menu that strikes their fancy. The sandwiches are huge- definitely enough to save half and eat later  or eat all of it then and be gloriously full and satisfied  . The iced teas are great. What I really like about Food Heads is the chill atmosphere in a converted little house. It s so charming  Eating outside on the porch or front yard is also an option 
FoodHeads,482,Was here with Kathy and Martie.  OMG--get the Pickles    Seriously.  Pickles  people.  Get them and eat them.  This place was not only super cute inside  the folks were really nice and the food was great.
FoodHeads,483,My coworker took me to Food Heads after she had been telling us all about the prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich for the past month. Man  it was doing the business  Really nice atmosphere even though it was crazy busy. The food was very tasty with good portions. I had the pulled pork sandwich on ciabata with a side of potato salad. I liked how the sandwhich was full of quality meat and not just all saucy.  Sometimes the pulled pork sandwhiches are sauce overload.  I liked the potato salad because it was not too gooey either but did think it could use a little more spice.  They also take the Go Local card so i received 10  off my total. Nice ice tea selection as well. The food was so fresh and tasted like it was a clean place. I wish they were open later than 4pm since i live in the area and work downtown. I can t wait to take my husband and mom next time she is in town 
FoodHeads,484,Based on the good reviews here  I went to FoodHeads on Saturday for lunch.  I loved the atmosphere  and actually thought I was in the space formerly occupied by Starlite  but that is next door.  I ordered the Salmon Salad Sandwich.  It came on the best ciabatta bread I ve ever had  soft and yummy and the salmon was delish.   The sandwich was huge.  My friend ordered a turkey and jack on sourdough  which she loved but was only able to finish half of.   It got really busy after we were already seated  and people waiting in line were raving to each other about the pulled pork sandwich.   I can t wait to go back and try more of their specialty sandwiches  soups and fish tacos.  Everything looks outstanding.  Cute and cozy outside area looked nice  too.
FoodHeads,485,i m searching for the perfect egg salad sandwich and i ve found a worthy contender at foodheads. they pair their salad with prosciutto. yes please and thank you. the sandwich is pretty popular. twice  i ve had to stomp away pouting because they ran out.   oh  also  foodheads  do you mind putting the samosa soup on the menu straight time  because it s awesome and people will love you for it.   one more thing  can you make the blackberry vinaigrette available all year round  thanks.
FoodHeads,486,FoodHeads has sat under my nose for several years and was completely off my radar screen until I read my fellow Yelpers comments.  I picked up some sandwiches this weekend and earlier today and am happy to say go ahead and believe the hype.  FoodHeads is excellent.  The locale  a craftsman just off Guadalupe.  They ve got some nice outdoor seating on the porch of this old house and in the yard.  Inside  it s cozy and while you wait for your sandwich  peruse some of the hundreds of old foodie magazines from the past 10-15 years.  I read a cool article about the last  real  French restaurant in the world  in London  apparently  as well as some recipes for some nice pureed vegetables  chestnut puree    .  But don t go here because it s nice inside.  Go for the delicious sandwiches this kitchen turns out.  This weekend we loved the Pork Special the best  and it s hard to go wrong with Pig Squared  pork tenderloin and bacon with a nice chipotle mayo .  The lamb sandwich with a  cucumber mayonnaise   read  tzatziki  and gooey feta   So tasty.  The Roast Beef with Brie topped all of those.  The fresh  crusty baguette  lathered with a bit of tasy dijon mustard and nicely-matched greens cradled a generous amount of house roasted beef  no off-site b.s. here  and warm  but not hot  brie.  Oh that buttery brie.  Any warmer and that sandwich would have been a hot mess  but at this temperature  you got a bit of goodness in every bite.  I am already planning my next visit to 34th and Guadalupe.  A great lunch choice in central Austin.
FoodHeads,487,Yesterday I ventured over to FoodHeads for lunch. I d never been there before  having recently moved here  but per the recommendation of someone I consider to be knowledgeable about Austin restaurants  I decided to give it a try. And am very  picture in bold font  happy I did  I had a 1 2 squash and mozzarella sandwich and chicken tortilla soup  and it absolutely hit the spot and left me feeling full. The sandwich had fresh and tasty ingredients  and the tortilla soup was hearty and made me feel like I was doing something good for my body. My only complaint was that it could have had a little more seasoning  which coming from me  means it could have used a lot more seasoning for most people. Combined with the good location and homey ambiance  this is a great place. Just a day later  I m already trying to get them to cater an event for the place where I work  You won t regret going here.
FoodHeads,488,I love FoodHeads   We have catered them for lunch meetings here on campus several times and their presentation is wonderful and the amount and quality of food is great   Dining in is wonderful too on a sunny day.  I can never pass up an opportunity to read back issues of Gourmet while sitting at an outdoor table in the breeze with a cool glass of flavored tea and a pulled pork sandwich seasoned with Franks sauce. YUMMY 
FoodHeads,489,This place IS Austin.  A place so small you would drive by it and not even know it existed  if it weren t for the fact there are always a ton of people there.  Its a little house converted into a sandwich shop off 34th by Salvation Pizza  another oawesome place .  They have some of the highest quality of sandwiches in Austin and a large variety to choose from.  You want a regular club   Ya  they got that  but why not try the Brazillian Steak sandwich   That get your attention   Like I said  its a small place so be prepared to stand in a line that goes around tables and chairs  but embrace the community vibe it offers.  You may not get your food in 30 seconds or less but good things come to those who wait.  Delicious 
FoodHeads,490,I ve eaten at FoodHeads on several occasions  and I loved it about 75  of the time.  The salmon salad sandwich is delicious.  Its counterpart  the tuna nicoise is not.  The mix is pretty bland and boring  and the fish tasted canned.  Also  I couldn t fit the sandwich in my mouth. Sounds weird  but it s true.  How can I appreciate all of the flavors in a sandwich if I can t fit it in my mouth    This is a problem I ve had with other sandwiches I ve eaten there.  The ingredients are often there  but the execution is not.    Buuuuut  I still like the place.  The coffee is good and it s a warm  cheerful environment.  I ll definitely be back soon.
FoodHeads,491,Yummy healthy food. Sandwiches and salads made from natural fresh ingredients. A great place to meet friends or just to hang out and study. Oak tables  lots of light  vintage books and comfy  casual ambiance. Moderately priced. Meet Chip Wendt  the owner. He is one of the nicest guys you ll ever meet and a great chef too. My go-to place near campus or downtown.  Convenience without the rush.
FoodHeads,492,Sandwich was pricier than normal but worth every extra penny.  With a carefully thoughtout list of every gourmet condiment and filling  everything inside the sandwich is a perfect complement to each other and creates an explosion of tastiness to your taste buds.  I got the squash and mozzarella and the hubby got the chicken and eggplant.  I liked mine more and he liked his more.  Will definitely add this place as a frequent lunch stop.
FoodHeads,493,Really love getting lunch here with friends  family  and especially visitors. Chill house to relax and eat  great creative sandwiches. Nestled away from campus so not too many students.
FoodHeads,494,Best sandwiches ive ever had  namely the portabella bleu-cheese and salami mozzarella.  Literally the best.
FoodHeads,495,Most delicious sandwiches ever. Most excellent lemonade too. With outdoor seating and endless refills of coffee  this place rocks my world.
FoodHeads,496,this place is really unique. The place is an old house converted into a restaurant. Great outdoor seating and the inside is really cozy. Friendly staff. I had the grilled squash and fresh mozzarella sandwich and it was DELICIOUS  they are really big though  so i would recommend sharing one. the hot pastrami was really good too.  definitely try this place for lunch 
FoodHeads,497,Love this place  It s right around the corner from where I work. Great unique sandwiches for lunch  and they just started opening early for some badass breakfast tacos  Hells yeah 
FoodHeads,498,Fresh ingredients and interesting combinations of flavors. This place is a must for a healthy meal. Great for lunch.
FoodHeads,499,A little home away from home    Way yummier sandwiches than I could ever make in my own kitchen  so I don t mind coming here to relax outside and enjoy these delicious pieces of heaven.
FoodHeads,500,This place is great. Salmon Bagel was prolly the best bagel-centered-meal of my life.
Fonda San Miguel,1,Great service  food  atmosphere  and excellent bar program.  I loved the flour tortillas  and the blue corn were good too. The queso fundido with Rajas were good. But I really loved the green avocado salsa  it was bursting with flavor. The tortilla chips and red salsa were fine. I also loved the pickled vegetables. The shrimp wrapped in bacon were cooked well  and the caramelized onions in the quesadillas added a richness. I recommend the mole enchiladas with vegetables.  Excellent tequila selection. I opted for La Gritona  and Tequila Ocho Anejo. The watermelon margarita tasted like fresh watermelon juice  delicious 
Fonda San Miguel,2,Ally  Allyson  is great and with a gorgeous smile. Grace the hostess fabulous.  As it turned out I had made the reservation for December 7 instead of November 7  our hostess grace was kind enough to still accommodate me our server Ally was as sweet as one could be  Salsa was absolutely delicious two appetizers one corn and the other one Bacon wrapped Shrimp were delicious  To be honest I did not die for Carne asada I thought it was way too salty and nothing to write home about my friends pork in banana leaf was delicious according to him I wish I had tasted some  The desserts of flan and Tres leches very good  I look Forward to my next visit in fact I have a reservation already for tomorrow as well
Fonda San Miguel,3,Break down.  -Food was fresh and soooo good. We had the ceviche which was sooo fresh  amp  amp  tasty. We had some salmon tostadas which were also very good but very small. I had the creamy shrimp dish. It was delicious  filling but giving creole vibes. I would hands down get it again though. My cousin had the sole enchiladas and subbed the beef for goat. He enjoyed his dish. My other cousin had the chicken verde enchiladas  not show   but she said hers was 10 10. We paired our food with watermelon margaritas and Paloma s.    -drinks. Drinks were very underwhelming to be honest. Margarita was very sweet and wasn t strong at all.   -service was exceptional   He came back many times to check on us. He was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and recommendations.   -aesthetic. This spot is aesthetically pleasing. Great photo oops. Bar area is sexy  Main dining room was giving authentic Mexican traditional decoration but very cute and sexy. It def passed the vibe check. I m over all I would come back here next time I m in town   Heads up. This place gets really busy. Had to make a reservation over a week out to get seated.
Fonda San Miguel,4,Fonda San Miguel is a high end Mexican restaurant worth visiting   You can tell from the quality of the free chips and salsa that the food is gonna be good. Of all the dishes we tried  I d like to highlight the Camarones al Pastor  seared shrimp marinated in achiote and dried peppers with pineapple and habanero relish . So delicious   Tender shrimp with perfect seasoning and a little bit of spice from the habanero peppers. This was one of the most delicious shrimp dishes I ve ever had   Another shout out for the tacos al carbon  delicious beef strips in a homemade tortilla.  Just writing about it makes my stomach growl for more 
Fonda San Miguel,5,I loved the decor and interior of this place  so much wall art and light gave it a little forest vibe. They hooked it up with a huge margarita and michelada that we re soooo flavorful and worth the price.  Pescado al mojo de ajo was amazing  fish tasted amazing with the side of fried veggies and hot sauce. Had a great dinner with awesome service  Will definitely be going back to try their brunch as well.
Fonda San Miguel,6,My favorite spot for authentic Mexican food. The interior design is stunning  the food is delicious  and the service is excellent.  Drinks  Their n mero uno margaritas are so tasty  and they re huge too. You definitely get what you pay for.   Appetizers  I love the ceviche las brisas and their queso fundido with handmade tortillas.   Entrees  I recommend sharing the tacos al carb n or the carne asada a la Tampique a after some appetizers.   Dessert  Make sure you leave room for dessert  You won t want to miss their unique take on tres leches cake served with mango sorbet.
Fonda San Miguel,7,I grew up eating at this restaurant. The Sunday brunch buffet  sadly not offered anymore  is linked to many fond childhood memories. My family has celebrated many  significant life events  here. Birthdays  anniversaries  and graduations at Fonda San Miguel are part of my family s collective story. It has been the number one spot to bring out-of-town guests who want to try Mexican food. It is a recommendation I can give without reservation. Every aspect of this restaurant - service  atmosphere  drinks  food - is incomparable. Every part of the experience is perfection. This could be nostalgia that brings me back year after year to Fonda San Miguel  but if anything  I think nostalgia creates higher expectations. It s hard for anything to compare to a fond memory  but Fonda San Miguel still holds the magic that it did when I was barely old enough to reach the food at the buffet.   I stopped going for about a decade. My kids were at the age that made dining out inconvenient. The age where the other diners give your family dirty looks for daring to exist in the public sphere  no matter how well your children are behaving. Now that my kids are older  we ve started going back again.   The restaurant remains  for the most part  unchanged. The main dining area is a time capsule of my youth. It attracts a very specific clientele. These are the people in search of the mythical authentic Mexican food unicorn. This is the crowd who makes me want to sneak into conversation the time I ate dinner at Diana Kennedy s house while on a butterfly tour. This is the crowd who knows exactly who Diana Kennedy is and loves to talk about interior Mexico as if it is the only real Mexico. It is full of people like me and my parents - older and still faithful. I m happy to see younger faces appearing  and gives me hope that Fonda San Miguel will continue to be successful for many more decades.   Many of the items on the menu remain unchanged  but there are new offerings as well. Have the Numero Uno Margarita. You can get fruity variations anywhere  but not many bars can consistently deliver the classic Margarita you ll find here.   They still serve complimentary chips and salsa - native Texans will remember when every Mexican restaurant brought out a basket of warm tortilla chips and salsa when you sat down  without even asking. Fonda San Miguel continues this tradition.   Most recently I had the shrimp in chipotle cream sauce. The shrimp were fresh  plump  cooked to tender perfection without a hint of rubbery texture you ll find at so many other restaurants. The heavenly sauce made me forgo my manners and had me scraping up every last bit of it. Side note - it s okay to eat rice with a spoon and a fork  chopsticks or your hands. I didn t believe it either  but look it up - Lucy Challenger s recent rice eating tutorials spawned many hilarious stitches on TikTok. Now  if you re really looking for something to debate  look into Mexico s complicated relationship with rice  but I digress.   This is the only place in town serving consistently good tres leches cake - with the cake sturdy enough to absorb the divine mixture of the three milks without getting soggy. It is served with no-too-sweet mango sorbet that reminds me of the fruit stands in San Miguel de Allende.   I recommend Fonda San Miguel to anyone without a single qualifier. Whether you are a devout Diana Kennedy fan  in the Robb Walsh authenticity-is-a-myth camp -  if this is your culture  this gringa can t speak to that - if you re an out-of-towner looking to try top tier Mexican food or just someone looking for a great food and a great experience - go to Fonda San Miguel. I promise  you ll be glad you did. If you re a native Austinite like me  and haven t been in a few decades  make the pilgrimage back. I promise  it s just as good as you remember.
Fonda San Miguel,8,When in Austin - Fonda San Miguel is a must  A fantastic experience from beginning to end and I would not change a thing.  Apparently the rest of Austin also feels the same way because we dined here on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was busy as ever. The courtyard  main atrium  and bar were full and there was a wait for walk-ins. Luckily  we had a reservation so we walked right in. When you walk in  you feel you are in Fonda San Miguel itself  the Mexican design and influence makes for an immersive experience.  Our server was friendly  helpful  and attentive throughout our dining experience. We had ceviche to start and it did not disappoint. The fish was fresh  marinated well  and one order was enough for five to share and with some to spare. I enjoyed enchiladas suizas with chicken for my entr e. The suiza sauce was delicious and the chicken was flavorful and a good texture. We shared the crepe and tres leches  my pick   for dessert and both were sinful.   Dinner at Fonda San Miguel was amazing  Slightly steep in price but definitely one to enjoy for a special occasion or nice evening out.
Fonda San Miguel,9,I love to eat here for special occasions  and more often for Happy Hour    Gorgeous interior  The entry  bar area has a skylight roof that is GREAT in a storm    They have a friendly staff  amp  AMAZING fish dishes  pork  beef  etc  too  but I ALWAYS default to the fish.  Always tasty  amp  fresh with amazing flavors.  SEVERAL margaritas to choose from  amp  work your way through    
Fonda San Miguel,10,Beautiful place in Austin for fine dining. I recommend you get a reservation especially if going in a big group as it can get pretty busy. While there we saw there was a table of about 25 people so I do believe they can accommodate big groups if given enough time.   The food itself is delicious  We shared the Plato De Miguel as an appetizer as everything on there was good. I don t really like the aftertaste that lamb gives but in this case  it was really faint. My sister likes lamb and she mentioned this has been one of the best she s had  The taquitos al pastor were some of my favorite here in Austin. The meat was good quality with hardly any fat. The shrimp had a charred taste that made them so good    For my entree I got the Camarones En Crema de Chipotle and I couldn t recommend them more  The sauce is creamy with a little hint of spice and the shrimp are cooked to perfection.   For drinks I recommend the Guava Margarita. It is not too sweet  very refreshing and pretty strong. I don t recommend the Mexican Martini  I can t decide if it was a little too sour or there was too much olive juice in it.   Great service  Overall would easily go back. 4 5 stars because I do feel it s a little overpriced for the portions you get.
Fonda San Miguel,11,I don t know how I ve never been here before  We went here for my birthday in July and it was the best dinner Mexican food I ve had in a while  I can t wait to go back and try more  The verdes enchiladas were cooked to perfection  the chicken was so tender  I also highly recommend the Al pastor tacos the flavors are so so so good   I m such a sucker for homemade tortillas and I will be thinking about these for a while  They also gave me a yummy birthday treat  Run  don t walk  to Fonda San Miguel 
Fonda San Miguel,12,The perfect place to go if you want to feed both your stomach and your photo album. This is a great spot for groups and or special occasions  but would strongly calling to make a reservation days if not weeks in advance as this place is ALWAYS busy - and I ll tell you exactly why.  The food  anything you get will be delicious  amp  authentic in taste and presentation. You get complimentary chips and salsa. When ordering  I d recommend the seafood dishes  as not a lot of places in Austin do it quite like Fonda San Miguel. The ceviche is a lovely  citrus-packed starter  no strong off-putting smells tastes . For main dishes  we usually get one or two in the middle to share as the portions are generous. Most dishes will come with a sauce and rice - both of which REALLY complement the dishes.   The drinks were strong and flavorful as well. The real showstopper  however  were the desserts. The Crepas de Cajeta are a melt-in-your mouth dulce de leches paradise  and is perfectly accompanied with the Cafe de Olla.  The place  This picture place location has an upscale summer Mexican Hacienda vibe. If you re lucky enough with your timing  you might snag a high demand table in the atrium  or one of the more intimate booths near the entrance. This place certainly lives up to its     status. There is free parking right outside  but in my experience has always been at capacity.  The service  The servers here are happy to help and immerse you in their culture. Each member we ve interacted with provided an impeccable dining experience - even down to taking our pictures.   We ll be back soon 
Fonda San Miguel,13,WOW  I have been blown away yet again. Fonda San Miguel is the perfect place for a celebration of something real special or just life  Our waiter  John  made our experience especially enjoyable. The food was great  the atmosphere is incredible  and overall this is the best Mexican restaurant in Austin 
Fonda San Miguel,14,Came here for happy hour on a work trip to Austin - what a cool place   When you walk in  you feel the vibe that is Fonda San Miguel.    When you walk into the restaurant  the main atrium area is gorgeous and full of light  during the day . This is also the area where happy hour is.    Happy hour is the way to go here   We started with the usual guac and chips  but the tacos al pastor and the ceviche was delicious    We ordered a few of these because they were so good  and the margaritas were also on point   Only slight is that I wish there was more room for larger groups in the bar happy hour area  as our group of 5 had to sit in the single-sided booth so it was a little difficult to chat.
Fonda San Miguel,15,The main bartender acknowledged me immediately and took my first order in a timely matter.  The mushroom quesadilla was good as well as my frozen marg.   However  I soon realized  after waiting a long while for the first bartender who attended to me  i thought he was my server BT  that my actual server  bartender  was the SB- he never once acknowledged me before. I had to ask the barback for service before I realized the SB was my official server.   After realizing the SB was my server  i had to flag him down to order another drink and app  he reluctantly helped me - he was LITERALLY in front of me the whole time I was there  Btw...  Granted  he was busy with tickets. However   not as busy as I am  I m a SB at a very popular and established Austin restaurant   His customer service was very rushed and unwelcoming. I felt as though I was bothering him. I work in the industry and i am very aware of what constitutes as an annoying and demanding guest- THAT of which I am not.   I m a very easy guest with zero demands and a fair tipper  if not an overtipper    I tipped super average on this visit  BTW  because of the confusing as well as unwelcoming service from the SB.   He shoved my bill towards me without a  thank you  or even eye contact  while focusing more on the patron sitting next to me who just showed up   Geeze  I might as well have been an ex who did him wrong back in 2012  lol    Anyway. Sorry to be so harsh with this review   but if this is just  who he is    then maybe he shouldn t be working at such a famous restaurant 
Fonda San Miguel,16,Nice ambience but small portions and passable food.  Not many vegetarian options. I ordered a salad that had way too much kale in it that the chef has not bothered to remove stems from  which made the whole salad taste bitter due to the sparse dressing. We got the Valentine s Day special menu dessert which was a nice touch.
Fonda San Miguel,17,Tell me how I haven t been to this restaurant in Austin  and I ve been living here for three years now  Oh my goodness absolutely fabulous. I understand why they are one of the longest existing business is in Austin  they have been open since the 70s  they opened the same year as Matt s El Rancho except Matt s is Tex-Mex and Fonda San Miguel is authentic Mexican  Yucat n cuisine.  No better time to go to this restaurant then on Cinco de Mayo  like I did there was a Mexican mariachi band playing music throughout the whole restaurant the vibes are immaculate  They started this off with some complementary chips and salsa the salsas were to die for   I would ve paid for them  We got some guacamole for the table to start as well as the queso. Margaritas of course  For our entr e we got a couple different dishes we got the enchiladas covered in the green sauce  the steak  and the pork wrapped in a leave  forget proper names . The tortillas were probably my favorite part of the meal they were so good they taste just like the ones I ve had in Yucat n. Beans and rice were good  and the steak was to die for. We ended the meal with the crepes and my heart went to heaven. The food is truly authentic I have been in the heart of Mexico and the heart of Yucat n in Valladolid and the food is up to par with the food I have had there. You can guarantee I will be coming back to Fonda San Miguel many times  it was exceptional. No cons 
Fonda San Miguel,18,Fonda San Miguel is rated one of the top restaurants to visit in Austin  especially if you are in the mood for Mexican  I d say it s high-quality Mexican  not Tex-Mex .  There is plenty of parking around within the private parking lot  and I believe there is also a valet. I would definitely make reservations if you want to dine here for dinner. We called the day of and found something a little later than what we wanted luckily.  The hacienda decor of this restaurant is a bit outdated  but I enjoyed it. From the front door exterior to the interior design  I appreciated it as one is transformed from Austin to Mexico within seconds. The main dining room  with  20 tables  was more eclectic with its paintings and lightings.  FOOD  Complimentary chips with 2 salsas  Salsas were full of flavor. We loved them.  Queso Fundido Chorizo Verde  House-made pork chorizo made with Swiss chard  3 5  I m not the biggest cheese fan  but it was nice to have this with the chorizo. It was good but not something I would recommend ordering again.  Tacos Al Pastor  Four marinated pork tacos  4 5  You cannot go wrong with al pastor tacos. The pork had great flavor without the sauce  but I had to use some of the sauce after a few bites.   Angels On Horseback  Three grilled shrimp with white cheese  jalape o and wrapped in bacon. Served with house-made escabeche.  4 5  I recommend this. The balance between the grilled shrimp and bacon was excellent  enough of both  not too much bacon  etc.  However  the real winner was the escabeche  pickled vegetables  because it was marvelous   Enchiladas De Pato  Shredded duck enchiladas topped with a poblano-spinach sauce  4 5  Interesting with the shredded duck. The meat was not dry  but rather succulent. It comes with a very creamy  savory sauce. We both enjoyed this.  Crepas De Cajeta  Crepes with a rich goat milk caramel and toasted almonds. Served with goat milk and cajeta ice cream.  4 5  There are 2 miniature crepes served in the bed of milk and cajeta ice cream. Basically  it s like empty crepes in a bed of milky caramel.  Would I come back  Yes
Fonda San Miguel,19,This place is beautiful  food is amazing and very authentic. Friendly staff.  Always busy  best to make a reservation.
Fonda San Miguel,20,This place is lively every day of the week and a crowd favorite. For that reason it gets a little loud  even on a weekday.  The food is very good and authentic Mexican food  although a little pricey in my opinion. The plate of enchiladas was  24 which is a bit steep for what you get  even with the small side of beans and rice .  The service was great and the inside is very very beautiful so you mainly come here for the experience and a nice interior to look at.
Fonda San Miguel,21,Overall a great place   Food was delicious  the almond sauce in the relleno dish was excellent. The chicken was well flavored to a point that I thought I was having beef   Good service  good environment  a bit over priced tho for smaller portions.
Fonda San Miguel,22,Carne Asada A La Tampiquena  Always a spectacular plate if you re more on the hungry side.
Fonda San Miguel,23,Being from Baltimore  there aren t many authentic Mexican restaurants around us. That s why when we were visiting Austin we prioritized finding really good Mexican cuisine. I saw Fonda San Miguel recommended on many websites so we made a reservation. The restaurant itself was absolutely beautiful  gorgeous decor and architecture. The restaurant was packed when we arrived for our 6 30 reservation but we were seated within 10 minutes. We started with the Queso Fundido and daily special Corn Souffl . Both were 10 10 amazing  The Queso came with warm corn and flour tortillas. I ordered the Relleno De Picadillo and my boyfriend ordered the Tacos Al Carbon. The Relleno De Picadillo was one of the best dishes I have ever had  Such a unique flavor profile that worked so perfectly in the dish. The Wagyu meat for the tacos literally melted in your mouth  so so tasty  Overall  it was a great experience. Taking a star off because they did not have any diet soda options and service was quite slow.
Fonda San Miguel,24,Fonda San Miguel is a restaurant I have been going to since the 80s. It recently announced the addition of new chefs and so we put it on our  must go  list as the pandemic eased.  Last night we were part of the first seating and got a very nice table against the window with a lovely view of the interior of the restaurant and beautifully lighted bar area. A bonus was being able to see the tortillas being created in the kitchen area.  We ordered guacamole and chips to start and although the guacamole was fresh  it lacked that lemony zip and spice we were expecting. We both agreed we could easily have skipped it.  My husband ordered the Cochina Pibil which was excellent. Savory pork is one of his favorite things and the dish was stuffed with it  The plantain slices were exceptional as well with much more sweetness and flavor than others we have tried.   I decided to splurge on the Pescado Veracruzano with memories of rich  tomatoes  capers  and green olive slices swimming in my memory. Alas  that will have to remain a memory because although those items were present in this dish  they were swimming in a very watery sauce that lacked that rich taste and consistency. The fish was prepared well and was very tender and fresh  but the sauce did not live up to it.  We will probably give it another try based on my husband s dish  but I think I will stick to enchiladas next time.
Fonda San Miguel,25,Very strong drinks- be careful if you re a weenie like me  They are so tasty. Great service. I was really impressed with that. Loved the Picasso s and art everywhere. It s very beautiful here. Of course the food is great. My bf was in heaven eating his relleno. Great spot for a birthday or celebration   
Fonda San Miguel,26,the number uno margarita is absolute fire. love sitting at the bar here  great vibes 
Fonda San Miguel,27,Fonda San Miguel hits all the hot buttons  Established in 1975 with a focus on interior Mexican. It a stunningly lovely resturant with impeccable service and perfectly prepared food.  Always crowded and you will have trouble parking but its worth it.  Go 
Fonda San Miguel,28,In addition to their regular menu  they have a number of plant-based options. Everything we had was delicious. And the space is special  makes you feel you ve gone far away.
Fonda San Miguel,29,Delicious  My wife and I chose Fonda San Miguel on a recommendation for our anniversary dinner  and so glad we did. We had reservations and walked right in at our reserved time. Their margaritas are the best I ve ever had  not exaggerating .  I had the Carne Asada and my wife had the shrimp with cr me Chipotle sauce. Both were delicious.  It was a little pricier than we normally frequent  but the portions were large and the quality was excellent. Will absolutely go back and continue to recommend 
Fonda San Miguel,30,Great place for excellent Mexican food in austin.  N mero uno margarita was on point and the mole and tres leches dessert wow 
Fonda San Miguel,41,A deliciously adventurous take on Latin cuisine with influences of the cultural mesh that is Austin - Fonda San Miguel champions itself for its rich flavors and busy  one-of-a-kind atmosphere.   Let s start with dessert first for this one    Tres Leches Cake  with Mango Sorbet    A VERY unique take on Tres Leches - as the Mango Sorbet adds a flavor I ve found to be uncommon with the cake... BOOM  The bright  fruitful flavors stemming from the mango accent the three combinations of milk in a sweet - yet neutralizing  amp  cool twist. This was a favorite for our table. Highly recommend  Crepas de Cajeta   As an avid Cajeta-choice-of-dessert-chooser  I found these crepes to be absolutely mouthwatering. The cajeta drowning the smoothly crafted crepes could be a tad bit sweeter in my opinion  but it still tasted like the flavors back home  If you like rich  delicacy crepes  this dessert may be right for you    Flan de Almendra   As the third best dessert out of the three that we chose  we were all still highly impressed by the deliciousness presented to us in the gooey-like consistency that is flan. Highly recommend if you re a flan-advocate. Flanvocate .. and lover of almonds  However  the other two desserts were a bit more unique in my opinion. It s up to you  Alright - now let s go entr es.   Tacos Al Carbon   Tacos Al Carbon are always a consistently solid choice  FSM does a great job in executing them with top-tier carne  however  my opinion is this  FSM offers a variety of unique flavors in their other entr es that are highly distinguished - so  if you can t eat everything  be picky and try some of their more elaborate flavor expeditions  Still  if you re a T.A.C. fan - go ahead   It s great  Cochinita Pibil   Honestly  simplicity sometimes wins it all - and this entr e seems to prove that. A Yucatan-styled meal of pork baked in a banana leaf. Absolutely breathtaking. This is definitely a mastered flavor that you can t find everywhere.. Highest recommendations here. Enchiladas   Enchiladas are always a great option  however  I d still recommend aiming for more of their unique flavors like Cochinita Pibil  Pollo en Mole Poblano  or just getting extra servings of Angels on Horseback  Pollo En Mole Poblano   Another absolutely delicious dish  If you re new to mole and enjoy interesting tastes - I d highly recommend making the jump to adding this guy to your bill. If you re a mole regular  this one right here is quite unique  Not too spicy  not too sweet - just right  A perfect combination of flavors seasoning a delightful serving of chicken. Second to only the Cochinita Pibil in my opinion  All the appetizers are fantastic - so I ll just skip to a highlight    Angels on Horseback   Three MASTERFULLY-grilled shrimp with white cheese  jalape o and wrapped in bacon. Served with house-made escabeche. Enough said. This seemingly tex-influenced dish sure is hearty. I d highly recommend it for a large party wanting to try some flavors on  Alone  Well  this and one other dish may just be enough to fill you up. Just be sure to make room for dessert  FSM can be crowded - both times I journeyed there  it was rather packed  however  it may be worth the wait. Reserve ahead of time to jump that line  A few other things to note  if you re a fan of taking on flavor expeditions  this is a great location to accrue a hefty bill - the drinks are just as fantastic as the meals  Treat yo self 
Fonda San Miguel,42,Amazing service. Amazing atmosphere. Amazing food. I had a group of 13 celebrate my birthday here and can t say enough good things about it. I got the tacos Al carbon and they were insanely good- not to mention the tortillas...criminally good too. The spicy margs are 10 10. Also  our server was attentive and kind  Love it here
Fonda San Miguel,43,An Austin staple I finally got to check out this past Christmas Eve and all I can say is why did I wait so long  First and foremost this restaurant is beautiful from top to bottom and really brings an elevated experience to Mexican cuisine. Now let s move on to the food. There s a lot of traditional dishes on the menu but if you see a whole section dedicated to Rellenos you know it has to be good. I went with the Relleno de Picadillo and my partner went with the Ancho Relleno San Miguel. Both dishes were outstanding and packed with bold flavors. We washed everything down with the Numero Uno margarita which was a great compliment if your into tequila. The service also was friendly  amp  attentive which is always a delight when the food is as good as it is here. What a memorable experience and can t wait to celebrate my next special occasion here.
Fonda San Miguel,44,Amazing environment with amazing food  The bar and environment is very cool. We had great and quick service on a Friday evening.
Fonda San Miguel,45,What an unexpected treat we had last night   The vegan menu at this restaurant is amazing. It s flavorful  filling but doesn t leave you feeling heavy. The chef made us a vegan ceviche which was not on the menu  it was a great unexpected surprise.   By the time we got to dessert we were so stuffed that we couldn t fit the bread pudding in. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu 
Fonda San Miguel,46,Went here recently for dinner with my husband and really enjoyed  We didn t have a reservation but were able to find plenty of seating in outside  but still inside  area. This is a great place to take your family  it had a wide array of options and cozy atmosphere.  We loved the chips and salsa they brought out  whatever that green salsa is is delicious. We also tried the queso and it was nice and cheesy. I got the ceviche but it fell a bit flat for me  was more mellow than flavorful. My husband got the lamb that is wrapped in some kind of paper and we both agreed that was the kost delicous  Fall off the bone yummy.  Service is also really good  would come here again.
Fonda San Miguel,47,Ambiance was beautiful. The staff was amazing. Our waiter could have checked on us a little more. Food was delicious  I will definitely be back 
Fonda San Miguel,48,Great service  great food  great music  great drinks  great atmosphere    Amazing art collection  food and drinks were fantastic    This place is true austin Gem  Everything about experience was perfect 
Fonda San Miguel,49,This place has the most amazing food. Our waitress America was amazing and the dishes she recommended were to die for....we had the Chile Relleno and the Chile Ancho Relleno. If your in the area or not this place is a must visit restaurant  Coming back for sure in 4 weeks for my son s birthday. American  hope to see you again 
Fonda San Miguel,50,AMAZING    Food is top tier  Decor is gorgeous   Must go  Found it through Tik Tok and it did not disappoint  Hands down the best food my friends and I have had on our trip to Austin. It s about 15-20 minutes away from downtown Austin but you will not regret the drive or Uber there.
Fonda San Miguel,51,I d love to share that Antonio was an excellent server at this restaurant  Not only was he extremely knowledgeable  but the customer experience was top notch by him. We felt taken care of the entire time. If you get a chance to meet Lauren the restaurant manager say hi  she does a wonderful job managing the place 
Fonda San Miguel,52,We had high hopes for our birthday celebration evening. First  we weren t aware that the inside room is now for private events. Then  they wanted to give us a corner table by the exit. I mean - we told them it s my birthday and we were there mostly for the beautiful ambiance. When I picked an empty table in the center of the room  the hostess told us she doesn t want to overload that server. Fair enough. 3 minutes later that table was given to another couple. What     Alright  we didn t get a nice table or much of a view  but the food was supposed to be excellent though  Well  I was told they actually have only two vegetarian items - the enchiladas and the stuffed zucchini. The online menu was different  outdated   and had a couple more vegetarian options shown. We place our order at 6 38p and wait. 20 minutes later they bring us ceviche and veggie enchiladas - only we ordered lamb chops not ceviche. We told the runner to at least leave behind the enchiladas but he refused to do so. 15 minutes later the server came by and told us that she fat-fingered our order but they ll bring it out as soon as the lamb is ready. 42 minutes later the order finally comes out with no apology whatsoever.   Soggy enchiladas was the least of my worries when the food was finally served - the verde sauce was tasty but the veggie stuffing was the grocery store frozen standard of peas  carrots  potatoes. There was no creativity or flavor  besides the sauce.   Poor service - no water refills. Needless to say we skipped dessert  even on my birthday  but got held back another 15 minutes to simply find our server and pay.   It s sad when a place has so much legacy but there s no care put into consistency or continuity. We had heard so many amazing things about Fonda from Austin natives  but they must have been commenting on its past heyday. What a disappointing birthday for this Yelp Elite 
Fonda San Miguel,53,Interior mexican at her finest. I recommend the Ensalata Arrojado. Ask if they will toss your salad table side. Get them to dump extra cream sauce on it. Its good and salty  especially with the capers. It s a little messy in the end  but you won t regret it.
Fonda San Miguel,54,Awesome place to go to in Austin  Food is delish and service is phenomenal  They re always busy and full so reserve ahead is highly suggested. We will definitely come back 
Fonda San Miguel,55,As you walk  i was taken away by the beautiful decor and all the plants  Everything was absolute delicious. My favorite was the quest and homemade tortillas. I usually prefer corn tortillas but their flour tortillas were so amazing that I didn t even touch corn tortillas.
Fonda San Miguel,56,Drinks of course excellent.  Calamari not so much.  Most apps on point.  Carne Asada scrumptious.  Spicy shrimp bland as possible.  Desserts perfect but bring your wallet for this POTENTIALLY special dinner 
Fonda San Miguel,57,Overall I think this is good one-time dining in ATX. Upon entry you re taken aback by the beautiful atrium and decor  especially with the daylight and the decor throughout is gorgeous. However the drinks were subpar  we ordered the silver coin  and the numero uno margarita. The food was okay nothing spectacular the way reviews have hyped it up to be. The best item is the tres leches and the waitress Diana is AMAZING AND SO KIND 
Fonda San Miguel,58,Was recommended this place by a coworker for a business dinner and will definitely be coming back to say the least  The ambiance and architecture is absolutely stunning  you walk into a beautiful main entry way with a fountain and it feels like you re in Mexico. Ordered the shrimp and a margarita and both were delicious. The creamy chipotle sauce on the shrimp was to die for  A bit smaller portions but definitely worth the money.
Fonda San Miguel,59,Went to this place when I visited Austin for the first time. Hands down best food. Even the dessert was great  Would definitely come back whenever I visit Austin again.
Fonda San Miguel,60,Upscale Mexican food marginally worth the price. Yelp prices are currently inaccurate   We paid  45 for the carne asada and  35 for the lamb  about 1.5x what you see from Yelp .   We got numero uno margs which were very sweet but tasty. The beef in the carne asada was sliced thin  but still incredibly juicy. Even inside the tortilla  you can taste just how tender it was. The guacamole was also surprisingly good. The chunks of pepper and onion were bursting with flavor and tasted great with everything. Lamb was fall off the bone tender and was a healthier serving. It s definitely a finer dining experience  so be prepared for the price.
Fonda San Miguel,61,I really enjoyed this restaurant  this is a well established restaurant for many years  and it is evident why it lasted so long  great food  beautiful ambience  and wonderful staff they were really friendly and accommodating. It is a great restaurant to enjoy with family and friends.
Fonda San Miguel,62,Simply an amazing restaurant. Beautiful atmosphere and delicious food. Sit on the atrium without a reservation 
Fonda San Miguel,63,Absolutely beautiful interior.  But do you want to pay top dollar just for a restaurant s decor   Most of us would not  but Austin is becoming the kind of town where many will.   Our table had ceviche.  Some of us liked it  my wife and I did not.  I d say the word that best described it was...  limey .  Really couldn t identify any of the seafood in it  as everything just tasted like limes.  And much of the seafood in it was rather rubbery. I had pork mole enchiladas  and I thought they were excellent. I did feel they were pretty scant on this filling  not much meat  but the mole sauce was one of the best I ve had in Austin  and it is what I have usually ordered at a Mexican restaurant for the last 30 years.  Very nice balance of all the different ingredients typical to a red chile mole  and also very light.  Not overly greasy the way many mole sauces in Austin tend to be. But my biggest complaint about this place is the lack of great beers.  They only carry Mexican beers  and not even the best ones Mexico has in my opinion.  I asked a manager about this and he explained that it is because they are a Mexican restaurant.  Wow.  Thank you for that.   Of course that doesn t explain their wine and liquor list.  Is it all Mexican    So not the place to go if you want a great beer with your dinner  whether it be enchiladas or not.
Fonda San Miguel,64,Went here for a work party  had pretty high expectations based on everyone. Food was mediocre  margs were decent. Great service.   Probably wouldn t go back on my own dime
Fonda San Miguel,65,We were meaning to try Fonda for several months finally got a reservation and thoroughly enjoyed it  From the great drink menu  to the tasty salsa and great selection of authentic Oxacan food you can t go wrong 
Fonda San Miguel,66,Great place for Tex Mex. Upscale and refined dining. Dress code is relaxed smart casual  and it s a bit of a splurge but worth it for the atmosphere.
Fonda San Miguel,67,This place was great  I LOVED the food. Everything was soooooo tasty. I had a ceviche as an appetizer and it was almost a whole meal and was sooooo good. Then I had shrimp as the main meal and it was sooooooo good. Honesty  everything was excellent from food to service. I don t live in the area but I m glad I went.
Fonda San Miguel,68,Always fantastic. My mom requests that we go here every time she visits town.   Great waitstaff  great drinks  great atmosphere  amazing food.  My favorites are the Chile Relleno San Miguel. It s a baked Relleno instead of fried  and the sauce that it is served with is out of this world.   Their Queso Fundido is also some of the best I ve had.
Fonda San Miguel,69,Had high hopes for this place  to start off the wait time was 45 even after having a reservation. Our waiter was so ugly to my friend after she mentioned she had a husband  he was trying to get her number and she turned him down  then the worst of all  this  50 plate was so over cooked the meat was black. Really wanted to like this after seeing the TikTok s and good reviews.
Fonda San Miguel,70,Typical good brazilian Steakhouse  that is great everytime I visit.   That is all you need.
Fonda San Miguel,71,Striking is the best word to describe the decor of this restaurant. Once you enter  it feels as if you have been transported to a Mexican village and you forget you are in Austin. It is a huge space with tons of seating  but they are a local favorite and most nights the tables are completely taken so do yourself a favor and make sure you secure a reservation. The only downfall is the limited parking  so you may have to stalk the parking lot and the adjacent lot as well. They serve you salsa and chips like all Mexican restaurants  but I am picky about my chips as I like the thick ones that taste as if they were just made and these were served with the ceviche  very fresh and delicious . I requested more for the table with salsa and our waiter made it happen. We also had the enchiladas suizas and the camarones en crema de chipotle and both were incredibly delicious  I love tres leches and sadly  not every Mexican restaurant can get it right  but Fonda does it perfectly  Except I do not like fruit on my cake.
Fonda San Miguel,72,DELICIOUS     A must-visit in Austin. My husband doesnt even like Mexican food and he loved this place  He already wants to plan another visit back  The lamb chops  chipotle shrimp cream  and watermelon tequila drink was our favorite 
Fonda San Miguel,73,El Mago   12   4 5  Strong and Fruity. Pepino Pica   13   5 5  Slightly spicy margarita with quite the punch.  Calamares   13.95   5 5  First order came out lukewarm  probably because all the appetizers came out at once. Our server noticed and took it back for a fresh second batch without any trouble at all.  Second batch came out fresh out the fryer  hot and crispy. Tons of flavor on the breading and the squid wasn t overcooked. Comes with both the head rings and tentacles. The spicy mayo based sauce that comes with is also amazing and cuts down on the grease. Cordero   15.95   3 5  The four lambs were cooked to a nice medium rare and was super juicy. Unfortunately  there was a lack of salt to bring out the lamb flavor. Ceviches las Brisas   16   5 5  Been a while since I ve had straight up traditional ceviche. This is it  the classic no frills  clean  traditional ceviche. Comes with homemade tortilla chips that beat your typical Mexican restaurant chips. Nice vinegar flavor with soft fish.  Cochinita Pibil   24.95   5 5  Very soft pork wrapped up in a banana leaf. This is a flavor bomb in your mouth. Comes with two unique salsas  and some housemade tortillas that were very good. Even the rice and beans were delicious.  Service was outstanding  portions were large  we had enough left over for lunch the next day . If I had to complain about anything  it would be  1  happy hour is only in the atrium and bar  something they don t tell you unless you ask  2  the table next to us was offered dessert on the house for their anniversary but we weren t offered the same for our anniversary  which we marked on the reservation. But these really didn t matter because  1  we didn t order anything on the happy hour  2  we were too stuffed for dessert anyway.  tl dr  Everything was amazing. Get the ceviche  calamari  and cochinita pibil for sure. Portions are generous and service is great 
Fonda San Miguel,74,The food is good  but the real draw is the atmosphere. The building itself and all the artwork were great. My wife got the chicken enchiladas and I got the pork. Both were tasty  I d probably get the same thing again if we returned. The drinks were good  but a little pricey. We didn t make reservations  so we sat in the bar area. The tables were packed in there so tight  I was basically elbow to elbow with a person at the table next to me.  Make sure to call ahead for a table if you want more space.
Fonda San Miguel,75,This has been the best Mexican Restaurant my husband and I have tried in Austin. The service is incredible  ask for John as your server and you won t regret it. Desserts were out of this world... the cajeta crepes and the dulce de leche are super delicious  and they even have a gluten free  sugar free dessert that was also amazing considering it was zero sugar. For main course I had the Pescado a la Plancha and it didn t disappoint  oh... don t forget about the lamb ribs for appetizer... so tender and juicy. Now go ahead and make your reservation because you might have to wait a month.. enjoy 
Fonda San Miguel,76,We went here for happy hour a few days before Thanksgiving and the patio was packed   We made the mistake of only ordering one appetizer with our drinks.  It seemed that there was only one waiter for the entire patio  so it was impossible to get some more appetizers ordered without waiting forever.  When we were able to get the waiter s attention we paid the bill and left.  The appetizer we did have was delicious  I only wish we could have ordered more 
Fonda San Miguel,77,Absolutely the BEST Mexican restaurant in Austin    Eat here you will not regret it. This is where I wanted to eat for my birthday  so we made a  reservation the day before  drove 5 hours and got a hotel just to eat here the next day on my birthday. Yes  can you tell I love this place  The Enchiladas verdes are my favorite and the tres leches cake is delicious. My two youngest always share a plate of tacos al carbon and they LOVE it and husband enjoys the Carne Asada a la Tampiquena. FYI  Try to make a reservation. But if not possible  try to show up closer to when they open because you will have to find an available seat.
Fonda San Miguel,78,Beautiful restaurant. Very upscale. Everything on the menu is delightful. The ambience is unlike any other Mexican restaurant in Austin.  We always order Camerones and they were fantastic here. More than food...it s an experience.
Fonda San Miguel,79,We ordered two numero uno margaritas  Enchiladas de Pato  Pescado al mojo de ajo  and tres leches cake.  Wow     Loved both salsas  especially the green one  served with chips.  Can t wait to come back  
Fonda San Miguel,80,The food is delicious  Came here recently with out of town visitors and we were all blown away by the unique menu  flavors  and excellent food. The building is historic and beautiful and the artwork and decor adds the perfect touch to this terrific restaurant.  Our group ordered 2 different rellenos  pork enchiladas with cream sauce  mole  vegan squash soup and the caramel ice cream and crepes for dessert. Top notch.
Fonda San Miguel,81,My first time at Fonda SM with a friend of mine who raved about it. I had been looking forward to a topnotch Mexican dinner. First  my friend was going to make reservations online. Not an option for parties of 2. It is necessary to call after 3 30 pm to see if there are any tables available for 2. I called and made the reservation for the coming Saturday  April 23. The only times available were 5  5 30 or 8 pm. I chose 5 30 pm.    We arrive to find the parking lot completely full and had to park next door. We are greeted at the reception desk by a young woman who can t find our reservation. She asks for my phone number and finds that it had been scheduled for the following Saturday. Fortunately  there was a table for 4 that was available for us. A young man  not so friendly  seated us and gave us only one ipad to review the menu.   While we were perusing the menu  a sweet Mexican woman served us chips with salsa and brought us water. We followed the waiter s suggestion and  ordered the watermelon margarita.  It was served in an 8 oz wine glass.  I have never been served such a small margarita  especially at a Mexican food restaurant.  Although it tasted ok  it was frozen and had very little alcohol.   Next  we shared the guacamole and the Betabel  beet  salad. The guacamole portion was for one person and had more tomato than avocado. Meh  We had to hunt for the 2 beet slices hidden under fresh romaine lettuce in the beet salad. It was good but it was not a beet salad. We then shared the cauliflower mushroom enchilada with refried beans. Gag  All I could taste in the enchilada was the cumin. The refried black beans were blah. No fat lard flavor at all. For dessert  we shared the flan. A very thin slice that was delicious. We had 3 appetizers  2 margaritas and 1 flan for  89.00 plus tip.  Our waiter was experienced and overly attentive. I felt that we were being rushed in order to turn the table. Also  it was extremely noisy. We could hardly carry on a conversation. Needless to say  I have no intention of returning. Overrated  way  way overpriced  small portions  skimpy drinks.
Fonda San Miguel,82,Great authentic Mexican food. Food was great and the service was 5 stars. I would definitely return
Fonda San Miguel,83,What a great restaurant    I was meeting a friend for her birthday.   The meal and experience were both fabulous. The queso fundido with chorizo Verde was perfect and the fresh tortillas they served with it were the perfect pairing. Then I had the Chicken and Pork Mole Enchiladas. They were wonderful. When they found out it was her birthday  the offered us the Volcano cake with plantains.  What a great finish. I highly recommend this restaurant  
Fonda San Miguel,84,We convened here for a work dinner one evening.   Parking is extremely limited. There is valet parking - check with the Valet Attendant on cost - I was surprised at the answer...  -   The place is huge on the inside. We had a reservation in a room in the back. The salsa and salsa verde was the tastiest I ve ever had - it was really good  For dinner  I ordered a pork dish that was served in some sort of leaf wrapper - the item was not listed on the normal menu - it was a special for that evening - so I am not even sure what it was called. But it was damn tender and very tasty. My Margarita was also enjoyable.  Service was good.  The only thing I will ding them on - for such a huge restaurant - their Men s restroom is one of the smallest restrooms I have ever seen.   FondaSanMiguel
Fonda San Miguel,85,I went here over the weekend with my partner for a special occasion and was underwhelmed by the food and ambiance.   While the entrance and foyer were impressive  the dining room itself was standard. Normally  I would ve been happy with the dining room had the pictures of the restaurant not been misleading.   For food  I had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas  and while the chicken was tender and flavorful  I was disappointed in the mole. My partner had the Tacos Al Pastor and was please but thought the portion was small compared to the price.
Fonda San Miguel,86,It is just breathtaking in here. I m a little embarrassed to say I was drawn in by the ad on the PBS station - but it is truly an amazing space. You feel transported.  It is pricey  but for what you get in terms of deliciousness  even without the ambiance   - you won t begrudge the bill. The Ceviche las Brisas was perfect  the Cordero  mini lamb chop  appetizer is amazing  the duck enchiladas - also amazing  and the Ancho Relleno San Miguel is absolutely transcendent. That cilantro cream sauce...   Ach - top to bottom  this place. Ten stars.
Fonda San Miguel,87,We held our wedding rehearsal dinner here. The restaurant is very beautiful. The food is top notch and there were no problems serving a party of 34. We were served and finished within two hours without feeling rushed.
Fonda San Miguel,88,Beautiful decorations  Stuff for more than attentive. The calamari is exquisite  The lamb chops are a must  The chips and queso are incredible with a choice of red or green. The deserts are delicious.
Fonda San Miguel,89,I love FSM  First  the exterior decor and entrance is striking - and the restaurant has a Mexican hacienda feel to it  bathrooms have la loteria inside which is fun and the artwork scattered across the restaurant is cool.  My favorite dish is the tacos al carbon and i have to say one of the highlights of Fonda San Miguel are their homemade tortillas - even the flour ones are fantastic  have a Monterrey feel to them.  I also like that they have a menu item named for Tampico  which is the most expensive thing on the menu haha so I was not able to try it.  I think the service is great an always have a nice evening here with excellent food.  Overall Fonda San Miguel is one of my favorite restaurants and would be high on my list of places to take friends family visiting
Fonda San Miguel,90,Just a lot more like a mega-Tex-Mex venue than I d thought. The entry courtyard is very authentic  but the main dining areas are cavernous. Food is ok  but not what reviews led me to expect
Fonda San Miguel,91,This place came highly recommended.  A very unique menu.  We ordered the Duck Enchiladas  they really lacked in any type of flavor.  The cerviche had nice chunks of fish but was still so-so.  The shrimp in the spicy sauce was very good.  It was not spicy at all  had a nice cream sauce that was not overwhelming.  Food wise  I would have given three stars but the atmosphere and beautiful artwork deserves its own star.  Good cocktails   The Silver Coin is a watermelon infused margarita  no salt - light and refreshing.  Friendly wait staff.  Very COVID safe  watched the staff wipe down tables and seats when turning over the table.
Fonda San Miguel,92,This was my second time visiting this restaurant  and the food and the drinks were great. Our waiter was very attentive and responsive and provided excellent service. However  the hosts at the front could be nicer and more helpful. We arrived about 15 minutes after opening and the one gentleman was very dismissive and told us we had to wait anywhere from 30-45 minutes for a table inside  which was understandable. When we asked if they would take our number to text  he said no. They were very short and not helpful with information. We waited at the bar and had some drinks. An hour later  we went back to check in and they said it would be another 30-45 minutes even though people that were there after us were being seated. When I asked why longer  he did not respond and kept repeating the wait time. While I understand it is a busy time  it would be nice for the staff at the front desk to have a better system and acknowledge people with kindness. This restaurant seems like a nice place for the service to lack in such a way. It really makes us not want to go back.
Fonda San Miguel,93,Gorgeous place and delicious food   Great for special occasions or date night  Cant wait to go try their brunch  The Paloma and MeXican Old Fashioned were amazing.
Fonda San Miguel,94,Austin staple and great Mexican food and ambiance for a date night or to bring guests  I like their vegetarian option with squash Calibasa. Service is also very good. Make reservations 
Fonda San Miguel,95,I am so disappointed in this place. Not only did the waiters never come back after the first drink but my water glass was left empty for majority of the night. This place is disgusting. I can t believe the service me and my group were treated so disrespectfully. I would never recommend this place to anyone besides to come and look at how disappointed every single customer is. DISGUSTING.
Fonda San Miguel,96,I d do anything to get out of my zip code these days and Fonda San Miguel offered us that reprieve from the monotonous.  Take a step into the la hacienda style restaurant and you re automatically transported into beautiful Mexico.  The atrium is colorful  bright  and welcoming. Their dining rooms are equally elegant  and vibrant.  We made a  huge  mistake of not setting up a reservation beforehand and they are booked up nightly.  When this happens they give the atrium and the bar a  seat yourself  window.  But it is equally as booked and with people clearly standing around waiting like vultures for you to get up and leave so they can take your spot.  As the new set of vultures we split up.  I stood in the atrium while my boyfriend stood near the bar.  A divide and conquer sort of plan.  Fortunately we didn t have to wait long but there were other groups of 5 and 7 that waited close to 2 hours before a table opened up.  We were able to get a table off to the side that wasn t in the open.  It wasn t wonderful to connect in such a beautiful setting.    Fonda San Miguel is traditional Mexican food and if you re a tex-mex lover like myself  you might me a little nervous.  However  every dish we had was delicious.  I had a couple traditional margaritas and they were so yummy   We both ordered enchiladas and I recommend the suiza style best.  It was so so good   If you want to take a couple hours out of your time to feel something outside of your norm  while also getting a delicious dinner out of if  this is the perfect choice for you   I have already made a reservation to go back   Their restaurant is handicapped accessible  covid 19 tolerant  and the restrooms were clean.
Fonda San Miguel,97,Came here for a team dinner and was not disappointed.   The exterior and interior is magical with the soft lighting and all the natural plants    Pork shank appetizer was amazing    Enchilada Suiza was creamy deliciousness.   Ceviche was freshhh    I d happily go here again    Price point isn t   more like   
Fonda San Miguel,98,Mexico interior menu with great apps and a fun vibe. Plan to wait or troll for a bar area seat to snap a quicker place to be served. My partner and I enjoyed the Fundidos with Chorizo and chard  comes with fresh hand-sized warm  blue corn tortillas ...superb  Then chicken tinga quesadillas  yummy and enjoyable. Then we shared the lg. bowl of Sopa de Elote. Our drinks were homemade sangria  excellent  amp  house margaritas...good. We were full and didn t order any entrees but didn t need to either. Service was excellent at the bar with grea recommendations throughout our stay.  Just go  you ll not regret it 
Fonda San Miguel,99,Favorite mexican spot in austin  Authentic food and vibe. The owner is a real artist and you can tell from the decoration. The place is stunning and service is always on point.  Love it 
Fonda San Miguel,100,Been looking for authentic Mexican food in Austin and I m very happy I found this place. Super high quality food here - highly recommend 
Fonda San Miguel,101,So I am kinda disappointed by this place. We went there 20 mins after the restaurant opened  and there are already full of ppl. I am expecting something really good to worth the nosiness  crowds and the price. Everything looks beautiful  and the guy who served us was super super nice. Except the cake I liked it  all the food are just ok. If I went to somewhere cheap and I got the food like this  I wouldn t complain. But all those worth 100 bucks  they should have done better.
Fonda San Miguel,102,Great food  We enjoyed everything we ordered. The service was also really good. Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable and the food came out in a timely manner.
Fonda San Miguel,103,What happened  This has been our favorite go-to upscale Mexican restaurant  dependably great food and service. But on our last visit  the waiter didn t know what a floater was on a margarita and after saying what tequila we wanted told us we could choose from 3 or 4 brands I had never heard of. What   One of our party ordered the duck enchiladas  which had been stacked and wonderful  but got regular  smallish rolled type. Our Camarones Verdes  an off menu item  were OK  but not the same wonderful sauce we have always had. And they had removed the lovely center table full of decorative vases and replaced it with more dining tables. Yuk.
Fonda San Miguel,104,First time to Fonda San Miguel. We went with friends for lunch brunch on Sunday noon.  First   the ambience. It is upscale Mexican. Very old school tasteful  with an authentic color palette and some impressive chandeliers. Interesting selection of eclectic artwork - some original pieces and not just bullfight posters. Truly delightful.  The service was outstanding. Our waiter was helpful  funny  and supportive. When one of of number was somewhat disconcerted by her entree  he offered to replace it. The food was warm to hot when it came out  we never lacked for full water glasses  and dishes were cleared with alacrity.  They do observe faithfully the COVID protocols. We were well distanced from other diners  the rooms were not overloaded  and masks were prevalent.  Food. I had Huevos Motelanos  a Yucat n derivation. Two eggs over easy on black beans and tortillas  with sweet peas and ham. The sauce treatment was unusual  sweeter than you might expect. It was complex  with some light  sweet nuances balanced against the richer  dryer black beans. It came with fried plantains  a little dry  and a side of a potato and cheese dish   rich .  My partner had the Ancho Relleno San Miguel  one of the massive ancho pepper ever seen stuffed with chicken  olives  almonds  and capers. Baked. The sauce was smart and subtle - cilantro and lime in a light cream I tasted and was impressed  she was very pleased. For shareable  we had tacos al pastor  always my favorite  and they didn t disappoint. In fact  I might rather have had those as my entre.   My Bloody Mary was one of the best I ve ever had. Her mojito  was good but could have been sweeter  a personal predilection .   One of our friends had the Pollo en Mole Poblano and was very . . . surprised.  First  it is half of a good sized chicken  roasted nicely  so there s a lot there. She wasn t expecting the nature of the mole. If you have never had any  it can seem oddly over the top. I got a taste and enjoyed the rich complexity of the chocolate mixed with the poblano. It complemented the chicken and smothered the rice  and that s ok  rice should be smothered . There was a chocolate bitterness on the back palate  but  if you like mole  this is a good one.  We left stuffed. Now  almost five hours later  I m still full.   If you like authentic but slightly experimental Mexican cuisine  this place is for you.
Fonda San Miguel,105,Celebrated my daughter s 20th this evening.  Food was amazing but the service ice was outstanding.  MAURICIO was so accommodating and kind.  Enjoyed our dinner and celebration.  Thank you 
Fonda San Miguel,106,The entry for this restaurant is absolutely majestic and looks beautiful. And that s that especially if you are a vegetarian. Turn around and head to some other Mexican restaurant. There is nothing on the menu that s appetizing or worth ordering except the chips and guacamole. Even the chips are whatever. Probably not comparable but ATX Cochina has way better food. Forget that  chuys has better options than this place.  Warning  not sure if it s the traditional way but the queso is horribly weird. It s like a rubbery cheese pancake. Do not order it   2 stars are for the decor and service. Will not recommend at all  Also  don t forget to carry the deed of your house cause they will charge you that and more for the cheesy pancake  
Fonda San Miguel,107,What a great surprise.  Kid wanted unique Mexican food for birthday dinner.  We gave this spot a try after reviewing Yelp and other sites.   Arrived during happy hour and tried the assortment of quesadillas. Yummy  I think mushrooms was my favorite.   For dinner we started with the ceviche and  tacos pastor. Excellent choices.   Hubby ordered Carne asada  I ordered duck enchiladas   and kid had the shrimp w garlic butter. Everything was fabulous. I especially enjoyed the size of the tortillas which helped prevent overeating.   Ask to sit in the main dining room.  It was great. If looking for a quieter experience ask for the table next to the bronzed horse.     We would have loved a more experienced server as I am sure we could have found other items to try.  Service was not bad but certainly not what we read about in the reviews.   We will definitely be back as the food alone is worth a repeat trip.
Fonda San Miguel,108,Such a beautiful restaurant with beyond amazing food. The drinks are gorgeous and taste so refreshing. Love this place 
Fonda San Miguel,109,I don t know what has happened to this place.  This used to be such a treat for us.   Tuesday night might not be the best time to go.   At best  the food was just average.  I had the pork  COCHINITA PIBIL .  The first two bites were all fat and under seasoned.  The server was attentive. Too much money for this quality of food    Never more 
Fonda San Miguel,110,This place needs 5 stars. The service was great  the food was great  the skinny margs were delicious  The restaurant itself transports you to somewhere magical  amp  I m here for it. If you haven t tried this spot  you need to  This is definitely going to be our go to Mexican spot..
Fonda San Miguel,111,DEFINITELY RECOMMEND   On Christmas holiday in Santa Fe  we went to Fonda San Miguel for brunch. a table of 4 plus a 3 no old baby.  The staff were all so helpful  accommodating and kind.  All of our choices from the Eggs Benedict to the Veggie Omelet  everything was cooked to perfection and nicely presented.  Plus the service was truly five star   Would have liked to make it there for dinner    Next time for sure
Fonda San Miguel,112,Still a great place for nostalgia  but they have fallen back into a menu of old favorites.  It s good but not inspiring.  The more innovative daily specials are gone.  Overall execution is fine but the overall level feels like it has slipped.  They may still be in pandemic recovery.
Fonda San Miguel,113,Amazing  The food  the drinks  the atmosphere  the service  etc. It is on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. I would go here over and over again  We had the queso fundido  calabacitas rellenas  tres leches  and cafe olla. Prefect place to celebrate an anniversary  birthday  or any other event 
Fonda San Miguel,114,The Silver Coin Margarita is perfect. Try the Dos Artes Blanco Tequila to treat yourself. Traditional Ceviche Campesina    is so clean and refreshing  We haven t tried the entrees yet  but so looking forward to the Chuleta  amp  Duck enchilada. The main reason that we were so wowed this time around was the bartender K.J. She is fantastic  and steered us to try some items that are out of the ordinary  vs. our last visit  a couple years ago   when the bartender was just not as personal  and made no unique recommendations. We will be making this a regular stop from now on 
Fonda San Miguel,115,Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in Austin to visit high quality cuisine and ingredients  real mexican flavors and amazing decor  Highly recommended.
Fonda San Miguel,116,This is a well-decorated restaurant outside of Austin. It really looks like the ones in Mexico.  I ordered a pineapple margarita - it has a slight cinnamon taste that was quite memorable.  The chips were light and crisp - freshly fried. and the two salsas were very good.  I ordered the carnitas tacos - 4 to an order and in freshly grilled tortillas.
Fonda San Miguel,117,Wow    This place pleasantly surprised us   We had the queso with fresh made tortillas- amazing  then I had the enchiladas suizas which were great and my husband had the lamb. The vibe of this place is really cool and the service is top notch.
Fonda San Miguel,118,This place has completely lost it s charm for us.  Really  sad...  We are old Austinites who used to go to this restaurant on many occasions  remembering how great it was.  After the opera  theatre and concerts and  for special celebrations...Saturday  we had reservations for a party of 6 and expected the same  or close  experience.  First to pay for it  take out a second mortgage on your home   I know  prices have gone up and help is hard to find after COVID.  But  here the prices are outrageous and okay  we expected to pay more for good food    BUT  and here comes the worst part.  Each of us had simple entree and for four of us  the bill totaled  250.00   My entree was at best --4 oz. of fish floating in tomato sauce with capers and a very small  flavorless serving of black beans.  The portions are very  emphasis  small on huge dishes with tiny servings of black beans.  Really     I can tell you that I will not go back here and pay for the prices they charge  in spite of the good memories and the fact that it used to be a go to place for guests and special celebrations.  Honestly  I m still reeling...  and let me remind you  that I am used to paying good money for good food.  I am no longer Fonda La Fonda...
Fonda San Miguel,119,Wow.  Traditional food  up-scale and outstanding service.  My wife and I ejoyed both salsas that came with chips--the green one was my fave--and we also ordered the fundido and ceviche.  Very nice   The main menu had Enchiladas Suizas which my wife hadn t had since living in Mexico City--very good--and I found the Chile Relleno had a nice glazed almost smokey skin that was very flavorful...I even opted for a side duck enchilada.  There was too much to try in one visit  but we ll be back...just wish I d remembered to take pics.  Oh yeah--the coffee cocktail that s iced with Soto and Espresso and the Flan were amazing finishes.
Fonda San Miguel,120,First stop on our  girlfriend bolt   Did not disappoint. Had enchiladas suizas. Creamy and smooth. Bellisimo  Went back today  Sunday  on way out of town. They are closed. I m so sad. The service was amazing. Food outstanding. Would award 10 stars if I could.           Highly recommend. Will be back when in Austin.
Fonda San Miguel,121,I am the rare breed that doesn t really like Mexican food. While a friend reassured me it was  interior  Mexican I was willing to give it a try.  After looking at the menu this restaurant was serving glorified and renamed Mexican food. The fajitas are called something more exotic and are not as good as the usual fajitas you ll find at any taqueria. I don t like spicy food  I asked our waitress what was not spicy  she led me to the appetizer section and pointed to the  lamb chops. They were SPICY and bleeding. I tried a friends chicken fajita and it was dry  burned tasting from the char  and the bell peppers were not sliced. Another friend had the ceviche and didn t eat it claiming it was too sour  we all tried it and it was SPICY and sour.  Our bill was       and we left hungry.
Fonda San Miguel,122,This spot gets 6 stars for ambiance and 4.3 for food. Everything is a bit on the pricier side and my partner was not a fan of the meat stuffed Chile relleno  no cheese  but everything I had was great. Drinks and ceviche were on point and my enchiladas de pato were a fun twist on the classic Mexican entree. I d definitely come here again 
Fonda San Miguel,123,This spot shuns the regular Mexican with staggering dishes that you ll recall and need to return for.
Fonda San Miguel,124,We went here for my husband s birthday last night. This was my first time here though he had been before. The service was wonderful  and we were seated right away. Our server was very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. The menu itself was very unique  and it was difficult to choose what we wanted. So we ended up with 3 entrees and an appetizer- all of which were delicious. I also haven t mentioned how quickly the food came out- I d say 10 min tops after ordering. The margaritas were quite strong but tasted great. We ll def be adding this place to our list of go-to restaurants.
Fonda San Miguel,125,Fonda San Miguel has been on my Austin bucket list for many years  but the reality fell short of expectations.  The legendary decor was pleasant  festive  and seemingly authentic with interesting art objects  but it was not as beautiful or striking as I had imagined. We did have a good experience at the bar while waiting an about 75 minutes to be seated on a saturday evening. The margaritas and cocktails we tried included the Numero Uno and the El Mago  both were well-above average but not exceptional.   We enjoyed the food  but there was nothing great or memorable. For a meal that ended up being our most expensive date night in a while   75 at the bar plus another  80 in the dining room plus  15 for valet   I hoped for much more.    We had a great night out  but it wasn t the magical experience I was hoping for from a restaurant of this reputation or price point.
Fonda San Miguel,126,Third time visitor and didn t disappoint again. Brought friends who had never been and they loved it as much as I do. Unique food choices and delicious. Love the ambiance. Excellent service. Can t wait to bring more friends to enjoy.
Fonda San Miguel,127,Hello again friends.. lets get to the rundown  Food  B  Drinks  C  Price  Overpriced   Service   B  Pros  The steak is really good. They served black refried beans also good.   Cons  Wife got a chile relleno ehhh not to great mole was light. Drinks taste good but i order a cocktail and they give me a shot size drink weak     . And lastly super over priced for what you get ...it ain t fine dining.   Wouldn t go back on my own but for gatherings i guess its cool  Stay hungry my friends
Fonda San Miguel,128,Love the bar area  you feel like you re actually in San Miguel. Some of the best Mexican food in Austin.
Fonda San Miguel,129,I think this may be my new favorite spot in Austin  I ve been here several times but this past time was amazing. To drink I had the silver coin and pepino pica  both were great. Can t go wrong with either  I had an order of the tamales and my goodness was this the best tamale I ve had in a long time. It s much softer than normal but the taste was incredible  The entree I had was the camarones en crema de chipotle. Again  amazing  This is easily the best shrimp dish I ve had in Austin since S o Paulo s closed. It was just the right amount of spice. I was stuffed but I had to have the tres leches cake. It wasn t the best I ve had but it came with a mango sorbet which was delicious. Can t get enough of this place 
Fonda San Miguel,130,When a restaurant consistently delivers on taste and service  you just keep coming back.  That has been my experience with Fonda San Miguel. Since being introduced to this restaurant by long-term Austin residents in February  my husband and I have returned on numerous occasions for date nights  to be wowed by awesome service  food  and drinks every time.  Enter Fonda San Miguel and  depending on the night  there will be an open seating area that appears somewhat like a hotel lobby that is somewhat connected to the bar through a few doors inside. As I learned a few nights ago  this area is actually a full-service dining area for people who do not have reservations. This open area can serve probably close to 80 people  so even if you are unable to get a reservation for any given night  you can probably find seating in this common area as long as you have a small group.  I have dined in the dining room as well as in this open seating area. Of course  the dining room is a preferable dining experience to the open seating area  less chaos  more room  etc. But you still get the same food and drinks.  And the food and drinks are just spectacular. You won t be hungry here for a second as they will serve you chips and salsa right away. You will have two salsas from the get go  a tomatillo and a very delicious red salsa. The cuisine is traditional Mexican and provides many dishes that have a core poultry  meat  or fish with some delicious and spicy sauce and several traditional sides.  Having come here on multiple occasions with several guests  I ve had the good fortune to sample a decent portion of the menu  including the chips and guacamole  the carne asada  the duck enchiladas  the ceviche  the lamb cooked in a banana leaf. It is always difficult to choose something on this menu because everything is just so damn tasty. But of course  that means you can t go wrong.  The margaritas and specialty drinks are also fantastic. I can t wait to come here to try their brunch and happy hour 
Fonda San Miguel,131,I am so disappointed in this restaurant. I have been so excited to try Fonda San Miguel. I have never been here and we have planned for two weeks to go here tonight. Ambiance is incredible  hostess was sweet...our waiter was garbage. So unbelievably rude. I was not prepared for what I wanted to order and asked for a recommendation. Very short with me wouldn t help me with the menu or my drink choice. I just wanted a personable experience with a host that would enjoy being a part of such an experience for someone. We quickly got a to go box and left. He never stopped to ask how anything was  never made eye contact  once. I was so hopeful.
Fonda San Miguel,132,Finishing up a draft review from February 2020. I loved this place and would happily return the next time I visit Austin. It was a beautiful place with great food and excellent service. Styled like an old adobe  although it was built in the 1970s. My favorite thing was the really wonderful  quirky art collection. Also being able to watch women making tortillas.   Interesting Tex Mex menu. They handled our large crowd skillfully  although the service was a bit slow. I had a chili relleno special that was tasty. The queso appetizer was delicious and cocktail menu was good.
Fonda San Miguel,133,TLDR  definitely worth doing at least once for Tues happy hour  but be picky which apps you get.  The good  - the margs. They re both strong and tasty. Mango tastes like real mango  not flavoring  and the guava is delish too.  - ceviche las brisas. For happy hour price of  8 this is a steal. It s a huge serving for ceviche and tastes good. - sopecitos. 3 each of fish  shrimp and avocado  and jalape o. All really good. - ambiance. This place has cool vibes  no question about it  The bad  - the quesadillas. Tiny and flavorless. - tacos al pastor. Okay so these weren t BAD per se but they definitely came after the ceviche and sopecitos. A little greasy and bland  also quite small. - ceviche. yes I know this is also under the good because it s worth it for the price  but the fish was a bit chewy
Fonda San Miguel,134,This was my first time at Fonda San Miguel  second for my boyfriend. We went for a romantic dinner on a Saturday.   First the ambience. The interior was beautiful with glass and metal chandeliers  and looked to be inspired by Spaniard-styled decorations- a waterfall  glass-covered atrium and richness of colors included. The lighting was low and appropriate for an intimate setting. We went around 6 30 p.m.  and even though the restaurant was about 75  full  the noise levels were good enough for me and my boyfriend to have a steady conversation. There was also adequate parking surrounding the restaurant.  Now for the food.  We ordered the chicken mole and it was delicious. The chicken was savory and the mol  was perfect  and the food was brought out quickly. We ordered chips and salsa  those weren t complimentary  amd those were good too.  Lastly  the service. Our host was great- he was very attentive  and accommodated our desire to be seated near a window  away from other patrons. The restaurant does set tables 6 feet away from each other  but ours was particularly close to another table. He and the rest of the staff wore masks and were very professional.  My only gripe is the cost  the chicken mol  plate alone was 21   and chips were an additional 3  or 4 . Desserts were a minimum of 10 . This does not change my experience at this restaurant  but it does add up quickly  which is why I took off a star.
Fonda San Miguel,135,The overall restaurant is beautiful but the food was not for me. A bit on the bland side and different. Almonds in Chile relleno is not what I m used to  though I m willing to try different items. The ceviche had chunks is of fish. If it were cut smaller it would of been better to eat. Also fixed different and bland.
Fonda San Miguel,136,My husband and I are visiting from out of state and had a wonderful meal and excellent service at Fonda San Miguel last night. The appetizer special  a salmon ceviche cucumber roll with pineapple and mango salsas and orange atchiote sauce was so good  I am still thinking about it  yum 
Fonda San Miguel,137,Love coming here for a date night. Antonio was our server and he was so good  His recommendations were spot on and he helped us have a wonderful dinner experience. We recommend coming here for a good dinner and ambiance  Also get the tres leches cake  thanks Antonio 
Fonda San Miguel,138,We love to come on Sunday s brunch. I think this is the closest to Mexican food around Austin. Service is great and food always come out super fast.
Fonda San Miguel,139,We have been looking for an awesome Mexican restaurant since we moved to Austin. Mexican Tex-mex  tacos  they are everywhere. Unfortunately none that we have tried so far are amazing. We decided to come to FSM for brunch and I cannot tell you how great of a time we had. The ambiance when you walk in is like you are in Mexico. The art  the decorations are all fantastic. Service was top notch and the food was fantastic. You can tell they put love into what they are making because everything is layered with flavor. We got the tortilla soup and the steak. It was so good i didn t even get to take a picture we ate everything so fast   I can t wait to come back and try the regular dinner menu  Fantastic 
Fonda San Miguel,140,Been going here for 40  YEARS.  Young hostess was BLAHHHHHH  absolutely no personality and even less interested in patrons  barely spoke...AWW HUH WHATEVER. Go do something else that doesn t include GREETING. She set down electronic Pad menus with NO explanation...HERE hope you can figure out this black screen.  Even my 23 YO was like uhhh WTH.  Took 20 minutes to get drinks first time.  Second round came after we finished our meal even though we ordered before it came.  Husband s meal and daughter s meal were COLD   Cold Fish  amp  Cold Tacos AL Pastor NO BUENO  sent back Tacos said cold and I think he just walked around the restaurant and came back because they were just as cold when he came back.  I think if it had been hot it would have still been UHHHHH  yah no.  Saw the waiter maybe three times in over an hour.  First Top Shelf margarita must have been sitting there for that 20 minutes because it was way watered down.. Second one was like whaaaat...No.  Total bill for three people was like 175 ...Wouldn t mind it if it was worth it  but that was just insulting.  NOT AGAIN FOR A VEY LONG WHILE.
Fonda San Miguel,141,Good food  fun atmosphere  The service could be a lot better. I don t know if it s the server we got but he was pretty passive aggressive and did not give us a great service or experience. The host s were very kind. I like the place a lot  it feels authentic. It s definelty worth going to check out. The food is good but not gourmet Mexican  so don t expect anything extra ordinary.
Fonda San Miguel,142,Food was absolutely incredible  drinks were perfect and the atmosphere was so cozy and beautiful  10 10 experience  Overall could not have been happier with our experience at Fonda San Miguel  You need to tee the Queso Fundido. It was unbelievable 
Fonda San Miguel,143,Great food   I can t wait to go back again  Great service and very friendly   True Mexican food  
Fonda San Miguel,144,Went here last week with my gf and her cousin. Amazing meal. My black drum was perfect flaky heaven while my gfs shrimp in cream sauce was perfect. Having that next time. Great margaritas too   Highly recommend 
Fonda San Miguel,145,This place is such a treat  So romantic and special  We happened in on all day happy hour and the food was amazing  Worth it
Fonda San Miguel,146,The Carne Asada was absolutely amazing.  We all wished we had ordered that dish  even with the very high price of  46  after trying my husband s.  We will return just to be able to have this dish.   The service was excruciatingly slow.  It took an hour to get our food and over two hours for our entire dinner  so just go into it that you re going to enjoy the ambience.
Fonda San Miguel,147,Shame on me  shame on me and more shame on me...I always thought that I knew good places when it comes to Mexican food...well  I was so wrong.  This place has been in business for over 40 years and I just discovered it last night. It was a very nice surprise to find such an authentic Mexican place in Texas.  The decoration truly reminds me of restaurants in Guadalajara  Guanajuato and San Miguel de Allende  you get there thinking about eating but in the end you not just enjoy the food  but also the atmosphere  the decoration and the art...I can say without a doubt that this restaurant is like an art gallery with real Mexican food.  From the moment you cross the old heavy wood front door  port n  you enter to Mexico  feels and smells like it.  The food is authentic  the service is great and very friendly  and the drinks are fantastic...Vamos a comer 
Fonda San Miguel,148,Excellent Mexican restaurant in Austin. Loved the decor and atmosphere. Chips and guacamole are a must  Chicken fajitas were delicious and definitely enjoyed this meal.
Fonda San Miguel,149,Sunday brunch in hands down the best meal in Austin. It is an orchestra of authentic  interior Mexican dishes. They rotate moles and other specialties so it never gets boring. It s also beautiful inside. It might as well be a museum. The artwork on the walls and other decorations makes you feel as if you are actually eating in Mexico. You will be hard pressed to find more authentic Mexican food in Austin.   The sweets table also can t be missed. You have flan  assortment of cookies  capirotada  tres leches  etc. It s truly a remarkable accomplishment for them to create this experience every week.   The brunch might be a bit more expensive than what you re used to paying  but you definitely get the value for it.
Fonda San Miguel,150,This place was simply outdated in decor  menu items  and even service.  The waitress was inattentive and pushy on the drinks food items to the degree it was feeling uncomfortable  then she was MIA when the food arrived and never checked on us until we asked for the bill.  The food was very  unauthentic  and didnt have any flavor and I was very disappointed.  I just think they may have been something to rave about years ago but they dont seem to have kept up with a fresh menu  decor was tacky and felt like an old cruise ship  service was subpar. I def will not go back again and I would not recommend your time or money here.  So sorry to be negative but this is just my honest review.  It was so unimpressive that I didnt even bother to take pics 
Fonda San Miguel,151,This was great. Came here with a couple friends and got  ceviche las brisas  relleno de picadillo  duck enchiladas  crepas de cajeta  and a chocolate tart. The relleno was really outstanding -- the outside was lightly fried  the insides  pork almonds raisins  were great  and the tomato-y picadillo sauce was amazing. The crepas de cajeta were also amazing -- definitely not the type of dessert I would typically get  but my friends insisted and I m glad they did. I liked the rest as well  but those were the stars.  Definitely a solid spot.
Fonda San Miguel,152,Worst service ever. Our server Diego was so rude to my two friends and I from the start. It s really annoying having to experience this type of behavior at my birthday dinner. He took our order  then they brought out our order and he never came up to us again. Our drinks needed refills and he would just walk by as if we weren t his table. And like I said this was my birthday dinner and specifically these friends I went with are childhood friends so we had a lot of catching up to do. He interrupted our conversation asking for the receipt that has our tip on it. Fonda gives you a little bowl to put the receipt after your payment so we placed cash tip in the bowl and the receipt on top. So when he took the bowl he read no tip on the receipt. He turned around and stated we need to put a tip in a very rude way  but we advised him that the tip is in cash in the bowl. Therefore my point is  even if we didn t tip him he shouldn t act that way throughout the whole dinner then expect something in return. He s supposed to serve us as a server.
Fonda San Miguel,153,We went to the restaurant last night  arrived a few minutes early and was seated at the bar waiting for a table. I asked the bartender for a recommendation on the margarita and he said do you want me to make them the way I drink them  We said yes and the Rita s were excellent. A little later our table was ready and we had the most wonderful meal we ve had in a very long time. The last time we had Interior Mexican Food of this quality we were in San Miguel Allende. The restaurant is beautiful the service was phenomenal you could not ask for more
Fonda San Miguel,154,Amazing dinner  great atmosphere. Truly one of my favorite Austin restaurants.  You will not be disappointed.
Fonda San Miguel,155,We thought to give  curbside a try this evening.  Wow  what a huge disappointment    We ordered the Tortilla Soup for  9 and the Enchiladas Verde for  19.  The order with tax came to over  30.     The tortilla soup was a tasteless broth.  The broth had a few pieces of dried chilies but nothing else.  The tortilla chips includes in the soup were made up of couple of small pieces.  In addition  the soup was luke warm at best .  For  9  this was a huge disappointment.    The Enchiladas Verde came with a small portion of white rice  and black beans and two small enchiladas.  The enchiladas had virtually no sauce and tasted average at best.  Overall  the meal lacked taste and the portions  were better suited for a child.  If you are looking for Mexican takeout at a reasonable price  this is not the place.
Fonda San Miguel,156,Fonda San Miguel was absolutely fabulous. We walked in on a Saturday at 6 and were able to find a table immediately. It was a beautiful atmosphere and a slightly older crowd with some families. We started with the Numero uno and a pina pica. The Numero uno was too sweet for me but my partner loved it. We also got the queso fundito with peppers and chorizo. The texture of the cheese was great  but overall the dish was not that flavorful. We also got a round of house frozen margs which I also found pretty sweet. Next time I go  I will ask for some adjustments because I know they are willing to make adjustments  The ceviche which was great  We ended dinner with cafe olla and tres leches  both were great  but I really LOVED the coffee. Overall  the food was good  but the vibes  service and atmosphere were GREAT  which is why I am giving them 5 stars  
Fonda San Miguel,157,Absolutely gorgeous venue but the food did not seem very authentic or particularly tasty  also very limited veggie options   especially given the prices. I m glad we went to try it out and see the hype  but I would not go again.
Fonda San Miguel,158,Thought it was gonna be a great place for our anniversary dinner. Until our car got broken into and they stole the gift that I gave my boyfriend. No cameras around the restaurant. Manager was no help. Told us to call a number to file a report and they didn t do anything. I m completely appalled. This is the first time to EVER happen to me.
Fonda San Miguel,159,The decor  works of art and ambiance are so beautiful  Our server Mauricio was so proud of his job and his Mexican heritage. He told us all about the history of the restaurant and the art. The food and drinks were outstanding as well as the desserts. We tried several dishes to share and everything was amazing. Highly recommend 
Fonda San Miguel,160,Congrats to Fonda San Miguel for taking extra steps to ensure the health and safety of their patrons. They are now part of the Trusted Partner Program  an easy and direct way for customers to share their feedback regarding their health and hygiene standards directly with the restaurant. Next time you stop by  take two minutes  and tell them how they are doing  Great food  a safe atmosphere  and friendly service 
Fonda San Miguel,161,I don t know why I ve never been here. Fonda San Miguel has a great menu and their food is great. The decor is fabulous. You should make a reservation here if you re trying to get a table  even on a weeknight. They were pretty booked on a Tuesday night for a table of 8. Their pork tacos are so good. I would totally come back here again and try another dish off of their menu. Thanks Fonda 
Fonda San Miguel,162,Let s get this out of the way first  you haven t lived in Austin until you ve been to Fonda San Miguel. Go.  Now  a look at some highs and not so highs.  Beautiful architecture  tastefully decorated and adorned  and a warm inviting feeling. The menu is expansive and well-thought out  try the Rellenos de Picadillo and you will never think about rellenos the same way again...  and the dishes are plated supremely and served quickly. And yes - its very good food   Servers are efficient and well-mannered and keep a good eye on their tables. There is nothing just  average  about the service here.   Why not five stars  Well  I think five is as good as it gets and I m not sure  I can say that.   First  this is a very popular place - I do not recommend trying it without a reservation. Second  parking is a bitch even with the additional lot next door. Be careful if you park in the hood and impede someone s driveway - you will be towed. And the bar area is small and crowded and the fact is the whole place feels to me like things are just a little too close together. Too tight.  Now  are these really bad  Perhaps not - but I want five to be a full five. Having said that  you will not be sorry if you go here  make a res  and use RideAustin to forget your parking challenge. You will be glad you did.
Fonda San Miguel,163,Amazing ceviche. The shrimp dish with cream sauce will make you want to lick your plate 
Fonda San Miguel,164,The food is great and the service is excellent. Have been to this restaurant many times and have never been disappointed.  And being able to reserve online is a bonus.
Fonda San Miguel,165,Gave this place another try for my fianc  s birthday. I have food allergies and the menu was difficult to navigate. It says to let your server know if you have allergies but my server was so dismissive and unaccommodating. I told my server my allergies and found what I thought would work but all my dishes had things in was allergic to. He was very unknowledgeable in regards to the menu and what items were on the plate when asked. For Austin being a foodie town this was the place that I ve had food allergies ignored. I had to send things back that even though I asked my server if it would accommodate my allergies. My entree probably had stuff I was allergic to but at that point I knew the server wasn t going to do anything to accommodate. He dropped the check and despite putting a card down right away he left fir 30 min before he picked it up. We had to ask several times for basics like utensils  water refills and felt unheard
Fonda San Miguel,166,This was so amazing.Will definately come back. The atmosphere was great and it was so easy getting our drinks. My toddler was with us and it was very welcoming to bring her. They gave us complimentary cake for my husband s bday and the food was delicious 
Fonda San Miguel,167,Hola. I ve been here 3 times now  once for a quick drink to check it out  next for a dinner date  and finally for Sunday brunch. The drinks are pretty good  but I ll say that about anything with booze. For dinner  I ve tried the cordero appetizer  lamb chops   enchiladas de pato  duck enchiladas  and pato asado. All were tasty  but the mole served with the asado was on the salty side. The Sunday brunch is worth a visit as you ll get  to taste more dishes than you can handle. Try to take it easy and save room for desert. My only complaint about the brunch was that it lingered with me for the rest of the day  just too many rich foods and sauces for one meal. Generally  I ve found the food a little underwhelming for the price point  but as many other reviews point out  it s a beautiful restaurant inside and out. I don t see myself coming back for a meal  but maybe happy hour as I still need to try the queso fundido that everyone raves over.
Fonda San Miguel,168,Fonda San Miguel has been on my list of places to eat in Austin for a few years nowand finally got around to going. I made reservations 5 days in advance and times were still pretty slim. That just shows you how popular it is. Food is great and the valet service was exceptional with the guys remembering right away what vehicles belonged to us. I will definitely return  The queso is quite unique- not your traditional melted cheese  I have attached a picture. The duck enchiladas with a pesto sauce were amazing  photo attached . The margaritas were great and the desserts looked fantastic although I didn t have room this go around. If you are wanting upscale Mexican food with a great ambience  Fonda San Miguel is the place 
Fonda San Miguel,169,The most beautiful authentic Mexican restaurant inside and out in Austin Texas in my opinion. Specialty drinks and beers got us up and running. My wife ordered a light and refreshing ceviche that want to filling as we ate a big lunch earlier that day. I opted for the mole poblano dish with the special ranchero beans. This perhaps was the best Mexican food I ve ever tasted the rich complex flavors of the dark mole sauce put me on cloud nine. A lady a table over turned 100 a former employee which gave us the chance to meet the owner. Super nice guy   Our waitress was outstanding don t remember her name but she is from Colorado best service we could ask for dinner.
Fonda San Miguel,170,All the food was amazing  amp  the service was great.  Is a very nice restaurant and is definitely a stop if you are coming to Austin.
Fonda San Miguel,171,During the midst of the COVID19 pandemic our family visited Austin from Las Vegas and Fonda San Miguel was a highlight of our trip. The Mexican cuisine was exceptional  the service exceeded all expectations  and the ambiance of this historic location was a highlight for our entire family. Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a truly authentic dining experience.
Fonda San Miguel,172,Great experience for a first timer  Iris at the front desk was super friendly  amp  very professional  Miguel our server was beyond attentive  He made sure we had everything we needed  amp  gave us great feed back on the menu. His customer service skills were beyond exceptional  I also love the music choice  it has a variety but always staying in the culture  Food was beyond amazing  Overall a great night for my husband and I
Fonda San Miguel,173,The lady and I went here the othernight for a later dinner. Not many delicious dinner spots are open late  but they were open til 10 30. Yes   I would still call ahead to make sure they re not closed for regular business hours for a private party... The staff was very pleasant and professional. Our server  Miguel  was a pleasure to talk too as well as a young man by the name of Wesley. Both sweet  professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Dinner tasted fresh and delicious  dessert too 
Fonda San Miguel,174,The decor and menu are interesting. It s a good concept but.... The food is decent but not great. One of the dishes I tried was the chicken mole. It was probably the most disappointing mole that I I have ever tasted. The service is terrible. It took over an hour for my group to get our food and during our wait at the table  we had to flag down servers to do basic service such as refilling water  ordering drinks  etc. I highly recommend AVOIDING this place.
Fonda San Miguel,175,First and most importantly  I love the atmosphere and decor of this place.  We came here for a work dinner and I was so excited to try the food.  I got a spicy margarita to start and then devoured chips and salsa.  We got two different types of queso fundido  rajas and chorizo  and both were delicious.  For my entree  I ordered the Pollo en mole Poblano and I had no idea it would be so HUGE   And amazingly mouthwatering.  I was in heaven and no where near being able to finish it - so I had amazing leftovers the next day   Our waiter was great and we all walked out in a food coma 
Fonda San Miguel,176,My wife and I went inside to eat at Fonda San Miguel - first time in a restaurant in over a year.  It is always a transcendent experience - between the art  the food  and the service  it just a treasure.
Fonda San Miguel,177,I would totally leave 5 stars if I had not packed the left over pork chop...  It s a good restaurant. Great taste  generous portion and amazing ambience. We started with ceviche and tamale. Both were tasty. Ceviche was huge. For entree  I ordered pork chop from dinner special.  Remember I said that portions are generous  By the time entree was served  I was already full. So I only had a couple bites of the chop  and had the rest of it packed. After dinner  I went straight home and put the left over in the fridge.  The next day  I reheated the pork chop in microwave oven  I noticed that part of the chop smelled sour. I took a bite and proved that the right side of the pork chop had gone bad  also regretted to bite on it  I really don t believe that 14 hours in the fridge would make food go bad so quickly. I have to suspect that part of the pork chop was already spoiled when it was served in the restaurant. Very disappointed and disgusted.  Tamale  ceviche and tres leche cake were so good. Too bad that the pork chop was spoiled.
Fonda San Miguel,178, Excellent  mexican restaurant  from all over  with the occasional  star chef  guest-ing in the kitchen.  If thats not enough  the service is top-notch  and the art on the walls - oh lords  the art on the walls is  stellar . It s upscale-y  though not necessarily so  - you can hang out at the bar  partake of the excellent mango-margheritas  and  all in all  have a stellar evening
Fonda San Miguel,179,Such a beautiful place. We couldn t make reservations in time so we took a chance at the bar and was able to find a small table by the bar to sit and eat. I loved the food it was delicious and we got to hear the mariachi play music.
Fonda San Miguel,180,Very bad service and attitude . We tried their Sunday Brunch and I would not go there again . For 42  a person before tax and tip you Would expect a top notch service   I had to chase the waitress for coffee and my husband had to wait 15 min for her to appear and provide water . No diet soft drink which is strange .  The food is good but definitely  not worth this amount.  We tried the Fairmont brunch last week which was exceptional variety and service for 35  a person   the week before we tried the four seasons which was 60  a person and the food was exceptional and service was unbelievably amazing . The price of Fonda does not represent the service nor the food we got .
Fonda San Miguel,181,My wife and I came here last minute on a Thursday prior to heading to a comedy show. What a pleasant surprise  The only thing better than the great service and eclectic decor was the amazing food   If you do not like Fonda San Miguel than you don t like food. It was very authentic  tasty  and fresh. We ordered the mole dish  chicken and pork  and the shrimp crema dish which was outstanding. We highly recommend it and will be back.
Fonda San Miguel,182,We ve come here twice now  the first experience was amazing primarily due to the food and drink quality and the overall ambiance  but for some reason the second experience we had somewhat bad service  although the food was still amazing . It can be a bit pricey it s definitely worth the price  and it s even better on happy hour.
Fonda San Miguel,183,This place is incredible.  You want some high end  classic  not your average Tex-Mex or hole in the wall Mexican food   You must come here   You re gonna love it   My boo and I like going to places when the rush has died down and we get the best attention from the waiters and waitresses.  Our waiter tonight has been here since 1992    Steve Adams has been one of my favorite servers to date   Very knowledgable and gave great advice on what to pick for our dish     Just don t ask what his favorite dessert is...he struggles with that because he simply loves them all    This place gets top rating from me for overall experience   Excellent service  amazing food and just a fantastic building  which by the way the owner has been working on over 40 years collecting art and making this place magical  
Fonda San Miguel,184,I was so disappointed the minute they sat us down when I looked over to the brunch area and  saw three tables of food not what it used to be for brunch. I have been raving about this place to my husband because he had not been there and I was so excited that we finally got to go for Father s Day. Big disappointment I only ate two entr es because other things I could not eat they serve you appetizers which was guacamole and a salad guacamole was made for one person as well as the salad very skimpy. The dessert which wasn t really dessert they were mini and this was for two people A piece of flan  Tres Leches cake  and a supposedly chocolate cake which felt like a flat tasteless brownie. The waitress did say they had a new chef and they were looking to see how to re-open their Sunday brunch since currently they are closed only for special occasions but I have to say if this is what s coming no thank you this was not worth the  48 per person.
Fonda San Miguel,185,Pricey  but worth it.   Every bite was delicious.   Seriously  there wasn t one thing I tried that wasn t delicious.   From the guacamole to the pastries  each bite was extra tasty  extra good.  I almost feel like there had to be something in the food to make it all so good  I m talking something addictive here people  because there wasn t anything I sampled that I didn t want more of.  And there was plenty more to have.  So I did.   I say this as a vegetarian too.   I didn t even try the meat dishes  though my dining companions did and they raved. I simply stuck to things without meat and I still waddled out overly full.    Service was spectacular too  as you would expect for the price.  Our later afternoon reservation  and I would suggest making a reservation  meant that the our server had already been busy for hours  though he did not let it show.  Smiles and great follow up on our drinks to go along with the great food. So to sum up   super flavorful food with options for every palette in a bustling  colorful and well appointed dining room.   A definite  don t miss  when in Austin.
Fonda San Miguel,186,Our First and Last Visit Here We came for dinner on 07 02 21. The inside ambiance was nice. But everything else went downhill from that point. Service is slow  it took more than 10 min for us just to get water after we sit down. We ordered the following  Appetizers  tamale - horrible  especially the spinach ones. Calamary - HORRIBLE  burned  hard little pieces  the worst I ever had in my life Main entries  Chipotle shrimp - horrible  very tough rubbery texture with chipotle sauce. They don t know how to cook shrimp. Cochinita Pibil - pork cooked in banana leaf  pretty good. But very small. Relleno De Picadillo Traditional - pretty good  mixed meat and some nuts. Also  very small. Very limited beer selection. We did not try their cocktails. Wines - we did not see a lot of by glass options  mostly bottles. Also  the selection is poor Lastly  at the end I wanted to pay my bill with a credit card. But after waiting and waiting for our server to pick up. I decided to pay cash and we left. Will never go back.
Fonda San Miguel,187,Went to this Tex-Mex restaurant at the recommendation of a friend. Glad we got there when we did on a Monday night at six because it gets packed. We were seated right away and waited on right away. The waiter though never came back to ask how was the food or anything we had to ask for extra water.  The food was OK but I ve had better in California. Lovely place very interesting. Also had to ask for a check as we had been sitting for a while.
Fonda San Miguel,188,Interesting experience last night. I need to lead by saying it s been about 5 months since my husband and I had our last date night. We ve been navigating the pandemic with small children and so a night together alone is something we ve been looking forward to for a long time  I d heard really great things about Fonda San Miguel and when we had an opportunity to sneak out for the night  this restaurant was at the top of the list  I was really impressed with the woman who took my call earlier in the day to help coordinate our reservation  she was kind  welcoming  and very helpful.   We arrived a few minutes early and had a cocktail at the bar- the service was awesome and the drinks we ordered were really good. We were taken to a table in the back and when our server showed up  things kind of changed. She wasn t really engaging and I felt more like our party of two was a burden than an opportunity to provide an exceptional experience. As an example  when I ordered another drink- she s place it on the opposite side of the table and then would take the old drink away- leaving the new drink across the table. That s weird and felt super unwelcoming. We had food before we had silverware- which we had to ask for and I knew she was absolutely itching to have us leave  even though others were still receiving service . When we left  my thinking was confirmed because the server left five minutes after we did. At the end of the night  our dinner check ended up being  175 and honestly  if our server had engaged us- we would have probably walked out spending  275.   The food was good but the service from our dinner experience sucked so much I don t know that I m eager to make the 30 minute drive back.   Looking forward to more positive experiences in Austin- even if we have to wait another couple of months.
Fonda San Miguel,189,Fonda San Miguel was a excellent experience.  We had been trying upscale Mexican restaurants around town and the classic Fonda San Miguel was a fantastic experience. We had a reservation and sat right down.. excellent chips and salsa amid a wonderful decor. This is an old school Austin restaurant and their experience showed in their execution and service which was excellent.  We had a Ceviche to open it up  and I just loved it  tangy and fresh..we lounged and had more cocktails brought to the table and then moved to main course. I had the Mixiote which is a lamb done in a paper wrapper and it was so tender and delicious..and HUGE.. I was not able to finish it all..so hey  leftovers right  No room for desert  but we will be back 
Fonda San Miguel,190,The restaurant was beautifully decorated and there was even a little area where you could watch them make the tortillas   We got the cordero as a starter -- I love lamb chops but was not the biggest fan of this dish  only reason they didn t get 5 stars . Then we got the cochinita pibil which was fantastic. Literally the best pork I ve ever gotten 10 10   We also got the camarones in crema de chipotle. I don t eat seafood but the sauce tasted pretty good. We also got drinks and one of them had dry ice in it so it was cool to look at 
Fonda San Miguel,191,Each dish and cocktail was better than the last. The wait staff was knowledgeable  friendly  and attentive. Would highly recommend.   I cannot think of one negative thing to say about this restaurant or my dining experience  I look forward to returning.  The Carne Asada de Tampique a blew my absolute skirt up.
Fonda San Miguel,192,Came highly recommended...and I REALLY wanted to love it...but other then the atmosphere the entire experience was disappointing. Let s start with the fact that s it s INCREDIBLY overpriced... 12 for a Sangria that was maybe 2-3 oz after all the ice the piled in the glass.  11 for guacamole that was maybe half an avocado worth and came with about 4 chips. And then there was my  32 pork chop that came with 3 pieces of potato  zucchini and carrot as a side. I seriously don t mind paying for great food...which brings me to the second problem...the food lacked any flavor whatsoever. Bland  is an understatement...absolutely no flavor. Do yourself a favor...go elsewhere...don t believe the hype.
Fonda San Miguel,193,Fonda is an Austin institution. Fantastic interior Mexican food rivaled only by their unparalleled customer service. Pre-COVID-19  our absolute favorite place to eat was at the bar. We considered it a dual experience... dinner and a show. The pace at which the drink orders roll in and the deftness at which the bartenders pour  mix and shake various libations is a joy to behold.  All of this while still making sure the patrons eating at the bar are well attended. John is our favorite bartender. He is friendly  knowledgeable  grace under pressure and super attentive.  We look forward to in-person dining once COVID-19 is no longer a risk to us. In the meantime  we ll continue to utilize Fonda s curbside pickup to indulge our cravings for one of Austin s best restaurants.
Fonda San Miguel,194,By far my favorite Mexican Restaurant in Austin. Great atmosphere  service and always excellent food. The green sauce served up with tortilla chips  is quite unique... it grows on you with its slightly sweet taste. I ordered a bowl of the Corn soup and it was super rich and creamy ...so be forewarned if you want to get a bowl for an appetizer. Tried the Shrimp in Chipotle sauce  very nicely done. I ve been here several times over the past decade and it s time I reviewed it  
Fonda San Miguel,195,Huge menu  yummy food  great service  even better atmosphere  Will definitely return.
Fonda San Miguel,196,Definitely a special place worth checking out. The exterior and interior are very unique to Austin and the food is good as well. It smells delicious as you re walking into the restaurant.   Duck enchiladas and duck entree were my favorite. Margaritas for  14 were underwhelming - too sweet and packed with so much salt at the rim.  Make sure to ask for extra tortillas with your meal  they are handmade in-house  Ceviche was decent but not worth  16 imo. Tried the tamales which were good  but not worth  9 each. I did think the fried oysters were decent so check that one out  Pork chop was good as well.  Overall a decent experience. Service was slow but they were exceptionally busy on a Monday evening. Might not frequent but will recommend to friends family.
Fonda San Miguel,197,It will be a great mistake to visit Austin and not experience the charm and skill of this legend. The setting is lovely  the margarita Uno is one you will remember for a long time and the food-- experience top quality Mexican cuisine at its finest.  I look forward to repeating soon. Must try-- the pablono with pork  raisins and almonds.
Fonda San Miguel,198,Dinner review. Their brunch is a whole different animal that needs its own discussion.  Apps  Cordero  Grilled baby lamb chops. Super tender and flavor. Keep in mind they are bite-sized - 8.8 10 Drinks  Margaritas on the rocks trump the Frozen ones - 8 10 Entr es  Mixiote  Slow cooked lamb wrapped in a Mexican paper. The seasoning here is ridiculously good  and the meat is falling off the bone tender. Again smaller portions. - 8.5 10   Overall  8.3 10
Fonda San Miguel,199, Make a reservation yelp readers - it s always  full   This is my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in the entire Austin area. Everything from their godly DUCK ENCHILADAS  and their CEVICHE makes my mouth water.  We came here for a fancier date night and as usual had a fantastic meal. We got a last minute dinner reservation for two at 9pm  which was a little later than we would have liked.  We arrived at 8 45 though and got seated right away.  We decided to be a little bit ballsy this time around and order a few appetizers to share and one entree to split.  We had a SERIOUS debate over the duck enchiladas vs the stuffed zucchini... but I lost  somehow we are still together after this defeat...  and we ended up with the stuffed zucchini.  I m not going to lie though everyone - those duck enchiladas made me dream Mexican food for days.  If you have never had them please please please return and do yourself a favor      On to what we actually ordered this go around... We started with the table ceviche.  They have two and I can t recall what the other was named  but the cheaper one is what we ordered and it was about  16. We did not expect it to come out as amazing as it did - because it came with seriously over a POUND OF CEVICHE  All pure perfection.  We were so pleased with it AND ran out of chips by the end even though we were scooping heaps of ceviche on them to enjoy.   Honestly - I unfortunately barely remember the rest of the meal because this was so spectacular  but you can take a glance in my picture .  My recommendations  duck enchiladas  ceviche a marg and an enjoyable date 
Fonda San Miguel,200,Good spot for happy hour  The rest of the menu looks pricey but flavors and food could be worth it  Loved the ceviche and the asada tacos. The chips that come with ceviche are so much better than the ones with the salsa so ask for them  We got slot of food and drink on the happy hour so def would go back for that  The interior is super cool and it s a staple in Austin. I would go back forsure 
Fonda San Miguel,201,Ok the food is pretty good- not like your comadre s home cooking but still good. The atmosphere is really what folks come for- a little slice of Mexico in our backyard. Make reservations as this place gets busy with the Instagram crowd.
Fonda San Miguel,202,My girlfriend and I came here for dinner and it was delicious. The inside and outside is very decorative and very clean. Our server Chandler was very helpful and recommended the queso and carne asada and it did not disappoint. It is a little expensive but you get what you pay for. I highly recommend this place.
Fonda San Miguel,203,Underwhelming. This place gets a ton of hype  but it doesn t live up to it. We came on a Wednesday evening  not particularly busy. They ran out of menus  a bad start for a meal at an experience restaurant. The tortilla chips taste like thin saltines  without the salt. The salsa was good  I liked the green. We had tamales as an appetizer  they were really good. I ordered the duck enchiladas for my meal  which tasted good  not amazing but good. The side of rice and beans came separately  5 minutes later. And for our group of 6  they brought 3 tortillas. That s no big deal  we asked for more  but they only brought 3 more. The whole night felt like they were reluctant to provide us anything  from menus to tortillas. I will never return here if I am paying.
Fonda San Miguel,204,I had been wanting to check out this restaurant for a while now  thinking somehow due to other reviews  it would be an amazing experience. Here are the positives - The parking was easy  the Christmas lights were nice. The exterior and interior were clean. In my opinion  the food was twice expensive as it should be    The portions were very small  nothing gourmet about them  spices and food quality was extremely average.
Fonda San Miguel,205,Will only let you in if you re white. That s why there s only  Ashley   Chris   and  Trevors    if you understand what I mean  giving it 5 star reviews.
Fonda San Miguel,206,We ve been going to  Fonda s  since we arrived in Austin in the late 70s.  The food has always been excellent - we go there for  special occasions . Last night however I noticed the service has become glacial. We sat at a table in the bar area while we waited for our table and not one server came to take our drink order. Escorted to our table and another 20 minutes before we were approached for any order.  The food was excellent - but another eternity before it appeared on our table.  Work  amp  training needs to be done on service.
Fonda San Miguel,207,As someone who is used to eating authentic Mexican food  I was not disappointed by this restaurant. The flavor and authenticity is extremely present in all of the dishes and I thoroughly enjoyed eating here. The restaurant itself is also gorgeous.
Fonda San Miguel,208,You have never had queso until you have tried it at Fonda San Miguel. Great ambiance and decor. Food is excellent. I recommend the shrimp in the creamy chipotle sauce.
Fonda San Miguel,209,Really  really good interior Mexican food.  Great mole sauce.  We sat at the bar and really enjoyed the drinks  dinner  and desert.
Fonda San Miguel,210,Very overpriced   I ordered enchiladas and they were about  24....For like two enchiladas....just two....for  24. That s about  12 per enchilada. For  12 a pop  you might think these enchiladas better be damn good....but they were just okay. There was nothing particularly special about them. I could not figure out why I was paying  24 for two average and basic enchiladas. The plate came with a small serving of rice and beans  but again it was a small serving and again nothing particularly special about these rice and beans. After taxes and tip  I paid almost  30 for a plate of enchiladas and a small serving or rice and beans. Mexican food is not complicated and it should not be this expensive. Any other Mexican restaurant in the city would be more reasonable  potentially more authentic  and of a similar quality. I was not impressed with this place and do not see any reason to go back and pay a premium for average Mexican food.
Fonda San Miguel,211,Just go. This place is incredible. I was given this suggestion by guys I played golf with  and it s easily one of the best restaurants I ve been to in Texas. The salsas were fantastic. The queso fundido was incredible. The appetizer platter with the al pastor tacos was tremendous. And to finish it off  the wagyu tacos were delicious. I can t recommend this place enough.
Fonda San Miguel,212,We had some excellent food    The building is really nice.  The wait staff were attentive and made the experience really good.  The elote soup was a knock out   Then came the tamales appetizer  tremendous.  Chile en Nogada with the walnut sauce and pomegranates knocked it out of the park.  We also had the Enchilada de mole with the pork.  Excellent flavor texture and spice    The experience was really good.  Food was spot on   Would come back often if I lived in Austin   
Fonda San Miguel,213,High end food in an artistic eclectic beautiful environment. Looking forward to returning  The shrimp in spicy chipotle cream sauce was incredible. The duck enchiladas too. The mole chicken wasn t my favorite but the other dishes made it all worth it.
Fonda San Miguel,214,happy hour menu was weak only 4 items.   food was okay but not worth the extra effort to get here.
Fonda San Miguel,215,I m Mexican so I never eat Mexican food food out.  Especially  in Texas where I abhor Tex mex. a delicious fresh ceviche. And a fabulous chicken mole. Stupendous service. Will be back
Fonda San Miguel,216,This is one of Austin s finest eating establishments. As a fellow restaurant owner  I feel that Fonda San Miguel is impeccably operated  front of house and back of house in constant communication. Wait times for tables is never too long- and the bar atrium is perfectly designed to look after guests waiting for tables. The choices of dishes is PERFECT. The chefs are wonderful. The staff are professional and kind. The MARGARITAS are unforgettable. It s hard to go anywhere else for Mexican cuisine  as Fonda San Miguel has set the bar very high. Outstanding  and truly one of the most beautiful restaurants I have been to.
Fonda San Miguel,217,Amazing food  Fun  unpretentious place to eat and very creative menu. The mole dessert sounded weird but ended up making the meal  We will be back 
Fonda San Miguel,218,This is one of the great restaurants of Austin.  If you are a visitor to Austin  this is the one place you must absolutely not miss on your one trip through Austin.  For a more complete treatment of Fonda  see the original review under this one.  This update is purely to indicate the presence of one dish.  Since they published the original dessert menu  they have added a dessert  that makes the sun rise in the west  makes the moon set in the east and makes the world an absolutely perfect place.  The dessert does NOT APPEAR on their standard dessert menu and is only on the new copy of the printed general menu.  You have to ask your waiter for it.  Do so.  It is the Oaxaca Chocolate Mole Cake.  This is despite Fonda having a Tres Leches cake that is better than sex.   Yes  I am absolutely positively certain the Tres Leches cake is better than sex.  Although to be fair   I have not had them both at the same time.   No one should ever turn down Fonda s Tres Leches cake in their life.  It is that much of a peak experience.  Even with the unquestioned excellence of the Tres Leches cake    I still say - get the Oaxaca chocolate cake INSTEAD.       How can you turn down the greatest dessert on the planet   How can you turn down the greatest dessert on the planet for yadda yadda yadda chocolate cake   The curse of dessert at American restaurants is our nation s addiction to chocolate.  Every restaurant on the planet makes a standard chocolate cake for the Americans - because chocolate is the only flavor Americans order   Americans die never having had a Creme de Papaya.   No American younger than fifty has made or eaten a real homemade Indian Pudding.  When was the last time you had an Orange Bavarian   I thought so.  So WHY at one of the great restaurants of the world should you get another goddam chocolate dessert          Because this is MEXICAN chocolate and not AMERICAN chocolate.  Mexican Chocolate means chocolate PLUS CINNAMON.  The cinnamon will change your world.  This is not cinnamon plus sugar like a four year old s cinnamon toast bear.  This is pure and uncut adult fire.  The cake starts in your mouth as chocolate and then manifests its true nature slowly.  You don t really know what you ve eaten until you swallow.  The chocolate taste clears and suddenly your throat is burning  the back of your mouth is burning.   There is no pain.  There is only ..... cinnamon.  And the cinnamon keeps rising and getting more redolent and rising and getting more redolent.  The cinnamon will stay with you for a good two to three minutes after every swallow.         This is the closest experience I have had in a restaurant to smoking good dope.  You get high off the burn in the back of your throat and you can feel the entire world improving around you.  This is a dessert that will play well with whatever tequila you started the evening with.  This is a dessert that will trivialize your appetizers and main course - even if those dishes were legendary.   and the night I had my Oaxaca chocolate cake - my main dish really had been legendary.           But Samuel C   If I do what you say  how will I ever get my mythic and orgasmic Fonda San Miguel Tres Leches Cake    I guess you will just have to eat at Fonda San Miguel twice    
Fonda San Miguel,219,Ugh so disappointed with the food here  I guess I walked in with really high expectations  We went there last night for dinner and I ordered the special appetizer - the crispy oysters which was ok  it was a little salty but ok. The  angel horse back  was the only nice dish. I love the escabeche that came with it was yummy   The main dish was so umm large  I ordered the pork that s wrapped in banana leaf and baked. It was too much of food. Our server told me it was 6 oz of meat but I think it was probably like 12. Somehow it was just not yummy.
Fonda San Miguel,220,The Fonda has long been a family favorite.  We have taken out of town friends and family members there since it first opened. The food  service and ambiance are consistently excellent. We spend about half our visits in the bar were excellent appetizers and cold beers are just the thing.  The carne asada and mole enchiladas are my favorite entrees. We have ordered take-out and look forward to dine-in.
Fonda San Miguel,221,The architecture and design of this place is worth the wait. Gorgeous chandelier in the lobby  plants throughout the space and incredible tile work. And good news  the food was delicious. The ceviche was so tasty  I didn t get a picture because we devoured it.
Fonda San Miguel,222,This is one of Austin s restaurants that sets the bar for other restaurants. Sure it s a little too haughty to have simple nachos but you won t miss them. It s a fantastic happy hour and you have to get there early because it fills up quickly. If you want to stay for dinner reservations are easy to make and many nights are necessary  it s a popular place but the quality remains high. The interior is stunning and makes you feel like you re in another world. It s a real relief on a hot summer day.
Fonda San Miguel,223,The food and service are amazing . I ordered mole and it was so delicious. My boyfriend ordered a steak and he was very pleased.
Fonda San Miguel,224,Five Stars for Five Reasons   1. Consistently very good food - not often sublime  but very good.  2. It s a rare instance of an Austin restaurant that s been around for many years that is still relevant and important in the Austin food universe.  3. There s not really any other place in Austin to compare it to. There are your Tex Mex institutions  the fast casual chains  and the modest mom and pop restaurants on one side  and foodie  chef-driven fare on the other. Fonda is elevated yet accessible food that will please both your parents and your foodie sister-in-law.  4. Excellent atmosphere - a nice space  decorated in a way that feels authentic and unique at the same time. Good service to match.  5. Happy Hour - sit at the bar and have a well-done margarita  share some happy hour dishes with friends  and wind up with a tab that lets Fonda be more than a place for a splurge or special occasion.
Fonda San Miguel,225,This place is a nice hidden gem of Austin. One of the very few places with actual authentic  mexican food. Can be pricey  but worth every penny. I also really enjoyed the pina colada cocktail  Tasted almost like ice cream.   I sat at the bar  which fortunately also offers the full menu. The quesadillas and tacos were absolutely delicious  The portions are not too big or small  just right. You could share if you wanted to as well.  The restaurant itself is so gorgeous  with painted walls and paintings hung everywhere  It s very colorful and vibrant. The pictures do not do it justice. They even gave detail to the tiles   Service was very quick and friendly. I loved my experience here and will definitely be back.
Fonda San Miguel,226,Fonda SAN Miguel never disappoints. Sopecitos were excellent and the vegetarian tamales were very good specially the second round because they were a lot warmer. The cucurrucucu drink is a lot better with mezcal. The most impressive part was that they using earth friendly to go containers.
Fonda San Miguel,227,I feel like people hype this place up as amazing Mexican food  but what you re falling for is the pomp and circumstance of this  faux-hacienda  that you re dining in.  Fonda San Miguel is visually fun--the tile  the plants  the quaint arched doorways  the genuine painted ceramic earthenware  On occasion  the glitterati can even be found dining here  Drinks are ok  they have booze in them so that s good. Otherwise  their complex nomenclatures fail to live up.  What you really get at Fonda is food that s a bit hit or miss  mostly miss. Overall  this is mediocre  overpriced  over-sauced  think entrees sopping in rich  amp  heavy-handed sauces  Mexican food. I m not averse to splurging on meals--priciness isn t the issue per se  but being asked to splurge on such disappointing dishes--that s what I take umbrage to.   There are a few successes on the menu  the guacamole is respectable  quirkily served with sticks of queso blanco. The cochinita pibil is spectacular  when you don t end up with an especially fatty portion of pork.   The service is spotty as well--I ve had perfunctory service  somewhat friendlier service  and outright atrocious service  one time . Depending on when you go  expect significant waits at your table for your server to check in.   Avoid anything served in a sauce  or ask for the sauce on the side.
Fonda San Miguel,228,Ordered the Quesadillas and Fajitas. Both were extremely overpriced  small portioned  and very poor food quality and flavor. The chips taste like a .99 cent giant bag from HEB and the salsa was all watery  lacked any additions and was amongst the worst I ve ever had at a Mexican restaurant. The quesadillas hardly had any chicken in them  were light as a feather  cold and only came with 3. The fajitas came with 5 very small chicken tenders with very little flavor and was almost all onions and peppers. Also the cast iron plate was not even sizzling. A very nice looking place with cool decor and ambience but in terms of food this place which is supposedly a legendary Mexican food establishment in AUSTIN TEXAS of all places totally missed the mark. The food quality was by far the worst Mexican food I ve ever had in TX and I can confidently say Applebee s and Chile s have better Mexican food than this place for a fraction of the price. A true disappointment.
Fonda San Miguel,229,I did some Yelp research before picking Fonda San Miguel for my wife s birthday brunch. Judging by the reviews I really didn t know what to expect. Its  40 per person plus  20 a kiddo  bad service and bland food in some reviews being my source of worries.   We came  we ate  it kicked our ass into food coma. Service could have been only slightly better as I had to ask for one or two tea refills. Otherwise  a splendid display of Interior Mexican grub in a stunning restaurant. Forget the mimosa instead try the horchata  rum  and coffee infused cocktail. We ate   Conchinita Pibil with Marinated Onions Chicken Thighs in Mole Tamales Ceviche Fried Fish with Ancho Aoli  Corn Pudding Roasted Brussel Sprouts Cactus  Nopalito  Salad Guacamole Poached Eggs in Roasted Salsa  Onto the desserts where we sampled bread pudding  flan  assorted cookies  and Tres Leches Cake. Yep  more food coma. I realize there are many reviews that state the price isn t worthy of the cuisine  way off the mark. Just imagine you went to Fiesta over on 38th and IH-35 and bought all the ingredients to make each dish. I m saving you dinero here folks  call two weeks ahead and enjoy 
Fonda San Miguel,230,Imagine the king of Mexico asked you to drop by after church.  Nothing fancy  just a few hundred people. Don t dress up  . You might get something like this. Amazing venison and mole. Actually  amazing almost everything  The black beans are the best I have ever had. The chef took a few minutes with me to explain exactly how he made them. This place is beautiful  with fabulous art and decor  but the food is what stuns. This is one of the best brunches I ve ever had.
Fonda San Miguel,231,The building is really nice and decorated very well. lots of lights from Christmas so it had a romantic vibe.  we went with a group after doing a maze room. no one was extremely hungry but we got seated pretty fast so we looked at the menu and decided to snack. the chips and salsa guy was nice. the water guy was nice  but a little persistent on the water pouring. lol. no worries. our waiter though seem to have a chip on his shoulder. not as nice as the others  things were said quickly  faces were made  I just didn t get a good vibe from him. I thought it was just me until a friend mentioned the same thing. the food was good but a little too pricey. we had the quesadillas and beans.  20 later we weren t really impressed. I probably wont go back because there are too many other places like this to try and nothing form this spot other than location is worth it.  oh and parking was a little confusion  at night. drive slow 
Fonda San Miguel,232,THE SUNDAY BRUNCH IS  39 BUFFET  I m getting that out of the way because when we went my dad misheard the waiter say  13.90 and we paid a lot more for 3 people than we thought.   It was worth it.   Amazing guacamole  tamales  ceviche  lightly battered fried fish  multiple kinds of mole  roasted quail  delicious simmered pork with pickled onions. I was blown away with both the quality and quantity of food.   To be fair I m not a picky eater as far as dietary restrictions. My mom doesn t eat fish and my dad doesn t eat pork but they still had a good variety. Might be a bit limited for vegetarians. But if you are an eater who loves to eat all before you  the variety and quality of Mexican    Maybe Tex Mex I don t know the authenticity  Food.   Great dessert bar as well 
Fonda San Miguel,233,Food is delicious and atmosphere is beautiful. Great for upscale Mexican. Recommend the Pescado de Molo de Ajo  Cochinita Pibil  and Camarones en crema.   Came for graduation and it was the perfect vibe for nice while still fun.
Fonda San Miguel,234,My wife and I paid our first visit to Fonda San Miguel last night and had a wonderful time.  The atmosphere was great - building  grounds and decor.  A lot of places try to do what Fonda San Miguel has done  but it comes across as tacky and or cheesy looking  more so as time places.  Not the case here.  Everything was well taken care of and clean.   There was a fun vibe  which is not common for a restaurant this old  we especially enjoyed seeing how many patrons were known by the staff and seeing them interact on such a friendly level .  Service   Excellent   The hostess was friendly  greeting us with a smile and taking us to our table right away.  Our waiter  Shane  was excellent.  He was friendly  polite  informative  extremely professional  and did an all-around amazing job.  He was on top of everything.    Food   Both my wife and I loved our food.  Everything was well prepared and tasted very fresh.  The complimentary chips and salsas were very good  and my wife really enjoyed the guacamole  I don t like guac .  Our appetizer was a plate of blue corn cheese quesadillas  which were delightful   For our mains  I ordered the CARNE ASADA A LA TAMPIQUE A  Grilled strip of beef tenderloin served with guacamole  rajas  and a cheese enchilada   and it was delicious   The tenderloin was cooked exactly as instructed and was full of flavor.  The rajas were some of the best I have ever had and the cheese enchilada  which was covered in a divine cheese cream  tomatillo   sauce  was divine    I even dipped my tenderloin in it.  I had no trouble finishing everything on my plate.  My wife ordered the CAMARONES EN CREMA DE CHIPOTLE  Gulf shrimp in spicy chipotle cream sauce   which she stated was excellent as well.  I did taste the cream sauce and it was incredible.  We very much enjoyed our visit and will definitely return  hopefully for brunch  .
Fonda San Miguel,235,We weren t able to make a reservation so we just walked in. Hostess was busy talking to her friend and had us looking for our own table instead of telling us if there were any available. Service was a bit slow but our waiter was great.
Fonda San Miguel,236,This place has a cool look but...  1  small parking lot 2  overpriced everything My happy hour margarita was  8.50. Wow. It s only  5.95 on Tuesday s but little did I know  They didn t have a specific happy hour menu or page in the menu. My two cheese enchiladas were 19.50 that included a small amount of rice and beans. Also  the manager was talking with his  friends  and never checked to see how we were doing. We were at the table right next to them. Just absurd. Never eating here again. Overpriced and not worth the money. Wow.
Fonda San Miguel,237, High end Tex-Mex  ha  The food was great  the drinks were great  amp  the ambiance was good  including the inside building decoration. I mostly came here since my name was in the title but hey  the food didn t disappoint. We started out with their queso with chorizo  amp  mannnn was it delicious. It s not your typical queso  its better   Plus they give you tortillas to eat with it  which is bad but so good  Haha  I ate  amp  demolished the shrimp in chipotle sauce  highly recommended. My friend got their cheese enchiladas  amp  was satisfied with that too. Must try 
Fonda San Miguel,238,Wow  This restaurant is amazing  The doors open at 5 to the bar and they can serve a full menu. The dining room opens at 5 30. I had a house margarita and the duck enchiladas  pictured below . The margarita was nice and strong  And the enchiladas were incredibly delicious  the only thing I would ve changed was some heat in the entree.   The service was attentive and accommodating  and very attractive  .   This is on my list of  must-eats  for the Austin area    You will not be disappointed or leave hungry.
Fonda San Miguel,239,This place was very cool  it came highly recommended by a local Austin colleague and it didn t disappoint. We had a small group of 4 business related dinner  sat in the center room in the middle of the action. Great decor  ambience and food.. We had a few apps  ceviche  Angels on horseback  chips  guac  etc.. all very good    Enchiladas for dinner was also great  especially when you wash down with numero uno margarita 14    Great place  great time  would go again.. my colleagues have also hosted large groups here of 20-30   so it can handle it well.
Fonda San Miguel,240,Fonda San Miguel s is Austins premier Mexican Restaurant.  Not to be confused with Tex-Mex cuisine... Fonda San Miguel was founded in the 70 s and for over 45 years has delivered unmatched authentic Mexican recipes that bring back the memories  of their abuelitas cooking...  Great job
Fonda San Miguel,241,Came to this amazing restaurant with an outstanding ambience  and great service that took the family  and I by surprise.  Wow   That s what I will say...it was a very pleasant experience for the family  and I.  The food was prepared fresh  and tasted delicious   And their wine selection was very good too...man  great tasting wines     Note   One of the things that impressed me of this restaurant was their attention to detail when it came to creating their dishes.  It was on point...that there impressed my wife that happens to be from Colima  Mexico.  All of their flavors were real  and very authentic.  And from a gourmet type of restaurant...sometimes you will get a watered down version of the dishes....but  not here.  If you re a vegetarian like myself  I highly recommend the Calabacitas Rellenas.  They re delicious    And if you love coffee too  then...you must try their  Caf  de Olla  which is made with Piloncillo  Cinnamon and of course  Coffee.  It reminded me of when my Mother would make for the family when I was a kid...it was delicious.  I would simply return back to this restaurant just for another cup of this delicious coffee.  Oh  before I forget...you must compliment your meal experience with their delicious desserts and I recommend their Crepas de Cajeta  and their Tres Leches Cake.  They were amazingly delicious    I was in Food Heaven        The family  and I loved our experience here     We will come back for more whenever we re in Austin  Texas   
Fonda San Miguel,242,We used to come years ago and loved it so we were excited to make it back for our anniversary.  Very disappointing. The brunch was lackluster and had many fewer options than years ago. The beans and the ceviche were very good but everything else was mediocre at best. The tortillas were terrible and so were the mimosas The service was terrible. It took 15 minutes to take our drink orders. We had to bring the credit card  to the hostess stand because our server disappeared entirely. There are many Better brunch options.
Fonda San Miguel,243,How is it I always forget about this place   Perhaps because it sits in a sleepy neighborhood which no one seems to know about   It s always busy  so obviously it s not forgotten by everyone.  The first time I ate here it was in the early 80 s and i was on a brunch date.  I misread the menu and thought they offered bottomless mimosas so my date and I blew through a dozen or so and then got the bill.  Surprise  they were not bottomless and I didn t have enough to pay the bill.  They were gracious enough to cut me some slack and took all the cash I had.  How embarrassing  I still got laid so there s that.  This occasion was for a dear friends after wedding nosh.  They had selected three different entree s.  I jumped on the ANCHO RELLENO while the Suz got the COCHINITA PIBIL.  Appetizers were the usual suspects  Guac and Calamari.  The Relleno was simply awesome.  Nicely charred outside and a great mixture meaty goodness inside.  Pibil was moist and also spiced very well.  The waiter suggested pitchers of Margaritas which was an a great suggestion.  When they brought them to the table they poured the ritas individually an served them.  In fact  everything the wait staff did was done very well.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and well appointed with all sorts of art and nick knacks.  what a great evening and a must remember for future visits.
Fonda San Miguel,244,The restaurant has a very vintage vibe  one of the best interior decor Mexican restaurants. It s pricy as well  the salsa is nowhere like the traditional salsa. I don t remember the name of the dish I ordered but it was very different. It contained spiced grated chicken with almonds in white sauce. It was good  something I have never tried at a Mexican restaurant..
Fonda San Miguel,245,While visiting Austin for a company retreat  one of our stops was Fonda San Miguel. The place from the outside was very inviting and the inside was just as nice. We had a reservation for 15  and they had a table ready for us in the back of the restaurant.   Server came right away with chips and salsa  and took our drinks order. I ordered the Pepino Pico  which is a like a spicy margarita with cucumbers and jalape os. Very tasty and had a good kick.  For appetizers  our side of the table ordered the queso fundido with peppers and chorizo  and the ceviche. Both were very tasty. The ceviche was a very good portion and it tasted very good. The fundido was also tasty and it came with homemade flour and corn tortillas.  For my entree I decided on one of the weekly specials which was a Duck with Mole Verde. It was so good I finished my plate so fast. Came with a side of rice and beans  which was also very tasty  but the mole verde was delicious. I wish they would tell this in a bottle to take back home.  Parking was very easy  and they even provide a  12 valet parking. Service was great and we never had anything missing.  Highly recommend this place  it was very authentic and had plenty of options for everyone. Below are some pictures of everything I just described.
Fonda San Miguel,246,Great spot nestled in ATX  I love the beautiful decor and Mexican tile. I also love the food and the service here. I always get the lamb lollipops...so delicious and tender. I also share the quest fundido with my friend each time. It s melted cheese in a skillet with peppers or chorizo on top...so decadent. They give you three types of tortillas too. Lastly  I loved the wine I had last night. It was a cab called  Hanh.  It was an incredible glass of wine that made me ask the waiter if we could photograph the bottle 
Fonda San Miguel,247,I was looking forward to finally checking out Fonda San Miguel  since it been in Austin for 45 years. I was extremely disappointed with the outcome. The tortilla chips tasted stale  food was cold and barely had much flavor. Matt s el Rancho never disappoints and they are only 3.5 stars on yelp... how is this place rated higher  
Fonda San Miguel,248,Reluctantly took an out-of-towner to Fonda San Miguel at her request. I hadn t dined there since my mediocre experiences in 2012.   Food is extraordinary again  Dare I say it  Yes  it s better than ever  and that s saying a lot.  Moist  flavorful falling-off-the-bone chicken served with mole sauce that would have made the nuns who created this recipe proud.   The carne asada left my foodie guest swooning  and she proclaimed it the best meal of her trip  which included visits to many of San Francisco and New Orleans  best restaurants .  Service was perfection.   Fonda San Miguel is back on my list of best restaurants... anywhere.
Fonda San Miguel,249,Our waitress Angela was rude  amp  several of our guests  food was cold. Won t be coming back.
Fonda San Miguel,250,John at the bar is absolutely amazing. I m traveling alone  and had never been here and was honestly kinda overwhelmed by the menu. He took the time to walk me through the whole thing  and answer all of my questions. He was attentive  preemptive and kind. I had the most amazing meal  and the most incredible service. Thank you 
Fonda San Miguel,251,I can t believe I ve lived in Austin so long and haven t experienced this midtown gem  The decor is stunning except for the pliers left out on the restaurant s centerpiece. . No worries. Waiter was delightful and extremely patient with my friend s apparently less than genius husband. I was sooo embarrassed- but that s another story. Friend had the stuffed chiles - she was very pleased. I had the duck enchilada recommended by the waiter. Slight heat from the poblanos in the sauce but really yummy. The duck stood out nicely. Their shrimp dishes are sorely overpriced. I ll pay more for an institution  but this was a slap in the face.  This is a great place for out of town guests. Just be prepared to spend a little more.
Fonda San Miguel,252,As usual  Fonda San Miguel lived up to my expectations for food  service  and ambiance.  This visit was actually on July 17 - not today.  I had a margarita  Ceviche las Brisas  and CARNE ASADA A LA TAMPIQUE A as the main dish.    All were fantastic.  This is the first time I have been there during the COVID-era  and I was very pleased that they are giving good attention to distancing  wearing masks  etc..  My wife and I both felt safe - and were able to totally relax and enjoy the dinner.
Fonda San Miguel,253,Yesterday January 4th arrived around 7 30pm our table is party of 10 back of restaurant. My friend bday girl in the end of celebration asked server  Diego to split checks to each individual check. This is not acceptable response  YOU MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME AND SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME FROM BEGINNING   his tone of voice also raised.This is our first experience here and this caliber place this kind of response not appropriate. I m very disappointed in service provided yesterday.
Fonda San Miguel,254,Came originally just for the amazing design and history of this building but had to leave a review after trying the food. I think it s fairly priced when you compare it to large chains that claim themselves to be authentic Mexican food. I did not try the drinks- I ordered the Ancho Relleno and my sweetheart had the Cochinita Pibil which was a large portion. I absolutely loved the green salsa. It reminded me of the classic Suiza sauce my aunt in Mexico makes for enchiladas sometimes. I loved the ambience   Attention to detail is so important and Fonda San Miguel delivers that and so much more. The tortillas are handmade and really made me nostalgic for my grandmother who passed away a couple of years ago. They also have some of the best customer service I ve had at a Mexican restaurant. Our waiter was well trained on the plates and their origins. We ordered the crepas con cajeta and they were a little different than what I expected but none the less super delicious  I will be making Fonda San Miguel a regular stop when I visit Austin and can t wait to bring back my whole family next time.
Fonda San Miguel,255,My favorite Mexican restaurant on earth. The mole is stunningly great some of the best ever. The tortilla soup was invented here and it has a character of flavor that you won t get elsewhere. Run  don t walk if you get the chance to visit.
Fonda San Miguel,256,Hey PIYUSH A. You are a moron. You should just go and get your movie theater liquid cheese substance  and your Sam s club chips and stay at your house away from the public . This great restaurant actually serves authentic Mexican food as they make it in finer restaurants in Mexico . Yes the Oaxaca cheese has a different texture and that s part of the joy of it  not to mention it s exquisite ta ste. And you complained about the price but ATX Cochina is several times more and gives you a lot less food.
Fonda San Miguel,257,Like the James Bond of Mexico food   FSM gets it right gets it tight.  Sexy ambience and good looking service.  But far most important FSM serves really tasty food from high quality ingredients. Like Bond  recipes  amp  food quality are killer.   My first time and I ate the duck enchiladas served with rice and beans  so tender  amp  sauce was excellent- not too rich or heavy just plain tasty  and lobster ceviche  which was perfectly mixed and sauced-not too citrusy which is where I think a lot of ceviches go wrong .   So from these two items I m going to take the risk of assuming everything is good on this menu. Bond takes risks. Why can t I    And I m pretty sure James Bond eats gluten but for those of us who can t  they do have a great gluten free menu that includes almost the whole menu. Yeah 
Fonda San Miguel,258,This place is definitely overrated for me. Felt like the restaurant spent more effort impressing me with decoration than with the actual food we were served. Positives  The drinks were good and not watered down. I enjoyed my margarita. The queso asado with homemade chorizo was amazing. 1 of the 4 tortillas we were brought was blue corn  which is hard to come by around here. Negatives  Only light beers on the menu. The tortilla soup and calamari were pretty awful.   We didn t finish them  and they didn t seem to have anything especially Mexican about them... If not for the drink and cheese appetizer  I would have rated this place as a terrible. If this is fine dining  I ll save the money and make this stuff at home.
Fonda San Miguel,259,An AUSTIN staple. Beautiful on the inside. Great food for over 20 years. I just celebrated my birthday here with a larger sized party.
Fonda San Miguel,260,An Austin institution that never fails to impress.   Consistently excellent food  amp  great service. Delightful assortment of margaritas. AND a parrot   In addition to fabulous dinners  amp  a legendary Sunday brunch  they have a stellar Happy Hour.
Fonda San Miguel,261,Yes the food was amazing. This review should be a 5 5. Amazing carne asada  lamp chops and ceviche. My son loved his enchiladas and tamales were good. Desert here is a 1 000 10. Mango ice cream and tres leches cake was some of the best I ve ever had in my whole life. Why the 4  Oh I wanted to give a 5 and make this a place we go monthly to but the service was pretty bad like many pointed out. Our waiter never checked up on us that much and all of it made sense when we got our check. I hated in New York when restaurants forced tips on their patrons at a certain   and I met my first Texas restaurant that did this. You take the need for the wait staff to even wait on table. Of course the wait staff doesn t care they are guaranteed a 28  tip  Be warned on guaranteed high gratuity that s not posted anywhere. I really liked the food but service really upset my wife. I can t blame her in hindsight. Don t have any expectations of good service and you should be fine. I d be okay spending 200 dollars for food AND service not just good food.
Fonda San Miguel,262,I would give this place 5 stars if I could afford to eat here other than their happy hour options and I would give them a 4 star rating if their service was better than what we experienced but unfortunately those two things are quite big issues and I am afraid that I just would not come here for dinner or even on special occasions. Their pricing is very very high and the service was just very poor. The waiters on multiple visits were very unfriendly to the point that our table felt like we were being talked DOWN to. Either way I really like their happy hour and on Tuesdays it is all day so we will be back and will continue enjoying them as long as they do not give us MORE reason not to come here hehe
Fonda San Miguel,263,This is the place for traditional Mexican. The prices are slightly high but definitely worth it. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. The decor was beautiful. I also appreciated how the lighting was perfect for a romantic date or a friendly dinner out.
Fonda San Miguel,264,This is now the best Mexican restaurant I have been in. The Red Iguana in SLC is number 2.
Fonda San Miguel,265,3 stars. Great dining experience. Lots of snooty privilege in the building  but the ambience was great  great decor  lighting  etc. Good atmosphere. Had the melted cheese queso with tortillas and it was good  but super oily and fatty. Had the pollo asado  fajitas  and the portion was skimpy - 5 small tender sized breast pieces laid over a bed of grilled onion and peppers. It was tasty  but thankfully I was not too hungry  so I was able to finish it without wanting more. My wife and friend polished off their enchilada suiza and fish dished. Watermelon  margarita tasted like a jolly rancher and was excellent.  So  3 stars is mainly for the bang for the buck - the high price you pay for the smallish portions. I get that this is one of Austin s true Mexican locations  no tex-Mex  but there s no way anyone should smile while charging  22 for the portion I received. Still looking for real good mexican food in Austin. The search continues
Fonda San Miguel,266,I ve tried Fonda twice but despite high hopes this restaurant is overrated  amp  overpriced. A limited menu with a snooty waiter led to a predictable outcome. If want to discourage questions from your guests  list the ingredients in each dish so the patron knows what they are ordering. I ordered the Carne Asada medium and it came out jerky. Our server seemed bothered by questions when ordering so I didn t bother to mention. My companion ordered the rotisserie chicken. Previously I did not realize one could serve dry flavorless rotisserie chicken  but now I know. I dine out 6-10 times a week and vote with my feet. They will not lead me back. Terrible food compounded by terrible service.
Fonda San Miguel,267,I vacationed in Austin a few weeks back and a friend recommended this place. I was served the most amazing fish by a waiter named Diego. He was attentive and well versed on the menu options. Diego made our evening out and unforgettable experience. We will definitely be back 
Fonda San Miguel,268,We went to celebrate a friend s birthday and we ordered the appetizer queso fundido with green chili strips...and the pork chop plate. The queso was very good and the pork chop was cooked perfectly and the veggies were also delicious even though I thought the portion of veggies was a bit small.  The waiter James was very attentive to all our requests. The margaritas and pina coladas were super delicious  I loved all the Christmas decor  We had such a wonderful dining experience that we will definitely be back  Highly recommend this restaurant.
Fonda San Miguel,269,Sophisticated meets traditional Mexican a la Austin.  The BEST Sunday Brunch in Austin.   36 per person.  Make reservations for early...we were there at 11am and were immediately seated.  Excellent service - you will want for nothing.   A seemingly endless buffet with options and options and options.  There is literally something for everyone.  Tamales  enchiladas  omelettes  huevos rancheros  migas  chilaquiles  and so much more.  A wonderful experience making for a GREAT weekend in Austin.
Fonda San Miguel,270,Well their brunch is overrated absolutely expensive. I would say food is ok but not for their price. Their margaritas are good and service was good except the person who was at the buffet with an awful attitude. I don t think I ll return to this place
Fonda San Miguel,271,I have been meaning to try this place for some time and finally got around to it on a Saturday night.  We did not have reservations and there was a 45 minute wait.  Fortunately  we scored two seats at the bar.  I was Hangry and could not wait.  A Margarita and Quesadillas were ordered.  The Margarita was good.  Not too sweet but it was small for the price.  The Quesadilla appetizer was tasty and authentic.  We thought about waiting for a table but decided to eat our entrees at the bar.  I had the Chicken Mole enchiladas. The mole sauce was rich and tasty  but there were only two enchiladas and they were small.  There was a side of rice and beans.  Not to sound like a glutton  but I feel the size of the entree was quite small for the price charged.  My lady friend had the tamales.  These were tasty and authentic but again quite small.  The ambiance is pretty chill and the service was good.  The meal was tasty but I feel it was quite overpriced.  This is an Austin classic since 1975.  I have checked it off.  I doubt I will return.  Too many good Mexican food trucks that cost less than half the price.
Fonda San Miguel,272,First thing first  the restaurant was uncomfortably hot with no running AC in the area they placed us which made for an uneasy dining experience. Secondly  we scanned the QR menu placed at the table but were told that basically nothing would be available and that there was a very limited buffet section. When we stood up to go  one of the waitresses very rudely yelled at my grandma that she could not serve herself. However  our waiter did not tell us  there was no sign  and there were other people serving themselves. We went for breakfast and the only egg option was huevo a la mexicana  we asked if we can get regular sunny side up eggs and the same lady told us they could not do that for us. The only reason I m not putting 1 star is that our waiter helped us accommodate some food for the kids in our party and he was very helpful and kind. Food was exaggeratively expensive for having basically less than 8 options to eat and the bad dining experience.
Fonda San Miguel,273,Not so great this last time. There are many rules that seem to serve to reduce customer involvement - no salad substitute for rice and beans  which puts 2 enchiladas at about  20   no coffee refills  only one gratis dessert per table  we were celebrating several birthdays   and almost non-existent service. We had to flag down our waitress to get anything - no automatic water or tea refills. Overall it felt like they wanted to move the crowds through faster.  Food wise  my enchiladas seemed to be leaning more towards TexMex  more cheesy  which is not what we come there for. Sad to say but after many years  we are not going back.
Fonda San Miguel,274,Parking is very limited. Last visit there on a Friday night  they had valet.   Place is fun to look at inside. You expect the Mexican decor but not the Chinese type things hanging from the ceiling  Very interesting.   The food is good. Very good. On my last visit there were 6 of us and I believe we all had something different. The mole is good but a bit sweet for me. The tacos al pastor are moist and tasty but I believe my favorite is the chile relleno. The apps were good but not memorable.   The service was less than friendly. He acted like he had been working there a million years and was less than helpful.   Dinner is truly a 3 star experience for me but brunch is 4-5 stars  that s a whole other review . Hence  overall I m giving 4 stars.
Fonda San Miguel,275,Attended for a Tuesday company event where they had a specialized menu for us. I got the Carne Asada a la Tampiquena  which is a grilled strip of beef tenderloin with black beans and a side of guacamole. This dish was really good and the beef was very tender. My only issue was the flavor of it. There wasn t much flavor at all if I did not use the sauce on the side. Besides that  everything was OK. The drinks are really great  I suggest the margarita. The presentation of the place and the food itself are second to none. It is an authentic Mexican dining experience.
Fonda San Miguel,276,Such a great experience. Totally worth it. Our waiter was really helpful and patient with us too.  Can t wait to go back after the pandemic -- it will be one of my first sit-down dinners out 
Fonda San Miguel,277,Food was seriously the best I ve had in awhile  Atmosphere was pretty fancy so beware of that as far as clothing choices. Server was excellent and super nice   Pictured  calabacitas rellanas.
Fonda San Miguel,278,This review is for brunch   It is a  40 buffet  no table menu service. I would not recommend for a special occasion. If you enjoy eating heaps of surprise food  standing in line for your meal  and crowds then this is your jam.
Fonda San Miguel,279,I went on a quick business trip to Austin  so I Googled  best restaurant in Austin.   It came back with an article that listed 5 top restaurants in Austin  and this place was at the top of the list.  My boss and I were blown away how awesome this restaurant is.  The waiter told us the same family has been running this restaurant in the same building for 40 years now  so you know they re doing something right.  The mole poblano enchiladas were superb.    Our only complaint was they don t have any draft beer  but they do have bottled beer.  Aside from that minor issue  the service was extraordinarily good and the food was to-die-for delicious.  I would almost be willing to pay for another plane ticket to Austin just to go back and eat here again.
Fonda San Miguel,280,Amazing Mexican food  Meats were tender. Tortillas are homemade nice and soft. The only weird part was that the guacamole was too cold like it just got out of the refrigerator. Preferably like my quac room temperature. All in all really good for here in Austin. All of the sauces were unique and rich 
Fonda San Miguel,281,This restaurant has a good scenery. This restaurant charges way too much for it to mediocre Mexican food. The Sunday brunch is way too overpriced for it minimal selections that are not high-quality at all. If you want to spend  100 for two people at a brunch definitely find somewhere else worth the money. The food and atmosphere is good this place is just way too overpriced for what else you can find within the city.
Fonda San Miguel,282,Two stars because it was open  and for the cool portraits of the owners. Unfortunately  no stars for food  so overpriced it was embarrasing. Remember  people  when it s all said and done  it s a dollars worth of chicken  and ten cents worth of rice and beans. If you don t mind paying 23.00 for it  then for it. But the taste profiles seem to have been styled from  at least as well as I can remember  the taste that one would get when they lick the dirt off dirty tire rims. No. Really.
Fonda San Miguel,283,Came here for happy hour.  Fonda San Miguel is very unassuming once you find it  as it s one of those hidden gems that you d pass by without knowing.  Once you get past the front doors  it s as if you ve entered another world. The decor is outstanding. The service was top notch. The food was good. I had high expectations coming here  so that may be why it was just good.  The guacamole was excellent. The strips of queso blanco and lettuce leaves were a great touch. The calamari was fresh but the breading wasn t to my liking as much because of the spicy breading used.  The chipotle sauce that came with it was good.   The chicken with mole sauce tasted a bit funny as it didn t have that chocolate taste that I m accustomed to.  The happy hour  specials  left something to be desired but all in all a pleasant experience.
Fonda San Miguel,284,Fonda San Miguel is my favorite restaurant in Austin for a special occasion. I ve been many times over the years for its great interior Mexican food  especially the mole   elegant interior  beautiful bar and excellent service.  All of the food is great. It s definitely not a cheap Tex-Mex place so don t be shocked when you pay  20 for enchiladas. Last night  they had Chile in Nogada on the specials menu. This is normally a Christmas time specialty so I was happily surprised to see it. It was excellent.  The service especially hit a high note last night. Our waiter  Tom  was knowledgeable  attentive and friendly without being overbearing and chummy. He really set a new standard for service.  For a special dinner  you can t beat Fonda San Miguel 
Fonda San Miguel,285,Came for a nice girls dinner the last night of my bachelorette party here and it was delicious   Beautiful restaurant  amazing food  and great cocktails. Recommend the fajitas and the spicy cucumber marg. Our server was friendly  fast and gave great recommendations 
Fonda San Miguel,286,We went here for my husband s birthday and experienced a delightful and memorable evening. First we had drinks in the patio area with its own parrot. Afterwards we had dinner in the rustic hacienda inspired dining area.  Our waiter Eddie took excellent care of us and really made sure the evening was a stand out. It was classic old school Austin-chill and laid back vibe with no pretense. We had the chili relleno as an appetizer-flavorful   the Mexican corn soup-outstanding and baked zucchini and roasted chicken with tres leches for dessert. We also had strong french press coffee with our cake. We can t wait to try the brunch.
Fonda San Miguel,287,Really unique atmosphere. Margaritas and fondu was sooo good.  Dinner was great as well.  Make sure you get there early or get reservations  it gets to a long wait easily.
Fonda San Miguel,288,I heard about this place and it was described as  interior Mexican   Ate the lamb cooked in banana leaves  it was amazing. This isn t tex-mex  but it s awesome 
Fonda San Miguel,289,Mexican food fine dining. Good focus on service. Had the Shrimp with Chipotle Cream Sauce. Fantastic  
Fonda San Miguel,290,This is our go to date night spot  We love Fonda  The staff is always wonderful  the food is always great and the margaritas are YUM  Highly recommend the flank steak and the duck enchiladas.
Fonda San Miguel,291,It was my first time trying it with my roomie and we absolutely loved the food  margs  service ambiance and beauty of the place. Def will come back     Favs  - margs - relleno de Piccadillo
Fonda San Miguel,292,Omg this place from the front door valets opening my door  please acknowledge their service  to the server Joel who dealt with our complicated birthday toast table lol  the place is awesome and look at this special chicken  I love this place for ambiance and FOOD  Guacamole is best I have had in Austin the cooks here rock   
Fonda San Miguel,293,This place is great  Definitely the place for a special night  the environment is good for dating  anniversary or some special event. I love the lambs  Other food ordered was ok.
Fonda San Miguel,294,Omg    I feel like a big fat pig. I ate so much  This place is a must try if you are looking for something other then TexMex. This has food from different regions of Mexico. Everything was delicious and the atmosphere is gorgeous.  However this brunch does come with a hefty price of  38.98 per person
Fonda San Miguel,295,This is NOT Tex-Mex smothered in cheese or sauce type place. This is more authentic. Incredible meal. I had the duck enchiladas and my husband had the Chile relleno. My kids loved the bistec street tacos. Best margarita I ve ever had  Save room for dessert bc the tres leches is tasty.
Fonda San Miguel,296,this is a lovely and upscale Mexican restaurant.   Great food and service.  Really liked their shrimp in chipotle cream sauce.   Highly recommend this dish.
Fonda San Miguel,297,I m from a town that borders Mexico  I ve had my fair share of fajita  and I just LOVE this place.  From the decor to the service to the food - this is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin.  I always get the chicken chile relleno. The pepper is cooked to perfection  and the filling is traditional and amazing.   Even when the place is packed -as was the case last night- I never find myself searching for my waiter. They seem to just pop up out of nowhere guessing what you need  in my case  a bowl w ice to chill the wine bottle .
Fonda San Miguel,298,Finally found my spot for great Mexican food in Austin  Makes me miss home just a little less. Had my staple dish - Suiza  Chicken  Enchiladas and they were delicious  The rice and beans were great as well. Authentic style cooking and I really appreciated that  The margaritas are tasty. We sat in the bar and it was lovely. You know the place is packed  but it feels quaint and tranquil almost. You are in a beautiful solarium  and the courtyard provides a lot of privacy - I was surprised. You could see into the main dining which is different but still well used space  that appeared comfortable  albeit less private. Bathrooms were clean and adorable  In my opinion  hard to see from the street  but as you walk up  you ll see why. Set back a bit and they designed every part of that property  and really well  . Plenty of parking  I found a spot in the smaller parking lot and it was perfect  quick walk to the door  up the awesome path in the garden they built around it - which is stunning . I love their style  literally everything about it. So glad I have my spot  it s absolutely critical  Please enjoy this place - I hope they are around for forever  and don t change   Enjoy 
Fonda San Miguel,299,Definitely find this beauty of a restaurant if you desire to experience authentic food from the interior of Mexico. Take opportunity to ask your server the charming history of the place and be sure to stroll the rooms  stopping to enjoy the whimsical collection of art. Note  If it s extra busy with a wait  don t hesitate more than a nano-second to pull up a chair at tables in the bar s nooks and crannies  The ambiance is memorable. The cuisine is delectable--I need say no more. Calabasitas vegetarian entree please   I d go back solely for that dish.  The menu is a very craftful study. Everyone from valet -- just DO IT -- to the original owner making a hospitable walk-through epitomized a welcome pride in San Miguels offerings.
Fonda San Miguel,300,Been here twice and have had good experiences each time. The first time I came I got the Enchilada Suizas  which comes with a sour cream sauce and it was great  Huge portion too. The second time I came  I got the Carne Asada a La Tampique a which is a huge strip of beef tenderloin which was amazing as well  It looks like a skirt steak  but it s not  The fact that it s tenderloin means it s very tender and can be cut with a spoon  Amazing flavor and it also came with one enchilada as well. Very filling. The ambiance here is laid back  amp  traditional. The prices are a bit on the higher end  but it s worth it  Satisfied with both my visits.
Fonda San Miguel,301,Didn t dine at this establishment  but if the food was anything like their cocktails...I d seriously rethink choosing another establishment. I ve had better margaritas at Gloria s that don t break the bank. The El Numero Uno was terrible and tasted of cheap tequila. The waiter didn t think to ask if I was wanting a frozen margarita or on the rock...yes their was one ice cube in the middle of my warm   15 margarita. The place was beautiful  but the price point is high end. It would be one thing if it was worth it but the food and the smells in the restaurant seemed rather bland. Save your money and visit any other place.
Fonda San Miguel,302,Great anniversary dinner at Fonda San Miguel tonight.  Food was superb    Asst. Manager Danny helped us set everything up and our waiter  Eddie  was the best  If you have a special occasion  you d be smart to have it here.  This is a real Austin treasure.
Fonda San Miguel,303,The Mexican food is the best  their salads very good as well.  Their service is ok but once you ask for what you need they will bring it to you.  I don t like it when they take to long to bring what you ask for  for example more coffee I think they can improve their service by been more friendly and more welcoming with all their customers.  The restaurant decorations are high up beautiful very Spanish looking culture.  I have my own small business and I know there is nothing better than been friendly with your customers.  But once again the brunch is five star for their delicious Mexican food.  I ll be back for sure.
Fonda San Miguel,304,Best Mexican restaurant that I have visited in the US and I have visited tons. True traditional Mexican flavor  great decoration and atmosphere. Great service. Most importantly  great food 
Fonda San Miguel,305,35 years ago  you were the only restaurant serving fine  interior Mexican cuisine.  Today  you aren t.  If I had reviewed you then  maybe 5 stars would have been appropriate  even so  I d have to update in a world filled with reality.  This is a beautiful restaurant.  The hosts are much more cordial than in the past  not naming names..  so put this on the plus column.  There has always been a parking squeeze here  but it s in a neighborhood. Plenty of street parking has always been available. Even so  the restaurant has gone the way of the valet. This  plus the pricing keep me from going  but for very special occasions.  The traffic flow of the restaurant means you ll be queued behind 5-6 cars  even at 6pm on a Saturday night.  It is irritating beyond belief  particularly when you see a dozen empty spots.  If the valet was removed  I d say parking is in the plus column too.  For now  I recommend the side street. Avoid the snarl.  Ok  so the service.  It s impeccable. Always has been  I m betting it always will be.  Plus column.  The drinks are good  pours are strong  but  13 for the top shelf margarita is annoying  when it comes served in a low ball glass.  So yes  it s strong  but where s the rest of it    And last weekend  the bar was running at half strength due to renovations. Did they mention this at the time of our reservation  I think not. Negative column.  The food- Mole-- several of us agreed it s better at Manuel s  personally  I prefer Alma s  Tomatillo  verde - outstanding  best in Austin Peccadillo relleno- very tasty  but again  I like Manuel s so much better Black beans are outstanding  chips and salsa are great  better than Manuel s .   Tres Leches  passed around the table. No one loved it and in fact a single serving remained 2 3rds eaten after 10 tasters.   I found it too coarse and dense  yes I know it needs some density  but think cornbread    And the prices omg.  Just under  20 for one stuffed pepper with white rice and beans.  28 for the special which was 4  1 2  baby back ribs.    It s for celebrations.  There are a lot of Austinites  thus celebrations occur often and they do well.  Should they   Well  I was there for my husbands birthday  but it will never make our favorites list
Fonda San Miguel,306,I had heard many great things about this place from the charm of its aesthetics and ambiance to how fantastic the food is to how pricey it can be. I finally decided to see for myself what all the fuss was about and check out their famous Sunday Brunch.  Let me first say that the decor of this place is absolutely gorgeous and reminds me of one of my fav restaurants back in Guadalajara  Mexico  From the beautifully painted outdoor facade and the intricate huge wooden doors to the breathtaking open air skylight foyer when you walk it  the rod-iron chandelier is just wow  to all the little details in the paintings and tiles that line the walls  to the various other chandeliers that grace the ceilings of the dining rooms to the fun art in the bathroom and bar. This restaurant is a cultural-intro to the glories of Mexican artistry and decor. So a solid 5-stars for the decor alone   Now where the 3-star rating comes in. The food from the buffet was pretty good  but at a jaw-dropping  40  you should plan to spend at least half your day here to get your money s worth. The buffet spread was ok  but again  for the price  I would have expected more. There was a little salad area  a vegetarian side  a meats side  and a dessert side. The scalloped potatoes were ok  the tamale was a little on the bland side  and the brussels sprouts were a bit overcooked  but still flavorful. As for the meats  the mole verde was probably my least fav of the four. The beef was good and flavorful. The pollo con mole was a little disappointing. I am a bit of a mole snob and the mole was on the sweeter side and did not have the thickness I prefer. It was good  but nowhere near the best I have had. Surprisingly  the winner for me was the pork w pickled onions. It is surprising as I do not usually eat pork nor onions  but it smelled and looked so delicious and again for  40 I was pretty much going to try almost EVERYTHING. The pork itself was perfectly cooked and flavored  but the pickled onions just pushed it out of this world  By far my fav thing of all the buffet offerings. As for the desserts  there were definitely plenty of options  but I was starting to get full so I had the flan  the tres leches  the macaroons  and the fruit tart. All of which were fine  but nothing mind-blowing. Of the desserts I had  the flan was my favorite. I had the coffee as my included drink and I must say it was top notch  but waiting for refills was a bit trying. They could easily have set out carafes with coffee and I would have been a much happier  and much more caffeinated  patron.  The other reason for the 3-star rating was I was not a fan of having to trade in your plate for a clean plate when I was ready to go back to the buffet. The way they work it is your waiter comes to the table and you order your drinks  only coffee and tea in included  which again for  40 they could throw in at least one mimosa  and brings out a plate so you can go to the buffet. This is fine in the beginning  but once the place starts getting packed and you haven t seen your waiter in a hot minute  or their hands area already full w drinks or plates from the other tables he is attending to  it is very frustrating  if not annoying  to be sitting there wanting to be able to go back and try and get your  40 worth of food and having to wait for the waiter to not only clear your plate  but to then come back with a new one. If they do not want to keep clean plates at the buffet itself then maybe they need to have them somewhere else where they are accessible at the patron s convenience  to keep beating a dead horse   40 should entitle me to make as many trips to the buffet as I would like WHEN I would like  without having to wait for a plate   My secondary gripe was the layout of the seating area we were in. The table we were at was nice  but for where I was seated  I was up against the wall and our table was too close and angled oddly to the table next to us  so even when my friend scooted his chair all the way in  I was still barely able to get out and coming back with a plate full of food  my friend had to get up so that I could access my seat without spilling my plate. Another friend who sat caddy-corner to me had the exact same issue with the large table behind her.   In any case  I was happy for the experience and absolutely loved the ambiance  but will not return for the  50 brunch  after tax and tip . I have had much more extravagant and elegant brunches for far less and the ones that ran the  40 gambit at least included champagne. While ambiance is important and this particular restaurant is beautifully and elaborately decorated  the price did not match the product in my opinion.
Fonda San Miguel,307,Well to say the least the food was good  but the atmosphere of seating was awkward. The have a great happy hour on Tuesday s in the bar area that lasts from 5 til close so it gets packed. Margarita s are  5.95 and the appetizers are good prices as well. The weird thing is where they constitute the bar seating. They had my part at a large round table with a gigantic vase flower ensemble in the middle of the room as soon as you walk in the door. Some patrons were tucked in these dark corners. Very odd layout for a restaurant  but as long as you don t mind your seating situation its a decent place to go for a cheap happy hour.
Fonda San Miguel,308,The two stars are for ambience. I have no star for service or food.   Pushing old fish onto customers    Adding MSG to you hack sauces    Ceviche is a fresh mix of shellfish with lime juice. Not with creamy mystery sauce and vegetables outnumbering the fish.  If people are treating this above 3 stars..they are people who do not understand 5-star dining.  If you are into the Cheese Factory  Carrabas and every other chain...you will love Miguel s food.  I doubt they even have a chef.  I see several comments from weirdos saying this review killed the chef   As I mentioned  there was no chef.
Fonda San Miguel,309,Quesos Fundido over the top  Tacos Al Pastor over the top  Baby lamb chops WAY over the top. And that is just the appetizers. Mole enchiladas over the top  then ran out of room. Top shelf margarita OVER the top  waiter over the top. Ambiance SO over the top. Those in the know don t even read these reviews  they just show. This is for those of you who don t know. One of the top in Austin for upscale South of the border cuisine.
Fonda San Miguel,310,I came here for a work dinner on a Thursday evening. The restaurant was packed  so reservations are recommended. There were lots of parking spots in their parking lot  but they were all taken so we had to park on the street.  The restaurant looked pretty fancy  great place to impress on a date if that s what you re looking to do. Although it s Mexican  the decor reminded me a lot of Indian restaurants. We had a very attentive server who took great care of us. To start  I ordered a michelada. It came in 4 cups  the cup with ice and salt along the rim  the beer  a shot of lime  and a shot of hot sauce. I was hoping that they would mix it together for me because I suck at making it myself. As a result  I thought the drink was just okay. For dinner  I ordered the camarones en crema de chipotle. It tasted amazing  yummy shrimp and rice in a spicy  creamy chipotle sauce.  I decided not to order dessert  but the tres leches cake looked amazing.
Fonda San Miguel,311,Wow     Just Shocked when I walked into a restaurant of this caliber in Austin ... This was a restaurant that I felt I would find in NYC  LA or Miami   Food was incredible  drinks excellent and 5 star staff ... and for the price    Completely would have paid more the food  service and for the experience  
Fonda San Miguel,312,Absolutely fantastic atmosphere  such an authentic feel and classic service. Authentic style and great Mexican food.   Recommend the Tacos Al Pastor and the Corredo  The frozen margarita is delicious   This venue is perfect for ties and tux as well as jeans and boots. Absolutely favorite restaurant. My father used to work with Miguel and he is always very welcoming and courteous.
Fonda San Miguel,313,We took a friend to dinner to Fonda San Miguel last week based upon it s long term reputation and Yelp reviews.  We were greatly disappointed.  The portions were small and the prices were outrageous. My wife order one of the daily seafood specials that was far from acceptable.  The fish was covered in a wet garnish and was near flavorless.  My chicken fajitas were very tasty but limited to about 4 ounces of protein.  Our guest complimented the flavor in her rellano  but it was small and looked very lonely on the plate.  Three dishes  three ritas and a glass of wine for  122.  Just not worth the value.  I would go across the street  get twice the food for half the price.
Fonda San Miguel,314,I love this place. It s gaudy and in the best way. The spinach salad is amazing  but it s the POLLO PIBIL I come back for every time. Just. Cannot. Be. Topped. A great place for some good ole fashion day drinking too.
Fonda San Miguel,315,Delicious  Upscale  indoor Mexican. I took a large group of clients here  and everyone loved it. The cocktails gave everyone a good start  and the appetizers were large enough that we didn t churn through them too quickly.  Our group ordered a wide variety of main courses  from tacos to grilled seafood  I had some wonderful spicy shrimp   and everyone enjoyed what they got.  Very good and attentive service  too.  The decor was fun  with some odd Chinese dragon puppets hanging among the otherwise Mexican colours and artwork.
Fonda San Miguel,316,Hands down one of the best places in Austin. The decor     The food  the service  everything was amazing   Make sure you make reservations.
Fonda San Miguel,317,A delightful evening on North Loop.  I ve lived in this neighborhood for  5 years and never really went west on North Loop past Burnet.  The exterior of this place is gorgeous.  It reminds me of restaurants in different resorts that I ve visited in Mexico.  Lush plants  vibrant colors  and twinkle lights.  They have free valet service  and plenty of parking.   We were unable to get a reservation online for 4  too short of notice   so we waited  45 minutes for a table on a Friday night.  Walking in to FSM nearly took my breath away.  The interior is beautiful  lights and candles  high ceilings with chandeliers  and art on every wall.  I loved the entry  plenty of places to hang out while waiting for your table.  We snagged a couch and coffee table  and were served chips and salsa and margaritas within 5 minutes.   We were seated in one of many large dining rooms  and greeted by our friendly and knowledgeable server. I had the Calabacitas Rellenas  or stuffed zucchini.  It was fresh and light  smothered with a delectable cheese sauce.  I enjoyed this greatly because I tend to overeat at TexMex spots  usually feeling stuffed and sick.  Husband ordered the special  the name is slipping my mind   which was fall-off-the bone lamb served in parchment paper.  He enjoyed it  even if it wasn t the  best he s had .  Not traditional tex mex served here  no refried beans.  Food is a little pricey and good-but-not-amazing  but the experience of this restaurant is what I would return for...
Fonda San Miguel,318,While in Austin visiting friends we went for dinner and it was unbelievable. Service was exceptional and the food was terrific. If you re in Austin you should make this a stop.
Fonda San Miguel,319,So very good.  My word   From the food to the service to the beautiful artwork to the decor to the gorgeous plants and flowers  everything about our experience was superb.  We decided to order a variety of appetizers and entrees to share so that we could try as many items as possible.  Everything - and I mean everything down to the tortillas - was delicious  making it extremely hard to point to a favorite.  Our server was crisp  knowledgeable  and extremely attentive  making this a 5 star experience all around.  If you love Mexican food this has to be on your bucket list   And if Mexican food is not your favorite  it s hard to imagine not finding something you d enjoy here - it s that good.
Fonda San Miguel,320,Austin must do ... came with a huge expectations n great reviews from my friends but I guess coming from SAN Diego  city with best Mexican food     I found this place very average and expensive for the food they serve. Lot of variety to try   I guess almost 40.. but none of dish was exciting enough to be taken again . Tamales   salsa   Pork   beef   chicken   fish   guacamole   chips  bread pudding etc etc ... everything tasted average and tacos were soggy . I don t think I will return to this place just for the beautiful ambience  when Austin is full of amazing food trucks . Definitely not  40   worth Buffett .
Fonda San Miguel,321,Awesome food and service. Good ambience. Mexiote and tres le Ches our favs. Mexiote was awesomely braised and falling of the bone. Reminded me of the gordon ramsay lamb shanks.
Fonda San Miguel,322,Tasty Tex-Mex restaurant to cap off my last night in Austin.   Restaurant - cute  authentic decor. Very roomy inside. Lighting a bit on the dark side.   Food- they start you off with chips and salsa. Very addicting. My friend and I ordered calamari appetizer  I had the spicy shrimp with rice for my entree and she had one of their specials which was crab enchiladas. Everything was tasty. Price was a bit on the high end.   I d recommend coming here for special occasions if this is the type of food you are craving.
Fonda San Miguel,323,We came here for the famous Sunday brunch while visiting Austin for a weekend. We did not have reservations but they have open seating in the indoor patio that is available on a first-come first serve basis. The buffet is plentiful with lots of options for all types of tastes and spice level. You can begin with huevos rancheros  enchiladas  salads  guacamole and other vegetarian dishes. The day we went they had several seafood options including crispy fish for tacos and ceviche. The main meat section contained several options. The first was a chicken green mole  the second was a cochinita pinup and the third was a carne guisada. Finally the dessert station was plentiful and takes up 1 4 of the entire buffet. At your table they bring you fresh tortillas. Stand out dishes to me were the guacamole  the red cheese enchiladas  the cochinita pibil and the corn casserole. The price for  40 per person was very reasonable. Definitely a must stop when in Austin.
Fonda San Miguel,324,The place is beautifully decorated  but the food fails completely to what the flavors from the Mexican Cuisine is. Poor  poor flavors GALORE   Even the margaritas are a mix of pure lemon and very little taste it s just so sour and for a margarita to be served in a wine glass that was pretty crazy to see  maybe so that they can charge a lot. Sorry  but I can never recommend it.  I felt sad to see the restaurant full of people who might believe they are being served excellent food.  Servers were very nice.
Fonda San Miguel,325,Went on a Sunday morning for the buffet. I am Mexican and I dislike mexican restaurants but this one is amazing. Beautiful experience of food. So much amazing desserts to choose from. 5 stars
Fonda San Miguel,326,Too many things that weren t great about this place. Definitely not a place I would ever go for a special occasion. It was just  okay  Drinks were good. Dessert for my birthday was not edible. When making the reservation  they asked if I had a special request and I said yes  it s my birthday please make it special  We were seated in the worst area next to a huge party and a table of wild kids  When I asked if we could be seated else where the manager said there was no where else to sit. Tables opened up but he never came back to check on us. Waiter had zero personality and we had to ask about the menu. Not sure why this place gets such rave reviews  but like I said it was just okay.
Fonda San Miguel,327,Every time I come to Fonda San Miguel for brunch  I can t wait to come back again  I love the rice  and the pork is so tender it practically melts in your mouth. My favorite server and bartender is Omar  he really knows what he s doing. Thanks for such good service 
Fonda San Miguel,328,Love everything about this restaurant - the ambiance  the food  and the service. I believe this place has been around since the 70 s -- true traditional entrees. I believe I finished the Chile Con Queso all on my own. The Queso Asados with Poblano strips and Chorizo Verde were the best I ve had in many  many years. A friend ordered the Ancho Relleno San Miguel -- with light Cilantro cream sauce. I m all about the Cilantro. Tres Leches Cake looked delicious but was too full to even try a bite. I ll be shure to order and have next time. This will be one of my go to restaurants every time I m in Austin. Cheers    
Fonda San Miguel,329,I love the decoration of the building.  The food isn t worth the price or the wait.  If you come in without a reservation be prepared to wait for over a hour.  I found the food ok but not worth the hour and half wait.  Then they really wanted us out of the place once we were done with the food.  I used to love it here but haven t been here in awhile.  I doubt I will be back.  I surly will not be back without a reservation.  There are better places at a better price in town.  Used to be great now just ok at best.
Fonda San Miguel,330,Been here twice on special dates and both my experiences were INCREDIble. Their Brunch buffet variety was amazing and really enjoyed every dish i tasted  Oh and the dessert table was a delight. I m a vegetarian and the selection was wide enough for me to pick and choose.  Hubby doesnt consume egg  so he couldn t have most of the desserts - so that was a bit of a bummer. Quite pricey  so we won t frequent  but def at least once a year.  Make sure to get there early i.e at 11am  when the buffet starts as parking is limited. We reached at 11.30 and werr lucky to get the last spot in the lot 
Fonda San Miguel,331,Divine  authentic food from Mexico.  I lived in Mexico City and it is authentic and the flavors are amazing.  The quail and mole are fantastic.
Fonda San Miguel,332,I m a Mexican food junkie  and hands down this was the most incredible Mexican Food restaurant I have ever been to.  Even better than Mexican food restaurants I have been to IN Mexico.  From the outside  this place immediately makes a statement with its lighting and incredible architecture.  We were able to walk right in a for a party of two on a Thursday night and be seated immediately. When you walk in  there is a beautiful atrium garden area with a cute parrot named Paco  seriously his name  to give it even more of an authentic feel.  There are some tables in the center with separated lounge areas  designed for parties waiting for their tables or those who have grabbed a drink.  There is a bar area in the back for a more casual  albeit still classy  setting.  The specialty cocktails are reasonably priced and delicious  Considering the food prices are slightly higher here  I was happy to see the cocktails weren t priced  15-20.    I ordered the Chicken Asado that came with a side of rice and beans.  I could eat that for the rest of my life - it was so incredible. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the veggies were perfect and everything about everything was perfect.  I want to go back - like right now.
Fonda San Miguel,333,Excellence    Great and truly authentic Mexican food  So if you want to get the real thing come to Fonda San Miguel  You won t be disappointed l and ask for Redcorn  he is the best  
Fonda San Miguel,334,Sooooo disappointing. Super foodie here and first time visitor to Austin. Upon looking for places to eat brunch in Austin this came highly recommended and were on many must try lists. After reading reviews and see pictures I thought it was worth a shot to check out. Wow it was so disappointing  and for how much they charge it was by far the most expensive and most dissatisfying meal this far in Austin. The buffet was tiny  crowded and underwhelming. The food was average at best  and many items were honestly very unappetizing. The wait staff serving brunch were very nice  the waiter was a little pushy  and the hostess a little rude. For the price of our bill at over  40 per person we could have had amazing food at Uchiko instead. What a total bummer.
Fonda San Miguel,335,I went to brunch at this restaurant more than 10 years ago.  Best brunch ever.  Finally got a chance to go back and was incredibly disappointed.  Service was absolutely terrible and the food was passable.  Ceviche was great as were the desserts.  No typical brunch items like pancakes and waffles.  Overall it was just an average brunch at exorbitant prices.  Skip this place and go to Moonshine for brunch.
Fonda San Miguel,336,This is the place foodie dreams are made of   I ve been a long-time fan of Fonda San Miguel.  The food is sublime and no other Mexican restaurant in town comes close to matching the quality of what is served here.  The restaurant has a rich culinary history and the result is a menu of creative offerings with influences from interior Mexico.  Add to that a divine interior that makes you feel as though you ve stepped into a hacienda the moment you walk through the door.  The only reason I can t give 5 stars is due to the service - it can be spotty - sometimes good  sometimes awful but with the right server  you are in for an incredible experience 
Fonda San Miguel,337,Fonda San Miguel is one of our favorite Mexican  restaurants. We love the decor  service is always good but can be contingent on how busy they are  and their margaritas are the best. I did hav a recent poor experience with a  22 ancho chilli relleno that was so horribly over seasoned I couldn t eat it. I was forced to hav a frozen margarita or two to help calm the burn but to also make the experience AOK. Fortunately my fianc  can handle more spice than me so it made a good lunch for her the next day... We ll return again soon but will avoid the chili rellenos.
Fonda San Miguel,338,Fonda San Miguel was my very first restaurant experience in Austin  the tab for the two of us was  340  and I recall thinking   Austin seems a bit pricey.  After some inquiries  we discovered the bill belonged to another table. I hadn t been back there since.    Flash forward some thirty-six years or so  and I m now in the Fonda San Miguel bar with the delightful Ashley S  who is simply stunning in a tiny black dress. She s slowly sipping a silky martini of Patr n. I recall thinking   I should probably come here more often.  What s a decade or two among friends   This restaurant is still an Austin icon  it s still the coolest Hacienda in town  and on a Saturday night at 6 45  the dining room was already jam-packed  amp  backed-up. And now for today s Captain Obvious tip  If you don t have resos and need to be somewhere else at 8 00  have the bar set you up for dinner. It s really a restaurant within a restaurant  with your choice of a dozen two-tops or dining at the bar itself. We did a two-top  and our server Patricia was on top of her game  knowing every vegetarian  amp  booze option backwards  amp  forwards.  Since I know nothing about authentic Mexican cuisine  Ashley picked the two entr es we shared  I thought the Callabacitas Rellenas was exactly like a light and flavorful lasagna  and what made the Enchiladas Suizas memorable for me was the nearly perfect Verde sauce that accompanied them. Excellent choices. It made me curious about the weekday Happy Hour and the much-heralded Sunday brunch. And now for today s random thought  I didn t hear or smell anything sizzling in cast iron the entire time we were there  although I m not sure why I was expecting to. I should probably broaden my horizons slightly.  For the sake of closure  the tab for the two of us this evening was exactly  43 - two entr es  one martini  and one iced tea. That was a little different from my first visit here  and granted we didn t do additional drinks and apps and all the desserts. I m saving that for the next journey. I m pretty sure it will be within this decade.
Fonda San Miguel,339,Absolute favorite for authentic Mexican food. My wife is from Mexico City and she loves the food and says it is very close to what they have there. The pastor tacos are a must get  best you can find in Austin for sure. The corn soup is also so delicious  and the tampiquena meat is very delicious  along with the enchiladas suisas. The building is also nicely decorated  and there is usually always parking  which is good for an almost downtown restaurant 
Fonda San Miguel,340,Sooooo good    Their happy hour is awesome and the food is delicious   The tacos  ceviche  queso is yummy to my tummy lol great for groups or dates  Great atmosphere 
Fonda San Miguel,341,I ve always had a good experience here. They are usually quite busy  but they are always very friendly  great atmosphere  an area to get drinks while you wait  and the food is exceptional.
Fonda San Miguel,342,We chose Fonda San Miguel for dinner to celebrate our anniversary. It was an excellent decision. We had a fantastic experience.  The restaurant has a very colonial Mexican decor  with very traditional furniture  authentic Mexican art and dim lighting which gave the place a special mood.  The hostess was very friendly  our table was ready in time as you expect with a reservation. Our server was courteous  funny  helpful and made the night even more enjoyable.  We started with a Tortilla Soup  which was probably the best we have tasted in the U.S. As it should be  the sliced tortillas  shredded cheese and chile came in a separate plate  to be added right before you eat the soup. The taste was very authentic and very good.  We each had a Huarache  which was nicely done but was neither prepared in a traditional  antojeria  style  you need to go to Chuy s bakery for that  not was it especially tasty  but it was OK. Both the red and green salsas were extraordinary. Not too hot but still spicy enough and flavorful.  I had the duck enchiladas  which were quite good  a unique dish with complex flavors prepared wit traditional Mexican ingredients. My wife had the Chile Relleno with picadillo which was as good as it gets.  On top of this  Fonda San Miguel offer handmade tortillas  which we had to try with the side dish of refried beans and rice. The white rice  by the way  was excellent.   All this delicious food was enjoyed alongside Don Julio Aniejo tequila  which was perfect. Fonda offers quite a variety of tequilas  wines and other drinks.   At this point we were so full we had no room for dessert. We will have to come back to try more delicious items in the menu and for sure the Crepas con Cajeta.  In summary - this is not only an authentic Mexican restaurant  it is an authentic Mexican dining experience. Very different from the more home-made  antojeria  style Mexican you find in paces like Chuy s on Guajillos  this is a place to taste the more sophisticated flavors of Mexican Cuisine. a must for anyone who enjoys Mexican food.
Fonda San Miguel,343,This place is pricey  but worth every penny. When you walk in the door  it s as though you re transported to another world with a big skylight over a courtyard-like waiting area with a big central table. The actual dining room surrounds a central table decorated with art and has a very high ceiling with tables that are sparse enough that you can easily feel like you are the only person there.  But  atmosphere aside the food is where this place shines. The mole is incredible. It s as good as I ve had anywhere with deep pepper and chocolate flavors  but without being sweet. The chiles rellenos are just as good with deliciously creamy mixes of veggies and meat inside a perfectly roasted pepper. The chicken is my favorite.  Come here for a nice date  a special occasion or just as a splurge and you will not be disappointed. I promise.
Fonda San Miguel,344,Very good interior Mexican. Stout drinks  good brunch  good happy hour. Parking is a bit tight  but one can always get a spot on the street. The mole is first-rate.  The decor is amazing. I love the paintings and the art objects that adorn the restaurant. This restaurant has been around forever. Obviously  they are doing something right.
Fonda San Miguel,345,Just had to comment on my brunch buffet experience here.  If the brunch had been cheaper  then I might have moved this review up to five stars.  The brunch buffet included a huge variety of items.  The food was good  but at  40 I would be expecting slightly better.  The Guac wasn t fresh  so not as good as normal.  The dessert buffet is huge  but nothing inspirational.  The drinks are an additional cost  so by the time you are out of here you are at least  50 .  You have to reserve in advance as the brunch is very popular and the place is definitely packed.
Fonda San Miguel,346,Best Mexican food. Would fly to Austin to just have a meal here. Maitre d could be more polite and accommodating when the waits are long and accommodate to help find a waiting area. Amazing vegetarian options. Very unique and authentic food.
Fonda San Miguel,347,This place is way to overrated and high priced for the portion served. When we ordered  the bar tender never smiled or greeted us. The other one spent to much time trying to make EVERYTHING right for pretty girls next to us. When I asked the bar tender to fix my extremely  sweet margarita he just added lime juice  while making a new drink for our neighbors  Jerk..will never go there again  thanks
Fonda San Miguel,348,Birthday Group Reservation for 20. Group gets there and they have two tables set up for 16. After pulling tables together and another hour later we were able to finally sit the entire group down.  Reservation was set weeks in advance.  We asked for menus and drink menus and were told they were running low on menus this evening.  Had to go to bar to get drinks.  Food was ok  and as one review states  you could get better off Rundburg for  5   The waiters were trying but they were unable to handle a large table with only one server. Food is ok but not for the price.   Disappointed and feel bad for our friend who was celebrating her birthday.
Fonda San Miguel,349,I have been going to Fonda San Miguel since 1994 when I was in college. I am from Mexico City and whenever I felt homesick for Mexican food and Mexican flair  I went to Fonda San Miguel and delighted in their scrumptious brunch. Later  my husband and I made it a tradition to celebrate our anniversaries with dinner at FSM. Fonda San Miguel is and has been the most beautiful restaurant in Austin and its food is always mouthwatering. We are crazy about  queso fundido    tacos al pastor   duck enchiladas and the super yummy  crepas de cajeta . Can t wait to go back 
Fonda San Miguel,350,What a lovely treat this place is. i have been coming here for years and this is definitely once of my favorite spots in austin texas. Thank you Fonda for being consistently impeccable  Treat yourself and family and eat here 
Fonda San Miguel,351,As you can see the restaurant has a nice scene outside... When you walk inside you get a good sense of a  Hispanic culture and for me it seems like it s home because I grew up around all ethnic groups .. I would strongly suggest this  restaurant
Fonda San Miguel,352,I would to preface this review with the fact that we love this place and always have an outstanding experience.  After years of  thinking about  it  we finally made a reservation for brunch. It happened to be for Easter.  There is not doubt that the food was plentiful. However  this was not what we had expected for  42.95 with a selection that left something to be desired. The food was mediocre compared to the outstanding quality one experiences with dinner dining.  The lamb chops were very good and the quail was wonderful. Other than that  not worth the expenditure.  I will say we never order dessert at dinner so this may not be worth mentioning  but the desserts were unappealing and some were flavorless.  Save your money for the dinner dining experience.
Fonda San Miguel,353,Let me start with the food was ok. Our waiter was great. He was polite and fast service. Here s the one star  There was a huge roach on the wall  I have pictures  amp  witnesses . We told the waiter  the waiter told the manager. The manager came to the table to tell us he s never seen a roach in the restaurant. Then the bugs appeared again. The waiter took one roach. The owner of the restaurant came over to talk to us. He cut our table off of drinks when no one was drunk. He then said they can t control the roaches and said there are roaches everywhere. Preceded to insult where we were from. He went back to the bar to continue drinking  he was drunk  amp  slurring. We paid our bill  amp  left. Awful experience.
Fonda San Miguel,354,One of my favorite restaurants of all time. Truly an Austin gem - great ambiance  The brunch is pricy but fabulous and a true special occasion. The tres leches cake may be in my top two desserts anywhere in the world - perfect levels of moisture and flavor 
Fonda San Miguel,355,I ve been coming back to Fonda San Miguel for  oh my  over 30 years now.  Has always been a beautiful timeless place for upscale interior mexican.   It s fun to sit at the bar for a casual dinner of shared small plates.  I particularly like the Nuevo Estilo cocktail  which is a nice twist on an old fashioned.  They ve always done an excellent margarita  I would say one of the best in town.  Of the small plates  go for the calamari  cordero  small lamb chops   or the oysters  which I hope never leave the specials menu  and would never leave without ordering.    Excellent lighter dinners are the camerones tikin zik or calabacitas rellenas.  Tikin ZIk is shrimp in a red chile sauce with white rice and black beans side.  They do it pescado  fish  as well  but it seems to be always drum  which it not a favorite of mine.  Calabacitas is a nice light zucchini based dish.    Bigger appetites go for cochinita pibil.  Yum.  So full.    Ancho Relleno San Miguel is an interesting take on rellenos   Without the sweetness of standard rellenos  more savoury  with a light cream sauce that goes amazingly well with it.  Very tasty  a surprisingly big amount of food.
Fonda San Miguel,356,I got the calabacitas rellenas and my partner got the cochinita pibil. We both liked our entrees  my partner perhaps more so  though I was the one who scraped my plate clean. The refried black beans that accompanied were great  however  there were extremely hard crunchy bits in my rice that I had to pull out of my mouth. I assume they were bits of overcooked rice. The tortillas served with our food were not warm at all  and pretty mediocre in texture taste. Sauces and salsas for everything were fantastic. Cheeses used were also very good. Waiter was very polite and helpful  but it was difficult to hear him over the music  which was too loud. It took a while for our check to come out  so 3 different employees asked us if wanted to order dessert. Overall it was a nice experience  but due to the high prices of the entrees  I won t be in any rush to go back.
Fonda San Miguel,357,We went here with a large party the other night  including people with allergies and dietary restrictions  and everyone left happy and full   The only complaint at the table  and it wasn t a serious one  was that there were no burritos on the menu     I had an amazing shrimp dish that was fresh and tasty followed by the Tres Leches cake  So amazing.  Our server was friendly and attentive the entire time and I didn t see one crumb left on anyone s plate ... in fact ... one friend lifted her dish to her mouth to slurp up the last of her dessert.
Fonda San Miguel,358,We have been to this restaurant 3 times now. The first time was actually our most disappointing experience. We had the steak platter  which was probably the most expensive steak platter we have had at a Mexican restaurant  as well as Margaritas. The Margaritas were very delicious and couldn t complain there. The steak platter  in our opinion was not worth the cost  overcooked and again extremely expensive . Good  but not great. The second time we came  we had friends in town and thought we could try again. This time we ordered different meals  a shrimp platter and cochinitas pibil  and of course the margaritas. This time our food was much better and the experience definitely went up  however  the restaurant is still very expensive for the quality in our opinion. The service is really good and the food is as well  but unfortunately it is a little bit of a hit and miss on the quality of your food  not drinks 
Fonda San Miguel,359,I was visiting Austin with my brother when we happened to have stumbled across this restaurant after seeing some reviews on Yelp. Despite finding out a great Thai restaurant was closed  we were determined to find a place with reasonable reviews to cap our stay with.   The Service  1-Star Let me mention that the 3 star review is really all about the service... which is subpar.  That fact alone is truly unfortunate  because I tasted some of the best fajitas here. The Fonda San Miguel has a nice sit down atmosphere  and seems much classier than your run-of-the-mill Tex-Mex restaurant. However  you re more likely to find better service at another Tex-Mex restaurant than you are here. If you re hungry and don t care about service  which at that time we were pretty desperate  then this is your place.  The Food  5-Stars The food is really great and it should be mentioned that we were pleasantly surprised with all the dishes we ordered. The Chile Con Queso was a great consistency of melted cheese and peppers paired wonderfully with the hand made tortillas. It was the Carne Asada A La Tampiquena that truly blew us away. The tenderness of the meat and flavor of the beef tenderloin is definitely worth trying and not your run of the mill fajitas. We also ordered the Pollo Asado which they are certain to bring up as   Often misnamed as Chicken Fajitas.  The price is reasonable to swallow for the quality of food you receive. I was hoping to write a better review  but did I mention the service was subpar 
Fonda San Miguel,360,I have been going to Fonda since they opened. Fine dining at its best. A great atmosphere and an amazing brunch. A great place to take friend visiting Austin
Fonda San Miguel,361,Went for an anniversary dinner. We were sat a table and nobody came to bring us water or even take a drink order for over 12- 15 minutes. Chips and salsa were dropped off- but hard to eat without water. Nobody greeted us. Waitress finally came and was very unfriendly. May have been the worst service I ve had ever. Love the food at Fonda- but I ll never eat dinner there again. Will stick to happy hour. Spent about  150 for two people- had much higher expectations.
Fonda San Miguel,362,Olga  our waitress rocks   She gave my wife and I excellent recommendations for our Valentine s Day dinner. Tres Leches cake for dessert tops it all off. Can t wait to come soon 
Fonda San Miguel,363,After reading the Yelp reviews we were disappointed in the quality of the dinner. The QUESOS FUNDIDO was over cooked and cold. Needed a knife to cut the cheese and the chorizo was not to be found. 5 tortillas to share for 4 of us   We wanted more tortillas but the waiter took so long getting back to us the dish was colder. We HAD to ask about nightly specials. He said  we have a grilled pork chop and chicken . That was it   What   How was it prepared   I guess it wasn t a  special  last night. The RELLENO DE PICADILLO was soggy and warm. It was under a heat lamp to keep the mass produced dish  made earlier in the afternoon to keep warm for dinner. The waiter said   the make many  already cooked  in the afternoon for dinner.  He never check with us about the dinner. We sent the plate back and ordered another dish after asking ANOTHER waiter.  He said the smaller family owned restaurants cook the dish on demand and ordered. Okay  we will go go to another restaurant. The enchiladas were nothing to recommend for  19. We have eaten better quality at other restaurants. A 3 star for the bar  service and staff.  Instead of spending  90  for 2 dinner and drinks for the ambience and being seen.  - go to you fav restaurant. I don t except a response from management. I would not recommend.
Fonda San Miguel,364,Overall  my experience at Fonda San Miguel was just okay. The food was fine  drinks were fine  the ambience was probably the best part of the experience. Probably won t go back.
Fonda San Miguel,365,I got engaged in the bar and we had our rehearsal dinner at Fonda....yes that s how much my husband and I love this restaurant   This is a unique and beautiful restaurant with perfect staff  excellent service  and consistently delicious food.  I mean there is no other restaurant in town that I can go to and consistently  have the same and wonderful service and meal.  I actually can t believe I have never written a review   We just attended the 40th Anniversary party in October-yes I said 40th   In a town where everything has become a chain or another fancy restaurant with pretty people but doesn t deliver this is our  and should be your go-to restaurant.  One of the owner s  Tom  is in the bar nearly every night at 7 30 making sure everyone is having a good time and that everything is perfect in his and Miguel s restaurant.  Miguel  the chef and other owner  flies in from London several times a year to make sure the menu is fresh and up to standards-it is   This is not Tex-Mex but rather more  true  Mexican cuisine.  We often just sit at the bar and eat our way through the appetizers although dinner in the main room is a great place to dine as well... and Sunday brunch is a true treat   Some of our favorites our Chili Con Queso  Queso Asada  with everything   Ceviche with Lobster Mango  Tacos Al Pastor  Angel s on Horseback  Tortilla Soup  any of the Relleno s  the Cochinita Pibil  pork ...but honestly everything is good and we have had everything on the menu more than one time.  They often have an ice cream that is carmalized and made with goats milk that is to die for   Okay I just made myself incredibly hungry   If you haven t tried this place you are missing out.  Also  they have a great happy hour and every Tuesday it is happy hour all evening on many items.  Thank you Fonda for making dinner and memories wonderful for my entire family 
Fonda San Miguel,366,The only reason that I m not giving a one star review is because this place is honestly amazing. However  we were at dinner at FSM to grab drinks and a quick dinner decently late and we were treated rather poorly by our waiter. I have come to expect only the best from FSM  especially in regards to service  and we were treated the way I would expect from an Applebee s. The ladies in our party were basically insulted--maybe it was because we arrived there a little over an hour before they closed  but that s no way to treat anyone...especially when we truly lovED this place so much. Pro-tip  Enjoy the chips and salsa  but be sure to expect lesser service if you arrive after 8 30 on a weekday.
Fonda San Miguel,367,Fonda San Miguel is a beautifully unique restaurant   I love their decor in what feels like a never ending space.  I dined here for dinner with a very large party of people and the staff was SO on it.  They took orders promptly and our drinks and food were all served in an impressively short amount of time.  I ordered a white fish dish which came with a side of steamed veggies.  The fish was a little dry for my taste but still good.  Mojito was excellent 
Fonda San Miguel,368,I used to love this place. The pollo pibil was my favorite dish. The last couple times we have eaten there it has been pretty mediocre  especially for the price . Still  The decorations and building are beautiful. So  the ambiance made me want to return. However  after eating there tonight I won t be returning. The food is too mediocre to warrant the expense. The customer service was sub par. We had to ask for tortillas  which never came . We constantly had to ask for our waiter s attention to be served. All in all  it wasn t worth the money that we paid to eat there. There are other places in Austin that are worth the expense.
Fonda San Miguel,369,Wow incredible food  I had a very popular shrimp dish and it was incredible. The service was perfect and I love the ambience.
Fonda San Miguel,370,This place doesn t really need it anymore good reviews  but I will add one anyway. It was pretty awesome  the wait staff is really friendly  the interior decoration is astounding  and walking up to the front of the building at night is really pretty amazing. Highly recommended 
Fonda San Miguel,371,Went again this weekend and this place is still great.  Great service and excellent food.  I don t really like their signature margaritas but everything else was great including the watermelon margaritas.
Fonda San Miguel,372,Came here on Sunday for their brunch. First of all  I absolutely love the decor of the place. There s so much Hispanic style and artwork. The furniture is unique but also goes well with the whole theme. As for the buffet  it s not a huge selection but everything I tried besides was the desserts were delicious. They have really yummy unlimited guac which is a huge plus for me. They also have mole   ceviche  enchiladas  home made flour and corn tortillas. Service was good as well but I have to deduct a star because the desserts and pastries were okay. They have about 15 different sweets and baked goods. The creme br l e was delicious but everything else I had was too sweet or just not the right texture and I tried almost every dessert. It s about  40 for the buffet so come hungry. Overall  I would maybe return given the price.
Fonda San Miguel,373,Get the melted cheese appetizer  because there is nothing like it.  Lobster ceviche was also very fresh. I am only giving them 3 star  because my shrimp entree  their special of the night  was not all that.  It was too salty and the shrimps tasted like their have been frozen for a long while.  The tres leches cake was not soaked thoroughly with cream  which is what I am used to from New York Queens Latino neighborhoods  which I believe has the most amazing tres leches that costs only  2 .
Fonda San Miguel,374,While parking might be limited  your dining experience will not. I think this restaurant has been around for 40 years and has always been a high-quality  moderately-priced restaurant. My recommendation on dishes is to try something that sounds good. If you don t understand the description  ask your waiter for more information.  This is not the  burn your taste buds out  food you find in most Tex-Mex places  but a restaurant that uses the chili as a way to add flavor  just as you would other peppers.  iEs muy sabrosa    It s very flavorful   Everything is not spicy and most things that use chilis are only mildly spicy. The bar and waiting areas are nice places to sit with friends to have drinks and appetizers.  The brunch is amazing  though expensive. It s a buffet of traditional Mexican and American breakfast items  as well as traditional Mexican entrees and desserts.
Fonda San Miguel,375,Interesting place. I m not that familiar with Austin so during the drive I wondered if we were going to the right place. It s in a random spot but it s a diamond in the rough kind of spot. It was packed and we were early so we sat down at the bar area  took us about 15 minutes to get a seat . I ordered a margarita  good but not great   guacamole and queso  wife said it was amazing . Once we made it to the table the service was extremely quick. I think they got us to desert within 30 minutes. The ceviche was solid  but not amazing. I ordered the steak  and it was excellent. It came with a chicken enchilada in mole sauce which was phenomenal. The black beans were perfect and creamy. My wife s dessert  crepes  wasn t that great however  she probably should ve went with the Tres Leches. Overall  it s good food  solid service  a bit pricey for what you get imo however
Fonda San Miguel,376,I went here with my parents based on yelp pics alone. The place was slammed so I took it as a good sign but you never know with austinites. Was initially told it would be an hr wait but a cool old couple waved us over and gave us their table as they were leaving. I got the mole enchiladas and was not disappointed. Parents shared the suiza enchiladas. I liked them both but I do have to say that  19 for 2 enchiladas with black beans and rice seems a little ridiculous but on par with Austin sensibilities...
Fonda San Miguel,377,Just a quick review to say we were very happy with this place. We had cocktails  ceviche  the mole enchiladas and the ancho rellenos. All were excellent and especially the rellenos. Service and ambiance was excellent. Keep up the great work.
Fonda San Miguel,378,My husband s family has been going here for years. I have been a few times  and we even held our Wedding Rehearsal dinner here  11 people . This has become one of our personal favorite restaurants  but more on the expensive side. This is not a  Tex-Mex  place at all. This is definitely more authentic.  We had picked out appetizers prior to the night  so when we arrived we ordered them  so everyone could munch while talking and looking over the menu. We had Angels of Horseback  Ceviche las brisas and Sopecitos. Everyone loved the appetizers  especially the Ceviche which is my husbands personal favorite.   About half of the party got Enchiladas Suizas  which was the first time I ordered it as well and found it delicious. A few others got Pibil  my husband got Cochinita Pibil which he was nice enough to share with me. It was tender very tasty.  Everyone left very happy. My mom isn t a fan of Tex-Mex but thoroughly enjoyed this style of Mexican food.
Fonda San Miguel,379,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL restaurant with great food  and we were seated right away without a reservation  Our server was also quick and attentive  And the Crepas De Cajeta dessert was SO DELICIOUS   My husband and I have Fonda San Miguel to thank for such a wonderful dinner experience  We ll definitely be coming back 
Fonda San Miguel,380,A cousin was in town from NYC and we took her to Fonda San Miguel for dinner last night because we wanted something  Austin iconic  and had a good experience there a couple years back.   It was packed with a 45 minute wait  so we opted to sit at the bar since they had a full dining menu. We ordered the cheese enchiladas with verde sauce and the tampiquena meat  and the cousin got the chili relleno. Everything was tasty  very good  although certainly not amazing   but the food came out suspiciously fast.   This place would normally get 4 stars from us  but we need to take off 2 more stars  when the waiter recommended the tampiquena meat  he suggested we get some  air  land  sea  version or whatnot with shrimp and duck  etc. It sounded good  so why not  We figured it would cost more  but when the bill arrived  SIXTY THREE DOLLARS. For one dish  In Austin  At a Mexican restaurant  Each shrimp was almost  5 extra. We don t mind paying a premium  but if you re going to upsell an item for that much f ing money  then you need to TELL THE CUSTOMER IN ADVANCE. Our server was very nice  but that was completely unprofessional and we definitely feel like we got suckered  we almost took it out of the tip  but still left 20   when we think about it now  we wish we wouldn t have tipped. Live and learn. That definitely left a bad taste in our mouths at the end of the night  so we probably won t be back. Anyway--be on guard about your server s  recommendations .
Fonda San Miguel,381,I do not give out too many 5 stars ratings especially for Mexican food. This is truly a high end version of this cuisine.The restaurant is beautiful and so tastefully decorated. The front doors are from somewhere in Mexico and were several hundred years old. How cool is that  The music was a very soft type of soothing and mellow and not the loud rowdy stuff you hear in most other restaurants of this type. The service was excellent.   We started with the chilli con queso. This I a very unique version of this dish. It is not a dip. It has a couple of differnt cheeses mixed with green chili and with onion  tomato and cilantro on the top. It comes with whole warm tortillas so you eat it like a taco. It was excellent. For dinner my wife had the enchiladas with mole sauce. She was hoping for the traditional red enchiladas sauce but they do not offer that. She had one shredded chicken and one pork enchilada. To her surprise it was very very good. Neither of us care for mole sauce but this one was very good. I guess to this point I had never had a real one. I had the duck enchiladas with a creamy verde sauce on it. This was off the hook good. The rest of the menu has all upscale items with different meats  seafoods  apps and salads. The prices here are higher than most any Mexican restaurant and the portions are not huge but decent and the quality is top notch. I will definitely come back the next time I am in town.
Fonda San Miguel,382,This place is great  The chili con queso is cheesy heaven and the duck enchiladas are soooo good. Order extra handmade tortillas for the table.
Fonda San Miguel,383,Beyond exquisite   Fonda San Miguel truly represents Mexican food at its best   100  recommended by me  Mexican guy   Brunch buffet not only made my Sunday better but it also gain my heart as the best Mexican restaurant I ve ever been here in Austin  Tx 
Fonda San Miguel,384,After doing a lot of research on where to eat for my birthday dinner  I finally decided to eat here after hearing such good things. The dining room was full when we arrived and reservations were booked for the night so we walked in and seated ourselves close to the bar  there s open seating on a first come first serve basis near the dining room . The server was extremely warm and welcoming to us as we asked for menu suggestions. For our appetizers  we ordered the ceviche and the chile con queso  both of which were fantastic. The ceviche was perfect  not too sour and very light  with the high quality fish coming through with the flavor. The chile con queso was gone within the minute. Served with warm tortillas  it felt more authentic  and the cheese was gooey  melty  and fresh  not the typical tex mex queso. For our entrees I ordered the special for the day  the pork belly  and my girlfriend ordered the camarones de mojo ajo  if i remember correctly . The pork belly was tender and juicy  with the beautifully crispy crackling skin on the exterior. Her garlic shrimp was phenomenal as well. My family ordered other seafood dishes whose names escape my memory  but they all loved them. For dessert we ordered the flan and the guava mango sorbet and they were a refreshing  tasty end to the meal. Overall the experience  from the food to the service was A1. I will be coming back 
Fonda San Miguel,385,Came for Tuesday all day happy hour and tried to sit at a table in the bar  the only place happy hour is available  was told by a manager that we could not sit there because it was reserved. Side note you can t make a reservation for happy hour. Turns out the table was for the owner. Well bravo by being a pretentious asshole you have effectively turned away paying customers. You should think about sitting in any other part of your restaurant since you do own the place.  Really disappointed usually love this place but this was just too much.  I d recommend going to La Mancha down the street for happy hour great drinks and food for a lot cheaper and no pretentious assholes.
Fonda San Miguel,386,I cannot say enough good about Fonda San Miguel  Although we had a bit of  a wait  we were able to enjoy their delicious margaritas and chips and salsa while we waited. I highly recommend the cucumber margarita - but the house is a safe and delicious bet too    The ceviche - half and half of each were incredible. Seriously - best ceviche I ve had in Austin  When I go back  I will not stray from this order.  In addition - the service was great and vibe was relaxed and fun. Next up  the highly talked about brunch. Don t pass Fonda up 
Fonda San Miguel,387,Good but overpriced. Neat building  strong history. A classic interior-Mexican dining experience. But at  40 per head  the price value relationship is a stretch.
Fonda San Miguel,388,Food and service was excellent.  The duck enchiladas were as good as everyone said.    The setting was very nice too.  It is very busy even on weekdays so get a reservation.  We ate in the bar area which was also nice.  The only issue is the limited parking. They do have valet but I didn t realize it until we reached the restaurant.
Fonda San Miguel,389,Was and is always so good   I ask my parents to take me for a birthday meal here instead of birthday presents - no joke. It s that good.   The staff is amazing  no really  amazing  the restaurant itself is beautiful  and anything wrapped in banana leaves is straight from heaven...  When I have guest in town or people asking where to go  it is my first recommendation.  If they can t afford it  I send them to Chuy s  though every penny spent at Fonda San Miguel is worth it.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Fonda San Miguel,390,Since the 80 s Fonda has been An authentic Austin staple with delicious food from the interior of Mexico  it is just not the margaritas but the joy and camaraderie that is built at the table over ceviche and Fondido  Don t miss the cilantro cream sauce or Duck enchiladas  
Fonda San Miguel,401,Service was terrible at 6pm.  Restaurant wasn t that full  server didn t seem to care.  He would show up to checkup on you  which was awesome  but then vanish for a long time.  Dropped the bill but never returned to collect  I was close to leaving.  The food  hit and miss.  I had the lamb  Mixiote.  It was a bit dry  didn t impress my palette  can t recall what my wife had but recall that it was delicious.  The limeade was delicious  server said he would bring a refill but never did.  Son had the appetizer quesadilla which he nor I didn t like.   I might be returning to give it another shot.  Hope others will enjoy this place more than me.
Fonda San Miguel,402,I LOVE Fonda San Miguel.  Cant wait to check back. The environment is so app best and colorful and the portions are nice and large. Cocktails are phenomenal. Love the mariachi band too.
Fonda San Miguel,403,Our waiter made our meal. Figuratively folks  not literally. Well  and the presentation....the presentation made our meal. Well  and the food...the food made the meal. And the ambiance...and the two margaritas at the bar before we sat down.  Make the hike up to north Austin to Fonda San Miguel. Drop the group you are with at the front door and go park your car about a mile away because this place is so popular that there is a good chance you won t be any closer. Not the end of the world though  you ll walk through a nice neighborhood on your way back to the restaurant.  We had the ceviche las brisas and loved it. I had the relleno de picadillo and practically inhaled it. Another at our table had the Mixiote and thought it was one of the best Mexican dishes he d ever had.  For dessert  do NOT miss the Crepas de Cajeta. Have you been to Argentina and had dulce de leche  This might be better. I know....you are thinking  oh  you are a big fat liar ....but I m not. Try it....and THEN tell me if I m wrong.
Fonda San Miguel,404,Treated very rudely by three young girls at the hostess stand.  Tried to eat here tonight.  We arrived shortly before 5pm after a visitation at a funeral home.  When asked if we had a reservation  which we did not  we were told we could eat at the bar if there was room  but they would not seat us  remember this was BEFORE 5 pm with plenty of open tables. . So instead we went a block away to LaMancha where we were welcomed with open arms.  We had fabulous service and really great food   So Fonda San Miguel  you can shove it 
Fonda San Miguel,405,So  so good. Quality Mexican food  for a little change if you get tired of the Tex Mex  . Went for my birthday and the food  the drinks  the atmosphere  the service were all excellent. It is a good idea to make reservations  especially if you re more than 2. Great place for an anniversary or birthday 
Fonda San Miguel,406,This is the best brunch I ve ever had period. I d much rather pay premium price for better quality food and pay alcohol separately. They know how to make ceviche in the most authentic way possible. The dessert selection was incredible. Flan  tres leches  arroz con leche  all of the Latin staples present plus more. Incredible  
Fonda San Miguel,407,Sat at the bar for happy hour Tuesday. Half price apps and  5 margaritas  Yum yum yum. We had the ceviche and queso with chorizo and poblano peppers  The tortillas were fresh and delicious.  Our neighbor at the bar had a yummy looking dish so can t wait to come back for another shot at the app menu 
Fonda San Miguel,408,Went here for their happy hour on Tuesdays. I will say the drinks are good and well priced for HH  house margaritas and wine only . But the food...totally mediocre  I was super disappointed  as I was excited to find my new fav Mexican spot. I got the  42 carne asada dish and had very little flavor...at all. The steak was tinder  but it was so thin  how could it not be. Disappointed and underwhelmed overall. Also had the ceviche  it was okay for the happy hour price.
Fonda San Miguel,409,I have been going to Fonda for years and usually for their Sunday brunch. I haven t been in few years but I was so disappointed this last Sunday. We sat for 20 minutes before anyone came to wait on us. It took 30 minutes to get a drink delivered... But  the most disappointing was the food. Their chicken mole used to be so thick and amazing and their dishes were watery and lacking in flavor. They had  verde mole  that tasted nothing like mole... The biggest disappointment was the thing I was looking the most forward to... their bread pudding... It used to be perfect with this thick delicious caramel-like sauce... the sauce was seriously inedible... like it was spoiled... bitter... thin and watery... the bread pudding was beautiful but tasteless... the angel food cake was like rubber and was definitely not homemade... What happened Fonda     I am so bummed   
Fonda San Miguel,410,The duck enchiladas are just heavenly     If you go on Tues  it s half price certain appetizers all day... including the lamb chops  What you say.... yes it s true  they are tender and perfectly cooked everyone tome
Fonda San Miguel,411,I d really like to give this place 0 stars. Can t even review the food because never made it to that part of the experience. Was told by the hostess to seat ourselves anywhere in the opening seating section. Waited for 10 minutes  then asked the hostess if there was a server in the section we sat in  with which she responded  yes  they ll be right with you . Busboy came by to drop off water  and told us the same thing. Then saw 3 tables who came in after us sit down and be greeted right away. There was a server helping all these tables but didn t bother to acknowledge or greet us. It s Sunday brunch and early... How hard is it to hand us some plates and say hello  Obviously this place is so talked up they no longer believe they have to provide any level of customer service. Lesson learned...
Fonda San Miguel,412,What a gem   It s off the beaten path  but the experience of the wonderful  amp  authentic food is complete.   You can t go wrong here. I m a transplant from NYC-- amp  when some of my friends visit--instead of taking them to one of the many barbecue places--I want my out of town friends to experience this outstanding food  wonderful service  and great art and decor. It is truly a taste of Austin    And if you are lucky enough to live in Austin  run don t walk  to have this magical experience yourself 
Fonda San Miguel,413,This restaurant is an Austin classic and it s nice to have interior Mexican.  The place itself is absolutely gorgeous and it s a great place for a date.  However  the price and atmosphere set you up for a better food experience which in my opinion is just not there.  It s good  just not great.
Fonda San Miguel,414,This place is excellent  I ordered the enchiladas verdes  chicken  and they came out so delicious  The sauce wasn t too spicy and the chicken was so flavorful. They also provide chips and salsa free as an appetizer and the red salsa was super yummy...probably one of the best salsas I ve had in a long while  I also ordered the Plantation  alcoholic drink  which from what I remember contains grapefruit juice  vodka  fresh mint and some other juices. The drink was very refreshing and came in a cute glass  Overall the food was glorious  Customer service wasn t too bad either but could ve been better...our waiter was somewhat slow. This place definitely isn t the cheapest so expect to spend a little but it s definitely worth it  Will be coming back soon 
Fonda San Miguel,415,I have to say interior Mexican is highly under appreciated. Fonda San Miguel does it very well.   I had the Mezcal Mule 10  Wahaka Reposado Mezcal  King s Ginger liqueur  splash of lime juice and ginger beer.  I asked for it to be on the stronger side  it came out still to sweet for my taste. I also had the house marg which was perfect.   The calamari was delicious and had tentacles   my fave  not a lot of places serve that part of the calamari. Some people just can t hack it.  For my main I had  CAMARONES ADOBADOS  Adobe-crusted shrimp placed over corn tortillas filled with rajas and served with a chipotle-black bean sauce.   I was on the fence about this. I had some really tasty shrimps  and some shrimps that tasted..well for lack of better word too shrimpy. BUT I didn t get sick so I guess it was all safe play. The dish was beautifully plated and everything else served with it tasted great.  I did sneak a bite of the a friends veggie enchilada and it was amazing. Super flavorful   Also stole a bite of COCHINITA PIBIL Yucatan specialty of pork baked in banana leaf. This was succulent  tender  and well seasoned.  Yes  I steal bites. Get over it.  End with the Tres Leches cake  its a winner 
Fonda San Miguel,416,Food is delicious and they have ALL NIGHT HAPPY HOUR in the bar patio area on every Tuesday. There is definitely a good deal of delicious Mexican Food options in Austin  and a ton of taco trucks that are amazing   but when you are looking for a Mexican restaurant on a little more upscale side  go to Fonda  and go on a Tuesday for more bang for your buck  
Fonda San Miguel,417,When I travel to Austin for business Fonda San Miguel is a required stop.  Amazing food and great atmosphere.  They have San Miguel Pale Ale from the Philippines....brings back good memories.   Why is it so good   I m not Mexican  but this food seems much more authentic than the standard Mexican or Tex Mex place.  Everything is sauced nicely  I d say delicately  but that sounds too pretentious.    This is one of those  you have to try it  places if you live in and or are visiting Austin.
Fonda San Miguel,418,Amazing food  I had the enchiladas with half verde half suiza. So good  I wanted to eat every bite. My husband had the short rib special with mole sauce. Neither of us are big mole eaters but decided to try it based on the reviews. We both said it was the best mole  hands down. We didn t make a reservation and the wait was long but the bar seating is quite extensive and we snagged a seat no problem. We are happy we made it here 
Fonda San Miguel,419,Fonda San Miguel or as I call it  So Fonda  is great. It s the prettiest restaurant in Austin and the service and food are wonderful. We were there on Aug 16 and I had the pork chop with grilled veggies and potatoes and I loved it. Go for a treat or special night out or just because life is too short to eat bad food. The guacamole is wonderful too. Now if you are going to have a drink  pack your wallet but for a once-in-a-while  Fonda cannot be beat.
Fonda San Miguel,420,My wife and I decided to stop by for an early dinner since we were in the area and are planning on having a family brunch there later this year.  My wife had Chicken Enchiladas Mole and I had Grilled Shrimp.  My wife said the mole was okay but not the best.  My shrimp  Jumbo Gulf Shrimp  were absolutely delicious.   We had Flan and Tres Leche Cake. They were both scrumptious.  The service was excellent without being smothering. We are looking forward to having family for brunch in December. It is definitely very good but do NOT go there expecting to eat Tex Mex or you may be disappointed.  This is definitely interior Mexican cuisine.  Also  Tuesday is the day for all day Happy Hour with half price appetizers if you are sitting in the bar.  The bar was certainly crowded so I can only assume the drinks and appetizers were good also.
Fonda San Miguel,421,What an amazing interior Mexican restaurant  The minute you walk in you are immediately transported into a jungle like atmosphere  complete with a  sometimes  squawking parrot  Try to make a reservation if possible because the place can fill up. If you aren t able to get a table  you can often sit in the bar area  which I actually prefer   The Pisco Sour cocktail is the best Pisco Sour I ve had in Austin and for your dinner  I recommend the Cochinita Pibil. Deliciously tender pork prepared in a banana leaf served with dipping sauces  rice and beans. The brunch is a little pricey  but also delicious. Great for special occasions 
Fonda San Miguel,422,Dear Fond a  that man Miguel    I have crush on you... could you tell  Today you seduced me with your wanton ways  delicious drinks  your sly smiles  I almost didn t know what was happening until i felt my heart start tapping it s proverbial feet to a mash up of El Mariachi and Brenda Russel s piano in the dark.   Your  plantation  basil drink was titillating... but not as spicy as that hot little michelada. Don t make me talk about the mojitos - I m not ready to go there. It was a spiritual thing that doesn t belong on a public forum.  You sated my hunger with ring-ring-rings of calamari perfectly and lightly fried with a savory flavor I can t quite identify. But hey  I love a man of mystery. And the sopasitos... well lets just say you can put those in my mouth anytime. Also  our server. Thanks for that little present. He was uhmazing.  I left  elated  With heart full and promises of many returns. Check your right pocket for my phone number.    Oh and Brenda  Keep on rockin    a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbit.ly 2FZWPkO amp s 69103a445efe86b2eaada6ba580bb076fa54b46146bae10199fdd970d7703b31  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bit.ly ZWPkO  a  
Fonda San Miguel,423,This is my favorite restaurant in the  ATX   real authentic Yucatan Mexican food. Have a silver coin or a cucumber Margarita they re fantastic and the coffee here is not to be missed
Fonda San Miguel,424,Thank you so much to the two locals who directed us here. Never have I had a more beautiful or satisfying experience for brunch. Lamb  chicken  pulled pork  shrimp  ceviche  salads  tacos  a whole table of amazing desserts  and to wash it all down  The most amazing watermelon infused Margherita. Or four. Just couldn t stop. Of course  I had to uber out of there. Brunch on Sunday is only 11 -2. Get there early if you don t have a reservation or you may not get a seat. The amazing hours-long prep that it must have taken for those dishes can t be described here - I don t have the skill. Trust me - you will love me if you follow this advice  go  And don t forget to look up  The decor and the atmosphere transport you. I m flying back to Austin just to eat here again 
Fonda San Miguel,425,Great food and atmosphere. It feels like you re in Mexico. The drinks are really good too and I recommend their brunch.
Fonda San Miguel,426,Came with friends midweek. No valet but plenty of onsite parking. Cool art and ambiance. Good service and food was good. Their margaritas still don t beat Santa Catarina s. We would come back
Fonda San Miguel,427,I really enjoyed the food. It was my first time there  and it was my 40th bday. I ordered the enchiladas suizas. They were soft to cut into. The chicken was juicy and a lot of flavor. I also ordered the corn soup which was so delicious. It was creamy with crispy tortilla on top. Enjoyed the atmosphere and customer service  and the paintings. James was our waiter  I will be going there again 
Fonda San Miguel,428,NOT what I remembered.  Asked waiter if the cook could add spinach for my dates mushroom quesadilla and was told no but you could order a spinach salad   It was my birthday so we just stayed the course only I woke up this morning thinking we should have moved on.  Drinks were fair  entree were bleh.  Tortillas were cold.  Won t go back.
Fonda San Miguel,429,After hearing a lot of hype  I had to try this place out.  To start-The chips and salsa were good to mediocre.  Mexican martini also did not disappoint  doesn t come with the shaker which was a bummer but that is to be expected at the nicer places  rights   The chicken tortilla soup was a bit underwhelming though. It was more of a tortilla only soup as I did not taste any chicken  but that s not to say the flavor wasn t good because it was.  For the entre I had the chipotle shrimp and that was FABULOUS. Pretty spicy but on my goodness the flavor was bold.  Final words  worth a shot.
Fonda San Miguel,430,This is the very best brunch in town   Collection of interiorana Mexican cuisine and other Latin American dishes that are delicious and authentic 
Fonda San Miguel,431,Atmosphere is a  5   otherwise  this place is a  3 -- waitstaff average  food average  drinks average. Husband and I went as we had heard how great it was  but we have agreed we won t t go back. Try if you must  but trust that you will only feel like spending     one time on average food and service.
Fonda San Miguel,432,sunday brunch cannot be missed   always amazing food and service   i love to come here for birthdays or anniversaries or any time i have a reason to celebrate. also the restaurant is stunning and i love the bright foyer
Fonda San Miguel,433,Had their Sunday brunch buffet this past weekend.   Some things they had  beef tips in a mushroom cream sauce  quail  chips and guac  fish with some chipotle mayo sauce  fish ceviche  fruit salad  black beans  Mexican potato au gratin  poached eggs  chicken mole  tortillas  corn casserole  stuffed peppers  tamales  cactus salad...  Desserts included red velvet cake  tequilamisu  choc chip cookie bar  cookie varieties  chocolate cake  tres leches  some kind of awkward bread pudding  rice pudding  Mexican chocolate mousse  flan...  -Quality of Food  Great  I had almost everything they had to offer. -Variety of Food Offered  The amount of different food offered at this buffet is about half of what I ve run into at other buffets around this price point. ANNNNND bottomless alcoholic drinks aren t offered within this cost like other places  Green Pastures  amp  TRIO  -Food  Traditional Mexican.Don t come here expecting Tex Mex. -Quality of Desserts  Extremely disappointing. I tried a sampling of almost all the desserts. It all tasted like Walmart quality for the most part     -Quality of Alcoholic Drinks  We ordered some cucumber pepper marg. Was good. They didn t skimp on the tequila. HOWEVER  they re overpriced at  13 each  It wasn t a big margarita....and don t forget they fill that thing up FULL of ice. Little actual drink    -Quality of Service  Our server was great  At the buffet  they don t keep plates stacked up front like normal. The server replenishes your plate. He always was quick and I never sat there - the 4 times i went up to the actual buffet table - waiting for him to give me a plate.He was attentive and personable.   Overall  I would go back but not for a long time for brunch. It is slightly overpriced at almost  40 pp. It d have to be something along the lines of me having an extreme craving for Mexican that can t be fulfilled anywhere else. Or idk....just think of something really drastic that would have to happen.   I WOULD go back for their dinner though and give that a try for sure.
Fonda San Miguel,434,I think the word is Hype.  The prices don t justify the food.  Don t get me wrong the food is good  it s just not note worthy.  The mole was plain and lacked the bold spice and flavor I would expect from such a highly rated restaurant.  The staff was a bit flip and pretentious  for example our party of 9 couldn t be seated until the tab for one drink from the bar was paid.  So my family including my 90 grand mother had to wait 20 minutes for this little transaction to take place.  What did they think we would skip out on the bar tab   Anyway its the price like 20 bucks for enchiladas and 38 for carne asada that leave me scratching my head.  They are making money so more power to them but I won t be spending it there again.
Fonda San Miguel,435,Quality control seems to be suffering these days at FSM. I ve loved this restaurant for decades now...but I cannot say that it is the  best  restaurant in Austin for interior Mexican  Mex-Mex  cuisine. So sad.  Fonda San Miguel has ALL of the right cues to make a killer restaurant  friendly and attentive staff  a beautiful interior  great location  and fairly unique menu. However  my most recent visit - on a busy Tuesday night - was thoroughly disappointing. Most dishes came out lukewarm  including the traditional chile con queso which turns into a lump of white cheese when it cools. Not good. The pre-mixed unfrozen margaritas were not bad but the frozen one I had was insipid - I ve had better cough syrup.   Our entrees were average  A pollo pibil was essentially half a whole chicken rolling around on the plate  presentation counts   while the classic enchiladas suizas were good by lacked flava  and were on the cooler side when they arrived . There was an odd bit of something that I ate in them  too. All this for  80 for two. Not a huge price but still on the upper end of all things Mexican in Austin.   Three stars  regrettably. I hope that the kitchen staff improves. This is a great ol  Austin restaurant which I hope can start hitting ALL cylinders soon.
Fonda San Miguel,436,Hands down my favorite restaurant EVER  The atmosphere is absolutely stunning and the food is to die for. It s a bit pricey but worth every penny. I ve been here quite a few times and have never encountered any issues.
Fonda San Miguel,437,My family loves this place. The food and the wait staff are outstanding  as is the ambiance here. Come for Sunday brunch. You won t be disappointed.
Fonda San Miguel,438,It wasn t the worst date ever. That award goes to the guy that had a bugger running down his face during dinner  not at FSM . The problem is that it was one of those thick buggers - and I couldn t just rub my own nose in the hopes that he d get it. He d have just smeared it all over his face. So what do you do    The date I had at Fonda San Miguel was better than that... but still not good. The problem is that when we ordered drinks  he just blurted out that he wanted a couple of appetizers. First date. Never ate food together  how do you know what I want to eat  And did he even consult me whether I d like what he ordered  Nope. Then when the bill came around... um yep  we went halves... and the appetizers were all that  we  ordered. Don t get me wrong - the pork tacos were delicious and the ceviche was absolutely fantastic. The pork tacos were not dry and full of flavor. And the ceviche was spot on.  FSM is great for dates in general though... we had a nice little table tucked away so that we could chat uninterrupted - if that s what you re looking for. The food is great - two appetizers was enough to fill you up and not break the pocket book  thankfully . The drinks were absolutely fantastic. They know how to mix a good margarita. Very  very good. And next time I ll order 3 so that I can handle the news that I m paying for food I didn t even order.   
Fonda San Miguel,439,Best Mexican food anywhere. The atmosphere  food and especially the service are all top notch and very professional. The watermelon infused margarita and the Nuevo Estilo cocktails are fantastic. Even the humble charro bean appetizer is exquisite. I have been dining at Fonda for over 10 years and Fonda has consistently delivered an outstanding dining experience.
Fonda San Miguel,440,Let me first start by saying I don t really care for Mexican food  Well that has changed   Wow I lived there food here   I had there Crab enchiladas with a white sauce  It was amazing   There caso  cheese dip  is totally different than other places  It was overall a great experience and has changed my mind on Mexican food   Will be back    
Fonda San Miguel,441,6 people  dinner on a Saturday  total around  268-ish including tip.  I took my mom who is very particular about any kind of Mexican food  because she s from Mexico  and her thinking is  I know how to make it  so I don t have to go out and buy it . This time around I wanted her to try something different and step out of the norm. My party had a reservation  thank goodness  because the lot was almost full at 5 30. The exterior and interior are traditional Mexican stucco hacienda style with lots of tile artwork and heavy wood work. The downside to the interior is the lighting  it was fine when we were seated but when our appetizers came out  they dimmed the lighting. I uploaded pictures and you can see how dark it was.   The chips taste like they are from El Milagro  not complaining  just saying because I love El Milagro chips   the red salsa it was sweet  yet mild in spicyness  the green chile was sweet as well but that s because they put lime which was very noticeable in taste.  The fresh corn and flour tortillas are thin  but they taste like they are made from maseca  which is powdered corn meal   but they re good  Again  just describing the taste     The cheese enchiladas suizas were extremely rich  filling  but not overwhelming. The enchiladas de pato were really good  not rich in this case  but it wasn t filling for my boyfriend who ended up picking off of my plate. The pollo asado was served sizziling hot  and my mom had to plate half of it away because it s a large portion they serve on the skillet. Most of the dishes we ordered came with refried black beans  which were so good  and fried rice which was fluffy and so tasty. The coffee my mom ordered was french roast and she said it was fresh  served hot and in cute blue and white cups.  As for the other three dishes I can t comment on  sorry  because my two brothers and sis-in-law inhaled everything  and I forgot what they ordered .  The tres leches was good but not great  it was very dry in the middle but I guess that s why they put milk on the plate to soak in.   One thing that my mom didn t like  but the rest of us were pleased with was the service. Our server was extremely attentive and patient  water was constantly replenished  which irked my mom  because she said that she was fine but didn t like that servers kept coming up behind her and reaching for her glass   and the corn and flour tortillas were brought out when we were low.   For 7 alcoholic drinks  one coffee  two appetizers  6 main dishes  and one dessert  at dinner time I would say that all-in-all it was pretty pricey but this was a once a year kind of treat for my family. Definitely go and try it out 
Fonda San Miguel,442,Wonderfully attentive waiters  beautiful decorated restaurant with a great atmosphere.   We had four drinks  baked cheese appetizer  and one of the best chile rellenos ever.     Great for any day  fantastic for a date night  and definitely worth going for an anniversary dinner.  Prices were very reasonable  and you can t beat the ambiance.
Fonda San Miguel,443,Four stars for menu  execution  and ambience.  Feels like you re visiting a wealthy friend s hacienda.  My host told me this is George W. Bush s favorite Mexican restaurant for what it s worth.  Republicans will say  Yea    Democrats will say  Nay  
Fonda San Miguel,444,My Husband took me for Sunday Brunch on my birthday the Food was good almost like home made  but the service not so much not to mention almost  100dlls tip to a waiter that only showed up a couple of times as well I think little over priced for the variety of plates and they ask you for reservations 1-2 weeks ahead of time just to arrive on time to be waiting to be seated for 30 min in a very crowded atrium patio and my family had to wait outside in their cars because they had a exhibition or something like that so over all not a very placent time at the place for those little things but only because family was there I enjoyed the moment...by the way the decor is gorgeous 
Fonda San Miguel,445,This was a really disappointing experience. Our server was super awkward and rude. At one point a glass shattered by our table and glass flew all over our table and was on our chairs. They took forever to clear our table and didn t do anything...they could have easily comped our appetizer or sodas or ANYTHING. Instead  our server said things like  I can only do one thing at a time  when we told him there was glass on our plates. For a supposedly high end Mexican restaurant the service was some of the worst I ve ever experienced. We told the manager as we left and he apologized but didn t actually do anything  which is a pretty worthless customer service practice. The queso was bland but our entrees were good. Probably wouldn t recommend or return.
Fonda San Miguel,446,This restaurant is delightful even before you walk in the door  It s like walking into a Magical Mexican hacienda of culinary delights  We had the buffet and everything was so yummy. I m a Mexican so I can fully say that the food was authentic and fresh from the garden and everything was amazing.
Fonda San Miguel,447,I use to really like this place and hadn t been back in years until the other night and was shocked on the quality of their food. I m very sad for this place it use to be my favorite  must of switched owners  Manager  I will not be going back and wouldn t recommend  sad to say
Fonda San Miguel,448,Let me start out by saying that Fonda San Miguel has wonderful food.  Really - very special  celebration-worthy interior Mexican food that is top notch.  It is true that it isn t cheap  but the food is among the best Mexican I ve had in the United States  I lived in Mexico for some time  and it is a real testament to the good stuff .  However  having not been to Fonda San Miguel for some time  I went while on business for an evening meal by myself  and I ended up a fairly disappointed customer.  I asked for a suggestion on what I should have from the waiter.  Should I have a couple of appetizers  or one of the Chiles Rellenos on offer  Even though I had offered my own preferences  which all fell in the  16- 17 range   He suggested I order the Carne Asada  duck enchiladas and a shrimp dish  my menu was closed and it was late  so I didn t ask for time to review .  I indicated that I thought that would be far too much food  and it certainly would have been  particularly for a 9 30 pm meal   so he suggested that I just have one enchilada and the Carne Asada.  I therefore consented.  It was tasty  but I was very dismayed and felt taken advantage of when the bill came and the Carne Asada alone was twice the price of any other dish on the menu.  In addition  when I ve had Carne Asada elsewhere  it is usually smaller pieces of meat  but this was a full steak  and far too heavy for such a late meal.  The waiter clearly had his own bottom line in mind and not what I might really enjoy. I felt that he  had a live one  as he knew I was in town for business  and frankly  it has more or less left a very bad taste at the end of what was a lovely meal. Moreover  he was clearly anxious to be rid of me quickly  as he brought the check without even asking if I d like to take a look at the dessert menu  which I was very disappointed about . I almost corrected him and asked for the menu to order something  but he disappeared in a hurry and that was that.  Overall  Fonda San Miguel will maintain a very special place in my memory  but it lost a little of its luster.
Fonda San Miguel,449,I had high expectations coming here-was very disappointed. I had the pollo pibil-there was just nothing great about it. I didn t care for the red sauce with onions that it was doused in. It was a large piece of chicken-thigh connected to breast-just not much flavor. It was paired with about 3 tbsp if rice pilaf and refried black beans. The waiter forgot my drink order-the. It wasn t even made properly-how do you screw up an Old Fashioned    When I arrived I still had my Xmas antlers on my car-waited over 5 min for the valet guys to assist me-I finally rolled down my window and asked if I was in the right spot to request valet  they apologized-stated they thought I was a ride share.....why  Because I was driving a Camry instead of a Mercedes or Benz   Ridiculous
Fonda San Miguel,450,Go on Tuesdays for their happy hour  Their delicious margaritas are only  5 instead of  10.  Their portion sizes for food are too small for the price you pay. But what you are paying for is the ambiance. The decor is beautiful  When you step in  you feel like you re on vacation in another country.   I ve only been able to sit in the open area since they re packed. You have to make reservations really early. But even in the front  we got great service from our waitress.  They can t give separate checks  so bring cash so you can easily split the bill if you re with a group.
Fonda San Miguel,451,The architecture of this hacienda style restaurant is not to be missed. So happy their food matched up to the ambiance and hype. Salsas were great. Chips were crisp and lite. We ordered conchinita pibil  pork in banana leaf  which was divine. The chicken mole was fantastic as well.   Margaritas were small which was my only negative. They would have gotten 5 stars otherwise.
Fonda San Miguel,452,As someone who grew up in Austin  I ve been dismayed by how much Austin has changed for the worse--the traffic  the massive influx of people  and commercialism--which has caused Austin to lose some of its beloved culture. Many institutions in Austin have gone away to make way for shiny new chains and so-called  hipster  establishments that just plain suck. But I digress...  I ve been coming to Fonda San Miguel for over 20 years now  and everything about this place has been nothing but excellent. From the moment you approach the big wooden doors  you are instantly transformed into a beautifully decorated and nicely laid-out restaurant.  There is a pleasantly airy  indoor courtyard in which to wait until you are seated. During that time  they will bring chips and salsa and take drink orders. And this isn t your typical  run-of-the-mill  salsa. We are talking a vibrant green salsa made from roasted green tomatillos and a smoky red salsa both with perfect consistency and balance.  From there  you will be led around the buffet setup in the center to a cozy table with welcoming brown  leather chairs. Everything I ve ever ordered has been amazing. For the entr e  I typically opt for the Chicken Enchiladas Verdes as I m a huge fan of their green tomatillo salsa. This does not disappoint. And the rice and beans that accompany this dish are equally impressive. Not to mention the basket of fresh  corn tortillas. For dessert  I seem to always gravitate towards the Flan de Almendra and or the Crepas de Cajeta. The coffees are very good as well.  I ve come with my parents a few times on a weekend around 5 pm and have been able to get a walk-in without any problems. But...no guarantees if you wait until 5 30 or later. It gets packed pretty quickly. We get there no later than 5 10 pm and check in.
Fonda San Miguel,453,A lovely anniversary dinner  Although not an intimate place  perhaps better for larger parties. We were seated in the dining area to the far side. Throughout the entire restaurant  the decor is fun and authentic. The bar area is loud  but festive  and the dining room is  slightly  more subdued  with gorgeous paintings on the walls and chandeliers hanging from the ceilings. The chairs have a bit of a conference center feel but are very comfortable.   The food and drinks were delicious  We started with cocktails  a Silvertail margarita  watermelon   and a mojito - both were very tasty. Calamari as an appetizer with chipotle mayonnaise  enchiladas de pato  duck  and camarones en crema de chipotle as mains - all delicious. The green sauce over the enchiladas was VERY green  almost looking artificial. Everything was served very fast - we actually hadn t accounted for that and were more prepared to have a slower-paced meal  but we split a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that we sat with long after our dishes were cleared.  And we got a dessert on the house to celebrate the occasion  It wasn t the dessert I d been eyeing  but was good all the same - and free  which is of course very nice. Some kind of milk pudding with mango on top.   All in all  a very nice evening with good food and service.
Fonda San Miguel,454,Like with any ethnic cuisine  if you don t see the ethnicity of people that the restaurant claims to be  then you re probably in trouble.  Showed up to what I was told was a Mexican restaurant and all I saw were Land Rovers and WASPs. I immediately began to wonder if I was in the right place... Once we were seated  I was told they didn t have Topo Chico. That s when I completely stopped believing we were in a Mexican restaurant.  There were 8 of us  and the service was very good. Casual  fast  and polite. We ordered all manner of items  and everyone that had a cocktail said they were great. I had Voss sparkling water  since they didn t have Topo Chico. I had the special quesadillas and tamales. They were good and fairly priced  but nothing amazing.  I m glad I went for my friend s birthday  but I won t be frequenting this establishment. Worth a try if you want a classy night with upscale folks but not if you want a casual and authentic Mexican food experience.
Fonda San Miguel,455,Went here for brunch today for the first time despite being an old time Austinite. What an amazing spread  The cornbread and beef with cream were out of this world. Every other dish was very unique and the dessert bar was fabulous. Our waiter also was very attentive. A great experience
Fonda San Miguel,456,Food was great but Why in this hell would you keep a beautiful parrot in a cage in your restaurant  Birds are meant to fly and be free. Sad. Hey
Fonda San Miguel,457,This is one of my favorite special occasion places.  The food is always good and the service is excellent.  The drinks are tasty and they have a nice bar area.  The atmosphere is nice and not too loud.  The only negative for me is some of the food is a bit overpriced.   18 for cheese enchiladas...ouch...
Fonda San Miguel,458,Fonda San Miguel is the best place to brunch in Austin  mic drop   and you can t beat the vibe of their lounge area. It s pricey but worth it.
Fonda San Miguel,459,Atmosphere was very  Austin . I had a great time. Good was delicious. The flan was on point
Fonda San Miguel,460,Superb service  great atmosphere and it s exactly what you expect when you go for a brunch.  It s like you were invited for a special tasting with decadent Mexican cuisine.  Not only did they have great feature entrees like their Chicken Mole and delectable tamales but their spread is very appealing.  For some reason  their hot tea was what made it for me.  Their loose tea teapot was great as it really added to the aromatics and the freshness to the tea and the food as well.    You can definitely tell that everything was prepared fresh.  Not to mention that the drinks were all prepared well.  From the mimosas  to the coffee and tea.  It s definitely not a place to go every weekend but a place to devour on a special occasion with a group of people or a special someone.  Now that I think about it  I m craving the ceviche again.
Fonda San Miguel,461,This high end interior mexican restaurant is simply awesome.  The food is excellent.   Very pricy.   If my mom ever came to town to visit me then I know where I would have her take me  This isn t much of a review but there are 1000s of other 5 star reviews of this place that you can read.  Just get down to Fonda s if you haven t been there yet.
Fonda San Miguel,462,After a long day  we decided to dinner at Fonda tonight and had a great meal   The mojito my boyfriend got was really good  one of the best he s had here in TX  or as close as the ones to Coastal Flats in VA as he s tasted which was a big plus.   We loved the decor - the Morrocan-style lamps are beautiful  especially the large cluster in the middle of the main dining area. The sitting area was really beautiful as well...and we loved the giant doors at the main entrance - it really felt like someone put a lot into the place. Even the menus are fantastic pieces of art that are well done.   We got the Pollo Asada   chicken fajitas  Camarones Al Mojo De Ajo   shrimp  and the Quesos Asados. The Pollo Asada really lacked flavor....I ve had better elsewhere  it just didn t seem to be seasoned. For unseasoned fajitas  the quality of everything was up to par....but it s just missing...something. Everything else was absolutely fantastic  though. I ll make special mention of the beans - which were pureed black beans  or refried black beans - very similar to that at Gloria s in the Domain but so much better - lighter and more flavorful. We also really liked the corn and flour tortillas. The corn are the best we ve had in a while  but the flour tortillas fell a little short and we still prefer the ones at Papasito s.   We couldn t tell if the chips were homemade or not - I m hedging on store bought type though  as they really weren t what you d have at say Chuy s or Papasitos which was really disappointing considering the fantastic tortillas they make.   We came in early  so there wasn t any wait and our service was fantastic - nicely timed through ordering  boxing up left overs and payment.  So overall  we had a pretty good experience and will definitely be back to try different things. I must say  if it hadn t been for the flat fajitas  this would easily have been a five-star review.
Fonda San Miguel,463,Fonda gets a 5 star from me when evaluating only their Sunday brunch which wins on both quality and quantity.  There are way too many amazing things on the brunch but some highlights for me   Starting your meal with an awesome mimosa and hot freshly hand made corn and flour tortillas.  You can see them cooking all of the tortillas right beside the bar area.  Cold items wise there were some great options.  The Ceviche Veracruzano was excellent as were the fried fish with chipotle mayo sauce.  They also have a huge tub of guacamole that had very strong amounts of citrus juice in it along with grapes which you don t see often.  I liked it.  Hot items wise are where the true stand outs were.  Amazing Budin de Elote  corn pudding   one of my favorites on the buffet.  Also Chicken Mole Verde with toasted pumpkin seeds was fantastic.  The best hot dish was probably their Cochinita Pibil  slow roasted pork in banana leaf with pickled red onion .  I had to get a massive second helping of this it was so amazing.  Some other interesting dishes included chilaquiles  their very spicy migas  a brussel sprout   bacon stew type dish  and tamales with salsa verde.  Not to be eclipsed by the main meal  the dessert buffet at Fonda is ridiculously good.  So many options  traditional mexican cookies  I liked the cherry chocolate ones the best   creme brulee  chocolate cake  almond flan  great   capirotada  bread pudding - so good   arroz con leche  rice pudding   mini eclairs with custard cream  tres leches  just ok have had a lot better in town   custard tarts  poached spiced pear  apple pie  and one of the best chocolate mousse dishes I have ever had.
Fonda San Miguel,464,I was on a business trip and when I asked where I should eat BOTH uber drivers told me about this place. Business travel is hard so the one pleasure I do find when I m on the road is eating  and I take it seriously. The restaurant is in an off the beaten path location  ie not downtown   although not hard to get to. The chips and salsa wet great  light perfect chips and salsas that for me were just right on the spicy scale.  I ordered the chile con queso and they are right when they say  serves2  -if not more if you are going onto an entree. This not your typical tex mex melted cheese  It s a hearty plate with lots going on. Really delicious  But I could hardly make a dent by myself.  I sat in the bar and my server  Sven  was very responsive and timely. He was great   Moving right along I ordered the enchiladas de pato. Wow  I love duck but had never had it Mexican style  Again it walks the perfect line of spiciness.    And once again my waiters timing was impeccable as my margarita landed mere seconds after my entr e.   I was basking in the warm glow of culinary satisfaction when they were finished. I Have a serious sweet tooth problem so no matter how full I am I always have to look at the dessert menu. Tonight it was the flan de almendra. I expected more of a  crime br l e   type presentation but it s actually a slice of a flan tort. It was  sweet but not as satisfying as the rest of my meal. I wish they had either a mind blowing chocolate dessert or something like sopapillas. Maybe I ll try the tres leches cake next time. Because I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip to Austin 
Fonda San Miguel,465,First time here. Had a gift card from my realtor. Came for brunch it was buffet style. The place is beautiful. The food looked delicious passing by the buffet. It was absolutely tasteless. Growing up in a Latino family I was expecting the food to be out of this world. Specially when I saw that they had Quails. Oh Man. The disappointment got even worse when I got the bill.  40 dollars a head. I ended up paying 131  for food that Gordon Ramsey would of spat back out.
Fonda San Miguel,466,SO MUCH FUN  I feel like this statement pretty much sums up this restaurant. When you walk in you are greeted with some of the most intriguing architecture  sounds and art. This open seating area bleeds into the bar  and in some ways was even more fun to hang out in than the actual dining area  We arrived at the restaurant early for our 8pm reservation  oops  My fault. I thought our reservation was at 7 30 . We sat in this gorgeous lobby area for about 2 seconds before a nice bartender got our margarita order. 10 seconds later  we had chips and salsa. 5 minutes later  drinks. 10 minutes later  we sat at our table early      Our waiter was perfectly loud and fun. He gave us some great recommendations and took very good care of the 6 of us. We split both the queso and the quesos asados with rajas and chorizo verde. I tell you what folks... I would ve eaten that queso asados  all night if I could   So amazing. Definitely a must with their flour tortillas.   For dinner  it seemed we all enjoyed our dishes. I got ancho relleno san miguel and was not very impressed. It was good  but it wasn t especially savoy. I did try my sister-in-law s pollo pibil and that was significantly better  so perhaps I will go with that next time 
Fonda San Miguel,467,I took my wife and 3 daughters here and was sadly dissappointed.  There were some positives - excellent green salsa  great corn soup  gorgeous dining room and interesting chile renellos with pork.  However  there were also too many negatives   - the fish tacos - a special - were not very tasty  - chicken fajitas were very plain  - we were right under the air conditioner vent.  It was freezing.  If when they take you into the dining room and your table is to the right and in the corner  say NO or put on a parka.  I knew I had made a mistake when my teenagers  who are usually great judges of food quality and taste  said  Torchy s does a much better job .   Overall  this restaurant is way too expensive for what you get.
Fonda San Miguel,468,If you are looking for a wonderful meal with a SO or even just a special birthday celebration  this is the place to go   This is one of my favorite places in Austin to eat.  Their Ceviche is amazing.  My favorite dish  though  is grilled lamb chops.  They melt in your mouth and are cooked to perfection   I cook lamb at home  and I can honestly say  I hope one day I can cook lamb that well   The mole sauce is a bit on the spicy side  I LOVE mole  .  No matter you order  you will not be disappointed.  The Sunday Brunch is also quite amazing   If you are looking for tacos and nachos  this is NOT the place   If you are looking for exceptional regional dishes from all over Mexico  then make a reservation and prepare for a very unique and lovely dining experience 
Fonda San Miguel,469,I came here for my birthday and it was so amazing. We all agreed how amazing each individual food was. Usually we can decide what s better  but I kid you not EVERY single bite from the appetizers to the dessert.
Fonda San Miguel,470,If you come here  expect good food. Then when you try the dishes  you ll be blown away. I came in with zero expectations and had an amazing plate of Ancho Relleno San Miguel.   Well with the price. Excellent service. I m stuffed.
Fonda San Miguel,471,Happy Hour is a great way to try several dishes in small bites for incredible prices. I would also recommend that you go to their brunch. The atmosphere inside is large paintings and plants- for those who are not sure their food is very interior Mexico. So Brunch and HH are the best choices other than that you might as well be taking your boss out for dinner and drinks to discuss your next promotion.
Fonda San Miguel,472,The decor in here felt very outdated  like I stepped back into a restaurant that had it s heyday 10 years ago.  I have no clue how the margaritas here are supposedly ranked highly among Austin restaurants - I found them to taste like cheap bottled mix and well tequila.  We got a ceviche and fried oysters as an appetizer.  The oysters were served on chips making them a bit hard to eat  but were overall not bad.  I ve had lots of much better ceviche  it was pretty bland.  I got the cochnita pibil as an entree  and my wife got some chicken that looked just liked chicken fajitas you d get at any Tex-Mex restaurant.  The pibil was good  but everything was very sweet.  I asked for some spicy salsa  and the waiter brought me a very small dish of the spiciest one they had.  I later asked for more  and was told there would be a charge.  Our total bill was over  220 with three people  food and drinks   so getting charged for salsa is slightly insulting.  He said it was policy that they could only give the smaller amount for free.  My wife s chicken had zero salt and was severely overcooked.  My favorite thing was actually the rice I got with my entree - it had radish in it that gave it a nice  light flavor.  The desserts were good  with the flan being my personal favorite.  The ice cream with Frangelico were up near the top as well.  There are places all over town you can get a higher caliber of food at 1 3rd the price for.  I don t get the appeal of this place  and doubt I ll be back soon.
Fonda San Miguel,473,Only had late afternoon appetizers  so I can t give a review of the full menu  but service was attentive and you can t go wrong with homemade tortillas being produced a few feet away.  Had the Angels on Horseback and while I found the actual shrimp to be nothing unique  the pickled veggies they served with them were phenomenal   Our waitress said most people don t even eat them - they re missing out   Quesadillas were ok.  Atmosphere was great   I haven t been to interior Mexico  but I imagine FSM is pretty authentic.
Fonda San Miguel,474,Really a 3 and a half. The dinners are great  but the brunch is not a very good experience. A fancy Mexican Brunch for over 50 bucks per person needs to really knock your socks off  This one doesn t. This is just like most other brunches  its about feeding the masses. Not a pleasant experience and I have tried it 3 times over the years. I m done. However the Dinner experience is excellent. Service has never been great  but the food and atmosphere are authentic and enjoyable  and worth the heavy price.  This place is best on week nights. This restaurant is best enjoyed peacefully. When they are full it takes away from not only the service  but also the overall ambiance.
Fonda San Miguel,475,I paid a second visit to Fonda San Miguel last night and am officially a fan. The first time I went  I had the Ancho Relleno San Miguel  a subtly flavored  but delicious chile relleno stuffed with all sorts of savory chicken  capers  and olives.  Last night  I joined a friend for happy hour. After battling the squishy parking lot and insanely crowded bar area  I feared that my overwhelm would cloud my previously positive experience. Fortunately  we ended up landing a spot at the end of the bar and enjoyed a lovely evening of libations and half-priced appetizers. I loved the quesos asados with rajas and chorizo verde - cheesy  flavorful  and served with warm tortillas. My friend fell for the lamb chops  which I liked but thought were a little overcooked. We both gave a thumbs-up to the tacos al pastor.  All in all  the Fonda San Miguel price point makes it a bit steep for a random weeknight dinner  but the happy hour gives you the same beautiful space with much more reasonably priced food.
Fonda San Miguel,476,I ve long enjoyed their brunch  but this was the first time I ve been here for dinner.  I love uncomplicated menu sectioned by item type  salads  enchiladas  rellenos  carnes  chicken dishes and seafood dishes.  My Ancho Relleno San Miguel was so delicious   The minced chicken meat with the olives  capers and almonds was very flavorful  and the cilantro creme sauce drizzled over the dish was light and didn t overpower the dish.  For dessert I had the milk caramel crepes and I cannot recommend these enough  the accompanying cajeta ice cream is to die for   The bartender can make a variety of margarita style beverages  even flavors not on the menu  he created a lovely pear margarita for me.
Fonda San Miguel,477,Special decorations. The place is very spacious. Good for large group dinners. Meals are good but not above expectations. Plenty of parking.
Fonda San Miguel,478,Love this place  Great drinks  Great food  It s nice and very clean. Light environment  nothing too rowdy. Good for a date night. Customer service experience is always wonderful  Definitely recommend.
Fonda San Miguel,479,Beautiful atmosphere  great service and good food drinks. I was there yesterday and enjoyed it. It s not Tex-Mex so don t go there if you re expecting something like that. I had the ceviche and it was tasty and fresh. I ll be back to try their pibil one of these days.
Fonda San Miguel,480,Best Interior Mexican food in a beautiful setting reminiscent of a Mexican Hacienda. Favorite item in the menu  Enchiladas suizas and all of their appetizers This is not a Tex-Mex restaurant  but rather a taste of gourmet Mexican food  the way you would eat it at an upscale Restaurant in Mexico City. Enjoy 
Fonda San Miguel,481,Food and drinks are always spot on  My husband and I usually sit at the bar and enjoy full service for dinner there as well. The fresh tortillas and corn raja soup are my favorite. We also love the ancho chili rellano. You can t go wrong with the delicious  Silver Coin   which is a freshly pur ed watermelon juice Margaret. Herbs and some veggies are grown in their garden. Hands down my favorite place for authentic interior Mexican cuisine.
Fonda San Miguel,482,This place is so beautiful - the design  the decor  the art  uh  Amazing  The food was very delicious i had the stuffed squash and it was gone before i could blink  it was that good. The service was impeccable. And the Tres Leches was a dream. My only qualm was that it seemed a bit overpriced  but it was worth it because it was such a great experience. Definitely a great date spot.
Fonda San Miguel,483,One of the best dining experiences in Austin  period. Beautiful decor  outstanding service and some of the best food around. We went to brunch recently and  while it wasn t cheap  it was totally worth it.
Fonda San Miguel,484,Came here with a group.  Had high expectations.  I was underwhelmed.  The decor was really nice.  The ceviche was really good.  Had the pork   chchinta pipel was dry.  I rear the Lanb Chand was good.  Not happy
Fonda San Miguel,485,What a dreamy and fun restaurant. On top of the great space and decor  my margarita was perfect  the free chips and salsa were fresh and spicy  and the mole enchiladas were so good I kept eating it even though my stomach was at maximum capacity. I sat at the bar  which was oddly taller than it should be so I had to be a bit more careful when eating. Overall I highly recommend.
Fonda San Miguel,486,Maybe my palate isn t refined. Maybe I went on an off night. Maybe I don t appreciate this type of food. Maybe I don t understand food at all.  Maybe it just doesn t live up to the hype. Maybe it s just a little too pretentious for me. Maybe it s obscenely overpriced for the quality and quantity of food.  Cochinita Pibil. I ve had this many times in the Yucatan and love the dish. Just not here. A whopping  20 for a small amount of dry pork in a banana leaf. I can only guess I m paying for presentation. I mean...it was pretty to look at.  Pollo en Mole Poblano. Dry chicken. Again   20 for a leg quarter with a blob of flat tasting mole. No complexity to the mole  at all.   Pescado Veracruzano. If memory serves  about  27 for a nasty chunk of tilapia. Here s a power tip for the kitchen...when using ingredients like capers and olives  you may want to consider going a little lighter handed on the salt.  I can get superior food and a far more reasonable price any number of places. I guess this is just a place to say  I ve been there . I mean  they have a cookbook  so clearly they are awesome. I ve seen Ramen cookbooks  too...hmmm...
Fonda San Miguel,487,Ate here  a month ago  while visiting a friend.  Great tacos and guacamole.  The atmosphere really made it special.
Fonda San Miguel,488,I travel all over the country  and this is one of my very favorite restaurants.  Last night my meal was perfect - every bite delicious  from the chile con queso made with white cheese through the perfect margarita and the enchiladas suizas  I ordered one cheese and one chicken   to the coffee toffee dessert.  Yum   And good service to boot   It doesn t get any better than this.
Fonda San Miguel,489,Everything was awesome  from our lovely  informative server Olga to the margaritas  the sopes appetizer  the lamb in parchment paper and the mole  And there s leches cake was delicious  Highly recommend   
Fonda San Miguel,490,Always impressed.  We always bring our out of towners here.  Ceviche is fresh and delicious.  Shrimp in the chipotle crema is to die for.  It s big gulf shrimp drenched in a fabulous  smoky crema.  Can t wait to try the brunch.
Fonda San Miguel,491,Fonda San Miguel  I love you. I really really do. But   38.95 per person for a brunch buffet is a little extreme. Every detail at your restaurant is perfect and charming - the beautiful rustic decor that envelopes you as you sit  the Mexican art work  and the chivalrous waiters in soft guayaberas  - all of this make eating with you an enchanting experience. And yes  your buffet today contained some wildly delicious meat stews  sauces that I can t stop thinking about  tortillas grilled just for my table  a perfectly creamy tres leches cake  and a whole lot more  but still..  We showed up for Sunday brunch not expecting quite that price  and luckily I was dining with a generous family member who picked up the tab. But in the future  even if I had that much money to spend on a buffet  I wouldn t. By my second plate I was already feeling the stress of having to get my  38 in  and to me  trying to fill your belly takes away from the charm of enjoying a delicious meal. And why is it that you can t include some beverages in that price  Mimosas too much to ask  Well  there s always coffee and or tea which would be a nice touch.   From the looks of today  you have quite the Sunday brunch following  and I know your dining room usually fills up in advance - so my review may not make much of a difference. But just know that I think that price tag is ridiculous  and frankly  unjustifiable  which is such a bummer because for every other reason I would keep coming back again and again.
Fonda San Miguel,492,I love the atmosphere here  not to mention the food. I enjoy the fajitas. I have always had a great experience when dining here. Can t wait for my next trip to Austin so I can dine here.  Thanks for a great experience as always.
Fonda San Miguel,493,It s hard to really impress me when it comes to authentic Mexican food but this place hits on all cylinders.   The cocktails are amazing  ceviche is fresh and light and the carne asada is unreal   Cannot recommend this place enough.
Fonda San Miguel,494,Service was nice  but the buffet was very average and definitely not worth  40 per person. I tried a lot of different food like the huevos rancheros  tamales  and stuffed poblano but all of them were bland and seemed to be made with very little effort. So many better Mexican food options in Austin.
Fonda San Miguel,495,For some time now  I had heard that Fonda San Miguel was the best Mexican food in the city. We just tried it for the first time this past weekend and I couldn t agree more. We went on a Saturday night at around 8 00PM. We didn t have reservations and the dining room was full  but we were immediately able to sit in the bar area  which was beautiful and large. It was basically a restaurant in and of itself.   Fonda San Miguel has a lovely ambiance  excellent service  and amazingly delicious food. I had the Enchiladas De Pato and my boyfriend had the Carne Asada A La Tampique a. Seriously the best Mexican food I ve ever had. Don t get my wrong  I love my Tex-Mex  but this was for real Mexican food. Absolute perfection.
Fonda San Miguel,496,Excellent food  wonderful ambience truly authentic.
Fonda San Miguel,497,We did all night happy hour for last min date night at sat at the bar  We might never sit in another part of the restaurant. Also Margaritas margaritas the house margaritas are soo good I want them right now  The bartender bar manager I think was super professional  gave perfect recommendations on what to eat and made sure our chips  drinks and plates were never empty in the way without hovering and I love some good service with hustle and not too much attention perfect balance. We order the tower apps  pibil was off the chain and we got the cheese very traditional tasting at least in my mexican home growing up. 1 2 apps and drinks we left with full bellys happy faces  great service and not breaking the bank for dinner. We have to go back before we leave Austin sooo happy   
Fonda San Miguel,498,Great  mole  salsa  mango margaritas  ceviche  service  ambiance.  Love this place  The food is always amazing   If you go here  I recommend the ceviche  the seafood  and particularly the cochinita pibil wrapped in banana leaves.  DON T FORGET THE MANGO MARGARITAS        Yum  and then go on a diet for the rest of the week.
Fonda San Miguel,499,I don t make my way up here often enough  though I should.  Patrons should come here with the understanding they shouldn t be rushed  the food and drinks are meant to be ENJOYED  not just consumed.  The conversation with your brunch dinner partners can be understood without having to be a shouting match.  My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at brunch yesterday  and we were never rushed to eat and get out of there.    If you are going to give  1  star ratings   or any ratings less than  5  stars  please BE SPECIFIC.  I respect Dillar S s review for being honest.  Don t punish the businesses just because you are vaguely disappointed.  Daniel C 11 04 13
Fonda San Miguel,500,Granted... I went there for happy hour  but what the what     The waiter was rude and very short with us.  He didn t want to answer questions  really come to our table  or stay long enough for us to put in a proper order    .  The frozen house margaritas tasted like bad tequila and mix.  The house on the rocks were better.  The food was sub -par at best.  The ceviche had tasteless fish and was mostly onions and tomatoes.  It was more like a side of pico de gallo.  It s redeeming factor was the slice of green avocado.  I really only ended up eating that.  The calamares had a spice on it that was overwhelming and too spicy  like it was trying to mask something.    The quesadillas were very basic and were a bit cold upon arrival.  The place is gorgeous.  I really wanted to like it and I ve been hearing great things for over a decade.  I was so disappointed.  I will not be returning.
Chuy's,1,Chuy s was awesome place to visit and grab lunch at.  We came here for lunch the day prior Labor Day while in Austin on Sunday the 4th.  Christian was at the bar serving drinks and greeted us while we waited to be sat  he offered if we wanted to just pull up a seat and eat at the bar top  so we did.  We had a couple of frozen margaritas  amp  shiner bocks.  We then asked his favorite items on the menu after he brought us chips along with salsa  amp  this really good different style ranch.  The ranch was almost like a cilantro type or something  it was really good with the chips.  We then ordered shrimp tacos  amp  the flautas plate to split both of those.  Both were excellent  the flautas came 6 to a plate  and were fried nice  amp  crispy  no sogginess at all.  The shrimp tacos had excellent flavoring  amp  both came with beans  amp  rice.  This is a franchise out here  I think there s 3 or 4 in the Austin area  but this one is the original  amp  most popular I believe.  I d come back here 100  next time I m we re in Austin.
Chuy's,2,I love chuy s  especially this location. I have so many wonderful memories across the last 35 years  and have always loved the food. HOWEVER  when we were there yesterday  my cheese enchiladas  a beloved indulgence  barely had any cheese in them  and the portions of rice and refried beans on the plate were TINY. We had already been disappointed upon learning that they ve taken chile rellenos off the menu because the prep took too long-- --never mind that they were the BEST Chile rellenos anywhere  as they used a crispy batter as opposed to the spongy eggy one that most Mexican restaurants use. But then I barely get any cheese in the less-prep-requiring cheese enchiladas.  Chuy s  if you re trying to turn into a cheap fast-food restaurant  please let me know. You do still have really good swirl margaritas going for you.   I should have sent the enchiladas back--but I was enjoying the margarita too much to take action 
Chuy's,3,I am from California where like in many states  take Mexican food seriously.  The sign of great Mexican food is the freshness of ingredients served.  I believe this is probably true for  Tex Mex  cuisine.  For me  great attention to the customer is Important which our server Matt possessed in spades.  I like spicy which was not present in the standard salsas served.  I asked if they had anything spicy and he immediately brought me the salsa served with their steak burrito.  Delicious      I ordered the steak burrito whose meat was nicely seared. I recommend this dish if you are not a lover of freshly cooked beans.  Beans served tasted as though they were straight out of a can.  I would have enjoyed my entree if they would have left the beans off of my plate.  Ambiance felt like my grandmothers kitchen which I enjoyed along with a cold Corona and a margarita that came with an inverted bottle of beer.  This drink i highly recommend      This was my first introduction to tex mex food.  During my visit I will try several other non chain restaurants before returning to California.
Chuy's,4,If you re headed to Barton springs  make sure to stop by and grab lunch brunch here first. Don t get fooled from how it looks on the outside  come inside and be mesmerized by the vibe  decor and lively ness    You start with complimentary chips and salsa  which is bottomless  so eat up. Chips are fried to perfection and the salsa is fresh but spicy with fresh chilies    As a vegetarian  my husband and I ordered the veggie enchiladas and opted in to add an additional enchilada since we didn t want to eat too much. Turned out  3 enchiladas with rice and beans was perfect amount for us to not be overly full.   The food was delicious but the server is where it s at. He was so nice and helpful  I wanted to try some of the sauces they offer and he brought many samples without charging me extra. He was also very patient with us as we were trying to make up our mind about whether we want 2 entrees and have leftovers or share an entree.   Def recommend and will be back once I return to Austin 
Chuy's,5,Yes yes yes yes YES  If it s your first time  second time  or HUNDREDTH time in Austin.. you HAVE to try Chuy s for some BOMB Tex-Mex food. Sheesh  they re sooo good and I was very impressed with the service  That southern hospitality is no joke   Shoutout to our front of house server  Rose  and our waiter  Christian. They were absolutely professional and hard working  amp  always smiled as greeting the guests. It was Fourth of July weekend so it was extremely busy  but they kept such calm composure and always addressed our needs. Christian kept checking in on us during our meal  which was awesome  and kept his distance when we seemed like we were busy stuffing our faces  which was even more awesome    haha.  No reservations required here. Just walk in and put your name down. It should take about 15-20 mins to get seated  unless you re a huge group more than 4 . The wait time for a large group seemed to be around 30-45 minutes at the time we went  7PM .  For food  we started off with chips. We HAD to try their queso  amp  guacamole so we got both. And always ask for their creamy jalape o... it s freakin delish  The salsa was a little spicy for my wife so I enjoyed it all to myself. Man... their queso was TO DIE FOR  My wife had the Baja Shrimp Tacos  served with Mexican rice  amp  beans   which was fresh and delicious. I had the Chuychanga  served with rice  beans  and lettuce  tomatoes and sour cream  and your choice of sauce  Christian recommended the boom boom sauce which was excellent   it has a nice kick to it which I loved.  Overall  5 5 from me  I mean  the food was excellent..service was excellent... what more can I ask for  Just try this place. Trust me. You won t regret it  friend.
Chuy's,6,An experience that truly exemplifies what Auston is about. After cooling off in the Baton springs pool around the corner this has to be your next stop. Texas sized food and drink options served in a cozy tex mex diner atmosphere. My waitress  Ashley  was incredibly knowledgeable and provided 10-star service.   My tips    get the Mexican martini and ask for a blackberry margarita sample. Pour the sample in the martini and you have a seriously killer combo.   Ask for the jalape o cream sauce  off menu  to dip chips and pour on your meal 
Chuy's,7,The original Chuy s is a fun  busy atmosphere that s perfect for meeting with family and friends and enjoying a good meal together. My partner swears it s better in Texas then where we re from  but I can neither deny nor confirm as I am not a Chuy s groupie like he is.  What we got   Tres Leches - 5  I will say that the serving size here is A LOT bigger than where I m from. So that was very  very enjoyable.  Beef Burrito as big as your face with an egg on top - 3.5   my partner gives in 5  . It hit the spot and filled us up quite nicely. I really enjoyed trying multiple sauces with it.  Sauces we tried on the side  Ranchero  kid friendly  - was a nice sauce. Red chile  mild  - it does indeed have a smokey flavor like it said it would  Hatch green Chile  spicy  - was yummy  my partners favourite .
Chuy's,8,legit. They have piquin chile salsa  That s awesome  There are only a handful of restaurants in Austin that can brag about having this topping for their tacos. In add  fresh tortillas 
Chuy's,9,Won t return until the full menu is restored
Chuy's,10,Why 4 stars  Because the fajitas were everything I wanted.             My colleagues and I were originally slated to have dinner at Chuy s  but all day long  we all argued in circles about alternative options. Eventually  we came right back to where we started  a date with Chuy s.  Unfortunately  as I feared  when we arrived  we were told that the wait for our large party would be an hour. I wanted to find a place that would take reservations  while Chuy s would not. So we did what you do in Texas  we walked 20 yards to  another  Tex-Mex restaurant. But for some reason  people wanted to only snack on chips and queso   margaritas there  and stick out the hour wait for Chuy s.  To be honest  I preferred the queso and the divey alternative. But the fajitas from Chuy s were absolutely on point. The tortillas were perfect. The meat and all the fixins were great.   I ve been to many different Chuy s and can t recall ever having a poor experience.
Chuy's,11,I placed a to go order in person and paid at the hostess stand. Even though it was crowded  the process was smooth. If you go after an afternoon at  Barton Springs  note that swim suits do not meet the dress code.  Fun ambiance.
Chuy's,12,Chuys ATX is killing it on opening Day of ACL weekend  Seated right away inside  StephVF was on top of her game and slayed it  Fast  friendly and knew the specials and liquor on the shelf  She checked on us and continued to be so pleasant  We were in a hurry and she said they were fully staffed and ready to go  Recommended the tacos and they were fast  She noticed my husband spilt a little queso on his shirt and she showed up with a shout wipe    What amazing service    I highly suggest coming here 
Chuy's,13,A group of us visited Chuys on our last day in Austin. We had the nicest server  She was so patient and positive attending to 9 of us. Our Lyft driver told us their fajitas were delicious and they were  The homemade tortillas were so yummy I could have just ate it by itself. The funky rims on the ceiling just added to the appeal.
Chuy's,14,What can you say about an Austin original   Great food  Great drinks  Great atmosphere   If you re looking for a local place.... You ve arrived. I highly recommend the boom boom anything     I m here tonight for some last minute to go and drinks while we waited   Lidia and Adrian were our bartenders. Great service    It was SLAMMED in here and they still found the time to treat us like we were meaningful   I can go on and on and on. The beat doesn t stop until the break of dawn. But seriously  Great service tonight.  And if you don t know how awesome Chuy s is.... Bless your heart.
Chuy's,15,Chuy s is an Austin standard  and this location is no different. It has plenty of old favorites  and that creamy jalapeno sauce   with hearty portions. The atmosphere is classic. I ve always received top notch service here  too. I could make my entire meal on the chips and salsa  and  of course  the creamy jalapeno sauce   but the food is always worth eating  so don t just do that.
Chuy's,16,Food usually is really good  service is okay  quick and efficient. Only issue was the steak burrito the steak tasted burnt and was very chewy. The enchiladas are fabulous. Spicy marg is spicy would definitely go back just wouldn t get the burrito again
Chuy's,17,Cool ambiance and decor but the food is only ok. The churros were oily  and some undercooked  and the main was just fine. Server also didn t seem to know the menu well  when we asked for recommendations he said soup and salad  reall
Chuy's,18,Chuy s is a fun spot for some good Tex Mex. It has a cool aesthetic  good service and good food. Our server brought out every sauce so i could try it  the service was speedy and it was quite crowded but they got us in and seated quickly. Next time you are in Austin  this is a fun place to eat  grab a beer and a cute tee shirt.
Chuy's,19,I ve been coming to Chuy s for 3 years and I have had a blast every time. No matter the occasion Chuy s environment is always fantastic. As you sit down you are welcomed with their delicious chips and salsa to calm your empty stomach. Fair warning  don t fill up too much  you want to have enough space for your main dish. My personal favorite is their Big as Yo  Face Burritos and as a burrito fanatic can say this is at the top of my list. Hope you can experience the same amount of happiness I got going to Chuy s 
Chuy's,20,Absolutely  this Hass to be the best place to eat in Austin Texas for Tex-Mex food. The food is consistently wonderful  the staff is accommodating to any dietary needs. I have actually lived in Austin for two decades  and I ve eaten here hundreds of times. The price is incredible for what you get.  But what I really appreciate from this restaurant are the incredible flavorful sauces. There s so much of a right variety and they taste so original and gorgeous  but just look through the different pictures that people  customers  have shared about this restaurant  it s absolutely the best looking food  so that goes along with the best tasting as well.
Chuy's,21,After a nightmare experience I ll never go here again. You have Martha s or Curras nearby. Why waste your time on Chuys  Unless you love disappointment I recommend you avoid Chuys at all costs.
Chuy's,22,Overall SUPER GOOD homemade style Tex-Mex food  Our Server Matt was GREAT always refilling our drinks  amp  chips without us having to ask for more. Food came quick as well. Would really recommend to come and try if you have never been here before. Definitely coming back again.
Chuy's,23,Chuychanga with boom-boom sauce is potentially my favorite Tex-Mex dish in town  10 10.   This is the original Chuy s and man  it delivers. I know Chuy s is a chain now  but there s a reason everyone wants one in their town. Every dish  from the chimichanga to the steak enchilada  is nearly impeccable. Even if you like your dish to be smothered in queso  trust me and get the boom-boom sauce instead. Creamy jalepe o is a close second. Their salsa and chips are way above par  and their drinks are big. Ask them to bring out creamy jap with the chips.   You really can t go wrong with anything on the menu - trust me  I ve tried most of it. It does get busy on the weekends and they close around 10pm  so plan accordingly  There are plenty of fun bars on the street to walk over to after dinner.
Chuy's,24,Normally love chuy s but the experience was horrible from the crazy homeless man chasing me around the parking lot to the burnt chuychanga. Even told the food server it looked burnt  Also pushy waiter trying to get me to drink when I m driving and have my 5 month old at the table.
Chuy's,25,There are no Chuy s where I live. So we decided to try it when we were in Austin. Amazing food and customer service. Will definitely go back when I am near one.
Chuy's,26,We were starving while exploring the area  and found Chuy s nearby  We placed an order online for pickup and brought it over to Zilker Park to enjoy.   Got the seasoned ground beef and wasn t expecting it to come in a tray  I was pleasantly surprised that it was a wet burrito. So much flavor  delicious sauce on top  and a large portion. They also gave us a big bag of chips with dip  This meal hit the spot and we wolfed it down quick.   I d recommend ordering to go from Chuy s. It seems they can get pretty busy at times. Zilker Park is about a 10ish minute walk away  and a perfect place to enjoy your meal 
Chuy's,27,The original Tex-Mex chain in Austin  Texas. The food is average but the drinks is what makes the experience. The margaritas are strong and delicious. It took me a second to get used to the Tex-Mex style of food but overall filling and fast service. The table got chips and ranch to start with a side a queso. The service was great and we were able to grab a table outside without a reservation on a Wednesday night although the parking lot was packed. If you re in Austin you have to give Tex-Mex a try.
Chuy's,28,Great atmosphere  cool decor  sweet waitress  delicious mango frozen margaritas  scrumptious creamy jalape o lime dressing for salads or chip dipping  like we did   fresh  amp  light chips  yummy salsa and awesome cheese enchiladas  Definitely worth the trip 
Chuy's,29,I love coming to chuys it is one of my favorite restaurants in Austin  its sauce with the chips fascinates me it has a very good flavor and the steak burrito is my favorite the sauce that goes on top is delicious it is spicy but it is delicious
Chuy's,30,This place got house roaches we ain t even finished our margarita yet too. Oh heck nah. The waiter was rude and told us to hold on when it started crawling on the table. He was just rude as heck in general
Chuy's,31,3 5 stars IMO  went on a busy Friday night  put our name down at 7pm  got seated around 8pm. Ordered lemonade  combo fajitas with tomatillo sauce and quesadillas. The fajitas came out dry and sliced too thin. I was surprised by this big time. Also  the rice was either old or dry even when combined with beans. Best part of the meal was the tomatillo sauce  which came out warm. Great location  but definitely not worth the wait for the quality tonight.
Chuy's,32,No matter how bad a day I m having  I can always count on the frozen strawberry marg to consistently cheer me up. Just like my boss can consistently count on me to miss my quota. I hope I don t get fired  LOL
Chuy's,33,We had a fab time on Tuesday the 40th Anniversary of Chuy s  We had rocks margaritas outside w our shorkie to toast Chuy s and our chihuahua Chuy who stayed behind at Airbnb cuz he is elderly. There were frat boys and senior citizens all celebrating together on a beautiful cool sunset on Barton Springs  Thanks Chuy s for the buzz as we walked Ringo at Zilker Park  The bartender and hosts were so courteous and happy  We love happy people 
Chuy's,34,This is a super solid casual food option  We got takeout for dinner on a Sunday evening. The portions were very sizable - large enough for a heavy meal for one. The boom chika special sauce was the favorite among everyone. We loved the queso on the burrito too.
Chuy's,35,Solid Tex Mex place  Man the Texas queso was very solid. The fajitas were MASSIVE and honestly a serving size of one was enough for two people. It gets very busy but I would just order takeout and go to Zilker   
Chuy's,36,If you want the best food pairing in Austin  chuy changa and a Mexican martini. Enough said
Chuy's,37,Cannot say I cared for this location at all. There was a loud  rowdy  annoying group of 12 girls or something that weren t dealt with. Whatever  at least the girls had fun at everyone s expense. But  that s not an important issue.  My waitress was rushing us so much... hardly any time went by from sitting  to getting asked for drinks  I could not find soft drinks at all   then the person I was with went to the restroom  sat down  and was asked if she knew her order. At least she s coming by often. We look at the menu for less than a minute  get asked for our order  tell her to wait  then finally we re ready to order and she comes by and takes the order.  I thought maybe she d be attentive  but no.. our empty salsa was not refilled  we are both spice lovers so we can go through salsa quickly   and neither was our water refilled  so I ended up giving her my water. The water ended up being refilled when we were about to leave  but basically she only cared to give us the food and give us the bill with not much else happening.  Service aside  there were other problems I had too... the menu seemed way worse than I remember at this location  Didn t matter because they had Boom Boom and I know I like that  but the rest of the menu offerings seemed more boring than I remembered.  When I got my enchiladas  they were really hard to cut through  they were somehow hard and chewy  the rice was hard  the beans were dry. It was a total 360 from my first Chuy s experience that left me craving to return. At least the Boom Boom sauce was fantastic.  It was like the enchiladas were fully prepped yesterday and then put in the fridge. Had I not known what good Chuy s was like  I wouldn t have been as upset.
Chuy's,38,Homemade tortillas    Chose this place randomly  and they did not disappoint    We love our server Allie. She was so nice and friendly  Even though it was so busy she still made time to check in on us.  The food was just as amazing  We ordered the combo fajita and she recommended the 10 additional shrimp for 2 something.  We ordered a margarita and martini from happy hour   Fun server  amp  fun vibe  you won t regret it  
Chuy's,39,We were in Austin for the afternoon and saw on yelp that this location had wonderful reviews. I honestly don t know how. The only thing that tasted good was the chips. The food was terrible. We all got sick later that night. The men s restroom was absolutely disgusting. The toilet was overflowed and standing water on the ground.
Chuy's,40,We landed and got all checked into the Westin and ordered a million dollars of Tex mex from Chuys. Everything was delicious. Could have been warmer but I m not complaining  Can t get anything close too this in the NE.
Chuy's,41,I ve been to several Chuy s around the State but this one was a bit different  It was more of a historic site. As far as the building it looked liked it been there for quite a while. It still Delivered the same great taste as the others.   Our waitress whose name I believe was  J  was on point and tended to our needs like it should be. She was friendly and knowledgeable. I had the new pineapple and jalape o Margarita and it was pretty good. Of coarse you can t dine without there creamy jalape o sauce...
Chuy's,42,As simple as this sounds -- drinks  chips  jalape o dip  and a fun time    The only things I would keep in mind is that parking is scarce and typically has a decent wait time. It s worth it though 
Chuy's,43,We decided last minute to try the original location as we were heading to a  different restaurant.  Our server  Sunny was very pleasant and did a great job of up selling.  We were there to celebrate my Husband s birthday right before we had to return to Houston.  Both of our orders were completely wrong which meant we had to waiting longer than expected making us late for our next engagement. Although our server did everything to remedy the issue  management failed to visit our table.  And to make matters worse  we had to take our food to go because of our time constraints.  Overall  this was not a good experience.
Chuy's,44,We ve been coming here a long time. Probably shouldn t have come on a Sunday afternoon in the summer. Hostess sat us at a table with no assigned server. We finally flagged someone down and we re able to place an order. 30 minutes later  we were ready to walk out. Jen  the manager noticed my side eye and frustration and took extremely good care of us from there on out. I will go back because Jen was so awesome 
Chuy's,45,Placed a delivery order this evening - salad  quesadilla  queso  creamy jalape o  and salas - guess what goes with the last 3....CHIPS  And....we got ZERO chips   I called to speak to the manager to explain the situation these are the comments I received 1   ma am I m sorry they ve done a really good job tonight getting chips with all of the togo orders  WRONG because I didn t get any with mine 2   ma am would you like me to send you a comp card  UH NO that does nothing for me and the fact that I have 3 items I need chips to eat 3   ma am what is it you would like me to do for you  REFUND ME MY MONEY   
Chuy's,46,The wait at Matt s was over an hour so we tried an old school fave  Chuy s instead. Glad we did. No wait at 6 pm on Friday. Excellent chips  salsa  and jalapeno ranch dressing  without even having to ask for the ranch  comes out fast. Compuesto queso was good but darker and not as creamy yellow as I remember. The Mexi Cobb salad was excellent for around  10  why doesn t every tex mex place have this chicken fajita salad as an option . The flour tortillas are fresh  thick  and yummy...almost more like pita bread but delicious. Alan was excellent waiter  The menu options have been been greatly reduced for covid soncheck it out before you go to make sure you can get what you want
Chuy's,47,Great place to have tex-mex. I think the atmosphere looks a little dirty but foods were good.
Chuy's,48,Happy hour is a must   Not enough vegetarian options for myself but the queso was good and that jalape o ranch is bomb  I will visit again for happy hour because those margaritas will take you there ya hear me  
Chuy's,49,I don t know who is in charge of making the large batch of frozen margaritas but you guys have me weak
Chuy's,50,Salsa is spicy and fresh. Staff is attentive and helpful. I ordered veg chuychanga and it is very nice. I tried the Boom Boom signature sauce with chuychanga and I highly recommend this sauce. I am curious to know which oil these guys use to deep fry the chuychanga.  Overall   this place is amazing and I highly recommend visiting here.
Chuy's,51,First time here food was amazing  atmosphere was chill and service was good too. Just wish they weren t so expensive  especially for a couple on fixed budget...
Chuy's,52,They never forget to offer free chips - even for takeout orders  Definitely recommend this restaurant.
Chuy's,53,This place needs to close down  rude service  mediocre food  the only thing it has going for it is the location. I cannot tell you how bad the service is.There are better places in town for food. Adrien the bartender was the only shining spot and yet even he was flat.
Chuy's,54,I have not been to chuys since before the pandemic. But I did order curbside. However  this was in restaurant.  Now our waitress was a little special and we had to ask her for additional items. She did not offer the Chuys jalape o salsa which is amazing. No picture because I thought it had been discontinued as it had not been brought back to the table. The Chuys brew is amazing and I wonder why I had never had it before. There are two options for the beer  Corona and Dos Equis   go with the Dos. One suggestion to Chuys  the frozen margarita part needs to be more. At the moment the ratio is off. For my main meal  I was too stuffed with chips and salsa and so I went with the panchos. They were great and yummy and I did not finish them. 2 people could share them.
Chuy's,55,THE TORTILLAS  The flour Tortillas are so good they will solve all the world s problems  Besides the following  All the world s problems  the appetizer chips are good  the lemonade is superb  and it s great for hangouts or meet-ups. I do suggest going outside when you eat if you have children under 8  although the insides good too. HOWEVER some food is painfully average like the cheeseburgers.   Also i ve heard the Enchiladas are good 
Chuy's,56,food is good but there was a fucking bone in my food and i almost died eating my food      
Chuy's,57,Ok  this place was fantastic.. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. They have the coldest beers that I have ever had in Austin. It was packed but the food came out in a timely manner and they are able to turn tables in a reasonable time. Cost wise this place is in the middle of the road  which for the location seemed very fair. I will be back to this place again.
Chuy's,58,I can t recommend this place. It took us 25 minutes to get seated and it simply wasn t worth the wait. The food was way too salty  I had a chimichanga  and our server barely ever came around. Go somewhere else.
Chuy's,59,Good food at a great price. We were amazed by the large portions and delicious food.  Our server was terrific  and was always checking in to pour water or to replenish chips.   I enjoyed the variety of choices on the menu and all the vegetarian options.   The Guacamole was 2 full avocados and tasted great.   What a fun atmosphere  with tributes to Elvis and 50 s cars.
Chuy's,60,Honestly  you can never go wrong with Chuy s. The service is a hit or a miss depending on when and where you go  but the food is always delicious. I almost always crave either Chuy s or this other Korean restaurant in Austin.   We ve been here for margarita HH a few times  and for the price  the drinks are actually pretty good  I always order the chicken enchiladas with creamy jalape o sauce as the replacement sauce  you need to ask them specifically to do this because it s not one of the sauces they have on their menu  and ask for corn to be inside the enchiladas. My friend and I are obsessed with their creamy jalape o sauce with nachos. The chips are also really good--they re lighter and crispier but if you come on an off-day  they can be a bit stale.   Recently  this location tried to charge me an extra  9 for creamy jalape o sauce through GrubHub. Their managers were asked to crack down on people who ask for it  but that s pretty ridiculous. It s always been a free sauce when I ve asked for it in the restaurant  so I had to call them a few times and ask why exactly the charge had been placed. The issue was solved  and I would come back to Chuy s regardless of the incident. The food is so comforting.
Chuy's,61,Folks  if you re looking for authentic  amp  quality Tex Mex food....you ve arrived at the wrong place.    Positives first  always   really friendly service from our server Savannah.  that s where the good review stops unfortunately. For this part of the review  4 stars.   Now for the constructive feedback   incredibly generic  amp  packaged food  everything is over-salted but tasteless.  I don t think anything is actually made fresh at Chuy s.  We ordered cheese enchiladas  amp  a bean cheese burrito....nothing could be simpler  right   It took 45 mins to get our meal  it wasn t crowded . The beans and rice both had a skin on then when it arrived  I m assuming from 15 minutes under a heat lamp. You  had to use a knife to cut through the enchilada it was so over cooked. Rice was dry  crispy  tasteless.  The beans were inedible. I ate only a small part of the meal despite being really hungry.  Food Review  1 star.   Overall  what a total bummer that a Tex Mex restaurant IN TEXAS wouldn t offer better food. Especially given the great location on Barton Springs. We d be there every week if so. But alas  it s our first last time eating there.    Be warned fellow Austinites  unless you ve lost your sense of taste and smell  almost any other restaurant is a better meal.
Chuy's,62,Drinks are always solid here. To-go was easy and we were happy with our queso and boom-boom enchiladas. Chuys honestly is always a solid choice...Once COVID is over  someday  goodness  Im back down for the happy hour sauce bar and the spicy jalape o margs  I happen to be a fan of the drinks over the food generally but the to-go martini was more ice than drink sooo that was a bit sad for the 20ounce option.
Chuy's,63,Great food great service when they aren t busy   nice environment great choice Chicka Chicka Boom Boom
Chuy's,64,Outstanding service in a great location  We arrived during their happy hour and enjoyed margaritas and appetizers. Great value and accommodating for toddlers. Our room in the restaurant had a unique classic car theme and our server was nice and very attentive. Quesadillas were okay  and the salsa and queso was great 
Chuy's,65,I rarely order food out and doordashed a bean  amp  cheese burrito while feeling sick. I ve noticed that with DD orders with a lot of places there less effort put in. But this was delicious and still hot at arrival. I ve always loved Chuys but now I know they ll be my go to spot for this treat.
Chuy's,66,went again yesterday  the cheese enchiladas with red chile sauce were delicious.   But it is not the Chuy s of old and the new menu reflects it.  Victim of corona I guess.  They had the best Chile Rellenos in town and no more.....really too bad.  I was there an hour after lunch time at the first location they had it was empty.  Never saw that before.
Chuy's,67,Chuy s is more of a mood than a food. Sure  it has good tasting tex-mex food and a good number of options at reasonable prices. But just going to Chuy s is more fun than eating there. It s a tradition that you must honor if you live in Austin  and even if tex-mex isn t your thing  you ll be hard pressed to find better tex mex at this price and with this vibe anywhere else in Austin.  Definitely try the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom and Chuychanga  as well as the fajitas  and don t forget to choose from their list of sauces for any dish you order. And ask for creamy jalape o when you get your chips  it s a must-get item.
Chuy's,68,Chuy s has been a take out staple during the pandemic. Everyone in the fam has their fave and we never deviate. Good TexMex at a decent price. Great margaritas.
Chuy's,69,Yay their nachos supreme is once again available for takeout and honestly  it s a meal for 2  It s delicious  and something I missed much during the pandemic shutdown  limited menu. They offer curbside pickup but then have to run in to run your card... I wish it was truly contactless payment.
Chuy's,70,DO NOT ORDER TAKE OUT  I think if I had gone in and hovered  instead of using their totally broken text in and wait person system   it might have been ok  but take out has been a total disaster the last two times. So if you are doing take out  walk in immediately and do not use call in system.  Last two orders  In March they forgot to give us the margarita and it wasn t noticed until it got back to the house and the drinker asked for it.  Yesterday after ordering and arriving  I texted at check in. About ten minutes later a staff person came by and asked us for name order. I waited a while longer and tried calling in. Got put on hold and then several minutes later it hung up on me.   Went physically in and waited and they brought the food to me at the front. When we got back to the house ten minutes later it was clear the food had sat under a warmer for the whole time  there for 35  minutes  checked text time stamp  we were there. Was SICK first thing this morning.   Wait staff was absently apologetic yesterday when I went in to get food but  man  I ve been waitstaff and  never  would have responded without some kind of sincerity to someone waiting over 30 minutes for take out which was supposed to be ready on arrival. They should have comped something on the spot.  I used to eat there constantly growing up so it s really my comfort food. Sucks that it s not available when you re trying to avoid covid delta.   But I m sure I ll be back when things are more normal.
Chuy's,71,Come on man  This is THE Chuy s    It s as Austin as the Bats  You have to know this place   So this isn t my first rodeo here and nor will it be my last. The Happy Hour Nacho Car is always a signature Chuy move and I love it   I always sit at the bar  order a grande house marg  salted rum for sure   and chow on the chips with Jalape o cream sauce.  I must mention Hatch Chile season is here and Chuy s elevates off the charts  Get a New Mexican Martini you will not be disappointed.  Do I get the food  Sometimes. Is it good  I did say I come here a lot so yes to infinity and beyond 
Chuy's,72,Love the casual vibe and the yummy food. The drinks are not bad either. Definitely come here once a month for my Tex-mex fix 
Chuy's,73,As a girl who LOVES authentic Mexican food  I usually don t like chain tex-Mex places but Chuy s has NEVER disappointed    I absolutely love their quesadillas and appetizer plate  you get a little bit of everything and it ends up being filling enough to take home leftovers and make two meals out of it   I love their chicken flautas and quesadillas  their chicken is always very tender and juicy  never dry  Everything has great seasoning and I love that their tortillas taste wayyy more homemade than most chain Mexican restaurants.  Their queso and salsa are unique in the way that the queso has a bit of a chili flavor and the salsa is quite chunky but they re both very delicious. No  this isn t quite your homemade Mexican comfort food but it s some of the best Tex-Mex that you d never expect for a chain   I highly recommend 
Chuy's,74,I like to get the kids quesadilla and dip it in creamy jalape o and I m 23 but it s fine they still let me order off the kids menu  paired nicely with a Texas Tini  which truly accentuates all of the cheesy flavors and delish tortilla  Delish delish delish
Chuy's,75,The Chucky Cheeses of Frozen Margs.   This place is special.  The simple  yet disarming decorations really make for a calming place to enjoy strong frozen margs. Great service and fair prices. Attracts a younger crowd that longs for youthful nostalgia.
Chuy's,76,Great Texas Tini  not the best food in my opinion. I never get why people love this place- I think it s for their ranch dip lol I dunno  if I want Tex Mex at its worst and most chainy  I prefer trudys     but we had great service so that s always a plus and extra star 
Chuy's,77,Had great food here. Allie was great giving us suggestions while choosing food. Friendly staff. Fresh food. Large portions. Value for money. Outdoor seating.
Chuy's,78,A must in Austin.   Chuy s is simply delicious Tex mex. They use the perfect amount of spice that just happens to be completely cured with one of their frozen margs. Most recently I tried their seasonal blackberry marg cut with the original lime. They should just go ahead and serve that the time. It was delicious and exactly what I didn t know I needed.   Oh and if given the option  ALWAYS get the Boom Boom sauce.
Chuy's,79,Food is consistently good as are drinks. Really  I m writing to give our server  Cody  a shout out. He was very attentive. He anticipated our needs and was able to time the queso  the drinks and the meals perfectly. I would come back again just for the service 
Chuy's,80,I have lived in Texas for a while and I have never been to Chuy s. Man am I glad that changed.  I came with a large group but they wouldn t let us sit down until our whole group was there. The service was really great  I think my water cup we refilled at least 5 times - that is attentive service   The chips and salsa tasted really good  the chips so crisp and homemade. I got the tacos al carbon with chicken and I switched the flour tortillas to corn. The taco weren t super authentic but definitely hit the spot. The beans were nicely flavored and the rice was a bit salty but overall went well with the taco.
Chuy's,81,Dan Dan he s our man if he can t do it no one can     Literally the best ever   We wish he could be there everyday but we love to see him when we can   He is at the bar and he moves like lightening  
Chuy's,82,The manager is a terrible woman. She s a racist white ignorant person. The waiter at our table threw a pen I left at the table in the trash and made me dig it it out the trash can to get it back. He didn t offer gloves or any sanitizer. Disgusting restaurant. The food was undercooked and I also felt sick after eating the fajitas.
Chuy's,83,Door dashed from this spot while visiting my sister-in-law in Austin. I got the chuychanga with queso which was fried to perfection and the sauce came on the side which was perfect so that the food didn t arrive soggy. The pico was super spicy but the refried beans - usually something I barely touch - were delicious  especially with the sour cream sauce they sent with the meal. They were quick  delicious. And I would recommend them again.
Chuy's,84,Visiting from San Diego and we had to try tex mex. This place didn t disappoint. Great prices for huge dishes. Fair warning  their green chile can be spicy so everything on our dish was super spicy  and we handle spice well . Regardless  it was so delicious  We had their Lay s chip breaded chicken with green chile and a steak burrito  with their green chile rice and charro beans. If we happen to run out of food joints while we re here  we wouldn t mind coming back 
Chuy's,85,I was looking for tex mex while I was in town and this place was recommended to me. My friend and I stopped in here on our way to the Barton Springs pool. We got here a little before they opened but just waited until they were ready for us. We started off with the queso compuesto  which has steak  guac and pico in it. This was pretty tasty  I ve never had queso with stuff in it so this was cool. I love cheese in all forms. I also had a marg. For the main event I went with the steak burrito listed under their house specialties. It was good and filling  plenty of steak  sauce  cheese. I kind of wish I d gotten sour cream and guac to add some freshness to it  but overall  it was still good as is. Washed it down with a michelob ultra. It scratched a Tex mex itch  I d go again if I was in the area.
Chuy's,86,This place was recommended by a friend to try when we came to visit Austin. Showed up on a Friday night during dinner time. Wait was said to be an hour but I knew it wouldn t be that long since people wouldn t be willing to wait. We got sat in 25 min. Location is filled with UT students and young staff but service was good and fast.   I ordered the avocado green enchiladas. My wife wasn t hungry so we shared. Chips and salsa are free and delicious which is a nice perk. Coming from CA  my standards for Mexican food are pretty high but for being a chain restaurant  Chuys holds up.
Chuy's,87,Came here on a Saturday night and the place was PACKED. We were told the wait for two was about 30-45 minutes  put our name on the list  and hovered by the bar hoping some bar stools might open up. Luckily  we found out that the tables up front were available for drinks and appetizers  and a nice local told us they also serve tacos a la carte so we swooped up an empty one.   Even though the place was swamped  our waiter was very nice and although he didn t come around too often  once we got an order in  everything came out pretty fast.  I started with a strawberry Rita on the rocks and my bf had the frozen blackberry. Both were pretty good and I liked that they weren t overly sweet. They we shared the appetizer platter. The queso was yummy but pretty spicy and everything else was pretty good too.   They have a chip bar in the back with chips  salsa and hot sauce. I ve never had salsa liked this before - it was almost minced and kind of a paste  but it was delicious  Be warned it s very hot though.   The place is definitely fun and hip  with lots of cute decor everywhere. But it does get pretty busy so try to come early.
Chuy's,88,July - 2019  The food was delicious   There was no wait for a table.  The atmosphere is super cool and very different.  Our waitress was really nice.  This was recommended to us by the woman at our hotel.
Chuy's,89,This was our first time dining at Chuy s. We evacuated to Austin from New Orleans to escape Hurricane Ida and we weren t sure what to expect. We loved the retro vibe of the decor and the food was delicious and fresh. The portions were HUGE as well. Our waiter was very friendly and kind. When we told him it was our first time he asked where we were from and found out we were there to escape the hurricane. We were having a great time and experience and when the meal was finished  we were told our meal had been comped thanks to our waiter and the manager. We felt so appreciative and had such an emotional experience we HIGHLY recommend this place. So glad we stopped in here. Thanks to everyone there for making us feel at home  
Chuy's,90,Pretty bad Tex-Mex especially coming from CA. I would have rather gone to Taco Bell honestly. I don t understand how it was busy  assuming people only go for the drinks. Food was bland. Also  if you re getting three tacos they all have to be the same meat or you are charged extra which our waitress did not tell us.
Chuy's,91,Easy access  challenging parking  seated quickly  helpful staff  quick service  good food  good portions  but guac no longer comes with many dishes  and slightly high prices.
Chuy's,92,HORRIBLE management. We waited outside for 40 minutes in 100 degree heat  for a two top. We had to wait another 30 minutes for ANYONE to come up to our table. My husband and I both pleaded with the hosts to send someone  and finally our server came  notifying the table next to us that he had two open sections and was trying his best to serve all the tables throughout the restaurant. Meanwhile  I see the managers calmly entering  amp  exiting the office  not giving a second glance to the chaos ensuing as people flood the restaurant waiting for a table because it s too hot outside. SHAME ON YOU  MANAGERS    If you can t run a restaurant properly  don t. Be honest with yourself. I was a server for a few years and we would get chastised if we servers didn t attend a table within THIRTY SECONDS. Hire new  non-lazy management please. This is such an iconic Austin restaurant.  Management  like this will destroy it. i m
Chuy's,93,One of the Go-to spots in Austin. Great food and usually fun atmosphere. Easy to enjoy yourself as the prices are right and there s something for everyone.
Chuy's,94,Chuy s. A classic. I want to love it yet I can t commit completely.   It s always crazy busy and crowded and loud. They do their best to serve well  most of the time . Definitely don t come for a quiet or intimate meal  but a laid back and more eccentric vibe is what you can find here.   Great drinks. Real great drinks. I love their Swirl  frozen strawberry and lime margarita  and my parents love their texas martini and classic top shelf marg on the rocks.   Chips are great too. Free flow of chips and salsa and the legendary creamy jalape o. And great food  chicka boom boom enchiladas are my go-to  as well  MOST of the time. But that s the issue. There have been a few times out of the many that have kind of ruined chuy s for me. One of the times being when I ordered chicken fajita tacos--their fajitas being one of my regular favorites--and the chicken was rubber. Like hard  grisly  rubber. The texture was completely awful and I wanted to throw up. And I have no idea if there is any association  but I got ill the following evening and threw up a bunch. Could be totally unrelated but I also don t know. Either way  that chicken was disgusting and definitely very low quality meat.   So since that very unfortunate experience  I have sadly been unable to return to chuy s. I think if the food quality and consistency improved  I may come back. But it is just so inconsistent that you never know if you ll get your money s worth or just waste a bunch of calories. Maybe just come for drinks and chips.
Chuy's,95,Our first intial thought was that it didn t seem very clean looking. Our server didn t seem very helpful either. We had to keep asking for things  Like tortillas which he didn t even tell us were available till we were almost finished with dinner. We ordered margaritas which were poorly made and had so much ice in them I thought it was a rip off  I ordered the chicken cobb salad it looked good until I got to the middle and the lettuce looked bad..old and brown  My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were cold  The portions overall were very small for the price. Will not be coming back that s for sure.
Chuy's,96,Came to this location on a Saturday evening so expected a long wait for seating and food service. I was pleasantly surprised.   Hostess was very straight forward about the wait time and only ended up waiting 10 minutes in the waiting area that had a full bar. Very convenient    After being seated  our waitress was clearly swamped but she approached us pretty quickly letting us know she had two tasks to do then will come right to us. Appreciated the updates as it got insanely busy as soon as we sat down. Didn t have to wait too long for our food  nothing was forgotten  and chips and salsa were refilled without asking.   I had the boom boom chicken enchiladas that were very tasty and a couple margaritas. Nothing to die for taste wise but still delicious nonetheless  You get what you pay for.   Overall  5 out of 5  Parking was the only thing that was somewhat stressful but can t expect easy parking for a location on Barton Springs near Zilker.
Chuy's,97,AMAZING Tex-Mex  The entrees are reasonably priced and very filling  I liked everything I ordered and would highly recommend it all  We ordered the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom Enchilada  the Stuffed Avocado  Thursday special   and The Elvis Presley Memorial Combo. All of the dishes have a little kick to them  but wasn t overly spicy. Also  they all came with rice and beans. The portions are huge and each entree is around  10    For a drink I got the Strawberry Mojito and I thought it was pretty good. There is a lot of ice in it  but I would get this again.   I got here on a Thursday night around 7 45 and waited about 35 minutes for a table for 2. It was pretty crowded but you can eat some chips and salsa while you wait. The restaurant is always packed and extremely loud. All of the tables are very close together and you have to maneuver your way around the restaurant. Since it s so busy  the service isn t the best but everyone working there is very friendly.
Chuy's,98,Chuy s is more of a tourist trap than I thought it would be. The service is great and everybody is friendly  but the food is pretty average. Seems like a run of the mill Tex-mex place  and I wish I went to a real Tex mex place instead. However  the portions are big and you won t leave hungry  and the atmosphere is fun. They serve salsa and chips as a complimentary appetizer  we ordered the enchiladas and a combo. I have to say I loved the refried beans  but the taco and enchilada and chalupa were pretty basic and nothing special.
Chuy's,99,Food and drinks were both awesome. Reasonable prices too. We had the fajitas which were great  and the portions are pretty generous so sharing is an option. The strawberry frozen margs tasted great  so I d definitely recommend those if you re looking for a drink on a hot day. Wait wasn t too bad and the staff was friendly with great service.
Chuy's,100,Decent pricing for large portions and all the chips and salsa you can eat. Yup  definitely a winner to me   Enchiladas  tacos  rice  beans make up the typical entree and it really is a perfect match  As usual  I ate way too many chips while waiting to be seated  you can eat chips in the bar waiting area  and ended up not finishing. Also got the pina colada which was refreshing.  Already looking forward to going back in the future 
Chuy's,101,I love Chuy s  My first Chuy s experience was somewhere in Dallas but this is the original location and the one I ve been to the most.   Their hatch queso con carne is a MUST. It s just so freaking good and my favorite thing on the whole menu. I also love their enchiladas and really anything drenched in their special sauce  the name is escaping me at the moment .   The margaritas are great and so are any desserts. Really everything here is good. It s got a casual ambiance that s a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. One of my favorite stops whenever I m in Texas 
Chuy's,102,Margs are on point     The atmosphere is amazing  I love the vibes I love how it is right around some great local spots and close to Barton Springs I will be back again and again and again and again  This place has made some great conversational pieces and fun times.
Chuy's,103,Such great classic Mexican food. Ordered from Doordash during covid. Flavor was excellent  portion size was huge.
Chuy's,104,One word  QUESO    So freakin  good. Chipotle queso ain t got nothin  on this place. Legit ass tex mex.   WARNING  You may be full before your order even comes from the bomb tortilla chips and salsa. Honestly  the best tortilla chips I ve ever had in my life. Light  thin  warm  and crip  what more do you need in life   I ordered the special of the day  Sunday  which was the Chicken Enchiladas. Comes with 2 so I got 1 chicken and 1 steak. They are happy to customize your oder without charging you extra which is a win-win since I got to try both meats for the price of one. I prefer the steak over the chicken but overall  left a very fully  very happy camper with leftovers for tomorrow.  PARKING  Tons of parking in the back and another lot adjacent to the restaurant so it s super convenient.   ONLY CON  Service was a little slow  waiter forgot to refill our chips twice and messed up on my friends order. Given it was 5 30pm on a Sunday  I guess it s understandable. Seems they could staff up during that time to cover rush hour though...
Chuy's,105,I so wanna love this place but the chicken has no flavor. Taste like boiled chicken in a tortilla with no spice or flavor. I also got the steak burrito every bite was fatty steak with extra large tortilla that was soggy. There menu right now is very limited with the pick of boiled chicken with no flavor or fatty steak. I also got take home large tortilla soup for my lunch the next day and the to go container wasn t even filled up. Very disappointing.
Chuy's,106,Great food and fantastic service. Reasonably priced and quick  will definitely go back if I am in Austin again.
Chuy's,107,We had a very bad experience This was the worst service .The food was was horrible. We got fajitas for two.No flavor or seasoning  The shrimp was raw. The tortillas were raw we asked our server to warm them up they bring them hanging out the container the burritos were not edible they kept falling apart from being raw .The beef fajitas had so much fat. The server dropped 3 shrimps on the table he saw and shrugged it off he expected us to pick it up and eat it off the table. The bartender who was our server as well noticed and didn t apologize. They brought us more shrimp under cooked.  70 wasted we would not recommend  
Chuy's,108,While I m super happy chuy s has been open through COVID I m extremely disappointed in our last meal. Not only was the queso cold and a couple side items that we paid extra for were missing there was a chicken bone in my flauta. This really freaked me out  I get that it happens but like come on y all  that s really gross
Chuy's,109,Chuy s Chuy s Chuy s. O M G.  The best Mexican I have had in Texas so far.  The tortillas are probably my favorite thing after the jalape o cream. Wow. So freaking good. The tortillas are something that I have never tasted before. Soft and so tasty and CLEARLY you could taste that they are hand made at the moment.  The pinto beans were also super good with the chicken fajitas and the guacamole    I wish I could have eaten inside the restaurant  but due to the situation  we ordered for pick up. However  it was still delicious     Thank you Chuy s. I ll be back as soon as I get the chance 
Chuy's,110,As I understand it  this was the original that spawned the nationwide chain of kitschy Tex-Mex restaurants with an Elvis core.  This one s a funky old place that felt like a large Tex-Mex diner.  The main dining room has low ceilings and lots of booths  while the bar-side dining areas have high ceilings and lots of tables.  Throughout the restaurant are lots of bright  interesting art  as well as the standard bright Chuy s paint job on the walls  and maybe ceilings    it s kitschy  but even with the outside done the same way  it s not overdone and instead just exudes fun.  The staff is welcoming  friendly  and very efficient.  There s a decent amount of parking wrapping around the restaurant.  The flavors in all the dishes that I tried were very good  and there was excellent spice-heat where there should be  especially in the excellent salsa  which at most other Chuy s is much more mild .  The menu is a decent size and contains most of the standard Tex-Mex staples  although it seemed to be focused on enchiladas  tacos  and burritos.  I had a Patron pineapple margarita to drink  which was excellent  and they have a good mix of flavors and styles to all their margaritas and other drinks.   At least of the boozy drinks.  I think there was a much smaller selection of non-alcoholic drinks  which included more of the usual fare. 
Chuy's,111,Green chili fest  so you must go to chuy s.  We go during happy hour because we like the nacho trunk  we get a small amount of queso from it which is the perfect amount for us.  Great service   The green chili rice is consistently good no matter which chuy s you go to.  I like the layout of this location  doesn t feel as closed it. Highly recommend  especially during green chili fest 
Chuy's,112,If i could give 0 stars I would. I ve been coming to this location since I was a small child and boy let me tell you this place has really fallen off. It s been a while since i ve been to a restaurant where being brain dead is hiring material. Not only do the hosts not understand how to walk on the correct side of the walkway. They don t understand what it means when you call corner before rounding the corner. Unfortunately this was the best part of our experience as it took until the VERY end of our meal for us to get water and napkins. When we finally received the napkins they were rudely and purposely placed in our basket of chips.. Our server refused to ask us if there was anything she could do for us. Every order that was put in we had to either ask someone else for it or flag her down. Mean while there was an all white family seated next to us who had gotten there after us who was getting great service and not only immediately got water but a water pitcher was repeatedly brought to fill up their water while that was not the case with us. I politely asked for a manager to verbalize these complaints and she insisted that our server probably just had  tunnel vision  and that s why we got shit service. She then insisted on giving me a gift card because  when someone comes in with that kind of gift card a manager will be notified and can touch the table   So from my understanding you will only get acceptable service if you have gotten shit service in the past. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. Really really disappointed to see a once beloved austin spot has turn to shit.
Chuy's,113,Great food   Fun place to eat  prices were very reasonable  the fajitas for 2 fed 3 of us
Chuy's,114,During the COVID lockdown I ordered delivery from Chuy s at least twice a week. Delivery was a bit hit or miss and I blame that on the delivery service. Yet I had so much of it that it has now been a solid week without since some of my closer local places have reopened.  My first review was over 10 years ago  and it still stands.
Chuy's,115,Ordered the online pick up at Chuy s on Barton Springs. Due to the COVID-19 the dining room was still closed even though state of Texas allowed opening with partial occupancy last week. When I picked up the food  which was ordered ahead of time it was not ready for 5 to 10 minutes after the pick up time. We ordered the margarita on the rocks kit and when I asked for ICE to go with it was told that they could not give ICE because that would promote drunk driving or open containers  So I guess it s the ice and not the alcohol that s the culprit   We picked up our food for a picnic and when we got to our spot we discovered there were no utensils or napkins included in the bag. It s awfully hard to eat a wet burrito or an enchilada using a tortilla chip as a fork and knife. The food was good but the service on their to go pick up was lacking.  They have been offering this service for a month so they should have figured it out by now 
Chuy's,116,GREEN CHILE CHICKEN ENCHILADAS ALL THE WAY. It s SAUCY. Supposed to be spicy but as a person who can handle more than the average amount of spice  I give the spice level a 3 10. It comes with refried beans and rice. I could only eat one after I ate some chips and queso. Happy to take a delicious saucy boi home with me for later though. Rice was great  so were the beans. Everything about this dish is just pure bliss.   The queso was real good  I got the queso with the beef and avocado in it. The CHIPS THOUGH  that stuff needs to be changed. They re so thin  your chip breaking in queso and leaving you to dig for it ratio is about 1 1   The tacos al carbon were what my boyfriend got and they seemed just average. Not as saucy as my plate for sure. But we poured some queso into the tacos and they tasted great  The chicken isn t as good as the steak  and the steak is a bit chewy. That s why they call it Chuy s I guess    But really though. Get the green chicken enchiladas. I m fat n happy.
Chuy's,117,On our last dinner in Austin  we decided on dining here since we ve heard such great things about it  The wait was long when we first checked in but they have a full service bar so we decided to do that. My bf and I already had a light dinner before this so we decided to share the Elvis Presley Combo and the Chicken Tortilla Soup.  The Elvis Presley Enchilada combo comes with 3 types of enchiladas  beef  chicken and cheese  along with beans  rice  2 tostadas dipped in queso and a hard shelled taco. It was more than enough food for the both of us. I personally liked the beef enchilada the most out of the 3. Their beans and rice were really good. And the crunchy taco was good as well. I d get this dish again if I were to come back again.  The Chicken Tortilla Soup came out lukewarm so we asked them to heat it up again but it was still not hot enough the second time around. We just accepted it since we were pretty much done eating by the time they brought it back to us.  All in all  pretty good Tex Mex joint with huge portions. Make sure you bring your appetite 
Chuy's,118,Amazing    We wanted a good Mexican restaurant to visit while in town. When we were taking a tour  and this place was mentioned as a  must visit . And let me tell you  it IS a must visit for sure. The food was amazing  see pics . If you advise it is your first visit they will supply you with complementary chipotle ranch dip for the nachos - AMAZING. The wait staff was also on point. No complaints. Will definitely visit again  
Chuy's,119,Every time I m in ATX  I try to eat here at least once.   There is just an unparalleled funky and fun vibe that this place has that makes my food just that more enjoyable.   Chuy s is a chain  but I think that this location really does the restaurant brand justice. The portions are big  the flavors are bold  and it is really what I envision Tex-Mex food to be. I usually order some tacos - chicken is my go to. They are so tender  and balanced out with the right spices.   They also have great drink specials if that is of interest. I really like their frozen margs - multiple flavors and you can probably mix and match. From what I remember  they also have a very affordable HH. During HH  they have an open Nacho bar  usually to snack on as well if you re waiting for a table . The Nacho bar is always a hit for me since I can sip on a drink outside and have some nachos while I wait.   Great place - Always recommend.
Chuy's,120,I was introduced to Chuy s in Round Rock a few months back. Their beans are the best I ve ever had. When I realized there was one in in Austin  my partner and I had to stop in. Same friggin  beans  Love the atmosphere. So bizarre  Anyway  the waitress was super duper nice and we never had to ask for refills. We will definitely be back 
Chuy's,121,They refused to serve me alcohol for WHATEVER reason  i had my ID and asked them if they could scan it and they said they didn t have a scanner and refused to serve me without a second form of ID. As if i carry my birth certificate with me everywhere. Absolutely ridiculous.
Chuy's,122,You can t go wrong with Chuy s  We came on a Saturday afternoon and had a wonderful time.   We sat closest to the road and it seemed a little warm because the sun was just RIGHT THERE in your face. They had the blinds closed  but you can t avoid the heat.   We got our chips and salsa  and ordered the queso as well. My Dad got the Corna Margarita with a pineapple liquor shot  and I got the blackberry margarita on the rocks. Both were delicious and quickly made for us.   I got the grilled fish tacos  and they were favorable AF. They used the jalapeno sauce and I couldn t get enough. My husband got the flautas and stopped talking as soon as our plates arrived. I forget what my parents got   too much tequila   BUT I know they enjoyed their meal.   We left so full we were miserable.  but we were so happy. Definitely eat here. Chuy s is the bomb
Chuy's,123,I looooove this place. Its so funky inside  Service is great  food is awesome and the best Tex-Mex. The queso is probably the best I had in Austin. I could eat whole bowls of that stuff  Also tried the guacamole which was very fresh and flavorful and the traditional cheese and onion enchiladas. Margaritas came in a variety of flavors and sizes. The Cadillac one I tried had great flavor but could have been a teeeeeny bit stronger. This is my fave spot in Austin and definitely makes it onto my return list.
Chuy's,124,Good Tex Mex to soak up the suds of a long weekend. No frills  laid back establishment that offers chips and salsa to start and a large menu of Tex-mex options. Enchiladas are the way to go. Add some spice to it with a side of rice and beans and you ve got yourself a great meal. Check out the T-shirt options near the front entrance on your way out.
Chuy's,125,For all you Chevys lovers out there  the local version here in Austin is called Chuy s. The prices are half of Chevys and food is just as good.  Our server was great and attentive and kept the soda refills and salsa coming   Paid  15 for the deluxe combo and soda which was more than enough for two people to share  I was still super full at the end .  Can t go wrong at this quirky tex-mex spo
Chuy's,126,It was 20 years when I got my first taste of Chuy s and I have been a fan ever since.  Nothing fancy  as TexMex should be  but what they turn out is consistent  delicious  and incredibly addicting food.  My favorite is the Steak Burrito-A handmade  12  flour tortilla stuffed with grilled steak and cheese and topped with a Hatch Green Chile sauce. Pair that up with a texas martini and I m in heaven.  Over the years  they have grown but will always have a soft spot in my heart for the original location.  For me  it optimizes the  old  Austin and brings back fond memories.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Just a great place 
Chuy's,127,The food was great and the staff was awesome. So family friendly too  This is my favorite type of restaurant to go to after a long day.
Chuy's,128,Chuy s has gotten too busy to be enjoyable. And it wasnt amazing the last time  4years  we were there. Nothing about the experience was pleasant. The food and drinks weren t good.  Service was adequate  front reception was bothered that customers existed. I felt like we were in a room full of unhappy people and folks eager to leave. Be back never. Beeeeiiii   There are way too many better options in this town now.
Chuy's,129,This is one of my favorite spots in Austin for amazing Tex-Mex. You can t beat a good Chuy s meal. I have this high on my list as a must eat when I am in town visiting and recommend it to first time Austin visitors as well. Come hungry and ready to eat.  This location is a popular one. Chuy s is in line of popular Austin restaurants outside of Zilker Park on Barton Springs. Parking and getting a table can be pretty rough on weekends or evenings  but it s definitely worth the wait. The inside d cor and vibe is definitely divey  but that adds to the authentic experience.   The food is so good. You can t go wrong with anything on the menu. With the chips I highly recommend asking for the creamy jalapeno sauce in addition to salsa. Dreams are made of that creamy jalapeno. You might want to save some for later to pour all over your entr e too. The fish tacos are also one of my favorites and outside of Austin it ll be hard to find a place doing them this well. Even the rice and beans on the side are amazing. Get the charro beans   If you love Tex Mex or want to see what authentic Tex Mex is about then make your way to Chuy s 
Chuy's,130,A great Tex-mex place  Reminds me of more Baja style Mexican place commonly found in Southern California  rather than Tex-next. I got the taco and cheese enchiladas combo dish. The portions are very generous and I was too full by the end to finish my taco. The highlight would have to be the chips  The chips are so thin and crispy. I love the sauces they give you  ranch-like  spiced cheese.
Chuy's,131,5 star ambiance 5 star salsa 5 star tortillas 5 star service  5 star for keeping it old school AND local  5 star for Jalepe o Ranch dip 5 star for letting me order a la carte tacos    Bam   5 Stars 
Chuy's,132,Upon the recommendation of some locals  we headed to Chuy s  the original location  for dinner one night during our week in Austin.  We arrived and were greeted with a HUGE crowd in the bar area. We squeezed through until we could find a place to stand and then started our 45 minute wait for a table.  Since it was happy hour  there were drink specials going on  and they had an impressive nacho bar set up.  Those nachos held us over and we were very happy to find those   The minute that happy hour was done  the bar area completely cleared out.  It was such a sudden shift of bodies that it was pretty bizarre.  We were able to be seated shortly after.  Once seated  we mentioned to our waitress that we had hoped to watched the inter-state basketball game for our teams back in the Midwest.  The next thing we knew - the tv in our line of sight was changed to our game - much appreciated detail    I ordered the stacked enchilada upon advice from the waitress who suggested that it was a customer favorite.  I d say that it was just okay.  It was large  but really dry and pretty bland.  One of my coworkers ordered the stuffed avocado which was the special that night  and it looked fabulous.  I was excited to get to try the  famous  Chuy s creamy jalapeno dip and I enjoyed that a lot.
Chuy's,133,We went on a Saturday night around 6pm hoping the wait wouldn t be too long. We were told 35-45 minutes. It was closer to an hour  but worth the wait. The food is as good as ever  it just seems the wait times are getting longer.   We had one of their new pineapple jalepeno margaritas while we waited. That was surprisinly good.  Service was ok  but I guess you have to expect that with it being busy. Overall good food will keep us coming back.
Chuy's,134,Disappointing changes to the menu makes this less of a special destination for dinner or lunch. In particular  removing flan and sopapillas from the menu took away two of the few uniquely good items on the menu. No one did it better and now they re gone. Meanwhile  the restaurants are full again and it s hard to see why they can t add back those kinds of items.  Adding a star for their response  effort counts . More stars to come if missing items make their way back.
Chuy's,135,Horrible bar tender today. I understand at it was a busy day for them but customer service is always a thing. Lanyie was extremely rude and yelling at customers to hurry up and order. We asked the difference in price on the margaritas and she stated  i don t know like  3  in an extremely rude manner.  After this she decided to laugh with the customer sitting in front of us about how she was handling the situation. When she finished our drinks she just yelled the price and continued to yell at the next customers. As someone who works in food service it is sad to see someone not care about their relationship with their customers. This was my first time at this chuy s and will be the last. If I could rate 0 stars I would.
Chuy's,136,HAVE YOU EVER READ THE BOOK  A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY   YOU KNOW HOW IN THE BOOK EVERYTHING OWEN SAYS IS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE HIS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE HE S ALWAYS SHOUTING  THAT IS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE IN THIS RESTAURANT. THIS IS THE LOUDEST RESTAURANT IN AUSTIN  LOUDER EVEN THAN THE GIBSON  WHICH WE USED TO THINK WAS THE LOUDEST. NOPE. THIS PLACE. LOUD. SO VERY LOUD. WE PRACTICALLY HAD TO SIT ON EACH OTHERS  LAPS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. L-O-U-D    Install some ceiling absorption panels  you lazy bums. We d bet our daughter s college fund that we re not the first people to complain about this.  We used to live around the corner from a Chuy s in Dallas  so this restaurant has always had a special place in our hearts. We ended up here on Saturday night because we were nearby to see a friend s show at the Zach and always love to visit original locations.  We started with mango margs  which were supposed to be frozen  but came out watery  our second regular margarita was better . The guacamole was not particularly good  but we did love their super fresh and spicy salsa. Dinner was admittedly great  chicka-chicka boom-boom enchiladas and chicken tortilla soup. The enchiladas were smothered with a kickass queso and the refried beans were fantastic. The soup was probably one of the best we ve had in Austin because you could tell that the broth was homemade and everything in it tasted bright.  The hostess was a flake and snowflake who had no idea what she was doing  but our waitress was a rock star and on top of everything--she should be a manager.   Overall  4 stars for the food  but we re GENEROUSLY giving three total because of the acoustics and aforementioned lesser aspects of the evening.
Chuy's,137,Our first visit to Chuy s and Austin.  Chips were excellent and Salsa s were very good.  The ambiance was very interesting  especially in the bar area as they had old vinyl records stapled to the wall.  One of my favorites was B. J. Thomas s greatest hits   We chose a great chicken enchilada.  The chicken white meat was superb and the blue corn tortillas were super.  Best of all the service was excellent      This is the original Chuy s and lived up to the recommendations of our Texas friends.  Can t wait to go back soon   Highly recommend 
Chuy's,138,Fantastic service and the food was great  but I think we ve had better in the Bay Area.  Love their homemade chips and the salsa were so bomb  The margaritas were dope and super tasty.
Chuy's,139,If you don t like Chuy s there s something wrong with you and your proclivities  prob picked up in Cali which is where you should go back to  not any one of their amazing establishments
Chuy's,140,Texans love Chuy s and if you are in search for Tex-Mex  it really is the place to go. This location is across the water from downtown so plan on taking a Lyft there. Once there  you re transported into a Tex-Mex Disneyland serving the best enchiladas in town with a side of margarita. The price is good and portions even better 
Chuy's,141,Ten stars for chuys  the legend  my lover on cold nights  my rock.  May you never age  and have good luck salsa always flowing in  your direction
Chuy's,142,Just ordered pickup order online. Got back to hotel  no eating utensils. Geez. Check your order before you leave the parking lot.
Chuy's,143,I have zero self control when it comes to chips and salsa.  This was my second time coming to this location and I was not disappointed either time.  We were immediately seated  which was surprising on a Thursday night and since the place was packed. We were quickly offered drinks.  The margs were spot on. I had the stuffed avocado special for dinner and it was very good.  I was very happy with the choice.  I could have lived without it being fried  but  man  it was delicious. My sister got a chuychanga and my fiance had a burrito.  There was an incredible amount of food on the table between our three entrees.  The boom boom sauce was underwhelming.  Just a sidenote - this place is very LOUD and busy almost all of the time.
Chuy's,144,Just recently moved here and had to try tex-mex food... I digged the ambiance  waitress  vibes and the food was amazing 
Chuy's,145,Despite a long wait  this was great Tex mex. had huge portions. Did the chalupa and chicken enchilada combo. Wished I could have eaten it all. Service isn t the best though. It s so crowded that s why.
Chuy's,146,Tex-Mex...i think i prefer authentic Mexican food instead. When i tried tex-mex  in my opinion  i felt like i  was eating a very americanized Mexican Food. Food i can get from El Torito s  Del Taco  etc  Yelp and uber drivers recommended Chuy s for good tex-mex  so we followed. The fajitas were pretty standard  i didn t taste anything different from what i can get in SoCal. The chicken fajita was really dry. We also got an appetizer sasmpler which included flautas  chicken from the flautas were dry and it was different from what i have in SoCal. It wasn t flour tortilla that they used to deep fry  it almost looks like a wonton skin to me   the queso was tasty but you can probably make your own at home using jar nacho cheese  the spicy option   the chicken quesadilla was the same except they added grilled onions to it  the 4th item from the sampler was the best -- fried tortilla topped with refied beans  jalapeno  and cheese. The initial bite was crunchy and you get a mouthful of the toppings.  Overall experience was nice and i don t think i need to try another tex-mex place in austin  tx. If i want americanized food i can just drive to taco bell and get my fixes.  Personally i love my authentic mexican food that i can get in san diego and los angeles.
Chuy's,147,Nice night out.  Lively.  Very ornate decor.  Fun   Everyone including the vegetarians like their meals.    Long wait so don t forget to go on line and put yourself of the wait list.   We did and although it stated 60 minutes it took longer.
Chuy's,148,I was kept waiting for my order for over 20 minutes and had to keep reminding employees. At least one or their waiters was on coke.
Chuy's,149,Walked here from downtown after being told that the chicka boom boom was must have in Austin. It was great and the atmosphere was fun  but it just wasn t amazing. While its worth a stop this wasn t the best tex mex I had in town.
Chuy's,150,Around my area  Chuys seemed to be a very popular choice as far a Mexican food goes. I decided to give in to the hype and try it out. When I walked into the restaurant  I immediately noticed the unique decor which gives the place a nice atmosphere. When I was seated at my table the employees were very nice. For an appetizer  I ate chips with creamy jalapeno sauce which I must say was extremely delicious  These were probably the best chips I ve ever had at a Mexican restaurant. Next up I had some tacos as my main course and unfortunately  they weren t up to the same caliber as the chips. It was sort of dry and a little bland but it was good enough to finish the plate.  All in all  I would definitely recommend Chuys for the creamy jalapeno sauce alone.
Chuy's,151,THE ORIGINAL    ... I ve been drinking those frozen margarita swirls since 1983 when I first moved to Austin  ... and man was I happy when they first arrived into the San Antonio market into a cool neighborhood location just down the road from me in the late 90s. I walked into the door and there was my old manger from the Black Eye Pea Austin who was now  then  Regional Manager for Chuy s. Hi Doug Crawford  I still miss the original Chuy s location in Alamo Heights   Oakwood area that is now Soluna at Broadway  amp  Sunset. Chuy s closed that location to open at 281  amp  1604. Now there are three locations in SA  All the big chain locations are not the same as the original... both in Austin and SA...   As I was reading Luci s review how super crowded this location is  it brought me back in time to a traumatic experience... In 85  I spent two months in Europe traveling around. I craved Tex-Mex sooo bad that I can t even describe how bad... and you will only understand it if you have felt the same. You can take the girl out of Texas but you can t take the Texas and her love of Tex-Mex away from her. All I could think about for two months was stepping off that plane to have me some Chuy s  or Jaime s  or Matt s  or     ... but Chuy s was first choice of course. My mom came in from out of town with three other people to pick me up at the airport on Dec 15. Customs was backed up in Houston which led me to miss my plane connection and run an hour  or two  late on the next flight. We drove over to Chuy s to get my Tex-Mex fix on and we couldn t find parking. I went to check on wait time and my pick up party said  no way . The old people were tired  it was late  and they just wanted to go home... so I was dropped off at my home with no dinner.  Welcome home  Cya later   I had not been home in two months  I had nothing to eat  WTH     Sad  Sad  Sad... Don t ya feel sorry for me       Parking has always been really really really bad... just an iddy bitty lot in back with a few spots in front. On my most recent visit  I noticed there a much larger lot in back of that lot which used to be the trailer park. I guess it s been awhile since I ve been to the original location. Wow    So a few weeks ago  I found myself in Austin for an early show which means either driving in 5 o clock traffic for a couple of hours OR coming into town early to kill a couple of hours  in  town which I usually opt for. I had already been craving the Chuy s Happy Hour Nacho Car Bar for a couple of weeks so it occurred to me that I should hit it up my old stomping grounds for a dinner time snack. It was around 5 30pm  I walked right up to the bar and sat down on a Tue eve. Yes  it was crowded but not anything more than what it always has been. Same old Same old. Except the photo booth is gone and another table is in it s place. I loved that photo booth    It is freaking me out seeing people call this location a chain restaurant. My head is screaming   It s not a chain   ... it s Chuy s  ... ok  I ll let y all call all the other locations a  chain  ... but not this one ... this is the original... this  is  Chuy s Tex-Mex Deluxe    Chuy s started celebrating the Hatch Chile way before anyone else did... holding the first Hatch Chile Fest outside of New Mexico in 1989. Then the original Central Market opened in 1994 on N. Lamar and they quickly jumped on the bandwagon with their own Hatch Chile Fest... now everyone every where celebrates that yummy chile pepper. Chuy s special seasonal menu for three weeks in Aug-Sep is a must do    What do I love about Chuy s    Elvis  Elvis  and the Elvis Shrine   Happy Hour Nacho Car Bar   Hatch Chile Fest   Mixed App Plate  I like variety so it s my go to     The Funky Interior  black velvet paintings  hubcaps  old school 50s dining sets   Flatware in the old school sanitized bags like all the diners used to do   Mili Pescada Bar   Often imitated  by other locations  but never duplicated... this is THE ORIGINAL    Chuy s just rocks. period.
Chuy's,152,The place looks like a popular lunch spot on weekdays too. The wait was 10 min on a Friday around 1pm.   The Friday special chicken enchilada was amazing and so was the beef relleno. The shrimp taco was meh for me personally. it wasn t bad...it was just fried shrimp.   Otherwise the waiter was prompt about keeping the salsa bowl filled for the chips. Overall pretty great Tex-mex
Chuy's,153,Chuys is your average Tex mex place. Everything was pretty good. The enchiladas are made with your basic enchilada sauce. My favorite thing from here is the queso. Can never go wrong with their queso. It s so tasty and goes great on anything they offer  fajitas  burritos  chimichangas. The margaritas are fantastic. It s like the perfect blend of mix  tequila and triple sec.
Chuy's,154,First off I have to say OMG I love the jalapeno ranch  It s so creamy and  cool yet has just the right amount of spice. The Fajitas are amazing and all meals come with such a good portion that you don t have to worry about getting full. Everything here is fresh and tastes great. Mexican food at its finest
Chuy's,155,Ok I know Chuy s is a chain but the food is good   I like the eclectic atmosphere as well.  A lot of Mexican restaurants serve thick chips. I much prefer the thin ones here. Also they have a great variety of sauces which is awesome. The servers have been consistently good. I like the Elvis Chicken with the Bang Bang sauce  and the queso was really tasty.   I d say try it out and see what you think  - 
Chuy's,156,Minus two stars for the totally inept male hosts who stood around chatting with one another and left me hanging at the entrance while my husband sat at our table for several minutes.  We re in town for ACL  and we came in for dinner after an entire day at the festival. We were told there was a 5-10 minute wait  so we each went to our respective restrooms to wash up. When I came out of the ladies room  I returned to the host stand  where the 2 guys were talking. There were no other restaurant guests present.   After waiting a few minutes and hearing another party get called  I inquired about our reservation. The host looked at his list and couldn t find our name on it. Only then did a woman step forward and volunteer to show me where my husband was seated. It was completely ignorant of the 2 hosts not to mention that my husband had already been shown to our table  as we had walked in a few minutes prior and no one else was in the entryway.   Our female server was great  and the food was fine  but my experience was soured by my initial impression. The restaurant would benefit from hiring more competent hosts.
Chuy's,157,Tex to the freaking Mex. I love Chuy s because of three reasons  reasonable prices  authentic tastes and the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom enchilada. Not only do you get a lot of food  you get a lot of flavor as well. The heat isn t overpowering but you will get overwhelmed with how no matter how much you eat  the food just doesn t seem disappear    With loud and lively environment  friendly servers and a never ending supply of chips and salsa  your lunch dinner are bound to leave you so full you can t move and then you ll be back for more the day after.
Chuy's,158,This is the place to go for Tex-Mex in Austin. There s a reason why this place is always crowded  the food is delicious  and the portions are huge. I ve been here multiple times over the years  and my two favorite meals are the combo fajitas for one and the Elvis Presley Memorial combo.   The Elvis Presley Memorial combo is a lot of food and comes with 3 types of enchiladas covered in different sauces  chicken  ground beef  cheese   a crunchy ground beef taco  Spanish rice  refried beans  and some tostada chips dipped in chili con queso. It s two meals for a normal person. One meal and a snack for me.  Always get the combo fajitas  because you get a nice portion of both steak and chicken. When my friend ordered just chicken fajitas  he basically got the same amount of chicken as me. The steak is seasoned well and tender  while the chicken is a well seasoned chicken breast. This is served on top of sizzling onions and peppers with Spanish rice  refried beans  sour cream  pico de gallo  cheese  guacamole  lettuce  and 3 homemade flour or corn tortillas. Yes  the portion size is ridiculous and I can usually make 2 meals out of this if I fill up on chips.   Speaking of the chips  they are super thin  fresh  and crispy  served with a tomato salsa that is literally steeping in lime juice. Ask for creamy jalapeno  a spicier ranch  if you want to try it. During happy hour  M-F 4-7 PM   they have a nacho bar that has unlimited nacho cheese  seasoned ground beef  refried beans  red salsa  and pico de gallo. Serve yourself a few baskets of those and you can just take the entree to go   I also had the Friday special  which was the Bacon wrapped Hatch green chiles stuffed with Al Pastor and Cheese. It was okay  but wasn t as good as I thought it would be. I ll probably stick with the previous two entrees next time.
Chuy's,159,We stopped by for a beer after spending the day at Barton Springs Pool and it was a mad  crazy scene inside. Packed and noisy and fun.   The beer list was a joke so we settled on a margarita. Delicious and quick to arrive we got the routine of getting your own chips and salsa and loaded up.  They were delicious and the gratis salsa bar is a nice touch. We ordered guacamole and our waitress forgot it. Then ordered another margarita which took forever to get there. We reminded her about the guacamole which she brought ten minutes later. It was seriously a zoo at about 5 pm on a Friday night. By the time we got the order I was full from all the salsa  it was a bit underwhelming and overly salty.  Fair enough we didn t have a meal so lower stars are really for the service. The drinks were good.
Chuy's,160,The Elvis chicken with avocado and an egg added per our waitresses recommendation.  It was delicious  And out hot and freshly prepared. I would absolutely get it again  Service was efficient and super nice. Make sure and tell them if it s your first time in. Free queso 
Chuy's,161,I m told this is a very authentic Tex mex restaurant. Was definitely busy when I went in on Tuesday for lunch. The restaurant has cool  scattered and artsy decor. We sat down and the spot we got was a little cramped  but it wasn t a big deal. Super friendly wait staff that brought us fresh chips and salsa to start.   The food was very favorful and in large portions  everything s bigger in Texas  . Overall was pretty good and definitely not very pricey at all  I don t think there was anything above  15 on the menu .
Chuy's,162,We came at about 6 30 on Friday night and waited 45 minutes for a party of 2  a pretty long wait in my opinion  but we got free chips and queso while we waited  due to happy hour . We also got happy hour margaritas at the bar while we waited  which were a little pricey   16.50 for two large   but delicious. I got a chicken salad and my boyfriend got a chicken burrito with green Chile sauce. Both were good  and the queso was great.  The restaurant itself is definitely kitschy and quirky retro. The decor is funky and weird  but that goes along with the weird and loud vibe of the place.
Chuy's,163,The Chuy s limited menu is getting really boring. I will have to wait until they expand  hopefully adding the Chili Relleno  before going back. Last time  the Chimichanga was cold and barely cooked  I had to send it back. Chuy s was once my favorite go to and their Relleno s were top notch. In the meantime  I will be scouting out my new favorite Mexican Food go to place.
Chuy's,164,After our bike ride around Lady Bird Lake  in heart of Austin in Soco area  we asked bike shop where to get good texmex they said Chuy  And it was right across street so no re- parking..lol. Very funky restaurant and even though before noon  very busy  Outside seating was 2 tables on road but inside had several eating locations. Everyone was friendly  food was plentiful and drinks cold  We have met several locals and everyone has been friendly and helpful 
Chuy's,165,I came here with a group of 6 on a Saturday night and it was packed.  Luckily we were able to put our name down through Yelp to get us on a short list for seating since they don t do reservations.  It probably took about 30-45 min for us to be seated even with that. There wasn t any parking left in their lot so we had to do street parking.  The people around us were SUPER loud and I could barely hear my friend sitting next to me.  I got tamales which were just ok and the Tex Mex enchilada which was pretty average.  This restaurant was pretty mediocre so I d maybe go back.
Chuy's,166,Love Chuy s   We are sure to stop by every time we go to Austin..  Surprisingly good for a chain  and family friendly.
Chuy's,167,Not much else to say that everyone else has not said already  Went here for lunch  got here a little before noon for a large table of 10 and we got seated fairly quickly.  Everyone was raving about this jalapeno ranch  so we tried some of that...it is quite addicting.  I got the chicka chicka boom boom enchiladas because I liked the name  and the waiter said it was his favorite sauce. I did enjoy it  very different spicy queso topping. The food came out very hot  temperature wise  and quickly    I liked their refried beans  it was a little salty but at least it had flavor. I would go back again for happy hour  that prickly pear margarita sounded good.
Chuy's,168,The place was crowded for a Monday night so I was expecting something great.. The service was really good but the food sucked except for the tortilla soup.  The fajita steak was tough and grisly  the carnitas was tough  the rice dry.  The wife s salad was ok  some limp not so fresh lettuce.  The chips and salsa were good  they have a creamy jalape os sauce that was really good. Probably won t go back.
Chuy's,169,This was a great spot for Tex Mex   I ve been to a handful of Tex Mex spots and this is definitely one of the best.  It s not a fancy place  but it s a fun and casual spot for family and friends serving comfort food that is very flavorful and satisfying.  They have a huge menu and it s always a good sign when there are several items on the menu you d want to order.  I had a combination plate  Elvis Presley Memorial Combo   which included three enchiladas  a taco and a fried tortilla with queso...wow  the entire dish was very good and really cheap considering all the food on there.  I also had a nice strawberry margarita  which was sweet and fun.  Definitely check this place out when you re in the area.
Chuy's,170,Before I even get into this review  I just want to say  if you re not a fan of spice  then Chuy s might not be the place for you.... but in my opinion  the spicier  the better   I came with a group of 6 people. Warning  this restaurant is packed with people   We waited around 30 minutes. BUT while you wait  there s a nacho bar    And they also offer drinks  so I can t complain at all. The salsa is so so spicy  and so so good    Once we were seated  service was quick and friendly. My water glass never went dry  thankfully because my mouth was on fire for most of the dinner   and the food came quick  I had a steak burrito  the spiciest burrito I ve probably ever had  and I loved every bite  The portions are HUGE  and the prices can t be beat. Chuy s is one thing I ll definitely be missing about Texas  and next time I m back in Austin  I ll be here again 
Chuy's,171,Fun experience for my whole family  The Shrimp Chili Rellanos  shrimp enchiladas  cheese enchiladas  fish tacos were loved by all. Cassie was the bomb  Our drinks were kept always full and she was very attentive to our needs. Always a good time at Chuy s 
Chuy's,172,This place seems to be a local favorite but I was not impressed. It has a very busy eclectic atmosphere  kind of a mix of an old school diner and a 1970s living room. The food was just overall pretty bland and boring. I had a chimichanga and it just had no taste. It came with a Hatch Chili sauce that was OK but more just hot than flavorful. Everyone at my table was a little disappointed at the overall quality of the food. Kind of just basic  there are so many Tex Mex places in Austin  I will be skipping this one in the future. Service was fine  and the price point is pretty cheap as well.
Chuy's,173,Chuy s gets three stars for being pretty basic  good enough Tex-Mex. The food is fine. Standard  but nothing to write home about. The drinks are also average. Where Chuy s wins is their happy hour chips and dips cart. I love me some chips and dips  and the Chuy s game is strong. Serve yourself tortilla chips  queso  beans  salsas  and taco meat  Muy bueno  Everything else is meh. If you need to be near Zilker for something  it s a fine choice  but there s much better Mexican food elsewhere.
Chuy's,174,Chuy s is always crazy busy and parking is always insanity  but I do like coming here since the food is generally consistently good.  Downside is I tend to eat way too many chips because I like the salsa  but am addicted to the jalape o ranch AND the hatch green chili salsa  this stuff is awesome - bring on the heat .    If you ve got a larger group - it s more of a challenge to get seated  and you better all be there when you get called .  The atmosphere is also loud energetic - so this isn t your quiet spot or romantic dinner location.  Enchiladas are always a hit  I like the crispy tacos too.  Fajitas are also an easy choice.
Chuy's,175,My lovely wife and I are always looking for greta Mexican food. When we were recently in Austin  we found this place.   Wow I wish they had a Chuy s IN phoenix. If they did  we would go to no other Mexican place.  I guess we love Tex Mex more than other other styles and that is what they serve at Chuy s  We had the enchiladas which was incredible. Best we have ever had. The sauce was amazing flavorful and the contents were generous and on point.  We also love queso and theirs was outstanding. I so wish they had a place in Phoenix. Phoenix do not have great Tex Mex yet.  Chips and 2 kinds of salsa are provided free. Thin and crispy  The salsa were so good.  Service was 5 5. Food 5 5. If we lived in Austin  we would be here all the time.
Chuy's,176,What a incredible place to eat your first dinner experience at Austin Texas and the happy hour here is amazing with all the free nachos be cheese salsa among so many other dip that you can use. Authentic Mexican restaurant this is the place to stop and have your dining experience. And I am for Roger because of the servers are fantastic for work and will take care of you.
Chuy's,177,The Baja tacos and jalape o ranch alone could make me walk back here from Portland. 5 star drooling with this combo right here.   The Tito s and cherry drink I had also tasted like an adult cherry limeade from sonic-- I could have had 7
Chuy's,178,Great spot for Tex-Mex and the mojitos are spot on   Just stopped in today for a drink and some appetizers and besides the mojito  the sampler plate was perfect for a later afternoon snack and could easily feed three people.  Laynie was our server and she was awesome 
Chuy's,179,I do love Chuys. For a chain  a national one now  it s super consistent and always what you re looking for. I ll recommend it to anyone. Chuys is my favorite Tex-Mex in Austin.. Dare I say Texas   I m obsessed with all the Chuys I ve ever been to  except this one. My biggest problems with it are  as followed  in no order      Its always super crowded  which is understandable  but they are always expanding  so just open another in the south. Easy.    It s cold in the summer  like super cold.    It s so loud. You can t hear anything the person by you is saying.    There s no outdoor seating.    It s super crowded and this time I m talking about the jammed packed seating. You have to weave in and out of the small space between vinyl chairs and booths.   This is not a diss-review. This is a - travel 5 miles up Lamar for another Chuys - review. Barton Spring Chuys is for the tourists  not the locals.
Chuy's,180,This is our favorite location  we love their outdoor seating. Ask for Patrick he s the best 
Chuy's,181,The food was absolutely amazing at this restaurant. But that s not my reasons for leaving this review. I m hard to impress but Grace really impressed me our waitress. She was the most loving and genuine person we have seen in food service. Her customer service was excellent. She is a very hard worker and was constantly giving great service to her tables. Each one with a smile and never got frustrated at all even during the rush. Her attention to detail was amazing and so quick to resolve your needs without you asking. Her name Grace fits her perfectly  I pray that management acknowledges that she is an asset to their business and she needs to be greatly rewarded for her hard work and excellent service. I am one very satisfied customer.
Chuy's,182,Worth the wait line  service staff was great and good arrived hot. Great for large groups and family friendly. Try the boom boom sauce with delicious mex Tex food and the margaritas
Chuy's,183,This Mexican restaurant is not to be missed in Austin. The place is always packed and cozy. The service is great too. They start with a basket of thin and crispy chips today goes well with everything or just by itself. We visited this place twice in a span of 3 days. We tried enchiladas and Chile relleno with their signature boom boom sauce. It was amazing and extremely tasty. Ask for their jalapeno ranch without fail. We finished with an awesome tres leches cake. They even have a happy hour on weekdays between 4-7 where you get unlimited chips  2 kinds of salsas  shredded beef and queso. This was the best food we had in Austin during our trip.
Chuy's,184,At the suggestion of the bike tour guide we ate lunch here after a 2 hr bike tour of Austin. Line was long at 1 pm. But very food flavoring.   The salsa and chip tasted fresh - probably the best thus far in Austin.   Tres laches was very large and dripping with flavor.
Chuy's,185,Haven t been in a couple of years. Never wowed by the food but this time  the food was delicious  Our waiter was excellent and brought a delicious white creamy sauce for dipping with chips.    The cheese enchiladas were the best I ve had in a long while. Will gladly try it again 
Chuy's,186,We Austinites know where to go when ur around Zilker  downtown or south lamar and are having a desire for some bad arse mexican margarita and some tex mex to get rid of ur last nights hangover and replace it with a subtle buzz. This is a classy joint with an even classier decor. Expect some inconsistency in service but again u know its Chuys where ur gonna get ur fix anywayz..
Chuy's,187,Love this place. On Tuesday s they have the pork chicka boom boom enchiladas and they are the bomb   If you like spicy  creamy and flavorful the boom boom sauce will blow your tastes off. It s sooo good 
Chuy's,188,The free chips and salsa are AWESOME     We ordered the southwestern enchiladas and chicken boom boom  both were delicious. The refried beams had a touch of spicy  and very tasty.
Chuy's,189,I wasn t impressed with the food at Chuy s. This was my first visit and I probably won t be returning. The food lacked flavor. The best part was the chips. I personally am a queso fan and Chuy s queso was just okay. I didn t like the flavors mixed in. As I was eating I noticed that they had a standard queso but it was not offered or mentioned by my server. Also when taking my order  he failed to ask what kind of rice and beans I wanted. Thankfully the person I was eating with remembered. I wasn t looking for authenticity but I was looking for good Mexican food.
Chuy's,190,I visited Austin from California last week and had dinner at Chuy s due to the high number of positive reviews.  The restaurant was packed when I put my name down and I took a buzzer while I waited by the bar.    While I waited  there was bottomless chips and salsa which was a nice touch. The chips were crispy and good.  Once I was seated  the waitress came by to take my order. She looked frazzled  so I joked with her and said she could  breathe  before taking my order.  I ended up ordering the Deluxe Chicken Enchiladas  which was highlighted on the menu.  When the enchilada s came out the flour tortillas that wrapped the chicken were pretty dry. Almost like the food wasn t properly heated enough. The green sauce surrounding the tortilla was on the bland side. The chicken meat inside was rather plain dry as well.  Compared to the many other Mexican places I have tried this place is mediocre at best.
Chuy's,191,Visiting from the East coast was recommended to come here by locals.  Pros  Location- next to food trucks  Barton Springs convenient Great food  flavorful  boom boom chicken is amazing  spicy and plentiful Chips and queso was delicious   Cons  crowded  hard to hear Wait is very very long- we waited an hour to get our food To go food- had a bad experience with ordering and pick up  our orders were mixed up and lost Service could have been better- they were so crowded that the kitchen was having a hard time
Chuy's,192,I love Chuy s and was very disappointed when I had Victoria as a waitress. My party of 5 sat in the bar area and waited for her to come take our drink order. 30 minutes later we had to ask her if there was water. To which she responded  it s self service downstairs . I rarely post reviews but I hope this helps someone avoid Victoria s section next time. Mark  the manager  came and sorted out the issue.
Chuy's,193,Wow...what s up with this location lately    Last week their kitchen got so backed-up that they were turning customers away at the door  We got in just before this happened  only to have our order take 45 minutes  and arrive very wrong .   Tonight I showed up at 9 00. I was the only person waiting  and the tables were about 50  populated. I  walked up to the host  expecting to have her seat me immediately  only to have her hand me a pager. She said that there wasn t a wait for tables  but that she didn t to  slam the kitchen . WTF    I m only one person. How much did she think I was going to order    I wasn t sure whether to be offended or just  well...confused.   After taking a minute to realize that I was actually kind of offended  so I handed back my pager to the host and grabbed a seat at the bar...where I was quickly ignored. Multiple times  and for long stretches.   This location hasn t exactly had a  friendly welcoming  vibe going since it opened  but now they seem to be transitioning to an actively hateful incompetent phase.   What s up  Chuy s mgmt    Get this location back on track.
Chuy's,194,I ve been eating at Chuy s for 20 years now. It never misses the mark. The gold standard for Everyman Tex Mex.
Chuy's,195,I went to this restaurant with my family last night. The place has a fun and cool vibe. Great margaritas to start with while waiting to be seated. Best  outside of Mexico. We had chips and salsa  complimentary. Yum  We were shortly seated and met our waitress. Sorry I don t remember her name  because she was great. Friendly  funny  efficient and attentive. We had a variety of dishes  too many to remember  but all were delicious. Not pricey either. This restaurant is a must try if in Austin.
Chuy's,196,Absolutely love this place and have for years. The service is always amazing and the atmosphere is off the hook  There isn t a meal here that I have had that I haven t enjoyed and the queso blanco hands-down delicious  A true landmark here in the ATX 
Chuy's,197,The only one my boyfriend and I will come to. Welcoming atmosphere and very friendly staff. Not a long wait for a Sunday afternoon for late lunch for two  which was great. Chips and salsa are free while you wait.  SHOUTOUT  Our waiter  Cory G  recommended a salad that was large and delicious Mexi-Cobb Salad . He was on top of refilling drinks and creamy jalape o chips.  Highly recommend this location  as well as this restaurant  for fantastic Tex-Mex food.
Chuy's,198,When you sit they bring you complimentary chips and salsa.  The creamy jalape o is the bomb  Make sure to order it as a dip for your chips. I had the Baja fish tacos which came with the amazing creamy jalape o sauce and I was not disappointed.
Chuy's,199,By far my favorite restaurant simply for 2 reasons  the creamy jalape o sauce and the Big As Yo  Face Burrito. I have been coming to Chuy s ever since I was a toddler and have made my way through the menu. For the past few years  I have mostly ordered the Big As Yo  Face bean and cheese burrito and I don t see myself ever getting anything else - although I will say that the nachos and or chicken fajitas are a close second. The burrito is such a comfort food for me and hits the spot every single time  without fail. It is a huge portion so I always end up taking at least half of it home to devour the next day  especially since I usually fill my stomach just from eating the chips and creamy jalape o sauce  you have to ask for it - it s like a secret menu item but is a free addition to your basic chips and salsa . Happy hour at Chuy s is also a hit because of the free  unlimited nacho bar  chips  taco meat  refried beans  queso  salsa  pico de gallo .
Chuy's,200,I ve always heard of Chuy s as a popular Tex Mex chain  but surprisingly I ve never tried it until just last week. It was actually very good and recently I ve grown a new fondness for tex mex  so I was super excited to try Chuy s.   Like most Tex Mex places  they always give you a basket of chips with salsa and Chuy s has this really good creamy jalapeno sauce that s the bomb. The chips were great and totally addicting. I couldn t resist and ate so many that I couldn t finish what I actually ordered afterwards. This location that I went to was super crowded and small  but that didn t take away from the experience. Prices were decent  especially for the portion size. I ordered one of the specials they had that day which was chicken enchiladas with an avocado and green chile sauce. It was super delicious  I also tried some of the Chuychanga from a friend s dish which was great as well  Definitely coming back soon 
Chuy's,201,Damn this place is great and food is amazing to bad we don t have one in Cali. Might have to go back to Austin just to have this Texmex.
Chuy's,202,Who doesn t love Chuy s  Two words  Jalape o Ranch. Dip your chips in it  put it on your food  eat it alone- ha  It s good on everything. I ate way too many chips and salsa ranch. Their burritos and appetizer plates are pretty great. Queso is only subpar so pass it up and eat more jalape o ranch. Service is hit or miss.
Chuy's,203,Let me get this straight for years since Chuys been open I was a regular at Chuy s and love it. I ordered the Strawberry Mojito and was a 3 star.....too much ice seems  watery.  My husband ordered the Regular Chuys  Margarita and he loved it. The Nachos were beef and was a 4 star rating a little too much salt.  My server tonight was Alberto  who is way and beyond hard working  waiter. Chicken Enchildas with sour cream sauce tasted like it was burnt and couldn t eat my favorite Chuys plate. So I told the server why I didn t like my Enchildas and ask to order the Beef Enchiladas which were just fantastic. I give five stars so succulent and tasty. He was sorry and made it clear he will bring me a replacement. Alberto did very well bringing of the best Beef Enchiladas. I was very happy and for dessert is a freshly made Tres Leches cake a five star rating delicious  The noise level in a crowded small resturant which  I considered almost unbearable a negative. Tables are sort of sticky not wiped clean. Parking is a joke you have to park next door not to long of a walk but still able to get to a very crowded noisy resturant  lately a hit or miss. In the past I have more of a positive experiance I really want to come back for an update to see if any new changes have occurred. The main positive is management didn t charge me for my plate of Chicken Enchiladas I am so grateful and thank him for this kind gesture. Chuys is a sort of touristy type of place kind of like Matt s El Rancho busy and famous. But Chuys I will try again soon so be looking for me. I love you Chuys    Till my next visit.
Chuy's,204,Good Mexican restaurant near Downtown Austin  I wouldn t say there is anything special abt this place as compared to other good Mexican restaurants  but it does have a good lively vibe  I liked the friendly servers and the Tres leches cake  I did not like the Sangria because I think it was made from blended fruit juice rather than fresh fruit. I told this to the server and she was happy to replace it with a Cabernet wine  The food is very good. We tried the veggie combo and chicken combo and tacos 
Chuy's,205,The moment you enter this place it is like a colorful maze with people all confused and walking around. The salsa tasted homemade and the enchiladas were seasoned really well. Overall great atmosphere and fun place.
Chuy's,206,Love this place during Happy Hour 4pm-7pm  Monday through Friday. There s a self serve nacho bar that is complimentary. The self serve bar includes nacho cheese  beef  their salsas  and jalape os. Their domestic beers only  2.75 and house margaritas only  3.95. You can not beat that. Come early though because the bar area fills up quickly. You won t regret coming here.
Chuy's,207,Fabulous flavors and beautiful presentation  I had the chicken enchiladas with BOOM BOOM sauce.  My only suggestion is to use less salt. The atmosphere is perfect 
Chuy's,208,Honestly just a great pace for Tex mex. don t go expecting for authentic Mexican food. Good tortilla soup  salsas  enchiladas  and quesadillas. Love their specials. Pro tip  just ask for their salsas on the side  it s pretty much free.
Chuy's,209,SO good. I moved to Austin a few months ago and this was the best Mexican food I ve had so far. Our server Ashley was AMAZING - also the best service I ve had in Austin.  Everything is homemade and I don t think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.
Chuy's,210,I have always loved Chuy s but tonight I had it delivered and I found a pebble in the middle of my retried beans. I bit down on it and am surprised it didn t chop my tooth.
Chuy's,211,Tried the Comida Deluxe and the platter was huge  with rice and beans  two enchiladas  one taco  and guacamole. Overall food was solid if unspectacular  but great value for money for all the food they give. The ambiance instead was low key  casual and very eclectic. Service was great and the chips and salsa was on point.
Chuy's,212,Oh gosh  Chuy s  it is good y all  However  I feel like there are so many more authentic Mexican and Tex mex restaurants in the Austin area  I loved their watermelon frozen margarita and the Mexican martini certainly caught my eye. My burrito was a bit bland and the spicy sauce was not spicy. Like I said  good but nothing amazing.
Chuy's,213,Fun  family friendly Tex-Mex dining. Our server was VERY accommodating and friendly. We ordered two plates  queso  and a kids meal - and walked out with to-go boxes. Be careful not to stuff yourself on the fresh  delicious chips and dips. The white jalape o sauce is amazing.  This location is also great for a quick walk to burn off the calories at the park OR keep heaping it on with two ice cream locations near by.
Chuy's,214,We were visiting from NYC and in search of epic Texas queso - and Chuy s definitely has it. This Chuy s is located next to an awesome area of a bunch of food carts.  Both quesos were awesome  and the free salsa  amp  chips were delicious. I got their daily special - the wild burrito  which was HUGE  Great place if you re very hungry and looking for tons of Tex Mex  
Chuy's,215,Chuy s came highly recommended from many people that I know they have visited Austin. I seen quite a few of these around the city  and was a little bit skeptical because it seem like a chain  which I guess it would be  but it s local only. Any case  the food was amazing  I had the Chicka Chicka boom boom  and it was well worth it  I ll definitely visit multiple times a year  If you re in town for a few days you have to try  it s just one of those places in Austin that is somewhat of a Mexican food landmark.
Chuy's,216,This was some phenomenal Tex-Mex  which I m not fully clear on what that actually means yet. Apparently it has to do with if there is yellow cheese or not... Anyway  wish I would have spent more time reading the back of the menu and understanding why God blessed Chuy s and why Elvis was everywhere. I heard that Chuy is the nickname for Hispanic people named Jesus. Not sure if that helps solve the puzzle  but a fun fact anyway. Nonetheless  the food was amazing and service was really good too.
Chuy's,217,It quickly became my favorite restaurant in Austin for Tex-Mex. They aced at food  drinks and service in all areas.  We started with chips and salsa. Chips were thin and crispy and perfectly baked. Salsa was really good and enough spicy. For the main course we ordered Enchiladas. The sauce over it was too good. you can feel the authentic Mexican flavour in the sauce. The spice level was enough.  All the drinks were good.  The service was prompt and the waiter was helpful and friendly.
Chuy's,218,We came to Austin for my daughter s 12th birthday. Her first birthday wish was to go to the OG Chuy s  and that s just what we did. They did not disappoint. Service was awesome  ambiance was great  food was spot on 
Chuy's,219,OH MY GOD       This place RIGHT HERE     First of all if you come here ask for Lucas he was INCREDIBLE     I went here for the first time with my friend tonight  03 21 19  and we both were blown away  The place is colorful  friendly  there s a cute fish tank and great food     I ordered the  as big as yo face burrito  the chicken fajita one with the regular rice and LAWWWWWWWD it was amazing  I couldn t even finish it was so much AND THEN THE DESSERT hhoooooooommaahhhhggaaadddd    Im Puerto Rican so Im picky with tres leche but the lord blessed my tres LECHOTA because that s what it was lol it was huge and delicious    Omg ask for Lucas. Get a burrito. Or whatever you want. Spend all your money here lol it was awesome.  -Nirvana N.
Chuy's,220,Bad idea to come here during ACL weekend. We were walking to the kayaking place and wanted to grab a bite to eat so decided to stop here randomly. Good thing the wait wasn t too long. We were seated after about 10-15mins. Besides that  everything seemed to go wrong the moment we started ordering.   First of  probably due to the high number of customers this weekend  all cocktail drinks were served in plastic cups. We ordered 2 margaritas  they came in the tiny 8oz cups. One was  6 and the other was  9. It was a complete rip off    Secondly  even though my food was good  it wasn t exactly what I ordered  but I didn t feel like complaining and having to wait longer for the food  so I ate it anyway.  Last but not least  it s a very decent size restaurant  located in the middle of downtown  and yet  they have 2 stalls in the female restroom. It was a good 15mins wait just to use the bathroom.   With tons of other restaurants in the area  I would never come back here again 
Chuy's,221,Good classic Tex mex  Ask for creamy jalape o salsa with the chips   they also have a great happy hour   Free chips queso guacamole and cheap good margs  
Chuy's,222,Man I love Chuy s.  Their salsa is soooo good and they have the thin chips that they keep warm   Our server at lunch was named Dalton and he was really a good server.  I would give them 5 stars but I found a hair on my flauta...still ate it though.   The flauta  not the hair.  Their queso is also very good  it doesn t quickly harden into yellowish-orange glue that breaks off chips and has the consistency of wet concrete.  Their hatch green chile chicken flautas were awesome.  One of the things that I judge a Mexican food restaurant by is their charro beans  and they do it right.  They also make really good tortillas on-site there.  My brother is a tortilla SNOB and he said they were the best he s ever had.  It was a great experience in a great location.
Chuy's,223,I came here after someone told me to try it and I m sure glad I went. The inside is uniquely decorated in each section of the restaurant.   They give you chips and dip to start off. One of be dips is a spicy salsa and they other is a creamy jalape o dip that is AMAZING   I ordered extra for my entree.  My entree was the Baja tacos  fried shrimp  which was very delicious. The rice that came with it was mediocre. Ask for more of the jalape o dip and pour it on your tacos and it tastes even better 
Chuy's,224,Completely and utterly delicious   We came here today hoping for a good meal. What we got instead was a fabulous meal. My mother in law had the Chile Rellenos plate and she was extremely happy with her choice. My husband had. Stacked Enchiladas. He loved them so much  he couldn t stop eating even when full. Oh  and he ordered a plate to go...lol. I had a bowl of hot and delicious chicken tortilla soup. Yummy   Service was excellent and atmosphere was fun. Go if you want a really good time in a fun environment.
Chuy's,225,Great management and good leadership. There was an issue and Casey  our server immediately involved Emily the manager. The issue was corrected and Emily assumed accountability. In my opinion this is excellent work on the staffs part.   Food was great and I will return.   Thank you Emily.
Chuy's,226,Stopped in here after spending the day at Barton Springs Pool to check  Tex-mex  off the list. I guess I don t really understand how Tex-mex is different than the Mexican restaurants we have in the Midwest but this place was fine. It s like every other Mexican restaurant I ve ever been to with bright colors and a gigantic list of margaritas. It s famous for its jalape o sauce which is good but I don t know that I d go out of my way for it. I ordered the Elvis platter which was a good variety and way too much food for one person
Chuy's,227,This was good standard west mex type food. Nothing stood out  but was still good. Great service. Really good corn tortillas 
Chuy's,228,I can t believe I haven t reviewed Chuy s yet.  I drive by the Barton Springs store twice every day  and stop to get food-to-go about every 2 weeks.  Usually I get my favorite  a steak burrito  which is covered with Hatch pepper sauce  with refried beans instead of charro on the side.  I ve been eating that since they opened the Houston store on Westheimer many years ago.  Last night  since it s their annual GreenChiliFest  I got Boom-Boom pork enchiladas.  It may be among the best things I ve ever eaten.  I think they only serve it during the chilifest  so I suggest you stop by and try it.  I ll certainly get it again before the festival is over  Sept 3  maybe  .  Here s their description of it    Pork Boom-Boom Enchiladas -Two green chile roasted pork and cheese enchiladas with our Boom-Boom Sauce  made with cheese  green chiles  tomatillos  green onions  cilantro and lime juice. Served with green chile rice and refried beans.   The hostess  to-go person  and bartenders are always happy  friendly and polite.  And their barbacks are amazing...they never stop moving.
Chuy's,229,Chuy s is usually my go to spot if one is near by. My only disappointment with this location is that they don t serve a full menu in the bar area  I guess at the bar they do . I was ready to order a full meal  but then my server said I need to be at a different table to order off the full menu. Luckily there was one available in an otherwise crowded establishment. That was my only gripe. Everything else was as expected.
Chuy's,230,Really  really good   After a disappointment at another Mexican place  we came across Chuy s and I was happy we did. The place is super cool  with some old memorabilia. Severs was nice and attentive. Margarita was delicious    We got there at lunch on a Friday and the wait was much better than I expected  15 min at the most .
Chuy's,231,Definitely a must try Tex-Mex spot in Austin...the wait is well worth it. Had a Texas Margarita with salsa and chips- drink was good but salsa was even better. It had a great kick to it and the chips were very fresh. Ordered a chicken burrito- the burrito itself was very soft  the beans were seasoned and cooked to perfection with ample chicken in the burrito. The rice was seasoned well and cooked just right...overall great meal. I love the fact that they have so many sauce options with varying heat levels. Service was ok...they messed up our order but it was quickly fixed.
Chuy's,232,Such a hit - greasy Mexican food and awesome margaritas. Happy hour is great - I always get a swirl frozen margarita and my fianc  and I always split the Elvis fried green Chile chicken with boom boom sauce and an egg on top. Go for the large margaritas - somehow the plastic glasses keep the drinks frozen longer. Don t come to this location if you re not prepared to spend 15 mins on parking and 25-45 minutes waiting to be seated.
Chuy's,233,Muy bueno     Even having it delivered it was fantastic.  Food quality is key and they have all the keys.
Chuy's,234,Amazing little gem with the best food  Loved everything about this place. I would definitely recommend this place. And they have great vegetarian options as well
Chuy's,235,The first time I ordered from here it was absolutely amazing  Second time not so much. Ordered nachos- figures the regular meat cheese beans etc. definitely don t have any meat on these. Called back spoke to Sara- she had a bad attitude and was like oh yea next time order panchos. No apologies  no next time you re here we can give you a free dessert or anything just better luck next time type of chick  Sara next tome do better. I ll probably still order because I do enjoy the food- just hope the service is better when I have an issue. Oh and someone should really teach SARA customer s
Chuy's,236,Had a bad bout of food poisoning today. Chicken fajita quesadilla last night after ACL. Sorry Chuy s. Make sure the chicken you use is fresh and cooked well.
Chuy's,237,Overall I would say this is an okay Mexican place with no parking and a longer than average wait. Aka a tourist trap.
Chuy's,238,First timer and will come back any time I m in Austin. The salsa and chips were so fresh. The chicken enchiladas  were flavorful and super amazing.
Chuy's,239,Some friends and I went to dinner at Chuys  Our favorite Tex-mex place. My friend Caroline wasn t very hungry  so she ordered a half burrito  thinking it would be half priced as well. When the bill came  she was charged only  2 less than a full burrito. Our waitress Ally went above and beyond to make sure we left with a smile on our faces. She talked with her manager  amp  was able to change the bill and only charge her for half a burrito and apologized for the misunderstanding. Ally was the best waitress we ve ever had at chuys and we come here... A LOT  Can t wait to go back  10 10 recommend
Chuy's,240,This is one of our favorite spots to eat for Tex Mex. the portions are huge and affordable  and the food comes out incredibly fast. The staff has always been extremely courteous and sweet  and they do a good job sanitizing everything due to the pandemic. Great food 
Chuy's,241,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS KEY   And the manager Mike  went above and beyond to help amend an unfortunate situation miscommunication.  I had place an online order and came to pick it up at the scheduled time. When I arrived  the hostess told me the order should be out within a few moments... - 10 to 15 min pass  and I inquire to the status of my order. The hostess apologized and mentioned they had a lot of call-ins and online orders  - Another 15 min pass  and at this point I d been waiting 30 min past the point they told me the food would be ready  - After an additional 5 to 10 min I asked again  and the manager approached me asking for the name on my order. I gave it to him  and turns out they did NOT have a record of my order being placed  - He apologized and asked to see my email receipt.   Upon confirming my order was valid he quickly rushed to the kitchen to have my order immediately placed and rushed to the front. He also refunded the charge AND offered me a voucher for a free meal for myself and my entire family at no additional charge.  He also gave me a print-out proof of the reversed charge and gave me all his contact info  should the charge not be reversed.   This is customer service at it s finest and I hold this particular location in the highest regard for handling the situation so maturely. Thank you Chuy s and thank you Mike  This is how you ensure a repeat customer base.
Chuy's,242,Just went here tonight with some friends and I had a great experience. The food was amazing  staff was super friendly  the food came out 10 minutes or so after ordering  really awesome dinner  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for some freakin awesome Tex-mex food with a cool vibe   But one thing...what the hell is up with the prayers on the backs of the silverware packets  Like maybe it s just a Texas thing  I live in California...yea I m being that guy right now  but I feel that s just completely unnecessary. Again  99  of everything was incredible. But why. Why the prayers 
Chuy's,243,Our friends from Texas recommended Chuy s for our first real Tex-Mex experience.  They served us complimentary chips   salsa - at first I thought the serving size was kind of small  I should have known there is no  small  in Texas   but we actually ended up not finishing it  We also got guacamole to go with the chips - it was very fresh  amp  had lots of goodness to it.  My husband and I shared the tortilla soup  my first time trying this dish  and pork tacos - both were very delicious and had more than enough to fill us both up  Service was great and everyone was very friendly - definitely would come back again 
Chuy's,244,Chuy s is always consistent. This time I had the fantastic Elvis fried chicken. Must try. The waitress recommended the Spicy Cucumber Texas Martini. Great recommendation. Not very spicy and a great change from lime Mexican Martini.  Wife got the chicken enchiladas which were great as usual.  Casual  solid  good value TexMex and margaritas.
Chuy's,245,After being placed on hold not once but FOUR times and then being hung up on I decided I d go in and place an order.  Taking into consideration that they may hv been busy  NOPE. Still crap service. The hostess was more worried about looking cute than directing me to where I could place an order. She was rude and very unprofessional. After 20mins of waiting I asked for a manager  whom never came. Disappointing.  Very unprofessional service. Won t be back to this location again.
Chuy's,246,Chuy s is our family s go to restaurant. We ve been coming to this location for years and it never disappoints. It has a fun atmosphere  friendly service  and delicious food. It s so good that I finally signed up for yelp after telling my waitress I d leave a review about her all star service. And now I feel terrible because I ve already forgotten her name  but everyone there is just as nice as can be and super accommodating.
Chuy's,247,Ambience  divvy diner style Tex mex restaurant   Service  excellent  The staff was friendly and helpful and the food was made fresh to order.  Food  I ordered the guacamole app and it came out looking pretty decently sized but pricey for what it was... Then I realized they piled lettuce and onions on the bottom of the small bowl to make the portion look bigger... Not worth  6-7  The Chuychanga was underwhelming to say the least.   I probably would not come here again and wouldn t order the same stuff although these items were recommended to me by the staff and friends.  Save your money go elsewhere 
Chuy's,248,The service is really slow staff isn t really friendly took forever to be helped not sure if I m coming back
Chuy's,249,Excellent service and food. The chicka chicka boom boom was fantastic. The service was excellent and layout was great. The food is fairly priced. Also try the fajita tacos if you can. Can t wait to go back.
Chuy's,250,Great food. The queso was really good. We had the chicken fajitas and chicka chicka boom boom enchiladas. Liz was an exceptional server and our food came out hot and lightening fast. The restaurant was packed  but I would highly recommend.
Chuy's,251,This place was delicious    I couldn t decide between 2 enchiladas  so the waitress  who was awesome and fast attentive  suggested one of each. I couldn t have been happier  My husband however  ordered a beef chili relleno and it came with no cheese in it. He didnt really eat it  so the waitress was nice enough to comp it off of our check. We will definitely be back  He cant wait to try it again with cheese 
Chuy's,252,Amazing food and super cool diner. Staff was really friendly. Food was really flavorful and love the spice 
Chuy's,253,A friend recommended this place on our recent trip to Austin. Already digging the vibes from the outside. Could tell this place had a lot of character. We had a short wait  less than twenty minutes  and were seated and promptly served. Looking around there s an eclectic mix of decor on the walls  pictures of people standing in front of famous locations  retro posters  pieces of cars  hub caps and a fish tank in the center of the room. Nice.  I got a combination plate and a local IPA. Both were delicious. Certainly nothing fancy  but it hit the spot. Portions were large  I don t think anyone cleared their plate.  This food brought my back to my childhood in New Mexico where I consumed copious amounts of Tex-Mex. Glad to have stopped in and would welcome another visit.
Chuy's,254,There was a short wait. My friend got the watermelon margarita which was surprisingly tart. Chips and salsa provided were good. I got a vodka cherry limeade and it was only ok. The enchiladas were spicy  Hotter than I m used to. Everyone else felt it was pretty spicy as well. Mine specifically had salsa verde which may have contributed. Rice was also hot and the beans were ok.
Chuy's,255,We ve been going to this  the first  Chuy s location since they first opened. It s our go-to comfort food. The thing I like best is that the word  no  is not in their vocabulary. They will accommodate any substitution you want to make.
Chuy's,256,Chuy s is a pretty awesome tex-mex restaurant even though it is a chain. It s still a smaller chain. I got the chicka chicka boom boom and it is shredded chicken enchiladas with their boom boom sauce which consists of green chiles  cheese  tomatillos  cilantro and lime. It was really good. The chips come out hot and fresh. The  chips come with salsa and this type of jalapeno ranch. It was interesting and pretty good. I went before their happy hour ended so I was able to get some queso and ground beef from their bar to eat with the chips as well. That was a good surprise. It s a good place to go to try tex-mex. Beats out chains like Chevy s any day.
Chuy's,257,First yelp review ever  Had a party of 10  didnt get seated until an hour and a half after being told only 45 minute wait. We were finally seated  but forced to sit in broken up groups. Terrible management and service. I recommend you eat elsewhere if you can. Food is tasty though.
Chuy's,258,Always the best margs  Chips and salsa are a go to and the jalape o ranch is to die for 
Chuy's,259,Five stars because Chuy s is one of the most iconic Tex-Mex joints and this is the original location  and Chuy s does some things that you still can t easily find elsewhere.  Most of the food at Chuy s is pretty standard Tex-Mex fare that I d normally rate at 3-4 stars  but the two things that I can t find anywhere else  are   The amazing fresh and THIN tortilla chips  why don t other places do this     The creamy jalape o salsa.   NOTE  you have to ask for the creamy jalape o - for some reason they don t just bring it out with the chips. But DO ASK FOR IT   My go-to at Chuy s is the Chuychanga with deluxe tomatillo sauce  which is a creamy sauce fairly similar to the creamy jalape o  but a bit thicker.   SO GOOD and one of my favorite nostalgic places whenever I visit Austin.
Chuy's,260,Food was great. Everyone enjoyed their food. The service however was awful. They put a round table and a square table together witch made the seating horrible. Getting refills and chips and salsa was hard work. The wait staff just moped around with no sense of urgency like people were waiting for stuff.
Chuy's,261,Amazing food  drinks  and wonderful service here. We got confused and ordered an additional drink  but the waiter at the waiting area was so nice to cancel the drink after it was ready. Also nothing beats the Chuy s Chicka chicka boom boom.
Chuy's,262,Absolutely delicious food  We ordered drinks and the waitress was very attentive. Our table was ready and was moved to the back area. Plenty of folks there enjoying their meals. Our waitress Julia was a gem  We told her it was our first time here and she went over the menu with us. I ordered the Chica-Chica Bom Bom and was not disappointed.  It was stuffed with chicken and a spicy sauce.  Hubby had the Chuy s favorites  Taco Chalupa and Enchilada. He was pleased with his choice. The chips were warm and the salsa had a kick. A great meal and will look for this food again closer to home   A great dinner 
Chuy's,263,Wow what can I say  a marble stall  That s really impeccable I really enjoyed my time using the restroom. Two different places to go  one stall and one urinal on the men s side. I for sure felt at home at this one. Toilet paper could use some more ply but that s with most. Please do yourself a service and check it out
Chuy's,264,Spruce service  strong margaritas. This Chuy s is popular  and parking s tight  don t be surprised if you have to wait for a table.  Inside and out  their decor is as colorful as their dishes. Variations on Mexican cuisine - with a bit of Elvis sprinkled in - create a Tex-Mex experience that is uniquely Chuy s. Take their Elvis green chile fried chicken dish  a good value at  8.49  credit cards accepted   a chicken breast breaded with potato chips then deep fried. On top  find liberal amounts of green chile sauce and cheddar cheese.  Sadly  the cheese mutes the chile sauce.  In case the massive portions don t fill you up  the green chile rice and refried beans on the side will finish the job.  I ll be back for happy hour.
Chuy's,265,Haha  this place is a great time if you re looking for a casual  fun introduction to classic Tex-Mex food. I came here on my visit to Austin as recommended by both locals and other tourists alike as the place to come to try the real deal Tex-Mex.  We were seated without much of a wait on a Sunday evening  of a long weekend  and were treated across the board by extremely friendly staff. The vibe of the restaurant is pretty on point from the classic diner-esc feel to the hilariously branded shirts to the arcade games in the back. To be honest the food was nothing incredible but it was definitely a memorable experience.  As a first-timer  we were given a sampler platter of the different kinds of queso  this was our first time having queso   which was a HUGE treat and made a tremendous difference in our experience here. I couldn t tell you which queso I liked the best but the spicier the better  without a doubt.  While we were waiting for our table in the bar area  as well as during our meal   we were imbibing plentifully the awesome margaritas. My drink of choice was the New Mexican Texas Martini. This drinks packed a punch and were definitely a great value. Good tequila and the perfect heat level made for the start of a great night to be had later.  For my entree  I ordered the famous Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom enchilada. This was definitely a tasty dish that I would probably order again. The queso topping is pretty awesome but overall don t expect a mind-blowing dish  but rather a damn tasty enchilada to go with your even better margaritas as you start to drink the night away with friends.  Don t forget to leave without buying one of their shirts... you ll regret it when you get home if you don t 
Chuy's,266,Once again  I disagree with most people.  Big surprise.  I ate at the Chuy s at 183 Duval a few years ago because some friends wanted to go.  A thirty-minute wait and vomit-worthy food does not a happy Catherine make.  It also does not an Austin institution make  at least not in my mind.  How can you have terrible food and still be considered the top cock of Austin Tex-Mex   See the last paragraph for my theory.  A few weeks ago I decided that I wanted to give Chuy s another go.  Perhaps I went on an off day.  Maybe the Chuy s I went to the first time stinks but the others are good.  So many people in this city love Chuy s so much  that that must have been the case  I thought.  So I finally decided today to throw my money away and give Chuy s a try for lunch.  I d like to stress that this review is only about the food.  I cannot comment on the service  decor  ambiance or parking at this location  as I had my food delivered to my office by Eat Out In.  I ordered the Comida Deluxe  2 cheese enchiladas  1 crispy beef taco  2 chicken flautas  and chile con queso .    I was excited when the delivery guy handed me a sizeable bag of tortilla chips  but my excitement quickly faded  as if I had been chewing Fruit Stripe gum  when I saw the piddly 2-oz Solo ramekin of queso  see pics .  Someone else commented that the queso tastes like Tostitos queso  and I have to concur.    The refried beans tasted like leather and cigars.  What the hell are they doing in the kitchen    Beans shouldn t taste like a ranch.  The rice was dry and overcooked  so one bite of that crap was too much.  The enchilada sauce tasted like ketchup that spent 15 years in prison.  What I mean by that is  it tasted like some rancid plain tomato sauce and Chef Boyardee had a love child.  Wow  that s the second time in 24 hours I ve used the phrase  love child  in a Yelp review  I need a thesaurus.  The enchiladas themselves were bland  and something tasted off about the corn tortillas.  I scraped some of the cheese out of the enchiladas and dipped it in my ramekin of sour cream.  FYI  I got more sour cream than I did queso.  Oh  and the enchiladas were hard to cut through.  My plastic fork broke during one of my attempts.  The chicken flautas were the only decent things on the plate  so I ate those and threw everything else in the garbage where it belonged.  Chuy s gets two stars for at least including some spice in their food  and for being slightly better than Jardin Corona.  Perhaps I ll go back and try the Kool-Aid.  It must really pack a wallop  seeing as how so many people worship Chuy s like a golden idol.
Chuy's,267,I ve been to Austin twice. Both times  I ended up coming to Chuy s more than once. This is my favorite place for Tex Mex. Don t be intimidated with the packed parking lot. Expect crowds any time of the day  but this place is huge and seating has never been a problem for my husband and me. I highly recommend the queso. It s perfect and amazing. I have tried multiple things and my 2 favorite entrees are the Elvis green chile fried chicken and deep fried avocado. These items are truly unique and incredibly delicious. Service has never been a problem. It s just a great place to enjoy amazing Tex Mex 
Chuy's,268,tex-met at its finest. Enormous margaritas  lots of food  chile rellenos  home made jalape o sauce  amp  weird decor.   Don t expect a friendly waiter to give his opinion  but expect plates the size of your face  amp  never ending chips.
Chuy's,269,I eat at this location once a year as it is a ACL Weekend tradition for my bestie and I to eat here before we enter the festival on Saturday.  It always begins with the Chile Con Queso and a side order of the creamy jalapeno sauce.  I always order the baja shrimp tacos with green chile rice and refried beans.  If I could use one word to describe this restaurant it would be consistent.  The queso isn t my favorite but  it is good and gets an extra thumbs up when I have the creamy jalapeno sauce to alternate to.  The tacos are always fresh  hot and have just the right spice level.  The green chile rice here may be one of my favorite rice dishes at any Mexican restaurant.  The refried beans are nothing special but  are decent.  I know this place can have a huge line waiting to get a table but  we get here right when they are opening and haven t had a problem.  The service is always friendly as well 
Chuy's,270,Chuy s is my favorite restaurant. It s just the best. The decor is fantastic and the food is great. I love the taco salad and enchiladas. The have happy hour 4-7 with a nacho cart   free queso  salsa  beans  ground beef and chips. How can you beat that. If you go during the summer grab a watermelon margarita and you wont have any regrets  Can get busy  but its worth the wait. Staff is friendly and makes the experience fun.
Chuy's,271,The parking lot is right off the road. Can be a bit sudden when you come upon the location. The parking lot doesn t seem that big but I ve always been lucky and have found a spot.  The one downside to this place is that there is always a wait. On average I ve had to wait 20 mins each time I ve been here  varies depending on party size . The interior is pretty cool. Because of the amount of people  it can get pretty loud in there sometimes. They have booths and tables.   Service was solid. Servers were friendly and welcoming.  The food is pretty good if you like TexMex. I personally really like the fajitas. The tortillas were pretty awesome  definitely a job well done. The place also has all you can eat chips and salsa. A word of caution on the salsa  it s a bit spicy.
Chuy's,272,As a native Southern Californian and a frequent traveler to Mexico  I m not usually a fan of TexMex or any overly americanized Mexican food. With that said  Chuy s is probably the best TexMex I ve had. I enjoyed the quirky and colorful decor  their queso dip is is one of the best I ve ever had  and the service is spectacular - especially considering the huge crowds Chuy s draws. . My wife and I each had the cheese and onion enchiladas  which I guess are also a  TexMex  dish. They were pretty darn good. I feel this place is a must if you re in Austin
Chuy's,273,Always Fun  Always Fresh  appeared at the top of my Chuy s receipt. I came here with three friends  two of whom are from the Austin area and had recommended the restaurant. We were seated after a twenty minute wait and given complimentary tortilla chips  salsa  and ranch. The waitress was friendly and professional  offering drink and entree recommendations. I ordered the Comida Deluxe  as seen in the picture . It was delicious platter that left me with nothing else to ask for. The portion is hefty at an affordable price. Would definitely come back. 10 10 experience.
Chuy's,274,I got the combo chicken and steak fajitas to go so I can t speak to the atmosphere. Took about 25 minutes to get the food on a Friday night at 8 30. The flour tortillas are definitely house-made and delicious  I just didn t think the rest of it was anything special. It was middle of the road Tex-Mex in my book.
Chuy's,275,I m in Austin from California. I found this place using Yelp. I m glad with the help of the Yelp family I found this place. It was amazing  I recommend to walk in let them know it s your first time and have the waiter let you know what the best items are. My waiter was Mathew  great guy  he let me know what food they where know for. I had a chicken enchilada and a Chile Relleno. It was so good  really made me rethink the quality of Mexican food in getting back in California.  Next time I am here I will be sue to stop by with my friends and family. Just amazing. Thanks again Mathew 
Chuy's,276,Hot damn.  This place looks like Pee-Wee s Playhouse  but they serve up food straight from heaven.  The chips were hot when they arrived at the table  score  .  The salsa was hot  score again  .  I ordered the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom  and hated that I had to say such stupid words to get my food.  But the waiter immediately said I d ordered the best thing on the menu.  It s shredded chicken and cheese with boom-boom sauce - made with cheese  New Mexican green chiles  tomatillos  green onions  cilantro and lime juice.  I inhaled every amazing bite.  When I arrived  I was suffering from a cold.  But the food and a very fine margarita nursed me back to temporary  drunken health.  Austin is such an amazing food town.  I m very happy to have found yet another killer addition to my map of marvelous meals 
Chuy's,277,Chuy s is a good casual place if you re looking for Tex-Mex and a cool environment.   Most nights around dinner the place is PACKED  but luckily they offer self-serve chips and salsa and drinks while you wait.  This really helps to ease the pain of waiting in my opinion.  I usually get the chicken flautas with the chipotle sauce and it never disappoints.  I ve been many times and am pleased with the flavorful selection of margarita flavors.  Typically  I m a strawb girl  but the last time I tried the mango and may have a new fave.  The happy hour nacho truck is dangerous because its all you can eat chips  refried beans  QUESO  free   and red salsa  ugh  its wonderful.
Chuy's,278,It was my first time trying Tex-Mex when I visited Chuy s last friday. It s a Mexican chain restaurant located throughout Texas. Each location has unique decorations that reflect the character of the city its in. This one in Austin is filled with loud colors and bright designs  very Texas meets the artistic cowboy.   As far as the food goes  I ordered an enchilada and a chile rellano. Vegetarians please note the beans do not have lard in them and the rice is not cooked in chicken broth. The food was okay  nothing extraordinary but definitely filling. The thing that stands out about Chuy s is their jalape o sauce and boom boom sauce. You can dip anything in it and it ll automatically add wonderful flavors to your meal. Get some on the side so you can also dip your chips in it.
Chuy's,279,This was quite possibly one of the best experiences I ve had in Austin. The food was fantastic  but our service was absolutely incredible. We had the pleasure of sitting at the bar  with Mike G. He was so friendly  accommodating  and happy. His smile was infectious  He was professional  personable  super positive vibes. He went a step above and beyond at every point. He is a fantastic bartender  and so was Dan G     Marta was also equally impressive. The staff here rocks   We had the amazing jalape o ranch  chips  amp  salsa to start. And LOVED the steak burrito. Big enough for 2   Enjoy  I ll be back 
Chuy's,280,I ve heard this was the place to come for Tex Mex -- so I came with high expectations and was sorely disappointed. The wait was long and confusing  we were standing there for close to 20 mins while other waiting customers were informed they could wait by the tables near the bar -- I ve also seen those tables being given to the waiting customers. No one came to talk to us while we wait and they seemed very disorganized. After we got our table it took another 10mins for our server to greet and get our drinks order -- which came twice  one was by a different person   the other by our server . I guess our bad luck was because of having a less than attentive server -- we saw another server who was doing wonderfully and being super attentive -- it was another 10 minutes before the server took our order. The food was decent nothing spectacular  the only thing I liked was the chips -- we had so much of it because of the wait for the server   take order   food to arrive we were pretty much full. I won t miss this place for sure.
Chuy's,281,This was the first restaurant I ate at when I moved to Austin.  Everybody had to tell me   ohhh this is where the Bush twins got arrested for underage drinking.   So I m thinking what a bunch of douchebags must inhabit this space to have made a point of calling the cops on college girls for doing what college girls do.  Well I was actually impressed with it once I experienced it although I could certainly see some douchebags in the restaurant.  The ambiance is all Elvis and 50 s 60 s to the maximum.  Generally the food is pretty good for Tex-Mex and the drinks are above average.  Their Mexican Martini was quite an interesting experience for me and I indulged in more than a few of those on my first visit as I was drowning away the loss of everything I owned in Hurricane Katrina.  I used to also really enjoy the prickly pear margaritas here but I was really punched in the gut with disappointment on my most recent visit when I was informed they didn t have that flavor anymore.    Overall a nice place for a local chain to grab a good and quick meal or linger over some drinks.  They also have a great happy hour with free chips  salsa and queso.   Bring back my prickly pear   
Chuy's,282,Lat time I came here was 12 years ago  thankfully nothing really has changed  which is a rare thing.  Quality of food is still great   Got my standard bluecorn tortilla chicken enchiladas with green chili hot sauce...couldn t be more satisfied.  I ll be back before I leave town again for sure 
Chuy's,283,Today I ate at Chuy s- Makenna was my waitress. First she gave me the wrong rice. I told her I wanted the green rice and she said ok...I saw that she never even wrote it down on her notepad when she was taking my order.   Later she asked me for a to-go box and never brought it. Then she came back and asked me again for a to-go box. I said yes...I would like a box and the check please. She then says ok and quickly proceeds to grab my plate of half eaten food  take it away and stack dirty plates on top of it from another table.   Half of the meal I paid for was wasted and I have no leftovers now. Very disappointed. She either has bad hearing or doesn t pay attention to the customer.   I haven t eaten at Chuy s in awhile and I don t think that I will again.
Chuy's,284,This is my girlfriend a favorite place in Austin. We came straight here from the airport. The chips are solid  thin and crispy and ever flowing. The creamy jalape o  a ranch type dip  was great. The bean and cheese was massive and pretty good. I had a combo of enchilada and taco. Both solid but not great.  The place is fun. Start in the bar and have a drink. Grab some chips and salsa. It s got some fun Elvis decor. Staff is very friendly.
Chuy's,285,Consistently exceptional food with a touch of uniqueness served in large portions by friendly and attentive staff  for very reasonable prices.  This Chuy s is what most other restaurants should strive to emulate.  Don t overlook the Vegetarian Combo  which for this dedicated carnivore is still a delicious  hearty  and very satisfying meal.  Also  if you re leaning toward Boom-Boom  don t hold back - you won t be disappointed 
Chuy's,286,Date of service  Jan 19  2015 Meal  Lunch  eat in  All Ratings out of 10   Quality of food  7 Food to Spend Value  8 Quality of Service  7 Overall Rating  7   Chuy s is another example of an Austin original that spread out in Austin  branched out to other parts of Texas  and then exploded into other parts of the country. Locations haven t made it out west  at least not to Seattle   and since I hadn t eaten at one in quite some time  I decided to eat at the original location when I visited Austin.  They always start you off with chips and salsa  but you have to request the creamy jalapeno sauce  and believe me you want to. The best description I can think of is a jalapeno flavored ranch dip  but this doesn t quite do it justice. What it is is delicious  and I love it on my chips even more than the tomatillo sauce. To go along with the chips we also ordered the Queso Compuesto  which is chile con queso with ground sirloin  guacamole and pico  and it is bursting with flavor and very tasty.  Since I hadn t been in a while I had trouble deciding on what to order  but I finally went with the Chile Rellenos  which is one of their specialties. They have 4 different varieties  and I went with the shrimp and cheese. The plate is a huge amount of food  with 2 very large chile rellenos  rice and beans. The rellenos had a nice crispy outside and were stuffed inside. The peppers themselves were not very hot but did have a good flavor to them. The rice and beans were also quite good  and I was completely stuffed when I was done.  The original Chuy s location has a pretty cool flair about it  though most of the locations try to imitate the wild look and feel of the d cor. The prices are extremely reasonable  less than  10 for my rellenos plate   meaning you get a ton of value  and food   for what you pay. The service was attentive  though we went late afternoon when it wasn t quite so busy. They definitely can get very busy  particularly on the weekend. The overall result is a solid Tex Mex meal with Austin flair that should leave your appetite completely satiated  so if you are looking for good Tex Mex don t hesitate to head over to Chuy s.
Chuy's,287,This place was phenomenal  Huge portions  a great staff  and amazing food. Very authentic as well.
Chuy's,288,Many thanks to this Chuy s for hosting my visiting family of twelve  complete with six kids   for lunch during Thanksgiving week.  From the host to our server  everyone was remarkably nice and patient despite our table clearly being a hot mess.  I m sorry  and thank you.
Chuy's,289,Amazing service and top notch Tex mex. A colleague of mine from Texas told me to try it when it town so I scouted out this location  the original location  and everything about it was perfect. Cool insides in what looks like a pretty vintage  classic building. Staff was so friendly and accommodating. Loved my three steak green chili tacos  their special rice  the charros beans  the salsa  the queso. The tortilla chips just kept flowing. Would return in a heartbeat for this style of food. And who knew  they ve got shrines to Elvis and a special side door for hippies  
Chuy's,290,Really cool setup.  Great food if ur looking for TexMex.  Place gets busy but they are able to seat you pretty quickly.  Server was top notch and very budget friendly 
Chuy's,291,We decided to do take out knowing it might not be as good as in the restaurant. Well  we were definitely surprised. If was just as good  Everything was packed correctly and it was nice to have it delivered  Definitely we ll do this again 
Chuy's,292,Came by for some authentic Tex-Mex food with my girlfriend over the Memorial Day weekend.   The wait staff helped get us seated right away. This place was packed so it was nice to see how quickly we could be seated despite how busy this place was.  Our waitress quickly got us our drinks. My girlfriend and I ordered a round of frozen margaritas. They were very tasty but unfortunately lacked alcohol. They might have had some tequila in it but it tasted mostly like Margarita mix. Pretty disappointed in the drinks considering they are so highly raved about.  We ordered the guacamole and enchiladas and were satisfied with our meals.
Chuy's,293,We got the Elvis green Chile fried chicken and it was so good. The tortilla soup was amazing as well. I had such a good experience here and our waiter was amazing. We asked for ginger ale and they didn t have any but she recreated it and it tasted almost the same
Chuy's,294,The original  A trip to Austin is not complete without the taste of Chuy s green chili stew. It s HOT  dang hot  nose running but you can t stop eating hot  and man is it good. The rest of the menu is just as flavorful featuring FRESH  home-made sauces  great marinated and well-cooked meats and veggies  and well-seasoned sides.  Even the chips and salsa are fantastic as they bring you a bit of homemade buttermilk ranch dip to cool your mouth from the fantastic fiery salsa.  I have honestly never been to any of the other chain locations as I love this one so much.   Time your visit wisely  if you try to get in here on a Friday evening of course you are going to have to wait - go between rush times  2-5pm if possible  and you ll be able to walk right in.
Chuy's,295,The wait was surprisingly short and they have a nacho bar and drinks while you wait  I got the Baja Tacos and a margarita and I was stuffed  I love big portions  . The best part about the experience were the servers - they were so friendly and quick.
Chuy's,296,Wish there was outdoor seating at the Barton Springs location. Inside is loud and kitschy  almost like a Tex-Mex diner. There is pretty much always a wait  and not a lot of places to hang out while you re waiting  especially if it s cold or raining. But the food is consistently good and the service is always cheerful. We bring all our out-of-town visitors here for that  Keep Austin Weird  vibe.
Chuy's,297,Chicka Chicka boom boom  will there be enough room  No way Jose  I couldn t finish my combo at Chuy s  My chili relleno was crunchy and tasty and huge with a fresh roasted Anaheim pepper  and my Chicka Chicka boom boom enchilada was yummy too. Tex mex is cheesy and saucy  and a fun change from Southern Cali Mexican food.  My fav was the chili relleno  New Mexico style. They fire roast an Anaheim chili pepper and fill it with your choice of fillings  and then batter and fry it til it s crunchy. Ask for your fav sauce on the side for your crunchy chili relleno. The hatch green chili sauce has a tasty kick.   Combo  4 came with my choice of an enchilada and a chili relleno plus rice and beans for  8.99. I don t remember whether there was any additional charge for particular items  but our total bill was very reasonable.   Service was friendly and informative. The decor is colorful  casual and cheerful. We enjoyed our meal at Chuy s.
Chuy's,298,Food solid  above average  liked the chips bar while you wait.....tender steak - good stuff 
Chuy's,299,Love this place always a good Mexican place to eat at they have good service and nice cold beer
Chuy's,300,Fantastic food and great service. We were all very thirsty from spending all day in the sun and our waitress kept up with our constantly empty water glasses. I got the chicken combo and it was amazing  but not super filling so I added a side of rice and beans. The side was a generous portion and less than  2. Entire meal with tip was about  16  including the good tip I gave due to the good service. The restaurant itself was really cool too. Definitely recommend this place.
Chuy's,301,The OG of the OG. CHUYS Is actually the love of my life. If you are reading this I hope CHUYS this location  is your next destination.   It just so happens that when I went to chuys April 1st  it was my birthday. No April fools here. seriously  it was my birthday and the electricity went out. That didn t stop me from eating  all you can eat  nachos at the nacho bar. I m really not sure if it was all you can eat but it was help yourself and no one was stoping this girl on her birthday. Typically  I don t grub digity down but on this day I ate so much I went into a food coma. I had some really really strong tequila and lime juice drinks and some really great food at the Original CHUYS...id say that makes for a damn good birthday  electricity or not    I wish I could remember our servers name JD  DJ  DIPPY-D   dude idk but she was really good  Nice  friendly  helpful  fun...she was rockin   Could have extended happy hour for us due to electricity  but hey she still rocks.   We will be back CHUYS and I won t be waiting another year for my birthday but I do expect some  more delicious Sopapillas.
Chuy's,302,I ve been to a few other Chuy s locations  and I d say this one was about average compared to them. I stopped by this past Sunday evening  and it was packed...which could explain the very slow service I received  or maybe it was because I came alone. The food I ordered was okay  when I finally got it. It wasn t very fresh  but the flavor was good overall. As far as decor and ambience go  this chain is very family friendly and well-lit  and this particular location is very well-decorated  the one absolute positive I can mention . There were classic care memorabilia body replicas on the wall  and other fun odds and ends on display. I would probably go back for lunch  but never again on a Sunday evening.
Chuy's,303,Went here for dinner with coworkers and it was delicious  We were there on a Tuesday and it was busy. This place is pretty well known so there was a little bit of a wait.   The staff was very friendly and was very helpful. Being out of town  I wasn t sure what was good. The spicy jalape o dip and the queso were a great way to start. The jalape o dip was basically ranch dressing with peppers  but man  was it tasty. I would def eat it again.   Someone I was with got the Fritos pie  Tuesday special . It looked incredible but also like a heart attack on a plate. If I didn t care about my health I would definitely have gotten it. Everything that my party are was delicious. You really can t go wrong with anything. The only thing we were sure about was that we definitely did not have room for dessert 
Chuy's,304,very cool that the food comes out so fast and consistent. They have a food runner which is appreciated. only thing was the margarita on the rocks was very tart  way too much lime juice. sometimes a batch of limes is tart and other times not so much so that should be up to the bartender to decide but it was obnoxiously off balance so i couldn t order another one. but other than that the place is so consistently amazing.
Chuy's,305,We love Chuy s and  their happy hour especially    ... Great spot for clients  visitors  and friends - we love taking people there. It s fun  nice  friendly  and great prices too  ... We re hoping they add something new to the nacho bar  just for fun soon  - 
Chuy's,306,Was very busy for a rainy Tuesday night  Half an hour wait when we arrived  which only ended up being about 15 minutes. Free chips and salsa when you dine. Highlight of the night was the service  Attentive  friendly  helpful and gave us some free ranch jalape o dip  Ordered the battered fish tacos. They were ok  nothing amazing. The batter was thick and dry. The portion sizes were huge as it comes with salad  rice and beans too  Two of us shared the entree after some chips and salsa to start.  Cool vibe and pretty cheap too  just not amazing food to rave about.
Chuy's,307,Great Tex mex and a must if you re in the Austin area  The salsa is great and they keep bringing it unless you tell them to stop. Their enchiladas and sauces are great  Ask for the jalape o ranch as a dip on the side you will thank me later
Chuy's,308,I normally go to the William Cannon location but I met up some friends at the Zilker location and had a great experience. Was seated within 5 minutes  on a Saturday night  and our waitress was wonderful. As always  love the jalape o ranch and chicken floutas. Yum 
Chuy's,309,A few friends and I came here after spending a couple hours at the lake cleaning and then kayaking.  We were all tired and hot and thought that the perfect place to start the afternoon would be at Chuy s.  Once our whole party was there  they won t seat you until then   we were seated within 5 or 10 minutes.  They quickly took our drink orders brought us chips.  I also love how they have a self serve chips and salsa bar for refills.  I ordered the house margarita and a beef burrito with hatch chili sauce.  The burrito was quite large and filled with meat.  I wish there were more veggies inside but that is a minor issue.  The hatch chili sauce was no where near as spicy as I was expecting.  It was supposed to be their hottest sauce but their was not much of a kick to it.  Overall  the meal was great and the margarita tasted great for the price.  The place was pretty loud but still a ton of fun.
Chuy's,310,To go service was the most disappointing I ve had... food seemed extra salty to us  amp  I was told utensils were included but none were to be found.. welp. Thanks Chuy s...
Chuy's,311,Honestly  I wasn t too impressed. We ve got great Mexican food in California  so when my Texan friends were raving about this place I had high hopes  and expectations .   4 stars for service and a funky atmosphere. 2.5 stars for food.   I had a taco enchilada combo plate. Veggie enchilada which was very bland meh. Beef hatch taco which was actually quite tasty. Chips and salsa. Their chips are delicious - super light and crisp. Their salsa was also very good - lots of variety. The server brought me his two favorites  the Tomatillo and the Hatch  both of which were tasty. Everyone  including the friend I was with  seemed to rave about the jalape o ranch salsa but I didn t really see what the hype was about. Too ranchy for me  weird with chips IMO.   Anyways  overall it was ok but I wouldn t rush back. I m sure there are plenty of other awesome Mexican places to check out in Austin before circling back to Chuy s.
Chuy's,312,I have gone here for so many years   I absolutely love this place and there foods   While they do serve many Tex Mex dishes  this place is great for picky kids who don t want to try things.  They have chicken  cheese quesadillas and much more on the kids menu  I love there soups and pretty everything about this place   The only complaint I have is that the wait is sometimes a while but you can also go shop and stuff   The shirts they sell are also super cute   Love there queso and salsa bar too   You should definitely give Chuy s a try  
Chuy's,313,I ordered lunch with a few co-workers today threw GrubHub for noon it arrived at 11 45 am which was good. However the black beans guacamole and chips were not delivered. I called Chuy s the lady blamed it on GrubHub but not sure why because they just pick up the food. Poor service       I even ordered extra Creamy Jalapeno but couldn t eat with no chips.....
Chuy's,314,Mmm  mm good. Packed on a Friday night. I had the combo with a chili relleno and a chicken enchilada. The rice and beans were good  but I couldn t finish them or the chili. You can easily fill up on chips here. That jalapeno sauce tastes like ranch dressing  the salsa has kick  for sure. My guest had a chimichanga and they liked it. They treated and I got the tip. Delicioso. Got a lil loud due to busyness  and took our server a while to come back with my friend s cc  but she was super nice so no complaints really.
Chuy's,315,Staff here is great...as are the t-shirts they have for sale in the front.  The menu is very customizable  which is great. The downside is that this multiplies the possibility of receiving food that wasn t what was ordered. However  our food was really tasty.  The chile relleno was excellent...filled with ground beef and breaded with a flaky crust - similar to large panko.   The chips and white sauce that come before the meal are delicious. The white sauce is ranch mixed with cilantro  tomatillo  and other ingredients that add up to an addictive mix.
Chuy's,316,Great Tex-Mex spot with massive portions  Outstanding prices as well  went with a sampler platter to try out a few different things and wasn t disappointed. The house salsa was good and they have a chip bar that let s you get unlimited refills. The margarita was underwhelming though and tasted watered down.
Chuy's,317,So I ve been coming to this Chuy s almost my whole life. My parents brought me here as a kid and I still go all the time. I ve never had a bad experience at this location and the only down side I can think of is that it s usually always busy. But I couldn t take a star off for them being so good it s always packed  wouldn t feel fair.   They have tons of parking and a huge happy hour area where you can get drinks or have some appetizers while you wait for a table. Great place for after work drinks  family dinner  or even just lunch. You can also get anything to go and take it over to the park which is nice in the spring summer.
Chuy's,318,Probably not much to be said that hasn t already.  Another Austin  institution . Solid Tex Mex in its iconic original location.  The Elvis Presley platter is now my  go to  here  it s got a little of everything. Good frozen margaritas.
Chuy's,319,Nice little restaurant that I probably would not have found or considered were it not for the recommendation of a local. Surprisingly  the decor is heavily Elvis-influenced. The food was great. I had the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom enchiladas with double rice. The plates are huge. I only had room for half of it. I also had a frozen watermelon margarita during Happy Hour  it was tasty but weak.
Chuy's,320,Yes  yum  yes  yum  yum   We went around 7PM on a Saturday night.  No wait for 2 people.  I mention the wait because just a few Saturdays earlier we tried to go around the same time with 3 people and were told it would be about an hour.  You can call ahead and they can give you an idea of how long your party will be waiting.  We sat in the hub cab room which is literally a room where the ceiling is COVERED in hub caps.  The whole restaurant is very eclectic and a lively  fun atmosphere   Our hostess  servers and food runners were all extremely helpful and friendly.  I have 0 complaints regarding the service   My husband had a house margarita  but they had several options as far as specialty margs and cocktails.  He said it was very delicious and my pregnant self looked on in envy as he sipped it down.  The chips and salsa that come standard on every table were top notch.  The salsa was a bit spicy  I am more sensitive to spice though.   We ordered some guacamole to really make the night special and it was great   I got the combo fajitas for one  that always sounds so lonely   and my husband got the flautas   Both were amazing and came with a ton of fixings.  I think this will be the new spot we take out of towners to taste legit Tex-mex when they visit us from Florida 
Chuy's,321,Atmosphere was good. Place was busy. Went for dinner. Waiter was great. Attentive. Food was good. Chicken burrito was said to be good. It was huge  My beef tacos were good  steak was a little over done for my liking. I Recommend Chuy s.
Chuy's,322,This has been another and continued wonderful experience here at Chuy s. They have the most addicting creamy jalape o dip and tomatillo sauce for their enchiladas.   Our waiter at this location is Lucas. He s a wonderful waiter and has made this dining experience awesome. If you come here  ask for Lucas.
Chuy's,323,So so good. The nachos  the enchiladas  the margaritas  the waiters - all of it. I m a vegetarian and my fianc  is not and we both had an awesome time stuffing ourselves here. Worth the wait  which shouldn t be too bad if you go on the earlier  6ish side  and you ll also get their happy hour deal on some appetizers 
Chuy's,324,Heard so much hype about this place  and really it was just okay. Expected more from a tex mex chain out of Texas.
Chuy's,325,Stopped by this place coming back from Pedernales Falls since my roommate and I were hungry and craving enchiladas. This place also popped up during my search for dog friendly places  so that was a checkmark in my book. However  when we got there  there were only 2 tables available outside with 4 seats in total. Pretty small place then if they are considered dog friendly. It s also first come  first serve for those tables  so keep that in mind.  I had ordered the Elvis combo  and it was definitely filling  Not sure how I feel about the actual dish though. I suppose it was alright  the best part about it though had to be the beef Tex-Mex enchilada. The other two  cheese and chicken  were not so impressive. The chicken was dry  and the cheese wasn t quite there in the flavor department. The rice could ve also been better. If you need a place to stuff your face though  I think Chuy s would be a good place to go. You sure get more than enough on your plate for a good price.
Chuy's,326,A group of us were visiting from NYC and this place came highly recommended for its queso and margaritas. It definitely did not disappoint. Best queso I have had so far. The service was unbelievable  super nice and helpful. Food was subpar but that s not what we came for  if you want good food  check out the group of food trucks right next door - amazing .
Chuy's,327,What an incredible tradition in Austin. Introduced my father in law to Chuy s about three months ago and he loves it. Today we had Staci B as our waitress for lunch and bless her heart  she treated my father in law with kid gloves. He has hearing and memory issues and she wasn t rude or short with him when he didn t have answers to questions of  re-fried beans and rice okay  . I winked and she got it.  A note to the owners of this great place  When hiring waiters  please consider the less shapely ones. The guys with butts that sag  have no shape  and pants that don t fit. The guys you have working there now are complete distractions and make it almost impossible to eat and enjoy margaritas.  On a more serious note  you have created a great place to enjoy a great meal and a great drink. I have been coming to this location since  85  never disappointed and always happy to be here. The food is always amazing and always have  to go  plates. Thanks for the many years of great food and service.
Chuy's,328,Wow I love this place  first time here but not the last one. Love the atmosphere here  lots of parking spot good and friendly servers  good food salsa is awesome and the house margaritas wow. I highly recommend to come here for dinner you will really enjoyed it.
Chuy's,329,Great service. Great food.  Great drinks. Must visit in Austin if you like freshly prepared Mexican food.
Chuy's,330,Excellent lunch  Tasty food  large portions  funky interior  and wonderful service. I had the chicka chicka boom boom - very good. My husband the Elvis plate - very good too and TONS of food  he skipped dinner and breakfast . Would definitely recommend this place 
Chuy's,331,After reading so many reviews on here  I decided I needed to try this place myself  I love how they have a waiting area you can order drinks and apps. We ate a lot of chips and salsa while we waited  which made the wait fly by.  We had a 40 min wait at 9pm on a Friday .   Once we were seated  I ordered the enchilada that was a special that night - believe they called it an avocado enchilada  but there wasn t much avocado on it. I enjoyed the enchilada  but was a bit spicy. The rice and beans were spicy  which I was surprised about. Boyfriend ordered a taco salad  which he thought was nothing special. He got the jalape o sauce everyone raves about on here - it is glorified ranch dressing. I laughed when I tried it.   Overall  this is a classic Tex-Mex place I will be returning to 
Chuy's,332,Waited an hour for a to go order and it was cold..  had to ask for the manager 3 times.  Never going back.  The food is horrible anyway. Shame on you chuy s.
Chuy's,333,Chuy s is a Barton Springs staple. You can walk from the park to the restaurant  which is a plus in my book since the parking lot is pretty tiny. If you drive  you might have to find street parking elsewhere since every time I ve been it s crowded.  Speaking of crowded  go to Chuy s expecting that you ll have to wait. Fortunately  you can grab a seat at the bar and have some chips and salsa. The salsa is actually pretty spicy  so I usually stick to the creamy jalapeno sauce  which is my favorite part of Chuy s..it s so goood    The food itself is solid tex mex  and I recommend getting any of their enchiladas or weekly specials.
Chuy's,334,Over a week ago  we worked with Chuy s staff to arrange a dinner for 25 at their restaurant tonight. Today  when we called to double check all was set  they informed us that other groups were now in ahead of us  groups that were clearly added after we made our arrangements  and we might have to wait an hour or more. I now have to move 25 people  a large tab and tip  and my long-time enthusiasm for Chuy s to a new restaurant. Jam s.
Chuy's,335,After swimming at Barton Springs  Monday  and Canoeing on Ladybird Lake  Tuesday  it was a unanimous decision between my girlfriend and our empty stomach that Chuy s was THEE GO TO  She had been here a few times prior and raved about it. I m from California and there is no shortage of taco carts and Mexican food spots there  trust me . We stopped in  wait staff and hostess were all very friendly  and there was no shortage of guest in the building which is always a good sign  had no problem getting a seat though. We came during happy hour  so the drinks we strong and college student affordable. I opted for the self serve nacho bar. EASILY the best chips I ve come in contact with. Light and crispy  WARNING  The topping will completely destroy  said chips  if left on top for more than two minutes   DONT TALK JUST EAT  Love this place.
Chuy's,336,Always have a place in my heart for Chuy s.  Great TEX-MEX.  I love hearing the loser hipsters bitch about how Chuy s doesn t capture the true essence of Mexican cuisine.  Well No Freakin  Derr  It s not supposed to be authentic Mexican cuisine.    This place was one of the pioneers in creating what we all now know as Tex Mex and it still has awesome food  great atmosphere and nice staff.  If you want tripas  and menudo  and lengua  with a raspa  you better go find a taqueria. This place does Tex Mex well and won t apologize for it.  Now go order a big margarita and eat a crapload of chips and queso  
Chuy's,337,Great Tex Mex and fun atmosphere... BUT I spent our entire meal soaking wet after our waitress spilled a glass of ice water down by back. It was an accident and just water- so not a huge deal-but it would have been nice if she had made more of an effort to apologize and help me dry off. All she did was offer to bring more napkins...
Chuy's,338,Great food and exceptional service. We ordered the appetizer plate  1940 calories. The plate is big enough for 2 or 3 people as the main entree.
Chuy's,339,I loooove some good Mexican food and drinks  and Chuy s is just that... literally  just that. The seating is pretty limited- they have this entire floor area with tables and booths reserved just for waiting... why exactly  I have no idea. When we got our table  our waitress just wasn t having it  it seemed. She was pretty standoffish  and some other guy had to come in and we was pretty rough around the edges also. While the food was good  the prices just didn t cut it for me and it didn t seem worth it to come. Overall if you re looking for  overpriced  good Mexican food and drinks  check them out  I ll be sticking to other spots.
Chuy's,340,I really like the decorations and the fact that they have an Elvis Presley shrine. I ve been to this Chuy s location twice and it was great both times. Their chicken quesadilla  nachos  and flan were really good.
Chuy's,341,Menu has some great choices  food was tasty  check was more affordable than we expected  and our server Ashley is fantastic 
Chuy's,342,Cant go wrong here.  Great food.  Great prices.  Great service.  Great drinks.  There could be a wait.  That s because the word is out and everybody knows this is the place to be.  Best location of all the Chuys.  Try the fried avocados or deluxe chicken enchiladas.
Chuy's,343,We are visiting in town this weekend for the Formula 1 races and decided to try out Chuy s. We were told that the seating near the bar was open seating  which looked more comfortable then the back corner the host was trying to seat us at which was crowded . We sat and watched servers and what I assume to be a manager walk by and say nothing to us not even offer a drink of water. At about 10 mins of waiting someone finally spoke but told us we couldn t order off the full menu unless we moved. If I could give this place negative stars I would.
Chuy's,344,I ordered the spicy chicken enchiladas which came with an interesting cream sauce  beans and rice. I enjoyed their chip station with homemade salsa. I also had a lime strawberry margarita. Great pit stop 
Chuy's,345,I hate to write this review because I usually only like to write good reviews but today was the second time that I ve been to this location and the staff completely ignores me and doesn t come to check on me to take my order.  The first time the bartender saved me from writing a review because he was super sweet and apologized for the overlook but this time it just seems like the staff doesn t care and keeps passing the table without asking how I m doing or if they can help me with anything. Not sure if I ll ever go again but I hope they step up their game because it used to be my favorite neighborhood place to go.
Chuy's,346,An Austin staple is what I have been told and it fits the bill for perfect Tex-Mex craving as far as I m concerned. The space just looks like an institution with its quirky style and decorations. The restaurant will most likely be packed but your service will not be lacking by any means as our waitress was prompt and professional. The menu is large and has many favorites but the key distinction is the flavors in their dishes are better than most. I had to go with the Elvis memorial platter and it was filling in all its cheesy spicy deliciousness. Overall the place is fun  unpretentious and enjoyable. You know what you are getting here and this style of unchanging is something I can appreciate.
Chuy's,347,My favorite place in Austin  Went when i was in college and took my kids back after 25 years and kids lived it 
Chuy's,348,Great place  Prompt service   we love the Chicka chicka boom. Highly recommend to try to Tex-Mex place at Chuy s. The kids loved it ..I want to come back again
Chuy's,349,I came in to this location due to its nearness to Zilker Park. We were so hungry after the third day of ACL fest and decided to check out something nearby to eat. I was pleasantly surprised by how short the wait was considering a mob of people walking down the same street at the same time all ready to eat and drink. For six people  they quoted us 45 minutes  but the wait time was more like 30. We really didn t even care about the wait because we helped ourselves to the free chips and salsa at the back of the restaurant. The chips were thin and crispy and perfect with the fresh salsa.  We also ordered the queso and guacamole to start up the meal. Honestly  I could ve been happy with just the dips and chips  but I settled on the chicken special place for the variety. It came with an awesome shredded chicken chalupa  a chicken fajita sauce taco  and a side of guacamole. You really can t beat eight dollars for that plate  which I would order again. Of all the Chuy s locations  I love this one for the kooky decor and the service was outstanding. I couldn t believe how good of service we got on such a busy night. Maybe they re used to it  but kudos to this staff 
Chuy's,350,The service was terrible tonight.  They got two of our plates wrong. We had a party of six. The tortillas were raw. The manager came by and picked up our plates when we were not done. And to make it worse they were not happy when we asked for our military discount. We had to  ask for drink refills repeatedly. It was very disappointing dinner to  a say the least. If we ever eat at a Chuys again it will be a different location.
Chuy's,351,Came here on a whim as it was recommended to us by a lyft driver. This place was packed on a Saturday around 5. The menu has many options  and a ton of choices for vegetarians. I had a vegetarian plate with an enchilada and a chili Relano. The chili relano was one of the best I ve had and the batter was perfect. The  mild  sauce was pretty spicy. My husband had the chuychanga which he said was awesome   The price was super reasonable and portions were huge. Would highly recommend 
Chuy's,352,Heard a lot about this place so I made it a point to check it out. It was better than advertised. Great staff. Great service. Outstanding attention to the diner. Probably the best Tex-Mex I have had in Austin as most of these places are blah. Was informed it was an Austin tradition. The enchiladas are fantastic and the portions are big. Even the chips and salsa to start off with are great.
Chuy's,353,Chuy s happy hour cannot be beat   The margaritas are only about  3 and there is a free nacho bar.  The only things is trying to find seating.  It s such a popular place  that it can fill up pretty fast.  However  I continue to go back time and time again because it s a deal that just cannot be beat.  They sometimes have new margarita flavors at random times which keeps it interesting.  They also celebrate Elvis Presley s birthday.  The time that I went  they had an awesome impersonator  a huge birthday cake for all customers  and Elvis themed margarita cups that you could take home.
Chuy's,354,Very good late lunch   they were still very busy but service staff were good and friendly. My wife Had the Elvis and I ask if it came flour tortillas and the server said no with corn tortillas and I said we want flour   well the enchilada came made with flour   but they were good a 4. I had the Baja fish tacos grilled and was very good   first time I tried the green chili rice and was tasty a 4 . The tea was not good old not fresh a 2.
Chuy's,355,This place has me addicted  The spicy Mexican martini used to be my favorite until they came out with the spicy cucumber  The creamy jalapeno is worth checking out if you haven t had it before. Queso is always great as well. I also recommend the tortilla soup or cobb salad if you are trying to eat healthier. P.S-They also make their own tortillas from hand   Cons  the wait usually sucks if you go during peak hours.
Chuy's,356,Pretty good Tex-Mex  The flavors aren t out of this world but overall a fun place to go. The margaritas are a bit pricey but they pack a punch. Good crowd that comes here and the aesthetic is fairly interesting.
Chuy's,357,It s Chuy s  so like  it s fine. Their menu is pretty expansive Tex-Mex  if you have a craving  you can find what you want here. The white sauce with the tortilla chips is a must  as are trying whatever the special of the day is. As one other reviewer said  though  it is heavily Americanized. It s like if your white uncle made Mexican food at home. Not that that s a bad thing  you like your uncle s food  but it s sometimes either too bland  or too salty  or too spicy. Or just OK.
Chuy's,358,We only stopped in for a drink but the food other people were getting looked better than the other two Tex mex places on Barton springs rd- and the margarita was definitely the best I have been waiting to get a really good spicy margarita while in Austin and they were all falling flat but this place has em and my wife had two different margs as well that were both great- bartender was awesome we got the history of the place and another patron at the bar had awesome conversation as well
Chuy's,359,I love chuys  They are sometimes really really busy but the food is always great  Drinks are so-so but they make up for it with their delicious chicken tortilla soup  It has green chilies and it just makes it for me    I will always order soup here when I m feeling sick. I sometimes ask for a side bowl of green chilies to put in my soup because I love it so much    Tortillas are amazing and omg their crunchy tacos   So goooood  Awesome and funny shirts too  I always get the cat themed ones 
Chuy's,360,Excellent food   Skip the wait and order your food at the bar. Ben  bartender  was AMAZING. So personable and great service. We will definitely be back 
Chuy's,361,Me and the wife found ourselves in Austin after visiting a few friends in Dallas.  After a nice walk in District Park we happened upon Chuy s.  The place was a little busy so there was a bit of a wait but after 10 or 15 minutes we lucked upon a couple seats at the bar.  The bartender whose name I don t recall was really nice and attentive.  He made us two margarita s  one blackberry and the wife had a  skinny   that were really tasty but not really all that strong.  I ll tell you my next complaint I d never had to make it before now but here goes......The portions are insanely huge   They brought so much food to us we ran out of space on the bar.  Now.....I enjoyed the food but I have to say it wasn t all that flavorful.  I ll use the example of the steak fajitas I ordered.  I really like to have some char on the meat and veggies but I didn t get it here.  There was a bit of a saving grace in the chips and salsa.  The salsa is really good but whatever that white sauce they serve along it is freakin  amazing.  TRY THAT PLEASE as it was the highlight of the meal.  Like I said not bad just not quite a winner.  I like the flavor in my Mexican to pop a little more.
Chuy's,362,Oh Chuys. It may be a chain Tex mex  but it s classic. It is packed for dinner on a weekday but there is plenty of seating  though you may have to maneuver between tables to get around. Plenty of parking in the back  and is conveniently located next to a bunch of food trucks. Food is very customizable  tell them what you don t want or want to substitute. Our group was in a hurry  and I think the waiter got that so he helped rush the check. Service is very nice and will offer you more free chips than you even want  Food is normal Tex mex  but it is decently priced.
Chuy's,363,Great service.  I went to the original Chuy s in Barton Spring.  It was great to eat after a nice swim at Barton Spring.  I ordered the taco plate of the day and the sweet tea was very refreshing.  Cool atmosphere.
Chuy's,364,First off  Chuy s is my favorite restaurant. I first had it in Houston. This location disappointed me because the servers are usually not the best. One time I came here  and there was a hair in my food. I politely informed my waitress  and she was extremely awkward and unprofessional about it. The manager came out to say sorry  but that was it. Afterwards  the server brought out a fresh plate for me and exclaimed   there you go  no hair   Really   I only gave it 3 stars because I love their food. Their creamy jalape o ranch is to die for  amp  I love their tomatillo salsa   I always get their cheese enchiladas with tomatillo sauce because the one time I tried it with chicken  the chicken was bland  amp  took away from the flavor. This is the first Chuy s location  so that s probably why the inside is pretty cramped.
Chuy's,365,If your on vacation don t waste your time here. The food was ok  but nothing special. The service was good  food came fast and the waiter was friendly but when in Austin I expect amazing food and this was just very basic.
Chuy's,366,Fantastic Tex-Mex food. Loved the Chalupa  amp  Enchilada combo  Enchilada was extra awesome  and Tortilla soup. Highly recommend the food  ambience  rustic  and our waitress
Chuy's,367,Chuy s has always been one of my favorite tex-mex joints  but bringing my boyfriend here for his first  real  Tex-Mex experience was a delight  think giving-your-kid-his-first-taste-of-cake-level delight   even if he kinda hates me now because I ve  ruined Mexican food  for him. To him  nothing we can get back home  Toronto  will ever compare to the Bacon-Wrapped  deep-fried Hatch Rellenos  a Hatch Chile Week Special  and Creamy Jalapeno Ranch. Almost two weeks later  and he still hasn t stopped talking about how  next level  the meal was. Sorry  not sorry  dude.   Also worth noting - great  moderately-priced mexi-marts and self-serve all-you-can-stuff-in-your-face chips and salsa while you wait for a table 
Chuy's,368,Coming from Chicago  where all Mex and Tex-Mex is the same bland and boring- Chuy s was a real treat.   Great ambiance- especially at the bar  where Mike and Matt were friendly and attentive.   Food was delicious and hot. Just the right spice. Incredible amount of food for the price. Couldn t possibly eat it all.   Will be back soon  Woohoo 
Chuy's,369,2nd time there and it was just as I remembered the first time. Outstanding food AND service and of course the atmosphere was fun and lively 
Chuy's,370,My best friend is obsessed with the Chuy s in VA so when I came to Austin for the first time I was pretty surprised to discover the OG Chuy s in Austin.  I ve been told multiple times by multiple Austin natives that Chuy s is a must for tex mex in this city.  After ordering the famous infamous Chicka Chicka boom boom back in VA and being incredibly disappointed I was hesitant to give Chuy s another shot however I can strongly say that I am so glad I did.  I came to this Chuy s for the first time last night and ordered the relleno  amp  enchilada combo   4  with the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom enchilada and the ground sirloin relleno. Despite coming here on a pretty full stomach I cleaned the plate pretty quick.  The chicka chicka boom boom sauce is as good as they say- a spicy  creamy and cheesy compliment to the tender chicken enchilada.  The relleno were pretty good but nothing too crazy compared to the enchilada  we ordered a side of the creamy jalape o dip w the complimentary chips and I poured some onto the relleno which was the perfect addition.  I will definitely revisit the Chuy s back in VA to see if I just caught them on a bad day and if their Chicka Chicka boom boom sauce is anything compared to this one.
Chuy's,371,Best Mexican food place ever. Tortillas are amazing  the salsas  the creamy jalape o sauce ahhh so good    I usually get the beef fajitas. Margaritas are worth it.
Chuy's,372,Chuy s is an Austin staple. The chips and salsa here are super yummy  especially the jalape o one. They have good drinks and a good happy hour. I recommend trying the appetizer plate to get a little taste of everything. You can t really go wrong with anything on the menu.
Chuy's,373,So let me start by saying that Chuy s does not have my favorite food in the world. Yet I seem to find myself here like once a week. Why   3.75 margaritas and free nacho cars from 4-7pm weekdays  y all.   I m a big fan of the frozen strawberry margaritas  but the regular flavor ones are pretty delish as well.   The free HH nacho cars are pretty awesome. The chips are good  and they come with yummy queso  beef  salsa  beans  and all kinds of other delicious goodies.   Getting seating in the the bar area can be difficult towards the end of HH  so come towards the beginning if you can. Also  note that the bar area only includes the area upstairs by the bar - the little section downstairs is for folks ordering food. All the waiters I ve had here have been fine to good.   Anyway  I usually pass on dinner here  but I never pass up HH   
Chuy's,374,Never again. So many tasty choices for Tex-Mex in Austin that this should be last on your list. Ordered tortilla soup and was really disappointed in how flavorless it was. Had two spoonfuls and that was it. Stuck paying for something I hated. Never again.
Chuy's,375,This the place  If you are looking for a great bartender to make you feel warm and fuzzy Dan is the man and btw he makes the best margarita in town hands down  Mikes pretty awesome too
Chuy's,376,Okay  the main dish here was not great  I had combo  2 Elvis Presley special . I didn t care for the soggy enchiladas  the low-effort queso chips that reminded me of movie theater nachos  or the boring beans.  But the service was fantastic  the cocktails were good  and our table completely demolished the queso appetizer. This  paired with the ambiance and location  made our visit to Chuy s highly enjoyable after our long drive in from Houston.
Chuy's,377,Parking was crazy but I knew this was a good place. Coming from Jersey  I havent tried Tex Mex other than chipotle and moes. Vibe is a typical college town vibe. Place gets busy on a Saturday night so it gets noisy but loved the atmosphere. Had margaritas and sangria which I thought was not too strong. Appetizers such as the quesadillas and taquitos were great. Had the Elvis Fried Chicken which cleaned up my sinuses that night. Spicy good.  Overall  this place is recommeded especially if you re craving for Tex Mex. Prices were about average for the restaurants in the area.
Chuy's,378,Went here last month and totally forgot to review it  We came to visit Austin for a few days and many people had recommended it to us. The salsas were amazing  the portions were good  and best of all  the people dining there and working were super sweet. You can tell this is a place the locals and tourists love. Highly recommend 
Chuy's,379,Went for lunch   we were seated promptly   the waitress was very helpful.  The food as always was food and plentiful.  Love that jalapeno ranch dip. I put it all over my enchiladas. One of my favorite restaurants 
Chuy's,380,So this place was recommended to us and we decided to check it out.  Food was great.  Mike  the bartender was fantastic. He was part of the experience and the reason I would return.  Prices good drinks better 
Chuy's,381,I love chuy s by far one of my favorite places. The salsa and queso compuesto are to die for.
Chuy's,382,Not the best food. It has a diner cafeteria atmosphere  and is a bit smelly. Queso is bad.
Chuy's,383,Great cafe where you eat at the altar of Elvis. Baja tacos are tasty  unique queso. Worth your time. Did I mention the altar of Elvis 
Chuy's,384,Chuy s is the BEST tex mex go to touristy place in Austin. When someone visits from out of state this is the place we go. It s the absolute best. Their jalapeno ranch dip is ADDICTING and I am sure many other people would agree with me. Every time I leave Chuy s I am so full. Their margaritas are awesome. I always get the  perfect margarita  with a floater and it always does the trick. I used to get the appetizer sampler when I went most times because I wanted to try everything  but lately I have been trying new things  The chicka chicka boom boom enchiladas are wonderful  Their tortillas are so soft and fresh. They also have a really good happy hour. Salsa  different sauces  and queso all at their salsa bar.
Chuy's,385,I just came here and this place has amazing Tex-Mex food. They have amazing waiters  amazing chefs  and amazing prices. Chuy s is a place where you can bring your family  or go on a date. I got Chicken fajitas and rice with beans. A really good thing is that you can add or take away things from your food. I totally recommend this place 100 .
Chuy's,386,Consistently enjoy the beef fajitas  frozen margaritas and chips salsa  amp  green avocado sauce  Great atmosphere and attentive staff.  The trick is to learn to not get full on chips and salsa before the food comes out  but then again - nothing wrong with having Chuy s leftovers for later 
Chuy's,387,Ok  bear with me on this one.  Chuy s is a nice Mexican restaurant.  It s got Margaritas  Enchiladas  Tacos  and a couple of their own twists  Boom-Boom Chicken .  It s all the regular Mexican stuff you ve seen before.  It s well executed but absolutely nothing special.  So why all the rave reviews and 4 and 5 star reviews   I mean seriously  if you look up the phrase  good  but unexceptional  in the dictionary you will find a picture of Chuy s.  How does it get 4 stars   5 stars   Really   Well since it s a Texas institution I ll use a Bush-ism to explain it.  I think this is a clear case of the  Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations.   It s a big world and while Chuy s is a perfectly good place to have dinner  it is one of a thousand similar places and therefore unexceptional.  3 stars.
Chuy's,388,I think Chuy s may have one of the best quesos in Austin - but it is not vegetarian for my V friends on there. They make it with chicken stock  just FYI.   I really love the food here and the service has always been really good. The wait is always forever. It doesn t seem to matter what day or time we go  it is always packed. Good thing for Chuy s  sad thing for customers - but still we wait. If you re lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar  they offer full menu there which is what we usually try to do.  I almost gave this place three stars though because for whatever reason  my stomach always feels really weird after we eat here. Maybe I just eat TOO much queso  or maybe it s something in the food  I don t know  but I ve avoided it recently for that reason. And I have a few friends who ve said the same thing.
Chuy's,389,Went for dinner here on an Austin visit with relatives.   Talk about crowded  for a Thursday night   Half hour wait.  But so worth it.  I LOVE Chuy s and I love this location  every time I visit Austin.  The nachos were incredible  amp  I got a side bowl of Hatch chile sauce to go with them.  We all loved it.  Thank you yet again Chuy s  and we ll see ya in September at the Dallas McKinney Ave location for my annual birthday dinner   
Chuy's,390,The original Chuy s was the best place to end our Austin trip. I was really craving some nachos before we left town and Chuy s delivered  Not the huge stack of chips I m used to  but far superior. We got the Panchos with chicken and a side of creamy jalapeno  as well as a couple margaritas. My partner went classic  and I opted for the frozen strawberry. Both great.  My only small complaint was that my water tasted weird  and my partner noticed the distinctive taste of soap. What   I am tempted to remove a star but I ll call it a fluke since they fixed it right away and over all seems like a great joint. We really liked our server A.P. I think we ll be back next time we re in town 
Chuy's,391,We ve been to Chuy s many many times in both Houston and Austin  but have never had a server better than the server we had tonight. We came pretty close to closing time and Lucas took better care of us than I could ever expect from a server. He was cheerful and took care of us exceptionally. He constantly checked back on us  made sure we had everything we needed  and made us feel like his only guests  even though we came in late  which we know is annoying . All in all  this was the best service we ve received in a long time and we will definitely be coming back here regularly. Thanks  Lucas 
Chuy's,392,For a place that is decorated like both the  50s and an Elvis shrine  it sure serves great Tex-Mex.   We were served chips and fresh salsa by a quick  funny gentleman who heard us wondering about our meals from about 10 feet away.  I m a dad  I hear everything   he quipped. He offered his suggestions  was super well-versed in all the food  and was really attentive.   Our entire table ordered margaritas  hey  it was past noon. fair game   and the fried avocado dish. Somehow they were able to stuff an avocado with chicken...I don t know how they did it  but I m glad that immaculate conception happened. It was the most delicious thing I had ever tasted.   If you re visiting  as we were   it s a good idea to stop in for a bite to eat before or after dropping by nearby Barton Springs. Probably after...otherwise you risk feeling like deadweight with 2 pounds of fried avocado in you...
Chuy's,393,This place was recommended to me by the receptionist at the hotel I was staying in north Austin. I took her advice  happened to arrive during happy hour  and discovered the nacho car  I tried not to go overboard with that  as I wanted to also try something from the menu. My waiter was an absolute delight and recommended the daily special  the chicken enchiladas. Everything was exceptionally good and appropriately spicy  which I really appreciated. My waiter brought me some extra Hatch green chile salsa to put on my enchiladas and to bring home with me. Margarita wasn t the best I ve ever had but solid. But the food was what really stood out. I can t believe this is a huge chain. Even the refried beans were excellent. Highly recommended by a visitor  me   who loves spicy food 
Chuy's,394,Given the years I ve lived in Austin  off and on  it adds up to almost a decade and I had never been to Chuy s.  The decor is really fun and that makes it worth at least one token trip.  Our service was very  very good  from the friendly hosts  to the fun  spot on service we got from Heather.   Unfortunately  the food wasn t so great.  I got the veggie combo  one veggie enchilada with ranchero and one cheese filled chili relleno.  Sounds great  right   Sadly  wrong.  Almost everything on the plate was incredibly bland.  The refried beans were excellent  perfectly seasoned and tasty  but something just isn t quite right when the beans are the best thing on your lunch plate.  The salsa was fresh and strangely addictive  but the chips were kind of meh.   I don t know that I d care to go again.  I still think Polvo s and Curra s have the best Tex-Mex in town.
Chuy's,395,Came here for dinner on a weekday and there was no wait. This is your typical Tex Mex with old time flair. I love the glittery booths and extensive menu. I ordered the stacked enchiladas with creamy tomatillo sauce and side of whatever the alternative to refried beans was. I forget what the dish was called. I was surprised by the stacked enchiladas but it really is in the name-these aren t rolled like traditional enchiladas. Instead you get three blue corn tortillas stacked on top of each other with cheese and chicken in between. The whole thing is then smothered in a sauce of your choice. The chicken didn t seem seasoned at all and the creamy sauce was actually kind of bland. The Mexican rice was as expected and the beans actually tasted like chili. My husband got a burrito with the same sauce except steak as the protein. It tasted very similar to my dish. Service was fast and friendly and they can answer any questions about the menu. It just wasn t for my taste. It s a fun place to visit if you re in the area and looking for predictable Tex Mex. They have fun shirts that parody recent movies  Parking is in a lot and wasn t an issue.
Chuy's,396,I m not from Texas. I m from California. And little do some know the true war that rages on the palates of certain mexican food lovers when trying to decide which is superior  Traditional or Tex-Mex.  Granted  I took the side of traditional  maintaining that the addition of mounds of cheese and fatty sauces did not a good mexican dish make. Yet my Texan friends continued to challenge me on this. So during the next trip to Austin  I took the  Tex Mex Challenge  - chosen destination  Chuy s.  First thoughts upon entering the 50 s kitsch-o-rama diner were oh - this is so over already. But we put our name onto the 45 minute waiting list  took a spot at the bar  ordered some margs and grabbed some chips and salsa from the salsa bar. Then  oh then  came the chili con queso.   4 baskets of chips  2 margaritas  and an entire vat of CCQ  that I might have actually poured straight down my throat at some point  later  I thought I was going to burst. I couldn t even dent the actual taco gordito combo I ordered  but my friend ordered the bacon-lobster enchiladas proclaimed them the  best enchiladas ever   so I guess they were good.  Although I can t fairly review much more than the drinks and chili con queso  in the end we decided the score was a straight tie. You win this time  Tex Mex  but I ll meet you next at a fish taco stand in TJ 
Chuy's,397,Two words  nacho car. No... you read that right. Not nacho bar. It s a car full of happiness. Free nachos        Doesn t get much better than that  Great nachos... great food... good drinks    fun atmosphere. I m impressed.... for being a chain Mexican place. Might be one of my favorites
Chuy's,398,Pretty decent food. But if you order food  even for pick up  make sure to ask for utensils and napkins if you need them. I ordered a tortilla soup to go and there was no spoon or napkin. I called in and was told I was supposed to ask for this if I wanted it and made to seem like it was my fault for not asking for this.
Chuy's,399,When on a recent visit to Austin   we met some friends for dinner. The parking lot was packed  but we were able to find a place to park our truck. The wait for a table was about 20 mins during peak dinner time. They offer chips  amp  salsa while we waited in the bar area.    I had the chicken fajitas soft tacos with the green chili  mexican rice  it was excellent. My husband ordered the daily special  the stuffed avcoado. The waiter returned  after taking our order to say they ran out of the special  amp  please make another choice. He choose the combo 1  which was a chili relleno and  a chicken enchilada. He was happy with his choice as was the others at our table.    The service was good  amp  fairly fast for the amount of customers being served.
Chuy's,400,Let me start out this review by saying -- My husband picked this place saying that it was a great  local  place.  I usually like to hit up local spots  not chains  so that we can really experience different places.   We checked it out and my husband was RAVING about it on facebook saying that he would move to Austin so he could eat here everyday  when one of our friends from atlanta said -- oh yeah  chuy s we love that place.  And he said - no  we are in Austin - totally not the same place.  Then he started looking around  noticing the elvis decor and was like.. oh.. crap.  We totally have one of these in Atlanta. I was DYING laughing.  I had never heard of or been to the one in Atlanta  but I am glad we don t have to move to texas - I can just drive him up to the chuy s in atlanta.  There are millions of types of salsas to try - try as many as you want - no extra charge   The food was delicious.  We really did love this place.
Chuy's,401,The many times I ve came here I have never had an issue the food is always hot service is always good drinks are always cold bathrooms are clean the location is great and they have great outside seating
Chuy's,402,Delicious Tex-Mex food   Everything was wonderful from the freshly prepared chips  served with an amazing jalape o ranch dressing  to our delicious entrees. The Elvis Chicken was superb as were the chicken enchiladas and the chimichangas. Definitely recommend and it is worth the wait.  Oh  the drinks were excellent too 
Chuy's,403,Ok  let me start out by saying I live in Washington  D.C. where you can t really get ANY good tex-mex food.  The worst tex-mex place in Austin probably beats the best place at home.  Maybe that is a slight exaggeration  but it is not that far off.  With that disclaimer in mind  maybe locals in Austin or Texans may not think this is the best tex-mex around  but you could have fooled me.  As any good Mexican restaurant does  we started off with endless chips and salsa.  Here  the chips were thin and crunchy  and tasted very fresh.  The salsa was actually spicy  a rare occurrence at most chain or mediocre places.  They don t treat you like you are a wuss when it comes to spicy foods.  We also got a half and half order or guac and queso for dipping.  The guac was not spicy  but fresh and very chunky.  The queso was also nice with some kick and definitely bits of tomatoes and spices.  I ordered a pork burrito  which was the day s special.  The waitress said it was the best thing on the menu  that isn t on their daily.  So  of course i went for it.  The pork was tender and juicy  and it was also stuffed with guac.  Not too complicated and or fancy  and yet it still tasted very complex.  It was topped with tomatillio salsa and cheese and served with rice.  Every part of the meal was delicious.  The meat was slow cooked and bursting with flavor.    When I m back in Austin  I ll try another place  but if we end up here i would NOT be upset.
Chuy's,404,Food was delicious and well done. Would order again if we were local in a heart beat.
Chuy's,405,Called in an order on Monday  February 25  2018 and requested the Taco Al Carbon  but substituted the meat for lettuce due to my dietary restrictions.  Vegan- no dairy  no meat  Upon arrival  I checked my order to find cheese on my tacos  which does not even come on the Taco Al Carbon tacos and asked the waitress if she could remake them for me. She insisted there was no cheese on my tacos  although I was clearly looking at it  and took them out of my hand just to bring them right back when it was obvious that someone hand picked the cheese out of them. I addressed this to her  and she caught an attitude with me  and had someone else deliver new tacos to me. Not only did I have issues with the tacos  but there was also hair in my side of beans rice. For my first experience  this was a nightmare.
Chuy's,406,The Austin Chronicle just put out their 2011 best and Chuy s won best Tex-Mex for the umpteenth year in a row.  In Austin since the early 1980s  Chuy s manages to thread that line between being a tourist trap and a great place for locals.    We showed up Anthony Bourdain style  no reservations  and waited about 20 minutes for our table.  While waiting  we ordered a sangria and a watermelon margarita and grabbed a bar table and checked out the very eclectic decor  interesting mix of crowd  and the cool t-shirts for sale.  The menu was glorious  truly.  I found out that traditional enchiladas are actually tortillas stacked on each other and having it rolled and squared up is actually tex-mex.  I ordered the Chicka-Chicka-Boom-Boom enchilada  green chilies  tomatillos  cilantro  green onions  serranos  lime juice  American cheese  over a corn tortilla stuffed with pulled roasted chicken meat  and proceeded to finish it up with...  THE BEST TRES LECHES CAKE I VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  That was the 5th star.
Chuy's,407,Used to work alongside someone who worked here and he was always talking great about Chuy s was so I decided to give it a shot.  The chips and salsa were better than we were expecting and the food was out quick. Our waiter I forget his name sorry I think it was matt was great  He made sure to keep the chips coming as I hadn t eaten all day and relentlessly devoured them. Very engaging as well and also knew when to leave us be.  Food was out quick and I inhaled my chicken enchilada which was top notch   Minus one star simply because I used to manage in the food industry and it could have used a quick sweep job and wipe down but it wasn t exactly the worst I ve seen.   We ll be sure to be back as we did enjoy our experience
Chuy's,408,I love Chuy s.... best tex mex everrrrrr  I was in town for one day visiting family and was lucky enough to have a brother-in-law intent on letting me eat my heart out. He brought my family here and  oh my goodness  it was the best decision ever made.  As an appetizer I had chips with jalapeno ranch  um  if you don t you should . My meal was the fajita chicken salad with creamy jalapeno dressing. A very calorie filled  albeit delicious meal. I truly love their food.  Now  as for the waiting times wait staff and seating space. There could be improvements. It definitely stinks that I can t get up to go to the bathroom without asking the person at the table behind me to scoot in a little so I can scoot my chair out. I know eliminating tables is probably a no-no for them  so I can t really comment anything more on it.  The waiter was a nice guy but incredibly busy and made a few errors on drinks  I m guessing since he was running around like a crazy guy trying to get all tables settled .  This is a delicious restaurant and it s the first one ever  So... there s that quirk   
Chuy's,409,This is the worst Chuy s we have visited because of the host. We were here for my sister s anniversary as we cannot find a decent restaurant as it was holiday that is why we ended up eating here as everybody was hungry and this is the only one that is open late at night in the area. Having a family of 10  the host Jody or Joy  her name starts with J just cant remember  she told my sister that she cant sit us not unless all parties are there which we understand so we hurried up then she told us 15 minutes of waiting. People come and go and she was skipping us and let other small parties sit before us because she said theres no table for 10 that we have to wait for a table that she was eyeing for us to leave but as we see there are tables at the back that she gave to another party who just come in. We were waiting and standing there for 45 minutes with my mom and dad who was so old and a baby. She should have ask us to split our party so we can be sitted immediately. She was the rudest host as she was making face and she was on the top of her voice telling us that we have to wait. I actually took a picture of her while she was talking to my sister. We ask our server for her name and we actually told the server what was the name of that  nice  lady in a sarcastic way. To cut it short  a manager came to us and apologize for her behavior. This Chuy s could have been one of the greatest because of how the manager responded to an upset customer but I will still say that this lady should be fired and should change her behavior if she likes to be in this kind of business.  I wouldnt say that customer is always right but in this case I would say that customer should be treated with respect  For the rudest host that we met in this Chuy s....Booo     But cheers to other employee  our server and the manager that night .
Chuy's,410,I went here on my birthday and the service was fantastic  They took a while to get us seated which is something to look out for but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the food 
Chuy's,411,We really enjoyed the chips and salsa- probably ate 3 bowls of the chips before our meal arrived. I got the Baja shrimp tacos with charro beans and everything was superb. We would definitely come back 
Chuy's,412,I am sitting at my desk back in the UK wearing a Tshirt from Chuy s that says  I M NACHO FATHER  geddit  .  What I really wish though   Replace desk with  booth at Chuy s .  Chuy s is great  all-round great.  Drinks great  service on point  food fantastic  fun-factor  high.  Good for friends  good for families with young kids  good for dates  assuming you re ok focusing on an enchilada instead of the person you re with .    Many would suggest going for the Elvis  massive  sampler  platter  and I m not one to disagree.  But there are other delights on the menu  too.  Tuesdays  for instance  feature a Frito Pie Enchilada which  you should go for .  I m also a fan of their big salads  crunchy  crisp and with a light  ish  cilantro vinaigrette it s a good counter to  say  a crispy chili relleno or a  highly recommended  blue corn enchilada.  For the less adventurous  me  some days  a chicken quesadilla is anything but standard  big juicy chunks of chicken and perfectly griddled cheese.  Staff really makes it though  happy  friendly  accommodating.    Yelp note  TAKE NOTE  YELPERS - at Chuy s  Happy Hour is happy indeed   What s included   Unlimited chips and salsa  and  ground beef  refried beans  jalape os  see  make your own delicious dip .  Top it with some queso and their signature creamy jalape o sauce and you re set.  Promise.
Chuy's,413,This is top tier authentic Tex Mex  Visiting from the east coast  we went to chuys in some bumble part of austin and realized it was best mex of our lives     We promptly had to try it s sister restaurant in Barton springs.  Actually thinking of moving to austin because of this food  oh yah try the chicken homemade flautas and taco salad  
Chuy's,414,This place was super crowded when we got there . We waited for about 45 min. But let me tell you  their food was well worth it  The ground beef tacos were out of this world . The beans were tasty and everything was fresh tasting  The bean dip was out of this world    Worth flying back to Texas for     Lol
Chuy's,415,Loved the chicken quesadillas  They were the best I ve ever had- also the jalape o ranch or whatever it s called is out of this world  Also loved the chips and salsa. Can t wait to return 
Chuy's,416,Awesome TexMex   Can definitely tell these are high quality ingredients.  Chips and Queso was on point and the Chili Rellanos were to die for.  Service was fast and friendly  even with it being a busy Saturday afternoon.
Chuy's,417,Absolutely Austin   At the original Chuy s.  If you ve seen one Chuy s  you ve seen one Chuy s 
Chuy's,418,Come here almost every Friday night for dinner. We always have to wait but we grab a drink and chip and salas and have a great time. 2 Friday s ago we waited a little longer than normal. They had forgot about us on the wait list. They got us seated immediately when they found out about the mistake and gave us a free queso for the trouble. This is one of my favorite places in Austin. The food and serves is consistently great.
Chuy's,419,Best queso of my life     Friendly staff  and a very fun retro environment.  The chicken tortilla soup was also excellent  as well as my yummy chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  No complaints from any of my friends  and as part of a group 8  pleasing everyone is not easy    I highly recommend Chuy s and hope to visit again the next time I m in Austin   
Chuy's,420,WOW WOW WOW   Let me just start off and say Chuy s is the best restaurant ever  My family and I usually come here 2 or 3 times a month.   On weekdays  after 7 or 8  they stop serving it   they offer a nacho cart with a bean  queso  and meat dip and regular and hot salsa.  The tortilla chips and salsa that come to your table are the BOMB  The tortilla chips are always crispy and hot. The salsa is to DIE FOR  It is a pico de gallo type salsa with hints of jalapeno. Also  when you come here  ask for the creamy jalapeno dip. It is basically glorified ranch dressing with cilantro. It is also highly addictive   When my family comes here we order the  3 and fajitas.  The  3 comes with a enchilada and taco with sides of Tex-Mex rice and beans.  The fajitas come out sizzling with grilled peppers and onions.   The service is also really good here. Servers are friendly and are familiar with the menu.   The decor fits into the Keep-Austin-Weird theme. It is Elvis Presley inspired and the decor really reflects that.   My one complaint is that parking is sometimes hard to find so arrive early. On a Friday night  you can end up waiting 30-45 minutes and it will be hard to find parking. Oh  and parking is free.   5 stars all the way for Chuy s  
Chuy's,421,Outstanding Tex-Mex. I came with my family  and everyone was impressed. If I m ever back in Austin  this will be on my list of stops.
Chuy's,422,Right in the heart of Austin TX  Chuy s has invented a new new food category - Tex-NewMex   Hatch New Mexico Green Chili is phenomenal   Stacked Blue Corn Green Chili Enchiladas - Shredded Beef Green Chili Tacos. I loved the chip and salsa bar - very cool touch.   I look forward to the Green Chili Stew on my next visit - promise to update my post.   A couple suggestions to change my rating to 5 stars  put green chili between enchilada layers and serve full menu in bar area. 6 stars - Hatch Red Chili Carne Adovada.
Chuy's,423,Great location.  So close to ZIlker and Barton Springs.  Again  Barton Springs Rd has some bad drivers and blind spots so watch out when entering exiting.  There are two entrances to this place  one in the front which is where the host hostesses are  and one in the back by the parking lot.  Parking can be rough if its busy  but Ive never had to wait long for a spot.  If you want to park right away  I would suggest going down to Shady Grove parking lot  they have a big lot.  I doubt anyone is watching so dont worry about getting towed.  Chuy s has a huge bar waiting area with a chips salsa stand which is self serve.  You might just fill up on chips     The margaritas are also very good.  My buddy gets the marg with sangria swirl - she loves them.  The food can get pretty spicey so dont order anything too adventurous if you plan on drinking or going out afterwards.  Or go for it  whatever.  The chicka chicka boom boom is pretty good and you will see other reviews gushing over it.  I think everything on the menu is pretty satisfying.  The queso is great.  Theres also a  light menu   if youre too full from chips and salsa .  Guys  lots of very good looking girls come here.  I think chuy s translates into  chick magnet .  I was never very good at Mandarin.
Chuy's,424,Great Mexican food. Big portions so recommend sharing if possible. Loved enchiladas and nachos. Jalape o infused drinks were great too.
Chuy's,425,I have never been so uncomfortable at a table. I was sat right by a staircase  near the ice machine and front door and had to literally dodge not only servers but customers as well. After being elbowed in the head  this will be the last time I come here.
Chuy's,426,I usually come here a couple times in a month I m always with my family and I never have any complaints the food is always good the people are nice I m always leave happy and satisfied
Chuy's,427,We had the royal treatment as this was our first visit and we mentioned we were from out of state. The guacamole was just the way I make it. And since we were Chuy  new-be s  our server had us sample every single sauce they make  I think it was 10 different ones. The Saturday special - tacos- were yummy and my daughter s chicken enchiladas did not disappoint. The best part that we were not aware of upon entering - we were at the original one  We are fans and will seek them out in Denver  CO and Charlotte  NC.
Chuy's,428,TEENAGERS OR YOUNG PEOPLE BEWARE. This place overall is my favorite place to eat by far and I have dinners here on the regular  however their service is terrible to say the least. You see  I m a teenager and I m used to most places thinking I m going to  dash  or that I don t have enough money to pay  but this place takes it to the extreme. A waiter named Leticia  I believe  first asked us if we were waiting for a table  she didn t ask anybody else  then when we ordered drinks she seemed upset to take our order and when she delivered our drinks she screamed out the PRICE of the drinks and made us pay up front. We got no receipt  and all the other tables were greeted and given time to pay where as she forced me to pay straight away. I m overall disappointed in the management staff and Leticia for the treatment and profiling of their customers.
Chuy's,429,Great food when you eat in  but don t expect your order to be correct when you order something for Pick-Up unless you can remember to check that each item in your order is right. This has happened 8 10 times when I order food to go there  but I usually just deal with it. Today  however  I called and asked to speak with the manager because my order was completely wrong and contained an allergen I couldn t eat around. Very disappointed with the way management handled my call  and I ve learned not to order anything to go in the future from here.
Chuy's,430,After about a year of hunting and trying chips salsa and everything else around Austin  we always come back here...every week.  No frills yet great atmosphere and mostly  always great Tex-Mex food   This is my favorite location with a serious 50s-diner vibe and a staff that is attentive.  The chips are the selling point for this place--and they are constantly refilling your basket along with a a side of their salsa and dangerously yummy jalepeno-ranch sauce. There is usually at least a 10 minute wait on any given night but you can bring a drink from the bar outside with a basket of chips while you wait   Our faves  Beef Fajitas  Quesadilla and anything smothered in Jalepeno Ranch
Chuy's,431,GET THE NACHOS. GET THE CREAMY JALAPE O SAUCE. This place was amazing   It was our first time in Austin and we found Chuy s. The service was excellent and the food was amazing  They also had the  Keep Austin Weird  T-shirt I had been wanting  I m glad we got to try this place out and hopefully will get to come back again 
Chuy's,432,Myyyyyy place     Literally spend  130  here a month because I love coming here so much  the cozy old feel of the 1st EVER Chuy s  the high volume and as always there welcoming staff. This has been my most visited place in the last yr  if not more  and that will continue. Love you guys and the drinks you whip up  
Chuy's,433,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE    Great food  excellent service  very helpful waitress  Ashley.  Even though it was very crowded when we arrived  they seated us very quickly at a very nice table.  Awesome food and gorgeous decor  Fun  fun experience  We will definitely go back 
Chuy's,434,As GOOD as it GETS. This is the epicenter of my Tex Mex cravings  and it s literally the first place I go when I fly home to Austin  before I even go home     Chuy s has long been a family favorite and I grew up going there. Everything from their enchiladas to their Chuychanga is fantastic. The jalapeno ranch dip is INSANELY good - a waitress even gave us the basic recipe so my sisters and I could make it at home since we now live 1 000s of miles away.   Free chips and salsa bar while you wait  which can be an hour or more during rush times   frozen ritas that will deliver a nice buzz  kitschy-cool decor  painted wooden fish  Elvis shrine  hubcabs on the ceiling .   This is my favorite. No Mexican food tops it.
Chuy's,435,Awesome salsas  Even before you start ordering  you can t stop eating the chips with their salsas. Very savory and tasty and somewhat addictive  haha.   Food is great  fresh  well presented and portioned correctly  not too much and not too little. I had the relleno with shrimp and it was crispy and very flavorful  it came with a fat enchilada full of savory beef fajita  which was awesome and the beef was cooked just right and very tender. I really liked the food    My server was Freddie  he is an awesome waiter  he makes sure you get what you order  quick  and in a very funny and friendly way. Next time you go  ask to have him as your server. You won t regret it 
Chuy's,436,This is a childhood restaurant for me so my review may be biased. The chips salsa jalape o ranch combo is a perfect way to begin the meal  yes  ranch...very Texas but fucking tasty . The chile relleno is classic  can t go wrong with the enchiladas  and I always get the spicy cucumber Texas tini...I suggest asking for extra jalape o stuffed olives. Our service recently was super great 
Chuy's,437,I come from New York so my words may mean very little  but Chuy s is the best Tex Mex I ve ever had. What sets it apart is the thinnest of its tortillas - the tortilla chips that were served complimentary were only just thick enough to hold up the finely chopped tangy and spicy salsa. We got the appetizer combo plate to share  which had two chicken quesadillas  four chicken flautas  five nachos  chile con queso  guacamole and sour cream. This was plenty food for the two of us. The quesadillas were especially commendable - the cheese just about made it. Everything was cooked well and done well.
Chuy's,438,Never again...  We had a horrible dining experience. The chairs were dirty and the floor was covered in crushed chips and salsa. The service was slow and inattentive. But guess what   We still tipped nicely because we know everyone has a bad day every once in awhile.  Now guess what our waitress did   When we received our credit card statement  she took it upon herself to add  10 to her tip.  We contacted the restaurant. They did not credit the  10 back. They instead said we could pick up  PICKUP    a  30 gift certificate. The manager also said he would speak with the waitress. Speak   No  she stole from me.  CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS--THEY ADD TO THE TIPS HERE.
Chuy's,439,A big yikes for this Chuys.   We came in at 9 20 on a Saturday night.  It was a 10 min wait for a table   but we just wanted something to drink and an appetizer  so we asked if there was still service in the bar cocktail area  and they said yes  so we found a booth a plopped down.  Waited around 15 and no one came.  So we decided to go put our name on the list for a table.  Now it s a 30 min wait.  We were thirsty  and not wanting to drive around  so we went on the list  and continued to sit in the cocktail area to wait.   Less than a minute later  a waitress comes up to get our drink order.  Now we re confused  and we ask her to clarify if we can order there  and she immediately gets an attitude and asks us why WE have attitude...um  we just wanted to know what was going on.  She did  expedite  our table  but not until she was done rude explaining how things work in the cocktail area-which we were already aware of-there just wasn t any waitstaff for at least 15 min.  She took us to our table and brought it up AGAIN.  We get it  Chuys.
Chuy's,440,This is an amazing Tex-mex restaurant. Took our orders and suggested a couple of things that were perfect  we are new to this type of cuisine . Very fast service and our water was never more than half empty. The  tres leche  is to die for. Amazing place - wish I lived in Austin so I can go there every week 
Chuy's,441,The absolute best  I definitely recommend a margarita and the stacked enchiladas. It s the only thing I ve ever ordered from there in over five years   
Chuy's,442,I really love going to eat at Chuy s.  The atmosphere is fun and the hubby and I have never had a bad experience.  Our waiters have always been great and the food comes hot and fast.  There is usually a wait  but you get free chips and salsa in the bar.  I really like their salsa and chips  so that keeps me happy.  The fist time I came here  I did not like what I ordered.  Then I discovered the Tex Enchiladas and was in enchilada heaven.  I rarely veer from this order unless I opt for the Elvis Combo  which is also yummy.  The hubby gets something different every time  but he is always happy.
Chuy's,443,Nom nom nom nom  So tasty. Huge servings that are reasonably priced. Great HH and free chips salsa queso at it. It is a long wait if you go at a busy time  but love this place.
Chuy's,444,The food is delicious and spicy  service is fast and attentive. Enjoyed every bite. Had the bang bang chicken enchiladas  queso  and a side of extra pico de gallo. Will be recommending to friends and family traveling to Austin. This spot is worth a visit 
Chuy's,445,Chuy s was recommended to me by an Austin co-worker who said they were   Literally the best Tex-Mex on the planet.  OK  it was really good  but I don t know if it s the best on the planet.  The service is awesome. The staff was friendly  helpful  and attentive.  My meal included chili compuesto  chicka-chicka-boom-boom  and tres leches. The enchiladas were really good  and the boom-boom sauce packs a pleasant punch while retaining a good flavor. The chili compuesto was not remarkable  and yet proved addictive at the same time--like the Tex-Mex version of comfort food. The tres leches wasn t up to the same level as the other dishes. Ironically  the word that went through my mind was   dry.   So  while not perfect  my next trip to Austin will probably include Chuy s.
Chuy's,446,Remembering Chuy s from my days in Dallas  I was eager to check out the original location  and it didn t disappoint   My brother and I were very early to meet another friend and arrived during Happy Hour  when they have a free queso bar  so we parked it at the bar and availed ourselves of the tasty queso while we drained several of the potent frozen strawberry margaritas. Matt  the friendly bartender  kept an efficient eye on everyone while bantering gamely with the crowd.   Once our friend arrived we got a table and proceeded to stuff our faces. I ordered the tacos al carbon  essentially  fajita meat with grilled onion and green chiles   and since I am in the know  asked for a side of their Creamy Jalapeno dressing.  I actually make a version of this at home that I got from a  copycat  recipe online and use it as a dip  a dressing and a sauce for chicken. Turns out the original is more cilantro-y and less jalape o-y than mine  and I like mine better   p  Still delicious.  Service was swift despite the mob of people  and this was on a week night . Overall  a great meal. Chuy s  you re muy bueno 
Chuy's,447,Today my husband  amp  I were basically doing an Old Austin tour because he was born here he likes to visit what he deems  Old Austin . This Chuy s location is truly one of my favorites...I have visited Chuy s on Slaughter  Chuy s in San Antonio off I-35  amp  Chuy s just both of San Antonio off 281.  I just have the feeling Elvis himself could come walking through the door any minute. His photo s  funky Elvis decor and even the aquarium looks like it came from Graceland w t the Scuba Diver w t bubbling open treasure chest  remember those  .  1. The food is always satisfying  I had the Chile Relleno  amp  Chicken Enchilada...really good w t the Hatch Geen Chile Sauce. My husband always gets  5...Enchilada plate w t Ranchero Sauce...he loves it. We leave in a food coma  2. The wait staff is awesome  3. Now they have a food trailer park right next door you can also explore for desserts or maybe lunch  amp  dinner another day. 4. If you enjoy funky laid back atmosphere  this is your place   Enjoy
Chuy's,448,Had a great dinner here.  Went on a recommendation from friends and they didn t steer us wrong.  Seated quickly  chips and salsa were legit and cocktails quickly arrived.  Went with the waiters recommendation and had a steak burrito with   Boom Boom  sauce.  Fantastic.  A bit on the noisy side.  Not a problem  just know what to expect.  Would happily return next time I m in Austin.
Chuy's,449,Excellent dinner during happy hour   Service was amazing and the bottomless queso during happy hour was the bomb.  I couldn t stop eating the chips and salsa along with the jalapeno ranch.  Weekends are crowded but this is my new favorite local Tex Mex restaurant.
Chuy's,450,In Austin for a long weekend getaway. Stopped here after spending a few hours at Barton Springs Pool  and without the full support of both parties  hubby wasn t really enthralled by the idea of Tex-mex cuisine because  a burrito is a burrito   but time was limited  and it was the most convenient place we found. It was a Sunday early evening  they were pretty busy but we were seated and served quickly  by a friendly face. The salsa was fresh and spicy  the queso was yummy with thin crisp chips  and the steak burrito   we shared because it is massive  was really good  The steak was flavor filled and not tough  great level of spice  this place won the appreciation of hubby after all  and we were out the door to go see the Congress Bridge bats in record time 
Chuy's,451,I ordered their Monday special  green chile street tacos. Very authentic food and the service was great. Albert was our server and was very informative on what to try and the types of salsas offered.The place is very funky and chic with lots of bright colors. Great experience and very affordable  Happy hour mango margaritas made it even better.
Chuy's,452,I really love Chuy s  the veggie enchilada is top notch  The tres leches is also really delicious.....just one thing. Their happy hour queso bar is a nice touch but they allow gross little children to frolic up there and touch everything  Parents don t care  they are just happy to be rid of their annoying kid for a few minutes. I seriously watched these two little girls feel up every bowl and utensil tonight and wanted to scream. Just a thought for Chuy s  kids should not be at the queso bar  The don t understand that their paws are dirty and don t need to touch everything  GROSS 
Chuy's,453,Chums was amazing. I had a chalupa and a chicken enchilada. My husband s chicken tacos also looked great. It was a really cool vibe and I loved how laid back they were. Speedy service and great prices. Get some queso for sure
Chuy's,454,While we had been to Hula Hut  this was our first visit to the official Chuy s. We definitely had a good experience and will be back  especially because this one is within walking distance .  Service was amazing  even during weekday lunch  usually tougher to get good service I ve found . Our server was incredibly attentive  fun and made good suggestions. Some of the best service I ve had in some time.  As others have said  their different salsas boggle the mind and delight the tummy  I ate the most chips I ve had in months  just to get all the different salsas.  I had the Green Chile Stew - PHENOMENAL. One of the best soups I ve ever had in a restaurant. Check out my picture to get a good view. It s a wonderfully hearty stew full of flavor and big chunks of good veggies like potatoes  onions and yes  the green chiles. It s a gigantic portion  and more than enough to take home. Good news x2 - it microwaves well the next day too   Chuychanga was pretty good  as all deep fried burritos are. The beans were a great side dish as well.  I m looking forward to coming back and getting some drinks and trying some more dishes  but in the meantime I ll dream of green chile stew.
Chuy's,455,1st real time I ve been here  last time was just for drinks  honestly came back because of creamy jalape o dip with salsa was something out of this world   also had the big as ur face burrito   I couldn t finish this btw  Ask them to put boom boom sauce on your burrito  was told this bye a friend and it was awesome  Looking forward to returning
Chuy's,456,Any time I come to Capital city. I make it a point to go to this specific Chuys. It s the original. Price and the portion of true TexMex is great. Also the salsa is perfect. This location is the best. Rock on Chuys  
Chuy's,457,We get it  it s now a regional chain. However that doesn t change the ambiance and quality of the original Chuy s Tex-Mex on Barton Springs Road. Still the best salsa in town IMO. Cheese enchiladas for my wife and  Big As You Face  burrito for me. Excellent Tex-Mex  I want to give a shout out to the flavorful refried beans. This is a place we love  and keep coming back to on our Austin road trips 
Chuy's,458,This is my quick go to spot when I  am in the Barton area. The Steak Burrito is my favorite  dish. Its spicy and full of flavor.  I got the Queso but not really a fan if it. It s watery. Other than that the food is food and its a family atmosphere.
Chuy's,459,You know how sometimes it s the little things that make or break an experience   Well  this was one of those times.  Cut to the chase...the free nacho bar during Happy Hour was really good.  My friends ordered some expensive martini margaritas  almost  11 each  and they were terrible.  Way too strong without the Grand Mariner it was supposed to have  and I have NEVER heard these women complain about drinks before.  Here s the part that really ticked me off.  We ordered a steak burrito to split and asked for different sauces.  She d just told my friend what the  Boom Boom  sauce was and it sounded good  so I asked if I could get that and she said yes.  Then she asked if I wanted sour cream and guac.  I asked if it was extra and when she said yes  I declined.  Well....my bill comes out  and I was charged  3.50 for the Boom Boom sauce   That s 1 3 the price of my whole dinner   I was very upset since she d never told me there would be a  significant  upcharge for that sauce  even after I specifically asked about the other things costing extra and then declined them.  Being with my friends  I didn t want to make a scene  but I went to her privately and told her my concerns.  I told her I never would have ordered that sauce if I d been told there was an extra charge  much less 1 3 the cost of the burrito   After arguing with her for a while  she agreed to talk to her manager.    Well  she brings my bill to me  and they d only taken off half the charge for the sauce   At this point  it s not even the money.  It s the fact that they didn t give me the information up front about the product  I complained  and they STILL didn t take one for the team and remove the full charge to keep the customer happy when it was THEIR FAULT that I had the issue   To me  that just speaks volumes about how important customer service is to them...they d rather get their extra  1.70 than make a customer 100  happy.  Well  no need to worry about this customer coming back 
Chuy's,460,I am really unsure what all the hype is about this place. I have gone twice and both times the food has been bland and just meh. After the second meh experience I will not be back. The redeeming factor was the margaritas  they were pretty tasty and a pretty good price for the size and potency.   Happy hour Yes Dinner No
Chuy's,461,Best Mexican food on the planet hands down. Get the steak burrito with boom boom sauce. You re welcome.
Chuy's,462,Great food. Unbelievably cheap  huge portions and very tasty if you are looking for good TexMex.
Chuy's,463,Absolutely AWWWSSSUMMM            The service  the food  the drinks were all FABULOUS      Reese was our server  we are from MS and did not know much about Tex Mex. Reese was VERY helpful and VERY nice      From the premium margarita to queso with guacamole and need to the burrito and chuychanga  it was ALL GOOOOOD       We had a WONDERFUL dining experience    I recommend this restaurant HIGHLY     Ask for Reese  you won t be disappointed    
Chuy's,464,yeah.  In the same way that Rudy s is my baseline BBQ  Chuy s is my baseline Tex-Mex. If it s worse than Chuy s  see  Serrano s  then it is bad Tex-Mex. If it s better than Chuy s  see  Hula Hut  then it is amazing Tex-Mex.  I d recommend anything with the deluxe tomatillo sauce. The appetizer platter is pretty darn good too. Obviously the biggest weakness of Chuy s is how long the wait can be.
Chuy's,465,Chuy s must put crack in their boom boom sauce. That or velveeta  is that how you spell that bright orange cheese that s not really cheese but that I loved as a kid   Food was good  the vibe is really fun  portions are huge  and it s cheap. All of my favorite things wrapped into one  A must while in Austin 
Chuy's,466,Bonus  free parking especially good during blue on the green.  The salsa dip has the consistency of a grocery store brand and the chips are stale Ish.  Food is average. Neither good nor bad  just as average as average can be. The beef burrito was over salty and not at all fresh  which was covered up by an overly cheesy attempt to hide the fact. Tacos  I tried some shrimp  were again  average.  The margaritas for  6 are pretty strong.
Chuy's,467,Chuy s was the perfect way to feast after a long day at ACL. We only had to wait about 10 minutes  but even if the wait happens to be long when you re there  you can stock up on free chips and salsa in the interim.  While it wasn t the BEST food I ve ever had  it was pretty damn good and all sorts or flavorful. I ordered the chuychanga with spicy queso sauce and wow was this a pleasing late night meal. The sauce was delicious  as was the deep fried cheesy burrito  as you would expect. I also ordered the frozen peach sangria and it was pretty much juice of the gods. Get it.  Service was wonderful and attentive even on a crazy busy night. I would highly recommend trying Chuy s out if you re lookin for some good TexMex 
Chuy's,468,Classic and fun Austin Tex-Mex at its finest.  Chuy s is a staple of the local scene. If you are reading this review to find out about it... read this one and many more to know why its so good. If you are already aware of Chuy s... the good news is probably old news for you.  I have eaten at Chuy s MANY times.. just only recently  checked in  and decided to write a review  how did I miss this  .. anyways. Chuy s has a pretty standard menu that changes slightly from time to time  seasonal  and all the choices are great.    My favorite items   - self serve  while you wait  Chips and Salsa bar  - Table Salsa  though the deep red is not spicy..if that s what you like   - Creamy Jalapeno Ranch  on anything   you have to ask for it   - Elvis Presley Memorial Combo   Its a good size order of food   - Chicka-Chicka Boom Boom  really spicy with good flavor   - ANY Hatch Chili special they are running  especially the chicken   - the atmosphere.. it s cozy and local.. so accept the tight and fun space    There are many things that you can enjoy at Chuy s and I would suggest that you go there and try to find something that you like.. it will have you coming back.   Be prepared for long wait times sometimes  and parking can be challenging on Barton Springs.. but it is all well worth it as a local Austin spot for fun  food  and culture.
Chuy's,469,Restaurant is cute but was really crowding on the Friday night we were there. Food was ok  but ultimately I was turned off when I asked to order CARNE ASADA fries and the server looked at me like I was an alien. We had to break it down for him and eventually I received my order. The fries were not as good as Cali Carne Asada fries  but the Austin fries will do.
Chuy's,470,We are out of town visitors who came once and it was wonderful  We came again and it was the total opposite. We were told the wait was 15 to 20 minutes  which was fine except we waited 36 minutes and still not seated. The  hostess told us they were clearing our table at 30 minutes and at 35 minutes changed her story that the people were still at our table. We left before we could even be seated.  Had she been honest and in the first place  we would have chosen another place to dine versus waiting and not even having lunch.
Chuy's,471,Enjoyed my meal here. I think the food was very good  but not worth the wait. I may not return  alot of quality is lost in some chain restaurants and this is no different. I believe we waited around 45 minutes.
Chuy's,472,C mon  yall.  It s Chuy s.  It s the loud  obnoxious mother-in-law you have to love.  This is good tex-mex...not Mexican  and everything here covered in cheese or ranchero sauce is game.  I can t ever seem to deviate from the  4  chile relleno and enchilada  or shrimp tacos.  Unless they make a creamy jalapeno ranch enchilada or something.  Maybe then we ll talk about getting out of my gut rut.  Their chips and salsa bar is the best way to my heart  though Polvos  escabeche oftentimes leads me astray .  Yes  there s always a long wait  but the food has never  ever  ever  ever  ever sucked.
Chuy's,473,Go to Chuy s for the bottomless  warm  crisp tortilla chips and creamy jalape o ranch  but walk next door to Baby Acapulco s for the tortilla soup. Being a big fan of Baby Acapulco s tortilla soup  I thought I d see how Chuy s tortilla soup stacks up. It doesn t. Definitely try Chuy s tortilla soup BEFORE trying that of Baby s A s  otherwise you re setting yourself up for major disappointment. My friends ordered burritos and nachos. They made the better choices at this restaurant.
Chuy's,474,Redic...  We are regulars at the N Lamar location and receive excellent customer service always  We come here once and it s awful. Took us 15 minutes to get noticed in the cocktail area while ppl all around us got service way before us. Don t ignore customers..ever Chuy s. I m a die hard fan and even visit all out of state locations. I will always defend Chuy s but this treatment is hard to take 
Chuy's,475,It s cheap and fast and food comes in giant potion. No one can complain about this place. Food wise  well you get what you pay for.
Chuy's,476,Love that they love Elvis  cheese and salsa dip were delicious  service was great but the meat in the pork tacos was super dry. Will only return for beer and dip.
Chuy's,477,Man  I can t believe I ve never reviewed this...or did I   Anyhoo  I came here 12 years ago and was introduced to Chuy s.  I LOVE Chuy s   Their creamy jalapeno dip  fully loaded nacho cart during HH  their green chile everything   So  I had a buddy visiting recently and thought  I should take him to the OG Chuy s    Guys  I m not sure it was the best idea.  We got there during peak hours and was told it d be upwards to a 30 minute wait  sure that s fine.  We re waiting outside and it s hot as hades and after the initial wait  we go inside and try to find somewhere cool.  I ask the host how much longer until we get seated.  She then tells me  About 10 more minutes .  Come again   I point out that our quoted time had been met and it would ve been nice to have been made aware of an elongation prior to me asking.  We get sat shortly thereafter.  We order drinks and queso and all of the dips.  Two bites into the queso  I say  this doesn t taste right .  We ended up sending back the queso and I implore our server  who was amazing  to have staff taste it.  Low and behold  he agrees and says that they thought it was off too.  I m not sure how you mess up queso but they succeeded.  The food was amazing  the space is tight  cramped and loud AF.  I think I ve outgrown this location and well  seemingly quality control and proper training is a thing of the past.
Chuy's,478,It s weird that this chuys serves the best tasting Mexican dishes out of all the franchises.  Can t do wrong with the strong house margaritas and burritos. Look out for various specials but it s nice to know that you can get well fed for under 20.
Chuy's,479,Someone recommended I visit Chuy s if I ever found myself in Austin hankering for good Mexican food and so I decided to try it when I visited.    First off  Chuy s is NOT Mexican food  but Tex-Mex. For someone raised in Mexico as I was  this is a HUGE difference   The place was popping. As a lone diner  I got weird looks from people in neighboring tables. At times I thought I was going to get trampled over by customers and   or waitstaff. That is how busy it was.   There was hardly any room to move. I had blue corn enchiladas. Unlike Old Mexico enchiladas  Tex Mex and NM enchiladas are always filled with cheese  unless you have the option to pay more  for which you may get stringy and flavorless pulled chicken instead. These were the all cheese variety. Sigh. Nothing extraordinary at that.   I can t get used to US cheese enchiladas. Just fill them with chicken and ditch the cheese  dammit  Particularly when they are already served with cheese ON TOP  why fill them with cheese    The only cool thing was the blue corn tortillas. But if you expect Old Mexico food at Chuy s  you will be sorely disappointed.   Silly me. I braved rush hour Austin traffic for this  Anyway.
Chuy's,480,A buddy was dying to go to Chuy s.  I ve been there a lot in the past and grown tired of the wait to be seated.  I called ahead and we went down there.  I went a second time recently and the wait  while the list was deep  wasn t too long.  We went around 12 30 when people need to get it together and get back to the office. I enjoy the Rio Grande enchiladas.   They re not on the menu any more  but I was able to ask for them.  The big as your face burritto is also a good choice.  Crisp chips  a limey salsa  and many people like the jalepeno cream sauce  I don t  are pleasant starters.  Their guacamole is good too.   Whatever you eat  get the green hatch chili sauce on it.  I don t think it s that hot  but I like hot stuff.  If you re sensitive  be aware that some people think it s really hot.
Chuy's,481,i loved my 1st visit here     LOVED.  boom boom enchiladas were the bomb. a bit toooo spicy for my taste but im a wussy       salsa was cold and spicy. ahhhhhhh.   it was such a good experience.
Chuy's,482,Chuy s can t possibly need a review...I mean  it s Chuy s.  But it has fewer reviews than Franklin s BBQ  so here I go.    Order anything off the menu and it will make you happy.  I am not kidding.  This at least holds for the Barton Springs location  not so much for the Houston location.  Chimichangas  sorry  Chuychangas  that really are bigger than your face  the Elvis Commemorative Combo  the Lite Plate  enchiladas  sopapillas in the shape of a fish...seriously  just order whatever they re serving and it will be good.  Great vegetarian options  read  deep fried delicious things with vegetables . The creamy jalapeno salsa is good  but I want the table sauce.  This is Tex Mex  after all.    When I got back to Austin from studying abroad in Spain  all I wanted was a Chuy s frozen margarita.  Can you believe they don t have those in Espana   And you get the honor of drinking the margarita that busted the Bush daughters.    Fun Facts  happy hour   free beef  amp  bean nacho bar with queso.  I definitely never regularly showed up here in high school to eat the free happy hour food while ordering a Coke with a free refill.  Dress up as Elvis or one of his relatives on Elvis s birthday and win a prize.
Chuy's,483,5 stars. With a couple of minutes of sitting down my server bought over Chips which were light and airy and the salsa was  spicy  yummy . Ordered a side of Chili con queso which was fantastic. As an entree I ordered the Chicken enchiladas with spicy guacamole. It was enormous and so delicious. The service was very good too.
Chuy's,484,I ll give them a four for doing Mexican food right  where it s hard to differentiate yourself from dishes we ve all seen before. I have the fajitas and they were good. We also had the Taco Queso app. That was  aw-ight . I can do without the meat but it wasn t off putting.  I like the atmosphere too. Lots of interesting and quirky things on the walls and all over the ceilings to keep you busy if you find yourself waiting for your pride with nothing to do. I d go back  though I m not sure id go out of my way for it. I wouldn t have any reserves if it was either suggested or simply around the corner.
Chuy's,485,A now large chain that dishes out food that doesn t taste like chain food  Chuy s is an establishment in Austin and throughout Texas and delivers quality  consistent Tex-Mex at a fair price. This location seems to be packed every time we come - and for a good reason  the service is excellent and it comes amongst a busy  lively crowd filled with small and large parties. They ve accomplished the feat of yielding quality  even with volume.
Chuy's,486,Probably the best TexMex restaurant in El Paso. My wife an I will eat hear more often if the parking was better. The other business dominate the parking.
Chuy's,487,Great service and delicious food   Large portions too.  The tortilla soup was delicious along with the fajitas.  The chips and salsa also are yummy.
Chuy's,488,The short - it s not so great mexican food that has turned into a small chain.  For a city with lots of options  there are many other places.  Might be okay to take the kids here but that s about it.  The salsa is uninspiring  the guacamole was brought out in a small bowl and the bed of lettuce that it was served on top of meant that we got even less guacamole  -   The sides of rice and beans that came with the entrees didn t have any flavor - come on - they aren t there to fill in space on your plate - they are supposed to complement the dish     Margaritas were on the sweet and sour side.   I had read some other posts that said they were strong  but didn t find that to be the case - they came were over-iced and over-sweet and soured   Some of my companions thought their food was okay  but the chicken fajita soft tacos needed something more going on - like seasoning on the chicken or a sauce or something.  I was kind of hoping for mexican street style tacos  but this was more like dry overcooked chicken on flour tortillas.  The fish tacos came with this HUGE piece of overcooked fish that tasted a bit on the fishy side.  You shouldn t need to cut the fish to eat the tacos  -p  Overall - take the kids there.  Otherwise go somewhere else.
Chuy's,489,Went on a Saturday night at around 6pm. Had a 20 to 30 minute wait but it went by quickly because they gave  us some chips to snack on and there is a bar you can grab drinks at. Food was worth the wait  Tried the chicka chicka  boom boom  enchiladas and the sauce on top was heaven  also had the green Chile fried chicken which was delicious. Both were the perfect level of spicy  I love spicy food . Strawberry mojito  was refreshing. Can t wait to come back again 
Chuy's,490,I was lucky enough to come in when they were having their fajita burrito special. All I can say is AMAZING   This place is a staple for tex-mex in Austin. Plus their Mexican martini is bomb 
Chuy's,491,I have to comment on having another excellent experience here  The hatch chili season is going on right now and these folks have nailed it. YUM. Seriously they have the best chili relleno I have ever had  even when I was so full I had to finish it. The staff is soooo amazing  including their awesome manager   Can t recommend this casual tex mex eatery enough.
Chuy's,492,Happy Hour and Nacho Bar review    Great deal     Came during happy hour from 4-7pm because of their nacho bar     It is the best deal ever      We got frozen margaritas for  4  including house  strawberry  mango  and a spicy mango  which is basically just with fireball . One margarita can get you pretty tipsy. I had two and I was feeling reaaaal good. So there is a decent amount of alcohol in the drinks and they are really good   Everyone is wonderfully nice and the nacho bar is amazing    There is always fresh nachos coming out with queso  refried beans  meat  salsa  and jalapenos.  I can t believe I never knew about this     We are planning to come again next week.
Chuy's,493,My first Tex Amex experience   The Con queso is to die for...great local brews  loved the guns and oil local beer. Had the Elvis platter. Wow    
Chuy's,494,I feel like it s a shameful thing in TX to say you don t like Chuy s. I want to. I still want to like it because so many people are excited for Chuy s whenever it s mentioned. We just ordered Chuy s on their site and it was delivered with a meal and two sides missing. We were told we d have to go pickup the forgotten food ourselves. If that was going to be the case  we would have selected Pickup to avoid tipping someone and paying a delivery fee. If you mess up  you take the loss. That s how food places work. Still  even without this experience... Chuy s has always seemed like piles of sauces and carbs and nothing particularly flavorful. It s super greasy and unhealthy with massive portions  but not even in the so-greasy-its-worth-it way... just unhealthy. I dunno. Always full of screaming babies if you dine in or people trying to argue about coupons and junk to pay for their meals. It s weird. I don t think I ll ever understand the hype.
Chuy's,495,Chuys  pro. Chewies  is now a chain.  This is the original.  Chuys is an Austin tradition that has not changed a bit since Governor Bush s kid got a minor in possession here.  Still loud  still crowded  still has weird hub caps all over the wall and still serving the same classic tex mex style enchiladas that I always get.  Update  my fianc  said her fish tacos were not very good.  I have only ever ordered enchiladas which are always pretty good.
Chuy's,496,If you like chicken enchiladas get the chicka chicka boom boom  you will not be disappointed. Creamy and spicy. Also highly recommend the macho burrito and the queso compuesto. The side of rice is extremely flavorful  but the borracho beans not so much...Service here is fast and friendly  nice casual place to get your quick Tex mex fix 
Chuy's,497,Delicious Tex-Mex  exactly as you would expect in Austin. Really enjoyed it 
Chuy's,498,The chip bar with the cheese and chili was awesome  Almost didn t need to buy a meal I was so full on chips. Oh wait  that s exactly what I did   Bruhahahaha 
Chuy's,499,Great fajitas. Be prepared to wait unless you arrive before 6pm. My main qualm is that the queso is ALWAYS COLD  On 4 separate occasions  I have had to ask to have my queso reheated  and all they do is bring out a new container of the same temperature queso. Whether you order the queso and pay for it or if it s free at the queso bar downstairs  ITS ALWAYS COLD 
Chuy's,500,Super fun food  with super fast service   If you have never experienced Tex-Mex  this is the place 
Pueblo Viejo,1,Cool little place. Modern aesthetics. But more importantly food is well priced and I recommend getting the special plate that comes with two special tacos beans rice guacamole.   Unless you like a real gamey flavor stay away from the lamb. But the Pueblo Viejo steak taco is an absolute 10. Order on corn. They have terrific corn tortillas homemade. And try all the salsas.   They range from very crisp and refreshing to deep textured layers spice. None of them are too spicy. Very pleasant lunch for  28 for two people
Pueblo Viejo,2,I have been here a couple of times. The food here is really good and unique compared to one of my favorite other restaurants I go to while I am at work on the south of Austin.  This place is a hidden gem right of east Riverside drive. It s located kind of behind Popeyes.  You will definitely miss it if you re not looking for or using Google maps.  This a place to check out for sure. I have tried crispy beef tacos in the past and they re really good.
Pueblo Viejo,3,I eat here at least once a week  I love this low key mezcaleria. Located right off riverside  behind Popeyes  this quaint spot is tucked in a strip mall plaza. Upon entering you ll immediately notice the brightly colored ceiling  cozy tables and bright interior.  Orders are places at the counter and brought to the table. The taco plates are the best bang for your buck. They include two tacos  rice  beans  chips and salsa. Speaking of salsa  creamy jalape o and tomatillo all the way  My current faves are the quesadilla chicken taco and the veggie taco on corn. The veggie taco is so good. I usually pass on the beans and go for double rice  but do whatever your heart tells you. Lastly  get a mezcalita. I like the mango  Tangy  refreshing with a nice kick  If you re nearby  drop in. You won t be disappointed.
Pueblo Viejo,4,This is just what I imagined when I thought of Tex-Mex. So many taco options  and it seems like the breakfast tacos are the ones to get  as well as quesadillas  gorditas  burritos  and salsas for purchase.  Initially I wasn t sure if we were in the right place  because it looks a bit like a warehouse outside. Then we entered  and there was a taco counter. We ordered and then entered the seating area  which looks like it is also a performance space. We were just having a quick brunch before leaving Austin  and this was a very good last meal.    3.40 Al Pastor - marinated pork  pineapple  onion  cilantro  lime  Great  Sweet  tangy  juicy   3.20 Taco Viejo - chorizo  potato  egg  beans  Good  I had to order the namesake  and of course I had to try a breakfast taco. It s very simple  a little spicy from the chorizo  and the beans and potatoes help keep the taco fillings glued to the tortilla.    8.20 Migas Plate - beans  potatoes  cheesy egg scramble with tortilla chips  My friend ordered this because she s not a big fan of tacos  and more into healthy food  but it still has cheese and fried tortilla chips. It looked pretty tasty to me   I was thinking two tacos would be satisfying  but not too heavy  but these are pretty big. I would definitely come back the next time I m in town.
Pueblo Viejo,5,Great for  Getting breakfast if your friend from grad school and her husband are staying in a hotel downtown and you want to get breakfast with them before taking them to the airport.  ...but Pueblo Viejo is much more versatile than that  of course.  I had two favorite tacos. The taco margarita was great because of the choice to use spinach and mushrooms and binding them together with eggs. I also loved the guaca taco  with steak   which was just layered with a ton of steak  onions  peppers  and avocado--it almost functioned like a tostada. The pueblo viejo style taco and the migas taco were also excellent  though the cheese had clumped a bit in the latter.  Portions are large and the prices are excellent. They also serve beer in the morning  if that s your thing. Service is solid. If there were a PV location closer to me  I would definitely go again  even if I didn t have a grad school friend staying downtown who needed breakfast and an airport dropoff.
Pueblo Viejo,6,Delicious  from-scratch food  The service was awesome- the owner is super nice and told us all about the food truck locations. Definitely coming back 
Pueblo Viejo,7,Food was great. Service great too. Ambience ok. Price is very reasonable though.  May
Pueblo Viejo,8,WOW  Best texas food ever and sooooo much foood  Everything truly was bigger in Texas  We came here from the airport with our friends and loved every single dish  AMAZING flavors and all the hot sauces were just to die for  Everything was on point  queso was soooo good too.   We did have a little upset stomachs after but could be the lack of travel.
Pueblo Viejo,9,Perfect Tex-mex. the tacos here are really fresh and delicious. The salsa was so so good. The truck is in a very pretty outdoor seating area right outside cosmic cafe and beer garten. This is a perfect relaxed weekend spot. The Mexican rice was really delicious too. I liked my chicken taco more than the fish taco.
Pueblo Viejo,10,Pueblo Viejo is one of those places in Austin where you take your friends and at the end of the experience they ask you why you hadn t brought them before lol  our visit this time was very good for the following reasons   - The place was clean  there was enough space to sit and the service was fast.  - As for the food  it was hot  it is also normal to wait for this type of order since they prepare it for you at the moment  but the taste is worth it  I definitely recommend to order the  Plates  that comes with beans and guacamole if you are hungrier just take into account that they also provide you chips and salsa  my only suggestion is about the portion of the Hibiscus water which I would have preferred to be something larger.  - The price based on the quantity and quality of food was within an acceptable range for a small Mexican restaurant  customer service was the best  definitely the person who served us was super attentive and friendly.  Pueblo viejo es uno de esos lugares en Austin d nde llevas a tus amigos y al final de la experiencia te cuestionan el porqu  no los hab as tra do antes lol  nuestra visitan en esta ocasi n fue muy buena por las siguientes razones   - El lugar se encontraba limpio  hab a suficiente espacio para sentarse y el servicio fue r pido.  - En cuanto a la comida est  estaba caliente  es normal esperar por este tipo de ordenes ya que te lo preparan en el momento  pero el sabor vale la pena  definitivamente recomiendo la orden de los  Plates  que trae frijoles y guacamole por si traen mucha hambre solo tomen en cuenta que tambi n te proporcionan chips y salsa  mi  nica sugerencia es acerca de la porci n de el agua de Jamaica la cual hubiera preferido que fuera algo m s grande para acompa ar tanta comida.  - El precio basado en la cantidad y calidad de comida estuvo dentro de un rango aceptable para ser un peque o restaurante de comida mexicana  la atenci n al cliente fue lo mejor  definitivamente la persona que nos atendi  fue super atenta y amable.
Pueblo Viejo,11,Undeniably the most unique and flavorful  tacos in Austin  TX  Be prepared to be full when you leave  even if you get one burrito or one taco because they are huge portions. Five of us ate for a very reasonable price and we ll definitely come back here again.
Pueblo Viejo,12,Went to Pueblo Viejo since I was craving some tacos and this place did hit the spot  I ended up ordering the following tacos     carne asada taco - this was delicious and juicy and full of meat    lamb Barbacoa taco - this was also yummy but I felt the meat lacked flavor and seasoning    Al pastor - this was probably my favorite taco abs had so much flavor and succulent meat. I would definitely order this again  Overall tacos were big and they did not skimp on the meat  definitely worth tryin 
Pueblo Viejo,13,El Tacorrido on riverside has a new competitor. It used to be my go to taco spot on this road because it s price to flavor combo was undefeated until now. I checked their menu beforehand and unlike most places the images on the site matched what they served you. Everything was delicious  I left wanting more even though I was full.
Pueblo Viejo,14,Came all the way from California to taste these tacos   Amazing food.   Must try the quesadilla tacos
Pueblo Viejo,15,What a gem stumbled upon.  A really great family owned business.  Staff really nice. FRESH homemade salsa   You may think 2 tacos are not filling but they do not hold back on the meat   Plus guacamole  rice and beans.  We will be back 
Pueblo Viejo,16,Best tacos I ve had in Austin  The interior was very cute  and servers were nice. Tacos always come with a side of beans with chips and guac  which is a huge plus.
Pueblo Viejo,17,If you re looking for an authentic tacos  then i dont think this is the right place to get those authentic tacos. Not that crazy about their tacos but at least i already tried it out.  I do like the place though  its very lay back and nice to have a breakfast or lunch here. But definitely will Be back here for the bbq not the tacos
Pueblo Viejo,18,VERY tasty and hearty tacos  So glad we got to try this place.  Great  welcoming staff  especially the night manager  Edgar. He was awesome.
Pueblo Viejo,19,Love Pueblo Viejo  I ve been to multiple of their locations and they re all great. The Taco Nes is so yummy  as are all of their breakfast tacos. Reasonably priced and super friendly service. Lots of great salsa options.
Pueblo Viejo,20,I placed an online order and when I went to pick up  the girl at the front was on her phone watching TikTok s very loudly. I stood in front of her for a while before I realized she had no awareness that a customer was there. Someone from the kitchen happened to walk buy and laughed when they realized I was being ignored. When I finally got her attention  she held up her finger  as if telling me to hold on   finished watching her video  and slammed my order on the counter. The food was not terrible  but her terrible attitude makes me never want to come here again.
Pueblo Viejo,21,I was looking for some good street tacos  and I believe I found the right spot  Most of the places I have to go to a food truck  but this was a good dine in experience. The tacos were great  I had the pastor taco plate. It comes with beans  rice and guac. They have many salsa s to choose from. I recommend the creamy jalape o if you can handle the kick    Very clean and well kept
Pueblo Viejo,22,The food was good and tasty. Paying  8 for a few lime pieces was not so good.   Steak Tacos
Pueblo Viejo,23,Amazing food  amazing people and an amazing owner  Supportive of the community and always keeping food fresh and authentic   I love this place 
Pueblo Viejo,24,A trip to Austin isn t complete without breakfast tacos. These breakfast tacos and accompanying sauces were delicious 
Pueblo Viejo,25,Super clean and friendly staff but the food was really average and expensive. Meat had little flavor  really just a plate of food youve probably ate at home a thousand times. But obviously there s a difference between restaurant food and home cooked food and it disappointed me because this tasted like subpar home cooked food. My mom could ve done it better you feel  if anything i could ve done it better. Drinks were very good  but they don t even give complimentary chips despite the higher prices for food. Salsa was insanely small  it just doesn t make sense to make it that small like what s the point of scooping two drips of salsa into a cup. Also kind of tasted like they only heated up the main entree  so the potatoes and beans were barely warm. Won t be coming back just because i know there s better for cheaper.
Pueblo Viejo,26,In Austin for family event and decided to try Tex-Mex. Searched Yelp and found this unpretentious restaurant in middle of nowhere. However  the enchiladas and Mezcali drink more than made up for location. Quick and friendly service just added to our satisfying experience.
Pueblo Viejo,27,Awesome good truck  We had the opportunity to try their food at Meanwhile Brewery and were not disappointed. Don t miss out on the loaded nachos with added chicken- super flavorful and enough to share. They were delicious  
Pueblo Viejo,28,This food truck has a brick and mortar  but food trucks are just as good and more convenient when you re at Cosmic or Meanwhile. I could swim in the creamy Serrano sauce. But everything else is pretty on point  too. Oh  try the black habanero  too  The queso is just basic  but swirl in the sauces and you get close to perfection.
Pueblo Viejo,29,Tacos Al Pastor were authentic and delicious. Great restaurant that was full of flavor and great service. A must stop in if you are in Austin
Pueblo Viejo,30,Went for the first time today just based on Yelp reviews and y all... this place is life changing  Best tacos I ve ever had and a damnnn good margarita to go with it. Happy  respectful staff members. Amazing green salsa for the tacos. Can t wait to go back  
Pueblo Viejo,31,Jimena was amazing in giving her service. She did checkups and made sure I was satisfied with my dining experience. I also saw that she was by herself so I had a lot more respect for her. Thank you Jimena and the cooks for making my experience go well.
Pueblo Viejo,32,Ok  the gorditas from here are some of the best I ve had. The enchiladas remind me of M xico. This is not Texmex guys  this is good Mexican street food 
Pueblo Viejo,33,Had a great experience dining there tonight  The food and the service was excellent  The night manager Edgar  went above and beyond for us. Super nice guy  We got there right after closing but they still took our order and he even cleaned a table for us to sit outside and have our meal  We are from out of town but we will happily come back next time we visit  The food was on point 
Pueblo Viejo,34,Be careful when you order at meanwhile brewery. They only take orders in person at the food truck. I mistakenly placed a order online for the   cosmic location  because I went the meanwhile brewery website then clicked the Pueblo veijo  link to order. I had two small hungry children so I clicked to order. When I realized I had ordered at the wrong location the lady at the window told me to call the   cosmic location  to see if they can switch the order to their location. Well they didn t  I called the cosmic location and was basically told   sorry  so I paid  20 for food that I didn t get to eat. We re calling to dispute this charge. I m sure I m not the only one to have this mix up. So something needs to change. Update your link to specify that meanwhile location only accepts walk up orders 
Pueblo Viejo,35,Food was good. I really enjoyed the enchiladas  Gordita was mediocre. The  4.50 tiny side of guacamole is offensive
Pueblo Viejo,36,This place is LEGIT. Some of the best Tacos and Salsa s we ve had here in Austin. If you re craving good home cooking Mexican food  look no further  Yuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 
Pueblo Viejo,37,They ve got an amazing Don Chago breakfast taco  and their beans were so good. Creamy jalape o salsa was delicious  but not super spicy. The area is a fun spot to eat these delicious breakfast tacos too 
Pueblo Viejo,38,Coming from California  I consider this place over priced for a size of all the dishes. I would have given this place 2 stars review if it wasn t clean. It is a nice clean place. They have NO salsa NOR chips BAR  in California  it is a given thing. I will never come to this place a second time. If you are hungry  it is ok place to swing by.
Pueblo Viejo,39,My daughter and I just happened upon this restaurant.  The Tacos were wonderful  social distancing was enforced  the service was prompt  the restaurant was very nicely decorated especially the ceiling with art  I recommend this restaurant for dine in or take out.
Pueblo Viejo,40,Food is just average  and Prices are High   There are much better choices all over Austin including in the Riverside Area.
Pueblo Viejo,41,Was looking for more Authentic Mexican and came across this place on Yelp   My sister and I went to try it out and were the only people in the venue. Food came out super quick and was delicious.  We got steak  chicken and Al Pastor  Highly recommended the Al Pastor  it was my favorite   The guacamole was fresh and had a great flavor  Would definitely come back.
Pueblo Viejo,42,Love their tacos and margaritas  This place is super casual and there is rarely a crowd  but there should be  Some of my favorite tacos in town 
Pueblo Viejo,43,Delicious food  EVERY TIME  Oh  and the drinks are bomb  Highly recommend and happy this is owned and managed by Austin locals 
Pueblo Viejo,44,These tacos. Holy smokes  Can t say enough about the quality and flavor here. So good  I ll be back soon  
Pueblo Viejo,45,5 Stars  without any hesitation  for fantastic  authentic tacos in the most grunge atmosphere you can imagine. Kind of like a speakeasy taco spot  now that I think about it...  Gosh  I m happy I used Yelp when I was last in Austin. Without it  I would never have found this great spot. PV is located inside a late-night music venue. It s a brilliant use of the space during the day  someone do this in Orlando   .   Once you find it  you ll see that you have two seating areas. There s a limited number of outdoor tables  but be aware that there is no shade cover  so it gets VERY sunny in that area. If you re like me  and a hungover breakfast taco sounds better in the dark  still wearing sunglasses   they have indoor seating inside the music venue. Be aware-- this is verrrrry casual indoor seating. I m taking fold-up tables  you know  the grey ones  and chairs on what I imagine is normally the dancefloor. It s lit up  but there s a reason they usually keep these places dark... to say it s grimy would be obvious. But honestly  who the f cares when their tacos are this good   I highly recommend you go full Austin and get the migas taco. It s a breakfast-style taco with eggs  cheese  jalape os  and tortilla chips. Crunchy perfection. And of the 4 places I had Migas tacos while in Austin-- This was my fave.   But don t forget to try something else while you re there  I accompanied my migas taco with a classic al pastor. It was good as hell  guys. Like  I was full  but I kept eating. And kept eating. And kept eating.   Overall  a must-visit when you re in Austin. It s weird  and vibey  and legit. A perfect  near-hidden gem.
Pueblo Viejo,46,We came here after watching the chef show as it was recommended by Aaron Franklin  gotta follow the pros  right  . We were both a bit disappointed  especially we just had migas from Veracruz about 30 mins before coming to Pueblo.   The tacos were made fresh to order and took a little bit  but I don t mind - would rather have fresh food than stale  already cooked and pre-assembled tacos.   The migas here at Pueblo was rather dry and bland  even for someone like me who always complains about her food being over-salted find it a bit under seasoned and had to use the table salt. I had one bite and that was it.   The chorizo  egg  and cheese taco was also quite dry. It didn t blow my mind and tasted like it was just a regular breakfast taco I can make a home and have it taste better.   Overall  the ingredients in the tacos were undoubtedly fresh and the size of the tacos were eye-catching  but unfortunately the flavors were definitely lacking in these tacos. I don t think I would come back again for more.
Pueblo Viejo,47,Saturday morning tacos are the best. And coming from Pueblo Viejo  justifies just that mantra. They have for  vegan and meat lovers. I just want some good ol  tacos.  There is an ample sized seating area where your food will be taken to you once you ordered up front. Their tacos are fresh and I love the sauces they have. I got poblano chicken tacos and an original potato and egg taco. Great price and even better portions 
Pueblo Viejo,48,The one true vegetarian approved Mexican place I ve found in Austin that I like so far  I had the veggie gordita - it was flavorful  with lots of stuffing  and delicious. I can t wait to return and try their tacos too. Don t forget to add the tasty sauces to your order.   My husband  who is not vegetarian  loved the lamb tacos.
Pueblo Viejo,49,Oh my goodness y all. Let me start by saying that I m a gatekeeping ass b tch with my Mexican food. I know my Mexican food. In Austin  it s veeeeery difficult to find a  great  Mexican food  but Pueblo Viejo is definitely it.   I ordered the green enchiladas plate with al pastor filling  and my partner got the steak burrito. Here s the consensus   Enchiladas -- the price was pretty standard for the plate  and it was soooo worth it. The al pastor meat was spicy  delicious and each bite had a hint of pineapple. Very yummy  very messy  very worth it. The sides were pretty average  but they complimented the food very well.   Burrito -- for a burrito  this was a bit on the pricier end    10 . It was also very good and filling. There was a very good quantity of the ingredients in the burrito  which you can definitely eat over the course of the day. 10 10 would recommend to split with someone  too.   We also ordered some mezcal drinks  not in the picture    We got the frozen mezcalita  which was pretty good. Most of the non-frozen drinks have chili pepper  which my partner didn t like. Overall  I d say it s an acquired taste  so if you re new to mezcal or not very experimental with drinks  go with the frozen mezcalita.   Overall  this place gets 4 5 stars from me. I docked a star because the service  the sides and the drinks were just okay. 10 10 main dishes  and 7 10 everything else.
Pueblo Viejo,50,Excellent service.  The flavors are robust and work together in the best way.  The potatoes with sauce are so delicious.  The corn tortillas are so tasty.  I love the mild salsa.  You can taste each ingredient.  Definitely coming back.
Pueblo Viejo,51,After a rough morning of travel my husband and I came in desperate for food. We were treated to some of the best Al Pastor we ve ever had. It definitely changed our mood and we ll be coming back soon.
Pueblo Viejo,52,I giving them 3 star because the tacos are the best in town. But every time I order from this place either online or in person they get the order wrong or miss taco. Literally just picked up tacos to go and we waited 25 minutes because no one ever came up and yell my name and the order was missing a taco. LOVE their tacos do not like how it s ran.
Pueblo Viejo,53,At first it seemed kind of dark because of the lighting  but the food was amazing and service was great.
Pueblo Viejo,54,Austin is chock full of neighborhood Mexican places.  Pueblo Viejo is one and is ok.  For paper plates its ok.   We re from south Texas so our standards are there to weigh against TexMex.  The enchiladas plate is your best bet.  Served fast  food.   Lamb taco needs seasoning.  It all could use a bit of seasoning.  Its ok. Good fish tacos.  Don t trip out on the ceiling space monkeys   And lots of huge potted plants on the tables.
Pueblo Viejo,55,Delicious food  definitely recommend  they accidentally gave me the wrong taco on my order but immediately realized and gave me the correct one to go  while letting me keep the wrong one . Salsas are super good  if you like spicy stuff like myself give the ghost pepper one a shot  it will not disappoint.
Pueblo Viejo,56,Tacos great. Salsa is great. But when I order 6 tacos and you tell me I ll receive one salsa per taco but only send one red and one green  I m bummed. So when I call to ask the policy  and she confirms one per taco   I ask what should I do so this doesn t happen again   We ordered through Uber eats so do I make a note  Ask my driver    She literally said well Nothing sometimes the employees who bag your order just screw up. Umm ok. Thanks for the less than mediocre service. It s not a huge problem but if you screw up  let me know that it won t happen again tell me what I can do to make sure it doesn t happen. Don t write me off.
Pueblo Viejo,57,Please turn around  Highly disappointed and feeling sick to my stomach. Waste of time and money  An embarrassment to authentic tacos.  Locals and original neighbors definitely DO NOT EAT these tacos. Absolutely NO FLAVOR   Simply trash.
Pueblo Viejo,58,Two words  food poisoning. I literally felt nauseous for several hours. Up at 2am. 24 hours later  i have a horrible headache and major bathroom visits. I ordered steak tacos and the queso. Ughhhh...I will never return.
Pueblo Viejo,59,The staff wore masks and gloves. The line to the window went fast and people kept a social distance. For this food truck  you received a buzzer to wait for your order so that you do not crowd too close to wait for your order. Seems safer than most food trucks.  We went to the food truck located on the Meanwhile Brewing Company grounds. We ordered the quesadilla plate to share. It was a large chicken quesadilla with guacamole  lettuce  pico  refried beans  chips and salsa  and sour cream on the side. We were quite happy with this choice. The tortilla was slightly crispy and flaky  as expected from a great tex-mex joint. The salsa was medium spicy and tasted great. We hope to come back and try other items from their menu.
Pueblo Viejo,60,Tacos here are bomb    Definitely one of the best tacos places I have eaten. They have many tacos options to choose from. 10 10 recommend 
Pueblo Viejo,61,So disappointed. Filthy  dark place  sticky tables  flies everywhere. An overpriced  taco plate  with two tacos. Tortillas tasted and felt like microwaved. Pastor meat was dry and over cooked. Steak meat was like chewing leather. Tasteless beans. Served with guacamole - not even a teaspoon s worth  Embarrassing to see this in ATX.
Pueblo Viejo,62,So GOOD    I ve only got the nachos but they are BOMB   Only critique is I didn t get enough meat  but other than that I will continue to have my cheat meals here
Pueblo Viejo,63,Finally a new review  something to rave about... I was going to go to Angie s  but somebody... not going to say any names  took too long and made me have to go for a pick up vs dine in experience.  My gf  who I m going to give props to in this sentence found this place using the near me feature of safari... well done  B. Your training is now finished  you re a Jedi master now.   We looked at the menu and stuck with steak in all the choices... guaca taco  quesadilla taco  and enchiladas.   I ate my guaca  had a bite of the quesadilla taco  and got full af on the enchiladas.   LET ME TELL YOU THOUGH BRO  deez guacas       Deez guacas bruh      They should call it  The Guaca flocka flame...   fr  might be the best steak taco I ve had in Austin TX. I m being serious. I ve never given this title to any other taco joint. I only have one more place to try and I ll know for sure.   This taco is a greasy deliciousness. Don t come here thinking you re getting a clean taco  nah... it ll be dripping out of the foil they give it to you in. The steak is seasoned  and ugh... just all around gooch boots.
Pueblo Viejo,64,We ordered the tacos via a food delivery service because We were lazy. I would recommend going to the food truck itself. The tacos were great quality and the combo came with guac  chips  mild salsa  and beans at a great value. The tacos were lacking sauces although I had put in a side comment to include hot salsa on the side. Probably lost in translation somehow.  I would definitely come back here next time I m in Austin to try the tacos at the site  with the house made salsas.
Pueblo Viejo,65,Came today  amp  ordered some steak burritos. They were huge  amp  heavy  so far these have been the best burritos I ve had in Austin  Very friendly  amp  helpful cashier     Will definitely be back.
Pueblo Viejo,66,Spot was tucked away in a decent location. Server and cook were good. The food was great and satisfying. Will come back to this place.
Pueblo Viejo,67,Loved the customer service and my tacos I loved that the corn tortillas were a good size and they don t skimp on ingredients in your taco which is awesome. Their beans are quality not like from a can and their jalape o salsa is a must make sure you ask for extra   
Pueblo Viejo,68,Oh heavens was this place amazing  The guy at front had very little personality but got points  for hearing us talk amongst ourselves about what sauces we wanted to try. Great small business with great food  We sat outside on picnic tables as the inside dining was closed.
Pueblo Viejo,69,Very disappointed. Spent over  10 on a veggie burrito that I would describe below mediocre  favorless and bland. I only ate it because I was hungry and there was no other veggies options nearby. Maybe they re saving the flavor  salt and spices for their other dishes   
Pueblo Viejo,70,The small gem is literally a gem  I tried 5 of their tacos with corn tortilla. YUM  The chicharron taco is unlike anything I ve ever had before  and the pork pieces were still crunchy even swimming in the verde sauce 
Pueblo Viejo,71,So good  Food was amazing. Service was amazing  Definitely recommend     Recommend bistec tacos 
Pueblo Viejo,72,Holy cow. DELICIOUS tacos. fresh tortillas  heaven. Daniella was so sweet  and was very helpful with menu recommendations. I had the fish taco and lamb taco  which were both surprisingly large with a lot of meat  no complaints there . the quezon was delicious as well and the perfect consistency in my opinion. jamaica was deliciously sweet and the lemonade was a sour counterbalance. highly recommend this restaurant
Pueblo Viejo,73,The food was delicious.  Green chicken enchiladas with the habanero sauce.  My honey had the gorditas plate.   Good fresh.  Downside margaritas small size very small.
Pueblo Viejo,74,This place is so good  My goal when visiting Austin as to try all the tacos and burritos I could and this place was one of the best. My fiance and I each got burritos and though we got different kinds we both agreed they were some of our favorites in Austin. The menu is also very vegetarian friendly.  This place is really small and easy to miss - it s definitely a grab and go. There are some picnic tables outside which is where we sat to eat  but otherwise its connected to a club that looked like they were getting ready for a show when we stopped in.
Pueblo Viejo,75,I m going to start this review with a high controversial opinion  I love Mexican food but I can t stand Tex-Mex. Since moving here in October  I ve tried to find a place a place that makes simple and delicious cheese enchiladas. You would think this a simple request but no  restaurants are constantly trying to sneak in some other ingredients like mushrooms or spinach. I thought my quest for the perfect cheese enchiladas would never end until I found Pueblo Viejo on Uber Eats. Their enchilada plate came with refried beans  guac  lettuce and pico de gallo  my mouth is watering just typing this  . Best of all  their enchiladas were just little vessels of cheese filled goodness. Love this place 
Pueblo Viejo,76,The steak and al pastor tacos were good  but a little greasy. The fish was way too salty though... I can t speak about all the employees  but the one we dealt with could have had a much better attitude with us when we went to return our fish salad. Lastly  the main seating area inside is a dark  undecorated warehouse with no personality. They were playing a gorey movie with subtitles on their projector while blaring talentless and profane rap music  a strongly unappetizing atmosphere. The outside seating looked pretty cool and more inline with a street taco place  but it was 100 degrees outside...
Pueblo Viejo,77,The best taco spot in town  Especially their breakfast burritos. If you re a fan of hot sauce  definitely give the orange habanero a try--it really has a kick to it.   The only downside I can think of is that they don t have their breakfast burritos or MYOT  make your own tacos  on most of the delivery apps. Probably to keep things moving.
Pueblo Viejo,78,Not a lot of variety in the menu. Food was mediocre and when we asked for a cup of water they gave us a tiny plastic cup. Chips were thin and all broken up and the salsa was small.  Also  chips and salsa were not complimentary.  I just wouldn t recommend it with so many options.
Pueblo Viejo,79,I don t come to Austin very much  so maybe this level of breakfast taco is typical here  but the tacos I had at Pueblo Viejo were fantastic.  What s especially good is their ham and egg taco   their chorizo  and their beans  great flavor and consistency.  The price is typical for a good taco   3  but they re pretty healthy.  I m a big eater and three of them filled me up.  I will definitely come back 
Pueblo Viejo,80,These are officially my favorite breakfast taco spot in Austin for 3 simple reasons   1  There is no line  It s a little out of the way  but you don t have to wait for 30-60 minutes for breakfast 2  They have excellent options AND amazing hot sauces. I love their chorizo. 3  They have outdoor seating and a great spot inside too. You will be guaranteed to find a seat.  I don t know if I will find a better spot for breakfast tacos. I find this to be a hidden gem 
Pueblo Viejo,81,Ok  I m not going to lie - we were originally going to go to Torchy s  recommended by the locals  but the wait was ridiculous.  We still had to get our taco fix at some point during our trip so we decided to give Pueblo Viejo a shot.  I was a little confused because Yelp listed this place as a food truck - this location on Brushy St is literally a hole in the wall - it s shoved in the corner of a building and just has a little window where you order.  But guess what  It s AWESOME    This place is off the beaten path  basically under the freeway in a little sketchy  but probably soon upcoming  area.  You know what they say though - the sketchier the neighborhood the better the tacos   There s a few picnic tables for you to eat outside but there s otherwise no inside seating - dress accordingly for weather.  I ordered the al pastor  has a little kick to it  taco plate - it comes when beans  chips  very thin and light tortila chips  and guacamole.  The guacamole was nice and fresh - not heavily seasoned  the beans were good and the tacos were freakin amazing.  What really stood out for me at this place was that the meat in the taco was PIPING HOT when it came out.  Most places that serve these kind of tacos will just dump some lukewarm meat on your tortilla and call it a day but this place - WOW  it was worth a few minutes wait for a made to order taco.  I just had to go back and grab another taco before I left and I got the taco nes - which had steak and chorizo in it.  It was a little bit on the salty side but still delicious nonetheless.  I highly recommend the corn tortillas - they double it up and it is just amazing.  Drinks - they have mexican coke and fanta in the tall glass bottles which go great with the tacos and some self service water.  I believe they also have horchata and some other options as well.  I am very happy to have found this place thanks to other Yelpers and will definitely go back next time.  I hope they stay a hole in the wall and can keep their prices reasonable - you really get a lot for your money here and I love it.
Pueblo Viejo,82,Some really good corn tortilla tacos  There s ample seating inside and picnic tables outdoors. The taco plate s a good deal with 2 tacos  refried beans  salsa  chips   amp  guacamole. We tried the chicharrone and al pastor tacos. Loved that the chicharrone retained a crispy texture even with the salsa verde on it  the al pastor was deeply flavored and soft. Try the tomatillo and hot sauces too  and a drink like the horchata  creamy without the grittiness of the rice or cinnamon  
Pueblo Viejo,83,Came here for national taco day. Left with my new favorite taco place   This place is tucked into a cute little corner that has a nice patio dining area. Once I walked in  I knew the tacos would be bomb. I got a taco plate with one Al Pastor taco and one Taco Nes. The plate comes with guac  chips  and beans  however contrary to what others have said  they actually do have rice that you can substitute  you just have to ask for it  it s not on the menu . The Al Pastor taco was AMAZINGGGGG and literally changed my life. The meat was incredibly flavorful and had the perfect texture. The portion sizes that they offered were very generous as well.   My new goal is to try all the tacos here and will definitely be recommending this place to friends 
Pueblo Viejo,84,This place is great. They ve got a nice selection between the taqueria classics and some slightly more interesting variations. The creamy green serrano salsa is excellent  similar to the do a sauce at tacodeli if you ve tried that  and the chips   guac were solid as well. Prices are totally reasonable  and for a normal meal 2 tacos will do the job unless you re really starving large.  Forgot to mention  the don chago taco with bacon  beans  and avocado is amazing and I highly recommend trying it with the serrano salsa.
Pueblo Viejo,85,Nothingw like a dead bug in your food...deeeelicious   No wonder the food taste so good here...it actually does...but could skip the dead fly  to-go order...bug came from kitchen 
Pueblo Viejo,86,Saw the 4.5 stars and I was excited to try it out. Ordering was easy and the service was good. The mezcaleta  was good as well. But the food was terrible. I m someone who never thinks of asking for a refund for bad food  I usually just chalk it up as a loss. I ordered the burrito with steak and my gf  ordered a steak gordita. The food had no flavor at all  to the point I thought I caught corona virus again. The burrito felt like I was eating a grilled salad wrapped in the tortilla. Barely any meat and filled with veggies. Just terribles
Pueblo Viejo,87,We ate here early Monday morning. In and out before 8 00. Taco Bueno  Migas Taco  Taco Viejo. Not a bad one in the bunch. My favorite was the Taco Viejo   Great flavor. And they sure didn t skimp on the fillings   Fresh. Quick. If I had to mark them down for something it would be no coffee at breakfast  but for tacos this good I can pass. Friendly service. A definite stop next time we are in Austin 
Pueblo Viejo,88,Good when it s not greasy. Make sure to order ahead for pickup. The dining area is small but beautiful. I ve always loved coming here. One of my favorite tacos places when I come by Riverside.
Pueblo Viejo,89,Whether or not this place is known for its queso  I can assure you that it s actually pretty badass 
Pueblo Viejo,90,Whew  take all my money. They have prize winning steak tacos  I do think they re a little expensive compared to other places. We paid  42 for 9 tacos and 2 sodas  amp  the wait time could ve been shorter.  Besides the steak tacos being amazing  the al pastor and lamb barbacoa weren t my favorite. I do like that they have multiple salsa options  free of charge. The limeade was fresh  but  could ve had a tad bit more sugar  the serving is also pretty small for the price  it s just lime juice and sugar .  Parking was a nightmare on a Monday at lunch time. We had to PAY  then park on the main street  amp  WALK over there in the heat. I wasn t happy about this.
Pueblo Viejo,91,Love this place. Very friendly staff and rhebfoid was delicious. I had a steak burrito that was wrapped in a freshly made tortilla. The nachos also come out hot and fresh. The habanero sauce is extremely hot so he careful.
Pueblo Viejo,92,Pueblo Viejo serves  in my humble opinion  some of the best tacos in Austin. Tacos and plates are usually ready quickly and are always tasty. I love that the menu features numerous vegetarian dishes  and the workers are always amicable. All offerings are very affordable and this location  right next to i-35 in East Austin  is very convenient for to-go tacos.   After singing the praise of Pueblo Viejo s delicious tacos  I have to admit I m a bit weirded out by the venue itself. Basically if you choose to eat on-site  they have you order at a counter and then dine on foldable tables in the center of the dark and gloomy North Door theater. It s just bizarre  like  I m-not-supposed-to-be-here kind of weird. I also could not find the bathrooms for the life of me as all doors to the rumored restrooms seemed to be locked. Oh well. Still  the tacos are good.
Pueblo Viejo,93,Wow  First time here and super impressed. All other trucks had sold out once I showed up  which was early  and boy am I grateful they stocked appropriately for a Saturday night  Special was lamb barbacoa which I don t find often on housemade corn tortillas. The Taco Viejo sent me back to childhood  like my abuelita made. They also have some delish salsa. 10 stars y all. if you re at cosmic coffee bar or see this food truck around definitely stop and grab couple tacos  you won t be disappointed.
Pueblo Viejo,94,My friend highly recommended me I gotta check that place out and thankfully  I didn t have any regrets so trying their beef tacos. It was so good 
Pueblo Viejo,95,During the lockdown I ve been ordering lots of food delivery.  Last night I ordered from this little gem and I was surprised and delighted.  I ordered  3 tacos    1  the Taco Nes  which has steak  chorizo and lots of grilled onion served with fresh cilantro and lime   2  the Quesadilla Sincronizada  which is a crispy flour tortilla with lots of melted cheese  ham and avocado  and  3  the Fish Taco  which is grilled tilapia seasoned with garlic  butter and fresh lettuce and tomato.    They were all delicious and had so much more flavor than anything I ve gotten elsewhere recently.  But they are also packed  and two tacos would have been enough.  They came with different sauces that I didn t even try because the tacos were so good by themselves.    This is a great find and I ll be going back 
Pueblo Viejo,96,I had the Pueblo Viejo style taco  al pastor and Barbacoa. The steak in Pueblo Viejo taco is very juicy and a bit chewy. The lamb in barbacoa is very tender and rich in flavor. I not a fan of pineapple on taco so I didn t find al pastor especially good  but I m sure many people would like it as the pork is marinated well. Overall  their tacos are tasty and satisfying. However  personally I think it s the kind of good food that s make you stop by when you are in the neighborhood. It s not the kind of good food that you are willing to bike drive 10  mins for.
Pueblo Viejo,97,Amazing lunch at Pueblo Viejo. Food was incredible  the server attentive  and the ambience cool. This is an excellent austin restaurant
Pueblo Viejo,98,Delicious tacos  Best corn tortillas in Austin  IMO. So glad I decided to grab a couple of tacos and a gordita from here tonight. I ll definitely be back.
Pueblo Viejo,99,Delicious tacos. One of the best in Austin in my opinion. Friendly folks working there and a great location. Taco Nez is one of my favorites if you re a meet eater. The fish taco is also great. Hand made corn tortillas if you re into corn tortillas. Great sauce options. Used to be a creamy serrano guy but moved to creamy chipotle recently. Love the breakfast tacos too. Overall good price and sweet location being right at Cosmic... go 
Pueblo Viejo,100,Absolutely delicious  I got the Don Chago and Al Pastor and both were amazing. Way more filling than I expected  I couldn t even finish both tacos  not that I didn t want to . The green sauce that they give you with the tacos was awesome and service was quick. Would definitely recommend.
Pueblo Viejo,101,This is one of our family favorite taco place. My go-to taco is the Pueblo Viejo style. Everything else I tried here is very tasty. Their salsas are the best too.
Pueblo Viejo,102,Imagine you re blindly walking around a city you re not familiar with in the mood for tacos and you stumble upon this place.   Yea. I was pumped.   First of all  the queso was dope. It was exactly what I was fiending for and it hit the spot with just enough heat and saltiness for the chips. So good. And can we talk about their salsa  It is binge-worthy.   I also ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were damn delicious. The chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. And the enchilada sauce was so perfect. I never wanted my meal to end.   This is the kind of Mexican food establishment I wish were in Seattle.
Pueblo Viejo,103,No major complaints - a serviceable taqueria  albeit slightly overpriced. Somewhere one goes will hungry and in the area. But in a town full of tacos  it s unlikely to be your favorite.
Pueblo Viejo,104,This place was absolutely delicious and most definitely authentic. It has many Mexican street food from different regions in Mexico. Tortillas are handmade     My husband and I were in Austin for my birthday weekend. This was our last stop on our way out and couldn t have left happier. The music was everything you d hear at a good Mexican party  not all rancheras  puro p noche baile  Jiji It seems as the places gets poppin at night  there s a big stage with seating upstairs and area for a dance floor. Do yourself a favor a go here 
Pueblo Viejo,105,Great tacos  We came here for breakfast for the first time today and ordered the Taco Bueno and two sausage  egg and cheese tacos.   The Taco Bueno was very good  Definitely not greasy considering it was chorizo.   Would definitely come back 
Pueblo Viejo,106,This place is only a short walk away from 6th street so perfect to get some late night tacos. The restaurant is small  but there is some outdoor seating.   al pastor - pork flavor quite strong beef and avocado - super delicious and my favorite of the two.   One thing that I loved about the tacos here is that they are not overflowing with oil  so it s easy to eat and not make a mess.Tacos are a bit dry without salsa  but tastes amazing with some mild salsa and green sauce. Service was slower  but that s cause they make everything super fresh.
Pueblo Viejo,107,Looking for some authentic tacos in Austin  I know everyone says they have the place  but I m telling you  after searching near and far - Pueblo Viehs is the place.   The menu isn t huge and that s what I love about it. They do a few things really well and stick to what they know. The flavors are awesome and I love getting tacos on corn shells.   Try the veggie taco and pair it with the habanero sauce. You can thank me later.
Pueblo Viejo,108,Pueblo Viejo was recommended to me for its breakfast tacos. So I made the trip to one of its locations in The North Door  a music venue by night.  The menu is smaller which suggested to me that they know what they do well. I placed my order for two tacos and proceeded into the open area in front of the stage which had a number of large tables. In the middle of the room was a cart with a large colorful selection of very different and delicious salsas. We grabbed some water  a few cups of salsas and waited for our order.   When the tacos were brought out  I was immediately surprised as how big they were. These were not the small tacos you get at most food trucks. Another observation was that Pueblo Viejo really loves beans. I mean  like REALLY loves beans. The tacos were tasty and filling  in no small part because of the beans .   Overall  the tacos were tasty and fresh  but did not meet the billing as best breakfast tacos in Austin  in my humble opinion.
Pueblo Viejo,109,Tastes like grandma s cooking  The meats on the tacos weren t to salty or bland just the right amount of seasoning to compliment the salsas.  We had the Pueblo Viajo Nes fish  and Barbacoa quesadilla.  Barbacoa was very tender and juicy.  Fish Taco wasn t too dry and combined with the the onions well.   Nes taco my favorite of the four items  had two meats which complimented one another well.  Pueblo Viejo taco didn t live it up for me. I remember biting into and thinking meh. It tasted bland compared to the Nes.  Salsas    Black  was really smoky and mildly hot. It was my first time eating  this salsa. I asked the lady what it was she told me it was habanero and jalapenoes. Spice level  4  Orange  this was like a creamy habanero sauce. One of my favorite sauces. Spice level 3.5  Creamy green  creamy jalapeno tasted well while not being to creamy. Spice level 3  Verde was the least spicy of all the sauces.   Overall great place  only downfall was that there is no indoor seating so on cold days be prepared 
Pueblo Viejo,110,Just ordered about  50 worth of tacos to-go for my friends and I. These tacos looked like something I could have made at home  not flavorful and very oily. I ordered a mix of their regular tacos and almost all of their specialty tacos.  I ve had better at stand-alone taco trucks. I came here from the reviews I read online and I won t be coming back  for tacos at least .
Pueblo Viejo,111,Literally the best tacos to ever grace my mouth. Went there for breakfast on a rainy day in Austin midst all the construction around. It was absolutely fantastic.   Although it may seem like a  hole in the wall  its actually positioned at the opening of a large venue. Very interesting and very worth it.
Pueblo Viejo,112,Great taco spot  The al pastor is the best here. Plates are a great option with rice and beans. The hot salsa is good. Also tried the mango drink which was excellent. They have outdoor seating as well
Pueblo Viejo,113,The tacos here were divine  Plenty of outdoor seating this place shares its space with an events venue which I kinda liked because it meant there were lots of people around which felt safer to be there. Now onto the food  Everything my husband and I tried was amazing. The fish tacos  al pastor tacos  Taco nes  viejo style and a steak mushroom one  The horchata was also so amazing  All the meats were so flavorful and even the veggies seasoned very well. Plus the salsa was perfection.
Pueblo Viejo,114,It s crazy to think it took 4 years to try this place again  but I m glad I came back. This time  theyre actually a small brick and mortar attached to a venue. It s a little weird walking in at first  but those chefs deserve to do their magic in the A C.   I ended up with the Don Chago and Lamb Barbacoa. I think it s crazy that they don t emphasize that their Barbacoa is lamb  but maybe that would scare people away. The lamb had a greasy  gamy flavor that kept me coming back for more with each bite. My only complaint was some bites were not as tender as they could have been. Perhaps they didnt cook it long enough  Beyond this  I was highly satisfied with this taco.  The Don Chago is pure satisfaction. Every ingredient stood out  while all together harmonious. The beans had a great lardo flavor  the bacon was crisp and porky  the avocado was fresh  and the cheese was gooey and sharp.   After some time  Im still not disappointed in thsi place. Im so happy they are now a brick and mortar and I hope their business forever thrives.
Pueblo Viejo,115,Our last Day in Austin  on the way out of town  I put my foot down and said I was NOT leaving until I had breakfast tacos.  Um  I wish I had clarified that I never wanted to leave and instead wanted to pitch a tent and eat truck tacos for the rest of my life.   Anyway  this was the closest truck open on a Sunday morning so off we went.   Holy hell  I hadn t expected to die and go to heaven so early   I had the  1 taco  forgot the name  which was egg  chorizo and potatoes. KILL ME  please. My life is meaningless if I can t eat this everyday. Even my husband who doesn t like the food truck scene  what   grounds for divorce  right   said they were fantastic.   I also had one that was beans  bacon and avocado. I somehow missed it had no eggs  mostly focused on avocado. The bacon was amazing - thick and crispy- and topped with an entire half an  cado. Yum. Good  but needed hot sauce.   I would love to try lunch dinner options  but alas I m back home  only my sweet memories to enjoy.
Pueblo Viejo,116,This restaurant was an excellent choice as we made our way to the airport.  Just a few miles from downtown  the food was fresh  delicious and beautiful.  We split the gordita platter  amazing guacamole  each with rajas con queso and I had a fish taco. There was so much food.  The platter came with rice  refried beans and guacamole. The service was excellent as well.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in Austin 
Pueblo Viejo,117,Food had no seasoning  no flavor  rude workers customer service. Only good thing was the horchata besides that don t waste your money overpriced  amp  the food isn t even worth a dollar  any other place would be better than this place. Sorry.
Pueblo Viejo,118,Amazing food  Very authentic. Just taking a point off for cleanliness because I could see them making the food infront of me and it didn t look like they cleaned the grill or the griddle often.  I went here twice with my friends for lunch when I was visiting Austin. They have a seating area  which I am guessing is where a live band plays at night. The seating area is kind of quirky and cool. They had closed that area one day as they were shooting a movie. They do have some outdoor seating as well  but we just got the food to-go because it was super cold.  I would definitely recommend this place to get some authentic Mexican food if you are in downtown Austin 
Pueblo Viejo,119,As other reviewers have mentioned this tiny taco counter is a bit hidden but 100  worth the effort to find. The entrance is combined with a music venue called the North Door. There are picnic tables outside or you can eat inside the empty music hall during the day. The taco plate comes with two tacos  chips  guacamole  and beans or you can order single tacos on either corn or flour tortillas.  If you are in the area definitely go grab breakfast  lunch  or both.
Pueblo Viejo,120,Supreme tacos  Oh my   These tacos tickled my tastebud s in delight and left me wanting for more.. My sister and I ended up   Publo Viejo twice in one day. We arrived to Austin early for lunch.. and enjoyed their breakfast tacos and chicken enchilada that we ended up splitting. Ended up coming back late at night for a late meal before heading to our AirBnB. For dinner  I ended up getting the same taco I had for lunch earlier in the day.. a soft flour tortilla wrapped up in tender refried beans  potatoes and avocado.. simple and delish  My sister and I split the chicken quesadillas for dinner. The plate was loaded with refried beans  guacamole  and a hearty and cheesy portion of quesadillas loaded with chicken. I love the flavor of their chicken.. its strong and nicely marinated. Their are so many options on the menu of Pueblo Viejo. It has something for everyone.. they even have salads and soups for a lighter fare. I totally recommend this shabby spot when visiting Austin.
Pueblo Viejo,121,Listennnnn I am in awe at the flavors that come out of this establishment. When I came to Austin  everyone told me I had to eat the brisket. I wasted my time standing in line for brisket when I could have been eating the tacos from Pueblo Viejo. Forget the brisket  these tacos are hands down the best tacos I ve ever have in my 25 years of existence. I ordered the quesadilla taco and the Pueblo viejo taco and it changed my life. I m from the east coast and if I could I would fly to Austin every weekend to eat these tacos  they re that good. Don t waste your time eating tacos anywhere else in downtown Austin. Oh and the horchata is to die for.
Pueblo Viejo,122,I m not really a fan of Mexican food unless it s really authentic and or cheap.  Luckily sometimes they go hand in hand.  My boyfriend wanted tacos so we decided to venture on foot to a place with decent yelp reviews.  From our hotel it was about a mile walk.  The weather was good so I didn t mind.  We did have to venture past a pretty sketchy part of town though.  Kind of sad about the amount of homelessness that seems prevalent.    The food was decent.  I liked the atmosphere.  Seemed pretty hip.  The local birds started getting aggressive about picking up nachos.  It was cute how people brought their dogs.  There s a port a potty towards the back but I didn t really feel like trying it.  Overall a pretty cool experience and the service was decently fast and friendly.
Pueblo Viejo,123,Where should I start their food sucks the stupid lady in the cashier had a attitude for no reason bad service never again
Pueblo Viejo,124,A little hidden- located inside the first door of the theatre but so worth finding   The Brisket and Pueblo Viejo tacos were amazing. The brisket taco was different than any other I ve had- it was made from lamb which made it a little lighter but still super flavorful. The Pueblo Viejo had super tender steak and delicious veggies.   They had picnic benches outside to eat at which was very pleasant  The other people in line were regulars  which for someone out of town is always a good sign 
Pueblo Viejo,125,I was on a bike ride exploring Austin for the day  since I was only in town for a day  and decided to make a special trip to Pueblo Viejo. Here s why I gave them 5 stars   First  I couldn t really spot the place because I thought it was a food truck. I called in and they spotted me on my bike to wave me into the restaurant.   Second  they let me bring me bike inside to make sure it was secure.  Third  and most important  the tacos I had were delicious   Taco Margarita and Tico Taco  both breakfast tacos  the Tico was my favorite  I had an ice cold Coke as well.  I d definitely come back if I m ever in Austin again.
Pueblo Viejo,126,Was just in Austin and went looking for some fabulous tacos. PV did not disappoint. My sister and I each I ordered two - one with steak  amp  veggies and the other with lamb barbacoa. Both tacos were both close to perfect and much larger than most soft tacos - way more than enough for me  Came with delicious red salsa and green  avo  amp  jalape o  i think  crema.  So delicious  Only downside is I went back a couple days later to finding them unexpectedly closed for the rest of the day.  Clearly I must return soon to Austin.
Pueblo Viejo,127,In Los Angeles we only have breakfast burritos.  They are ubiquitous and a staple of the breakfast and brunch scene. Alas  there is a dearth or complete absence of breakfast tacos in LA and after three breakfast tacos at Pueblo Vieja  I feel deprived.  The breakfast tacos are served piping hot which was greatly appreciated  but do precede with caution I scalded my gum in the first bite  but the pain was worth the rest of the meal.  I had a Migas Taco  migas is a tortilla chip and egg breakfast dish like chilaquiles  but at least at Pueblo Vieja less saucy  on a flour tortilla.  I had a Taco Azteca which is egg  jalape o and a bacon ham scramble in a flour tortilla.  I also ordered the Taco Viejo which is an egg and chorizo Taco best served on corn tortillas.  I d prefer if they served fresh squeezed orange juice with the tacos but you can always pick that up nearby.  Awesome breakfast tacos 
Pueblo Viejo,128,Breakfast tacos were awesome. Chips we re warm.  11 for 2 tacos chips and salsa and a bottle of water. Tacos are made to order so you gotta wait a few minutes. Totally worth it.  Oh  huge serving of chips served warm. Worth it.
Pueblo Viejo,129,This place Was spectacular. I loved the vegetarian taco. One of the best Mexican meals I have ever had.
Pueblo Viejo,130,This is honestly the best taco spot I have ever been to in Austin and I m born  amp  raised from Austin. If you haven t been here you shouldn t definitely try it out.
Pueblo Viejo,131,great tacos   We got some breakfast ones and truly delicious. Like my boyfriend said  taste like his moms cooking  felt authentic.
Pueblo Viejo,132,It s been a week since I visited Pueblo Viejo on a recent vacation  and I still wake up every morning craving breakfast tacos. Conveniently located just steps outside our Airbnb  we ate there three or four times on our long weekend trip.  My favorites were the Don Chago  avocado  beans  bacon and cheese  and the Mi Madre  veggies galore   but the Migas taco and the Tico taco were delicious as well. Don t forget to load up on the sauces -- there s tons of them and some really pack a kick    Easy to eat  affordable  and fresh -- I ll be trying to make these at home in NC  but I know mine won t be anything like this.
Pueblo Viejo,133,Came here because of the ratings  it didn t disappoint. I ordered the Pueblo viejo combo and my husband had taco nes and fish tacos  work a side of rice. They were soooo good and heart. The salsa is  literally
Pueblo Viejo,134,Amazing Tex mex  We had the pueblo viejo  avocado taco  and fish taco. All were scrumptious and super flavorful. The steak was nice and tender and the fish was also perfectly pan fried. The tacos had a good amount of Veges and sauce. Love this place will be back   One warning though - the tables they have there are not the cleanest and some flies and bugs flying around so if you re not into that kinda place when you re eating  I guess this place is not for you   Or you can buy it to go and bring it somewhere else 
Pueblo Viejo,135,I stopped here for lunch with my mom right after getting into town to kick off my house hunting trip  and it was the perfect choice  In hindsight  they were the best tacos we had the entire weekend. They had multiple vegetarian options which seems to be rare.   I ordered fish tacos which were delicious  I have no clue what they were seasoned with but it was super tasty. My mom ordered the guac taco and she LOVED it  she said it was super fresh and had a lot of vegetables beans on it which she loves. I ate 2 tacos in flour tortillas and felt full  they were a good size. The only thing I regret is that we were in a bit of a rush  and we completely missed the sauces and my taco definitely could have used some spice but I tend to like things really spicy.  The 4 star  rather than 5 star  rating is due to the service. The staff wasn t the friendliest when we were there  could have just been an off day. I will definitely be going back to enjoy their tacos again 
Pueblo Viejo,136,We ordered the specialty plate which came w rice beans. Located right around the corner from 6th street the tacos are made at a fairly quick speed and are made right. My favorite was the barbacoa because it s barbacoa. The taco nes was also very good with the chorizo helping it stand out. Order the tacos with a Mexican coke and your set.
Pueblo Viejo,137,This place is still my favorite. They are no longer a food truck  they have a small location. However it has some nice seating outside  be sure to wear a hat since there s no shade.  The food was great. My husband had two Barbacoa  lamb  tacos. Which are very well filled and were delicious. He also ordered a burrito which is very large but delicious. I had the chilaquiles which were amazing.  True Mexican food at its finest.   Every time I m in Austin  this is a must stop 
Pueblo Viejo,138,Visiting Austin for the weekend and planned out all the food experiences. Saw the reviews online and had to see what all the fuss was about. It was a short  but hot   walk from our hotel and when we arrived  just a couple people waiting and a couple ordering.  We got 7 tacos  3 breakfast and 4 from the main menu  coffee  water  and limeade. I m usually an only water tea drinker but after the walk  limeade sounded delicious and it was soooo refreshing and awesome  bf thought it was sweet . Coffee was good too  super smooth. The tacos were amazing    I think my favorites were the guaca steak taco and taco nes. Depending on if you like chicharones  the salsa Verde was legit. The breakfast ones my bf picked out  we like the one with jalapeno and the one with bacon beans cheese avocado. We didn t try any chicken tacos  And maybe had one that had pork  Oh and I liked the pueblo viejo taco... Ok I just like this place   Definitely believe people when they say the tacos are filling  since I think about 2-3 tacos each is the right way to go about it. The variety was fun though - one time only stop - and the total for everything was under  30.   Wish I could come back sooner than later 
Pueblo Viejo,139,I was in for SXSW  and after a night of drinking  a morning of sessions  we decided a greasy burger or really good tacos were in order. After a quick Yelp  Search  tacos it is. On the app it looks like it was close  so we walked. It was a bit of a walk and was also in a neighborhood that was a little sketchy. We persevered and made it to our destination.   Did I mention that this is a food truck   While it looked a little scary  the food was awesome. I ordered two tacos...Pueblo Viejo and one that featured avocado Avotaco  . Both were amazing. The beans were also great.   What I didn t enjoy was the house behind it that was a shack with several chihuahuas hanging out...I know it has nothing to do with the food truck  but it made me kind of sad.   Anyway  back to the food...I m impressed with what they pull off in such a tiny place. Definitely a great lunch and something I ll remember.
Pueblo Viejo,140,I ordered the Burrito  amp  my mans ordered Taco de Pastor. Very tasteful  amp  the tortillas were real good. The horchata drink was the BEST.  amp  in conclusion  they had great customer service  amp  were extremely nice.
Pueblo Viejo,141,My wife and I had the fish taco and taco nes  chips and four different kinds of salsa  green  orange   black  and red - watch out the black is rich  thick  and really hot . We also had freshly made horchata and freshly squeezed lime aid to drink. Wow  everything was excellent.
Pueblo Viejo,142,Tacos were ok.   Nothin stuck out as great. But the reason for the 2 stars- bad service. Food came out fast-ish    But the register girl didn t even look at me  smile or anything. Took my order then turned her back to me after making a  omg I hate my job  face then kinda slammed my tacos down when they were ready.  I just got back from vacation and this isn t how I wanted to be welcomed back home.  Maybe quit hiring teenagers Pueblo Viejo. Or just fire the girl at the cosmic location
Pueblo Viejo,143,Pueblo Viejo   or  poor nephew  was a very satisfying taco I would use the word hearty . Strong Australian influence I think because they look like a hole skillet of outback Steakhouse fajita emptied into a tortilla. Very photogenic food . Lots of construction workers there to so u kno its filling an healthy. Had the signature taco an the taco guaco w chicken an left happy
Pueblo Viejo,144,Really high 4. These tacos are great.   The location is a bit strange as it s located inside a music venue  but during the day there are tables and chairs to  eat-in.    I went for breakfast and they were delicious. I ordered the Don Chago  Taco Viejo  and washed it down with a horchata. It was delicious. Have I said delicious yet      I d liked to try their tacos at lunch but I can attest their breakfast tacos are worth getting out of bed for 
Pueblo Viejo,145,I really liked this place located inside the North Door venue. The cost   was palatable.... very inexpensive Mexican fare at a great cost. I ordered the chicken quesadilla with black beans and rice...very tasty. This is Mexican fast food at it s finest cooked with passion but served  to go . They make the typical fare here  Tacos  quesadillas and burrito s.
Pueblo Viejo,146,awesome tacos came by twice during my trip  because they were so good the chorizo here is super tasty and their breakfast tacos are on point even their carne asada is juicy and flavorful  their flour tortillas are perfect and their salsas are bomb a def must
Pueblo Viejo,147,The best tacos ever.  Looks like a hole in the wall but the taste is outstanding. Tacos made to order. I had the El Pastor and the Guac Taco with chicken. They were huge.  Would definitely recommend.
Pueblo Viejo,148,My friend highly recommended this place for their simple tacos. This was our first try of Texas tacos and wow  they did not disappoint. This food truck is on 6th street in a little gated area with a couple of other trucks. There were tables with benches and chair around fire pits where you could eat your food. We had a late dinner and I was really hungry so I got the specialty taco plate - 2 specialty tacos  beans  guacamole  salsa  and chips. I ordered the fish taco and the chicken quesadilla taco. I somehow ended up with the vegetable taco instead of the fish taco  but it was still delicious. My friends and I devoured our food pretty quickly before heading to The White Horse a couple of blocks away.
Pueblo Viejo,149,I have been to Pueblo Viejo a couple of times now but never this location. I enjoyed the space in this location as well as all the table seating. As for the food I m going to start with the salsa that comes with the chips. I could eat this salsa for they rest of my life  that is how much I enjoy it. The tacos are always perfect  I normally get the Taco Nes. I will continue to come here every time I come to Austin. This is a must try 
Pueblo Viejo,150,They made sure to get the people who ordered after me their food 1st. No order in place but the food was good. Disappointing that there wasn t even any acknowledgment that I was being skipped over consistently.   I normally wouldn t have been so annoyed but my wife and puppy were outside waiting for 45 minutes in the sun and they didn t even have any water for the pup.   Won t be back.
Pueblo Viejo,151,If you re looking for authentic Mexican food  look no further. The burritos are a reasonable price  taste really good  and will fill you up. The gorditas are awesome as well. Stuffed to the brim with meat and the other fixings  it doesn t disappoint. The service is friendly and super fast  I only waited five minutes after ordering. Will definitely be coming back
Pueblo Viejo,152,Simply outstanding tacos  Ordered for delivery  so I really can only speak to the amazing taste of the Al Pastor and chicken tacos. So so good.
Pueblo Viejo,153,Great breakfast tacos  I usually get the chorizo con huevo and bacon egg and cheese on flour. Their Serrano and habanero salsa s are amazing if you like spice. Also  the horchata is really good too. Solid place for breakfast tacos. Only bad thing I would say is they are a little on the pricey side.
Pueblo Viejo,154,After a night out in East Austin  this is the spot  Granted it was the truck still open in the area  but still  If there were other trucks open I would more than likely still gravitate here.  Open late  friendly people  amazing food when you have the drunk munchies. The Steak Quesadilla Taco is my jam. Smother it in their amazing sauce and enjoy 
Pueblo Viejo,155,Went to this place once and it was satisfactory. I assumed I could trust so during the quarantine. Either my Postmates delivery driver recooked and delivered the food or something went wrong with my order. My investment of  55 did not go in my tummy. I am so dissatisfied  the food was not edible and disappointingly even chips and salsa were missing.
Pueblo Viejo,156,Delicious  authentic tacos. 5  types of salsa. Right off of east 6th. Just a hop skip and a jump from downtown. Go here for some lip smacking bundles of joy. Fuck taco deli. Fuck torchys. Go here   I had the Al Pastor taco  the steak taco  and the steak nes taco. Al pastor was bomb diggity. Steak taco was what dreams are made and the steak nes was good but nothing to write home about. Will definitely just get two of the al pastor next time. Ate too quickly to take pictures  forgive me . I will definitely be back.
Pueblo Viejo,157,I ordered a quesadilla taco with steak  barbacoa and al pastor. Came here due to high ratings but have to agree with the reviews that say this place tacos are flavorless  The woman taking my order was nice. Due to the pandemic we did not eat indoors so we had our food to-go  amp  the woman hanging out the orders brought it to our car that was parked out front.
Pueblo Viejo,158,I stopped by here right before getting my hair cut.  It is literally only a block away from Method Hair salon   The guys were really nice and the food was good   It was really fresh and super hot  temperature     I got the veggie taco which was delicious 
Pueblo Viejo,159,The first location we went to was closed but thank you Jesus  Allah  Buddha  the second location was open and the best part  their seating    Outside of a bar  their seating consists of wooden picnic benches. Yeah your typical Austin seating. But wait... it gets better. There s a thedder ball post outside  That s right  You can play while you eat  That was by far the best part.   Now let s talk food. First of y all you need to get there early cuz they run out of a lot of stuff. I wanted the fish taco  which they didn t have.   I got one veggie taco and one steak taco. Veggie taco would have been good if it were on flour tortilla. Yeah that s another thing  she didn t even ask if we wanted corn or flour tortilla. Who eats corn tortillas      The steak taco was juicy and saucy and just damn perfect. Perfect  But it would have been better if it was on flour.   Oh and food is HOT  So be careful.   Pricing is good.  7 for two tacos on a Saturday night. That s a deal 
Pueblo Viejo,160,Tacos from a food truck. I felt like these tacos were very very oily but the portions were awesome. Idk if I will return but glad I tried it. There s plenty of seating by the truck as well.
Pueblo Viejo,161,I went here for breakfast during ACL. I looked for somewhere without a line  with seating  and with good tacos for me to show my non-Texan visitors. I found all of those things here.  First  I was thrilled by the selection of different salsas available. The salsa verde was good  and their classic red salsa was wonderful.  I got the taco nes twice  and the barbacoa taco was really delicious too. Pretty much any taco you see will be delicious  so just pick the one with the ingredients you most want   The seating area is cool. The kitchen is connected to another room  which seemed to be a theater or a concert space. Yes  we ate on foldable plastic tables and chairs. However  it was spacious and fun to look around.  Such a neat place  Besplace for an inexpensive meal.
Pueblo Viejo,162,Nestled off 35 in a food truck park sits Pueblo Viejo. There is a...wait  What am i talking about  It used to be a food trailer  but it s a restaurant now  And it s tasty good  Today  my best friend and I were hungry. We wanted our regular breakfast place  but there was a long-assed line out the door and people weren t wearing masks. I pulled up Yelp and this place was our first choice. We looked at it and went there. We both had the Quesadilla Plate. The Quesadillas were overflowing with cheese and steak. Every bite was meat and cheese. Ill be going back.
Pueblo Viejo,163,Tried the Taco Nes and Quesadilla Taco.  If you need a quick bite  stop by here and grab some Taco s.
Pueblo Viejo,164,We liked the Chago and a couple other tacos here on a dreary afternoon where no other customers were around.   Don Chago  2.50  Subtotal  2.50 Sales Tax  8.25    0.21  Total  2.71
Pueblo Viejo,165,Stopped in for breakfast.  Excellent egg  cheese  and chorizo tacos   Dont let the dance floor with temporary tables fool you  the food is first rate   Friendly and quick service. A bit of interior decor would be nice  perhaps some movable potted plants 
Pueblo Viejo,166,Too good  Love this place... one of those stops you didn t expect to be so solid cause it s a bar but really good tacos   Would def come back when I m back in Austin 
Pueblo Viejo,167,if you re actually mexican  this food sucks. I ordered AL PASTOR and i m from san antonio so i know what actual good mexican food is.. and this is not genuinely good at all. I ordered from door dash and the name says al pastor tacoS and it was 2 dollars per order so i assumed it was it at least more than one. BUT ITS JUST FOR ONE TACO AND THIS ISNT EVEN AL PASTOR ITS SOME TYPE OF CHEAP TORTILLA WITH CHORIZO. the beans taste like they re from the can.. maybe even worse. the rice and bean sides were two dollars each and they both fit in a little cup. i m truly very disappointed.
Pueblo Viejo,168,I went to the one parked outside Craftsman on East Cesar Chavez last night. I ordered a Don Chago and a Taco Bueno. My friend had two Al Pastor tacos and she ordered some guac and chips. The guac was amazing  there was a ton of it too  we couldn t even finish it all. She said her tacos were good but had too much cilantro. She ate one  but just couldn t finish the second  she said it just wasn t as good as the first. I was so ready for that breakfast for dinner deliciousness  unfortunately I was really disappointed. The beans in the Don Chago were salty  and I mean salty to the point of it covering up any flavor the taco might have had. The bacon was crunchy  but was flavorless against the beans. I scooped the beans off  but having the bacon mixed in I kind of just ended up with avocado and tortilla. The Taco Bueno was not salty  but the eggs were very overcooked. I picked most of those out and just had the potatoes  cheese and tortilla as most of the chorizo went with the eggs.   I think it might have been an off night  or the guy might have been rushing. The price is definitely amazing  guac is amazing  so I ll give it another chance if I m ever there again  but fingers crossed that they handle the salt situation. I m giving 3 stars and not 2 because of the guac and the price  and the guy was super sweet and the food came out fast.
Pueblo Viejo,169,Found this place on Yelp and stopped by for tacos and horchata. Everything that we ordered was great  I had the fish taco and the Al Pastor and loved them both. The Al Pastor was pretty spicy  so if you aren t into spice  pass on that taco and go for something else  there are a ton of options.   The food is ready quickly and the staff is very friendly. My boyfriend ordered the horchata and said it was some of the best he had had in a while. If you like horchata  definitely get a glass here. If you don t like horchata but want to  like me  try it at Pueblo Viejo  In my mind  this is as good as it gets.   Tacos are cheap so order a few different ones to see which you like best.   Not a ton of seating but we came at a quieter time on a Friday evening so we didn t have to share our table.
Pueblo Viejo,170,We used to frequent the Pueblo Viejo food truck often and it quickly became one of our favorite taco spots in Austin. We have visited the new brick and mortar location on three occasions now  and sadly the business has gone down hill. The food is delicious  but the customer service is terrible.  I ordered a specialty taco plate  it is supposed to come with two specialty tacos  beans  chips and guacamole. Price is  9.90. I asked for cheese with one of the tacos and my total came to  11.19. Upon delivery there was no chips and no cheese on the taco. When I approached the counter the two men working the register and orders argued with me about my order  then proceeded to take other orders before rectifying mine. Hope they find a way to solve their customer service issues.
Pueblo Viejo,171,I love this place so very much.  They catered our post wedding reception this past weekend and were excellent.  So much so that we ran out of taco s in the first two hours  when we expected to have enough to last 4 hours .  I will continue to visit this place and if I ever have another party that requires a taco truck  this is my place.  Thanks 
Pueblo Viejo,172,The tacos are pretty solid but what makes place is meat and salsa. I thought the tortilla is what made it under whelming. Overall one of the better taco places in Austin   can t go wrong here but pastor isn t as good as you d get in Valley or MX.
Pueblo Viejo,173,THE BOTTOM LINE  Open early  7am . Fat  beautiful breakfast tacos. Great location  right past the highway if you re coming from downtown .  There s also a Pueblo Viejo food truck on E Caesar Chavez in front of the Craftsman bar at night -- it s a different truck  but I m assuming they re affiliated.  Menu is here   a href  https   www.yelp.com biz_photos pueblo-viejo-austin select Od1Mwu4ppqA26HnuvEyLmg  yelp.com biz_photos pueb   a . Thanks  Yelp   Breakfast menu is here   a href  https   www.yelp.com biz_photos pueblo-viejo-austin select d2dPYzNYhKk3m4z7NphyyQ  yelp.com biz_photos pueb   a   THE SPACE  In a  you guessed it  parking lot. There s a bunch of bright picnic tables in front  so seating is ample although likely shared. There s no covered space  so cross your fingers for no rain   FOOD    taco don chago - bacon cheese beans and avocado in a fluffy tortilla of your choice  I opted for flour . Huge slices of avocado and really fatty and crispy bacon. Perfection    taco viejo - chorizo  egg  potato  and beans. Soft potatoes and crispy chorizo.   My main gripe with many breakfast tacos are poor filling to tortilla ratio  important.  and fillings that are too wet -- Pueblo Viejo did both perfectly. Come here if tacos for lunch and dinner just won t cut it and you re intent on adding a third taco meal to your day.
Pueblo Viejo,174,Hands down to one of the best taco trucks in Austin  My hubby and I have came by this place for brunch before we drove back to Dallas. We got four different specialty tacos - Pueblo Viejo Style  Taco Nes  Guaca taco  and the Quesadilla taco.   When you bite into the tacos. The steak  chicken  and chorizo were so juicy and just full of awesomeness. You literally can taste each ingredient in the tacos. Fresh and cooked to perfection. From the cilantro  tomatoes  lettuce  avocados to the main meat. We were struggling to finish our last taco because they were filling. Their portions for the specialty tacos were definitely worth the  3  price. Oh and don t forget to end every bite with their horchata.   Definitely coming back here to try their plates and breakfast tacos 
Pueblo Viejo,175,Visiting Austin I had tacos and bbq as the game plan  This tucked away spot is the best tacos I had  northeast guy   Reasonable price  quick service  standard mild through hot sauce  and fresh ingredients  Its the bomb
Pueblo Viejo,176,Great tex-mex around downtown.  They have some really great al pastor and steak tacos but the tortilla is just your run of the mill corn and flour. The portions are huge and 2 tacos is probably a good meal for most people. I really really wish they used handmade tortilla though. That would be perfect.
Pueblo Viejo,177,My new favorite breakfast tacos. Hands down  Their red salsa is amazing  everything is fresh and cooked to order. The Azteca Taco was so good that I was sad when I finished it. Oh well  I guess I ll have to wait til they open tomorrow to get another one.
Pueblo Viejo,178,Yummmy tacos  Good selection of salsas too  I always try a new taco and I m always impressed.
Pueblo Viejo,179,Absolutely the best STEAK tacos I have ever tasted. Their salsas are SPICY          The red one is mild . You will not be disappointed- great place       They have warehouse seating so not the most comfortable but WELL WORTH IT 
Pueblo Viejo,180,Wowwwwww  my wife found this place on yelp and im so glad she did  I had 1 steak taco and 2 of the chicken tacos  It was all amazing  rojo salsa was delish... and i could have just gotten two tacos as they re stuffed with meat  They were so good i had to go back inside and let the owners know how good it was  Cant wait to take some friends to this hole in the wall taco spot  Yummo 
Pueblo Viejo,181,Incredible fish and lamb tacos. Came with chips salsa refried beans guac lettuce and sauces for  11. The fish flavor will be calling me back when I m in town again... Unfortunately no beer available at lunch time  so had some water and picked up a pint a couple of blocks away.
Pueblo Viejo,182,I ve been to Pueblo Viejo many times and have to say that they have some of the best most authentic tacos in Austin. Every time I come  I get the Specialty Taco Plate which comes with 2 tacos and chips  amp  guacamole. The guacamole is fresh and delicious. One of the tacos I ll get is the Taco al Pastor. The al pastor meat has a lot of flavor and I love that it has pineapple in it. Another taco I ll get is the Taco Nes which is steak  amp  chorizo  also rich in flavor. Their tacos here are low priced and come with huge portions of meat. The service is quick and I m always highly satisfied to come here.
Pueblo Viejo,183,I ordered the al carbon taco plate which came with two pretty large tacos  beans  and guacamole. I would definitely come back again.
Pueblo Viejo,184,Very good  especially the breakfast taco. The others ended up being a little greasy  being left over  but still tasty when fresh
Pueblo Viejo,185,This place is bomb  I no longer live in Austin  but I used to live close by to this place and the chicken quesadilla is my favorite   The only downside is it shares the space with the theater next door and during the day the only place to sit is inside the theater. In the evenings if there is a show your only option is to get your food to-go.
Pueblo Viejo,186,I came here with friends on a Saturday morning after hearing so much rave from them. One of my friend is obsessed with this place and came here two times a day so I had some expectations. The line and wait was not horrible but there sure we re some people there. The seating area is not super organized with scattered chairs and tables but I think that adds  a unique dining experience. This is a great place to come the morning after a night out. The food is cheap and you get a good amount of food. I got the Taco Bueno and Don Chago and I really liked it  I m definitely coming back to try other tacos and I would recommend this to people. It sucks that they only open such a short period of time each day.
Pueblo Viejo,187,If you re in Austin for a day  go here. Even if you re in Austin for an hour  do yourself a favor by calling an uber and getting ur ass over here for the tacos. When I was I visiting Austin I was lucky enough to stay in an Airbnb right across the street and basically went there 2 of the 3 days I was in the city.   Find a seat at the picnic table and order urself some tacos to eat now...and then some to enjoy later.
Pueblo Viejo,188,Best tacos in Austin            Usually very busy and yet still criminally underrated. PARTICULARLY if you are a bean and cheese taco connoisseur  as I am. I just want to reiterate  these are the best beans in town      Also the best red and green salsas  Chicken taco is also  chefs kiss  Add on a limeade and you have the perfect meal
Pueblo Viejo,189,Pueblo Viejo is a semi permanent food truck located off of 6th street close to I-35.  I really wanted to love it  because we heard such great things  but I wasn t crazy about it.   The service was awesome  the people that work there are so nice  but the food was just OK.  I ordered the Guaco Taco and the Mexican Salad. The taco was ok  the chicken was very dry and the guac didn t taste very fresh  and the salad was not fresh. The lettuce was turning brown  and the vegetables in the salad did not taste good together.  What really ruined it for me was the amount of flies around. I understand that dining outside is difficult to control the elements  but both food trucks in the area had huge open garbage cans right by the dining area  that makes it a literal breeding ground for flies. I couldn t enjoy my meal because the flies kept landing on the food and we had to swat them away.   I may try it again  but we were still pretty disappointed.
Pueblo Viejo,190,Pueblo Viejo is about as charming as it gets  I love the brightly painted truck and the inviting space under a canopy of trees. It really is the perfect place to roll up w  a dog  or a book  or w  friends. Austin really is winning as a city just by virtue of being home to this lil  joint   The tacos are cheap and filling. The chips and salsa are tasty. And the guac is fresh and simple.
Pueblo Viejo,191,All I can say is get the horchata  absolutely delicious. I went ahead and created a horchatte  half coffee   half horchata   and it was the best pick-me-upper I ve had in awhile.  The ambience is very hipster with a projector with scenes of funny hipster shows really lightened my mood.  In terms of tex-mex  this was my first experience with it  and I have to say I was quite please. While I ve had plenty of good tacos in my lifetime  LA tacos    I felt these were very solid  not the best  but not too shabby. If you are daring enough  try their orange sauce  habanero    quite spicy and an unexpected way to get your morning lit.
Pueblo Viejo,192,By far the best tacos in town but they need a better system for takeout orders. When you go you have to wait in a giant line of hungry hipsters all ordering a billion tacos with substitutions while your food is just sitting there. They need a take out line but when they aren t busy it s a perfect experience.  Also somehow they are super busy but the food quality hasn t slipped at all. Just fix the takeout situation.
Pueblo Viejo,193,Austin  TX  Land of food trucks. Apparently there are about 900-1000 food trucks out in steed on an average day. In addition  these trucks make certain locations their permanent home. Pueblo Viejo is one of them.  A Mexican food truck that s open during normal working hours  7 30AM-5PM   serves pretty great tacos  When I came here  I got the Chorizo taco and the Margherita  named after the owner  taco. The Taco Bueno Fresh Tortilla had a good mix of chorizo  cheese  and Egg. On the other hand  the Margherita was your  vegetarian  type taco. I really liked both of them.  All in all  this food truck had definitely satisfied me  and I m very glad I had found it in the middle of East Austin. Not a gold coin in my book  but definitely a silver one 
Pueblo Viejo,194,Superb and authentic tex-mex food  Ordered taco plate with Pueblo taco and guacamole taco  which came with the chips and sauce  and it was very tasty.  The price is good too. Highly recommended.
Pueblo Viejo,195,Pueblo Viejo has some of THE best al pastor tacos that you could get in Austin. I d definitely recommend going and checking it out if you need a quick meal on the go or would like to have a picnic lunch with a few friends. The food is great and service is great  and quick as well . This is definitely a 10 10 and I d recommend it as a top taco place to try in the city.
Pueblo Viejo,196,These tacos changed my life.   I got two of the speciality tacos and they were incredible  Fast service  made freshly  and delicious.
Pueblo Viejo,197,True Austin Taco experience. Located inside a bar with a giant projector movie screen  I tried the Barbacoa which is made with slow roasted lamb  and the Pablo Viejo style taco with mushrooms and carne Asada. Extremely fresh food with genuine taste. Flavors are pungent and you can tell it s made with authenticity. I recommend getting a speciality plate as It offers beans  chips and guac   Try all the sauces as well   
Pueblo Viejo,198,Heard great things about this place and it didn t disappoint. It was a non descriptive building in an area under construction  so we had a hard time finding the place. Come to find out it is inside a concert hall. We got an assortment of every taco on the menu and a plate of guacamole. I highly recommend this place if you re in the area.
Pueblo Viejo,199,Amazing cheap tacos  they look beautiful and they taste delicious. If you re reading this review  GO TO PUEBLO VIEJO FOR BREAKFAST you won t be disappointed    I had two breakfast tacos  the Don Chago and the Magarita. I generally always order a veggie option when eating out so the Magarita was a welcome find but when it comes to breakfast tacos  nothing beats tacos with bacon so the Don Chago was my favorite of the two.  We walked up during a high traffic moment and thus waited quite a while for our food but if you ve made it this far in my review you know it was worth the wait.   The seating is ample  a mix between small circular tables  wooden spools painted bright colors and picnic tables. I came with a group of 4 and we each had 2 tacos and shared a wooden spool table and had plenty of room to scarf down our food.
Pueblo Viejo,200,Amazing tacos  can t express how much we enjoyed their food. The only regret I have is not stopping by there before we left town for more  The lady we ordered our food from was really helpful  amp  nice.   We ordered Taco Nes  amp  the chicken taco both were amazing 
Pueblo Viejo,201,I don t remember the last time I had tacos that were this good. The steak tacos were like a meal from God. It was honestly incredible. Sure  the price is a little bit high for tacos  but it was so worth it. The wait wasn t bad either  Honestly  this is the perfect taco joint for me 
Pueblo Viejo,202,The food was decent  but the service wasn t very good. They do give really big portion sizes which is a plus. I was a bit disappointed that I was charged an extra  1.25 for a side of sour cream. That s a bit excessive.
Pueblo Viejo,203,ALRIGHT  so this may well be timed perfectly with the very recent fake hype behind the great 2016 debate of Austin claiming ownership of breakfast tacos.  SO to begin  lil food truck and since I got there kinda early I will say I don t think they were fully staffed as a 3rd employee showed after I got my food  so the kinda slow service you usually expect from a food truck was on par.  To begin  I was told they don t make their own tacos  so in my book you cant even get on the list for best tacos that way. HOWEVER JUST TO BE FAIR TO THEM  I do see they are placed  right across the street from the larger independent producer of chips and tortillas El Milagro. In my opinion  it still ain t done right if you start by taking a tortilla out of a plastic bag.  Moving on.  Both of my tacos were very good  and ingredients and veggies seemed fresh so I have no complaints there.  Lastly  I know I probably shouldn t have expected good coffee  and should leave this review to the tacos but I over paid for what I thought was bad coffee so I had to throw that in too.
Pueblo Viejo,204,Before we went to Austin I kept reading that we needed to check out Tex Mex and food trailers. First of all  I m from CA and we re very picky about our Mexican food. Like  we ll eat gringo style but not regularly.   We stopped at Pueblo Viejo after a day of drinking and I was so happy we came here. I ordered the Migas  or as my bf called it   Bad and Boujee   even though it wasn t called Migos . I don t remember what he ordered because my dish was so good that I wasn t even paying attention to his dish. He probably ordered some tacos or something. Anyway  he said it was good. But  back to my dish. It came with a side of refried beans and they were bomb too. After eating  ok  inhaling  this dish I thought   Ok  I see you Austin  I m with this Tex Mex business.    I ll definitely be back for more of that bad and boujee.
Pueblo Viejo,205,This taco joint is as good as it gets for a hometown Austin taco. It s none of that  basic  wrap whatever in a tortilla and call it a taco  bullstuff. The chicken taco is perfect and is my personal fave  the seasoning is spot on with just the right amount of heat. The steak is just as great. Veggie lovers  they have you covered as well with more than a few options. The price is right and the tacos are fat. There is just enough variety to not be filler  and all of it is devine.  My only note  they tend to close early A LOT. More than half the time I wanted to run out and grab dinner it was closed. If you are planning to grab dinner close to closing time  do yourself a favor and give them a call before you make a trip for nothing.
Pueblo Viejo,206,Came here at about 1 30pm on a Friday since I was in the area.  Didn t know what to eat today so I figured I would try this food truck area.    I decided on the Pieblo Viejo Style and Guaca taco.  Both were very good and the meat was cooked well.  The Pueblo Viejo style tasted like an expensive burger minus the bun.  Both tacos brought out the taste in the ingredients and tasted really good despite being priced normally for a taco.  I ll definitely stop by here again for another taco.
Pueblo Viejo,207,I have never cared for the tacos in Texas  but I have never been to Austin before.  This food truck serves some wonderful steak  and fish tacos.  You will also get some great guacamole  and quesadillas.  I am not a fan of Tex-Mex food  but as I have always said the future is street food  and Pueblo Viejo delivers   Oh how I loved Austin  Texas 
Pueblo Viejo,208,The food here is amazing. Home Cooked. Made with love. Just the perfect amount of spicy. The Migas is delish for breakfast but the beef tacos are insane.
Pueblo Viejo,209,TACOS  Love love love breakfast tacos  and this taco truck did not disappoint. Not far from my hotel  I walked here with my pup and ordered some custom breakfast tacos.  The tacos here are huge and flavorful with plenty of salsa choices to choose from. The staff in the truck were friendly  They re open early and stay open late.   Quick  friendly service  I will for sure be back here for my breakfast needs when I m in town as I frequent Austin at least once a month.
Pueblo Viejo,210,One of the top tacos in town.  I had the fish taco with some nicely grilled fish and all the fixings.   Also had the veggie quesadilla taco which was great.  The guacamole was also quite nice.   Prices are right.  I will be back.
Pueblo Viejo,211,This place we went off of based solely on reviews.  We showed up to an empty dark lot with a few people eating around 10pm.  The 6th street crowd was out in full force.  Not knowing the area  I felt like we were always looking over our shoulder.  Food was great  a little messy and with no napkins to be found  we had to get creative. we really enjoyed our meal and the salsa once we decided to relax and watch the early drunks stumble while walking in oversized heals down the street.
Pueblo Viejo,212,Oops  I m sad I forgot to review this place because it was oh so good     Unfortunately I major effed up and douced my tacos in the salsa and subsequently died throughout the meal. So this 5 stars means that despite dying  it was still delish.   Anyways  it s a food truck  chill picnic bench seating like your typ Austin spot. Friendly service  normal prices. A few blocks off the end of 6th.
Pueblo Viejo,213,Incredibly delicious tacos  I ve eaten a lot of tacos in my day  and I ve eaten a lot of tacos in Austin  so I can confidently say these are some of the best I ve ever had. So fortunate to have Pueblo Viejo in our own backyard  I would HIGHLY recommend a visit whether you live here or are simply passing through.  Reasonable prices. Hot. Delicious.  I will be back soon and I ll be sure to bring friends 
Pueblo Viejo,214,Came here with my family while we were on a weekend trip to Austin. They just opened a couple days ago in this location. Bit of a hole in the wall but it s great  Service is very friendly  a little bit slow but we did have 6 people. The area where you eat is a bar club during the night  called The North Door  but they set up tables for their customers during the day.  Guacamole is delicious  lots of cilantro  Salsa is spicy but amazing. Guaco taco was great  my mom is a spinach enthusiast so she loved it. Al pastor is where it s at  Seriously you have to get this one. Steak was also great  probably my 2nd favorite. Chicken was good  not as good as steak or al pastor. Quesadilla taco was greasey  our least favorite.  Overall  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming Austin in search of AMAZING tacos 
Pueblo Viejo,215,We tried this place tonight and oh my gosh    It s SOOO GOOD    We had the enchiladas and they re wonderful  Flavorful and full of meat. The refried beans are good too  My new favorite will be the Viejo Taco with steak  mushrooms and avocado. I never thought about how mushrooms could just elevAte this taco   Yummy  I can t wait to order from here again 
Pueblo Viejo,216,I ordered from Uber eats. I had the quesadilla plate  two al pastor tacos  and a horchata. I was very pleased with my quesadilla  it came with guacamole  lettuce  and beans. I wish there was some pico and sour cream with it. It was quite greasy  but I wasn t mad at it. I LOVED my horchata  But the main reason why I m giving Pueblo Viejo 3 stars is  I was extremely disappointed in my al pastor tacos. I feel like it is a sin to serve dry and almost flavorless al pastor. It was dryer than a desert  I expected juicy marinated pork  cooked to perfection. Flavor bomb  nice char on the outside... I was also missing pineapple which is my favorite part. So unfortunate.
Pueblo Viejo,217,Oh my lord... where do I even begin  This place is so darn good. I came here around noon on a Saturday. There was a fairly substantial group of people at the entrance of the restaurant  which  as I have come to know  is usually a good sign. It took me a while to order  but I was craving breakfast tacos so much that I ended up ordering two margarita tacos  eggs spinach mushrooms . The area where you order is fairly small  but you can see into the open kitchen  where the cooks are chopping chilis out of crates before roasting them on the flattop. That s how you know it is the real deal. The tacos  along with their SPICY homemade salsas  were some of the best I ever had. There was an event going on in the warehouse space next door so I ate outside. I do not know how they did it  but they were some of the best tacos ever. I only wish I could grab a bottle of their green salsa. Only  5.50 for a filling  delicious lunch. Talk about a win win 
Pueblo Viejo,218,Cheap Breakfast Tacos that  Excite the taste Buds without inducing a long coma.
Pueblo Viejo,219,The tacos here are sooo good  They are made to order and full of flavor. Every time I m in Austin I make sure to stop by.
Pueblo Viejo,220,This place seems like it is in the middle of nowhere but well worth finding it. The tacos are awesome  It is certainly a no frills place - you eat on plastic table and chairs in a concert hall. Note that it was dog friendly 
Pueblo Viejo,221,Very good tacos  one of the best I have had in Austin  The venue of this place is a little weird  you walk into this little alcove area to order your food but then you can walk into this music venue looking space with plastic tables set up to eat your taco. It s no frills but the taco is definitely worth it. We had two types of quesadilla tacos  chicken and veggie  and the al pastor. All were delicious and served hot. Lots of locals also eating there during their lunch break so you know it s a good spot. Definitely make it a priority when in Austin.
Pueblo Viejo,222,The guy working that night realized  shit I have to work another hour  . Welcome daylight savings time. After a super long night of drinking my friend couldnt take it anymore and needed a food break. Got a stash of chicken tacos. Wow these things are bigger than I thought they d be with the chicken cut into large strips. I think it s technically 4am now but since the time change  we didnt know anymore. Bellies full we made our way back home.
Pueblo Viejo,223,Best tacos on earth. On par with Veracruz but much quicker turnaround with similar  amazing  quality 
Pueblo Viejo,224,Freshly sqeezed oj... Amazing guac... Really good hot sauce and salsas... The tortillas are fresh... The tacos are out of this world. My husband loved the migas and the refried beans. Everything was yummy. We will return  
Pueblo Viejo,225,We stumbled upon this little food truck area just east of the highway. Cheap foodie mecca  it was. After much ado  wandering back and forth and looking at all the menus  I decided I d give PV a shot. It really was super delicious  in addition to being fast and cheap. I loved my chicken taco  the tortillas were warm  the seasoning on the chicken was delish  and I gobbled it up.   I was a little sad about my beef taco. I didn t love the flavor of the seasoning  and since it is not a great cut of meat to begin with  you kind of need to love the flavor a lot to make it work. The standout was the freshest  most perfectly seasoned guac ever  with perfectly crisp chips.   If I had this meal to do over again  I d do chicken taco and the guac and be sittin  pretty.
Pueblo Viejo,226,Pretty good tacos  I had to taco plate with beans  guacamole and two al I pastor tacos. I also ordered a quesadilla taco which was also al pastor. One thing to note  we went at 6 pm on a Wednesday and there was no line  it s a little hole in the wall  but there is NO VALIDATED PARKING    We went based on a previous review a year ago and when we parked at the corazon parking structure on San Marco and presented our parking ticket the guy had absolutely no idea what we were talking about. We had picked this place due to the lack of free parking in Austin. Oh well
Pueblo Viejo,227,Got the  - fish taco plate  - chicken taco plate - mixture of delicious tacos.  The seasoning on the fish tacos was jam. The hot sauce is hot  fresh and delicious. The salsa is over the top. Guac is bomb. The food is cooked when you order it so it takes a few minutes but it s worth the wait. The corn tortillas are fresh and slightly crispy. They double them up but you d be ok with just one. There s so much meat jammed inside  they don t skimp out here. This might be my favorite taco on my taco America tour this far. Texas tacos are the best and Austin is one of the capitals of a good taco  fully represented via this fine food truck establishment.
Pueblo Viejo,228,I was craving some good tacos and this place served them right up. I ordered the quesadilla chicken taco and guaca steak taco- both were delicious. My husband order the quesadilla steak taco and the al pastor. No complaints here  Definitely a MUST VISIT taco place 
Pueblo Viejo,229,This place was amazing  I got the special taco special  comes with 2  special  tacos  beans  guacamole  and chips and salsa. The tacos are huge  the meat is super flavorful. Actually everything was seasoned very well. I just came from Lazarus Brewing and had a couple tacos there and they re so wack in comparison. Plus they have a cool huge seating area where you can relax  soak up some AC and watch a movie for free.
Pueblo Viejo,230,First time here  recommended by hotel bellman. Hole in the wall...usually the best food  part of a night club. Amazing breakfast tacos.
Pueblo Viejo,231,Visited Austin couple of weeks ago and yelped up some bomb ass places to eat. This food truck place popped up and caught our attention. Ordered bunch of breakfast tacos and boyfie got horchata as well. Boy the tacos are on point.  Made my belly super happy. If I am in Austin again  will definitely go back
Pueblo Viejo,232,One of the best taco places in Austin  Go for the pueblo viejo or quesadilla taco. You wont be disappointed   
Pueblo Viejo,233,Still on the search for my fav breakfast taco in east south Austin and although I don t see myself stopping in the foreseeable future  the migas here is truly phenomenal. Can t speak for any meat options  but to date I have never had a breakfast taco as tasty as this one. Prefer this over Veracruz and I ve left many good reviews for those guys as well. But this just doesn t compare imo. Pair this with a CBD cold brew from Cosmic and a table outside in the nice garden area and you re set up for a great morning any day of the week.
Pueblo Viejo,234,I assure you  despite the emphasis placed on vegan and veggie offerings by my fellow yelpers  Pueblo Viejo does offer meat-based items  and they re quite yummy     Now  I know what you are thinking   isn t all meat yummier than veggies by default   Yes  but the steak they use on the tacos is well-marinated  and tender  and juicy  and they put lots of it in the tacos.  As a matter of fact  the worst part of my steak chorizo avocado tacos was the unnecessary lettuce  luckily it is easily removed.  Yummy meat tacos  bad for hipsters  good for you 
Pueblo Viejo,235,located inside the door of north theater we walked by here by accident and recommended this place since it was hungry. the tacos are really good  especially the steak ones. we had more than one of course. prices are very decent and the service was fast.
Pueblo Viejo,236,Friendly staff. Beef and chicken taco  amazing. They re not stingy with the meat portions.
Pueblo Viejo,237,Tacos were okay. Not that impressed.   Quesadilla taco was better than the pastor though
Pueblo Viejo,238,Waking up in Austin a few weeks ago  and the search was on for Breakfast Tacos.  The others in the hotel all went to places nearby  but Pueblo Viejo had 4.5 stars  something no other place around us had.  We took the two-mile trek  my friend complained the whole way about the walk with the numerous other options  but then we ate the tacos.  These were fantastic and we would ve walked further.  We only had two days in Austin  and it was very tempting to come back for another visit.    Cheap  every ingredient was good  and it s in a parking lot with some very good tree cover so you won t burn alive.  Definitely come here.
Pueblo Viejo,239,Environment  Outdoor picnic style seating  What I ate   Fish Taco  amp  Tacones   What I think  The taco was great. The meat inside was cooked perfectly and tortilla was fresh and this place opens late. If you are close by you should definitely try.
Pueblo Viejo,240,Home of the best tacos in the world. The poblano pepper chicken tacos  the breakfast tacos  and of course  the al pastor...   I walked around Austin and bought a single al pastor taco from 15 different taco joints. This is hands down the best.  Fun fact  that harmless looking orange sauce they have is not chipotle mayo but in fact habanero as I found out after pouring it all over my taco   
Pueblo Viejo,241,I had the chance to try this place Sunday since I was working in the area. I ordered a Tico Taco  potato  bean  and avocado  and a Taco Don Chago  bean  bacon  cheese  and avocado . Both tacos were absolutely delicious and their salsa was good  too. I tried the creamy green salsa and whatever red salsa they threw in my bag.   They make the tacos fresh  so expect a bit of a wait  especially if large groups ordered ahead of you. I don t consider this to be a bad thing  though  because again - they re cooking them up fresh. Just more of a heads up.  Both of my tacos came to  5.14  before tip. That s not bad  honestly. Both tacos had plenty of filling without overflowing and they made them in such a way that there was no bean seepage. That is a pretty big deal in my book.   I m not in this area often  and certainly not at breakfast time  but next time I m around  I ll definitely go here for some tasty tacos.
Pueblo Viejo,242,Just tried the Al Pastor tacos and was pleasantly surprised. Not that it s hard to find good tacos in this town. There s plenty of options but this place has a home cooked quality to it. A bit pricey if I m being honest but hey not enough to stop coming back.
Pueblo Viejo,243,Sad for the price increase in the Pueblo Viejo style taco..but it only went up .40 cents...worth it still  Was introduced to this truck whenever I first moved here and there is only one other taco truck who can even compare to this one..Still my favorite  great prices and everyone I bring from out of town falls in love with it too   The Quesadilla taco...steak...all day
Pueblo Viejo,244,I was excited about this place after seeing it on a few lists online but  unfortunately  I was disappointed. I ordered Gorditas  a steak taco  and a side of rice. The side of rice was comically small  the taco had no flavor outside of the steak  no flavorful toppings   and the Gordita was stuffed with an overwhelming amount of sour cream.
Pueblo Viejo,245,I used to go to Pueblo Viejo allllll the time. But in the past year or so I ve been so disappointed. The quality is really inconsistent and my order is consistently wrong almost every time  forgetting requested ingredients  that I pay extra for  or just giving me the wrong order altogether and I don t realize until I m gone. A few times  okay no problem  but all the time  really frustrating.
Pueblo Viejo,246,Great tacos and fast service.  A very worthy taco truck  in fact one of the better food trucks out there. In a city where every food truck item costs you an arm and a leg Pueblo Viejo is a blessing to your wallet. Only con is eating outside the truck  it is in a swampy area so mosquitoes are rampant  but you can order online and pick up right away so there is not much standing around.
Pueblo Viejo,247,Great food. Nicest People. Great price. Fast. Authentic. Clean. Lame parking situation.
Pueblo Viejo,248,best mexican food in austin. no tx mex fake cheese  everything is fresh made and good
Pueblo Viejo,249,Chips were stale. Cheese dip was so thick you couldn t dip it.   After we ate we were going to get a to go container for the cheese so we could heat it at home and we were going to order dessert but she never even asked us and we didn t ha e a chance to ask.  She plopped our check down and quickly walked off.
Pueblo Viejo,250,Our chef at work is on vaca so he ordered everyone in the office tacos from this heavenly place. It s my first time and I was already excited because all my coworkers were raving about how good it is.  I got the cheese and egg taco and the al pastor and they were so good I got another two tacos and heartburn   Yay ....   I now have a favorite taco place DT. Go get some peeps. Now 
Pueblo Viejo,261,One of my fave spots for breakfast tacos  The tacos from this food truck are super authentic and delicious. Feel free to order off of their menu or build your own taco. 2 tacos will definitely fill you up  as the tortillas are packed full  that doesn t always happen with breakfast tacos   Try all their salsas while you are there  I love them all 
Pueblo Viejo,262,Came here when I had some time to blow before doors opened at The North Door  and was super glad I did. I wound up with the quesadilla plate with chicken  which was absolutely delicious. Wish I could have finished the whole thing  there was more food than there appeared to be. Staff was lovely and I ll definitely be back.
Pueblo Viejo,263,One of the best taco spots in Austin  and very under the radar. SO GOOD
Pueblo Viejo,264,Pueblo Viejo means  Veal House  in Spanish.  I stepped inside with my belly rumbling in anticipation of eating veal.  It s one of my favorite meats.  No veal in the Veal House   False advertising.    I had to eat a guacamole burrito with pineapple rind instead.   It was fine.
Pueblo Viejo,265,First time visiting Texas  didn t know what to eat but so glad I chose this place   Service is fast and food was delicious    
Pueblo Viejo,266,Barely 3 stars.   Excellent guacamole and chips  OK tacos.  Not a fan of the wet thick sauce they grill the carnitas with.
Pueblo Viejo,267,We seriously couldn t believe that such a delicious breakfast can cost so little... The variety of tacos  the quality of ingredients and the flavors are out of this world. It s all made to order and cooked from scratch     The service is quick and super friendly ... ABSOLUTE MUST if you are visiting Austin - the whole novelty of this  food truck in the yard  experience with random patio furniture and  BYOB       Well done 
Pueblo Viejo,268,Did not disappoint. I searched far and wide for this  taco truck  and the construction workers there said they don t serve between 10-1pm. It was noon and I was hungry on my lunch break. Yet to my surprise they actually upgraded their business to now be inside a building just around the corner  I decided on a taco plate-chicken and steak  comes with beans  guac  chips and salsa for  10.50. They took my order  handed me a number and I waited around 10 minutes for my food to be brought to me at the table. My only complaint here  Drink isn t included for what seemed to be a meal  the cans of soda are  1.75 and they only have Diet Coke or Dr.Pepper. Tasted great and I could not have ate it any faster lol   Glad I got to experience Tex Mex today for my first time in Texas  Now that I know where it is and what to expect I would go back 
Pueblo Viejo,269,Love the quaint and quirky atmosphere   The food is delicious  Between us we had 2 taco plates - a total of 4 different tacos - steak  chicken  fish  and pork. Pork was our hands down favorite  The guac was tasty and the decried beans were great for dipping chips into. Sodas in glass bottles were a great addition.   The seating is super unique and makes this a fun place to take kids 
Pueblo Viejo,270,Steak taco so good Chicharron taco so weird Hours are bizarre
Pueblo Viejo,271,I got a taco plate from here on a whim while visiting Austin and I m so glad I did. I would have missed out on this delicious food if I had just walked by. They cook everything fresh so it takes a little while but it was so worth it. I ordered a plate with two al pastor tacos. Everything from the salsa to the beans was perfect. The plate comes with a lot of food for a decent price as well. I really hope I get to visit again next time I come back.
Pueblo Viejo,272,This place hits the spot. Try the migas and the chicken... actually  try everything.   No bathrooms here-- well  there is a port-a-potty but it s not so glamorous  so make sure you re here just to eat the food  not to let it out. But I assure you  this is some tasty stuff  your tummy will be happy  not upset.   Okay  I m going to stop being gross now. But I thought it necessary to describe the location-- no bathrooms because it s outdoors  food truck style. It s like  you re sitting at the picnic table  eating your taco  looking around the east side  and you re like   man  I love Austin. And tacos. And indoor plumbing-- but these tacos are so good I ve momentarily forgotten how much I love indoor plumbing.   bottom line  go here  fall in love with their tacos and Austin and forget about indoor plumbing.
Pueblo Viejo,273,Their Guaco Tacos were so good   So good in fact we ate here two days in a row. They were not stingy with the meat but I will say if you get guacamole and chips they scoop the guacamole on a huge pile of lettuce. Also  there is a very convenient parking garage pretty much across the street which is a huge bonus if you ve ever tried finding parking in Austin. We parked there Friday and Saturday night for free  not sure if it s free all the time.
Pueblo Viejo,274,While downtown  I searched nearest Mexican food and a bunch of places popped up but this one caught my eye. The pictures on yelp looked so appetizing so we decided to try it out. I ordered two chicken tacos. They had grilled onions and chiles poblanos mixed in. I topped them off with some green salsa they had. I have never tried tacos like that. I m used to them being topped off with raw onion and cilantro. But it looks like that s the way I will be making tacos at home from now on    It was so spicy but just perfect. They were pretty pricey but the tacos were a decent size with a good amount of meat on them. To drink  I usually always opt for a glass bottle coke but I didn t see any so I went ahead and ordered an horchata. I m very picky when it comes to horchata that s why I don t like to order it because it can be a hit or miss. No lie  this was the best horchata I have ever tried in my entire life  I m not sure what it was but it taste super creamy    and it is very sweet  just to my liking. They topped it off with a bunch of cinnamon  so good 
Pueblo Viejo,275,I m from San Diego  so I think I know tacos. But when visiting Austin  they take tacos to another level. Pueblo Viejo was one of the many tacos I had on my week in town. On this Saturday morning  I woke up from a blissful slumber at the Hilton Garden Inn on the other side of the freeway after Day 1 of the Austin City Limits. From the hotel lobby  I was able to order food on the Yelp app and start walking over there to pickup. I grabbed a RideAustin car to the festival and called her to ask what kind of taco she wanted. I bought her an al pastor taco  but sadly I can t review it since she didn t have it until after she dropped me off. I had two Taco Don Chago s  which were big breakfast burritos for only  2.75. They were so good  I wanted to go back later to try more from their menu. Sadly  I never made it  so that will have to wait for my next visit. If the dinner tacos are as good as the breakfast tacos  we have a winner 
Pueblo Viejo,276,VERY slow service...no migas...no chilliquilles on the breakfast menu. I had the Tico Taco  beans  potatoes  amp  avocado . I had them add egg. Freshness quality of egg was questionable  had an off taste   but maybe it s because they use the same side of the grill where they cook their meats and they use the same spatulas that they use for their meats to cook vegetarian items. Prob just had the taste of meat grease in my taco. Whatever the case  it wasn t enjoyable. Lacked flavor. Only plus is they use Milagro tortillas and give you good portions.  I waited 15 mins for my taco and there wasn t even many customers there. The staff was in no hurry whatsoever...they almost took pleasure in taking their time.  Oh  and they were cooking a big pile of some ground meat on one side of the grill. The lady dumped it onto the grill and started spreading it out with her bare hands. Is it just me  or does this seem unsanitary  I would have thought she would ve used gloves or a clean spatula when cooking raw meat.  All in all  this wasn t a good experience  so needless to say  I don t recommend this place.
Pueblo Viejo,277,Tried this place based on the reviews and it was gross.  We ordered 6 different tacos and they were all greasy and nasty.  the fish was disgusting and the steak wasn t good either.  The only one that was semi good was the bacon egg and avocado breakfast taco. The chips and salsa were also disappointing  I think the chips were from the grocery store and they have maybe 4 dirty picnic tables outside to sit at.  I m not sure where these food reviews are coming from.  Maybe drunks on 6th street at 2am but trust me  do not waste your time.  There is much better Tacos in Austin
Pueblo Viejo,278,Authentic tacos  So good and decent prices. The tortillas de maiz are hand-made. The tacos are pretty big. Its located inside the NorthDoor.
Pueblo Viejo,279,Tried them for breakfast between clients. Order took longer than I expected  but the food was really good.   I m going back and know now not to rush it.
Pueblo Viejo,280,I tried this trailer kind of by accident. I was really looking to eat at a couple of BBQ trailers  but they both ran out of meat    After looking at a couple of yelp reviews I decided to try Pueblo Viejo and boy was i glad that I did  I walked up and ordered a Pueblo Viejo Style Taco and also a Fish taco. Let me tell you...the Pueblo Viejo taco was out of this world and you have to try it if you get a taco from here    The fish taco was good  but not near as good as the Pueblo Viejo. My wife also got the steak and chicharron tacos. They were also pretty good.   The tacos are very authentic and you must try them  I would definitely come back to this trailer  get me a couple of tacos  and wash it down with a Topo Chico.
Pueblo Viejo,281,The food took forever and they even give us each taco in different time. Had to eat one  and then wait for another one for few minutes and so one. Granted they are very much outdoor free spirit ambiance going on  the spot that they serve food is pretty dirty. Food was also not that impressive - all meat seem very dry and even though they do have some seasonings  taste was very bland.  My husband gave up on eating his gordita since they served in a burning hot bread from hell.   Plus  we met a homeless dude who was asking some spare change. We told him we don t have cash but we d offer him some food  then he was starting to pound the table and renting out at us saying -  Fine  I ll just seat here all day and rob a liquor store or something because you don t care  White people don t care  black people son t care  and mexican people took my job  F ck you  Go f cking kill yourself       I am not lying at all. It wasn t the taco shop s fault  but at least they need to watch some security issue.
Pueblo Viejo,282,Good street tacos  the al pastor was muy bueno   The barbacoa was not     Didn t even finish it  bummer.  Kinda spoiled the experience  would definitely give them another shot though.
Pueblo Viejo,283,I fell in love with a breakfast taco at this food truck. My  taco had avocado  beans  bacon and cheese. I live in Minneapolis and can t wait to return to Austin to visit this food truck again. I tried to duplicate the taco in my own kitchen but fell short.
Pueblo Viejo,284,Love at first bite  Pueblo Viejo was absolutely amazing. Huge portions for the price  red salsa to die for. Friendly team running the trailer.   My husband and I went on a Saturday mid-morning. He ordered the gordita plate with one pastor and one rajas. I ordered the chicken taco plate on corn tortillas.  We received chips and salsa- you could taste and see the freshness. Bright green cilantro  the perfect amount of salt and spice. Pure heaven.   Our order came out rather quickly and my husband traded one of my tacos for his rajas gordita. I won the food lottery with that trade  Amaze-balls  Gooey cheese  huge amount of perfectly grilled peppers and the magic slight crunch of the bread. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My chicken taco was just as great. Again  generous portions of wonderfully flavored goodness. Although I didn t taste his pastor gordita  I was amazed at the visible chunks of pineapple   This place is legit. Go there now 
Pueblo Viejo,285,Awesome tacos  My favorite place for tacos so far  and I ve tried the Don Chago  Taco Nes  favorite  order this    and Guaca taco. Their ingredients are really fresh and flavorful  especially the steak    GET THE STEAK TACO.   Seating-wise  there s about 5-6 littles tables next to the food truck. And then afterwards  if you just walk over a couple blocks  you can have a cute gelato dessert at Gemmeli s or a viet coffee at the Bee Grocery   D
Pueblo Viejo,286,The tacos are legit and the green sauce set my face on fire  which is a must if you re going to be a favorite taco place of mine .  The only surprise was when I ordered some of the green sauce to go  rather than just fill up a ton of little containers for my tacos.   10 for the 16 ounce is a little pricey for just the sauce.
Pueblo Viejo,287,This little spot down a secluded road is some of the freshest and tastiest Mexican around. I had the taco plate with al pastor   steak tacos with beans and guac  plus chips and salsa. Excellent. Their array of homemade salsas are fantastic. The habanero will clear your sinuses. This will be a must visit every trip to Austin.
Pueblo Viejo,288,This place is so good   I was in the mood for some tacos and this hit the spot.  The seasoning is perfect  not too salty  not too bland.  Totally coming back. Check out this spot 
Pueblo Viejo,289,Wanting to bring some breakfast tacos to a business meeting  our hotel concierge recommended this place highly.  Located in a semi permanent trailer on the other side of the freeway  the very kind ladies set me up with 15 assorted tacos in less than 10 mins.  Were they good    Let s just say that even my Austin clients were duly impressed. To quote one   Dude  These are some KickAss tacos      Need I say more 
Pueblo Viejo,290,Quick  easy  and pretty cheap. For what it is  I give it five stars. Morning breakfast tacos of various types can make for a happy tummy as you start your day. They re pretty filling and I ended up getting a mix of breakfast and lunch tacos...I liked that I could mix and match even early in the morning 
Pueblo Viejo,291,I m hesitant to review this place  mainly because I m selfish.  This taco truck is an absolute gem.  Great food  amazing portions  and friendly service.   As opposed to many of the super popular trucks around the east side  this one is typically very quick service  and gets the orders right.  5 starts
Pueblo Viejo,292,Tacos to die for   This taco truck is off the beaten path a few blocks from the downtown area. The tacos are delicious and completely inexpensive for the portions quality you are getting. They offer breakfast tacos as well as really good speciality tacos options. I got the specially fish as well as the roasted pork tacos and they were amazing  I would recommend the taco plater for  8 - it s well worth it for two tacos  beans and guac on the side  If you do the specialty tacos it s only  1 more which is a total bargain. The service was really quick and the food absolutely delicious 
Pueblo Viejo,293,Good price for a breakfast taco.  Bad breakfast taco - TICO. The tortilla  yelp  is not built for the runniness of the beans  basically steamed red potatoes cut in quarters stuffed into my poor taco  support   and firm   unripe avocado slices. Selecting  sucks  avocado is a tall order  and super water-privileged  stay woke   but when it s one of three ingredients  I need it right.  Weird breakfast taco - BUENO. Nuclear-pink chorizo with egg atop a little goop of cheese. Was tasty.
Pueblo Viejo,294,Big tacos for a decent price  Not healthy by any means  but if you re looking for an authentic taco   this is your spot. Watch out for the mosquitoes though  they didn t  have any spray available and I was bit multiple times  The guy who cooked our meal says they get busy around late evening time and late night.
Pueblo Viejo,295,Incredible  Taco nes is my favorite but everything here was awesome. Full of flavor  they give you a large amount of meat. Can t get better for a taco truck. Guacamole is awesome too  Get the order of guac if you have 4 people  definitely worth it 
Pueblo Viejo,296,Found this place on yelp  the gordita and tacos were well executed  good season and balance. We are from Florida decided to give it a try and was well worth it.
Pueblo Viejo,297,Very small and the only seating was outside  but it was so worth it  I got the Taco Nes. It s a combination of steak  and chorizo with grilled onions and fresh cilantro. You have your choice between flour or corn tortilla. I chose one of each. I enjoyed the flour tortilla more. Very large portion and great flavor. I had hoped for a little more grilled onions but still very very good. Will definitely come back when I m in Austin again.
Pueblo Viejo,298,Literally the best tacos in all of Austin. Best salsa too. Migas  Don Chago  Guaca Taco  PUEBLO VIEJO style  Tico Taco
Pueblo Viejo,299,Best breakfast tacos. Period. Super fast service  amazing quality. I grab tacos at least a few times a week from here.
Pueblo Viejo,300,Super disappointed. We are from California and we are used to really good Mexican food. We were told that Texas has even better Mexican food. This place was rated 4 1 2 stars which makes me think that is not the case because the food was terrible. Super salty  flour tortilla soft tacos that couldn t be more tex mex. Chili s probably has better tacos.  Anyway  I m sure the people really nice etc. but we re definitely not eat there again  and oh yeah  I forgot to tell you that the fish tacos were so fishy that we tossed them.
Pueblo Viejo,301,We visited this spot on our last day in Austin  and it was the perfect cap to our weekend. We were staying in the 6th street area  so had to walk through a somewhat sketchy area under the freeway overpass.  We were also a little confused because we were looking forward food truck  because I had read it was a food truck.  Apparently it was at some point but no longer is.   The place was jumping because they were showing the World Cup final on the big screen. We came for breakfast so I ordered the chiliquiles and my husband ordered two steak and onion tacos and a potato taco. Everything was EXCELLENT    The portions were just the right amount and the flavors were  on point. I would definitely come back.
Pueblo Viejo,302,I m a vegetarian so most of the time I just get egg and potato tacos but there is something about them that makes them so good  better than your average egg and potato taco   The guacamole and beans are also really good  My boyfriend usually gets different tacos like the Taco Al Pastor and from what I can tell they look so good and authentic. They have some really great salsas that range from mild to really spicy- and yes they re actually spicy. The staff is very friendly and always strives to make the customer satisfied. This food truck has become a favorite for me 
Pueblo Viejo,303,Been here many times over the years and I have yet to be disappointed.  More fresh flavor than you can shake a stick at all at a awesome price.  Great for a late night pick me up after the bars  or even for lunch. If the weather s nice  you can t get much better.
Pueblo Viejo,304,This is my GOTO taco food truck.  Every time is a perfect lunch.  Used to eat here almost everyday until my office moved. Now I visit as often as I can.
Pueblo Viejo,305,Good Tacos  But I wish it the tacos came with Pico De Gallo to bring it more flavor... service was very fast and friendly. It s located in a food park and super easy to find  Two tacos were enough to fill me up for the night  trust me these tacos are a handful and DELICIOUS 
Pueblo Viejo,306,So fucking good. Great flavor with the right ratios. Soft tortilla. Could use a better view but that s nitpicking at that point
Pueblo Viejo,307,In my opinion  one of the best taco places in Austin  highly recommend  Can not wait to come back.
Pueblo Viejo,308,Ordered a few tacos for a quick lunch. Best tacos ever    Both the fish and pastor were perfect. They also have amazing salsa. I don t know that I ll ever be back in Austin  but If I am this is one of my first stops   
Pueblo Viejo,309,Seriously awesome taco truck. This guys chicharron tacos are AMAZING - I ve never had anything like them. The breakfast tacos are really really good as well and filling  The staff is friendly and speaks Spanish so you know it s some authentic stuff. Come get some food and try it for yourself. Support this guy he puts his heart into his food and it shows.
Pueblo Viejo,310,Food here is great   You walk into a small hole in the wall and then sit in an emptied out night club... highly recommend and would come back 
Pueblo Viejo,311,Visiting Austin and had to get my breakfast taco fix while here. Found this little food truck thanks to Yelp and it s perfect    Delicious tacos and love the casual patio atmosphere.
Pueblo Viejo,312,Park on the street  go into the yard with painted park benches under the trees wrapped in lights and you ll see the magical school bus of tacos.    Food trucks come in all shapes and sizes.  For Pueblo Viejo  it comes in the form of a short school bus converted to food truck.  A box of eggs is piloting this bus to flavortown... at least  that s what s sitting in the driver s seat.    In the few days that I spent in Austin  I managed to hit this place twice.  Once for lunch and once for breakfast.   Both times had great experiences.  The breakfast tacos are fairly varied  but if you aren t sold on one signature taco  they ll make a custom one.  I would recommend the Taco Don Chago...   They do take call-ahead orders  but while there is usually a crowd from what I ve seen  they hardly have a line.  They take orders and your name and get it out to you as soon as possible.   A solid go-to if you re looking for a good breakfast or lunch on the quick.
Pueblo Viejo,313,Yummy  Nice shaded eating area  and had a wonderful morning breeze. Tacos and service were outstanding. Took credit cards as well
Pueblo Viejo,314,The tacos al pastor here are DELICIOUS. There s a little outdoor seating area with a few tables.
Pueblo Viejo,315,Yummy tacos people.  However  there is a breakdown of communication ordering online.  Glad I had a COA parking tag or I would have had to pay for parking.
Pueblo Viejo,316,After reading all the positive reviews about Pueblo Viejo  I was really hopeful. Alas  my experience was just kinda  meh .   I showed up around 9 30am on a Saturday and they were already out of ham  so the Azteca was off the menu. I went with 2 tacos Viejo  and while the chorizo was good and the tacos were huge  I was far from blown away.   Also got a side of chips and salsa and was sad when I got a bag of thin  store-bought tortilla chips. The salsa was good  the best part of the experience  in fact.
Pueblo Viejo,317,The best tacos downtown by far   I love their barbacoa and you can t go wrong with fajitas.  The cook is always smiling
Pueblo Viejo,318,Best chicharron taco I ve had  hands down. Breakfast tacos can be hit or miss. Just stick with the don chago like everyone else says to and maybe add an egg if that s your thing.   In a town where good food is hard to come by at a reasonable price  this place is a real gem.  Salsas include a sweet red  sour green  and fiery orange. Choose wisely.
Pueblo Viejo,319,Breakfast tacos were good at this takeout hole In the wall  but parking is next to impossible and there is a large homeless encampment a block away. We stopped for a quick bite on the way to the airport and got gas at the Chevron around the corner where we were accosted by several very aggressive homeless men. Sad what has happened to downtown Austin. Construction everywhere  horrible traffic  and a huge homeless population.
Pueblo Viejo,320,Maybe I just caught them on a bad day because everyone else on here seems to love this place  but the tacos I got from here were inedible.   The mushroom meat mixture in the special taco tasted really foul and the barbacoa was old and dry. I ate three total bites of the tacos and threw away.
Pueblo Viejo,321,With a husband like mine  a meal is not a meal unless you sample as many different menu items as possible. Our order consisted of a chicken taco  a steak  quesadilla taco   and the taco plate--pastor and chicharr n--which comes with beans  guacamole  chips  and salsa. The fact that I couldn t decide which of the four tacos was my favorite was particularly telling  considering how picky this little Mexican girl can be with her food. The chicharr n was probably the best chicharr n taco I ve ever had. They were somehow able to keep the texture crispy while most I ve had have been soggy and limp. In keeping with Yelp standards  this isn t a 5-star review simply because it s not  as good as it gets   but I d give it a 4.5 if I could.   On this definitively freezing evening in Austin  we were happy to be able to call in our order  in Spanish  of course  and have it ready to go on arrival. Another plus  they take credit cards.  Any food truck that doesn t should seriously consider joining us in the 21st century .
Pueblo Viejo,322,Excellent tacos. Fyi its a food truck  but benches available to sit on.  Go for the  - chicken and steak tacos - quick service
Pueblo Viejo,323,Found this place by accident  but what a find  Excellent- I don t like breakfast tacos in general but I m glad I had them here. Got the taco don chago with egg and a horchata. Delicious  Flour tortilla was fresh.
Pueblo Viejo,324,Very delicious I got Pastor Tacos and they were a good size street tacos  I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for Mexican Authentic Food 
Pueblo Viejo,325,Chorizo breakfast taco was great  on a handmade flour tortilla. Chicken enchiladas also were tasty. If you re looking for good breakfast tacos in Austin  you can t go wrong here.
Pueblo Viejo,326,Found a little treasure close to our hotel. It s hidden away in a corner. The tacos were very good my husband and really enjoyed the tacos. The cook is cooking in front as you are placing your order. We will definitely go back. The prices are good  the ambiance is different  not your typical restaurant setting.
Pueblo Viejo,327,Moving to Austin you think the trailer talk is street propaganda and you go to whatever restaurant makes the papers and eventually it all seems a little boring.  A late weekday after reading Craigslist you ll meet someone for tickets to a sold out show  she leaves heading east and why not try the metal taco trailer  block parked in the back of an overgrown lot between a pork-mad punk and a British double-decker.  There s not a visceral way to describe the experience - you walk up and order and it s immediately on the flat searing griddle as you sit down in the 104  day and think about what brought you to Austin to begin with.  You pick up your order  avocado and something on grilled tortilla and it s the best taco you never knew you needed.  Sitting on rickety plastic chairs under the colorful canopy it s clear there s nothing between you and the taco empire inside the trailer and really it s exactly why you ve come - you order and turn around and there s little else to it  an epiphany without fanfare or an Austin Chronicle rating.  Enjoy the Mexican Coke  the taco  what s left of your long afternoon. Until now you were in Austin for complicated reasons.  But really you ve known why you re here all along.
Pueblo Viejo,328,Great service  but the food was just mediocre at best.  We tried many different tacos as we were a family of 10. The worst were the breakfast tacos.  The organic coffee was really watered down  but I guess what do I expect since I ordered it from a taco truck     I personally ordered the fish tacos.  It was very dry.     The price of the tacos was very overpriced for a cart in comparison to San Francisco where we are from.  Definitely more than it should be.  The eating area was fun.  Thankfully it wasn t raining.  We even saw someone get dropped off with their luggage via taxi straight from the airport  I guess people like it.   The hot sauce salsa is very deliciously hot.  We could barely eat it.  Nachos were goof too.
Pueblo Viejo,329,I was turned onto this taco truck by the good folks over at Wright Bros. Brew  amp  Brew. Needless to say  I loved my breakfast tacos. Fresh and delicious  all served with friendly cheer.    A great option after guzzling some aeropress coffee East of 35.
Pueblo Viejo,330,My first experience with the famous breakfast tacos in Austin. Went there around 9 30 AM on the first day of SXSW. There wasn t much of a line but they had many togo orders and my order of two tacos took almost 20 mins to be prepared. It was worth the wait though. I ordered the Migas tacos and absolutely loved them. Will definitely be back here again 
Pueblo Viejo,331,The guy working there stole the show  and our hearts  by giving us plastic cups and granting us access to the majestic keg of DosEquis and whispering  free refills.   SLAYIN THE GAME  You rule  dude.
Pueblo Viejo,332,The tacos here are amazing  In my search for the best taco joint in Austin I came here based on Yelp reviews. The tacos were a very good size and packed full of well-marinated meat and toppings.  I went to Torchy s Tacos the next day  also very good  and I d say I like Pueblo s slightly better.  Pueblo Viejo Style Taco - this was my favorite hands down. The steak was awesome and I was impressed by the amount of sliced avocado that came with it. Perfect proportion of melted cheese. Loved the mushrooms... I rarely see steak tacos that come with mushrooms... Which I don t understand because they go so well together.   Taco Nes - steak and chorizo... noms. There s a whole lotta meat in this one  Next time I would ask for more cilantro... while the meats were excellent some more fresh toppings would have helped to balance it more.   Chicharron - only order this if you like chicharrons  Otherwise you will probably be weirded out. It s pretty much fried pork rinds. These were very crispy and yummy. I do think something like this would be better served on a bed of greens instead of in a taco to help contrast with the friedness.  Don t out any extra salsa on this taco otherwise it will make the chicharrons soggy.
Pueblo Viejo,333,killer breakfast tacos. mushroom and spinach on point  migas too  and excellent fresh salsas including a smoky black one. seating inside a big open music venue attached.
Pueblo Viejo,334,Delish and quick   Great service  The staff is friendly and engaged  This spot is a winner anytime of day 
Pueblo Viejo,335,These tacos are amazing. Like stop reading this post and just go get a taco then come back to your computer and read the rest of the post.  How good is the taco  Told you so.  Overall I can t add much to what others have said. In a sitting dripping with good tacos just add it to the list under  great   awesome   must-try 
Pueblo Viejo,336,They have the best tacos in Austin  TX. Initially a trailer started by a brother-and-sister team  the have won me over with their amazing food. You have to try the Guaca Taco w  Steak  skip the spinach  on flour and the al pastor on corn.
Pueblo Viejo,337,Excellent tacos   Spicy lean beef and chicken. Refried beans were a hit with my sons. The quesadilla was out of control. Super cheesy with excellent cuts of chicken. The only draw back for me was parking.
Pueblo Viejo,338,So for starters I ll say I have tried a very limited amount of items on the menu  mostly the breakfast tacos actually. But the service is always friendly  the tacos are always fresh and super tasty. The coffee is fresh and hot. There is construction going on in the area right now so it s a little distracting. But over all I love this place can t wait to try more of the menu. Plus you get a pretty good view of downtown.
Pueblo Viejo,339,Good news  people  Jesus is back. And he runs a taco truck in Austin.  If you re a fan of tacos - or just things that taste good in your mouth - Pueblo Viejo is nothing short of a religious experience. This was my second visit  mostly to confirm I didn t hallucinate the first one.  Taco junkies generally agree that Al Pastor is like the cheese pizza or bolognese of Mexican food - the universal standard by which a taco joint can be judged. And Pueblo Viejo s isn t just up to snuff... it IS the goddamn snuff. Sweet and spicy  roasted to perfection  and stuffed to the gills. Praise Quetzalcoatl   The Taco Nes was somehow even better - a brilliant mix of carne asada  chorizo  grilled onions and some kind of special lime sauce that had my tongue speaking in tongues.  If you happen to find yourself in Austin for a few days  Torchy s and Tacodeli are well worth the hype. But as far as I m concerned  Pueblo Viejo is the Mexican Mecca.   ndale 
Pueblo Viejo,340,Ordered 3 tacos all on corn tortillas  Al Pastor  Chicken  Taco Nes  steak chorizo  all were fantastic. Good size for the price as well  they don t skimp on the fillings.
Pueblo Viejo,341,I work on the east side so this is my go-to spot for breakfast tacos. They are always friendly and quick. The salsas are damn good  especially the creamy green sauce  there s a green tomatillo that is mild and also delicious . The orange habanero salsa is spicy af but tasty if you can handle it. I m from South Texas and the way they prepare their chorizo reminds me of home. I ve also gone here for lunch and their non-egg choices are also really good. AND they have gorditas  Couldn t recommend more.
Pueblo Viejo,342,Hungover  Come here for some soul-warming  breakfast tacos. Which one to order you ask  Order two Don Chagos with eggs  bacon  refried beans  cheese  avocado  on flour and use the homemade orange sauce generously.  Speaking of that orange sauce  that stuff is like crack. I came one day and asked where it was and the lovely woman working there said it was stolen the night before. I can t say I wouldn t do the same as this bandit.  If you come for lunch or dinner I m a huge fan of the Pueblo Viejo taco with steak  mushrooms  avocado and cheese  it s freakin  huge by the way  and the the Al Pastor. Even for the most ravenous  two tacos should work but if you re really feeling frisky you can go for three. You won t want to eat the rest of the day I assure you.   I really really love this place. Make sure you grab a Topo Chico to sip alongside.
Pueblo Viejo,343,Tacos are ok...can t really complain  but not amazing. False advertising though - business owner listed that they validate parking  which is not the case. I was even asked to shop for more than  12  only to realize  some information is missing on my ticket  according to the lady behind the counter...so needless to say I paid the parking as well as ordered more than I wanted to. Not cool 
Pueblo Viejo,344,The tacos were amazing and they have 4 different kinds of salsas how can you go wrong with that   We tried 8 different types of tacos between 4 people and loved them all. The steak and chorizo along with sausage  egg and cheese were our most favorite. The line was long but they have a nice shaded area where you can wait and parking is available in the adjacent lot.
Pueblo Viejo,345,The best breakfast tacos EVER. Initially  I didn t have too high of expectations for this place. There wasn t ample seating  and it didn t seem like a lot of people were frequenting this place. But oh my  was my mind blown. The tacos were so delicious  We got two  one being the Don Chago  I forget the name of the other one but it had chorizo  cheese  and eggs in it . The tacos came out piping hot  and portion sizes were great as well. There was also a good portion of avocado on top  which was great. For the cherry on top  the server gave me a bottle of water for free just because. We were very impressed with this place  and I can see it surpassing some of the other  more well known taco places in Austin. I can t wait to go back the next time I visit.
Pueblo Viejo,346,OMG YES. The food was fantastic  staff was so helpful  atmosphere is phenomenal. Lots of fun dogs around  cool water features and plants  and friendly folks too. I definitely recommend this place  you can t go wrong. Be sure to get a drink next door at Cosmic. I got a vodka lemonade.   hella good.
Pueblo Viejo,347,Came here for some light night tacos  and was slightly underwhelmed  given the high Yelp ratings. I had a taco al pastor and a chicken taco  both on corn tortillas. The pastor was the better of the two -- a bit sweet  a bit spicy  tender meat  chunks of pineapple  topped with cilantro and onion. Four stars for that.  The chicken  however  was dry and chewy. It seemed to be overcooked breast meat. The chewiness was compounded by the tortillas  which seemed tougher than most. This was useful  in that it kept the taco from collapsing under the generous pile of meat  but it also made for a good jaw workout. It was as if they started out trying to toast the tortillas  lost interest part way through  and ended up just partially dehydrating them instead.  Overall  a serviceable late night taco place  but far from the best tacos I had in my Austin trip. Not even the best tacos I had today  that would be Torchy s . Maybe the breakfast tacos are better. Or maybe I caught them on an off night. Or maybe the all these five star reviews were written with beer-taco-goggles. Whatever the reason  I can t really justify more than three stars for that chicken taco.  Seating  a couple of large wooden benches and metal tables  shared with a couple of other food trucks trailers. Pricing   3- 4 per item  figure two or three items for a full meal.
Pueblo Viejo,348,My new favorite place to get breakfast tacos  Usually quick service  except one time when there was an order of 30 tacos to go before me  but still was not more than a 15 min wait. You can call your order in ahead of time if you want even faster service. Friendly staff and a few tables chairs outside to sit and eat. Amazing green salsa  I ve tried several breakfast tacos  amp  they are all delicious  The chorizo can get a bit greasy  but still tasty. Also  they pack them full of egg  I was surprised by how big the taco was and regretted getting two.  Perfect for second breakfast     I didn t have any of their beverages coffee so I m not sure the quality there.   Also  it is located on the East side of town  so you are kind of in a sketchy neighborhood  just be aware of your surroundings and you ll be fine  Enjoy 
Pueblo Viejo,349,The place isn t where they say they are who knows where or what it is. Nice website but who knows
Pueblo Viejo,350,Best migas in Austin- they do it right and red salsa is excellant nice staff fast service
Pueblo Viejo,351,Super convenient location  right in North Door. Probably about ten tacos on menu and I ve tried at least six. Seriously  you can t go wrong with this place. All are fantastic from meat   taco assembly to the bomb sauce. Choices are super succulent green salsa or destroy you spicy orange. Both are great 
Pueblo Viejo,352,Great prices  atmosphere  and even better food  Fish tacos were the bomb. Flavorful and appropriately messy. Guacamole with perfect amount of cilantro and their pork and pueblo viejo tacos were tasty and moist.
Pueblo Viejo,353,This is one of those perfect little hole in the walls that you hope to find. A small ordering area  shared outside tables with flower boxes and umbrellas for great conversations and AMAZING food. The quality and quantity of food is incredible  and the prices  unbelievable LOW. If you re looking for that great  casual hole in the wall place  this is it 
Pueblo Viejo,354,This food truck is a walkable distance from the bars on 6th street - perfect for a bite before or after some drinks  I m super used to the  1-2 tacos and so paying  3 for a taco was a new one for me. We ordered the chicken and the steak on corn tortillas. The sheer amount of meat they give you for each taco is really generous. The chicken and steak were saut ed with peppers and onions and were seasoned well. The salsas are available at the register area and are needed - the meat was good on its own but it needed another component like the acidity of tomatoes of much needed pico de gallo....  On the plus side  I think they ve started to take credit cards.
Pueblo Viejo,355,Amazing amazing food. Such a great value for the price    8.99 for a taco plate includes 2 big a   tacos  side of beans  guac and chips. Meat and chicken tacos were very tasty. Excellent service. Definitely will recommend and come back.
Pueblo Viejo,356,For my 400th review  I m proud to write on behalf of what could be the finest taco I ve ever eaten. We happened to stop by here after the line for the barbecue truck down the street was too long and it appeared that most of their food was sold out. This turn of events proved to be quite serendipitous  as it allowed us to try what  for me  has become the gold standard of tacos.   PV is located in a small trailer in a small lot in East Austin  just a short walk from the downtown. There are a few tables set up in the lot to eat after you get your food. It appears to be family run  and the people who work there are very nice.   I got two tacos  which was plenty of food   the taco al pastor and the Pueblo Viejo taco. The taco al pastor was very good  a pork taco bordering on the sweet side due to the pineapple in the mix. BUT...but--the star of the show was the Pueblo Viejo taco  perhaps the best taco I ve ever eaten. It contained steak  onions  and portobello mushroom in a spicy sauce  I asked for it spicy   topped with fresh avocado. The lady at the counter recommended a flour tortilla for this taco  and a corn for the al pastor   and I m so glad I took her advice.   Again  get the Pueblo Viejo taco. Seriously.   See previous line           
Pueblo Viejo,357,Pueblo Viejo style is the BEST taco I ve ever tasted. I think I can only top this one if I go to Mexico one day for the real deal  it s on my bucketlist . It is extremely meaty  filled nearly to the brim  Hella messy  too. Everything falls apart lol. I thought I was an inadequate taco consumer  but my friend ordered one too and he was struggling the exact same way  so I felt reassurance for my taco eating skills. A plastic spoon should solve the problem so that you don t resemble a barbarian  unless that s the look you re going for  you sexy beast    The meat is moist and perfect and it s additionally stuffed with tomatoes  shreds of lettuce  and grilled onions. Their avocado slices are generously lengthy and really refreshing with its smooth  buttery texture  I don t even like avocados  but it was a must-have in this option. The corn tortilla on this one is nice and soft  like your smile when you eat this.  Al pastor was pretty good  but I would opt for something else next time. The taco was crispy on the outside. On particular edges of the corn tortilla  it was a bit overdone. Meat had medium moisture-- bit dry  bit moist. I should ve eaten this one first so I could end with a bang with my Pueblo Viejo style. S all good... in the neighborhood.  One taco size is equivalent to 2 small tacos at a normal   1.75 taco place  which reflects its doubled price. Two should be filling enough.  A tip that I would give is to bring your own drinks. It s a taco truck  so they charge  1 for a bottle of water. That s a dollar that could be spent at another food place lol. Just saying  heehee. Sitting on the benches waiting for your order  it ll smell very appetizing  but that scent is going to linger onto your clothes  so prepare to smell like your food afterwards. Totes recommend it here 
Pueblo Viejo,358,The tacos are delicious with good portions. The horchata tastes very fresh and delicious with powdered cinnamon on top  highly recommend. Overall a great taco spot. Only negative  bugs all over some of the picnic tables.
Pueblo Viejo,359,Tacos were phenomenal. Chicken  pork  steak  breakfast tacos. Each one was better than the next. Highly recommend  there was a constant line so be prepared to wait about 15-20 min. But definitely worth it.
Pueblo Viejo,360,GREAT tacos. I had the fish and the steak. They were so good. Definitely greasy but superb quality. They were so good I even tried to come back the next day to get more. Unfortunately   they were closed because it was memorial day. I will definitely be back next time I am in Austin.
Pueblo Viejo,361,Best breakfast tacos in Austin. Served all day. Don Chago and Taco Viejo are my favorites.
Pueblo Viejo,362,Great tacos for a very reasonable price 
Pueblo Viejo,363,Great staff  great tacos  great sauces. Honestly  this was our 2nd choice to eat  the food truck we chose was closed. This place did not disappoint. You don t want to miss this place. Fresh meats and all fresh ingredients.
Pueblo Viejo,364,I got al pastor tacos and horchata and it was amazing  Everything was delicious and they were friendly. Highly recommended
Pueblo Viejo,365,You ve found it...the secret taco valhala.   They overload their tacos with ingredients  always over delivering on their already cheap menu items. GuacoTaco and the Pueblo Viejo Taco are my favorites  with a mexican coke.   Everything else has failed in this trailer park  but PV stays strong...because they are amazing. Believe. Eat the taco dream of East Austin.
Pueblo Viejo,366,I signed up for Yelp to write this review. My girlfriend and I literally said  Mmmm  in between each bite. I ordered a fish taco  really good quality tilapia  and a Guaca Taco with chicken which is the best taco I have had in Austin so far. The chicken was marinated and seasoned perfectly and I foresee myself recommending this taco food truck to everyone I know.
Pueblo Viejo,367,Fish tacos  100 . All the way. They won in the battle of the tacos.  We had lunch at this little food truck court on Friday. I ordered one fish taco and one steak taco and I wish I had just done two fish. Not that the steak was particularly bad  but this mild white fish  probably tilapia or something  was perfectly cooked  well-seasoned... all good things. Their salsas are excellent  the chips are light and tasted fresh. They also have a whole menu of breakfast tacos  which I support. My friend is a pescatarian so she was fine with the seafood  but the vegetarian options were slim.  The tacos took a laughably long time  considering there were just two guys in front of us. By the guy working was super apologetic too  the guy actually gave us some water bottles and chips and salsa for free then apologized some more. I think those two guys must have ordered a bunch of takeaway or something. Anyway  it s just a one or two man operation  so patience is key.
Pueblo Viejo,368,This taco place has become one of my favorites in Austin and that s saying a lot in this city. They are located in the North Door venue but open even when events aren t happening and you can stop in if you aren t part of the event. Everything I have ordered on the menu has been delicious from the guaco taco to the Gordita. You can tell they use high quality ingredients and I love the corn tortillas. Chicken Caldo soup was just added to the menu and it looks so good  So glad this place opened up 
Pueblo Viejo,369,In a town filled with mexican food  this one actually stands out. The tacos are huge  I can barely finish two when I m hungry. The al pastor is definitely the best I ve had in Austin  it s racked up and stacked up. The steak and mushroom taco with guacamole is life changing too. I can now die a happy man.
Pueblo Viejo,370,Everything was so delicious and cheap. Had three breakfast tacos - Taco Magarita  Taco Mi Madre and Tico Taco - and would go back for these again and to try lunch tacos too.
Pueblo Viejo,371,Amazing. Love the vibe. Best tacos I ve had outside of Mexico. Grabbed some beers from across the street and enjoyed them in the garden.
Pueblo Viejo,372,Best tacos I ve ever had. Can t stop going here. It s been great watching this business grow
Pueblo Viejo,373,Best taco I ve ever had. I had a chicharrone taco and it was like eating the snack  but more moist  The taco itself was really filling too. I just wanted a snack and so one taco was fine. Would suggest 2-3 tacos if you are hungry 
Pueblo Viejo,374,Delicious tacos   It s so refreshing to see them cooking right in front of you  Great service   Will definitely be going again 
Pueblo Viejo,375,In all of our visit to Austin  we ate over a dozen tacos. This place was hands-down numero Uno. The breakfast tacos were tasty and the Al Pastor tacos were absolutely phenomenal. Don t be scared to grab the hot sauces as they are spicy yet tasty. Some may find the birds a bit overbearing  but the glass is half full... Feel free to toss a chip their way.
Pueblo Viejo,376,decided to stop by after being at zilker park for most of the day  parking can be a problem but eventually you may find one. We ordered two steak  two al pasto and two tacos nes so we can had 3 each. I liked the pastor tacos the best followed by the tacos nes which is steak with chorizo sausage  the steak taco was decent but not great. The pastor was tender with bits of grilled pineapple which gave it that sweet tang  very good taco. The tortillas taste pretty good  they use El milagro brand which are quite good for packaged tortillas. I will definitely be back and will try the fish taco next time  they also make a very good green salsa  they have a black salsa that is very spicy  think it has habanero. I will definitely be back again next time I am near the area  keep up the good work.
Pueblo Viejo,377,I ate there yesterday after I found out that two barbecue places were closed on Monday. I m visiting from the east coast and wanted authentic Texas food. I was not disappointed    Sure  it s in a parking lot  but it was exactly what I was looking for    fast  easy  casual and delicious 
Pueblo Viejo,378,This place is a gem      I found it using this app and OMG  The food is so full of flavor. I couldn t stop eating even when I was super full. Make me feel back home. Love it and definitely coming back when I m in Austin. My tacos were so good that I forgot to take pictures     Sorry   And they have like six types of salsa 
Pueblo Viejo,379,Perhaps I decided to try this place on a bad night.  My experience is so far off the norm here.    Last night we decided to grab a taco after a long night at work.  I ordered the Pueblo Viejo and my boyfriend ordered the specialty plate.  My taco should have been steak  avacado  mushrooms  cheese with lettuce and tomato.  They took about 15 minutes to come out but okay.  I took my first bite  all super excited to try this place he likes so much  and I wanted to vomit.  It smelt and tasted like my steak had been soaked in dirty fish water.  I am not a picky eater  I ve never walked away from a taco until last night.  Steak shouldn t be fishy.  The side of beans was good though.
Pueblo Viejo,380,If yo ure a cali transplant and miss AUTHENTIC Mexican food  not this tex mex crap   then this place is for you.  Having lived most of my life in California  I ve gotten used to the best Mexican food.. but coming here  it s been a pretty big disappointment.  I m a fan for life 
Pueblo Viejo,381,Some of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had. And I ve eaten over 1 400 different breakfast tacos. Fact. They make everything fresh  from scratch  in the van   winnebago. If you can only go to one taco place during your visit to Austin. Go here. And enjoy the love. Enjoy the flavor. Enjoy the hot sauce.
Pueblo Viejo,382,This place is the bomb. The family that runs it are very welcoming and enjoyable to chat with. Top 3 breakfast taco spot in town  If you want to really like this place  opt out of the salads and go all out on a massive taco. Because hey  what is healthy eating anyway 
Pueblo Viejo,383,BEST TACOS IN THE WORLD    omg the habanero salsas are to die for  I highly recommend this wonderful food truck to everyone.
Pueblo Viejo,384,I don t hand out 5 stars often. Review based on breakfast tacos - best in Austin  hands down. Get the Don Chego. Perfectly cooked flour tortilla with beans  bacon  cheese and avocado -  2.50 - wow   It s only taken a year to find something decent in this town. Their dinner options are pretty good as well. Order pickup through Yelp to skip long waits. Thankful this is a nearby option.
Pueblo Viejo,385,If I could only bring one taco truck to a deserted island  this would be the one. Huge tacos  ridiculously tasty  low    and a cool patio area. Just go here and plan on going back.
Pueblo Viejo,386,The best taco in Austin is unquestionably Pueblo Viejo s Taco Don Chago. Make no mistakes about it  any offering on the menu will delight your tastebuds and have you coming back for more.
Pueblo Viejo,387,We sought out breakfast tacos during our brief stay in Austin - this is what we found  and it was tops. Tops 
Pueblo Viejo,388,Simply great tacos   Had the breakfast tacos - the miga - outstanding   Looks like it is more of a late night spot - but worth the trek any time for a great taco  
Pueblo Viejo,389,The food was amazing. I ordered a steak quesadilla and it melted in my mouth. Almost as if it was crafted by God himself. QUALITY Mexican Food    
Pueblo Viejo,390,LOVE this taco stand. Best in the area    Here is the current MENU  as of 10 11 13   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fi.imgur.com 2FQM2Ww1F.jpg amp s 95c07b9c78689ab334f927227e6f0bd502ee953f73a4c791a47279b0fdd5da7f  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  i.imgur.com QM2Ww1F.jpg  a 
Pueblo Viejo,391,Oh my goodness.   This is the only place in Austin we came back to twice. Had their breakfast tacos each day -- favorite was the Viejo Taco. Sauces were great  food was wow. Highly recommend. Wish they would drive up to my house and serve be breakfast tacos every day.
Pueblo Viejo,392,What an awesome place. Had two breakfast tacos and they were Delish.  Hooray for Austin - food truck capital of the world
Pueblo Viejo,393,Very tasty breakfast tacos but flour tortillas not quite up to scratch. Go for the corn instead  Delicious orange salsa  very spicy.
Pueblo Viejo,394,Some of the best authentic street tacos in Austin. Breakfast tacos are amazing as well.
Pueblo Viejo,395,Five stars instead of four. What was I thinking  I eat here at least twice a week  and I m NEVER mad about it. These tacos are wonderful.
Pueblo Viejo,396,One of the better tacos I ve had so far in Austin. Pastor was nice- spicy  flavorful.  Don Chago was also solid.  Salsas were excellent  It took like 20 minutes of waiting to get our food though
Pueblo Viejo,397,I went here last weekend for breakfast. I ordered the Don Chago and the Azteca. Both were very good but I think I could have found one on the menu that I like even more. My friend swears by the Taco Bueno so I suspect I ll give that one a try next time.   The tacos are decent size but I d go ahead and order two--they re also extremely inexpensive     I d recommend adding and chips and salsa for your group-- the chips are standard but the salsa is really tasty.
Pueblo Viejo,398,These we re maybe the best tacos I ve ever had. Get the Chicharron. Skip the tortilla chips
Pueblo Viejo,399,Love this place  We go every weekend for the breakfast tacos. Just make sure you get there before the food tours.
Pueblo Viejo,400,Loved it. The food was really good and better than the sit down restaurants. We ended up doing more food trucks than restaurants.
Pueblo Viejo,401,This place is not selfish with their portions  I got the Tico Taco and the Taco Bueno. The Tico had so much avocado in it which was great  Most places are stingy with their avocado. I ate the Tico first and it filled me up  their tacos are huge    so I gave my other taco to my friend who said the chorizo was made very well. I also appreciated the fact that the corn tortillas did not fall apart unlike some other taco joints in Austin.
Pueblo Viejo,402,Killer breakfast tacos  They have good flavor and are surprisingly big. Also has a decent waiting time.
Pueblo Viejo,403,This is my favorite place to eat downtown. I love tacos and these tacos are affordable and substantial. My go-to is the Pueblo Viejo style taco. Delicious seasoned steak  mushrooms  avocado and some other stuff  maybe onions  I can t remember exactly  but that shit goes hard.   The staff are always friendly  understand English  and the food usually comes out in a timely fashion.   Don t be a pendejo  eat at Pueblo Viejo 
Pueblo Viejo,404,After seeing the stupendously long line at Franklin s  my fiancee and I frantically searched for some food joints nearby and decided to grab a bite at Pueblo Viejo  as it wasn t too far away  and we definitely wanted to try some Mexican on our trip. Pueblo Viejo is in a small lot with another food truck  that appeared to do BBQ but wasn t open yet   but there were already a few folks sitting at the tables in the lot eating. Although there wasn t much of a line  our order took somewhere between 20-30 minutes - definitely a lot longer than most food trucks that I m used to  but it probably explains why most of what we ate was really freakin  good. The prices are also much more reasonable than I m used to seeing in NYC  one taco  which is well-sized  will only set you back a few bucks.  As for the tacos...well  between the two of us  we went a bit overboard in hindsight by ordering 5 tacos. We managed to get through them all  although not without a bit of personal cost to our fitness level. I liked the Guaco Taco and the house taco  which features steak  the best. The guacamole of the Guaco Taco helps add more flavor  and with the chicken  which  for my money  is the best-marinated meat here   the taco has a really wholesome  juicy flavor that pairs phenomenally well with the corn tortillas. The house taco has a bit more of a varied flavor  as the steak s marinade is slightly different  and the mushrooms and onions add some depth beyond just the meat and its seasoning. The taco I was a bit disappointed in was the al pastor - the pork was a bit on the dry and chewy side  and compared to the steak and chicken  there was very little flavoring to bring out the flavor. While I liked the freshness of the guacamole and chips  I wish we got a bit more on the two-taco plates  I ran out of guacamole long before the chips were done   and the beans were a bit on the bland side.  I d recommend coming here to try some cheap  tasty Mexican food  particularly tacos with the chicken in them. You might wait a bit longer than you expect  though  so be prepared to wait a little.
Pueblo Viejo,405,These tacos. oh my goodness  I went for breakfast and had the Don Chago taco and the Mi Madre taco  and both were fantastic  especially with the flavorful salsas. I m from San Antonio  so I appreciate when a salsa actually TASTES like something  and these did not disappoint. I always have to order my tacos on corn and was expecting the same slightly floppy  hard-to-hold corn tortillas I ve gotten elsewhere  but these were a little crisp around the edges and sturdy   with a great corn flavor. Lastly  the guy who took my order was so friendly  Highly highly recommend 
Pueblo Viejo,406,Ordered the taco plate which came with beans  guacamole  chips w  salsa and 2 tacos  I chose steak . I also got a fresh squeezed limeade. Food and drink was delicious  It s a pretty small entrance area where you order. We were kind of confused on where the indoor seating was. The 2 black doors on the right when you walk in is where there is indoor seating if there isn t an event going on which in our case there was. We didn t mind sitting outside but the people in line ahead of us seemed very upset and bothered by it. Just be prepared to sit outside if there isn t seating inside available. Authentic Mexican food  Overall  I would definitely recommend this place 
Pueblo Viejo,407,To paint a better picture of my experience    Torchy s  I think we need to start seeing other people. 
Pueblo Viejo,408,This little Mexican food trailer is great  The taco mix ups were a bit odd  but the girls seemed open to substituting or removing what you didn t want. The breakfast tacos were sort of like when you order a Mexican breakfast plate and they give you tortillas on the side so you can put a little bit of everything in your taco  Yum  Salsas  three to choose from red  which I figured was the dipping type of salsa  green  moderately spicy  enough to give your tacos a kick  and the orange salsa  this one is Muy caliente  but Muy delicioso too  The trailer has its own section with plenty of benches to sit and enjoy so that s always great  Mexican bottled sodas here  yay  I ll need to come here more often when I m on this side of town 
Pueblo Viejo,409,This is one of my favorite breakfast taco spots. I highly recommend the Don Chago and taco bueno.  The chicken quesadilla taco is bomb too. Highly recommended 
Pueblo Viejo,410,I m a certified taco snob. I m also used to eating south Texas street tacos but I ve become accustomed to Austin tacos for the past few years. With that said  this place has good tacos. I ordered taco plate  you get a choice of two tacos  refried beans and some guac. I picked the Nes  which is steak and chorizo  Mexican sausage  and the Al pastor  marinated pork . The Nes was good but I wasn t a fan of the al pastor. The meat was too mushy and too sweet for my liking. This place gets 4 stars because these tacos are still better than other places I ve tried and because the servings are adequate. 8.50 gets you two big stuffed tacos  beans  guac and chips and salsa.
Pueblo Viejo,411,Delicious  I went there for brunch one Saturday. Got a breakfast taco of potato  cheese  egg and chorizo  al pastor taco  barbacoa taco and fish taco. all were phenomenal  great tortillas and fantastic flavors. and huge tacos  couldn t finish them all  only wish i could ve tried the fresh squeezed limeade 
Pueblo Viejo,412,tacos are a staple in this town.   and i want to staple this taco to my face.  veggie taco. guacamole. hell yes.
Pueblo Viejo,413,I went here not that hungry  but wanted something light. I ordered a chicken taco and based on the reviews of this place  I expected it to be good. It was not. It was superb  The best taco I have ever had  The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the peppers and onions were a nice touch. The prices were very reasonable. I will definitely be going back. What a great experience 
Pueblo Viejo,414,Huge disappointment... Barbacoa tacos were dry and tasteless  steak tacos has very VERY little taste  the al pastor tacos weren t too bad and the steak enchiladas were also tasteless. Guacamole has zero taste too. So if you want a ton of carbs but absolutely ZERO taste then this is the place to go.
Pueblo Viejo,415,This place is stupid delicious. Reasonably priced. Tends to get a little warm  being outdoor and all. Again  it s so delicious it makes you temporarily stupid. Don t go right before a test
Pueblo Viejo,416,Pretty tasty tacos. It s conveniently located at the corner of 6th and San Marcos. Perfect place to grab some breakfast tacos or tacos anytime of the day.
Pueblo Viejo,417,I m not a breakfast person  but Pueblo Viejo makes a great breakfast taco. They have a good selection  and service is fast and courteous  If you re in Austin  check them out for breakfast or lunch  Oh and prices are great 
Pueblo Viejo,418,Ohhhhhh my God  Tacos al pastor are the best    I had chicken and barbacoa both were really good  but the al pastor is killer. Chips and salsa came with it.
Pueblo Viejo,419,I LOVE this place  Finding this place was kind of hard because it s in a really small area  but it was worth it. There is no seating inside because the building is shared between the restaurant and a theatre. However  there is seating outside and I am pretty sure the food truck location has seating. I decided to try the fish taco and the chicken taco. In the description of the tacos  it doesn t say much and makes them sound plain  but the tacos are filled with flavor   The chicken taco was cooked to perfection- the chicken was well cooked  the poblano peppers and onions were seasoned well  and the flour tortilla was warm and soft. The chicken taco was pretty spicy  so beware if you can t take spice. The only critique I have is that they had a lot of oil but with the dab of my tissue  I was able to eliminate that. The prices of each taco were also very reasonable and I would say two tacos will fill you up. I could talk on and on about how amazing these tacos were  but it would not do them justice. This place definitely tops my favorite taco places here in Austin.
Pueblo Viejo,420,I stayed in a house nearby during a conference back in February and stopped by this place for a few meals.  The breakfast tacos are good  cheap  and pretty straightforward so they re hard to mess up. I always ordered my own with chorizo  eggs  and sometimes avocado.  I also tried the pastor taco with pineapple and the chicharron taco. Each of these was way too sweet for my taste and very unexpected for Mexican food  DISCLAIMER  I haven t had chicharron tacos previously so maybe that s how they come  but I always order pastor tacos and that s not the way I think they should taste .  Austin didn t strike me as the place to find really great Mexican food  so I think this place was okay. You may just want to stick with safer options  i.e.  no pineapple .
Pueblo Viejo,421,Would go back in a heartbeat. Small window off a music venue  off a side street. Al pastor was my fav. I cleared my plate.
Pueblo Viejo,422,This place is very unassuming. The restaurant is tucked inside of a little Night Club space but I tell you the food is magnificent   I ordered the cheese enchiladas and chicken enchilada plate the beans were sooooo good. The guacamole was really good too. Even the fresh squeezed limeade  was sweet and tangy and summertime perfect. My friend had vegetable gorditas   he s a vegetarian  and he gave them two thumbs up. It s a really cool unusual dine-in experience
Pueblo Viejo,423,I can truly say that I had the best breakfast burritos tacos  in my life. They were reasonably priced  a good size portion  and were packed with flavor. It is actually depressing me that we have nothing like this in Connecticut.
Pueblo Viejo,424,The food is EXCELLENT  but they frequently get our order either incorrect or short us. Therefore I suggest ALWAYS opening the tacos one by one to make sure they re there and are correct before leaving.
Pueblo Viejo,425,Find a street parking spot and walk over  eat outside.   I had taco bueno fresh tortilla.  Very good mix of cheese chorizo and egg.
Pueblo Viejo,426,AMAZING TACOS. Authentic and delicious. Great staff  quick service and super yummy food. I will be back 
Pueblo Viejo,427,We are vegetarians but decided to try this place based on excellent reviews. We ordered a Veggie Taco  amp  Quesadilla and they were very tasty - likely one of the best we have had anywhere  I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast or lunch for vegetarians.
Pueblo Viejo,428,My husband and I wanted a quick breakfast before we headed back to Dallas and decided to try this place because of the reviews .  It was just okay.
Pueblo Viejo,429,Great taco stand.  I brought a friend from out of town here and he was amazed that you can drink beer in the food trailer parks.  Their red salsa is particularly good  though it is spicier than most  restaurant  salsas  all of their salsas are fairly spicy .  There is rarely much of a wait  in case you are an ambulance driver.  I particularly like both the guacataco and their namesake taco.  The pictures here don t really do justice to how big these all are as well.  I m not going to go insane and claim they are the best in austin  but when I am up at 1am with a slant on  they may as well be.  If you like tacos  you will love these tacos.  Protip  no matter how much you may love these tacos  do not try to make love to them.  Like I said they are pretty spicy  and you will regret it until your roommate gets back from the store with more milk.  I don t even know if this milk helps anything.
Pueblo Viejo,430,AMAZING  I walked one mile in triple-digit heat to get to this food truck. By the time I got there I was extremely sweaty and gross..... But the tacos made up for it  Mmmm I loved the juicy and flavorful steak tacos. They came with a generous portion of avocado and salsa inside a fluffy tortilla. I topped it with this  mild  salsa which was pretty spicy  and just added to the tastiness of the taco.   They serve breakfast and lunch tacos. There are a few picnic tables in front of the truck and two other food trucks in that same area. Try it if you re in the area 
Pueblo Viejo,431,Not Vegan friendly. Although this place offers veggie tacos  they cook the veggies on the same grill as the meat and use the same cooking utensils as they do with the meat. When asked tonight if my Veggies could be cooked on a different grill with clean utensils  I was told they couldn t do that.  I was so disappointed. I hope things change when they move to their new space. If your a vegan it s good to pay attention to how your food is prepared 
Pueblo Viejo,432,This is a legitimate taco truck even though they are in prime late night Austin location on east 6th. Where did all my fav tricks go btw  Pueblo viejo was the only one around but happened to be amazing. Great pastor and very very hot salsa. Go.
Pueblo Viejo,433,vegan review    the veggies tacos on corn  yes please  most like street taco food truck in town. i love this place. HUGE portions. i hear the bfast tacos are also divine...open early. nice shaded outside seating for a quick lunch getaway 
Pueblo Viejo,434,The tacos here are just magical. Aside from the simple steak chicken tacos  the tacos here contain an interesting combination of ingredients -- things you wouldn t normally find at your standard taco trailer. They also offer some homemade salsa for your tacos with three different spicy levels. Given the size of the tacos  2-3 of them can be enough to satisfy the average appetite.  Betwen the Pueblo Viejo style taco  fish taco  Guaca taco  and Al Pastor  the PV is by far my favorite  as it was the most flavorfu and the biggest taco. After eating the PV taco first  the others just dimmed in comparison  even though I found them all to be extremely tasty.   As far as food trailers go  you can get a good meal at a pretty decent price. However  if you look at it from the perspective of cheap Mexican food trailer  these tacos are a bit pricey at  3  3.50 each. Even so  the tacos are so delicious  this is definitely a place I would bring my friends to.
Pueblo Viejo,435,Tacos are really f   ing good and decently priced and are a good size   value. Not sure what else to say.  Why not 5 stars  Well  it s a taco truck.....for 5 stars I d need aircon  it s in Texas y all   Occasionally have you fight off the birds  feathered kind  who seem to like the orange habanero salsa  locals might want to think about umbrellas else run risk of bald spots developing if pooped on .
Pueblo Viejo,436,There are basically two types of food trailers in this town  ones that serve cheap  authentic Mexican food and ones that serve novelty gourmet fare. Pueblo Viejo seems to try to sit on the imaginary fence dividing the two but it s a precarious perch.  Waiting in line I d settled on a Pastor plate but was informed they were out. On the nice gal s suggestion I made the plate with two of their specialty tacos for a buck extra - a signature Viejo Taco and a Nes Taco. Both were over-stuffed with ingredient combinations you wouldn t find at a standard taco trailer and both were quite good. Tiny dollops of beans and guacamole salad rounded things out. I wouldn t complain about those portion sizes except that along with a can of soda  the plate topped ten bucks - a number that just doesn t seem to quite square with God s Law  Taco Physics or Food Trailer Economics.   Bottom line  Good tacos  but not good enough to rave about at a price point that positions Pueblo Viejo in the  novelty gourmet  camp of food trailers. I hemmed and hawed between three and four stars on this one but methinks some other reviews are a tad over-enthusiastic... three  keepin  it real  stars it is.
Pueblo Viejo,437,One of my favorite taco stands in Austin. The food is great it s cheap and it comes from a mini schoolbus. I hope this place never changes.
Pueblo Viejo,438,Best tacos I had in Austin.  Food truck with no line.  Tacos were made to order.  Breakfast taco that I had as excellent.  Great way to start the day.  Also the al pastor nearly rivaled the best al pastor I ve ever had.  Fish taco wasn t fantastic  but I still enjoyed it.  Very reasonable prices.  Will definitely come back should I find myself in Austin again.
Pueblo Viejo,439,Pueblo Viejo taco is the way to go  Cheesy with grilled peppers and onions.. Get a fork cause they stuff the taco so full you re going to have a lot of deliciousness spilling out that you ll want to scoop up 
Pueblo Viejo,440,I know what you re thinking when you walk into the food trailer park   Just another taco truck. AVOID.   I know that because that s what I was thinking on several of my previous visits to the East Side Drive-In on e 6th and San Marcos. But I was SO WRONG.  Friends  I was delirious with hunger. My will was broken. I asked myself if I should even have been driving. Probably not. So I pulled over to this little food trailer area  praying that some food truck could deliver something delicious in a minimum of time.   Ugly Banjo s  Closed.  19  Closed. Vegan Yacht  Also closed. Love Balls  Open  but I happen to heartily dislike both mushrooms and octopus  the main components of the lovely balls. I wrote off Pueblo Viejo  and  between Pig Vicious and The Local Yolk  decided to try an egg sandwich from the Local Yolk. But as soon as I got up to the window  the cashier was walking out the other door. I could hear  i ll be right baaaa...  and a door slam. But I couldn t wait for him. The line at Pig Vicious looked suspiciously long.   Oh  fine  I ll get a taco. It ll be boring  but at least it ll be fast.   How downtrodden was I  Well  I just walked right up to place my order.  Do you still serve breakfast tacos  editor s note  this was at approximately 3 40pm     The kind  patient woman taking my order made my day.  Of course  we serve them all day   Maybe she called me  mija   too.   The Don Chago  does my memory serve   - is it good    It s my favorite of our breakfast tacos.   That. that s what I want. And a gordita con rajas  for good measure.   These items plus my refreshingly chilled Topo Chico ran me to about  7  and all I had to do then was wait.  I called my mom.  Mom  I might have made a mediocre food choice   Saman  she calls me sa-MAN  not Sam or Samantha. It s endearing  I guess   you might be overthinking this.  We had a 5-minute heart-to-heart. It was only partially about tacos. Then I heard that kind taco truck lady call my name.  Mom  my food is ready  gottagobye     I grabbed my food  well-wrapped  and already with salsa in the bag  and drove home. If it had been more than a 3 minute drive  I probably wouldn t have made it. I ran inside  unwrapped my food  and dove in.   It was SO. GOOD. Don chago was beans and bacon and avocado and magic. The salsa was perfect. The gordita  Delicious. Thin strips of pepper buried under a hearty dose of melted cheese. All was made refreshing by the Topo Chico. I ate it all and my boyfriend had to give me a judgmental look for trying to lick the foil.  Pueblo Viejo  I am so sorry I thought you were just another food trailer. Please just save me some tamales for my next visit. My intentions are pure.
Pueblo Viejo,441,We came here for breakfast tacos and they were amazing. The salsa were out of this world too. And at 2.50  taco for make when you order can t be beat  Excited to try it for lunch.
Pueblo Viejo,442,I am visiting from out of town and love you how was the closest place where we could get breakfast tacos. We figured what the hack and went in to get some tacos. The breakfast tacos were absolutely spectacular. I recommend the flower tortilla. We had four different kinds of breakfast tacos all were amazing.
Pueblo Viejo,443,This Taco Truck has what you need to leave satisfied. Take your Go Local card for a discount. Get a breakfast taco at night. The Don Chago is pretty damm good  yelpers. If youve followed my taco reviews  you know I wont steer you wrong like the gueros that practice their spanish at La Michoacana and cant tell the difference between a pork pastor and the treads on their shoes.   Get yourself a Topo Chico  some tacos and chips  turn off your damn mobile device  and tell the plans and designs racing through your head to go haunt some other house. Now focus on each bite  each precious bite  of your taco.   You know how you re sad when you ve arrived at the last spoonful of Amy s ice cream  That same feeling arrives upon seeing one bite of your Pueblo Viejo taco remaining. You re thinking  should I get another  Hell Yes you should    I tip these folks well  they work hard and keep some of the most consistent hours in TacoTruckdom. I d give em 5 stars except the tortillas are store bought and not hand made.    Andele pues Pueblo Viejo   Bravisimo  Volveremos.
Pueblo Viejo,444,Walked here for weekend breakfast based on Yelp reviews. Open early if you need food and can t wait for brunch. The outdoor seating area has great views of downtown and is shaded by large trees. Good for getting a bite with your dog. The breakfast and signature tacos were stuffed to the brim  Love the contents but the corn tortillas were a bit bland.
Pueblo Viejo,445,Amazing breakfast tacos.  Maybe the tastiest meal I had in a recent 4 day Austin visit.  Would have loved to come back for lunch but maybe next time.  5 stars knocked it our of the Park goodness
Pueblo Viejo,446,My spoon was dirty and the chips are Tostitos chips   the salsa comes in small dishes and the food is expensive   plus the waiters aren t nice and welcoming . First time here in Austin and Hurd good reviews and this isn t a good experience .
Pueblo Viejo,447,I was real disappointed.  Out of some dishes  the guacamole came on a bed or lettuce and it was more lettuce and than guac. The salsa tasted of pure tomato and hardly any spice.  Dude seemed stressed maybe but I was disappointed.
Pueblo Viejo,448,This new taco truck in East Austin is the bomb. Breakfast tacos   tacos and tamales  etc. There are set menu items or you can just tell them what you want in it. Made to order biatch.  Staff very friendly and happy to serve. Seemingly always open while the six or so other trailers in the park are never open during the day.  I ate my taco this morning and said  Damn  Thats better than Taco Deli   Bold statement I know. Check it out for yourself. I recommend the black bean  bacon  avocado or the steak taco.  Haven t tried the tamales yet but that will change soon. Very sucking soon.   Its in the new trailer park eatery at E. 6th and San Marcos. The venue is called East Side Drive-In. It is a new outdoor music venue with a food park attached.
Pueblo Viejo,449,Immaculate. Fucking immaculate. Like the font-face of God s intra-office memos.
Pueblo Viejo,450,A couple of friends of mine went exploring East 6th Street for the first time. At 2 o clock we were hungry and who was ready for us  Pueblo Viejo -- the only trailer open   If in doubt of what to order  order the item on the menu named after the place you re ordering from  and man was that a smart idea   The Pueblo viejo taco was delicious with peppers  avocado  and steak.  It was cooked to perfection  and the flavors meshed so well  It was so good we went back the next day for lunch 
Pueblo Viejo,451,Yu-mmy  I am having trouble thinking of what to say about this place  because it was just too stinking fabulous  First off  they have orange Fanta in a glass bottle. I m already sold. I got the breakfast taco tico and added potatoes  then I had the chicken avocado. Man  I wish I had the recipe for that chicken. It almost tasted like wok-fried chicken  and it was amazing just by itself with a fork. The tacos are pretty large and definitely messy  maybe not the best place for a first date  you will get messy    so I couldn t even finish 2 tacos. The outdoor seating in the food truck area is pleasant as well. I can t wait to go back 
Pueblo Viejo,452,While on a short visit to Texas  my goal was to eat a lot of delicious tacos. This place had by far the best tacos I tasted the whole weekend  The price was also cheaper than other places but they definitely didn t skimp on the amount of meat and filling in the tacos. I got the Don Chago  Guaca Taco with steak  and a taco al pastor. All three were great but I have a special place in my heart for al pastor and these were the BEST I ve ever had  So full of meat with great flavor. The salsas are also really fantastic - we tried all four but my favorite was the creamy green one. Really good kick with a whole lot of flavor. If I m ever back in Austin  I m definitely coming back for more.
Pueblo Viejo,453,I m a big fan of tacos. I eat them a lot. I stopped in here last weekend whilst wandering around East Austin and their trailer looked the most promising. I tried to order a gordita but they were out of them. So I settled for one standard chicken taco. Can t screw that one up  right   The price was decent. I was getting excited. And then I had to wait for 15-20 minutes for my food in the blistering ridiculous sun. The taco was pretty tasty - but not at all what I expected. The menu is really quite vague. It was chunks of chicken slathered in a spicy red sauce with grilled poblanos and onions. I was kind of expecting some lettuce or something to cool the spice  but to no avail.   I trust you other Yelpers that this place has serious potential and I ll definitely make it a point to give them a second chance. But this visit left me kind of ...  meh   and wishing I d gone to Torchy s instead.
Pueblo Viejo,454,Breakfast tacos were phenomenal  Between my friend and I we got 4 different tacos  and they were all amazing. Highly recommended 
Pueblo Viejo,455,The al pastor taco was decent  the meat didn t have a lot of flavor in my opinion. Fish and steak were also decent  fish better seasoned than steak  perhaps we could have added more flavor by exploiting the spicy sauce that was available. The guacamole initially looked like a lot until you saw it was on a bed of shredded lettuce  and I think we for the end of the bad of chips because they were all small and broken. The picnic tables could have been wiped off a little more regularly too. Overall  good choice for a late night snack.
Pueblo Viejo,456,These might be the best tacos I ve ever had  I got the tacos don chago which came with refried pinto beans  avocado  bacon and tons of gooey cheese. You can t go wrong with a combo like that  and topped with their salsa verde... taco heaven. The boyfriend got the gordita plate with beef and didn t seem to enjoy his meal quite as much as I did mine. We also got their homemade limeade  which was a bit on the tart side  but that s how I like it. 10 10 would definitely return.
Pueblo Viejo,457,Best Tacos in Austin. That s a bold statement  I know. But I ve been eating these tacos for 5 years and they re as good as the first day my lips tasted a chicken guacataco. Love it 
Pueblo Viejo,458,This place is awesome  Run by a brother and sister duo  they have some of the best tacos. They get their tortillas from down the street at Milagro s and their produce from local suppliers as well. A great Austin spot at the new East Side Drive-In  they occasionally have DJ s and even live bands. Last time I was there they had a keg of DosXX and the owner was telling me they wanted to start having free beer on Thursdays. All you have to do is buy 1 taco. Done  I ll sit there and eat and drink all night. It s a cool place to people watch also. They get super busy late night  when all of the bars let out  but they re also open during the day for breakfast tacos. When you go  day or night  you have to get the Taco Bueno  or the Pueblo Viejo Style Taco 
Pueblo Viejo,459,After quite a trying noontime traffic rush on a Sunday  Valentine s Day  Marathon here in Austin  we were originally looking for bbq. With all of the street closures we finally made it to Stubbs only to find a line of people about 50 deep  so we crawled over to Iron Works  which was closed on Sunday  just like our breakfast place  Slate   we were ready to give up on anything to eat in Austin while here for a wedding.   While hunting for breakfast earlier  someone told us about a great food truck on 6th just the other side of the freeway from downtown. Thus  we ended up at this place for lunch. What a find   We ordered and sat at a picnic table under the trees. We started with the guacamole  which was very good. Two of us had the taco plate with one chicken and one pork pineapple. Very good with great flavor. Also came with more guacamole and chips. Another had the fish taco which was also good. Overall very positive. My 23 year old son loved it except for the grackle perched over us dropped a present on his shoulder at the end of the meal. I told him it was good luck   Great place. Cool vibe with a lot of locals walking by with their dogs and grabbing a bite too.
Pueblo Viejo,460,I think I might name my first child Don.   Best tacos in Austin hands down.   I don t know what they put into their tacos but I am a happy addict.
Pueblo Viejo,461,Before I moved to Austin I dreamed about the amazing food trucks that I would get to try once I lived here. This truck came straight from my dreams. The tacos are beyond amazing and only  3.50  The fish taco was one of the best I have had. Everthing tasted so fresh and the fish wasn t fried  which I appreciated. So happy that I live in East Austin so that I can visit all the time.
Pueblo Viejo,462,We came here on Yelp recommendation  and were thrilled. There were plenty of tables under a nice shade tree. The food was outstanding  and the man working the counter was very helpful. We all got different tacos  and all were delicious. The guacamole and chips was fresh and a generous amount of guacamole. The service is a bit slow - but they are cooking these to order  We will be back.
Pueblo Viejo,463,Best tacos I ve ever had. The migas and fish are amazing. Ate here for breakfast once 5 days straight. Hot sauces come correct as well.
Pueblo Viejo,464,Absolute garbage. After ordering 2 entrees. Meaning two tacos each they charged us   39. Rude service and awful food.
Pueblo Viejo,465,This area is amazing  Run by a brother and sister duo  they ve a number of the finest tacos. They get their tortillas from down the road at Milagro s and their produce from local providers too. A great Austin area in the new East Side Drive In  they sometimes have DJ s and even live groups. Most recent time that I was there they had a keg of DosXX as well as the owner was telling me they needed to begin having free beer on Thursdays. All you need to do is purchase 1 taco. Done  I will sit there and eat and drink all night. Itis a cool spot to people watch additionally.
Pueblo Viejo,466,Awesome place.  I walked from the Hilton about  3 blocks to get some breakfast food.  I was doing south beach diet so she was nice enough to make mine with the tortilla shells and then I just ate it with a fork.  Low price.  Good food.
Pueblo Viejo,467,Tacos are soooooo good. Just know that it will take about 40 min for you to enjoy them.
Pueblo Viejo,468,Bruh  fam  squad. Pueblo Viejo may quite possibly be the best damn tacos in the city of Austin. For less than  5 bucks  you can grab a pueblo viejo style taco and be full for days. The tacos they bang out of this truck are top notch. You ever see those Matthew McCounaghey Lincoln car commercials and ask  damn  what is this guy on   I bet you he just had a pueblo viejo taco before the commercial shoot. These tacos are so good you will have an existential dilemna  which came first pueblo viejo or the taco   Either way  check this place out. It s affordable  it has great quality  the flavor is immense  and you will leave full. Hurry up and get here if you get the chance 
Pueblo Viejo,469,The tacos are solid. The burritos are also delicious. And the horchata is perfection.
Pueblo Viejo,470,I wish I could have awesome things to say about this place  I really do. Especially after reading about them on Taco Journalism. Perhaps Wednesday nights are just not a good night to go... maybe my expectations are too high... I don t know.  I ll give them one thing  their customer service is supreme. Which is what gave them the extra star. I haven t met such a friendly  welcoming food trailer in all of Austin like them. I do hope they keep that up     The food  on the other hand  left me a bit disappointed. I eagerly ordered the Taco plate  with chicken and beef and corn tortillas. The tortillas are obviously store-bought  local  I m sure . They were very plastic-y and hard to chew on. The guacamole was pretty good  though  As was the chicken and beef in the tacos  the protein was very well seasoned and tender. I gave up on the tortillas after 4 bites and just had the meat. The beans tasted quite canned. My husband ordered the Torta plate  with chicken and steak tortas. Again  the meats were very delicious  but the torta had a day or 2 old taste to them. Very chewy and not easy going down.  I won t let this experience ruin it for me though. If anything  their friendly service certainly has me willing to give them another shot   
Pueblo Viejo,471,Just stopped here for a quick bite while waiting for a friend to land in Austin. We ve got a 3 hour drive back to San Angelo and I m so glad I didn t wait to stop at some fast food joint along the way. Seriously  some of the best tacos I have ever eaten. Affordable  made to order and the portions are very filling.
Pueblo Viejo,472,I stopped by for some breakfast tacos right at open. No one was there but it still took 20 minutes to get a couple tacos. Once the wait was done  it was worth it. I d be back.
Pueblo Viejo,473,It s fine if in neighborhood id go to taco place on airport road much better cant remember name right next to kome sushi
Pueblo Viejo,474,DAMN good food. Prices are great and they deliver DAMN good food. I love the Taco Bueno and Azteca but you can t go wrong here.
Pueblo Viejo,475,This place was out of this world  We were looking for an authentic food truck experience and this was it  The man that helped was so friendly and really so helpful  he made the entire experience wonderful  I think his name was Ernesto possibly  I did not quite understand it  But incredible food and great service made this a good day for our family
Pueblo Viejo,476,Quesadilla Taco with Avocado. Absolute best taco in Texas. This is definitely hidden  there is never anyone here and everyone that s been rave s about it 
Pueblo Viejo,477,The food from Pueblo Viejo is perfectly fine but I find it is generally more expensive than some of my favorite brick and mortar restaurants and typically the food isn t anything fantastic. I do really enjoy their salsas 
Pueblo Viejo,478,Tastes like what I imagine angel tears to taste like. I wish this place could still be me and my friends  little secret  but their growing fan base is well deserved. Everything is great  but my go-to is always the Don Chago 
Pueblo Viejo,479,Greatest breakfast tacos around. Can t go wrong with the Taco Bueno or the Don Chago. I m also a big fan of the quesadilla taco  super cheesy.   Make sure to get the orange sauce 
Pueblo Viejo,480,A co-work had recommended this place to me - specifically the gordita plate - several times  so I decided to try it just now.  Ahem...the steak gordita plate was so good my head spun around counterclockwise five times.  I was very impressed while consuming this dish and quite sad when it was over.   This is actually my first shot at eating trailer food...I hope I have not already peaked out...surely the other places can t be this good.
Pueblo Viejo,481,These tacos are amazing  The breakfast tacos to start - the Don Chago was excellent  loaded with bacon  avocado and egg - try it with the creamy green sauce but be careful it s hot   The steak taco has some of the juiciest and tender steak I ve had - not something you find in a truck trailer.  Add potatoes to it  They are cooked perfectly.  A  tortillas and salsa.  The service was excellent and super fast and the ability to BYOB is awesome.
Pueblo Viejo,482,A little off the beaten path  but great breakfast tacos. Cheap   2.50 per   plenty of food  and tasted great. Nice staff. Seating wasn t that great but it s a food truck so the fact that they have any is a plus.
Pueblo Viejo,483,Was one of my favorite places in Austin but since upgrading their truck they are not open in the evenings.   
Pueblo Viejo,484,Had a pastor taco.... Effing delicious   Cant wait to come back here...
Pueblo Viejo,485,It s already been said  but this place has great tacos at a great price. People were also friendly and helpful. We had 4 custom tacos and everything was perfect with great portion sizes. That orange habanero sauce is fantastic  but it s got a kick   
Pueblo Viejo,486,First time at Pueblo viejo  amp  it was delicious   I ordered the taco buenos on a sunday at about 9 30am with no line    highly recommend
Pueblo Viejo,487,Great breakfast tacos.  2.50 per taco is a bargain considering how big they are. I went with my family and we tried the Don Chago  taco bueno  taco azteca  taco viejo   and taco margarita. All tacos were good and flavorful with our favorites being the taco bueno and taco azteca. Their limeade is also very good.
Pueblo Viejo,488,Some of the best tacos I ve ever had  The staff was so helpful in making our decisions  The guacamole was to die for  and the beer was excellent   5 stars for sure 
Pueblo Viejo,489,Awesome  friendly service. A bunch of us tried a variety of tacos-- quesadilla taco  lamb barbacoa  migas  pueblo viejo style-- and they were all awesome. Corn and flour tortillas were pretty good too. Great salsa  although their red was a little too much tomato and almost no heat.
Pueblo Viejo,490,Made a big mistake choosing this place for my first ever breakfast taco experience. Nothing has come close and yes  I ve been looking 
Pueblo Viejo,491,The tacos here are really good however unless I just got really unlucky there was a dead fly underneath my lime slice that came on the plate.  I didn t mind since the insect wasn t on nor touching my tacos.  I just grabbed a different lime and ate on.  Get the beef taco very worth the wait and the extra visitor. Their salsa was great too  tasted great.
Pueblo Viejo,492,Chips and salsa  At a generic joint called  Tex-Mex Deli   Eh. Chips and HOMEMADE salsa  At a gentrified-area-located trailer named something like Pueblo Viejo  Yes  please.  The chips are from right next door  El Milagro  but they do the salsa in-house. They also give you an unlimited amount  in the form of liquid-based substance that is squired out of a squirt bottle. The red is fresh and crisp tasting  and the green is a bit smoother and provides a bit more zing.  I also had to follow up with a bit of tamale. The tamale is a touch dry  but the pork one had a hefty amount of pork and a SPICY red sauce. My nose was running  and PV is admirable for causing that in my life on a cold  beautiful February day.  Give this joint a shot. They do tacos  housemade salsa  gorditas  tamales... they pull out all the stops. Additionally  it is BYO  as it is a trailer. Furthermore  who doesn t like cheap pricing and great service 
Pueblo Viejo,493,This is stop  20 on my 2010 Trailer Quest.  Time  9 35 p.m. Day  November 30  2010  Order  Guaco Taco and Al Pastor Taco  Total   7  Perks  Nice location and open late. Very friendly staff.  Downsides  Tacos weren t memorable and  3.50 or so for a taco was too high for what I got.   I m willing to try the breakfast tacos based on the other reviews  though.
Pueblo Viejo,494,We walked up to this unassuming food stand lot at about 3 pm on a Tuesday and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food from Pueblo Viejo.    In addition to their set menu  you can create your own tacos  so we did some Tico Tacos  potato  black bean  avocado  with additions  primarily eggs  for an extra  .25 or  .30 each.  The eggs were amazing  the avocado fresh and the potatoes delish.  Guac  amp  salsa  hot   were also pretty good.  The tortillas were also a highlight for the texture  amp  taste.  And we ordered a total of 4 tacos  2 drinks  amp  the guac and chips all for less than  20.    There were a few other trucks around that were mostly closed at that point in the day  siesta time    but there seem to typically be a few more options  some vegan  some desserts  some drink specials and the hilariously titled Love Balls  a Japanese-inspired food truck.  A great find just off the beaten path of 6th st. on the east side of I-35.    Do it 
Pueblo Viejo,495,I went here for lunch and had the quesadilla taco with chicken and it was delicious. The service was friendly and it didn t take long for my food to come out.  It was very affordable as well.
Pueblo Viejo,496,All I can say is WOW   Great and authentic. Had the al Pastor abd Chich and both were awesome.  Kinda of a rough looking  truck  but who cares. All I could think of was the food 
Pueblo Viejo,497,Amazing tacos - will drive across town for these - and that means passing LOTS of other taco places   Had the veggie and pueblo viejo tacos - with corn tortillas that had to have been homemade.  Planning to come back soon - and hoping their new restaurant will be just as good 
Pueblo Viejo,498,Went here this morning and loved it. Plenty of meatless options  super cheap  and really damn good. Huge portions as well. I ordered two tacos and had to split the second one with my husband. Perfect hangover grub. Or anytime grub.
Pueblo Viejo,499,I m a taco enthusiast and I m telling you  these tacos are some of the best I ve ever eaten. Pueblo Viejo on every corner por favor   
Pueblo Viejo,500,I love their Rajas con Queso tacos    They have awesome salsas.    I have eaten there twice and I crave their food all the time  I wish they were located closer to my office so I could go there for breakfast and lunch    
Taco Joint,1,Whoa what an excellent find basically across the street from our hotel  We had just gotten into Austin and were getting settled at the Embassy Suites and trying to figure out what we wanted to do for a quick bite. We were originally going to head into downtown but a quick search and this spot popped up basically across the street  It was about 3pm and they closed at 4pm so we rushed over. Really the only downside to this place is the hours.  ADORABLE little cantina looking place  It s fast casualish  so just order at the counter and go sit wherever. Service was very fast  Prices are awesome and you can also get breakfast tacos all day  I got the street taco  holy mole  and the fried fish taco. I also got a prickly pear margarita and we got a thing of chips and queso to share. Everything was SO GOOD  I think the street taco was my favorite but they were all delicious. My friends all enjoyed their tacos as well and pretty sure we devoured everything    If you are in the area just south of downtown  highly recommend this place. It was a great introduction to Austin s taco scene for us 
Taco Joint,2,This place is amazing. Their chips and tortillas are incredible. I got the chicken fajita and it was amazing  my wife got a breakfast taco.   The guac is great- pretty spicy though. But Taco Joint is now one of my wife and my favs.
Taco Joint,3,Food  4 5 Ordered the Bacon  Potato  Egg  and Cheese breakfast taco. Everything was well cooked and crispy  The portion size was LARGE. The taco wasn t particularly adventurous with its flavor or seasonings though.  Service  N A This was a takeout order.  Environment  N A This was a takeout order.
Taco Joint,4,Hands down the best taco place in Austin. I ve been coming here for years and it s been consistently incredible every time. My favorite tacos are the sausage and egg and street tacos. The avocado sauce is the perfect topping. I will always recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin.
Taco Joint,5,Taco joint is probably my favorite tacos in Austin. The tortillas may be the best I ve ever had  Breakfast tacos are really good but i personably think taco joint shines at lunch time. The El Senor Crocket is my go to  but the El Porko is also great. You really can t go wrong here. The salsas are also amazing  definitely try a few options 
Taco Joint,6,The tacos are so yummy and filling. Service is quick. The ambiance is go go go. Small restaurant that gets filled fast.
Taco Joint,7,Taco Joint has always been one of my go-to places for lunch tacos. I usually go for their most popular items  the street and fish tacos. They are great  The steak  egg  gouda cheese taco is pretty awesome too if you re a fan of delicious cheese.  This time to switch things up I got the shrimp taco   4.25   which had good flavor  and the loaded nachos   7.95 . The nachos really surprised me  because they were packed with flavor and crunch  a bit of a kick from the jalape o peppers  and tasty chunks of meat. My friend and I dusted it.   Indoor seating is okay  but the place is a bit small. There s some outdoor seating too. Plenty of parking around the restaurant. I ll be back to either this one or the San Jac location 
Taco Joint,8,Ok. First off the tacos are huge. I made the unfortunate mistake of ordering three and chips and queso and I could not finish them all. The tacos are a good price and a good size. Highly recommend the fish - fried of course with chipotle salsa   Chips are fresh    Pro-tip  bag of chips is huge  Enough for mor than 4 ppl.
Taco Joint,9,So... many... taco... restaurants. I ve been putting it off but now it s time to start my Austin reviews  starting with the very first  actually second cuz we had breakfast tacos  taco spot.  The verdict- pretty damn good. I m gonna give them 4-stars  not because they aren t delicious  but similar to other cities that specialize in a type of cuisine  BBQ in Memphis  pizza in NYC  etc.   I m grading on a serious curve here. This would be 10 stars if this place was in NYC...  Anyways  I think they would make the top 10 cut for Austin tacos which is really saying something. But for my purposes it s 4 stars...
Taco Joint,10,Great taco spot a little outside of downtown. Parking was plentiful  and free   and there were a lot of tables. Me and a coworker stopped here for a quick lunch  wanting to avoid the downtown parking situation. It was pretty busy at lunch time  but the line moved well. Even though it was super busy  all my food came out pretty quickly   I got the El Senor Crocket  El 4 20  and the Street Taco. Each of them tasted delicious and the salsa was good with it  The meats especially were so tasty in each of the tacos.   They have a lot of options for breakfast tacos and I m seeing a lot of great reviews for them. I ll be back to try them next time 
Taco Joint,11,Stopped in for a quick bite and had read some good things about Taco Joint so I decided to give it a try. Good amount of outdoor seating as well as some indoor tables. Staff was also very friendly.  I tried the street taco  comes with beef  and the potato egg cheese breakfast taco here. The street taco was HUGE  Not what I would normally expect from a street taco. Also got it on a flour tortilla today although I usually prefer corn. The meat itself wasn t particularly flavorful  but it was pretty tender. The potato egg cheese was alright. The potatoes were a bit mushy and had pretty minimal seasoning. The eggs were a bit dry and there was a lot of it. Luckily  the salsa here is pretty good and saved both of the tacos.  Overall  good quantity  but less than great tacos.
Taco Joint,12,These tacos are not recommended  bland egg  amp  chorizo. The potato was ok. Now the  corn tortillas are literally some of the worst in Austin I ve ever had not handmade what soever  Will not be returning. I also had a egg potato and bean taco which I took one bite out of and threw the rest out for the crows. Peace y all
Taco Joint,13,Ambiance is just okay. The veg taco was one of the best that I ever had. The guacamole was just okay. My friend tried some meat based tacos and loved all of them.
Taco Joint,14,1st of all  I love the El senor crocket  the 1st one on the menu. I think it is tasted better than the popular street taco which is little bit dry to me.  The waiter is very nice and patient to answer questions and introduce options even though we went during lunch time and there was a long line.  The vegetarian options we bought were ok. My friend wasn t enjoying much.
Taco Joint,15,I ve been here several times for breakfast but recently swung by for lunch. Grabbed a couple of street tacos. Great flavor and filling  one would have been enough. Still digging those salsas 
Taco Joint,16,Fresh  tasty  fair price. Will come back. Used Yelp to find it. So happy. I m 11 characters away
Taco Joint,17,The closest taco place to my new office.  In fact  it s almost in the office s parking lot.  I ve been twice for breakfast and I ll want to give them a try for lunch based on breakfast.  The corn tortillas are on point and clearly warmed before preparation.  My bacon  potato  and cheese tacos have  both times  bordered on perfection.  I really like the plain cheese which complements the standard taco to perfection.  While they have multiple salsas  the red salsa is definitely my go-to.  If there s one negative for breakfast  it s that there s no iced tea.  You ll need to choose between coffee and a variety of bottled drinks.
Taco Joint,18,We go here at least once a week for lunch or breakfast. The tacos are absolutely unbeatable  Austin has a lot of good taco spots but this has to be top 5. The chicken and wholly mole are some of our favorites. But the veggie and fish are also stellar. Expect to wait in line but it moves fast. Do not skip on the salsas  the chipotle  habanero and avocado are a must.
Taco Joint,19,The breakfast tacos were fantastic and piping hot  Unfortunately the street tacos I ordered weren t as fantastic
Taco Joint,20,Fast service  friendly staff  tacos are on point  Definitely a stop you have to make if your visiting and want a quick authentication bite to eat.
Taco Joint,21,Y all have to check this place out for some delicious tacos on a budget  esp dining in Austin .   We were visiting and wanted some tacos and saw great reviews for this place and now I know why  The cashier was very nice and made some recommendations.   We tried the shrimp tacos off the  secret goodies menu   barbacoa  pastorito  fried fish  and a chicken quesadilla for my toddler.   Wow  the shrimp taco was my fave  It s a little saucy with peppers and onions and just plain delightful.  The barbacoa was super tender and it was my husbands fave. All of their salsas were good but the medium and habanero was our fave.   Chicken quesadilla was made with marinated chicken thighs and my toddler devoured the whole thing.   We re totally coming back next time we re in town 
Taco Joint,22,I love tacos. Austin has lots of tacos. This place is my favorite.   I ve probably been to taco joint 30  times now and my go to order is always street taco and potato egg and cheese. 2 tacos are very filling. Great prices too  Get the chipotle sauce if you come  it s magical
Taco Joint,23,Great place to grab breakfast tacos and may I add their cold brew is pretty tasty . Service is always on point
Taco Joint,24,Literally stumbled upon this place as we were trying to make a u-turn to go to another Tacos place and boy oh boy they had the best tacos we ve had in a very long time.  Appetizer  chips with salsa - delicious  We couldn t stop eating them. They are hand made so are very crunchy with great flavor. Can have with or without salsa. The salsa was delicious too. A bit spicy for me  I normally don t like spice  but I couldn t stop eating it either.   My BFF ordered    1  Seared Fish Tacos -  Seared. Seared fish fillet topped with honey lime cabbage slaw  amp  topped with cilantro  amp  cotija cheese -     2  Chicken Fajita Taco - Marinated chicken seared with onions  amp  peppers.  I ordered the    1  Street Tacos - Grilled sirloin  caramelized onion  avo  cilantro  queso fresco -    2  Wholly Mole Chicken -    CAUTION    CONTAINS PEANUTS. Pulled chicken stewed in homemade mole sauce topped with shredded cabbage  amp  queso fresco.  Sides  Red Salsa  that s the actual name  and Chipotle Salsa which were delicious and fresh as well.  I m eating the chips as I write this and can t stop eating them two hours later LOL .  All are good sized portions so suggest you start with two tacos unless you re really hungry. In my opinion two tacos are enough.  The staff were very friendly  welcoming and helpful. We look forward to our next visit.   This location is at Riverside Drive and are only open from 7am - 4pm and closed on Mondays.  Enjoy 
Taco Joint,25,This location had a lot of seating and was much busier than the other location near the university. There were a limited amount of parking spaces.  I ordered the potato  egg   amp  cheese taco and shrimp taco with the hot coffee deal  free hot coffee when you bring your own usable cup .   The potato  egg   amp  cheese taco with flour was tasty and yummy for breakfast. The shrimp taco was decent. The coffee was very watery  lukewarm  and astringent.   Decent breakfast tacos but meat isn t really their speciality. I d stick with the eggs  potatoes  cheese  and veggies here 
Taco Joint,26,WOW  I m still salivating from my portobello fajitas taco. Honestly one of the best tacos I have had in a long time. Highly recommend for anyone vegan or vegetarian or mushroom lovers in general.
Taco Joint,27,Although we live closer to the other Taco Joint location  we made the drive to this one for their Torte Ale.   Ah  the Torta Ale  Breaded beef milanesa  avo  pico  cotija cheese  lettuce  pinto bean spread  amp  ranchero mayo served on a telera roll  with a side of plantain chips. The fried breaded beef is done well  not a hint of grease remains. It s an enormous sandwich. They serve it cut in half. Each half is basically the size of a regular burger. If you re hungry  it s a very satisfying meal. If you re not  it s a very satisfying two meals.  I have a friend who swears by the La Ahogada torta. We ll try that next.
Taco Joint,28,I really like this place.  The variety of tacos is good.  The salsas are delicious and compliment the flavor of the tacos.
Taco Joint,29,Stopped in for some lunch tacos. I was recommended to check this place out by multiple people. I went with three of the most popular tacos with the most popular sauces. I m not sure if I caught them on a bad day or not but the taco shells were very chewy and cold. The inside of the taco was very runny and hard to eat.
Taco Joint,30,Solid joint for breakfast tacos. Got the potato  egg  cheese on corn tortilla and el gringo  egg white and spinach . Pick the salsa you want. I got chipotle and green which was delicious. Would come back 
Taco Joint,31,I came to Austin for the sole purpose of eating at as many different barbecue spots as was physically possible over the course of three days  and you know what I ended up doing  I ended up eating at Taco Joint THREE times in three days. Even from a harsh  Los Angeles-based taco critic like myself  Taco Joint really is that good.   Star 1  How were the service and atmosphere   Taco Joint is authentic  local  and boy oh boy are they the real deal. Quality ingredients reign supreme  but even so they re speedy and while having adapted to covid they still maintain a comfortable eating atmosphere outside. Star.   Star 2  How were the portions relative to the cost   Taco Joint s street tacos are... not at all street tacos nor are they priced as such. Move over little  1.25 single bit street tacos  because these are beastly flour wrapped tacs that are very much worth their  3.95 price tag. Breakfast tacos were cheaper  rightfully so  but all in all the same size. Star.   Stars 3 and 4  How was the food   It is tough these days to find a taco spot that well executes traditional  contemporary  and breakfast tacos  but Taco Joint does exactly that. Their breakfast tacos  Spot on  with great meats that pair with their habanero salsa in particular. Their street tacos  Stellar  and bursting with flavor from their high quality meats. Finally  their grilled fish taco was the surprise of the evening  and was without a doubt one of the best grilled fish tacos I ve had in some time. Two Stars.   Star 5  Would you be excited to go back   Absolutely. Star.
Taco Joint,32,The tortillas here are super fresh and soft  I absolutely love them   The seared fish taco was my favorite as it was bursting with flavor and the slaw was absolutely perfect  I also really like the salsas here  especially the chipotle and the avocado. The vegan torta was pretty good  a great option for those who don t eat meat  I definitely recommend trying out Taco joint id you have not already  
Taco Joint,33,I came in with high expectations and they were fully met  Taco Joint is clearly an Austin favorite for a reason. Their breakfast tacos are to die for and it was incredibly fast  I will definitely be returning next time I m in Austin 
Taco Joint,34,I came here yesterday with some friends to round out a weekend in Austin  and am happy I did.  While the tacos weren t the best tacos I had in the city  they were very solid and they had a cool patio to sit on.  I ended up ordering the migas  the passeroto  and the chorizo and egg.  The passeroto and the chorizo and egg were both decent  the flour tortillas are so good here that all of the tacos had a decent floor  but the migas definitely stole the show.  I loved the crunchiness from the tortilla chips and the eggs were cooked nicely.  It was the perfectly complement to the flour tortillas.  The chorizo and egg was a little bland  and the pork in the passeroto was a little dry for me  but again  the flour tortillas make sure these tacos don t taste bad.  The salsas were mostly just ok  but my favorite was the habanero.  It had a nice sweetness to combat the heat.  All in all  come here and order whichever taco you want  just make sure it s on a flour tortilla.
Taco Joint,35,Nothing is bad here.   Get anything and you will love it.   Migas are best in city.   Salsas rival taco deli in flavor profile.   Overall  it s a great place for any meal. Breakfast to HH 
Taco Joint,36,Came here for both some breakfast and lunch tacos and I was impressed  We tried like 8 diff kinds between the two of us and it was so much food  My favorites were the migas  pastorito and 4 20...the Benedicto kinda reminded me of a California breakfast burrito. The portions were huge and prices great  Couldn t finish all are food so would definitely order less next time  but was fun to try to many kinds and all the types of salsa  too  We got some Jarritos and cold brew on the side. Nice environment with what seemed like a lot of locals sharing meals on the deck
Taco Joint,37,That s what I m talking about  After a disappointing experience at another nearby taco place  I figured I d give Austin tacos another shot. Got a steak benedicto and a potato egg and cheese. Wow. So incredibly good. Nice service  didn t take too long  helped to come in at 9am . Great salsas too. The pico style salsa is good and not too spicy. The green avocado crema salsa was mouth burning. And they gave extra hollandaise with the benedicto. Anyway  5 stars. I can see why this gets a line later in the morning. Worth it. Easy 5 stars  some of the best tacos I ve ever had.
Taco Joint,38,Bacon  egg and Gouda on flour with their chipotle salsa  YUM  This place has been consistently delicious for the 5 years I ve been coming  love it 
Taco Joint,39,I got the street tacos and my gf got the breakfast chorizo and taco  first time here from houston and the street tacos were amazing 10 10  the chorizo taco was mid  too much egg  7 10. tacos are very filling big 
Taco Joint,40,Nice little hole in the wall taco shop. I went late at night and they had the outdoor heaters going  felt amazing . Ended up ordering a strawberry marg  4.50     nachos  7.99   and 4 of their specialty tacos  3.99 each . Not exaggerating  the nachos alone could have fed 2 people.... not to say I didn t eat everything.  Food was delicious  seemed truly authentic  and pretty good prices for austin. Also didn t expect this place to have margs which was a huge plus. I will for sure be returning  
Taco Joint,41,This place hits the spot when you re craving tacos  There was a decent line when we arrived on a Sunday morning  but it wasn t at capacity. We were able to find a table easily enough after we ordered. I ordered the El Senor Crockett and the El 4 20. The Crockett was flavorful and had great spices. The El 4 20 was a bit dry for my liking  but points for the fun name. Staff was very friendly and the wait was standard to receive the food. I would return to try their big variety for whenever I have another taco craving 
Taco Joint,42,Delicious food  great vibe  awesome service. Everyone was super nice and food came out quick even when the place was packed 
Taco Joint,43,First taco  stop in Austin  Tacos were fire  sauces were great too but one star deducted because they took forever to come out  with not that many people you d expect it to come out within 10 minutes  it was more 25-30.  Hopefully next return the service will be faster  but it was still a soild taco spot   Migas taco was my fav 
Taco Joint,44,This San Antonian found Taco Joint right next to our hotel and gave it a shot for breakfast. If my tacos were indicative of what Austin has to offer in the taco game  there s no debate that the title does not belong to this city. We ordered a potato egg cheese  the 4 20  and a bean and cheese. The flour tortilla was thin  amp  crispy  possibly overdone in oil     my potatoes resembled the bagged tater tots  and the cheese was shredded but unmelted. Edible  yes. Quality tacos  no. But hey  it could have been a bad day for the kitchen    If you are hungry and in a pinch  this place would work but I feel like it would be a disservice to recommend it to anyone.
Taco Joint,45,taco joint is one of the best places for breakfast tacos in Austin   I always get potato bean cheese and egg or steak and Gouda and the street taco is amazing.
Taco Joint,46,Hubby and I ended up binge watching the Food Network one random night and we landed on  Tacos in Texas  good idea and bad idea. Bad idea because we needed tacos immediately  GOOD idea because Taco Joint is in our back yard    The location is weird ... ill admit  but its SO GOOD. I am picky with my tacos and want them to be home made  and fresh. This had all the check marks. Hubby and I got 4 different tacos and ate them all. They also have Mexican Cola which was perfect to wash these down with.  10 10 highly recommend.
Taco Joint,47,It pains me to give Taco Joint anything less than 5 stars. We have been eating at Taco Joint since 2012 back when they only had the San Jacinto location. In the last year the quality of their food has deteriorated so much.   The biggest disappointment was the tortillas. Taco Joint used to have the best  softest and biggest tortillas. Now they re small and every single tortilla in the 5 tacos we ordered had hard edges and uncooked spots. They are also smaller than before. We kind of had to tug on the tortilla to get the bite. So disappointing.   The street taco used to be our favorite too. Now the meat is different  even the cut. The quality of the meat is subpar at best. My taco had 4 pieces of fatty tissue some very big  it was gross.   I m so sad to be giving Taco Joint such a bad review and I really hope they can go back to their good quality because they really used to be the best  
Taco Joint,48,Awesome breakfast taco spot.  Come here hungry and you won t be disappointed   Everything I ve had on the menu has been great.
Taco Joint,49,Like many Austin gems  don t judge this book by it s cover. The home made tortillas and the excellent combinations of ingredients come together for a fabulous  taco joint . They re only open until 4 pm for a simple reason - they re that successful from morning  til mid afternoon. No need to stay open after that. Never waited in line for more than a few mins...and the food comes out pretty quick. Lots of regulars is always a good sign. Yes there s Veracruz and the ubiquitous Torchy s. But give  the joint  a try.
Taco Joint,50,Amazing    We travel from Florida just for these tacos    Sort of...   so so good. My husband and son love the street tacos. I love the shrimp. And the Wholly Mole. Don t give it a second thought. Get tacos here 
Taco Joint,51,Taco joint is a solid place if you re ever craving tacos  They make everything fresh and their creamy orange and green sauce are bomb  My favorite taco was the fried fish taco  but ever since I went vegan i only eat the portebello mushroom taco and el tree hugger--both are very good 
Taco Joint,52,Worth trying once if u live in austin. If visiting wouldn t recommend. Wouldn t take my GMA here if she was visiting. The taco tortilllas are all served cold. Go to Rositas for half the price   4 vs  2.50  and GMA hospitality .
Taco Joint,53,I got the migas taco without jalape os. This is the best breakfast taco I ve ever had. The homemade tortillas were delicious  My bf told me the steak taco is also incredible and he ll bring some home for me. I can t wait  
Taco Joint,54,Love this place so much   Food is always affordable and relatively quick service.  Ambiance  3 Had to knock off for lack of cleanliness but it s typical of what you d expect from casual restaurants like this. Pretty cramped and a bit loud when it gets busy.  There s some outdoor seating as well.  Food  5  I love LOVE LOVE the tacos here so much   I highly recommend you also try the chicken tortilla soup as well  Value    They fill it up with chicken and TONS of tortilla chips so every single bite is loaded with chicken  chips  and avocado. The tacos are made fresh and super cheap amp authentic. What else could you possibly want   Service  5 All in all  I would say that the service here is typically very quick and they are very helpful when it comes to whatever you need  you can take leftovers to-go  you just have to ask them for another bag for your leftovers .
Taco Joint,55,Hands down the best tacos ever.   Inviting exterior and hole in the wall interior. Who knew such a place can provide some of the tastiest tacos ever   Had tried four  each was bursting with flavour in its own way. Delicious and healthy tasting. No wonder  this place is so popular.  I can probably eat this every day.
Taco Joint,56,Probably one of the best pastor tacos I ve had   I highly recommend checking this place out 
Taco Joint,57,One of the cleanest taco restaurants I ve visited in Austin this far. Staff is extremely nice and attentive. I came here on a Tuesday of course ready to celebrate taco Tuesday after a long week and was blown away by the taste of their tacos. I had the chicken fajita taco with cilantro and pico added to it.  Street taco style and my taste buds are screaming thank you  I d make this my favorite taco shop in Austin.  Margaritas were nicely priced  And worth it
Taco Joint,58,5 stars for a cheap  solid  breakfast taco. The hot sauces were flavorful and just the right amount of spice.   I went with the Chorizo Egg and Potato Egg and I would do it again any day. Filled me up. Tasted great. Fast service. What else do ya need out of a fast breakfast taco 
Taco Joint,59,First time I came I wasn t a huge fan  and then I discovered the meatless breakfast tacos. You seriously can t go wrong  and a perfect option for vegetarians if you like eggs. The sauces are amazing too. All I need is one taco because it s huge  Also got the margs once and they re really fun  love the cool flavors. Also  we got takeout that time and turns out they had made too many margs so they just handed those extra ones to us -- talk about a fun time 
Taco Joint,60,This place is SO GOOD. Breakfast tacos all day and the staff here clearly work their asses off. Don t forget to TIP YOUR WAITSTAFF whether you re dining out or eating in. They deserve it 
Taco Joint,61,I loved el se or  crockett. I think if you are really hungry  you should buy two. I got the corn tortillas  as they are healthy. They give you a variety of sauces  I don t like spicy  and of course  I poured the cloudy green sauce  which was spicy  my own fault. Inside it s air conditioned  but chilly  Outside is too hot. The food and service was great 
Taco Joint,62,If I were still a college kid on a budget  I d be hitting up this taco joint all the time. The tacos are massive in size and they along with everything else on the menu is cheap. I had the migas and fish tacos. They were good  but I prefer street tacos than these Texas styled tacos. Their fish taco was pretty disappointing if you ve ever had fish tacos from California. We also ordered the fajita salad that came with a choice of chicken  and we may get it with another protein next time since the chicken was really dry. The chicken tortilla soup we had was pretty good. It came in a really pretty bowl too. Still something to check out if you re in the area. Come for the huge tacos and cheap eats 
Taco Joint,63,Yelp gave this a pretty high recommendation so I thought I would give it a try as I am a big fan of tacos. Decided to order a variety and tried four different tacos. Due to covid the salsa bar was closed so I decided to make it easier on the server and stick with the habanero salsa. Heat was pretty decent but flavor was lacking which is typical for this type of salsa so I ll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the salsa bar is good.  All four tacos were decent but nothing was particularly memorable. Saved the pastor for last because this is probably my favorite taco style. They add cheese which is a huge faux pas so I have no choice but to give a mediocre review especially considering none of the tacos were very memorable. Portion size is generous but at  4 each I would hope so. The tortillas are decent but they are also flour which is another unforgivable sin so all things considered a three star review seems more than generous.
Taco Joint,64,If you d like to pay too much for breakfast tacos you ve waited fifteen minutes to get  even ones without made to order eggs   if you d like to receive your food after people who came in behind you because they re a regular  if you d like to be forced to interrupt the whole queue of those waiting to order to ask about your online order which you can see dying at the pass for ten minutes  if you d like to pay for drinks you don t receive in your order which died in the window for ten minutes  then come put up with The Taco Joint   I m sure this place will thrive because it clearly has a loyal following  but if you aren t already an insider  be prepared to have a really lousy experience.
Taco Joint,65,Breakfast tacos were good. I had the chorizo and egg. However it was more egg than chorizo.
Taco Joint,66,These tacos are monsters  Seriously  they don t hold back on the fillings at all  and even though it s a single tortilla they don t fall apart  big plus    I got three tacos and a side of potatoes.  First  the potatoes are pure perfection. Pro tip  1. get their chipotle sauce  2. profit     Second  the tacos portions are big. It s almost like a medium-sized burrito  and they put a lot of protein in them.  I got the following  1. Wholly mol  - pulled chicken in mole sauce. Definitely the best one out of the three. 2. Fish taco  seared  - they put half a seared fish fillet inside  however  you might need to add some of their sauces for a little more  umpf  factor. 3. The Street Taco - definitely the underperforming one of the bunch. The flavor was there  however  the grilled sirloin was too chewy and not tender at all. I had to spit out a couple of the chunks because they were unchewable   
Taco Joint,67,bland tacos and small. i prefer torchys. best thing here was the Jarritos orange soda.
Taco Joint,68,Stopped by here before jumping onto a flight and let s take a minute to TACO ABOUT IT.   FOOD   I tried the potato and eggs taco  as well as the migas taco. Aiming for anymore than 2 tacos at this place would be ambitious because they are loaded  Both tacos are delicious and I was very full after eating them.    The salsa station has a variety of salsas you can accompany your tacos with - the habanero has as great kick to it.  - Largely in part we came here for the tortillas. They were good  but not THAT good. Definitely home made feel  but they were kind of hard.   LOCATION    Being a visitor to Austin  I didn t have much business in this side of town. Regardless  it was easy to get to.    The inside is kind of small and dark  but the outside has a large patio. There is plenty of parking on site.    It felt like a authentic taco joint. Prices were cheap too 
Taco Joint,69,Covid review   Taco joint is a long time favorite spot of mine - and covid is no different. Their quality and attention to taco-detail hasn t changed one bit   My favorites are the classic street taco and the 4 20    But here is what changed    1  line  the line typically was inside along the center wall. Now the line goes straight out the front door  and you exit to the right as you wait for your tacos    2  masks  required while ordering and inside   3  curbside pickup  pull up to the front left of the building  and you pull up to the railing. Sometimes there are so many cars you need to park  but not to worry   Just pull into a parking space and call in your car model and they will bring it right out.
Taco Joint,70,if there is guy running the place today it would explain why no on answers the phone  i can t place an order  your online site is just spinning    last time i had to drive all the way up there to find this punk with the phone off the hook because he was talking on his personal phone    someone needs to find a new employee 
Taco Joint,71,every taco I ate here was phenomenal and I had about 9 different variations over 3 days.  The place isn t particularly big but it has a nice outdoor space and the most important part they offer tacos that will cover all the bases even have flour and corn tortilla options. The secret menu is heavenly  I had a steak taco that tastes like what Chipotle only wishes it could be. Pair the tacos with one of the fruit margarita options and that a good breakfast  lunch or dinner option.  Definitely get here if you are in Austin
Taco Joint,72,Stayed at a hotel nearby and found this little spot. Food was delicious and the margarita was small  cheap  and strong. Just perfect.
Taco Joint,73,This place earned it. Had a street taco came with lots of sauces. Tortilla soup way too salty....and I m a salty gal. Great for a quick lunch. Solid Austin experience--including listening to the UT frat boys talk about their prior nights escapades--spicy 
Taco Joint,74,So we have ordered from Postmates here 3x.  The first two times I ordered no egg tacos and they gave us all egg tacos so my boyfriend ate my tacos. We ordered a third time and they finally looked at the notes or something and I didn t get egg. The tortilla was good and homemade but the taco itself was pretty bland. I added a ton of salsa verde which added spice but not a ton of flavor. My boyfriend really likes this place  but I am not a big fan
Taco Joint,75,Taco joint is normally good. I went in and got two tacos and a bowl for my dog. The dog bowl is awesome. My pup loves it. I ordered a soyrizo and potato taco and it was great.   I also ordered a barbacoa taco and it was hands down the nastiest taco I ve ever had in my life. It tasted old. The meat tasted really old and off. The meat has a lot of fat  I really don t think it was fresh. I would go back but I will never order the barbacoa taco again.
Taco Joint,76,ONE OF MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST TACO PLACE   I have been to over 30 taco restaurants and Taco Joint remains one of my top 3 favorite places to get breakfast tacos. The price is reasonable  flavor is tasty  portion size is great  and the sauces are so good  I have tried many of the breakfast and lunch tacos  but I like the migas and barbacoa tacos the most.
Taco Joint,77,This is actually my favorite low-key local taco joint in the city. I have had a hard time finding even a food truck that produces better tacos than here.  There are dressier chains like Velvet Taco that do a good job with high end offerings. There s bar restaurants like Turf N  Surf Po Boy at Lavaca St Bar that makes amazing fish tacos. There s restaurants like El Alma that makes amazing al pastor tacos.  But this place does everything well  if not the best - and the offerings are far plenty. And affordable. With a chill vibe indoors and a large patio outside to eat in sandals and even in pajamas  this place can easily do the trick for many without judgment. And healthy substitutions such as wheat tortillas can be had although they do have some already-healthy offerings in the menu as well.  Oh  and yes - my favorite migas tacos in town is here also - ask for it without the jalape o if you don t want it spicy.
Taco Joint,78,Really solid tacos - loved the Crockett and Street tacos while the seared fish was a bit of a miss  strong fish smell which didn t give me confidence      The reason I give it four stars is because I kept comparing it to Taco Deli - which it seems very similar to in terms of the menu and line  - but I think it comes up just short   The king has yet to be dethroned
Taco Joint,79,Absolutely love this place. Only had the breakfast options but was never disappointed.   Sausage  egg and cheese was my favorite.  Bacon  egg and cheese solid. Potato   egg and cheese was a close second.   The sauce selections were amazing as well. Each one adds a unique flavor to the burrito.
Taco Joint,80,This place is fucking amazing  Breakfast taco are always on point  I ve never had a bad breakfast taco here...EVER    Stop reading this and go. Just go. You won t regret it  
Taco Joint,81,There are so many taco options in Austin that it s sometimes hard to choose  but fear not if you choose Taco Joint because it is delicious  and affordable  When you scoot up on the place the first thing you ll notice is that they have a great outdoor patio in both sides of the restaurant - if there s space that s the best spot    I went with the El Senior Crocket and the Migas Taco and both were out of this world - two tacos were for sure enough for dinner. The El Senior was almost like a fajita with steak  onion and melty Gouda  while the Migas was a breakfast taco lover s dream complete with queso.   Don t sleep on the salsa bar tho - get a lil cup of each one so you can mix and match 
Taco Joint,82,It s lit. Portions are huge and tacos are tasty. Also service was super fast and they have easy parking. Nice patio deck outside to eat. No free water though
Taco Joint,83,Good but did not blow me away like I was expecting from the high reviews. I had two street tacos  they were good sized and it s nice they have avocado in them. Not the best taco I ve ever had but satisfactory. The margaritas sounded good but it s a pre-made slushy mix and they just add some juice or syrup if you order a flavored one  a bit too sweet but I m not really a margarita fan anyway. I probably wouldn t go out of my way to come back but if you re in the area and need a quick and relatively affordable lunch  you could do worse.
Taco Joint,84,Delicious Tacos   My boyfriend lives across the street and keeps raving about the tacos. Two Sundays ago we had a packed day and decided to get lunch at Taco joint. We both got 3 Tacos. I always love my Breakfast Tacos so I decided to get a Potato  Egg  and Cheese along with my favorite Al Pastor and Chicken Mole Taco. First off they WIN for their Amazing...AMAZING Salsa Bar. I applaud you. Secondly  their Tacos are packed.  I loved my Breakfast Taco. Chicken Mole was packed with Flavor. I was very disappointed with the Al Pastor. It tasted old. I was very sad.  A week later I was working a double and my amazing boyfriend asked if he could bring me Tacos 25 minutes away. He got me a Potato  Egg  and Cheese. And Bacon  Eggz and Cheese with Avocado. Ahhhmazing  I ll definitely keep going back. I m seriously in love with their Breakfast Tacos 
Taco Joint,85,Speed  fast as long as there isn t an insane line. This can definitely happen on nice weekend days so watch out for that   Food  reallly good and lots of unique tacos. Not my favorite spots in Austin but definitely still good and will be back with friends.   Sauces  superb. Almost all of them are spicy though so watch out. Interestingly enough  the sweet habanero one is one of the less spicy sauces   Dining area  mostly outdoors with a few indoor tables. Indoors tends to get really crowded and loud so I highly recommend sitting outside   Parking  not a problem unless you come during one of those nice summer weekends where it ll get packed
Taco Joint,86,Great tacos. Fresh tortillas and well seasoned potatoes. I just didn t like the American cheese on mine  I prefer cheddar. But that s a preference and they might have cheddar if you ask.
Taco Joint,87,Being only 5 mins away  I go here at least twice a week. Though service has gotten extremely slow in the past few months  everything else has been good. However  yesterday  I received the worst service ever. I ordered pickup and when I went to the restaurant and my name was called  I just grabbed the bag of food and left as I ve always done. Once I got home  I realized they gave me someone else s order. I called in to let them know the situation and the phone call was kind of weird  the person on the phone kept reiterating my order for some reason instead of letting me know how they d rectify the issue. I was finally told to come back and get my actual order. Once I got to the restaurant  the guy at the counter  his name was Genaro  literally threw the bag of food on the counter and waved me away. No apology  no thanks for coming back  nothing. Not sure how them giving me the wrong order was my fault  but that made me feel incredibly bad and annoyed.  And the icing on the cake  I got sick after eating the food that was my actual order  I order the same stuff all the time so that was strange.   I will NEVER ever eat from this place again. Maybe they should hire people who actually care about customers and not rude family members.
Taco Joint,88,Taco Joint was right across from our Airbnb in Austin and I couldn t wait to try it  We went on a Sunday morning and it was packed. We were still able to get through the line quickly and found a table outside.  Our tacos were delicious and I loved flour tortillas  The salas were way too spicy for my liking but were delicious for my husband. Would definitely recommend 
Taco Joint,89,The tacos are so good  but the service was not. We weren t greeted when we came in  i think the person at the register was named Carlos. my friend asked for 2 sour creams and only one was in the bag  so she politely told him and and he decided to argue with her and say she never asked for 2.... we all heard her. Also  they basically told us to leave since it was 7 40 and they close at 8. But other than that  great food 
Taco Joint,90,Solid tacos  what more can I say  I especially enjoyed my migas which was SUPER cheesy and the fried fish taco. They re tucked away on Riverside and I never really noticed them until the first time I picked up  but don t sleep on Taco Joint 
Taco Joint,91,The breakfast tacos were really good  The chipotle sauce is a must have with your taco  Def a spot to grab a taco when visiting 
Taco Joint,92,Probably the best tacos we ve had. Literally amazing  so much flavor  so inexpensive. My favorite was the Crockett one  but the 4 20 and the fish one were also great. Loved the chipotle sauce. Would 10 10 come here again for breakfast  lunch  or dinner.
Taco Joint,93,OCCASION  Saturday lunch  FOOD  5 5 DRINKS  NA ENVIRONMENT  5 5 SERVICE  4 5 PRICE  5 5 OVERALL  4.75 5  PROS  - Best fish tacos in Austin - Amazing salsa - For some reason... Really good French Fries - And everything is really cheap  - Bigger portions relative to Taco deli or Torchy s  CONS  - gets busy 11-1PM on weekends and 12-1PM on weekdays - if you visit during peak hours  you might not find a parking spot.   CONCLUSION  Just to give you Austinites a reference  I m a Taco Deli guy  I don t go to Torchy s for tacos...  and I thought this place had better tacos and salsas than Taco Deli. Especially their fried fish tacos with their Chipotle sauce is probably the best fish tacos I had in this city. I also love their postorito. It goes well with any sauce. For some reason their french fries are really tasty. Taco joint  French fries   queso are prob. Better than shake shack s cheese fries.
Taco Joint,94,When my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to eat on a Monday morning  I told him we could get whatever he wanted. In reality  I knew he d let me choose and that I d get to say Taco Joint because I ve been looking it up the whole night before. Now that I got to try it  I ve been dreaming about their tacos ever since.  We got the El Senor Crockett  El 420  Street Taco  El Porko  and the Migas Open Face Taco. My goodness.. they were all specTACOlar   There is a reason why El Senor Crockett s first on the menu. It s perfectly seasoned and we couldn t get enough of it. El 420 has an interesting twist with fries in it. Street Taco  with sirloin  and El Porko  with.. well  pork  were both great as well. The Migas Taco is also amazing  with fluffy eggs  peppers  jalape os  tomatoes  and cheese. All of the tacos were HUGE too  They also have a sauce bar and a wide variety of hot sauces for you to choose from.  We went in around 10 45 so there weren t many people there. The place is small and cutely decorated with Loteria pieces as their wall decor. The service was quick and friendly too  We made a great decision coming to Taco Joint for our last day in Austin and we can t wait to be back soon 
Taco Joint,95,Authentic tacos  great service  consistency. I ve been going to Taco Joint for years now  and have never been disappointed. Whether for take out or dining in  anything I ve ordered from their breakfast tacos to their regular tacos have been amazing. I highly recommend their migas tacos  One of the best in town  
Taco Joint,96,Holy sh t   Who is reviewing this place  I suspect it s college kids who are still drunk from the night before from what I just saw.   Chose this place from the good reviews on Yelp  pictures of the tacos looked great too. Welp   the eggs taste like they are liquid eggs with no flavor  chicken tortilla soup was even weirder. I really can t even put my finger on what the flavor was. The barbacoa was cold and tough. It may have even been carnitas. I couldn t tell either because it didn t taste or look like barbacoa. Never got to taste the chorizo since our order was wrong. I could ve complained but after tasting everything I took my L and ordered Con Madre from their patio so I could eat real tacos.   Giving them one star because I have to and because salsa was good.
Taco Joint,97,The soyrizo  some of the best I ve ever had. Smoky-a   flavor just settles into your tastebuds effortlessly. Ask for avocado on that thang  er  taco  I mean ... and celebrate it. Oh yeah  douse it in avocado salsa for extra spice factor. And rejoice. You re welcome.   If you drop by for lunch  do yourself a favor and order the chicken fajita salad. It is all sorts of epic  and massive. Pro tip  don t use the dressing it comes with it. Instead  baptize it in avocado salsa  like a mutha. It complements the chicken and crunchy tortilla strips perfectly. Wow  what an epic surprise. Seriously  one of the best salads I ve ever had. See pic. I ain t lyin . I m going back for another one.
Taco Joint,98,What was I doing having Chipotle when the real taco is right here in Austin  Frankly I had no idea taco could be so warm  a little crispy on the side thin  non-chewy  and just resilient enough to hold all the goodies this place pile on top of it. I don t think I could ever go back to anything less.  The place is quite worn down and doesn t look like much but the food is epic. The Street taco  Wholly Mole   Fish Taco Fried  and Pastorito are top four on our list and one should not have anything less than 4 tacos here.    There may be a line and even with no line you have to wait for the tacos as they are made to order fresh. A lady at the back grill was making the tacos fresh even in the evening and probably is the reason why tacos here are the best one we had tried.   Value wise  for such fresh and delicious food  I have to to give it a 5 star rating. Frankly many expensive restaurants cannot deliver the same explosive flavours as Twco Joints.   It is a self-serve joint so perhaps not so perfect for a date night.
Taco Joint,99,Best tacos we had in Austin. Go stop here for a taco or two. It was quick and easy during lunchtime.
Taco Joint,100,It s a pretty unassuming looking place on Riverside - I cant imagine I would have ventured in  but a friend wanted breakfast here so I obliged - and I am SO grateful that I did.   Fresh and flaky house made tacos make even the most basic tacos DELICIOUS  and the migas - on the hard shell was glorious.   Fresh flavours  good range of salsa options  plenty of easily distance-a-ble outside seating space. Win win win.   My only slight minus was the number of grackles - but it s Austin   my toddler LOVES them so they can stay 
Taco Joint,101,2nd time here and I live right down the street  had 3  flour tacos  scrambled egg with bacon  one with sausage  and my favorite one The shredded chicken with cabbage and mole sauceOMG that one is the best 
Taco Joint,102,This was the first place we went to in Austin.  It s a dive.  All the tacos were great  though.  They don t have traditional names  I had their version of Al Pastor and something called a migas  which was kind of like a mexican scramble on a tortilla.     Lots of sauces were available  just about all of them pretty hot.  I really liked them all.  Honestly  no complaints about the food  other than the guacamole was just okay - a bit bland.  Might have been the avacados that day...dunno.  I recommend it if you re in the neighborhood.  A great place to stop before exploring the SOCO area.
Taco Joint,103,Love taco joint    These tacos always hit the spot   Be sure to order ahead to avoid a long wait during busy times. Homemade tortillas hit different 
Taco Joint,104,Writing this to lyk you ROCK  amp  amp  whoever made the salsa this morning was ON POINT W  IT   Hottest and best salsa I ve had from here yet. Thanks for everything y all do--AMAZING
Taco Joint,105,This place is so good  I love that you can just grab your own salsa and load up the tacos. Super cheap too. Just check the location because one serves drinks and the other doesn t.
Taco Joint,106,DELICIOUS    We stopped here during our trip to Austin. We had three different tacos and they all were amazing   The best part was the multitude of sauces available. If we go back to Austin  this place will definitely be on our list to go to again  Highly recommend 
Taco Joint,107,BREAKFAST REVIEW  5 5 Taco Experience  I came to Austin  in part  because of the tacos and these were the best I had   We went around 10 30 AM on a Saturday morning to a line of maybe 10-15. Have no fear  The line moves pretty quickly and we only had to wait 5-10 minutes.  My friend who I was visiting is a regular here and he ordered for me. This was not a mistake. Here is what I got   Migas open face taco - This was my first time trying Migas  whichfrom my understanding is a tex-mex version of chilaquiles where you have eggs with veggies and tortilla chips cooked in it. A great breakfast taco to start  El senior Crockett - one of their special tacos with grilled onions and peppers and smokey gouda cheese. Not your typical steak taco but something really unique. The beef strips could have been a bit more tender but the flavor was all there.  Street Taco - classic steak taco...perfectly cooked steak  caramelized onions. It doesn t get better than this   All that was enough to fill me up  and I eat a lot .  Of course  I also had to get the Topo Chico to get the full Texas vibe.  Tips  - Sit outside if the weather is good...the vibes are great and maybe you ll get to pet a dog or two  - Don t skip the salsa bar...so many good salsas to put on your tacos.  Next time I am in Austin  I will 100  be back.
Taco Joint,108,If there was a salsa option God of Austin -- it d be the joint. I remember my first el 4 20 taco ... It was followed by two more in one sitting with some red and aguacate SAUHSS....   I MAY or MAY NOT have been the guy on the deck at lunchtime on a beautiful spring day using hand packets of salt and getting it everywhere so I could salt my Pacifico bottle.... I may or may not have had a couple more after that first one. They ll give you your lime in a plastic sandwich baggie.   Look bro  there is a culture requirement that you need to uphold when entering the joint  and that just means that every now and then  about twice a year  you gotta get schwifty in there.   I ve eaten a ton of their tacos  but the el 4 20 will forever be my favorite at the joint...
Taco Joint,109,Overall not bad  but not anything special. Pickup order was wrong but honestly that s all good  I like all tacos.  Migas was very good  shimp was too watery on a taco and fell apart with the veggies that weren t quite cooked long enough which made everything more slimy.  Tamale was good and HUGE    Overall middle of the pack  nothing set this place ahead of others.
Taco Joint,110,Taco joint is the closest restaurant to my work  which is a great relief. We used to cater from here pretty frequently for breakfast  which is perfect since their breakfast tacos are amongst the best in Austin. Chorizo sausage bacon and egg are all great  especially slathered with their avocado salsa.  Lunch tacos are good too  and they re pretty quick about it despite seemingly longer lines. My personal favorites are the street taco or either the grilled fried fish ones with the slightly sweet slaw. Two will fill you up alright. Or mix match a breakfast with a lunch taco for lunch on the cheap.
Taco Joint,111,The tacos are really good. There are dog water bowls and options just for dogs. We will be going back to this location.
Taco Joint,112,Best tacos I ve ever had  period  They absolutely load them up with meat  have quality ingredients  and even think about the little things such as wrapping the tacos in foil so they stay warm  plus they have dog bowls on the patio . Can t recommend higher. Fantastic spot for some of the best tacos  at a great value  in town. The Crockett is my go-to  amp  I ll never go back 
Taco Joint,113,This restaurant was right around the corner from my hotel and I was able to scooter to it with no issues. The atmosphere was amazing  although it was busy it was very speedy with ordering and getting your food. The service was amazing and once we sat down and ate we devoured our food. I will definitely come back to this place.   Don t miss out on the hidden menu which was on the wall right by the register. I ordered the shrimp tacos and a side of fries. The special sauces at the bar was also an added incentive that made the tacos taste really good as well.   You must visit this place if you are near.
Taco Joint,114,Hands down the best tacos in Austin  Don t go to the typical Torchy s and try this place instead  Can t pass up a HUGE breakfast taco for  3 
Taco Joint,115,It seems like I should have read my friends reviews before I ordered three breakfast tacos  These people make the biggest tacos EVER and they are amazing  I loved the fresh flour tortillas.  I m going to have to take a trip to Riverside again to try the lunch menu. The young lady at the register was very friendly  the parking was easy  and if I could change one thing it would be to identify the line for ordering. When I was there there were people standing randomly by the counter so I wasn t sure who had ordered and who had not. Just a little confusing but trust me y all  it s worth it.
Taco Joint,116,Taco Joint is awesome. Tacos  beer and more tacos. Life is good. What more can I add to 298 reviews and 4.5 stars.   Huge tacos with lots of protein. Lots of flavor. Options of sauces. More options of tacos and all good. Fresh tortillas. No Burritos.  This place rocks with delicious tacos. Steak  chicken  pork  breakfast  veggie tacos. Lots of options. Staff is friendly. Everything is fresh. Indoor seating as well as outside seating. Seems always busy. Check hours of operations. It varies. Many times I have walk over and forget they close early on certain days.  Tortas also huge and very tasty. Lots of flavor. Some are messy because it is stuff with stuff. Variety. All good.  Overall  Taco Joint is a very solid place for tacos and tortas. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Hole in the wall place  but it works. Cheap and tasty. CC friendly. Private parking lot.
Taco Joint,117,Great service. Had the steak benedictos. Really goodfoid  loved the atmosphere. Was within walking distance to Embassy hotel.
Taco Joint,118,During the time I visit this location a young lady helped us.   I ordered the tacos and the tortas tacos where great but when I asked to switch my tortas cause of how sweet it was she looked at me with disgrace after the one bite I took she said she wasn t able to refund or switch it out.    Very disappointing.
Taco Joint,119,We loved our experience at the Taco Joint  Everything was very clean and everyone was social distancing themselves. We ate our tacos outside. The street wasn t very busy so we were able to chat throughout our meal. Next time we are in Austin  we ll make sure to come back again 
Taco Joint,120,Been coming here for over 2 years   never had a problem food was always amazing . I ordered to go for the first time today   probably some of the worst tacos I ve ever had . They used this beef fajita meat for every single one of my tacos I ordered   which didn t make sense because none of the tacos I ordered came with fajita meat . Also ordered a shrimp taco which I ve had before and this time it was inedible . Waste of  45   the only thing they did get right was my doggie bowl for my pup. Probably won t be coming back to this place again . Extremely disappointed at the lack of quality and lack of standards of the food I was given .
Taco Joint,121,The spot is really good  came really quick to get a bite and man the bean cheese hit so good. The chipotle sauce with the fajita taco was amazing. Definitely recommend it here   the margarita was a little strong... and I like that.
Taco Joint,122,This little Taco Joint was located right across the street from the condo we rented in Austin  amp  we arrived from the airport starved so it was an easy call. All their tortillas are made in house  amp  those flour tortillas pack so much flavor and hold the taco together better than any I ve ever had before  so BRAVO Taco Joint   We each got the Street Tacos with beef  caramelized onions  avocado  cilantro and Queso Fresco. I also got the El Porko with pulled pork. Both my tacos were very tasty but my personal favorite was my husband s El Sen r Crocket with steak  amp  Gouda.   We made a return trip for breakfast tacos on Saturday morning along with half of Austin  The lines never stopped but they moved quickly. Loved the Steak  Egg  amp  Gouda and also my bacon  egg  amp  Monterey Jack breakfast tacos. My husband also raved about his Open Face Taco. Our plan was to not get hungry again on our connecting flights home  amp  2 breakfast tacos each did the trick   The salsa bar has so many options of toppings to enhance everything  I wish we had a Taco Joint in Pittsburgh   
Taco Joint,123,best fish tacos every time i have it here  food is consistently good and service is always great. the seared fish taco is by far my favorite taco ever. make sure to try their green sauce  it goes great with everything.
Taco Joint,124,Best tacos hands down  no contest. Top it off with the chipotle or avocado sauce and try the potato tacos for breakfast. Thank me later 
Taco Joint,125,Have you ever thought Taco Joint could get any better   FOOD   I get El Senor Crockett and Fried Fish - these are my go-to tacos at Taco Joint. I always knew this place had really good tacos as I go to UT Austin one often  so  I wasn t expecting anything  but just enjoying as usual. I was shook. I do believe the portion seems little larger than the one near UT Austin and tastes even greater. I m just too shook for that.  SERVICE   Nothing much for positivity. My order came out very fast and the sauce water has a self-bar.  ATMOSPHERE   I think it s pretty cool to be stand alone restaurant.   SURROUNDING  
Taco Joint,126,Great tacos and not super expensive  We got 5 tacos to try and it was only  18  We tried the open face migas  soyrizo and potato  fried fish  shrimp  and potato and avo  Loved the salsa bar  all the tacos were a great size. There is limited seating inside  but they do have a patio.
Taco Joint,127,Great flavors  portions  and overall presentation. This a must do fast food experience. And if you decide to dine in  the outdoor space is comfortable and well maintained.
Taco Joint,128,This place isn t messing around with breakfast tacos  The bacon egg and cheese on flour and the open face migas were my go to. The open face migas is something I ve never had before def different  and good  than other original migas at other taco shops. They also kill the salsa  sauce game. The salsa bar is free and you can try all of them. I liked the avocado and the chipotle sauce on my breakfast tacos  Tortillas are fresh also. Line gets long on the weekends so go early 
Taco Joint,129,I was in town for business and found my way to  this joint. for dinner one night. I figured it would be good because of reviews but WOW  This place was so good. Tacos are HUGE but so cheap and taste amazing  I ordered 3 because I thought they d be smaller but one would have been enough  I also loved the animals in sombrero pictures on the wall    Can t wait until I make it back to Austin so I can go here again 
Taco Joint,130,Wow  This place was FANTASTIC   The tacos are the best tacos I ve had and the service is suburb  Make sure to try the tamales  It will certainly not disappoint  Also  they even made a dog bowl for my pup that was massive for  4  It looked so good  I wanted some  
Taco Joint,131,This was the first stop after arriving in Austin. I was famished since I had a morning flight and landed in the late afternoon. My stomach had eyes only for tacos at this point. I ordered El 4 20 and a Street Taco.  El 4 20 - Carnitas tacos sprinkled with thin shoestring french fries. The meat was flavorful but this taco as a whole didn t  wow  me. Not bad  though.  To be honest  this review is mainly for the Street Taco because I ordered one and got a second one after finishing the first. This grilled sirloin taco includes grilled onions  avocados  and queso fresco. Every bite was a beautiful  juicy explosion of flavor. I couldn t recommend this one enough.   Don t forget to grab some of the salsas for your tacos. Their avocado and their chipotle salsas were my favorite.
Taco Joint,132,Some delicious eats during our trip to Austin  The Wholly Mole taco was a highlight but the whole meal was phenomenal. Loved sampling the different salsa options  all so tasty  and the homemade flour tortillas did not disappoint. The staff was friendly and helpful too  Highly recommend
Taco Joint,133,Our favorite tacos in Austin. Period. I always grumble when we have to eat almost any other tacos. I have never said  no  to Taco Joint tacos.   1. They make their own tortillas. This is key for me. It raises the quality of the taco.  2. Their potatoes  breakfast taco  are amazing. Perfection. Papas bravos for those who know. Breaded and fried and seasoned. And always cooked through. Uncooked potatoes cruchy potatoes or soupy mashed potatoes  I m looking at you  TacoDeli  are typically the downfall of other taqueria s potatoes.  3. Their salsas. Fresh. Spicy  but not too spicy. I didn t know their offical names until I ordered online during the COVID crisis.  P BUt I knew them by sight. The chipotle  the avocado  and the roja are my top three. They make everything taste delicious  even though the tacos themselves already shine.  4. They haven t gotten too big for their britches. There are two locations. Both have maintained  hole in the wall  or slightly above status. No franchises in Houston or Dallas.  5. Reasonably priced. Breakfast tacos under  3.   Now I m hungry.
Taco Joint,134,The best migas breakfast taco ever     The bad thing about this place is that they take a while to make your order in the morning since so many people come for breakfast but I think it s worth the wait. Again  best migas ever.  Their lunch tacos are good but breakfast ones are better. I did try the shrimp tacos and their shrimp isn t fresh. Go for beef or chicken tacos for lunch instead.
Taco Joint,135,I was coming to Austin for one night so I asked my friend who lives in the area where a good place to get tacos is. She suggested Taco Joint and I m so happy she did   First of all  the tacos are so big. Completely worth the  4 average for their tacos. Everything was very flavorful and fresh. The tortillas tasted homemade and were honestly probably my favorite part of the tacos.   I had both the street taco and a grilled shrimp taco. While both were outstanding  my favorite had to be the street taco  The street taco consisted of steak  caramelized onion  avocado  cilantro   amp  quest fresco. The grilled shrimp taco had a bunchhhhh of mini shrimp along with onions  amp  bell peppers.   They had five different salsas to choose from as well as some bottled hot sauces. I also had a pineapple jarrito to drink. About  21 for two people if you have 2 tacos and a drink.  I really like the loter a inspired paintings on the wall too. The pictures of various animals wearing sombreros was pretty cute too   I definitely plan on coming back here when I m in Austin again 
Taco Joint,136,This place is the best breakfast tacos I ve found in Austin   I regular this pace about once a week and I have never been disappointed. I always get the bacon and egg breakfast taco with jack cheese and red salsa and I always add pico de gallo. It is fantastic always  Great service as well all the staff is always friendly and efficient  I will keep coming back this place is incredible 
Taco Joint,137,A disappointing drive to a permanently closed Kesos Taco House on S. Congress lead us to this place. Trying for the first time  I had the Portobello Tacos and Migas. My favorite part being able to have a beer and or magarita with you work meal. The Magarita was nicely sweet  not sour. The amount was perfect for a work lunch. The flour tortilla was thick and homemade and I love a taco joint that serves the habenero and jalapenso creme sauce. The Migas was large  cheesy  hot and fresh. The Portbobello Taco with grilled onions was saucy in a sweet salty sauce but lacked another ingredient. Although saucy and cheesy  both needed their sauces to bring it together.  With a couple of taco places closing down  it sure is a good time for Taco Joint to have their grand opening. So far so good as to having it by our new go-to  Taco Joint . Will definitely be back to confirm it. I was told their Street Taco gets a lot of praise.   Tip to Taco Joint  Can you panko fry the Portobello Tacos   I think that would be a great added dimension. Shake Shake has an  addicting Portobello Burger using this technique.
Taco Joint,138,Tacos are solid here but I think in comparison to some of its neighboring taco competitors it falls short slightly in flavor and also salsa. The salsa wasn t as tasty and I think they overwhelm their tacos with cabbage so it sort of overtakes the overall flavor and doesn t let the other ingredients shine as much. I ordered the shrimp and seared fish taco and my husband had the chorizo and sausage breakfast tacos. Tacos also took a little longer to come out. However I do like that they have both a proper indoors and outdoors sitting area and the cashier was very polite  Thank you 
Taco Joint,139,Amazing taco place. Love the laundry list of offerings and combinations the menu offers to you  all for a cheap price. Also a big fan of the vats of serve-yourself style sauces and salsas at your disposal. The indoor outdoor seating option is also a GOOOOO.  Go here.
Taco Joint,140,Amazing breakfast tacos  easy to grab some and hit zilker park   Definitely get the chorizo with the habanero sauce.
Taco Joint,141,We decided to give this place a try because of all the good reviews on Yelp. What a disappointment  We ordered 6 different tacos since it was our first time here and none of them were worth it. The shrimp in the shrimp taco had not been de-veined. The street taco had flavorless beef. The pastorito taco had pork that tasted old and dry. Nothing about the food is worth the trip to this place. Felt like a waste of money coming here considering there are better options all over.
Taco Joint,142,One of my favorite taco places in town    I always take out of town visitors here  My brother and sister-in-law loved this spot too  Whenever they visit from San Antonio this is where they wanna go for lunch  Great spot for meat eater AND VEGANS   House made salsa that s delicious   They also have a  dog dish  that s rice and with meat  Patio has dog leash hookups at all the tables   and dog water bowls available 
Taco Joint,143,I order the fan favorite the street taco  fish taco fried  and the queso. The tacos were very plan not much flavor. The chips that came with my queso were over cooked so they were hard to eat. PROB NOT THEIR BEST DAY.
Taco Joint,144,Don t get me wrong  the tacos are pretty solid here  but the tortas and carnitas hash are where it s at.   Tortas are essentially mexican sandwiches with warm  fluffly bread and marinated  juicy meat and other toppings inside  served with plaintain chips. I ve tried all of the tortas  and while all of them are very good  the best ones are the ones that have marinated pulled pork since it s consistently flavorful and juicy  such as the Ahogada and the Sloppy Jose. The ones made with beef milanesa are also very good but they are a bit harder to eat since the sear beef can be a bit hard to cut.  Meanwhile  the Carnitas Hash offered on weekends is much like any brunch hash in its ingredients  but uses the same marinated  juicy pork used on the tortas so it s amazing.   I ve also tried most of the lunch tacos and the breakfast tacos - breakfast tacos are simple and good  and work particularly well with the fresh salsas offered  while the lunch tacos have more complex flavors with juicy interiors and varied toppings. They have several types of salsas here like most mexican restaurants  but the ones that stand out to me are the smoky chipotle cream  the green avocado salsa  and the classic mild red fresh salsa.  This place is pretty casual with a nice covered outdoor area which is dog friendly. Service isn t always the fastest  but it s always friendly and the food is amazing.
Taco Joint,145,I love tacos and this place knows how to make them  We had the Street Sirloin  Potato  and Shrimp tacos. All were fantastic and flavorful. Their salsas are delicious too. If you are a taco lover fanatic  you must try this place.
Taco Joint,146,Man  don t sleep on this place if you re in town  it s super legit.   They specialize in the breakfast taco but have a bunch of other things. I actually just got a plain chorizo taco and I was flat out humbled by the flavor  not just the meat but the hand-made flour tortilla  wow.    I was reading about them in the review and wondering how good could they really be  Well  THAT good. But then what set it off was their salsa. Full disclosure  I mixed up the chipotle from the habanero salsa and  er  had to do a little adjustment due to my user error on the quantity of each but was so thankful in the end because they were both so flavorful.   Love this place  can t wait to head back   Saminda
Taco Joint,147,Super cool vibe- there s indoor and outdoor seating. They have a ton of different tacos to choose from on the menu and tons of drink options too. I got a few tacos 1- the street taco which the mean was super yummy and tender and pack with so much flavor yum and then 2- I got the el porko which was really dry but it had cilantro and quest fresco which helped it out. The main reason I only have them 3 stars was because the tortillas were super hard and crunchy and they were supposed to be  soft tacos . For my street taco it literally broke in half down the middle because the tortilla had been overly cooked. It wasn t just my tacos it was also my friends tacos... it was just so hard to eat our tacos because it felt as if you had to chew that tortilla forever. So next time I do go I will ask them to not cook my tortillas and leave them soft. The tortillas being hard and un-eatable made it really hard to enjoy our food sadly   
Taco Joint,148,This place never disappoints    The service is so fast and the tacos are heaven. I love this location because of the outdoor seating. The best place for breakfast tacos hands down. Wish they had more homemade coffee or juice drinks  that s all. Maybe hibiscus water or horchata or lattes  
Taco Joint,149,My FAVORITE place to get tacos in Austin.   - They have parking  - They have choices  lots of tacos  plus corn wheat flour tortillas  - Amazing salsa - AMAZING flavors - Fun tropical margarita options for my marg-loving-friends  guava  mango  passionfruit  etc   - Nice outdoor patio area for those perfect fall weather days - Some of the best tortillas in town  especially flour  - Good non taco options  sandwiches  burritos  breakfast specials  - Reasonably priced  Bonus  The  street  taco  beef  with flour tortilla is a MUST try and definitely one of my favorite things on the menu.
Taco Joint,150,My favorite Saturday morning spot for tacos  Dog friendly and is usually pretty suite around 9am.
Taco Joint,151,Whether its brunch  a snack  or any other meal  you really can t go wrong with tacos  Taco Joint is a solid spot to grab flavorful and delicious tacos.  There are plenty of choices here  whether its breakfast tacos or regular tacos. The fried fish one is a great choice  There s seating on both the inside and outside. There s some parking around but it usually fills up pretty fast so you see cars circling around to find someone who s leaving. The tacos are pricey but the amount of food inside is decent. They have multiple types of sauces near the front so take your pic  Overall its a solid taco place with good flavor.
Taco Joint,152,I was between a torta and the Wholly mole taco and chose the taco which was AMAZING  Tastes more authentic than Torchy s Tacos.   You can eat inside or outside.
Taco Joint,153,Tacos are always delish but if you sit outside beware of the grackles  They are relentless   Tacos you have to try  1. bean  potato  cheese 2. Street taco
Taco Joint,154,Truly one of the best taco places. Very authentic. I had the street taco  and it was delicious. I also had the Barbacoa taco. It was just barbacoa wrapped in a tortilla with a side of pico de Gallo  so pretty basic  but yet so delicious. The meat wasn t dry at all and was very flavorful. We weren t sure what kind of salsa to get  but the cashier was happy to provide a variety of salsas. Perfect place to go if you want good tacos.
Taco Joint,155,Best tacos I have had in a long time  A friend  amp  I shared 4 different ones and weren t sure which was our favorite. They were all outstanding  The shrimp one as well as the mushroom one stood out the most for us. I can t wait to go back to Austin. I will be making a stop here.
Taco Joint,156,Long time lover of taco joint but it has severely gone down hill in the last two years. Food isn t quality  employees are rude  parking is hard to come by. They left a taco off of my order and when I went to tell them  the person working the register rudely said that the taco wasn t on the order  I had been waiting 30 minutes for my order at this point . I explained that I DID order the taco. Cashier said no I didn t. Made me pay for the taco and wait an additional 15 minutes for it. Won t be giving this place another chance.
Taco Joint,157,Awesome vegan vegetarian options for tacos and everything was delicious  Even on a busy Sunday  my food came out pretty quickly. They have a couple of nice areas for sitting outside. Would definitely recommend 
Taco Joint,158,Delicious breakfast tacos  Huge servings for price as well - my boyfriend and I got one each and we were both full   I had the Migas breakfast taco   avocado and my boyfriend had chorizo  egg and cheese. The sauces are great too  Seasoned well  egg cooked well. Couldn t fault it 
Taco Joint,159,Best Migas Tacos  in my opinion  After making that decision  I Taco-toured all over the surrounding area. I cannot wait to come back to Austin to have Taco Joint s Migas tacos 
Taco Joint,160,What a great place to stop at  The tacos were delicious and the staff was very friendly. We had the street taco  a breakfast taco  and a barbacoa taco and all were so fresh and tasty. There are lots of sauces as options. Very cool atmosphere with space to eat inside and lots of places to sit outside too. It was a nice stop while we walked on the Lady Bird river trail. We will definitely stop by again 
Taco Joint,161,We had just gotten to Austin and jumped on yelp to find the nearest taco shop. With lots of great reviews  we stopped at taco joint. Though it was raining  they still offered dine in option on the patio which we chose. The margarita was good  a little on the sweeter side in my opinion but I would order again. The street taco was fine  but I expected more from the fish taco. The portion was huge but I felt like the fish was bland. I d recommend this place to friends but definitely not the fish taco
Taco Joint,162,Great find  nice outside area and food was delicious and well priced. Everything was good  minus the fried fish taco but besides that...man. Seriously  forget Torchy Tacos come here  a thousand times better.
Taco Joint,163,This place has the best flour tortillas  I love their bean and cheese breakfast taco and all their pork tacos are worth writing home about. I love the fresh limes out by the water too. I only give them 4 stars because they re not open for dinner  found out the hard way  some days during the week. We will definitely make it a point to go here when we re in town 
Taco Joint,164,What a glorious place for tacos in Austin  absolutely my  1 place to go  Here are some of the pros of this place  - Parking lot  - Great choices of tacos plus other foods - Salsa compliment each taco very well - These tacos are stuffed  and stuffed I mean REALLY stuffed - Outdoor and indoor seating  Go enjoy the weather  - Fresh ingredients and food that keep churning out their shop everyday  So  there are no cons  which is pretty good  I have nothing bad to say about it.  Favorite choices for tacos  Pastorito  El 4 20  and Fish Taco Fried  I always get two fried fish tacos cause they re definitely the best   Tastes just like the one near the engineering buildngs at UT  super awesome place 
Taco Joint,165,Hell must have frozen over because I think I just found the best tacos...in Austin   As a San Antonian  I can neither confirm nor deny that this place may be giving the river city a run for its money.   But  it is quite possibly delicious.   First off  those tortillas are made by abuelita herself. She is in the back mixing and rolling that dough. I can taste it in the freshness. Great selection of salsas. I made a cocktail of avocado  habanero  and green. The tacos were flavorful on their own. I highly recommend the street taco. The queso fresco was so fresco  I think I saw a cow in the back making it herself.
Taco Joint,166,It s so good that I hit it twice in span of 10 mins. I checked in at the Embassy hotel close by and was going to meet
Taco Joint,167,Love it.  Go to  place when in town.  The chipotle salsa is greatness    Many different good tacos.  Bean and cheese is standout  pastor too 
Taco Joint,168,Absolutely delicious homemade awesomeness here  We had street tacos  el porko taco and tortilla soup and wish we had room for seconds. The flour tortillas are fresh and soft  meat is perfectly seasoned and I could drink the soup from a mug it s so satisfying. Will definitely be back 
Taco Joint,169,Tacos good waiting timeOmg the wait is ridiculous   We were told it d be like 20 minutes  we waiting very close to an hour  for 4 tacos  . It was packed I get it  but it s not like they re steaks.  If you are pressed on time   or impatient Run for your life.   In the other hand  the tacos are fantastic
Taco Joint,170,Read the reviews and was looking forward to sharing in some tasty breakfast tacos today.  The place was packed with people waiting for a fast bite.  We ordered three tacos...bacon and egg  chorizo and egg and sausage and egg.  That was about it as far as the ingredients.  No extra toppings just salsas.  Ehh     Was not impressed.  The chorizo had no flavor whatsoever-maybe we ordered wrong     Place was not very clean as far as the tables and the floors.  Tacos were not that good.  I had to make a bathroom  .  I was not hungover so I guess that s the difference.
Taco Joint,171,This spot is a must if your in Austin  There tacos are so yummy and filling   Had to go two days in a row while visit Austin   I will be back 
Taco Joint,172,When in Austin  we had to find a breakfast taco place. Found Taco joint which is located near downtown. Overall tacos were solid but the potatoes were the kind you buy frozen in the grocery store. The tortillas were tasty and handmade. Each taco had at least 2 eggs so these are filling. The salsa bar was spiced just right and with 4 options. If they had used fresh fried potatoes not frozen I would ve gave them 4 stars.
Taco Joint,173,Pro  Best tacos I ve ever had in my life. Con  All other future tacos have been ruined for me.   I came to Taco Joint on a friend s recommendation. When I arrived  I wasn t expecting too much because honestly the restaurant did not look too impressive to me. I got the El 4 20  steak carnitas with shoestring papitas  and the Street Taco  grilled sirloin  carmelized onion  avocado  cilantro  which was huge and very generous in the amount of meat included. I took a bite of each and my world was changed. First off  the meat in all tacos was incredibly juicy and flavorful. In the El 4 20 I was slightly skeptical of the papitas  which basically looked like mini-fries to me...but it was delicious...it just worked. I slathered both of my tacos in the various sauces they offer. The chipotle sauce was the standout for me -- it had a bold flavor with sweet undertones. The flour tortillas had an amazing homemade quality and taste to them. -- much chewier than store-bought tortillas. The Street Taco is a classic and the flavors of the ingredients all melded together to form the best. taco. ever.   I usually try to avoid using superlatives in my reviews and remain objective  but Taco Joint really deserves the praise. Unfortunately  I was only visiting in town so this is not a local spot for me but if I ever come back you can definitely bet to find me at Taco Joint.
Taco Joint,174,Great authentic atmosphere  amp  food. The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious. I devoured my breakfast taco  They have a great affordable menu with 5  mimosas. I will definitely be coming back
Taco Joint,175,I have been coming to Taco Joint for 5 years now  it was my go to in college and even after I still find myself coming back. The. Chipotle. Sauce. You have to go  no one does sauces better than TJ.
Taco Joint,176,I got the Street Tacos and they did NOT disappoint  They re actually decent sized tacos. I got two but had to take one to go. The tortilla tasted like it was homemade. They have a bar of different sauces but the tacos didn t even need it  Apparently they re also dog friendly because there were several wagging tails there today. Looking forward to trying other menu items 
Taco Joint,177,I don t know where to begin. I m an Austin original  so my palate for breakfast tacos is vast. I ve had your basics - taco deli  taco shack  Joes  the list goes on. My first experience with taco joint was in college. This place was a CLASSIC for every student. The tortillas are superb and the inner makings of the taco are heavenly. The chefs cook the eggs  cheese  bacon  whatever you are getting  all together versus placing incidents inside the tortilla. My point being  taco joint is the best breakfast taco in Austin.
Taco Joint,178,Fish taco was really good. I usually dont like fish. But i loved it here  Nice parking place and patio.
Taco Joint,179,Was heading to another place and after walking in and them wanting our phone number and email address we left.  Was craving tacos and this little place popped up online  wow so glad we came. It was amazing    
Taco Joint,180,Wow  Best tacos I ve had in a very long time  I got the Steak  amp  Egg with Smoked Gouda Taco and the Benedicto Taco with steak. Both were delicious and the homemade flour tortillas were absolutely perfect   Highly recommend this place 
Taco Joint,181,The beef fajita taco was amazing but the star dish here is the grilled fish taco with lime slaw.  Wow the best fish taco I have had in a very long time. Don t bother with the chicken when there s the fish taco to be had.
Taco Joint,182,First came here on a whim and I can easily say these are one of the best tacos in Austin. Prices are a bit steep  but it is worth it. There s a variety of sauces available at a self-service salsa bar to choose from. I liked every sauce  and enjoyed the typical variety of sauces. I ve had most of the lunch tacos on the menu and the barbacoa taco and haven t had a problem with my order once  other than dry meat which can come with the territory of pulled pork and barbacoa. The taste more or less made up for those  but I tend to avoid these tacos anyway for that reason.  Everything else was great. I m a huge fan of al pastor tacos  and they do a decent job here  so that s my go-to. The tacos are big with a big price tag  but they re matched together with big flavor.  Great counter-serve tacos.
Taco Joint,183,It s a smaller taco joint then most places but man it packs a punch   Had vegan options as well which is great since I came with my sister so she got the Vegan torta which was huge. They also sell breakfast tacos all day no extra charge and these tacos were delicious and were out real quick
Taco Joint,184,2 tacos and a soda for lunch hit the spot. The food was really good. I had two and a colleague had two - all different. We both agreed the food was good. Quick and easy. Definitely beats all the chain places.
Taco Joint,185,Great food  We always get the tortilla soup  has pork grimes and fresh avocado. Definitely a try.
Taco Joint,186,Damn good breakfast tacos. Homemade flour tortillas that taste like my abuela s from when I was a kid. Just really simple  homemade food that packs a lot of punch.   Tacos range from  2- 2.75 depending on your fillings. New favorite taco spot in Austin. Just brings a lot of nostalgia of how my abuela used to cook for us growing up. I only needed to order one since these tacos are much larger than your average breakfast taco. The salsa here has so much flavor so make sure to not forget it on your taco.
Taco Joint,187,omg      this is the best taco spot in austin. excellent customsr service. so kind. they are literally the best raco spot in texas.
Taco Joint,188,Wow  fantastic quick service and OMG the seared fish tacos were amazing. My wife had the Migas taco and raves about it.  Yelp nailed this one.
Taco Joint,189,Arrived in Austin  looked for a taco breakfast joint  and this Taco Joint delivered well above my expectations. Everything about the tacos I had were good and the sauce bar is fantastic. Would definitely come back  next time I m in Austin.
Taco Joint,190,Fabulous food on the outdoor porch. We got 5 tacos - the Crockett  steak and cheese  was fabulous. We were very impressed with the sanitation in the open kitchen - they take the virus seriously here. A great experience 
Taco Joint,191,We stopped by on our way up to Waco we just wanted try a new place in Austin with breakfast tacos.  The only taco I wouldn t order again cause it s not worth the cost is the bean and cheese. It was a small portion given to size of tortilla. The tortillas were okay. The other two tacos we got were amazing see photos. They have a big patio outside that is dog friendly and a dog menu    I would come back because dog friendly and pretty good tacos.
Taco Joint,192,Love breakfast tacos. Came here Sat AM with some friends while we were in town for the weekend. The line was not too long and it moved pretty quickly. It s a cute little place with a good amount of parking.  The menu has a wide variety of options - I went with spinach and egg white  my vain attempt to be healthy  and steak gouda eggs.  The tacos came out pretty quickly - we were able to find a seat for 4 by the time we had ordered and gotten our drinks. I also got a few of their dipping sauces - green chile  habanero  and avocado.  All of them were really good and went with both tacos well  note - they call the numbers up front so if you re sitting in the back  you probably won t hear them .  Overall a pretty good  cheap place. Worth stopping by if you re looking for some tasty breakfast tacos.
Taco Joint,193,3  amp  1 2..Very good breakfast tacos  of which there is no shortage of in Austin.  While it may not rank as one of the best taco purveyors in town  the place distinguishes itself by the fact that these tacos are larger  even by local standards  to the point of being just short of unwieldy.  This being the case 2 are definitely enough to fill a reasonable person up.   IMO.  They offer the creamy green avocado salsa  which is alway a must when it is offered  as well as   Migas was A-ok  in terms of chip to salsa ratio. I also sampled one non-breakfast option  the barbacoa which was likewise quite solid and likewise bordering on football-sized.  Setting is quite formal by Austin standards  which is to say its an actual brick and mortar locations with indoor bathrooms as opposed to a trailer parked in a lot of some kind.
Taco Joint,194,Lovely taco place. Fresh ingredients and well seasoned. The beef in street taco could be a bit more tender but it tastes good as it is too. Salad is super fresh and yummy and come in a big portion. Friendly staffs.
Taco Joint,195,The tacos were good and we would go out of our way to eat there again.  The chicken and beef fajita tacos were a little greasy  but the seared fish and street tacos were amazing.  Main reason for five stars is the service.  We had a large group and the employees went out of their way to make sure our order and service was good.
Taco Joint,196,Six stars for the homemade tortillas alone. We had two breakfast tacos with smoked Gouda which were excellent. For me the real standout was the fried fish taco as it had a lime-honey slaw that was unforgettable. They also used epazote vs just a basic cilantro and the slight mint notes were an excellent addition. Warm and welcoming folks behind the counter too 
Taco Joint,197,Literally the best migas breakfast taco in Austin    Regret that it has taken me so long to try this place 
Taco Joint,198,Warning - you might be overwhelmed by the number of tacos offered at Taco Joint  If you re indecisive like me  check out the menu before hand and come prepared.   I was in the mood for breakfast tacos  so fortunately my options were already narrowed down. The potato  egg and cheddar is a definite must. It s simple  delicious and pairs perfectly with their creamy chipotle sauce. The El Gringo egg white taco was on the healthier side  but lacked a little flavor. I should have taken better advantage of their awesome sauce   salsa bar  but I was starving and couldn t resist digging in.   Restaurant is very casual with an awesome outdoor patio that s very dog friendly. Place gets packed on weekends  so be prepared for a little bit of a wait during peak hours.
Taco Joint,199,Taco Joint  where have you been all my life  You are amazing and I must see you again. Your tacos overflow with fluffy eggy greatness and your sweet habanero sauce leaves my mouth burning for more  What are you doing for lunch today and breakfast tomorrow 
Taco Joint,200,Most amazing tacos  The street tacos are to die for  And the salsa bar is killer as well  Zero complaints  Would go a miLliok moRe times
Taco Joint,201,Great tacos  got the street taco and the pastorito  Salsas were on point and delicious  These guys were so nice we walked in at 7 55pm not knowing they close at 8 and they were very nice about it  yes we were those ppl...don t be us...  eat here...it is great 
Taco Joint,202,Best breakfast tacos HANDS DOWN. I didn t really eat a lot of breakfast tacos before moving to Texas but I ve been trying a bunch of spots and this place is a real stand out.
Taco Joint,203,I wish they would open a place closer to me. This is my new taco joint   A new place opened by a family from the valley  their third in Austin. This place has legit tortillas.   We tried 3 different tacos plus the chips and salsa. First if you can t make decent salsa  nothing else will matter. Salsa is good with a bit of a bite but definitively not hot.  Homemade flour tortillas were the best I think I ve had in Austin. The chips seemed to be fried versions of these tasty flour bites. Mmmm  good job.  The  Street Taco  is one of the best we ve had locally. It easily works well with it s great beef  fresco  avocado on that glorious tortilla.  The  Wholly Mole  was completely stuffed with chicken that if you didn t know it  would not have guessed it was chicken because it is loaded with flavor.  The seared fish taco on corn was good if not a standout as the other two. Really good fish and slaw but the corn tortilla failed to hold up to it completely.   Salsa bar with various goodness from green to avocado to habanero. Jes  I will be back...simple place with good outdoor seating. Great staff. This makes for a perfect combo of good  humble  homemade comfort.
Taco Joint,204,I have a friend that regularly comes here about three times a week and once came here three times in one day. That should say something. I guess that would indicate that he s a stoner but what I m trying to get at is that the food here is damn good  and very reasonably priced.  The migas taco is the best I ve ever had. I don t know how they make their flour tortillas and chips but they taste like they re fried in crack cocaine because they re so addicting. Some of the other menu items I ve had that were delicious were  a  6 giant plate of hash  a chicken tamale that was looked like it ate another tamale and doubled its size  and a portabella fajita taco that made me consider going vegetarian. Ooh  and the horchata is delicious.  Also super dog-friendly. I ordered a pup bowl for my dog which she mopped up with her face in about two minutes. So there s a little something for everyone here.
Taco Joint,205,AMAZING. LEGIT. Best taco I have ever had. Doesn t look like much  but it s the best taco spot.
Taco Joint,206,Was excited to see a new taco place opening up in the old Sonic space.  Stopped by for the breakfast tacos and was presently surprised.  The Migas taco are as good as everyone states  I was disappointed in the limited hours  and poorly designed interior.  The cash registers are butted up next to the pickup window.  Also  the drink station is situated right next to the pickup area so everyone is in each other s way while waiting for their orders and getting beverages.  There is tons of wasted space on the other end where the salsa bar is set up  which would make more sense for the beverage station.  I can imagine during rush times it can be a mess trying to order.  Overall a good experience and excellent tacos.
Taco Joint,207,Taco was ok  tortilla was burnt which was fine but very hole-y  The tortilla didn t wrap around the ingredients  Normally people wouldn t complain because it was an abundance of potato  egg  amp  cheese but I kept hearing about their tortillas and the hype was a disappointment. Cheese tasted like  government cheese  and I didn t personally like the  hash browns  - maybe this place just isn t for me.
Taco Joint,208,For less than  3 for a gigantic and filling taco  I will always have a lasting memory of my enjoyable experience here in Austin.   It was probably the most satisfying filling taco I ve ever had. I liked it so much I continued to want to come back every single morning for tacos during my Austin trip.  2-3 tacos per person is more than enough.   They are generous with the filling  and the outdoor seating is very clean and pleasant for a casual meal.  I tried six different tacos and was impressed with every single one. You can t go wrong   The menu is available at the counter  and you pay at the counter and wait for your food.
Taco Joint,209,This was our favorite stop during our Austin taco tour. I had the chicken mole and seared fish tacos and was impressed by both. They were flavorful and large portions. During this COVID time we appreciated the prevalent hand sanitizer and large outdoor dining area to enjoy their fantastic frozen margaritas. Will definitely stop by next time we re in town.
Taco Joint,210,Seared fish taco and mole taco were incredible. Also tried the fried fish and shrimp. Shrimp was a little underwhelming but the others were fantastic  and salsas were some of the best we ve had. Quick  friendly service. Highly recommend 
Taco Joint,211,Amazing service and food  hands down super consistent flavor. The covid process makes me comfortable knowing they value my health and theirs.
Taco Joint,212,I ve been here for lunch a few times now. I really enjoy the El Porko and Senor Crocket Tacos. Of Dutch ancestry  I didn t expect to find Gouda on a taco - it was a great surprise.   They ve got nice Habanero salsa - it s on the spicier side of the heat index - but not quite the  wish I hadn t done that  level. It goes great with the tacos.  The menu is pretty large  and I haven t tried everything on it - but I ve greatly enjoyed the food I have tried. I ve not been disappointed.   The staff is always really nice. The atmosphere is quite loud during lunch rush  and the setting is reminiscent of a whole-in-the-wall restaraunt with a patio  Anyhow - I enjoy stopping here for lunch.
Taco Joint,213,The food was great. Especially the tortas. Don t expect the cleanest place. There is a lot of customers and table is self service  but most people know that going in. The only reason why I rate less than five stars was because it took 30 minutes from the time I ordered to when I received my food. They also said the wrong number when they called me.
Taco Joint,214,Honestly  it s insane how good this place is and I love how they re open early. It s quick and easy  with plenty of parking. It s not overpriced and the food and menu are awesome. A friend told me it was better than Torchy s and I think he s right  Nothing but good things to say about Taco Joint 
Taco Joint,215,Ate  El 4 20 El Porko Wholly Mole 1 12oz Corona with Lime  Current mood  satisfied All three tacos were delicious and required zero edits after delivery. Flavor is perfectly layered  wife had tortilla soup  also delicious.   Total cost for lunch for 2   39 Outcome  Quite pleased with flavor and substance of the meal and flavors  pictures of dogs with hats framed are also noteworthy.
Taco Joint,216,Awesome taco   The only regret is I only had one   El senor Crockett taco is the best street taco I ve had in a while
Taco Joint,217,Taco Joint makes some tasty tacos.  We stopped here for breakfast  and I ordered 3  chorizo  amp  egg  potato  egg   amp  cheese  and barbacoa.  I enjoyed all of them  especially with some of the salsas from their salsa bar.    Taco sizes are generous for the price  I showed up hungry and the 3 tacos filled my up for about  12 including a drink.  They also have a large amount of patio space for eating outside which is nice.
Taco Joint,218,Breakfast taco haven  I work in walking distance and it s so nice to be able to come in and grabs some quick breakfast tacos or some delicious chicken tortilla soup. I ve also had their Horchata and a Mexican Torta during lunch and it was plenty  This is my new breakfast lunch during the week spot. Also  shout out to theTaco Joint Crew  they are super nice and make great food 
Taco Joint,219,Traditional Mexican style meets a hipstery spin on tacos. Disclaimer  you will leave here stargazed. I tried 6 different taco types on my trip here and all of them were beyond excellent  the street taco being the favorite. Juicy meats   excellent toppings   party in the mouth. Ordered a margarita with low expectations  turned out to be one of the best margaritas I ve ever had. A must try when in Austin.
Taco Joint,220,I go to taco joint more than I would like to admit. I go so much that they know me by name. They are phenomenal. The best tacos I have ever had in the world. I absolutely love the food the atmosphere the culture everything about this place is amazing. You need to go here. Your friends need to go here. Everyone needs to go here. Take a day and get a taco 
Taco Joint,221,I ve eaten at this place 4 times in one week. I crave their chorizo breakfast tacos ALL the time. Definitely call in your order and pick it up to go or you can sit out on the porch. But the line there gets so long cause it s so good. 100000  recommend 
Taco Joint,222,I have always been a big fan of both Taco Joint locations... but the 3 star rating is based on my to go order today. The line for ordering is a bit chaotic and unorganized  which I ve always sort of looked past  but is something to be aware of. I ordered 6 tacos to go  and it took about 20 mins to get the order. When I get where I m going  my husband s fried fish taco didn t even have a tortilla  see pic . Not having a tortilla for your taco is incredibly disappointing. Not a good stop for Sunday brunch today. Anyway  I have always loved that you can get your own sauce and their sauce is so delicious.
Taco Joint,223,The BEST taco joint in Austin    I have to stop and eat  here every i time I visit. No joke lol  The food is on a different level and I highly recommend if you re looking for authentic tacos
Taco Joint,224,The flavors were great  I had 2 sausage  bacon  potato tacos on flour for breakfast. The tortillas were a little too hard over cooked  but it tasted good. It s also a bit pricy   7 for 2 tacos.
Taco Joint,225,Food was good. I was impressed with the taco fillings for El 420  Wholly Mole and chorizo and egg. The place is packed so it s an indication of the food  but with limited seating inside. I sat outside and it was hard to eat with all the flies in the patio. They didn t empty the trash  and the dirty dishes and trays were attracting the flies. That really made for a disappointing dining experience. They do have a great selection of tacos with numerous filling combinations  and they also serve beer. I ll be back to try out the rest of the menu but if seating isn t available inside then it ll be a to-go order.
Taco Joint,226,Pretty much the only place I ever get tacos  Plenty of vegan options including drool-worthy soyrizo  amp  handmade homemade flour tortillas. The staff is usually chill  I knocked over like 4 dozen stacked plastic lids  and the guy whose always there  tall  lip ring  was nice about it  amp  picked it up. All in all  high quality affordable food  perfected salsas  huge dogs-allowed patio  nice peeps  and clean bathrooms 
Taco Joint,227,Very good food and margaritas  Went at 3 00 on a weekday and waited only a few minute before it was ready. Margaritas were much stronger than expected  and delicious  I loved the street taco  but didn t love the chicken fajita taco. My husband loved all three tacos he got  fried fish  pork  and fajita beef . Delicious sauces to top with as well.
Taco Joint,228,The tacos here are unique and unparalleled. Street style  I love coming here because it s so quick and easy - I ve never had trouble parking. I wish there was another location closer to my house 
Taco Joint,229,I had the El Porko  Pastorito and the Fried Fish Taco. All three were amazing. It was a flavor carnival in my mouth. The fried fish was unique as it was truly crispy fish. I believe the shells were fried on the flat top as or just before being assembled.  I will return my next time in Austin.
Taco Joint,230,Great value for an Austin taco place. I ve been to the location on campus as well  but this location seems to be more consistent.  The portion sizes are large  so 2 tacos are generally sufficient for a meal. I m a huge fan of the fried seared fish tacos. Their slaw mix adds a little sweetness that compliments the tilapia pretty well. I also enjoy the street taco senor crockett whenever I need a little variety in meat  but it s nothing special since the steak is chopped up and a little dry.  You can mostly cover for your specific tastes with their salsa bar. I believe the chipotle one is the only cream based one  and I enjoy the avocado habanero salsa.   Compared to most of the other options around the area  downtown   I d much rather make the walk from work over here. Taco joint has been pretty consistent with the quality portion sizes.
Taco Joint,231,God this place rules. Homemade tortillas and sauces. Everyone loves this place. No complaints ever. I get some combination of soy chorizo  black beans  avocado  and potato filling. Cheap  fast  tasty. Its great  just go.
Taco Joint,232,Lived up to the hype   I was skeptical at first to try this place  but honestly one of the better tacos iv ever had. For a city where a traditional taco is on every street corner  taco joint really delivers. Overall good atmosphere and good food with average prices  Must go if you are in the area
Taco Joint,233,They have great breakfast tacos  My coworkers have made this a pretty usual stop on some of our runs. I highly recommend picking up some tacos in the morning.
Taco Joint,234,Here you will see cars double parked and a line worth the wait- I tried several of my families orders as well and there wasn t one taco that wasn t delicious. I did find it strange that the barbacoa taco was listed under breakfast and didn t have eggs  so FYI whatever is spelled out as an ingredient is it. The steak  egg  and  not-so-melted  Gouda was basic but good no less. There s an entire sauce station ranging from Avocado to Chipotle  delicious  Breakfast tacos are not a thing in Chicago  but I wish they were now that I ve had a couple 
Taco Joint,235,Sweet lord. The best tacos you ll ever have. I got the 4 20  seared fish  and street tacos. All of them equally delicious. There is a sauce bar but honestly the tacos don t need any extra flavor they re that good. Just squeeze a little lime. Out of this freakin world    If you re visiting in Austin you HAVE to go here.
Taco Joint,236,today was my first time here. my husband had told me before how good their food is and today i went to pick up lunch for him from here. i called in the order for pick up when i got there i realized people were eating inside and it was kind of busy. so with my 3 kids and the current situation i was nervous to go in. i called and explained to the lady working there and she told me not to worry and brought the food out. amazing customer service thank you 
Taco Joint,237,Really enjoyed the tacos here  but it was very crowded. Because of this  the food took over 45 minutes to come out  which was very long for a grab  n go type of restaurant. However  we did decide the wait was worth it.
Taco Joint,238,Some of the best tacos I ve ever had. The fish taco is a must  And make sure you smother it with chipotle sauce  
Taco Joint,239,Visiting from Dallas. Extremely rude guy at the front- the gothic looking one. When my dad asked which of the fish tacos are better- fried or seared- the guy didn t even look up and replied  FRIED.  Whatever- so we placed our order. Then  after we just spent  50   he tells us that the two tortas we ordered were out in such a rude way. I asked which HE would replace it with if it were his order- he s like no idea  just whatever. I REALLY wanted to tell my dad to get a refund and walk out  but we had a very active day and were starving. Disappointed. Food was bland for the most part- the tortas were not good  I couldn t even finish mine   fajita salad had no flavor  fajita strips thrown on a bed of lettuce  fried fish taco  remember the rudely recommended one   was terrible and so was the wholly mole. The only really good tacos were the shrimp  off the secret menu  and the barbacoa. Not sure what the hype was about  Oh  and bonus points- we have a 4 year old kid with us and he was cussing like a sailor  loud  from across the restaurant to the back chefs  joking around. Never again.
Taco Joint,240,This place is awesome  Today was our second time here and I actually managed to take a picture before eating so I could post it. Last time we were so excited we completely forgot    Food is tasty  affordable and service is incredibly fast  We were here on a Sunday morning around 9 30 and though it was packed with lots of to-go orders we got our food within 5 minutes.   The steak and egg with Gouda and the migas are our favorites 
Taco Joint,241,A local at a bar said to walk to Taco Joint for breakfast tacos  and we take advice from locals seriously  they know their city and rarely steer us wrong. This tried and true theory is proven right yet again  Taco Joint is just the right balance of divey hole in the wall and colorful trendy Mexican restaurant in one. We were glad we arrived a bit early  as quite the crowd amassed not long after we placed our orders. When our number was called and we got our hands on our tocos  it became immediately apparent why this place is a favorite among residents. Tacos are reasonably priced  a bit creative  without being over the top   and most importantly  packed with flavorful  quality ingredients. My fave was the steak  eggs  and gouda. Top off these treasures with their chipotle and or avocado sauce from the salsa bar  and you ve got taco perfection. I washed mine down with a guava margarita- I figured that the fact that it was grit flavored made it okay for 9 am vacation. Viva Taco Joint 
Taco Joint,242,This place was great. The food was delicious and priced well. There are a variety of sauces to choose from  and I highly recommend the habanero sauce. Need to stop by this place.
Taco Joint,243,This place is a gem.  I don t know why anyone wouldnt eat here every meal of the day.  Tortillas were fresh... delicious.  Migas were on point
Taco Joint,244,Straight TRASH  These tacos are over priced. Have no flavor and isn t worth it. If you want real tacos hop on 35 and head down to San Antonio. Austin  stop trying to make tacos happen. You suck
Taco Joint,245,Legit homemade tortillas. They are homemade and lightly charred.  Best breakfast tacos in Austin  nuff said I was amazed of how much better they are than Torchys.  I would suggest not raising prices for a while bc everyone I ve taken here says the same thing- about what a great deal the tacos are.
Taco Joint,246,I can t stop raving about the egg  cheese  and refried bean breakfast taco. It was huge  delicious  and somehow not overly heavy. The flour tortilla itself is fresh and heavenly. There s a huge kitchen staff  and service was quick even though everything is made to order. I hope to come back to Austin soon  mostly to have this taco again 
Taco Joint,247,I take it back. 1 star. You re fighting a customer on yelp. You ve made a ridiculous request and asked a customer to bring back a receipt that you very well known was thrown out weeks ago. The entire issue would have been resolved had the receipt had the prices on them to begin with.   Take this as tuition. If you don t want to lose any more customers don t fight them and start arguments online. I sincerely hope you learn something about customer service from this experience.  For anyone reading this  the tacos are only okay at best.
Taco Joint,248,Fantastic first experience  Not greasy AT ALL. Lightning fast. Authentic vibes. Pricier than most places but tacos are much larger than most.   I had the street taco and fried fish taco. Bomb. Ate it too quick to post pictures.
Taco Joint,249,Possibly the slowest service ever. Poor performance all around - packed or not  waited 40 minutes for 2 tacos. Blatant disregard for not only our basic human rights  but the right to consume delicious tacos - tacos that will never come. What happened to the traditional process we ve grown accustomed to  How can this kind of inhumanity continue to exist. There are some big decisions to be made here in the name of all tacos alike. Stand up for the taco joint name because clearly it is in major decline with this location.  -My friend David Bonno
Taco Joint,250,Oh my  I only need to order one taco next time.  But who doesn t need love a taco for later   This place serves them at soooooo good  They even have a clever idea -bring your own cup get a better price on coffee.  I wonder if I bring my own plate - can I have a taco at 20  off.  I m sure they ll offer something if they don t already.... busy busy place though... come before rush times if ya don t like crowds or are picky about where you sit.... the outdoor seating is where you d want to be on a nice day..... I need one of these restaurants in my neighborhood  it feels like a community place for people to come together and have tacos  Perfect place to stop if getting hangry on a weekend run or leisurely stroll....
Taco Joint,251,Mmm mole tacosssssss con queso fresco...WooWoo  So damn gooT    FreshTortillas  Seems to be family owned.
Taco Joint,252,Straight Fire food for a low price. Food loaded with flavor definitely did not disappoint You want something quick and satisfying come here
Taco Joint,253,Time and again  Taco Joint blows me away. Most of my friends know that I absolutely love this place  and the majority agree with my - definitely - over the top excitement for the tacos here. Now this location is a little different. It does not have the same character and hole-in-the-walliness that drive UT students to frequent the Taco Joint behind the engineering buildings  but the tacos are so good it just does not matter. And this place does have its own charm. All the employees are friendly and seem to be friends with each other. Even during breakfast  brunch  lunch rushes everyone seems to really enjoy what they are doing.  One thing to note  not everything on the menu is perfect. The Chicken Mole  Chicken Fajita  and Treehugger tacos are well known to not be great. The tortas probably won t excite folks that have had a lot of good tortas. That said  this location has added a couple of excellent tacos including another vegetarian  might be possible to make vegan  lunch option of the portabello fajita and soyrizo as a vegetarian vegan lunch option. The brunch specials available Saturdays and Sundays that were added here are also excellent.  The two things that really put this place over the top though are the amazing homemade flour tortillas and the excellent sauces  habanero  avocado  green salsa  red salsa  chipotle . The tortillas are cooked thoroughly on the grill from raw unlike plenty of places and it gives them a unique  delicious flavor. The sauces are a mix of spicy  spiciest to least spicy in the order I gave earlier   creamy  sweet  and each is wonderfully flavored.  They also have the best potatoes of any taco place I have ever been. My go to taco  even for lunch and dinner  is the potato  egg  and cheese. I have never had one that is as fulfilling as the one here  I eat a ton of breakfast tacos in Austin  San Antonio  Houston  and the rest of the country   and plenty of friends agree that its one of the best they have had.
Taco Joint,254,First off the tacos are HUGE. Ordered 3  way too much. Everything really is bigger in Texas.   The tacos are good. Worth coming and eating  and relatively good priced for the size.  However there are much better tacos out there  so in case  cannot give 5 stars.  Street cred for the salsa bar though
Taco Joint,255,Amazing tacos at a super cheap price. Got 4 tacos a coffee 2 bloody Mary s for  24. If you re considering going to Jos  DONT go here instead 
Taco Joint,256,Great place for meat-tarians and veg heads. I had a soyrizo taco  hubby had one street taco and a fish taco. We loved our food and will definitely be back on our next visit to Austin.
Taco Joint,257,Best tacos in Austin  I ve never had anything bad on the menu  in fact  I ve been impressed with EVERYTHING  The el 420 is shockingly good  the nachos are the best    The margaritas are tasty and potent. Staff is fantastic  ...this place is great 
Taco Joint,258,Amazing street tacos  amazing sauces  and amazing people. I am the type of guy that reviews any joint under 15 bucks based on their food  and the food was 5 stars for me. When you go to any shack looking restaurant that has problem finding parking for people coming in  you know you have found the local goldmine. I am so jealous of people that live in Austin of having such an amazing restaurant in their backyard. if I lived here I would make at least a weekly pilgrimage to this place.
Taco Joint,259,Love this place .  I had both breakfast and lunch here so I can judge both .   Breakfast Tacos   Great size   fast and they have no problem having custom orders . Tasted like real eggs and real tortillas and it was fast.  Lunch tacos    Large tacos and they taste authentic Mexican  this isn t Tex mex or or fake tacos.  I had fajita steak   carnitas and street tacos and they all were great. They are fast and it took like 5 minutes to order to get food .  Fantastic customer service with a very friendly staff that cleans tables immediately . It has both inside and outside eat area and both are nice to eat in . Green salsa has flavor and heat. The prices are totally fair for what you get .   The only problem is no drive through  and parking lot is limited but still worth while place for quality tacos
Taco Joint,260,Look Taco Joint never disappoints  You got to go around a good time if you don t want to wait in line and sit  unless you order to go  what I do all the time . I ve eaten the street taco here as well and it s a blessing the grilled onion is the specialty it s very delicious better than some taco I ve had and I eat them pretty frequently. Also the tortas are so magnificently tasty and well done  they really care for the food quick or not you re getting something worthy here 24 7 .
Taco Joint,261,I went back for lunch and they had cheese options posted. Thanks  The fish taco was yummy and the portabello fajita was good but the tortilla got soggy. Everything on the menu looks tempting 
Taco Joint,262,The tacos are delicious. Had the steak  egg and smoked Gouda breakfast taco. Ordered two but one would have easily been enough. Loved the salsa bar with the large variety of sauces.
Taco Joint,263,I have no idea why this place has such high ratings. Their corn tortillas are totally from a package. Extraordinarily average.
Taco Joint,264,Chipotle cream sauce in ham egg n cheese is awesome.  Nice staff clean place fast service.  Chorizo n egg is great.
Taco Joint,265,I LOVE this place  My running group eats here every Saturday and they are awesome. The food is great  with big portions and great  friendly service. I ve brought work friends during the week a few times and they are always really impressed also.  Actually  nevermind  it s horrible - don t go  Lol  I don t want everyone going to my favorite place 
Taco Joint,266,Making my rounds in Austin to find the perfect breakfast taco  but this place didn t do it for me. Was expecting more fluffy tortillas since they were homemade but mine was actually pretty hard. I will say their salsa varieties were pretty great though. The habanero and chipotle had some good flavor to them. They do pack them though 
Taco Joint,267,Me and some friends were in Austin for ACL and we asked some locals about food around and we heard  Taco Joint  many times. Cute little place  quick to order  quick service  nice portions  and GREAT TACOS    Definitely check it out if you re ever looking for some fire tacos  this is the spot 
Taco Joint,268,Potato  bacon  egg  cheese and avocado on flour. Chipoltle sauce. You only need 1 but order 2 and save it for later.  Call in if you don t want to wait a little bit.
Taco Joint,269,First stop once in Austin  Texas  Howdy  Y all  We stopped here because it was super close to our hotel and the next place we were headed to. It is definitely worth a drop by to try the delicious and fresh tacos  We both tried their most popular the street Taco  I got the Fish seared taco and he got the wholly mole  taco  as a second.  We both loved the street taco. The others faired okay  fish was ranked higher than the wholly mole . We were so hungry  that photos were a missed opportunity to show the pretty open face tacos  Each served with a lime wedge. Also  check out the amazing sauces  Hot  Hotter  and even more hot  and ghost pepper hot  pretty sure it s not ghost pepper  but still  it s hotttt   I m from NC  so this was a new version of hot for me  I loved it   This hole in the wall joint  is fabulously hipster and quirky with its animal art work and bright colors.  They also sale clean cause drinks  These drinks contribute 50  of profits to alcohol and drug addiction  First time trying them  Delicious and refreshing 
Taco Joint,270,I m so happy we came here I m super picky about tacos     And so is my husband THIS TACOS ARE THE BEST TACOS WE HAD AWAY FRON HOME        It Will become our fav place on Austin    
Taco Joint,271,Haven t been here in while because I moved out of the neighborhood  but it s worth the drive. I love love love the breakfast tacos. These tacos are massive  and the sauces are incredible. sometimes there is a line but they are quick 
Taco Joint,272,Damn  these tacos are f ing good. I m currently eating  amp  holy eff  Please come here  amp  enjoy yo self 
Taco Joint,273,Amazingly priced tacos for its portions  The enchilada fries  Thick fries with cheese and meat  were only  5 and were very large in size.
Taco Joint,274,Dear Taco Joint  your salsa makes my face happy   Everything here is delicious- And the portions are definitely Texas sized 
Taco Joint,275,Great place for a quick taco. Delicious  nothing fancy about it. Just a good yummy taco. Lots of outdoor seating  great patio. indoor seating isn t as ample. Fast service  friendly staff.
Taco Joint,276,If you want simple  not too expensive  delicious and quickly made tacos  come here now  Honestly  This place is that good  It gets pretty busy in the afternoon so its hard to find parking  but my oh my  its so worth coming here 
Taco Joint,277,Taco Joint is yummy yummy yummy in my tummy.  There was no way we could come to Texas without eating some of the famous Texas breakfast tacos. When you find the right place  breakfast tacos are amazing       First of all  I m not a big fan of flour tortilla  but I love the flour tortillas in Texas. The good places make them by hand at the premises. The flour tortillas have a chewy bite  but still tender. Second the tacos are sizeable. Three tacos and I m completely stuffed.  You can t go wrong with any of the breakfast tacos. They re absolutely delicious  made with quality fresh ingredients  and served with love. We were there on a beautiful morning  so we got to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine in January.
Taco Joint,278,I love taco joint. Amazing flavors bonus that they have the best prices of any taco place I ve had in Austin.  If you are nearby  go. If you re far away... go.  Breakfast  lunch  and dinner are amazing. You will not be disappointed if you come to Taco Joint. I promise.
Taco Joint,279,This was my first visit to Taco Join. Overall I thought it was good. The tacos are huge. The individual tacos I ve had in other places cities can normally be eaten in 2-3 bites. Not these. I was full after one taco and couldn t finish so beware.
Taco Joint,280,Did two breakfast tacos   steak and gouda and chorizo and egg.  I couldn t really tell them apart -- the chorizo just didn t have that much flavor.  Didn t really care for the sauces either -- habanero was weirdly sweet  red and green didn t have any kick  and the chipotle and other green sauce were nothing to write home about.  And asking advice of the cashier led to her looking at me kind of weird before she assumed I didn t want spicy and suggested chipotle.  It wasn t terrible  but definitely disappointing.
Taco Joint,281,Wow   I ve never really been that impressed with many taco places in Austin but the tortillas here are great and they PACK the tacos   Fist time I got food here  my coworker watched me take my first few bites and I was SMILING WHILE I WAS EATING ...doesn t happen often.  Ugh  I m so glad this place is close to my home and work. Y all doing a great job  And because I ate them at work - my coworkers are hooked 
Taco Joint,282,My love for this place is so real  They have the cheapest  biggest most fulfilling breakfast tacos in Austin. They also have a bar of condiments which is amazing because you can get as much sour cream as you want.   These tacos are authentic and made by Hispanics. The horchata is so tasty and they have a pretty Big menu.   I come every time I am in town and you should to
Taco Joint,283,Some of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had. The homemade flour tortillas are so good I could just eat them plain. My go-to tacos are the migas and potato  egg  and cheese and I have never been let down. There is also a great assortment of salsas to choose from- all are equally delicious and have something different to offer. Service is very friendly and I always look forward to coming here. Very affordable tacos that always leave me STUFFED  they do not skimp out here. If you haven t experienced their tacos  go now.
Taco Joint,284,I have got to say being raised in houston and born in Mexico City there is no tacos like home .I went based off yelp and yes this was a good spot . I was just disappointed when I asked if the corn tortillas where home made and they weren t . But over all the tacos where delicious. The service was very prompt and the price was as very reasonable.  I would recommend this taco joint to everyone. They do have a good menu and staff was friendly from the minute I walked in. I will definitely be returning here when I am in Austin again .
Taco Joint,285,Homemade tortillas. I love their Fish Taco and variety salsa sauces. Their beef are a little too dry for my taste.
Taco Joint,286,Had the Street Taco  5 5. And the Bacon  Potato  and Egg Taco  5 5.   Other The salsa  3 5. Dark atmosphere. And Tortilla 3 5. Taco Ingredients 5 5.
Taco Joint,287,I am a fan.   My expectations weren t very high  cause I loathe this part of town   so maybe that assisted with my determination. I ll tell you what I usually expect and liked here     the place was very busy yet busting out orders in a sustainable time frame   the flour tortillas were ON point  cooked well done  the cheese was melted  the eggs were done right and also delicious  the portions were MASSIVE  the prices were affordable  that salsa bar   I ordered the open face migas taco and it was awesome  You can get all the ingredients as a tostada  which is why they call it open face. I got it on flour though. After one taco I was full  but of course in Austin most taco joints have little to no ingredients. Not here  So my second taco was not needed but thoroughly enjoyed.   They serve breakfast all day which is a major plus for me  as well as specific lunch tacos with fun names like  El Tree Hugger   and  El Porko.  Hell  they even had vegan tacos offering soyrizo if you re into that. Also noteworthy are the variety of tortas offered and fun fact  They even have a vegan one which I have yet to try. This is a very Austin taco joint with very conscious offerings and I hope they stay in business a long time.
Taco Joint,288,Honestly not impressed. Yes the food tastes fresh  yes the portions are large  and yes the prices are good  but something about the flavor just doesn t do it for me. It might be just the style of tacos or something. I ve now had 6-7 different tacos and the torta but nothing has really hit the spot for me. The closest thing to a favorite was the breakfast taco with sausage  which is strange because I normally don t even order that taco.  Side note though  their accessibility is on point  no stairs - all ramps.
Taco Joint,289,Quality has unfortunately gone down hill. Last few times we came tacos were cold  like even the sausage was cold...
Taco Joint,290,I was in Austin for a conference and a friend had suggested this place for good tacos. I ordered the fried fish taco and street taco. The street taco was the BEST I ve ever had  So flavorful and delicious. The fried fish taco was amazing as well. I would definitely recommend this place 
Taco Joint,291,This is a great restaurant. It s nothing fancy  exactly what a good taco place should be like . You walk in and order at the counter  then you re given a number. The drinks are self serve and they have a great salsa bar and lots of hot sauce available. If you re not starving one taco will be plenty  The tacos are generously portioned with lots of fresh toppings. I don t think you ll go wrong ordering anything off the menu taco-wise  but please make sure to order some chips and queso  Those house made chips are so incredible  and I m still not sure what made that queso so good but it s thick and creamy and oh so yummy 
Taco Joint,292,Favorite tacos in town  Livia and Priscilla are the most amazing taco goddesses alive.  My friends and I go daily for our potato  bean  and avocado breakfast tacos. Not on the menu...yet...  Thank y all for the best homemade flour tortillas  and for being as vegetarian friendly as possible in a kitchen that also serves meat. Best potatoes ever.  Much love and many thanks.
Taco Joint,293,Tacos are always a great size and they are close to my work. Riverside and basically Congress 
Taco Joint,294,These were really great tacos  The El 4 20 was so good  They also provide outside seating that is shaded and has fans blowing.
Taco Joint,295,I haven t had much of their menu and I want to like the place. It s located on Riverside which is close to the trail. The time I went  I saw a bunch of runners come to this place after their long run. I ve had their breakfast tacos and I wasn t impressed with it. I m willing to give them a chance to try the rest of their menu. Maybe I need to change it up a bit. They have a small salsa bar and I usually get the chipotle and avocado salsa. The tacos are big so I don t have any complaints about it.
Taco Joint,296,23  for 4 big tacos a mango margarita and a cup of tea  Loved their sauce bar and their margarita  also the patio sitting was nice. Street tacos were good  I would def go here again 
Taco Joint,297,Yummy and quick. There are so many taco places in Austin  so I won t say that this is one of the best  but it s still very good. Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. The tacos themselves are big-- each taco has 2 tortillas and they fill them generously. Lots of sauce options and they give recommendations for pairings.
Taco Joint,298,Down here for RTX and had the best and first street taco of my life. Loved the bustling kitchen and the friendly staff. Portions were generous  but some tacos were a little too greasey on my 2nd visit. Highly recommend their classic street taco.
Taco Joint,299,The food here is fantastic  The parking is a big problem during peak hours and the seating inside is extremely limited. I got the street taco  the beef brisket  and the wholley mole. The tacos were fairly simple 3-4 ingredient tacos excluding the crispy tortilla. They composed of meat cheese and maybe a veggie. By themselves  the tacos tasted pretty good  not too flavorful  but definitely not bland. However  there is a sauce station that gives you the option to spice up the taco with a good range of flavors and good range of spice. My favorite by far was the beef brisket because it was tender but still had a bite to it  and the grilled veggies added a perfect Smokey and grilled fajita taste. On top of that  the chipotle mayo sauce i added to the taco made it just phenomenal. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanted larger tacos that are good in quality and quantity for a fair price.
Taco Joint,300,Best breakfast tacos in Austin   Get their potatoes and a homemade flour tortilla along with their chipotle crema salsa and you can t go wrong with the rest.
Taco Joint,301,THIS PLACE IS the SHHHZ.  The tacos are GIANT... you really only need to order two max. I enjoyed my seared fish taco and the street taco made with sirloin steak. The meats were very nicely spiced and cooked perfectly.   Another great feature of this place is that they have a plethora of homemade hot sauces to try  Guacamole  Chipotle  Green  and Habanero. They also have different types of store bought hot sauces like Cholula and Tapatio.   Their outdoor seating arrangement is very nice. A shaded area with a fan is a MUST in the Austin heat... but just be careful when walking up the ramp to the back deck. I didn t see the side of the ramp and tripped and fell into the table next to me... water and lime went flying and hot sauce ended up in my hair. I guess it is all part of the Taco Joint experience  hahah 
Taco Joint,302,Great price  great food  I m very picky when it comes to mexican food but this place was great  I had the Torta Ale and loved it 
Taco Joint,303,One word  solid.    The carnitas hash is strongly recommended  and for  7  it would be my go-to breakfast if I lived in the area.  Salsas  esp. the habernero  are on point.  The outdoor seating is nice  though I left my food out there unattended for about 20 seconds to find some crows picking at my taco upon my return.  Donno if anything can be done to keep them away  and I guess it s my fault  but it put me in a sour mood.
Taco Joint,304,This place is so good it makes me angry I don t live in Austin. Tacos were superb. Queso dip was the only average item. Great place to eat top notch tacos and guacamole.
Taco Joint,305,Wanted some breakfast tacos.   Score   They were outstanding.  Staff friendly and lots of parking.  This is not just a small taco stand.  I will go back
Taco Joint,306,This taco place is amazing I got the migas breakfast taco and it was absolutely fantastic  definitely one of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had   I also love that there is outdoor seating great for when I bring my pup 
Taco Joint,307,I went to Taco Joint on a Sunday for brunch and be warned  this place gets PACKED. It was really difficult for us to find parking and seating inside is very  very cramped. I do wish they had a better layout because the line can get long and difficult to navigate.  I really didn t enjoy squeezing myself between people to order food pick up my order of food go to my table go to the bathroom . I think their food was authentic and delicious  however  which I would give 4 stars for. They are cheap and decently sized  the tortillas taste pretty fresh  and they do a good job with their breakfast tacos. I do like that you can self-serve your salsas and that they have a larger selection of salsas. But coming from San Antonio  I wasn t particularly impressed or awed by their food. I think that it s a great place and worth it if you ve never had a breakfast taco before  however  I didn t think it was worth the wait squeeze stress. I m sure if I went on a less crowded day I would ve enjoyed my experience a lot more.
Taco Joint,308,Austin has some great Mexican food and these tacos were delicious and flavorful. I tried so many different options and they all were delicious.  The different sauces that came with the different tacos complimented the flavors well.
Taco Joint,309,We went for breakfast and I had the open face Migas and the portobello fajitas both hit the spot. The migas was one of my all time favorite tacos  it was good. Loved the salsa bar and all the salsas were delicious. There was some really cool places adjacent and the patio was awesome. Will definitely return for breakfast. I thought it was a pretty authentic mexican restaurant not Tex mex which is awful.
Taco Joint,310,This  Taco Joint  is delicious.  I have to admit i was a little hesitant because of the prices but i think it was well worth it.  The queso is good and the chips are homemade.  They have a little salsa bar with several different types of salsa to add that extra zing to your taco.
Taco Joint,311,Decent tacos  good service  cool menu.  Meat was left out on a tray in the kitchen. Def tasted that way.
Taco Joint,312,Define lay a quick in and out place great food at a really cheap price that would get you full  There s vegan options and certainly a dog friendly place on the open patio  I live their flight of sauces at the bar. Try any Taco whether breakfast or lunch style that s made freshly made tortilla wrap and you won t be disappointed 
Taco Joint,313,This place has the best tacos I ve ever had. I ordered the beef fajita and pastorito. They were huge. The beef was juicy  tender  and accompanied by delicious peppers and onions. The pastorito was delicious pork with cheese  cilantro  and onion. The tortillas they were made with were soft and delicious themselves. I got plenty of habanero sauce to go with the tacos. Just a little bit of spice  but so good. I was completely full with 2 tacos  but they tasted so good I wanted a third.  Location is a short walk from downtown. Cute outdoor seating and nice air conditoning inside. If I m ever in the area again  I would definitely stop by for the beef fajita again  and also to try more of the items on their menu.
Taco Joint,314,I m a regular at the original taco joint near campus and ventured down to this location when I was craving tacos on a Sunday morning. The Street Taco is my go-to. This location did not disappoint on the quality of service or food. The only negative about this location is that parking can be difficult during peak times  so carpool if you can 
Taco Joint,315,Makes up about 1 3 of my diet. I love this place. Best tacos in austin.   For breakfast I recommend the steak and Gouda taco  Lunch try the street taco
Taco Joint,316,I ve been on a sacred quest to find the best breakfast taco in Austin for the last 15 years. Today I found the grail and Camelot in the same place. Good god  The eggs are fluffy  the cheese starts out hard and melts just the right amount  the potatoes are big and chunky - and all are complemented by the avocado and habanero salsas.   But the tortillas. Damn these tortillas. I m gonna have a hard time ever eating another tortilla after this.
Taco Joint,317,Very friendly staff and delicious tacos close to downtown. What more could one want  
Taco Joint,318,I had a potato and egg taco then a street taco. They were DELICIOUS. The inside is very small so you re basically lined up next to the people sitting and eating. They have a variety of salsas to pick from and a decent outdoor seating area  The food is 100  worth it tho.
Taco Joint,319,Great tacos  We ordered a few to have while waiting for the bats under the congress bridge. Great location  speedy service  and delicious tacos. We had the street tacos and the pastorito. We give both 5 stars.
Taco Joint,320,I ve been to the location near UT countless times and thought this new location would provide a similar experience  but boy  was I wrong.  Gone is the charm that is the owner yelling at the line to keep the door closed.   Gone is the same man getting more impatient every time he repeats your order. Gone is the struggle of trying to find somewhere to sit among the cramped tables and over-sized backpacks students lug around.  Gone is the disappointment of wanting a taco so badly on a lazy Sunday  forgetting every time that taco joint is closed on Sundays  and leaving the establishment broken and empty.  But other than that  the tacos are pretty much the same. Tastes great.
Taco Joint,321,This place has some of the best tacos and brunch options I ve ever had.  If you re brunching get both the hash and breakfast taco. You can definitely split--they have big portions  For the regular tacos get the street taco  but not the steak strips with Gouda...sadly it leaves much to be desired .  LOVE the sauce bar and fun  hideaway  ambiance.
Taco Joint,322,I love this place. The tacos are large so gauge your hunger well before you order.  My favorites are the street taco and the beef fajita taco. The breakfast tacos are delicious too. They have a nice salsa bar with maybe 8 varieties. The service is fantastic and friendly  Pricilla and Livia are so nice  .   I d say the only downside for me is that almost all the beverages are bottled or canned. I prefer fountain drinks. When they have the aguas frescas available  those are quite tasty.
Taco Joint,323,I am lucky enough to have Taco Joint as my neighborhood spot for tacos. The food is authentic and the staff is super efficient. Every item I ve had has been amazing.
Taco Joint,324,Their migas tacos are the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a   Prepared to be 100  satiated. They ve also got a wide array of salsas to choose from. A 
Taco Joint,325,I have been here now twice and the food is pretty good overall. The hot sauce isn t consistent and the food as well.  What I mean by that is  the hot sauce is sometimes spicy and then other times mild.  The food may have certain toppings this time but next time it maybe different or have a lot more of something.
Taco Joint,326,One of the best breakfast taco places in Austin  Service is fast  food is good  Many different choices  
Taco Joint,327,Awesome tacos for a great price    Some of the popular taco places in town have gotten WAY too expensive  IMHO. Taco Joint has great prices  especially given their location in prime real estate on Riverside near Congress.  2.25 for a 2 topping bfast taco. We ordered a sausage and egg  a bacon and egg  plus two migas tacos   2.95 each . The bacon was super flavorful  crispy  non-greasy bacon and fluffy eggs. The migas were fantastic  by far some of the best in town  The addition of queso fresco gave it a unique flavor. Their homemade tortillas are flavorful and slightly grilled  not raw  to give them more flavor and a bit of crispiness. I was full after one miga taco    Five stars for sure once they work on their traffic flow - it was unclear where the line was to order and WAY too crowded in the entry near the counter. Move the salsa bar out of the way so it doesn t clog up the entry. Put a menu board above the counter so customers can see the menu while waiting in line. I didn t have any problems parking  plenty of spaces  on a Sunday morning around 10-11am.
Taco Joint,328,I was looking for a spot to have lunch with family  2 young kids included   and every place on SoCo was a complete nightmare - people spilling out onto the streets of every restaurant.  No way two kids under 3 are going to survive waiting 70 hours for pizza.  So  I made a split decision to turn onto Riverside  spotted the  Now Open   flag outside of Taco Joint  and pulled right in.  That turned out to be a great choice   Despite the crowded layout at the entrance  there is plenty of seating inside and outside on covered porch areas.  The menu has a lot of interesting choices  including tacos and tortas.  I got a grilled fish taco  and a Mexican street taco - they were both fantastic   Just as good as Torchy s and the same price  but double the size.  The flour tortillas are homemade  thin  and really tasty.  I loved the avocado salsa  as well as the red.  My family  also picky on Mexican food and hard to impress  loved their choices too - a torta and breakfast tacos.  My one complaint would be that the beans  bean and cheese for the little ones  were way too salty.  They had a good flavor  but just too much salt.  Otherwise  the tacos are well-made  topped with yummy stuff  and generous for the price.  I wish Taco Joint were closer to my house  but I ll definitely be back if I m in the area 
Taco Joint,329,I love trying new taco restaurants  Decided to try this new taco joint off of Riverside on a busy Saturday morning. We ordered our tacos and about 10min later they came out. I ve been to many taco food trucks restaurants here in Austin but this place was super fast at getting our food out   With many options on the menu I decided to try the grilled and fried fish tacos. Everything about those tacos was delicious. Plus you can dress your tacos up at their salsa bar   Taco Joint is a great place to grab some great tacos to dine in or take with you to go 
Taco Joint,330,Amazing  We really like the style fresh hand made tortilla and awesome food and salsa
Taco Joint,331,First time here I ordered the Torta ahogada it was delish  Loved the combination with the plantain chips. I will definitely be back to try other items. The only bad thing would be parking.
Taco Joint,332,My favorite taco spot in Austin hands down. Great for eating there or takeout. Make sure to get a side of the chipotle sauce. Also their frozen margarita s are delicious. I eat this for lunch or breakfast at least 2 times a week and it s always amazing.   Potato egg and cheese is by far my favorite but the Street Taco is also really good.
Taco Joint,333,Always Amazing. Best Breakfast Taco in the city. I m a taco connoisseur  and let me tell you  you can t go wrong with a Egg  Cheese  Bacon  with a little red and a little orange sauce. Austin has tons a lame wanna be  hip  tacos  this place is actually HIP. Go there  eat  and Love Yourself 
Taco Joint,334,One of my favorite Taco Joints in Austin  TX  I have been going to Taco Joint for over two years. I originally ate at the location by UT Campus  but now with this location closer to where I stay it has been great  The food is great and I love all of their breakfast tacos  Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants great breakfast tacos    I am from San Antonio originally and love breakfast tacos  and happy that I can find them here in Austin 
Taco Joint,335,This is the best taco place is Austin  Same amazing food as the location near UT campus but the atmosphere is now much nicer. They did a great job with the patio and decor  and the service is always wonderful. My favorites are the breakfast tacos with a few honorable mentions - the street taco  portabella  420  and fish. But I ve really enjoyed everything I ve tried and the tortillas are awesome.  Also  and maybe most importantly  the sauces here are remarkable  The chipotle is the perfect storm of sweet  creamy  and zesty and adds pop to any taco you may choose. Chipotle is best but I don t want to play down the scrumptiousness of the rest - green  avocado  red  habanero - all a delicious addition to any taco.
Taco Joint,336,This place is the bomb    The tacos are off the hook and the service is incredible    The grilled fish tacos are seasoned to perfection and they have an amazing selection of salsa  and sauces.   HUGELY recommend   
Taco Joint,337,Absolutely fantastic tacos  They are a decent sized taco for a decent price. Lots of variety of tacos. And their margaritas are good too  A huge plus is that they are dog friendly on their patio. Taco Joint also offers a dish for your dog 
Taco Joint,338,There is something for just about everyone here. The fried fish tacos are my favorite amongst many of their food other options. Give this place a try   
Taco Joint,339,We had several people recommend this place while we were visiting Austin.  So glad we made it   We had 4 different breakfast tacos and they were all excellent   While the ingredients were good  it was the outstanding tortillas that made these tacos stand out from the rest.  Our favorite was the Migas...yummy   Second was the chorizo  egg  amp  cheese.  Wish we lived closer so we could eat this more often 
Taco Joint,340,We had the shrimp  chicken fajita  Main Street and fish tacos. The tortilla was  super delicious all by itself  They were delicious  There was a line of people but there s no long wait time at all. People had their dogs with them outside which was great to see. Totally recommend the Taco Joint .
Taco Joint,341,In Austin for a 10 day business trip  staying about a half mile from this Taco Joint location. After discovering the place on the first day  I ended up walking down there every other day during my stay. It s that good  My regular order consists of one potato  egg  amp  cheese taco and one bean  amp  cheese taco. The eggs are fluffy and buttery. The refried beans are heavenly delicious. Really good tacos  and stuffed generously into homemade tortillas. The salsa bar adds the perfect finishing touch for you to customize your tacos. The counter staff are very welcoming and friendly  too. If you re looking for a quick  delicious breakfast  look no further than Taco Joint on Riverside.
Taco Joint,342,Great tacos   Stopped here during a road trip to Austin and we raved about them for a while after we ate   The tacos are a good size  two fill you up   I got the street taco and the seared fish taco--both are recommended. The tortillas are so light and they have a little crispiness to them  Yum  Don t forget to get chips and salsa 
Taco Joint,343,My friends and I decided to take a spontaneous trip from Waco to Austin one afternoon  and ended up here for dinner. It was SO good we have decided to make it a tradition to make a trip like that  to this restaurant  once a year. I enjoyed the Shrimp Taco from their  Not So Secret  Menu and my boyfriend LOVED the Fried Fish Taco. Another great feature  They have 5 distinct salsas for you to mix  match  and try. Move aside Torchy s Tacos  Austin has a better joint in town 
Taco Joint,344,Tortillas  on point  Salsas  on point  Service  on point  and full of smiles   - You really can t go wrong   Favorite spot south of the river for breakfast tacos.
Taco Joint,345,First time here and will be back when in town   Highly recommend   Tacos are NOT street taco size  so filling   Not a long wait for food even when busy and plenty of seating outside.
Taco Joint,346,This is the best taco place in town. Everything is good  They have delicious home made flour tortillas  also home made salsas- just amazing  The food is great  best migas taco I ve ever had. The Street taco  fried fish  pastorito  tortas... Definitely it worth a try 
Taco Joint,347,One of my favorite  places. Great food  fast service  great prices. Especially love the self service salsa bar  and the chipotle mayo.  Parking can be challenging  but worth the parking fight 
Taco Joint,348,The wait can be insane here but SO WORTH IT.  My friends and I tried a little bit of everything but the Street Taco was definitely a favorite amongst  the group.
Taco Joint,349,For tacos this place is pretty good the tacos were hot fresh and spicy. If I was in town longer I would of tried more if the menu
Taco Joint,350,Great location for a quick breakfast or lunch taco. If you have time to linger  the patio is really pleasant and there s almost always a dog to pet  classic Austin activity .  The tacos are pretty good  but definitely better than getting a soggy Taco Deli one at a coffee shop 
Taco Joint,351,I got the street taco and the wholly mole tacos  They are a good size so I could only eat one and a half  The street taco was amazing  Wholly mole was okay  not too impressed with their mole sauce. Good outdoor seating and great prices for the quantity 
Taco Joint,352,So I went here twice to be sure before leaving a review  because I really do want to love this place  It s walking distance from my apartment  and who doesn t love tacos     And to be clear  there s nothing  wrong  with The Taco Joint. It was just very underwhelming.   The outside looks like a taco deli kind of experience  or maybe that s what I was hoping for. Anyhow  the menu is really limited and it seems like they aren t super stressed about presentation. I mean  the menu itself is printed on computer paper with Microsoft word basically.   The guac is reeeeaaaaallllllly bland. And they don t give you much for the cost. The tacos are a good size  and the flour tortillas were  not surprisingly  way tastier than the corn shells. The woman at the register is nice enough but there s not a huge focus on service.   My favorite thing about the place would be their salsa sauce bar. All of them are really good  and I m a big sauce guy so I took advantage of that    I d have to say my favorite taco so far  tried 5 between 2 trips  would be the beef fajita taco. I also enjoyed the fried fish taco. It s literally a giant piece of fried fish dressed and put in a shell. But it worked.   Anyhow  will I be back  Probably. But more out of proximity and love of tacos than love of THEIR tacos.   Not a bad place  but not a great place. I give it a 6.5 10. Or 3 stars.
Taco Joint,353,We ate here for lunch on Saturday  February 23rd.  Everyone enjoyed their tacos.  I had the street tacos  and they were  good.  The restaurant was busy  and a bit chaotic.  The line policy was not clear  and the staff could have been friendlier explaining it.   Maybe put up a sign   Other than that  it was a pretty cool place  and very popular.
Taco Joint,354,Saw this on Yelp TripAdvisor-cruised over to the East Austin location. Was one of the best meals we had on foody vacation in San Antonio and 2nd half in Austin. Super authentic tacos-up there with Taquitoria West Ave in San Anton. 2 of us split 4 tacos 2 frozen margs and enchilada fries for just over  30. Go  just go.
Taco Joint,355,Taco Joint is the ish. Food always tastes good. Friendly service. Fast service and yes there is a f ing salsa bar. This is the only place I know that serves veggie chorizo 
Taco Joint,356,These are one the best Tacos we have ever had. We had the steak and fish tacos and they were all delicious. The sauce bar was a plus and the staff is friendly and very helpful. Great experience  Next time we are in Texas we are going to make sure we stop by 
Taco Joint,357,Casual taco spot with big ass tasty tacos  good salsas and good queso. It s one of those places where you order and pay at the counter the counter and then seat yourself. Staff is super nice and were willing to make some substitutions on my order  nothing crazy just like add onions or no lettuce . Definitely worth the stop-just bring your appetite 
Taco Joint,358,The Open Faced Migas is a breakfast taco I could eat for breakfast  lunch  and dinner  We were looking for a place to have lunch and were drawn in by the number of cars in the parking lot. The prices were amazing  the mango margaritas were good  and I love the sauce bar  the avocado being my favorite 
Taco Joint,359,Great breakfast tacos  The steak  egg  and Gouda are probably my favorite. Great lunch spot 
Taco Joint,360,The Taco Joint in Dallas blows this Taco Joint out of the water.  Tortillas Tortillas Tortillas.
Taco Joint,361,3 stars for tacos but I must reduce by a star because the wait is too long. According to my receipt  pic attached  I ordered 4 breakfast tacos at 11 55am today  Sunday  and I got my order at 12 22pm. Not worth the wait.
Taco Joint,362,The beef fajitas taco was the worst beef fajita I ve ever had. The meat wasn t very good at all  it lacked quality and flavor and was a tough chew . So definitely don t get a beef fajita. I haven t had anything else from here. The tortilla was hard. The avocado and green sauce was good. My onions weren t as grilled as they should have been  couple raw ones. The guy that took our order was helpful and nice. The sweet tea here tasted like it was old. Not a very big dining area. More than likely will not be coming back here again.
Taco Joint,363,Food was good. However  service was horrible. We walk and the gentleman at the counter waited on 2 groups who arrived after us before us. I asked him about it and he fumbled through a lousy answer. I m never coming back.
Taco Joint,364,How much can you go on about breakfast tacos  If you do them right  they are amazing. If you do them wrong  I will probably still eat it  lol. Taco Joint got it so right. I had a migas taco that is everything I could want. Soft tortilla perfect eggs pico and crispy tortilla bits. It was the most perfect breakfast taco and one of the best things I ate in Austin.
Taco Joint,365,Went there for lunch and was severely disappointed. Nachos were cold  tacos were inedible and I couldn t finish my food. The real disappointment was that I couldn t rate them 0 stars.
Taco Joint,366,This is one of the best taco places I ve been to. Get the Street Taco you will NOT regret it    Love their little salsa bar too with all the different sauces. Sooooooo good  
Taco Joint,367,In Austin on business and this is some of the best tacos I ve ever tasted.  Definitely will revisit.
Taco Joint,368,This place was close to our hotel. We tried it for lunch and it was amazing  The tree hugger taco and the el vegan sandwich couldn t be better.
Taco Joint,369,Had fish tacos - yummy- fresh  quick friendly service   Mexican coke to accompany  priced GREAT  Would go again if I didn t live 12 hours away  
Taco Joint,370,The place is a little confusing. They have two names in one. You order in the middle and can go on either casual side or other side to eat your tacos. But the tacos were great   Can t go wrong with any of them.
Taco Joint,371,My favorite taco place n Austin. I love the seared fish taco with the pink sauce. Not sure what s in that sauce  but it s great. This is my standard Friday lunch joint. They are always busy but staff is always smiling and hella efficient. Xtra star for the cute dog pics on wall. Please  pretty please open a place in the 78745.
Taco Joint,372,Delicious  giant tacos for  2.50 .  The current cashier is the sweetest girl even when it s crazy busy.  The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the flow. It s tiny inside and the help-yourself salsa bar causes a bottleneck where no one is NOT in the way.  Other than that  yum yum yum 
Taco Joint,373,So delicious...a must go  They serve all tacos  breakfast and regular  all day long  We came here one morning while visiting Austin and returned for a total of 3 days in a row..that s just how good it is  Specialty tacos are better than the breakfast in my opinion  but all is delicious  Only thing they could do different is add more flavor to the retried beans.
Taco Joint,374,This place is awesome   Get the migas taco or the chorizo.  Super fast  friendly service  and the food is awesome. Will be back for sure 
Taco Joint,375,Got our order to go and it was fabulous  My son s bacon  egg  and cheese was awesome. I got a street taco and el pastorita taco. They were both delish. They were big so I could only eat one and had to save the rest for later. But hey at least it s a good bang for your buck  Highly recommend  
Taco Joint,376,BEST TACOS EVER   Okay so they are huge so I m a 5 5 little girl. I ordered two and had to take the other Togo because they are bigger than I thought. Worth the money. Great deal service and atmosphere was sweet 
Taco Joint,377,The Senior Crockett Taco changed my view on tacos. Be sure to get this taco and thank me later. They have pretty good breakfast tacos too.
Taco Joint,378,Excellent tacos and good price. My new taco place whenever I visit Austin. Been there a few times and tried the street tacos and fish tacos. Both were really good.
Taco Joint,379,best tacos in Austin in my opinion. Fast and friendly service  I usually go for breakfast tacos  but their lunch tacos are just as good.
Taco Joint,380,Out of the five delicious tacos we sampled  the grilled fish was my favorite.  Try it with the chipotle sauce from the salsa bar and add an extra squeeze of fresh lime by the water cooler.  The tortillas are very fresh and tasty.
Taco Joint,381,This place is unbelievably good  I was visiting UT Austin for grad school options and found this place on yelp so I thought I d walk there and give it a try. I had a shrimp taco  a street taco  and a  holy mole  taco and they were all super tasty  side note  I m from California where most tacos are way smaller than the ones at this place so don t order more than you think you can eat . If I move to Austin or visit again  I will certainly come back here 
Taco Joint,382,I have experienced a lot better tacos.  These tacos are over priced and not very good.  It takes a while to get your food while you wait.  Eaten here before and nothing has improved.
Taco Joint,383,I love the tacos here  I regret not checking this spot out sooner  They have so many taco options and you can even order breakfast tacos all day. You order at the counter and can get your own sauces from the bar. The tacos are very nicely sized. The outdoor seating is really nice and you can even order a doggy bowl for your pup- he loved it   
Taco Joint,384,The 4.5 rating got me in the door  but I left dissappinted. It is 3 stars at best. The highlight of the meal was the chips and queso. Very average tacos.
Taco Joint,385,Delicious  Migas is the way to go.. but why does Yelp only put    this place is def not on the cheap side. 3  for a taco and more depending on how many items.
Taco Joint,386,I ve had the street tacos and shrimp tacos. Both were excellent. Busy as hell for lunch  but fairly quick service.
Taco Joint,387,Wow. BEST BREAKFAST TACOS EVER  The homemade flour tortillas are crazy good. I wish we found this place sooner on our Austin vacation...we would have come every day 
Taco Joint,388,Yummy food  Really liked cheese enchilada and the tamale cruzado was good. What would have made it a five star is if the beef fajitas had been cut against the grain. Liked the space  indoor outdoor seating. Definitely coming back.
Taco Joint,389,Hands down the MOST DELICIOUS breakfast tacos I ve had yet in Austin. The homemade flour tortillas are to die for. Bring your own coffee mug and get a discount. Plus- they have doggie bowls for your canine friends  If you re visiting and looking for the best taco joint for breakfast  look no further. They have their own parking lot  which is a bonus.
Taco Joint,390,Tacos are soo soo soo good. Not sure I would eat anything else. Also  how do you make something so simple like eggs and  tatoes soo good. I m coming back.
Taco Joint,391,Great food. The tacos tasted awesome. Very filling and big portions. Deff will come again.
Taco Joint,392,Love the place. Favorite breakfast tacos in Austin. The tortillas and wonderful and the tacos are big portion. The ingredients are blended well and the sauces are awesome 
Taco Joint,393,This is the best tasting food ever. Salsa bar is on point. Home made tortillas are the best. Open face migas tostada   avocado salsa will make your mouth very happy.
Taco Joint,394,The tacos are made as you order them. We got a Migas taco  potato  egg  amp  cheese taco  and bacon egg cheese taco. All three were delicious. The tortillas are fantastic. I loved all the options for sauces. The chipotle was my fav. We will definitely be back
Taco Joint,395,I want to give Taco Joint a little more credit since they re the only place I go for lunch during work. For a quick bite  they re pretty good. And their salads are definitely better than you d expect for a cheap taco place. And their breakfast tacos are solid.
Taco Joint,396,Eat here almost every week for the past year and I could never get tired of it. Best tacos in Austin hands down.  My favorites are the street taco and seared fish 
Taco Joint,397,By far our favorite breakfast tacos in Austin  Nothing fancy - just really awesome  simple breakfast. You also can t beat the prices  The potatoes are perfectly seasoned and you have to try the chipotle sauce 
Taco Joint,398,Honestly  not that impressed. I ve been for brekfsst tacos a few times  and the tacos aren t even that good. It s just a bunch of breakfast taco ingredients thrown into a tortilla. None of the ingredients are that good  and this place is very slow even though they have an army of people working in the kitchen.
Taco Joint,399,Awesome tacos. Great variety. Low key and friendly. Would highly recommend. Doesn t disappoint.
Taco Joint,400,Not the same as the one near UT campus. If you are a fan of the chips and queso served at the San Jacinto location  you may be surprised to find that it is not the same at this location. The chips are not the fried wonton-like ones served at the other location  but are hard corn tortilla chips. The other food is good here  but certainly better at the original location. If you are going to Taco J- go to the UT campus location and do it justice.
Taco Joint,401,BE SURE TO SPECIFY TORTILLAS TYPE  Just ordered Street Tacos through Favor. Had I picked up myself  I would have seen that these were all on flour tortillas. Street tacos typically come on corn  so I did not think to specify. The flavors are good  but overall I was disappointed because I was craving a traditional street taco... On CORN TORTILLAS  Also order the TREE HUGGER. I love veggie patties  but this was mushy and disgusting. The patty was soggy and bland and it made the entire taco a messy blob of  eh .
Taco Joint,402,Average at best.  Chips and salsa not even on menu.  Pretty tasteless salsa.  Barbados taco was decent.
Taco Joint,403,Really wonderful tacos  more  Mex than Tex   and that s the way I usually prefer it  While the tacos do take some time to make  they re well worth the wait. The free salsa bar and the variety of frozen margaritas add to the experience. All in all  my favourite taco place in Austin so far 
Taco Joint,404,So happy to have found this spot for some breakfast tacos  Not only was in less than a half mile from our hotel  it seems to be an Austin original and didn t disappoint. Tacos were plenty large 
Taco Joint,405,Chicken fajita taco is really good. Sauce and queso is good. Cleanliness and over all appearance is awful. The sauce bar is salsa in tubes you pour  into cups. There are two bathrooms- one labeled women one labeled men... My daughters were waiting to use the women s and a man came out. Will not return.
Taco Joint,406,every taco seems to be a sublime experience. fast and simple yet easily the best tacos in the neighborhood  definitely my favorite in austin. street taco and senor crokett tacos are both perfect if you like beef. super
Taco Joint,407,My husband and I had a very nice experience at Taco Joint. I ordered the grilled fish taco and it was absolutely delicious and also a fajita taco which has saut ed portobello mushrooms  onions and peppers  it was pretty good but compared to the fish taco I felt like it was missing something. We sat outdoors with our dog Lucy and there was a water bowl available for her there. Also  They have a doggie burrito bowl for  4 that she super enjoyed  it consists of shredded cooked chicken  white rice  peas and carrots.
Taco Joint,408,Loveeeeeee this place. Kinda small but great price for a lot of food. I will definitely be here more often.
Taco Joint,409,The Tacos were good enough to overlook the fact that they had no ice machine and that the dining room was minimally comfortable. I did like the sauces though and the menu offered a decent selection.
Taco Joint,410,Best Tacos I have found. If you haven t tried them then you are missing the standard for good tacos
Taco Joint,411,So much food for a good price - you could have breakfast and lunch in one meal from how much food it is. Get the migas taco 
Taco Joint,412,yesssss. i really like my tacos plain and straight to the point. i typically stay away from crazy tacos with all the extra toppings  amp   eye-wow  factor  but taco joint makes delicious  well balanced  eye-wow tacos. and the staff was super sweet.
Taco Joint,413,I am so glad I came to this place  I got the soyrito  amp  potato taco on corn and a street taco on corn. The ingredient combo of the street was delicious  The avocado  hit the spot and the shredded cheese with sweet sweet caramelized onions. I thought the vegan taco looked a little dry but it was dank  The patio was nice and breezy with the fans and shade. Perfect for a Saturday morning 
Taco Joint,414,This was a perfectly decent taco. They had a range of protein choices and served their tacos on a large flour tortillas which I find refreshing. While the fish taco wasn t up to my tastes  too much batter  not enough fish flavor   the 2 pork taco choices on the menu both delivered good flavor and kept the tacos moist.
Taco Joint,415,Hands down my favorite breakfast taco in Austin. Call your order ahead to skip the line 
Taco Joint,416,Great Tacos  I m pretty picky when it comes to tacos. We are spoiled in California with great Mexican food. This place has a great blend of flavors. The Wholly Mole taco was delicious and so was the steak taco. My kids had a burger and a milanesa torta. All was finger licking good 
Taco Joint,417,I have tried a variety of tacos here and they have all been excellent  The service is pretty quick during the lunch rush and parking is pretty easy  given it s location.
Taco Joint,418,I had a pork taco and a grilled shrimp taco. The shrimp taco was okay but kind of bland. The pork was over cooked and not enough onion or cilantro to call it carnitas. Very dry and not enough salsa to make it better. Now two hours later horrible indigestion. I never get that from a taco  this place did that. Plenty of other better taco places if you are a taco lover.
Taco Joint,419,We tried 4 different tacos when we were here  the Street Taco  Wholly Mole  Pastorito  amp  Bacon  Egg and Cheese breakfast taco. Our favorites were the breakfast taco and the Street Taco  though all were good  Had we realized when we ordered they had chips and salsa we would have absolutely got some  next time though. We would definitely eat there again when we re in Austin 
Taco Joint,420,I have always ordered the 4 20. On of my favorite tacos in town. If in the area a must stop by joint. ENJOY   
Taco Joint,421,Best tacos in Austin  hands down. Despite preparing absolutely amazing food  they also excel at customer service. They will answer the phone a few minutes before open just to ensure you can place your to-go order  and do it with a smile. I come here as often as I can  and have no plans of ever changing that.
Taco Joint,422,Good tacos. Peaceful atmosphere. Fast cooking. I highly recommend the street taco I give it a 7 out of 10.
Taco Joint,423,So goooooooood  I m from out of town and wasn t expecting such a great find  The fresh tortilla shells and sauce bar really made it for me 
Taco Joint,424,I liked the flour tortillas and the salsa bar was nice with a good variety. The drink selection was also good with a lot of variety. The reason for 3 stars is because the tacos were so greasy. The chorizo looked and tasted like chili  like a chorizo sauce  not a meat product. The bacon was greasy and chopped into small greasy fat bits.
Taco Joint,425,After arriving at our hotel we were looking for a good lunch spot and conveniently found Taco Joint a block away. It s a fast casual place with some indoor tables and lots of outdoor seating. The service was very quick. I think I waited under 5 minutes. I ordered two tacos and they were very filling and the perfect amount of food. I tried the street taco and the wholly moly. Both were on flour tortillas. Their tortillas were very thin and didn t fall apart while eating. The street taco came with beef sirloin which was a little chewy but the flavor of it mixed with the fresh toppings were still tasty. The wholly moly was very flavorful with chicken mole and fresh toppings. I liked how each taco came with a lime to squeeze on and enhance the flavor. I d also recommend getting a few sauces to spice them up. Overall a great lunch spot.
Taco Joint,426,I can not stop thinking about this place.  I ll be back in San Antonio and will drive up just  to eat here. I can t say enough about this place. The vibe is chill and The food is epic.  Don t change   
Taco Joint,427,This was the perfect spot to indulge my breakfast taco craving after a night of drinking on 6th street. I highly recommend the egg  potato  and cheese tacos as well as the bean and cheese tacos. These are larger than what you may be used to -- I was full after eating two  The chicken fajitas were a big hit with my boyfriend and he was a very happy man after that meal. The tortillas are amazing and I believe are made from scratch and the fillings are made to order and it all comes to you piping hot and delicious. They have a salsa bar and I must say the habanero one is no joke  and I have eaten spicy food on a daily basis for most of my life . The avocado and green salsas are also excellent. Service is friendly and fast  they have outdoor seating as well which is a bonus when it gets busy. This is a wonderful place for breakfast or lunch and I would recommend it to anybody visiting Austin.
Taco Joint,428,Olivia and Gabriel are great.   This is our favorite location.  Best tacos in Austin  Street taco  shrimp taco  tamale  and carnitas hash are legit and almost always what we order. If you re visiting Austin   definitely don t miss this place
Taco Joint,429,This place nails it every single time. I eat from here a couple of times a week  Migas breakfast taco hollllla   and they have never messed up a single order no matter how many tacos or how complicated. These guys are gems and a welcome addition to East Riverside 
Taco Joint,430,This is the best secret taco joint in Austin... mostly because they don t do eggs well  so many people order wrong.  Such good tortillas.  Please expand to Houston 
Taco Joint,431,I m going to teach two lessons. 1  Austin s greatest contribution to the culinary world is not bbq it s breakfast tacos. And 2  taco joint is one of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had. If you want a down side it s designed kind of weird and there s a bottle neck at the salsa bar. But it s worth being annoyed with the people in your way for the breakfast taco.  My personal record is 24 days straight of egg potato bean and cheese taco for breakfast  I gained a few LB s 
Taco Joint,432,We had the fish tacos  Street tacos  chicken tortilla soup and barbacoa... Wow  Loved  them. Also had a mango and pear margaritas... I m already excited about eating here tomorrow.
Taco Joint,433,Love this place  The tacos and the hot sauces are always on point. The flour tortillas are homemade. Beer selection compliments food well. Plus  the staff is so  so friendly  Highly recommend for a quick bite anytime 
Taco Joint,434,Cheap taco option outside the downtown area.. can t beat the prices for sure  and the cashiers were friendly and helpful. They gave recommendations and allowed us to create our own combinations and substitute toppings. Overall though  the food was pretty bland. Seemed like they were pretty rushed which might ve contributed  but that s no excuses to fill up about half of the tortillas. Wouldn t return  try a food truck instead.
Taco Joint,435,Hooray  a no-frills taco joint in a trendy-eatery part of town. Sometimes you really just want a good taco and to spend under  10 on your lunch. And to not have to scour for parking. And to have a legit salsa bar  and fast service  and authentic tortillas. Thanks for being that stability in an Austin quickly filling up with the next-hippest-restaurant-idea. I also dig the fact that there are plenty of non-taco options on the menu too.
Taco Joint,436,Breakfast Tacos are unreal. Highly recommended for anyone living in or visiting Austin
Taco Joint,437,You d think making really great tacos is an easy task  but having grown up in San Antonio  TX I can tell you it s not. Ingredients need to be fresh  taco s big and home made tortilla s. All three boxes are checked here at Taco Joint and the staff was so friendly  I almost took them back to Nashville with me  Keep up the great work TJ   
Taco Joint,438,Finally tried this place.  We had a breakfast taco that was bursting full of deliciousness.  They fill the taco so full you really get your money s worth. Try the chipotle sauce.  We are locals and we shall return.  One of the better breakfast tacos in town. They have a great deck area too.
Taco Joint,439,We moved here from California 9 months ago  and to date  this is our favorite Taco restaurant.
Taco Joint,440,This place is ridiculously good  personal favorites are chicken fajita taco with added shredded cheese  el 420 and the street taco are tasty little gems as well. My lady usually gets a tamale and they are tasty. Homemade tortillas are yummy. It s less expensive and better than torchy. In fact  I stopped going to torchy all together because of the Joint. I recommend for all taco heads that want some real Mexican style.
Taco Joint,441,Four and a half stars    There is no way. If you want real tacos definitely skip this joint. I ordered the barbacoa taco and migas taco. The barbacoa was greasy the flour tortilla was burnt. The migas taco which is actually on a tostada was mostly onions and shredded cheese not queso or queso fresco as advertised. Both tacos were bland not enough salsa in the world could save them. The tostada alone was good. I won t be back. That s what I get for venturing out.
Taco Joint,442,This is my favorite place in the city. The good is great  but the service is exceptional. The people who work here are some of the friendliest people I know  and we look forward to our almost-daily breakfast tacos because of them.
Taco Joint,443,Good tacos  amazing hand made flour torts. The staff is friendly and service is quick. I would recommend ordering To go because the lines are always long during peak eating times.
Taco Joint,444,Best Tacos I ve had in Austin. Personal favorites are the street taco and the benedicto breakfast taco on the weekend. TJ probably makes up 20  of my weekly meals.   Only complaint is they close at 3 PM on weekends. I d move into the closet and pay rent if they stayed open later.
Taco Joint,445,So if u are familiar with this place you know their homemade flour tortillas and breakfast tacos are slammin . But did u know their lunchie munchies are equally delicious   I had their Holy Mole and Habanero Pulled Pork tacos and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Portions are Texas sized but not overly priced and you can get a lone star for  2.50 which is rare now a days. Inside in tiny at this location but their covered patio makes up for it. I ll be back to try their tortas asap 
Taco Joint,446,Love everything here  on Saturdays and Sundays they have a benedict taco that really does taste like eggs benedict. My favorite is the steak egg and gouda  the green salsas are great  pretty quick despite being so busy sometimes  mimosas could be stronger but the eggs benedict taco more than made up for it. Tortillas are made in house and soooooo good.
Taco Joint,447,Great filling tacos  Had the beef fajita and street taco. Super juicy and flavorful. Love the avocado sauce too
Taco Joint,448,Friendly and informative staff  Affordable and REALLY filling. They also have a dog friendly patio and doggie bowls for  4  Definitely recommend 
Taco Joint,449,Lunch today was two of their big  beautiful tacos  a grilled fish and a pastorito . I didn t specify corn or flour  and got perfect versions of the latter. Tacos really don t get any better than this. They serve breakfast tacos all day  and I can only imagine how great those are.
Taco Joint,450,If your looking for authentic mexican food  or breakfast tacos this isnt the place to go   this restuarant caters to its locals  
Taco Joint,451,When I found out Taco Joint was taking over the old riverside sonic location  I started trying to convert all of my friends. Essentially  most everyone has their  best breakfast taco  place and that place becomes a habit. My close friends have quickly seen the light and Taco Joint is now a group favorite. You can t go wrong with the classic bacon egg cheese with the creamy avocado sauce. They also serve tortas and breakfast burritos- also killer  Their 2nd location is easy to get to  parking and a great patio area to enjoy said tacos.
Taco Joint,452,Wow.......seriously amazing food.   Carnitas and pastor tacos were amazing.  No wait and super fast.   We ll be back for sure
Taco Joint,453,Good place to try out  I want to try the tortas though. If those are the bomb like I ve heard  then I might bump it up to a 4 
Taco Joint,454,The migas are amazing. Ah. May. Zing. Just seriously off the charts. Delicious.
Taco Joint,455,We had the breakfast tacos and they did not disappoint   They were inexpensive AND big. 4 different homemade salsa options and they were all delicious. It is Dog friendly inside and outside  the place was clean and the service was excellent. Definitely a new favorite 
Taco Joint,456,This place is located at the old Sonic on Riverside drive  between I 35 amp  Congress Ave . Gated parking area so don t worry about homeless people coming up and panhandling. The ordering area is a bit small its possible it may be packed like sardines when you first place your order. The flour tortillas are home-made and yummy but they were a bit on the thicker side. Prices are fairly cheap. Great quick stop for after the trail runs 
Taco Joint,457,Hands down the best tacos in Texas  If you don t give this place 5 stars I m not sure you were eating at the same place as I was. I was visiting Austin for about a week and eat here about 4 times. You can t go wrong with the wholly molly but the best was the el 420 was my personal favorite. The best part was the salsa bar.
Taco Joint,458,This place has everything you want in a go to taco place  great handmade tortillas  many delicious salsas to choose from  huge good quality tacos  and friendly service. For added comfort  misting fans on the patios  The tacos are massive  I usually order two and am full afterwards. There s no need to go hunting for premade tacodeli tacos when you can just come here for cheaper and better tacos 
Taco Joint,459,Really like the 420 and fish seated tacos - really the size of a small burrito.  Great flavors and good salsa bar.  Great lunch spot.
Taco Joint,460,Every taco I have tried on the menu has been great. Street tacos and fried fish tacos are the best. Believe it ir not they have great fries and desserts as well.
Taco Joint,461,Great place for yummy tacos. We had the El Senor Crockett  El 420  Street Taco  Fish fried  Fish Seared  and the chicken tortilla soup. The bill was  23  It s a cheap place to eat and leave you satisfied. Each taco was huge. Much larger than other establishments we ve been to. There were ladies in back of the kitchen rolling out fresh tortillas. They have an array of sauces  chipotle  avocado cream  salsa verde  and hot. They have a self serve area with small ladles so you can load up.
Taco Joint,462,Wow  Now that is what I am talking about  Good price  delicious  and their avocado salsa is amazing  Husband had the chorizo and egg taco...said it was the best he has had. I had potato  cheese  and bacon...SOOOO GOOD  You will not be disappointed  AND another plus....there s parking  You must try 
Taco Joint,463,This is so good the tortillas are fresh. The tacos are soooooo amazing.  You can t go wrong with this place.
Taco Joint,464,When I die I hope Heaven is like Austin  TX. Because I will be going to The Taco Joint  This place is so good. Nothing fancy and expect to wait a few minutes if you hit them at the meal hour. But it is so worth it. Inexpensive as well.
Taco Joint,465,Updating to a 5 star place. Consistently good tacos with consistently good coffee. Will continue to head over and bring friends as long as they keep it up 
Taco Joint,466,Pretty good tacos they good vegetarian options. Try to avoid busy times  off hours will ensure less of a wait as obvious as it sounds. The first time I was here was Sunday morning and it took at least a half hour and that was a to go order. Other than that these tacos are delicious  enjoy 
Taco Joint,467,One of the best fish tacos I ve ever had. The plantains were good too. I really liked the chipotle sauce too.
Taco Joint,468,Migas taco is the best in the city- way better than Veracruz. I ve found the breakfast tacos are better than lunch varieties. The burger is gross but it s a taco joint  The fruit salad is really good too. Very friendly service at the counter. Great salsa bar.
Taco Joint,469,Absolutely delicious at an affordable price that get you full  There are maybe 150 places to get tacos in Austin  and this one gets the cake. I am a vegetarian  amp  this place has great vegetarian and vegan options  Every time I visit Austin  Tx I HAVE to stop by this taco joint. Their salsas  avocado creme and chipotle sauce that is self serve are just amazing  amp  the overall feel and environment is fantastic. 12 10
Taco Joint,470,Atmosphere is great and dress is casual.  Prices are reasonable.  I had the El Se or Crockett taco. The beef fajitas were chewy.   The street tacos were excellent.  I did enjoy the salsas.
Taco Joint,471,Came here for breakfast burritos at 1pm on a Saturday and beat the morning rush. Waited 10-15 minutes after placing our order and the tacos are ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I can t believe this place doesn t have more reviews  I ordered the Migas and the Benedicto and honestly could ve eaten double portions of both they were so good. The flavors were awesome and the flour tortilla was so yummy. Definitely check this place out if you need a bite in the morning to satisfy a taco craving.
Taco Joint,472,Love this place   Stephanie and I would to the UT location all the time and now that it s opened here in SoCo we go almost every weekend. We are huge fans of the breakfast tacos and amazing sauces  habanero for the misses and chipotle for me. We ve also had the lunch dinner menu and love it as well. This is a must try restaurant 
Taco Joint,473,I had the seared fish and street tacos.  The were both good but the street taco was really good  more favorable.
Taco Joint,474,Under  8 for 2 delicious and good size tacos and a drink...tax included. I ll surely be back.
Taco Joint,475,Do NOT get the burger. Fries are great  but the beef patty was obviously frozen and lacked flavor. Plus  I asked for the special sauce on the side and they put it all over the burger. Stick to what s best here. THE TACOS    They are soooo good with that creamy green sauce. Yum  
Taco Joint,476,1 taco goes a long way...these are bigger tacos than I expected  I ordered 1 Holly Mol  and 1 street taco. Both were great  but the holly mole especially was satisfying - loved the crispy cabbage contrast with the tender chicken. Ordering a Mexican Coke with your tacos ties it all together perfectly for a really memorable  delicious lunch. One last thing  after ordering your tacos go grab some of the chipotle sauce while waiting.
Taco Joint,477,Wanted to like this place but the tacos were just terrible. We bought quite a few and they all were disappointing. The meats were dry and the tortillas tasted old and stale. Not fun.
Taco Joint,478,Thank you for making the most delicious fish tacos  I had a wonderful lunch on your patio today. They have the best salsa variety in town and at such a great price 
Taco Joint,479,This is amazing  Best tacos I ve ever had in Austin. The tacos are very big but it is so worth it to eat
Taco Joint,480,Great place for a quick bite  can be a bit of a wait during peak hours weekends but when it s quiet tacos come right out. great bang for your buck and the best tacos around. Be sure to use the sauces and load up your tacos  haberno and avacado sauce can be a bit spicy but the red salsa and chipotle sauces are my go to.
Taco Joint,481,We came to check out this place after reading the rave reviews and were pretty disappointed. We got two tacos and a torta  all of which contained steak  that was pretty much the toughest steak we ve ever had. It was hard to eat and I almost choked on it. One of the tacos had so much cheese on it  it was almost overwhelming  and I love cheese. Not a bad place  but not a great place either.
Taco Joint,482,I am addicted to the migas tacos with avocado on the homemade tortilla. The mole taco is the perfect combination of flavors. Their chicken with fruit salad is also fantastic. Tortas are the bomb. Love it 
Taco Joint,483,Great taco place. Good selection  homemade flour tortillas  good hot sauces. Breakfast tacos rock  get the bean and potato and add bacon. Or get the steak and egg with smoked gouda  yum  The lunch and dinner tacos are just as good. They get busy at lunch time  but dinner is very manageable. When I crave tacos  I crave this place 
Taco Joint,484,First time trying it and was not disappointed  Definitely going to hit this place up again next time I m in Austin
Taco Joint,485,Excellent tacos and excellent sauces to go on them. Service was fast and friendly  The tacos are pretty big as well  on takes up a whole fry basket  I will definitely be going back 
Taco Joint,486,I went there yesterday to have dinner with my sister and brother in law and I have to say  the flavor on these tacos is just fabulous  very authentic and great taste.  If you want good authentic tasting tacos  this is one of the best places that Austin has.
Taco Joint,487,The tacos here are delicious  I got three because I didn t know how big they actually are so be ready for a good sized taco.
Taco Joint,488,The nicest  most generous people I ve ever met run this joint and the food is second to none  I simply don t have the words to describe how much I am recommending this place. Everybody should experience this place.
Taco Joint,489,Really good breakfast tacos  They don t try too hard  but their tortillas are awesome and they cook their eggs and potatoes well. Like the option to put some hot sauce and avocado on them  too. Will be back 
Taco Joint,490,We used to live in Austin so when we visited recently  I wanted some authentic Tex-Mex but while looking at the menu I saw the Chicken Fruit Salad   that might not be the exactly correct but it s close   and decided to try it. It was great. After crashing my diet while back in Austin on vacation  this salad saved me  and it was delicious  Try this chicken fruit salad. you ll love it.
Taco Joint,491,This is the place for tacos  The grilled fish tacos are great  Good size portions and great food. Easy parking too.
Taco Joint,492,Absolutely my favorite breakfast taco place in Austin--which is saying a lot because there are so many great options. I usually get the bacon  egg  cheese  and add avocado  and they give you large fresh slices  to start and sometimes get one of their lunch tacos. I recommend the El 420 or the pastorito  but they re all delicious. What you also HAVE TO add is the creamy orange chipotle sauce and some of the bright orange habanero sauce together. Amazing flavors combined--definitely try this place next time you re in the area 
Taco Joint,493,Great Mexican food most authentic I ve had in downtown Austin and it s not in a food truck. Huge plus.
Taco Joint,494,Good place  Stand in line  order your tacos  and bring a deck of cards  because you will wait a while for them to call your number and serve your food. It s fresh  made to order  and delicious. These are big tacos  on tasty flour tortillas. Two will be plenty for lunch.  Go up to the front and get yourself some of the sauces. We liked the habanero  both spicy and sweet   and the green  hot  . We liked the street tacos  the pork carnitas taco  the mole taco  and a shrimp and avocado special. Oh  forgot to mention - there s a list of specials at the front so keep an open mind before you step up to order. This is not perfect paradise - sometimes there s a little something chewy and gristly in your taco - but it s real  well priced and good food. BTW  the bench on the back wall runs the whole length of the restaurant. If there s even one leg jiggler sitting on the bench  like there was today   it s going to drive you crazy. Never mind  it s all part of the experience.
Taco Joint,495,Great fish taco. Traditionally I like a fish taco on corn tortilla so was surprised it was flour. Will ask about corn for next time. The sauces are really tasty. I like these tacos better than Veracruz. Velvet Taco still holding steady as my number one.
Taco Joint,496,This is my first time at taco joint. My boyfriend  and I were looking to eat tacos and found this place close to our house. Decided to come over and try it out. However  I was disappointed when we tried the wholly mole taco...who puts cabbage in a taco   Plus  the mole  was not mole...it had this weird taste ...sweet  my friend described it as bitter and color....there was no color in that mole  Anyways  we are rating this place called  Mexican restaurant  a 3 star.
Taco Joint,497,Delicious  quick  great portions and fairly priced  plus loved the sauce options  Plus it was nice to be able to sit in the sun or shade on their porch.
Taco Joint,498,KEEP THIS PLACE IN BUSINESS. I hope this place isn t getting forgotten since it isn t on the main South Congress drag.  Just walk around the corner people    We wandered in since we were staying across the street and wanted an easy lazy dinner.  Delicious and cheap tacos.  We had chicken mole  fish  shrimp - all very tasty and fresh 
Taco Joint,499,First time visiting and had to take our tacos to go. Not sure if the experience would be different dining in. My tacos were filled with grease. The bag tore because they were so greasy  the foil was greasy and the tortilla was soaked in grease. I took one bite and I was so disgusted. I ordered the street taco and pastorito taco. My coworkers agreed with there tacos being greasy too. I had to throw them away. 2 tacos for  8.01  kind of pricey. They should at least have complimentary chips. I know they just opened  maybe  just maybe it will get better.
Taco Joint,500,Wow  Great food at a great price. The Crocket Street Tacos and the Shrimp Tacos were excellent and competitively priced. Ice cold Coronas to wash it down sealed the deal. Service was friendly and fast. A must stop if you are in the area    
Habanero Mexican Cafe,1,The services fast the food is good price is right fun   times. Really appreciate the daily specials.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,2,Really small and fast Mexican diner  We stopped in here unexpectedly for lunch. The staff was super friendly and the wait time wasn t long at all  despite them being extremely busy.   We ordered horchata  which was delicious. It was so creamy and the portion size was very generous.   The salsa was awesome. It was just spicy enough to be delicious  but also hot enough that I couldn t overeat it.   I ordered the gordita with rice and beans. It was very generous portions and quite tasty. I liked it but think I might prefer enchiladas or breakfast food next time. Also there was a soup everyone was eating that looked really good.  My boyfriend ordered a Machcado plate and the eggs were so tasty. I was jealous of his dish.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,3,Nice neighborhood spot with such friendly staff  They have the best beef fajita in their El Patron plate. Lots of flavor and if you like spicy just ask for their spiciest salsa. They don t make as much  but if you are lucky they will still have some. Arrived on a Saturday around noon and it was only a 10 minute wait for 2. Next time I m gonna try the menudo. It looked so good at the table next to us 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,4,Finally after 2 years since the world turned upside down the Lady and I  made it back and they recognized us  Still tiny  still cash  still hole in the wall. The Lady had Carnitas tacos while I went with the Menudo. Thank goodness it was still extremely spicy  not the bland stuff that is destroying Mexican food during   gentrification of the area. If you don t like spicy  pick carefully. The Taco Salad is a good alternative. Watch the hot sauce. Also if you really like to bring the heat  ask for anything extra spicy   Wonderful lunch 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,5,The owner is rude and overcharges.  I ordered a  10 plate as clearly stated on the menu but was charged  16.  I ordered a plate that was  11.75 but was charged  12.75.  I showed the owner the plate ordered was the  11.75 and he only corrected because I had taken the plate to go and proof that I had gotten the  11.75 plate.  He corrected it but never apologized to me for overcharging in the first place. Instead he was rude and very argumentative   He told me   If can t afford to come out to eat then come    I took my mother to eat there for her 75 birthday  and we will never step foot in that establishment ever again      The owner also does not provide you an itemized receipt.  I demanded an itemized receipt  because the week before I was not given an itemized receipt and I was overcharged  6.00.  I was only given the receipt for the totaled charged on my bank card.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,6,This was quick  good food.   The environment is a bit hectic. This isn t somewhere to go and have a conversation or enjoy the ambiance. More of an in and out kind of experience.   The price is high for what I m used to for Tex-Mex  but it is Austin so that means automatic inflation.  14 for huevos gringos and a jarrito
Habanero Mexican Cafe,7,I don t go here often enough  always delicious   The service  the food  the salsa all great  Working my way down the daily lunch specials-ma ana it s chicken mole  Can t wait. Mmm mmm good 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,8,I gave 2 starts because the service was awesome  The waitresses are friendly and are working really hard. But the food is terrible  needs more flavor.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,9,9 10 food  9 10 service  7 10 ambiance  slightly smaller place overall . Highly recommend for authentic Mexican cuisine
Habanero Mexican Cafe,10,One of our must haves anytime we are in Austin. Excellent Mexican food  amp  wonderful people. Chips  amp  salsa are legit  Mesquite fajita beef is the bomb on anything 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,11,This place is the real Austin deal. This small standalone building has been in operation for over 20 years  and I completely understand why. They have a small indoor seating area that appears to stay pretty busy - it was bumping at 9AM on a Saturday. We ordered the Steak Rancheros Plate and the Chori-Migas Plate. Both were absolutely delicious. These guys know how to season some steak  I love that the home fries are actually French fries - made for a nice breakfast touch. The tortillas were delicious and so was the salsa. The prices are very reasonable  and I expect to be back for dinner sometime  their enchiladas look phenomenal . Very friendly staff  as well - multiple servers checked in with us regularly.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,12,This place is fireeeee   Great food  reasonable prices really not much else to say. But I will anyways. The salsa and chips are so good.  my mouth is watering right now as I am thinking about it.  I love the ambiance and the food is so good  I came in a party of four and we were prompting seated. service was friendly.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,13,Average Mexican food. I got chicken fajitas special today.. they said is was spicy but it was so spicy could not enjoy and I like spicy food.. I had sweat rolling down my face the whole time eating lol
Habanero Mexican Cafe,14,Wonderful authentic Mexican food made to order. Friendly owner and waitstaff. Homey atmosphere  Terrific food   I have my favorites which is steak and chicken tacos but the menu has a variety of great items. Bon Appetito   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,15,There have literally been times when I have driven from Waco to Austin just to eat here. In fact  if I lived in the northeast corner of New Hampshire  I would have to make the trip at least 3-4 times a year.  When entering the restaurant  it feels as if you are stepping back in time. The entire staff treats you as if you are a long-lost relative that they have been dying to meet and always shower us with care. I have friends who ve come here for 25 years and they can affirm this to be so.   What to get  fajitas rancheros and DEFINITELY get the charro beans. The meat is tender  overflowing with flavor and extremely addictive. Legend has it that an Austin businessman once offered the owner of Habaneros  100 000 for the fajita meat recipe but was refused. I guess he remembered the words of Solomon that say   If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love  It would be utterly despised   when he refused.   It s that good.   If you re looking for fajitas and you re in Austin I can t imagine going anywhere else--unless it s 3 AM and you re dying--I guess in that case you could go to Denny s.   5 stars. Will be back. With my grandkids. And they ll bring theirs when I m gone.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,16,Very authentic texmex restaurant with very friendly staff. Very reasonable prices for good quality food. Salsa and chips are delicious. The beef fajitas was very well seasoned but beef was a bit tough. Great grilled medley of green bell peppers and onions. Highly recommend it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,17,This place is my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant in Austin. The house salsa is very delicious and homemade  and their food is out of this world. The prices are very reasonable for the portion size and everything we ve had so far was extremely tasty. We ve gone back twice in a week sometimes and we look forward to continuing to frequent this place. Habaneros is on our tour guide for when our friends visit.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,18,Delicious. Great service  Our waitress was so kind.  Vegan friendly   Just order the Grilled Veggie Enchiladas and ask for no cheese. I had one with green sauce and one with red. Amazing.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,19,  HABANERO s is now OPEN for dine-ins     I ve been dining here for many years and have been driving all the way from Cedar Park to get my fix of Huevos Gringos and the best Chips and Salsa in South Austin.   Their food is consistent  well portioned paired with fast and good service.  There is almost always a wait for lunch on weekends  but getting seated is quick.   We are so glad that they have re-opened for dine-ins and have survived the Covid temporary closures. Prior to Covid  they were CASH ONLY  but it looks like they now take credit cards too.   This place is delicious and is worth going back over and over. Support local 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,20,We recently just moved in the area and this place is super close. We ve become regulars quickly because of how yummy this place is  Everyone is so sweet - and just overall amazing people that work here     My favorite plate is the huevos Mexicana    Thank you for feeding us amazing food - and we ll be back of course 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,21,We enjoy this restaurant every time we have an opportunity to visit South Austin.  The food is always delicious.  I had the caldo de rez this past visit.  The broth is extremely flavorful and the chunks of beef is plentiful.  The soup comes with Mexican rice and two tortillas  your choice of either corn or flour .  The place has limited seating  so be prepared to wait because it s very popular.  No credit cards are accepted  so bring your cash.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,22,Came here on a Saturday at noon and fell in looooovveeee. The salsa with the chips was to die for. The steak on the plate was SO DELICIOUS  we haven t stopped talking about it. Barbacoa was fresh and perfected with the guacamole. Will definitely go back the next time we re in Austin 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,23,Best beef fajitas anywhere   Everything is quite good here but their fajitas are to die for.  Extra Pico please.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,24,Food here is always good and such friendly service. Love how wait staff work as a team.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,25,Worth the wait  Get there early in the weekends. Looking forward to retirement so we can join the regulars  Lol best tripas tacos     Everything s delicious   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,26,This place is great. It truly is a hidden gem. You walk in and think it s a small random restaurant. You sit down  the chips and salsa are made fresh. The steak fajitas were really good. Great service. Reasonable prices
Habanero Mexican Cafe,27,Thanks to Bad Larry s annual favorite restaurants in Austin I ve found what re in my opinion the best enchiladas I ve ever had. I got the enchiladas supremas and for only a little under  10 you get 2 absolutely smothered chicken ench s in their red sauce  amp  cheese and the flavor is just incredible. The other thing I judge when considering a good Mexican spot is their table salsa and holy s  t is theirs amazing. It s pretty spicy but has such great flavor that I couldn t stop eating it and putting it on basically everything. This spot is truly a gem.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,28,Without a doubt  the BEST TACOS IN TOWN.  Big  fat  delicious and cheap tacos  with great se4vice.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,29,My absolute favorite Mexicn restaurant  Top notch service great food and the make you feel like family. Haneneros has a nice family run vibe. I eat here twice a week and can t wait till my next visit
Habanero Mexican Cafe,30,Found this restaurant to eat with my family while in Austin for the weekend. Food was high quality especially the barbacoa and fresh squeezed lemonade. The place is small and there is a wait but worth it 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,31,Amazing food  Visited from LA  so you know we take our Mexican food seriously  Lol. Salsa was perfect with just the right amount of spice and presented with warm chips. I had the combo enchilada verde plate with a beef taco and a side of rice and beans. Very delicious and tasty  I would definitely come back next time I m in Austin  Plus  service was top notch and everyone working there was nice and friendly.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,32,This has been my favorite Austin Mexican restaurant for over 30 years.  Great enchiladas - sizzling fajitas - and chili Colorado  roast pork in red sauce  that s delicious and hard to find anywhere else.  Outstanding chips  hot sauce.  Best rice and beans in town.  It s family owned and usually only open at lunch because also family operated.  Sometimes they can be a bit arrogant - but then I guess they re proud of their little restaurant - as well they should be.  They ve been serving the same high quality food all these years - still tastes just as good as first time I ate there.  I love the consistency   Great lunch specials - but the fajitas served at lunch are very hot 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,33,I would give this 5 stars but then I went to the restroom. If you don t go to the restroom  great  The food is amazing. The restroom is not a deal breaker  it just needs a LOT of help. Also it s cash only which can be challenging.  The food is soooo delicious. It s made authentically and there are definitely locals in here appreciating that. I had some tacos. Didn t enjoy the fried tripe  usually prefer it saut ed in flavorful spices  but the lengua of course was on point. I had a gringa veggie taco which was also satisfying. The flour tortillas are so soft and pull apart like a delicious tortilla should. The breakfast all day is amazing.  The salsa here may have habanero in it. It definitely has a kick. Buyer beware if you have no spice tolerance. The horchata comes in the largest cup I ve ever seen....but I m not a Texan  anymore . I guess this is not that frightening to them    Everything is BIGGER in Texas  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,34,Habanero is an authentic Mexican restaurant  and that says a lot. The prices are good and the food is good  what else can you ask for  Well  now that I mention what I asked for  I ordered the chips and salsa  and the beef fajitas  which were both delicious. The chips and salsa were fresh and flavorful  and the beef fajitas had a unique and mouthwatering taste and seasoning. I would absolutely come here again.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,35,This place was amazing. It s quite small and they only except cash but it was well worth the wait. The service was awesome as well. Coffee so fresh...i had potatoes and egg breakfast taco and the eggs with jalenpenos tomato s and onion it came with beans and french fries...THE chips and salsa WAS ABSOLUTELY amazing    and they have fried jalenpenos....the menu was a lot but it was really. my mom got the chorizo and eggs and she said it was so good. My friend the meat with eggs and beans  so good    If you want authentic mexican lunch breakfast i would recommend this place. Very homey and very yummy.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,36,I went to Habanero today they close at 3p I got there at 2 42  I reached and entered the restaurant at 2 45 I was told by a young man that they were not seating anymore people snd they were cleaning cuz they were closing. I got there 15 minutes before they close and they would not serve me. Please do not ever go to habanero if you are black.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,37,I have only done carry out on my way to work. But the food is always delicious every time and the staff works quickly and is extremely friendly.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,38,South Austin is where you can find great Tex-Mex Mexican food. We have gotten tired of looking at all the vegan vegetarian options for most of the Mexican food places in downtown so we ventured off south.   This place is cash only  it s small but waiting for a table is well worth it. The salsa is spicy  my food is tasty and best off all they are friendly.   We ordered the Lengua Plate which is very tender  juicy and just delicious and Carne Asada which is equally phenomenal. Both dishes came with flour corn tortilla  guacamole yes  It wasn t an add on   pico de Gallo and Mexican rice.   This is the place to go for a great Mexican Tex-Mex lunch while in Austin.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,39,The food was awful awful...I was shocked by how horrible it was. Also they added more money to my tip even though I already tipped 50 ...
Habanero Mexican Cafe,40,Crowded  busy  but the food is good. I wish the chicken enchiladas were in corn  and not wheat. I should have paid more attention while eating  but I was starving.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,41,If you re looking for no-nonsense solid Mexican food  this is the spot. The staff is super friendly  the menu is vast and it s cheap af. Has a craving for enchiladas and this place satisfied it. I went with the cheese enchiladas and got one with red sauce and yellow cheese and one with green sauce and white cheese. Next time I d do red sauce and white cheese. I was satisfied with my meal and not overly full. Definitely will be going back
Habanero Mexican Cafe,42,I went there cause lots of people are recommending this place and oh man it totally deserve the love and hype. I got the beef fajita and my friend got the beef ranchero. The meat is super juicy and flavorful. The rice and beans are great complement to the fajita. The guac salad is very fresh and tasty. The only thing I hope they can change is adding a bit more guac to the dish. I used to think I don t like Mexican food but turns out it s because I haven t been to a good Mexican restaurant. Will definitely come back again 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,43,I always rate mexican food based on the chips and salsa and boy they don t disappoint. Their enchiladas are off the chain and make sure you ask for fried jalapenos. Super delicious for under ten bucks. You cannot go wrong. Plus the staff are so very friendly 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,44,I mean it s alright. This is definitely hype. I mean it s okay.  Nothing to write home back to Alabama about and I am not even from Alabama.   Food  huevos rancheros are some real middle of the mall type of dish. Very basic. Nothing special. I didn t enjoy the huevos Ranchero sauce at all  It tastes like sauce  they use for their chips. The tortillas were good though. The bacon was really good. Were you lost two stars was bringing me out some got dam French fries. Wtf  Lol who serves French fries with breakfast. Don t be cheap  Cut up some dam real potatoes and serve breakfast potatoes. Not that hard. I almost want to give you two stars for that BS lol. One thing I hate is when a Resturant does some real skimp BS stuff like this lol. French fries with breakfast  really  Insane.   Service  service was great. Really fast and everyone was really nice.   Also they only accept cash so bring cash or use their ATM. Lol they just want to inconvenience their clients. Haha
Habanero Mexican Cafe,45,Consistent  friendly  fast. These guys are legit. Been coming here multiple times a week for over a year for breakfast tacos  and I ve never once been disappointed. Great family restaurant.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,46,The family claimed and run caf  that is a not really mystery nearby most loved in light of current circumstances. They are the most delightful individuals and the nourishment is LEGIT  Additionally  the chips are a pleasant  thick kind that is difficult to quit eating.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,47,Since I have been in austin mid nov I have posted over 35 plus review on yelp i tried numereous Mexican  restaurants such as pulvos  El Alma  Matt s El ranchero but I must tell you this is my favorite place in austin to eat. From the pork chops to the El Gringo burrito the Chile colorado   thus cafe has the best food the staff are so nice and the owner too. I m moving back East in a month and I will miss this place Soo much. Please continue to support this local business this is what keeps the charm of austin alive. EvanLKatz
Habanero Mexican Cafe,48,The food here is pretty darn good. I order the beef fajitas and it came with Mexican rice and borracho beans. Rice and beans are on point and flavorful. My beef fajita meat was flavorful  mixed with onions and green peppers. Some of the meat came out a little tougher than I like but not to bad overall. I also had the queso which is great and the salsa too. It was spicy like Ike want it to be. I ll be back the next time I m in the area.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,49,Popular no-frills spot to get legitimate tacos. The portions are great  and the tortillas are fresh. My go-tos are the migas  it s Austin  duh  and barbacoa. I ve only sampled a few items  but I can t imagine any of the platters not being delicious.   The wait on the weekends can be long  and the entrance fills up  so plan accordingly for brunch.  They also have a great barbacoa to go option for a reasonable price  so pre-order and you ll have a lb. or two of barbacoa to go 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,50,Best to get relatively simple items here. I had chicken fajitas  which were pretty good  chicken was just a bit salty   but veggies were good as were the flour tortillas. Tacos were also decent  if not super.  Generally considered one of the better Tex-Mex restaurants in Austin. I ll have to try more items on the menu  carne asada seems recommended here  as well as beef fajitas  before I am convinced about this rating. Seems lower than what I would have thought I would have given it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,51,So I roll into this place one day after some work that was close-by. Now let me preface this with that I have seen this place in passing whenever i m down in South Austin. This restaurant is also near where I play kickball. Every time I ve passed it I say to myself  Self..that place looks like it might be good  so I may need to try it  . Welp I finally did. Its small  crowded during lunch but the service and seating was incredibly fast. The crispy chips and that DELICIOUS HOT SALSA had my mouth dancing. You can tell they make the salsa there and my mouth is watering as I type this...but I digress.   I ordered the chicken enchiladas that were covered in a rich roja sauce with melty cheese abound. The chicken inside was WELL seasoned..which is surprising because I ve had enchiladas who take more care with the outside appearance of the item instead of whats inside. The sides were refried beans and spanish rice...yup that was seasoned too   Got a mexican coke to wash it all down...this place gives my favorite spot  Casa Chapala  a run fr its money...if only they had either BYOB or ritas onsite...  iil be BACK.  PS they are CASH ONLY but they do have a ATM onsite.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,52,As I was getting ready to write this review I observed what had taken me so long. I ve been coming to Habanero for almost all my 10 years in Austin. This south Austin spot is a neighborhood gem. I think I wanted to write my review hoping to keep it all to myself--so it wouldn t get too busy  -   Habanero is my favorite place for breakfast. We often go on a Saturday after working out. My meal of choice is the El Patron. It s the perfect combination of everything  beef fajita  huevos rancheros  beans  and potatoes. And at  8.95 it cannot be best in terms of value and flavor   The ladies working are amazingly friendly. A few things to note  they only serve breakfast lunch AND they are cash only. Don t worry there is an atm in the entranceway if you need. I am glad to see a small  family-run business making it in expensive south Austin. Hope they continue to thrive  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,53,The owner ruined our experience by snapping at all of us when we paid. I used to love this place but not any more. I won t be back.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,54,2020 has not been the best year for any of us  but especially small businesses like Habanero s.  They are open for take-out and today I enjoyed the migas plate with a side of chips and extra salsa.  Soooo good   If you re missing some down home Tex-Mex  you ll find Habanero s  very satisfying.  Their migas are made just the way I like them   lots of chips  cheese  and spicy peppers mixed in with the eggs  onion and tomato.  Cannot eat there without their crispy chips and spicy salsa -- the best   I do miss sitting down with their friendly staff and attentive service  and I m sending prayers that they can hold on through the next few months till things get back to  normal  -- whatever that will be in the future.  If you haven t been there  give them a try  if you re already a fan  stop by for take-out.  BTW  they have currently waived their  cash only  policy and are taking credit cards  too.  And  there s quick service. I parked there and phoned in my order  it was ready in 10 mins.  probably less  I got lost in my phone..... 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,55,Decent food and service  I didn t like the no refills on soda. They bring it to you in a can. Nice quaint restaurant.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,56,Love love coming here for breakfast  lunch  and or dinner. The wait staff is extremely helpful and fast. The owners and staff are all super friendly and will soon get to know you by name once you re hooked like my family is if you love authentic Mexican food  you can get just about anything here. 10 10 would recommend 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,57,My friend raved about this place so I thought I d give it a try. Maybe I had too high expectations coming in  but they weren t met at all. The beef fajita and al pastor tacos I ordered were really dry and hard to chew.   Also  expect a wait when you come at peak times as the restaurant isn t that big. The place was super busy for lunch so we waited about 30 minutes for a table for 3.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,58,This place has been on my list to try since I moved to the neighborhood 2 months ago  but I cook every day and hadn t gotten around to it until this afternoon. Worth the wait   The portions are perfect for the price  the ingredients are fresh and authentic and the staff is super friendly  which makes a huge difference during these strange times when going anywhere can be stressful.   I got the pork chop lunch special even though they re not something I usually like because I knew the bones would be a great treat for my dogs...I can honestly say it s maybe the second time in my life I ve loved chops. The flavor was so good I went to town on the bones for 15 minutes before they went to the doggies 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,59,Had the bean and cheese tacos my first time there and it tasted sour. The tortillas were clearly processed and tasted like plastic. For the amount you re paying for the food I d expect a little better. Sauce on enchiladas is alright and has more flavor than other Mexican restaurants in Austin. Beans are good. Rice was lacking.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,60,The food is sooo delicious here and the waitstaff  the ladies     take extra care to make sure you are taken care of. The only negative that I ve run into time and time and again is the rudeness of the business owner. He is often curt and doesn t treat customers with kindness  which is really the downfall. To the owner  please note that you are the face of this small business establishment yet you are bringing down the vibe of your restaurant with your rudeness
Habanero Mexican Cafe,61,I found this small place decided to come  first of all they were so kind  guy in register was awesome  and so was woman behind counter   Loved the vibe    Now the food was delicious      Totally recommend if around the south side   Gracias  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,62,Cash only. Gorditas  5  other dishes are about  10 each. The gordita was huge and a full meal on its own. The meat was very tender but bland. On the flip side the beef from the soup and the pork in the chile colorado were bery flavorful but a little tough.  Super friendly staff.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,63,Loved this place  I live super close and I m sad I didn t know about it until recently. The chips that they give you are so perfectly warm and crunchy. I got a few tacos  but the best by far was the fish taco. It was one of the best I ve ever had  The service here is also so great  and everyone is super friendly. It s also extremely affordable  we spent less than  20 including a 20  tip for two people and walked away completely stuffed with leftovers    I can t wait to go back again soon 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,64,Amazing food and people     In a town saturated with taco joints this one stands out    We love it  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,65,Great quaint little Tex mex spot. I came here for lunch on a Saturday after flying all morning. We ordered family style  steak fajitas  fish tacos  and verde chicken enchiladas. All were delicious  Fajitas were reasonably priced and flavorful. Tacos were perfect and large in size. Enchiladas were great but would ve preferred shredded chicken rather than the cubes that came out. Their chips and salsa also so addicting  pico too.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,66,Pure excellence  The Habanero Mexican Cafe brings the heat with their salsa  Salsa is made with habanero   After landing shortly in Austin and checking into my location  the food hunger was kicking in. At first  my group didn t want to go to Habanero. It passed my eye test  I see a lot of people and a lot of locals eating here  that s good enough for me. After looking at a couple of other restaurants and verifying information on yelp  Habanero Mexican Cafe was the clear winner.  The food was very plentiful. Great place to eat if you are hungry. I tried a bit of everything. All of the food was good. What really bought the food to the next level was the salsa. Pour it on everything. If you don t like the heat or salsa  the food is going to taste meh. For habanero lovers  you can t get enough of it. It s so good that they come around refilling the salsa. That s a winner.   Cash only  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,67,Nice authentic place for lunch or dinner. Expect a wait during prime time. This place is cash only and does have an ATM. The service is good and quick. The habanero salsa is awesome and very spicy. I loved the Gordita. Perfect cook and texture 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,68,Edit  food was great but we drove an hour and a half to get a meal here and they were long since closed  an hour before what was listed on their site and here on yelp. Very bad business practice especially for a restaurant. They looked like they had been cleaned up for a long time even before that.   Started off with some really great-tasting salsa and chips. Place smelled wonderful while we waited for our food. I got the beef fajita ranchera  hot . My dad got the beef and chicken fajita. We both agreed they were the best fajitas we both ever ate. Other people got the enchiladas or tacos. Also were great. Found a great spot to get mexican in town. I actually ordered a second full entree because it was so good
Habanero Mexican Cafe,69,We have been ordering breakfast tacos from Habanero for many years.  Since last year  we call in and pick up our order.  Same great food and smiles with masks.  This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants in town   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,70,We usually eat Menudo from here and it s always so amazing but today I order Menudo and it tasted like it came straight out of a can
Habanero Mexican Cafe,71,I stand by everything I mentioned last time . It s still cash only.  Specifically I came back for the salsa and because a friend mentioned their Chile Relleno is god tier.  I agree with my friend . I got it with cheese and chicken and I think it s one of my favorites ever.  The salsa is soo freakin good and spicy. They have a habanero salsa too if you want to destroy your insides.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,72,Not bad  but bad at all...   Went to lunch there because a friend was in town and wanted Tex Mex... And I was in the mood to try someplace new... Found this place online and decided to give it a go.  On a Sunday around 11 am we were able to be seated right away but around 1130am  it started to fill up.... Not many seats in this place so get there early..  We decided to go for the chicken and beef fajitas... Spicy.   Well worth it... For my taste buds it was not  that spicy  just a little kick which is good... But my friend from  California said it was hot... Guess living in Austin has toughen my tolerance for heat.    It was good... Very good.  It came with beans   rice   guacamole  and a choice of corn or flour tortillas.  The fajitas came on a hot skillet  and on a bed of onions  peppers   and tomatoes.   All Good.   Be sure to bring cash   as they accept Credit Cards.. But there is an ATM in the lobby.    Parking is all around  very little up front but plenty out back.    We will be back.. They do a lot of business and it shows.. There was a line when we were leaving.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,73,Cash only  This is a teeny little place with a bunch of tables crammed in  so don t come here with your giant purse or luggage   Their hard beef taco is tasty  the enchiladas are okay  but the sauce is pretty good   and the tostada is just okay. The menudo was fine - I ve had better but this is still pretty tasty.  You pay up front  and service is great 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,74,If you re looking for that little  our  kind of place  the kind of place you take out of towners to to show them the real Austin  this is your place.  Hole in the wall  Check.  Line out the door  Check. Small  intimate space  Check. Killer Mexican food  Check and double check.   My wife and I shared the fajita platter for two. Beef. Took home a sizable portion. Guacamole with chunks of onion. Great. And French fries  yes  fries  covered with Queso. My son and daughter in law has the fajita tacos. And a word to the wise -- the salsa has a little kick to it.   Service was prompt  friendly and courteous. Iced tea refills were much appreciated.   And just a reminder  Habanero is cash only.   No credit cards. I m not sure if they take  checkS. There is  however  an ATM on site . Parking is available in a dedicated lot and on the street. And the people watching is fantastic.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,75,This place was just up the street from our Airbnb. We ordered the carne asada ranchera fajitas on three different occasions and they were amazing each tine. I order fajitas whenever we go Mexican restaurants that offer them and these are so good I feel I m ruined when we go back to California. Portion size is great  the seasoning is flavorful and their tortillas are fresh. Their salsa is also exceptional and my son ever liked his chicken quesadillas.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,76,My favorite Mexican breakfast spot in Austin  The caldo de res is so tasty I get it every time. The huevos racheros and migas are both great breakfast options. The salsa has a kick to it  I can never stop eating it  The service is always great when I go. There is a wait but it s never too long. This place is cash only but there is an atm on site.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,77,The most amazing green enchiladas and they are consistent. Their queso is great. I personally like adding the salsa to the queso - so good  I only wish they were open more
Habanero Mexican Cafe,78,Had my first ever torta experience here at Habanero s  It was so delicious  The bread has to be just right - fresh  soft and warm - this torta was right on the money. My chips and salsa were solid and service was great. I am a believer in the greatness that is the torta because of this place and plan to go back for many more 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,79,This place is CASH ONLY. The food is great. The service is great. My husband and his family are Mexican and we are from California  so they are critical of any supposed  authentic Mexican food.  The chips and salsa are amazing. I had cheese enchiladas and they were so moist and the sauce was so good and not tart. Other dishes were tortas  tacos  burritos and all were delicious according to the people that ate them. It s extremely humid here and there was hardly any cool air. The bathrooms were old and soap dispenser didn t work well. Other than the humidity heat  the food was really good.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,80,Best Breakfast Tacos in Austin. I m not lying. The potatoes are fries   Love this place  staff has always been great tho they are currently takeout only due to covid. They take cards now and always give a generous side of bacon for my pup   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,81,Best gorditas in Texas  Amazing fajitas and great carnitas. Everything I ve ever order has been great. Service is awesome too. Love this place.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,82,Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had     El pastor tacos  delicious Menudo soup   be warned that this is a huge serving. After eating most of it I could barely eat anything else Guacamole salad   Guac on iceberg with tortilla chips.  Very simple and not spectacular There was a breakfast taco with dried meat inside and that was very unique and delicious as well.  You basically can t go wrong with anything on this menu. Definitely check this place out  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,83,We love Habaneros but are very frustrated that they haven t made the accommodations to open dine in. I live to far to do take out  So we won t return until dine in is open  There has been plenty of time to figure this out. Everyone else is open.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,84,I recently decided to try this restaurant and I am glad that I did. The food is really good and affordable.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,85,It s a pretty cool  Cash Only spot. No Margaritas  chips and Salsa was good. Queso was awesome. The places closes at 5 00 pm and they shewed us away at 4 20. But get there early and the place may be better.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,86,This is the kind of hole in the wall place that I love  delicious food with big portions and cheap prices  You don t normally hear people talk about chips and salsa since it s normally pretty standard  but they had the freshest and crunchest chips and salsa I have had  the chips are so fresh it s still hot from the fryer  For entree  we got a beef taco  fish taco  and a beef fajita ranchera entree. The fish taco was very spicy but absolutely delicious  The beef taco was not as good as the beef as a little dry. The beef fajita was so hot and fresh  sizzling off the plate. It s served with rice  beans  guoc  and tortillas. The beans had bacon bits in it  so good  We ended up wrapping 3 tacos out of the plate  delicious 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,87,Mediocre. The beans were stiff. Too much salt on the fajita meat. Huevos rancheros were a hit. Too many chips in the Migas. Nice service. Pricing was fine but I wouldn t go back.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,88,Habanero has long been recommended to us by a very good friend with a refined palate.  I don t know why it took so long to try it out  sorry Roger.  Three items to remember  the food is excellent  the service is professional and fast  and they only take cash.  We were greeted by friendly faces  escorted to our table and our order taken promptly.  The chips and salsa  fabulous  and let s face facts  the chips are just a delivery system for the salsa .  Bam  a few minutes later  here is our food  fresh  hot and delicious.  The carne guisada  was just perfect  texture and taste.  Luckily  Habanero is on the other side of town  or we would weigh a thousand pounds.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,89,Habaneros is amazing I LOVE ALL THEIR MENU   The staff if very friendly and always helpful. I have been visiting Habaneros for the last 22yrs. Their Gorditas  tacos  menudo   and their breakfast plates are delicious.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,90,For my first Tex Mex experience  I must say this place knows what they are doing  Took my mom here for Mother s Day breakfast and didn t have to wait too long.   So many delicious options  I didn t know what to choose from. I ended up going for the Deluxe Ranchero Dish with Steak  they give you the option steak or pork chops .  The dish could have easily fed two people or one very hungry person. The steak was a nice thin piece of carne asada drenched in onions  peppers  and tomatoes. The over easy eggs were good to perfections  Refried beans had just the right amount of seasonings. Oh and I loved the french fries that it came with. I ordered it with the corn tortillas and made myself tacos with all the ingredients on my dish. The only down fall was the dish was overloaded and too wet on the bottom between the eggs and salsa from steak and veggies.  My mom  not liking eggs  got 2 bacon  guac  and potato taco and she was very satisfied and full. The tacos are regular sized  so two were good.  Husband got egg and chorizo plate and loved it as well.  Their coffee was not watery  - That right there is a star on its on  haha.  This place has the environment and everything. I will definitely be back when I am in town. If you are looking for a good Tex Mex breakfast spot I say give this place a try 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,101,One the weekday that I visited  it was crowded during the lunch hour.  Lots of locals and myself a tourist waited patiently for authentic Mexican food.  The wait was approximately 20 minutes  which seemed long to me because I was hungry and drooling watching all of the plates coming out of the kitchen.    During my wait  I was browsing through the menu and decided on the habanero burrito  8.95- deep fried large flour tortilla filled with ground beef  beans  cheese.  This comes with rice and ranchero sauce.  I normally don t have my burrito tortillas fried  but this was fried to a perfect lght crisp. The burrito was quite filling and I wasn t able to finish the sides. In addition   free chips and salsa came with my meal.  The salsa had a good kick of spice.  The food came out quick so the short wait was well worth it.  When you re done with your meal   your bill is paid at the counter. Cash only no credit cards.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,102,This place is a GEM. True Austin staple. Great Mexican food for cheap   10 and you ll be eating two meals. Very small joint that takes only cash and only open for brunch lunch everyday. Be prepared to wait if you come at noon on a weekend. Love their tacos and dishes. Lots of ppl get the soup too.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,103,Only been here once but I freaking LOVE this place  amp  can t wait to come back.   Cash only  which is usually a good sign.   The service is outstanding. None of the fake nice BS. They re courteous  prompt  amp  professional. My drink never emptied. Everything we ordered came out super fast. Also  the wait staff aren t kids.   Chicken fajitas were killer. Papas con queso was killer. Carne asada tacos were great. Fried cheesecake was good.   Awesome experience.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,104,My son and I were meeting in S Austin for a rare lunch  and I wanted to go somewhere neither of us had ever been  and I was craving Mexican food. The other major criteria was that it be a local restaurant  not a chain or somewhere with locations all over town. We decided on Habanero. I ordered the  2 Combo  he the Enchilada Plate. The waitstaff was friendly  and the chips and salsa soon arrived. The chips were disappointing  and though I can handle heat  the salsa was almost substituting heat for well-rounded flavor. Another disappointment as salsa is one of my life s blood. I then asked to taste their other salsa  the habanero. I don t know why I had to ask  in the first place  why not bring out both kinds to start with  especially since it s your namesake   and be given a funny look like I didn t know what I was talking about  geez  I m a Yelper    . The habanero was distinctly hotter  as expected  but did not have a good flavor at all. It s almost as if they took raw habanero and ground it up with some canned tomato sauce and said   here ya go.   Our meals arrived  mine had a crispy beef taco  which I have to admit--a Yelper s dirty little secret--is one of my favorite foods of all   and it was nondescript. Not bad  not great  just run-of-the-mill. On to the enchiladas. We both got ours with red sauce  which also was disappointing. It was kind of one-note. It wasn t a true ranchero or Tex-mex chili  more of a true Mexican type  but maybe just one type of dried red chile  Perhaps guijillo  I didn t ask so don t hold me to that    There was little if any cheese on top  and the sauce desperately needed either that or a dollop of Daisy. I have to say my veggie enchilada filling was delicious  my son s ground beef was pretty good  as was his cheese. My chicken enchilada  though  had large  dry chunks of white meat chicken instead of properly shredded and stewed. Is there any such thing as lazy enchiladas  If there are  then these were it. Refried beans and rice also typical and not note worthy. Charro beans  however  flavored with bacon and spice  were delicious. Habanero s seems to have gotten some good reviews--did I hit a bad day  I probably won t return to find outthere are way too many good Mexican restaurants in town.   Note   Cash only  and you don t get a ticket at the table but walk up to the register for your bill.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,105,So happy to finally try this small business    I ve tried practically every Tex-mex and Mexican food restaurants in South Austin  and this is my official go-to for enchiladas.  The taco my mom ordered was above average  I think I still prefer a few other spots for their tacos.  But if I m craving good old school Mexican food  I m typically craving enchiladas so this is my place.  I also tried their pork tamale  and that was the only item I didn t absolutely love but I m picky so you may enjoy them.  We went on a Saturday around brunch time and it was packed  but the wait was less than 10 minutes.  Must order   1. Enchiladas  the classic sauce with cheese brought back so many memories  2. Their spicy salsa   Item I wish they had  Jamaica    Important Tip  Cash only and check their hours
Habanero Mexican Cafe,106,I gotta say that this is the most reasonable and tasty Tex-Mex food that I have tried. It s one of my high school buddies favorite restaurant  and I can see why. First time I tried the Huevos Gringo which was two eggs over easy  topped with spicy queso and a side of carne guisada and French fries and retried beans. That was so yummy and made my morning breakfast. My wife had the breakfast tacos with was chorizo and scrambled eggs.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,107,It was just aight...we went here for lunch and got here a little before 12 which was good because the hipster seemed to pack it up after that. There is a mixed crowd overall it seems like  and of course as most other reviews have stated - CASH only but they have an ATM inside  how handy .   i got their two mini  burritos with shrimp and lengua. The plate was covered in melted cheese on the bottom  which was a delight. The rice was a bit dry and not very palatable. The beans were bland and the salsa didn t stick out for me. It was a very good price for the amount of food you got  but I guess I am not seeing why it got such high reviews as the flavor was overall lacking for me. Perhaps I got the wrong thing - I would try to go back again and try something different.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,108,My family came here for lunch today during a quick trip into Austin. We honestly almost turned around and went elsewhere when we saw the Cash Only sign on the door but it had such good reviews that we decided to try it anyway.   First  the lunch specials are awesome and very cheaply priced. We didn t end up getting them but for the price  we should have. My husband got the enchiladas and I got the Carne Guisada. He loved his food though it was a bit spicy for him. I absolutely loved my Carne Guisada. It actually tasted the way my grandmother makes it. The rice was authentic and the beans had a ton of flavor. The salsa that came with our chips and salsa was amazing and tasted very fresh as well which is a pretty big deal to me.   Overall  we had an amazing  filling lunch that even my 1 year old son was able to eat his fill of and we ended up spending less than  20. We will definitely be back in to eat next time we are in town.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,109,One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Austin. Excellent food  very affordable pricing  lovely staff  great quaint atmosphere. Been coming here for a decade and it always performs.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,110,The food was fine.  They don t have any mild salsa here at all.  It s cash only. Seem like nice folks.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,111,I kind of don t want to tell people about this place because it might get more crowded  but it s too good not to.  I ve been here many times for breakfast brunch and every time has been delicious. They have some of the best refried beans I ve ever had-- if it was socially acceptable to just order a bowl of those I totally would. I ve tried a few different things on their menu depending on my mood  Breakfast tacos  enchiladas  and some breakfast combos  and have never been disappointed.   They usually have a long-ish wait on the weekends if you go later than 8 or 9  but it s well worth it. Enjoy 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,112,Still the best Tex-Mex in Austin after all these years.  I came in solo for a late breakfast and received very attentive service from start to finish.  I ordered  l Patr n with over easy eggs and flour tortillas.  The eggs were perfectly runny and tasted perfect with the ranchero sauce.  Tortillas were fresh  steak was tender  refritos were reliable  and papas fritas were flavorful and crisp.  It was so good  I might go back tomorrow morning.  Setting an early alarm right now...
Habanero Mexican Cafe,113,Family-owned TexMex joint that s been around for 20 years.  Beware though - cash only  although there is an ATM on site .  No frills breakfast and lunch place for good food at a great price. Oh yeah  breakfast available anytime 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,114,Habanero Cafe is everything you could ever ask for in a Mexican restaurant. From the moment you walk in you know this place is gonna be authentic. As for the food  it was amazing  I got the Burrito Plate with fajita meat which was a great sized portion. The steak had this nice rich seasoning on it that made it absolutely addicting  To drink  I had a fresh squeezed limeade which was real sweet  amp  refreshing. The price was definitely worth it at only  8.95  The food came out pretty fast and the service was good. Overall  I left highly satisfied 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,115,We walked in and saw the signs everywhere saying cash only-so we hit up the ATM they provide. Every single person who worked there was incredibly friendly and kind. The Saturday morning crowd was steady but not super cramped.  You can tell it s a place visited by locals and folks wanting an unpretentious breakfast taco.  Prices are incredibly coat friendly. I saw that the horchata is only served Friday through Thursday so we put in an order for some. Our waitress only brought out one and boy was I glad because the vessel it came in was humongous. Really sweet and super cinnamony.  Would I come here again. Maaaaaaybe every once in a blue moon. Go for a low key  cheap breakfast. I ll probably hit it up during the week for one of their super affordable lunch special.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,116,First time here and ordered the Verde Enchiladas w  chicken  tomatillo sauce and white cheese sauce  nice and light no  Cut into this thing and my chicken is red and super salty  Asked the manager on duty what the what the hay with the red chicken in a verde dish  and her response was  we only make one type of chicken here . Sounds like a mucho lazy kitchen and that chicken was probably from the day before.  Finito with this joint.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,117,Delicious       This place is so popular that there s a little bit of a wait  but is totally worth it.  Once you are sitted  the service is super fast. We ordered huevos rancheros and menudo. Both incredibly tasty and traditional   Oh and the prices are very reasonable.   Will definitely come back 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,118,Awesome little spot in Austin  the food is delicious  great tortillas for the tacos. Serves beer  and cash only. Very lovely spot 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,119,The food is under cooked  I hope I don t get sick. I should have returned the plate but the server didn t looked like she could be trusted. Even the manager looked sketchy. This place doesn t accept credit cards. It s cash-only  For a good reason  they are liars and cheaters. They will swindle you after they serve you that cat food. Yeuchhh    Don t go here. There are many good Mexican restaurants on S Congress and S 1st Street. Try any other place  not here 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,120,Best breakfast tacos in the 78704. Growing up around border town taquerias can spoil you and finding a restaurant that could give life long favorites a run for their money has been one of the best parts of fooding now that we life in Austin. Price for quality is basically unbeatable in the area 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,121,Best Mexican food in the area. Top notch goodness. Enchiladas are great. The salsa is homemade and has awesome flavor. Also  love the lemonade. Highly recommend. Don t forget to bring cash  CC is not accepted.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,122,This place gets packed. I ll put some pointers before the review of their actual food   - lines get long and you can be waiting up to 30 minutes - they close early on weekdays M-TH - cash only  They have an atm inside though  I got the Barbacoa plate and it came with beans  rice  lettuce  pico  guacamole  two flour tortillas and a lot of Barbacoa. The meat was definitely juicy and cooked just like how Barbacoa should be 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,123,This is my favorite hole-in-the-wall texmex restaurant in Austin. The food is outstanding. Absolutely love the tacos for lunch. Fresh chips and salsa are excellent appetizer. I ve got to warn you though  they know how to turn up the spice - but only if you ask just right.  The service here is friendly  the only drawbacks that exist are this. 1. They only accept cash. 2. There is always a large line at noon. So if you are in a rush  go somewhere else. Otherwise  enjoy 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,124,The service here is extremely friendly  I have always been greeted enthusiastically and with a big smile as soon as I walk in the door  and then immediately helped by my server when I sat down.   You get a great amount of food for the price. I love the enchilada plates here    Keep in mind it is cash only  but they have an arm inside.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,125,A south Austin staple for Tex Mex. We live in the neighborhood and go there religiously for Sunday lunch. This place has the best Caldo de Res hands down. Not only in Austin  but anything San Antonio can produce. Every option is solid  but do yourself a favor and try the carne guisada. It s a slow cooked beef in a rich gravy and can be eaten in a tortilla  over eggs  or really any way that just gets in your mouth.   The place is small and cash only so if you are there during prime hours prepare to wait. Although small  the wait staff are super fast and efficient. Your drinks are always filled and the food flys out of the kitchen.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,126,Super good service and the food is excellent. I had the soup and it was the best I ever had
Habanero Mexican Cafe,127,We decided to give this place a try since they have nice reviews on Yelp. This is a small place with somewhat limited seating. The chips and salsa are fantastic and I tend to judge restaurants on their chips and salsa.  The salsa has some heat and nice flavor  A .  I ordered the fajitas rancheras which are the typical fajitas but these are cooked with jalape os.  The fajitas were tender and had a ton of flavor.  When I first tried the rice my initial reaction was  wow  the rice is the best .  The charro beans were good too with plenty of flavor.  They only gave me two tortillas but I asked for more and the waitress brought them.  The wife ordered the carne guisada and she loved it.  She had the same thoughts about the rice and beans.  We both would come back for lunch or dinner.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,128,Amazing  I m part of a biggest loser at my job but this lunch special was amazing  Its a cash only restaurant but so worth it. The salsa had a kick  beware. Highly recommend
Habanero Mexican Cafe,129,Love the breakfast tacos  Love the service  Have been twice for breakfast and have not been disappointed. We re from Arizona and this place has Mexican food like we re used to. So far haven t found a dinner place in Austin that s like home. Know it s all what you re used to but not into Tex Mex. Habanero is only open till 3 so will have to come and try lunch one day but I m guessing I ll love whatever I order. Must try the Xangos  great dessert  We will definitely be back during our 3 month stay in Austin.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,130,This place is a great hole-in-the-wall that makes much  much better than average Mexican fare  which is saying  a lot  in Austin. The salsa is as good as people say and the chicken fajitas are basically the best I ve ever had. The only thing to be aware of is that there  will  be a line at lunch starting around 11 45a.  I got the chicken fajitas rancheras which came out with spicy peppers and onions in addition to all the normal stuff. The chicken itself was all white meat and beautifully seasoned to the point that it was streaked orange. I will definitely be back.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,131,When I think home made tex mex breakfast I think habaneros  This place has a cozy   at your grandmas house kitchen feel. The staff are always so kind and always working so fast   you never have to worry about the service or your glass being empty   Food is always fresh and consistent I am in love with there menudo   caldo de res   and tripa tacos  amp  salsa. With so many places to try breakfast at in Austin this one will always have you coming back   no one can make it like them  I have been coming here for many years and I m so glad they have not changed a thing .
Habanero Mexican Cafe,132,Never disappoints  great for breakfast  Try finding taquitos at these prices  you won t 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,133,I ve recently ordered the Chile Relleno plate a couple times for delivery via Uber Eats  and it is the best Chile Relleno I have ever had.  I also ordered chips  salsa  and flash-fried jalapenos  all of which are delicious 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,134,Portions are large and prices good but food just ok. I was hoping for more  I guess. Place was clean and service exceptional. Menudo was a little  off . That said  the Chili relleno was especially good.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,135,1  Best egg and chorizo breakfast taco I ve ever put into my mouth. I think I may have glimpsed nirvana  very briefly.  2  Huge servings at a reasonable price.  3  Delicious chips and salsa. Delicious beans and rice.  4  Iced horchata is not my cup of ... Horchata. Kind of very cinnamony and I guess some people really like that.  5  Fried burrito what the what  So good.  6  Love the atmosphere here. It s like grandmas house turned restaurant with sassy but very efficient service - my favorite kind  D  7  Bonus points for alleviating my hangover.  Come and eat and coma and be happy.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,136,My go to place for Mexican food  make sure to bring cash  but they have an ATM inside if you forget.  Everything is good here  but my favorite is the Menudo  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,137,Came here with my wife and father in law during the holiday. Extremely friendly staff with amazing service. Water cups  complimentary chip baskets  and salsa were frequently refilled and were never empty. We started with the light corn tortilla chips with salsa then added great queso and guacamole.  I ordered 3 tacos  tripas  barbacoa  and chicharones  along with a beef fajita gordita. Tripas was hot and crispy  like I expected the chicharone to be  and was my favorite of the meal. Barbacoa was my second favorite and was very moist and flavorful.  The chicharone had a soft texture like I expected the tripas to have  and only managed to take two bites. We finished off the meal with the best horchata I ve ever had  Will be back every time I m in Austin.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,138,2.5 stars. For a place called Habenero  the food sure was bland. First restaurant I ve tried while visiting Austin from Atlanta  and I m totally not impressed. Had the fish gordita and tried the chile relleno and both lacked seasoning and weren t served hot enough. The salsa was good though.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,139,Hot frickin diggity dog. I mean...first and foremost I want to THANK ALL THE YELPERS OUT THERE WHO HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WITH THE REVIEWS       I am so totally stoked right now. Yes...I know I get overly excited about food...sorry.   This was  hands down  the BEST Tex Mex  I ve had in Austin. I don t venture food in south Austin too terribly much  for no reason except...I m not down there as often as I am up north. So..if it hadn t been for yelp and the great reviews...I never would have known..  Ahhh. .  Honestly  there is nothing more to can say that has not already been said.  Its small. 13 tables.  Street parking Back end parking  which is by the pool that we swam in after eating   -  Fabulous prices HUGE portions  my kids split a plate and still took some home... So did I  Service couldn t get any better than it was. Staff was super friendly  warm  helpful  and catered to a new comer..which I always appreciate.  We ended up getting 2 baskets of chips... Both free. Not sure why   Because it does say second is extra.. Hubs and I both ordered the habanero burrito with beef and the kiddos got the flauta plate. We ordered a side of queso  and sopapillas  sp.   Chips were so delicate and thin...and crisp.. And warm...mmmm. The salsa.. Good god.  It was delicious. It packed a punch  for me  but I m a wuss when it comes to heat.. Even tho I like it. Salsa was so bold. Damn.  It really was delicious.  Burritos were fantastic. Not greasy  full of beef  bean  cheese... And above all...flavor    And HUGE. The rice alone was delicious. I know rice should be a no brained  but its not at many places.  It is easily jacked up and lacks flavor.  Not this one. Even my son was commenting on how  good the rice is mommy just all by itself.  Came with lettuce  pico... And ranchero sauce on the side.   The ranchero sauce also tasted fabulous.. But too hot for me. Hubs ate all his..I had to take mine.   Kids flauta plate.. They got chicken.  Wow. Chicken is great. Full of flavor  plentiful  and tender and juicy. Man it was good...yup I tried it. Had to. Had to try their beans by themselves too ...also delicious.  Their plate came with rice  beans  guacamole  sour cream and lettuce .. All of it was fantastic. Nothing overdone in salt to help flavor it.  The flavor was there without the salt.   Queso was norm...it was good.   Sopapillas were delicious  although I found them to be a little too well done for my liking  but they were still super good.   It was really memorable. I mean.. I   feel as though my hunt for TeX Mex has come to an end. Finally. After years of searching. And my son keeps telling me we have to go back. He loves the food as much as we did. And we will be back. For sure.   THANKS AGAIN...   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,140,This place really has it going for Mexican food. One for the price you get some great quality at an affordable price. They have some very nice lunch specials. All I know was that I full by the time I left this place. There flour tortillas are delicios. Now for the menudo quality I was very impressed. One a lot places don t drain the water from the meat on the initial boil and well it gives it that nasty smell and taste. This place it was definitely worth trying. As for parking space it was pretty tight parking in back but you can park on the street. You definitely need to get her 20 minutes prior the lunch rush. Overall this one great tasting Mexican food place 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,141,I absolutely love this place  Fast service  reasonably priced  and the food is always amazing. The line can get long on the weekends but it s worth the wait.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,142,Fresh and hot   REALLY great Tex-Mex.  Salsa is a little too spicy hot for my liking--had to add lime juice to tone it down.  Wish they would open one on the north side. Cash only.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,143,Very good food and the work are good people. We been come here for year. Good place . A big place alot people come here
Habanero Mexican Cafe,144,It was just okay. I m a big fan of authentic Mexican food  and sometimes will eat Tex Mex. Chose this location because it seemed like it would be a good mix of the two and I was feeling some Tex Mex hangover food. I got the bean cheese nachos  and my partner got the verde enchiladas  both of which were bland. It really wasn t anything to write home about  which was a let down considering all the good reviews on here.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,145,3.5 stars Yes  it is cheap. Yes  it is awesome portions. Bring cash.   The barbacoa and lengua taco I had were pretty good-- I feel like they lacked in flavor a bit. The fajitas were pretty stellar in taste and texture-- they would be 4 stars if that s all I had.   I m not sure I found something worth waiting for in my order.  The queso was not good at all- avoid ordering this here.  Venue is small so try to come with a party of 4 or less.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,146,Great tasting tacos and friendly service. Coffee is good and hot and the cooked salsa is excellent.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,147,Really good. One of my faves. The salsa is hot and the queso is good too. Be prepared-cash only.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,148,Plan on waiting for a table in this intimate  small  restaurant. Service is always adequate but never overwhelming. The food however is a standout. Today we had Carne Guisada and Migas  both were huge plates loaded with the entree. The Migas were huge and fresh with just enough peppers and tomato with onion and chips. It easily filled the 3 delicious corn tortillas and left the eater well filled and content. The Carne was delicious with soft pieces of meat swimming in a beautiful gravy that had a hint of Cumin. The sides of refried beans and rice were very good and not overwhelming on the plate. The guacamole was fresh and generous in serving. Overall an excellent meal that is highly recommended.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,149,I always try fajitas at every New Mexican restaurant I go to.  Theirs were delicious  I like them spicy and they did not disappoint.  I only have two recommendations for this restaurant   1. Open a location North  2. Add some variation to the fajitas  of course at an additional price 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,150,Great food and friendly service.    If you are looking for great Tex-Mex  look no further 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,151,After wanting to try this place for a long time  I m sad to say I was very disappointed in the food.  The waitstaff was pleasant enough  and the steak quesadillas were passable.  The enchiladas that my brother had  and the carne asada I ordered were truly awful.    I don t typically write negative reviews  but I truly cannot understand all of the praise that this place is receiving.  With so many excellent options nearby  I can see no reason for returning to this restaurant.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,152,Super legit Mexican restaurant. They close early  but if you can make it for breakfast or lunch do so  They also have yummy caldo on the weekend. It s definitely a great spot to hit up during weekday mornings.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,153,I had heard great things about this place  but I found the service and the food to be very disappointing. Our waitress brought us chips  salsa  waters and menus when we arrived.....and then she disappeared for 20 minutes. When I saw her again  I asked if we could order. She said  sure  i ll be back in just a minute.  She was gone for another 20 minutes. We FINALLY ordered our food and it took a long time to arrive.  The food was sub-par. I ordered chicken fajitas. They were supposed to be served over a bed of onion and peppers......the onions were BURNT so black they were inedible. The peppers were RAW. The chicken was ok  but wasn t really cut properly for fajitas. Given the wait  I had been hoping for some great food  but this food was just gross.   Everything about this place was a disappointment.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,154,My favorite Friday night spot.   We love that they know our drink order before we get to the table   and the chips and queso comes right after.  Great friendly staff   and best food anywhere...  Worth the drive.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,155,Super cute  intimate interior and the food is excellent   I had the taco plate  beef fajita and carnitas  and oh. my. god.  If I m ever in Austin again I ll definitely be back  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,156,Okay lets just keep it real this place is always packed for a reason  because they have delicious food. The thing i most love about this place that a lot of TexMex Mex restaurants around Austin lack is proper seasoning. Their portions are great  the price is right  and the food is tasty. One of the things I most recommend are the gorditas because they are filled to burst with the protein of your choice and just delicious. All the times I have gone all the servers have been really nice  attentive  and ready to help. The only thing missing is aguas frescas that s why im rating it a 4 instead of 5 stars. Also be ready to sit in a small tight room and maybe wait a couple of minutes in line. Overall great good  great service  and a definite recommend.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,157,BRUNCH REVIEW   I met up with some friends to sample this tiny little place because they said it is their favorite place.  There is plenty of street parking and they also have a small parking lot behind the restaurant.  This place is cash only but  they do have an ATM inside.  There is only about 15 to 20 tables so you may have to wait.  We were seated in the front space right next to the windows which I thought was the best seat in the restaurant.  They have traditional Mexican fare as well as more traditional breakfast items.  The menu is pretty expansive and I heard their beef soup is amazing that they have on Saturday and Sunday only so  I will be back to try it.  The salsa was spicy but  not overly pureed and delish.  I ordered the barbacoa plate with flour tortillas and it was around  8.00.  Wow that barbacoa was good.  Personally I get disappointed with restaurants barbacoa often so  this was a pleasant surprise.  The beans  rice  pico and guacamole were all on point.  I love good food for great prices 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,158,This place is so much better than any other mexican restaurants in this area  or you may say in Austin . The seats are pretty limited and crowded  it may be a downside for some people  but the price and the food made it up   The salsa is FANTASTIC  Horchata is one of the best I have ever had  not too sweet  and not powder ish like other places. We waited for approximately 20 minutes until we get seated on a Friday night.   The beef tongue plate was very delicious  the portion is decent and def will leave you some to take home.   Definitely will come back 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,159,Lovely mom and pap place.  Food prepared is very tasty  generous plates.  I had beef and chicken fajitas.  It was amazing.  Also tried sopapillas and it was delicious too.  Just have to remember it s cash only and they close at 5pm on Saturdays.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,160,I ve been coming to Habanero Cafe since it opened which was when I was a teenager  I lived 2 mins away. Arthur has had the same staff all these years and  they have always been amazing everytime. I now drive an hour away to come here. Now if I do that you know the food is absolutely worth it   Best Mexican food in Austin til this day
Habanero Mexican Cafe,161,We were headed out to breakfast at Phoebe s diner and found this gem next door. The service is awesome  and the breakfast is too. Super affordable and you can get anything on the menu at 9am  gotta love it. Great vibe.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,162,I stopped in one Saturday morning to get breakfast tacos who had the craving for barbacoa  carne guisada  and other yummy tacos. The person at the counter was friendly  the order was filled fast  and the tacos were delicious.  The next day I stopped by to get a couple more tacos  and the chicken fajita and al pastor tacos were just as good.  I appreciate a good family run restaurant  and the food here isn t to be missed. Anyone who proclaims to love tacos should check this place out.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,163,My tacos were ok. They need to clean up the ladies bathroom. The toilet seat is about to fall off. Poor lighting in the women s bathroom. However   My husband really LOVED his enchilada  amp  ground beef taco. And he loved the salsa bc it was hot. It didn t have chopped up tomatoes.  This place only takes cash.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,164,Today its been the first day there after reading reviews in yelp...way better than any restaurant near by...had chicken fajita ranchero....its awesome and i would recommend for the people who can go for higher spicy level....not for kids though....people working there are nice people....you may have some wait time during lunch time but will gauranty you the nice food....
Habanero Mexican Cafe,165,Every thing good except she Clean chair with floor broom In Front of me . That s sucks
Habanero Mexican Cafe,166,Wife and I had the chicken enchiladas  taco ranchero s and queso. Everything was servers quickly and was delicious. Friendly staff and affordable prices. We will be back.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,167,Why  Why must this place be so far from my house   I have searched far and wide in Austin for a really  really  really amazing tex-mex place and I found it. I have been to Habanero several times and each time I am more impressed than the last.  First let s discuss the most important thing  it s cheap. Probably a good place to take a date that you re not sure you are into yet. Everything on the menu is super affordable and the portions are huge so those of you who don t eat much will probably have leftovers. You re getting like a 2 for 1 deal here.  Moving on  the food tastes great. The chips and salsa are delicious. I have had the enchiladas  the breakfast tacos and the flautas. I am obsessed with all 3. The rice and beans  which I am critical of because I have a grandma who knows her way around the kitchen  are super flavorful. The tortillas taste super fresh and homemade. The food is always fresh and hot right out of the kitchen. I am craving it as I am writing this review.  The service is awesome  all the servers are super friendly and I promise you won t ever have to ask for a refill on your drink or your chips. The place is small so getting seated can sometimes take some waiting but I have never experienced a super long wait.  I love Habanero  and drive all the way from North Austin to South Austin just to get my hands on the food. Will be returning time and time again 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,168,Not the worst food in the world but def not the best. The waitress was nice but super busy and the restaurant was quite small and a little dirty. I ordered the chicken flautas. They were really bland. My dad ordered the veggie enchaladas with green sauce and the waitress ensured us that the beans and rice were vegetarian friendly. His food was way better than mine but still sub par. The hot sauce and chips were probably the best part but they charge you extra if you ask for more chips. And I also ordered the Limanade which was not as good as it sounds. I will not be returning.   P.S. Don t forget your cash  they don t take credit
Habanero Mexican Cafe,169,I didn t like it. Don t go here  cause I may not be able to get a table next time.   We were looking for a good Mexican joint on a Wednesday afternoon. Took a look at Yelp and this had great reviews. It was a bit out of the way  but what the heck.  OMG. It s a small place but the food. Oh  the food. I live in Texas and have tried all the hot places. This blows them out of the water.  Chip and spicy salsa. No mild salsa here. Yum.  I had tacos.  My husband had the gringo burrito.  SO GOOD.  I had to get back to Austin this week and couldn t make it there before they closed at 3 or I would ve eaten there.  Try it. But not when I m in town so I can always get a table.   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,170,Habanero is amazing. Simply put. The food is just great  especially the beef and chicken fajitas. Very flavorful and fresh. Portions are a great size and if you get a horchata on the weekend  be warned  it is delicious  but HUGE  I have often been left longing for more when it comes to most Mexican restaurants  but I have never had that feeling here. The staff is ridiculously friendly and hardworking. It s a mom and pop type place with the same people there almost every day  so they really know their stuff. I wish that their hours were longer on the weekdays  but it s understandable being that they are such a small establishment.   I see a lot of people complain about the fact that they are cash only  but the prices are VERY reasonable  and they are trying to keep it that way. It is certainly worth the incredibly small inconvenience  I have a lot of respect for a place like this  they seem to really care about their customers and are proud of what they serve.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,171,This place sucks plain and simple  The staff dont speak English Food is Bad..The owner is a idiot who has no business running a restaurant stay away unless you like shitty Mexican food and people who dont speak English and dont know how to take an order..
Habanero Mexican Cafe,172,A co-worker told me about the fajita special at this place so I tried it today.   5.95 Fajitas Rancheras on Wednesdays   They were delicious but..... watch out  the hot sauce and fajitas rancheras are hot as hell.  My friend who went with me doesn t like hot food at all but for some reason I looked up and all the hot sauce on the table was gone   So apparently the hot sauce is hot but in a good way   The kind where you just drink some more water just so you can keep on eating it    I agree with other reviewer s comments   PROS   Good food  great service  large portions  cheap prices   CONS   Small place  no place to put your purse even    limited parking  But overall  I couldn t say one bad thing about this place.  I will definitely be back 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,173,Everytime we come to Austin we eat here.  Small little restaurant...really good authentic mexican food. Always a wait...but always worth this. Lots of flavor...very yummy 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,174,OH MY GOD. i m still at the restaurant as i m typing this review. i just couldn t wait  This place is BOMB. 3 things though  they only take cash  close at 4  and charge  3 for sharing plates  but there s ways around this . If you order another thing  we ordered extra tortillas since they only gave us 4 for a HUGE plate of meat  then that can count as another item you won t get charged  3 for sharing. Anyways  the meat is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING  we had chicken quesadillas and they blew me away. the chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful. honestly the best quesadilla i ve ever had. we ordered the beef fajita ranchera for 2 - but really it feeds 4 people. their salsa is SPICY. BUT ADDICTING  Even their chips were perfectly crispy  do yourself a favor Please try this place if you haven t already. it s going to be my go-to mexican restaurant from now on and I m going to bring everyone here too 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,175,This place is usually mobbed  and has a very high turnover rate.  Yet the wait for a table is always worth it.  The kitchen turns out consistent  perfect veggie enchiladas every time.  The waitresses are nice and the food comes quickly.  This is my favorite Tex-Mex in Austin  or anywhere for that matter.    Nearby competitors  Torchy s   ridiculous white people food.  Polvo s   love their salsa bar and chips  great food  but the music sucks and so does the clientele.   Curra s   overrated  overcrowded and loud.    Habanero is my no bullshit  old school mom and pop Tex-Mex paradise 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,176,I stopped by for breakfast since it has amazing reviews and almost 5  stars. This place left a lot to desire and was most definitely not worth the 20-25 minute wait. Now I must admit maybe it s because I m Hispanic I can be very picky about Mexican but this is a far cry from Mexican. I got a Tripas taco and beef fajita ranchera Gordita. The taco was good nothing special that I could have not gotten at a taco stand. The Gordita was just a hot mess. It wasn t even a Gordita more of a sandwich. All of the beans  yellow cheese  fajitas  lettuce  fresh tomatoes  and roasted tomatoes was just too much.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,177,This place is the best. I ve been stopping by this place on the weekends for the past 5 years and it s the only place that has consistently been so good. The staff is super friendly and the service is quick. Don t be discouraged by the amount of people waiting for a table  it s worth the wait.  Like literally everything here is good. Seriously  put your phone away and drive over to Habanero right now.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,178,This might be the best mexican food in Austin. Aside from the limited hours during the week and lack of margaritas  this place features delicious food and ridiculously low prices. Everything is at least  1-2 dollars cheaper than Chuy s or Matt s El Rancho and seemingly much better quality. Parking is almost non-existent out front  so check the rear where there s ample. The place is kinda small so if you re coming with a larger group  you might be waiting awhile for seating to become available.   I got the chicken Chili Relleno and it was fantastic. The entire poblano pepper was fried in egg batter  because this is Texas  and was probably one of the best ones I ve ever had. Their salsa is also quite good although they unfortunately charge  1.50 for chip refills. So be careful about binge-eating chips.   As a heads up  you pay at the front counter when you re done  not at the table. Hopefully that saves you from awkwardly sitting and wondering where the check is.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,179,Friendly service plus delicious and affordable Mexican food.  Greatly enjoyed every part of the Patron  which is essentially huevos rancheros with steak.  The chorizo and egg breakfast taco was delicious without being overpowering   too spicy.  Great retried beans  guacamole  and tortillas.  Top to bottom great.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,180,100  best classic Mexican food in Texas  Great service. Nice casual atmosphere. Service is always quick and friendly. It is cash only but that s not a huge problem plus everything is so reasonably priced. I love their cheese enchiladas and they have the best salsa so flavorful and great spice level. Definitely my go to spot highly suggest
Habanero Mexican Cafe,181,This is THE place to get Menudo in austin. Best in town  Perfect balance of meat and hominy. Nice red color to the broth and seasoned with herbs perfectly. We drive all the way from marble falls just to get a bowl  and its worth it every time.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,182,    Cash only  cash only  cash only         The bestie and I stopped here for dinner after ACL.  Did a search for Tex-Mex in the area  and I decided we should try this place. I m pleased to report that my fellow Yelpers didn t let me down   The restaurant is cozy  read  cramped   and when it s not busy  the staff just points out where you can sit. We sat on the patio--it s enclosed  so you can see everything  but you won t die in the Texas heat. The staff was friendly and efficient  and got us our drinks right away.   Menu options are plentiful and cheap  a good combination  My friend had the chicken fajitas  and I had the chicken fajitas rancheras. So delicious  with just the right amount of spicy kick  We were hungry  but not enough for a big dinner  so we each just one fajita. We also both ordered a soft drink  and with tip  we each spent  5     Score  I d definitely come back the next time I m in Austin. There were several options on the menu that I d love to try.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,183,I ve been eating here for over 5 years now. I ve celebrated two birthdays here  and I always make it a point to take friends from out of town here.  Habanero has been the most consistently delicious restaurant in my entire time in Austin. I have never had anything short of an amazing meal here. Ever.  Chicken verde or chicken supremas enchiladas are fantastic. Their rub seasoning on the chicken is flavorful and worth attempting to emulate at home. Every single soul that works here is supremely kind.  Fajitas are also so so delicious. Horchata is perfect with their homemade salsa. Lemonade will rejuvenate you in a hurry. I consistently over-tip here because of how enjoyable every meal is.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,184,Ok  so I must admit I m not a huge proponent of Tex-mex. I understand it s a local cuisine but I m not supremely partial to it because most places really do it half heartedly. Habanero is not one of those places. This is a fantastic eatery focused on food quality and a great esteem for service. This is a great spot to meet with smaller groups. Seating can get a tough tight because it s almost always full of happy diners. Try it out if you haven t been.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,185,Large portions of delicious food. Fast  friendly service. Cash only but totally worth it. Will be sure to put into regular rotation. Amazing
Habanero Mexican Cafe,186,The best little Tex Mex lunch cafe in town. Be sure to bring cash. Go for the Chicken Enchiladas Verdes  most people love their Charro beans but I go for refried beans so I can dip some of those crispy chips in it.  Not touristy at all  I like to bring out of town guests here. Still feels like a South Austin authentic spot.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,187,Came here for breakfast the other weekday morning  and arrived about 11 am. The tables were nealy full already. Of course thats not too hard to do there  since there are only 13 tables. As the other reviews stated  it is super small  so if you don t mind sitting on your neighbors lap  you ll be fine.  The chips and salsa were tasty. The huevos rancheros plate I ordered with a side of beef fajitas was excellent. Although the fajitas were a little on the salty side  but tender for sure. The rice and beans were decent  and tortillas were really good.  The service was excellent  Never had to ask for a refill  and the food came out fast  almost too fast..But understanding that they need to get people in and out because of the limited space  explains a lot.   Overall  I am a fan..Can t wait to try something else on the menu.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,188,Wonderful Mexican food  very authentic. We had the carne guisada and beef fajitas  both were very tasty. Highly recommended  we waited 20 mins on a Sat afternoon but well worth it.  To bring cash.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,189,The first time I came here  I was extremely let down. I had their cheese enchiladas with red sauce and did not enjoy it. The second time I came here  I had their tacos  which were so much better than the enchiladas. Their tacos are some of the best tacos I ve had  Overall  the food was very authentic including the chips and salsa 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,190,We have  come here in the past and had really good service but this time was horrible . We ordered the lunch special and we asked if it had jalape os in and she said no it comes on the side . When we received our plate it was full of jalape os . We asked if she could remake it without jalape os and she gave us a dirty look and brought  a side order of fajitas.  All she had to do is take the plate back we make it without jalape os and that could ve been a done deal 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,191,I have been coming to this place for several years .... today is my last    The  owners daughter refused to accommodate me as a customer  The food was beyond eatable so  hot to the taste u could not enjoy   I Asked if I could get something else and the owners daughter said no that I ordered it and that was that  Wow  I was in disbelief with the lack of customer service given by this Establishment  I will never EAT there again  So here is a warning to all my friends and Limon Family    Later on The owners daughter responded to my post and said she tried to reach out to me and that was a lie.  I would not recommend this place
Habanero Mexican Cafe,192,The food was amazing  I had the fajitas.  I usually can tell if its gonna be good by the salsa. If they can t get the salsa right chances are the food won t be good. Let me tell you this was probably one of the best salsas I ve ever had  The service was great  amp  the food was delicious  I would definitely co.e back next ti.e I m in Austin. Only disappointing thing was they don t serve margaritas.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,193,My new favorite place. Small  not noisy and delicious food. I had the veggie enchiladas  best I ve ever had . My husband had the chicken fajitas. So tender and tasty  Even the beans and rice were great. We will definitely be back.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,194,First time ever that i have felt the need to review a restaurant i found using yelp.   The food was amazing. I started with the chips and salsa which they charge for at breakfast but its worth the charge. They were great. I ordered the Roberto s special.  It was amazing. I don t usually like refried beans at most mexican restaurants but these were very good. Had a minor communication problem with ordering flour not corn tortillas this was promptly fixed.  Definately eat there if you are in south austin you wont regret it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,195,My fiance and I come here every weekend. He gets menudo  I get caldo. The meat is consistently soft  no matter what time of day we order. The tortillas need time to cool  they re so fresh. All of the ladies are so friendly and efficient.  Lucy is a waitress that knows us by name and knows our order  she brings out 2 waters and a coffee and knows we don t need a menu to look at.  The hardest part about eating here is wanting to try something new but knowing what we like is so consistently good  I have ventured out and gotten the barbacoa  guisada  tacos  enchiladas and it s all so delicious.  It is cash only  but there is an atm inside the building. This place can never disappoint.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,196,I love this place  It s definitely greasy Tex-Mex and not something you can really eat everyday  but for what it is  it s great  Everytime I go there I am impressed by the flavors.  Thanks to Yelp  I knew that it was cash only the last time I was there BUT I was hoping to use their ATM..however  it was broken. We asked if we could pay with card and they obliged. This was only a month or so after the switch so not sure if they re still accepting CC s in a bind but I know to bring cash just in case. I do wish they could accept CC s  something basic like Square but I totally understand why cash would be better. It still doesn t impact my choice to go there.  I usually always get their  2 red enchiladas and a beef taco. The beef taco isn t anything fabulous but it often hits the spot. Horchata is GIGANTIC and awesome.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,197,Great tea  queso  salsa and fresh tortillas. Needs more veggie options.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,198,Love this neighborhood gem. Fast friendly service. Daily specials. Free chips and salsa. Bring cash.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,199,Five stars. Hours aren t great but for the quality of service and the supreme product that rolls out the kitchen. The prices. The food. The people. The atmosphere. All five stars. I have nothing bad to say. Every items I ve ordered has been spot on. I had 5 different breakfast tacos for  13. We ve had dinner here a few times and never had a second thought. I ve ordered lunch out and it was quick and high quality. They have soda  water  and beer. CASH ONLY. But I ll still have it on my goto list top spot. I compare everything else to Habanero  even pizza. It s a lopsided comparison I know. But they set the bar high for quality tastes. These ladies here are incredibly friendly and speedy. Wife and I eat here at least three times a month. I eat here on occasion in the morning if I m running ahead.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,200,The Mexican breakfast can t get any better than this . The place is small but cozy with much shorter wait times that most other popular locations on Sunday morning . The restaurant is cash only so make sure to be prepared . The tacos are a must order  amp  the menudo is a must if your feeling hungover . I will continue to come back to this restaurant every time I m visiting Austin .
Habanero Mexican Cafe,201,Omg Good   We have been coming here for almost 10 yrs and it is the same consistent wonderful flavors always   The hot sauce is out of this world good as well as the guacamole and enchiladas rojas.  The steak ranchero rocKS also   From the outside it doesn t look like much but once you have your first bite you will be happy you tried it 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,202,I heard Habaneros had the best gorditas ever  The lie detector test determine that was a lie  I went there on two occasion and got two different gorditas with the same results. The gorditas at the flea market on 290 is WAYYYYY better.  I was in the area and just wanting two breakfast tacos to go  I was denied service because they had a 10  minimum charge for debit credit cards  who does that  I though that was funny that they did not want my money.  So with that 3rd strike I will not be going to Habaneros again  I will keep going to Jaun in a million and Casa Garcia s for breakfast were they will take my card with just one taco order.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,203,A friend recommended this spot to me when I told him I wanted Mexican food since I was tired of Tex-Mex  being new to TX from CA . I FINALLY found my menudo place  Wooh  And available everyday   Yes please  The waitstaff was very attentive  friendly   amp  made me feel very comfortable even though I was sitting alone. Have been back a few times since then for menudo but definitely want to come back to try the rest of their food.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,204,This place  oh my. This used to be one of our regular lunch spots. It s a converted home. They have about 15 tables. I think 2 large tables for bigger groups. If you get there early  it s perfect but after noon  you will have a wait a bit. Their prices are amazing   I believe for two  we got out of there for under 10 bucks before  Throw in some beers though  the bill comes out a bit more. I love their chuletas. I haven t had chuletas anywhere else as good. The lunch specials are great  about  5- 7 a plate and they are generous.   Parking is a pain when they are busy though but it s never hard to find.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,205,We ordered catering food for a party of 30 last month and the food was at 5 starts. All my friends were amazed with the food. We ordered chicken and veggi fajitas  enchiladas and they came with chips and salsa. The rice and tortillas were warm and ready to serve. The owner was very cool and took care off our order on time.   I will recommend Harbaneros to anyone who is thinking to Cater for parties.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,206,First time here. Decided to eat in on a Saturday morning. I don t recommend it unless you like to wait.  I d describe it as a dive restaurant.   I like dive restaurants but not too busy.  It was only me and I was seated at a six-top table   remember  they are busy.  Menu seemed limited and was greasy  literally . The coffee was actually good. I d rate the  Chori-migas  migas with chorizo  as edible but nothing exciting. The salsa seemed okay.  I probably won t return as I suspect there is better here in Austin...
Habanero Mexican Cafe,207,YAAAAAAAAAAAS.   Only gripe I have is that I wish your salsa was a touch less spicy so I could eat it by the boatloads like I want to.   Guys  this is the mexican food jackpot in Austin. Get the enchiladas  charro beans  carne guisada  leave after only parting with less than  10 and be content 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,208,I had the chicken enchiladas and for under  10 dollars I walked away too full to even look at the sopapillas on the dessert menu.   This place is not  fancy  but the food is up to par. Overall good experience. My only complaint is that they don t take debit credit cards  only cash. They have an atm available but there is a  2.50 surcharge.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,209,Great hole in the wall   Fast service  good food  and you can tell for sure that it s a local staple.  How have I not eaten here    I went with three co -workers on the early side of lunch.  We breezed in  got great service  and paid at the front effortlessly.  Our food was great with one exception.  I order the Combo  2  while Combo  1  Beef Fajita Tacos  and Chile Relleno were also ordered at my table.  All were amazing  except that the Chile Relleno had an interesting eggy coating that perhaps sufficed as a fried out layer      The chile was pleasantly spicey.  The layer was eaten around and all were happy.    I ve always felt that the beans and rice of a tex-mex place was an excellent measure of quality.  They are the forgotten staples that are the pillar of any tex-mex plate.  And I have to say the beans were stellar.   Nothing will measure up to Jorge s bacon infused refired beans in my book  and now that Jorge s is no more  that has gotten even more impossible.   There was not a speck left of bean on my plate and I usually forgo the beans and rice after a compulsory taste.  Not this time.  Beans ahoy 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,210,I have lived in the Austin area for over 3 years now  and in my pursuit of a good Mexican breakfast  I have failed miserably...until now. Habanero was the first restaurant listed in yelp in my search for  best Mexican breakfast  and lemme tell ya  the yelpers don t lie. I tasted the refried beans first  because if a Mexican restaurant can t get those right then I know my meal is doomed  and they tasted like my grandmother was back there making them. They were quite amazing. While they didn t have what I was looking for  enchiladas montadas  I was able to build it. I ordered the Verde enchiladas and asked them to put an over medium egg on top. It came out and tasted exactly how I had imagined. My belly is so happy right now. It is a small restaurant  and while the lobby was full when we walked in  we still only waited about 20 minutes. I will definitely be back 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,211,Cheap. Authentic. Tex-Mex.  This place is all of the above and more. I love it. It now takes the place of King of TexMex in my book.  I used to yearn for a restaurant with Baby A s chips and a chunkier style salsa with the flreshness of Juan In A Million and the flavor of Trudy s red salsa and now I have it.  I have been here twice and both times have been really impressed with the prices and flavor of the food. Not to mention they have good iced tea  which I m a sucker for.  The staff is also super friendly and eager to help get you what you need.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,212,Had Friday night dinner at Habanero s...  - service  5 stars    The ladies were so nice  and terrific Team work among the entire staff   The bottom of the water glass was never found - and the bottles of beer were endless   - food  5 stars     True authentic flavor and menu   Delicious   - value for the money  10 stars    Seriously  I m not sure where you can find such delicious food and great service for less    Provides even more reason to leave a healthy tip     - drink menu  3 stars.  Only beer  no liquor ...so no margaritas        We will definitely return for the great food  and great service 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,213,We attempted to go for lunch today. We put our name on the list and was told about a 20 minute wait. Now I know it s hard to predict an exact time. After 30 minutes went by  we went to check how much longer. Well we were on the bottom of the list still. We couldn t understand why since they had sat people who arrived after us before us.  Now we were a party of 4 and the individuals they sat were parties of 3-4. We spoke to the  manager  at least she stated she was. Though we ve been there a hundred times before and have never seen her. When we asked her why others where sat before us who  arrived after us  she became rude  She stayed she was the manger and said she knew how to run the wait list. After today  I will not be back. I will instead support another local business who appreciates their customers.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,214,Nice hidden Mexican spot on West Oltorf that offers great service and tasteful bland. I tried the chicken Verde enchiladas what the chips and salsa which is very  good .Just an f.y.i they usually take cash only and is closed by 3 p.m. during the weekday.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,215,Wowsa  This place give tierra linda a run for their money. Big fat rolled up delicious tacos of love with GREAT salsa on the cheap.  One thing that s better  MORE BACON   Bacccccooooooooooon. It s like they ve got bacon flavored bacon extras.  The tacos were all full of bacon and potatoes and delight - just the thing you need on a playoff Saturday morning.  They did take a while and it was a little complicated but overall  great shop with some good lookin food. Definitely stopping in for some other treats.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,216,Small place on Oltorf that was clearly a house back in the day. It s a little cramped but maneuverable inside and the service was good. I had the enchiladas Verdes which tasted different for Verde sauce and the beans were a little bland. They only accept cash btw.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,217,Great Fajitas. I have been eating here on  amp  off for over 30 years. To be fair  it used to be called Dos Hermanos. That name closed but I think a family member reopened it as Habanero Caf  a couple of decades ago. Anyway the food is good and the staff friendly. This is Mexican food  so if you want to compare it to your favorite Tex-Mex food  don t. Try the beef fajita on flour tortilla and only add the chili verde  fresh jalapenos.  In the old days they used to blend the jalapenos  but the chunks work well too. I have literally eaten hundreds of these because they are yummy. In fact  I m going back this Saturday even though I live 25 miles away. It is a tiny little hole-in-the-wall with good honest food not trying to pretend to be something it is not. My recommendation  go here without expectations and enjoy the food and the experience.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,218,We had our first date here  so it will always be special. The food and service is great  and we will be back. I love the rellenos. Also  prices are very reasonable. Salsa is fresh and delicious 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,219,This place was really good. The food was fresh but  the wait was about 20 min on a Sunday.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,220,Dear God this place is amazing   I can t tell you how many mediocre Mexican restaurants I have gone to  hoping that yelp  friend recommendations etc will come through  only to walk away dissatisfied. However  my boyfriend is crazy for Mexican food so when we were driving through Austin from SA to head home to Dallas and were hungry  I took one for the team and yelped Mexican in Austin. Overwhelmingly  Habanero was the city fav so we stopped by. Sooooo happy we did    The cafe really is that...it s a cute little two rooms with a faux garden window. The building is definitely well loved  but the friendly staff helps overcome any ambiance reservations you may have.   The requisite chips and salsa were brought to our table and I was blown away by the salsa on my first bite. Perfect consistency  not like pico  not like liquid. Quite ballsy for a salsa. I loved how the heat had tons of flavor  not just heat for heat s sake. Also nice notes of cilantro.   I got carne asada tacos and rice...just head and shoulders above any other tacos I ve had. Perfectly cooked beef  flor tortilla that had been warmed on a flat top grill  and plenty of toppings     Fresh food  good service  cute little place. Will definitely be returning when we are back in town   D
Habanero Mexican Cafe,221,Went here with some friends for breakfast the other day.  We were greeted and seated promptly by a very friendly lady. The menu had a lot of variety but I went with the Migas which I ve heard are a local specialty.  While they were tasty and the environment was totally Austin the food was just okay.  I d return if a friend wanted the true Austin experience  but probably won t be going back for breakfast on my own with so many other options in the area.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,222,Oh  Habanero  where have you been all my life  Cheap tacos. GOOD tacos. I m in love. I had three MASSIVE tacos for lunch with a coke and it was only a little over  7. This is love at first bite  guys.  Habanero is in a cute little house  which is...little. I had to wait for lunch  and the cashier list guy s estimate of five to ten minutes was a bit optimistic. Then I got seated at a four-person table  which seemed odd when there were still larger groups waiting to sit. Oh well. Maybe next time I ll get take-out. They close at three  but serve breakfast all day.  The chips and salsa here are genuinely tasty and free when you sit down. The regular salsa is delightfully spicy  and the chips are light and crisp  with just enough substance not to break all the time and be annoying. You can request the habanero salsa  too  which is even hotter and fabulous on just about everything. It s got a very  very mildly sweet flavor to it  so it s not just raw heat. It s delicious. Habanero serves its namesake well.  I tried three tacos  the migas  the lengua  and the beef fajita ranchera. You have to request extra toppings on your tacos  so don t forget the onions cilantro pico de gallo cheese etc. etc.  They have a little  request pico on your taco  note on the menu to remind you of this.  The tacos all come a la carte  too. I like this because I got everything I wanted and nothing I didn t. I m really not a rice and beans fan  so a la carte is my BFF.  The migas were a perfectly-mixed pile of happiness. I didn t notice any huge chunks  so maybe they took Ashley S. s advice and upped the ante. These were some of the fluffiest  softest migas I ve ever had.  The lengua here is some of the most tender lengua I ve ever had. The chunks just fell apart.  The real star of my lunch was the beef fajita ranchera. It comes with sliced jalapenos in the mix and is coated in a slightly spicy sauce. IIRC  the waitress said the ranchera mix was serrano-based. Whatever it is  it s delicious.  The tortillas were nicely warmed with a few crispy spots here and there  just like a cooked tortilla should be.  The service is friendly and attentive. The waitress delivered a pile of extra napkins right after the juices from my taco started to piddle down my fingers. Now that s service   If I had any complaints  it would be that it s a little loud inside and that the cokes come in a can--not from a fountain. You want free refills  Get water. You re not here for cokes  though--you re here for some serious tacos. It s loud because it s busy  and it s busy because it s some of the best Mexican food I ve had in Austin.  Go to Habanero  Like  now.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,223,I tend to be reluctant to trying new places.  However  I was persuaded to visit this restaurant this past Saturday evening...and I couldn t be more thrilled that I ve now had their delightful food.  This will now be a family and friend favorite from here on out.    To start - the welcoming  like a small  older home...perfectly clean  homey  cozy-feeling...and a smile as we walked in.  We sat where ever we wanted  per the servers suggestion  and had drinks and the most amazing crisp chips and tasty  spicy  garlic-y  lime-y salsa within 3 minutes...at most.  The food couldn t have been better.  I fact  it was delicious - but also so beautiful I took some pictures of it  despite a few looks  .  The servers  who may have been the owners as well  were so incredibly sweet  warm  happy and just the kind of people you d want to have with you at your own dinner  any night.  Our table ordered beef enchiladas  beef fajitas and the oh-so-divine desert  sopapillas.  Perfecto    yes  I exclaimed  perfecto  aloud upon my first glance at them -- and they tasted just as they looked    The fajitas were of skirt steak that was a perfect combination of tender and chewy  a fantastic smoky taste and a zing that comes with marinating a meat for many hours.  The enchiladas were wrapped in delicious  moist corn-goodness  corn tortillas  I believe  and topped beautifully with red sauce and cheese.  The dessert was just as I said  perfect. Crisp fried batter  topped with sugar and swimming in glorious honey.  Man.  I want to go back there already   Actually  probably would have tonight -- but I think they only serve dinner on Fridays and Saturdays.  Oh well  there s always next week.  And thus completes my REASON for joining YELP -- JUST to write about this awesome find    Visit it   You ll be just as thrilled you did 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,224,I ll keep this review short and sweet  if you re craving traditional tacos and cheesy enchiladas  look no further than Habanero. It s among the best brick and mortars in the city for this type of fare. I recommend the chicken fajita taco with onions and peppers  it s delicious and pretty filling.  Note that Habanero is cash only and closes most days at 3 00PM. 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,225,I m trying to keep this review in context of all the kick ass Tex-Mex places that line S. 1st.    I m not big on fajitas  and I debated between my old faithful  yet boring choice of an enchilada taco combo  but after hearing everyone order fajitas while I was in there  I decided to give them a whirl.  Holy guacamole  Batman   Their fajitas were absolutely awesome.  They weren t dry like most places.  I don t know if they let their meat roll around in bacon fat or something  but it was really flavorful without being overseasoned.  The best fajitas I ve had in Austin to date.  I also usually overlook rice and beans that come with a plate  but they served those up as to say   this is what real beans taste like  mofo.   They were awesomely made  and I even found myself sipping up the broth as a soup well after all the beans were gone.    I love that it s a hole-in-the-wall.  It reminds me of the kick-ass tex-mex places in Houston  except that this one doesn t have the convenience of being 24 hours.    I can t wait to come back to try the other plates.  As for the people that complain about smelling like food afterwards  it s a valid point..but it s not something I mind b c it s a small restaurant  and it s a minor thing to leave smelling like tex-mex goodness.  Taking one star away for them charging for extra chips and salsa...though I m willing to forgive it because their prices are just damn good.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,226,Jenny calls me the other day and tells me that her team is going to lunch   Habanero in 30 minutes. I scramble to throw clean clothes on myself and the baby as the Price is Right was just ending. This stay at home Dad thing has its privileges       Jenny calls me after I turned onto 45 to tell me there was a 15 minute wait and I should be on time if I hurry. We arrive and find that they have just sat down at the table. Score one for freeways  We pondered world peace and micro processors over some queso. I m scanning around at the patrons and notice the line is really long at this point. Is the food really that good    In the case of the Catfish Ranchero  the answer is an enthusiastic YES. Delicate fillets blackened and topped with grilled onions  tomatoes  and jalapenos. The rice was equally delicious as was the guacamole and the pico. Jenny s Zak Attack also got good marks as when we ran out of queso for the group  I just started using Jenny s on her plate. I love you Jenny  don t slap my hand away.   After I dropped Jenny off back at work  I called my mom to tell her I was taking her to lunch next week at Habanero. Three stars for the food with a bonus star for some shade at Gillis Park directly behind the place.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,227,Top 5 Mexican restaurants in Austin.  Hands down.  Every day the good people at Habaneros cook  a Mexican angel gets their wings.  The fajitas  chicken and beef  are very good  and for the spicy folk  the fajitas rancheras will give you a serious run for your money.  The breakfast plates are good all day and the machacado taco is something that you can t get just anywhere.  A plate of chori-migas will turn a bad day good.  The portions are serious and the weekday lunch specials are often what I look forward to after many hours staring at the computer screen.    My only problem with these guys are that they re not open later.  Till 3 on most days and they re always packed.  If you re really hungry  order a Horchata with your meal.  It s made the classic way and will fill you up.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,228,I have been coming here for nearly ten years every Wednesday for the lunch special. Today  I had the need for Tex-Mex and decided to come back down to Habaneros just to try some of the other things on the menu.  Even though it was almost 2 o clock  I had a hankering for some breakfast so I ordered the Machacado plate. It was delicious  easily on par with Juan in a Million. My mom had the carne guisada  which was also very good. I m not a connoisseur of carne guisada  but it was among the best I ve tasted.  Just like the beef fajiata ranchera lunch special  Habaneros is awesome for other items on their menu as well. Love  love  love this place.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,229,I really have nothing to say.  My five stars say it all.      Very affordable  the lunch specials own every single day  and despite the long lines..you get in and out reasonably fast.  The waitresses are great and may only be outdone by the restaurant s chips and salsa.  Jesus Christ.  Shit is so serious...       If you have the chance   go before noon or after 1 if you are on a schedule  If you go for breakfast..get the deluxe plate or kys.      One strange fact about Habanero s - Every time I go my tab is different even if I order the same thing.  It is still super cheap and the best deal in 04 for lunch.  Go for lunch  thank me later  If you feel like splurging the extra buck....try the carnitas....mmmmmmmm
Habanero Mexican Cafe,230,Definitely our favorite Mexican food restaurant  Love the atmosphere  the house is really cute   and the waitresses are super nice  and attentive. My husband loves their habanero salsa  which doesn t automatically come out with the other salsa and chips. so be sure to ask for that if you enjoy spicy stuff. He is also obsessed with their chicken ranchera and la lengua tacos. My personal favorites are the gorditas with barboca and their Picadillo tacos. If you go on the weekend  be sure to order horchata...it s heavenly. Plus we eat like kings  and usually stay under  20. My only complaint is they are only open until 3 pm except on Fridays and Saturdays  but my waistline is thankful for that.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,231,If you re looking for great authentic Mexican food stop your search and do yourself a favor by dropping in and ordering some Fajitas. Great carne  delicious tortillas and wonderful beans have made me completely forget about all the mainstream Tex-mex spots we ve all frequented. Great atmosphere  fast service and good iced tea with lime have made this my spot when I need a Mexican food fix.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,232,Definitely my favorite place in Austin. The owner is such a great guy  I love how hes always at the cash register to greet customers  and the waitresses are all very sweet. The interior is quite small but functional  I ve been there with parties of various sizes  even 9 at one point  and they were able to accommodate us with no problem.  Their salsa is the best  just go there and try it... I smother all of my food in its luscious... deliciousness. I usually get the barbacoa plate  and a tripas  fried tripe  taco. I always need a nice nap afterwards.  If you re looking for legit Mexican  please go soon 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,233,The food was great- especially the beef fajitas. The meat was well seasoned and the set-up made for a great dish. Service was kind and helpful.   Only knock is they could use more ventilation in the building- the smell of spices and peppers can be overpowering.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,234,Food taste very authentic. Size is limited during rush hours and their fries aren t the best.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,235,OK  so I have given this place a try twice now and I am still sad      Pros 1. they have the best salsa in Austin  hands down - every time we go  we leave with a tub of it and it s gone from our fridge in less than a day 2. the prices are great and portions plentiful 3. location   parking all good  Cons 1. there s always a wait - not bad  but you have to all sit in each others  laps since the entrance is so small 2. they don t bring you chips and salsa automatically - you have to order it  if it costs additional why not at least ask if we want any  3. the food - no salt at all. to be honest I hate salty foods  but this place is seriously so bland that I was dumping handfuls of salt to get any flavor at all. guac was horribly bland and boring. breakfast migas had no egg in it at all  it was entirely tortilla chips - where is the egg  in order to get full I just dumped some of the delicious salsa on it.  So sad  wish it lived up to all of this hype - there are much better options for brunch breakfast lunch in the area
Habanero Mexican Cafe,236,Everything was amazing   Chips Salsas The habenero salsa had a kick but not too hot to handle variety  Tacos Enchilladas Service  They checked all the boxes  Friendly staff  great food and a very cozy restaurant. Good that this place a bit far  if it were close to me  I would be here way too regularly 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,237,This is a super casual place to slide into when you want some good  authentic  inexpensive Mexican food.  You re not going to find any hipster waiters with stretched out earlobes and piercings here.  It s really just a simple place with all the classic good food for when you re hungry and you ve had enough already with the  keeping it weird  scene.   The waitress gave us our choice of any table  and the service was quick with the drinks and chips salsa.  I ordered verde chicken enchiladas  yummy  and the hubby had chicken fajitas  also yummy .  The fajitas were not the typical kind you see at Chuy s  which is usually the long  thin slices.  These were more like chunks of chicken and it had some sort of rub on it before cooking that gave it a great flavor.  It was delish.  Prices are low.  It s kind of a family place so they don t stay open too late.  They have beer but no wine nor a full bar.  This place is really casual  so come as you are and enjoy 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,238,Yummmmmy  I ve been wanting to come here for a while and I m so glad I finally did. It s a small adorable place with prompt and friendly service. We were seated and brought complimentary chips and salsa. Wowza - chips were crispy and not greasy. Salsa was so fresh and just the right amount of spice. They ll refill the salsa for free but not the chips - which is ok with me because I usually overstuff myself on bottomless chips anyway.   I usually order one of two things at a Mexican restaurant - quesadillas or nachos. I know I know - not the most exciting order. But this time I went out of my box and got the Zach Attack - with barbacoa and with queso on the side. What came to the table was a giant burrito looking thing. The tortilla was warm and crispy around the edges and soft and chewy on the inside. It was filled with a perfect layer of retried beans and then chock full of meat. It was so incredibly good - moist meat  perfectly seasoned. I could only eat half - and I didn t even touch the side of rice.  BF got three tacos - barbacoa  chicken and al pastor. He was very impressed. Especially for only  2 each - they really fill them up  He could only eat 2 so now we both have some dinner for later  and all for  16.  The only thing I ll say is I m really glad I got the queso on the side for my Zach Attack because it tasted like straight up buttery velveeta.  I ll be back for sure 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,239,I love this place  The migas are my favorite and the breakfast tacos are cheap and yummy  Their salsa is also super good  It is cash only which is inconvenient but the food makes up for it 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,240,What the heck - the BEST stuff that they have isn t even listed in the Full Menu link   It s their breakfasts.  The Chori-Migas are RIDICULOUSLY good and they are served with pappas that are just really large fries that go well with the migas.  Get this with a side of corn tortillas and the chori-migas with a couple of fries and some of the refried beans on a tortilla is incredible.  They have the same staff here every morning that I come in  yes  I m coming in a lot now  and they are all really friendly and welcoming.  The service is great.  A couple of interesting things  1  they don t bring your check to the table  you go to the cashier when you are ready to leave and they figure it out  and 2  the food is really inexpensive so you can do this every day   .
Habanero Mexican Cafe,241,Great restaurant and good service the ranchero fajitas are the best.  I recommend this to any friends and anyone.   I just wish that the hours were a little better so it was open in the evening so we could get dinner there.  Anyways great restaurant and good price.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,242,Out of this world GOOD   The homemade salsa  Chori -Migas  Menudo  chips and salsa. AMAZING   Just make sure you have cash  .
Habanero Mexican Cafe,243,This place is amazing the barbacoa  and chicharon tacos go FED if you haven t tried this place you are Definitely missing out    The prices are Great and the food is Great you can t lose. Service is Awesome it s worth the wait right hand to GOD
Habanero Mexican Cafe,244,Awesome Tex mex food. Ordered the beef fajitas  plate and it was delicious. Well served and really nice service too  I ll be happy to visit again
Habanero Mexican Cafe,245,Wow this place is the most perfect hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. The food is sensational and the flavors are out of this world. I had a combo and loved everything on my plate. Service was excellent and food came out fast. Highly recommend this gem.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,246,Solid choices.  So many  it s hard to make a decision.  Enchiladas are good  fajitas are very good  gordita is very good  had beef fajita in it   and their tacos are awesome.  Taco plate is three flour tortilla tacos with what you pick and pico de gallo. Salsa is always good  although the chips aren t anything special.  Breakfast tacos are good  but a little more than I want to pay usually. Watch out at lunch.  The seating area is small  and after noon the line for a seat can get long.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,247,I had the cheese enchilada plate with verde sauce  and it was dern good.  The sopapillas were bomb too.  Vegetarians can also get veggie enchiladas or veggie tacos.  I made a mistake and ordered a diet coke instead of an iced tea - the diet coke comes in a can  the iced tea comes in GIANT cup  complete with free refills.  But  this was our first stop when we got to Austin  so I didn t know about the giant cups of iced tea with free refills thing yet.  The salsa was good - I disagree with other reviewers  I didn t think it was spicy.  But  it was tasty and I asked for more.  Service was quick and friendly  prices are excellent.  High value.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,248,Not very good. Went there because of positive yelp reviews and recommendation from friends last year. OK atmosphere and friendly staff but food bland and greasy. Chips seemed stale and flavorless. No crunch. Salsa also flavorless. Dry chicken on greasy platter without much seasoning beyond salt.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,249,Is it me or am I missing something   4.5 Yelp stars really     2nd visit after forgetting about my first visit almost 3 years ago. Nothing has changed though as my memory was jogged by the same impression this time lasting.  Seated at table given large ice water and waited and waited and waited. Finished water and needed refill before waitress showed up 15-20 minutes later. The place was only half full.  The menu sounded appetizing  several beef dishes all grilled over a mesquite fire. Oddly though I neither saw nor smelled any mesquite smoke outside upon arrival.  Ordered a grilled beef steak with eggs. One in our group ordered the lunch carne asada which qualified us for a  free  basket of chips and salsa which for some reason are not included with breakfast meals. The chips were straight from the bag. The salsa was ok but lacked enough heat  vinegar and garlic.  The beef steak I ordered medium rare  it came out cooked not-well well done resembling beef hide more than beef meat. It was white inside. It was 1 8 inch thick yet almost uncutable with a sharp knife. Forget chewing it  you have to cut it into small enough pieces and swallow whole.  Oh and the mesquite grilling  This  meat  had obviously been cooked on a flat top grill without any hint at all of being near a wood fire.  What sounded so great on the menu turned to be quite low grade food.  This time I will not forget the experience and will remember to not return.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,250,Quick  amp  friendly service  as always. Don t forget it s cash only  ATM on site is sometimes faulty.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,251,Favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin for me.  It is inexpensive  quick and the food is always as good as expected.  It is true that sometimes the tripas can be too fried and the carnitas too dry  but the price and friendliness makes up for it.  The horchata drink is interesting- but too sweet and full of cinnamon for my taste. Their salsa is on the spicy side  but very delicious.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,252,This was my first stop in Austin. I m from NYC where there isn t a huge Mexican food scene  so when I saw the reviews for Habanero Cafe  I was super excited for authentic Mexican cuisine. And I wasn t disappointed  I ordered the beef fajitas and a breakfast taco for good measure. Every piece of the entree  down to the sides of rice and beans  was perfectly seasoned. Even the chips and salsa were tasty    The restaurant itself is cozy with an authentic Tex Mex feel. The staff is extremely courteous. And for the quantity of food you get  this place is c-h-e-a-p. I easily found street parking at 1PM on a Friday and was seated immediately.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,253,Great Tex Mex joint in South Austin for good and inexpensive Mexican food.  They serve breakfast all day long.  Always crowded so plan for a wait.  Food comes out fast though.  Bring  . Cash only.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,254,Definitely eat here     This place has the best fajitas and salsa I ve ever had. From the time I was knee high to a grasshopper until a couple years ago  I ate here at least once a week even single week and I ve never had a less than incredible dining experience  I live 2 hours away now so unfortunately I don t get to eat here very often anymore but anytime I m in the Austin area I have to stop by. In fact  I ve even made the trip to Austin a few times JUST to eat at Habanero. Best restaurant in Austin    
Habanero Mexican Cafe,255,my go to place when in ATX...food is always really good.  And they have the best wait staff.  When a place has the same wait staff for years  it shows that they take care of their employees. Very highly recommendation breakfast suggestion Huevos Gringos and sub fajita meat for carne guisada  but both are really good
Habanero Mexican Cafe,256,I came here for a quick lunch one day before my mani pedi. I got the shrimp fajitas and wow... It was very tasty  I don t typically like spicy food because I hate sniffling and wiping my nose every 5 secs while I m trying to eat. I think my eyes even watered at one point. But for some reason I couldn t stop eating... Lol the service was great. The waitstaff was very attentive and fast. I was in and out and made it in time for my appt. Only problem was that they do not accept credit cards so you need to pull out cash from their ATM. I will be returning to try some of their NON-spicy dishes. lol
Habanero Mexican Cafe,257,This place has the best authentic Mexican food in Austin. It is very affordable and the service is great. If you like spice  their salsa has a lot of kick to it. Make sure you get the barbacoa plate. It is the best thing on the menu.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,258,LUNCH SPECIALS  You cannot beat  5.95 for a large portion of tasty food. Both eating in the restaurant and ordering out have been great experiences-highly recommend.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,259,What makes Habanero special  I will tell you what makes Habanero special. It is the mesquite grilled meats. The beef mainly. The flavor that you get from the grill and whatever spice rub they use contributes to an unbelievably flavorful  rich  and tender taste. My absolute favorite thing is Robertos Plate from the breakfast menu- two eggs over medium  substitute queso for ranchero sauce and rice for the home fries- see attached photo. It is SO GOOD. There can be a wait on the weekend mornings but I ve never waited more then 15 minutes. Always busy  the waitresses are very sweet and friendly.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,260,In love with this place. Food is excellent and delicious. The place is awfully small and the close really early....wish they had later hrs but I mean you will absolutely love love the food.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,261,It might replace Maudie s for me... The salsa is home made  spicy and delicious - completely flavorful. The beans are filled with bacon and jalape os. The carnitas were moist and the tortillas hot  The queso was just OK - skip that. YUM YUM
Habanero Mexican Cafe,262,Went here on a whim and was not disappointed. The building is kinda tiny for the amount of people that come here so the wait can be a little long. The layout is pretty cool though. Luckily we came right before a surge of people got there and were seated within 5 minutes. The staff doesn t seem to have much urgency but the service was friendly and swift when they did get to you. I had the Habanero Burrito Ranchero which seemed to be a favorite  as I saw many others getting the same thing  and it was really good. I was getting full but wanted to keep eating it to continue tasting it. Chile con queso wasn t bad either.   I would definitely come back here  but not during a lunch or dinner rush.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,263,I like this place because it s a hole in the wall and they have good breakfast tacos  and I love breakfast tacos. The salsa is hot  too. So  if you like breakfast tacos and salsa  enjoy Habanero    Bonus points if you speak da espa ol 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,264,Craving Faitas  Look no further Amigo  because I got the place just for you  But at this family restaurant  I highly recommend the Beef Fajita Ranchera. It s their specialty that sells out every single day. This heap platter that can easy feed two and  is served with Mexican Rice  Charro Beans  Pico de Gallo and guacamole. The Beef Fajita Ranchera has slices of grilled Jalapenos  so get ready for that spicy kick  All of their fajitas and steaks are marinated in special spices and cooked over mesquite wood  so you get that memorable smoky aftertaste. Serving South Austin since 2008  this mom-and-pop joint prides in their traditional dishes still prepared with love by the original owners. I will say this  CASH ONLY. There is an ATM machine inside  but you might as well avoid the bank fees and pass on your saving to your friendly server s tip 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,265,I m here visiting from California and the reviews were good so we decided to try it.  My friend was so excited to have the menudo but it was a big disappointment. It seriously tasted like crap  literally. Something was very wrong    I had a combo plate with a chicken flauta  Beef taco and bean tostada. Everything was average. I assumed my flauta came with guacamole because in California is ALWAYS does but nope. This place was mediocre.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,266,The absolute WORST Mexican restaurant in all of Austin  Dirty disgusting floor  greasy tables wiped down w a dirty rag. Dirty glasses. The plates were greasy and unwashed. Silver wear looked like nasty. Bad food.   The food was spicy but with no nuance. Beef fajita  meh.  Menudo  terrible. Sour.  Tacos  who can screw up a taco  right  Cold meat from a microwave    And you call yourself authentico...Please.  And the customer service  The front employees must be family members because they are the rude and dumb. No self respecting business owner would hire those two bimbos  unless they were your sisters  daughters.   Only one star because I can t give less.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,267,My wife and I love eating here whenever we get a chance. They re definitely our go to Mexican place and have great habanero salsa  if you ask for it. My wife prefers their regular salsa so we each get what we want. We usually can only make it on the weekend so we order an horchata to share  the horchata is only available on the weekends and well worth it . If you want to complain about them not accepting credit cards  go to a corporate restaurant   like Serranos. For the rest of us  just be intelligent and bring your own cash ahead of time or don t complain about a  2.50 charge to use an ATM. I find it a bit sad that someone would let their poor planning ruin their dining experience. It is a mom and pop atmosphere and for those of us  who are not Californians  we love it. I personally am a huge fan of their lengua taco  lengua plate  and chicken fajita ranchera. I had never tried lengua before  coming here and I must say I find it to be one of the best and leanest meats available. Everyone who works there is always very friendly and makes you feel right at home. Add to this that the menu is very affordable and you have a winning combination. I strongly urge my fellow Austinites to ignore any naysayers and give this place a try. You will not be disappointed.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,268,First time here today walked in and the place was busy  however we waited less than 10 min to be seated. The staff was very friendly and had our table ready with their chips and salsa that were absolutely delish. We ordered the fajitas for 2. Good size  juicy soft flavorful fajitas. I believe this is the best place for fajitas in my book so far   came with a side of tortillas  your choice corn or flour   pico de gallo  Mexican rice  fresh lettuce and a small cup of frijoles a la charra  which were perfectly spicy . Their homemade limonada was really good too. Will be coming back even though it s pretty far from where I live  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,269,Oh  we LOVE this place. Discovered it years ago through the Austin Chronicle. We live north but make it here about once a month for a fix of their heavenly salsa and chips. My favorite in cooler weather is the caldo de res. When it is hot outside  like today  I go for the steak ranchero. It is grilled flank steak with grilled onions  tomato and serrano peppers on top. Wow   The waitresses are a hoot and they really make the experience  so talk it up with them and you just about get dinner and a show    It is a small place  so I hesitate to tell you all about it and risk not getting in the next time we visit. But Yelpers deserve to know. Great Mexican breakfast. Sunday they close at 3  so get there by 2 30 to get in and out.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,270,This little whole in the wall Mexican joint is on point. The food was delicious. Service was quick. Don t be put off by a long line  they move pretty fast.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,271,Loved the chicken fajitas so much I came back the next day  Guac perfect  friendly people. Perfect 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,272,Minimum credit card charge of 10 bucks is a pain.  No debt accepted.  Staff is very nice and attentive.  Small group of four is OK any larger is an issue so do not do it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,273,Delicious.  A ton of food  I got a  1 combo and could have shared it with my husband. It was really good. Got the rice milk drink and it was like dessert. Service was quick.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,274,Well what can I say  this was one of the very first places we tried breaking out of our shell and our  Try Something New  adventure...and I swear I did a review for breakfast  with pictures and all...yet cant find it. gonna keep it simple on this one..Service it just crazy cool...We are ALWAYS fans of a joint where everyone covers for everyone else..Multiple servers just buzzing around...All happy  friendly and quick...Queso was small  very well priced and cheesy..not much flavor  but thats were the Salsa comes in..DeLish..spicy and addictive...Wife had Beef Chiladas  NO beans  DBL rice..ME ...Chiladas Verde w chicken...Wife really enjoyed the whole plate..Mine was good too  but the chicken was a bit dry..only breast meat..which is never juicy cooked alone  but great mixed with Verde sauce..Charros were top notch good...Second best to date..In the End...Cant beat the value for what you get...very enjoyable experience  start to finish..No does this make the cut for our RE-Visits...Its a long drive for us to visit  but yes...if we were in the area  for sure..
Habanero Mexican Cafe,275,Nothing too special about this restaurant. The only reason we went is because the Colombian restaurant on 7th was closed. I got a Chile relleno and it was ok.... still served with the same refried beans  spanish rice  and lettuce tomatoes on the side that you would get at any Mexican place in America.  The steak fajitas were OK  The prices were good  It seems like the breakfast here is the thing to try according to other yelper  so maybe i ll try it sometime morning when I m on the south side  but I definitely wont be goin out of my way.  Nothing too special about this place its was meh.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,276,I m a big fan of this place  and I go to it slightly more often than somewhere like like Polvo s or any of the other zillions of Mexican Tex-Mex places around.  Obviously the main reason is the food. - Their rotating lunch specials are  6  the perfect lunch price  and are really good. They come with rice  beans  and pico  and range from chicken beef fajitas to chicken mole and carne guisada. - Their tortillas are some of the best in the area  which help make their tacos unmissable. Especially unmissable are the breakfast tacos  try their excellent bacon.  - Get a torta. They use crustier bolillo bread than most places do  which is a nice change  and I like the variety that they offer  with a particular favorite being the fajita ranchera. - Their salsa is the bomb  and actually has a bit of a bite to it.  I also like the location and ambiance. Of course the flip side of  cozy and intimate  is  can get really crowded   but if you re in at a non-peak time  there s something about the interior that feels like it makes for a better experience  especially in the little narrow room by the street. Their parking lot is small but I ve never had an issue parking on the street.  Minor things to note  - Chip refills cost  1.50. Not a huge deal  but still somewhat baffling. - Can be crowded at peak lunch times to the point of 20  minute waits. Clearly this is because it s good  but it s still something to be mindful of if you re in a hurry. -  10 minimum for credit cards. This can actually be tough to hit  since their food is such a good value. - Hours are tricky  they open at 7am every day  but close at 3pm Sunday  amp  Monday  5pm Tuesday - Thursday  and 9pm Friday  amp  Saturday. Just something to keep in mind.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,277,Man all I can say is their fajitas al mesquite are the bomb. Combine with the great taste of their charro beans and yellow Mexican rice with a cold beer on the side  I couldn t ask for more.   Really good food  not a let down.  Service is great   Cash only does not affect anyone 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,278,The food was not that great  heartburn awaits due to overused grease pit  no flavor  and they have no drink menu. Taking this one off my list and trying out one of many others around the corner. Staff will mean mug you  Taco Bell is actually a better pick ...
Habanero Mexican Cafe,279,This place is so good. Food was delicious  I ordered the taco plate with spicy beef fajita and it was amazing. Even the rice and beans were great. We did have to wait 20 minutes and the place only accepts cash. The place is really small.  We will definitely return on our next trip to Austin 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,280,My wife said this was her all time favorite Mexican meal of all time. So that s pretty good. We had two other friends with us who were both really satisfied as well. I had chicken fajitas on special  it was dank. I ate every bite and then another taco. She had the chimichanga burrito with sauces on the side  and i gotta say I would definitely order that again. As always  I Definitely recommend a bowl before you go 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,281,It was a bit of a wait - 20 minutes on a Saturday afternoon - and the place is pretty small.  All started off well - the chips  amp  salsa are terrific - and Mexican bottled sodas are always a plus.  We visited because I was craving botanas - something we ate regularly in the Rio Grande Valley. I thought we d hit the jackpot - I had super high hopes for the nachos - but was rather disappointed. While the chicken fajita and chips were great  it was covered in liquid nacho sauce instead of actual cheese and many of the chips on the bottom were soggy.  Also  my partner ordered three types of tacos and the meat was good  but the tortillas were standard store bought flour tortillas. Not what we expected at all 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,282,Habaneros will ALWAYS deliver   figuratively speaking  . The tortillas are homemade   like on point. For someone that s a mexican food snob  this place reminds me of home   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,283,I passed by here a bunch of times on my bike  and often while hungry. I came really close to stopping so many times  but given that It s about 25-30 minutes from home  I figured it s not a great idea to stop and eat mexican  no matter how much I m tempted.  I was right of course.   But thankfully I didn t have to find out the hard way-I drove past  was hungry and decided the time was nigh to finally drop in. And I m glad I did. I m also glad I didn t have to ride back afterward  because everything is full of delicious beans and cheese. And seriously. It s good.   There s not a lot of seating  but I got there at about 2ish on a Saturday  so it wasn t an issue. I can see how it could get cramped and lead to lines-but it s worth it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,284,This place is legit. Horchata on the beverage menu is always a good sign  The catfish ranchero is excellent. Menu described the burrito plate as  two small burritos   and they were small but it was an entire plate of food.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,285,Pros  food is awesome  low prices  fantastic  amp  fast service. Portions are huge    Cons  the place is tiny   Parking is limited too.  I just took 5 of my coworkers there for the first time  amp  we luckily scored a table  but for a minute there it looked like we were going to have to go somewhere else.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,286,Hands down best menudo in Austin I ve tried so far. Being from El Paso Juarez it s been tricky trying to find good menudo here. Lucky to have stumbled upon this little neighborhood restaurant. It s a modest wholesome establishment. Wait to be seated  the servers speak little English  which adds to the charm   pay at the cashier s desk.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,287,Man I love this place. I don t live south anymore so it s really a treat when we get to make the drive down here. Very simple  delicious  authentic Mexican food. If you re expecting some type of fancy modern Tex-Mex with a twist  this is not the place for you. This is home cooking like your Abuela used to make. All these reviews saying it was lacking flavor or too plain or bland... welcome to traditional home cooked Mexican meals  Everything my grandmother used to make us growing up was very plain. No extra salsa or guacamole or pico on top. A quesadilla is just a corn tortilla and cheese  rolled up like a flauta. I think that s part of why I love this place so much. I would highly recommend the gorditas  Two huge meals and some queso for  25. You won t find a better Mexican meal at that price 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,288,This is the best restaurant in town for the rest love breakfeast menu is extensive and it s always good I suggest the Robertrotaste great
Habanero Mexican Cafe,289,I love the burritos. great chips and salsa. fast service. parking is lkmited. this place is popular and if you come here you ll know why.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,290,We came here with a group of 8  which was a bit tight for this small joint. The chips were so crispy and light - loved them. I highly highly recommend the caldo de res with its large chunks of beef and veggies. The menudo was not as flavorful as the caldo de res. Horchata is delicious but can be a bit sweet - I m waiting for the ice to melt. Service was great 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,291,This was a find   A little place  near the airport.  Was looking for something quick on a flight leaving Austin with a friend.  The food was very good.  Presentation and such may be deceiving to some  but everything had spice  flavor and it was QUICK   A bit lacking in parking but well worth a stop.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,292,So good especially love that they serve breakfast for dinner  The owners are so awesome too  Nikki always greets us w a smile and knows I ll always order queso so when I sit down it s waiting for me. Can t say enough great things just wish they were open late or 24 7 A habanero mascot would be cool too
Habanero Mexican Cafe,293,Okay  so I ve only been here once but I was very impressed by the food and service. I went with the fam and everyone agreed that the food was delicious. Even my picky 3 year old enjoyed her meal. They also make some pretty bomb horchata. The salsa was a bit too spicy for my liking but my dad and bf loved it. We ll be back    And yes  as many other have confirmed  the place is small so you might want to check it out during non-peak hours.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,294,Best Tex Mex available. Barbacoa is to die for along with the beef fajitas. Friendly staff. Very busy during lunch. Also try the lemonade.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,295,Very good Mexican food. Cold Big Red and barbacoa. The place is tiny and cramped but the food made it worth it. The salsa was great  the charro beans were very good as well. The service was friendly and the wait staff was very attentive. We will definitely be back when in town.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,296,I have heard a lot of things about this place. I got chicken enchiladas and it was not the best I had. Their salsa and queso dip is really good. I think I will come back again and try something else. They do not open for dinner. The atmosphere is really cute. The staff is super friendly.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,297,This place is sooooo good   It may not look great but the food is amazing    I definitely would recommend this 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,298,Best breakfast ever.   Regular Sunday stop   The Huevo Gringos is delicious and the service is fast and friendly. By far one of the best Mexican restaurants in Austin  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,299,I absolutely loved this place  Had the grilled veggie enchilada with green sauce and it was amazing  This place is a little hole in the wall place  and I think these kinds of places are the best ones  The rice is good  the salsa they give you when you sit down is delicious and spicy  I would come here again in a heartbeat  This place is one of the best  if not thee best mexican place I ve ever been to.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,300,Best Mexican food in town. Their fajitas are to die for  I refuse to order fajitas anywhere else. I recommend trying the fajitas during the Wednesday lunch special  super inexpensive and worth it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,301,Talk about PENNY WISE and POUND FOOLISH    I eat here on a semi-regular basis and I live in neighborhood.  I go in for a  20 to go order and I ask if there is any salsa in the bag.  Older guy at the register  i.e. not some disaffected slacker  tells me that I did not order any.  I see a large container full of small containers of salsa. I ask for a few of those  he tells me they are .25 cents apiece.   My credit card transaction had already gone through.  I replied  never mind... 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,302,OH MY  Salsa  amp  chips are awesome  Bacon  Egg  Potatoe  amp  cheese are on point. The queso is good too- portion is a little small. Caldo is like no other.  The place is a little cramped which is one reason we do not frequent as often. Sometimes the service lacks which is surprising considering they have 4 ladies working a very small area. AND THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,303,I love this place.  Food is good.  Very reasonably priced and the staff is great.  My go-to place for tacos.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,304,This place is the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a  I ve lived next to it most of my life ate here all the time never disappointed
Habanero Mexican Cafe,305,Been to Austin s 4 times. 1st place I can say has excellent Mexican food. Quant  friendly staff  great beans and good ranchero and tomatillo sauces.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,306,It s a thumbs up from me. NOT on the well trodden tourist trail plus a customer base of mostly Hispanic people   win. Cosy down-home atmosphere. Breakfast served all day so double win. I had migas with bacon  most of the breakfast dishes come with home fries. The chips and salsa were incredible  the salsa a contender for the best I ve ever had  slightly sweet  very spicy and the perfect balance of seasoning. I  enjoyed a wonderful breakfast at a very reasonable price and will definitely return  Great service too.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,307,A little shop on the corner of the street but the food is amazing  I get a gordita 99  of the time because it s my favorite. But I ve tried the other food and everything else is just as good. Must try 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,308,Yelp said they had margaritas  but they don t. Charming location and good wait staff  however 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,309,I came to Austin from Houston for a day trip.  I had family from NYC visiting Austin.  When I asked what they wanted for lunch  of course they said Tex-Mex.  Using my trusty Yelp app  I found Habanero.    We must  have came at the perfect time  around 11am Saturday  because we were seated immediately.  The table next to us had breakfast tacos that come with french fries IN it.  The NYers were so intrigued.    I ordered the Menudo Soup  Beef Ranchero taco and Tripas Taco.  I prefer the Menudo here bc everything in the soup was cut up to small bite size pieces.  I ve tried Menudo at other places and the pieces were too big  making it  difficult to bite apart.  Overall it was good if you are into Menudo  definitely don t try if you aren t adventurous.  The Beef Ranchero was good  a bit salter than I would have liked.  My favorite though was the Tripas Taco.  The tripa was so crispy and crunch.  Again  not for the faint of heart.  I would come back just for that taco if I lived closer.   Overall  service was friendly  food was cheap.  I d come back again.  PS.  I ve already mention this in my tip section  but I would like to thank the guy who paid for my family s lunch    payitforward.  It was the first time we experienced that.  I will start my own pay it forward chain in the near future and it was inspired by my dining experience here 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,310,Solid  solid  solid. For me  Habanero has been a South Austin breakfast staple for almost 15 years  and despite its huge increase in popularity over time  it still feels homey and low-key. Habanero does breakfast tacos the way I like them  traditional  simply seasoned  and with warm  soft  good quality tortillas. Get the bean and cheese  the bacon and egg  the machacado  omG   the chorizo and egg... I didn t even like chorizo before I had the chorizo here. I m not above admitting that chorizo s usually kind of gross  right  Not at Habanero. There s no grit  no gristly chunks  no orange grease dripping on your leg while you snarf it in the car because you can t wait until you get home for the first bite--not that I would know about that particular experience. And I get it  there s a time and place for the trendy taco with the quirky name that s stuffed with too many ingredients  but that time and place is for your out-of-town guests who think the concept of a breakfast taco is novel in itself. Habanero is for the sincere.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,311,First things first  the prices are cheap.  Their lunch specials are like  6.50.  I suggest the Wednesday and Thursday specials.  The food is good.   Nothing really exceptional except they spice and season things well.  All meats are some version of over cooked but not inedible.  The pico is consistently mostly onions.  The salsa is right on.    The staff are friendly and quick and attentive.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,312,My favorite restaurant in Austin    I ve brought so many friends here  because the food is just unbelievable. The queso is simple  yet amazing and I argue that the steak fajitas are the best beef dish I ve ever had  period. Can t recommend Habanero enough    
Habanero Mexican Cafe,313,CASH ONLY  ATM LOCATED INSIDE. In this day and age I can understand not accepting checks....but no cards   And then to assume that I should pay   2.50 or something like that just to dine at your establishment   Yeah no...good food but not great to begin with certainly not for the inconvenience if not insult to have to use your ATM. Won t eat there ever again.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,314,My husband an I visited for lunch on a weekday. Once we saw the wait for a table  we knew this place had to be greatness. The dining room was so tiny  seating for 30 at the most. Service was fast and friendly and the food was exactly as ordered. My fish tacos were slightly over cooked but my husband said his chorizo plate was excellent. I ll definitely try them again.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,315,You re normally in for a wait  and be sure to bring your cash.  Wednesday is the wildly popular fajita special which is definitely worth waiting for.  Parking in back and on street.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,316,AMAZING FOOD  Ton of food  very inexpensive.  The service was great  everyone was friendly. Warning  cash only 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,317,My first visit today.  I placed a take out order for Chicken Verde Enchiladas. Just an FYI  but there is a minimum of  10 for debit credit cards.  I bought two Mexican Cokes to get over that little hump...  Love them     Anyhow  I got back to work  and not too impressed on the meal.  There was only spiced grilled chicken in the tortillas  and not enough of the bland Verde Sauce on top to make up for it.  Weren t the worst  but definitely not the best I ve had.  I ll try Habanero again and get something else  as this might be the worst thing they make.  I m Italian  and I can make better 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,318,First thing I noticed when I walked in was the smell. It was like the chemicals they use for port-a-potties. Fortunately it didn t smell like human feces  but still  not a good smell for a restaurant  Maybe they were cleaning the bathrooms or something  but that almost drove me to turn around and leave right there.  But I was hungry and had to eat something  so I sat down. I ve read that people are waiting in line for this place  but for me  no wait at all. I came in around 10 30ish on a weekday. The food was pretty good. Chips and salsa are not free  they cost  1.50. Store bought chips  but salsa was pretty good but nothing amazing. I got the Roberto Special  which is eggs over easy with beans and a side of beef fajitas. Nothing special about any of the items except for the beef fajitas. The quality of the meat was not great  but the seasoning and spices they used  wow  very good. It made up for all the other negative things about this place.  However  I gotta say  it is not the type of place you go to for high quality food made with really good ingredients. It s made to taste good as cheaply as possible. That s fine. To me  that s what regular everyday Mexican food is about. So come here with appropriate expectations and you should be OK. No way I would wait in a long line to eat here though.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,319,Inexpensive food that s consistently delicious.  The service is fast.  I ve always had a pleasant experience  even during busy times.  Good people run Habanero Mexican Cafe.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,320,Best Tex-Mex in Austin  Don t miss the fajitas and chips and salsa. Refried beans and nachos are also terrific.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,321,The food is good  b its hard for the employees to understand English  therefore u leave their with the wrong food.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,322,Me  So what queso do you recommend   Lily  waitress    Oh  I love the Flambo Queso  it s awesome   Uhm... where is that    It s right... uhm.... hmmm.... Ya know  I think we served that at another place where I used to work   Awesome.  So I had the  2 fish tacos  the steamed crab legs  the  2 beer on tap  and the steamed crab legs.  Oh wait... no... that was at another place where I eat sometimes.  I had the fried  Chicken Habanero Burrito  and the regular queso.  It was pretty good.    It d really mess my shit up if Lily s waitin  tables at Quality Seafood next week.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,323,Edited from 4 to 2 stars.  I should seriously wait to review things sometimes. In retrospect  it will be a long time  if ever   before I go back to Habanero. For the rest of the day  I reeked so badly that I wanted to go home and take a shower. I felt greasy and disgusting. And I seriously don t think I ll eat again until tomorrow night. I just feel gross. It tasted good  but in the end  it s not worth it. -- Man  I can t remember the last time I ate at Habanero. It has to have been in 2001. And back then  I remember thinking...meh. But an errand today took my friend and I right be Habanero and we figured we d go.  Habanero is some pretty good straight up Tex Mex. I had carnitas  my friend had tacos  chicken fajita  which came with bell peppers  which she took off thank GOD because they make her fart like crazy and I did NOT want to be in the car with that on the way back to work . We also got queso  which we needed to thin with some salsa.  It was good. Just plain ol  typical  good.   Minus one star because I still smell like it and I m grossed out by that. And so is everyone I work with. Blech.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,324,I ll make this easy.  If Chuy s is omg  your fav place for  Mexican  food  stay far away from here.  No  really  stay away. Go to Chuy s if you want to drink  ritas with your teacher friends and eat queso  their queso IS freaking delicious  or catch up with your parents who are visiting you for the first time in college and who want to eat  ethnic  food they can pronounce. Go to Habanero if you want authentic  cheap  AMAZING Mexican food.  I m Mexican  grew up in San Antonio  and I love to eat.  This place is legit.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,325,This place was bookmarked for some time and I finally got to visit yesterday. Nachos have been on my heart lately and I just had to try their well-regarded version for myself. First of all  Habanero s is super cute. It s tucked away between 1st and Lamar on Oltorf and is a tiny little dig with a cute sign out front and maybe like 15-20 tables insides and outside. It s well lit with a glassed in patio that allows you to feel like you re outside without actually being outside - a perfect spot for brunch. Be warned  it is tiny though so you might have to wait depending on when you come and you will be sitting quite close to your neighbors. Anyway  their menu is the standard Mexican restaurant variety  but their chips are amazing - the lighter crispier kind with air pockets. Just love them. Their salsa is very flavorful  but definitely has a bite to it so don t ruin your meal by going in too hard. I was loving the flavor and my have over done it because my mouth was on fire by the time our meal arrived. Anyway  my friend ordered the beef echiladas verdes for 7.99. The two enchiladas came with a side of rice and beans and salad. Overall  a very tasty dish and priced just right.  I ordered the favorably-reviewed nachos. I went with the nachos supreme  which are listed as having ground beef  refried beans  and white cheese  pretty boring . I wanted something fuller  so I added sour cream  guac  lettuce  and chopped fresh jalapenos  not sure of the added cost here  because I never saw the bill . Of course they used their amazing chips  so the base was solid  however no layering was involved. So  I just got a heap of chips with some topping  very light on the meat and cheese  over the top. Overall  it was unimpressive and not worth a return visit. I would  however  be open to coming back for another item as the enchiladas were legit and the place is cute. In sum  for all you nacho lovers out there  keep it moving.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,326,SOLID mexican food restaurant.  We picked up an order from here of combination fajitas.  Good serving of food  yum rice  amp  beans.  Meat was seasoned well.  They were generous with the chips and salsa. The salsa is is my  1 favorite in Austin.  That s saying a lot   We tried the breakfast tacos too  good 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,327,   Disclaimer - Migas snob review      Typically  I go with the migas anywhere because how a place does their migas says a lot about everything else they make. I ve had migas from all over. Their version was okay. Huge pieces of jalapeno  Uhhh what  The queso snack was exactly what I wasn t hoping for. A cheap plain yellow unauthentic uninspiring bowl of American melted cheese. The weirdest thing to me was that they served fries  called them papas to make to make it sound authentic  with almost every single breakfast plate. I didn t dig this and did not eat them. It was weird  they were weird. Habanero is VERY cheap. And me likes cheap when I m paying for two.  It s very loud here in such a small dining space. The people working here weren t overly friendly or overly unfriendly. The food was do-able  the coffee was flowing though not piping hot. I d return to try lunch or dinner options if it s convenient. I guess.   I honestly can t believe the 4.5 star overall rating with 198 reviews. And trust me  I know my Mexican food    It should never be expensive - check  There should be Lations dining there - check  The tortillas should be fresh  awesome and not pale - nope  They should have the right kind of ranchero sauce for migas - FAIL  It s just MEH 3 stars.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,328,This place is fantastic.  Simple mexican dishes with great flavor.  This place is tiny though.  I believe I counted just 14 total tables   So it can get crowded during peak hours.   CASH ONLY starting May 1  2015  The plates sizes are great.  First trip got  4 combo.  2 beef tacos  any enchilada I wanted  rice  amp  beans.  2nd trip  got fajita taco plate  comes with rice  beans  pico  amp  guac.  Both huge plates.  My tacos both times were stuffed to the top.  I wanted to giver proper review of the steak fajita meat.  It was seasoned  well cooked  bit dry  very lean meat.  Good quality flavor to the steak.  Not the best  but I dig it.  Sides items were fine.  They serve breakfast all day  so I am eager to try some breakfast tacos.  Saw menu had breakfast plate  eggs  beans  potatoes   amp  fajita meat.  The menu has all the basic dishes  but with the allday breakfast options  you have an excellent meal selection.   I think the salsa is top notch  one of the best I have had in Austin.  Salsa is just mild  but fresh taste to it.  Great quality.  Chips are just average.  Soda served in chilled cans with tall ice glass   I think their service is very quick and friendly.  When you are done  pay at the register.   Small parking lot  you will likely park on the street.  It is right next to S 1st   Oltorf.   There are several different mexican food styles out there in Austin.  The overall Yelp average right now is pretty high  and I agree.  I will be a return customer.  Habanero s cooking style is simple but very tasty.  This small little mexican place  dead center in South Austin  is a great choice.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,329,Every time I come here it is good  Cheap delicious food.  Staff is always nice.  This place is great.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,330,How is it possible to have a place this great in my  backyard  and never really notice  I mean  really... I drive by it almost everyday and while I ve seen the sign  its such a small place I just passed on by.  Today  that changed for ever. I now think this is the BEST Mexican food in the neighborhood   We got there about 1 30  and there was a bit of a line. I guess we waited 15 minutes... maybe... before getting a table. As I mentioned  the place IS small  but they turn tables over fairly rapidly.   We started with iced teas and chips salsa. I love the fact they have the BIG drink glasses here so you aren t sitting around waiting for a refill after you ve emptied the glass in one big gulp.  I gets thirsty sometimes...  Tasty fresh crisp chips with a smoothe spicy salsa... oh yes  very nice   I got the beef fajitas  my sweetie ordered the chicken enchiladas verdes. In no time at all  plates of hot food arrived with a cloud of amazing aromas promising to send our taste buds to Nirvana  and boy how   My fajita plate came with rice and charro beans  pico  shred salad and some chunky homemade guacamole. The sizzling plate accompanying it was covered with peppers  onions  tomatoes and tender tasty beef. I could have used more than two tortillas  and maybe all I needed to do was ask  but I wolfed this food down like I d never eaten before. The beans were the best spiced side I ve ever had at a Tex-Mex place  and despite my weak affection for avocado  I gobbled the guac as well.  My sweeties enchiladas were large and tasty  and had what was likely the best verde sauce we ve tasted.  I hear the desserts are tasty  but I was so stuffed there was no way.  Do yourself a favor... do your taste buds a favor... stop by this place and sample their wares. You won t be sorry.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,331,Don t even bother.  My experience was not good here. Perhaps I went on an off morning but everything was bad.  First of all  I can t believe you have to pay for chips and salsa.  The queso was watery.  The coffee tasted like crap.  I ordered the Machacado. I had a few bites and quit.  It wasn t worth it.  Also  the waitress lied to us.  We asked if they made their own flour tortillas  and she said yes.  But the flour tortillas she brought our sure didn t taste homemade.  Weird.  I m not completely writing off this place because other people seem to really like it  but I m hardly in that part of town so it is unlikely that I will ever be back.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,332,Excuse me waitress  I have a complaint. There seems to be some inconsistancy in these Carnitas. You see  the first bite took approximately 7.4 seconds to melt in my mouth. The second bite took about 5  and the THIRD bite... I chewed maybe once before it was gone    My first visit to Habanero was pretty good. Evidently  I m just not ok with having more than one tongue in my mouth.  Second visit went better. The salsa is delicious as always. Good amount of heat without being too spicy. Their Nachos Special left a little to be desired. It was very tasty  the ground beef is awesome   but underneath all that deliciousness  the chips get soggy.   My boyfriend got the gorditas  and really enjoyed them. The bites that I snuck were quite good.  Only negative  They aren t open for dinner every night.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,333,Another triumph for the mobile Yelp app  So  I came close to living in Bouldin Creek at one point. Had it happened  my whole selection of  local choices  would have been quite different and wonderful. There would have been Polvos  which I adore  but there would have also been Habanero s  or  the  Anti-Polvo s .   Hanabero s has probably the worst name of any Mexican Restaurant in town. I m imagining how they came up with the name  Hmmm...Chile s  Taken. Serrano s  Taken.   The restaurant itself has a pleasing facade resplendent with the requisite palm trees and colorful sign. What you find on the interior is anything but. No hipsters  no happening party scene. No tequila. No....life. Just a slow neighborhood restaurant with a mostly white clientele. In all fairness  though  it WAS Sunday evening. But then a charming waitress comes out and chats it up with my cutie Spanish speaking wife and daughter. And she is no less cool with the gringo English speaking husband. Score    Then comes the food.....   I have to give special props to the Horchata. It was devoid of any chalkiness. It was smooth and creamy. And it taste like....marshmellows. I can dig it. Good chips and red salsa fresh. The chile con queso was nothing special...at first...but it turns out to be a grower. It s buttery  And I find that when it is mixed with the salsa it metastasizes into something killer. In a good way. I ordered a gordita. I m a first timer with gorditas and the masa cake was freshly made on site. Oh my god  The filling was merely there to prevent both sides of the gordita from devouring each other. That s how hot the thing was. So  yes  there were beans and carne asada in there. But the NEXT time I come back  I m just getting the gordita  sans filling  and will eat it with the salsa and queso. Oh yes  and the guac. That was very good too    So  Habanero s taught me a thing or two about Mexican food today. Maybe I ll consider myself an honorary Bouldiner and put this place in regular rotation for my south-of-the-river excursions.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,334,After a long hard Saturday  I turn to Chubs and say hey man lets get us some margaritas  amp  sit on a patio somewhere. Chubs agrees. So we roll. Pass by Habanero. Lets check it out. No there are no margaritas.. and no patio. But there is Mexican food  amp  beer.   Saturday night and there is one waitress and she is killing it. Literally 8 tables in the place  amp  this lady is holdin it down. Her attitude is awesome  genuinely friendly. Another lady helps her out with waters  cleaning tables  etc. and she freaking rocks. Reminds me and Chubs of home. These people are real.   On with the food. Salsa is great very tasty a tad spicy. I got shrimp enchiladas. Tasty sauce  white cheese  great plate - beans  rice  pico all for  6. Chubs gets fajitas  really tasty. They have another salsa that is killer - Habanero. Literally fire. Food is solid. It s good  flavorful   and fresh. Horchata on the weekends is freshly made  amp  delish. Barbacoa is also top 5 in Austin.  This place is a combo of greatness. Good mexican food  awesome service  great price  most plates are between 6-8 . Best part  went back for breakfast   the waitress and her helper again holdin it down  remembered me and Chubs. Where else can you get that kind of hospitality in Austin  Felt gooood..
Habanero Mexican Cafe,335,This is my go-to for hungover Saturday mornings.  Warning   limited hours.  They are only open for dinner Friday and Saturday nights  I believe.  I truly wish that wasn t the case   I am a huge fan of the massive horchatas and the migas plate-plenty huge for sharing or for reheating later while still recovering from that hangover.  I have honestly never eaten anything else but others swear by their food  often referring to it as  San Antonio-style Tex-Mex.     SO TRUE  and that s what I love about it   I have never gone to happy hour here but may have to try it on a Friday evening so that way it gives me one more reason to come back Saturday morning more often.   Also  tamale eaters   You can order them TO-GO and separate from your meal 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,336,Our last day in Austin  we had an early lunch at Habanero Mexican Cafe. We were seeking Tex Mex and supposedly it s the best. There was a wait  but tables turned over quickly. They have excellent salsa to get you started and we also had the chile con queso. It too was tasty. Then  we dug into Nachos Habanero and Fajita Ranchera  same as regular fajitas only with jalapenos. The beef fajitas were a bit tough  I didn t care for the corn tortillas  but aside from that is was a tasty lunch for  25.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,337,Just ate here for the first time. I wasn t expecting much quality considering the prices   2 tacos . I ordered the Enchiladas Especial with a Fajita Ranchera taco on the side and my girlfriend had a grilled veggie taco plate. Everything was great including the vegetarian food. Altogether with queso to start and 3 beers  the final bill was only  30. Very impressed and the quality is better than Chuy s and Guero s.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,338,Great breakfast tacos and really good spicy fajitas. This is a nice mom   pop place where you can get some Tex Mex that has some real heat. The pastor here is also really good  although not the best.   It s a small building and they close early. This is our go to tex mex place and gets four stars. As a matter of perspective  I think Maudie s is terrible but I will go to Chuys if someone else wants to go there. However if I pick the place  it s habanero.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,339,My favorite enchiladas  without mole  in Austin live here.  They are thin  not too greasy  and the cheese is perfectly melded to the tortilla.  I ve been to one too many places that have stuff just oozing everywhere  which grosses me out.    My man frequently orders their fajitas and they are crazy good.  I don t usually like fajitas  but theirs are really tender and well-seasoned.  The first time we ate here  I stabbed at a tiny piece of beef on his sizzling fajita plate and ate it.  My eyes almost popped out of my head.  After that  I proceeded to spear random pieces of beef on his plate and ate them.  I kept saying   mmmmm.  MMMMMMMM.  God .  I was that annoying person in the restaurant.  I couldn t help it.  Their tacos al pastor are really good here  too.  Not too dry and not too saucy  with just enough sourness.    This place has been really consistent in quality.  I always look forward to going here on a sunny day.  It s a great way to kick off a weekend day.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,340,I ve come back to Habanero several times since my first review.   I love this place more and more. It s certainly my go-to in regards to Mexican food  I just hate how it s down near Oltorf while I m up in Burnet..  I consistently have great food and service. The waitresses are attentive and accommodating. You can come in groups  and there s no problem in splitting the check because you pay at the counter  The salsa continutes to knock my socks off as well. Why is only the first basket free  C mon man...  From what I remember  I ve personally gotten the barbacoa gordita  the beef fajita ranchera  migas  and the carnitas lunch taco. I ve introduced several friends and family to this place  and they leave huge fans as well. The portions are big  and to be honest  the food s simple and no frills  but they do things pretty darn well at Habanero.   I m becoming more adventurous because everything s so tasty. I plan to try the lengua and chicharrones tacos next time. Yum.   I just get frustrated because there s too many things on this menu to try...
Habanero Mexican Cafe,341,Habanero is only open for breakfast and lunch on weekdays  so we thought we d try this place out for lunch  unfortunately . When you walk in  you have to wait to be seated. You wonder how the employees will ever see you behind the ever-growing line of people at the front register  whether they were paying for meals or to-go orders is unclear  but entering customers were surely blocked from sight . By chance  we were spotted by somebody and called before a group of two other guys.   The restaurant is tiny inside  so they crammed as many tables into the restaurant as possible. We were led to one of two tables by the RESTROOM. Delicious. I wouldn t have minded so much if I had not smelled everything or seen an employee pass by me with a plunger in her hand. My experience so far... 3 stars.  FOOD  Chips and salsa. The red salsa is cold and spicy. And probably the best thing there  sadly. We decided to get beef fajita tacos with pico. Tacos at a Mexican cafe isn t much to ask for  is it  In fact  we expected amazing tacos at a Mexican cafe. Instead  we got tacos that were a notch and a half  at the most  above Taco Cabana s. What. The. Hell. The meat was bland  the pico was ok  and the tortilla just fell apart. It was a failure.  SERVICE  She loved to walk by us to the next table to refill their glasses. When our glasses were completely EMPTY. Good looking out. We also sat there for a good 5 minutes after getting our to-go box before realizing...  Hey  Do we pay at the front   so we walked to the register  and yes  we do pay at the front. Thanks for letting us know. We thought that the front register was for to-go orders. Who can tell -- the whole place is so cramped you barely know what s going on.  I doubt I ll come back here. If Mexican cafe means Tex-Mex  I d rather go to Santa Rita s or hey  even Taco Cabana where the service is quick and we get better seating.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,342,Wow  I am so disappointed   I guess I should be happy it s not really very good  since it s a ways away.  It saddens me that every  great Tex-Mex  restaurant I ve been to  on the advice of locals  since moving to Austin has been about on par for the Mexican chains near the malls in Minnesota. Come on  I know it s possible... most places I ve been to in San Antonio kill it.   I love you Austin  you rock in so many ways  but somebody needs to introduce you to good Tex-Mex. I know there are good tacos around  but I like to sit down with margaritas and enjoy a proper meal too.  OK... so it started with a promising series of signs   1. A line  2. A number of VERY heavy folks waiting in said line  3. A number of Mexican folks eating there  not just working there  This had me think I was in for the first killer Tex-Mex in Austin  but nope...  As I read the menu  I saw a note that said that sharing meals would be charged at  3 per extra plate  as the prices were low and the servings large. So  I expected a healthy portion of the beef fajitas ranchera everybody reviewed so well.  While waiting  I got the chips and salsa. The chips were cold and seemed store-bought  but the salsa was good.  When the food came  I immediately was disheartened. The beans weren t refried  but a flavorless pinto soup instead. The rice was very plain and tasted like it came pre-packaged. The  healthy portions  included 2 tortillas  I asked for more  and got 1 more   and an average to below average amount of fajita meat and veggies.  I hoped to dip in and find the spicy  flavorful meat  and realize it was all delicious  but it only got worse.  The fajita meat was dry  chewy  flavorless  and had no heat. They also had onions  jalapenos  and unripe tomatoes. The veggies were either burned or undercooked.  The tortillas  both of them  tasted like they came from HEB.  Guac and pico were OK  but no sour cream.  Subpar service  not-that-large portions  not-so-great prices  awful food... a sorry state of affairs... REALLY... 4.5 stars  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,343,Charming Mexican food restaurant with authentic Tex-mex.  Good food and reasonable prices. We enjoyed it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,344,Wednesday lunch.  Every Wednesday lunch for years.  The Chicken Fajita Ranchera is fantastic.  Since everything is made from scratch  the salsa spiciness varies from week-to-week  as well as the spiciness of the fajitas.  But the flavors remain consistently wonderful.  I switched from flour to corn tortillas about a year ago and never turned back.  The charro beans and rice compliment the meal.  Of course Arturo and the beautiful ladies working there are always friendly and make it like eating at home.  Why would I eat anywhere else on a Wednesday 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,345,What is it about GREAT places that makes you wanna review them and avoid the places that suck  I d say that it relates to my eternal optimism  wannabe  such as laying off the news like a bad meth habit.  Habanero s is the ultimate in authentic mexican food and this coming from a couple that grew up in San Antonio. At its core  its a true family business complete with kids that screw with your head behind the counter... they know your name here   First  it s priced like its ingredients   cheap  Second  it s GREAT like its staff   Mexican  Third  it s funny like its picture wall   cakeface  Fourth  it s reminiscent that people are all the same  like   Cheers   Everything is  As good as it gets  here. Breakfast  lunch  dinner. Authentic. And we had to hear about it from friends that visit from California  wtf.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,346,I don t know why this restaurant gets such high ratings. The cheese enchiladas are chewy and tough  the chips are cold  the place is cramped  cash only  I think I ll head to South Lamar to Matt s where it is always good.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,347,Yelp clearly doesn t need anymore reviews of this amazing restaurant  with 40 already. And you  dear reader  shouldn t need any more encouragement to put down the computer and grab your car keys or just RUN to Habanero s. So why am I writing this    It was THAT good. I m not sure why it took me so long to find this place  maybe its because they re in a semi-remote location   Oltorf  west of the S.Congress HEB   surrounded mostly by residential homes. While we were eating  and enjoying sitting by the window  we started contemplating moving next door. It s the perfect neighborhood restaurant  casual  comfortable  friendly  good prices  superlative food. A nice change from the overcrowded  over-priced  over-trendy restaurants down Congress  like Doc s or Gueros. I got the impression that most customers were regulars  and I can understand why. I m hooked.   Prices were awesome  we split the chicken and beef fajitas for 2. Smokey  flavorful  though a little bit chewy  the beef was outshone by the chicken. The chicken was juicy  spicy-limey  and charred to perfection. Wrap a bit of meat in home made tortillas with flavorful and fresh pico  caramelized onion and peppers  and you ve got a little bite of perfection.   Don t underestimate the beans and rice here  both are cooked perfectly  and a far cry from the usual cheap filler you d find at any other restaurant. I could go back  and eat just the sides. Also  I think next time I might ask for a straw with the salsa  it was that good.   Some quirks  no patio  no liquor license  but they have every mexican beer I ve ever heard of in a bottle. Each fajita plate comes with 2 tortillas  and extras cost you. Same with a refill on chips  but your first chips and salsa a free if you buy dinner or lunch. Prices are otherwise excellent  but it s worth mentioning. Also it s closed Sundays.   I m gonna be back for the lunch specials.  5.50 with free chips and salsa  Knocks the socks off of a subway  5 foot long.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,348,Serviceable TexMex  Everything I ve had here is adequate. Not great  Not bad  Just good. And therein lies the problem. With delicious  affordable TexMex on almost every corner in town  this one doesn t do much to stand out. But there are other drawbacks. The prices are good  but make sure you bring cash. They ve chosen to regress  unlike the rest of society  and are now a cash only establishment.  Maybe by 2017 they ll trade you some fajitas for a handful of shells and some carved bone  Another word of warning  The place is small. Tiny. We went during a peak traffic time  noon on Sunday . The wait for 3 of us was supposed to be 15 minutes. It ended up being 45. And believe me  the food is worth a 15 minute wait. 45  though  No way.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,349,Authentic Mexican food  Good salsas and the food and beer was so cheap. A must if you re in Austin 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,350,If I bring breakfast tacos to work  this is where I buy them. The sauce and actually scrambled eggs are excellent. Always end up referring folks.  Sit down service is great also  I d recommend it for hungover breakfast. Coffee is pleasantly devolid of bitterness and service is prompt. There s not much else I could ask of a mexican place  I love it here.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,351,I don t know why it has taken me so long to eat here considering I drive by multiple times each week.  I m so glad I finally went in a couple of weeks ago because Habanero filled a Mexican food void in my life.    I m originally from San Antonio and will say that though Austin has some amazing Mexican food  it s just not like old San Antone.  Habanero reminds me of so many of the little places in San Antonio - simple food  inexpensive and very delicious.    I ve had cheese enchiladas  gorditas and a handful of other items.  Each has been delicious.    Now each time I drive by I have to resist pulling over.  What an  awful  problem to have     
Habanero Mexican Cafe,352,FOOOOOD coma warning. Allocate at least 30 minutes after eating here for a nap.  This place is amazing. I love coming on the weekend for the Horchata. It s probably the best I have had so far and the portion is delightful. The way I always describe Horchata is that it tastes like the milk after you eat a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch. Except Horchata is made from rice and has no dairy so it s completely safe for lactose intolerant people    The first time I came here I had the Gordita with Al Pastor which was pretty good. This time  I came for a carnitas taco and barbacoa taco. My favorite taco joint is El Taquito but man does Habanero give them a run for their money. The barbacoa is just as good and their portions are bigger. They definitely do not skimp out on their tacos. I wish I had a lime and it would have been perfecto. The chips and salsa is soooo good too. I usually can t handle spicy but I take the heat for the salsa. Good thing I have a large glass of horchata to take out the fire.  And after all of that great great food  it s time to snuggle and take care of that food coma.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,353,Delicious  authentic Mexican food  Got take out since the line was a bit long  but it didn t take too long to get our food.  The service here was great and friendly 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,354,We went here today for lunch. The husband got the Chicken Enchilada Verdes and was less than thrilled.  I told him he should be more adventurous.  I got 3 tacos and my stomach was having a happy fun time experience. I got the al pastor  carne asada  and the barbacoa all on corn tortillas.  If I had to rank them  the barbacoa was best  al pastor next  and last  but not bad at all  was the carne asada.  The barbacoa was rich  moist  and pretty much fan-freaking-tastic.  The al pastor had a nice flavor  but wasn t as amazing at the barbacoa.  Think of the comparison as an A   to an A- effort.  Both are good grades  but there s a clear difference.  The Carne was a good B  taco  to continue the theme .  It lacked the deep flavors the other two had.  If that was the only one I had  I would have thought it was good  but the other two blew my socks off so it was the weakest link on the plate.  I had a great meal at a great price  about 2 bucks a taco .  One word of warning... the salsa with the complimentary chips.  It s hot.  Really  really spicy.  I like spicy.  I eat spicy.  This stuff  however  gets you on the backside of the bite.  Most foods slap you around after you bite into it and the heat fades.  When I dipped my chip in and ate it  I was all  oh... this is spicy  but not too bad...   About 15 seconds later when my entire palate caught fire and I spilled part of my tea on the paper I was reading in an attempt to extinguish the flames  I noticed this salsa was not messing around with the heat... it just likes to play a bit coy at first.  It was good... really good  but it smacked me around like a dishrag for the first couple bites.  Overall  I really liked this place and plan to come back soon.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,355,Was leaving a float the river trip on the Guadalupe and was craving some really good Mexican food early in the morning on the way back to Fort Worth. Saw this place online  saw that it had great reviews  so we gave it a shot. Good  authentic food for a really good price. DEFINITLY coming back on my way back down to San Antonio.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,356,This is a second home to us.  Not because we eat out a lot but because when we want to spend money and want Mexican food  there is no comparison with their real homemade cooking.  Been going here since 1999 and has never disappointed...not even once.  My husband and our children have fallen in love with it ever since I ve brought them.  My husband can eat here everyday and he cn t say that about any other place.  We have tried everything from their menudo  steak ranchero  enchiladas  torta  with carnitas is the best   ground meat in their tacos and anything else with minimal grease is so full of flavor  as everything else  EVERYTIME   And to start you off right  the salsa and queso are close to perfect each time.  Have had the same wait staff  with some addition due to popularity  and always know us by name and make us feel like we re at home.  Arturo and his family are a staple to South Austin and it would not be Austin without Habanero Cafe 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,357,My family and I went here on Valentine s Day because it was impossible to find a seat anywhere else.  We should have known we were going to be disappointed when we arrived to find the place not busy at all  and were immediately seated  on the busiest restaurant day in the U.S. .  Needless to say  everything was disappointing about our meal.  The rice was bland and flavorless.  The beans were bland and flavorless.  The chicken in my quesadilla was the driest chicken I had ever tasted  and the chicken in my mom s flauta was the driest chicken she had ever tasted as well.  I thought being in Austin  a town known for Mexican food  and seeing the high ratings on Yelp on this restaurant was a good sign- but now it s obvious to me that the reviews on this restaurant are mostly fake  because there s no way it deserves anything more than 1 star.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,358,The migas plate is my favorite. Delicious food and great service make it a wonderful experience.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,359,After reading all the Yelpers RAVE over this place we headed over to check it out.  If a place has menudo on the menu and Mexican candies at the register...well  that s a great first impression   Then the chips and salsa have to pass the test.  They did   Light  crispy chips in what appeared to be homemade salsa. Mmmm...we killed 2 baskets.  My husband and I split the menudo for an appetizer.  VERY good.  The color was just right  the meat to hominy ratio was perfect  and the jalapenos onion mixture was fresh.  My hubby got the barbacoa torta  Mexican sandwich on a bolillo roll  and snarfed it down.  I got the barbacoa plate - huge portion of meat  charro beans  YES   and rice with salad.  Since we ate so many chips and salsa and menudo  I couldn t finish my meal.  Thank goodness my husband always does   Love ya honey   We left there with full tummies and smiles.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,360,This place is tiny but the service turns those tables around quick   The staff is really nice considering how busy they are. They have lunch specials every day. We order some chili con queso that was pretty unremarkable. I had cheese enchiladas that were really good. I liked the rice. It tasted just like my mom s.   If you re looking for a fast  cheap lunch spot. This is  great place to check out. They have a  10 min. on cards so it s probably best to bring cash.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,361,Great little Mexican joint  I came here with my girlfriend last weekend. I had the chicken fajitas that were coated with the right amounted of spices and seasonings  grilled to perfection over a bed of caramelized onions and grilled bell peppers. The fajitas came with a side of guacamole  rice  beans and lettuce. The chips and salsa were a great starter and I used the salsa with my chicken fajitas and they were amazing.    My girlfriend had barbacoa and carnitas tacos  which were just as great as El Taquito but the portions seemed larger. Added with a Horchata drink and you ll be happy as a kid high on sugar.    This place is great for college students as well. The prices seem very reasonable for those on a budget.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,362,Best tex-mex in Austin  The salsa is fresh  spicy and the perfect dipping consistency. My favorites here are the chicken enchiladas verdes  carnitas plate and breakfast tacos.   Service is always very friendly and quick.  I only wish they served margaritas and were open for dinner more than just on Friday and Saturday  Do yourself a favor and try this place.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,363,It was absolutely delicious  It is a small establishment  but even though we got during peak dinner hours  we waited less than 10 minutes for a seat. Please note that after May 1  2015 they will only take cash because of the high fees charged by card companies. My date and I both got the gordita plate and were super pleased. We were stuffed to the brim and it only cost us like  8 a piece  who could ask for better 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,364,Ever since my friends introduced me to this place I ve always had the barbacoa plate. I think it s the best barbacoa I ve ever had so far. It s very tender  moist  and goes well with corn tortillas. Before you start your meal  they give you a basket of chips which I think are better than most places because they aren t greasy and that one bite you take breaks it so crisply. The salsa that goes with it has got a slight kick in it but it s not  overwhelmingly spicy  it is made just right   I ve also had their horchata and it s really delicious. They give you a huge cup so you re not being cheated with a small cup size.  The hours of business are quite short on some days and my friend never bothers to remember them so just don t forget otherwise you ll end up at a closed sign.  Overall the prices are great and definitely worth every penny. Though  I might add  you need to spend at least  10 I believe in order to use a credit card.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,365,Habanero s is the best Mexican food I have ever had.  Anywhere.  Period.  And I m of Mex-Am heritage  loved my grannies  they could do no wrong in the kitchen....but I think even they d prefer to eat here.  Living in Cali  and having lived in Texas  I ve eaten at a ton of Mex restaurants.  This is one of the most humble places you ll find  with friendly staff  and some people in the kitchen that do a simple but amazingly good job.  Barbacoa.  Why  oh why  oh why....WHY can t I find it in Los Angeles  where I live    They make such a fine barbacoa  and I m usually at Habanero s within 12 hours of my arrivals in Austin to gorge on it.  Carne Guisada.  Tender tender meat  perfect gravy.   Even after gorging on barbacoa  I usually embarass myself by ordering some carne guisada tacos  cuz even with a fully belly it s just too good to be missed.  Those chips and salsa  like everyone says  they are amazing.  And every other staple dish is soooo reliably good.  Funny  somehow most of my local friends haven t been to Habanero s  and it takes one of my visits to drag them here....but they re always converted.  What s it about this small unpretentious place that makes some people shy away...until they ve tried it for the first time     Anyways  you get the idea.....GO and ENJOY 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,366,I am as surprised as you are. I have read rave review after rave review and knew deep in my soul this would be one of the best Mexican lunches I ever had. The problem is  it just wasn t.  It sure is a popular place. We waited for about 40 minutes for a table. No problem  that s what I expected. The hostess then proceeded to POINT to our table rather than to take us to it.  I had to get another set-up from an adjoining table.   Our server arrived promptly and we got our cold drinks on time. We read that the fajitas and gorditas were not to be missed  so that s all we ordered. 2 gorditas and one beef fajitas and one chicken fajitas.   The gordita shell  or bun or whatever  was crispy and tasty  but the center was over-filled with meat. It made it a little unmanageable but mostly not as tasty as it could have been with the proper ratio of meat to lettuce to tomato to bread  or shell or whatever .   The fajitas were good. They were not great. At least  not my batch  beef . The seasoning was good  but the cuts were bordering on tough and certainly were chewy and a bit sinewy. The mesquite flavor did not shine through  but it was there. The flavor was good  but the mouth-feel was not. Additionally  the large portion  a good thing  came with only 2 tortillas  which were good by the way . This forces you to ask for more. They would do well to provide 4 instead. The chicken fajitas were tasty  but again the mesquite did not shine through as I d hoped.   The rancho beans were some of the best I ve ever had.   Ambiance is uber-casual  loud  typical busy Mexican restaurant.   The prices we great  which is why I will definitely go back to try other menu items  like the breakfast tacos I ve read so much about.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,367,The best fajita ranchera ever  I order it every time I go  and crave it any meal I am not there 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,368,Inexpensive and tasty  not the best mexican food I ve had but definitely fulfills it s spicy purpose.  I only wish they were open later on weekdays  but alas I will have to suffice with breakfast tacos and plates on those days.    A word of warning about the carne asada fajitas...whatever peppers they use are seriously spicy  and I enjoy a lot of spice   at one point I must have eaten an entire cluster of seeds and couldn t taste anything else for five minutes.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,369,This is my favorite Tex-Mex Mexican restaurant in Austin.  Habanero is a hole in the wall spot on Oltorf  just east of S. 1st St.  It s primarily open for breakfast and lunch  but dinner is also served on the weekends.  At lunch  expect about a 15 minute wait.  If that s too long for you  I m deeply sorry for your loss.     My favorite dish is the 2 enchilada 1 crispy beef taco combo.  Mix it up a little and order 2 different types of enchiladas.  You won t be disappointed.  The crispy beef taco is a MUST TRY   There isn t a better one in Austin.  For the vegs  the beans are sans lard  and the veggie taco is delicious.  Corn tortillas are definitely the way to go across the board.  Give Habanero a try   It s the best Tex-Mex in town.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,370,Sure  the place is small but the true judgement of Mexican food should be based on taste.  This might be the best plate of Mexican I ve ever had.  I m sitting in the parking lot writing this review still stuffed from my fajita tacos.  Friendly staff  tasty food  and I am anointing Habanero s as the BEST Mexican food in town   And I hate saying that because there are too many folks there now.  Off hours are best. Wait until after 1pm and there shouldn t be a wait.  Wonderful food  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,371,Really love this place - the food is tasty  they give great portions  and the service is good. The only knock is that they aren t open on certain days and hours that fit into my schedule. If you can t always be available  then how can I give you 5 stars  Still whenever I get the chance  I make sure to swing by.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,372,I don t know how I have missed out on Habanero for so long  but man  it is tasty. And affordable. And top-notch in service. And conveniently located. And no-frllls. And all of the above to the max quality. Maybe because the neighboring roads has it in some major construction... but look past that.  The menu is quite expansive  and it definitely scared me at first. Then  I looked past that and saw that perhaps with the affordability  I could in fact get a meal with my buddies on the cheap  regardless if it it was good or not. To our surprise  it turned out to be absolutely killer.  The iconic torta is undoubtedly a hidden treasure on most Mexican menus  and it is no different here. It comes chock full of your meat of choice  and they do it up with some tomato  peppers  and white cheese. The fajita meat surprised me. Normally  you figure fajita meat to be tough  bland  and just mediocre all around. Not in this case  Flavorful and meaty as can be.  The breakfast platters are ridiculous. For  7 or so  you get eggs  beans  tortillas  meat  fries galore. Wowzers. The breakfast tacos are also a steal. They are stuffed ot the seams... and the  0.50 side o  guac really sets Habanero apart. The guac is finely crafted  though nothing fancy... but a large scoop for half a buck  Wow.  All I can say is  although the salsa is not top notch  you really cannot go wrong with a meal here. Your experience will be far superior than those found at other Tex-Mex establishments  and I truly do think that you will find your time here to be quite enjoyable.  Oh   0.25 for a side o  fried jalapenos  Yes  please.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,373,Love.  The prices are very reasonable.  The food is delicious and the chips salsa are so tasty... mmmm  just thinking about the vegetarian taco plate  makes my mouth water.  The staff is very friendly and on whim refill the salsa and your drinks.    I wished they d have more days they were open for dinner but otherwise I think it s def worth checking out.  For some good Mexican tacos and food  this place is it 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,374,I have never craved a Mexican restaurant the way I crave Habanero s  I don t live in Austin anymore  and I contemplate moving back just to be closer to Habanero s.  It s small and you ll definitely have to wait at lunch  but it s well worthit. The staff us so friendly - I hadn t been back in a year and they still remembered me  Vegetarian options are usually gross at Mexican restaurants  but not at Habanero s. Their veggies are seasoned and cooked well - and the mix of zucchini  onions  mushrooms and tomatoes is a great break from spinach and cheese. The meat is also seasoned amazingly well  and the chicken gordita is one of my favorite things on the menu.  The salsa is...drinkable for lack of a better word  and the rice and beans served alongside the dish are yummy  not just space fillers.   I m a native Texan and have eaten Mexican food all over TX and in Northern and Southern California - and no place has come close to Habanero s.   Go early  go often  and tip well.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,375,I am convinced that there is a little Abuela cooking back there.  This food is delicious flavor merging with the at-home authenticity of a Mexican grandmother.  Migas  fajitas  gorditas are all great.  I was even convinced that I should try lengua  tongue taco .  While that was more authentic than I really ever saw myself going  this place has inspired me to try something new 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,376,Went to Habanero on Sunday at about 9am.  Called ahead and ordered 3 egg  potato and chorizo tacos.   5.03 with tax.  They were ready when I arrived.  The tacos were good  hot and fresh.  However  I m not a fan of their chorizo.  It tastes a lot like chili.  I maybe spoiled because I really love the chorizo at Vic s.  It s drier and spicier.    Overall   This place has really good food and really good prices.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,377,What s all the fuss about   The people are nice  the food is acceptable. But it s small and loud  and the food is nothing special. Greasy  average ingredients  etc. You get what you pay for  and the place is cheap.  Not knocking it  but 4.5 stars  Fuhgettabout it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,378,How can I do Habanero justice  I ve been coming here since I was a baby. When I was little  I stuck to the cheese enchiladas  then graduated to the chicken enchiladas. The red sauce is fantastic and the fillings are cooked well. Now  I usually get something with barbacoa  such as the barbacoa plate  where you get a huge pile of barbacoa  or the barbacoa gordita  a speciality of the restaurant. The barbacoa is amazing - moist  fatty  and delicious  On every plate  you get a huge amount of beans  rice  and pico - which are all amazing. Oh  and their salsa is great as well. If you like it spicy  ask for the special habanero salsa. I can t handle it  but my dad swears it s great.   All in all  Habanero will always hold a special place in my heart. It s cheap  delicious  and reminds me of home. It won t hold this significance for everyone  but at the very least you can find a great meal.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,379,I ve always believed that the best gauge of the quality of an ethnic restaurant is whether natives of that cuisine actually eat there. That being said  I m fairly certain that this was the first Mexican restaurant that I ve ever been to in which there were actual Mexican people at the tables - eating. In the end  I m not necessarily convinced that this place is worthy of its  current 4.5 star rating  but it s still a perfectly solid Mexican restaurant nonetheless.   Food  Habanero offers an extensive assortment of authentic Mexican fare  including tacos  fajitas  enchiladas  flautas  burritos  gorditas  and tortas. Breakfast  lunch  and dinner are served  but unfortunately  margaritas are not - they do offer beer and wine  but the selection is quite limited. Complimentary chips and salsa are served with the order of any entree  but additional baskets cost extra - however  the chips aren t really that memorable   so you likely won t have to worry about incurring the added cost. During my recent visit  I ordered the chicken fajitas  which was good   but nothing extraordinary - the chicken was tender and the portion was generous  but the tortillas tasted as if they were mass produced and the vegetables were all fairly standard.    Service  Attentive  fluent  and  friendly. First time diners at Habanero should know that the waitresses do not bring a receipt at the conclusion of the meal - the cashier retains all the receipts and patrons are expected to pay  at the front counter upon exiting the restaurant.   Atmosphere  This place makes a closet look like a mansion - the dining room consists of two small rooms and the only way the tables could get any closer together would be if you were to stack them. As such  seating is at a premium and you should expect to wait during peak dining hours. Dress is very casual and the clientele is predominately locals  most of whom are Mexican American.  Cost  Reasonably priced. All entrees are less than  15 and lunch combos are generally  5- 10. Credit cards are accepted.   Other  The hours of operation listed on Yelp are not accurate - Habanero is open Sunday-Monday  7AM-3PM  Tuesday-Thursday  7AM-5PM  and Friday-Saturday  7AM-9PM. Reservations are not accepted. Free parking is available in the restaurant s private lot  which can be accessed via Durwood St. Catering and call-in orders are accepted.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,380,This place is one my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Austin.  You can tell a lot from the rice  amp  beans... they are phenomenal.  Big hunks of jalapeno and bacon in the borracho beans and a great tomato tang to the rice.  My favorites are the  Rancheras  dishes.  They spice things up with two handfuls of sliced fresh jalapenos.  Spicy heaven.  The staff are extremely friendly and you learn the faces of the waitresses very quickly.  Great service with great food keeps me coming back time and time again.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,381,We went here based on its great yelp reviews and it didn t disappoint. The chips  amp  salsa were excellent  Be aware that the salsa is spicy  no surprise considering the name of the restaurant. Also  the chicken fajita tacos were very good. I would rec the chicken over the beef.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,382,This place would have received a better rating but we did not have good service. The food was good and my husband found a place with hot sauce that was hot enough for him. However  this was our first visit and we were not sure about this place cause it is small but went in anyway. We looked at the menu online beforehand and wanted sopapillas. We were seated and after our drinks were delivered we never saw our waitress again. A different waitress delivered our food. When we first sat down we asked if they had the sopapillas we were told yes. Then when done with our meal and asked for them they informed us the kitchen was closed. We only stayed to try the sopapillas cause we were going to go somewhere else. When checking out and asked how it was and I told the manager he just said he was sorry...nothing else.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,383,Mark M and I journeyed over here for lunch on nothing more than chance as we passed by.  The TexMex Gods were smiling on us that day. Amazing chips and salsa  Fabulous picadillo enchiladas  rice and beans that are perfect  Mark M got the carne guisada and it was pretty yummy  as well.   This is now my favorite hole in the wall TexMex place in Austin.   Mmmmmmmmm   mmmmmmmmmmm  good 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,384,I heart this place.  its affordable  delicious  and never open when I drive by.  Come on Habanero  expand your hours and I will give you 5.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,385,Lines are long but worth the wait  The owner was the guy who took our order at the counter and was super nice and helpful  Great vibe. We got our stuff to go and ate it at a little park literally behind the parking lot.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,386,Wow the fajitas...I did not know they could be like this Tex mex was always a throwaway shit food in my mind till I had these. The charo beans were fucking great. But the steak fajitas good lord....
Habanero Mexican Cafe,387,If I could give this place 3.5 starts I would.  But considering the staunch competition in my hood  I will go ahead and give it 3.  My husband and I checked this place out for lunch one Saturday after reading all the great reviews on Yelp.    This place  like some of its neighbors Neuva Onda and La Mexicana  features a very standard menu of Mexican food.  Yet I believe this place has a more extensive selection since they are open for dinner on the weekends  I think      Service was friendly and attentive  despite the fact that there were only a couple of waitresses tending to the whole place.  Yet the space is definitely not ideal for a relaxing lunch.  We didn t wait very long to get a table  about 15-20 minutes - which is speedy when taking into consideration the longer wait times at other places around Austin for weekend lunch.  However  our two person party was relegated to a very small table with verrryyy little elbow room  right next to the restrooms.  It was unnerving to have to dodge the swinging doors.  We also found ourselves constantly adjusting our table to prevent a man from our neighboring table from grazing his buttocks against our queso as he came up from his chair.    The man and I split a small serving of queso  which came out pleasantly buttery and - well  cheesy.   -   Their salsa  however  is killer.  It s definitely one of the best I ve had in town.  We also shared the beef fajitas for two  since the menu stated that the mesquite grilled bovine was their specialty.  The end result was good  but not the best.  I could taste the mesquite and the beef appeared to be heavily seasoned.  I believe it may have been the cut of beef that was sub par...I m not sure.    Yet  we were overall happy with the value...We dined for only 30 bucks.  This includes chips  salsa  queso  fajitas for two  two Pacificos and two Cokes.  Not bad 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,388,this is a neighborhood joint.... very small  but the service is fast and friendly.. I found the pastor to be very good.. also the gordita s are muy beuno.. I will surely be back for a followup..   you can read about all my taco explorations on my blog   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.tacotown.org amp s 7c8940a50440c86e97317a383ed950e9561b4cd1f042de102a73dfcc035130c6  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  tacotown.org  a 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,389,More hype than substance. Edible. Could be cleaner.  Nice people.  The food is in the bottom 20  of Mexican food places in Austin. The restaurant smell  sticky tables and mildewy atmosphere puts it in the bottom 10  for restaurants in Austin. The friendliness of the staff is in the top 20 .  No full bar  just bottled beer. So it s hard to drink yourself into acceptance.  Plenty of food trucks would out do Habaneros.  I wanted to see if all the great reviews were substantiated. But unfortunately it seems quite over rated in a city with too many great options to spend meals on the stragglers. . Sad  but oh so true.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,390,Habanero  hands down  is my favorite restaurant in all of Austin  and perhaps the world.  Okay  that might seem a little dramatic  but I mean it. I have never  ever ever had anything that I haven t loved off the menu  and even still while I m currently on a strict diet  no dairy  flour  grains  etc   they are more than willing to accomodate my picky-ness. Everyone here is so super sweet and wonderful and I look forward to what my fiance and I call  Habanero Friday  every week. Seriously  we ve been going here every Friday since we ve been together - for 5 years. So if you re ever there on a Friday  we probably are too.   I am constantly singing Habanero s praises from the rooftops  it really is the best. My favorites are the crispy tacos  the chicken fajita two taco plate  the quesadillas with beef fajita  the combo plates  and well -- everything. And their charro beans are chock full of bacon and amazingness  so be sure to try them sometime in lieu of refried beans. Perfect chips and salsa  perfect iced tea. Every time. Seriously  you won t find better mexican in town  and its super reasonably priced  to boot.   I love you  Habanero  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,391,I would eat here for every meal if I could  Everything is so good. The salsa is amazing. EAT HERE.  I would eat here for every meal if I could  Everything is so good. The salsa is amazing. EAT HERE.  So good  I said it twice 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,392,Great food and friendly atmosphere   They have plenty to offer in their menu. Cheese enchiladas were awesome and far from the Tex-Mex flavor this area serves.   Reminds me of the food from my hometown of El Paso  TX 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,393,This is definitely a small family-run joint with a good vibe and solid food. Granted  i ve only been there once  but definitely plan to return. What i like about places like this is that there is a diverse crowd which suggests to me that people come here for the offerings as opposed to it being a scene.  First of all  the salsa is great and we were provided with a refill before our main dish arrived. We ordered the fajitas  partly because so many reviewers mention them  and because it was what we were really craving.   amp  they did not disappoint.  The peppers and onions were flavorful and the meat was tasty.  I love beans and guacamole and was happy to have them here  though the beans might have been a bit salty. I was glad i could order corn tortillas.   The breakfast menu looks great and i hope to try that soon.  Perhaps the only downside is that the cups smell strongly of bleach - but at least you know they are clean 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,394,Habanero - I had no idea how special you were until now  when 1 424 miles of roadway separate us. These nice Californians may think that LA is full of  mexican  food but there s not even a place to get chips and queso. But I digress.   I d eaten at Habanero a dozen times over three years and everything I ve ever ordered has been great. That s partially because the kitchen knows what they re doing and partially because I ordered a pretty narrow range of things  free chips and hot sauce  which is one of my favorites in town   queso  best for weekend brunch - read  when your first meal of the day is at 2 pm   the beef fajita ranchera  the machacado plate and various tacos  usually with the previously mentioned BFR or machacado and eggs . A negro modelo or diet coke help round-out my idea of the perfect tex-mex meal.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,395,Habanero is the kind of place you could take a date  or your entire family  or just treat yourself. It s super 78704 and super delicious. I think the best time to go is brunch  but I m a little partial. However  BREAKFAST ALL DAY so don t even worry if you need Migas at 3pm  which I usually do  but you missed the usual brunchy hours.   Are there things I think they could do better  Yes. They don t have soft drinks  the coffee is just okay  and I m not a huge fan of the breakfast potatoes  aka fries . But the amaaaaaazingly spicy-yet-flavorful salsa  great service  super reasonable prices  neighborhood feel  and overall solid food make this place a total win.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,396,Best migas in Austin. I ve been on a quest for quite some time to find Austin s best migas. And I ve found them. I went about a month ago and had a great experience with their migas and I finally went back again today. I was curious whether or not they would live up to last time. Sure  enough. Wow. Especially wow when you load the taco up with their red salsa.  the extra kick dramatically improves the flavor experience   I had to bite my tongue not to tell everyone looking at their menu s to just trust me and order the migas.  Note  I have not gotten the  migas plate  only the migas taco s individually. Also  the corn tortillas are tastier than the flour.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,397,They have the best carna asada and enchiladas.  It s hard to find a seat during lunch cause this place is always packed.  I would always drive by this place everyday and it never seemed to be opened.  But once i got a taste of this place i couldn t stop
Habanero Mexican Cafe,398,An Austin gem. With all these Austin originals shutting down  I hope this isn t one of them. My favorite Mexican restaurant in town. Family owned  small simple place  great food. Love their gorditas  breakfast tacos  and their spicy salsa  It s so authentic. And I love their service. They are all the same servers they have had for years. I ve been eating here for a long time but hadn t gone since last year. I am not surprised they remembered me  but they actually remember my name and what I order      They are only taking cash now  I assume it s to keep up with the rising Austin costs. I hope it works because we don t want to lose this one. Where else could I get my favorite gorditas 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,399,Habanero is a South Austin staple--though I can t quite seem to figure out why. I ve never had anything here  other than the salsa  that is better than average  that is overly authentic  or that is nuanced in a positive Tex-Mex way. It s basic  standard Mexican food at an average price. Still worth the trip if you re craving Mexican food.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,400,I can t say this review it all mine. I catered a lunch with them and I ve never had such a response. Everyone loved it  I had three of the six ask me to email them the info. It s not just being nice when they all reminded me more than once.   I phoned in the order. Picking up was easy and super quick. I had ordered enough for 8 with all the bells and whistles...came to  40 and some change. Awesome    I can t wait to go back for myself. If its as good as everyone says it only has one star to go 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,401,Pretty good enchillada and breakfast taco. Large portions. Nice service.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,402,The hubs and I have declared this place our favorite lunch spot  on days we can meet up.  We both are huge fans.....everything we have tried has been great   Caldo is on point     Literally a quick drive from downtown  work  with fast and friendly service - let s not forget to mention it is affordable     Unlike most places in the Austin downtown area. 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,403,It was good  The beef tacos were tender and flavorful and sopapillas were yummy. I really liked the chicken flautas...they were enormous.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,404,I have never been to this restaurant until a friend invite me to go there for lunch. The place was pack for lunch time and you have to park on the street.  The food is really good and the chips  salsa is great.    This restaurant will be receiving a second visit from and I will bring my other half to try it. The people who work there are very friendly and always kept checking on us.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,405,Very good chips and salsa. Thin chips  blended salsa so it s a smooth texture. When I was a kid I hated the  chunks  in salsa and would only dip the chip vertically  so this place seems like it d be good for picky children.  You can choose pretty much any meat for your dish  and the fajita types are spicy and delicious. A great cheap weekend dinner spot 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,406,Seems that more folks are discovering the utter awesomeness that is Habanero. That s fine as long as they don t change a darn thing.  You hear that Habanero   I love you just the way you are   But yeah  I found this little place back in ole  91 or  92. It s the real deal. I particularly love their chuletas rancheras. They are the lunch special on Thursday I believe.  I hope they don t become a victim of their own awesomeness as is all too often the case.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,407,Just thinking of this place makes me happy. I come here for breakfast lunch to fix my hangover. Everything I ve tried is delicious   Migas plate Enchiladas verdes Huevos con chorizo Huevos a la mexicana Barbacoa  can get greasy  Fajita ranchera tacos  great way to clear out your sinuses  Breakfast tacos Huevos gringos  heart attack on a plate  Carne guisada  Always get chips and salsa. They re free with lunch and dinner plates and only  3 otherwise. Also they have all sorts of jaritos including classic Mexican Coke  and the coffee and homemade lemonade are great. Almost all plates are under  6  and tacos are  1.55- 2ish.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,408,Fresh  authentic Mexican. Salsa is made in-house  as are the fluffy tortillas. I can vouch for the chicken fajitas--they are amazing  and the meat is freshly grilled and delicious   One important thing to note  NO MARGARITAS. This place is beer only.   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,409,I love spicy beef fajitas  and this place makes the best.  I don t even bother getting fajitas anywhere else now since it is always a disappointment.  Go there and get fajitas  you ll be glad you did.  The breakfast tacos are a huge hit  too  inspiring lines out the door .  I think they serve them all day  although you should get fajitas if it is after noon   The service is friendly in a family run restaurant kind of way.  In fact  the only thing keeping me from a 5 star rating is that they close early in the evenings during the week when I normally eat dinner  so don t wait as late to eat as I do or you ll miss something special.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,410,French Fries   Mexican Food   Love  So as of recently  I am currently on the search for the BEST breakfast taco in Austin.  I know know  big title  right now my boyfriend is winning  but wooooo - Habanero is proving to be some serious competition. We pretty much stumbled upon this restaurant a few weeks ago  always knowing it was there  but forgot about it when it was restaurant decision time.  Now I know why it always slipped our mind  b c we never had it before.  This place is hands down one of the best mexican places I ve had in Austin.  The staff is adorable and they might all be part of the same family... who knows.  Either way  it s a great atmosphere.  Breakfast taco plates that come with French Fries and Enchilada plates that melt in your mouth.  So next time you re in South Austin  don t forget about Habanero  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,411,We had a large group come in for a late lunch. We were told that it was going to be a 35 minute wait. I had heard Habanero got the Best Restaurants of Austin 2012. If I would have known this place was so small  I would have opted for some other place. The wait was more than 35 minutes  plus there was no air moving. I had called Cuervos down the street. They had no wait at all. We were about to get up and leave.   We were finally seated and our order was taken. That one thing that drives me nuts is when restaurants only have can soda  so there are no refills. The salsa is very flavorful. It had the right amount of heat. Our food came out quickly. The rice was good. The guacamole had no flavor to it at all. I expected the Habanero burrito to have a bit more bite to it. It was good. I usually have a problem when restaurants do not flavor their meat for their tacos. The meat in the burrito was flavorful as well.  I will say the food here is awesome. This is one of the better Mexican restaurants I have eaten at. I took off stars for the long wait. I did see extra tables that did open up that they could have sat us at in the front porch area. This place is not in my normal stomping grounds. I would probably go back if I had a smaller party.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,412,The food here is decent and definitely affordable but it s not quite good enough for me to make multiple returns. I ve been a handful of times and have never been disappointed  however  I think there are better places to grab a bite to eat.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,413,I have eaten dinner here on several Saturday nights. It s usually pretty full  but not packed  and I don t think we ve ever had to wait.  Not waiting for a great Mexican meal in South Austin on a Saturday night is.... well  great  I usually order the catfish ranchero  which comes with beans  whole in the cup or refried... the whole ones are better   tortillas  rice  peppers  onions -- the works. The catfish is pretty clean and lean  and I really like the spices they use. Which reminds me that the food is pretty spicy. I probably should have been tipped off by the restaurant name.   Once  during a trip to the Yucatan peninsula  I  accidentally  ate some pico de gallo made from raw habanero peppers. As I coughed and spat  the waitress in the corner laughed beneath her hands. I don t think the waitresses at Habanero The Restaurant would laugh because they are too nice  plus they bring enough beer to scratch that spicy itch that often comes from eating here.  Bottom line  solid food  good location. Cheap. I like it.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,414,Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Casual atmosphere.  Be nice.  Tip well.  They re worth it   We drive from Pflugerville to eat there on a regular basis  it s just that good.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,415,The service is always good here. Wait staff is always friendly  quick  and attentive  Five stars because the food is ALWAYS great 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,416,Great hole in the wall Mexican. Amazing salsa  fajitas  green sauce  caldo  and charro beans. Haven t had anything from here I didn t like.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,417,First of all  I grew up in El Paso and this influences my option. This is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Austin. Great food. I love their tacos  enchiladas  and gorditas. Yummy hot salsa. Friendly staff. Fast service. My only complaint is that they aren t open as often as I d like.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,418,I had the carne asada and my husband had the menudo. Very spicy carne I should have shared the plate there was to much food on the plates to finish. This is our second time at this restaurant  now we will make it a staple for our trips to Austin.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,419,I couldn t be more grateful to Patrick L. for taking me here. I absolutely love the food. The meal started off amazing with some of the greatest tortilla chips and salsa I have ever had. Just thinking about it now makes me hungry.   The meal continued with a beef gordita  2 barbacoa tacos  1 chicken fajita and 1 al pastor. Unfortunately I was a little too excited when ordering and couldn t finish all the food. However  my friends did not have any problems with helping me.   This is definitely a place when should visit when in Austin. I know I will be making Patrick take me again next time I m in town 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,420,I m a big fan of their breakfast tacos. They re a good price  come with their deliciously hot salsa  and are just plain amazing.  They make them fast too  good for when you re in a hurry.   I also am a big fan of the tortas  amp  the ranchera fajitas. When they say the ranchera fajitas are HOT  they aren t kidding.   The only thing I m not the biggest fan of is the hours. When I tried the ranchera fajitas  it was   7am. It was really awesome that they served us a lunch dinner entree that early. But  I would love to have them again for dinner sometime  amp  the nights they are open never end up working out for me  but I guess that s a personal problem.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,421,I m so glad I was finally able to try this place  after having it in my Yelp bookmarks for what seemed like an eternity  probably more like 2 years . I could never seem to find the time to make it down to the 78704 during lunch time  but one sunny day the stars aligned and I hopped on over to Habanero for an early lunch  around 11 30 .  Since I was early  I was able to find a parking spot in their lot  but it looked like it had about 8 spaces  so most of the time you re probably looking at street parking. The place was already fairly full by the time I got there  but the only other people waiting were a group of 4 or 5  and I was seated in less than 5 minutes.  I had a REALLY hard time picking something to eat because everything sounded amazing  but in the end I decided on the barbacoa plate. Oh my god  it was heavenly. So tender and moist  savory and flavorful  and a little bit greasy  but that was ok because sometimes grease is a sign of delicious meat  brisket  ribs  pork belly . The rice and beans were great  the corn tortillas were great  the chips were great  the salsa was SPICY. But it was one of those sneakily spicy salsas  where the heat doesn t hit you until about 10 seconds later  after you ve already eaten like 5 chips. So if you can t handle spicy food -- a  what are you doing at a Mexican restaurant  b  learn to love the burn -- you should probably skip the salsa.  A table near me got the fajita plate and it sizzled as they brought it out  so naturally I was a little bit jealous.  I only wish this place was a little bigger  as I was sitting at a corner table near a doorway  and servers kept having to crowd near me to allow other servers to pass. It didn t really bother me  it adds to the charm and authenticity of this place  cozy   family   but it was a tiny bit crowded so be warned if you have personal space issues.  Lastly  my server was awesome  she called me mami  and I don t know why  but that made me feel so welcome and like I was eating at her house or something.  I can t wait to come back and try about a million other things off of their menu 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,422,Habanero is a great little cafe.  Excellent food  esp. enchiladas and fajitas  with friendly service  and I used to go there at least a few times a month.  I have to say I m a little irritated with Habanero Cafe over a new credit card policy.  They now won t accept credit cards for transactions less than  10  excluding tip.  This is a problem because 1  I usually don t have cash  2  most meals there are less than  10  and 3  I didn t  learn about the policy until I went to pay.  Either accept credit cards or don t  but don t play these games without making it clear when walking in.  The card logos are displayed on the door.  And since I usually don t go to cash-only places  I won t be going to Habanero as frequently now.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,423,I am SERIOUSLY in love with Habanero.  No  the decor isn t stunning.  Yes  the service seems a little rushed in the cramped dining room.  But  holy smokes is the food consistently awesome.  Today - lunch special is enchiladas al gusto - as you like them.  Chicken  with green sauce  rice and beans for  6.  Now  there are plenty of ways to make the chicken filling.  Easiest is to stew  then shred the entire chicken.  Usually is watery  and devoid of flavor save the salt in the liquid.  Habanero s are all white meat  individually spice rubbed  then roasted.  Nice mild tomatillo sauce and shreds of queso Chihuaua.  Excellent retried beans with a hint of the requisite lard.  Rice - each grain separate  and perfectly cooked.  Nice shredded lettuce and fresh pico de gallo on the side  to be added as you wish.  If there is a better  6 plate lunch in Austin - prepared EVERY TIME with love and passion for the food that is evident here  please lead me to it.  N.b. - one small item.  For the profits in a  2 glass of iced tea  can you please have another artificial sweetener than S amp L   Yeech.   maybe they do  and you have to ask.  Will have to remember next trip. . Like I need a reason to go here 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,424,Eat here all the time with my grandparents.  Great coffee and the carnitas plate is my favorite. Everything is delicious and hot. Will continue to come here.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,425,I went here on Saturday with my boyfriend while I was in town for the weekend. The place isn t anything special to look at  nor is it very well air-conditioned  but it was relatively good for what it was. EXTREMELY inexpensive  good ... and as a side note  the beverage glasses are HUGE  This was my first time in Texas  and one of the most obvious things I noticed. Does anyone else notice that the glasses in Texan restaurants are gargantuan  Is it just me  I couldn t believe it. I couldn t even wrap one hand around it  ...teehehehehhe . I had to wrap both hands around it so it wouldn t slip out of my grasp  ehehehehehehe    I ordered veggie tacos with flour tortillas  rice  beans  and guacamole. The veggies included were mushrooms  bell peppers  and onions  and it was extremely salty  I added some of their salsa  which is goooooood   guacamole  rice  beans  AND lettuce to my tacos  and that cut down on the sharp saltiness  and then my tacos were pretty tasty.  My boyfriend got carnitas tacos and a lengua taco  both of which looked decent  I m a vegetarian  so I have no idea what I m talking about   and he seemed to like it enough to eat himself into a coma.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,426,Habanero is a great place for lunch  in fact  they re only open for lunch and breakfast Sunday through Thursday. They serve dinner on Friday and Sunday. The food is great  the fajitas  in my opinion are the best thing on the menu. Everything is reasonably priced. I suspect that  in an effort to maintain those low prices  they ve resorted to a cash only policy  where previously they had a credit card minimum.  Service is always swift. There s usually a line for lunch  and given their limited hours  they have every incentive to turn over tables as quickly as possible. Don t plan on having a leisurely lunch here. While the food is excellent  I can only give three stars due to their cash only policy and the rather brusque cashier. I can t tell you how many times I ve thought about going  only to remember the cash only policy  and changed my mind.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,427,Make sure you check with their odd hours before you make the drive out.   Awesome simple mexican food ie. tacos and fajitas. If you re looking for chorizo stuffed confetti enchiladas served on a sombrero plate  while throwing back a dozen mexican martinis  go elsewhere. This place will hit that tex-mex spot in your belly. Great salsa  nice selection of meats  and fresh ingredients.   Horchata is good but only available on the weekends. The owner is always here and is real friendly. Small dining area so expect a little wait during lunch rush.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,428,Horchata. That s all I can say. Here is the place where I deem horchata  1 in my book. Delicious cinnamon rice drink goodness.   One tip  You should really stop eating the chips and salsa before your meal. The salsa can get addicting  and I ate one too many chips before my entree. I had the barbacoa gordita  and it was like eating a mexican burger. The gordita was overstuffed with barbacoa  cheese  lettuce  and tomatoes. So filling  They had the usual rice and beans on the side. Next time  I will definitely get something smaller since I ll be digging in the chips and salsa.   But seriously...horchata. It s amazing.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,429,Best Mexican breakfast in Austin   My girlfriend  amp  I had heard from multiple sources just how good Habanero was and everyone was spot on.  We went at around 11 am on a Sunday and  while busy  we were able to be seated right away.  We started with a fajita beef gordita  which was perfectly crunch and had an ample amount of fajita meat.  I decided on the Huevos Gringos  two eggs over medium with a delcious spicy queso topping with a side of the same excellent beef fajitas.  My girlfriend  from Laredo  chose the chori-migas.  There was just the right amount of choriza mixed into the cheesy migas  some of the best she s ever had   Really the only downside was the meals were served with french fries  which seemed a bit odd for breakfast but were not bad by any means.  As others noted  the salsa is a must.  Perfectly seasoned and extremely fresh  it is worth the  3 if you are not their for lunch or dinner.  In a city with a ton of Tex-Mex  amp  Mexican food options  Habanero stands a notch above the rest 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,430,I came to this spot after finding it on yelp  and I must say yelp has yet to let me down...  The chips and salsa here are DELICIOUS  second in the world to Chuy s. Next up  the food  which was awesome. I had the fajitas ranchero. This was the special of the day  so at  5.95 it was one of the best deals on food I ve seen. I had the mixed  beef  amp  chicken  fajitas  and really enjoyed them both  although I would recommend the beef over the chicken. The highlight of the plate was the ranchero beans  which are the best beans I ve ever had in my life. The flavor from the beans was endless  and the jalepenos added just the right amount of spice to complement the rest of my meal.   This place is a gold mine  the value you get of food for the money is amazing. There s not too many spots like this here  so when you get a chance I highly recommend you visit this place 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,431,This place is SO good. You cannot beat their prices  I brought my mother and my brother to eat and the ticket was under  30 and everyone left full and happy. I got the Gorditas  the menu said it was a  Mexican Hamburger . When I got it  I was unsure how to eat it so I asked the very nice waitress how I should eat it. She laughed and told me to  definitely cut it   and then giggled. It was a great experience 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,432,It was SO good  The fresh guacamole was to die for  fajitas were fabulous  enchiladas were yummy - everything was great 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,433,Seriously  if you haven t eaten here yet  get on it. I take great pride in my opinions on Mexican food as I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley  and I do know my stuff. I love Austin  but finding seriously good Mexican food in this town can be a task with all the horrible imitation fake crap  ie. Guero s  Polvo s etc   so do yourself a favor and try Habanero  it s the real deal  and I haven t found anything in this town that truly matches up.  If it s not 100 degrees outside  or if you have a hankering for some soup  get the Caldo de Res here. I grew up going to eat over in border towns in Mexico  and this caldo seriously takes the cake. It s amazing  and it simmers all day waiting for you. The chicken fajitas  chips salsa  refried beans  migas and chile relleno are also fantastic.  It s ridiculously affordable and I have never once had a bad meal there  and the waitresses know us by name. Friendly  fast  cheap  delish and authentic  everything a good local Mexican joint should be. It will not disappoint  and if it looks busy  the wait is never very long and is totally worth it. Also  they only do dinner on Fridays and weekends  during the week make it a lunch spot.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,434,My guy and I stopped in for lunch today and will definitely be back.  To start  the lunch specials are the way to go  at least  for meat-eaters .  They rotate throughout the week with two options each today - Monday s are fajitas and also a hard taco plate.  My guy got a full plate of chicken fajitas plus a side of chips and salsa for  5.50.  What a steal   I ordered the grilled veggie taco plate  which  at  6.95  was pretty damn near tops in the bang-for-the-buck category.  Two BIG tacos filled with marinated veggies  mushrooms  zucchini  some other stuff...   plus rice  beans  pico de gallo  and a big old pile of guacamole.  Delish     The place definitely has a lunch-diner vibe  which I thought was great.  Also  the staff were all super friendly and the service was quick.  Incidentally  we got there around 12 30p.m. and snagged a table right away.  Within 15 minutes or so  however  the place was packed.   Would be worth a short wait  though.   A win 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,435,Quite simply my favorite restaurant in Austin.  I ve been buying Friday breakfast tacos here for my firm for years now  and the quality has never been anything but the best.  A great place if you like non-bland  spicy authentic Tex-Mex.  For lunch  the fajita meat is seasoned perfectly  the salsa is the best in town  particularly on days when you catch a hot one   and the prices are extremely reasonable.  And if you don t try the chicken fajita ranchera tacos  you re missing out.  I love it also because it is locally owned  and very often Arturo  the owner  is working in the restaurant most days.  The staff is fantastic  even when the place is crazy with lunch traffic.  And it doesn t hurt that they ve learned my name and everyone in the place says hello when I walk in.  I simply love this place.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,436,Visited Austin for 3 days and wanted to try the  best  Tex-Mex.  After reading Yelp reviews  decided on this place -- GOOD CALL. We both had fajitas  1 chicken  1 beef.   Both were excellent and each had their own distinct flavor.   Sides were great  we went for the 2 homemade tortillas  and perfectly spiced.   We talked about the meal for the next 4 hours  and returned again on our last day and ordered the same thing. Oh yeah -- best tortilla chips ever.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,437,I am very picky with Mexican food  but this place is hands down the best little Mexican hangout in Austin. The women who work there will remember you  your family  what you eat  etc. They make you feel like family   The food is always great    Try to beat the lunch rush  before noon  or after one. It tends to get busy during the peak lunch hour. Other than that  I have no criticism of this place. You ll always leave satisfied.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,438,This place is as good as they hyped it to be. The atmosphere and food are both authentic and reminds me of my Mexico trip years ago. The Roberto s special hits the spot. Can t explain it but you just have to go there and try it for yourself.   BTW  I loved their salsa.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,439,I am a picky eater But for my Birthday I decided to step out of my routine and go somewhere new I had always eyed this little place on the corner and after reading the reviews  i decided this was the place to go to for my birthday.  Its just a little place...with BIG flavor.   I can always judge a place by its salsa.  It sets the mood for the entire meals. AMAZING.  Nice and spicy. The service was great.  Good teamwork...my glass of water never ran dry.   My husband cussed with every bite it was so good.  We hardly said a word and when we did it was just to say how amazing the food was I plan on going back many times
Habanero Mexican Cafe,440,Their seasoning for their meats and beans is top in town.  Get the fajitas ranchera and charro beans  you will keep coming back 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,441,Why are they not open for dinner anymore   I can never get there for lunch and used to go for dinner all the time. There was always a wait in the evenings.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,442,My wife and I eat here regularly and it s my benchmark for the true look feel and taste of Austin. I suggest going for breakfast  order their carnitas  with charro beans  and a piece of flan otherwise. I take iced tea pretty seriously and I count theirs among the best. I would not suggest this place to a vegetarian- menu is pretty limited for those folks. Standard tex mex items  enchilada  tacos  combo plates  etc  are fresh and very tasty if you are looking for that sort of thing. You pay your tab at the counter when finished so don t wait for a ticket. This place is family run and I have never had an issue with service. Don t expect to be hovered over.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,443,Can t say enough about this little gem. As if the  1 combo wasn t good enough. Try their Friday special  the Mole..  Seems like it impossible to get good Mole for a reasonable price but you can at Habanero  if only on Friday. Order some and you get an extremely tender leg quarter smothered in marvelous mole poblano  tasty Spanish rice and refried beans with a little lettuce and tomato. At the luncheon special price of 6.95 the quality and value cannot be beat.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,444,yeeeeeah they re pretty damn good tacos.   i tried my staple picadillo  beef and chicken fajita. they all meet and exceeded my expectations. i was pleased to find a taco joint that can fill my taco craving. i ve eaten at several taco places and have been pretty disappointed. i will return there often there s no doubt about that   their chips and queso are also delicious  chips were fresh and warm and it was a to-go order.   staff was really nice also    if ya love tex-mex and have had a hard time finding it un austin  try this place 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,445,It funny how some people can love a place and others don t like it at all.  I ve had lunch here three or four times and haven t really been impressed.  However   I kept going back because of the positive reviews but no joy.  My last attempt was a plate of cold carne guisada. I prefer Curra s or La Concina de Consuelo.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,446,OMG  the food was delicious and the salsa is on my top 3 list   The other reviews on here drew me to Habanero s but the food  especially the salsa  will keep me coming back.    I had the fajita rancheras on this last visit and it was very good.  The corn tortillas are perfect for the fajitas.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,447,The best  most authentic Mexican spot I have found in town.  My native Austinite friend recommended this spot and I m so glad he did   The fajitas  burritos and salsas are spot on and delicious.  True Mexican flavor and very friendly service.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,448,Nice little spot for Mexican food in the 78704. Definitely a fan. It s not the biggest place... only a few tables  but I ve always been seated within 15 minutes  even during the lunch rush.  The menu is pretty basic. No frills  but plenty of options to choose from. I generally just order a few tacos. Their salsa is fresh and amazing. The ladies on the wait staff are always friendly and helpful. Food is delicious  albeit plain. Always tastes and appears fresh.  Be aware that they don t accept credit cards for transactions under  10. I m a cheapskate  so I usually only spend  6-7. Be prepared with cash if you don t plan on ordering much.  I keep coming back. This is a great go-to for me when I need some authentic tacos.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,449,SO SPICY. Migas were just so-so. Had some of my husband s beef fajita tacos  and they were good. Chicken fajitas were also pretty good. Beans and rice were not very good. Probably won t go back.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,450,This weekend was my first time in Texas and I just knew I had to try some real Tex-Mex  and boy am I glad I chose Habanero. Service was fast and polite  we were seated promptly and I love that we got to just pay at the cashier instead of waiting for the check then waiting for the card to get picked up then waiting for the receipt.   Now  about the food. I have a confession to make  I m usually extremely skeptical about Mexican restaurants as a whole because while the flavors are often great  most places seem to fall flat in terms of.. well everything else. Too often  I find myself eating something that seems to be just heavy  greasy  and mushy. Well not here. But let s just run down the food enjoyed here   1  Chips  amp  Salsa  You get 1 bowl of chips and unlimited salsa. The chips are phenomenal. While cold  I hazard a guess that they are made fresh because of the light  crispy  and airy texture of the chips which I have never encountered before  and I suspect is impossible to maintain over time. The salsa  oh the salsa. I love salsa  and I love making salsa. Rarely  if ever  have I tasted salsa so incredibly well balanced with heat and freshness. It was the perfect consistency and the perfect blend of flavors. Incredibly flavorful and just a treat.   2  Nachos Habanero  Oh my. I think my boyfriend and I fell absolutely in love with this. Both of us agreed that it was the highlight of our visit and that it was the best nachos we ve ever had. I m not sure how they did it  but 80  of the chips maintained their crispy nature. There was not too much cheese  and just enough beans meat.   3  Crispy Lengua Lunch Tacos  Absolutely sublime. The meat was gently seasoned  and my first reaction was  hm  this seems a bit bland  But it becomes clear pretty soon that the under seasoning is to allow the subtle flavors of the incredibly tender lengua to come through. I ate 2 of these holding the taco together on one hand  head tilted and a spoon full of salsa in the other to pour on top. Highly recommended.  4  Horchata  It was decent. Slightly too sweet for me  but I enjoyed it. I only drank 1 3 of it because it was huge and I didn t want to drink empty calories when I had so much else to eat.   5  Beef Fajita Ranchera  This was my boyfriend s entree  but I did try it. My boyfriend said he felt underwhelmed by it after the nachos  and to be fair  I think the nachos really blew us away. However  I tried it to see what he was saying  and I will say that the meat wasn t as tender as I d expect  but it was boldly seasoned and spiced. I did expect more heat given the  HOT  sign after it  but the flavors were there and good. Overall  however  I felt the tortilla  beans  and guacamole with a bit of meat did fall into the trap of HEAVY  GREASY  MUSHY that seems so easy to trip into  which is unfortunate.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,451,I really love this place.  I could probably drink the salsa it s so good.  The only drawback is the small cramped dining room.  Last night I came in with my girlfriend and I could barely whisper a dirty word to her without the next two tables hearing.    I ordered the Mole which wasn t on the menu that day  but they made it for me anyway.  It fucking rocked my socks off.  All of the food I ve ordered here has been good.  My gf had the enchiladas which were definitely above average as far as enchiladas go.  The service was awesome with our waitress always appearing exactly when needed.  The icing on the cake is that dinner for two  plus tip  was all less than  20.   They have a  10 card minimum fyi   I will be returning soon and if you haven t yet  go try this place 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,452,This is the very best Mexican food you will ever eat.  But we don t need any more people here.  Don t go.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,453,SALSA      makes the top 10 in town  but not tops.   classic style.   nothing special about it and not spicy enough for me.   but definitely could sit there and eat my full of it.  FOOD      breakfast tacos are pretty good.   normal size and taste.   too much egg  screws you on other ingredients and doesn t really let you taste them. fajitas are different - big chunks and mesquite grilled.   very yummy. other unique weird items such as gorditas and tortas were great.   rice was good.  DRINKS    beer only.   and even then they don t offer a michelada.     VIBE    Kinda cute i guess  but mainly cramped small space  with no patio  and nothing too unique.   long waits.  SERVICE       very attentive and friendly staff  with suggestions at the ready.   hard to be forgotten about in such a small space..
Habanero Mexican Cafe,454,I went here because of it s  hole in the wall  look and four star yelp rating. I m always keeping an eye out for cheap er  Mexican food in Austin. This place  while cheap  is what I ll call quasi-Mexican. French fries as a breakfast side  That about says it all. I ordered the migas with chorizo. They were good enough  if not dazzling. Maybe more chorizo would have given them some sort of flavor  or maybe salsa  but none was on the table and none was offered. I tried my friend s salsa and  to quote my mom   I could sweeten my coffee with.  This place is not the place for you if you know about authentic Mexican food.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,455,The food here is great  especially the enchiladas. Unfortunately the owner is some kind of  Soup Nazi  and can be rude as hell. Doesn t seem to appreciate his customers. I have been visiting  his restaurant for years but today I have decided he doesn t need my money anymore. There are plenty of other local venues that treat you much better. Mariana s and Matt s El Rancho.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,456,Great portions  good food  decent price.  What more can you ask for   The free chips and salsa were so good that we filled ourselves up before we even got our food.  I think that was our downfall and ordered accordingly.  We got a al pastor gordita and the steak ranchero plate.  It was definitely more than enough food for two  with all the free chips in our belly .  The al pastor was delicious and the steak was also good  but slightly overcooked.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,457,I love this place and still get homesick for the huevos rancheros. I say homesick but I just live in North Austin. Still  it s quite a drive these days  One I may have to make today on this dreary March morning. The atmosphere is very cozy and homey and it feels family run because it is  Food is just right.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,458,Only thing that sucks is the wait  but once you get a table the food is amazing. The Carnitas and Barbacoa plate are my favorite and enough for two. The salsa is authentic and the perfect level of heat.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,459,I love the Wednesday fajita special - really good Tex-Mex.  While the wait  at lunch  can be long  I never get tired of going there  esp. on Wed. 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,460,Excellent place. Truly a bit of a dive  but don t let the place fool you. I had the chicken fajitas  the wife had enchiladas. Best I have had in Austin. Don t miss this place.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,461,Best AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant   They never disappoint. They have great customer service and great food.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,462,This place really has some serious chips  amp  salsa and carne asada   In addition to these two offerings  we also tried various gorditas  their specialty  with various meat style  carnitas  fajitas  etc.  during lunch time.  The chips are soooo crispy and the salsa sure had quite bit of kick that made all of us keep digging.  The gorditas are pretty good  but I don t find them to be spectacular.  The carne asada was served on hot plate with a bed or sweet onion and habanero.  This was definitely the climax of our meal.  The meat was sliced so thin  properly seasoned  and grilled to perfection.  It was the best carne asada that I have ever had... yum 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,463,1 word -- CARNITAS       OK I guess I should write more than that or I will get the dreaded Yelp filter...   This place is a hidden gem on Oltorf. I decided to try it out as part of my weekly trips to try a new place. I walked in with my lady friend and I think every employee said hello to us between the front door and our table.   And I think if everything else had been terrible I would have given them 2 stars for hospitality alone  luckily the food was above and beyond. Starting with the chips and salsa  chips were good thick chips -- standard issue for a good Mexican restaurant. Salsa wasn t spicy enough for my taste but it had good flavor  girlfriend liked it so I guess if you don t like a spicy salsa but you want a hearty flavor it is right down your alley  personally I would have preferred to keep the flavor and kick the heat up a notch  especially for a place called Habanero .   Then came our entrees -- Carnitas tacos and a Taco Salad. The carnitas ranked near the best I have ever had. It was tender like roast and it just fell apart in your mouth. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FLAVOR. The taco salad achieved something I had never had before I ran out of topping and filling before I ran out of meat. This was a hearty taco salad in a nice crispy shell  but I was completely floored that I ate it and still had some beef in the bottom of the shell.   Nice Mexican beer selection and a few domestics for variety  and a really good iced tea.   I will definitely go back again  because I have to try their gorditas and tortas. Then they will get a true test... the BKC al Pastor Test and that s a hard one to pass but I have a feeling Habanero can hold up.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,464,It s really just fine. I think I was expecting a little more out of this highly rated place  but I just wasn t blown away.   I had the enchiladas verdes with beef--which apparently meant ground beef  a fact I wish I had known before ordering it. The tomatil  sauce was good  if a little salty. The staples like the beans  rice  and salsa were all remarkably good. And the house-made horchata  only on Sat and Sun  was ENORMOUS and delightfully refreshing.   Neither the chips nor the tortillas were made in-house  which was disappointing.   Friendly service. Definitely stop in if you re in the mood for Mexican and you re in the area  but I wouldn t make a special trip OR brave it during the busy lunch hour. We were there at 3 00 on a Saturday and we were seated quickly though the place was packed.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,465,The wait was about 15 minutes since they were so busy but it was worth it  The food was delicious and the service was great despite it being busy. I wish parking was better but we found a random spot anyway and parked there. I ordered the enchiladas plate and I was really satisfied with it. My fiance ordered 4 street style tacos and he loved them  It was so good I even ordered 2 tortas to go so I can have my brother try them since we do not live in Austin and was just visiting. Everyone should go here and try it out    
Habanero Mexican Cafe,466,This place was delicious - I had the chicken fajitas and I tried the steak and they were both great  The chicken was tender  beans had the right level of firmness  and had bacon  yesssss    the rice was prepared properly  the tortillas tasted fresh  and dangit those chips and salsa darn near filled me up how good they were   .  -1 star because the service just wasn t that great  we had a table of 8 people and they brought two baskets of chips and two small bowls of salsa  which were consumed quickly and then we had to wait FOREVER to get more . In addition  the location is not convenient for tourists  it s impossible to get a frickin  cab.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,467,I ve been coming here for over 10 years now and this is still my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin. Everything is great here 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,468,There are so many Mexican food restaurants in Austin that it s hard to stand out. Some have fusion dishes  modern fancy atmosphere  are super traditional  taco-truck laid-back  focus on interior food  great cock-tails or any other kind of character to stand out.  Habenero just stands out because of the higher quality food and service.  As a life-long Texan  and Mexican food enthusiast  I can say this is my all-time favorite for straight-forward Mexican food.   Habenero s chips and salsa clue you in to the fantastic ingredients and care put into each dish.  Their fajita chicken is my pick. Such great flavor combined with their corn tortillas and a side of rice and beans  charo  refried  black beans with queso blanco . The seemingly standard fare is simply good and matched perfectly with the other flavors.   The service is just as quality. Maybe it s the effect of their limited hours  open only til 3pm on weekdays  but they always have the same pleasant  quick and attentive servers that you can only get at a family owned restaurant.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,469,This is an awesome spot for great Mexican Food in Austin. The enchiladas were awesome as well as the rice and beans. The queso and guacamole were perfect  and the service was extremely fast and friendly  The only downfall to this spot is its size and the lack of parking. You can usually expect a small wait anytime you visit.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,470,Great service and wonderful food the spicy chicken and beef fajita was some of the best I have ever had
Habanero Mexican Cafe,471,Good but not great Mexican food. The salsa was nice and spicy and the coffee is good. The place is really small and tables craed together but the staff was friendly and attentive.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,472,I ve eaten here many times  and decided to finally leave them a review.  Great place to eat at  and the salsa is among my favorite here in Austin.  I really like how affordable their meals are  and the quality of the food for the price you pay.  I ve never gotten a dish here that I wasn t pleased with.  I m rating them 4 stars instead of 5 because they have a minimum  10 for all credit cards -- makes it really inconvenient to pay when you are dining out for lunch with coworkers.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,473,I am a HUGE fan of tex-mex fare. And I was not disappointed by Habaneros.   I m reviewing this based upon my order of Fajitas Rancheras. I ll start with the Cons.  Cons  Small  cramped dining area. I only got two tortillas with my fajitas. Sure  I could have asked for more  but a minimum of three should be brought with a normal sized fajita meal.   Pros  I make salsa myself from fresh ingredients and I played around with the recipe for three years before I settled on my recipe. It s a big hit with the family and friends. This place makes salsa which is almost indistinguishable from mine. It s got the perfect balance of ingredients.   The Fajitas Rancheras were very savory and spicy. The guacamole that came with it was nothing special. The rice was rather bland. The Borracho  drunken  Beans  soupy pinto beans I saw one reviewer call them  were near perfect.  One star off for less than comfortable seating  and one more off for bland rice and guacamole and only two tortillas with my fajitas. The superb salsa and delicious Fajitas Rancheras kept it at three.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,474,What can I say  I been here 5 times  and simply the best Mexican food in Austin.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,475,This is a small cafe that isn t too impressive to look at but the food is delicious. Salsa - amazing. I get the veggie taco plate and I don t think I ll bother to order anything else because it s too good haha. My boyfriend has had the steak fajitas and enchiladas. He loved both of them.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,476,I really really really wish I could give Habanero 5 stars but I just can t for one reason. Why are they not open during the week for dinner   And why not stay open until at least 10pm on weekends   This is hands down our favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin. We absolutely love the veggie enchiladas and you can t go wrong with Mexican coke. They are now cash only but that won t stop us  My boyfriend works until almost 9 on Fridays and I would love if they would just stay open a little later. We used to go here almost every weekend but it s getting hard with them only being open at night on the weekends. Anyways  the chips are amazing along with the salsa and you can t pass up the queso because it s also to die for and super cheap. Best Mexican food we ve ever had and the prices are unbeatable. The service has always been nothing but awesome as well. We love you Habanero Mexican Cafe 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,477,Went here for Sunday lunch  around 1 30pm   it was jam packed. We had a wait of about 20-25 minutes and ended up at a small table in the back  there aren t many tables in the entire restaurant  but the wait is worth it    I ordered the Chicken Fajita Rancheras taco plate and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Fajitas plate.  The salsa was delicious  although they make you pay for an extra order of chips and salsa.  My food was DELICIOUS. One of the best Mexican plates I have had in a long time  It was extra spicy  but the chicken was spiced and cooked perfectly. I ate every bite  The chicken fajitas were also extremely good.   If you re willing to wait around  I ve heard they re very busy most of the time  the food is definitely worth it 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,478,This place is fairly unremarkable except for one important thing-- they have truly awesome beef fajitas. That s pretty much it... but damn  Those are some smokin  beef fajitas   Salsa is also pretty solid and the prices are good too.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,479,Great food - but if you can t take the heat then I wouldn t recommend it   Spicy spicy spicy 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,480,What a fabulous meal . We had to wait 20 minutes but it was time well spent  Friendly staff and flavourful food  Excellent homemade salsa. Had the fish and shrimp tacos . Good thing we live in Canada because this place would be bad for the waistline  
Habanero Mexican Cafe,481,Authentic mexican food... very fast and friendly service 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,482,I highly suggest going on a Monday for the Chicken Fajita lunch special  For  5.99 you asolutely cannot beat the amount of delicious  fresh food they give you. I was very impressed at the portion sizes and how everything was made to order  and absolutely seasoned to perfection  The only reasoning behind my 4  rather than 5  stars  the waitress made a bigger than necessary deal about my friend brining her outside starbucks with her  despite the fact we were paying customers. In addition  they have a credit card minimum which caused a huge inconvenience for my friend and I. I will be returning for the food.... maybe a takeout order.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,483,This place is awesome  The veggie enchiladas were amazing  the salsa was the perfect temperature and the queso was cheesy haha  The only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 from me is because there is a ten dollar minimum on all debit or credit cards. Luckily I choose a 7 dollar meal and ordered a 2 dollar queso so with tax my total came out to be around  10.31. But I would have been a bit upset if I had gotten to the register and had to pay an extra few dollars because of this limitation. I can understand maybe a 3 or 5 dollar minimum on cards as some resturants do  but 10 is a little stiff to me. Everyone has a debit card now days  so if I had just wanted a small queso or a drink  I was with a group of friends  that would have been a pricy Dr. Pepper.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,484,Very good place. Chicken fajitas were delicious  and flan is the best I ever had. Besides  they have a great Mexican beer selection. I would definitely recommend this place 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,485,It was kind of weird to be talked to as soon as you walk in in Spanish but it would have been even more awkward if I didn t know Spanish. Food was nothing spectacular  beans and rice were great while the enchiladas weren t exceptional and the tacos were kinda bland. Everyone raves about the salsa but it s basically liquified pico de gallo.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,486,5 Star  Best salsa in town.  I have tried several items on the menu  all are excellent  enchiladas  Clado  Fajita   amp  various tacos   I keep going back for the Chicken Fajita Ranchera tacos....
Habanero Mexican Cafe,487,I went to lunch at Habanero today with my boyfriend and I don t know how we ve driven by it so many times and never found our way inside until now. I ve seen it many times and I have always admired their sign  but it wasn t until we decided to go somewhere new for lunch and Yelp pointed us here that we gave it a try.  It isn t a very big place and the waiting area is pretty tiny  but fortunately we got there right as the lunch rush was ending and didn t have to wait too long- maybe 10 minutes. I would guess that if we had gotten there much earlier  it might have been a little longer of a wait  as they looked like they had been pretty crowded. We were seated at a large table for just the two of us  which was nice  and immediately served chips and salsa. The salsa was delicious  Great flavor  a little bit of a kick.  We read that the fajitas are fantastic  so we originally planned to order those. Upon seeing what the lunch special for today was  I changed my mind and went for the old standby- chicken enchiladas verde. The enchiladas were pretty yummy  but I have to admit- they weren t the best I ve had in Austin and I don t think they re Habaneros specialty. The green sauce was delicious  but the chicken was a little too dry and pretty chunky for enchiladas.  I really wanted to love my meal  but fortunately the 4 stars are for my boyfriends entree. He made the right choice and ordered what seem to be their two best offerings- the chicken fajita ranchero tacos on a flour tortilla and their beef fajita gordita. The fellow next to us had the  Mexican hamburger   which the menu said was their specialty and this gordita sure didn t disappoint. My boyfriend ate it all up with quite a few  yum s in between bites. We both really enjoyed their beans  both charro and refried   I m anxious to go back so I can get the fajitas  too 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,488,My favorite casual Mexican joint in Austin. A lot of great menu options and real value too. While there s a lot to recommend on the menu  be sure to try the beef fajita  ranchera if you like a bit of check   Wednesday they ve got the fajita ranchera as a lunch special with rice and beans and three tortillas for  6 and you re not going to find better quality at that price anywhere else in town. You can also get the fajita ranchera as a taco option if your appetite s a little smaller or you wallet s a little lighter. They ve also got a great gordita here that is big on fillings and big on flavor. Once you ve had your fill of the fajita ranchera try the barbacoa.  Open early at 7am for breakfast too.   There are notices that they ll be switching to cash only soon  so be prepared.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,489,The wait for this place was about 30 minutes for a table for two. It was packed but I don t understand why. It took forever to get our food and when we finally did get it she got my order wrong. The food wasn t that great but I did like their salsa  fries  and lemonade 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,490,This place really deserves it they have nice waitress they organize this food and decoration they have uniforms they attend you fast they deserve it they are my favorite and the best restaurant
Habanero Mexican Cafe,491,My son visited over Christmas and wanted to go to a  true  Tex-Mex restaurant. Went to Yelp to look for a solution and found Habanero. Loved it  Very friendly servers and very friendly owner. Chips  while not made there  are soooo good  light and thin. Salsa has a good bite to it. Habanero Burrito was delicious and the fajitas were a definite hit. Servers checked several times to make sure we were happy and our water glasses were kept filled. Most important for me  I left full. Will be going back .
Habanero Mexican Cafe,492,Try the catfish  for just 8 bucks  it s a mega deal. The waitess are super nice  watch out for the hot sauce for the chips  i can be really spicy. Flan is supremo 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,493,Quaint  Mami and Papi style place. Gorditas are their specialty. So that s what I had - beef fajita version. The fajita meat was a bit on the cold side  and a bit on the gristle-y tough side  It was okay. In a sea of Mexican food places  I didn t see anything that made this place really stand out. Other people might have thought so  however  because as we were leaving  the line to get in was practically out the door    One word of advice though - even though they advertise online and on the outside of the door that they accept credit cards - their policy requires a  10 minimum. We were each trying to pay for our inexpensive   well under  10  lunches with a credit card. After a bit of fussing on both sides  we got it worked out.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,494,Absolutely best. Food  atmosphere  service. Such a positive experience every time. A restaurant in an adorable little house with fantastic  sweet ladies serving you the most delicious  easy-on-the-wallet Mexican food in Austin.   I LOVE HABANERO.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,495,If you haven t eaten here  you are missing out   Everything there is AMAZING.  It is a hole in the wall  small restaurant  but the food is great.  It is about as authentic as it gets for Mexican food.  The matza on the gorditas are awesome 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,496,Excellent Chile Relleno  Fresh and spicy with a very tasty and unique egg batter. The salsa was right on... hot enough for my very high standards but flavorful enough to entice the even the most spice - phobic diners.  Great friendly staff was attentive and seemed to enjoy their work  -   Highly recommended 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,497,By far  the BEST Mexican food you can get in Austin  TX. Love this little family owned authentic Mexican food restaurant. The food is super tasty. If you re into spicy  flavorful food  then you need look no further. The salsa and chips  free with lunch dinner  are super tasty and the salsa has quite a kick to it... just the way I like it  The prices are very low and the quantity of food  very large. I ve been frequenting Habaneros for almost 6 years now and my only complaint is that sometimes there s a bit of a wait  especially right around noon . The wait staff are top notch  they incessantly refill drinks and salsa and rarely if ever get an order wrong. They always have big smiles and genuinely enjoy getting to know their customers. The cooks in the back obviously know what they are doing as well. The food comes out fast  is amazingly flavorful and will leave you satisfied and stuffed  The ownership  Arturo and Nikki  are very nice people and always ask how the food was  even after  6 years of dining with them . You simply can t go wrong by stopping in at Habaneros.
Habanero Mexican Cafe,498,Love this place  My first time experience was so wonderful I brought some friends from work  Large portions and delicious fajitas  Both chicken and beef. The wait staff is very attentive  friendly and patient.  We took a little long to order due to the extensive menu . My coworker had the horchata and it was so tasty    I hate horchata and I would of loved a glass of my own. Will be coming back soon 
Habanero Mexican Cafe,499,Barbacoa and lengua tacos are on point  The chips and salsa are so addicting  I usually get full by the time food gets to me. The mole is also delicious and a special on Fridays. Staff is nice   
Habanero Mexican Cafe,500,I have been going to Habanero since I was a kid growing up in Austin   now that I live over a hundred miles away I make sure anytime I m in town to visit Habanero  my favorite is the fajitas ranchero   I have never found fajitas even close to that good anywhere  I highly recommend   Keep up the good work.
Torchy's Tacos,1,Austin s foodie claim Locals boast about tacos Torchy pilgrimage  Nola_Haiku    Foodie  Austin  HookEmHorns    Tacos  Haiku  TorchyTacos
Torchy's Tacos,2,Torchy s lived up to the hype.  As a Southern California tourist and infamous TexMex hater  I was extremely skeptical about Torchy s and expected it to be subpar.  But ya know what  maybe Texas knows a thing or two about a thing or two because Torchy s was really good.  Thanks Torchy s. Thanks Texas.
Torchy's Tacos,3,This is the only place you need to go for tacos. On our visit to Austin we tried velvet taco  veracruz and Torchys before easily deciding that Torchys is  1 in terms of making an authentic taco.  Some of the other contenders tend to overcomplicate it by adding unique ingredients that don t necessarily belong in a tortilla  hrm.. looking you at velvet taco .  Highly recommend the democrat. Tacos are big for the price so definitely worth it. Thinking of squeezing in a second visit before I leave.
Torchy's Tacos,4,Torchy s tacos was a perfect no trills restaurant.  No sure if it is a fast food restaurant with a bar or not. Never the less  ended up at the bar. Very much a college place. The bartender was a college senior at UT. Very helpful and attentive. With her help  I  ordered the  Trailer Park and Beef fajitas tacos . Ordered a side of rice and beans. Had to 2  20oz microbrews. All were perfect.  Had to remind about my side dish. But came on time. Next time  I would do 2 Trailer Park tacos. Better favor and  tasted good. Everything looked good  I recommend this place. Not sure  if I will go again.  Only because this was a happen to be there. However  a sure much check out .
Torchy's Tacos,5,Tried Salsa Limon and drinks and service were terrible. Left full drinks after paying. Definitely overpriced. Walked down to Torchy s and got good drinks  great service a delicious queso for the same price.  Don t think about going anywhere else  highly recommend 
Torchy's Tacos,6,One thing about me is I love Torchy s.   I ordered the Fried Avocado taco  with a flour tortilla  and Guacamole  amp  Chips. I absolutely love the Fried Avocado taco  I thought it was a great vegetarian option and was super delicious. Despite being fried  the taco itself wasn t very heavy and I could have easily ordered another one. The Guacamole  amp  Chips were also really great  The guacamole could have used more lime  but had a nice kick and the chips were perfectly salted.   Since it was Sunday  I ordered the Sangria under the Weekend Cures menu. It was a little sweet for me but overall pretty good  especially for the price  Service was very fast and I would definitely come back here again.
Torchy's Tacos,7,Torchy s is definitely a staple.  It is walkable from the UT campus  and has both indoor and outdoor seating.   My favorite things to order  Fried avocado taco Trailer park taco - Hint  ask for it  trashy  aka with queso  but keep the lettuce .   Only big complaint is it often takes a while before your food comes out - whether you are dining-in or doing take-out.   Overall great spot 
Torchy's Tacos,8,Always a great choice for tacos. Lots of variety. The queso is my favorite   Excited to see the Tipsy Chick back on the menu.
Torchy's Tacos,9,Really good beef brisket tacos. Love the chips and salsa. Hubby has the fried chicken tacos which was just ok to me the beef has a lot more flavor. Also love the corn tortillas you can tell they are home made
Torchy's Tacos,10,I mean  who come s to Texas and doesn t stop at Torchies  This is ALWAYS good. I ordered the usual on corn tortillas and tried the new beyond meat taco which packed a lot of flavor. My favorite is always the queso and I can t wait to come back 
Torchy's Tacos,11,First time customer. We waited 50 mins for my to-go food and when I drove the 5 minutes to get home to eat it  all of our food was either cold or luke warm. It was obviously left sitting in their kitchen instead of at the Togo counter  but the staff choose not to recognize this and gave us cold food anyway. The tacos and burritos were soggy at this point. We were also missing our rice. Not a good experience at all.
Torchy's Tacos,12,I like going to Torchy s  it is a very nice local restaurant  they usually serve quick and the food is very tasty. I almost always have a Democrat Taco and a Baja Shrimp Taco.
Torchy's Tacos,13,I ve been coming to Torchy s over the years at UT and in Rice Village. The tacos taste fine overall. My favourites are the brushfire and baja shrimp tacos. I think they re overpriced for the size  and the wait time to get your food on the weekend is sometimes 30-40 minutes  which is a pretty long time.
Torchy's Tacos,14,I love their fried avocado tacos  They don t feel too oily greasy while eating it which is great. But the tacos are pretty filling. I also am OBSESSED with their queso. I m usually not a fan of queso but torchys is the exception. Wait times aren t too long either which is a plus  
Torchy's Tacos,15,I just really love Torchy s taco and it has already become a tradition for me to get it every time I stopped by in Austin. I ordered the fried avocado taco with a flour tortilla and the spicy queso and chips. The avocado taco was super delicious and I devoured it all at once as usual and the queso dip  my gosh  it s like crack and I always come back to it whenever I think of a dip in general. So so good and I never will be disappointed with this place  Wonderful staff as well.
Torchy's Tacos,16,I m from out of town. We heard that torchys is a must try. We tried some tacos. I don t think you need to come here for them. BUT THE QUESO   It s weird  but the whole meal should revolve around their queso. It s so amazing. Now that I m back in california  I don t know where to get it. We got chips to eat with the queso. I would go that route  but just order your dipping food of choice and get queso.
Torchy's Tacos,17,Torchy s Campus is always fun and yummy   The green chili queso can t be beat  Parking is somewhat limited  but we always seem to find a spot. There are plenty of tables and a large bar area. Hoping the ceiling will get repaired soon   
Torchy's Tacos,18,Interesting place with interesting tacos. I had their monthly taco called Tokyo Drifter. It was excellent. I also had the trailer park  based on recommendation from woman in front of me  which was pretty good although I have never had a taco with fried chicken. I was stuffed for hours to come. One would have been enough as they are not wimpy tacos  My husband had 3  salmon  shrimp and beef  and wasn t hungry for dinner 6 hours later LOL.  Will be back next time in Texas. Friendly service.
Torchy's Tacos,19,Closed for remodeling  right  Sure looked like it  but no notice on the website or maps app and no one answering a phone. 8 5
Torchy's Tacos,20,Torchy s is an Austin classic because of their unique tacos and delicious queso.  They have a good variety of proteins and salsas. I have regularly had their Trailer Park  which comes with fried chicken. Solid taco.   The only thing that prevents me from being a regular is their pricing and the wait time.  I do appreciate that they have good outdoor seating and about a dozen parking spots.   I ll probably come back here in a couple months.
Torchy's Tacos,21,Tacos  chips and queso  and margaritas. Everything is good every-time I go. Be careful those drinks will sneak up in you in the best way
Torchy's Tacos,22,Torchy s is always a good time and bringing a couple breakfast tacos on the plane home is always the right move. You can even order online the night before and set a convenient pick up time for yourself. I really wish they d open some in CA  though it does sound like they re expanding into the midwest .
Torchy's Tacos,23,Tried the new beyond beef tacos yesterday without spicy peppers  they were absolutely delicious. The price is a little steep but they are well worth your try
Torchy's Tacos,24,We ended up at Torchy s on a Sunday when another restaurant we tried was only serving brunch and my boyfriend wanted tacos. He had been to Torchy s Tacos before and knew they would be good. We ordered the Green Chile Pork  Fried Avocado and my boyfriend was going back for The Democrat that he had on a previous visit. The service was quick and friendly and the tacos were great. Two is plenty  and all of the ingredients were fresh and perfectly seasoned. Hoping they expand to Arizona so I can go more often 
Torchy's Tacos,25,I got the trailer park  which is an all time classic. I got the chicken fajita taco as well  along with a margarita. The margarita was super strong  and worth the price  I was very pleased with this torchys s visit 
Torchy's Tacos,26,Uh  I love corn tortillas  but the ones they used here kinda really sucked. Idk if they were wheat or soemthing but they felt under cooked  prepared. Unfortunately my love or corn tortillas had me or ding 5 of the 6 tacos I got with those tortillas and I was greatly disappointed. I enjoyed the one flour tortilla  but it was one of the few times I had Tex mex so I made that fatal flaw.
Torchy's Tacos,27,Simple place with excellent breakfast tacos. I tried the Migas tacos which was superb. This is a great place for tasty tacos. Soft tortilla was served open face in plastic basket and salsa in small plastic container. I sat outdoors at the small picnic tables and heard the steady stream of traffic pass by as I chowed down.
Torchy's Tacos,28,I came here at 10PM  a good hour before closing. I ordered a strawberry frozen margarita  which was more of a slush texture than a good frozen thickness. While I drank this  I ordered two tacos. The bartender kept asking me if I wanted to order another drink to-go because she wanted to leave. I replied with  maybe after I eat . Which I think made her realize that I had ordered food 30 minutes before. She handed me my food in a to-go bag  I was planning on eating there  and the check for  32  before tipping. I took my unplanned to-go order and ate it on one of their outside tables  as I felt unwelcome inside. This expensive meal was definitely not worth it in my opinion  my food was cold  the drinks were mediocre  and I felt rushed out. Needless to say  I won t be back to this location.
Torchy's Tacos,29,You cannot go wrong with Torchy s Taco because it s just that DAMN GOOD  ha  . It s a fusion place that just works.   I normally get their Baja Shrimp  actually I always get their Baja Shrimp. It is ridiculously good and filling. It has just the write balance of flavor from the lime and the sauce. Literally  just thinking about it starts that craving all over again.   I always get a taco paired up with either a side of Queso or Salsa. IT IS SO DAMN GOOD. Literally the Queso is hands down one of the best that I have ever had. Even my mom  who normally isn t a big fan of anything cheese  LOVES the Queso and always asks me to buy her some.       Tip  If you can t finish the full size  you can always get the half size. And that s lowkey a better proportion to the amount of chips that they give you.  The service is pretty good too  I honestly have never had a complaint. The food is good  the people is good  this whole damn place is good.   And quality is pretty universal across all Torchy s. If you also anticipate it to be super busy  you can always call in ahead to order as well.
Torchy's Tacos,30,Used to be a go-to of mine  but this location has seen better days. It felt like the place doesn t care about it s food anymore. Tacos took ages to come out and the Baja shrimp was cold. The trailer park trashy  s queso had already hardened from sitting  and the chicken strip was lukewarm at best.  I also had the green chile pork which tasted off  and I believe gave me and my friend a stomach ache. At least the Crossroads was still the same as expected and as good as before. Brisket was moist  and the taco was well-made.
Torchy's Tacos,31,Love Torchy s but I waited 30 minutes after ordering for them to bring my chips and queso and the waitress wasn t even nice about it
Torchy's Tacos,32,When I was visiting Austin and asked friends for recommendations Torchy s was often brought up and I wondered if it was just some sort of local cult following type of restaurant where people are homers to their favorite regional foods.  I ordered the democrat taco   4.50  on corn  trailer park trashy   3.95  on flour  and baja shrimp   4.75  on corn. These tortillas are the ones that the cashier recommended for the tacos I ordered so I just followed them. For the trailer park taco  getting them  trashy  means replacing the lettuce with queso which I highly recommend you do.   Oh man I was just blown away by how good they were  Both the baja shrimp and the trailer park were so good with their respective sauces  and they were both very thinly and nicely fried. I couldn t get enough of the sauces. I thought the democrat was just okay but I really liked the other two.  I also heard their queso is really good but I didn t have enough space in my stomach to eat that as well. I guess it s not really a local cult following and it s actually delicious tacos. I need one of these closer to me 
Torchy's Tacos,33,lt is a tex mex modern play on tacos with an edgy grunge taste. I was craving tacos so Jon and I came here. I found the perfect taco  The ambiance of torchy s is super laid back and chill so you can come with your friends on a fun and informal dinner. I think it s a great place for a 3rd  date. The drinks for sodas are really cool and austin-y aswell  Food came out fast and servers were friendly  it s a more  eat on your own  style.  I got the Baja Shrimp taco. Jon got the Republican and Brushfire taco. My pictures don t do the tacos justice but they were AMAZING each so BALANCED in flavor and texture.  The price for the tacos were good aswell  Each was about  4.50 and getting one filled me up  wasn t on an empty stomach .  Baja Shrimp 10 10 I love the crunchiness of the fried shrimp but also the freshness of the pickled onions. The chipotle mayo was so creamy it balanced and flavored the whole thing  Also LOVE the CORN TORTILLA  It was so earthy and had a good texture  rough but soft.  Republican 8 10  Josausage was juicy and flavorful but Jon felt that the sausage overpowered the over components and it was a bit too cheesy. Lots of flavor but very one dimensional  Bushfire 8 10 SUPER spicy but perfect amount of spicy since it s customizable. The mangoes was a good juicy and fresh relief from the fire 
Torchy's Tacos,34,So glad this is an Austin original    Best tacos ever.  Anyone visiting our city will miss out if you don t visit a Torchy s location.  My favorite is the Tipsy Chick
Torchy's Tacos,35,My pork tacos were good this morning but the fillings were tiny.    Much much smaller than I remember.   Did y all sell recently       Ben   long time customer
Torchy's Tacos,36,Yes please. I could eat here every day and not get sick of their tacos. Every taco we tried was delicious. Came two days in a row for lunch  no regrets. We each had two tacos and that seemed like a good portion.  The Wrangler   3.75  - Eggs  seasoned potatoes  smoked brisket  and cheese. The first time I ordered this they messed up and gave me bacon. I actually liked the bacon one more than this one  But second breakfast favorite was this  the meat was great and the potatoes were really tasty. Try it with the diablo sauce  trust me. 5 5  Ranch Hand   3.75  - Eggs  grilled beef  and cheese. Good  missed the potatoes in this one and the grilled beef isn t as good as the brisket  to me . 4 5  Democrat   4.50  - Avocado  barbacoa  and cheese. Probably my least favorite as the barbacoa tasted a bit like lamb and I don t really like lamb. 3 5  Crossroads   4.50  - Smoked brisket  jalape os  avocado  and cheese. All about that brisket  this was another one of our favs. 5 5  You can buy the diablo sauce by the bottle  I think it was around  7  and we definitely did this.  I was also impressed at how they manage the seating. Even though it was packed the entire time we were there  seats opened up quickly and the staff bring you your food and take away your plates when you re done.
Torchy's Tacos,37,Torchy s Tacos is an Austin institution with some of the most creative tacos in this wildly popular town that serves as the capital of the Lone Star state as well as the home of the flagship campus of the University of Texas.   A quick Yelp search reveals no less than 15 brick  amp  mortar Torchy s scattered all over the Austin metropolitan area. They are consistently rated 4 to 4.5 stars recognizing the awesomeness of their creative taco menu.   I got to sample a couple of delicious Torchy s Tacos  one Beef  one chicken from a Torchy s food truck and never looked back.  Wow...I was a fan with the first bite.    Torchy s is a clear winner...5-star tacos full of Tex-Mex goodness 
Torchy's Tacos,38,The place wasn t terribly packed when I got there but as I was finishing my meal it filled up    This isn t your traditional sit-down restaurant. You order at the register  take a number and they bring your meal out to you when it s ready. Think CiCi s pizza  kind off  sort of  not really.  I was overwhelmed with choices which is never a bad thing. I told myself to pick a reasonable number of tacos. I also told myself  I could always make a trip back before the end of my vacation to try other tacos. I never made that second trip.  In hindsight  I wish I would have gotten 4 tacos instead. I also wish I would have come back for a second meal. When I travel I typically eat less because I don t like carrying around leftovers. It s a combination of that and the AirBNBs I stay in never have refrigerators in the room.  I feel weird going into other people s refrigerators.   What I ordered  Mr. Orange  Blackened salmon  grilled corn  black bean relish  cojita cheese  cilantro  lime wedge  avocado sauce on a corn tortilla   Brushfire  Jamaican jerk chicken  grilled jalapenos  mango  sour cream  cilantro with diablo sauce on a flour tortilla   Baja Shrimp   hand-battered  fried shrimp  cabbage slaw  pickled onions  jalapenos  cojita cheese  cilantro  lime wedge  chipotle sauce on any tortilla of choice.   Street corn  corn topped with ancho aioli  cojita cheese  cilantro  red chile powder and a lime wedge.  This tasted like corn straight out of the can. I like crunchy corn and all the corn I got was deflated  for lack of a better word. I enjoyed the Brushfire taco the most  I ate it last because it looked the safest   in case I didn t like the other tacos I wanted to make sure I ended with something satisfying. This also had a nice kick to it. It wasn t spicy to the point I couldn t enjoy it. I also automatically love anything with sour cream. The avocado sauce on Mr. Orange was very tasty. I m not usually a fan of avocado  things .  I m not a fan of fried shrimp but I decided to give it a second chance. The shrimp on the Baja taco tasted rubbery. I wish I would have asked if grilled shrimp was an option.  Overall  almost everything tasted fresh  I definitely prefer corn tacos  tastes more authentic. The portion sizes were hefty which I can always appreciate  I d pick this over Moe s or any other chain  Tex-Mex  restaurant. However  I d still pick authentic  street style  tacos over this any day. I wouldn t order the corn again. And I d get a fountain drink because who doesn t love free refills  I definitely recommend checking this place out if you re ever in Austin or Texas   Bonus  They also have breakfast tacos 
Torchy's Tacos,39,We all deal with things being different during the pandemic.  Fortunately with a little patience we can still get Torchy s   Whether it s on the menu or build your own it s easy to order ahead for pick up  and usually quick when eating in.  Best queso   awesome different choices of deliciousness.
Torchy's Tacos,40,Great breakfast tacos.  Good size  filling and great price.
Torchy's Tacos,41,The service was amazing. We went for our first time and the staff was sooooo helpful. TONS of vegan options not on the menu.
Torchy's Tacos,42,Love a good Torchy s Taco  so many options and delicious drinks. This location though has terrible parking and wait times are pretty long.
Torchy's Tacos,43,Our group was visiting Austin and decided to get a small breakfast here at Torchy s. We got there fairly early around 8 30am on a Saturday morning  so there was plenty of seating. There s a wide selection of tacos so you ll definitely find a combo you like.  I ve had Torchy s before the last time I came to Texas  but only got the classics - which were also solid    The Wrangler   3.75   Eggs  Potatoes  Smoked Beef Brisket but I held the cheese because I m lactose intolerant. Still tasted super good with the soft flour tortilla and well-flavored brisket. The egg was also well cooked  not too dry but not runny either. The tomatillo sauce was a great addition as well.  Trailer Park   3.95   Fried Chicken on a taco   Surprisingly although the piece of chicken seemed huge  it was edible in taco form. This was also super good with the balance of flavors of green chilies  pico de gallo  cheddar jack cheese and poblano sauce.   Would definitely come back to try more tacos  
Torchy's Tacos,44, 1 to hippy menu  1 to large portion size for the price  1 like that they have a different sauce on the side for each taco    1 like that they have a  taco of the month   Proceeds go towards a good cause -1 Everything tasted really cold when it was brought over... -1 Would have been nice if the tortilla was heated up...  While I was pretty tired of eating TexMex for almost every meal I had in Austin  but I had a pretty good experience at Torchy s. Would recommend folks to come here for some cheap eats   My group of 4 came here around 5 45 pm. We seated ourselves after ordering at the front.   We ordered a variety of things  1  Green chile queso   chips  yum  Liked the kick in it  and the queso was good. I hear the chorizo one is better...gonna try that next time  2  Trailer park taco  The cheese on top was a bit overwhelming  but the chicken was good  3  Baja shrimp taco  Yum  My favorite of the 3.  4  green chile pork  the pork was not too fatty  and not too lean. Liked the cotija cheese on top  and the sauce on the side was spicy  5  HH Margaritas  pretty good  I have nothing to compare this to  but appreciate we can get a big drink for only a couple bucks  Service  fast  Nothing much besides that  though. Pricing  a bit pricey by the looks of it  but when you see the food...pretty worth  Parking  seems complicated limited.  Overall  I enjoyed this spot but not to the point that I am dying to come back.  please don t yell at me 
Torchy's Tacos,45,They had me at chicken and waffle tacos.   We loved the creativity and everything we ordered tasted great.
Torchy's Tacos,46,So when you see a sign that says  damned good tacos  you must stop  right    The chicken fajita was good...big...just need one. The guacamole is hands down the best I have ever had...seriously. Michael  the bartender was awesome and suggested sites to see around Austin...he was the best.  Made a great recommendation on Pearl Snap IPA...awesome job  Michael.  If when I come back to Austin  I will come back.
Torchy's Tacos,47,Today is Feb 13  2021. As Edwin and Joy pointed out  there are some rude employees working up in this place. I ve eaten at several Torchy s restaurants in Houston and I ve never been disappointed. First  my pops went to the bar to ask about drinks - the guy brushed him off quickly by handing him a menu. Second  when our food was delivered  my husband asked for some Diablo sauce which never came. Funny because the place wasn t packed. Lastly and the worst  I find a hair in my taco. This place can kiss our buns.
Torchy's Tacos,48,I love torchys but I think they switched their corn tortillas. They seem to not be cooked all the way.
Torchy's Tacos,49,Great tacos great drinks Great service  I stopped in a few days ago and had a few drinks at the bar  the bartender   I believe her name was Anna  was super friendly and helpful  even as she was closing down she was helping customers and had a great attitude  My food came out quickly and I had no issues with my order  Everything tasted good  
Torchy's Tacos,50,I LOVE TORCHY S       SO MUCH      Every time I m back in Austin I make sure to visit a different location. They ve come a long way since their first food truck that s for sure. With that said  the quality and flavors haven t wavered at all.  Never have I had a bad meal here. Never.   During this visit we of course had the Torchy Queso and my taco of choice  the Democrat which is shredded barbacoa  cilantro  onions  cheese  lime and tomatillo sauce. Comes with avocado too and of course the tortilla is corn.  My boyfriend got the Trailer Park taco  fried chicken  pico  chiles  poblano sauce  lettuce and cheddar jack. This one is a flour tortilla.  Our other favorites include the Tipsy Chick and the Republican.  Everything on the menu is primo  There s nothing here I don t like.
Torchy's Tacos,51,I heard so many good things about this place before going and I was not disappointed   I did leave  however  breathing fire. Don t get me wrong  I love spicy  but the Diablo sauce is no joke. Like an idiot  I put that stuff ALL OVER my Brushfire taco and could hardly breath after one bite it was so hot. My Crossroads taco though was delicious  The meat was cooked to perfection and tasted so good with the tomatillo salsa on top.   My friend got the Baja shrimp taco and the trailer park  trashy  which just means to add queso and lose the lettuce. She said they were both good  but the shrimp seemed a little chewy.  Our queso  salsa and guacamole were all really yummy and the chips were perfect.   I will definitely be going back when I m in the area again but I ll be using the Diablo sauce sparingly.
Torchy's Tacos,52,Abbi is the best bartender ever  So fun to talk to and very helpful with the menu  She told me about the secret menu  from which I ordered a matador and a trailer park hillbilly style. Haha such silly names.. definitely will come back again soon and tip abbi lots of cash money 
Torchy's Tacos,53,Torchy s Tacos has my absolute favorite salsa on the planet the tomatillo one   I also love the Mr. Orange  because I love salmon  lime  and avocado.
Torchy's Tacos,54,Yum yum yum    This place has one of the best tacos in Austin. Their menu has a lot of options for both vegetarian and non vegetarian filing inside tacos. We tried a bunch of them including dirty sanchez  migas  independent  chicken fajita and green chili queso  amp  chips for the table with  mimosas on the side. Everything was super yummy especially the green chili queso. They also provide a couple of sauces to order which vary between different level of spiciness.  Oh and we also tried the cookie desert as well  Posting pictures of everything we had.
Torchy's Tacos,55,Everyone told me about Torchy s before I got to Austin  so I had to go try it out on my own.  The tacos...... AMAZING.  I had the fried avocado  amp  the independent tacos.  The avocado was slightly better just because the fried avocados were awesome   Both tacos seemed to complement one another as the fried avocado taco had cheddar cheese  pico de gallo  and pinto beans on a corn tortilla.  The independent had the mushrooms  black beans  veggies  cotija cheese  and ancho aioli on a flour tortilla.  If anything  I wish there were maybe two more vegetarian options  even though I could only finish 2 tacos during lunch.  That ll help when I make it back next time.  I also wish I could have tried some of the other dipping sauces too  but that ll have to wait.    For  8  you can t seem to go wrong price-wise for a dope lunch
Torchy's Tacos,56,Great flavors  very fresh  very quick.  Loved the friend chicken taco trashy style.
Torchy's Tacos,57,My favourite taco spot in town  Disappointed that they stopped the independent Taco post covid but now i have the fried avocado as my vegetarian choice. Best chips and Queso I ve tried so far too 
Torchy's Tacos,58,Torchy s tacos are all over Austin. Torchy s tacos has an extensive menu of their specialty tacos. They are all excellent On this trip I had a shrimp taco with a complicated name that I can t repeat it doesn t matter just say I want to shrimp taco and all the rest came along. The Verde taco with a Chile Verde and a bunch of other stuff was also most excellent. We had a variety of tacos and they were brought to our table pretty promptly for such a complex order and while we happy. The gal behind the counter was extremely nice and extremely helpful. Although tortillas taco doesn t have become pie we were looking for pecan pie and astro she knew and she didn t but she looked things up and came over to our table later in gave us a report on what she found. That was definitely above and beyond by this nice young lady studying to be a surgeon at the local University. Back to torchy s tacos. The place has a lot of seating wide open a big bar lots of beer and is real hotspot for people who want to have a group get together. All I can say is go to torchy s tacos anyone gettin lis getting line and getting taco. Even at the busy times it s worth the wait and yum yum yum. On 2nd thought get a couple of tacos unless your really hungry and you ll know what to do. Enjoy torchy s I do.
Torchy's Tacos,59,For Tex-Mex tacos  I think the tacos here aren t that great and there are better options in town. Tacos were okay  but can t say I d recommend.
Torchy's Tacos,60,While I absolutely love the food here  I m annoyed that I was informed that I could not eat at the restaurant as I was just ordering. I was told  rather rudely  that there weren t any tables available  which I completely understand . I asked if I could wait for a table - I was told  no  and that I could only order my food To Go. Apparently  it s OK to wait for my To Go order but not wait for a table   So as I sit here waiting for my order  2 tables have opened up and were given to other patrons who came in after me  Further  I am still waiting for my food while staring at 2 additional open tables and no one from here has even asked if I wanted either of those tables  That is horrible customer service as far as I m concerned. HORRIBLE  So disappointed 
Torchy's Tacos,61,Line took forever. Food was what you get at Torchy s every time. The waiter was rude  impatient  and had an attitude on him. My friends and I were in line and the server comes the opposite way and says excuse me. Of course  we move out the way fast. After he passed us  he goes  Jesus Chris get the f ck out of my way.  Totally rude and uncalled for. We were just standing in line. The restaurant was very busy so we put a chair at the end of a table. There was still plenty of space to walk through. The same server comes by and tells us in a rude tone that it s a fire hazard. We try to talk to him and he just storms off. The thing that bothered us was that many of the tables nearby were doing the same thing. We think we were being targeted by this man. This is horrible customer service and Torchy s should really reevaluate their employees. I attached a picture of a table nearby that was doing the exact thing. I will not forget this horrible experience.
Torchy's Tacos,62,FROZEN PEACH MARGARITA    Ugh amazing. I ve never had drinks at Torchy s until recently and I ll definitely return for more  I also tried their queso for the first time and it was really good  The Trailer Park was yet another first for me at Torchy s  are you sensing a theme yet   and I had it smothered in queso mmmmmm. Torchy s has so much to offer and I m sure I ll be trying even more new things the next time I stop by 
Torchy's Tacos,63,Don t waste your time making an online order here. I went up and they said it ll be a couple of minutes till it s ready and they ll bring it to me. Well I waited for 25 minutes and they never brought it to me so I went up again and it s been sitting there for 15 minutes.   My food was all cold and my order came out wrong. I was missing a taco and my other taco had green chiles when I specifically put I was highly allergic   Terrible service as well don t recommend at all  
Torchy's Tacos,64,My uncle recommended me to go here to try their tacos and it did not disappoint. Despite it being a chain  the quality of food and price was really on point. I got the fried avocado taco and the spicy jerk chicken taco. The fried avocado was covered in cheese and lettuce and has a very interesting taste. The jerk chicken was actually spicy. I was surprised it had such a kick..it was delicious   I wish I had more room to try other tacos but I was pretty full. As people say  everything is bigger in texas   they were right. Another place I would come back when I m in Austin.
Torchy's Tacos,65,Really good tacos  The cashier helped us decide on which tacos to get. We also tried the queso. Soo goof
Torchy's Tacos,66,I love tacos everywhere I love tacos in my neighborhood I love tacos from beyond  I love tacos so much I just can t take it anymore I love tacos from Torchy s too Haha   Pshhh Bam  Salsa yes please
Torchy's Tacos,67,Visiting Austin for the first time  I felt that it would be a sin not go to Torchy s while there. I came in hungry and ready to eat plenty of tacos. When looking at their menu  I was pleasantly surprised by the number of vegetarian options and ended up ordering the bean  amp  cheese  the independent  and the fried avocado as well as a passionfruit margarita. It ended up being waaay too much food but I still enjoyed every single bite and highly recommend the independent and fried avocado  My drink was absolutely delicious.
Torchy's Tacos,68,The hot older lady is always so kind and empathetic to all. She embodies Torchys to me.
Torchy's Tacos,69,The cheese dip is literally the BEST thing in the world  It is so cheesy and spicy  yet the best balance of flavors and not too heavy  Highly highly recommend the cheese dip  What lets it down are the chips  they can sometimes we a little oily and thin and that is the worst with such a great dip   I am also a fan of the fried avocado tacos  as it is one of the few vegetarian options  but it is pretty great. I do get a little overwhelmed by them  thinking they are avocado tacos  so I will be able to eat a ton but they can be a bit heavy    The cheese dip and the avocado tacos can be much but it is definitely an amazing treat from time to time    The service has also always been quick and easy for me and I really appreciate that in a restaurant.
Torchy's Tacos,70,Came here after overhearing some random ladies asking for directions to Torchys Tacos. We had never heard of Torchy s but I m so glad we did   This place has delicious tacos   We opted for the Trailer Park and the Green Chile Pork and they were both fabulous   Throw in some Green Chile queso and chips and you got a meal   I wish I could have eaten more because it would be great to be able to eat my way through the menu. I will add it to my bucket list 
Torchy's Tacos,71,Omg this place was a winner we stopped here because we heard good things and we were in Austin for the day. I had the beef fajita and the chicken fajita tacos and omgoodness they were great    If I m back this way I will be coming back for more 
Torchy's Tacos,72,These tacos were fantastic and have some great names  I had the crossroads  the republican and the trailer park  made trashy . The trashy part is adding some melted cheese on top  Yes please   I also got one of their margaritas with fresh lime juice and it was really tasty as well.   This is a very popular lunch spot and their are lots of tables and communal tables to sit at as well.
Torchy's Tacos,73,Ordered the Wrangler because smoked brisket just sounded good. Overall  the taco was just alright to me. I got to try a bit of the Trailer Park and that fried chicken was delicious. Next time I m back in Austin  I m definitely getting more than just one taco. There s so many different kinds that one visit isn t enough to really experience Torchy s Tacos.
Torchy's Tacos,74,Updated review  I had the same issue last time with our  6 questions and chips not arriving until after the entree.   When the food runner came out with our tacos I asked are chips and queso supposed to come out before the meal    He stated  yes  it is I m so sorry  I will be right back with that.    20 minutes goes by  we still haven t received the chips and queso. I went to the front cashier and asked to speak with the manager  waited up front for approximately 8 minutes. I then approached the man that I assumed to be the manager and asked--  are you the person I am waiting for     He said  yeah  I might be.  And walked away. He proceeded to take care of multiple to-go orders and help another table.   Another 6 minutes goes by and he approaches me and says   now how can I help you     I explained to him the situation and I was NOT being rude and I did not show I was frustrated. I also had the avocado I was served in my hand in which he agreed should not have been ran out with the food.  Picture attached of avocado    He looked at me and states  so what do you want another taco   SERIOUSLY     No what I wanted was my chips and queso and decent customer service. That s what I WANTED. After already eating and waiting around we finally got our chips and queso and his way of apologizing was throwing a  5 burn card on the table.   We absolutely love Torchy s but I will never go to this location again    
Torchy's Tacos,75,As a Michigan Wolverine  I m not used to the blazing heat of Austin or just how seriously good Texas  tacos are.  Torchy s seems like a popular establishment as it s pretty close to the UT-Austin campus and because it s parking lot is literally jammed full.  Their tacos were amazing     - Brushfire  By far the better of the two tacos I ordered. The mangos didn t do that much in balancing out the fire of the jalape os but they were a very welcome addition to the taco itself. I recommend the  green   mild  sauce with the taco  as the fire of the hot sauce and the jalape os can be overpowering.    - Migas  If you just imagine an omelet inside of a taco shell  that is exactly what this is. Nothing too crazy or fancy but a nice taco to have at a somewhat decent price  2.75.  Their service was a bit slow but also I came at a very busy time  so it was fine for the amount of people were there. I waited  12 min for my tacos.  I would give this place 5 stars except I think their tacos are ridiculously overpriced. The fact that two tacos could easily come out to  9 is crazy to me and I m from Michigan. Also their fountain drinks cost  3 so I guess I ll never taste what their special sodas are like.
Torchy's Tacos,76,It really is damn good.   I wanted to end my review at that but there s just so much to say about this place. First off  no matter what you re getting  you better also order the green chile queso and chips. They serve it pretty fast and it is everything you want a queso to be. The entire menu is fun and some of my personal favorites are the Fried Avocado  Dirty Sanchez and The Republican. However  my favorite menu item is the Trailer Park  extra trashy  meaning more queso . It s amazing how they re able to create the perfect sauce for each taco and I keep coming back for more.   The only complaint I have is that they seem to be adding too much salt to their food lately  especially to their chips.
Torchy's Tacos,77,Rudest service I ve gotten at an empty food place. Upon ordering my food  4 breakfast tacos   I asked if I could be called to my car since it was cold outside  didn t want to wait inside  covid   and they do take curbside orders. Woman at the cashier said she couldn t. When I asked for the lead time and why was it 15mins if I ve had food served much faster when there were customers inside  her answer was   Do you think nothing else is going on in there   . Needless to say  15 mins is a long time for fast food  there was NO curbside activity while I waited  Thursday at 10AM   their service is terrible  she s always rude to me but this time actually outdid it    and I will not be buying again from these people. My dogs like tacos and saliva  so they will likely enjoy Torchys craft today.  UPDATE  Upon picking up the food  I asked the woman  Pam  I find out  to point me to the manager. Alex  the manager on site hears me recounting my experience  doesn t say a word but nodes behind his mask and  after I m done speaking  just stares at my while continuing to node in silence. So evidently the manners are institutional.
Torchy's Tacos,78,I absoultly love torchys  Even though i always order the trashy trailer park id eat anything on their menu anytime  If your not in the mood for you traditional tacos this is your place  Ever wanted a chicken and waffle taco  How about a fried chicken strip taco  Torchys got them all 
Torchy's Tacos,79,I would move back to TX if it meant I could eat Torchy s every day. My friends up north have heard me raving about this place for years  and everyone I ve brought back w me to visit gets it.   It s totally just a fast casual Tex mec place  but i can t even express just how good this is. I think about their queso on the reg  nothing up north compares  It s delicious  well spiced  and full of additions like green Chile  avo  etc.   Their tacos all have fun and unique names  Democrat  republican  etc . I always get the Democrat  barbacoa and avo  and it s absolutely delicious. The portions are great and the drinks are fab as well. If cheese lasted  I would absolutely buy a carton and ship it to NYC 
Torchy's Tacos,80,Best tacos ever. Why isn t there one in CA  Loved the decor and the bar in the middle. Ordered 4 between the two of us. 1. Trailer park 2. Fried avocado 3. Tipsy chick and 4. Eggs and bacon. Listed from best to the one that was just ok. Pretty filling.  We were there at 11am on a Saturday and got a Bloody Mary.  3   What    What a deal   It was delish. Also ordered one of the peanut butter brownie bars in front of the cashier. Yum.
Torchy's Tacos,81,A little pricey for a taco. Not bad for chain tacos. Chips and the queso are the best thing on the menu and it s pretty dang good. Tortillas don t taste like fresh made ones but it is a chain restaurant. Would come back.
Torchy's Tacos,82,Great quick service  great food and drinks  moderately priced. Funky vibe. An Austin staple. Perfect spot to meet up with friends. They also have tshirts and other merch for sell. Hubby is the proud owner of two Torchy s shirts.
Torchy's Tacos,83,Some of the tacos were bigger than others but the price of each was pretty good indicator.  I had a whisky chick and a trailer trash and they were both delicious.  I might have been better off not eating as much of the chips and queso BUT boy was it tasty.  Delicious food.  We had a large group and everyone was pleased with what they ordered.  One thing they could have done that others did was to write names on the wrappers so we didn t have to figure out who belonged to what.  They did have the names of the food but not everyone remembered what they ordered.  It all worked out and we ll definitely be using these guys again for future orders.   mmmmmm so good 
Torchy's Tacos,84,Went in as I like this place but they all vary.  This one has no drinks  until the bartender felt like coming in .  Not super service.    the one onGuadalupe.
Torchy's Tacos,85,I FREAKING LOVE TORCHY S   This was one of my daily favorites for both breakfast  lunch  and dinner. They have the most balanced tacos  and there is never a lack of a the punch of flavor that we deserve.   The tacos themselves are all perfectly mixed with that salty  savory flavor  with a hint of creaminess from cheese  spice from the salsa  but then a acidic sweetness at the end. ALL of this wrapped up in a taco.   The  breakfast ones are seriously the hardiest breakfasts out there. They are cheap and plentiful. The eggs are fluffy  the meats are not too salty. They are truly a treat.  10 10 would recommend.
Torchy's Tacos,86,Amazing how fast their food quality has dropped. For years their Dirty Sanchez use to be one of the best tacos in the city... now it s not even on the menu. Their limited menu has kept me away but decided to try them again with a friend this morning. Got the Fried Avocado taco as a Sanchez replacement. Could not find the tiny avocado because it was covered up by iceberg lettuce  beans and grated cheddar. What    I guess that is what happens when you let Wall Street take over. Sorry Torchys... you lost me - it might work in New Jersey but Austinites know better.
Torchy's Tacos,87,Two words  breakfast tacos. Torchy s was recommended by two friends- and I went once for breakfast and once for brunch  trying two tacos each time. The highlights were the brisket and egg  and the fried chicken and queso. Both were pretty hearty and salty  but delicious and definitely filling. They have a huge variety so they are bound to have something that tickles your fancy.
Torchy's Tacos,88,Torchy s Tacos was one of the go to spots on our list while in Austin  it was better than we hoped for  I ordered a breakfast taco and one that had brisket in it- both were packed with delicious ingredients   We heard there were drink specials so we sat at the bar. 3.50 Bloody Mary s  mimosas and sangrias - that price is incredible. The bartender was very friendly  service was quick and it was all reasonably priced. We ll be going back to a Torchy s again.
Torchy's Tacos,89,How have I never had queso and guac  It s actually one of the most delicious things I ve ever had. Plus  Torchy s tacos makes the best queso. It was so good I almost didn t feel like eating my tacos.   Their tacos are huge. I thought I could eat three and ... I was wrong. I loved the fried avocado taco and the breakfast taco  I got bacon  egg  and cheese . The other one I got which was the democrat wasn t as good  but maybe it also had to do with the fact that I was already so full.
Torchy's Tacos,90,The breakfast tacos are fatties  I will say that.  Though  I will also say that it was basically an omelets folded into a tortilla.  There are better tacos in town  but Torchy s is pretty predictable in that  in my experience it s never the best and never the worst.
Torchy's Tacos,91,Torchy s Tacos is a great place for some tasty tacos and margaritas. The Democrat  crossroads  green chile pork  baja shrimp  and chicken fajita tacos are great. Guac and chips are awesome  The location on UT campus has plenty of seatings.
Torchy's Tacos,92,Torchys is excellent. You really can t go wrong with any of the wide variety of tacos on the menu  and you most certainly cannot go wrong if you grab a drink at their bar as well. I love the new renovated torchy s  and enjoyed eating at the bar with some friends.  I ordered the mr. Pink taco- I love ahi tuna so this was delicious. The sauces are also very tasty  and there s quite a selection to choose from. My skinny margarita to wash it down was great and strong too. Happy hour is only 50 cents off of drinks  but much cheaper house margaritas and beer.  Service is also very quick here  so if you re looking for a good hearty but quick bite then this is your spot  A must try in Austin.
Torchy's Tacos,93,Not bad Austin  not bad at all Austin.  Coming from San Jose  California we know a little about tacos.  When the locals were saying this is must visit food joint for good tacos I just had to peep it out to see how it compares to the Mexican food back in the bay area  and I was impressed to say the least.  We rolled in here late Saturday night  it wasn t too crowded.  They have a private lot where you can park at and there is plenty of seating once inside.  They have booths and tables you can connect together to make a seating arrangement of 8-12 which were able to do.  Here s what we chowed down on...  Beef Fajita - Carne Asada Taco with onions  pico de gallo  and cheese.  The meat was tender and juicy  did not disappoint.  a href  https   www.yelp.com user_local_photos select V5nwcVCrfVy2_eXKqPGNmA amp userid h4V9maImHWJfFVN7pktuFw  yelp.com user_local_phot   a   Hillbilly Queso - this is a must order to share with a group  has the right amount of kick and not too spicy.  a href  https   www.yelp.com user_local_photos select 0Lwrq4vUSJWc1ZliaZzsBg amp userid h4V9maImHWJfFVN7pktuFw  yelp.com user_local_phot   a   Street Corn - I was expecting corn on a cob but this is in a bowl  wasn t that great and portion is small.  a href  https   www.yelp.com user_local_photos select td1gk2YaLTa-Rela-qr-dw amp userid h4V9maImHWJfFVN7pktuFw  yelp.com user_local_phot   a   Next time I am in Austin I will need to hit up Torchy s again to try the other taco items on the menu   
Torchy's Tacos,94,Omg I m so in love with the queso here   It has guacamole in it and it is heaven sent   I could swim in it.   I recommend the corn shells on the tacos... but that s just me... everything here is DAMN GOOD   Love you Torchy s 
Torchy's Tacos,95,So good.  Wrangler is great and super filling. Fried avocado is a great option if you re looking to avoid meat. Baja shrimp is super tasty.  2 things - the food takes a little while to come out  and there can be a line on the weekends. If you can  avoid getting the tacos to go  as the tortilla and any fried portions of the tacos can get soggy.  Torchy s never lets me down
Torchy's Tacos,96,A good place for casual bites. They had a variety choices of tacos and a limited choice of burritos. The tacos were fresh and fully loaded. However  I didn t find it special.
Torchy's Tacos,97,Hands down best non-traditional tacos I ve ever had  Such unique combinations  I tried the Migas  Fried Avocado  and Mr. Pink . This spot started off as a taco truck down in the SoCo neighborhood  and has since become a reputable restaurant chain.  The Migas taco was a good vegetarian  breakfast taco option  and the Fried Avocado was just so unique  All flavors complemented each other nicely  and their sauces are especially delicious. My favorites were Poblano Rancho and the Diablo sauce  buying a bottle to take back home with me    Didn t get a chance to try the queso  which locals and visitors did recommend 
Torchy's Tacos,98,Kitchy and Awesome vibe. I m gonna be back. So you know I love jalape o and cheddar sausage. Its spicy and juicy. I got that in a taco oh yes   I also got the democrat and the republican to round out my trio and an array of sauces really brought the flavors home. Great fast service and although it was lunch time  contrary to my previous visits we got in and grabbed a table for our crew no sweat   Great place for lunch or dinner 
Torchy's Tacos,99,So good    Was in Austin about a month ago and find myself thinking about how good these tacos were at least once a week. Next time I m in Austin k will definitely be back. I ordered the Tipsy chick and a trashy trailer park - both were amazing   We also ordered queso  guac  and salsa for the table... all were amazing 
Torchy's Tacos,100,Great menu and food was amazing   The restaurant was clean and masks were worn by staff and patrons 
Torchy's Tacos,101,Pro  Keto people you can get their tacos in bowls. I like to get the trashy trailer park and the Democrat in bowls.  Big con  The food takes entirely too long to come out. I waited 40 minutes and they hadn t even started my order. Understandable perhaps if they were slammed or if this was around peak lunch time  but it was at 9 30am. A total of maybe 5 orders went in during the entire time I was there. I eventually decided I had better things to do with my life than wait an hour for a taco and canceled the order. I gave the review 2 stars because the food is normally good  you just have to decide if you have a few spare hours in your life to wait for the food to come out.
Torchy's Tacos,102,What an experience here last Thursday  insert forehead-smacking emoji . Once again our mission to go to El Patio failed because the parking lot there was already a zoo around 4 00 pm. So we ended up here  a location of Torchy s we have deliberately avoided because we always assumed its proximity to the university would mean terrible service and annoying fellow customers. Aaaaaand turns out we were right.  So. The girl working the cash register told us right away that it was her first day  and we immediately gave her a pass and put on our patient pants. That goodwill quickly dissolved when it became clear that she couldn t do anything. She kept screwing up our order  saying the wrong items  asking for help with register buttons  and telling us that our margaritas would be  on the house  when what she had meant to say was  house margaritas.  When we finally sat down and asked to speak to a manager  a guy comes out so young that he looks like he just got out of diapers  and fumbles an apology.   What is going on here   Shockingly  the food managed to be pretty good. We got our usuals  queso and guac  and they were great. Kid got the quesadilla as always  and we split a salad that was good and an Alabama shake taco that was mostly OK.  Needless to say we ll never be patronizing this location again and don t understand how places continually get away with such deplorable customer service. We guess if you re a college kid  you just don t care.
Torchy's Tacos,103,Admittedly for a chain restaurant it s pretty freaking good. There are some tacos that are misses and definitely should be avoided. But for the most part their tacos are hit. If I remember correctly I would avoid the Mr. Orange. I alwahs get the street taco  never disappoints. The queso dip is some of the best queso dip I ever had. I ve tried plenty of queso dips but this one here is always good. No complaints about it at all.   As with just about all their locations  the place is pretty dope. Pretty fun ambience to hangout or catch up with a friend. Some places have a bar which is a cool addition. Not all though. I d go back for sure.
Torchy's Tacos,104,A different take on the average taco. Tasty.  Not a high end spot but good food. They need more staff for sure. I d come back.
Torchy's Tacos,105,It gets an extra star for being one of my Guad go-tos. Many memories made with many different friends at this location for being so close to UT. The Wrangler with extra verde is my personal Sunday morning favorite. Food is tasty but salty and not the cheapest taco around. Just dont compare it to an authentic taco by any standard - funky gringo tacos are their own food group and should be appreciated as such  especially in Austin.
Torchy's Tacos,106,Torchys is a must for me every time I m in Austin      Everything here is so good and it s also cheap. I rank this as a must go in Austin. There are several locations so it s easy to find one   A few of my favorite things are the green chile queso  fried avocado taco  and the shrimp taco. But honestly I have never had a bad taco here  I also love the frozen margaritas.
Torchy's Tacos,107,This is the last time I come to this torchy s. Maybe it because of the student customers but the staff seems to really have no interest in quality. I ordered a half order of chips and queso and a matador. When they finally brought the chips and queso  the cheese was cool and solidifying. Might as well as brought me a knife to slice it off.  Of course  my taco came with no salsa. Cold. Fatty brisket. Come on  seriously  Its like they don t care what they serve. To be honest  this is not the first time this torchys has done this  but now  its consistent.
Torchy's Tacos,108,I hate to give bad reviews but all the times I have been into this particular Torchy s I ve always left unhappy.   Pros  near UT campus  an abundance of seating  CONS  food always disappoints compared to other Torchy s  comes out cold  tastes like it has been made the previous day   the individuals who work here come across as rude  rush you  and don t seem to listen to what your asking when ordering  the wait time is more than 20 minutes with no one in the restaurant  the parking is HORRIBLE  the tacos are extremely overpriced  which wouldn t be a problem if they came out good .   This particular visit I came in with my dad and the man who placed are order in made us feel extremely uncomfortable and was very rude to us. My dad had ordered a drink and the man didn t give him a cup and when we walked off without one he did not try to stop us or tell us. My dad walked back confused  he has never been here and didn t know how the drink situation worked  and the guy just laughed at him and said yeah your forgot your drink. If a server knows you forgot a drink wouldn t you think he would stop us while walking away and hand it to us    OVERALL- very disappointed and will not be coming back to this particular location...if I ever have a Torchy s craving again I will drive FARTHER to one of the nicer  cleaner locations.
Torchy's Tacos,109,My personal philosophy is that the bathroom  or the bathroom experience  really makes the restaurant. For example  I could be at an average 3-star restaurant with just average food and average service  but if they have a bathroom that really shines  and I mean  sparkles  it instantly bumps that rating up to a 4 or even 4.5  The bathroom here is just very average. It s a single restroom that s very spacious  probably the same size as my bedroom in a west campus apartment . The color scheme is a bit lacking with very abrasive red accents on the doors and sinks but pretty much nothing else besides.   The cleanliness is also just average. The urinal isn t flushed but I suppose that s the patrons fault not the restaurant. The counters feel kind of grimy sticky but there aren t any looming issues. My only concern is that the kitchen is right outside the bathroom which I can see how it would improve efficiency but I don t know if that s the best layout.  I really like the single bathroom style rather than a communal bathroom format because of the added privacy and space.   Overall a very functional  not exceptional  bathroom.  P.s. The queso. Also the fried avocado. And trailer park --make it trashy 
Torchy's Tacos,110,Food is good.  Street tacos are hard to mess up... unless you start using it to push politics.  At first it was fun.  Ill have the independant taco. That has changed  The Republican and the Independant were removed.  Guess which one is left.  I want food not your opinion.  Now you can keep both.
Torchy's Tacos,111,good spot for cheap drunk munchies but not if you want a good quality taco. Austin has some of the best tacos in the state and would recommend going to other taco shops or food trucks in the area instead.
Torchy's Tacos,112,Food was great. Wouldn t recommend for vegans... but they do have a few options and are willing to modify some items to make them vegan.   What was bad... sitting at the bar  my partner and I got a lot of bug bites on our legs. Fairly sure we didn t order the bug bites...
Torchy's Tacos,113,First of all why don t we have one in California  I mean seriously  Who do we have to talk to about this. I know Torchy s would be a hit.  I loved it.  Had the Trailer park regular on corn and trashy on flour. Loved it both ways.  Queso- was addicting so many flavors going on. Chips-I love the cantina style  I wasn t a big fan of the Diablo sauce but the poblano sauce was my absolute favorite. Wished they sold that in bottle like they did the Diablo.   Went to two different locations.  The one by the university was spacious and seemed like it enough staff who went around. Greeted by a friendly person at the register. Got the order right. They have extra poblano sauce and chip basked was filled.  This one has a parking lot.
Torchy's Tacos,114,After going to Veracruz this place was kind of a disappoint...I got 2 migas tacos  was given flour tortillas without being asked   and it was a far cry what I had earlier at Veracruz.  I d be willing to give this place another chance  but overall not impressed.
Torchy's Tacos,115,During my most recent trip to Austin  I was lodging near UT. Torchy s Tacos was the firsts place I grabbed lunch during my stay. I ordered grub for me and my dude to dine in. I was surprised to see that there was a bar inside the taco place  which looked pretty well stocked with beers and harder liquors  various tequilas and such . We were pretty tired from our flight  so skipped the bar and just went for food.   I liked it  but my dining buddy was not impressed. This is what we ordered and shared -  - Chips  amp  Guacamole - The Independent Taco  battered Portobello mushroom strips  refried black beans  roasted corn  escabeche carrots  queso fresco  cilantro  avocado  ancho aioli on a tortilla  - Dirty Sanchez Taco  scrambled eggs  fried poblano chile  guacamole  escabeche carrots  shredded cheese  poblano sauce on a tortilla  - Fried Avocado Taco  battered avocados  vegetarian refried beans  pico  lettuce  cheese  poblano sauce on a corn tortilla   Here s the deal about ordering at Torchy s Tacos to dine-in  Get in line. Place order at register and pay  you ll get a number sign to place on your table. If you bought a drink  go to the soda machine. If you just want water  Torchy s  like many businesses in Austin  has a watering station. Waiters will bring you your order. When done  throw away your stuff  don t be that guy . Leave a tip. Boom.
Torchy's Tacos,116,F   ing Nazi s.   I ve been to this torchy s probably 20 times during my four years at UT Austin. They ve messed up my order  15 times. Every time it happens you get this whiney beg from some smelly hometown high school hero on how it s their fault. He tries to give you dainty coupons and call it a day. Well I ve had it... OFFICIALLY. I m never coming back.   So let s talk about this time. I order a green Chile pork and a chicken fajita taco  both with guacamole on the taco. So I get home and open up my food. I receive a sad green Chile pork  no guacamole. Instead of a chicken fajita  I got a brushfire  which I threw away  as it had none of my IBS-related dietary restrictions . And the thing is  it s not like they gave me the wrong bag  the receipt was on it with the proper order.   Whatever  I m so over this. BYE.
Torchy's Tacos,117,This is probably the last I ll go for some tacos. The tacos tastes worse than tacos from my high school lunch. Lets just say it doesn t hit.
Torchy's Tacos,118,A disappointment  greasy food  wobbly tables  and overly saucy food.   We had Veracruz for lunch  and it was much better than this place.    First off  the table was very wobbly.  We changed tables and went to a booth.  Lo and behold  the table was even more wobbly   I think the oil was not hot enough   The tortilla chips were greasy  and the fried chicken and fried shrimp were also soft and greasy.  So was the nookie fried cookie dough-the outside was as mushy as the inside.   The Trailer Park taco was just weird   the fried chicken was greasy  and there was already a sauce  but it also came with another sauce.    Carnita green chile  this was the best one.  Flavorful pork  and fresh flavors.    Miga-I liked Veracruz s version better.  This was less flavorful  with a slab of egg.  The egg at Veracruz was more flavorful and seemed to be pre-mixed with a sauce  trust me  it was better that way .   Barbacoa  looked great  tasted bland.  Shrimp taco  greasy shrimp.  I liked the vegetables inside though.    Chorizo breakfast taco  was okay  nothing special.  Once again  the egg could have been better  softer and fluffier .  Instead  it just tasted like a slab of cooked scrambled egg.    The queso and chips are very good  but the queso is a bit runny and the chips were greasy.   Maybe the other locations are better  but I m not in a hurry to visit Torchy s again  anywhere.
Torchy's Tacos,119,The beef taco  aka The Democrat  was awesome.  The Green Chili Pork taco was MIND BLOWING GOOD     Excellent margaritas too   My wife grew up in Tucson and said that these were THE BEST tacos that she s EVER eaten    Also THE BEST Queso that we ve had while in Austin   and we ve had many other really good ones there too 
Torchy's Tacos,120,Not quite as good as the S Congress location.   The Trailer Trash taco still had crisp fried chicken  savoury queso sauce  and a soft tortilla. The flavor profile is nice though the execution was below the other Torchy s locations.   The verde pork was thinly shredded pork  lightly crisp  and had a sharp bite of tomatillo green salsa.
Torchy's Tacos,121,Boy oh boy was the tacos wonderful here  I ve never tried Torchy s  until my happy self walked into this one with my family  Atmosphere is great  however I waited 15 whole minutes for my elote after I got my tacos. It s a busy place  but please don t forget about your guests. Thanks 
Torchy's Tacos,122,Pretty great tacos with funny names like the Democrat and the Republican. Each taco comes out with a salsa tailored to its contents.   Be aware that if you order tacos without something  like cilantro  that they will come out with that item regardless of your request.   Tacos come double tortillaed and so full that you really need that second tortilla to construct a second taco. One or two of these is a meal  but if you get the chips and salsa or guacamole they are both delicious and come in a healthy potion to share.   Also  options for vegetarians and folks who are gluten free here.
Torchy's Tacos,123,They really are damn good tacos.  I was just in Austin for the weekend  so maybe there are better tacos out there. But Torchy s Tacos left this out-of-towner very happy.   Between my boyfriend and me  we sampled four tacos  - Baja Shrimp  hand-battered fried shrimp with cooked cabbage slaw topped with picked onions and jalape os  cotija cheese  cilantro and a lime wedge  plus chipotle sauce - Tipsy Chick  fajita chicken  spinach  roasted corn  green chiles and cheddar cheese with chipotle sauce and a side of bacon bourbon marmalade - Alabama Shake  catfish  poblano slaw  cotija cheese  peppadew peppers  cilantro and a lime wedge with avocado sauce - Crossroads  smoked beef brisket with grilled onions  jalape os  cilantro  fresh avocado and jack cheese with tomatillo sauce  Oh my gosh  all of them were so delicious. I would have preferred grilled shrimp over fried  but they were still tasty. And the bacon bourbon marmalade on the chicken taco was incredible too. You can t go wrong with any of the tacos I mentioned above  and I m sure the others on the menu are equally flavorful.   I also really liked the sodas they had at the restaurant. I m not normally a soda person  but it was hard to resist the fancy Maine Root sodas. I had the drink pink drink  and my boyfriend tried the lemon-lime.   I read a few reviews that complained about the restaurant being dirty. Maybe that was just a bad day  The restaurant was clean when we ate there.
Torchy's Tacos,124,I had never had torchys before and was about to order 3-4 of them  I thought they were street-style  but ended up just getting two. These things are more like mini-burritos cause they are huge and full of food. Well worth it. There was also no line and people were there fueling up for the UT game later that day. Definitely a go-to place if you re in Austin  though I m not sure if the quality changes based on the location.
Torchy's Tacos,125,Excellent street tacos at a good price  This is probably my favorite Torchy s after the remodel they did a few years back. The inside area is really nice and they have a pretty good size bar. I would definitely recommend stopping by and giving them a shot  The only downside of this location is the parking as it s right near the UT campus. If you can park somewhere else  don t get towed though   and walk it would probably be a better option.  I ordered the chicken fajita taco and the Democrat  which is my favorite . I also ordered the chips and salsa. The chips and salsa came out first which was nice. The salsa could be a little hotter but it s still good. The tacos came out quickly afterwards and smelled amazing. The meat was juicy and tender. The corn tortillas were hot and fresh  they give you two for each taco . They re pretty big so don t expect to leave hungry. They re a little messy to eat but that s to be expected with most loaded street tacos.
Torchy's Tacos,126,I always loved Torchy s when I had it back in houston all the time. This was my first time at the Austin location and I d say it was equally good  if not better because of the more spacious area. Just had one taco this time though  the green Chile pork. It was good if anything a little dry but that s why you just douse it with sauce. Good sized taco  not too small but I definitely think I could have eaten many before getting full.  My friend ordered off the secret menu  just ask to see it  but somehow they must have screwed up his order because he had to wait thirty minutes for it   Even after asking about it. It finally arrived and they refunded him his order which was nice of them.   We came on Sunday at night and they had run out of avocados so they might run out of ingredients towards the end of the nights if you re wanting something specific .  You can sit outside and bring the buzzer with you. You put it on this mat that I think tells them where to give the food to  they bring it to you  pretty good system  you just clean after yourself in the end .  When I came here back in houston I ALWAYS got the fried avocado. I got it once because I was with vegetarians and felt obligated to eat like them so I tried it and was SHOOK at how good it was omg delicious and made me realize I like avocados. I ve gotten the trailer park a couple times but for some reason it never grew on me  I always found it to be too dry but maybe I just have been tasting it wrong.
Torchy's Tacos,127,I was visiting from the Hoosier state and was told by multiple people to check this spot out. I sure was happy I took their advice   Nom tacos  amazing queso  crispy  crunchy tortilla chips and bangin  margs.   I tried the fried avocado and baja shrimp taco. I loved them both but favored the shrimp. Now  let s taco about it. They do not skimp on their tacos. They fill them up and make sure you won t go hungry  I considered ordering three but was happy I stuck with two after see the size.  Soooo  when are we going to get a Torchy s in Indy    
Torchy's Tacos,128,Torchy s slaps. You have to go here if you re in Austin...they also have locations in other cities and states now. The tacos are so flavorful. I love everything I ve gotten there. When I get The Independent I ask for the mushroom grilled instead of fried. The salsa is also amazing. Last time I went to the Spicewood location and found a copy of the secret menu  which I ve never seen before. Didn t  get anything of it but I m sure it s great.
Torchy's Tacos,129,Torchy s is the place  They have a ton of options  some of which are bound to hit the right spot. They have special deals on drinks every day and it s just the right mix of casual and sit-down. I loved the Alabama Shake and the Democrat.
Torchy's Tacos,130,Damn good tacos indeed. I am obsessed with this place. Every taco I ve ever had here is amazing and bursting with flavors. Their Baja shrimp tacos as well as the green chile pork tacos are my favorites. They do such a good job with their flavors I honestly find it hard to believe they sell them for so cheap  And their queso is great too  I love that the location on guad expanded and now has a bar. The drinks at the bar are pretty good too  they have daily deals for cocktails that are as cheap as their tacos  Amazinnnnng. I tried to stop eating here for a bit because it was addicting but I went yesterday and again today... pls help.
Torchy's Tacos,131,Torchy s embodies Tex Mex for me. They say everything s bigger in Texas  Why yes  yes they are. In LA  we re used to puny street tacos that are barely the size of your palm. At Torchy s  they fit an entire sausage in a huge tortilla. Insane ly delicious     Between Sean F. and I  we basically ordered the entire menu. My top    The Republican  Grilled Jalapeno Sausage  Shredded Cheese  amp  Pico De Gallo. Served with Poblano Sauce   If all Republicans were this good    I kid  But really  the sausage was amazingly flavorful in this. I never thought I d have a sausage in a taco...  Brushfire  Jamaican Jerk Chicken  Grilled Jalapenos  Mango  Sour Cream  amp  Cilantro. Served with Diablo Hot Sauce   I m not usually a savory sweet combo kind of person when it comes to my entrees. But  Brushfire had the perfect balance and spice.   I d eat it again but wouldn t be my top choices    Trailer Park  Fried Chicken  Green Chiles  lettuce  Pico  amp  Cheese   So ...this is basically like a chicken snack wrap...but better. I should ve gotten it  Trashy    sans lettuce   queso   Green Chile Queso  amp  Chips  Homemade Chips topped with Guac  Queso Fresco  Cilantro  amp  Hot Sauce   When I was eating this  I thought this was pretty good..then I had TacoDeli s queso. The Queso here is a little too nacho-y cheesy for my liking. The chips are awesome though.   Skip it    The Independent  Hand-battered and fried portobello w  refried balck beans  roasted corn  escabeche carrots  queso fresco  cilantro and avocado drizzled with Ancho Aioli   I can see why this one is a hit with vegetarians but The Republican outshined The Independent this time  D The portobello was PERFECT though. They were like Bottega Louie s Portobello fries. Could eat them all day.  Street Corn  Fresh Roasted Corn off-the-cob corn topped with ancho aioli  queso fresco  cilantro  amp  dusted with new mexico red chile powder   I love me some elote but I wanted more kick to this  LA folks  think Tinga s Elote . It s not bad but not the best I ve had.
Torchy's Tacos,132,A unique twist on tacos and Mexican cuisine  I would recommend a visit if you re up for some pretty flavorful food.   Usually people get two tacos. I got the brushfire and the crossroads.   The brushfire was very  very spicy. Two of my friends also got the brushfire and we all had to take a 5 minute break and numerous water refills to  water down  the spiciness. Still  it was delightful and I enjoyed the mango chicken diablo hot sauce combination.   The crossroads taco was a good  neutralizer   so to speak. I enjoyed the barbacoa a lot. 10 10 on this one. Maybe it s just relief from the leftover spiciness  but I was very glad I ordered the crossroads.
Torchy's Tacos,133,I think this place is a must-try when visiting Austin. It seems to be popular with several locations throughout the city. Came on a weekday while exploring South Congress. It wasn t the best tacos I ve had  but it was solid and filling. The tortilla was pretty big with lots of ingredients to the point where it was hard to hold at times. I would still come back when I visit Austin again.
Torchy's Tacos,134,Baja taco  basic fried shrimp taco. put some extra lime and salsa on it  and keep it with a corn tortilla. then you ll be gucci Trailer trash   I NEVER thought i would like a fried chicken taco...but honestly what is not to like  Flour tortilla  fried chicken goodness and fresh veggies. gosh this thing was good. I woofed it down in almost one fell swoop.  Chips with queso  The gueso is melty ooie and gooie  the guac drop in the middle makes it perfection. the chips were the perfect amount of crunchiness thin shape.   Even though this location is in the middle of frat town  if it s a nice day there is plenty of room to sit outside for a great time.
Torchy's Tacos,135,Good food  nice ambience  great customer service. And awesome salsa verde with the chips 
Torchy's Tacos,136,Great food but the lady working here who I believe is the manager is very unprofessional. The first couple times I interacted with her I figured it was just a busy day and maybe she was in a bad mood  but now it s just an attitude problem. She seems like she just never wants to be there and it creates a very un-welcoming environment.
Torchy's Tacos,137,Don t use mealpal here  they don t understand how to use it yet. The pick up to go order for 12 15 was ready at 1  and that s only when I spoke with one of the waitresses  otherwise I would ve never gotten it. Food was pretty mediocre  because they tried to rush it. Edit  they gave me a meal pal credit back so I added a star. Still made me wait 45 min which was my whole lunch break.
Torchy's Tacos,138,They need this brand everywhere. I would frequent a place like this at least once a week if I had one around. The taco creations are tasty  and the sauces are muy interesting. You can tell these spots are aimed at college students with the stoner-like taco titles and deep-fried chocolate chip cookies   
Torchy's Tacos,139,Attention owners   Your yelp specifically says that apply pay is accepted as a payment but that was not the case when I decided to stop by today. I specifically drove here because Apple Pay is advertised online.  I ve been a customer at Torchy s for a few years but I probably won t be going back for a while because of this horrible management.  If you re going to advertise something make sure it s true. A manager could ve at least tried to helped with the situation but completely denied service   UPDATE   They fixed their page to reflect the correct information 
Torchy's Tacos,140,Hands down best tacos I have had in my life  I was literally speechless after trying it. A local friend gave me the 411 about going. It was unforgettable  Not a fancy pants place inside  clean and kind service  but go for the food. There might be a line but believe me it is worth it  
Torchy's Tacos,141,I would give this store manager a negative 5 stars if it was possible. I called to order two orders and after only taking one order down she rudely hung up on me. Then called again and I then waited on hold for 5 to 10 min while I was already sitting in the parking lot. She finally answered the phone and was very short and rude to me. Once I arrived to the counter to pay she rudely looked me in the eyes and told everyone in line that they will be served first before me. Although the food was on the counter behind her. Then she handed the other people who ordered after Me their food before giving me my food. And of course to top it all off  instead of handing me my food she walked over to a table and set it down on a table cussing at me under her breath. Very unprofessional and also don t have anyone on the floor expect the one person taking all the orders and treating their customers don t matter to them.
Torchy's Tacos,142,Amazing tacos near campus.  We had a large group  of 7  and had a great time.  We came in for lunch on a weekday and although it was crowded  we were able to find a table for our large group.  We ordered several tacos  including a few breakfast tacos during lunch   and I would be remiss not to mention the star of the lunch  the green chili queso     If you order only one thing at this place  get the green chili queso.  It is so addicting and so delicious.  Being from Texas  I eat my fare share of amazing melted cheese.  I have to say this was possibly the best queso I have ever had.  The chicken fajitas were also popular and everyone was a fan.  The special was a shrimp taco which was great as well.   We ordered a few of both corn and flour.  I would definitely recommend this delicious taco joint and even any of its other locations 
Torchy's Tacos,143,Not crowded  nor noisy at 5 45 on Sunday night at the Torchy s near UT. Food came out hot and fast. We ordered the green chili pork taco  tipsy chicken taco and Queso.  All good. I noticed that they are no longer serving Maine Root soda. They are serving Coca-cola products now.
Torchy's Tacos,144,Obviously not the best tacos in Austin but clearly torchys has some amazing creations and It s super yummy and the staff is always super friendly definitely try the trailer park and the crossroads and make sure to get them as both trashy as that adds queso to the tacos for about  .50 more
Torchy's Tacos,145,I came here twice in my two day stay in Austin because I loved it so much. Let me preface my review with that statement.  Torchy s was one of the highlights of my stay in Austin. I was visiting from Seattle and came on a busy Friday night. The line was horrendous  but once I ordered I received the food within 10 minutes. Can t complain.  I ordered the Mr. Orange and the Tipsy Chick. Loved both of them. Wish they had some of this stuff on the west coast.
Torchy's Tacos,146,I love Torchys. If you want loaded tacos at any time of day  go to a Torchys. While they re an Austin chain  they have delicious tacos and amazing queso at a reasonable price. The green chile taco  the democract and the trailer park tacos are my favorite.   If you get the trailer park taco  you can  make it trashy  aka they add heaps of queso. You can t get any better than that. Make sure you ask for extra sides of their different sauces - they are delicious and some are super spicy. You can also ask for their secret menu... these tacos are INSANE and are so so good.
Torchy's Tacos,147,employee working register 10 14 20 at 5 30pm was rude and should learn some basic customer service skills. i asked for a queso  what sizes there were - he proceeded to be blunt and ask me what size i wanted even though i was never told the options. told me there are like 5 sizes but never specified what the options were. he did not have friendly customer service skills and it left a bad taste in my mouth   also joked about not wearing his mask while on shift.
Torchy's Tacos,148,I m vegetarian  so I usually go for a Fried Avocado taco on flour and or an Independent taco. The chips  amp  queso are a must  Busy location  so I usually call-in a take-out order.  If you like spicy food  ask for some diablo sauce on the side.
Torchy's Tacos,149,Don t let the size of the tacos fool you. They are definitely filling  I got three and def couldn t finish. I got the Baja shrimp  diplomat  and Jamaican. Definitely recommend the shrimp and diplomat but stay away from the Jamaican. It s not flavorful and taste bland compared to the others.
Torchy's Tacos,150,This place is excellent   Such yummy  authentic tasting tacos with a twist in a somewhat of a fast food setting. I can t tell you how much I had a hard time ordering. I wanted every thing on the menu  My coworker has a friend local to Austin   we were visiting  who informed her of a secret menu on their blog. Even more options  I highly recommend this spot if you enjoy tacos. The guacamole is delicious. And so is the cheese sauce  which has a bit of guacamole in it. Parking and be iffy when busy and the credit card machine was having issues when we were there. All and all  a good experience.
Torchy's Tacos,151,They don t have Diet Coke  and when you order a Diet Coke  they take your money with a smile and give you a soda cup. Then you see that they have something called Diet Mexicane Cola -- WTH  Then when you ask for a refund on the drink because you want DIET COKE  they say  we have Diet Coke  It s the Diet Mexicane Cola.  THATS NOT DIET COKE    No offense to the Maine Root fair trade certified cane sugar hipster soda company that supplies Torchy s  but Diet Mexicane Soda IS NOT Diet Coke  and it s annoying to have to spans another 5 minutes in a drink refund because staff is not honest about their sodas.   That s my first impression of Torchy s -- and I haven t even SEEN a taco yet. It better  improve from here or this review looks pretty unstellar.   We ordered 2 tacos for 2 people and they both came in one basket. Strike 2.  The Monks special was very good  with 2 eggs cheese green chile  bacon and onions. Ropes with tomatillo salsa  this was a good breakfast taco. One is a meal.   Wrangler was also well stuffed and very good.  Tasty  crisply brisket over eggs with cheese. Another 1 taco meal.   So -- good tacos  counter service that needs improve
Torchy's Tacos,152,Torchys was the bomb.  The cashier was super nice and helpful and recognized me immediately as a Torchys virgin and asked if it was my first time.  She gave me recommendations on what she liked  what was the most popular  etc.  They were all legit and I ordered based on that with a few additional items.  I won t go into detail about each taco because they were all good and I don t think you can really go wrong with anything you order here.  There were also little sauces that came with each taco based on the type.  I like sauces for mexican style food.  After sitting down I decided to get a fountain soda b c they had some unique non big name soda options I had never heard of  I think it was Maine soda co.    and they had a dr. pepper type of soda  a cream soda  prickly pear lemonade and a few more tasty options.  I enjoyed the soda quite a bit  or pop as they say in the midwest.  They also had a pretty full bar right in the middle of the restaurant and that was pretty awesome.  I didn t partake  but I could see myself doing so if I was a local and a regular.  I found Torchys looking on lists of places to eat in Austin and on Yelp and it was recommended to me by a local and a friend  so everyone pointed me to Torchys and everyone was right.
Torchy's Tacos,153,great place and great food.....however....this is a notice to all that come after me....do not park near or in front of the smoke shop next door. you will get a boot on your car which requires  150 to remove    makes for an expensive taco dinner. torchy s...how about a sign inside warning folks   
Torchy's Tacos,154,So we went to get tacos on one really hot afternoon and got the independent taco and one from the secret menu..The tacos were nice and crispy but the filling was a little too eggy for my taste. I really liked the nutella bombs though.. They were really nice.. And portions are perfect not too much and not too little either .. It s worth trying once especially if you want some quick food..
Torchy's Tacos,155,This place is bomb    OMG  We came at around 9pm  just an hour before it closes but the restaurant was still very crowded. I guesd it s a popular spot for college students. Torchy s Tacos at this location is very spacious and can accomodate a large number of customers.   It took me 10mins to wait in line. There were lots of taco options in the menu and tbh  I was a bit overwhelmed by the varieties here. In NYC  all taco places I ve been to offer a limited number of tacos. I decided to have the Democrats and Mr. Orange with 1 2 order of Queso dips  to share with my other 2 friends . The chips came before the tacos and it made a perfect appetizer. I was so in love with the green chili queso dip    The dip was warm  cheesy  a little spicy. I didn t know it also contained guacamole until I scooped the bottom the dip. I don t particular like chips but the dip was so excellent that it made me binge on the chips so much. The tacos were also spectacular    I loved my two tacos equally. The tomatillo salsa came with it was delicious. The shredded beef and blackened salmon were cooked to perfection. I never thought food at a restaurant chain can be this delicious   I finished my tacos without any difficulty  I honestly could eat more  I left Torchy s Tacos so satisfied and happy  I d recommend anyone who comes here to get the queso dip and chips   
Torchy's Tacos,156,I haven t been to all that many locations  but this is one bougie Torchy s. They have a bar...and  3 mimosas on the weekends and other drink specials throughout the week. Somehow that s a bit strange to me - probably because I don t expect that from a taco joint - but that s cool. Can t comment though because I haven t tried any. I generally come to Torchy s with the intention of getting tacos  and tacos only.  As expected  the tacos are HUGE. I don t know how anyone can hold one in their hand and bite into it like a normal taco without everything spilling out. Good thing they have forks so you can eat the innards until it s a more manageable-sized taco. I made the mistake of ordering 2 for myself instead of splitting 3 and I was stuffed to the brim. At least they re good - I recommend the Migas taco and the Fried Avocado   If you want filling and heavy  Torchy s is the way to go. This is a nice location to eat in since there is a decent amount of space compared to other locations I ve seen. I imagine that parking is a huge pain when it s busy though since you re right up on Guadalupe.
Torchy's Tacos,157,Food is just really blah  Ordered the grande burrito with chicken it was really at best ok and I don t think I got more than three little pieces of chicken. Ordered hillbilly queso which came cold and when they brought me a warm one it was just        watered down cheddar with a lump of what was called chorizo bought I would guess closer to jalape o sausage which is not chorizo   Please just avoid this place unless you just can t make it to taco bell for bad food
Torchy's Tacos,158,Love. Love. Love  Best Queso ever  Seriously have dreamed about this place since I vacationed and are there  I wish they shipped 
Torchy's Tacos,159,Go to a different Torchy s. They took 15 minutes to give me my order of guacamole and there was no one waiting before us. Then I get it home  and it s queso - not guac. I m lactose intolerant    I called and was put on hold for a while by the cashier so I just hung up.
Torchy's Tacos,160,I was a regular here  going at least once a week. But over the past two months or so I have continued to receive some of the worst service imaginable. Generally I only care about the quality of food  which continues to be high  but at some point when the service is this bad I have to stop going.
Torchy's Tacos,161,Calling all of my taco lovers - Torchy s Tacos will rock your world. This place understands the need to eat tacos at all hours of the day. In the AM  you can enjoy some of their delicious breakfast tacos. You can try their special tacos or customize your own. For instance  I was able to choose a milder sauce because I m so weak when it comes to hot sauce. I also only ordered two tacos  and I m glad I did  These big guys will fill you up pretty quickly because of all the toppings and ingredients inside of the tortilla shell. Unfortunately  I didn t have time to come back again to try their other tacos  but next time I m in Texas  I am hitting up a Torchy s Tacos for breakfast AND dinner  
Torchy's Tacos,162,Visiting from out of town  everyone was all aboard the Torchy s hype train. We had heard from numerous independent sources that Torchy s queso was a Texan wonder  alongside BBQ and live music.   We indulged in the queso and 4 of their unique tacos  and while we did for the most part enjoy ourselves  at the end of the meal the consensus was  it was pretty good  but nothing amazing . Granted  when it comes to tacos and Mexican food in general it s hard to beat San Diego  but I did appreciate the unique twists the tacos had. The queso was probably the most memorable part of the meal and all the workers were friendly  but for me personally  Torchy s wouldn t make it onto the list of places I have to come back to the next time I head over to ATX.
Torchy's Tacos,163,Excellent Tacos   But apparently im the last ti find out   Austin  you got this one right 
Torchy's Tacos,164,This place seems very popular in Austin.  And rightfully so  their tacos are AMAZING   Got the beef fajita taco  but you can choose anything from hotdogs to shrimp. The taco was really good even without the sauce. My son is addicted to it.  There is a bit of a wait for the food  and parking is very limited  there s free street parking closeby though .  Wish they serve coke products...they only have Maine Root handcrafted beverages. I guess it adds to the hipster vibe.  Located 5 minutes from the UT Austin Campus. Eat here or at Black s BBQ if you are visiting the campus.
Torchy's Tacos,165,I know this place is Austin s favorite homegrown taco place but.... maybe the quality is slipping. Last few times I went I was pretty disappointing with the whole package. Cold-ish food  and too sweet sauces. It s just never blown me away.  I guess that s just what happened when trailers become chains.
Torchy's Tacos,166,The Mr. Pink  ahi tuna  tacos were delicious  the bush one  not so much.   This is not an authentic San Diego or Mission  SF style taco  instead  these are eclectic modern takes on the simple taco. Interested in fruit veggie toppings and mayonnaise-based sauces  Even if you re not  you ll still love this place.  The restaurant also includes a large covered outside patio and full bar inside.
Torchy's Tacos,167,Good tacos  a bit spendy but great flavor makes it worth it. I d be a regular if I lived here.
Torchy's Tacos,168,Coming to Austin for a visit  a lot of people throw this restaurant as a place to try when you re in town. All of the branches have great reviews that I thought I would try this place out. I think that I had too high of expectations because the breakfast taco seemed okay and bland but the trailer park taco was way better. Not my favorite taco spot but I m glad I tried it.
Torchy's Tacos,169,I love Torchy s  but the service at this one is just appalling. The system doesn t work.   I tried to eat there last night. I was alone  so I sat at the bar so that I wouldn t take up a whole table. I showed the waitress where I was sitting so that she would know where I was. She repeated my number  29  to me  and said she d just remember where I was. I then hung my number on one of the hanger things anyway  when one was available.   Then I waited nearly an hour for my food. I finally asked the bartender if there was some way to check on my food  she said I had to go track down the waitress. After a while  I found the waitress  and said I d seen people come and go  but hadn t been served. She said she hadn t seen me  and brought my food. Of course  at this point  my food was cold and I was starving.   I said to cancel my check. She left and I had to wait around to make sure it was canceled  but she didn t come back to tell me. I found her again  and she said she thought they would have taken it off. I called to talk to someone about the issue and the phone was out of service.   The hanging tag system doesn t really work - I feel like half the times I go there we have to do the waitstaff s job for them because they can t cover the whole restaurant. It seems to me that they re understaffed.   Very disappointing - time wasted and no Torchy s for me.
Torchy's Tacos,170,Up to this point  I ve been a periodic guest of Torchy s and I absolutely adore their scrumptious menu and devilish aesthetic  but my experience yesterday was downright terrible. First  they mistook my order with someone else s and it added an additional 15-20 minutes to complete. Due to the wait  I was running short on time and I asked the staff to pack up my order and make it to-go  rather than dining in. I explicitly told them which tacos I ordered before departing and when I got home  discovered that they gave me someone else s order. Twice  they made the same error. Also  I m not one to meticulously nag or nitpick  but the cashier wasn t exactly friendly and amiable as well.
Torchy's Tacos,171,Not super busy  Very clean. I received my order quickly. When I ate my chips  I noticed they were very stale. I asked who I think was the manager  only Bc I happened to run into her  I wasn t seeking her out  if I could have my chips replaced and she said ok. She went to the back with my chips  and never returned. I waited over 50 minutes before I decided to get up and ask someone where my chips were. Turns out  she left without telling anyone  so I would ve been waiting for who knows how long. I know they re just chips  but if part of your job is to serve customers  you should do it. I love torchys  but I ll never be coming back to this one.
Torchy's Tacos,172,Came to Austin for 2 days and everyone who I ve asked where to go for some amazing food here  all said torchys. AND CAN I SAY  they were SOOOOO right. the tacos are mouthwatering and addicting. I highly recommend this place and honestly wish I had one of these places where I live 
Torchy's Tacos,173,Popped in here while visiting some friends in Austin. Very good  quick service  and great outdoor seating area with heaters on a beautiful February evening 
Torchy's Tacos,174, Damn good  definitely describes these tacos but a bit expensive   4 taco . They re kind of small in my opinion but still really delicious. I got the Chicken Fajita Tacos. There s plenty of seating inside and service is great. I definitely will be back for more  I want to try the other flavors  
Torchy's Tacos,175,I love Torchy s. Their tacos are consistently delicious and their queso is some of the best. Their cocktails are also incredibly underrated. The problem with this specific Torchy s location is that they never get things right.   I was at this location and received my order quickly  however my friends were waiting on their order well past when I had finished eating. We saw other people who had ordered after us receive their chips and queso and my friends asked where theirs was since they ordered before those customers. The server gave a dismissive response and continued handing out chips and queso to what seemed like everyone else in the restaurant.   Finally the manager came up and told them their order was almost ready and that the holdup was caused because they ran out of queso. What     So she brings them their order and it s in a to go bag. My friends did not order their food to go. She tells them to take it in the to go bag or it s going to take the kitchen even more time to prepare it as an in-restaurant order.   They opened the bag and it had the wrong tacos. They went back to the kitchen to get the correct tacos and again brought them out as to-go orders. They agreed to comp part of the meal but it was not a pleasant experience.
Torchy's Tacos,176,Came here for Breakfast after a night out in town. They ve got a secret menu and if you re reading this and you didn t know then...  The food is good. Not too pricey. Better than whataburger and if you ve already had in n out across the road then give this place a go.
Torchy's Tacos,177,Hmmm  I would say that Torchy s is overhyped. Service was great  the place was clean and aesthetically pleasing  but the food wasn t mind blowing like I thought it d be. I m not sure if it s because I m from San Diego where the tacos are more authentic and my mind is just fixated on these tacos  but I honestly still thought Torchy s was just okay.  The cool things that I do appreciate and like about Torchy s though is the fact that they have a wide variety of flavors and combinations of tacos - from different types of breakfast tacos to fried chicken tacos to even secret menu jinormous tacos that are loaded with sauces and food  perfect after a night of drinking  just sayin  .   During my trip  I honestly forgot what all the tacos were called because I asked the cashier for his recommendations  but they were all pretty interesting and the restaurant already pairs them up with the complementary sauce. I picked the flour tortilla for all my tacos  but it tasted a bit too flour-y for my liking. Something everyone has to try when coming here though is the queso cheese  which was super good   That was probably my favorite thing there. Oh  And the Street Corn  which was topped with aioli  cheese  cilantro and red chili powder  which me and my boyfriend both enjoyed a lot.  Overall  I would say that it s definitely worth visiting Torchy s when visiting Austin for their cool spin on tacos and such  but it wasn t one of the most memorable-tasting foods during our stay.
Torchy's Tacos,178,You can t stumble 10 feet in Austin without finding a taco somewhere. But Torchy s Tacos manages to stand out with fun  inventive fare that hits the spot.  I wasn t really even hungry when we visited here after a weekend of gorging ourselves on Texas delights. I still had to try it  though  and we went to the location near campus. I got the Trailer Park taco  which comes with fried chicken and other goodies. It was fantastic. i also ordered a side of the Mexican street corn  thinking I would just have a taste of that. I ended up devouring it and couldn t believe how well the aioli  cilantro  queso fresco and chili powder enhanced the flavor of a normally bland vegetable.   I ll definitely go there again next time in town  this time with a heartier appetite so I can eat even more of these terrific tacos.
Torchy's Tacos,179,DEEP FRIED AVOCADO TACOS YESSSS  Super fast and friendly service at this joint. The tacos are HUGE. I had 2  and that was more than enough to last me through lunch.
Torchy's Tacos,180,Lover Torchys Tacos  I didn t think a chain spot would be this good  But the tacos are awesome  I love the different style tacos they have here. All very delicious in Austin 
Torchy's Tacos,181,Don t get me wrong. I love Torchy s. But the Guad location is TERRIBLE. The staff are inept college kids  who clearly hate their jobs  are rude and disconnected  and they always screw up your order. I ve been given one taco instead of two  even though I was charged for two  more times than I can count. Once  they gave me a chicken quesadilla with no meat in it. How disappointing is that  to drive all the way home  and realize some idiot sociology major left the meat out of your taco   Their to-go order delivery procedure is straight up BROKEN. More than once  I ve ordered to-go  at the counter  and then I sit there  waiting for my order...  The runner brings my order not to me  but to the counter people. And then it just sits there  as they are taking orders from other customers. I m sitting there  my food is sitting there  and no one s bringing it to me. I have to go up and say  Hey  isn t that my order   Or we would both just be sitting there forever  two stalled ships in the night  so close and yet so far.  It s usually way too crowded  so you think  I ll just call ahead  to reduce the wait.  But then they put you on hold  and leave you there... forever. One time I called and called  but just got a busy signal. And even when they aren t crowded  they still screw up and take too long. Worst customer service of any Torchy s location  for sure. Also  their parking is always full  and there is a sharp incline on the way in  so you better not drive a low-rider in there  or it WILL bottom out. I always have to park in the underground parking for the condos down the street.  It s actually worth the time to drive north  to the Burnet location  which is never crowded.
Torchy's Tacos,182,I come here often with my roommate  and it s a place I bring my friends to if they re visiting from out of state. Go to order is the Democrat on corn  and then I usually get a queso to share. I ve also heard good things about their breakfast tacos and the trailer park.  It s a popular place so the line can get long at times  but it usually doesn t take too long for them to take your order. The food comes out pretty fast afterwards.
Torchy's Tacos,183,Are breakfast there every day of my Austin trip  because why wouldn t you enjoy a very filling  delicious taco for only  3.75       When I first walked in  I thought for sure everyone would need to order two  because how much can 3.75 fill you up   But then I saw the baskets go by. Holy cow. One is plenty. If these guys were in Portland  I d be here every day.
Torchy's Tacos,184,GET THE QUESO  It s as simple as that.   Their delicious green chili queso surprised me with its avocado center. I couldn t stop eating it  It s definitely the best thing on the menu.  Queso  5 5  Their taco sizes are definitely generous. 2 Torchy s tacos are equivalent to the size of 4 traditional street tacos.  Besides that  the tacos aren t to die for. We ordered 6 different tacos off the menu. Most of them were ok standard. I wasn t impressed by one of their breakfast tacos.  Don t remember the names  Nothing blew me out of the park.   Tacos  3 5  I don t recommend this place for tacos  but I do recommend it for the queso and the overall experience. This is not your traditional taco joint and it s definitely not a traditional taqueria. The service was decent and the interior is super cute. The restaurant is huge but the parking lot is limited. Swing by if you are visiting Austin. Its apparently  the spot  in Austin for tacos. But in my opinion  the queso is the only thing worth getting on the menu. It s delicious and won t let ya down   Overall experience  3.5
Torchy's Tacos,185,As an out-of-towner I have extremely mixed feelings about Torchy s.  Part of me thinks Torchy s is pretty overrated I can definitely say I ve had better tex mex in Austin but compared to what we have in VA  Torchy s can take the crown any day.  The fried avocado would probably get a five star from me but the beef fajita tacos are always pretty average when I feel like that should be one of the better ones.  The size of the taco s are definitely a plus  they are huge  You d probably be just fine eating one if your normal portion at any other taco joint is 2 but I always order two to get the variety. This location is pretty big with lots of indoor seating and a covered outdoor seating area. There s a full bar on the inside so you can get drinks while you re waiting for your food  however this location is on campus and it s always a little difficult to find parking.
Torchy's Tacos,186,I should preface this review by saying that the only reason I m giving them four stars instead of five is the fact that they serve their tacos on cold tortillas Which become cartoney and fall apart. This is a completely criminal thing to do anywhere in Mexico or in any respectable Taqueria  however  they redeem themselves with the filling of the tacos which is excellently prepared.
Torchy's Tacos,187,If you re looking for a 30 minute to-go wait  then being served up a shrimp  not  to go  sending it back  taking another 10 minutes to wrap it to go  then getting in your car and finding  this thang cold - then TT is just for you.   I apologize to you out-of-towners or discerning Austinites  you deserve better. I ve bailed from the Austin food scene but my 91 yr old momma needs weekly visits  and today I was hungry.  Graceland  I m coming home to eat  where friendliness and customer service is cooler than a body covered in ink. Thank you  thank you very much. E
Torchy's Tacos,188,Heaven wrapped in delicious tortilla... College town  college taco  need I say more. One bite of any taco on the menu will have you wanting to run around the quad naked. No telling what a second bite will do.....
Torchy's Tacos,189,Torchy s..I have given you so many chances to impress me and I am disappointed every time. I have been randomly stopping in for the past 3 years of my college career...and I am always underwhelmed. The fried avocado taco is good but so heavy in my stomach....it didn t last very long before reappearing. After a 10pm breakfast taco craving  I decided to give the migas a try. Bland. Tasteless. Meh. I am so underwhelmed by the flavors that I really need to stop trying.   2 stars for the quick service and the fact that they have Maine Root sodas. Other than that  I do not believe it is worth the hype and I m done giving Torchy s my money and chances. Go to TacoDeli instead.
Torchy's Tacos,190,Torchy s makes good tacos.  While they aren t the best tacos I ve had recently  the combination of a tasty flavors  a wide variety of options  and reasonable prices makes Torchy s Tacos a winner.    Of the 3 tacos I ordered  the Baja Shrimp was excellent  and the Crossroads and Democrat where both good but unremarkable.  The queso though is outstanding  with a great flavor  velvety texture  and nice amount of heat.  As far as beverages  the margaritas are quite good  and the location we visited had a nice selection of beers on tap.
Torchy's Tacos,191,Good tacos  but a bit pricy. Definitely recommend the Queso and the trailer park taco  make sure to get it trashy  substitute the lettuce for queso . Overall a very good taco place.
Torchy's Tacos,192,As a native Californian  I had my reservations of trying TexMex while in Austin. Fortunately  I caved and I am so glad I did  It was a totally different take on tacos  definitely not like how it is made in Cali. The cheese with tomatillo sauce made all the difference in the world  and sets it apart from any other taco I have tried in my lifetime. I would highly recommend trying the breakfast tacos  crossroads and the fried avocado. This will definitely be one of my pit stops if I am ever back in Texas 
Torchy's Tacos,193,Torchy s Tacos  the small trailer restaurant that turned into a booming franchise with over 50 locations. I have to say  I enjoyed my experience at Torchy s. While the tacos were mediocre and the fried cookie dough had a weird texture  the ambiance of Torchy s was amazing  not at all like most fast-food restaurants. The dark walls and rustic furniture gave the impression of a nicer  classier fast food restaurant. Even the tables and chairs gave the rustic-but-still-modern impression. The service was also incredible. I arrived in a group of 20 people and the cashier didn t seem fazed and did not mess up any of our orders. Not only that  but all 20 of our orders arrived in under 10 minutes  Now  about the tacos. I thought the tacos were fine. There wasn t anything particularly amazing about the tacos  but they weren t awful either. They were just fine. But I believe the experience made up for the mediocrity of the tacos. So if you re looking for a restaurant with great service and prime spots to take pictures  Torchy s is the place to go. But if you re looking for good tacos  try somewhere else.
Torchy's Tacos,194,I would love if they expended this chain to other areas of the US. I tried Torchy s for first time in Austin Texas and it was damn good  The tacos are fresh  delicious and well priced. It seems like there s always a line  but it s worth it in the end. The college kids here are getting spoiled with this.
Torchy's Tacos,195,If you re an Austinite that has never tried Torchy s  are you really an Austinite  After living in Austin for several years and hearing incredible things about Torchy s  I pretty much had to give it a try.  I had the normal chicken taco   4  in a corn tortilla. The flavors were great  but the corn tortilla was not strong enough - everything fell apart  so I basically just ate a taco bowl  not ideal . I had the most spicy sauce and finished it all  which was probably a mistake on my part. My mouth was on fire for 20 minutes afterwards   I m not the biggest fan of tacos  but Torchy s was alright. Not the best place on the UT campus  but a great representation of the Austin culture.
Torchy's Tacos,196,I come here quite often. They have some of the best AMERICAN tacos in Austin. Their flavors are unique and very good. I usually get the brushfire taco because the mango with jalape o really goes hand and hand. It s so good and two of them are quite filling. Only 270 calories a taco  I also get the hillbilly which is a secret menu item similar to their Trailer Park taco. The chorizo with bacon on it really makes the whole taco amazing. Some times I get their green chilli queso and chips if I m feeling an appetizer. Best chips  amp  queso in Austin hands down. The service is often fast and the prices are good. I m always satisfied when I come 
Torchy's Tacos,197,Great spot. Good prices. Which means  expect a line during the weekends. But worth the wait.  The chips  amp  queso and baja shrimp tacos were fan favorites with our group 
Torchy's Tacos,198,I got the fried avocado  Baja shrimp and mr. pink tacos. All were delicious. This is my second time here  and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin or any locals. Try it with the diablo sauce on the side. YUM  I went on a Thursday  so there was no line  and was served pretty fast.
Torchy's Tacos,199,Have you tried Torchy s queso     If you haven t then you re definitely missing out  Best thing about the place. But this locations queso tasted like broccoli and cheddar soup  Maybe I was on something but that s what I tasted.  I had a trailer park taco and it was okay  not good enough to order again
Torchy's Tacos,200,I love torchy s and all their food but I m giving 2 stars vs. 4 or 5 because of one worker. I ordered my food and got my drink cup  got myself a doppelg nger  and tried to make my way over to get a lid and straw. This is what made my experience here unpleasant. There was another guy in front of me trying to also get a lid and straw for his drink and he could not get to the items because a worker was standing in front of them making a coffee for herself. She saw us standing there waiting but did not make an attempt to ask us if we needed anything or slightly move over to the side to let us grab what we needed and go. She looked at us with a glare - not so friendly.. As a worker  service should be on their mind but this was not the case here. It s not that big of a deal. I m not butt hurt and will come back here when I m craving torchy s but I did not like this worker s attitude.   Food  I always get the democrat and decided to try the mr pink today. Good as always
Torchy's Tacos,201,When I think about Torchy s  I transcend time and space in my mind to that day when my mouth met the trailer park taco. Fried chicken on a taco  Hellz yes  The taste and crunch of the fried chicken is so memorable to me-- hot  lightly battered  perfectly seasoned  moist cut of chicken. That chicken left an impression in my long term memory  and continues to queue my salivary glands. Quite possibly the best fried chicken I ve tasted  all tucked away conveniently in an  extra trashy  taco with red chilis  lettuce  pico de gallo  and cheese.  Oh  there goes my salivary glands again...
Torchy's Tacos,202,Love the staff here and the food. Able to walk to.   Cons are parking lot as it s off the strip.
Torchy's Tacos,203,When i have torchys i always look forward to the plethora of greasy tacos and extremely salty chips with queso. When i came here and had the tacos they came out a little cold. We told the waiter it was cold and he responded  im cold   Implying that he thought he looked cool. We proceeded to tell him It was about the taco and then when he brought it back it was still cold. The waitress working also had a little attitude when talking about some matter. Overall not the best experience. Would recommend taco bell for similar food options and better prices.  thetruthshallsetyoufree
Torchy's Tacos,204,The trailer park taco is the best I have ever eaten in my life. I also had the Democrat and it was pretty good as well. I really didn t like any of the sauces. I also really didn t like any of the drink choices so you should just probably go for the water or have a drink at the bar. Plenty of seating they also have a couple of outdoor tables. Nice atmosphere over all. But the tacos make the place. Will be returning.
Torchy's Tacos,205,Totally got my heat on here  As a Texan transplant in SoCal  I miss my barbacoa  aka cabeza  tacos and chili con queso. So when I m in ATX  I head to Torchy s for a Democrat taco y queso. Torchy s does not disappoint ever. The bartender just told me that their other top seller is the Trailer Park taco featuring fried chicken. And they have all kinds of other combos including street tacos  salmon  seared ahi tuna and pork verde. There is a choice of 6 different salsas from super mild to habanero. And it appears that they serve breakfast tacos all day  as any legitimate taco purveyor should. And that s it in a nutshell  er  taco shell.
Torchy's Tacos,206,My 14 year old son and I had this for dinner while we were in Austin. He got the chicken fajita  amp  trailer park and I got fried avacado and trailer park. We also got an order of queso. The queso is really good with a little bit of heat. My favorite was the trailer park - it was really good. I also really liked their ice 
Torchy's Tacos,207,My love of tacos is well known across the land. I have a taco tie  taco socks  and a taco painting right above my bed.   I haven t been to Austin before  but was told Torchy s was a chain I had to try. I  am always a sucker for warm chips and salsa brought to the table without asking. We also were able to ask for refills and they were very generous piling on more chips for us.    I specifically ordered the breakfast taco called the Dirty Sanchez which were good  but I am not typically a breakfast food kind of guy.  Very hearty tacos though. I would recommend trying Baja shrimp tacos  they were very good as well.  I would come back if ever in Austin.
Torchy's Tacos,208,The food is really good. The only complaint that I have is that it is spicy. Even the people I was eating with said that their food was spicy and their moths handle spicy foods good
Torchy's Tacos,209,Being from south Texas I know a good taco when I taste  amp  are one  Service was great cashier could of been a bit friendly  however she knew the menu well
Torchy's Tacos,210,Great food  not the best service though. We had to wait in line again  just to get some sour cream  because there was only one cashier and only one waitress walking around that was already busy. Overall  the food was great and low priced  
Torchy's Tacos,211,Here s the deal. If you re not from Texas or better yet a true home to tacos like Mexico  you d likely give this place 5 stars. I m going with three knowing the caliber of the taco scene in the ATX area. For a great lunch  Torchys won t steer you wrong. Great place to take friends even a date I suppose if they ve never been. They always come up with some wild creations but have their staple tacos year round.
Torchy's Tacos,212,The food is great and really fresh. The regular bartender was out and the manager had to fill in. He was very knowledgeable and kind. He made me a signature drink based upon our conversation and I LOVED it  The guy who took our order name was Brandon. He very kind and I really appreciate it. We had such a awful time in austin this weekend  dealing with racism everywhere we went. It was refreshing to deal with a staff that is so nice and professional.  Greatly appreciated 
Torchy's Tacos,213,Didn t realize that this was a chain restaurant... I wouldn t dare compare it to other chain taco joints though. This place is super unique and flipping amazing  We had the baja shrimp  trailer park  get it trashy   mr orange  and the fried avacado  Everything was spot on and the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a   I am a huge stickler for service and these guys did not disappoint  It was our first time going and they answered all of our questions  Also  I did not like the Mexican cola.... But  The pink drink  prickly pear and pink lemonade  and black cherry soda was fabulous  Get a side of street corn to end your meal  you won t regret it  If you were thinking about torchys  don t  Just jump on in and enjoy 
Torchy's Tacos,214,I ordered tacos for here and they gave me tacos togo. And the sever wasn t very nice when I complained about it.
Torchy's Tacos,215,We sauntered in on a Saturday morning and found a line of about half a dozen people which moved quickly. I think this is a newish Torchy s. They are all great with the same fantastic tacos. I did notice this one seemed to be more alcohol forward with their menu. Perfect for the college crowd.  Just beware of tables filled with over the top noisy young college gals who might still be tipsy from their night on the town. You will not be able to carry on a conversation with your boyfriend  husband  girlfriend  lover  child. Otherwise  it s Torchy s. Best queso in the world.
Torchy's Tacos,216,Such delicious tacos for such good prices. Loved the vegetarian option they offered when I was last there  had mushrooms  the most. The chicken and salmon were good too. Great  fast service.
Torchy's Tacos,217,Taco creations are great  They also have homemade soda here. Tried The Republican and chile pork and both were not disappointing.  The location by UT has a bar you can sit at.  They also have seating outdoors. Parking is almost non existent but you can find some at the nearby park and walk over.
Torchy's Tacos,218,I am obsessed with breakfast tacos. It s the one food item I miss most after moving to Chicago. Torchy s does them perfectly.   I always get the fried avocado on corn and one is usually enough. You can basically split one taco into two with how much is given with one order.   Incredible taste  amp  super fast service every time I ve been to any location both in Austin and Houston.
Torchy's Tacos,219,Oh  Torchy  how I ve heard about you from my Austinite friends. How I longed to experience your tacos and compare them to my past ex-tacos. Would you be better  Or would it be another example of an overpromised and underdelivered dream   I have no complaints about the quality of the ingredients. You are indeed good. The best  No  but nothing to complain about. I had the green chile pork taco and The Democrat  barbacoa . The green chile pork was a bit bland  except for the green chile. The Democrat was delicious and despite being advertised as coming with a corn tortilla  I got it with flour and recommend the flour tortilla over the corn.  I would have given Torchy s 4 stars  except my husband s order was a complete mess. He ordered a burrito with black beans and without any sour cream. It arrived with pinto beans and drowning in sour cream. The bean mix up we can handle  but we can t stand sour cream. So we sent it back. The new burrito came with the correct beans  no sour cream  but now the meat got switched to chicken instead of beef.   Someone is not paying attention in the kitchen.  The service  otherwise  was fine.
Torchy's Tacos,220,After coming highly recommended by a friend back in NYC  I ate Torchy s 5 times over a 3 day trip to Austin for my  now  brother-in-law s bachelor party.  Twice I excused myself group activities to secretly go eat tacos. Thankfully this treachery went undiscovered.  These tacos are truly phenomenal and totally worth risking your relationships over  I d do it again if I could.
Torchy's Tacos,221,Torchy s was the first place we ate in Austin and I wanted to keep going back. The tipsy chick was sooooo good   I also really enjoyed the elote  flavorful and not overly mayonnaisey.  I wasn t impressed with the guacamole  it needed salt   The queso was spicy and delicious.  The bartender seemed over whelmed and even though our order went in well before our friends ours came out well after. When we asked him about our order he got flustered. Food was a 4 Service was a 3
Torchy's Tacos,222,Torchy s Tacos  a pretty average place. Overall  it has great vibes and is a fun place to go to. Would I take out time in my day to go there  No I would not  but if I am passing by I might as well go in and get a salad. Now let s get into why. To start off  I could smell the tacos from across the street which made me excited for school. Also  the lit-up red Torchy s sign in the front was very pleasing and is sure to attract customers. We got there and the line was not too long  but the design was awesome. There was wood and cool lights hanging from the ceiling and it gave off some very modern vibes. Of course  it is a Torchy s Tacos so it was very crowded and there was not much seating. Despite this  overall the process of getting my food was a pleasant experience. Sadly though  that would be the best experience I would be having  because from there it just went downhill. The food took longer than expected to come out and I have to say  I was not impressed. From first sight my taco looked like a mess of folded tortilla and unmelted cheese. And the taste was even worse. The chicken didn t taste like chicken but instead an odd smokey flavor. And the cheese was far from melted  and due to my order  a chicken and cheese taco  I expected it to come at least a bit warm. But instead I got a not appetizing  plate of cheese and chicken. I tried to be patient  because I still had dessert. Then came the fried cookie dough balls  also oddly late. And I have to say  I was pretty excited. I am a sucker for cookie dough  but these were honestly  repulsive. First of all  you could tell the cookie dough was not fresh because of the thick If it was fresh then it would be much less hard. Second of all  it wasn t crunchy at all  and instead was flaky and chewy. So you could say my food experience was not the best. Would I ever come here again  Maybe  but I would definitely order something else. Overall  I would rate this place a 2.9 out of 5  the experience was great  but the food brought it down.
Torchy's Tacos,223,Tacos are sublime. The Independent will kick your plant based skinny ass. The burnout jerk chicken was not bad either. This was all eaten under less than ideal conditions. It was in flight food  but I didn t get to it until landing a few hours later. Speaking of that  these tacos took a looooong time. We were sweating because we had a rebooked flight to catch. Four tacos took about 15 minutes to get.
Torchy's Tacos,224,I was talking to my Uber driver about some great places to go out to eat and he mentioned torchy s tacos... OK I have to figure out a way to eat at all the places  he mentioned and luckily  I was able to make it to torchy s tacos that evening and man am I glad that I went  The food was absolutely incredible  It was house margarita night so I started off with the frozen margarita which I usually don t order  but it was absolutely phenomenal. I ordered one of the fish tacos  which had fried catfish and mole sauce with cheese and a few other toppings. Absolutely incredible  The fish was crunchy  crisp  and very fresh. It was catfish by the way. I also got one of the carnitas tacos. I m not quite sure which one it was but it was delicious as well.
Torchy's Tacos,225,I don t think I ll ever be coming back here after tonight and it isn t because of the food. I was waiting in line to pick up my food and I felt something land on my shoulder and looked over and didn t see anything until a giant cockroach crawled up to my other shoulder. Turns out it had fallen from the ceiling onto me  I don t even know if I want to eat the food I got now because if they have roaches falling on customers in the dining area then who knows what s in the food prep area in the back.  Yuuuuck Time to go take the worlds longest shower.
Torchy's Tacos,226,Every time God closes a door  he opens a Torchy s.  Or something like that.   At least that s how I feel  coming to the end of the Drag  hungry  with that tatoo-parlor-reject of a demonic cherub flagging you down like the sister you never appreciate.   It s Torchy s. The tacos aren t cheap  but they re big  interesting and pretty damn good.
Torchy's Tacos,227,Worst Torchy i have been to. 20 min wait for 3 tacos online order  with almost No customers and still they come from Kitchen with cold tacos after the long wait  Not coming back to this one very disappointed.
Torchy's Tacos,228,Yummy delicious tacos. I ve had the trailer park taco  such a hilarious name   the baja shrimp taco  and the crossroads taco. All were great. This location has a full bar  too  which is awesome  get a margarita . I love the different salsas they give you for your tacos. I ve also had  their chips and guac  which were pretty dang good. Next time I m in Austin I ll be back 
Torchy's Tacos,229,Now before everyone flips out  I m not giving torchys 2 stars I m giving this location 2 stars.   Staff seems nice  food came out quickly  that s where the 2 stars comes from.   The place was so dirty  tables were crusted with salsa and guacamole  floor was dirty  bathrooms were dirty  drink area was cluttered and dirty. That should have been the hint    The food - Guam and chips were great. The beef fajita taco was seasoned well but the steak tasted like it had been cooked hourssss ago and had been sitting in a hot bin all day. The peppers and onions on it were borderline raw  they had a hint of char but def weren t close to cooked. Boyfriends burrito was almost all beans  could barely find the meat and the amount of beans with Fuad made the whole thing kind of mush.   We ve been to tochys in muller a few times and it s always been amazing so we will be back to torchys we won t be back to his location.
Torchy's Tacos,230,I used to not like Torchy s  but one day I decided to try the Jack of Clubs off their public  secret  menu and everything changed. It is the most amazing breakfast-like taco I have ever had and the diablo sauce is absolutely to die for if you enjoy spicy foods. It s been hard trying anything else off the menu because it is just that good.  I am not as impressed by the fajita tacos or the fried avocado taco. They are really great tacos  but nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion. The chips can sometimes be oversalted  but are a good choice to complement the tacos.   The service is always super quick. If you re not going to dine-in  I would recommend calling in advance and picking it up to go so that you can skip the line. They have never lost my order before and are accurate with their time predictions.   The recent renovations to the place are just wonderful. More seating and a bar  what more can you want 
Torchy's Tacos,231,I just moved here for the summer from NYC never knew I could a taco chain so much. Fair prices and you can order online beforehand to pick up. The brushfire and pink drink are my favorite.
Torchy's Tacos,232,Came here for dinner and it was great  I tried the fried avocado taco on a flour tortilla and it was amazing  I had never tried a fried avocado before  but it surprisingly worked really well. The chips and queso were que-soo good as well 
Torchy's Tacos,233,First time at this location. Very easy to find it s in the same bldg as a smoke shop. I got the democrat  chicken fajita  chips with queso. Everything was delicious and I only got a half order of chips. I like how they are made with salt and it wasn t to salty if you know what I mean    Btw don t park in front of the bldg unless you back in. It s a pain to get out.
Torchy's Tacos,234,boycotting torchys till they bring back all the tacos for some like it hot. bring back the scalding pig  barn burner and the creeper. the bottle rocket shrimp inst even that spicy. come on torchys corporate get your head out of your butt  and fix this
Torchy's Tacos,235,But first  Tacos  Yes  Torchys Tacos is a chain  but you can t beat it. The best tacos I ve had in awhile. If you re looking for early bites then say yes to a breakfast tacos because a real and amazing thing.  I would move to Austin just for these tacos 
Torchy's Tacos,236,Was craving a breakfast taco and didn t have time to go somewhere far away from campus. Let me tell you  their breakfast tacos are cheap  delicious and filling. I have had their daytime tacos before  obviously and LOVED them  but yesterday was finally able to try the breakfast tacos.   The bacon was thick cut and the cheese serving was generous -- two of my favorite things   . In my opinion the taco had a bit too much egg but easy to take out. Would highly recommend swinging by for a quick and satisfying breakfast.
Torchy's Tacos,237,1st- breakfast tacos are 4-4.5 star- they are pretty amazing   But the restaurant as a whole is really just on par with any other mexican you can get in the area. In the northeast this would be 4.5 star as a whole but with Austin competition they need to wow me more and after multiple visits I am not  wowed.  That being said I have returned when visiting Austin because it is tasty  affordable  quick  and multiple locations.
Torchy's Tacos,238,I love Torchy s so much. They have amazing queso and a classic guacamole. I highly suggest getting one or both. The tacos are of course scrumptious as well. Pro tip  ask to see the secret menu 
Torchy's Tacos,239,It was 10 am  none of the good lunch places near campus were open so I decided to hit up Torchy s. I expected subpar Americanized tacos and I got a pretty decent tasting Democrat. However  the taste wasn t as radical and extraordinary as the name implies   . It was mostly overpowered by a larger portion of beef to everything else. I got corn tortilla and that in addition to the avocado kept it somewhat interesting.   At  4 for a taco though  I can t justify. If you re not hungry  one taco will do. But if you re planning for a filling lunch  at the very least  get one of the four dollars  larger  and one of the regular tacos  smaller .  As for service  it was fantastic  Consistently attentive from the time I told the cashier I was a first timer through to the time I got my food. The person carrying it out was cordial in asking me if there was anything else he could get for me before heading back in. You d be surprised how a lot of people mess that part up by not completely carrying through with the whole eye contact  it s-no-rush  I m-here-at-your-service demeanor.
Torchy's Tacos,240,Torchy s was amazing. Whether you re an Austin local or visiting from out of town  Torchy s is a place you definitely need to try.  I was visiting from Eastern Washington and tried three different tacos. From what I remember  they were all delicious  with the spicy one being.... Quite spicy   It s great food at a fair price. Do yourself a favor and give Torchy s a try.
Torchy's Tacos,241,Giving the bfast tacos 3 stars because they were absolutely not the best.  The taste was fine for one combination I asked for but it wasn t cooked like I requested and the might taco was a joke.  The migas taco had tortilla chips thrown in not mixed in. Where did they learn to make tacos   Lunch was much better.
Torchy's Tacos,242,I came here with my family of 6 one afternoon on a weekend. There wasn t much of a rush and we ordered a bunch of tacos that I can t remember the names of but the ones to remember were the fried avocado taco and the queso that comes with the nachos. It was soo good our family gobbled it right up and even considered getting a second one. However  we already had so many tacos coming in that we didn t do it. The meat was only so-so in the tacos so I guess the meat tacos weren t great. The vegetarian ones were better and I like flour tacos instead of corn so I got them all to be flour.
Torchy's Tacos,243,I am giving them a 5 just for the margaritas that Skyler  makes. They are some of the best that I have ever had. You have to come if nothing else just for the margs    Torchy s on the other hand is probably a 3 to 3 1 2. Nothing overly special about their tacos. They seem to skimp a bit on ingredients.  The flavors are good but someone is valuing profit over customer satisfaction. It didn t used to be that way here.   That was my review from months ago that never posted. The service at the counter just now sucked.  It is no good to get attitude when you point out that you were here waiting way before the walk up window and the cashier gives you a ration of s  t. That guy does not belong  working with people. He dropped my review 3 points.
Torchy's Tacos,244,Everyone had been saying Torchy s is the best  so of course I had to see for myself.  I must say  everyone was RIGHT     There really isn t much else to order but taco s and that s ok.  If you are going to specialize in something  then be the best at it   This is exactly were Torchy s wins.  We ordered a  Democrat    Chicken Fajita   and  Green Chile Pork  tacos...ALL WERE EXCELLENT   Ingredients are all fresh  the tortilla chips and salsa were outstanding  and the server just kept bringing us unlimited chips  which was super cool.    This place is ALWAYS packed...and for good reason.  So don t expect to run in and run out.  It s a very casual atmosphere with tons of high-school and college students as the main demographic.  Good food always wins.  Keep being awesome  Torchy 
Torchy's Tacos,245,This place is fucking ridiculous. The line is always practically out the door  they have 1 cashier working  and the cashier is taking all these to go and online order  leaving all the people in line to eat in waiting. This has happened almost every time I ve been here. Seriously torchys hire more fucking people and have more cashiers
Torchy's Tacos,246,This was my favorite college breakfast spot. Yup  tacos for breakfast   The migas taco is perfection and comes with a buttery slice of avocado  pico  and salsa.  You can also add just about anything your heart desires to even the regular tacos. I ve added egg to a democrat and green chili pork tacos. The eggs in the breakfast tacos are also perfectly fluffy.   For dinner  I highly recommend the Baja Shrimp. They also have a taco of the month  in which case my favorite is the Holy Diver  which comes with ancho grilled shrimp  cabbage slaw  pickled onions and mango salsa.  I m salivating thinking about how damn good these tacos are.
Torchy's Tacos,247,Nope  nope  nope  I am not a fan of Torchy s and I ve tried. I want to be like all the cool kids and like it  but nope  it s not possible. The steak meat is always tough  the flavors don t mesh well. The queso wasn t anything special and service is lacking. There are MANY taco places in Austin and I d rather visit one of those  than Torchy s. This is a tourist college attraction. Not my kind of taco joint.
Torchy's Tacos,248,Good authentic food with combos I ve never tried before. Even though it s a Mexican restaurant  their menu comes with a multicultural twist. E.G. Trailer Park Tacos. Slow service when busy.
Torchy's Tacos,249,Over hyped taco place. Its more of a place for people to take pictures than it is a serious taco place.  The tacos aren t all that great and the line was long.
Torchy's Tacos,250,These are some amazing tacos    Service  The service was on point. The employee who took our orders was very helpful. I had many questions about the queso and the salsa and he didn t miss a beat. I ordered the hottest salsa you can order there and the man who ran my food out warned me that it was really hot and if I couldn t handle it he would bring me out a milder one. The service was great.   Food  I had the Democrat and the beef fajita taco and they were both so delicious and filling. I especially loved the beef fajita taco. My friend ordered the chips and queso and it was alright to me but I m very picky about my queso. I also enjoyed the chips and salsa. I ordered it with diablo sauce and it was really really spicy but well worth it. I highly recommend this place  The tacos are amazing 
Torchy's Tacos,251,I absolutely loved the SCALLYWAG  which was taco of the month when I went. The battered shrimp had a mild hint of coconut taste to it combined with pickled onions  which gave it this sweet  savory and sour taste that was a delicious combination   I m giving it four stars because someone recommended the fried avocado taco  which I found too fatty with the batter and not that flavorful. Would have been a while 5 stars if I just stuck with the scallywag    Also  the guacamole had chunks of avocado in it so that was pretty good too. Overall  this is a top taco place for me    
Torchy's Tacos,252,The best Mexican food in Texas is located at this humble taco place. Food was fresh and blends several textures along with flavors to delight the palate. The chips and salsa were awesome. Prices reasonable for the area and quality service combine to make this a top notch eatery  for visitors and regular patrons.
Torchy's Tacos,253,Before anything else  just know 4 tacos are too many. I didn t know this coming in. And got a  good luck  when my waitress set them down in front of me.  I really liked the fried avocado taco. Even though there s no meat in it  if you re an avocado afficionado  you will love this.  The portobello taco was also tasty and full of umami.  Had other tacos which were also good  but can t remember much of the details about them.
Torchy's Tacos,254,If I could leave ZERO stars... I would. We came into this Torchy s on Thursday evening  8 24 18 . We ordered 2 orders of Chips and Queso... and about 10 tacos. The cashier was not very helpful and the tall amp  skinny female with glasses that gave us our food was rude and was a poor representation of your restaurant. When we FINALLY received our order after asking for our order after waiting around  for 20 minutes... the bag appeared to be smaller than we expected... and when we asked if everything was there she responded that everything was there  rolled her eyes   amp walked off. We were missing 1 order of chips and queso and a taco. When we told the girl with the glasses that we were missing a part of order... she looked at our receipt and gave us what we were missing.... the crossroads taco that I ordered... was SUPER greasy.... it was so greasy that it looked like the taco was dipped in pure oil.  I usually love Torchy s. The service and food are pretty consistent at the different locations that I ve visited in Houston and Austin.... with the exception of this location on Guadalupe. I can assure you that I won t go to this location... ever.... or will I ever recommend this location to anyone.
Torchy's Tacos,255,My family and I loved this location   Easy access parking.  The food is ofcourse awesomly delicious.  Customer service is GREAT.   I like the box window seats whenI am waiting for my togo orders   I enjoy trying the Taco s of the month.
Torchy's Tacos,256,Gets LOTS OF HYPE like Taco Deli  but there are only a couple of gems.   Reason to come to this  Austin s best  taco-truck-turned-brick amp mortar  1. BRUSHFIRE- what a combo   Jerk chicken with mango plus this killer sauce  It makes me cry...both in spicy-ness and in beauty. More than willing to cry tears of pepper spice to keep eating it. 2. QUESO- has that special kick that sets it aside from other places 3. FRIED AVOCADO- self-explanatory...  Marks against it   1. Parking...What the  You renovated the building  which I actually liked the hippie feel more   but you can t fix the one-way parking with no outlet  2. Food takes a long time to come out. Even if you only order 1 taco.  3. Most of the tacos are just aight....
Torchy's Tacos,257,Of lot of people will tell you Torchy s has the best tacos in Austin. That comes down to preference  but Torchy s tacos certainly are tasty  If you re looking for authentic tacos  Torchy s is not the place. They re more like gourmet fast food tacos. The combinations they offer are great. You ve got to at least try the Trailer Park  fried chicken  green chiles  lettuce  pico de gallo  and cheese on a flour tortilla with poblano sauce. My second favorite taco would be the Baja Shrimp  hand-battered fried shrimp with cooked cabbage slaw topped with pickled jalapenos  amp  onions  queso fresco  cilantro  amp  a wedge of lime  and served with chipotle sauce on your choice of tortilla. Go with the Brushfire  Jamaican jerk chicken  if you want really spicy. Also  don t forget the queso at Torchy s  Queso comes with guacamole  cilantro  and diablo hot sauce. It s so good 
Torchy's Tacos,258,Torchy s...please oh please come to San Antonio  I m still dreaming about these tacos  and it s been months.   I love that they offer vegetarian refried beans  thank you   and all of their tacos look amazing. The fried avocado is the bomb. And I know I ordered another one  but the fried avocado taco obviously overshadowed whatever else was on my plate. The queso is pretty damn good  too.  It s too bad Torchy s is so far away from me  but one day...I will return. That s a promise.
Torchy's Tacos,259,The queso is where it s at   I ordered 7 tacos between two people and had to take it home because they were so so so filling. Get the Trashy trailer park  you won t be disappointed. Get the Matador and that one  taco  will be the end of you 
Torchy's Tacos,260,Food was good. I tried the Mr.orange. the place could use better parking and my tacos were a bit cold. But I would come back here again because their food is delicious.
Torchy's Tacos,261,Great tacos  Very fast casual and food is great. Austin staple.
Torchy's Tacos,262,Food is always good. However the workers are sometimes super cranky. Was waiting for a pickup order and I didn t know I was supposed to wait in the same line as people ordering in. Instead of nicely correcting me the worker just kept going  ThErE is OnE LiNE  
Torchy's Tacos,263,I think I have a queso problem...  Came here Saturday late morning before ACL and we did not leave disappointed.  It was our first time here so we didn t know how much food to order.  We all ordered 2 breakfast tacos and then we also ordered two things of queso.  Between the 4 of us  it was a ridiculous amount of food but worth every last bite.  The queso comes with a large bowl of chips and is filled with jalapenos  guac and tomatoes.  So many flavors in every bite that come together for the perfect combination.    The breakfast tacos were all quite large and you have the option of flour or corn tortillas.  Torchy s is on the more expensive side of tacos but they have definitely earned their reputation and I m scared I will be back every weekend  Down side  parking sucks and the place gets real crowded on weekends.
Torchy's Tacos,264,Torchys is always very consistent  no matter the location or time. I do like this location more than say  the burnet location  due to the bar and the larger dining space.   My favorite thing Torchy s shells out is their queso. It contains guacamole  several seasonings  pico and the finishing touch- a drizzle of their Diablo hot sauce. Perfect amount of spice     Also highly recommend their Baja shrimp tacos  and the trailer park- as if the queso didn t clog your arteries enough. This taco spot isn t a place to get  clean  tacos  the trashier the better 
Torchy's Tacos,265,All I can say is yummy yummy yum      I love tacos  The service is great but a little slow order ahead if your hangry 
Torchy's Tacos,266,I m in love with Torchy s but this location never fails to get my order wrong. I ordered simple chips and queso w  no guacamole... i got a HALF order of chips and queso WITH guacamole. Find another location..
Torchy's Tacos,267,Torchy s consistently makes delicious tacos  so don t expect anything less at this location.  Note  Parking can be difficult  getting in and out of the parking lot can also be challenging and there will probably be a lot of people inside during school session.  Overall the same great tacos you expect from Torchy s.
Torchy's Tacos,268,Placed a pick up order  only to arrive and have them tell us they forgot to place it  so we had to wait 20  min for our food.
Torchy's Tacos,269,This was my first time in Austin and my first Torchy s Tacos. I was very pleased with this place as the food was fresh  we didn t wait a long time and were able to find seating pretty quickly. I had some taco that had fried avocado which was pretty awesome. The jerk chicken with mangoes was pretty good as well.  The crowd was non-stop the whole time we were there and we were visiting on a Sunday afternoon around 2 00 PM or so. It was pretty amazing to see such a consistent flow of customers.  Parking was tough  very limited. Based on the crowd it was pretty crowded getting in and out.  I would not hesitate visiting one of their other locations.
Torchy's Tacos,270,You know  I love Torchy s  but only at this location  the seating area across from the order pick-up  wreaks.   I ve been there twice and it still has that horrible smell. I will stick to the Soco location lol  Other than that  food is delicious as it always is.  I always order online. lol
Torchy's Tacos,271,This is a great Torchy s. Food is always solid. The employees aren t as customer oriented as they should be. They need to have a better system of pick up orders. Anytime I order for pick up I stand there for 10 minutes while the cashier is swamped with customers needing to order. It s super inconveient and they should consider making their pickup orders more seamless.
Torchy's Tacos,272,Big ass portions. I mean BIG.  We really dug the Monk Taco. We re talkin  eggs cooked to perfection. Potatoes galore. Bacon bacon bacon. And then green chiles and cheese. Dumped into a tortilla so large you can split it between two people.  Vibes. Hell yea. So quirky. Super chill and embodies that spirit of the original food truck.  Service is fast and they carry Maine Root sodas. Woot woot   Perhaps it won t fall into the blow-your-mind flavors department  it s still a institution worthy as a Sunday brunch option or night time 2nd dinner.
Torchy's Tacos,273,These tacos are no joke   I had the Green Chile Pork and the Independent which had fried portobello mushrooms in it.  The tacos were very large and I couldn t even finish them but boy were they delicious.  Nice atmosphere and a good selection of micro-brews.  Definitely a fun spot to hit up if you are in Austin.
Torchy's Tacos,274,I had 2 tacos the meat was poorly prepped all fat almost choked. The tortilla were just as tough  Not sure what has happened with there quality control  good luck.
Torchy's Tacos,275,A clear UT favorite since all you could see inside is Longhorn gear. Very reasonable prices  solid Tex-mex. I would highly recommend the mushrooms tacos  which were better than any of the meat items I tried. Enjoy 
Torchy's Tacos,276,The hype is real. I am a huge fan. 2nd time to Austin and I had no idea the wonders of breakfast tacos. See you soon torchys
Torchy's Tacos,277,Mack the bartender was the bomb dot com   His service was amazing  smiled a lot and a great sense of humor  Hire more people like Mack  Best tacos in Austin  hands down  Consistently good all the time  
Torchy's Tacos,278,Read the menu while you re in line  order  pick up your number and wait patiently for your food at the table while the server brings some tortilla chips.  The service is quick  easy and no tips are involved.  The place is chill and they also have a bar.    Make sure you get the green chile queso dip with chips.  It s cheesy  gooey  spicy and unique.  My friends and I cleaned it all up because it was so good.  You can also get more chips if you have more dip left.  It seems like it s endless baskets of chips here.  You can pretty much get full off that if you want.    The tacos all sound delicious with authentic flavors.  I had the Democrat and it was great.  The grease of the beef was dripping everywhere and ripped the tortilla so there s another tortilla to prevent the entire taco from falling apart.  It s pretty small  but filling.  I finished it in a few bites and I don t regret every greasy bite.
Torchy's Tacos,279,Being new to Austin I was told that I have to try Torchy s. Thankfully I got the chance to experience this place in all its glory during my first 2 weeks of living here. I was so overwhelmed with the selections so I went on recommendations without a second thought. The Dirty Sanchez and Fried Avocado are now near and dear to my heart but I am eventually going to work my way through all the offerings.  The service was great  the wait time was a non factor  and the food was hot and delicious. I can honestly say that I find myself coming here time and time again. Not that I was a non-taco fan before moving here but I can say that I am a major fan these days. I definitely recommend this place to friends  family  and any one visiting Austin.
Torchy's Tacos,280,Cheers to this location for getting so popular they had to double in physical size  amp  add a bar. Hadn t been here in a few months but remember the line typically being 10-15 minutes long  amp  today appeared to be no exception.  This time grabbed a seat at the bar  amp  inquired about ordering options.  Yeah we do full service  I m told so I order a pint  amp  2 tacos. My food arrived quicker than it would have taken just to stand in line. The Hipster  without bacon  was quite divine  amp  got me properly stuffed so had to take the Indie to go.  Seems this may be the new local go-to location moving forward but certainly others will continue to grace our Texan landscape as their popularity spreads.   Viva el Torchy 
Torchy's Tacos,281,I am a loyal Torchys customer  I love their tacos  and their queso is the best I ve ever had. But I went on a Friday night  and I waited in line 20-25 minutes. When I finally got to the register to order  the cashier told me I could not order food for 30-40 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous. I told him they should have had an employee announce that to the line and he made up some excuse. Torchys food is always good  the service at this location is ridiculously bad.
Torchy's Tacos,282,I hadn t gotten to explore too much of the different taco places in Austin  but it quickly became a favorite of mine. I definitely suggest coming through here if you have the craving for some tacos. On the low the tacos are kind of expensive  running anywhere between 2.50 to 4.00  but after two you will be satisfied  three would be pushing it. Their menu boasts an array of crafted tacos that are really all splendid. I haven t found something on their menu I didn t like and I have been a few times now. I definitely suggest getting the Democrat or the Independent name   for dinner and for breakfast you can t go wrong with a monk.  The ambience is definitely not a sit down  fine dining  experience  but it is a nice place to chill and hang out with friends. I would recommend going in off peak hours though because I could definitely see the place getting packed on big days.
Torchy's Tacos,283,The food was pretty amazing and the ambience is laid back. I absolutely enjoyed my food and service.
Torchy's Tacos,284,I think that this place has a lot of different options for tacos but I don t like many of them I only order the chicken fajita tacos and beef fajita tacos but I take like 1 thing off and I m not a picky eater. I like the tacos a lot I think I just have to try more but the queso is the best queso I have ever eaten. NO CAP. period.
Torchy's Tacos,285,Can t go wrong with Torchy s. Tacos and queso were both amazing. Bartender was great in recommending beer  4 fireman . Lives up to their saying. Torchy s is  damn good 
Torchy's Tacos,286,Ordered the fried  avocado taco and also the independence taco  not too many veg taco varieties  Absolutely loved the independence taco  tasted great. Can t wait to come back.   The fried avocado Taco was not so great  will not order it again
Torchy's Tacos,287,I took a long walk to get here  through the university  but it was around July 4th so there weren t many people around. The place is conveniently located if you re coming by car  and it s got an interesting feel where you go to the counter to order but they bring it out to you. There s ample seating and a huge menu with a ton of things you could order. We got the regular nachos with salsa to start  but then sprung for the queso. Man  it was good and you have to try it  We also got a bunch of tacos including the fried avocado one  pork  carne asada  an a bunch of others that I can t remember. The vegetarian tacos tasted best  and I understand why vegetarian people recommended it to me. If there was one taco that I wouldn t leave without  it d be the fried avocado taco. I hope you guys like the place as much as I did 
Torchy's Tacos,288,Yum.  These tacos were actually pretty good.  We were around the UT area  and found this place pretty close by.   Ordered an avocado taco and some queso.  Man oh man  loved them both   Reasonably priced  queso was a little more expensive than I was expecting   but the food was great tasting. Not too busy.  Would have loved this place as a student  or somewhere near my office   
Torchy's Tacos,289,Don t go here if you re an adult. It s run by children who take 40 minutes to get you a taco that s been sitting under a heat lamp for 30 minutes.  Seriously  over 21 you ll want to shoot yourself
Torchy's Tacos,290,This place is seriously damn good   Great service  the food comes out quick and everything is delicious. Got the Fried Avocado taco and The Matador  beef brisket  avocado  pickled jalape os in a soft AND hard shell . The different flavors in each Taco is seriously magic. The bar is also a great touch   Tip  Make sure you ask for the secret menu
Torchy's Tacos,291,1 star for the franchise as the food is always great.  0 stars for this locations service quality and speed. 20  minutes on a dead Monday for food while everyone else gets their food  The proper thing to do besides saying  it s coming out  and not make excuses while I wait longer.   As for the manager  since I m waiting for 20  minutes and I address you regarding it  at least offer some sort of compensation for customers in this situation as the cost for you is 10 cents and the reward is a repeat customer.  Edit  the food was cold also  thanks for making excuses simply because you forgot an order. The honest truth would ve been better.
Torchy's Tacos,292,Frequent visits to this Torchy s has shown me that 9 10 times your order is going to get to you incorrectly.   The people making the taco are going to make it how it comes on the menu and if you ask for anything special you re likely going to have to send it back to be remade. Occasionally  like tonight - you ll have to send it back twice  after waiting 30 minutes for your food   Yet  once you get your food you re starving so it tastes amazing.
Torchy's Tacos,293,Food was.....edible. I m fairly certain there was no alcohol in my slushy of a margarita... And we sat and waited for almost 30 minutes before our food arrived. We went in with an hour and a half before we were scheduled to be at the escape game  figured that s enough time to eat. We were wrong. It wasn t even busy so I don t understand why it took so long. The fried avacado taco was decent. The tortillas were just dry and flavorless
Torchy's Tacos,294,One thing that may get overlooked at this place is the Green Chile Queso with chips. This and Kerbey Queso over at Kerbey Lane are probably my 2 favorite quesos in town with this one being a little higher up on the scale for me. The chips are addicting and good even by themselves without dip. I HAVE to get the Green Chile Queso every time I come here now.  As for the tacos  they re good but I still prefer the legit Mexican tacos you get at the restaurants where let s just say Spanish is the predominant language. But my go-to tacos here would be the Baja Shrimp  the Democrat  and the Crossroads. Compared to mexican tacos  these are on the pricier side  but what do you expect for  crafted  tacos.
Torchy's Tacos,295,We have been to Torchy s repeatedly on our visits to Austin  We d seen it on TV and heard great things from friends who d been before.  Food  Delicious  SO many tacos to choose from and options like flour or corn tortillas. My favorite have been the breakfast versions as well as the Baja shrimp taco  My husband loves the Trailer Park one with fried chicken of course     Service  always friendly  Atmosphere  there are multiple locations and the ones we ve been to have been very  Austin  they also sell local goods and snacks which is always an added bonus.
Torchy's Tacos,296,This was my first time at Torchy s and it was an awful experience. I was on my way to the Texas Tribune Festival. On my bike and decided that I should have something to eat. I thought a breakfast taco would be a quick and portable meal I could enjoy while listing to our senators. Boy was I wrong. I ordered standard fare tacos from the menu board to go. I waited 15 min for my order  during this interval only one waiting Customer was served  so this issue wasn t particular to me. I told the cashier  while in the presence of manager I was tired of waiting and wanted a refund. There was no effort to extend customer service. In fact the comments from the cashier indicated the order had not even been started.  The cashier never gave me a receipt and when I asked for one  she could not produce.   Torchy s addresses service and process failure with ambivalence.   I recommend going across the street if you want to experience appreciation with your meal.
Torchy's Tacos,297,Flavors are good but a little on the salty side. Meat was cold and take to long to bring the food even when then place was not full.
Torchy's Tacos,298,The helpings are huge here. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. We visited here while in town from Indiana. It was amazing and hit my spicy spot 
Torchy's Tacos,299,I was surprised to receive such large tacos because the other locations I had been to had much smaller tacos. Granted  this location is a quarter or two more expensive per taco than another location near my home. Overall great food and friendly staff.
Torchy's Tacos,300,I was originally hesitant to try it  but literally every website said you had to visit a Torchy s while in Texas. Parking was a little difficult as it s right on the side of a main road  but the location itself is good and near a strip of shops. The tacos are fantastic - highly recommend trying the Diablo sauce on anything you get if you like heat. It s amazing  quality meat for a cheap price and one taco alone is enough to fill you up. Definitely give it a try 
Torchy's Tacos,301,A place you must check out if you re visiting Austin  They have the best queso and a lot of fun tacos. I personally don t really enjoy paying  4 for a taco but the food is totally worth it 
Torchy's Tacos,302,Yo  Give me some Torchy s I just want some more please  Get me salsa and Monk Special damn this stuff is on  nother level  Unlike some reviews  I actually had a good experience at Torchy s for breakfast. I ordered the Monk Special and The Wrangler with some salsa and let me tell you  these are some BOMB.COM Tacos.   Overall  breakfast taco lovers unite because this place has great breakfast tacos and you can get different varying degrees of hot sauces to accommodate your taste buds. If I had to compare it to places like Fuzzy s  Torchy s would stomp the competition. Just come try it and they do have happy hour.  Parking can be an issue but if you focus just on the food and the price  I think you ll leave very happy and full at the right price. Def coming back to try the tacos and they look and taste good with all the fancy presentation.  EDIT  I ve come to realize not all torchys taste the same. I dont know what it is but I know Im not gettin that old. This ones good  but just something to keep in mind
Torchy's Tacos,303,Great tacos  but they re a bit overrated. I usually make a stop when in Austin for work  but they re not the best tacos I ve had. They have hit and misses. They have a good selection for vegetarian pescatarian which is nice. I love the tuna tacos..the salmon was disappointing.
Torchy's Tacos,304,Clever  inventive tacos with really unique and tasty combos of ingredients. The bourbon bacon jam that came with one of my tacos was amazing. Can t wait to go back and try others. Very helpful young lady at the register patiently answered all of my first-timer questions. Park on the side  not the front.
Torchy's Tacos,305,I was really impressed with this. By the looks of it and the number of locations I expected it to be Tex-mex style tacos  not a fan   but they turned out to be very authentic. It s a definite must-try in Austin.
Torchy's Tacos,306,The Democrat  Green Chile Pork  and Hillbilly Queso all came hand-delivered to my table within a whopping 12-minutes  These mouth watering tacos were served with lime wedges and tomatillo salsa and were true perfection. The tender pork carnitas I sank my teeth into make me confident that on my first visit to Austin  Texas I had some of the best tacos in the nation  Go to Torchy s. You will not be disappointed.
Torchy's Tacos,307,As soon as you walk in the restaurant  the smell of fresh tacos hits you like a ton of bricks. The atmosphere is full but casual  the decor and lighting giving it a slightly classier feel than other locations. Music is quiet rock n  roll. I ordered some chips  two breakfast tacos  and some Li l Nookies  Torchy s fried cookie dough balls for under ten dollars. They were served within a few minutes. The tacos  despite my unimaginative choice  were very flavorful and attractive  with a buttery yellow color. They were very generous with the bacon. It also came with some really tasty salsa.  The Li l Nookies is served in a small bowl topped with powdered sugar and maraschino cherries. The fried cookie dough balls are covered in shredded coconut  giving it a satisfying crunch. On the inside  they are sweet and buttery  but a little too grainy.  The service is friendly  and when I asked for a refill of chips  it came almost immediately. All in all  Torchy s is a great place to get tacos.
Torchy's Tacos,308,I have mixed feelings about Torchys and I really dont know who to blame. I dont knw whether to blame the Favor app employee for delivering me cold  mushy  sloppy tacos or to blame Torchy s for not being able to provide the delivery guy with adequate heating storage containers. Either way  my brother rants about this place so Im willing to give it a try but apparently my brother says we will need to go in person and order everything fresh. For what its worth the Green Chili Queso was good.
Torchy's Tacos,309,Mmmm Austin    These are some of the best tacos I have had. We started out with an order of the chips and bowl of queso. Coming from Albuquerque I was really impressed with the flavor of this queso  very delicious. I ordered the trailer park taco which consists of deliciously battered and fried Chicken strips. Real green chile  pico  cheese and a semi spicy poblano sauce. You can also order this delicious taco  trashy  which they smoother the taco in their house made queso. I also order the fried avocado taco. The flavors are similar to the trailer park just substitute the chicken for deep fried avocado. The atmosphere is pretty laid back. If your thirsty grab one of their local brews on tap. Overall this place is some of the best tacos I have had. I will definitely make this place a regular visit anytime I am in town.
Torchy's Tacos,310,It s torchy s. Get the queso and street corn. Also their margs are delicious  not the strongest but great flavor.
Torchy's Tacos,311,Definitely not the best tacos in town.  Not sure what all the hype is about.
Torchy's Tacos,312,Who doesn t love Torchy s  Always nice to stop into this location on the drag for lunch  while parking isn t ideal the service is always fast and the food is always good. I always go for the trailer park and the Baja shrimp taco  so yummy  Their green salsa  tastes like the poblano sauce  was described as hot but was more sweet with a lot of pepper. But chips and salsa are always a go to when we come here  The location is always clean and I love the atmosphere.
Torchy's Tacos,313,We got an order of nearly  7 queso that s supposed to be 8 fl. oz in a pan  and they gave us max maybe 5-6 fl. oz in a to go cup  their dishwasher broken . They said they couldn t give us more. Then we had to wait over twenty minutes  this restaurant not even busy  and ask three different times to even get some more chips to finish the queso. We saw other tables get their food  eat  and leave by the time we got some chips. Crazy.
Torchy's Tacos,314,The tacos are creative  amp  delicious.  The prices are good.  The location is walkable.  We love Torchy s.
Torchy's Tacos,315,I do not lightly use the expression  party in my face   but this place was a raging debauch. I think I tried at least 6 different tacos and every one was big and interesting and different. The smoked beef brisket was crispy and rich and not too smoky. The pulled pork was tender and juicy. The sauces were creative  and almost perfect  aside from being a bit sweet at times.   But let s talk queso  Shut Up And Take My Money. Big  warm  smooth  perfectly spicy and cheesey. Stellar chips. Unf. I want to fly back to Austin right now just thinking about it.
Torchy's Tacos,316,If you spend even a short amount of time in Austin  the Torchy s name will become familiar to you. Not all will say their tacos are hands-down the best in Austin  but for what little they lack in taste they easily make up for in price  accessibility  and consistency. This location in particular has fantastic service  and is quick to get your order done and get it done right. Do yourself a favor and give it a try - they ve got options for pretty much everybody.
Torchy's Tacos,317, noconcern   While Torchy s Tacos is of course on par with all the other great tacos in this taco loving town  the staff  especially those stationed at the bar  ruined everything. Their attendance and attention to detail at the bar was poor at best. My friend and I sat at the bar through 3 sea changes of sorostitutes while we begged the attention of either of the bar tenders. It wasn t until my buddy shouted   HEY   that they took note of our existence. Even when our order was placed  it took an additional 10 minutes for it to be served  since they was no obvious collaboration or communication between the 2 working bartenders. This ultimately resulted in the consumption of cold queso y mushy tacos upon our return to the table.   wheresmycopy  Cut to closing out the bill  same scenario different sorostitues. Once again  I was over looked multiple times to close out my bill. Upon receiving my closed out tab  I was left ultimately with only one copy  hence said  .   This review was meant to explain said hashtags that were written on the signed check.  And to suggest a  Come to Jesus  talk with such bartenders on customer service.    P.S. who makes chicken and waffle TACOS   go get yourself some damn chicken and waffles   24diner   if that s what you want  travesty I tell you  TRAVESTY 
Torchy's Tacos,318,Killer good tacos  ate 2 and was full  had to try bites of all my friends and that pushed me overboard.   You can t go wrong here  even the veggie taco was awesome which is not something that ever happens back home in DC.  Service was quick  the long line felt daunting but blew through in no time.  Service was also friendly and came with good advice. Clean joint too   Without blabbing about an exact taco   all good  what made this stand out was the detail of seasonings and extras.  These tacos are not just about the large items going into them  chicken  pork etc .  All the ingredients serve a good purpose and come together with seasoning and condiments to make a unique and delicious taco versus some all a carte taco fixings thrown into a taco shell.   Austin does tacos well and these seem to be among the best.
Torchy's Tacos,319,Oh  Torchy s  it s so good to have you close again   Oh  and the hip new makeover   Lookin good  honey    Got my usual Queso and it made sweet lovin to my mouth  as always.   Me  amp  Torychy s  We got a thang goin on.
Torchy's Tacos,320,This is a nice location. It s quite busy since it s so close to UT. I haven t been in since the new renovations  but it looks like there might be more seating now. There may be trouble finding parking since it s located in such a high traffic area. However  I think there is additional parking just a few blocks back near 30th street.
Torchy's Tacos,321,Edit  Plus one star for going  outdoor  pet-friendly   This location went downhill a bit when they expanded into the neighboring restaurant. Parking is impossible - welcome to Austin. The entrance door plops you into the middle of the line  if more than 3 or 4 people are waiting  as is usually the case. People can t really move to let others in and out because of a concrete wall that makes no sense at all. Once you make it to a seat  you ll realize you should have brought a jacket and a pillow. Half of the seats are plywood and the a c leaves me frigid. Lights are bright and I don t think there s a strip of sound absorbing material anywhere in the building that isn t being worn by a human. This isn t a place you can relax. Maybe they meant it that way. Eat and run  but don t get your food to go. To-go orders come crushed and at least seemingly smaller.  Original taco creations that set themselves apart from the bajillions of other tacos in Austin are a rare find. Torchy s tacos are exactly that. They re creative and pretty delicious. The chips and salsa queso guacamole are also pretty great as fast food goes. Giving me control of my own salsa via a salsa bar would be awesome  but settling for what they give you isn t so bad. The only place they really skimp on ingredient quality is their generic  dry flour tortillas. The food is otherwise solid.  I was a regular here for a couple of years  but it s off my list these days. I was less and less impressed  until the day I came in with my dog to sit outside and got the boot. Anti-dog businesses take themselves down a notch in my book.
Torchy's Tacos,322,Torchy s has great food but this location consistently drops the ball when it comes to take out. I ordered their taco if the month  a fried chicken and waffle taco  got back to my apartment  and found that they hadn t given me the waffle  I d love nothing more than to call and ask them to fix my order  but their phone line is down. Very frustrating  I would recommend driving a little further off campus for better service.
Torchy's Tacos,323,Yet another good taco chain in Austin. Each taco was packed with meat and very good. The Trailer Park taco features chicken and chiles and can be ordered  trashy  style - topped with queso.
Torchy's Tacos,324,Big  delicious tacos with some unique combinations at reasonable prices.
Torchy's Tacos,325,Pretty good tacos.  Have plenty of vegetarian options too 
Torchy's Tacos,326,I love Torchy s Tacos  This is my first time coming to the one in Austin but I ve been to the ones in Houston several times  Their concept and company culture is super laid back. Their decor is hipster  with a little bit of weird  Their slogan is  damn good  and they truly live up to it  My favorite taco is the trailer park  fried chicken  green chile  lettuce  and pico de gallo with poblano sauce. You can make it  trashy  by replacing the lettuce with cheese.   The Democrat is also delicious  it has barbacoa shredded beef   Lastly  my other favorite item on the menu are the little nookies  fried chocolate chip cookies dipped with powdered sugar and cherries on top - yummy   A must have while in Austin 
Torchy's Tacos,327,Went for lunch. Line was long but they are quick and friendly. Good variety of tacos but a bit on the pricy side for what it is. Useful tip - get the breakfast tacos - same amount of food half the cost. Guacamole could use some help  pretty plain. If it was a bit cheaper and the guacamole was better this would be 4 stars.
Torchy's Tacos,328,Since I moved to Austin  everyone has been telling me to try this place. I was hesitant because I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food  I was raised in Mexico .  The taco combos are crazy and have a good variety but no matter how many crazy combos they make up if the tortillas are not good the tacos are not good.  An authentic tortilla is what makes up a good taco. Those tortillas tasted nasty. The chips and salsa were ok.    Please change your tortillas and you would have some good tacos 
Torchy's Tacos,329,Food was good  the cleanliness was awful  they have no employees cleaning  food and trash on the floor  tables dirty. They can do better than that... 
Torchy's Tacos,330,Awesome taco s  queso  salsa  and even the chips. Everything is fresh-made. Cool set-up  walk in  brief line  order  grab drinks  find a table  devour queso  food delivered. That was easy.  Austin is full of taco trucks  amp  Tex-Mex restaurants  and we tried several  Guero s  Matt s Famous  a non-descript taco-truck recommended to us by a local  and Torchy s  and the queso salsa taco triple play here is amazing. The  Bob  at Matt s was good. But Torchy s was the best. Wow  Good stuff going on here. Please  come open up a few in Florida.
Torchy's Tacos,331,I was expecting an authentic taste but not impressed. I had the fried avocado taco and the trailer chicken between eighter I would go for the chicken. Chips and queso are ok rather just not consume the calories.
Torchy's Tacos,332,Seriously  what s all the hype about  totally disappointed   Came here b c of a recommendation from a drop dead gorgeous 18 yr old boy I met on the plane. yeah yeah  there s a fad going around for cougar-ing. Tacos were good but nothing amazing  Cali girl here have been spoiled w  good tacos. Prices   3- 4 for a mid size taco - a bit of a rip off.  2 for a small soda - total rip off.   What s up w  the long lines  once again  a hype amongst the locals. Parking is difficult and be prepared to wait at least 10min for your food.
Torchy's Tacos,333,Went here with my family when I was visiting Austin. Really good tacos  Got the Brushfire and The Independent. Both were delicious. Their tacos are really creative  and I can t wait to come back at try more. It s a hot spot here and a must go when you re traveling here 
Torchy's Tacos,334,The taco of the month  July  is the   Damn BP   and I tell ya it s damn good.  Achiote grilled shrimp  cooked cabbage slaw  pickled onions  jalapenos  mango  queso fresco  cilantro  and jalapeno tartar sauce.  And no tar balls in sight.    Not to mention   1 from every  Damn BP  taco benefits the fisherman in the Gulf   I think that s a damn win-win  don t you   BP should be buying these up by the tanker-load as an additional avenue of assistance.  I also got the fried avocado - - it s good  but I still think Izzoz takes the cake.    I like their hot sauce - they sell it in a bottle now.  The A C doesn t work here  so it s not really a comfortable place to cool down and enjoy your meal  but you can always hang out in the back by the bathroom - - it s really cool back there.  I spent like 10 minutes back there - they thought I was an employee.  Yay     Like I said - that  Damn BP  taco rocks  
Torchy's Tacos,335,This is my second time to torchy s taco. I ordered the fried avocado and the independent. The former was quite good  but the latter was not. The sauce and some ingredients in the it were very sour  which made the whole taco tastes weird.
Torchy's Tacos,336,The tacos are ok  but overpriced. With so many amazing taco trucks run by individuals and families all over town  I find the trendy corporatization of tacos a little cringeworthy
Torchy's Tacos,337,Very good tacos de puerco in green chili sauce. The tortillas taste store bought. It would be awesome having them home made too.
Torchy's Tacos,338,I really like this place. No really  I really really really like this place. This is one awesome taco shop that will serve up a taco the size of your hand  read not authentic  but loaded with amazing flavors you will not find anywhere else. Paired with crazy names and funny phrases  how can you not love this place   Torchy s is strictly speaking a taco spot where you will find tacos with all kinds of meaty ingredients and even vegetarian ingredients all wrapped up in two warm  fresh over sized corn tortillas dripping with flavor and sauce. You can also get extra salsa on it yourself if you eat in or get it to go. They even have breakfast tacos  How killer is that   The tacos are pretty reasonably priced for the size that you get and you will be full after 2  so don t get 3 like me. Greed is my enemy ... but come to Torchys 
Torchy's Tacos,339,Service is pretty slow. Even when it s not busy  it takes 30-45 minutes for your food to be ready. Smh.
Torchy's Tacos,340,I was pleasantly surprised how quick the food comes out here.  The Torchys in Tbe Woodlands is SLOW      We got the Trashy Trailer Park.  And the beef fajita tacos.  Both great.
Torchy's Tacos,341,This is a pretty good place  We came for happy hour and got swirl margaritas that were pretty strong. I got a  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fmr.pink amp s 0496d304168a0917fd0d0e1038a30b58144e4d8e1a0bf006ab7709fd2843a241  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  mr.pink  a  and a democrat for my tacos that were pretty good. If you re looking for authentic Mexican tacos  this isn t the place. The queso was alright but I didn t care for the sauce on top. Honestly  1 taco and half of a queso would have been more than enough for each of us. We took most of our meal to-go. It s very similar to velvet taco to anyone who is a Dallas native. The staff is really friendly and willing to help if you have any questions or concerns. Overall  good experience  We ll be back for that happy hour 
Torchy's Tacos,342,I posted a Facebook status that was something to the effect of  OMG I M IN AUSTIN  THAT S IN TEXAS  OMG I M IN TEXAS   and one of my homies was like  OMG YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO try the deep fried avocado tacos at Torchy s Tacos  YOU HAVE TO    This is a lady who KNOWS HER some delicious treats so my homie and I said HELLS BELLS  BRING ON THE DEEP FRIED FAT   So I ll tell you that the deep fried avocados were tasty. I d probably go sans beans if I were to order them again  but really  they were damn fine.  And I ll also tell you that the white trash taco or trailer trash taco or whatever the hell it was  AKA CHICKEN FRIED STEAK TACO  was also very good but...and it pains me to say this...might have been better without the bacon.   I KNOW. HORRIFYING.    But the bacon made me taste bacon and not the chicken fried steak and gravy. On my taco. OMG.   The thing I d order 100 of the next time I m in town   The Democrat.  I ve never  ever  ever had tastier barbacoa. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  But okay  the tacos were good. Easily worthy of a four star rating. The fifth star is because we ordered a few deep fried chocolate chip cookies and DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY DEEP FRY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES    UM  they don t actually bake the cookies first.  Meaning  the  deep fried chocolate chip cookies  are actually heavenly little balls of...  are you ready   COOKIE DOUGH   Holy hell...if I m gonna clog my arteries  deep fried cookie dough is the way to go.   Amen  Torchy s.
Torchy's Tacos,343,As far as Tex Mex goes  I have yet to find anything better in Austin.  The Democrat is the bomb.  My experience of barbacoa prior to torchy s was chipotle and this was an eye opener.  I was really sad when I finished my taco cause there was no more of that marvelously flavored meat.  The fried avocado is my other favorite here  something I would suggest to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.  The queso is downright devastating too.  It has a little kick  some guac  velvety texture.  you can easily share with friends if you get a larger tub.    If you re tight on money  the breakfast tacos are only  2 each and are still high on flavor while relatively cheap.  This place is always busy  so its often times hard to grab a spot in the limited seating.  If you see a spot  grab it ASAP.
Torchy's Tacos,344,Got a democrat and a republican taco. Quite good  And the price is very reasonable too 
Torchy's Tacos,345,I don t know why in the world you would name any type of food a  Dirty Sanchez   but it changed my life. It was SO GOOD.  My group  amp  I also tried the potato  egg   amp  cheese  the fried avocado   amp  the democrat.  All were good  the potato  egg   amp  cheese was the least favorite--kind of boring next to everything else .  They are very filling.  A taco  amp  a half stuffed me  and I can usually put it away pretty well.  The staff was friendly  amp  helpful  but it is a busy location  so you should probably be prepared to order when you get to the register.    I wish they would open one in Chicago   We have lots of taco joints  but this is very different  and I really appreciate that.
Torchy's Tacos,346,Their queso is very good. The food is very tasty. I like all their different breakfast tacos.This is a great location for a college campus.
Torchy's Tacos,347,I ordered a brushfire at this location. I took two bites and felt it tasted weird. I decided to open my taco and found several pieces of uncooked chicken. The manager was nice and refunded my money. However  I m probably never going to eat there again.  It s incredibly hard to forgive food poisoning.  Like others mentioned  the line is always long. I feel the staff struggles to meet the demands of the restaurant. Parking is a nightmare but that s to be expected with any downtown location.
Torchy's Tacos,348,Objectively  the tacos are unique and have this cool messy look to them that contributes to the torchy s vibe. Besides the fact that it has recently become popular and a must go to hot spot  there s nothing really all that special that I find about Torchy s.  My first taco was the democrat on flour and it was short of the hype everyone was giving it. I was comparing it to authentic Mexican tacos and maybe that s where I am failing to objectively judge it. However  they do have amazing salsas to go with the tacos and there s a different salsa pairing with each type of taco. I would recommend the creamy salsas with almost any taco on the menu.  The wait is on the long side  maybe 30-45 minutes from entrance to getting tacos but it is definitely something I still get from time to time with friends.
Torchy's Tacos,349,Well color me pickled onions    I only had a few  must eats  on my list during my weekend in Austin and Torchy s was one of them. My first attempt was foiled since the location on 6th is no longer there  if it s a truck can you really consider it a location  . Since I was only in Austin a short time I went to the website so I wouldn t make another mistake like that on my quest for Torchy s.   My second attempt to get Torchy s didn t happen without a major hiccup. I got in line  placed my order and went for my wallet  uh oh... Yep  I left my wallet at my friend s house so I asked the cashier to set the ticket aside and I d be back when I had some cashola. When I finally got my wallet the line was to the door  but the wait was well worth it.   I got 2 Baja Shrimp tacos and they were excellent. I wasn t sure about the pickled onions  but decided I could pick them off if need be. No worries pickled onions   good stuff  I would definitely come back here.   I was a little disappointed there weren t more veggie options. I m not a big avocado fan so steered clear of the fried avocado taco.  Bottom line  Good stuff and reasonable prices. Keep in mind it s called Torchy s Taco s for a reason - they have one burrito on the menu  but that s it  don t go looking for an enchilada  nachos  etc.
Torchy's Tacos,350,Great service and obviously quality ingredients.  I totally get that and I completely understand why Torchy s has raving fans.  I know I m committing Austin sacrilege by saying this  but I just don t  get  Torchy s.  The tendency to throw the kitchen sink of ingredients at every taco as well as the pricey nature of a Torchy s lunch just distract me from my continued love of old school Tex-Mex.  It s not you Torchy s.  It s me.   Really.  We can still be friends.
Torchy's Tacos,351,This location is the worst Torchy s in Austin. Doesn t matter what time you come  there is a long wait to order. The soda machine is always out of at least half of the options. Most of the time the food is either cold or made incorrect. Not to mention the tables are usually dirty and the employees are not very friendly.
Torchy's Tacos,352,The worst service I have had in a really long time. I waited for more than 40 minutes for two tacos. I asked about the wait beforehand and was told that they didn t have one. The people were rude to me. I will never return to this location. Get some people who like their jobs.
Torchy's Tacos,353,So this is what Tex-Mex is. As a Californian  I ve always had trouble taking this classification seriously  but I totally get both the difference and why it s great now. Got two tacos whose names I can t remember  one had fried shrimp  one had beef fajita  and both were incredible. I think the thing I struggled with most about these tacos were the extras - I don t need pickled cabbage as much as I just need plain meat  cheese  and salsa. But it s great anyway. And the queso. Oh my god. I get it Austin. I want to eat this for the rest of my life.  Extra points for this location being indoors - as much as I love the food truck atmosphere in Austin  sometimes some air conditioning is really key.
Torchy's Tacos,354,I got a green chile pork taco on corn tortillas. It was a little too bland for my liking  the meat could have used more seasoning. I think the tacos would be much improved if it had a bunch of melted cheese on it but you could say the same about any hot food.
Torchy's Tacos,355,This was the first Torchy s I ever went to.  The tacos were so delicious after a hard day of mountain biking.  I had the Baja Shrimp and the taco of the month  Mr. Orange.  I don t really like salmon  but the Mr. Orange was superb.    The reason I am giving this location 3 stars when the food was so good is the dirtiness of the restaurant.  The bathroom was one of the dirties bathrooms I have ever seen  gas stations put it to shame .  There was no toilet paper nor was there any soap  If I had not been so bloody hungry  I would have left the food and gone.  I just imagined all the employees NOT washing their hands after using the toilet.  I had antibacterial gel and used that before I ate.  I have never returned to this location.  Too disgusting.
Torchy's Tacos,356,i called about placing an order of 60 assorted taco with sides and they told me it was going to be an hour...turns out it was like only 30 minutes  completely organized wrapped and in containers ready to go. i was beyond impressed with the last minute achievement  not to mention the quality and taste was exactly as if you were in the restaurant. this place never disappoints no matter the location.
Torchy's Tacos,357,First tried these guys in Denver and all my texas people that moved to Colorado said I HAVE to try it in Texas that I won t be let down again.... well... I m sorry I don t see why you d go here over any street truck.  Lacked in taste in my eyes and wasn t what I m looking for in a taco.
Torchy's Tacos,358,I love Torchy s so much HOWEVER every single time I go to this specific location  they always seem to mess up my order. I always get the migas breakfast taco - which comes with SCRAMBLED EGGS  CRISP CORN TORTILLA STRIPS  GREEN CHILES  FRESH AVOCADO  PICO DE GALLO  amp  FRESHLY GRATED CHEDDAR JACK CHEESE WITH TOMATILLO SAUCE ON YOUR CHOICE OF TORTILLA - and FOR SOME REASON  this location always adds BACON. I am vegetarian  so I am sure you can understand my frustration. The taco does not even come with bacon in the first place  so the fact that they randomly add it is a bit strange. This has happened to me on multiple occasions. I will not be returning to this location   
Torchy's Tacos,359,I love Torchy s food  and have been to a few of their locations  but this one has never my met expectations. I m not sure if the problem is that their under staffed  but my food always takes forever. This past time I went there was a 40 minute wait and I consider Torchy s to be  fast food   so I ended up ditching and went to Juiceland instead   
Torchy's Tacos,360,I didn t like their tacos but maybe I selected the wrong ones but their queso mmmm soooo freaking awesome
Torchy's Tacos,361,I love Torchy s  Every time I come to Austin I come here and I haven t been disappointed. I got the trailer park trashy and it was good. The tacos are cheap but big and you only really need to order one if you get chips also.
Torchy's Tacos,362,Although Torchy s did start off as an Austinite haven...I m not really too into Torchy s.  If you are into eccentric creative food mix of different foods to create a new vibe...you may like this- for sure...but I ve definitely had better when it comes to americanizing or texanizing mexican food.
Torchy's Tacos,363,Super overrated in my opinion. The tacos were fine  the vibe is a bit odd  amp  it s nothing particularly special. Feels a bit commercial
Torchy's Tacos,364,The fired avocado taco was delicious  I enjoyed the vegan tacos and the atmosphere had a cool Austin vibe.
Torchy's Tacos,365,It s about time that I finish writing this. I ve only gone to torchy s twice  but both times were excellent.   I d suggest the independent and their tacos of the month. The chips and guac was delicious and put Chipotle s to shame.  Let me just say that if I ever moved to Texas I know that I d only move to a city that had a torchy s.
Torchy's Tacos,366,I like Torchy s but I don t like this location  It s crowded and parking is a nightmare.  I know it s catered to the UT population but sometimes I crave some delicious queso while I m at work and this is the best place to get it.  Food is consistent and lives up to the brand  it s just the parking that keeps me away from this place.   On the plus side  I can order online 
Torchy's Tacos,367,Oh man. You only need to say fried avocado once and I ll jump. Torchy s was on the  must hit  list when visiting Austin  and I am so glad we did.  First off  the guacamole is FANTASTIC. Well-balanced flavors  creamy  and served with excellent chips. I opted for the Fried Avocado  see above  and The Independent - two vegetarian tacos that I enjoyed sans cheese and aioli. The tacos didn t need either garnish. The Independent with the fried Portobello mushroom was mouth-watering - much better than I was anticipating  sometimes mushroom tacos get so soggy and sad . Not this taco  And the corn carrot blend gave such a vibrancy to the overall flavor profile.   Two tacos was PLENTY of food. In fact  I could have done one with the chips   guac...but I m not sad I didn t. I don t know the next time I ll be in Austin  but when I do  I will be back  Torchy s. Oh yes.
Torchy's Tacos,368,The Baja Shrimp tacos are delicious  staff were friendly and attentive. Bathrooms were a bit of a mess but I wasn t there for the toilets.
Torchy's Tacos,369,Wish I could ve taken their avocado salsa home in a huge bucket    SO YUMMY     Tacos are huge so I could go for 1 and half side of chips and avocado salsa.   We tried Mr. Pink  The Republican  the jalape o sausage one  carnitas one-sorry can t remember name first taco listed  and the Barbacoa one. All delish     Just go you can t go wrong   
Torchy's Tacos,370,Awesome tacos... Every single time I come here. On top of that- this location has a bar. The torchy-tini s are so damn good. Want more  Ask Nicole to make your drink. She is everything you want in a bartender and more.   Good job at taking my money Torchy s... Why you so good  
Torchy's Tacos,371,Queso  queso where have you been all my life   Their queso and chips are literally the best thing on the menu. You can t just go here and not have their queso. They even put a little glob of guac in the middle for you to mix. It s the best of both worlds   For their tacos  I like to order off their  secret menu  and get the Hipster which is like the Trashy Trailer Park with a twist. Although I can never finish two tacos  I always order two. For my second taco  I take it down a notch and order something off their main menu like the Beef Fajita. Simple  yet delectable. With these two tacos you get both the hardiness from the Hipster s fried chicken  and the freshness from Beef Fajita s pico de gallo.
Torchy's Tacos,372,Torchy s Tacos is the place to go for great food  good company  and an awesome atmosphere  
Torchy's Tacos,373,Just got Torchy s to go. All my taco s tortillas were torn and stuck to the foil. I also got them trashy  meaning with queso on the tacos  and it looks like they just threw the queso on there as fast as possible and didn t even close it. I really like Torchy s but I can t even eat the tacos I got. Don t order to go here. They don t take the time to make sure their quality is the same as when you eat in at the store.
Torchy's Tacos,374,This is probably not best or the worse taco. Had the fried avocado taco  green chili pork and a trailer park. Not impressed with them but they weren t bad either. The chips were good and diablo sauce super spicy.  Don t go out of your way to eat there but stop if you are hungry for a taco because they have lots of kinds.
Torchy's Tacos,375,The democrat  Jamaican jerk  fried avocado and the dirty Sanchez are my favorite tacos here. It s my first time trying it in Austin but so far so good  great food and fast service
Torchy's Tacos,376,It s too bad I didn t discover this place sooner before I moved because it was only a 5 minute walk from my front door. But maybe that s a good thing because I might ve ended up eating there every day   First of all  the service was great. I waltzed in there solo one day during happy hour and thought I d have a beer and a taco. I ended up eating 3 tacos  Crossroads  Brushfire  Green Chile Pork  and washing them down with a shot of tequila.  The next day my friend came in from out of town and I took him there. He was in love with the flavored and creativity as well.  This is a great casual place for fun and good eats. Highly recommended 
Torchy's Tacos,377,DIRTY SANCHEZ. Grossest name ever  but delicious. I really wish they would change the name though... it was hard to think  tasty  while you re eating something called the dirty sanchez.  However  the reverse psychology worked... I bought it. haha.
Torchy's Tacos,378,To start off  I LOVE TORCHYS. This is my first experience at the Guadalupe location. I placed an order online and it said it would be available for pick up at 135pm. I go into the store at exactly 135 and wait in the line because no one was at the pick up register  both cashiers that were there were on the phone and the wait took 10 minutes. I work at the Capitol so I was in a hurry which is why I order online because it s usually quick. I ll give it another chance there or I ll go to another location. Thanks
Torchy's Tacos,379,Always inconsistent. Queso was served cold. Car was booted while dining in because of the sketchy smoke shop next door that literally looks closed down with graffiti on the two front doors. Saw another person picking up a to-go order that got booted within 3 minutes also. Save yourself  150 and Go to a different  better location.
Torchy's Tacos,380,Fried avocado taco. Extra tortillas are  0.25 or something equally cheap. Heaven.
Torchy's Tacos,381,This place was overrated. After reading the reviews  we were disappointed. The queso was good  but the tacos were just okay. We did not even finish them. They were actually bland and did not seem fresh. The tortillas  both corn and flour  were cold and the meat seemed to have been cooked earlier in the day.   The atmosphere was clean and modern.
Torchy's Tacos,382,I LOVE torchys food  BUT the guy who takes your order is SO RUDE. He is the most unfriendliest person I ve encountered at this location. I go weekly at lunch time and seem to always get him. You never get greeted  he just gives a blank stare and follows with more blank stares at the end instead of a thank you. The last visit I asked for lettuce on my taco   that will cost extra . Really   I just ordered queso  with no guac  but your going to charge me for some lettuce. PLEASE put him way in the back  rather than taking orders. Update  rude guy is now the bartender. Yea 
Torchy's Tacos,383,Came here for lunch one day and ordered a Fried Avocado taco and a Trashy Trailer Park taco. The line to order appeared to be long when we got there but it moved pretty quickly. They also got us our order pretty fast.  The fried avocado was alright but I could see how it could be popular among vegetarians. The Trashy Trailer Park was amazing though  Its a fried chicken taco with queso and was delicious. When we were ordering  I didn t think 2 tacos were going to be enough for me but they were more than enough  The tacos are huge and extremely filling. I wish I had a chance to try the queso and chips  which looked great on the table next to ours. Guess I ll have to come back 
Torchy's Tacos,384,First of all  the tacos are good. Overpriced  but good.   I have to leave a review because of the smell  the overwhelming stench when you walk through the door. It is unbearable. I have left twice because it is impossible to eat inside with the stench.   I have spoken to two managers on two occasions about the odor and they have let me know that the abandoned Chinese restaurant adjacent to torchys is decaying and causing the stench. Nothing has been done about it in the past two months since I pointed it out. I will not be coming back until I forget about the putrid odor overwhelming the store.
Torchy's Tacos,385,The recently remodeled UT Austin Torchy s Tacos is a vast improvement over its predecessor. Gone are the days of waiting for one of the few tables or the confusing walk down the back hallway to the sketchy bathrooms. This new Torchy s is chic  modern  and has bathrooms accessible from the main restaurant   With the UT campus a block away  this Torchy s Tacos is always bustling. Don t be surprised if you find yourself jockeying for a table  especially if you have a larger group. Be warned that the soda fountain only offers Maine Root beverages  that means no Diet Coke you addicts  including Doppelg nger  the fantastic Dublin Dr. Pepper knockoff.   Get two tacos. Get queso  seriously  it s fantastic . Gorge.  Use your Go Local card to get 5  off your purchase.
Torchy's Tacos,386,I was sold when I saw a  Mr. Orange  and a  Mr. Pink  on the menu  I appreciate a good Reservoir Dogs reference. Not to mention a glowing  Damn Good  sign set the expectations high.   Torchy s was the second spot on our taco tour  and we settled on the Fried Avocado  The Independent and the Mr. Pink  of course   an ahi-tuna  cabbage and queso fresco creation. Fillings were flowing  and taking down these tacos was messy  at best. The Independent had the most flavor. Not only were the toppings abundant  but there was also just a whole lot going on  fried mushrooms  roasted corn  black beans  escabeche carrots  ancho aioli  cilantro. Torchy s is smart to use two tortillas per taco.  As much as I like the thought of a Fried Avocado taco  I did not enjoy the Fried Avocado taco. In general  I find the idea of warm avocado a bit gross  it s the texture. But that s my fault  and I should ve known better. What the Fried Avocado did so wrong in texture  though  the Mr. Pink did right. Between the ahi tuna and the cabbage fresca  the taco had crunch and chew.    Damn Good  might be a little strong  but I can get on board with Darn Good.
Torchy's Tacos,387,I m sure it s fine... I m just the one person that does not like migas.
Torchy's Tacos,388,I came to Austin on a business trip and was given a list of restaurants I shouldn t pass up. Torchy s was my first stop and I was not disappointed  The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. Breakfast tacos are now a new favorite of mine and I can guarantee your taste buds will NOT be disappointed if you decide to dine here 
Torchy's Tacos,389,I went to this Torchy s location for lunch after trying the one on Spicewood Springs. The interior of this one was much better than the other location. It was more comfortable and MUCH cleaner inside. I actually didn t have to choose the least-dirty table  unlike at the other location. It was VERY clean and the bar inside is awesome  too  which is where we sat. As far as the food  I ordered two tacos  they were cooked properly  they were hot  and they tasted good  A-OK. It just seems like they put all these different ingredients into their tacos so you don t really get any singular flavors with them. It s just a blast of flavor and heat  while being really hard to differentiate particular flavors or tell each taco apart from another. You can probably find cheaper tacos  but they do put a lot of work into them. I do need to try their breakfast tacos. So  overall  A-OK. Nothing to get too worked up over  but a place that you are required to try at least once if you live in Austin.
Torchy's Tacos,390,Torchy s was recommended by a friend as one of the best taco places in Austin and it sure was   Great customer service too 
Torchy's Tacos,391,Great food. Very reasonable prices. Service great. Portions big. Try the queso dip as it s simply the best 
Torchy's Tacos,392,The tacos here are really  really delicious  and they have a wonderful secret menu. All of my out of town friends that I ve taken here have said this is their favorite restaurant in Austin. The star of the movie Boyhood also mentioned this as the best place for tacos in Austin on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  On the regular menu  my favorites are the republican and the brushfire. On the secret menu  the Jack of Spades can t be beat. The Ace of Clubs is really good too and is huge  If you like food spicy  try their Diablo sauce...it s incredible   Last but not least  the place was recently remodeled and it looks really nice too. Give this place a try 
Torchy's Tacos,393,I love Torchy s. Messy awesome tacos.  My favorite is  The Independent.  This is coming from a dedicated carnivore  but the fried portobello is so great you ll never miss the fact that it s a vegetarian dish.  Dublin Dr. Pepper or their fountain lemonade tops it off nicely.
Torchy's Tacos,394,YUMMYYYY  I love all of their tacos  Parking is little bit inconvenient  but food is great 
Torchy's Tacos,395,I loved everything about Torchy s.   Not so touristy as it is off the tourist path serving tacos to the local UT college crowd.   What you ll get to order here is inventive Tex-Mex tacos.    Everything here was excellent. I went with their carnitas taco and the popular fried chicken taco. Each delightful and full of flavor.   For dessert  I ordered the decadent fried chocolate chip cookie which was crisp on the outside  warm  sweet and delectable on the inside.   I also loved that they had a Maine Root soda fountain.
Torchy's Tacos,396,I wish I could love this location. It s a short walk from my home  amp  I love Torchy s in general  but we have been to the Guadalupe location 5 times now  amp  3 of those times were met with less than stellar service and unimpressive orders. Our most recent trip was last night - the bartender seemed annoyed with having to be bothered to pour my husband s beer  our queso had maybe a small teaspoon size serving of guacamole but had double the normal amount of cilantro  and my Trailer Park came with a single scrawny piece of chicken about the width of one of those pencil s kindergarteners learn to write with. On a previous trip  I ordered a Torchy-Tini and received a regular martini. When my husband took it back up to the bar  amp  asked her to remake it  I was just going to suck it up and drink it even though I don t like reg martinis  the bartender insisted she had made it the right way  that  that s the way they re made here .  We may give the location another shot just for the convenience  but truth be told I d rather travel a little bit down the road to visit a different Torchy s where we ve always had excellent experiences.
Torchy's Tacos,397,Every time I have Torchy s I have an immediate fear that it won t live up to my memories. then I take a bite and somehow it surpasses them. Torchy s has quickly become the bar which I measure other tacos by  and besides the top tier of taco makers  and certainly no other chains  Torchy s cannot be beat. The selection is a huge part of it as they have everything from fish and shrimp tacos to brisket  sausage  and even duck sometimes. The specials are always amazing  so be on the lookout for them. The beer selection is also usually good  though small  with several craft beers represented. This location is not the most scenic as it is essentially on a busy multi lane road right off the UT campus  and the outdoor seating feels more like a parking lot with tons of aggressive grackles. The inside is expansive though with tons of seats. I always go for the brushfire with extra hellfire sauce as I love spice. There are plenty of more mild flavors as well though. For good Texas style tacos  Torchy s sets a high bar.
Torchy's Tacos,398,Since arriving in Austin  I ve been using Yelp  with minimal success. At best  I ve had decent food throughout my stay  and it wasn t until my last day in Austin did I encounter both the best and worst experience of my life.  I arrived in search of mouth watering  flavor bursting   give me more  type of food  and even though reviews placed certain restaurants at 4.5-5 stars  I haven t been impressed. Meh. Whatever. I figured  I could wait until returning home to Hawaii for some REAL food.  I awoke on my last day in Austin to my husband s glisteing face  excited as hell to get ready to eat.  What the hell is happening I thought..  He started raving about Franklin BBQ  and said if we got ready quickly  we could beat the lines for some delicious food.  I quickly assembled the family and we headed out to Franklin BBQ  but they were closed for their annual vacation   WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. So basically  I didn t even get to first base      Going through my list of food places  I suggested to my husband we head over to Torchy s Tacos   SIDE NOTE   BEST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE    and boy I m glad I did. THIS IS WHAT I VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR DURING MY ENTIRE STAY IN AUSTIN AND I FINALLY GOT IT  WE GOT IT   I ordered The Crossroads  and damn straight there were CROSSROADS  deliciousness  flavors bursting  right amount of spice  and perfect amount of meat  and the perfect size.  My husband ordered The Trailer Park  Trashy Style   and my gawwwwwd it was delicious. Chile  let me tell you   We usually have no problem ordering different dishes and sharing with each other  but on this day  you could see us  very  hesitantly offering a taste as we monitored how big a bite we both took and quickly retracting the taco as soon as the bite was taken  LOL   Basically  it was delicious  and I m disgusted we don t have this in Hawaii.
Torchy's Tacos,399,Came here on a whim with my wife. We had the trailer park  democrat  and crossroads. All three were great. I liked everything way more than I expected. Wish I lived in Austin 
Torchy's Tacos,400,Got the off the menu missionary taco and it s too small to get one but too big to get two.  The best part of it is the spicy sauce and it has interesting flavors that I enjoyed but isn t worth  7 for sure.  Regardless it s a solid taco and would order again...if I had two I would prob pass out.
Torchy's Tacos,401,The tacos were awesome. Being an out of towner  didn t know what to take. Wait staff suggested the trailer and Baja shrimp. Both were awesome. Chips and salsa were good too. Only negative was that the tables didn t seem clean but that s probably due to it being busy and not enough people to clean the tables. Food was great 
Torchy's Tacos,402,Went to torchys for a breakfast taco. Cashier never mentioned a wait.... We then proceeded to wait an hour and a half for TWO TACOS . Worst service I ve ever had  and everyone in the restaurant felt the same way. Manager didn t comp our food and never offered an explanation as to why nobody was being served.   Never going to torchys in Austin again.
Torchy's Tacos,403,Huge tacos   I definitely recommend getting the Trailer Park and be sure to make it trashy. There are few things I have gotten here that I didn t like. Their special tacos are always great as well 
Torchy's Tacos,404,I love how this place took a sub-shop sandwich naming concept and applied it to tacos. You can only really get away with that if they re heaping  which they are. Had the Crossroads and Green Chile Pork  both very good.  The star here though was the Green Chile Queso and Chips.  Unbelievable. I d pay large sums of money to get this stuff in New York. My cousin  who is from New Mexico  took me here so it makes sense. I m somewhat addicted to green chile.
Torchy's Tacos,405,So we stopped in at the UT location for quick bite on a Sunday night. Believe the reviews on parking challenges  we had to circle around the area three times  missed two spots by 1.5 seconds  not kidding .  Place was pretty full  line almost to the door at 7 30P. Three people in our party  line moved quickly with two cashiers. One had Green Chile Pork  excellent  recommended  and Democrat  meh   another the Crossroads  if you like really really REALLY like salty brisket  this one is for you  but not for me  and the Brushfire with Jamaican Jerk Chicken  this one was a winner  great flavor and kick   and a Chicken Fajita  which was nicely done   very tasty.  Sauces accompanying the tacos were well executed.  Servers were very friendly  asking how we liked our tacos  anything else we needed  etc. and no sooner had someone left a table  the table was promptly cleaned and ready for the next person.  The reason I gave it only three stars was because  1  it was a pain to park  2  spending  21 for 5 tacos  just the tacos  no drinks of any kind  seems a bit much to me.  Granted some of the ingredient combos are somewhat different  but they are not so unique as to justify a charge upwards of  5 for some of them. If they were massive portions  then maybe  but they are not huge. There are lots of good taco places around  think this is simply a case of location location location. Guess they know how  problematic parking is  so they up the price so the folks who actually can park  a smaller number  to ensure the place keeps going. Maybe the plan is a  walk to place  only   The people and service are great  the food is not bad  but it s not great either. Wish I could rate it at 3.5 stars above  it hits that easily  but not 4.
Torchy's Tacos,406,I tried this location and have come to the conclusion that all Torchy s Tacos locations screw up your order no matter how many times CLEARLY you  say it on the phone. With that said I always get avocado  black beans  onions  potatoes on corn tortilla  darn that gluten allergin   ... and whats funny is I said it three times on the phone  on corn  and what do they do    No raw onions and on flour tortilla.   I was only pissed when I got my order because I was already 10 min away and starving. Luckily my husband came to the rescue and got it handled for me.   Now to the positives of it all   The food is delicious  SO cheap and the quality of tacos is some of the best. I wish they had a Torchys in lakeway so that when I get off work  I could get a taco  and I mean right now   ..  When in Austin you have to try Torchy s  just make sure that when your not the  norm  customer that you overly annoyling check your order with them  hence  check out my other review for the Torchy s on William Cannon rd. ..   The sauces are great and the place is always packed 
Torchy's Tacos,407,What I get  Shrimp Baja  Mr. Pink  Chips and queso  I consider myself a taco snob. I grew up in a border town where tacos there are authentic and delicious. What Torchy s Tacos has done to the taco game in Austin is amazing  The flavors all line up to deliver incredible taste with every bite  It s a bit pricey at  3-4 dollars a taco  but it is most definitely worth it 
Torchy's Tacos,408,The tacos are delicious. This comes as no surprise. I m a fan of Torchy s. However  this location is very slow  and as a result I ve removed it from my list of places I consider going for lunch near UT. They struggle to deal with the demand  and on numerous occasions my food here took longer than 20 minutes to get from the time I ordered. In my mind this is unacceptable for a counter service establishment  and means that any lunchtime trip here could be prohibitively long. Other places on The Drag are set up to efficiently handle large numbers of busy students and faculty  but this Torchy s is not.
Torchy's Tacos,409,Food is amazing but they consistently take their phone off the hook so you can t call in an order and if you actually get through they also won t take orders over the phone 20-30 before close... if you re physically there 15 minutes before they close and lock the doors they just might take your order  might being the key ... but it s happen a number of times I get there at 945 and they won t serve me. Damn Good food  they are just all about not serving you before they close.
Torchy's Tacos,410,Loved their queso chips. The fish  Mr. Pink  and beef tacos came with cold tortilla and tasted..meh.
Torchy's Tacos,411,I do not understand this place.  I don t understand why people line up for a taco that is no better or worse than the tacos you can get all over town.  People in Austin seem to like to stand in lines for things.  It s fine.  It s a taco.  It s nothing special.
Torchy's Tacos,412,Damn good tacos indeed and at a good price  usually order 2 tacos and I m stuffed . They maybe small for the average dude  but I think Torchy s packs their tacos with good quality ingredients and the selection of tacos - the best    I usually go with the trailer park  order it trashy - queso instead of lettuce  and baja shrimp  love the battered shrimp and chipotle sauce . But a must order  if you love cheese  is the queso - it comes with the works  guacamole  queso fresco  cilantro  amp  their hot sauce.   Seating is difficult at this location since it s a small space  but you can order online.
Torchy's Tacos,413,This review is solely for their online ordering system. I have ordered online at least three times trying to give this location the benefit of the doubt and THEY ALWAYS DISAPPOINT ME. I hate writing bad reviews but if you want your order correct or to get it in a timely fashion do not use this location. The first time there was one taco missing  ok no big deal. The next time there were two tacos missing  ok bigger deal. The most recent time the order took 40 minutes over the time it was supposed to be ready  ok this is unacceptable. Love Torchy s food but this is bad quality control and time management  hope they get it together.
Torchy's Tacos,414,We loved Torchy s  Three vegetarians happily consumed tacos  queso and chips. No hassles because there are lots of vegetarian options. Food is terrific and inexpensive  and everyone so nice. Thank goodness we don t live in Austin  because I would need a Torchy s fix everyday.  Fried avocado is delicious. My husband really liked the Dirty Sanchez. All yummy.
Torchy's Tacos,415,So good   The fried mushroom taco was delicious  as was the fried avocado taco. Cheap  quick  and reeeealy yummy  
Torchy's Tacos,416,A great place to catch on some great vegetarian tacos  refreshing and a must try their fried avocado chicken fajita and Independence Day are just awesome the best fusion tacos I had so far I have attached pics also incase for reference and btw they have good drinks also    the washrooms are clean also
Torchy's Tacos,417,The tacos purveyed by Torchy s are not what you would call  authentic   but that s not a bad thing. In fact  the tacos are delicious. I would much rather call Torchy s a  specialty  or  artisan  taco shop rather than an authentic one. Their huge menu contains a bunch of tacos with interesting  albeit nontraditional  combinations. You ll never get bored of Torchy s because every taco is a strong choice.  You really can t go wrong at Torchy s. I ve had just about everything the menu  and everything is delicious. My personal favorites are the green chile pork  the Democrat  and the trailer park. Of particular note is their chips and queso  a TX specialty of cheese dip . After a couple years here in Austin  I still have to say that Torchy s has some of the best queso I ve had. Its got a little kick to it  but it packs a ton of flavor in every bite. Beware  though  if you get chips and queso  be careful that you don t neglect your tacos--the chips and queso can be very filling.   Side note  I love the political references at Torchy s--the Democrat is one of the pricier tacos  whereas the Republican is cheap and consists of a big sausage.   This particular location has really improved since they remodeled it last Spring. It s got ample parking and seating now  whereas before it was always pretty crammed. The decor is a lot less generic now  and actually is a fun place to visit.
Torchy's Tacos,418,Food was ok. My first time here. Getting to the point  the guy who took my order was an ass.
Torchy's Tacos,419,Mm mm mm mm mm. What can I say.. Torchy s is definitely one of my go-to taco joints near campus. All of their tacos are loaded with fillings so they re real nice and fat. My favorites include the fried avocado and the trailer park-trashy of course. But  my absolute favorite thing about torchy s is their QUESO  I am absolutely  head over heels in love with their queso. I m drooling thinking about it right now...   Also  don t forget about their secret menu  You can easily find it online. The ace of spades is definitely worth a try   Tl dr  get the queso and don t forget to check out their secret menu 
Torchy's Tacos,420,Tried this place when I interviewed at UT. I was not disappointed. I loved the flavorful grilled jalape o sausage in the Republican taco. The tacos were creative and extremely cheap  I would definitely go back the next time I m in Austin 
Torchy's Tacos,421,Not the best Torchy s location. Often has one person working upfront to take phone orders  hand out to go orders  and take the orders for people who want to eat in house. They often keep a line waiting inside when they should just have two people working.
Torchy's Tacos,422,They are not vegan friendly. You can customize their vegetarian tacos to make it vegan but that removes all their specialty. Their sauces are tasty and they have sauces of different spice range. Thankfully  some of them are vegan. Try them. I like the spicy ones.
Torchy's Tacos,423,Fantastic tacos. You got a pretty decent selection of combinations to choose from but for the most part  they re ALL good  so you can t really go wrong. The fried avocado one is actually pretty damn good for carnivore like myself  so I highly recommend that one. Seating is kind of limited with a bunch of UT students always coming here but it s doable. Minus 1 star b c one time my friends and I came here and he got a hair in his taco. Now if it was mine I d drop it down to 3 stars but it wasn t so     They ARE a bit pricey though with each being around 3.50 I believe. If you buy two then they re pretty filling for the average person.  8 10  would come again anytime.
Torchy's Tacos,424,The worst torchy s location. Placed a to go order over the phone and arrived to pick up my order at the to go counter only to be ignored for 20 minutes.  Two people at the cashier helping people inside but unwilling to help me at the to go counter. I even knocked on the window to make sure they knew I was there. Cashiers looked at me and continued to ignore me. Left without my food after trying to get their attention for over 20 minutes.
Torchy's Tacos,425,Horrible cashiers every time I go. Be more nicer to the people who make the restaurant money. i just go get my tacos somewhere else.
Torchy's Tacos,426,I can t believe it took me til my last semester at UT to try out Torchy s  So many regrets... I was informed by all my friends that Torchy s tastes great but isn t worth the money given their small portions. This turned out to be false  with prices being average for tacos and their portions generous  at least compared to other local taco joints like Taco Deli. Their breakfast tacos  in particular  are MASSIVE.  I ordered the wrangler  ranch hand  and brushfire. Both the wrangler and ranch hand combined the breakfast necessities of egg and cheese with cuts of beef  my meat of choice. The ranch hand stood out  primarily due to the accompanying diablo sauce that  appealed to my spice taste buds    The brushfire  however  was on another level  I ordered it without sour cream  as I m not a fan of the thicker consistency it gives to food  as well as diluting the flavor. The brushfire was super refreshing  with the sweet mango serving as a perfect foil to the spicy diablo sauce and jalapenos. As a bonus  the brushfire is incredibly light  allowing for other heavier taco choices.  Torchy s is amazing and I was excited to discover they re opening another location in Houston near my future office. I foresee frequent Torchy s breakfast trips in the future 
Torchy's Tacos,427,I was told by a few Austinites that Torchy s has the best tacos.  I came and didn t find anything memorable.  I ordered their Mr. Pink  which has seared tuna  and Crossroads with beef briskets  jalapeno  etc.  I also got an order of the street corn.  I really wish this could ve turned out differently.  There is a secret menu online  which is pretty similar to their regular menu with a little twist.  I preferred the regular menu.
Torchy's Tacos,428,Best tacos I ve ever had   I had the Democrat and the Brushfire and both were outstanding.  And the guac was amazingly good too - and for  5 it can feed a ton of people.  I wish they would expand to the east coast because I would love to have their tacos again.  I will dream about them.
Torchy's Tacos,429,The Wrangler was so delicious  The brisket in it was to die for.    I also ordered the Migas which was just okay.  At first I thought the tacos seemed pricey but when they came out  I was pleasantly surprised at how big they were. I ate two and was stuffed 
Torchy's Tacos,430,Best tacos and queso I ever had in my life    I m in love  Try the Baja shrimp taco  the tipsy chick  and the queso and chips. The bacon marmalade set everything off   The tequila sunrise and sangria were great too. Need a Torchy s back home in Baltimore.
Torchy's Tacos,431,I drove around for 20 minutes trying to find a parking spot and by then I had to get my food to go so that I could make it back to work on time. The staff was very friendly and the tacos were great. The best part about the whole meal was the chips  amp  queso. I was very hungry  so I got two tacos  but I should ve only gotten one. I ate half of each and had the rest the next day   
Torchy's Tacos,432,I love Torchys  but this location is the worst in Austin - that s a given because it s a university location  but I would really recommend driving to a further one if you can. Service here is slow and dry  the queso doesn t always come out hot  and the tacos are less filled than the same tacos at other locations
Torchy's Tacos,433,Great fast food drunk food type of joint. My favorites are trailer park trashy  democrat  and baja shrimp. The queso was pretty good too. Lots of college kids and the line can get really long on weekend nights. Don t order breakfast tacos at night--it took forever. It can actually get a little pricey if you re trying to eat until you re actually full  which for me was about 4 tacos and half the queso with chips.
Torchy's Tacos,434,I love love love the tacos here. The chips and guac was SO GOOD    I got two tacos the first time- the beef fajita and fried avocado  didn t expect them to be so big  They were very filling and absolutely delcious. I d eat here all day every day.  I ve also had the brushfire  and it was good but spicier than I imagined. I don t think I d get it again  but for those who love the heat  try it 
Torchy's Tacos,435,Waited 30 minutes in a not busy restaurant for breakfast tacos. I honestly can t imagine how 4 ingredients takes this long.
Torchy's Tacos,436,Excellent tacos. You see the stars  Yea just go check this place out. Everything is good  and you won t be disappointed.
Torchy's Tacos,437,Awesome taco joint. I went there in the morning for tacos and went back again in the evening for more tacos. I liked the naughty santa and the brushfire taco alot.
Torchy's Tacos,438,This place hands down has some amazing tacos and queso   I finally got to try this place out after hearing so many people talk about the food here. The Trailer Park and  the Democrat were super good  I loved the taste and freshness of the food. They definitely have great veg options as well which surprised me to see so many options on their menu.   Be sure to try the diablo sauce for a kick if you re in to spicy food. But use with caution - its definitely hot     The queso here is finger licking good. If you do order it  be sure to only share it with your nice friends  because its so good you ll want more for yourself.
Torchy's Tacos,439,Enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The workers were very friendly   They definitely deserve credit for how hard the work. People seems to think they can lay their bowls  amp  trays of food on top of the trash area without emptying them. They stack them up or leave them on their table without taking them to the trash can  leaving it for the workers to clean up after them. While there I was very apologetic to the worker cleaning up after nasty pigs whom stacked their food up on the empty tray area without emptying their trays  he was very nice about cleaning it up. Point is  he didn t have to be. So therefore  kudos to him for taking on an unnecessary task and not being angry about it.  There was a little line but they were quick and courteous when taking the customers back.   My taco was delicious as well as my chips and queso. I regret not trying one of their Margaritas   but will next time.   Quick note to people who do try.... Please clean up after yourself... Respect can take you a long way  
Torchy's Tacos,440,Hmm... How should I describe... Torchys...  Okay  its like a heart attack... Its so good but you know this stuff cant be so good for you...   I really love their queso  it has avacado in it.... I would die for queso with avacado. I think austin people all love avacado in general.    Trashy trailer park taco  democrat  deep fried avacado taco.... If you havent tried torchys  your definitely missing out 
Torchy's Tacos,441,Whitest coldest tortilla ever seen at a restaurant. Straight from the package not even warmed up.
Torchy's Tacos,442,A great place to bring a group of vegetarian friends for inexpensive and amazing eats  Order corn shells  and they will come with two  making it easier to trade halves with friends. We ate here twice while visiting because none of us could stop thinking about the tacos. Fried avocado was fantastic. The corn side was great as well. All ingredients are fresh  and service is fast.
Torchy's Tacos,443,Decently good tacos. I would recommend the ranch hands  steak  amp  eggs  or the republican  sausage .  Also  their hot sauce really has a good kick to it  which is great for me because I love spicy foods.
Torchy's Tacos,444,The parking situation here is a mess. BUT they have a full bar guys    The only thing in the world that could make a trashy trailer park better is a nice frozen margarita to drink with it. And this is the location where that fantasy can happen.
Torchy's Tacos,445,It s been four years since I was in Austin and I hadn t ever tried Torchy s until now. Wow  Ended up going 4 times in three days.  The breakfast tacos are all hearty and scrumptious - pick your own sauce  I recommend the avocado with a bit of diablo  and you ll be happily full for the whole morning.  The day menu is equally impressive. The Green Chile taco may sound a bit standard but it is incredible.   And don t let the  vegetarian  label fool you on the Fried Avocado taco - it is one amazing taco. Not too heavy  but loaded with flavour. The breaded and fried avocado is just the right balance of fried and savoury.   On my last visit I was stuffed after two breakfast tacos - but added a Fried Avocado since it was my last chance and it was the best choice I could have made.   The signs are correct  Torchy s - Damn Good.
Torchy's Tacos,446,Definitely more Tex than Mex  but hits the spot if that what you re looking for. Fried avocado is banging   the Democrat is good too. The queso has a little bite to it that makes it tastily addictive. They have some beer selection  too    Life hack  ask for extra limes and squirt them over everything to up the Mex-factor. If you like limes  that is. If not  get out of here.
Torchy's Tacos,447,I had to make a stop over at Torchy s prior to leaving Austin.  It s a must   We went there for breakfast and our party for the breakfast taco as well as Baja shrimp.  Everyone loved their meals and the sauces were delicious too.  My favorite sauce was the avocado.  Very very busy inside but food was out in under 15mins.
Torchy's Tacos,448,Damn Good is right. Great selection of tacos and sides. We were in a group of 9 and everyone had something different and loved it. The interior decor is fun.
Torchy's Tacos,449,A       I m a fatty  sol I ordered 2 tacos and a side of chips with chile queso.  That made me uncomfortably full  but oh well hehehehe  Pros -  - Fried chicken taco  10 10 . this was my fav. was crunchy and delicious. i shoulda ordered 10 of em. - Green Chile Pork  8 10 . tastes good  but not my fav here. - Fried Avocado Taco  6 10 . it s good  but I probably wouldn t order it again.  Just imagine a breaded and fried piece of avocado instead of carne asada in your taco.  That s pretty much what it is.  - 512 ipa is so money   - The green chile queso dip is THE BOMB dot com. I highly recommend this if you enjoy nachos and cheese.  Cons  - Parking is available in front of the store  but if there s a UT home game on  forget it. You re SOL. However  you can try your luck at the neighborhoods behind the restaurants.  Just read the posted signs really carefully.
Torchy's Tacos,450,Love love love this place  Have eaten in both the Dallas and Austin locations and they never disappoint. My fave is the democrat and the orange 
Torchy's Tacos,451,Tasty tacos. There are only 3 vegie taco options  and all of them are good.   First timer  then try the Independent vegie taco. Will make you ask for more.
Torchy's Tacos,452,Hooray  they re back open  I love the new layout. Fried avocado taco and Mr. Pink  you will be mine.
Torchy's Tacos,453,Yep--it lives up to the hype   Great food and we even stumbled upon a free taco selection day 
Torchy's Tacos,454,Delicious Tacos  Fun ambience  Service was top notch  Highly recommend this place for a quick bite 
Torchy's Tacos,455,Torchy s on Guadalupe recently underwent a major renovation  and it has made me love it even more. The Trailer Park taco never disappoints - I get it  trashy  classy   which means to add queso and keep the lettuce on top. I also think their queso is some of the best in Austin. Everyone loves Torchy s. Expect a wait around lunch time 
Torchy's Tacos,456,torchys never disappoints me. i love the street corn and the democrat taco  the queso is good too
Torchy's Tacos,457,They have greatly expanded their location near UT with a full bar and plenty of seating... parking can be a royal pain in the rear end though.  Still it s Torchy s so I ll be going back.  If they would only bottle their creamy chipotle sauce I d be in heaven.
Torchy's Tacos,458,OMG  this place is a MUST GO if you are ever in Austin. I came here on the recommendation of a stranger I met on the plane on my way to Dallas. She said  if you are to go anywhere for food in Austin for TexMex  go to Torchy s right next to the UT campus. Because of this  I did. I am so glad we came here  as the tacos were great  My husband got the avocado taco  and I got the Dirty Sanchez  poblano pepper taco   along with our  3 cocktails. Seriously   3 for cocktails       That s unheard of back where I m from. I would come back for both the food and drinks if I were ever back out this way again. However  the next time I will not wear any opposing UT football team shirts  as my husband and I were getting friendly dirty stare downs from proud Longhorns fans.
Torchy's Tacos,459,The queso alone deserves 4 stars I sort of think that Torchy s is the Austin fast food taco equivalent but still really great for a quick taco bite  They put the sauces in the side of each taco  which I also loved. Breakfast tacos a little heavy on the egg but everything we got was great and quick 
Torchy's Tacos,460,They lose call in orders. Make you wait in line then proceed to tell you sorry we lost it but if you d like to wait 20 min then we can make another.  Won t be going back to this location
Torchy's Tacos,461,Yummy  Inventive. Great queso  And it s super cold inside for the summer  But hard to park.
Torchy's Tacos,462,If you want authentic Mexican tacos  this is not the place for you. Otherwise  Torchy s is the bomb  I usually come here for the Dirty Sanchez and Trailer Park  I get it trashy most the time . The Democrat is also pretty good. The Green Chile Pork and Republican are just alright to me. Their Green Chile Queso is delicious  And if you like your food spicy  then definitely try their Diablo sauce. It s amazing. I ve also tried the Ace of Spades off their  secret  menu. If you re in the mood for a large portion of meaty  cheesy  saucey  artery-clogging tacos  then try it out.
Torchy's Tacos,463,Horrible parking situation  but the food is pretty good    I like the variety of Tacos they sell.
Torchy's Tacos,464,You would think I would learn from my mistakes but no. I am like that woman that continues going back to the jerk guy. in desperation for a treat on Halloween night  I ordered Torchy s from this location to go. The manager was kind  amp  the service was relatively quick but is it too much to have my order be correct  My democrat taco was missing the avocado. It was Halloween night and this was definitely a trick  no treats. Normally I would be more forgiving but this is the pattern at this location.  Always an error.  Should be their slogan. For that  I had to move this down to a one star.
Torchy's Tacos,465,I am a big fan of Torchy s food  but this location has never gotten an order of mine entirely correct.  I only ever order my food to-go  so the wait is next to nothing.   Each time I get food there  they either forget to take off the cheese  or don t listen to the tortilla selection. This is NOT the fault of the person I give the order to- as I checked the ticket  and the ticket is always right.  The kitchen needs to be more on their game- as I m only ever there in the later afternoons in the summer- and it s not crowded- so there s really no reason for the inattention to detail every single time.   They also tend to have sloppier tacos- just not rolled well- ingredient on the inside and out etc.
Torchy's Tacos,466,Torchy s is by far one of my fav restaurants in Austin. The food is always consistent and tasty and the service is impeccable. The only reason I didn t give this location 5 stars is the horrendous parking. The odds of winning the Powerball lottery are higher than getting a parking space here. I have found myself circling the block too many times before just giving up. It s possible to pay for street parking across Guadalupe but it s a real-life game of Frogger to get back across to the restaurant. It s usually too much trouble and I give up...
Torchy's Tacos,467,Not bad for unauthentic Mexican tacos. I had the Democrat and the Republican. The Democrat is really good and savory  the Republican  while good is more like something you would put together when you re drunk and there s nothing in the fridge... Overall it was a good experience though.
Torchy's Tacos,468,Their slogan says it all.  Damn Good.  And yes  it is that good.   Came here with some of my friends to grab breakfast and had a couple of tacos. Who knew there was such a thing as a breakfast taco    I got the Wrangler and the Ranch Hand  but I doubt you could go wrong with any menu item. Finest tacos I ve had in a long time. Juicy carnitas and spicy brisket...it literally makes my mouth water even to write this review.   One of the things I hear about Austin cuisine is the queso  and Torchy s has some pretty sweet chips and queso for appetizers that I d take over my native Californian style nachos any day. I couldn t resist indulging myself with each bite.   Thanks Torchy s--I ll try to come back some day. Maybe you guys should start a shop in California. I d line up for that.
Torchy's Tacos,469,I didn t want tacos. I wanted sushi or a noodle bowl. After several days in Austin even a Tex mex aficionado was ready for a change. Out of town friends said we had to meet them here for a taco before we caught our flights out of town. Go. You so should go.  Don t do any substitutions. Order these gems exactly how they are presented on the menu. Also  I usually avoid soda but lots of local flavors on tap here. I sampled the root beer  vanilla and cactus juice lemonade blend. I heard the original location was in a trailer park. This one is walkable near the university and tons of vintage shops.
Torchy's Tacos,470,I was initially trepidatious about Torchy s because I d heard they weren t great about allergy issues.  Whoever told me this could not have been more wrong  Torchy s is awesome about questions.  When I said I had to avoid gluten they grilled stuff for me instead of battering and frying it  and they have corn tortillas.  Above and beyond that  the food is fantastic.  The vegetarian choices are limited  but so delicious that I couldn t care.  Is there one taco for me   Yes   I ll eat it until I explode and then get another one to go.
Torchy's Tacos,471,Love Love Love this place especially on Sunday s  A great place to relax and chill after a long weekend with my friends  Now we actually go here like every other Sunday.
Torchy's Tacos,472,How did I not know about this place sooner   Great location  I love that I can walk there between classes  it s more of a trek than a lot of places on The Drag  but totally worth it.   Lots of options  but I love their breakfast tacos no matter what time of day it is   the food is good  the prices are student-friendly and it s almost got the same fun atmosphere as their food truck.    Love it 
Torchy's Tacos,473,They had great food and the bartender Nadia was AMAZING  I would refer anyone there  They are DAM GOOD 
Torchy's Tacos,474,Best taco place in Austin. Breakfast  lunch  dinner  there is no place I d rather get tacos. I ve had every single one on the menu and haven t been disappointed a single time. Hangovers  casual dates  whatever the occasion may be  I love all the locations. Torchys has been an integral part of my Austin life and I m very committed to their product. Even their corn and dessert  lil nookies  are well above average.  Favorites include trailer park  mr pink  and beef fajita. Monk special  with extra bacon  is my breakfast staple. Go here. You won t regret it.
Torchy's Tacos,475,this location thoooooo....  my craving for torchy s takes a while to manifest  because I like to think I m smart enough to remember how much this location sucks. i just spent 20 min waiting on chips and queso to go  while watching tables who sat down after me get their appetizer first. no mention of the time  and while i know better than to blame servers  i m in the food industry  i get it   it would have been nice to hear a  sorry for the wait.   idk how their system works because i ALWAYS seem to wait 15 or more minutes for either queso or a breakfast taco. seriously deters me from heading downstairs  i m literally their neighbor  because it s never just a  quick  trip.
Torchy's Tacos,476,I love Mexican tacos and these are the best American tacos  please eat at Torchy s
Torchy's Tacos,477,Okay  can you say yum  Because if you can  and you like to say it  then go to Torchy s. Their tacos are so good and so creative  The way they put together flavors is pretty damn awesome. Whenever I visit Austin  I have to go get a taco   or 3   from Torchy s. You really won t be disappointed. All I can say is NOMS. The staff is also super friendly and helpful 
Torchy's Tacos,478,We traveled to Austin for a conference and were only in town for 4 days. As food lovers  it says a lot that we ate at Torchy s twice during that time   I can t recommend the Fried Avocado nor the Queso  w  surprise guacamole and cilantro added in  and chips highly enough. The food even traveled well- we got takeout and had a 30 minute drive to our hotel. The staff recommended getting things on flour tortillas to help the journey.  My partner likes things simple  so I ordered one of the specialty beef tacos with just meat and tortilla. The staff told me that the kids beef taco had the same amount of meat as an adult one  so we ordered that. Delicious   Great tacos. Helpful staff. Maine Root soda. What more could you want 
Torchy's Tacos,479,They have a really good selection  with some great vegetarian options. The sauces were all on point and well paired with their respective tacos. My girlfriend loved that they had pickled carrots. We ordered 4 different types of tacos and all of them were very good. They have some interesting sodas you can try  too. Shout-out to the buser who called himself Sasquatch  he was attentive and seems to really enjoy his job.
Torchy's Tacos,480,Torchy s is one of the only reasons I survived my undergrad years. Studying until the weeee hours of the morning. The sun comes up.. time to go to Torchy s. Let s get the only negative out of the way first. The parking blows.  Everything else is just amazing. Dear lord. The fried avocado taco. It s like I died and went to Mexican heaven. It s just so delicious and fresh. I always order that and a Migas taco in the morning.  If you compare it to Taco Shack  Torchy s is higher quality and more of a perfect fit for the quirky personality of Austin  TX. I highly recommend that everyone try this place at least once.  I won t say the tacos helped me pass key exams  but what if they did 
Torchy's Tacos,481,Damn good tacos is the first thing you see when walking in and they are exactly right. Cheap and fantastic tacos. It is a staple of Austin and a must have when visiting.The crossroad taco is a MUST HAVE. They also have great fountain drinks. The cactus lemonade drink is super good. The only thing I would say bad is that this particular location has terrible parking. But  I would put up with it any day to get those tacos.
Torchy's Tacos,482,One of the places I always take people from out of town and recommend to visitors. My favorites are the Independent  one of my favorite things to eat in the world  and the Trailer Park  trashy of course . For some reason the breakfast tacos just don t do it for me  and I didn t love either the Democrat or Republican  hah...I promise I am not echoing my actual political sentiments though it does work out well .    The remodel of this location is very nice  though I wish they had regular sodas along with the local ones  but that is very minor. People working there are always nice.
Torchy's Tacos,483,June 14  2008   Torchy s opens Guadalupe location.  Curious  I stop by and try the Brushfire and The Republican.  I am inspired by the inventiveness of putting jalapeno sausage on a taco.  These tacos are bold and impressive.   July 25  2008   Torchy s has become a regular habit.  I have sampled the entire menu many times over.  September 12  2008   I regularly accost friends  acquaintances  and random strangers    They put mango on their tacos   Go to Torchy s  motherfucker    Hahaha     October 28  2008   I eat Torchy s two  three  sometimes four times a day.  My health has declined  and I rapidly shift between phases of anger and euphoria depending on whether I am currently feeding.  Jan 10  2009   I weigh over 1 000 lbs.  I cannot stand up of my own accord  and I employ a full-time taco butler to wheel my immense carcass to and from Torchy s.  My vocabulary is limited to barely-coherent bestial growls such as  greenporker   and  gimmesanchez  .  March 3  2009   My doctor says that I have 2 more years to live.  I don t care.  That s what they said about Stephen Hawking.  May 17  2009   It has become impossible to move.  I now live full-time at Torchy s.  I am hooked up to an IV that pumps a steady stream of Diablo Sauce into my veins.  My butler has quit.  I drift in and out of consciousness.  Life seems cruel and  yet  somehow strangely beautiful.  This is all I know  this is all there is  and I cannot imagine anything beyond these fantastic  horrific taco walls.     Four stars.
Torchy's Tacos,484,Where else can you find a Republican giving a Democrat a Dirty Sanchez in a  Trashy  Trailer Park  Torchy s  that s where  These gourmet tacos are a bit on the pricey side  but boy are they good. They also load their tacos up so you won t experience an empty bite. I usually down 3 to 4  but I eat more than the average person. The four mentioned above are my most favorites  but I have to say I love them all.   This place seems to be jam packed all the time and the location sucks ass mainly because of the parking. I ve seen a wreck happen here as it s so hard to get in and out so watch out  Avoid the bathrooms at all cost unless you want to pick up a mysterious illness. I m surprised they haven t broken any sanitary codes at this location. It s definitely a hot mess. So bypass the parking and bathroom and you re good to go 
Torchy's Tacos,485,Really great tacos  great drinks and great customer service. The bartenders here are great and drinks comes out cold and refreshing     Pro tip  if there s huge line when you walk in  just sit down at the bar area for faster service  and to skip the line 
Torchy's Tacos,486,The newest addition to the Torchy s family brings meat and tortilla nirvana to the unwashed hordes of north campus.  Everything you love about the other locations  but now with more college girls in running shorts.  5 amazing salsas make ordering breakfast tacos anywhere else pretty much pointless.  Diablo Tomatillo Roja Poblano Chipotle - the 5 horsemen of the culinary apocalypse.
Torchy's Tacos,487,Get a Dirty Sanchez. If it s a weekend morning or a weekday afternoon  get it to go.  MMM.    runners-up include the fried avocado and your favorite three-ingredient breakfast taco combo. xoxo. This location is not pleasant for sitting  for that go to the William Cannon spot. 
Torchy's Tacos,488,G  This is my first time here  what do you recommend   Waiter  Well the Ace of Spades is ridiculous and everyone gets the pork   G  One of each mate  Waiter  Fuck yea  G   Breaks into air guitar solo with fog machine and stage flamethrowers    Unfortunately my trip to Torchy s wasn t quite as metal as I have laid out  but it was still damn good.  The Guad venue isn t the nicest looking place ever  and the bathrooms look like someone exploded a toilet paper bomb  but fecal amtter in my food aside  everything that I sampled was quite delicious.  The Ace of Spades is ludicrous with its fried egg  sausage  beef  mayo  and maybe a touch of half a cow. Its certainly could make any male porn star drown his head in shame.  The pork taco was quite nice and had quite a light and refreshing taste and texture to it  despite the fact that it followed the Ace of Spades in the conveyor belt that is my stomach.  I have to say that I really like this place  though I have to say that Taco Deli is still much closer to my heart and genitalia references.  Taco amore  Gabriel
Torchy's Tacos,489,We went into Torchy s Tacos to see if they are the best tacos in Austin.  We order the following   Chicken Fajita Taco - grilled chicken breast  onions  peppers  cheese  amp  pico Baja Shrimp - battered shrimp  coleslaw      onions   jalapenos Brushfire - jamaica jerk chicken  jalapenos  mango  diabolo sauce  All tacos were devoured and delicious.  All meat are seasoned on the spicy side and the veggies are fresh.  The brushfire was a nice combination of spicy and sweet.  If you get an order of chips and salsa  you get a large serving of chips.  Torchy s Tacos is a perfect fast  healthy choice for Mexican.  Next visit - the trashy Trailer Park taco.
Torchy's Tacos,490,OH MY GOOD GODS   Today  on my birthday  I decide to pop my Torchy s Taco cherry.  I like trying new things on holidays and birthdays.  Yes  until today  I had never experienced this culinary delight.  Since I was having lunch with a friend at 1 30pm  I thought I could wait until then to eat.  Sadly  I could not.  I walked myself over from Spiderhouse for a snack before lunch.    The location was a little crowded at noon  but that s no big deal.  Standing works.  I noticed the guy preparing the food behind the counter staring at me.  It looked like he was staring at my tits.  Then the other one was staring at my tits.  It got a little awkward.  The guy behind the counter started staring when I was ordering green chili pork taco.  Then the guy behind the counter leans over to the clerk and says   Look at her shirt.   They giggle.  Whew  they were looking at my shirt and not my tits.   Oddly enough  my new shirt from the Spy Museum in Washington  Dc has gotten me more attention than any other article of clothing ever has.  It s bright red and it reads in bold print   A Ninja swiped my Homework      Now that the weird sexual tension of ordering a green chili pork taco with 4 sets of eyes on my chest was over  I proceeded to find a seat. That was weird.  Really weird.  There weren t very many open  so I sat at a table kind of squished between some businessmen and the front door.  My food was ready in 3 minutes  and I wondered if Torchy s would live up to the hype.    After applying the green sauce and rolling it up  I took a bite.  This was a life changing experience.  This was the BEST taco I ve had  so far.  The tortilla tasted fresh  the pork tasted as if it had been slow cooked for hours in its own fat.  If I was religious  I might have changed religions to the Torchy s Taco Cult.    Wow.  It was good.  I will make it a point to visit all the other Torchy s by this weekend s end.  I will have more tacos.  Ohhhh my....... Torchy lust.  Sorry  Michael Phelps  I have a new crush.  No longer will I dream of holding the 8 Olympic gold medal winner in my arms.  Now I ll only dream of tacos  Torchy s tacos.
Torchy's Tacos,491,To call in an order here call    512 494-TACO   I tried calling the number listed above for this location to put in a pick up order and its actually the co-owners cell phone    He seemed a little flustered  I could tell I wasn t the first to call him lookin for the new location. SO anyway  until yelp updates the business info the number for the new Guadalupe location is  512 494-TACO   8226   I have reviewed another Torchy s before and mostly just wanted to put the correct number on here if anyone else needed it. So  the only thing I can add is location specific  my to-go order yesterday was delicious and ready in 10 mins  exactly how long they said it would take. And the guys working were nice and friendly.  Since trying Torchy s for the first time last month I have become ADDICTED to the green chili pork taco. Its sooooo wonderfully delicious  I ve been getting it at least once a week...mmmmmmmm
Torchy's Tacos,492,Dear Austinites   Torchy s Tacos while probably the best taco place in Austin  is still mediocre. I ve eaten there several times in an effort to try several different items on the menu. Never has Torchy s given me the quality tacos that I grew up on in San Antonio. This is the case for several reasons   1. CRAPPY TORTILLAS. Home made or go home  The tortilla is more than mere transportation of innards it provides the counter balance to the different flavors of the taco filling. Think about the difference between using wonder bread and artisan bread for a sandwich. Torchy s doesn t make their own tortillas which equals bad tacos  this is pretty much the case for most taco places in the ATX area .  2. I m pretty sure they use canned chilies in their queso. While their queso isn t horrible  a step above velveeta with some pace picante mixed in  it is surely something that has been canned at some point.   3. The chips are consistently stale or slightly off somehow. This has been the case for the 8 or so times I ve ordered the queso.  4. Now the main dish...Their tacos are always overstuffed and I have a theory about colonialism and overstuffed tacos but I ll spare the yelp readers. For now I ll say that it is a sign of over compensation for the lack of flavor. The taco is all about the balance of the ingredients  see point 1  and overstuffing a taco is a sure sign of merely trying to fill stomachs rather than satisfy tastebuds  see the hungryman frozen entree motto .   5. The dirty Sanchez. We see colonial racist tones again occur in the Torchy s approach to tacos. I ll be heavy handed and say that this is invoking histories of racial oppression of Mexican people. I realize this isn t directly related to the flavor of food but it certainly leaves a bad taste in my mouth.   6. The service is pretty bad. Unaffected  white  badly tattooed  hipsters sling your order up on the counter with a smirk while you re forced to squeeze through the absurdly long line spilling out of the tiny restaurant. While they will help you out  its only with much reluctance and attitude that they do so.   7. Lastly  though I could go on about specific tacos I have tasted but that might be a follow up review  this place is OVERPRICED. I m totally down for local business prices being a little higher but this is a joke. Over twenty dollars for 4 tacos  chips and queso and two fountain drinks is ridiculous  especially considering my aforementioned points about the lack of flavor and cheap ingredients.   If I weren t Mexican and if i hadn t  eaten tacos my whole life I too might have given torchy s the four or five star rating but this is not the case. I am Mexican and have eaten tacos my whole life and find this place on par with taco cabana or slightly better than taco bueno and taco bell. Except each of those places charges significantly less for their tacos. I deeply believe that Austinites need to take that short trip down to San Antonio to get some good tacos or if you have time go further to the Valley  they have great Mexican food there as well . Austin s taco scene is a joke.   Sincerely  Daniel
Torchy's Tacos,493,I had the grande burrito  amp  queso. I had no idea when I ordered it that it was a  table for two  size queso. I was hadn t paid yet  so I thought we could take that off  but the counter guy just gave me the stink eye. He didn t ask me if I wanted a drink.  He didn t tell me where to pick up the queso.  He put it out of reach at the edge of his side of the counter where my 5 4  couldn t straddle the table with the lids and straws to reach.  Hint  rest of crew  if you share in the counter tips tell Mr. Dark Hair Dead-Behind-the-Eyes to be a little more personable. Passive aggressive generally results in no tip. As it did Monday.   The burrito was uneven. All the rice at one end  all the guacamole at the other. When I bite into a beef burrito  amp  get a mouthful of nothing but squish  it doesn t add up. I opened it up and stirred the contents  but it really wasn t a burrito anymore .   I ll probably go by here again  but I won t spend that much money. Skip the mushy burrito. Oh  and guys  Ask Changos  Miltos  Taco Shack  Trudy s  etc.   the gray haired lady might not be too hip  but she s spent more than 30 years in some form or another in customer service. Getting stiffed by me is a rarity. Congrats.
Torchy's Tacos,494,Disappointed in the food here. When hearing that I was visiting Austin  2 different friends recommended that I eat here  so I was very excited to try it  I got 3 tacos  beef  pork  and fried avocado. Of the 3  the fried avocado was the best.. most likely because it has a good sauce that comes on the side. Overall the tacos were very bland and flavorless  I m used to eating at Mas Tacos Por Favor in Nashville  it was on DDD  so I guess I was expecting similar quality tacos here - unfortunately they were just  meh 
Torchy's Tacos,495,Fast-casual tacos  order at the counter  take a seat  and someone brings them to you  for  4.00 a piece is pretty much in vogue in many cities nowadays  Chicago included  and Torchy s does it well. Had the Mr. Pink  tuna  and Baja Shrimp. I preferred the shrimp  but both were loaded and quite tasty. From ordering to receiving our food took about ten minutes on a Thursday at dinner time  so quite reasonable. Again  these are not traditional tacos by any means  but a nice treat every now and then.
Torchy's Tacos,496,I m shocked that I haven t reviewed this place yet  considering how many Torchy s tacos I ve eaten since I ve lived in Austin.  I ve tried all of the tacos on the menu  minus breakfast   but I always come back to my favorites  The Democrat and Green Chile Pork.  Mmmm The Democrat combines beautiful tender barbacoa beef with creamy avocado  spicy raw white onion  queso fresco  and cilantro. Simple  but addictive. The Green Chile Pork taco comes with slow-roasted pork carnitas cooked with green chiles  providing a subtle hint of smoky and sweet   topped with onions  queso fresco  and cilantro.  The Crossroads  beef brisket  grilled onion  cilantro  avocado  jack cheese  jalapeno  is also AMAZING  but it seems like the campus location doesn t have it  I ve only had it at the Spicewood location .  Don t get me started on the salsa. They must put crack in the stuff because it is SO tasty. I can t pick a favorite  so don t ask.  My only two complaints are  slightly pricey for tacos  but you get a LOT of filling   and there should be more locations. I want Torchy s to be as ubiquitous as Starbucks so I can always fulfill my Torchy s craving no matter where I am. Come to think of it  why don t we just convert all Taco Bells to Torchy s. Because Torchy s is a bajillion times more delicious than dog food.
Torchy's Tacos,497,Don t get the Torchy s love.    Tacos are pretty boring.  Wanna be interesting  but fail.  Fried Avocado - don t taste any avo  just beans. Jamacian Jerk Chicken  or whatever it s called  - the chicken is dry and it is NOT spicy. Green Chili Pork -  yawwwwwwwn  Corn tortillas - dry  crumbly  and fall apart way too easily.  The only taco that is sort of good is the Democrat.  But it s regret-good.  Tasty  but greasy  and no guarantee you ll feel great later.  And what s with the surly service   When I walk up to the counter and say  hi   and you stare back with your pen hovering above the order pad  I guess small talk is out and I better just know what the hell I want.    I won t flat out refuse to go to Torchy s  hence the two stars   but I ll only go if someone else wants to go.  And I can t talk them into somewhere better.
Torchy's Tacos,498,Fried Avocado Taco   Poblano creamy ranch sauce   heaven  ironic    Definitely some damn good tacos 
Torchy's Tacos,499,Good Beer. Good Tacos. Good Queso. Good Atmosphere. What else can you ask for   This location is a little tricky getting in and out of because of the busy street.
Torchy's Tacos,500,If you want something fried  delicious  and smothered in a creamy delicious sauce  get the Dirty Sanchez  the Trailer Park  or the Fried Avocado tacos. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.   the queso is not too bad either .
Papalote Taco House,1,Stopped by on a weekend for takeout the other day  and so glad we did  We ve passed it maaaany times and finally decided we should try it. After ordering the food was ready in about ten minutes.  Torta Cubano  soooo good and soooo filling  Honestly could probably feed two.  Mole taco  forgot the exact name   would absolutely get again.  Breakfast taco  perfection   Basically couldn t ask for much more.. generous portion sizes of well cooked  well seasoned  delicious tacos and tortas 
Papalote Taco House,2,Food  3 5 Ordered the Bacon  Potato  Egg  and Cheese breakfast taco. The overall flavor was lacking at Papalote  and that all began with the bland tortillas and lack of spices. However  the eggs  potatoes  and bacon were all cooked to perfection. For the price point  you really can t complain.   Service  3 5 The service appeared very disorganized and the food runners were unsure where to bring the food.   Environment  3 5 While the restaurant was clean  it really lacked seating and was honestly an awkward setup for a dining room.
Papalote Taco House,3,Needed a quick and cheap lunch and never been to Papalote in my 4 years in Austin. Not bad  not bad. Not gonna drive across town for it  but I enjoyed it yesterday. Got a breakfast taco and another one  was too spicy for me  and a horchata all for around  10.
Papalote Taco House,4,Wow   Clean  nice and tasty.  My wife got some kind of ham and cheese taco while I had a Cubano torta breakfast thing.  Delicious.  Tacos are a norm in Austin  but looking at the menu here you quickly see they stand apart from the rest--we have to come back just to test out more unique items.  Can t wait 
Papalote Taco House,5,Went here after a long  hot day climbing at the greenbelt. It was very satisfying  I got 2 tacos - one alambres and one pastor which were quite filling. My friends all got the torta cubana and it was gigantic  Restaurant only had a few other people in it  and food was ready within a couple minutes.
Papalote Taco House,6,Papalote has several locations across Austin. We went to the one in North Lamar. They are as authentic as you would find in Mexico City. They make fresh tortillas and salsa.  I started with an order of the Al Pastor and the Churizo Classic. I think I messed up during ordering cause I asked for corn and they gave me flour. Never the less the tacos were bomb. The best Al Pastor I have had in a while. The salsa was lip smackingly spicy  just the way I like it. I also tried tostada De Rajas which was great vegetarian option. We also tried their Plantain dessert Plantain Con Crema   which was brilliant as well. They do have great vegan and vegetarian options. The staff is kind and very friendly. It s a local business that needs your support. Make sure to give them a try when you are in Town  
Papalote Taco House,7,Meal was good and relatively quick.   I would probably look up the menu before going because it s just up on the wall and you have to order at the counter. There weren t really very many flexible options - for example  the only chicken offered came cooked in a mixture with specific seasoning and peppers.
Papalote Taco House,8,Great taco.  I live by the Research Blvd one.  Kept seeing as I drove by.  Finally stopped and definitely will again. Good tacos.  Good price.
Papalote Taco House,9,I really don t understand what all the hype is about this place. Tacos are Mediocre at best... they lacked flavor from lack of seasoning. The breakfast tacos are almost entirely eggs  which seems to be a common trend with other locations.   Unless there s a Different Category of Taco now...under a Flavorless Taco Category  then I would say these guys are Winners.  Service was great. Everyone we spoke to was very friendly. But unfortunately  their tacos weren t as awesome.  To those reviewers who gave more Stars...i really hope Someday you get to taste a 5 star taco. I just don t see the lustre is in giving a score that high to this joint.
Papalote Taco House,10,I go here every time I want to tasty taco. Their sauces are delicious - you have to get them out of there chilled soda box. The tacos have the right amount of each ingredient. The time between ordering and eating a taco is minimal. The location On Congress and Lamar well sir equally delicious tacos but the location on Congress has the addition of barbecue smoked on site.
Papalote Taco House,11,The tacos weren t bad at all. They were pretty unique and different  I will say. I d probably come back   
Papalote Taco House,12,I love the tacos. One of my favorites is the guajalote en mole on a flour tortilla. Their breakfast tacos are also delicious. The staff is always friendly. I recommend all locations.
Papalote Taco House,13,My brother had previously gone to Austin and raves about this taco place so of course I had to make it my first stop as soon as we arrived in Austin. We each ordered 3 tacos -- keep in mind that we are used to California tacos which are pretty small but Texas tacos are 6 inches so it was a pretty huge portion. The have a pretty extensive taco menu and my favorite was the adobada. The chorizo breakfast taco was pretty good too. You also get a choice between corn or flour tortillas.
Papalote Taco House,14,First time here and I was impressed  The taco combos are unique and really good filling.  I tried the rajas y hongos and a veggie breakfast taco  served all day    And on the side I got the rajas con crema with corn tortilla chips. The dip is wonderful on the tacos too  There are many more tacos to try but these that I chose were outstanding   I ordered pickup which was a breeze. Arrived 10 minutes early and they had my food ready.   Overall  had a great experience between the ordering process and quality enjoyment of the food.
Papalote Taco House,15,Excellent food in a great casual setting. It s like fast food in terms of time  but feels like you re eating some delicious home cooking. Their meats are tender and nicely seasoned. Friendly service too 
Papalote Taco House,16,I had lunch here a couple years back and remember it being really really good I remember having the tlacoyos and really enjoying them. Recently went back and the service was great food was ok not what I remembered   but not anywhere near bad. Buddy that I went with really enjoyed it and he s a meat eater through and through  I am not . Definitely a place that you have to visit consistently. Not bad by any means just didn t wow me this time.  With all that said I did however chose to come back so that means they are doing something right  Will update review after a few more visits
Papalote Taco House,17,Pretty average weak tacos. They weren t bad but with all the options here in Austin I would prefer somewhere else.
Papalote Taco House,18,I got the alambres taco theres so much going on in this taco  amp  the flavor is unique.. I would say an acquired taste I m not sure. I don t really want to finish the taco so that s why it s 2 stars. It looks appetizing but the flavors just aren t there for me   Sucks but it is what it is innit   Soup peddler next door for the W  Salsa isn t bussin for me either btw
Papalote Taco House,19,I love this spot  They have the best lunch special in town. If you re vegetarian they have the best veggie tacos
Papalote Taco House,20,Tacos were good overall  just not  best tacos i ve ever had  compared to all of the available food trucks  amp  restaurants in austin
Papalote Taco House,21,I ordered Papalote a few months ago through one of the food delivery services. On my way to work this morning  I stopped at Papalote to order some tacos for myself and a couple of my co-workers. The service was quick and efficient. The corn tortillas do not tear. The migas have wonderful cheese on them and sliced avocado. They were savory and full of flavor. The sauces were a perfect pairing for the migas  The order taker was amazing   I will definitely be back.
Papalote Taco House,22,Excellent taco stop with a bunch of classics but also some fun creations such as a shredded turkey with a sweet mole sauce and a vegetarian one with mushrooms. My favorites were the beef tongue and the mushroom one  I also got corn tortillas and they were fresh and pliant and flavorful. They have two kinds of hot sauces and both are spicy and assertive. Tacos are about  3.85 apiece  so a pretty good deal  I really like how generous the fillings were and that they had all of these little sauces and condiments that amped up the flavor and texture.
Papalote Taco House,23,Excellent little spot for variety of tacos... you can get pretty much any kind. I really enjoyed the ceviche tostada  made of shrimp and fish. The tacos and their dipping sauces were great. Pretty decently priced for the volume of food in the taco.
Papalote Taco House,24,Decent taco spot  but there are better options in Austin. Not a lot of meat filling  and fairly expensive for the size. Tried the Al pastor and cecina. Neither really stood out. The ceviche tostada was super salty. Tacos were ready quickly.
Papalote Taco House,25,As Maria s no longer exists  I ve stopped here a couple times for breakfast. They ve expanded their footprint and menu but haven t improved on quality or consistency. It s okay but there are better tacos out there.
Papalote Taco House,26,The service is really great. We ordered the banderilleros  tlacoyos  and rice. The banderilleros were suprisingly not my favorite. The inside was a tad bland. I ordered the tlacoyos for my little one not realizing that it was a bit spicy. The gentleman at the register realized that she was not a fan and brought her some refried beans to eat with her rice. I then tried her food and enjoyed it later. We did order hibiscus fresca and enjoyed that very much and their rice is not the orange Spanish rice but it is absolutely delicious and we ordered a second one on the way out. I would love to try more menu items but will be back for even the tlacoyos  rice  and beans. I don t know if I would have tried this had it not been too spicy but it was so delicious and refreshing.
Papalote Taco House,27,If you re looking for some good Mexican Food  this place ain t it. It s decent food with different types of flavorings than you re typically used to but I was expecting more from all the positive reviews. My food was cold when I got it and you could tell it had been sitting for a while. Prices are no different than torchy s tacos. Probably won t try again.
Papalote Taco House,28,My favorite tacos in Austin. I always order the Guajolote en Mole taco  perfect shredded turkey in a rich  complex mole sauce  and the lengua taco  beef tongue . The employees are sweet and hospitable and always accommodating. The salsas are exceptionally good. The icing on the cake is their to-go frozen margaritas. And if you re looking for a sweet treat  order the platanos con crema - shockingly tasty.  chefs kiss 
Papalote Taco House,29,I Love the breakfast tacos. I think it has more flavor than most places. Fast service too.
Papalote Taco House,30,Ordered a few stuff and this picture is tostada de ceviches came with raw shrimps. Disappointed because I ve been craving for shrimps for some time. Threw the whole order away  because do not know if they were cooked or not.
Papalote Taco House,31,We stopped here for some tacos on a Sunday evening at 8 right before they closed.  It was empty.  It truthfully felt like a step up from torchys tacos.  It s a similar fast food restaurant style  which I m not a fan of  but that s my fault for not looking it up.  We got 5 Tacos all on flour tortillas. The tortillas tasted like they were mission-  brand  which felt super low quality. The ingredients tasted fresh and moderately seasoned.  I m not excited to return and it won t be top of my list for food.  Before we left  we saw a young girl go to the condiment station and pour sugar or salt or something on her hand. She licked it off and the. Proceeded to wipe her hand on the water dispenser  to use the condensation to get the rest of it off  I think . Either way  it was really gross and made me not want to eat the food we brought home.  I understand this isn t necessarily the food establishments fault  but it isn t something I want to see in a place that I m eating 
Papalote Taco House,32,Great food  gourmet tacos. Super tasty and vegetarian friendly . I recommend if your looking for something different and unique.
Papalote Taco House,33,It s a crowded field for the title of second best tacos in Austin  because Valentina s on Manchaca has run so far away from the competition that only an act of God could dethrone them.   Enter Papalote. I ve had quite a few of their offerings and most are pretty good. Their cauliflower taco is unique and won the Austin Chronicle award for best vegetarian taco.   My favorite is the pollo a la parilla  which costs  3.50 and consists of spicy chunks of grilled  achiote rubbed chicken  avocado slices  shredded cabbage  poblano peppers and queso fresco. Top it with some of their house made green sauce and get after it. The flour tortillas aren t made in house  which is too bad  but they re always stuffed to capacity with the goods.  Like I said  it s a crowded field for second best taco in Austin  and Papalote can hold its own with most of them.
Papalote Taco House,34,With its roots in Austin  Papalote is one of my favorite taco shops. The tacos are authentic Mexican tacos  without as many frills like you ll see at Torchy s Tacos. If you don t speak Spanish  you might not understand half of the things on the menu but the employees are very nice and will help you figure out what to order. This original Papalote on South Lamar is by far my favorite  the inside is small but they have a small front patio section as well.      What to Order  Adobada taco  Desebrada taco  Al Pastor taco Pros      Authentic and Traditional Tacos  Agua Frescas  South and North Locations Cons  -   Not Very Big Inside  Intimidating Menu for First Timers  Kind of Greasy Al Pastor  but delicious 
Papalote Taco House,35,Nice taco place. The 4 of us shared 5 assortment of tacos And a ceviche tostada.   We ordered a ceviche tostada  Pastor  chicarron  lengua and other tacos.   It was delicious   A order at counter and sit down place With patio seating.
Papalote Taco House,36,Amazing    Every single taco is delicious  flavorful  amp  so fresh. Even the corn tortillas are incredible and so thin and airy.. Pastor was my favorite. Lots of great drinks  amp  the arroz con leche dessert gets 2 thumbs up
Papalote Taco House,37,Probably one of the top 3 taco spots in town no question. I have reviews on the other 3 if you are interested.  Authentic Mexican food with a down home street style vibe. You can t go wrong no matter what you pick just know it s going to be fresh and super delicious.  They just expanded their spot on south Lamar so there is some decent dining going on too  My favorite is the classic chorizo on flour with a Pina Jarritos. Don t miss this spot 
Papalote Taco House,38,Unassuming but delicious AF.  The carnitas were spot on. The cauliflower was a fried patty that turns to mush  as cauliflower tends to do and not necessarily a bad thing when in between a soft taco shell  doused in this delicious red  spicy sauce...when you combine those extra juices from the cauliflower taco with the plain Jane guacamole  it definitely makes the guacamole worth the  5.99 price tag  super fresh and basically just avocado and jalape o  but skip it if you re wavering between that and queso or another taco .  Some indoor and covered patio seating  along with a couple bottled beers  but definitely not a place you go for ambiance...just tacos. And  be sure to get some of their verde and rojo sauces in the fridge either to enjoy on-site or get some containers to go   I want to return again and again until I ve tried all the tacos on the menu.
Papalote Taco House,39,We never ate at the restaurant but got the Togo food order. The quantity of the food and the quantity was amazing. I would be going back again for sure.
Papalote Taco House,40,Papalote Taco House - Your quintessential  inexpensive  neighborhood taco house. Newly renovated  thank goodness  and looking so fly  it s worth coming down and checking out their takeout options.   My order tonight  - Chips  amp  Queso - Come on y all  don t ever get Mexican food without chips and queso while in Austin. Their Queso is no-nonsense  pure queso that has a delicious consistency and is thin enough to dunk a whole chip in and create the perfect coating. For a neighborhood taco shop  their queso gets an 8 10. What could be better  Add some meat  guac  or pico  - Breakfast taco  eggs  bacon  potatoes  and cheese  - I m obsessed with breakfast at all times of the day so this was a must-try for me. Their breakfast tacos are totally customizable  hearty  and delicious  I wasn t expecting a taco as big as it was and so good  Dip it into the queso for pure bliss. Neighborhood taco shop rating - 9 10 - Tinga De Res Taco - Description  Pulled beef stewed in chipotle  topped with plantains  cabbage  queso fresco  and a slice of fresh avocado. The real reason my review gets only 4 stars is because... I couldn t find any plantains on my taco  I ordered this taco for the plantains and found none... Otherwise  the beef is delicious and suuuuper messy to be ready to be elbow deep in beef juices. Due to the mess-up on my plantain-less taco  my rating is 6 10. - Side salsas - To be entirely honest  and ashamed  I can only handle mild to medium salsas so I hold no verdict on their salsas as they are far too spicy for me. I wish they offered a milder option  I had to use my own at home.  - Platano con crema - Description  Ripped plantains covered with Mexican sweet cream and Parmesan cheese. This was delicious   Not too sweet but the perfect ending to a Mexican meal. Big enough for two to share    COVID-19 update - Curbside does not mean curbside at this location. You will need a mask  appropriately so  to walk in and collect your meal when you order takeout. There is tape on the ground that supposedly guides where to go but honestly it looked kinda like a game of tic-tac-toe. So just smile big with your eyes and go 6ft from the counter.  Would I come back  Absolutely  I love supporting local Austin restaurants and hey  this is a rough time for everyone and their food is still delicious  Rock on Papalote 
Papalote Taco House,41,First  what I liked -  Star 1  they had more than one option for vegetarians Star 2  they were fast and efficient  Star 3  filling was of a good amount Missing Star 1  their sauces are self-service from the fridge and diluted  runny and bland.  Missing Star 2  wish the tables had been wiped clean and same for the overall feel.
Papalote Taco House,42,The tacos tasted great  the tortillas fell apart so a bit messy.  I wished our tacos were served on different plates  but we didn t request that.  They did have all the tables spread out for covid and a one way ordering system.  Overall good place for a taco. 
Papalote Taco House,43,This place never disappoints     The South Lamar location  2803 S Lamar Blvd Austin  TX  78704  fairly recently opened a new dining area and it s fantastic looking. Closed to sit down guests during quarantine  but looks great  We placed a massive TO-GO ORDER and gave them a JUMBO TIP to help out our dear friends.  Of course when we get home and open up our package there are many mini ramekins of that wonderful sauce  the red  Roja  and green  Verde . I recently switched to a plant-based diet and again  their menu doesn t disappoint  Taco options of fried avocado  mushrooms  cauliflower  the hits just keep coming    Their smashed guacamole dip is done to perfection as well.  If you re looking for a change of menu  call in an order to Papalote tonight it s fantastic  your taste buds will thank you   512  804-2474  on South Lamar 
Papalote Taco House,44,my favorite  the turkey mole is delicious  the ceviche tostada is fresh and so good. friendly staff  always fast and my go to.
Papalote Taco House,45,The tostada de ceviche was the best item ordered - filling with good flavors. Taco de carnitas didn t have a lot of flavor  and the taco adobada had too much sauce. This is my friend s favorite taco spot in Austin  so would try again but order differently.
Papalote Taco House,46,The tacos here are OK on a good day  but they aren t five stars by any means. It appears they really nail the ceviche tostada  however. Big chunks of fish along with the shrimp  the tostada had sufficient heft to withstand the moisture on the ride home. The salsa that came with the tostada was an excellent accompaniment. A great quick  fresh and delicious option.
Papalote Taco House,47,Great food  even though it s unassuming and small. The ladies are always working really hard and are very nice.
Papalote Taco House,48,I am a closet Papalote Taco addict. For quite some time I have been stopping at this little joint and picking up a couple of tacos  or if I had the time  to eat in.   Now friends  this is a blue collar  student joint  that is so small you have no room to change your mind  -   . They have a busy carryout flock of customers and seem geared to that. No  the tortillas are not homemade  but the contents more than make up for it.   This place is zero fancy  sticking to getting food out fast. I thought long and hard about what to recommend  but there are so many reviews that I thought I would just stick to my favorite  TINGA DE RES Pulled beef stewed in chipotle  topped with plantains  cabbage  queso fresco  and a slice of fresh avocado. Do not  under any circumstances  try to eat this in a car unless you have a thick towel. Is it the best I ever had  No. However  it is a delicious difference. Would I recommend eating here  Absolutely  even though now and then  depending on the person cooking or prepping  the food can be better or worse or maybe what you were planning to order may not be the best way to go. If you see someone eating something you are interested in  feel free to ask them how it is. Also if there are several people in the little place  feel free to ask them to join you. It is that laidback.
Papalote Taco House,49,Papalote kills the taco game  they re traditional and inventive. The flavors are so familiar and incredible but also super unique. There are a lot of tacos in Austin and these rank with the best.   Recommend  Rajas y Hongos - AMAZING and vegetarian   Pastor Tacos - simply perfect  Cecina Tacos - thin  perfectly grilled steak with other lovely things
Papalote Taco House,50,Very nice people and  and some really good tacos. I eat here at least once a week the staff is courteous and the food is consistently good. They have some of the best and most flavorful tacos I have found in town.
Papalote Taco House,51,Excellent and authentic taste  Was very satisfied with my order - did a doordash delivery which was brought over quickly.
Papalote Taco House,52,My first Papalote experience was 5-star. I went for breakfast tacos  and they didn t disappoint. Contrary to belief  you can mess up a breakfast taco in a number of ways  but these tacos were great. I ordered a potato and bacon and egg  all breakfast tacos come with eggs .  This is usually my go-to breakfast taco for a first visit because the potatoes can tell you a lot about whether a taco spot knows what it s doing. The potatoes were cut in a good small-bite size and were seasoned. The flavors of the taco came together nicely into one nice taco flavor. I m not a fan of eatings tacos where the ingredients are all too individual so it feels like you are eating individual ingredients instead of one cohesive taco. I also ordered the poblano and bacon taco  which was also very good. I will be heading back to try the lunch and dinner tacos.
Papalote Taco House,53,Solid B  tier Austin taco. Its pretty close  to barton springs or the green belt. Usually i come by after. Its traditional style street tacos. It fills a niche similar to Trancas on cesar chavez. The quality is slightly better  but not by much and it is significantly more pricey.   In terms of stand out tacos  the al pastor and the lengua are classics. I feel like al pastor is the baseline for a taqueria and these guys do not disappoint. Salty pork  sweet pineapple. Its the same principal as Hawaiian pizza  but the meat is super tender. The lengua is tender and flavorful too. Stewed to perfection.  The sope is also really good. Ive never had this before coming here. Its an like a taco served on an arepa. The tortilla  which is like the arepa  is super crispy and doughy and good. Ive had beef and chicken. Both are good. The marinade is great.  The thing that keeps the out of A tier in the metagame is price. The tacos are 3.75. They are a little small for that price. Order at least 3 if your hungry. Also  they dont have home made tortillas which keeps them down.  Finally  note that the shop is super tight especially on weekends. Plan on sitting outside. The clientelle is mostly families and high school kids near by.
Papalote Taco House,54,Always a good breakfast or lunch taco I always get the potato egg cheese   or Al pastor  or the pollo alla parilla. Honestly one of my favorite things about this place is the sauce   So don t forget it
Papalote Taco House,55,Got three breakfast tacos - eggs were overcooked  and tortillas were dry. Sauce couldn t even save them   
Papalote Taco House,56,This place is legit.  Handmade tortillas  Tejano music coming from the kitchen  and fair priced food.  Se habla espa ol tambien.  Agua de jamaica  hibiscus  for  2.50 is a STEAL.  Especially considering some places charge  5-6 for it and it s really not all that authentic or tasty.  They also serve a handful of beers for  3.50 B-  and margs on the rocks or frozen. Chips and queso were shared between the table and it hit the spot.  There are also a handful of vegetarian options on the menu.  The menu consists of authentic dishes and the recipes have been in this family owned business for generations.    You can tell that every employee is dedicated to their craft and they re damn good at it too.  Limes are juicy af.  You d be surprised at how many hard sad limes are served at Austin spots.  Salsa is on 10.  Give this place a shot  Support local   
Papalote Taco House,57,Tried this place for the first time. The location is small but the food was outstanding. I recommend the huaraches with adobada meat. Green sauce is really good and spicy.
Papalote Taco House,58,Amazing selection of tacos  extremely flavorful and fresh. Wouldn t hesitate to go back here for lunch or dinner.
Papalote Taco House,59,Was in the area and couldn t decide what to eat for dinner  so we were lured in by the amazing reviews. Unfortunately  I was disappointed. The quest was mostly melted cheese  which then made it feel like a slightly-better-than stadium nacho. I got the adobaba and another beef taco that I can t even remember the name of. The filling was delicious  but both the corn and the flour tortilla tasted store-bought  corn a tad better than the flour. For the price of  3-4 per taco  I expected more.   Customer service was fantastic. Late night drunk food when I m in the area  Yes sign me up. Otherwise prob won t go out of my way to get food here.
Papalote Taco House,60,3.5 STARS  I was a bit hungover from the previous night of drinking but these tacos brought me back to life  Came here with a party of four for our first meal of the day a little before noon. I m from out of town so I wasn t expecting much from tacos since I can get them back at home and for a lot cheaper but this place surprised me. Not only did they give you a choice of tortilla  corn or flour  but the tacos were generously portioned  I  as usual with my eye ordering  thought I could devour three tacos to the face. But when they came out  I knew I had done it again....  face palm .... these babies were a lot bigger than the tacos back at home   Pescado a las Brasas  this one was fairly good. Tilapia was cooked well and soft. A bit bland even with the chipotle sauce so i had to keep adding additional sauces.  3 stars   Hongos Y Epazote  literally a mushroom taco. Had a little spicy kick to it but the taco was just meh... wouldn t order again.  2 stars   Pollo a la Parilla  my favorite of them all  Chicken was marinated nicely  very flavorful. Gave a good amount of chicken.  4 stars   Located in a mini plaza  Papalote is a small little cute restaurant with a handful of staff working. Although not very big  they do have a few seatings inside and outside the restaurant. It s mostly self-served since they have everything like water and sauces in a corner station  but the lady did help me get some cilantro when asked  thanks   Also loved how every taco had a slice of avocado. By the end of my meal with two and half tacos down  I was finally revived     
Papalote Taco House,61,They serve delicious street tacos in a No Frills setting. The prices are reasonable for Austin. The service was fast and the staff pleasant. I like how every taco comes with a healthy slice of fresh avocado as there aren t any vegetable sides. The restaurant was immaculate and my companion and I felt very safe eating there. I am gluten intolerant and had no issues whatsoever. I will happily return. Thanks guys 
Papalote Taco House,62,I predict this place will go out of business. The tacos are over priced  small servings and the tacos aren t freshly made  high they should be for that price  - at all. The salsa is good and so was the customer service but those tacos were mediocre at best. Would recommend their corn specialties. Wouldn t come again.
Papalote Taco House,63,After the previous visit to a restaurant during my quick trip to Austin turned out to be more of an appetizer  I decided I wanted tacos and Hubby surprisingly  perhaps also reluctantly  agreed. He s not a big fan of Mexican food... though he had expressed a vague sense of acceptance towards the simple breakfast taco  which was offered here.   See  we re both vegetarians but don t eat onion and garlic. A lot of American vegetarians seem to love to throw onions and garlic in everything. Might as well go to a steakhouse and order a water and hope that the fries aren t seasoned. I digress. Haha...   I had seen the rest of the menu and saw they had tacos that had more items in it. I was hoping that they could take out the onions. I was hopeful and I asked. Nope  anything cooked technically ran a risk of contamination. At least we had breakfast tacos  they all come with scrambled eggs   we can t add the beans. He got the flour taco with the avocado and tomatoes. Mine had the same thing but also with mushrooms and I opted for corn. We were given a number and they came out in a relatively short period of time on a small metal platter. Mine had two tortillas but flour apparently only comes with one. Mine was also loaded. They were hot and good  not seasoned at all but you had salt and pepper shakers at the table. It s probably why we could have them.   The place is on a small side and the line builds up fast. There are small tables but those also fill up fast and so does that parking lot that it shares with various places on that triangular plot of commercial land. It s largely self serve  utensils and napkins are hung under the counter where you order and you put up your dishes  platter   when you re done  or at least that s what we did. Service was to the point  you aren t necessarily greeted and I stood there for a bit before the lady at the register looked up.   All in all  I did enjoy my tacos. Were they mind blowing  Not quite  but they were fairly good. Hot and full of my add ins. The place could be better as it gets crowded easily. I wish they had more options for us  but I guess I ll take what I can get 
Papalote Taco House,64,YES QUEEN      I m still drooling thinking about these tacos. Seriously - you have to go. This spot will become your new go-to  hole in the wall but down right incredible  places.   See pictures below. I went with a group of all vegetarians  veggie squad as I like to refer to them   so I can t speak to the meat options  sorry carnivores . However  there were a variety of vegetarian vegan options  just ask for no cheese .   My favorite was the cauliflower taco. The seasoning flavor of this was incredible. I can t really describe it more specifically other than you should definitely get it. We also got a fried avocado taco which I had never had something like this before.   My friend got the sweet plantains  see picture  and she ate every last lick of it. Cinnamon  amp  creamy  what more could you ask for. We also got chips  amp  guac  amp  salsa. The salsa was incredible  not too spicy.   They make the tacos right there. We all got the corn tacos but they also have flour options as well. Quick service  would recommend eating in just for the experience. Definitely saw people doing take-out as well which seemed like the move too.
Papalote Taco House,65,Perfect place for a true Austin breakfast taco.  Lots of choices. Ask for migas -- not on the menu.
Papalote Taco House,66,I had the Alambras  Pastor and a Bfast taco.  The first 2 would be 5 starhands down.  For the bfast taco  I thought it was good but nothing crazy - I think it could have used some sauce or spice to bring it to the next level
Papalote Taco House,67,On our way home from Fredericksburg we were passing through Austin looking for a place to eat. We wanted Mexican food like a taqueria but no luck. We came across this place and decided to give it a try. Their menu was very different from what expected but we were hungry. We decided on the cachete tacos which is like barbacoa. They did not disappoint. The meat was so good and clean not greasy at all which is surprising with barbacoa. The green sauce was the best. Can t wait to go back to the Austin area to try something else. They have a unique menu.
Papalote Taco House,68,I ve been meaning to try this little taco joint for a while--but had been challenging myself to seek out more authentic flavors since I m a Torchy s junkie. Turns out  I had misjudged the signage  which looks less like you ll be walking into a family-run tex-mex place and more like a modern  New Austin  taco joint. Don t judge a taco restaurant by its sign--this place is good. The tacos are in the  3 range  which is a little less than competitors but a little more than your neighborhood food truck.  My husband and I shared three tacos and an order of chips and queso. The only deduction is for the queso  since it didn t come out until long after we d finished the tacos and we had to request it twice... we haven t tried it yet  since we had them package it to go  but looking forward to later.  The ingredients are fresh. The tacos are flavorful. Like  so  so flavorful  and perfectly balanced. The spicy meat is topped with cool veggies and queso fresco  or was it cojita  . Sometimes when meat stews in those incredible sauces all day they dry out a bit  but not here. Everything was perfectly cooked  perfectly seasoned  and not overly spicy. My favorite were the crispy beef tacos  which felt more like taquitos  and despite trying to share them with my husband I actually just gobbled them up. Someone else brought up that the flour tortillas don t taste homemade. In retrospect  I agree  but in the moment  it all worked.  The staff is quiet  but nice. It s a small space  so during busy hours expect to wait for a table or just take the tasty tacos to go. I m excited to try their North location  as it s closer to my place  and sample more of the menu 
Papalote Taco House,69,Garbage Salt overload  tasteless tacos   dry pathetic torta With so many great alternatives why choose to eat this junk
Papalote Taco House,70,Great salsas  great service  The guy at the counter recommended the breakfast tacos that he had just had. We went with it and loved them.  One chorizo and one bacon. We also added a tlacoyo which did not disappoint  Oh and the fried avocado taco as the grand breakfast finale was god level.
Papalote Taco House,71,This place is great with lots of vegetarian options  The fried avocado was our favorite and we will for sure be back.
Papalote Taco House,72,The Venue  The seating is adequate for approximately 20-30 people  however the level of comfort is no different than any small hole in the wall joint you favor. The seats are comfortable enough to get the food down  but not made for long-term conversations over coffee.   The Service  Exceptional service  fast to receive food that was still at the correct temperature and accurate to order. Our service woman at the cashier failed to have accurate knowledge of the menu and slightly unhelpful with some simple alternatives instead of pork based dishes.  The Order  x4 Tongue Tacos  Beef  x2 Tilapia Tacos x1 Agua de Jamaica x1 Coca-cola de botella  The Food  The tortillas are not hand made  a seemingly difficult thing to find in most small time Mexican taco places. Unfortunately  this place relies on pre-made tortillas which lacked a true Mexican taste of your Tia up the street making them fresh on the comal. The meat was tasty and fresh  with no weird lingering taste  the seasoning was perfect. The cabbage on the tacos lacked that pickled taste that you often get near coastal waters  it was almost bland. When I asked about the horchata  I wanted to know if it was hand made fresh and as she began to say yes  I further asked if it was powdered  to which she confirmed it to be the fact. This does not constitute  fresh  or  hand made .  The Verdict  It was a decent spot to visit if you re on the run and something quick and a filler between breakfast and dinner  however I will not be returning as it does not meet my need for authentic Mexican cuisine.  My Rating  2 stars means I d eat it since I understand the quality  but given the lack of carne asada or any variety in their beef products  it s highly unlikely I ll return.
Papalote Taco House,73,Just about my favorite in town for quick tacos w vegan options. Love their homemade salsas.
Papalote Taco House,74,This is one of go to Austin taco spots. I usually go with the adobada and pastor tacos. Though I ve never met one of their tacos I didn t like.   The service is always great  and the food matches that. The place is clean  and the food is delivered pretty quickly.   I only trust pastor tacos if they have pineapple on them  If you want authentic  and delicious tacos  you want to be sure to stop in at Papalote Taco House.
Papalote Taco House,75,First time ordered thru grubhub  plantain desert looked delish until I found 2 hairs  s congress location  tacos are good
Papalote Taco House,76,If you don t love divy little hole in the wall taco joints you should probably just keep on scrolling.  If you do love authentic delicious tacos for  3 this is your place.
Papalote Taco House,77,I love that Papalote is consistently great.  I also love that I can eat fish tacos early on a Sunday morning.  I was in a state of ecstasy and was going to get another round of tacos when the radio announced an emergency alert of a tornado in the area.  I suppose only the threat of imminent disaster was going to pry me from my chair.  I did pause and think about it first  though.
Papalote Taco House,78,This is actually my fave taco spot in all of Austin. Torchy s is good if you want more  fusion  tacos but for just some simple  tasty  more authentic tacos  this is my go-to.   The lengua tacos are the best I ve had and their cauliflower taco is amazing and like nothing I ve seen anywhere else.
Papalote Taco House,79,Why do y all say you open at 7 00 online and everywhere else but every time I show up before 8 00 y all are closed. Most people have to be at work before 8 00. I used to eat breakfast here every morning. Now for whatever reason I can t because y all open later than u used to. This has been the case for about 9 months now. At least change the times online so people don t drive there to be denied.
Papalote Taco House,80,Wow- now these tacos were excellent  The breakfast taco is very filling  you can add cactus  poblano peppers etc  but the flavor show stopper was the chorizo. Make sure to grab the salsas from the fridge and enjoy 
Papalote Taco House,81,I tried this place for the first time today with my daughter and her partner. All of us loved the food  The cauliflower tortas were outstanding.  We tried the fish taco  chicken  language  and carnitas--all served with thin cabbage shreds and avocado on moist corn tortillas. Excellent experience  I will definitely go back  
Papalote Taco House,82,Best tacos in town. No exaggeration. The flavors in the food are all balanced to perfection.
Papalote Taco House,83,Not the best place for Lengua but their Carnitas is very yummmy    Pro  Thicker flour tortillas and less greasy than other taco places I have been to   Con  The tacos are kind of dry to me
Papalote Taco House,84,THE BEST AND REAL MEXICAN FOOD IN AUSTIN  Yo soy Mexicana y esto es comida Mexicana verdadera  No yellow cheese crap here. Just flavors that will blow your mind and salsa that ll swell your lips in the most delicious way. Tostada ceviche was amazing  Tacos de pastor  tacos de alambre  tacos TACOS TACOS     NO YELLOW CHEESE SOOOOO D GOOD 
Papalote Taco House,85,Papalote is a little shop on South Lamar that shares a parking lot with the Soup Peddler. There s a few tables inside  a few tables outside  and a whole lot of people getting takeout just because there s no room. Diners bus their own tables  which means that some tables are left fairly dirty. The trash was full when we came  so I had to delicately balance the trash so it didn t fall over.  My ceviche tostada was okay  but the salsa provided was a highlight. The avocado was a bit mushy. I also got a chicharron taco on a corn tortilla - also just okay.   If you re in the area and not feeling Torchy s  Papalote is a quick spot to grab a bite.
Papalote Taco House,86,Got takeout here  Did not take too long and it looks like they are taking proper precautions for covid. Would come back for the tacos again 
Papalote Taco House,87,Tasty    The carnitas was amazing  The PUERCO CON VERDOLAGAS taco was great but has a kick so beware of that. Staff was super sweet and fast service  Two thumbs up
Papalote Taco House,88,Great tacos. Stopped by while passing through town. Great prices and portions. The places was very clean and the staff friendly. We kept talking about how much we enjoyed our lunch here the entire weekend.
Papalote Taco House,89,So you re cruising down south Lamar and you pass penthouse pizza  wheatsville.....and you almost pass up Papalote  when it catches your eye and you have so much fun saying it in your head that you flip a u-turn and head back.  The morning that I walked in the staff in the kitchen was making a pepper paste for their salsa. The staff was chopping up tomatoes and onions while coughing and holding back tears because the chilies that were frying for were throwing down a fight against all their tear ducts   It. Was. Glorious.  I am a simple girl when it comes to a breakfast taco. Black beans   Check  refried black beans   potato  Check. Serranos  Check   And bomb ass salsa  Check.   Cool ppl who keep the place runninga veggie taco menu that has me curious and ready to come back.... Oh....trust me. I ll be back.
Papalote Taco House,90,Authentic street tacos    The guacamole is a 10 10   Don t pass this up    The pastor taco was my favorite  however all the tacos were fantastic except for the breakfast tacos.  The eggs in the breakfast were over fried  which left it crispy  not in a good way .  However all else delicious hole in the wall.
Papalote Taco House,91,I loved this place. We tried a few different taco joints on our trip to Austin and this one stands out the most.   The avocado taco was incredible  as was the lengua. Those were the real standouts for me. Gotta love any place that keeps the salsa in the fridge.  This was exactly what I was searching for in terms of a taco. Thank you Papalote 
Papalote Taco House,92,Excellent taco place  The tacos are fresh and delicious. Each taco is about  3.75 so not the cheapest but still very reasonable for what you get. We got the aquacate  guajolate mole  al pastor  chorizo  cauliflower and alambres. The mole and al pastor tacos were my favorite. We will definitely be back   
Papalote Taco House,93,Incredibly friendly staff  great new expansion of the space and outstanding Tortas.  But why-o-why so stingy on the queso   Homemade chorizo rock solid  by the bye.
Papalote Taco House,94,The mushroom taco is by far the best taco I ve had since moving to Austin.  The salsas are flavorful and spicy   I cannot stop ordering from Papalote 
Papalote Taco House,95,We are here very often and the staff is so friendly and on top of their game  The dining area and bathrooms are always super clean smell clean too  and I feel safe dining drinking here.
Papalote Taco House,96,Unfreaking believable    Brother brought me here for a snack since it was one of my last meals in Austin before heading back to SF.   Ordered the lengua and the Guajolote en Mole. I took a bite of one. Then the other. Then one. Then the other. I can t pick a favorite  They were both absolutely delicious in their own way. Ohmygosh.  Whatever the house sauce is that the beef tongue is covered in is crack and you should savor every bite. On the other hand  that sweet mole sauce is absolutely perfection and probably the best mole I ve ever had  top of life  yo  .   I regret not taking 50 of each to go because I was thinking about them later. I don t doubt their other tacos are just as delish  but these set a pretty high bar.  Trust me when I tell you that you NEED these to be part of your life  with the red salsa on top .
Papalote Taco House,97,This place is the BEST     I have never eaten better tacos. Their queso is also AMAZING    The workers are extremely friendly. The atmosphere isnt the best but it seems authentic. The one thing I didnt care for as much was their chips which tasted a little stale and a little like cardboard. The cheese was so good that it masked what the chips lacked. This place is a must when in Austin if you re feeling tacos.
Papalote Taco House,98,I found the menu overwhelming and hard to navigate. The tacos were dripping in oil and sauces  and tasted more like a mix of ingredients put together than a harmonious  delicious taco experience.   I ordered the plantains too  and they were just not up to par  still on the hunt for good ones...haven t found them here or at a few Cuban places I ve tried . Too starchy and not properly caramelized  they tasted more savory even though they are on the dessert menu.   Restaurant is tiny  bathrooms are pretty dirty  parking lot is cramped. Service is friendly and food was fast.
Papalote Taco House,99,Taco Mecca.  This hole in the wall joint is playing at the highest level.   I struggle to see what they could improve.  The carnitas and Al pastor were my favorite.  The horchata is on point.  The sauces - on point.  It s... Perfect.
Papalote Taco House,100,My mission in Austin was to find and eat the best BBQ and tacos. I noticed that many of the taco joints there have a huge tex-mex influence and or have a fusion thing going on. Having already gone to Torchy s  I was feeling something more simple and authentic.   Papalote has two taco menus - one is called  Classics   and the other  Tacos.  The tacos on the  Tacos  menu didn t seem to crazy. They were still made up with classic ingredients but with more stuff on them  but for me  the Classics was just what I was looking. I got the pastor and the lengua on corn. Both were great and filled with meat  I haven t had lengua in a while so it totally hit the spot. The lengua ended up coming out on a flour tortilla  but good thing the pastor was on corn. Like always  I got two corn tortillas so I ate the pastor taco carefully with one tortilla and used the other tortilla for the lengua.   Don t forget the squeeze bottles of salsas in the fridge. They have a salsa roja and a salsa verde. They both pack some heat but the salsa verde was my favorite.   Overall  Papalote is a great place for a quick  cheap  and good taco 
Papalote Taco House,101,Just terrible....no words. Honestly probably the worst tacos I ve had in my 2.5 years in Austin. I had 3 tacos  lengua  check  carnitas. And honestly I couldn t tell which was which. The tortillas are somehow worst than store bought. I also ordered horchata  this seemed homade but waaaayyyy to watery and took forever to get. If you know my reviews you know I like authenticity and sadly this place was the furthest thing from.
Papalote Taco House,102,Only breakfast tacos ever offering potatoes cooked to perfection  not fried. Saut ed mushrooms   They cook the eggs with your choices  to order-- they don t just slap the separately cooked ingredients together in the wrapper. And the corn tortillas taste daily-made-perfect fresh. He was over the moon for the chicharron option and they had other unique tasty options like calabaza squash  cactus  and poblanos. Tiny  impressive spot.
Papalote Taco House,103,Austin has a ton of tacos  but I ve gotten to really like Papalote.  They don t over stuff the tacos and there is enough variety that everyone can find something they like - whether it s on the slightly sweet yellow corn or flour tortillas.  They even have some more tacos to challenge those a little faint of heart - beef tongue and cheeks    Toss on a little green or red sauce that you can get from the drink fridge  they re both spicy so don t be fooled into thinking the green sauce is tame .    For me - old reliables are always the Alambres  Pescado a Las Brasas and Puerco Con Verdolagas.  This Papalote shares parking with Thundercloud and Soup Peddler so things can get a little tight.
Papalote Taco House,104,I don t really get why this place is a thing.   Sure  the tacos are very fresh and cheap  particularly the lunch special   and the staff is very nice  but there is no way to get around the fact that the food tastes SUPER BLAND  both times I ve had it . Maybe I ve just been spoiled by delicious Tex-Mex taco places like Tacodeli and Torchy s.  Thing is  places like Taco Joint have similar style fresh Mexican tacos but with much more flavorful juicy meat.
Papalote Taco House,105,My family and I love Papalote. We frequently eat at the South Lamar and South Congress locations. The food and service are alway top notch  I am really surprised to see a couple of bad reviews  but I guess some people who are probably just Negative Nancy s have to find something to complain about.....  The Alambres on flour is one of my favorites.
Papalote Taco House,106,Papalote offers an authentic taco experience  not a fancy one with a modern twist you could find in a lot of trendy Austin restaurants.   There are many options to choose from. For the most part  they are classic and simple 2-3 ingredient tacos  but they taste great.  The seating area is limited. If you choose to seat outside you will be just steps away from the busy South Lamar street.   The service is very fast and extra friendly.  Overall it s a cute neighborhood taco shop that you should definitely check out if staying in South Austin.  Great for breakfast and lunch.
Papalote Taco House,107,Keep going - pass Torchy s and find Papalote Taco House instead     I have been searching for new places close to work I had not been and this place came up on my yelp app.  I decided to find it and check it out.  It is right at Manchaca and Lamar next to Thundercloud sub shop.  This place is pretty small on the inside  but they have some seating out front as well.   I looked over the menu and decided to go with the classic pastor taco  the tostada de ceviche and the hibiscus aguas frescas to drink.  My drink was so delicious   My tostada and taco came out and were delivered to my table.  I immediately noticed the tostada de ceviche was piled high with ceviche   The pastor had little bits of pinapple in it just like it should.  Each of them came with a fresh lime to squeeze on top.  Both were awesome  but I would say the tostada was probably my favorite.    The prices here were decent and a bit cheaper than Torchy s.  If you ask me I would pass Torchy s any day and hit up Papalote 
Papalote Taco House,108,Great tacos. Chicken  pork  and beef tacos were all great  I would totally order again 
Papalote Taco House,109,Giving this place 3 stars because their speciality dinner lunch tacos are great  however breakfast sucks... ordered the sausage egg and cheese and the cheese was cold and only 4 pieces of something that I guess is sausage   
Papalote Taco House,110,I really love the breakfast tacos here. they aren t greasy and have good flavor. i keep it simple and usually get eggs and avocado sometimes bacon. only complaint is parking. parking sucks here. there are too many businesses for the amount of spaces they have here.
Papalote Taco House,111,Really enjoyed this place. It was quite a hike to find it. I was tracking it down hard via Google Earth and found it nestled between two other spots. In their shadows but definitely shining.  There s not a whole lot of seating options. Maybe three seats for two outside and about twice that crowded inside. Don t let that turn you away because the food is just wonderfully hand-made. I started off with the  Tinga de Res   pulled beef stewed in chipotle  plantains  cabbage  queso fresco and avacado. It was devine. It was a nice stewey flavor but I couldn t seem to taste the plantains. I was expecting them sliced like the avacado. I am a big mole fan so the  Guajolote en mole  was a treat. A ton of shredded turkey on that beast and it was SPICY. In a good way that just spanked my tongue. The sweet  savory  hot mole sauce destroyed the taste of cabbage and the avacado was a weak fire extinguisher.   The only thing that seriously bummed me out was when I realized how far from my usual haunts I had to go to check this place out. I only hope there s a reason to go out of my way again so I can sample more of the menu.
Papalote Taco House,112,Wow  why is this place not more busy   Some of the best original taco s   made from scratch...  This is some delicious stuff.   Carnitas with pickled onions  alahambres  el pastor was all great.   Food was up super fast and if your GF they were knowledgeable about menu and ingredients.   Fresh corn tortillas were excellent.
Papalote Taco House,113,Very authentic and delicious tacos  Their vegetarian selection is the most extensive I have ever experienced in the Mexican food scene.   The cauliflower taco was a five star item  It was very meaty yet very light  The salsa also gave it a nice depth and balance.  The zucchini and poblano pepper taco was also excellent. Very soft  and succulent. It s soaked up the salsa very well. I highly recommend it.  The fish taco and fried avocado taco was very average and unremarkable.  The homemade sauces were very good.  Overall  great hole in the wall experience. One of the many places that make Austin weird.
Papalote Taco House,114,I was really wanting some good breakfast tacos in Austin  so of course we looked on Yelp to find those great breakfast tacos  but we were slightly disappointed with the Yelpers on this one. The tacos were OK  but certainly nothing that stood out as OMG  I have to have these tacos and I cannot wait until the next time I m back in Austin to eat these tacos. The sauce was decent and I had some kind of sweet Mexican drink that was also delicious but I just can t say anything other than these are average tacos.
Papalote Taco House,115,Papalote is one of the best taco spots in Austin. My favorite is the mole taco. The salsas are on point also.
Papalote Taco House,116,Two stars for the service and salsa. I don t see how this place is rated so highly. I have been here twice and both visits the lengua was rubbery  not the beefy tenderness we all know and love. The Cubana torta was not impressive either. Another overrated place in an overrated city.
Papalote Taco House,117,Round two  because of success of the first visit  back again.  Today  Tinga de res    recommended    puerco con verdolagas  cachete  pollo a la prilla  aguacate con queso  puerco en pipian  cecina.  All were good and would be a great choice  but sure fire winners...tinga  pipian. It s actually hard to go wrong.  Least flavorful was cecina compared to the other tacos we tried.  It is a tiny place  so a large group would overwhelm available seating  maybe 15 seats total   But it is a great taco stop in a town known for tacos.
Papalote Taco House,118,Excellent but small taco place with a few tables outside as well.  I had the beef alambre tacos.  Delicious and tender beef.  Excellent salsas.  I d love to try some of the other tacos - there s a huge selection    Will definitely be back.
Papalote Taco House,119,Been going here since they opened so I m definitely biased.  Its one of the best authentic tacos in Austin.    Alhambras is at the top of the menu.  Get it  Further down is cauliflower.  Get that too.   They have their own ice tea blend. Which is also great.   Don t let the small size of the south Lamar location fool you. This place is legit
Papalote Taco House,120,These were among the best of the many breakfast tacos I tried during my short stay in Austin.  It s a small place with a few seats inside and a few more out front. We ordered   - Breakfast Taco with Bacon  Egg  amp  Potatoes   1.95  - so cheap and so delicious. The thing that set it apart from a number of other places was the delicious tortilla. It was slightly chewy with great flavor. The bacon and potatoes were chopped up and nicely distributed throughout the fluffy pile of scrambled eggs.  - Alambres Taco   3.25  This was really good too  with a generous amount of steak and creamy avocado. Again  those tortillas are excellent.  - Banderillas   3.75  These were very good  but I can t help but compare them to taquitos  which are quite similar  only better. This consists of 3 rolled  fried beef tacos. The problem is that they are covered in red and green sauce  which while tasty  have the unfortunate effect of making the crispy  fried shells soggy. Otherwise  they are delicious and worth a try.  More pleasant than just a truck  especially if it s way too hot out  this storefront is a great place to come for some really excellent Mexican food for breakfast  lunch or dinner.
Papalote Taco House,121,The tacos at this place are unbelievable.  I love the thin corn tortillas and the many choices. I tried the shredded Turkey with mole sauce. Wow  so much flavor. Worth every penny  can t wait to come back.
Papalote Taco House,122,Excellent mexican food.  Our favorite is the Tostada s De Ceviche  and the Peacado A Las Brasas
Papalote Taco House,123,Outstanding customer service  Great and well done food way better  than the other locations. I drove a hour to try this location and  I like this place better to be honest  5 plus rate.
Papalote Taco House,124,Ay look--tacos are everywhere in Austin. They re north  they re south  in trucks  in busses  in yards  Hell  I think I ve seen local Girl Scout troops selling tacos instead of cookies because  when asked  they replied   This is Austin. We know our market.  Well played  Scouts.  Papalote serves excellent tacos. Plain and simple. I almost hesitated posting this because I want to adopt it as my joint and keep it a secret to avoid lines forming. Alas  that would not be fair to the folks at Papalote.   The space is small  brightly lit  and has those chairs that make a SKREEEE sound when you pull them out  but it s all good. You wanna be a fancy pants  then take it to Dallas  Bub. On my particular trip I went with the al pastor and the tinga de res and I kicked it off with some guacamole. All of it was tay-ay-ay-stee  While I think the sauce in the al pastor could mute the tomato flavor  the pork was on point  A quick heads up  the pork is stewed and not sliced off a spit. If you re an al pastor purist  this will bother you. If you re someone who likes to eat  it will not.   The tinga de res was right up there with the al pastor. Tender beef  an extremely well put together combo of toppings  plantains  cabbage  avocado  exclamation points    all delivered on a tortilla soft enough to record a duet with Paul Simon  but firm enough to hold it all together.  I highly recommend Papalote for a quick bite or to entertain a friend from out of town for lunch. Excellent tacos.
Papalote Taco House,125,Coming from the Bay Area  CA. I had very high expectations since we have amazing Mexican food.   This place was amazing  Nice family run outfit with amazing authentic food. Good work guys we will definitely come back 
Papalote Taco House,126,THIS PLACE IS THE SHIT.  GREAT SERVICE  GREAT FOOD  GREAT PRICE  WE order a massive order from the salon off 6th street and without a doubt they have it organized with a individual tickets  salsa ERYTHANG    Torchys tacodeli all those places always eff up our big order. But this little small joint is off the chain.   AND. Homemade deliciousness too. They got their shit together no doubt. Not to mention  super sweet      Pay this little place a visit you won t be disappointed.
Papalote Taco House,127,Love this place for a quick grab and go taco  Fried avocado is a favorite of mine. Always super friendly staff and have never had a bad experience. Love their hot sauces and the homemade drinks 
Papalote Taco House,128,Omggg  hubs  amp  I have been coming here for a year now and we love it.  The breakfast tacos are BOMB  the hot sauces are amazing  and also actually refrigerated and sanitary   El Pastor is a favorite.  Even their slushie margs are good. Horchata is good on a hot day.  THEIR QUESO. Please  try it. And dip your taco in it like a monster  you will thank me.  Their outdoor seating is good  they keep it clean  provide a fan and just added pull-down shades for the area.   Seriously  our favorite meal for   20 2 people. Worth it  check it out 
Papalote Taco House,129,The sun had arisen and the first crisp morning of Fall was upon us   It was time to celebrate with . . . tacos   As I cruised down I-35  okay  not really cruising  because it s 8am on a Thursday and traffic is at it s usual stand-still.  I intermittently ceased the cool outdoor breeze by rolling up my car windows to speak to my assistant  Google  who found the nearest  breakfast taco place  upon my request and she proceeded to give me directions to Papalote.  When I arrived I decided to sit in the car and observe a bit. An older lady dressed in all black  clearly an employee  was cleaning the small patio area in front as I saw various patrons come and go with bags in hand. I looked up the menu on my phone and studied it. After mentally picking the tacos I wanted  I entered the establishment. It was smaller than  I imagined but smelled great.  I ordered a  simple  chorizo and egg taco and a  not so simple  pollo a la parilla with a self-serve cup of organic coffee.  Shortly after getting nestled in to my corner table near the bright window  my tray of tacos arrived. I requested salsa verde and a squeeze bottle of salsa appeared on my table.  The tacos were decent and the coffee was hot and fresh.  I d come back and possibly try some of their other varieties.   My only complaints     The tortillas are NOT homemade.   The expiration date written on the salsa verde was a day overdue.  The avocado slices on my tacos had brown spots on them.
Papalote Taco House,130,Solid spot to get breakfast tacos  although I liked the taco I got at Tacodeli a bit more. However  Papalote isn t as crazy busy as Tacodeli  so easier to get in and out  or dine in. I called my order in ahead of time so it was ready by the time I got there. I tried their Breakfast Taco  Sausage  Scrambled Eggs  Cheese   1.99    0.25 Fresh Avocado   a href  http   www.yelp.com user_local_photos select SZKmjpvRRXvruaSeS1o0RA amp userid 76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg  yelp.com user_local_phot   a   and it was delicious  and a great value  so highly recommended  I also liked that one of the salsas was actually spicy  which is a nice change from all the usually mild salsas. Parking was easy since they have their own lot  but it s not the largest lot  so I m sure it can get pretty busy crowded here.
Papalote Taco House,131,Love love love this place esp their lunch special.   My one issue with them  and other dine in establishments   and it happens a lot  please please don t sweep around my table or towards me when I am eating. Food particles  dirt  dust etc pushed into my dining space is just nasty.  I love the clean as you go and I certainly get it  But please don t push and propel filth towards me and my food.   
Papalote Taco House,132,was told this place on S. Lamar had good tacos so I was excited to try it out. The menu had a good selection  but when I got my bill it was way overcharged. When confronted  the manager said the menu board was wrong. He didn t say that when I ordered  nor had he changed the menu price for as long as it had been  wrong . I told him to give me back the difference he overcharged me and he got an attitude. I told him it was very bad business practice to do crap like that and I didn t like being cheated by a business. I don t know if he s the owner -- I doubt it  so I will be reaching out to the owner to see if he is aware of the shady dealings going on at that place. The guy could be overcharging everyone to make extra money or if there s a COVID charge  it should be boldly stated somewhere. I dislike this type of practice and will not frequent this one again.
Papalote Taco House,133,Decided to call in an order to Papalote s on a whim  as an alternative to the popular spot down the street  and it was okay.  We went with the Alambres  grilled steak and bacon   Cachete  beef cheek   and the pollo a la parilla  achiote rubbed chicken .  Really loved the Alambres  great flavor on the steak which the bacon only helped.  Best of the three tacos we had.  The Pollo a la Parilla was good  but I thought the Cachete was a bit underwhelming.  There were two sauces that came with our order  but I was not the biggest fan of either one.   The devilish taco spot down the street definitely has the better sauce options   Overall  I d say this place was okay.  I d re-order the Alambres  but not the others.  I may go back to try some other menu items.
Papalote Taco House,134,Awesome tacos  We were passing through and looking for somewhere new to try so at a friends recommendation we wandered into Papalote. So very good  From the guacamole and queso to the homemade horchata to the exquisite tacos everything we tried was amazing. I had the Guajolote en Mole  a turkey and sweet mole poblano taco with cabbage onions  queso fresco and avocado. So damn good  As well as the Alambres with grilled steak  bacon  poblano pepper  onions  provolone and avocado  which was also amazing. The staff was awesome and took great care of us and every single thing we tried was top notch  Next time we are in Austin we will definitely be back 
Papalote Taco House,135,4  amp  1 2  Among the best of many Breakfast tacos Ive been lucky to sample in this city of Breakfast tacos I found at this relatively obscure location approaching Austinnomansland.  Tucked away in a generic as they come looking strip mall on a unremarkable stretch surrounded my numerous Texas-wide chains  I found innovative tacos of the ilk associated with the now expansive Torchy s chain-local institution.       All the ingredients tasted fresh  chiefly the wonderful house made corn tortillas.  Whats more all of the filings  whether in the the breakfast or non breakfast varieties  are perfectly proportioned  and in the case of the breakfast tacos. mixed perfect with the scrambled to perfection eggs.  As is almost always the case you must go with Migas as one of the additions to the egg in your breakfast taco  although shockingly they are not referred to as such here  rather simply as  chips .  Regardless of what they are called  no true Austin Breakfast Taco is complete without the addition of them
Papalote Taco House,136,It s been a while since I have been here.  It is right in the hood only just around the corner but I have strayed a bit. I find myself driving further and going over to Tacorrido drive thru over the closer Papalote.  The tacos are still very good. The price stings a little more now though. They used to over stuff these tacos so much I could separate the two corn tortillas they come with and make two whole tacos. Now I easily finish the whole taco in 2-3 bites.  I am docking a star on the reduced value but will still return for the excellent tastes 
Papalote Taco House,137,Outstanding tacos  not too expensive and fast delivery. We were restricted to the vegetarian options  but all three were good  specially the cauli one.
Papalote Taco House,138,I m so sad that I don t live close to Papalote like I used to. But I get extra excited when I do get to go. Their hot sauces are delicious - both red and green are pretty spicy.  The tlacoyos are really good. They re little boat-shaped patties made from blue corn masa that s stuffed with beans  then topped with warm red and green sauces and fresh cilantro and onions. They re warm  the masa is slightly crispy  and soaks up all the tasty sauce. Whenever I get one  someone in the restaurant always asks me what I m eating.  Sopes are good  too. They ll make them with whatever taco filling you like.
Papalote Taco House,139,Delicious tacos   Alambrose is the best taco on the menu. Tiny location only a few spots to sit. Worth the wait. Call in orders accepted  Super inexpensive    good location and friendly staff.
Papalote Taco House,140,The tostada de rajas and cauliflower taco were delicious if you want a veg option  Great place  friendly staff.
Papalote Taco House,141,My roommates and I decided to support a local business in light of Covid-19. Decided on Papalote Taco House and we don t regret it one bit   We had around 9 items for everyone and it only took 15ish minutes for them to make everything. Walked in to pick up and everything was ready. As for flavor  We were satisfied  Very filling tacos and the Torta Cubano was pretty good  The horchata was amazing - oooh man that hit the spot. The only reason for 4 stars was because I think my steak taco was a LITTLE dry  and one half of the Torta was better than the other. I think more meat on one side  Anyways not a big deal and would definitely come back 
Papalote Taco House,142,5 stars is not enough for this taco sauce  but alas that is all Yelp allows for. The chicken taco with corn tortilla was fab. I love the ambiance of this establishment - I feel like I m in a family restaurant in the interior of Mexico. Great vibe and fabulous tacos
Papalote Taco House,143,Wow I ve been here countless times at this point and never left a review   I think I m just trying to keep it a secret      Let s be real  that is virtually impossible in Austin though.  The breakfast tacos are huge  someone mentioned they are too fried  I supposed they are actually fried eggs  not scrambled like most places - I like it   The turkey mole and beef chiptole tacos are incredible.
Papalote Taco House,144,This is a close by fix for something more authentic and  less Tex mex when it comes to tacos. The beautiful basics and little taco joint with fast talking ladies in the kitchen can only pull off. There s tortas are big and satisfying  with that homemade comfort to them. But maybe my favorite about this place is there salsas  all of them  on everything  every single time
Papalote Taco House,145,Papalote has the best tacos around.  I go back and forth on this but I m now taking a stand.  Definitely the best corn tortillas in Austin.  I scarf my food down every time I m here. I try to only use one of the two squeeze bottle sauces per taco but the Saudi is also so delicious that I wind up having both on every taco.  I just finished my food and my mouth is again watering from typing this review.  This place is insane good.
Papalote Taco House,146,I got the al pastor  amp  the fish. It was great  The place is a little small but we managed to get some chairs from the other tables. The only picture I have was the fish. Can t wait to go back  The sauces they had were fresh and delicious. One of them had a serious kick to it  And the horchata I got was on point.
Papalote Taco House,147,Awesome tacos people     Salsa is on point as well   I will definitely be back   The breakfast tacos look sooo good
Papalote Taco House,148,Simple  yet delicious authentic tacos is what Papalote is all about. There are many amazing options to choose from that you can t go wrong with whatever you pick  I chose the Alambre and Pastor tacos on flour and I was glad I did since they were great. The prices are fair for the portion you get and the service is fast. Highly satisfied 
Papalote Taco House,149,Decent.  Fast.  Food was ok.  It didn t taste bad or anything  just not convinced it was fresh. And food was not hot like off the stove hot.  Customer service is lacking.  Or something like they don t deal with a party of 5.  Could be a bad day.
Papalote Taco House,150,Might be my favorite taco shop in Austin. Generally I order their pastor and alambres tacos  but everything I have had here is pretty solid. Whether you call it in or order in the store service is always pretty fast. Really great value too  all the tacos are priced well  can feast and not break the bank.
Papalote Taco House,151,I love the breakfast tacos here   1. Super cheap 2. Super fast 3. Super delicious  You can really customize so you can have simple or add all the toppings if that s what you like. My favorite part about Papalote is that you can get chicharrones added to your taco 
Papalote Taco House,152,Holy cow. This place is good  I ve driven by it many many times  but finally decided to stop in after leaving half price books. The pastor is amazing  wonderful flavor and good texture. I also got a bacon  egg  and cheese. The eggs are not exactly scrambled or fried but an in between. Not sure if that makes sense but not sure how else to describe it. It was different but definitely not bad  just not what I m used to. The horchata was awesome and not overly sweet like a lot of places. Their salsas are also really really good. I can t believe this was my first time  I ll definitely be back to try the other tacos they offer.
Papalote Taco House,153,Okay.... Seriously  this is the best taco place in town.  Don t let this hole in the wall looking restaurant fool you  the food is phenomenal and super delicious. I have tried many taco places before  and I must say  this is the place if you want good Austin Tacos. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting good tacos and get a taste of Austin. I seriously hope you enjoy this place as much as I do.
Papalote Taco House,154,We tried 4 different tacos and they were all off the chain. Oh and a torta  also  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a . Papalote has joined Pueblo Viejo as my  go-to  taco destinations in the ATX.   Sidenote  The cauliflower taco was so good  I thought it was real meat.
Papalote Taco House,155,We re addicted to this place  Everything on the menu is tasty. Beer is kept ice cold in the help-yourself fridge. Shaded outdoor seating. We eat here 1X week.
Papalote Taco House,156,Had 3 tacos. In the chicharron taco the pork was pretty much raw. Other 2 were just average. Service was good  followed Covid guidelines well.
Papalote Taco House,157,I ve finally found a taco place that makes me want more  These tacos were authentic  plentiful and plentiful  Finally a place that does not skimp on the ingredients   Sheesh  My faves were the pollo a la parilla and the alambres. My friend ordered the cauliflower one and the fried avocado. Salsas are HOT. Flavorful  but hot.
Papalote Taco House,158,BREAKFAST TACOS are waaaay better than breakfast burritos    UGH. We need breakfast tacos in California  UGHHHHH We need Papalote tacos in California    I checked out Papalote one Sunday morning to check out the whole fuzz bout breakfast tacos. I got there around 10am and there s maybe 7 people in line in front of me. As soon as you walk in  you will notice that the place itself is really tight with limited seating. They don t have their menu on display but they have paper menus once you walk in. The menu is simple and you can pretty much just make your own taco by mix matching the meats  veggies  etc.   I only got two tacos  1. Beef with mushroom and eggs in corn tortilla 2. Bacon  ham  and potatos in flour tortilla I added the sauces and holyyy coow   LIFECHANGING   The tacos are definitley 5 5  I left one star out cuz the service was a bit slow and there s not much seating inside. But overall  awesome tacos  
Papalote Taco House,159,Tacos please my taste buds. Place gets packed but worth the wait. Little room for seating so one might have to entertain the thought of takeout.
Papalote Taco House,160,Moved up a star in my opinion.  While the al pastor tacos are still amazing  the Cuban torta and these plantains will get you hooked.  Also the horchata is so good   perfectly sweet and with a hint of cinnamon as the horchata gods intended.   You guys have me in love  
Papalote Taco House,161,This review is for breakfast tacos only. I cannot speak to their other tacos.   I think these are one of the best breakfast tacos in town and some of the best salsa as well.   My recommended combination  bean  cheese  bacon  and jalapeno on corn with their green salsa  note  NO EGG . These tacos cure hangovers. They have a nice level of grease that soaks up everything.   Pro Tips  Call 20 min ahead for big orders  amp  speak clearly when you order  they sometimes mess up your order  you might want to check your tacos before you leave .
Papalote Taco House,162,Oh man  this place is good  Excellent service  the ladies in the kitchen know what they are doing  I usually hit it up for lunch  big meat selection for your tacos  tortas  sopes  tlacoyos  and huaraches  You don t know what the last three are  Try them  you won t be sorry. The best hangover sandwich is the Cubano Torta  7  layers of delicious goodness  Papalote is small  but the line moves fast. You can t go wrong.
Papalote Taco House,163,Absolutely delicious. The beans  tortillas and chicharr n were cooked to perfection. The tamarindo and the Jamaica were great and the service was fast and friendly.
Papalote Taco House,164,They have a lot of kinds of tacos  And you can choose corn flour tacos. Their tortilla chips are very fresh. Clerks are nice. I really wished they had a salsa bar 
Papalote Taco House,165,The best breakfast tacos  I order them at all hours of the day. I haven t actually tried the regular tacos because I always just end up ordering breakfast. Their queso is runny and could use a little work but if you add two of their red sauce packets to it  it makes a tasty flavor.
Papalote Taco House,166,I am a Mexican food junkie.  I eat it almost every day.  I have lived in Southern California  traveled some in Mexico and recently have tried pretty much every taco joint south of the river in Austin.  This little place has little to offer as far as vibe or cool factor. But their food is spot on. Fresh  authentic and creative. I m especially fond of their huarache with the spicy beef tinga. Fantastic  It s not super cheap  not really fast and there s nothing groovy about the crowded seating area. But  taste for taste  it s one of the best in the city.  Highly recommend.
Papalote Taco House,167,Absolutely epic. We found this little joint on Yelp  and it was a perfect start to our Austin experience. It s perfectly divey  and it seems like a largely locals kind of place. Maybe only 20-30 people max could cram in here  and everyone there seems to like it that way - including us    The   la carte tacos are SPECTACULAR. We ordered eight different kinds between us  and they were all 10 10. We ll be sure to come back on our next visit 
Papalote Taco House,168,This is a spectacular lunch or dinner spot  Haven t tried their breakfast tacos  but they look pretty bomb as well. I had their guajalote en mole taco and their tostadas de ceviche  and I couldn t tell you which was more amazing. Everything about this place is professional and super clean. We sat outside on a nice late September day  but inside everything was clean and very socially distanced. But the food was incredible. Their tortillas were great  the sauces they provided were among the best I ve ever tried  and they had such a big menu that I can t wait to come back to try more of their food   Definitely give it a shot.
Papalote Taco House,169,Everything I ve had here has been yummy.  The parking lot can get full but there is residential street parking around the corner down Barton.
Papalote Taco House,170,Tacos were very flavorful though pretty small. I loved their drink options  actually is the reason I came in. Gotta get that horchata and tamarindo  Took me right back to meals in Mexico. Seating is limited both inside and outside.
Papalote Taco House,171,Pork torta  the meat was far too mushy for my liking. I love tender pork but there was no firmness on the bite which downplayed the mouthfeel. Although The Bread held up well . Decent prices and a chill vibe but I m getting my pulled pork meat else where in Austin.
Papalote Taco House,172,I ve heard plenty of great things about this place  so I was excited to try it out. I was a little disappointed since it was just  okay  to me and my husband.   We paid about  2.50 each for a breakfast taco which is cheap in my opinion  compared to other nearby taco places that charge  4-6 for a taco.  However  the quality just wasn t there for us. I feel like I ve made better tacos at the house. I don t think the tortillas are homemade which is odd for an authentic Mexican joint. My husband and I both added salt to our taco since it was lacking flavor. Lastly  we didn t see any salsa in sight. Typically  these are served with the tacos. Don t think it would have been a saving grace though.   Maybe I ll have to come back and try lunch dinner tacos but as far as breakfast tacos go  it just really missed the mark for us.
Papalote Taco House,173,Amazing tacos  dozens to choose from   open kitchen  decent price. Will absolutely return.
Papalote Taco House,174,Please don t discount this as another little greasy taco joint  cuz it ain t. Super-fresh  flavorful ingredients and unique taco offerings that have never disappointed at either north or south location. I swear  I d come here for the chips and guacamole alone  but those breakfast tacos  that are served ALL DAY  keep me overindulging every time I get there. The service is always quick and friendly and there s a few beers and margaritas there if you want  although I m usually in there for lunch and never tried  em. Seriously  keep doing what you re doing  Papalote  because you surpassed Torchy s for me a loooong time ago.
Papalote Taco House,175,It was one of the best taco places I ve been to in Austin  It s differently worth the trip 
Papalote Taco House,176,Best tacos in Austin. The taste was amazing and so was the presentation. I ll definitely be back  
Papalote Taco House,177,The tortillas are soft but strong  bit a little bland. The eggs are cooked well  fluffy and firm. Potatoes are crispy but could use a little more seasoning.  The vegetarian tacos were well spiced and thought out well. They actually felt authentic which is not that common at taco places in general  though they may not have really been.  The hot sauces are just a bit too hot for my taste  which is actually how I prefer it   There are a few little problems with this place but there is a reason it stayed busy all through lunch  in general it s just a really enjoyable experience.  Bonus  pretty good horchata. Could do with a little more rice but the sweetness is perfect 
Papalote Taco House,178,A must go spot for delicious and unique tacos with the best quality ingredients. The staff is really friendly and the tacos are super affordable. Don t forget to try the cold sauces they keep in the fridge.
Papalote Taco House,179,We re so glad that we have such a convenient and delicious taco place close by. We love to grab the cachete and tacos al pastor here. I also always wash it all down with the horchata 
Papalote Taco House,180,Excellent place   Fantastic service  amazing fresh tacos with loads of flavor. I ll definitely be back and it s way better than Torchys.
Papalote Taco House,181,Love papalote  Been a customer for 3yrs. Tacos are always great. Papalote is authentic Mexican tacos. Staff is always nice  The new additional space is very nice and cute.
Papalote Taco House,182,Solid taco joint in my opinion. The breakfast tacos with BBQ are really well done but for the most part a basic breakfast taco. The traditional tacos are great. I think its a great alternative to Torchys and the tacos arent as heavy.
Papalote Taco House,183,I love Papalote tacos   I highly recommend the pastor and cachete on corn but everything has been great in my experience   If you re in a breakfast taco mood  served all day  then you can choose ingredients a la carte.  Yes it s a small space and gets hot in there with all the ballin  tacos they are pumping out of the back  but it s worth the wait.  When I want to get fancy with a fried chicken taco smothered in queso I might head to Torchy s but when I want a quality go-to for breakfast or regular tacos I would pick Papalote any day.  Plus the name is really fun to say so there s that too.
Papalote Taco House,184,Papalote Taco House is amazing   The restaurant is always extremely clean and the staff is amazing and very service oriented. I am always greeted with a smile  even through the mask I can tell they are smiling  The food is always fresh and it is quickly prepared and delivered to your table. It s a must eat every week  Don t just pass this one by  step in and enjoy an authentic Tex Mex experience  
Papalote Taco House,185,Excellent hole-in-the-wall restaurant with great variety and what seems like really authentic taste.
Papalote Taco House,186,I ve heard nothing but great things about this place but it took awhile for me to make it there  I loved the Alambres and Al Pastor taco - pair it with a Mexican soda and you have a delicious meal  I think it s better than Torchy s  Highly recommend.
Papalote Taco House,187,Best tacos I have tasted in all San Antonio and Austin. If you are from El Paso  Texas like I am  you ll love this place. This is Mexican NOT Tex-Mex
Papalote Taco House,188,Pretty good tacos  made fresh and fast at a really affordable price. After a quick appointment nearby  I decided to call in and order two breakfast tacos. I probably got to the restaurant in 5 minutes and saw the finishing touches being made to my tacos. I was in and out fast and enjoying a delicious migas taco and an even better shredded beef  egg  and avocado taco. Nothing fancy or creative  just good quality stuff  all for a little more than  4. I will definitely be coming back for more.
Papalote Taco House,189,Pretty good breakfast tacos. It was loud and the  woman was distracted by the phone ringing  so my order was a little off. But I d go back again and give it another try.
Papalote Taco House,190,Mucho authentico.   What a cool joint and tacos made old school style.   Very unique ingredients and will sauces that are very flavorful.  You won t find your standard  fajita  taco here so be ready.   Tongue  pork  and a few other things I couldn t pronounce.  I had the pork and boiled beef and WOW... just great.  If you like real-deal tacos then stop in.   They do breakfast tacos all day as well.  I tried the one my youngest boy got and it was darn good.   They re using spices like I ve never had before so it was unique as well as really good flavor.
Papalote Taco House,191,This was my first time here  but my girlfriend used to come here frequently when she lived in Austin. The place is small  but very comfortable. It s a little quiet though when they re not busy because there is no music or TVs.  As for the food  it s great. I got to have some beef tongue and cheek  which I m a big fan of. But  they also have some great classic selections as well. Plus  their margaritas are crazy good   All in all  for my first tacos in Austin  I m a happy camper.
Papalote Taco House,192,I ordered a huarache and it was so so good  I love how authentic this place was. The pastor was a little dry and not the yummiest I ve had but it was still really yummy. Service was fast even with only one cook in the back. Overall  this place is not the best I ve ever had but definitely worth a try 
Papalote Taco House,193,Was in Austin tried to find a different place to eat. Looked on Yelp and pick Papalote Taco House. Glad we did  this is small store front restaurant with seating inside and out on the front sidewalk very small. Casual and hipster type place. Order at the counter then they will bring your food out.   They have a different take on tacos more Mexican then Tex Mex.  Check the menu out on the Internet. They have a wide variety of tacos.  The chips and  dips  are good.  Did not care for the steak I will not get that again had a funny taste. And a little to much cabbage on the tacos. I will stay away from the cabbage on the tacos.   The service was very good and friendly.  I would give them a try again when in Austin.
Papalote Taco House,194,Real San Antonio tacos in Austin    I can t believe it    Quick service.   1.99 breakfast tacos with eggs plus two other items.  Tasted great.  Good selection of taco additions including shredded beef  cauliflower   squash etc.     We went on a Sunday morning when everywhere else had a hour wait and got a seat and food in 10 minutes.
Papalote Taco House,195,Super delicious   My first taco trip in Austin  but that doesn t mean it isn t the best  I LOVE the Pollo a la Parilla  Fresh avocado  spiced chicken  queso fresco and jalape o  The Alambres was also great  but the beef was definitely greasier than the chicken. I felt a little rushed to finish my tacos because my soda was running out and the red sauce had some actual heat  I wished I bought a water as well. Green sauce was very mild but flavorful.
Papalote Taco House,196,I ve been coming here for 5 years. To the point that the previous employees knew my order inside out.  Recently it seemed they had a massive turn over of some of their best employees as the service has really started to drop. The food is the same quality  but it always feels like we are just another number  which we are at this point .   I get that they are busier these days  but they should look at expanding rather then trying to use the same staff to serve the influx of new customers.   We use to come here twice a week and now we are reducing it to only once a week.
Papalote Taco House,197,I can t think of a reason not to give this place five stars. Maybe the queso  It tastes a little more artificial than what you normally get in restaurants  but damn are those tacos good. My friends and I had a mix of the lunch tacos of their own concoction and a few of the make-your-own breakfast tacos. All were excellent  but their named tacos were a lot better. I think it d be great if they did that with their breakfast tacos too. I d prefer to trust their judgment on what goes well with tortillas and eggs  the core of the breakfast taco  rather than leave it to my own failings.
Papalote Taco House,198,this aint no tex mex taco house. beautifully prepared and wow. all fresh. Huaraches  tostadas de Ceviche  Alhambras.   mi gusta mucho.
Papalote Taco House,199,Best tacos I ve ever had  Unreal. Enough said. Aguacate con queso was my favorite. It s not always easy for veggie lovers like my self to find good tacos that aren t your typical beans  pico de Gallo  onions and some mushrooms.. but this spot had a ton to offer my veggie lovin tastebuds.   Next time I m in town I will def be back.
Papalote Taco House,200,La Torta Cubana is HUGE  This is what I think about when I want a loaded sandwich- Ham  bacon  franks  head cheese  milanesa  and fried egg topped with queso fresco  onions  tomatoes  fresh avocado  lettuce  chipotle sauce  and jalape os.
Papalote Taco House,201,I come here as often as I can for the lunch special. The tacos are legit. The tea is terrific. The staff is super hard-working. And the food is consistently good.
Papalote Taco House,202,The chorizo tacos were to salty and the alpastor had no flavor. this is tex mex not mexican tacos. I wouldnt go back  aaaand there 3.75 a taco    not worth it.
Papalote Taco House,203,Delicious  creative  inexpensive. Friendly efficient service. Breakfast chorizo pablano taco was excellent  both Roja and Verde salsas were delicious.
Papalote Taco House,204,I guess I don t get it. I mean..it was ok  Nothing special. I got breakfast tacos. They were..alright. Yet  i do want to say this....  The woman at the counter was the most personality-less person I have ever met in my life. She was so anti-customer friendly  that when I stopped by the cleaners next door yesterday morning  I looked inside and decided not to go in. As long as she is at the counter I will get tacos some place where someone smiles in the morning.   I mean  the taco was good  but not good enough that I can t get the same thing down the street. With a good attitude.
Papalote Taco House,205,The banderillas really satisfied my SoCal Mexican cravings.  The tacos are great  the salsa is even better   Try the sope    They aren t rude like some of the other comments have said. There is a bit of a language barrier  so give them a break. At least they are trying. Their food speaks for itself 
Papalote Taco House,206,This is my tried and true taco spot. I use to live across the street so it was super convenient. Although i now live in Kyle  work in Austin though   i still find myself coming back to Papalote  The service is fast  friendly  and the price is slightly less than the others. My go to is the desebrada and hongos y epazote.
Papalote Taco House,207,This place was really good  I got the ham bacon tomato  onion and cheese taco along with chorizo onion and cheese taco and they were both delicious. The chorizo one was the best though. Both salsas were excellent. I typically don t like red salsa but the one at this place was my favorite. My fianc  and I are currently on keto and they were able to heat up and put my food in my own tortillas  heb low carb tortillas . Overall great place 
Papalote Taco House,208,Probably some of the best  authentic  and flavorful Mexican food in town  My absolute favorite is the desebrada.
Papalote Taco House,209,Can t even begin to tell you had amazing this Papalote Taco House is. The freshest guacamole and tortilla chips you ll ever have. You can t beat the price for food this fresh and delicious. And it only took a few minutes before it came out.  I had the Alambres taco. Grilled steak bacon poblano peppers onions provolone avocado. Perfection 
Papalote Taco House,210,Even better if you get there for lunch special  11a - 3p free beans  rice  and drink with purchase of two tacos . I didn t but felt it was still all good. Lengua  beef tongue  and their beef cheek barbacoa tacos were excellent. Salsa is pretty hot.  Actually this is my favorite so far out of Torchy s and Taco Deli. Simple yet tasty.
Papalote Taco House,211,Wow  I recently had lunch there for the first time. The food was both beautiful and delicious. Very fresh. I ll definitely return for more.
Papalote Taco House,212,I love Papalote  Mom comes here like every morning and she introduced me to this place and the food is excellent and affordable.  I m vegan so they have plenty of options for everyone.  I usually get two corn tortilla tacos with potatoes  retried beans  potatoes  peppers and tomatoes with some salsa.
Papalote Taco House,213,I asked the cashier for a recommendation on the menu for something  not spicy .  She suggested the taco al pastor. When I tried the taco al pastor  it was too spicy for me.  I gave it to my husband.  I didn t want to go hungry  so I went up to the cashier and told her the taco al pastor was too spicy for me. I did not ask for a refund  and purchased a second breakfast taco. When the female chef served me the breakfast taco  she practically threw the plate in front of me instead of setting it on the table. Rude service. After I salted the breakfast taco  it was really good. Their breakfast tacos are served all day long.
Papalote Taco House,214, Two breakfast tacos with two items and a coffee  3.99 breakfast special    I got out of there with two tacos  with extra items  and a cup of coffee for under  5.00 which is great. I have tried to call before multiple times to get my order in so I can just pick it up and I am never able to get them on the phone - which would be incredibly convenient. They make everything to order  so if there are people in front of you and you re in a rush for work  you can end up in a time bind. The plus side of that is everything s fresh.   I ve picked up breakfast tacos from here a few times  but have never done lunch or dinner  though I ve heard amazing things  so this review is only based on breakfast.   Portions are decent. They really skimp on the salsa portions  though. The tomatillo was all foam and maybe 1 tsp at that. My eggs were a tad over cooked last time  but no real harm done there. From yesterday s breakfast in particular  the potato  egg  cheese  bacon  amp  avocado taco on flour tortilla I had was really really good. However  my second option of shredded beef  potato and avocado on corn was terrible. Dry  chewy meat. And I prefer my potatoes be fried  not boiled soft in a taco...  So  for breakfast  since I can t call in ahead to make this the most convenient option  I don t stop here often but I m not opposed to it and have been told repeatedly to get their barbacoa and their dinner options.
Papalote Taco House,215,Papalote is one of my favorite taco places in Austin. They have a varied  authentic menu that doesn t rely on overly spicy or trendy tacos  I m looking at you  Torchy s and Tacodeli . I love their classic tacos like the Cecina and the Pastor  and the others are good  too. Even their vegetarian tacos -- like the Aguacate con Queso -- are delicious  which is a sign of a great taco spot.  This is a very casual little hole in the wall  so not great for a big group since it s such a tiny spot  but you could do a big takeout order if you wanted to feed a crowd.
Papalote Taco House,216,Fish tacos are good  I tried the bean ones as well and they weren t bad. Not crazy about the place  though. The red and green sauces are super spicy which I don t mind but the spice overpowered the flavor if any. Also kind of pricy.
Papalote Taco House,217,Delicious tacos. Unfortunately  I need 3  tacos to fill me up which will run around  12 before tip  which is reasonable but maybe a little more than I d want to pay for a taco joint.   Ask for suggestions  I was not disappointed 
Papalote Taco House,218,This place is so tasty  The people working here are extremely friendly which makes this place a pleasant experience. I also love how spicy their salsa is and the horchata is amazing 
Papalote Taco House,219,Not my first time here but the first time the service has been so bad. Normally I don t have much expectation of service at this type place and I ignore the reviews that are weighted in that area. Bottom line is this place has great street tacos. Sadly the lady behind the counter seemed so put off at even taking our order that I don t know that I will return...El Chilito is just as good or better and they do it without the crappy attitude...  5 stars for the food...none for the service   2.5
Papalote Taco House,220,This place was fantastic. I would definitely recommend the cauliflower tacos - they have unbelievable home made salsas that pair perfectly with the tacos. We also had a fantastic pulled dark meat turkey taco that was marinated in a mole sauce - that was also very delicious. Yum 
Papalote Taco House,221,The service is very simple here  walk in  order your food  and the employees bring your food out to you. The store is a quaint spot with not a lot of room but the food makes up for the tiny inconvenience of not enough space for large groups. Every now and then I will take my family here if they want a great tasting taco because this place serves the best tacos in Austin. Their meat is cooked just to the right temperature  their tortillas are always perfectly made  and the sauces they have our out of this world  Definitely would recommend this place if you are looking for a quick bite or a tasteful taco.
Papalote Taco House,222,This is my new favorite place to pick up dinner after a long day of work. I think I ve had a few of those days more recently because the ladies now know me by name.   My favorites are the alambre and huarache. My husband is a fan of the tortas. The salsas are on point with the heat.   I haven t tried the breakfast tacos  but I hear they are delicious 
Papalote Taco House,223,Great little spot. Amazing taco options  Got the chorizo  lengua  and cauliflower. Great portion  service  and food.
Papalote Taco House,224,My wife and I live close by  bad news for the wallet  good news for the tummy.  Papalote finds a happy balance between a street taco vibe and a Torchy s-level strange taco vibe. We love it for that reason. Top quality al pastor  but also some very interesting recipes. Service is always fast and courteous. Would give this 37 stars if I could.
Papalote Taco House,225,This is one of my favorite places to come for authentic tacos  They re cheap  fast and delicious. Though the store itself is a bit small  the food is definitely worth it. I always get their horchata with my tacos. The Al Pastor taco is delicious  as well as their Achiote rubbed chicken taco. However  my personal favorite are the breakfast tacos. Watch out though  the salsa can be super spicy so taste it before dumping it all over your taco 
Papalote Taco House,226,Wasn t bad but definitely not 4.5 stars. Flew in from Washington and was craving some legit tacos  we decided to try this place. Really was disappointed  again not bad but not sure how this place is rated so high. Tried the lengua and cachete both were okay. The corn tortillas were good and the sope but just not the filling.
Papalote Taco House,227,Be prepared to wait a little while for your food as everything is made fresh to order  but know that the wait will be worth it. Most tacos are 3-4  which is pretty amazing considering all the work going into the food and portion size. I got the Alambre taco and the Pipian torta  both were delicious but the Pipian was incredibly spicy to me...worth it...but spicy. I drank nearly all of my refreshing horchata to cool the burn.
Papalote Taco House,228,My cousin moved from Austin back to CA two and half years ago.  The other day she forwarded me The Week s list of the 11 Best Taco Shops  shops   in America.  My response   I m too much of a taco snob to go to Torchy s   10 on the list .  Give me Papalote instead every time.  Almost always I ll order breakfast tacos on corn with egg  potato  sausage  and cheese.  The egg always soft  the potato ever-so-slightly undercooked  the sausage savory and chewy  the room-temperature cheese that s shredded on top melting slowly into the egg.   Perfection.  I didn t even mention their very fine house-made green sauce.  Also good coffee.  Also so cheap   Also kind people.  The cool vintage posters on the walls feature famous comedians from the Golden Age of Mexican cinema.  btw  Papalote in English is  kite   the toy .  South Congress shop outlet is similar but not quite as good.
Papalote Taco House,229,I m amazed more people don t obsess over their food. Easily some of the best tacos in Austin. Friendly and unpretentious staff in a super casual environment.
Papalote Taco House,230,What a fantastic taco shop   I am a true devote of another taco joint in Austin  Taco Deli   but Papalote is giving them a run for their money. I stopped by after searching for top tacos near me and immediately returned for a second visit the same week.   So far  I ve had the lingua   guajolote en mole  cachete and alambres. All were delicious in their own way  with the alambres standing out as my favorite with the lingua right behind. I also had their queso  but feel Paplote s is lacking compared to TacoDeli. It s more the bright yellow variety and clumps fairly quickly once it starts to cool down.  This is a great place for simple  authentic tacos  cooked fresh with lots of flavors. With their extensive menu  I plan on coming back multiple times to try them all out 
Papalote Taco House,231,Insanely impressed with the freshness and speed  Their chorizo breakfast taco was flawless    Breakfast tacos come with egg plus 2 items for  1.99. The egg  chorizo  and cheese was the highlight. Cheese is FRESH GRATED mozzarella. Not that powdery shredded junk from a bag. Highly recommended. It was busy on a Sunday morning but they were efficient and fast.
Papalote Taco House,232,I thought this place was supposed to be good   What happened   I feel that there is NO reason to even go here.  The barbacoa smelled terrible   Kind of like it was cooked in feces.  I could hardly eat it  I had to throw most of it away.   Unfortunately it was all I had brought to eat with me to the greenbelt.  Also  the queso was worse than what I make at home  just velvetta  Really   The tortillas were very blah  amp  the chips were blah.  These are all basic things and for me  Papolotes did not make the cut in any category.  The service was unenthusiastic and felt a little shady somehow as well  like they knew they were going to serve me something rancid.   Everyone who s saying this place is better than Torchy s clearly doesn t order properly at Torchy s or is just mad about the lines or something.  I will concede that Torchy s doesn t do eggy breakfast tacos well  but everything else is pretty amazing.  Honestly  I would prefer a local taco truck over this place.  Probably cleaner.
Papalote Taco House,233,Hole in the wall with delicious tacos and house salsas.  Never much of a line  quick service and consistent quality. Try the tinga del rey.
Papalote Taco House,234,I m a big fan of this place  but it s frustrating when you re waiting in a long line and people placing orders over the phone get priority.    They serve breakfast tacos around the clock  too
Papalote Taco House,235,Great tacos   Carnitas  Pastor and Tinga De Res.  The carnitas was my favorite.  Friendly service also.  Very full and satisfied...
Papalote Taco House,236,The tacos were great  You can really taste the authenticity through each taco  Our favorites were the Alambre  Chorizo  and Pastor 
Papalote Taco House,237,I selfishly don t want to post this review--I d like to keep it a secret so it doesn t get over crowded. The tacos here are legit  authentic  and amazing. You cannot go wrong with any of the tacos here. We ordered a dessert one time--the platano con crema--and it was sub-par. Stick with the tacos  The staff is in the small kitchen working their butts off. The seating area is small. This place is totally worth it.
Papalote Taco House,238,Love these Tacos   A must to go try  I get the Aquacate con queso which is fried avacado with cheese  cabbage  black refried beans  pico. Oh and I get it on corn. Super yummy  I also go in the morning and build my own breakfast taco  eggs  cheese  potato  jalape o  and sliced avocado. Again AMAZING.
Papalote Taco House,239,I don t know anything about the breakfast tacos here  but their other tacos are definitely the best in town. I never thought I d say that because I adore tacodeli.  The Pastor is incredible. So fresh. So flavorful. And the homemade masa tortillas are actually perfect.  My friend said the cauliflower cake tacos were amazing  so maybe try those as well if you re curious.
Papalote Taco House,240,Real authentic Mexican food little-bit expensive but it s worth it   you have to try the puerco con verdolagas taco .
Papalote Taco House,241,Taco aren t my thing. There small. Messy. But since moving to Austin I have come to appreciate the creative festive tacos  My first  austin taco experience was here. It was great  Simple mom and pop store front with limited seating. The menu is huge. I was excited to see the variations. I went with the mushroom Taco  the fried avocado taco and the fried cauliflower taco. All options came with corn or flour tortillas. The flavor of the mushroom was delightful because it had a creamy mushroom. The fried cauliflower option was pleasantly tasty with good texture. The fried avocado taco was the hit. Crunchy outside smooth buttery inside along with other veggies in the taco made everything finger licking good. I Will have come back and try there meat options.
Papalote Taco House,242,Yo yo yo    What is this little slice of heaven doing on this side of town   Totally did not expect to get the awesome flavors that blew our taste buds away. It s small yet quick service.   I love how the name of the plates are in Spanish as they should be. Nothing wrong with learning a little Spanish when it s important I.e. food. Nothing fancy as far as the restaurant but the flavors and taste is on point.   The banderas plate is awesome. The turkey with mole taco is oh soo delicious. Can t wait to go back and try some more plates. Definitely a must visit.
Papalote Taco House,243,Delicious breakfast tacos  Like this place better than Torchys  I don t know what I had because I had so much pressure with the line behind me  just ordered a bunch of random tacos with a combo of sausage jalapeno cheese bacon egg   Yummy salsa too 
Papalote Taco House,244,The tacos are really good. They have some masa type dishes that were a bit on the plain side but overall the food is really good.
Papalote Taco House,245,Great tacos without all the fanfare of other more popular places.  Nice little hole in the wall.  Ordered the Carnitas  pork meats w  pickled onions  and Aguacate Con Queso  fried avocado and black beans .  Both were terrific.  Order at counter  take a number  and they bring the tacos to your table.  The sauces are spicy  so try a little before you douse your entire taco.    As I said  pretty small place so I would imagine if it was any busier there would be quite a line and an even longer wait  as the kitchen seems to only be able to accommodate one or two cooks.    Enjoy
Papalote Taco House,246,The slow roasted meat in their tacos is some of the best in town  Others have complained about the spices and sauces  but I find them deliciously complex and more authentic than the plain  more stripped down flavors of the usual tex-mex. Only item that s a little  meh  is the queso - it ll get the job done  but you can find it much better elsewhere.
Papalote Taco House,247,Place kinda jumped the shark after they opened the new location in North Austin.  The quality is just poor now and lacks anything special.  I took my dad here for a quick bite and there was a large bone and a piece of plastic in one of his tacos.  Your money would be better spent at a taco truck or even Torchy s.  I won t be going back.
Papalote Taco House,248,Seriously    I swear  every time  I ask for extra green salsa they give me ALL RED.  I just ordered 4 tacos on corn - to go - and when I get home GASP  they were all. on. flour.  Tried calling but apparently they are too busy messing up orders to answer.  WTH Papalote   What did I do to you 
Papalote Taco House,249,Super good tacos made fresh   This hard-working crew of ladies makes some seriously delicious tacos  My boyfriend loves their Avocado  egg  amp  potato tacos. My favorite is bacon  egg and cheese.  With their flavorful salsas breakfast couldn t be more wonderful      AND my tacos were ready before I could even finish this review     
Papalote Taco House,250,Wow - when you re busy at 2PM on a Saturday you know a taco place has something going for it. After hearing the name  Papalote  from 2 different friend groups - I agreed it was a place I needed to check out. After a beautiful day on the Greenbelt  my starving friends and I headed over for some tacos. The line was out the door  They have some patio seating that we were able to snag  which was great because I brought my pup along with me. Ordering was easy and the food came out quickly. I ordered 1 papas egg  amp  cheese and 1 aguacote. Both were very yummy and I m definitely interested in trying more of their vegetarian tacos  they have a great selection.  There was an annoying confusion regarding my order number. I was 26 but I guess the order got placed in as 36 - the lady was walking around with my food and didn t believe me when I told her the numbers were wrong and this was in fact  my food. It got figured out and I indulged in some tacos. Already thinking about stopping there tomorrow morning for some breakfast tacos...yum 
Papalote Taco House,251,Torta Cubana was bomb  ginormous and flavorful. Love Cubanas  would def come back for the tacos for sure.
Papalote Taco House,252,This is a great place for casual stop in eats with friends or maybe a relaxed date night. The food is great and the beer selection  while small  is a set of great picks to partner with your meal.
Papalote Taco House,253,I went for a Saturday lunch and got breakfast tacos and a lunch taco. They presented very different experiences   Bacon egg cheese avocado - The awesome thing is that  2 gets you a 3-item breakfast taco so why not spring for the extra avocado  The bad part is that they use crumbled bacon instead of bacon strips. That s a deal-breaker for me.  Alambres - this was a lunch taco and  while the portion of meat was generous  this taco was nothing special.  Chorizo egg cheese - This is the reason they get 4 stars instead of 3. This was easily the best chorizo egg cheese taco I ve ever had. I ll definitely be back for another and to figure out what else is best on the menu.
Papalote Taco House,254,Great little taco place  The food is fresh and delicious also the best part is you can see the ladies making the food so you know it s pretty clean  Great place to get the real deal tacos 
Papalote Taco House,255,ordered steak and cheese  got potato fuck this shit hole over priced taco hell hole  you fucked up a simple order  that s on you
Papalote Taco House,256,Vegetarian Breakfast tacos served by gals that could give no fucks... Tacos we re so so good I got cactus potato pobalano and  corn tortillas we re to die for..
Papalote Taco House,257,Cheap taco place that serves authentic tacos. I love the green and red salsa. Try mixing some of their salsa into the queso. Their queso isn t anything to write home about  but adding salsa to mix in it makes it better.
Papalote Taco House,258,We love this little gem. Any time we have visitors from out of town  this is our first stop so they can enjoy some true  delicious  authentic tacos  with chips and guacamole most likely . They re priced so reasonably and the food is amazingggg. Everything on the menu is delicious and the service is always friendly and polite. It s pretty much our go-to if we want tacos.
Papalote Taco House,259,Definitely satisfied with our dinner here   We ordered tacos  chips and queso  and got some yummy margaritas  The margs were strong and so well priced--only  3.50 all day long  The meat was well-seasoned  and they have a great variety of specialty tacos. The queso was a little watery and didn t hold up on the chips  but it had a good flavor. The chips were a bit bland. But we ll probably be back next time we re in town 
Papalote Taco House,260,Excellent tacos   Lot s of interesting combinations   It s a tiny hole in the wall place with limited seating but worth it.  They have a few beers and a slushy margarita machine with surprisingly decent margaritas for  3.50  small .
Papalote Taco House,261,I don t want the world to know because this is my taco joint.  Stay away  it s all mine and the food is great.  So is the hot sauce   salsa.
Papalote Taco House,262,This place is right across the street from the new Austin Pets Alive  building where I spend all my free time volunteering so  Yay  I m a fan  to have a great Taqueria across the street  They are located at the SE corner of S Lamar   Manchaca.   Papalote is run by the same owners of Azul Tequila  one of my favorite interior Mexican restaurants  but this small order at the counter shop specializes in just tacos with a good sized menu I plan on working my way through in the next month.   The homemade tortillas  fresh ingredients and spicy sauce are authentic and really good. My favorite so far is the grilled tilapia  avocado  cheese and cabage. The chicken fajita with avocado and queso fresco is also very tasty.   At about 3.00 each their tacos are much larger than most trailer tacos with lots of fillings and I have yet to finish 2 in 1 meal - definitely a bang for your buck here 
Papalote Taco House,263,Papalote is a blink and you ll miss it taco joint almost halfway between Austin s two most recognizable taco joints on South Lamar.  The menu is a little confusing. I had to muddle through it with help from one of their new employees. The breakfast taco area could certainly be a little more clearly laid out.   But for  4 you get two with a refillable coffee and that s hard to beat. Fresh tomatoes  onions and jalape os added an amazing flavor to my eggs bacon and sausage as it was all mixed on the grill and made me forget the tortillas weren t fresh.  Since it was nearly lunch I added a queso and chips. Not so impressive. But it tasted better with the addition of their house made salsa rojo which is stored cold in the drink cooler.   It s good to switch things around and I know I will return. The smallish parking lot and boring sign looks like it will keep them from doing the big business like the two other nearby taco joints.
Papalote Taco House,264,Ohhh my gosh  Talk about delectable  So good. My best friend and I took a road trip for my birthday. Checked out some Austin staples and this was one. So glad we drove three and a half hours for tacos lol. Well worth it   
Papalote Taco House,265,I honestly love this place. We used to live within walking distance so we frequented it quite regularly. The tacos definitely have a homemade  secret recipe vibe going on. They have several amazing vegetarian options  the cauliflower cake taco is delightful . There is almost always a line out the door on Saturday mornings. Pair your order with a bottle of Topo Chico and you re set.
Papalote Taco House,266,Cute hole in the wall place  almost missed it the first time I came here  but am so very glad I found this gem. The food is awesome  Cheap  fast  and super flavorful. The breakfast tacos and queso are  been coming here over a year now and will always recommend to anyone 
Papalote Taco House,267,Amazing  amp  Authentic ... best tacos in Austin. There are so many choices and they are all delicious.  Each one is unique and has its own personality and tasty sauces and toppings. I am obsessed with MOLE and theirs is one of the best I have had. Not to be missed 
Papalote Taco House,268,These tacos could quite possibly be the best  an most authentic  tacos I have ever eaten. Wow. I could even say that they could rival torchy s if more people knew about it. I had the Pollo A La Parilla which was so very good. However  the Alambres taco was just incredible. The combination of grilled steak and bacon was heaven sent. Would highly recommend Papalote to anyone looking for a quick bite and an exceptional  authentic taco.
Papalote Taco House,269,Disappointed that their tortillas are not homemade but who they are getting their tortillas from was the right pick.  Meaning  good tortillas anyway.   Getting past this  their food is what I would label comfort food.   Quick and easy place to get a good taco.   I will be back 
Papalote Taco House,270,Great taco place  with great sauces. I really liked the green sauce  and it wasn t too hot  in my opinion . Also  I don t see it mentioned here  but there was a BBQ trailer right outside that had outstanding brisket  and a great unique cole slaw that seemed homemade. Overall a great visit  and would absolutely go again when in town.
Papalote Taco House,271,Great salsa  Great food  Local   What else can I say .  i would suggest taking your tacos and eating them in the park not much place to eat in the little location. But the food is amazing. I went on a Sunday morning and found it a little like my mothers cooking.
Papalote Taco House,272,YUM.  I have had Torchy s and Tacodeli s many times  but only needed one sample of Papalotes to know that it tastes superior.  I had 3 tacos...Alambres  breakfast taco with egg  chorizo  avocado  and one more...it s in the picture but I don t remember which one.  I needed 3 tacos to be full for breakfast brunch and that ran me   10  a little pricey.
Papalote Taco House,273,Thankfully I have moved away from South Lamar or I would of gained a thousand pounds getting tacos from here everyday. This place is great  Really good breakfast tacos for a fair price. The service is always super friendly and great when I come in. The restaurant itself is pretty small  although they do have a few tables outside as well. Be sure to get here early  they get super busy for breakfast.
Papalote Taco House,274,Here is a small street taco places with a variety of choices   For people who can handle a kick if spice this is a great little place.  However we had children with us and since there was no kids menu we went pretty basic with there  crunchy beef tacos  which were not tacos but flautas and even these were too spicy for them to eat.  Unfortunately the kids didn t leave full and we had to feed them at home since the food was too spicy.  As for those who can handle a kick of spice this place was great and tasted pretty good.  The typical beef cheek with cilantro and onions taco was a least favorite among the group because the meat was not traditional.  For those with gluten allergies this place catered well.  There was also a cauliflower vegetarian taco that people raved about on yelp and it did live up to expectations and more   All in all I would come here again if I didn t have the kiddos.   I recommend you find a more kid friendly environment if looking for street tacos.
Papalote Taco House,275,Taco Tuesdays  Their tuesday lunch special  2 tacos  side of beans and rice  drink  is a good deal for under  8. It s not my favorite taco place  but it s definitely a place I d visit frequently.  Pros  - good and various selections of tacos - serving portions are decent. If you re hungry  you should get 3 tacos. - parking is shared with nearby shops  so it s good as long as it s not lunch time or anything - prices  Cons  - parking can get bad during peak hours - Seating is pretty limited if you have a group of 4 or more.
Papalote Taco House,276,Very tasty   Good aguas frescas  Jamaica  hibiscus   Horchata  rice  and Tamarindo. Naturally they have Mexican Coke  with cane sugar   Jarritos and other Mexcian sodas.  I had a sope with chicken which was tasty  then tacos de Alambre  which where delicious. Alambres are made of steak  cheese  poblano  onion and cheese. My wife had the cecina  which was tasty as well.  The salsas were good  and not too mild. There crema was good and they served limes  not lemons  as an authentic place should. There were more things on the menu we must try soon. The rest of the menu sounded pretty authentic.   Worth a try.
Papalote Taco House,277,Lengua was phenomenal  Pastor was pretty good Cauliflower was different at first but I really started to like it Red sauce is damn good  green is better  Corn tortillas are store bought and only thing preventing a 5 star
Papalote Taco House,278,Had high expectations  but was disappointed overall. Fish  chicken  and also pastor tacos were all subpar in my opinion. Steak taco was good though. With so many other options in Austin  I don t see myself ever going back.
Papalote Taco House,279,I love their tacos  but the service is AWFUL     It s always bad  but today the front person took a very long phone order while I was already in the process of getting my call in order. They are not set up for the amount of business that they have. They really need a to go window. I waited behind foor people who didn t know what they wanted just to pick up a call in order. Again  their tacos are really good but they really need to increase their level of service.
Papalote Taco House,280,Just wonderful lovely amazing food  People love Torchy s and Taco Deli but I poo poo them. Some of the best Mexican food I ve had since moving here from Phoenix.
Papalote Taco House,281,Small place with limited seating. Food was excellent. Variety of different tacos and items not normally found in a taco place. Fast service.
Papalote Taco House,282,Love  love  love this place.  I didn t know if it would be my cup of tea when I first walked in and looked at the menu.  I saw a lot of unfamiliar things  cactus  rajas  cauliflower cake  etc.  and felt like maybe I should just politely mosey on back out the door.  I decided to be adventurous and give it a try.  I m so glad I did     The hubby and I shared the chicken guisados tacos on corn tortillas.  The chicken was cooked in an  achiote rub  whcih was really tasty  and it had raw shredded cabbage on top for a refreshing crunch.  We also shared a pork guisado taco  super tender stewed pork  and a small tostada which normally is made with  black beans but we requested pinto.  It had  rajas  on top  which turned out to be sauteed mushrooms  peppers and zucchini and there was some sort of cream based sauce drizzled into it which was out of this world.  Oh  and we shared chips and guacamole  which had some cilantro in it and not sure what else but it was delicious.  For those who have never been it is a very small place where you walk up to the counter to order  no table service .  The lady at the counter is friendly and helped us make our selections.  There are only about 4 or 5 tables but a lot of people do take out so it s not that hard to get a table if you want to eat in.  I ve eaten chicken tacos at Torchy s  Guero s and Chuy s over the years and although they are all yummy  I have to say that I think Papalote tops them all for moistness and overall flavor.  We have been thinking about our meal for 2 days now  ever since we were there.  It s calling out our names again.  We ll be back soon.
Papalote Taco House,283,First time at Papalote and having grown up in San Antonio  am surprised Austin even has a taco place this legit. A friend told me to get the cauliflower taco--GET THE CAULIFLOWER TACO. Fish taco was yummy as well. Full flavor  great spice  happy and full tummy. This place is the antithesis of Torchys  and that s a good thing. Just puro tacos for a fraction the price of the aforementioned. We fed three people for 25 bucks including drinks. Will be back soon.
Papalote Taco House,284,Listen to me when I tell you...Papalote is taco bliss   This was my first trip to Texas and was told that the Mexican and Tex Mex was going to blow my mind.  So we ate in Houston  Austin and San Antonio.  Papalote takes tacos to another level  We ate there twice in 3 days.  The beef cooked with chipotle and plantain is absolutely brilliant.  Living my entire life in Los Angeles and Sacramento I ve eating a ton of Mexican food  but nothing of this caliber. Papalote...please let me know when the cookbook comes out   Also  would you kindly consider opening up in Sacramento  CA  Rest assured  the people of Sacramento are waiting for your arrival and will support you day and night 
Papalote Taco House,285,Tacos are good - I am partial to homemade tortillas so I had to take points off.  Can t call yourself authentic without homemade tortillas. Three stars because the horchata and salsas are delicious. Plus  your taco filling is made to order and fresh.
Papalote Taco House,286,I ve been here three days in the last week. The tacos are phenomenal and cheap  Added bonus the staff is friendly and they serve breakfast tacos all day  Arguably the best tacos in Austin.
Papalote Taco House,287,Solid tacos at a good price. I came here once for breakfast tacos and once for regular tacos. The breakfast tacos were just ok and mostly tasted of egg really. I did like the red and green spicy sauces which helped. I can again  and really liked their regular tacos. I can t remember any names unfortunately... But while the fish taco was just ok  I really enjoyed their different pork and beef tacos  And i also tried this chips with peppers dish. It was warm sliced peppers in a sort of cream sauce. It was a nice change from the typical guac and chips order.
Papalote Taco House,288,Very authentic Mexican food. Lots of unique tacos not the standard fare. Great guacamole and chips
Papalote Taco House,289,The food is amazing and the price is reasonable.  This is a great find. Webhad the shrimp tostada and the chicken tacos and they rocked.
Papalote Taco House,290,Good tacos and very flavorful but very bad service. They messed up my order and then argued about it instead of just remaking it. After they agreed to remake it  they proceeded to be incredibly rude. Tip for the staff -- if you re going to remake the order  you might as well be nice to your customer too. No sense it doing the work and still delivering a bad experience.
Papalote Taco House,291,BEST. TACOS. EVER. Tried 4 of them - all on corn flour tacos  smoother and softer than plain corn tortillas   hongos y elote  good   alambre  tender beef   puerco en pipian  freakin  delicious  and best for last...shredded turkey in mole. The kitchen is maybe 100 sq ft and everything is made in house. Fast service  no frills and there s water  tea  grab-it-yourself sodas and beer. The guac is fresh and ridiculously delicious. Six stars out of five...muy delicioso  
Papalote Taco House,292,Better than as good as they get.  Better than me. Everyone has a taco favorite In Austin  this is mine. Yours is yours.  I can t speak for the whole menu  but I do know about guacamole  and I do know about fried avocados. When they are inside corn tortillas with black beans. These are those. These are great.
Papalote Taco House,293,I live down the street from Papalote. And I would say I come here 4 to 5 times a week. I stumbled upon this place one morning driving to work and I have been hooked ever since  so needless to say this is my morning spot  The price point is great  and they always keep the place clean  And the location is perfect  I usually order a breakfast taco with their red and green sauce which is amazing. They are both spicy and filled with tons of flavor  You can tell everything is made fresh. Today I came in on my day off and ordered my usual breakfast taco plus their most popular taco. And after tasting another awesome taco I thought it was time to show some love and let everyone know that this taco house is amazing hands down  I usually order Togo and I never have to wait more than 5 minutes which is nice if you are just trying to just pop in before work like myself. And I decided to eat in and not Togo today  and even vibe here is nice  Everyone is always so nice and they makes you feel welcomed  and the food never disappoints 
Papalote Taco House,294,Oh my goodness. I cannot believe it took me this long to try this place. Im a Torchys gal  and I cheat on them with taco deli on the weekends  but papalote may just be better than both of those. I had the Rajas y Hongas and I had to do a taco check and make sure this wasn t a meat taco. So flavorful and perfect. Also you can get 2 tacos  rice  beans  and an iced tea for  6.50 at lunch. You cannot beat that.  I also just found my new favorite guacamole in Austin. Perfectly crafted  served at room temp as it should be  not refrigerated BS avocado usage .  I will be back as soon as I possibly can... Maybe dinner tonight.
Papalote Taco House,295,My favorite taco place in Austin...by far  They could be better about answering the phone though...
Papalote Taco House,296,I was feeling really homesick for Mexico and Papalote made it all better  Love this place. The selection is great. I tried Guajalote en Mole and the  Puerco en Pipian. Both on corn and both were fantastic. The salsitas were basic  but great.   If you re looking for Tex-Mex keep heading north on Lamar to Matt s. If you want the real deal  swing into Papalote 
Papalote Taco House,297,A fantastic selection of tacos   Cold beer and a few tasty dessert can be had as well.
Papalote Taco House,298,One of our two favorite taco places in Austin  Authentic interior Mexican style food. We wrote a review on our blog here   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fnelsonandrachel.com 2Flow-brow-high-brow-nelson-and-rachel-eat-out-in-austin 2F amp s 414b96028864d2907ecd99c5695897c830b1c8701da3d57aa9587feaae6b126a  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  nelsonandrachel.com low-   a 
Papalote Taco House,299,I used postmaates to order from here so it all came in a to-go box. I ordered an horchata  BANDERILLAS  amp  PUERCO EN PIPIAN. I actually really enjoyed the banderillas. I probably could have ordered 2 orders of that and would have been happy. When you get it to go they don t put the sauce on to make sure it stays crispy. I really liked the taco I ordered as well but didn t see any mole really but you could taste it. The taco is HUGE and it was bursting out of the foil.   The price for these tacos were amazing. I would definitely eat here again and maybe even eat it there just to make sure I get the whole experience that everyone loves. One thing I would skip again would be the horchata. it was really sweet and felt like it came from a concentrate or something.
Papalote Taco House,300,As any gluten-intolerant person knows  the switch from flour tortillas to corn is usually a disappointing one. Corn tortillas often leave a lot to be desired  especially when they re holding a lot of juicy ingredients or are wrapped in foil and taken to-go  and they end up falling to pieces  as is the case at Torchy s and Taco Deli in my experience.  The tacos at Papalote are amazing  yes  but I ll get back to that. The main point is that this is a gluten-free person s dream  as their corn tortillas are unbelievable. They re hearty  flavorful  and they stand up to the filling. My boyfriend  who is blessed with the ability to eat whatever he wants  orders corn here by preference. I don t know what they do differently  but they re absolutely delicious.  The tacos themselves are beautiful to look at  delicious to eat  imaginative in combination  and not greasy or salty. I ve had a lot of migas in my life  and they re almost always amazing  but the migas tacos here are my favorite. I also love their beef cheek  the fish taco  the al pastor  and my boyfriend loves all their vegetarian combinations.  The staff is always friendly  and the prices are great for what you get. If you re a taco lover  gluten-free or not  this is a don t-miss taco spot.
Papalote Taco House,301,Horrible. What a joke and a waste of  9  seriously. Ordered a potato and egg with mushrooms and cheese. Very little egg  lots of potatoes  canned quality mushrooms with overload of unmelted cheese. Im a pescitarian so eggs are what I need for protein. I also ordered a Tilapia taco so I can get my fish in. It d the only fish taco they had there. No salmon oe shrimp tacos like other places. It was doused in weak Chipotle and overloaded with cabbage........... flavors were horrible together. Then ordered a plantain dessert and the presentation was embarrassing  I can t even blog it or show it off on Instagram . The plantain was not sweet at all. The bananas weren t black and I told the cashier that if they weren t sweet I ll just take the pudding. She shrugged and said she didn t know  that they d be ready in 5 minutes.  Incompetent   Anyway  you re better off sticking with taco places on E. Riverside  E. 6th  Torchy s  and Wahoos. So disappointed. I ll never come back and I ll deter anyone from coming here. Because of its location  they will fool you and provide horrible  less than mediocre tacos dessert but the price will not match. This crappy meal was worth  4. Not  9. Smh.  PS  I only eat white corn  not yellow corn  but there wasn t a choice. The flour ortillas were horrendous  too. Fail.
Papalote Taco House,302,Their torta cubana is massive but so good. Maybe ask for it without the weenies if that s not your thing but other than that it was delicious. Their breakfast tacos are pretty solid too. Potato and egg and add cheese
Papalote Taco House,303,Came for lunch and had a Tinga de Res  an Alambres  and an Adobada.  The Tinga de Res was my favorite  but all of them were tasty.  It was fairly busy  and took about 10-15 minutes for the order to come out and everything tasted very fresh  and home cooked.  I d say it has a more authentic feel to it than most of the other popular taco spots in town  and depending on what you like  was almost as good as  just as good as  or better than the rest.
Papalote Taco House,304,I have been to this place two Saturdays in a row and am looking forward to repeat visitss. Paplote is right next door to Thundercloud on S. Lamar. I was not at all disappointed in this humble little restaurant that specializes in all things taco.  The Aguacate con queso taco in particular is excellent with fried avocado  bl beans  pico  cabbage and queso fresco. Also  I recommend trying the less spicy of the two salsas they offer because the hot one is pretty intense.  The thing that stands out most to me is how fresh  tasty  and cheap these tacos are. Totally worth trying  You will not regret it.  Find the menu here on the Thrillist review of Paplote   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.thrillist.com 2Faustin 2Ffood-dining 2F2010 2F09 2F01 2Fpapalote-taco-house amp s 7079f66b329171a47c2ff9a529c2804addb33525bcce4623c89a4c2a9d082b61  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  thrillist.com austin foo   a 
Papalote Taco House,305,Believe the hype.   This place is the real deal. The menu is authentic and the quality is on point. My wife and I stopped in after a long weekend and we were starving.  Hangry  is the term she used to describe me. After realizing the menu had authentic items listed  like what you d find in Mexico City  we wanted one of everything. So we tried a little bit of a lot. We had the nopales  cactus   puerco pipian  ceviche  tlacoyos  rajas  huaraches  tostadas and horchata. It was all on point.   We left in a food coma and very  very happy  I m going back for lunch today.
Papalote Taco House,306,What a great selection of vegetarian tacos  Always so delicious  The meat dishes are also very good. Highly recommended  The staff is always kind and the service is fast   A must to try. Don t forget the tasty hot sauces 
Papalote Taco House,307,Holy shit these are good breakfast tacos  Big  hearty  cheap  and the red sauce is amazing. Very friendly kitchen staff too.
Papalote Taco House,308,First time here and all I have to say is nomnomnom  The Hongos y Epazote and the Aguacate con Queso were so delicious. This is a worthy taco place and I ll definitely come here again. I ll try the cauliflower taco on my next venture.
Papalote Taco House,309,Probably the best mexican tacos I ve had in the U.S. If you want authentic food and don t care about ambiance  go there. It s well priced and the tacos are incredibly good.  Order the alambre and pastor tacos and you will be in heaven. Also the tounge  I know I was skeptical too but it s really tender  and the Rajas y Hongos  even if you re a meat lover this is really good I swear . Pipian is also great if you like spivey. Adobada and pollo a la parrilla are good but boring compared to the others  get the others.  Regarding the ambiance  the place is small  has some 5-7 tables with chairs  and some fans instead of air conditioning. So not a place you d go on a date.  And even so  my boyfriend and I came back twice in one weekend .  But the food is absolutely incredible and authentic. Even for Austin. Go there for a mid day snack or a cheap lunch dinner.
Papalote Taco House,310,GUAJOLOTE EN MOLE- quite possibly the best taco in Austin.  I ll drive by 25 taco places from Georgetown down to Lamar just to get some of these      The counter folks could smile a little more but  all in all its real good stuff.
Papalote Taco House,311,Less fried content and their tacos have less grease and fat in them than some of the competition. The taco s dont have a river of grease flowing out of them when you pick em up.  Downside  the taco s are smallish. However  I got two of them and was pleasantly full. Not fat full. Worth stopping by if you ve got a tickle for a taco
Papalote Taco House,312,My first time eating from here and I would definitely return. Small but clean and we didn t wait long. I always appreciate getting my order just like I ordered it. And the salsa was very good. Unfortunately no rice and beans on the weekend.
Papalote Taco House,313,This is the Best place to get a Breakfast Taco and a great place to try new thing. I m not one to venture off the  norm  of Mexican food but so far every new thing I try on the menu has been fantastic  Even if I can t pronounce the name of it lol always have quick service and welcomed in with a smile 5 thumbs up  Been going here for almost a year and no plans to stop   
Papalote Taco House,314,Don t be afraid by the signs  this is real food  Every taco was exploding with flavor... not just salty meat but deep flavors that were unique from menu item to menu item. I wish they didn t use so many plastic cups  but as far as tacos go these were great.
Papalote Taco House,315,Get the lengua tacos.  Thats all you need to know.  Yes they are that good.
Papalote Taco House,316,This place never fails me. It doesn t claim to be anything it s not  and the food is outstanding. Prices are good  service is fast  ingredients are fresh... I ve only had good experiences at Papalote.   My personal favorite is the pastor taco with the verde sauce  there s a bunch of bottles of verde and roja sauces in their beverage fridge . It s a perfect amount of spice and the onions and cilantro round out the flavor for a simple and delicious meal. Add in the chili con queso  which is plenty for two to share  and you ve got a great quick meal.
Papalote Taco House,317,Best authentic Mexican tacos in Austin   Employees are great  fast service and cannot wait to go back 
Papalote Taco House,318,I have to go back in order to get a better idea of what I think  but so far  so good.  I got a carnitas taco and a pastor taco . . . I LOVED the carnitas and felt a little slighted by the pastor  which was recommended to me and the reason that I went.  My boyfriend got pollo parilla   I think    and he wasn t too impressed  i tried it and wasn t blown away either.  The green sauce that they sent us with was DELICIOUS though.  I thought that  23 for four tacos and 2 cokes seemed a little steep but maybe I m just being cheap.  Point is  I liked it  I am going back to get more of a feel of the menu and I have a feeling I ll be a bigger fan.
Papalote Taco House,319,Solid tacos. Worth stopping in for sure.   While driving down south Lamar starving  we decided to pop in because I thought I had heard good things about this place. We live north  so whenever south  we like to do south things. It might be worth the drive to come back and try more    I had a sope with chicken and the pastor taco on corn  with an horchata. My boyfriend had 2 beef based tacos and of course we got chips and queso. The queso was nothing mind blowing  was probably velveeta.   My pastor taco  however  was awesome. Great flavor and texture  corn tortilla did not crumble apart or crack. Very very good. The sope was fantastic  I think I would stick with those since you can put whatever meat on them and they are more filling than tacos. The masa was perfectly thick  loaded with toppings and just awesome. The chicken was very good too. My horchata was delicious and huge.  I saved half of it and later mixed it with iced coffee- thanks for the idea  Tamale House    My boyfriend eats everything basically and inhaled his tacos. I guess they were good.   The tacos aren t huge like Torchy s  so if you re really hungry you probably need 3. We were still hungry afterward  but some gelato from Dolce Neve solved that.   Till next time  South Austin.
Papalote Taco House,320,Yum great for a late night snack or anytime 
Papalote Taco House,321,I m largely a carnivore but wow  those cauliflower tacos make me ok with becoming a vegetarian. But the chorizo were  a great snap back to reality.   Highly recommended and nice employees.
Papalote Taco House,322,Man  is Papalote a gem. There are  best of  lists for taco joints in Austin coming out all the time  but this little shop seems to be consistently looked over compared to places that have wider name recognition. I m not saying those better-rated places are nothing special  but... Papalote is just soooo good. Any conversation with your friends about where to grab a taco in this town must include this place.  Maybe it flies under the radar because it s so tiny  and its location is easy to miss. It shares space in a small strip mall on South Lamar with a couple other businesses  including a Thundercloud. The parking lot is small too  though there always seems to be at least one free spot left. It s a hole-in-the-wall shop  very plain interior with a short counter where you place your order  and the kitchen looks like it s just jammed into the back with whatever space was still available. There are only a handful of small tables inside  and a couple outside  which can make it difficult to sit down when the place is packed. And despite its underrated press  it is definitely popular and can fill up easily. Its patrons know exactly where delicious food can be found.  The tacos here are to die for  but eating them will make you feel more alive . For the high quality and fresh taste of the ingredients  their breakfast tacos are dirt cheap at  2 apiece. Each has scrambled eggs already included - the best-cooked eggs you ll find in any taco  they bring your senses to life. I usually throw in some chorizo or franks  yes  hot dog is a filling here   and pair those with potato  mushrooms  or green beans. But there are so many filling options it s hard to decide. Hey  you can put cactus in it  Basically  you ll be staring transfixed at the menu until the moment you order. For an easier decision  pick out a couple of their specialty tacos instead. I usually order the pastor  because they make it better here than almost anywhere else in town. Today I tried the tinga de res - shredded beef in a chipotle marinade with plantains and cabbage - and I swear it had me on a food high. They just prepare everything to near perfection here. The flavors pop out at you from every corner.   Despite its small size and lack of charm  it can feel kind of cozy here. I love remembering that it exists on those days where I m uncertain about what to do for breakfast  because I know exactly where to go. One small downside is that they have messed up my order a couple times  but it was never more serious than putting the wrong meat in my breakfast taco. It s hardly a crime when 95  of their stuff is fantastic. Yes  the food is a home run. The prices are a grand slam. You ll hardly get a better meal for a better deal. And that s the 411  y all.
Papalote Taco House,323,Nice authentic mexican cafe. Enjoyed four breakfast tacos. I like it. Simply fresh and efficient. Not fancy which is great.
Papalote Taco House,324,Magically stumbled upon this via a coworker and SO happy that I did  Don t let the small building and limited parking fool you- Find yourself a spot nearby and walk on over. You won t be sorry. We eat here around once per week and haven t yet been disappointed  The alambres is my personal favorite with their queso poured on top. It is a smaller spot  so going during the peak of lunch hour is kind of frustrating as seating is very limited- this is my only sore spot about them. Its great if you want to grab and go though  Then you can eat at home and be just as happy.
Papalote Taco House,325,This is my favorite south austin taco place.  it is better priced than torchy s  more authentic  casual and quick.   the cauliflower patty tacos are seriously good.  the turkey mole is one the best tacos i ve ever had.
Papalote Taco House,326,This place is so yum  I absolutely love their breakfast tacos. I highly recommend the egg bacon cheese combo. They chop up their bacon so it s mixed in with the eggs instead of being just strips.   They also have homemade red and green salsa that is spicy and delicious.  My favorite is the green   The service is quick  I ve never waited long to get an order. Normally I ll call in my order as I m leaving my house and by the time I walk in the door the tacos  are in a to-go bag ready for pick up.
Papalote Taco House,327,So  these are my favorite tacos in Austin. I d go so far as to say that they are head and shoulders above anything else I ve tried so far. This place does a great job of matching an authentic Mexican feel with a diverse   gourmet  menu - and of throwing in that little dash of hipster vibe.  Weirdly  they have several meatless tacos that are amazing across the board. I m excited about taking a couple of vegetarians I know here. Lots of great flavor with a medium level of spice  the horchata is just right to take the edge off.
Papalote Taco House,328,I hate to write a review this bad. Unfortunately  there was nothing redeeming about this experience. Fish was stinky  definitely old.... Worst fish taco I ve ever had. Ever. Puerco en verde sauce was SO spicy it was almost inedible and destroyed my palate. Carnitas was ok but it was diced.... Never in my life have I seen carnitas like this. Cashier was friendly  but what s the point  After two tacos I couldn t eat and a resulting stomach ache  I won t be back.
Papalote Taco House,329,I love this place for quick  simple  good breakfast tacos. I place a phone order about once a week  and they are always polite and fast. The order is ALWAYS correct  unlike Torchy s   and the prices are great. The tacos usually have all of the ingredients mixed together rather than layered  which means every bite is yummy and toppings don t seem to fall out. Get the green sauce 
Papalote Taco House,330,Papalote is a clever name. It is an umbrella  but it is also a concatenation of the spanish words for potato and a type of street corn. I thank my five year old for that.  What I do not understand about Papalote is why there are so many great and authentic taco recipes and no freshly made corn tortillas. For the prices  one would definitely expect some fresh tortillas. Dock one star just for this.   Having said that  I get back to the ingredients and recipes. Very good   I thought the Banderillas  3 mini-flautas were very well conceived and executed. Lingua was very tasty. Chorizo was so-so. Beef steak was tasty but a tad dry. The turkey mole taco was tasty.  The salsas  both red and green were tasty and authentic and benefited the tacos overall.  The interior is small and divey and the service is friendly. Overall  a winning combination. But with so many places that offer the fresh corn  I can t get too excited about this place. And the tactic of substituting one fresh corn tortilla for two manufactured ones is hardly a good tradeoff.  Oh heck  I am going to go against my wife s expert opinion and bump this up from 3 to 4 stars.
Papalote Taco House,331,This place is only OK.  Beef is terrible  I saw what they were cooking and it looked like stew meat being used for tacos. Most of the menu was pork  so there are other options.  Chicken taco was much better  though bland tasting salsa didn t help.
Papalote Taco House,332,I have driven by this place so many times  and finally  FINALLY   stopped in    First things first  do yourself a big favor and order the horchata- seriously the best I have ever had. Secondly  try to keep your mouth from watering before you order your food. I was practically drooling on the counter watching them make someone else s order in the kitchen. The staff were so friendly  the food was INCREDIBLE. This place is what torchy s used to be  and so much tastier. The prices range from  3 25- 3.75 a taco  which may seem steep  but considering the sheer quality of the ingredients I think they are well worth it.  I would highly recommend this place for a quick bite of authentic mexican tastes in a convenient location.
Papalote Taco House,333,I live in the northeast where good Mexican food is strictly something that you make at home because you can t buy it anywhere and the uncanny valley of Mexican food that is Chipotle is exciting.    I wish so much that I had a magic door to Papalote.  Their corn tortillas are delicious  they have a bunch of vegetarian options  it would be super easy to get stuff vegan  and they were great with questions about ingredients.    For hardcore vegans and folks who are concerned about gluten  I m not sure what the deal is with the grill - they re obviously cooking a lot of stuff on the same surface so you may want to ask.  I m very sensitive to gluten and had no trouble.
Papalote Taco House,334,This place is absolutely DELICIOUS   What a gem   I have yet to try everything there is on the menu but I ve tried at least 6 different tacos plus several breakfast tacos and everything was awesome. Love their homemade salsa selection too  spicy and delicious. I will definitely be back. Try it out you won t be disappointed  
Papalote Taco House,335,These are by far the best tacos on South Lamar. I love this place. Grab a glass of horchata while sitting on the patio. Super refreshing. This place is authentic as well. They use delicious head cheese in their tortas. My favorite part is the green salsa 
Papalote Taco House,336,We re pretty new to Austin and have tried a lot of different tacos from various Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants in search for a good  fresh taco. We have finally found it. The people are super friendly and the tacos are always good and made with fresh ingredients. This is definitely my favorite taco spot in Austin 
Papalote Taco House,337,Everything here is amazing  But my favorite is actually the cauliflower taco  and I m not even a vegetable person   The cauliflower is mashed with lots of cheese -- totally delicious. Really anything here is great. Whatever you get  make sure to get extra red salsa because that s a winner as well 
Papalote Taco House,338,We gave it a try on our way from San Antonio to Dallas and it was awesome. We ordered some different taco to try out and didnt make us disappointed. My favorite were grilled beef and beef tongue. The horchata drink was too sweet though
Papalote Taco House,339,Wow   Get here quick or I might eat all their tacos myself   I  love places like this  simple style  good parking  great service  hard to beat.   It s an amazing little taco joint  with fresh and tasty ingredients.  I had the Alambres  the Guajolote en Mole  and the Carnitas tacos.   The friends tried the Aquacante con Queso  the Pescado a las Brasas  and the Banderillas.  They have two types of hot sauce  a red and a green  in the cooler that you should grab and try. They both had really good flavor  though both seemed pretty mild to me since I eat ridiculously spicy food.    They also have a few selections of beer  mostly Mexican brands as should be.  The Alambres really stood out  everyone agreed that a steak taco with BACON in it is freakin awesome   Guajolote en Mole took second place and will also be a repeated order  the mole was flavorful but not overpowering like some can be  overall fantastic.  The Carnitas was merely okay  not as notable as the other two.  The friends really liked the Pescado a las Brasas and the Banderillas  but didn t care for the Aquacante con Queso.  And everyone was already planning another trip back to try more of the extensive menu.  The only dislike was I am pretty sure the tortillas were not made in house  so lost a star for that  otherwise it would have been 5 stars.  However  the tortillas they have are a high quality  probably from one of the local distributors and still better than any you ll find in the grocery.  The breakfast taco pricing is really good  will stop on the way by to work soon.   Mangiare  bere ed essere felici 
Papalote Taco House,340,You can t live south Austin without eating here all the time  The tacos are amaze balls  the margaritas are sweet and the service is great. Literally a hole in the wall... It s a must go 
Papalote Taco House,341,I have visited Papalote a few times since my last review  and I must say I am very disappointed  with them. I used to love the onion  cheese  and potato breakfast taco  but the last few times I ordered it the potatoes were severely under-cooked. I hate to say it  but Papalote s inconsistency has forced me to order my breakfast tacos elsewhere.
Papalote Taco House,342,Hands down one of the best in Austin. It s impossible to name a single favorite taco place  but I definitely go to Papalote more than anywhere else.  The kitchen is very friendly  and the menu has plenty of options breakfast  lunch  or dinner. Must go 
Papalote Taco House,343,This place was my most favorite meal I had when visiting Austin. They re very friendly and have cheap  delicious tacos. Their red house salsa is great too- just enough spice to add some flavoring to the tacos  not that they were flavorful enough on their own .  I had the adobada tacos that have fresh cactus- yum  Wish I could have gone again.
Papalote Taco House,344,Wow     So tasty  The definition of a hole in the wall place but don t let that stop you. Every taco was delicious   Between my husband and myself we had 5 different ones and they were all great. I think the turkey in mole sauce was my favorite. Simple great food    
Papalote Taco House,345,There are times when you need a gourmet taco but at non gourmet prices. Papalote is just the place.  There are several vegetarian and meat options so no one needs to be left out. I would recommend the Hongos Y Epazote and Alambres tacos--very tasty.
Papalote Taco House,346,While this place doesn t satisfy my usual criteria for Mexican places  great salsa by the gallons   it is one of the best taco places I ve been to in Austin. The taco filling knocks it out of the park. I order a carnitas taco and an al pastor.  Both were excellent. The meat really was the star. This is so different from a lot of the cheaper taco places in the area where the filling can be almost an after thought.   I m taking off a star because you have to pay for chips and salsa here. The tacos here cost a bit more than other places  but they re worth every penny.
Papalote Taco House,347,The tacos are flavorful  varied and fat. Some of the best tacos in Austin. Service is quick and friendly.
Papalote Taco House,348,Stop reading right now.   Order 2 Alambres on flour  i m white  and then...you know when MJ hit that jumper over Craig Ehlo and jump fist-pumped...yea  you ll do that.  The green sauce is what you need.   Torchy s has the fame but Papalote is the real deal.
Papalote Taco House,349,Papalote s is a common eatery for my roommate and I. Although the environment is not eye-appealing in a modern style  it has a very authentic feel  I personally enjoy it. This place is great  With the prices low and tastes that are unique  you don t need anything else. My favorite tacos to get are the Pollo a La Parilla and the Aguacate con Queso. The Aguacate con Queso can be compared to the fried avocado tacos at Torchy s- but these are definitely less  americanized  than Torchy s. It has more authentic beans and the hot sauces that come with it add a kick of flavor  especially since I love spicy food. I also tried the Hongos Y Epazote and Tortas de Coliflor but did not enjoy them at all. However  my other two favorites keep me coming back to them no matter what. Overall  a must-go to place 
Papalote Taco House,350,Found this place by reading yelp reviews. It was amazing  Cauliflower taco was ridiculous. So flavorful  and a good texture. I liked the mushroom taco a lot too. Kids had regular breakfast tacos  so they were happy too. I will definitely come back here next time I m in town. There is something to please everyone here.
Papalote Taco House,351,Quintessential taco house - menu includes classics as well as creative options. I appreciated that they distinguished tacos that should be served with only cilantro and onions  e.g. pastor  vs those that can go with the works  e.g. tinga . Great service  flavorful meats and salsas. A new neighborhood favorite 
Papalote Taco House,352,I go for the breakfast tacos here. It s not good enough for me to come all of the time but good enough for me when I ve exhausted all other options.
Papalote Taco House,353,Great food and staff. Speedy service. Got two potato egg and cheese tacos that were well served and sooooo good 
Papalote Taco House,354,Loved the fish Taco  It was fresh and sauce was great. Can wait to come back to try something else.
Papalote Taco House,355,Fantastic joint with amazing local talent. This owner is stupendous and all the recipes are from his mother. It s family owned and they are growing organically. They care and to me  that matters most.
Papalote Taco House,356,They make some great tacos for either breakfast or lunch.  I like them because they re not your typical TexMex style tacos.  They definitely have authentic taste and they consistently produce a tasty product.  I ve visited at least a dozen times and never once have I left disappointed.
Papalote Taco House,357,Legit breakfast tacos. Very tasty.  The included red and green sauces were what really stood out for me. Good spice without being wimpy or overpowering.  The counter person was friendly and courteous.  I really enjoyed it. I ll be back.
Papalote Taco House,358,Good stuff.  I have been several times and my favorite so far are the beef fajita with Poblano peppers and the grilled fish taco.  Tasty  quick.  great place for lunch if you are in a hurry.
Papalote Taco House,359,The pastor is incredible  as are the lengua and cecina tacos. The pastor was delicately sweet with a slight essence of pineapple  just the way I like it. The meat was tender. I wept.  I prefer the flour tortillas here  as they re unquestionably tastier.  If you re going veg  skip the tortas de coliflor. I found it too  floury . The hongos y epazote  on the other hand  were awesome. The portabellas were the perfect texture.  Overall  these are some of the best tacos in town 
Papalote Taco House,360,Went here today on a dime to eat lunch with my buddy who works right next to it and goes here quite frequently. I was surprised at the location  It is tucked away in a little building right next to Thunderclouds. The prices for the food I got was amazing  I got chips and Guacamole   3.99  which was the only thing I would not recommend here. The Guacamole was room temperature and had a weird consistency.   The taco I ordered was the  Aguacate Con Queso  which was a fried avocado topped with black beans  pico de gallo  cabbage  and queso fresco.   3.25  Talk about a BIG taco  Delicious as well  But the best thing I had was the  Banderillas  which were 3 fried beef tacos covered in homemade green and red sauce  crema  and queso fresco. DELICIOUS    the sauce was not overpowering the meat  yet had just the amount of flavor and spice to make the meal amazing    Overall for the price you can t get much better for the food your going to get  the only downside is be prepared to search for a parking spot  to deal with employees that don t really speak English and find it hard to smile  as well as the hunt for salsa there.  Located in the bottom of the soda cooler . Other than that if your in the mood for some really good tacos and don t want to empty the wallet like other Austin taco joints tend to do then defiantly give this place a shot 
Papalote Taco House,361,BEST TACOS IN TOWN     Any one visiting Austin check out this place I love it  the employees are super friendly the food is amazing. Overall best place to kick it for breakfast.
Papalote Taco House,362,Amazing breakfast tacos. Cheap  but great quality and tons of options for meat  veggies  and other ingredients. However they spice their eggs is amazing 
Papalote Taco House,363,Fresh  consistent  soooo delicious   Try a bacon  egg  cheese  jalape o  onion  avocado on flour with both salsas. To die for.
Papalote Taco House,364,For a restaurant with the name  taco house  you would think they make their own tortillas. Disappointed in the bfast tacos.. But heard the Alambres is delicious 
Papalote Taco House,365,very best authentic mexican tacos in austin. amazing flavors. i love the puerto in pipian which is a rich spicy green mole. if you love it like i do you can get a chicken plate of it at their sister restaurant azul tequila  another fav of mine. if you re looking for tex mex or american style breakfast tacos this is not the place but if you love real  flavorful ethnic food then their tacos are the best. they also have some real creative and yummy veggie tacos that will blow your mind 
Papalote Taco House,366,Yummy yummy. I eat lots of tacos and this place is going in the favorites list. I got here at 11 00. The place started filling up Shorty after. My food came out quick and it was fresh and delicious. The salsas are good too. I had the red and the green and they left a good burn. I ll be back here.
Papalote Taco House,367,This is a great little taco joint. They have some interesting tacos  cauliflower  mushroom and hominy  etc...   that use flavors more authentic than the fried and queso smothered options you will find at another popular taco spot in the area. They have a lunch special that includes rice and beans with 2 tacos  which isn t a bad deal. The rice is pretty garlikcy and the beans are refried black. I really enjoyed my alambres taco and the mushroom hominy. Next time I want to try to cauliflower.
Papalote Taco House,368,Never disappointed with my pit stop to Papalote.   The tacos are bigger than you think they will be so beware. And I dont know what it is about their black beans  delicious.   I use this place consistently to supply my out of town guests with their breakfast taco morning hang over urges. Not too greasy and perfectly proportioned. Can be a tad but spicy for my taste.   Parking is a bit annoying but there is additional parking in the back and the front lot is easily viewed from the street.
Papalote Taco House,369,Fantastic  I ordered the cauliflower patty thing in a corn tortilla taco. It had a mellow very flavorful sauce that I kept licking off my fingers and even wiped off the paper with the left over tortilla pieces. Delicious  I also tried the oval black bean patty with 2 salsas over it. Too spicy for me and my lil one. But very good.  They were fast and very nice. Not super clean  not that I cared that much  it is a dive type place. I can t wait to go back 
Papalote Taco House,370,I always drop by after hiking around the greenbelt. I really enjoy the langua tacos on corn tortillas and the salsa that they make in store.
Papalote Taco House,371,We are regulars at this little taco joint and have tried only a portion of the menu because we found our favorites early and can t seem to stray from them  I always get the Alambres- steak  bacon  poblano  onion  avocado  and cheese. SO GOOD. The bacon  egg  potato  chorizo  and el pastor are also solid choices. The tacos come out fast and piping hot. I always grab a salsa rojo and a salsa verde from the drink case and put them on the table while we wait. Then when our tacos come  we smother them  The red is my favorite but both are fresh and house made daily. One morning we came is as they were pur eing one of the salsas and we had to open the doors because the spice was getting to everyone  It was hilarious and very candid  the ladies behind the counter were laughing along with the customers as we all coughed together haha  This is and will continue to be one of our regular breakfast taco haunts.
Papalote Taco House,372,Papalote is everything you ve been missing from torchy s  taco deli  etc... Real street style tacos with the most incredible flavor ever  They absolutely know how to make a mean carnitas taco. Stop what you are doing and go now 
Papalote Taco House,373,Papalote is sOoooOOOooo gewd. Very fresh  authentic flavors coming out of this little taco house on S. Lamar. The alambres taco is my personal favorite. Their house made salsas are also super on point. The only thing I would say is skip the queso  it s not that great here. But who the hell needs queso when you ve got tacos this good  amirite  
Papalote Taco House,374,With as many options for tacos as this city has to offer  how do you pick a favorite  I definitely haven t lived here long enough  or tried enough places  to declare Papalote the best tacos in the city  but they re the best I ve found at this point.  Service was exceptional. All sauces made in house. One of the best moles I ve had in quite some time. I recently found a Rachael Ray article that listed Papalote as one of the best tacos the country has to offer. At this point  I can t argue.   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.rachaelraymag.com 2Ffun-how-to 2Ffood-travel 2Ffood-trip-advice 2Fbest-tacos-in-the-country 2F amp s aecc0f701a51aa74ea3141312788946ff345af4b016f1fa7667c044de94828d2  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  rachaelraymag.com fun-ho   a

Come for the tacos  stay for the loud Spanish flat screen soap opera.
Papalote Taco House,376,Amazing tacos and amazing service. Their breakfast and lunch specials are awesome. The prices are great and the food is amazing. I come here as often as I can. They even serve frank and eggs too like my mom used to make  Try the green sauce and try the torta 
Papalote Taco House,377,Finally....found it...the holy grail of Austin taco joints...this is the real deal....no foo foo upscale boutique tacos for the wanna bees...this is true tex mex..delicious...reasonably priced..big portioned..plenty of options..down home..hand made tasty heaven...don t waste your time with the Mexi delis  or mexi ranch  or chef driven fake-o restaurants....come here...doesn t get better in this town or most any....top rating...
Papalote Taco House,378,This place gets my vote for the best tacos in Austin 
Papalote Taco House,379,Watch out Torchy s and TacoDeli  there s new game in town  Oh man  my guy and I were so impressed. We live in the South Lamar  hood and plan on going again and again. The tortas  the tacos... the rice pudding  Everything was fresh  delicious and exciting. Get it all 
Papalote Taco House,380,PAPALOTE is PAPALOTASTY.  Austin hasn t seen a joint like this since Chango s  so I was ecstatic the first time I got to try them out.  The menu is extremely extensive--we re talking around 20 different taco choices   I m actually really looking forward to talk about my taco choices.  TORTAS DE COLIFLOR When my co-worker informed me that they really loved the cauliflower taco  I literally scoffed.  No way a veggie taco steals takes the spotlight  but I have never been happier to be proven wrong.  Have you ever eaten melt-in-your-mouth cauliflower   Well let s just say this taco made me want to turn into a vegetarian.  PESCADO A LAS BRASAS I MAY have just found my favorite fish taco in Austin.  WOW   The two pieces of thinly sliced tilapia are SO tender and are covered in queso chipotle sauce.  I will no doubt be back for these delicious filets   GUAJOLOTE EN MOLE Shredded turkey covered in mole sauce   What a concept   This dish gave me a little Thanksgiving TEASE.  The shredded turkey is anything but dry  and the mole sauce is nice and chocolately.  It s also loaded with very thinly sliced cabbage  which is a great compliment to the taco s sweetness.  The taco is a bit on the messy side  but well worth it.  BREAKFAST TACOS. Super hearty--they didn t stick out to me  but they re conservative fall-back.  What gives these tacos their pep is Papalote s rojo sauce.  It packs a small punch  but the creamyness of the salsa is too much to resist.  OH  and before I forget  they serve a lunchtime special-- 6.50 for any two tacos  with rice beans and iced tea.  Considering most of their tacos are  3.25 each  this is a pretty sweet deal 
Papalote Taco House,381,Please open a north location on Burnet at Justin.  That is all. The cauliflower  yes really  taco is too awesome to be contained to only South Lamar and must get closer to my belly.
Papalote Taco House,382,This gem was recommended by a friend  and I m so glad I tried it out. My husband and I take advantage of their awesome lunch special at least once a week. My favorite is the mushroom veggie taco  I have no idea how to say it  but it s the first mushroom option on the menu   but I like to try a new one each time we go. Haven t tried one that I didn t like yet. Highly recommend for lunch 
Papalote Taco House,383,I know this is as close to blasphemy as anything gets in Austin  but I m going to say it anyway  these tacos are better than Torchy s.  There.  I said it.  Seriously  go order a tinga de res or a guajalote en mole and tell me that it is not far and away the best taco you ve had in Austin.  I will know you are lying.  Their mole is some of the best of every had.  Their non-taco food is great as well.  I almost fainted when I saw they had sopes on the menu  and their tortas are likewise excellent.  Even their breakfast tacos are the best we ve had in the city  though the lack of beans as an ingredient was disappointing  but not disappointing enough to make a dent in the 5-star quality of this place.  The restaurant itself is quite small with just four or five tables inside and two or three outside.  It gets very busy during lunch time on the weekdays creating a prolonged wait for food  so make your schedule accordingly.  These tacos are worth the wait  but your boss might not agree.
Papalote Taco House,384,Skip Torchy s and go here. Better tacos  shorter wait time  lower prices. Papalote is the best 
Papalote Taco House,385,Great hangover food. Reminds me of the taquerias in the mercados.  Vegetarians will love the coliflor tacos.  I recommend the salsa verde.
Papalote Taco House,386,So I never write reviews  but since this place just opened I thought it would be helpful for y all to have one.   I m hoping that after eating there a couple more times I will bump up the star count on the review.  It was their first day and naturally things weren t running totally smoothly.  Nothing too bad  but you could tell the staff was having a hard time keeping orders straight and that it was taking longer than I m sure it will in the future.  The place itself is very simple.  Small  maybe ten or so little tables and you order at the counter.  The menu is packed full of things that sound amazing.  Tacos are I think  3.25 each  so my girlfriend and I each got two.  She had the steak and avocado something-or-other and the stewed pork with cabbage and greens  I forget just what was on this.  Definitely stewed pork  cabbage  queso fresco  and maybe pickled asparagus or something   Some kind of greens. .  I had the turkey in mole  also had avocado and queso fresco  and the same pork one she did.  The food was really good.  My pork taco was real heavy on the greens and a bit light on the pork  but the flavor was outstanding. I m hoping the proportions will balance out once they get settled in. It was really nice and spicy too.  The salsas they have on hand are great as well.  The tortillas were pretty standard but definitely good.    All in all the food was good and I felt like we got our money s worth.  Neither of us could finish two tacos  though when you re really hungry I m sure it s just about right . I m excited to try a ton of other stuff on the menu  it all sounded pretty amazing.    Oh  this place is run by the same guy as Azul Tequila.  EDIT  I rescind my initial three-star review in favor of five because Papalote has become my favorite taco joint in town. The carnitas I just ate was just wonderful. Pickled red onions. I m so glad this place exists in my back yard.
Papalote Taco House,387,Fresh ceviche tostada. My favorite thing I ate today. Fast service and an extensive menu. They also have vegi options 
Papalote Taco House,388,I can t believe I haven t written a review about this place yet  I have had many a taco in Austin...MANY. But when I close my eyes and dream of tacos  the tacos I ve gotten here are the images that come up in my mind.  That s a bold statement  I know.   Also the guacamole is very good. The salsas are fresh and homemade. So you know  maybe give it a try.
Papalote Taco House,389,Papalote is quickly becoming what I consider to be the best tacos in South Austin.  I am attempting to eat my way through the entire menu...I know  tough life   I would say that the tacos here are more traditional Mexican street food style vs. what you might get at Maria s or Torchy s.  The flavors are extremely robust and well balanced with tangy toppings.  No hablo espa ol muy bien...so I often have difficulty ordering off the menu due to being a total cracker that can t even pronounce most Spanish words but I make it work with some pointing  smiling and compliments to the chef.      I haven t found a single thing that they serve that I don t love.  Their salsas are amazing and super fresh - be careful with the red though that stuff is HOT   Be sure to stop by for lunch - they have a great lunch special that includes 2 tacos  rice  beans and an iced tea for a very reasonable price.
Papalote Taco House,390,This place whips. First  they score points for giving you unrestricted salsa access via squeeze bottles kept in their drink fridge that you can bring to your table for saucing up each bite.    This is key. When a taco place is run by white people  you don t get this. You get a little 1 oz. plastic to-go cup of spiceless salsa and are charged extra if you want more. Salsa generosity is one of the most important aspects of a good taco joint and Papalote does it right.  On to the menu... the tacos are a bit more expensive than the usual cheap Mexican-run taquerias around town  but they are more than worth it. They tend to have more filling than other places  tacos giving you a higher filling-to-tortilla ratio. And the options are much more diverse and unusual than other taco places. But not like... Torchy s-style goofy fusion bullsh t unusual. Just good carefully made classically Mexican stuff. And as everyone mentions  the Tortas de Coliflor taco is great.  Do yourself a favor and eat some of this.
Papalote Taco House,391,This is one of the few places I know of in Austin to get the authentic Mexican food I grew up with. From the outside strip mall look I would have judged it poorly. Inside the decor is Aguas frescas machines and industrial fridges. This place is worth a taste.
Papalote Taco House,392,I would go back for one item alone   ALAMBRES  Grilled steak and bacon topped with poblano peppers  onions  provolone cheese  and a slice of fresh avocado.  It was excellent and  3.25.  I also tried the fried avocado taco  a little bland  have had better in Austin.  Very casual place  limited seating.
Papalote Taco House,393,Taking restaurant recommendations from strict vegetarians is a slippery slope.  I trust their knowledge of what good food should taste like  but I would most likely never order the same thing that a strict vegetarian orders. So while I m sure the veggie options were probably great  the meat ones were pretty hit or miss.    The fish taco tasted VERY fishy.  The Alhambre taco was very dry and bland.  The carnitas was very delicious.  And finally  the Guajolete was served with beef instead of turkey and about a cup of mole sauce.  It was basically a tortilla overflowing with mole with a sprinkling of the other ingredients.  I will say they had a delightful selection of sauces that all managed to light my tongue ablaze.  But can the food be redeemed in the fire of these sauces   Nay   Can t say I will ever be back  maybe if I stop eating meat    shudder  
Papalote Taco House,394,I love Taco Places.  Torchy s  Taco Deli  you name it  I enjoy my tacos  So today I thought I d try Papalote - I ve passed it so many times and had wanted to try it.   I had the Lunch Special - Includes 2 Guisados tacos plus rice and beans plus iced tea for  6.50. I got the Puerco con verdolagas and Aguacate con queso on corn tortillas. The Puerco con verdolagas  I m assuming this means Pork with cabbage  was FANTASTIC. As good as it gets. The Aguacate con queso  fried avocado with queso  wasn t as good to me because I m not much of a fried foods person  but still excellent     The sauces that I tried were just...soooooooooooooo good. Be careful of the red sauce  it s really hot. I like my food very  very  spicy  but even this sauce leaves my lips on fire. Yes  I meant to say lips - they really are still burning.   Yummay. The only problem I see with this place is that it s kind of far away from my place of dwelling but close to where I work  so I guess it s not that bad.
Papalote Taco House,395,I m pretty sure we come here once every week to two weeks. These tacos come through  every time  I always get the pescado and pollo parilla. I love the red salsa and the chipotle sauce on the fish taco. My boyfriend loves the verde sauce and the alambres tacos.
Papalote Taco House,396,This place is just amazing.They have a very small space but delicious tacos. I had the chicken tacos on soft corn tortilla and it was very good. Highly recommend   
Papalote Taco House,397,Fast  fresh and tasty. Tacos are huge. I ordered the chicken and vegetarian. Left full and happy.
Papalote Taco House,398,Always been a huge fan of Torchy s and Taco Deli  so I came in skeptical that there could exist another place that could compete. First time to Papalote tonight and I m a believer  Fantastic food  fantastic service. Asked for a recommendation and two different employees spent several minutes making recommendations with a passion for the food that came through in their descriptions of the ingredients. There s not a taco that you would be able to imagine that they don t have some version of. I had the Mole which was the best I ve ever had  as well as the Cecina. We will definitely be back.
Papalote Taco House,399,I was quite confused by this place. They sell T-shirts for marketing purposes  yet they have very traditional Mexican offerings. They do traditional breakfast tacos  yet the joint is very clean-cut and sleek. Austin seems to possess a masterful ability to flip a concept and just turn it sort of sleek.... very Apple-like  if you know what I mean. Even the website just seems  cute.   Having seen this for quite some time  I figured I would just drop in first for a breakfast taco to test the waters. I will most likely return in order to give some other grub a shot.  The taco fillings are quite unique  and the variety is expansive. I like that the calabaza offering. I wonder how many times a day they get asked what it is. Zucchini  for your information.  The additional  0.25 is quite affordable  especially since you can add on avocado. I got the typical large slice. My mushroom  zucchini  avocado  and poblano combination was good and hearty  but VERY underseasoned. The corn tortillas were fairly similar to the store-bought tough puppies. These guys were just sort of.. stiff.  I honestly don t know how I feel about this place  and the salsas didn t help. The red was spicy  but one-sided. The green was watered down. I just don t know about Papalote. People love them  the eatery loves itself  and  heck  Rachel Ray loves them. My experience just didn t come up to standard.
Papalote Taco House,400,Sooo good  They have delicious food and a variety of options plus it s affordable. Love coming here and can t wait to come back 
Papalote Taco House,401,An update  whoo-hoo. I think the salsa must be hit-or-miss here  and my initial review was from an off-day. When I went back recently  the salsas brought the win. The green salsa wasn t as strong as salsa do a--true--but it was limey and crisp  and thus  a more subtle  better complement to an already flavorful taco al pastor that didn t overwhelm the flavor of the meat like do a would ve.   The red salsa had a bit more pepper flavor than I remembered  too. Lots of heat  but a bit more flavor with that burn. Nice.   So  my advice  eat in. Grab a couple salsa bottles from the fridge. Maybe it s just better when it s fresh.
Papalote Taco House,402,I ve done it again. Ordered  queso  at a Mexican restaurant and was disappointed.   Note to self  stop ordering Tex Mex fare at Mexican restaurants  Everyone else  Go for the tacos  skip the queso.   Papalote makes their own green and red salsas that are fresh and amazing  Mike P. and I tried the al pastor taco  cerviche tostada  and the beef tongue taco. The beef tongue was the most tender taco I have ever tasted and the al pastor and cerviche were also very good. Fresh and not greasy.  The service was super speedy and currently Paplote is BYOB. We had a nice evening sipping beers  muching tasty tacos  and people watching from the sidewalk tables they have set up with views of south Lamar.
Papalote Taco House,403,Plenty of vegetarian options. We ordered veggie breakfast taco  hongos y epazote and tortas de coliflor along with tamarindo. All were excellent 
Papalote Taco House,404,I don t dream much but when I do I dream of Papalote s tacos. Good heat  great flavor and glorious prices. Happy smiling faces and quick service. This place has got the tacos your little heart desires so get to it  bring a friend and enjoy 
Papalote Taco House,405,I really dig this place.  These are true Mexican tacos  and other dishes  and are excellent.  As others have noted  the cauliflower tortas really stuck out - but everything I got was great.  All the mole sauces were really good  particularly the puerco en pipian.  The only miss for me was the Tlacoyos  masa cake with cheese and two sauces .  It had promise  but really lacked flavor.  It was the only thing we didn t finish.
Papalote Taco House,406,The other day I accidentally stumbled into Papalote  ordered two tacos  and rapidly devoured them in one of my more athletic bouts of speed-eating. This flavorful detour from my attempted visit to ThunderCloud subs  next door  left my tastebuds throbbing in fiery satisfaction. I enjoyed the Aguacate con Queso and the Pollo a la Parilla  both of which forced me to confront my prior disdain for cabbage and everything it stood for. Harder than it sounds. I also ordered a pepsi in a glass bottle. Who does that  Still  impulsively-bought beverages aside  I think the overall price was a little high.  To make up for this  there seemed to be very little elapsed time between ordering my food and receiving it  which is generally a good thing. I also deeply appreciated the refrigerated squeeze-bottles of salsa. The conclusive numbness in my mouth followed by a cleansing episode of runny-nose signaled the appropriate amount of spicyness  and I was content.
Papalote Taco House,407,This place is a real find. Its food is delicious and hearty with tons of great toppings on the sandwiches. The salsa is top notch  as another reviewer mentioned  and you can get tons of it. The torta cubana is a load of meats and salsa and deliciousness that will leave you rolling on the floor with a happy belly. I would generally advise the tortas as the way to go  but I ve also done the tacos and haven t been disappointed.  It s also cheap so you can eat a huge meal and be very satisfied for under  10.
Papalote Taco House,408,I could eat here every day  for every meal. Oh. My. Taco....it s amazing. Food comes out pretty quickly too  so when I m feeling hangry I know where I can get good food fast.
Papalote Taco House,409,Great Tacos at a great price. I tried the 4 vegetarian tacos available and rajas y hongos is my favorite. I loved the flavor of poblano peppers with the mushrooms. I also liked the tortas de cloliflor. Never had cauliflower in my tacos before. Very interesting  Both the salsa s were spicy. The orchata drink helped with the fire caused by the red salsa. I ordered the guacamole and it was fresh. I saw the staff make it when we ordered it.  Overall loved the food and the price. Each taco is just  3.25. I will definitely be back when I visit Austin.
Papalote Taco House,410,Best tacos in Austin-BAR NONE.  Look  I like Torchy s as much as the next guys  but Torchy s is tex-mex and Papalotes are Mexicano  all the way.  This is the kind of stuff you get on the street in D.F.  Plus  there are all kinds of special Mexican stuff you can find at Papalote s and no where else--verdolagas and  huitlacoche are the two that come immediately to mind.  Plus  the place is cute as a button  I love their collection of Cantinflas prints on the walls.  Do not stop  go directly to Papalote and have a party in your mouth.
Papalote Taco House,411,We hosted a family reunion dinner this evening - A  Taco Open House  that was a resounding success thanks to the delicious food from Papalote. We ordered small pans of Alambres  pollo a la parilla  and Puerco con verdolagas along with refried beans  rice and guacamole. Everything was delicious - the meat simmered in yummy sauces  full of flavor. I highly recommend this place. Everything was ready for pick up on time and easy to serve. The staff is terrific.
Papalote Taco House,412,Holy Moly  This place is delicious. I live just around the corner from Papalote and frequent this fantastic taco joint on the reg  Austin  as a city  is no stranger to tacos but Papalote Taco House manages to stand out in a sea of scrumptious  tortilla-y goodness. I am an especially big fan of their turkey mole taco. I cannot get enough of this delicious treat. Everything on the menu is fantastic. From the puerco en pipian to their delicious tilapia taco  Papalote hits all the right notes. If you haven t been to this place yet  get up and go  You will not be disappointed.
Papalote Taco House,413,Yums   We found Papalote while driving down Lamar when we visited Austin for Fantastic Fest. It s a small little place with about 4 tables inside maybe and a couple outside. I had their Fried avocado taco as well as the Rajas y hongos and both of them are pretty tasty. Their salsas are pretty good too  I really rather eating at papalote instead of Torchy s  my husband s favorite  The staff is also super nice and the Tacos feel more authentic to me. I try to visit as often as I can.
Papalote Taco House,414,Omg. I m not an Austin native so I m sure I don t REALLY know about breakfast tacos but man were these good  Build your own style is great  I had a egg  bacon  cheese  avocado and a chorizo with potatoes and tomatillos  Both excellent. The Horchata was so yummy and a great way to cut the heat of the salsa verde  What a treat 
Papalote Taco House,415,My fianc  found the spot while we were on vacation here. We absolutely love the tacos  They were delicious and I m so excited that they have them keto style as well. We will be back 
Papalote Taco House,416,This place is closer to a 3.5 star place than a 3 but its closer to the 3 side of the scale than the 4  does that make sense   I had been here once before back when they first opened and I got 2 AL Pastor tacos and they were OK. Nothing great about them but they were not really enough to inspire me to comeback.  Fast forward a year or so  maybe more  and Friday I had a craving for fish tacos  so I decided to give Papalote another shot as it is close to my house.  Yet again I left thinking the tacos were good but not quite what I wanted.  The things I really liked about Papalote were that they do a more interior style Mexican taco than the border style that you get at most food trailers  use of cabbage and chipoltle sauce for example .  I also liked that they can stuff a pound of toppings into a corn tortilla.  No one can ever accuse them of skimping on the toppings.  Unfortunately  the flavor just does not do it for me  and I will say for once its not them its me  they are just not my style I guess.  I would still recommend trying them for yourself.
Papalote Taco House,417,Oh  so sad... I have to dock off a star down to three...  Finally  I tried their one of their tortas  the shredded pork Pipian  pumpkin seed and chili sauce  and feel like it s the morning after waking up next to a bad decision... mushy meat  bland sauce  boring bread... why not at least toast the buns   Also  the migas are like those cigarettes you enjoyed the night before  now floating in a 3 4 empty bottle of stale beer.  This recent experience was 2 stars so I will average out to 3 because last time was great.
Papalote Taco House,418,Was in the area and passed on the other Place we were looking to go to.  Good thing. Off to Papalote as I ve been meaning to go try the place anyway.  Everything we had was very flavorful.  Adobada  pastor and Torta Poblana were had. Ahh. Sauces are good too.  Definitely be back. Unpretentious  small neighborhood feel.
Papalote Taco House,419,Small taco shop with great food  There s vegetarian options and delicious guac and queso
Papalote Taco House,420,Love all the tacos. We ve tried most of the vegetarian ones. No complaints.  The turkey Mole is also excellent. The salsas are also very good.
Papalote Taco House,421,I have been to this location and the one on research blvd up north on several locations and I enjoy this one slightly more. Both offer very good tacos at a very reasonable price.   Their breakfast tacos are my go to here eggs and three toppings  iirc  for  2 and you then pay for every additional topping. You can load it from more authentic mexican options like chorizo  chicharron  napalotes  calabaza to more standard breakfast taco toppings like regular bacon or potato and cheddar cheese.  They have a long list of other taco options like your standard al pastor  barbacoa  and lengua tacos with choice of corn or flour tortillas. There is also a couple tortas on the menu if you arent in the taco mood which have a solid mole sauce and they are all priced from  5-7. They have fresh in hosue made salsa   a verde and a red version .From the fountain they also offer drinks like Horchata.  If you are looking for a breakfast spot or a quick lunch spot and are around South Lamar this is a great option that will not disappoint and certainly exceeds value for what you pay and this is as authentic as I ve found it for a brick and mortar in Austin.
Papalote Taco House,422,Really good Torta de Coliflor  Cauliflower .  All of their vegetarian options are really good.  I haven t tried their queso yet.  Kids liked the bean and cheese tacos.  Wife didn t enjoy the chicharron taco  only reason for three vs four stars.  Go and Enjoy they cook everything in that small kitchen.
Papalote Taco House,423,Best taco place i tried in Austin    The breakfast tacos are delicious  We came from California  where there are tons of authentic Mexican restaurants and food trucks too. Compared to what we had in Los Angeles and San Diego  i d say i still prefer the classic tacos in California  e.g. lengua  but this place has absolutely amazing non-classic  new age or gourmet  tacos with bacon  etc. The place gets busy during lunch dinner hours so be ware of the long line 
Papalote Taco House,424,I ordered 3 tacos.  All 3 were made with the wrong ingredients  somehow.  I m surprised since I have never had that problem before at any other taco place.  I m not sure why the front counter clerk didn t ask me to repeat my order - I guess she didn t understand it the first time and just took her best guess   Not cool.  TL DR  Check your take-out order before you leave.
Papalote Taco House,425,I wasn t sure what to expect when I came here for a late lunch. It was somewhat pricy  and the menu was somewhat intimidating  since I had to rely on my rusty spanish to figure out what I was ordering.   Were the tacos good  Yeah. Were they good for the price  Maybe. I d like to try it out more-and I probably will  but I felt unimpressed and a bit let down.
Papalote Taco House,426,Very small. But I have been there three different times. Food is very consistent. Breakfast as well as lunch. They are very quick. It is a little warm in there but it is part of the ambiance I believe.
Papalote Taco House,427,Just grabbed a couple breakfast tacos here  both damn good. Chorizo wasn t too greasy nor too spicy. Nice savory paprika flavor balanced well with the egg. I could be wrong  but the bacon on my bacon  egg and cheese appeared to be pre-cooked  however  it was flavorful and crisp. I m guessing they dropped it in a fryer real quick  rather than a quick nuke in the micowave that often results in slightly smoky rubberbands  gross  .  The green salsa is spicier than the typically tangy and mild salsa you see around  so if that s not your thing  be careful.  Service was quick and friendly. Plus  the coffee was surprisingly good.
Papalote Taco House,428,Great authentic mexican food and great service. I recommend this place. Wonderful experience in a convenient location.
Papalote Taco House,429,A few things to try  the guacamole. I can honestly say it s the best in Austin  which means it s high on the  all-time  list as well.  The breakfast taco special  2 tacos   coffee for  3.99  is a pretty unbeatable deal. The tlacoyos is a vegetarian delight. I ve heard secondhand accounts  I m lactose intolerant  that the orchata is some of the best in Austin as well. Good for a quick lone meal or small groups  2-5   otherwise you might feel a bit cramped. All the energy that other places put into ambiance is put directly in their food. In one word  DELICIOUS. Give this place a try 
Papalote Taco House,430,We had the beef and pork tacos and the Cuban torta. The tacos were great and the torta was ok  not a fan of the hot dog.
Papalote Taco House,431,Meh.  The tacos are okay  but I ve been several times and have yet to see what the fuss is about.  Friendly service  though.  I d go to TacoDeli or even Torchy s in a heartbeat over Papalote  though.    However  if you re in the mood for a sit-down meal  I would definitely recommend heading down Lamar to Azul Tequila  which is owned by the Papalote folks and is damn good 
Papalote Taco House,432,SO GOOD  Puts all the  upity  restaurants serving the same menu to shame. Seems like paying stupid rent to be in downtown often compromises the quality of the food and service. Drive a hair further south and reap the benefits of homemade tortillas and ... everything else  Yummmm 
Papalote Taco House,433,Went here tonight for dinner w  my bestie for the 1st time. It was so delicious. Everything was very fresh. We shared the SOPE corn specialty thing--sooooo good. She got the HONGOS Y EPAZOTE and PESCADO A LAS BRASAS. I tried them and they were great. She said she thought the fish was missing something  but was tasty and fresh anyways. I got the TINGA DE RES  which had a very unique flavor. The beef was so moist and soft. I also go the RAJAS Y HONGOS and it was very flavorful--such good mushrooms  I can t wait to go back The lady behind the counter  Maria Connie  was so sweet and nice. It has very limited seating inside  and the outside tables are only for waiting.
Papalote Taco House,434,Tasty  authentic Mexican tacos...I would recommend you try some of the different meat cuts that you can t get at your typical Mexican restaurant including tongue and cheek  both super tender .
Papalote Taco House,435,Obsessed with the Torta Poblana.  The mole is delicious.  Since I discovered it a couple of weeks ago  I have had lunch there at least 6 times.   I ve had the tacos once and they were pretty good  but I ended up back with the torta.   The menu has so many great things that I am looking forward to trying 
Papalote Taco House,436,I m not a fan of tacos much  nor do I like Mexican food like that  back home in NYC   but this shit is magically delicious  Very fresh and affordable. Highly recommended and extremely jealous I do live here to eat this like 3x a week.
Papalote Taco House,437,Yuck.  I am surprised this place has a 4 star review.  My tacos seemed like they were nuked in a microwave. Too hot.  This is cardinal sin for any place trying to set itself a part as authentic mexican.  The pork filling was mushy and runny and lacking flavor. I guess there was a sauce of some sort but it was bland.  It was  10 for two bite sized tacos and a beer.  The only thing I liked was the beer.
Papalote Taco House,438,A buddy told me about this new taco place....what he didn t mention is that it s by the same folks who run Azul Tequila...so it explains why they obviously know what they are doing.  The menu is varied and if it was available on paper instead of being laminated  I would have snagged one.  At least 15-20 different taco s to chose from.  Some torta s and other items too.  Unfortunately  my mind being old and such I can t remember the name of the taco I ordered.  It was large chunks of pork  stewed to perfection in a green sauce.  Topped with crisp shredded cabbage and white chunks of cheese.  Almost Feta like  but not quite.  Wrapped in two corn tortillas  not made on site   the taco was succulent  juicy and very tasty.    The atmosphere was spartan and clean and comes off as an upscale taco shack.    The service was incredibly quick  3-5 minutes  considering it was right   noon.  These are big tacos with an equally big price -  3.52 for a taco  after taxes  - a little steep especially when compared to 4 for  5 at Al Pastor.    I ll be back to try some more...
Papalote Taco House,439,I love Palalote  They are one of my regular taco spots  I ve had more than half of the menu  maybe 3 4 of the menu   and the fillings are cooked to perfection  the flavor is explosive and the taste is fantastic. If they had homemade tortillas it would be a 5 star experience.
Papalote Taco House,440,Let me start this review by saying that I actually really do not like tacos or Mexican food in general. Blasphemous for living in Texas  I know. However  what I don t like more than tacos is the fact that I am a big pushover and agree to go most places my friends would like to go out to dinner. So. Guess how I ended up on Papalote Taco one weekday evening.  However  I m thrilled to report that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Perhaps more than my Mexican preferring pal. Papalote s a taco joint that just has a certain je ne sais quoi wafting through its walls and meals. While the set up and ambiance is nothing fancy shmancy blue brick on the inside and the interior is about the size of a medium sized restaurant s bathroom...a few chairs and tables outside  nothing to write home about...their menu is fresh  innovative and tastes gourmet combining simple ingredients with perfect flavor punches. For those who like Torchy s but feel guilty about the greasy calorificness of the joint- papalote possess the same kick of flavors but with 1 8 the grease. I left feeling full but nourished. And their plantain dessert...be still my heart.  I can safely say that if I was a big Mexican fan  it would tip the scale and send Papalote smooth sailing into 5-stardom and a top contender in both my yelp and mental  best places to chow down in austin  lists.
Papalote Taco House,441,I love this place  There isn t a ton of space in the seating area  and there are signs up saying the outdoor seating area is for waiting only  which is a bummer  Everything my group got was magnificent  I did order a black bean pancake stuffed with potatoes  not great. Seriously though  everything else was delicious. I can t even remember what specifically we all got  which I know isn t helpful for the review  but we got five different tacos and loved every one of them. The flour and corn tortillas are delicious  can t go wrong there. The staff are friendly  and they have beer  We will be back 
Papalote Taco House,442,Such a hidden gem  The breakfast tacos are always good and the sauces are made in house daily. The staff is very friendly and quick. One of our favorite places in Austin
Papalote Taco House,443,I know two people who wrecked at this intersection where papalote is.I try to avoid this stretch of lamar as a rule of life in Austin..Drove by the spoke today and man was it depressing..Hello condo town...the one bright light of this part of a shamelessly changing Austin is Papalote..for real.  Awesome real Mexican street tacos..I have experienced the real thing on a few trips and this is a close as it gets in A town..nice people...crazy small kitchen.  I hope they move to better location...The whole stretch of Lamer is going to be one huge condo soon.
Papalote Taco House,444,I don t think I ve had tacos that are as flavorful anywhere in Austin. I don t now how this crew working in such a tiny kitchen can produce such awesomeness. The mole is to die for  which makes me regret being a new vegetarian now  and the avocados are always fresh and perfectly ripe. It has great vegetarian options including pablano peppers and cactus. Getting on here made me see that there s a north location too which is fantastic since I was regretting moving up here and missing Papalote tacos.
Papalote Taco House,445,Fast and delicious for breakfast tacos. We love the bacon  egg and avocado on corn. The horchata is also delicious.
Papalote Taco House,446,Total find...just came across the place at the end of a long bike read and had thoughts of food hitting me hard.   From the outside  nice and chill with a small  outdoor seating area.  This place is authentic with language in Spanish.  Go inside and yeah...it makes sense.  Old school cooking.    I hit the first two items on the menu.  POLLO A LA PARILLA Achiote rubbed grilled chicken topped with poblano pepper rajas  cabbage  queso fresco  and a slice of fresh avocado.  3.25  ALAMBRES Grilled steak and bacon topped with poblano peppers  onions  provolone cheese  and a slice of fresh avocado. 3.25  Pretty reasonable prices     Well  the tacos were very very good and they bring two bottles of their secret sauce salsas which are fantastic.  Once is a spicey red  looks orange  sauce and the other a verde colorado sauce.   The taco s are great without the sauce  but with the sauce...even better.  All in all...can t lose food experience at excellent pricing.   In addition  these people have a cool website that runs counter to their home cooking experience.   What   ...that makes them even curious.  I like that.
Papalote Taco House,447,I was on a quest down S. Lamar to finally try Giovanni s Pizza  and NOTHING was going to stop me this time. Nothing  that is  except for the little sign on the counter that greeted me and declared them closed for the day due to some problem that I can t remember.  Well  dammit. Now I m starving and my bold foodie plans are all shot to hell. What to do   I guess I ll just head back up Lamar and see if I can fi...hey  wait  what s that little hole-in-the-wall across the street  Papalote  Tacos  Sure  why not   And boy  was I glad I did. Simply the best Lengua I ve EVER had.  OK  yeah  I know  Lengua is not for everyone  but they have a ton of other choices for the less adventurous.  My second choice was the Pastor  and it passed with flying colors as well.  Overall  the prices and quality of the tacos are on par with Torchy s and Tacodeli  and although the place is comparatively tiny  they seem to offer more items on the menu.  All of which I want to try  so I ll definitely be back before long.
Papalote Taco House,448,Service is great. The tacos are phenomenal. Highly recommend the Cachete  cauliflor  and guajalote de mole.   The breakfast tacos are awesome too.
Papalote Taco House,449,this place is mad good  but word to other vegans out there.. chicky stock in the red sauce.  just ask to skip that along with all the other queso fresco and cream sauce  etc and they have a fair amount of options.  the  3.50 margarita is effing good.
Papalote Taco House,450,One of the best authentic Hispanic Spanish place to get food in town. One of those hole in the wall type of places where they serve amazing food that s 100  authentic. Will come back and recommend this place 
Papalote Taco House,451,These tacos didn t meet my expectations. I m from the valley  South Texas  and I m used to some real corn tortillas. Completely disappointed because it has good reviews. Their tortillas are bought and didn t have enough chicken  like 3 small pieces in each taco . It also lacked flavor. Their salsa was good though. I almost crashed trying to find this place and realized that it wasn t worth going. Oh well..still trying to look for a good taco place. Any suggestions 
Papalote Taco House,452,I have  never  had anything on the menu that wasn t scrumptious. Pescado  Mole  salsa verde  salsa roja  ALL YUM   I wish I didn t have to spend  7.50 on two tacos though.  Their size would have you thinking they run more like  2.50  rather than  3.50 but I ll totally still go back.    Oh- and don t try to go with a large group.  This place is about the size of the inside of my Mazda 4 door.  Update  I just got the  6.50 lunch special  THAT is the way to go.  Two tacos   rice   beans   iced tea  for  7 after tax.
Papalote Taco House,453,We went in because we were close and needed tacos and walked out happy and fed. The tacos were cheep  rivaled torchys  and served margaritas for  3.50  It s a small place that s easy to miss but worth it for the shredded turkey with mole sauce so says my meat eating wife  where as I was very impressed with the mushroom and cauliflower patty vegetarian options  The staff were friendly and quick to serve up the tacos and add some sauces to up the flavor if we wanted. We will definitely be back.
Papalote Taco House,454,Amazing tacos.  Great selection of interesting  well-made recipes.  Coming from San Francisco  my expectations for taco filling selection is only as exotic as al pastor and carnitas  so I was very excited to see a menu full of things I didn t recognize.  I tried a standard tilapia  a shredded pork loin mole  and a grilled chicken  then got a shredded beef and pork with green sauce to go.  The ingredients all tasted fresh and high-quality.  Each taco had it s own subtle interesting flavors.  Both the red and green salsas on the table were great.  Caveats... I don t live in Austin  so I m giddy about any tex-mex or tacos I eat here.
Papalote Taco House,455,I ve been here twice. Firat time I ordered nothing because there was no appeal in the smell or look of the food. Second time I just picked the Banderillas which turned out are taquitos. In the menu description it tells you exactly what you get on your food. They did not include that there would be onions or that the whole taco is fried. It only said fried beef. When I recieved my food after 30 minutes  it was hot and fresh from the fryer and oozing oil. The Banderillas scraped my intestine as they went down  very painful  and I started feeling sick as I started eating the second one. I ended up throwing up an hour later after much dry heaving and sweating. For me I will never go anywhere near this place again. As for everyone else who eats here  enjoy your greasy tacos and other fast food.
Papalote Taco House,456,I keep wanting to try new tacos from the menu  but I can t get away form the Alambres taco- SOOOO GOOD 
Papalote Taco House,457,I LOVE their lunch special   It s an awesome deal  2 tacos  sides of black beans and rice  and an iced tea for  6.50.  This is quite possibly my favorite lunch deal in town.    I m pescatarian and there are 5 taco options that fit my diet   which is great because I can switch up my order with each visit.  I highly recommend  the Hongos y Epazote  their amazing mushroom tacos .  And you really have to try the Tortas de Coliflor  cauliflower tacos .  They make their own hot sauces in house  one green and one red  that both compliment the tacos nicely.   They date the sauce bottles so you can tell how fresh it is.   The tea is fine  nothing to write home about  but I have to be sure not to drink more than a glass or 2 per visit because it gets me wired.  Overall  a great place to bring friends for lunch.  Don t overlook this South Austin gem 
Papalote Taco House,458,This place is GREAT   The people are super friendly  The cauliflower taco is what very one says it is   AMAZING.  It is cooked in some amazing spices and melts in your mouth.  I say this is a must your first time. They serve breakfast all day which is great and today I got two breakfast tacos and a coffee for  2.99.  Pretty amazing deal  The breakfast tacos have generous portions of eggs and the ingredients of your choice.  Actually  too much for me   I could have eaten just one. I opted for eggs  poblano and avocado...MMMM     Lots of all ingredients and yummy   I also got cactus  eggs and potatoes.  Yummy   I have never eaten cactus in a taco and it had great flavor and texture. Their red salsa is my favorite- it packs punch but also has the flavor.  The green sauce packs a lot of punch and a little less flavor.   I do wish the menu had a couple of plate options  like migas  which is why I didn t give it a 5 star.  I know what they have and do is good  but more options from their little kitchen would be better 
Papalote Taco House,459,Went here for the first time for dinner last night and it was a good overall experience. It wasn t crowded when we walked in and ordered right away. We asked what the woman behind the counter like best and tried her favorites  Purco con Verdolagas  Pastor  and Alambres. We also got queso and rajas con crema to munch on as well. We found a spot inside to sit  it s pretty snug in there  and the food came out quickly.   The rajas con crema are a yummy veggie appetizer that s a good alternative to other dips. The queso was pretty plain standard  I think it needed more kick. It was really good when we added the salsa verde to it. The pastor taco was tender  with a hint of sweetness. I added salsa verde and the other red salsa to it and couldn t put it down. The alambres was very good too  I wish I could ve eaten more but my boyfriend ate it too fast  The purco con verdolagas was fine  but not really my favorite taste.   I can t wait to come back and try more. Next time I ll be daring and try the tongue everyone talks about.
Papalote Taco House,460,How have I not discovered this place of awesomeness sooner   On the recommendation of a foodie friend  but after  of course  noticing that Yelpers give it good marks as well   I popped into Papalote recently for a late lunch. I walked in expecting a typical taco joint  I quickly discovered a menu with as much variety as one would find at a place like the renowned Tacodeli   This place is a little easy to miss  sandwiched into a tiny spot next to Thundercloud in the  Austinville    78704ville    strip mall. Nicely decorated considering its lowly heritage as a cinder block building -- notable exception  the bathroom  which has way too many cleaning products stored haphazardly in it -- the menu is full of intriguing items  but I went with the alambres  guajolote en mole and adobada.  Side note  the tacos are quite large  and three is easily enough to sate even the hungriest appetites.  All were nothing short of incredible and unique  no small feat in a town crawling with Tex-Mex joints  although I d classify Papalote as much more interior-Mexican than anything else  with a few deviations into pleasant turf like fish tacos .  I no longer live in the  04 and am regrettably no longer in the area that often -- as opposed to before  when I d drive by Papalote literally every day -- but I shall definitely be back 
Papalote Taco House,461,Finally   Original Mexican food.  Who would think that to be unique in Austin all you have to do is go back to the roots. This food is authentic and so well thought out  but yet still the simplistic meal you look for when eating Mexican. I have to have lunch here at least once a week--and even better--I can actually afford to. Hopefully more Papalote s will dot the map in other areas of Austin. Because until then my fellow Austinites are missing out on a killer meal. What a treat  
Papalote Taco House,462,Dear Papalote   Thank you thank you for creating the guajolote en mole taco. This taco has saved me from going into full blown hangry  hungry angry  mode  amp  calmed me down like a binky does for a baby  or like a chup n soothes a chiflada . And then last night  after a brutal 4 mile jog around Town Lake  I treated myself to not only my usual but also your sope with chicken...  nombre  whatever was hurting my knee went away. You re like Vitacilina  but for the tummy   Until next time  amigos
Papalote Taco House,463,If ever a place could make me forget about some of the chain taco restaurants in town that get so much un-warranted praise  it is this place   Absolutely the best tacos I ve had in South Austin. The lunch special is like  7 and includes a drink  plus 2  gourmet-style  tacos.
Papalote Taco House,464,My TO-GO order of three taco  egg  and cheese tacos took 45 minutes with it being very quiet and not crowded at all. When it was 35 min of waiting I asked about how much longer  they still didn t have them even started. Then they finally started making them  they gave me no apologies  and I had to ask if I could get a drink while I waited. They didn t give me any thing extra for my time or anything. When the lady gave me my Tacos she said  sorry  under her voice very quietly. The tacos were good but it was dead in there- honestly don t know how in the world it could have taken almost an hour for 3 simple to go tacos. Very disappointed.
Papalote Taco House,465,Wow... I love coming here.  My first impression of this taco house was that the salsa was f-ing amazing.  If you can t handle spice  then don t try the salsa   but wow... delicious.    The tacos did not fail to impress either.  You can see all the fresh ingredients behind in the kitchen  and they make it so fast  yet detailed  that each taco bite  with some salsa on top  is almost heavenly.  They offer at least 3 delicious veggie options   Not just plain old left over veggies thrown into a taco haha.  I d highly recommend people to come try it out.  It can get very crowded for a very small taco house  so get their early 
Papalote Taco House,466,Papalote is the perfect example of a Austin based company that is building a great brand. I thoroughly enjoy my visits to Papalote for the simple fact of great service and how quickly they work to get your simple order of tacos ready. Often times I visit a taco place and it takes 15 minutes to get my order. If you are looking for a staple taco place in town you have to try Papalote. They are a small company that started here in town and they are looking to expand. My favorite tacos on the menu are the Adobada which has marinated pork with fresh nopales  don t leave it out if you order this taco  it just makes it better   or the simple chorizo taco with refirend beans  cabbage and queso fresco  or the guajolote en mole. Go now and try them 
Papalote Taco House,467,Best breakfast tacos in town. A million times better then torchys    Every single time they have been spot on.
Papalote Taco House,468,Did you really think that I wouldn t notice   You accidentally gave my order to a gentleman that took my tacos to his car  unwrapped them  realized they weren t his and brought them back in.   No worries  accidents happen.  BUT  I watched you take the tacos out of his unwrapped foil  rewrap them in  fresh  foil and bring them to me after he had manhandled those same tacos in his car.  NO...so many levels of NO.  Needless to say  I won t be back...I don t care how good your tacos are 
Papalote Taco House,469,So much hype... I wasn t very impressed with these tacos.   I had the lunch special that came with a drink  2 tacos  I had Tinga de res and Fried avocado   amp  side of rice and beans.   The avocado one was nothing special. The tinga had good flavor. The rice was pretty good  but the beans were very bland.   If you want good tacos  I would suggest torchys or izzos.  But if you want amazing tacos  go to taco deli   
Papalote Taco House,470,The food here is delicious.  I ve gotten quite a few things from here  but during my most recent trip I got the tinga de res taco  the tlacoyos  and the arroz con leche. The tlacoyos had great texture and flavor was enhanced by the spicy green and red salsas on top. The pulled beef almost melted in my mouth because it was so tender  and the sweetness of the plantains was held at bay by the queso fresco and the powerful spices of the beef. The arroz con leche had decent flavoring  but it was cold in some areas and hot in others  so I think they just nuked it. The raisins on top were dried out and had no juiciness in them  and I would ve preferred a little less leche in the dessert overall.  I d definitely say this is one of the best spots for close-to-authentic Mexican tacos and food in South Austin  so if you haven t tried it yet  I highly recommend it. Be careful of their house salsa on the tables though  they pack a serious punch.
Papalote Taco House,471,This place is great when they are not busy and when they are busy its pointless. They need more than one register. Old school business style in a thriving city just doesnt get you 5 stars on yelp no matter how good the food is or how nice the people are. I shouldnt have to wait 40 minutes for breakfast tacos due to your inefficient business model.
Papalote Taco House,472,Didn t feel like these tacos lived up to the good reviews. Tacos were pretty cold and nothing special. Didn t even finish the cauliflower taco I ordered. With so many good places for tacos in Austin I know you can do better than this.
Papalote Taco House,473,I ordered 3 things on my visit  ceviche tostada  alambres taco  and the pescado a las brasas.  Overall I thought the food was good  the fish taco was my favorite   but I wouldn t go out of my way to go here.
Papalote Taco House,474,I wanted to add meat to a tostada  but they said it was not possible unless I paid for a taco and a tostada  but only ended up with a tostada . That is not a reasonable up charge to add meat. I tried to get a certain type of meat in a sope  too  but apparently that is limited. Beware - this is not a place that you can customize your order. If you want the options they have listed  it is fine  but don t expect to be able to modify anything else.
Papalote Taco House,475,Great variety of flavors and good vegetarian options  And they serve desert-like platano  A very cozy spot and it looks very organized and clean. This places gives off good vibes.
Papalote Taco House,476,It has become a habit to take a family trip to Papalote and order 5 or 6 different things for everyone to share.  Half the time  I don t even know what I m eating.  But so far  I have loved almost everything  the one exception being a chorizo taco...a little chorizo goes a long way.  I especially loved the beef cheek tacos...so tender 
Papalote Taco House,477,I have a baaaadd breakfast taco habit  and the tacos here are some of my favorites. The Alambres  steak  bacon  avocado  poblanos  provolone   the Guajolote en Mole  turkey in mole sauce   and the Tortas de Coliflor  vegetarian cauliflower cakes that you would swear contain some sort of meat  are particular favorites  and they ve also got some interesting breakfast taco options  including chicharon  calabaza  green beans  and cactus  in addition to the usual ingredients.  Keep in mind that the restaurant itself is only a glorified walk-up counter. Seating is extremely limited  as is ambience. My strategy is generally to call in a to-go order for pickup  and it s ready in 10 minutes. Make sure to check your receipt and your bag though  as I would say some aspect of my phone order is misunderstood about 50  of the time.
Papalote Taco House,478,I loooooove me some Papalote.  The cauliflower tacos are quite possibly the best vegetarian taco in Austin.  The salsas are too spicy for me  but I realize I m a wuss  as I am not a native Texan.  While the tacos are possibly the best  their bathroom is perhaps the creepiest.  I have only had the pleasure twice  and both visits were equally disturbing.  Before you enter please be prepare for the following...it is dark  as 1 lightbulb is missing so any stains or bugs are easily camouflaged.  You will be able to see urine sitting in the unflushed urinal.  Then you have the pleasure of sitting  ladies  directly across from some sort of black  serial killer shower curtain.  I m not sure what is behind there.  Could be a murder.  Could be a dead body.  I am fairly certain Michael Meyers is going to pop out from behind there while a flush the toilet with a zip tie attached to a rusty screw.     Get a taco  and relieve yourself elsewhere.
Papalote Taco House,479,We are on a mission to find the best breakfast tacos around and keep coming back to Papalote.  They are cheap and yummy and the service is fast.  They don t skimp on the meat  which is cut up so you get some in every bite AND they know how to cook chorizo just right.  Wish they had more outdoor seating but that seems to be related to some zoning issue as there are signs inside and out stating outdoor tables are a waiting area only...   Weird  but OK.  Large parking lot and we ve never had to stand in line more than 5 min to get place our order.
Papalote Taco House,480,Cheap  delicious tacos. Unassuming appearances mask a master stroke of Tex-Mexican comfort food. Pro tip  order ahead for weekend brunch  the word is getting out.
Papalote Taco House,481,In a city where you are surrounded by tacos I have to say  not my favorite. I am only writing this review on the two tacos I had  Mole and pastor  although the inside of the taco was fine I feel the tortilla will make or break a taco. This tortilla tasted like a cold Mission tortilla straight out of the package. A big thanks goes out to the Red sauce for Saving my taco
Papalote Taco House,482,Best tacos hands down I ve ever had.  Pastor on corn is one those things you look at  and say to yourself. .. yes  I know what that s going to taste like  then you try it and your face melts in joyful surprise at how much better than average it is. .. I could a Pastor on corn from this joint every day for the rest of my life.
Papalote Taco House,483,Came in with 4 people and we all ordered different tacos.  All were good and the price is right.  I m glad we made this stop.
Papalote Taco House,484,I was there  this sunday morning  the breakfast tacos are awesome also lungua and pastor but the woman at the counter very bad attitude
Papalote Taco House,485,Ok  ....Um...If i were to be born a breakfast taco  then I would be a child of Papalote  Dayuum  This place will make you slap yo Momma 
Papalote Taco House,486,I had a weekly meeting at this place with some good friends if mine while Dan s hamburger was being renovated. I must ve gone here for about six months every week. The tacos are good  but nothing out of this world. What you need to know is that the place is CRAWLING with roaches. I pointed them out twice to the lady behind the counter to which she replied  yeah  the come from the street. Thankfully Dan s is back on...I know I didn t have to go there  but it was convenient for the others. My recommendation to management  clean the place up  hire pest control  and don t dismiss your clients concern for cleanliness.
Papalote Taco House,487,Awesome tacos   Even have gf and exciting veggie version. Best tacos I ve had in Austin  
Papalote Taco House,488,I love this place. My home away from home. Many breakfasts were spent eating and getting fluffy for winter. Breakfast tacos can be ordered sans tortilla if you re feeling low-carb  or too carbed . Much more authentic than that one taco place with the mouse logo  You know what I m talking about. Grab some tacos to go and die happy.
Papalote Taco House,489,I give this place one star  instead of zero  because there weren t any bugs in our food. Other than the lack of vermin  this place was a huge disappointment  especially considering its rave reviews. Their horchata was way too sweet and one of the tacos I ordered was full of pig skin. I lived in the 3rd world for several years  and I ve actually eaten my fair share of pig skin  but this stuff was vile and ill-prepared.
Papalote Taco House,490,This is my go to taco spot  Their chips and guac is amazing. The only thing I don t like is that they don t serve rice on the weekend...  Also seating is limited.
Papalote Taco House,491,I wasn t blown away by the tacos here  but I think it takes a lot to seperate a taco from a TAC-OH ...  It was my first go-around at the Papalote Taco House  and I d probably return if I was feeling lazy and didnt want to make the trek to Torchy s. The grilled steak taco with provalone was yummy  but didnt give me that  sweet baby Jesus   feeling. I just really really wanted that steak to melt in my mouth....I m daydreaming about it right now...  It did the trick - good taco  good service  meh.
Papalote Taco House,492,Great food  Great price  Really fast.  Love the tacos here. The lunch special is very generous. Tried the Fried Avocado  Tinga de Res  and Puerco en Pipian... those were delicious. However my faves were the classics... Lengua and the absolute best Pastor I have every had.  The service here is great they are always very kind and quick.
Papalote Taco House,493,LOVE LOVE LOVE   Excellent  bold flavors and a wide variety of options.  Can t wait to return 
Papalote Taco House,494,Horrible service   they got my order totally wrong so when I got home  I could not eat my food then I called them and nicely told them my order was incorrect and they said   maybe you forgot but that s what you ordered   omg    I don t eat beef since 2 years ago... maybe I forgot I magically start eating beef again   she also rudely told me well you are not here anymore so how can I believe you    OMG aim so upset .
Papalote Taco House,495,The food is ok... Portions are normal but I believe they are overpriced. A ceviche tostada for 5.25   Chips are not free like in every Mexican place and if you want them you have to order guacamole which comes in a very small portion  and then yes you get plenty of chips. We had 4 tacos  one huarache and two tamarind waters for 30.
Papalote Taco House,496,Great authentic Mexican food.  Love the cabbage they add to the tacos  brings out a Yummy flavor.   I have to say their tacos are better than torchys  No long lines either. A new favorite place to eat thats close to my work.
Papalote Taco House,497,I stopped by here on a recent work trip to Austin. Boy am I glad I discovered this gem  Awesome little place.  Food came out quick and the staff was helpful in providing suggestions. I will be back next time I m in Austin  I m craving tacos from Papalote 
Papalote Taco House,498,I really wanted to like this place  since it s so close to my house  Unfortunately  I didn t have the best experience.   1  The wait was a bit excessive. Almost 30 minutes for two tacos  when there were only  3 orders in front of mine...all breakfast taco orders.  2  Missing ingredients. I ordered a taco with cactus and avocado. That s it. Not a difficult order  so I don t know how you miss adding the avocado   3  Not enough dining space.  The outside area is apparently for  waiting  only. So if you want to actually eat there  you have to snag one of the four tables inside. If I had been able to eat outside  I would ve noticed the missing avocado BEFORE I got home... 4  Adding extra ingredients  Yup  that s right. On one of my tacos they left off an ingredient and on the other  they added one... The worst possible ingredient  Cilantro.  shudders   It s the bane of my existence.  If you re going to add ingredients  you should at least tell the customer or clarify that on the menu...especially one as polarizing as cilantro   shudders again   I will give them props for tasty flour tortillas and the salsa verde. I also was happy my chorizo taco didn t have grease running throughout the foil wrapper.  Maybe today was a fluke...but there are too many other taco options in this city  for me to risk another unprovoked cilantro attack.
Papalote Taco House,499,Very good tacos. A ton of meat  great flavor  i had the adobaba and the tingres...something. Better than torchys  and more filling than tacodeli
Papalote Taco House,500,If you want real Mexican tacos do not waste your time  and especially your money  as it will cost you an arm and three legs
Licha's Cantina,1,I have been craving Licha since I tried it on my last visit to Austin earlier this month. The only thing wrong with this place is that it s not in Colorado where I live and I have no idea when I will be blessed to have it again. Seriously  the food here is on a whole different level and I can t even begin to explain it.   Happy hour is a killer deal  but don t make my mistake and order 5 different plates thinking it s going to small portions. Our server gave me a funny look lol and then warned me  but I hadn t eaten all day and we were starving. Yeah  big mistake should have listened to her lol. The portions are HUGE. They don t skimp on anything here. Protein to starch ratio is fair and that s rare anymore today.   Everything we had was amazing  but my absolute favorite dish was hands down the Suadero  note not a happy hour offering  but for  17 could easily feed 2-4 people . It s an amazing crispy brisket confit  that s perfectly juicy and seasoned to perfection. My mouth is water just thinking about it. Try it  you ll thank me I promise.   I also cannot forget the mention their cocktail menu is out of this world. So many incredible options and they are tasty    This is a must try establishment. Come for the food  soak up the ambience of the beautiful historic home that houses this gem  while sipping on some damn hood cocktails.
Licha's Cantina,2,Great food  super friendly waiter. We came on a rainy and cold Friday night for an early dinner  without reservation . We were seated right away on the back patio area. The warm heater above us kept us comfortable.  Food was great  Ambience was upbeat and energetic. We would come here again.
Licha's Cantina,3,Licha s is always solid for happy hour and apps. The staff is really great. Food is flavorful. Honestly the chips and salsa they provide is next level. The Dona sauce is flavorful and hits you with the right amount of spice. The salsa  which chipotle   is really good that we had to get extra. Chips tend to be on the saltier side so expect to drink a lot of water. The hurache was a great deal for being  8 during happy hour. The mole is deep and rich.  With hurache  chips  amp  salsa  and the Paloma drink it was a solid meal.
Licha's Cantina,4,Do not let the outside appearance fool you  this place is legit   We sat at the bar  very small bar that fit about 8 seats.  There was a wall of tequila magic.  The anejo Manhattan is a must  so tasty.  Hubs and I shared the brisket build your own tacos and still had brisket left over.  Tender and delicious.  I appreciated the simplicity. It comes with a small ramiken of pickled veggies  cauliflower  carrots and jicima   The homemade corn tortillas were thin and warm.  Will make the 3 hour drive from Dallas to eat here again soon.
Licha's Cantina,5,Lichas is one of the restaurants I always enjoy while on the east side. Last time I went  I ordered the mole con pollo huarache which tasted great. I wish it came with a side tho. We also ordered the ceviche for the table. The ceviche was good  nothing out of this world. They do provide chips and salsas for the table  which in my opinion are one of best chip  amp  salsa combo in Austin. Definitely recommend getting their mezcal margarita or their margarita pitcher.    The server we got was friendly  but did take long to come and check on our table. I suggest you make a reservation beforehand as the wait time can be up to 2 hours.
Licha's Cantina,6,Just had dinner there again  queso fundido is still great  marg pitcher great  everything else meh.  I m sorry  I feel like I ve given this place a true try  and it just never meets my expectations. You wait 1 hour for a table  and your food is just meh. The queso is good  the guac is ok  the rest is just big meh.  I had the quesadillas with bacon this time and honestly just could have lived without ever trying them. The Al pastor tacos meet is good but I don t like pineapple so ok  cool. And the goat Barbacoa taco was good.  Once again  not enough for me to come back unless my friends really want me too.
Licha's Cantina,7,Licha s Cantina is currently  46 on my list of one hundred and forty taco locations.  AustinTacoMojo.com  The menu description for The Verduras Tacos includes roasted sweet potato  mushrooms  corn  squash  cabbage  and pepitas -- yum  They would have earned a higher rating if the chef had not included yellow squash and zucchini as the obligatory filler vegetables. This is a pet peeve of mine and with no mention of either of those in the description  it was a major let-down when my dish arrived. The salsa was great  more of that  please. The ambiance was adorable and the staff was sweet and accommodating.
Licha's Cantina,8,This place had good atmosphere with Spanish music and cute outdoor seating. They had a big table outside to accommodate our big group of 7 people too. Definitely put your name down even if the wait is long because they told us the wait was 2 hours  but were able to call us back in 10 min.   However  the food overall was very mediocre. The waiter said their best seller was the birria tacos  so i ordered that but thought it was slightly soggy. I ve definitely had better birria tacos in California.
Licha's Cantina,9,Licha s continues to be one of my favorite spots in Austin. I love coming here for dinner with friends and bringing any out of town visitors here for a dinner before going out.  The ceviche and the pitchers of spicy margs are my favorite to order for the table  and for myself I can never go wrong ordering the gordita.
Licha's Cantina,10,First time in Austin and stumbled into this restaurant late last night.   Ambiance 10 10 Chicken Huarache 10 10  Unfortunately the bartender was very off putting. Maybe he was busy but if I go back I would prefer to sit at a table. Customer service is probably better table side instead of the bar.
Licha's Cantina,11,This is probably one of the hardest reviews for me to do because I feel like my words can t do this place enough justice  Licha s is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Austin ever since I remember and have been living in this city  there have been countless memories with family  friends  acquaintances and strangers  its characteristic and authentic menu and its emblematic drinks  Daniel the owner of this restaurant together with his incredible team have managed to win respect and heart from both locals and visitors  its drinks that intoxicate not only your body but also your heart from La Bonita that reminds you of that fresh horchata water with a sensual and fun touch of rum  its refreshing Lupita with a spicy and sweet touch that they take you back to that childhood with Mexican sweets of watermelon with chili peppers but in its version now for adults  its margaritas that not only refresh you on warm Austin afternoons but also they put you in an atmosphere of total fun and good vibes  from the music playlist that surprises all of us who grew up with songs in the 80 s to 00 s in Spanish  without a doubt if you have not had to visit Mexico  this restaurant is one of the best options to prepare your palate   from the famous and creamy Esquite  the refreshing and citrus ceviche to those Sopecitos  Huaraches and Quesadillas that make you salivate just by seeing them. I recommend you to take advantage of their happy hour and let the flavor party enter your life.  Probablemente esta es una de las revisiones m s dif ciles para mi de hacer por que siento que mis palabras no le pueden hacer justicia a este lugar y que me voy a quedar corto  ya que Licha s es sin duda uno de mis restaurantes favoritos en Austin desde que recuerdo y llevo viviendo en esta ciudad  han sido incontables memorias con familiares  amigos  conocidos y desconocidos  su men  tan caracter stico y aut ntico y sus bebidas emblem ticas  Daniel el due o de este restaurante junto con su incre ble equipo han logrado ganarse el respeto y coraz n tanto de locales como visitantes  sus bebidas que te embriagan no solo el cuerpo si no tambi n el coraz n desde la Bonita que te recuerda a esa agua fresca de horchata con un toque sensual y jovial del ron  su refrescante Lupita con toque picosito y dulce que te remontan a esa ni ez con dulces mexicanos de sand a con chilito pero en su versi n ahora para adultos  sus margaritas que no solo te refrescan en las tardes c lidas de Austin si no que ponen en un ambiente de total diversi n y buenas vibras  desde el playlist de m sica que sorprende a todos aquellos que crecimos con  xitos en espa ol  sin duda si no les ha tocado visitar Mexico este restaurante es una de las mejores opciones para preparar tu paladar  desde el famoso y cremoso esquite   el refrescante y acidito ceviche hasta esos Sopecitos  huaraches y quesadillas que te hacen salivar solo de verlos. Les recomiendo aprovechar su hora feliz y dejar que la fiesta de sabor entre a su vida.
Licha's Cantina,12,To the ambiance  service  and food everything was a 10 10 here. It brought me back to eating at my grandmas house  I got tinga soupitos and an escite both tasted like something my mom and grandma make very very delicious.
Licha's Cantina,13,Finally had the chance to check this place out and we really enjoyed their gourmet take on Mexican food. As soon as we were seated  we were presented with my favorite tortilla chips and salsa. I love thick  fresh tortilla chips and I despise the thin chips that get soggy the minute they are dipped in salsa. Speaking of salsa  the green salsa was by far my favorite  but you better like heat. For the table we dined on the champinon huaraches  esquite  camote  ceviche  and the shrimp and fish tacos and all were delicious  I am a huge fan of tres leches and got my heart broken when our waiter came back to tell me that on a Wednesday at 6 45  they had already run out of dessert  Talk about soul-crushing  The next time  I will order my cake first and have it set aside so I do not leave slightly disappointed again.
Licha's Cantina,14,We had great service  but the food fell short.   The guac lacked any flavor and the nuts were a weird touch. The queso was good and chorizo was a great addition. The steak tacos were okay. The flavor was good  tortillas fresh  but the meat was just over cooked and really tough.
Licha's Cantina,15,Stopped by here during happy hour on a hot summer day and I have to say I was not disappointed  The atmosphere is one which I love from Austin where you find a variety of people wanting to relax and enjoy some good food and cocktails  Although I don t remember our waiters name I have to say he was absolutely incredible  I m sure you ll be able to spot him  he s got colored spikes hair which matches his personality fun and unique  he offered us a ton of great recommendations on both the happy hour menu and regular menu. I would suggest if you go with a group you try and order a variety and eat family style because there are so many great menu selections I really couldn t just pick one  they were all that good  A must stop restaurant when your on the East side 
Licha's Cantina,16,This place is a MUST try  We got the goat Barbados Birria tacos  the enchiladas and the chorizo queso. They taste like they are made with love and the staff are very helpful and nice. We also got a pitcher of the margarita and it was definitely a crowd pleaser.
Licha's Cantina,17,Enjoyed a relaxing Saturday afternoon at Licah s after biking around Austin all day.  Watermelon margs  hold the spice  were on point  and my scallops dish was incredible   Super dog friendly place  it s a place you can fit right in solo  on a date or with a group of friends.  Def some of my fav food  amp  drink I had in Austin.  Will visit again soon  amp  hopefully the scallops are still on the menu 
Licha's Cantina,18,I looooove Licha s Cantina  Their happy hour is east side perfection   I ve been going for years. I always order the sopecitos and quesadillas. Everything always tastes bomb  Except this last time I was there... the sopecito de tinga tasted way off. The waitress noted that I hadn t taken more than a bite from the sope  so I told her that it just did not taste good at all. She apologized and took it off our bill  which I appreciated  thank you  .  No biggie  maybe was just an off day. I always support Licha s - definitely an Eastside must 
Licha's Cantina,19,This place used to be better.  We used to slip into Licha s for dinner when around East Austin  or dessert when we d had dinner elsewhere.  The flan was that good.  They don t have the flan anymore  so we figure we ll have what they do have.  The mousse is unusually dense  more like ganache  and gritty on the palate.  Fairly unpleasant.  The  tres leches  is obviously a  blondie  in sweetened condensed milk.  I hope the chef responsible doesn t have a Mexican grandmother  or they are going to have a very bad time right after they cross St Peter s gates.    If i were them  i might voluntarily head to hell instead and save myself the aggravation.
Licha's Cantina,20,GREAT HAPPY HOUR SPOT. Fair warning  the margaritas are STRONG. I was stumbling home after just one.  Licha s is way bigger than you would think if you were just looking at it from the outside. I love the ambiance  very casual  hole-in-the-wall   the service is incredibly fast  a waiter comes up to you before your butt is even in the chair   and the deals during happy hour really cannot be beat. I always have such a good time when I visit this little spot from the hours of 4-6PM.  I can t really speak about the food since all food tastes great when you are a bit tipsy  but my friend  self-proclaimed quesadilla connoisseur  said his Pastor Quesadilla was solid. We also got a bucket of small beers  Coronitas  when I came last and that was such a good idea too.  One thing about this place is there are tons of mosquitoes outside. If you go and sit in the patio  you will probably be eaten alive. They have a basket of mosquito repellents so be sure to grab a can 
Licha's Cantina,21,Was excited to try this place  but everything was SO overpriced and the flavors were just not it. Literally a side of plain white rice and black beans were  20. Very over hyped and will not be returning.
Licha's Cantina,22,If I were 23 and pregaming for a night out - this would be my top choice. Well  as the 20-something girls plotting their boy strategy said - you ve got to eat today for longevity.   My 36-yr-old metabolism is struggling with the heavy food. That being said  I have no regrets  They have so many vegetarian and gluten-free options. I tried the quesadilla with the Jamaican flowers and the sweet potatoes with goat cheese.   The vibe of this place is definitely vibing as was the service  Wish their fans were more effective on this 97F day. Cute back patio  And the best happy hour food and cocktails deals in East Austin 
Licha's Cantina,23,My friend is a local and said this place is usually better. The ambiance is super cute and the vibe is fun if you sot outside but the service and the flavors were meh. Our server ignored our questions  forgot to bring the drink we ordered and then acted frustrated when we asked about our food after waiting over an hour. The vegetarian  salad  was bland and disgusting honestly. We ordered the mushroom huarache which was also meh. I guess it filled me up but it wasn t memorable. For the price point the food just doesn t measure up. There are so many other spots nearby  I d  pass on this one.
Licha's Cantina,24,One of the top choices for East Austin Mexican eateries with great margaritas.  The first time I ended up here was when my friend and I were out on the town in East Austin and direly searching for a place to eat before indulging in some libations. We were informed by the host that although they were completely full if we wanted a table  there were a few spots at the bar if we didn t mind eating there. To be honest  I thought the ambiance of the bar was kind of nice if you don t mind being shoulder to shoulder with some fellow diners. You can also dine outside either in the  front yard  area or the back where there is another bar area as well.  I ve tried several different types of tacos here as well as the chicken mole and all were very delicious. The place has a sort of hole-in-the-wall vibe to it  so its all very casual. The drinks here are all very tasty and if you like spicy food drinks  you really can t leave without trying the spicy margaritas.  Perhaps one of the best features of this cantina is its location  located in the heart of East 6th  not dirty 6th  further to the east of the 35   you have plenty of other bars in the area if you plan to make it a night on the town afterward.
Licha's Cantina,25,Licha s Cantina is my kind of place  a hole-in-the-wall that has great vibes and delicious food. If you re looking for some solid Mexican food then this is your spot   The first thing you notice upon arrival is the awesome outdoor patio area in front. It seems like there may have been one out back too  I m not sure. But I almost sat outside. However  rolling solo  I bellied up to the bar and dug into the menu.  Everything on the menu sounds tasty but the tacos particularly caught my eye. In fact  the  build your own tacos  was right up my alley. However  this is where I have my one complaint about Licha s   build your own  is a gigantic misnomer. I saw the steak tacos and the snapper tacos and figured three each would be perfect. Well  they don t do that  despite them being priced EXACTLY the same . It s all or nothing. So much for building my own.  Nonetheless  I went with the steak and continued to enjoy by beer. When the food came out it was piping hot and tasted absolutely out of this world  Insanely delicious. So great food paired with delightful atmosphere meant I was in cantina heaven.  If you re looking for a nice spot to chill and have a satisfying bite to eat then check Licha s out. I ll put money on you enjoying yourself.
Licha's Cantina,26,The place is a little cute cottage. Very cute and rustic feel to it and the place feels authentic. The chips and salsa were great  especially the Smokey sauce  and the food was a nice healthy portion as well  Me and my friend loved our tacos   We like the build your own feel to it and the drinks were STRONG in the good way. Not charging you  9 for a cup of ice and a shot. It was a solid well crafted drink. The service was good as well and the staff was very friendly.  Even with me being cranky from walking in the 100 degree Texas weather  I was able to enjoy myself and fix my overall mood  Which is hard to do sometimes.   Overall  definitely would return and recommend.
Licha's Cantina,27,Absolutely fire. Tortillas  Fire. Tacos  Fire. Drinks  Fire. The guacamole was good but more traditional style if you aren t into that. Was pleased to find some really good non-texmex in Austin after a few misses. Highly recommend  expect to wait if you don t have a reservation but its worth it.
Licha's Cantina,28,I ve only been here twice but if you re looking for yummy Mexican fusion  this place has a very cool menu and plenty of unique and delicious options.   I like the atmosphere here a lot  the inside is especially cool with dim lighting and cool interior decorating.   The service here isn t always perfect but the people are very friendly and easy going and it s a great place to grab a drink and spend some time with friends.
Licha's Cantina,29,The wife and I were on the hunt for really good Tex-Mex like we grew up with.  Gooey  giant hot plates with lots of cheese  beans  and rice.    Not really what most places in Austin Downtown are offering.  The foodie culture has eliminated the  mexican greasy spoon  and everything has some kind of fancy crap gilding the lilly tacos with feta and rose hips.  Licha s is not exactly what we were looking for  but instead actually took us on a journey to the flavors actually found in Mexico  not filtered through the lenses of Gourmet magazine  Bon Apetite  Hemispheres  or any other foodie guide to cuisine.  We had some fantastic green carnitas enchiladas and a fantastic huarache made from marrow and fresh spices.  The last time I had these flavors was Mexico city.  Awesome drinks and fantastic staff and vibe.  Can t say enough about how cool and acommodating the bar staff and hostess were.  Thank you  coming back next time I m in Austin 
Licha's Cantina,30,My husband and I visited this restaurant on a busy Saturday night. There was an hour wait for a table but immediate seating at the bar. It was a tight fit as their bar area is small  and the counter top doubles as a space for the bartenders. We ordered a mixed drink and I got the watermelon margarita that had jalape o in it as well. It had a good flavor  refreshing and spicy  as advertised.   The chips and salsa that precede the meal were good  the green salsa is very spicy  almost too spicy  but the flavor is so good  it was hard to stop eating it  hence the need for margarita number two. The red salsa is slightly less spicy  with a smooth smoke flavor. Very unique as I ve never tasted a salsa like either of the two.   For our meal  I ordered the tacos Al Pastor. Very good flavor  sweet and smoky. My husband ordered the Alambre Taco. I didn t care for it  but he liked it very much. He said the steak had a lot of flavor  perfect cuts of meat. The only reason I m giving 4 stars is that I wasn t blown away by the atmosphere  the food was good  but not so outstanding that I would recommend this restaurant as a must-go for travelers. Our waitress was very nice and helpful with the menu. As a side note  almost everything on the menu is naturally gluten free.
Licha's Cantina,31,Love this restaurant. Good selection of appetizers for happy hour. Excellent mole. Not too sweet. Citrus marinated pork is very tender. For HH drink just get the mula. When I m not home in Kyle with the roadside food trucks I come here.
Licha's Cantina,32,Great place on East 6th  Food was tasty  Paloma was  delicious  and the ambiance was great    I will definitely be back
Licha's Cantina,33,My friend wanted enchiladas but they didn t have any on the menu. Our waitress was able to accommodate us and we agreed it was the best enchiladas we ve ever had. Delicious food and chips and salsa. Definitely worth the wait.
Licha's Cantina,34,Licha s is great  would definitely recommend  Authentic ambiance  music  vibes. Birria tacos - AMAZING  The other food options were really good too.
Licha's Cantina,35,We have found our favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin. It is such a refreshing departure from the ubiquitous TexMex. While there are plenty of wonderful food truck options too  this is a nice spot if you want a still casual  sit down experience the food was all delicious including sopas  gorditas  and slow roasted pork. They have beer by the bottle and a fantastic house margarita with spicy rim. It s in a cute little house with a great front patio. The house can get pretty hot  in August  even with fans. Good news - there are plenty of fans outside too. Great location on happening east 6th.
Licha's Cantina,36,Licha s is the kind of place that I really expected to love. It was a shame that the food and service missed the mark because I do love the ambiance and decor. I am a sucker for patio dining when the weather is just right and I feel the patio at Licha s is perfect for that. We started with the queso fundido chorizo. I like to think of myself as a  queso fundido connoisseur  and theirs was way too greasy. I was worried if this being the case when ordering and asked the waiter if I could order it without chorizo and he suggested I order the mushroom one instead. I am allergic to mushrooms so had to stick with the chorizo one and it sure was a miss. We also ordered the quesadilla tocinada pastor  the bone marrow huarache and the lengua sopecitos. My favorite item was the sopecitos. The lengua was tender and the guajillo salsa paired perfectly with the beef. The huarache was very different to anything I ve ever tasted before especially because of the Parmesan cheese but it was pretty good. The overall theme was greasy food. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes  but they all just felt heavy. I ordered a Margarita on the rocks and it was bland so I ended up ordering a bucket of Coronitas instead. With so many cute patios to choose from in Austin  I doubt I ll be giving Licha s another chance.
Licha's Cantina,37,Lichas is great  they have such a nice ambiance and the food is really good. I usually get the fish tacos which comes on a cast iron parilla - steaming hot. I should venture out and try something else but I am a creature of habit  Honestly not the best guac I ve had but everything else is always great  drinks included 
Licha's Cantina,38,My first experience was great  The service was friendly  the food delicious and the margaritas were on point  I appreciate our waiter for being such a good sport about my questions about gluten free items. Although the menu was a little confusing about GF  the waiter went back to the kitchen to ask for clarity on a few items and came back and said they would be willing to make everything in the menu GF. The blue corn tortilla flor de calabaza quesadilla was everything I had hoped for  The food is a bit pricey for street food but I m sure so is the rent. The flip side is the well balanced margaritas were affordable at  11. I look forward to next time 
Licha's Cantina,39,This definitely is a restaurant that can give you many different experiences  but not consistent.   The one thing I love about this place is that they have so many authentic Mexican dishes  Huitlacoche  Flour de Jamaica and Esquites made me happy to see on the menu.   The chips were on the better end of Austin s app chip scene and their two salsas were fantastic. One green and one Smokey.   The Arroz con Huitlacoche Appetizer was good and a great dish to try what Huitlacoche tastes like for picky eaters.   The entries were not as impressing as the majority of the dishes on the table said it was a tad bland or needed more spice. That being said  if you get a flavorful dish you should be in the clear.   I liked Licha s a lot  the aesthetic vibes and ambiance were all right. I just was ready for more.
Licha's Cantina,40,I went here on Saturday and I ordered the Tinga de Pollo Orange and Chipotle Braised Chicken Quesadilla. It looked super appealing but I felt that the chicken lacked seasoning and flavor. Also  for the portion I received I thought that it didn t match the price. It s not that bad. I think the ambience is great but I don t think I would return.
Licha's Cantina,41,The food and margs here are delicioso  but their happy hour menu prices have increased from  6 to  8 per item. It is a very small amount of food and doesn t feel like a great deal anymore tbh. The lady at the front is also not very friendly or helpful. Once she told me the wait time but then didn t take my name down so when I showed up to check in she said I wasn t on the list and that it d be another hour to wait. She acts put out and has not been accommodating on several occasions. This has happened too many times for me to return.
Licha's Cantina,42,I love nothing more than a happy hour where all the items are a flat rate. At Licha s Cantina they have a  5-6 happy hour  Tues-Fri  from 4-6pm with a good variety to choose from. This isn t your standard Mexican dishes that you find widely available  they have some interesting options  In picture order I got   - Tocinada Quesadilla  this is a blue corn tortilla filled with Al Pastor  spit-grilled pork   bacon  and chorizo with an avocado cream and salsa. This is one of the more familiar dishes you ve had. A classic  my favorite of the items I got  Pretty filling.   6   - Cochinita Pibil Sopecitos  these are essentially corn maze cups  layered with black beans  and topped with Cochinita Pibil  slow-roasted pork  as well as red onion  queso fresco  cilantro  and avocado cream salsa. These were pretty good too  quite dense. Full of flavor. This was my second fav    6   - Tuetano Huarache  think of this like a corn flatbread. This was more unique because it had an interesting mix of bone marrow  black beans  avocado salsa  herb salad  and parmesan cheese. This is a more rich  cheesy dish that I enjoyed.   6   - Camote  this is sweet potato  goat cheese  with raw cane sugar chipotle. I ll be honest  I didn t care for this one. If you love sweet potato though  then this may be for you.   5   - Esquite  this means  corn in a cup  in Spanish. Great side dish to have that ll compliment your dish. This is a classic  you can t go wrong    5   All in all  I had a great time here. There s a vast menu selection  there s patio seating  the service was quick  and the food was good. With that said  I give them a 4 5 for being  great  
Licha's Cantina,43,Food is pretty good and the cocktails are great. Cute bungalow house style with really friendly wait staff.
Licha's Cantina,44,Hungry  Come here. Want Mexican  Come here. Want something really good  Come here. Craving something different from your typical south of the border fare  Come here. I may have embarrassed myself ordering and gotten my feelings hurt when the person who had to listen to me repeated it back flawlessly but it was worth it. The ceviche is the best I ve ever had. The esquite was like elote not on the cob which makes it just as tasty but way less of a hassle to eat. I d never even heard of Huaraches before coming here but the mole con Pollo was bomb. Only hiccup was my mom ordered pibil de pescado y camaron without bacon and when we got home to eat our carry out order we discovered they had added it anyway. 10 10 would recommend coming here though the parking nearby completely sucks so bring your patience and parallel parking skills.
Licha's Cantina,45,Super fun place to eat in East Austin. Eclectic Mexican local with 100 Austin mood and vibes. Accommodates different food preferences including a menu for gluten free or vegetarian. Recommend the vegetarian tacos. This is a great place to go if you want to give guests an authentic Austin experience  or if you want a great East side place to have a fun dinner.
Licha's Cantina,46,This was a very cute spot  Everything was definitely super authentic  but I liked it   It was a lot of food  but very good. Kids ordered a cheese quesadilla  but didn t really care for it. They loved my shrimp and snapper taco plate though  Hot sauce was nice and spicy 
Licha's Cantina,47,Excellent little place. Everybody working there very friendly and very efficient. I m a California boy  and didn t know what most of the things on the menu were. I picked something that sounded good  and it was delicious. It was a quesadilla gringa. I had a couple of lime Margaritas which were also excellent. Great little place.
Licha's Cantina,48,My experience at this restaurant was amazing  The servers were excellent. They were speedy and personable. The drinks were very yummy too. The Lupita was sweet yet had some spice with jalape os. The ceviche was unreal. I haven t had ceviche in a couple years and it was back in florida. It was a nice surprise to see Lichas had ceviche  It was a sweeter ceviche due to the mangos and I loved it that way. I definitely would recommend and plan on going back 
Licha's Cantina,49,Yes  Now I know why this place is always packed when I pass by. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to stop in right when they opened one Saturday afternoon and we were blown away  The house margaritas tasted fresh and delicious  the food was amazing. The tacos come fajita-style on a skillet with all the fixins and you build it yourself. I have recommended this place multiple times to other people. Fun atmosphere but not crazy  and a great happy hour as well.
Licha's Cantina,50,Are young  Are you white  This is the place for you. They won t sit you if you are an older brown person. They told me there was a three hour wait but then my white friend went to ask for a table and they sat her right away. Does that tell you something about the business   
Licha's Cantina,51,Licha s has the first drink that I can say that I genuinely liked. I got the coco seasonal marg which was perfectly sweet  I got lengua tacos which was super juicy and tasty as well. Their salsa had a kick. The staff was so nice and helpful too
Licha's Cantina,52,Licha s is always a good idea  from the ambiance to the service and food -- you can t go wrong. I always get their Sudadero and red fish tacos  yumm  I have never had a bad experience with service but I would definitely try to call ahead for a reservation since there s always a wait
Licha's Cantina,53,This is my favorite Mexican place in Austin. Cool saloon looking environment inside and a decent amount of outdoor seating. The Al pastor tacos and Queso fundido are delicious. Most of the menu is gluten free too.
Licha's Cantina,54,We got a marg and a Paloma and both were STRONG. We started with the elite corn and it was pretty good. Then we did the Al pastor and brisket tacos and they were pretty decent. We like the complimentary hot sauces that they provide too.
Licha's Cantina,55,Food was great but after an hour and a half  the server put our check on the table and proceeded to stand by our table with a bus boy pointing at us making it very clear they wanted us to pay and leave. It was extremely uncomfortable. They try to turn tables there and don t care much about customer experience. Probably won t go back.
Licha's Cantina,56,Expect a wait. Inside of an old house that has been renovated. Good service and a fun vibe. The drinks aren t amazing but not bad by any stretch. The chips and tortillas are fresh and served warm. Would HIGHLY recommend a dish that has a pork brisket taco that dips into an au jus. Can t for the life of me find it on the menu....maybe someone who is an expert can help me out  The guacamole is good and it doesn t have a bunch of tomatoes in it. The queso is made with real cheese. The homemade salsas are unlike any I have had before - the red is a chipotle and the verde has a great spice.
Licha's Cantina,57,Couldn t snag a reservation  however was able to drop by with a party of four and be seated after a short wait. Had the Ceviche  street corn   and Scallops appetizers followed by Biria and el pastor tacos. Also had Paloma cocktails. All the above exceeded expectations and resulted in four very full and happy customers
Licha's Cantina,58,An old but cute little place. However  it was hot and humid inside. The drinks weren t great and the food was just okay. I can t put quite into words about the food and the taste of it  but it is definitely not Tex-Mex  it just had a funny flavor to it. Unfortunately  I would not recommend this place.
Licha's Cantina,59,Every time we come into town  we always hit Licha s for lunch or dinner. The food is amazing and the cocktails are excellent. It is always packed with locals and visitors  so we typically make reservations. If you are in town  you must check out this East 6th gem.
Licha's Cantina,60,I am very disappointed with this place  I really chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday and I am sorry I went  I expected more from this place  I don t know if I should call it a restaurant  at first the waiter took too long to come to my table  and when he went to order us the drinks we decided to order drinks and food at the same time as it had taken a long time to come to serve us when finally it was the food came before the drinks so we got the food first then the drinks the waiter never came to ask if we needed anything else yes we wanted to order other margaritas he never offered us a dessert since he was celebrating my birthday at least he would have asked us if we wanted a dessert he never did but if I add a 20  tip which he honestly didn t deserve it I know that his work is paid with tips but he did not deserve it  we never had a gesture from him if we needed something else  my bill was  300 for a meal that was not worth it    We would have gone to another place with more reputation and with a delicious meal we would have paid maybe  300 or more  but it would have been worth it     That s the most wasted  300 worth of food I ve ever had   I would not give it even one star but to be able to comment I have to put the most false star
Licha's Cantina,61,Happy hour is awesome. Margs for days.   Service is solid and the atmosphere is super lively and fun. After work is always a great spot to hang out. Good is on point and fresh and tasty. Great spot to see OG Austin and get all the feels for the city.
Licha's Cantina,62,Lovely place. Outstanding food. Friendly staff. Visiting from out of town and came across this gem. Stop in if you re in town  you ll be glad you did 
Licha's Cantina,63,Not traditional Mexican food  hipster trendy kinda vibe if you re into that-waitress was rude. Food was 3 10. Mule was 9 10. Wouldn t return or recommend
Licha's Cantina,64,Went here with a few friends for dinner.  Never been here but she said it was prettyyyy.....prettyyyy.....prettyyyy  good.  It was very busy - a Saturday night  and this place is nice and quaint.  A house converted into a restaurant with outside seating and a lot of room in the back.  In the end I d say the overall experience was just ok.  Premium prices while nothing here really blew me away  and a few dishes that were just ok - nothing stellar.   We got a pitcher of the Sangria  it was about  60  wow .  Got about 5-6 glasses out of it  and it was  okay .  Did not blow me out of the water.  We got the guacamole  asked for jalapenos  but the guac never came so we asked 2 more times.  When it did come there were no jalapenos  and it just tasted  ok .  Nothing bad  nothing great  and it came in a small mortar-like bowl.  I felt it could have used a little more seasoning and some lime juice.    We got the Choriqueso - their version of queso mixed with chorizo.  It was  12.  It came in a small flat iron square serving plan.  There wasn t much on there  and there wasn t enough of it to wow me either.  Most of it stuck to the pan and was difficult to get out and the taste was just okay.  It is not like your typical cheesy queso  and overall I felt this dish should have been half the price - so I won t get this again.  I don t mind overpaying for stuff  but it s gotta be great  and this wasn t great.  Sorry.   Chips and Salsa - now that wowed us.  The green and red salsas they have are really good.  They served the chips in a bag  we got 2nds and more salsa - I loved the green salsa.    They raved about the Tuetano  a flatbread dish with Bone marrow  black beans  salsa fresca  herb salad  queso parmesano.  Um - no.  This was a let-down.  It had too much black bean on it  you could not taste the bone marrow at all  it basically was flat bread with lots of black bean.  Very disappointing.  I mentioned this to the waiter  we did not finish it  he took it away  but he left it on the bill.  I did ask him later to please take it off since it wasn t good - and he did.  Thank you for that.    We got the Huachinango Tikin Xic - the season rubbed red snapper for  27  it s listed for  20 on the Yelp menu but prices have gone up .  To me  the price point for this dish should be  20.  The fish was good.  The cactus swiss chard salad was ok but on the bland-side  the chorizo potatoes were dry and underwhelming.  Most of us just finished the fish.    The desserts we got - the Flan Pie   cheesecake and the Tres Leches w  Panna Cotta.  Now - that panna cotta tres leches was very good  it came in a small jar  had some strawberries in it  I would get this again.  The Flan was meh.  Did not blow me away.    So in summary  for the amount of    we spent here   260 for 4 ppl including tip  I walked out feeling underwhelmed - specifically with some of the hyped up dishes  the taste   execution and portion sizing.  The only things that really wowed me were the salsas and the panna cotta dessert - for which I would expect more with a bill like that.  In the end that doesn t motivate me to come back and try other dishes on the menu for fear of the same results.  To be fair the fish was good  but the sides were bland just okay.  The service was okay  but for what they have to deal with for COVID they deserve some slack on that - so it s all good.  They all wore masks and were professional the entire time  and they did take off the dish I was displeased with  per my request  which made me happy er .  I would go back and bring a friend to have drink  hang out with that panna cotta dessert and some chips n salsa please.
Licha's Cantina,65,Licha s never disappoints  It s one of our favorite places to eat in Austin. It s not fancy  but the food and drinks are consistently great. The margaritas are cheap and generous with the tequila. The esquite is a dream  and the salsas are always fresh and delicious   Most recently  we went last Saturday night and had a Blast. We got the brisket tacos and cochinita pibil entrees  and everything was perfectly seasoned and fresh. The tortillas are homemade as well   Also  their space is super cool--it s an old house that s basically been repurposed as a restaurant  with tables in the front and backyards as well as the inside itself. Whether you re just visiting Austin or live here  you really need to try this place 
Licha's Cantina,66,Recently visited for a quick dinner  I really appreciate how well spaced out the restaurant is and many tables available outside for dining. There were two salsas served with the chips  one of which was spicy and had a real kick to it  Ordered a margarita  which was average and tried the quesadillas for dinner. Both were decent  but also pretty average. Overall the food quality is good  but nothing was really that memorable. In a place like Austin  I feel like there are some better TexMex options that will leave you more satisfied.
Licha's Cantina,67,If I m in Austin I am eating at Lichas. Their food is authentic with not a whole lot of Austin flair. The service is so well done and the presentation is always top notch. The ceviche is great and the tlacoyos are well executed. By far my favorite meal has been the birria but I like to be adventurous when I go. We ve sat at the bar  my bets advice is to go during non peak hours unless you have a reservation.
Licha's Cantina,68,I rarely write reviews  but this is one of the worst service I ve had at any restaurant. The hostess  fairly tall  amp  long hair  made us wait hours for us to not even have her put us in the queue. I saw tons of people getting seated before us when we came before them. The hostess barely acknowledged us and kept chatting laughing with another employee  also fairly tall  amp  long hair  in front of us. I made eye contact with both but they continued their conversation and disregarded me. When we did get seated  it took so long to get our check and utensils  at that time it wasn t busy anymore . Our waiter only check-in with us once and had to find someone to get what we needed.   The restaurant looks so cool but it s a shame the service was not there. Please go elsewhere.
Licha's Cantina,69,Licha s is the most perfect spot for classic Austin margs in a relaxed  eclectic East Austin atmosphere. We visited on a warm July afternoon  and I was immediately excited to spend the afternoon on their beautiful patio. I m a former Austin resident  and Licha s- housed in a somewhat ramshackle little building surrounded by a lush patio- has that perfectly Central Texas vibe that is had to recreate elsewhere. After being seated  we settled in for margs  Coronas  and Modelos that just kept coming as we whiled away the afternoon  chatting and laughing. Their chips  queso  and salsas were also exceptional  and even better  our friendly waiter was happy to keep us around even though we didn t order a meal. If you are looking for a perfectly Austin spot in the sun for relaxed drinks and fun vibes  Licha s is your place.
Licha's Cantina,70,LOVE  The food was so authentic and so good   The red snapper was our fav  I enjoyed the fish and shrimp tacos too  Had a hard time and some miscommunications with the hostess as a walk in  probably best to make a reservation during covid. Still 5 stars because it was a great vibe and great food.
Licha's Cantina,71,Atmosphere was awesome   Restaurant is in an old house and has great vibes  Super packed on a Friday night  but we had drinks at the patio bar out back while we waited. Chicken mole Huarache was fabulous  didn t get a picture bc we dove right in . Also had the birria tacos and enchiladas. DID NOT DISAPPOINT   Will def be back next trip to Austin.
Licha's Cantina,72,Went there with my elderly friend and my 10 year old daughter. Every time we asked for something the waitress didn t seem too happy. I understand that they don t have a kids menu... they don t need to have one but when I asked if they had something that was more kid friendly they said they had  kids  quesadillas or tacos... I ordered some kids tacos and they brought me this big plate with 4 giant tacos ... I told them that was too much  that my daughter was probably going to eat one or two and they said that that s how  they order came ... so I had to take it as it is or not... so I took it and paid for those expensive tacos...also I ordered some extra tortillas and they charged me 5 dollars for 3 tortillas  ... This place is not family friendly at all  they seemed bothered by us ... I guess they just like  young  people...  Good food but terrible service... very disappointing... never going back...
Licha's Cantina,73,Food and ambience were pretty good. Unfortunately  I can t give 5 starts due no AC. It made the dining experience very unpleasant  although I was sitting inside it was 102  out and it could definitely be felt inside.
Licha's Cantina,74,Cinco de Mayo happy hour   Licha s was absolutely the best   The fun  festive atmosphere  great food  amp  drinks hit the high notes  
Licha's Cantina,75,I always try to give the benefit of the doubt when coming to restaurants  especially during a busy week like SXSW  but I think our waiter was wasted or high because our service experience was terrible. It took over an hour for drinks and close to an hour and a half for guacamole and queso. Our waiter then looked at us funny when we asked for chips with our appetizer dips. He then asked us what we wanted to order for our main course over an hour after we had already placed our orders with him. Food was delicious and my friends said they really liked their margaritas. There was a cat in the kitchen area  Weird experience for sure and from what the people who sat with us at the  community table  said was that the service here is usually very good so I m thinking this was a one time thing.
Licha's Cantina,76,We were visiting Austin and wanted to try something local.  This little gem popped up on Yelp and we figured we give it a shot.  They are following COVID protocols so we called ahead and made a reservation due to the limited number of tables.    This place is an old house that s been converted to a restaurant.  We were welcomed right away and shown to our table.  They brought out chips and salsa.  There were two salsas and the green one is amazing   They both were   We ordered guacamole to start off with and this was the only disappointment.  It was so bland   It needed some cumin  lime and cilantro.  We were dipping our chips in the salsa first then adding the Gauc on top.    We ordered tacos.  I got the Alambre and my dining companion got the duck tacos.  They were fabulous      The meat is Served on skillets with the tortillas on the side.  Big portions   We could only eat half of it.  The tacos were very flavorful   We ll come here again the next time we re in Austin 
Licha's Cantina,77,Oh this is our favorite spot lately due to the drinks and the Mexican soul food.  Not your Tex Mex nor street food  but authentic dishes from Mexico s interior regions.  Therefore I would suggest the specialties dishes and not what you recognized.  The first few times I came here  I would order what I believe I am ordering but it always come out pleasantly different from what I expected but still very good in taste.  So with lesson learned  I ask the bartender or the waiters for recommendations.    My latest dish was the enchiladas and the salmon dish.  It was so moist  flavorful and delicious.  Yes that is a lot of adjectives but you have to try it.  When it was first set down  I thought they overcooked it but nope  it was very moist and so so good.  Portions and price are decent so you don t have to worry about Texas size portion or California NY prices yet.
Licha's Cantina,78,We went last night and LOVED the ambiance  The food was delicious and the servings were plentiful. Our server was kind and attentive. I will definitely be going back.
Licha's Cantina,79,My family and I always enjoy eating at Licha s. The food is yum and Ritas hit the spot 
Licha's Cantina,80,Fantastic service to match the outstanding flavors of the menu.  Bars not bad either.
Licha's Cantina,81,Licha s salsa tiene mi corazon  Where to even start  My 2 ATX local friends said Licha s was the spot for some delicious Mexican food. I am VERY picky with my Mexican food  so of course I was skeptical. Licha s is small  but has such a comforting vibe to it. We sat at the bar and were attended to quickly. I got their house margarita on the rocks and it was one of the best I had ever had. They serve up some chips and salsa as you sit and wait to order. The green salsa is ADDICTING  I had to ask for at least 2 more cups since I loved it. Just the right amount of spice is added to it. The food was amazing and everything had so much flavor to it. Licha s exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be back whenever I am in the ATX area 
Licha's Cantina,82,Hands down my favorite spot in town. It s the ONE place I always recommend friends visit during their stay to Austin. The atmosphere is great  with different indoor and outdoor sections and cozy decor and lighting. The food and drinks are unique and flavorful. Overall it s a great experience 
Licha's Cantina,83,I ve been coming here for over three years and tonight was disappointing. My friends from out-of-town were in and I made a reservation well in advance of this date. When we got to the restaurant  on time  we were told they were running behind and that we would have to wait 30 minutes. 45 minutes later they sat us down for dinner. We had a party of 5 and as we were just about to be seated at a six-top table  the hostess asked us if we  the five of us  could sit at a four-top table and squeeze the fifth person in at the table  which I politely declined. Despite all of that  they didn t offer to comp any part of our meal. If you are going to offer reservations-make sure that s an accommodation you can actually fulfill. And if you then cannot uphold that promise-perhaps you should at least offer to comp part of the meal  I won t be back.
Licha's Cantina,84,So the word on the street is their Chilaquiles are bomb  and yes they are  but the real secret for me  Happy Hour  Wowee wow wow wow   Awesome bartending staff and servers. Always authentic food is made here. The drinks are on point and the salsas are divine. It gets busy - like real busy - so plan ahead if you have a big group.  A lot of people have so many outrageously high expectations these days and I am sure my review starts to raise your interest as well however - try it for yourself and expect nothing but a great time. Seriously  it is as great of a time as you make it   Licha s is not far from me and although I wish brunch opened earlier I have zero qualms with this establishment. They really know what they are doing and they are certainly doing it right.  The crowds here should be evidence of that  Enjoy 
Licha's Cantina,85,I love this restaurant. We come here when we want to celebrate  just because. We love literally everything we ve eaten here. Best ceviche in town  both summer and fall versions  and their sizzling skillets are a fun take on tacos. Margaritas are strong and delicious. Great happy hour deals  like really good ones. Better to have reservations but the bar is first come first serve and it s a fun spot.
Licha's Cantina,86,Food was good but felt like they were rushing us out the whole time. Being asked multiple times if we needed to go boxes when we were still eating clearly sent a message that we werent welcomed. We were told that there were no outdoor tables yet those same tables were empty from the time we went in until the time we left. Food took a pretty long time to arrive and yet they were giving us the stank eye for us to leave. I get you have to fulfill reservation requests but you should not be making your other paying customers feel uncomfortable. If you want a chill time while enjoying your food with some friends  then maybe this may not be the place. Such a shame as the interior gives out a pretty chill and inviting vibe. Clearly they rather pump in and out as many customers as they can at the expense of their overall experience and   17 taco plate.
Licha's Cantina,87,Selected this restaurant based on reviews and outside dining. We had friends in town who wanted Mexican food downtown. This is not like any Mexican food I ve eaten. I have tried many kinds from many parts of Mexico and California and I m usually pretty open minded. It just didn t taste really good. The mole was gritty with little flavor and minimal spice. Tortillas were limp  quesadilla on the greasy side. Beans and rice very bland although I liked the bits of blanched fresh corn tossed in the rice. Others ordered Chicken Tinga Tacos which weren t super either. Our server was attentive and the food came out fast. Maybe a bad night in the kitchen 
Licha's Cantina,88,Our favorite restaurant in town  hands down. First tried the happy hour a few years back and have made the trek from the West side- during rush hour- countless times since. The lengua sopes are ridiculously good  with super flavorful  almost creamy lengua and crunchy escabeche. We used to share this as an app  comes with two  but realized we d always try to make moves for a little bit of each other s  so naturally we now each get one  Is two orders a person too much  Justifiable if hungry or missed lunch  . The table salsas are also the best I ve ever had. Ever. Addictive  with spice but not over the top  drinkable.   We ve tasted just about the entire menu and everything is amazing. Takeout since COVID has also been great  although we miss getting to dine in and listen to good music. Love you guys xo
Licha's Cantina,89,Small drinks  slow and erratic service  very small kitchen.  Forgot one of our dinners.  No air condition for indoor eating and drinking  no fans for outdoor dinning.  Very uncomfortable. Although the chicken mole was fantastic.   Licha was not enjoyed by my party of 7.
Licha's Cantina,90,Turns out I got food poisoning after eating there yesterday.  Service also felt rushed
Licha's Cantina,91,Ambiance is great  music reminds me of being at home and food is good. Wait staff did not miss a beat  literally team work at it finest. Definitely recommend the enchiladas potosina  Drinks are great n bartender Luis was amazing too. First time visiting Austin  but def recommend this place 
Licha's Cantina,92,The food was not great. My cocktail tasted like antiseptic. Staff was very rude. Would not go back.
Licha's Cantina,93,Meh.  Was really looking forward to it  but it is TX  not NM  so what do I figure.  It is more Tex Mex than Mexican  so if that is what you want  you may do ok here.  It was just weird.. not in a  keep Austin weird  type of vibe  but a we put a weird spin on the taste of everything  and it won t necessarily be good  or cheap.  First off  we went to the bar at the back  which was basically a table with a guy making drinks  and ordered a couple drinks and some chips and salsa.  My doom maker.... I basically have an unwritten rule that says that if the chips and salsa are terrible  the food will fallow.  The chips were weird  and the salsa came in a ramekin  about 8 chips worth.  I had the Cochinita Pibil  which is kind of a mexican style brasied pork.  I kind of finished it.  It wasn t very good.  what to do...  Anyway  it was pretty busy and seemingly popular  but very hipsterish  so I gotta grow my bead and get my hat on next time...  I think I will stick to BBQ in Austin.
Licha's Cantina,94,I was here on business  therefore  I parked my rental car across the street from the restaurant. The street parking meter cost me  4. This was my first time here. I was here with five of my business associates for dinner. One of them recommended this place and I am glad she did. It was great. We did not have a dinner reservation  therefore  I enjoyed my spicy margarita at the bar as we waited for our table to become available.  We were seated within 10 minutes after our arrival. The restaurant is quite large with a huge eating area in the rear  which is sealed off from the elements. Our young yet knowledgeable server was excellent. She recommended their red snapper  which was one of my best red snapper dinners in a long time.    At the end the girls wanted to try some dessert so they ordered their three most popular desserts including a chocolate cake  flan and another item. I did not share in the three desserts.  At the end we divided and shared our cost including gratuities  which turned out to be  44 each. I will definitely return here for dinner  margaritas and more red snapper.
Licha's Cantina,95,This place was a kick and the food was stellar. You walk up some wood steps to the front porch entry of an old house. We loved the low lights with all the votive candles and the fun upbeat music. WE were seated out back in a tented kind of patio with patio heaters. We ordered pitchers of margaritas and the pitchers came out with salt rimmed  lime wedge glasses. They were fresh and tasty  not to sweet. Everyone LOVED their food. We had a large group and their were bites of queso  mole  etc. being shared and raved about. My friend had the corn smut dish  I forget the name  the server described it well  it was mushroomy and awesome. I would definitely recognize this place to friends.   Order the Choriqueso. It is a gooey cheesey mess in a cast iron skillet topped with pico and guac served with little corn tortillas. Fabulous 
Licha's Cantina,96,Amazing queso and really authentic Mexican vibe. Wait staff were friendly and attentive.
Licha's Cantina,97,I came specifically to try the watermelon jalape o margarita that I read about in a  top 10 margaritas of Austin  listicle like the tourist I am. I was pleasantly surprised that this margarita was hyped up just the right amount   It was mostly sweet and watermelony with an amount of jalape o spice equivalent to a barbecue chip. One PSA I would like to distribute is the fact that the drink contains jalape o slices and MANY seeds  so drinking a seed will make it much more spicy  I wanted to ask for a straw to get through the seed situation more gracefully but our server was super busy and didn t come back to check on us too often. Overall I really liked my drink  just wanted a straw or at least fewer seeds personally   The other part of this place I really appreciated was the free chips  They are served with a spicy sauce and a barbecue-like sauce instead of salsa  but they were a good accompaniment for the margarita  The overall vibe of this place is cool and authentic as it s an old house turned into a restaurant  with the backyard also open for seating under a walled tent structure. There was one unfortunate grackle that swooped though the tent  but that s eating outside in Austin  I guess 
Licha's Cantina,98,Fun atmosphere  food is mid every single time I ve been. I got the sopecitos and the masa was hard and crumbly. It tasted like a GF pizza dough  I would know I m gluten free 
Licha's Cantina,99,Had a horrible experience. The host was busy but she did her best. We were told the wait would be 1hr. We waited for 1hr 45min. Upon waiting we had some drinks but the wait was getting to me. We asked on three separate occasions to see if a table would be ready. Upon the third request we were taken to our table. We waited for 15 min to see our waiter. We knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered hoping to have the food quickly we were wrong 35min later our food was out I asked for a drink and that drink did not come out. When it finally arrived 15 min had gone by. The food was nothing like I hoped to expect. I expected more from the hype my wife had from her previous experience. I will never be back again. Never did our waiter come bk to check up on us but he was chatty at the bar. I guess since covid  expectations have fallen below the threshold. Any ways that s an honest in bias experience. Hope  that who ever goes there would have a better experience
Licha's Cantina,100,Great for happy hour  The HH food still has large portions and is filling enough - I recommend the quesadillas    Good vibes and good food 
Licha's Cantina,101,La Licha a very hipster cool place  the ambiance can be chill or romantic. The food was unusual  it was very good  but not what I expected as I was looking up Mexican food. It is Mexican food  but I would say it s possibly southern Mexican  more Spanish or even native Mexican Indian vs Mexican.    The servers were not very knowledgeable  I ordered the chimichurri steak and asked the waitress if it was a skirt steak and she said yes  when it came it was a New York strip. They re not experts at preparing steak either  just putting that out there.  But the queso is the best I ve ever had in my life  it is different than Tex-Mex queso  it is authentic melted real cheese and its amazing.  Down a star for the steak and the misinformation  but otherwise an excellent place to eat.
Licha's Cantina,102,The food and atmosphere are great  Whether you re out on the town with dome friends  or looking for a date night locale  Licha s delicious traditional Mexican food will have you covered.
Licha's Cantina,103,This is one of the greatest restaurants I have stumbled upon in Austin. Hidden in an East Austin neighborhood  Licha s is putting out freshly cooked central Mexican food. All types of masa vessels grace the menu and their happy hour is stellar for both food and drinks. Not to mention their outdoor seating is great.  Share huaraches with the table and choose your toppings. I suggest the mushrooms and cheese. The cochinita pibil sopes have been my favorite thing to try and will fill you up on no time. The chicken tinga has good  tangy flavor and their are great options for ceviche  unique entrees like chiles en nogada  and familiar items like quesadillas.  The service was great. Fast and friendly  but not there all of the time. Big fan.
Licha's Cantina,104,Best interior Mexican food in Austin   Amazing happy hour  Amazing food  Amazing staff  Amazing Drinks  What more can I say. If you haven t tried it you are missing out.
Licha's Cantina,105,interesting to me there are soooo many mixed reviews. people seem to be nit picking here and there about stupid stuff...i m going to give it to you straight. go here and eat here. the food is excellent.  i prefer going for happy hour or on a less busy day  weekday  as the food comes out quicker. this is some of the best food in Austin in my opinion and i have eaten all over the world in some of the best restaurants. there is a very authentic vibe to not only some of the food but the atmosphere of the restaurant and bar itself.   the owner is extremely friendly  my gf and i came one night 10 mins before closing which we would never do  they just had the wrong hours up on google. we said nono we will leave we wont do that to you guys and the owner insisted we sit and got us a round of drinks on the house as well. it was awesome.  definitely try the Tuetano  bone marrow  Huarache  Huitlacoche Quesadilla  and Lengua Encebollada Tacos...     my ONLY negative thing i have to say is that the pitcher prices are absolutely ridiculous   45  serves mmaaaayyyybeee 6 drinks if you have alot of ice  HAHA
Licha's Cantina,106,This was some of the best Mexican I have had. The ceviche was incredible. I went with a large group for a bachelorette and they were able to accommodate us a couple weeks ahead. We got great service  the vibes were immaculate and I will totally be back next time I m in Austin 
Licha's Cantina,107,This is one of my favorite places with authentic Mexican food EXCEPT for the tres leches cake. Very disappointed it was just a little ramekin with Cake soak in milk for  9 dollars. No whipped cream or garnish or fruit.
Licha's Cantina,108,After checking out their happy hour menu  my friend and I was very interested in checking this place out. Unfortunately we missed the happy hour window which was between 4-6pm. It was pretty packed and we opted to wait for a table inside since it was uncomfortably hot outside.   The host was pretty slow and unmindful. He practically sat down a couple of girls right as they got in while my friend and I have been waiting for about 20 mins. We got his attention right away and he then seated us right after them.   My friend and I ordered one of their seasonal cocktails  which was pretty unique taste wise.  I opted for the duck mole plate which was delicious with a nice combination of citrus and mole. My friend ordered blackened fish entree which I took a bite of and it as well was delicious.   The prices are above average here. I spent about 40 bucks for my duck mole plate and drink combined. I will definitely come back to try their happy hour menu.
Licha's Cantina,109,Very cool environment but drinks were not strong. They were pre-made  in bottles to serve. They did not have alcohol in the mixtures. I was on my 3rd drink of the night and was told   your drink isn t strong because you are drunk  you can t taste it.  I was not drunk. I was on my third drink since 6pm and it was almost 11pm. Great music  but drinks are horrible  This is a critical time where business should be grateful for customers. Don t treat customers bad.
Licha's Cantina,110,This continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in Austin.  I love that it s in an old wooden house and I can t stay away from the menu.  Few places serve huitlacoche  corn fungus  so I m always eager to have it here.  The mahi mahi a la plancha was just right.  My downfall here is that the portions are rather large so my stomach tells me I ve had enough -- it s time to leave -- when I really want to try something else on the menu.  Oh  well  next time.
Licha's Cantina,111,Great cocktails - lots of mezcal options. Amazing service. Best fucking lengua I ve had in my entire life.
Licha's Cantina,112,So  if you like wine or can only drink wine like I can- don t go there.... when I asked for a new bottle to be opened or a different wine that hadn t been opened yet  they told me they don t open new bottles until the entire bottle has been finished. I asked  even if they are bad     Because mine was very bad  They said yes... and that they would comp me for the drink I couldn t drink but they wouldn t open a new one. It was a dinner and we wanted drinks. This all happened after we ordered food so we were stuck there and I couldn t enjoy a drink with it. I think that s very bad service. I really don t want to go there again.
Licha's Cantina,113,Happy hour here is the bomb dot com. It runs Mon-Fri 5-6. They have an expansive menu of food  amp  drinks for only  5 each  came here at 5 15 on a Wednesday. I found street parking nearby  which wasn t difficult. The place was already busy but there were quite a few tables available  inside and on the patio . I just sat at the bar. They immediately brought me free chips  amp  salsa. The green and red salsas were both delicious  pretty spicy though .  I ordered the tuetano huarache  bone marrow  black beans   amp  avocado salsa on white cornmeal flatbread. It s normally  12  so  5 during HH was a STEAL. It tasted crazy good. The bone marrow was so decadent  spread like butter. The corn flatbread had a rich earthy flavor and a nice chewiness. Service was great throughout and the bartender was really nice  always refilling my water. Had a great time and can t wait to come back for some more authentic Mexican food 
Licha's Cantina,114,My husband and I came here to meet up with some other Yelp friends on a Friday afternoon. We weren t hungry at the time so my husband and I ordered drinks while everyone else enjoyed some food and drinks.  The food did look really good and I hope to come back in the future. I saw that the menu had gluten free options which would suit one of my food sensitivity. Based on the menu it appears I would have no problem getting my dairy-free accommodations too.  Note that Licha s Cantina has  5 happy hour for food and drinks. They make an excellent spicy drink called the Vampiro. This drink has fresh jalapenos in it to give it an extra kick. Score   My husband enjoyed a few margaritas and said they tasted fresh.
Licha's Cantina,115,Licha s is great. Solid food  great flavor  I had the steak entree with chimichurri which was more than enough food. My wife had the snapper which was gigantic  not as flavorful as the rest of our dishes but the sides were good. Scallop Vera Cruz was fantastic as well. Cocktails however is where they lost a star.The drinks are good but they have a bit too much ice served in tiny glasses. It felt like I was at a dive bar. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes 
Licha's Cantina,116,Stopped by for a HH soiree with a few friends. Pro tip  get here early as the footprint is pretty intimate  small .   This is one of the best deals in town when it comes to HH Apps and drinks. I tried a couple of their spicy tequila drinks and they are indeed spicy. Want to spice it up more just ask. We tried a number of their Apps and all were great. We did love their small corn tortillas. Servers are busy but attentive and will take the time to explain their craft drinks and the menu. Great way to start of the evening and yes Licha s is in my HH rotation   Solid 4-4.5 stars.
Licha's Cantina,117,Edited review - I had some issues with a reservation and Lichas called back and fixed. Thank you 
Licha's Cantina,118,Went here a couple times pre-COVID for drinks and apps  and while the food and drink is pretty ok  and even better priced at happy hour   the main reason I won t be returning is the staff. I tried to give this place so many chances  but unfortunately each time I was treated with such disdain I felt uncomfortable dining there. No eye contact  suggested by the staff to leave rather than patiently wait for a table multiple times  kicked us out to the outdoor area mid-way through our meal  check being rushed to us trying to get us to leave asap  blatant eye rolling and scoffing at us  etc. And having worked in the service industry I understand what it s like to have a couple off days  but these were all over the span of multiple visits with different people. I tried so hard to like Licha s  but it s just not worth putting up with rude staff.
Licha's Cantina,119,First time to try Licha s.    The space Cute space with an even lovelier courtyard.  You can sit outside under some tall trees and even in the 100 degree heat it d be doable thanks to the fans and a light breeze  I sat outside while waiting for the table .  We sat inside the intimate old house tonight.  It s a little noisy  but that s to be expected  especially on a Thursday night.  There is a bar inside  too  where you can wait for your table.  The service I was almost immediately brought water and chips with two sauces.  Water refills were steady throughout the meal.  We had a friendly server named Candice.  She was helpful and attentive and took time to answer our questions about the menu.    The sustenance I tried a Paloma for my cocktail and it was pretty good  though not the most flavorful I ve had  although the spicy rim was good .  The chips are good and not greasy  are served with a spicy green sauce and a smoky tomato sauce similar to a mole.  Both were delicious   I ordered the build your own verdura tacos  sweet potato  watercress  corn  mushrooms  Napa cabbage  and pumpkin seeds  served with pico  escabeche  and four homemade corn tortillas.  This is easily enough for two meals and I brought half home.  The tortillas were delicious-not dry yellow chalky numbers but sweet and soft.  The seasonings were tasty-a very good meal.  My friend ordered the champiqueso botana  also served in a skillet and with corn tortillas  and it looked incredible    I will go back and try a couple other items that caught my eye.
Licha's Cantina,120,In East Austin wanted to try this restaurant. It s in a house. Parking is a bit of a challenge just need to drive and find a spot. It s paid parking- plenty of pay stations.   Starting with a pitcher of house margaritas- yep this works.   Ordered some guacamole- nice taste. Chips come with a green and red sauce. Excellent.  We ordered a number of different meals. The Chile Relleno an excellent pablano pepper was very interesting had black beans pumpkin seeds cheese not battered and fried- it s served with a steak knife sticking out of the pepper. Very tender excellent taste.   The mahi mahi shrimp tacos were very interesting.   We also had the mahi mahi plate. - excellent.   The strip steak was also excellent.   So the five of us felt the dish we all would order again was the red snapper with its great charred skin. It s a 5 star meal. The Huachinango Tikin Xio Red Snapper  Our server Daniel took excellent care of us he has been with the owner since the beginning. He explained they are serving meals from central Mexico  around Mexico City - and seafood that you would find along the coast in southern Mexico .  Was my wife s birthday we had a special treat - flan complete with a candle.   Clean bathrooms - fun atmosphere- great food. When in Austin come to the east side.
Licha's Cantina,121,I like to say that Licha s is my favorite Mexican restaurant in austin  definitely NOT Tex-mex. they have a great happy hour but I don t think I would drink here not on happy hour. Drinks are  9 and not super strong  but  6 on happy hour. I personally like the Paloma as I found the margarita way to sweet for my liking. This isn t a place I would come if I am looking to drink  but the food is amazing  I have gotten the queso and the tacos al pastor. The Al Pastor Tacos were GREAT and definitely enough for 2-3 people. My boyfriend and I split the tacos and we still had left overs 
Licha's Cantina,122,Pretty decent happy hour. I got a Bonita and a pork quesadilla. The quesadilla was phenomenal. The pork with bacon was just sublime and it had a ton of cheese too  great value for  5 . The drink was real sweet  but not overpowering . Just really refreshing on a sunny afternoon.  Check it out  Pretty cool stuff like a bone marrow flat bread  which wasn t too bad either .
Licha's Cantina,123,Had a delicious dinner and nearly forgot about the worlds chaos  The staff was prepared for the CDC standards and did an excellent job maintaining service while in face masks. The food and drinks were nothing short of perfect and the manager was on the floor making rounds to ensure guests were happy  I felt very safe and taken care of    Before the pandemic  I believe they didn t take reservations. They did this most recent time when we called the day of and we truly appreciated it    Go Lichas    I ll be back so soon    BTW  we had mezcal margaritas  ceviche  and the enchiladas...highly recommend all three 
Licha's Cantina,124,Although it s was probably the hottest day of ever   the place is charming and the food is delicious. They make the tortillas on site and the dishes offered aren t what is typically offered . The menu is Mexico City inspired . We enjoyed our ceviche   seafood tacos   mole and quesadillas. We even ordered a couple of dishes twice . Fav drinks were the mezcal ones . Everyone we encountered was friendly and accommodating. We would def return . Reservations are recommended.
Licha's Cantina,125,Delicious food and great atmosphere   The place seems unassuming from the front entrance but it s very spacious especially out in the covered back patio. I thought it would be hot sitting out there l  but it was very breezy and nice. My dog enjoyed it too    he even got a little water bowl.  I loved all the food I ordered. My family of 4 ordered 4 things and shared. We all left pretty full and satisfied. I had the bone marrow pizza  al pastor tacos  lengua tacos  and pollo con mole poblano. My favorites were the tacos  They came with fresh soft tortillas and the meats were so succulent and tender. The chicken dish was yummy as well  The sweet mole sauce complemented the savory flavors.
Licha's Cantina,126,ONE OF THE BEST HAPPY HOURS IN AUSTIN  The happy hour portions are still big and only  5 each   My group ordered all the food on the happy hour menu and nothing disappointed.
Licha's Cantina,127,I was craving Mexican food on a Friday night - lucky for me I live in Austin Texas where there is no short supply of Mexican food.   My friend recommended Licha s saying they have her favorite margaritas and that I had to order the gorditas.   We parked on the street  amp  sat inside. It was lively and very warm  we were by the front door that kept opening and closing .   Listening to my friend further  my boyfriend and I ordered the gorditas. Mhmmm  The meat was extremely tender pairing perfectly with the crispy corn pancake-tortilla. Sadly  my body did not like the dish as much as I did. In fact  both of our stomachs nearly rejected the gorditas  they were a bit fatty and greasy - probably what made them so tasty . We had terrible tummy cramps  aren t we cute   eattogether  crampstogether . I still recommend the gorditas but only to those who have iron stomachs or enjoy some pain with pleasure.
Licha's Cantina,128,We stumbled upon the amazing restaurant  lichascantina while scouring for a place to brunch before hitting the raid again. Lichs offers a short menu with a few amazing dishes packed with Mexican flavors. The atmosphere is amazing  The rustic Mexican decor  along with the amazing playlist  puts you right in the heart of an old Mexican film . Great food  great service  great vibe.
Licha's Cantina,129,First time coming here and it has been the best Mexican food I have tasted in Austin so far  Great service great music and delicious food and drinks  Must try the enchiladas potosinas  Definitely recommend for any out of towners like myself who want some great Mexican food and atmosphere 
Licha's Cantina,130,First time we went  we underestimated how busy it was going to be here and were told the wait time was 1.5 hours for a table of two so we left with the goal of coming back. We came for lunch one day and experienced no wait  hallelujah  so we were quickly seated. First off  looks can seriously be deceiving. The restaurant looks so small from the outside but there s plenty of seating on the inside. We had a really helpful and funny server who helped us decide what we wanted.   Licha s Cantina is an elevated Mexican restaurant which actually succeeds in capturing the essence of Mexican cuisine and presenting it in a classier upscale fashion. The menu was full of things I ve never heard of or tried before which made this experience so much more fun. I ended up getting the Flor de Jamaica  hibiscus  quesadillas which were so tasty  The sauces really made the dish amazing.   All in all  it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it 
Licha's Cantina,131,Such a hidden gem on the east side of Austin. The Mexican food is awesome and unique. The service is always good. I ve been going here for about 4 years and it never disappoints.
Licha's Cantina,132,Don t bother this isn t even mexican food. There s something about fancy mexican food that doesn t sit right. Like where it s super expensive and not good. This is the place.   If you want to grab a drink  do that. Don t waste your time and eat here. Service was incredibly slow and pretty sure our waiter forgot about us sometimes.   Would not recommend
Licha's Cantina,133,We sat at the bar on Sunday and had the cutest drinks  moderately priced  and were tended to with great service. The salsa was amazing. I can t wait to come back here for happy hour.
Licha's Cantina,134,Would probably go back to Austin just to go to Licha s again.  We decided to stop here on a whim during a long weekend in Austin and it s pretty much the best whim we ve ever had.  It s very  very fun and cool inside. Small  like someone s house  a little kitschy. Service was great. Margaritas were greater. The chips were fine  but the salsa was literally the best salsa I ve ever had. They set you up with a little bit of red  and a little bit of green. The green has a wonderful late heat  and the red has an incredible chipotle smokiness to it that drove us wild  in the best possible way.   She ordered tacos  I ordered the Campechano Huaraches. And this was after we had an incredibly unique and full-sized Ceviche. Just...amazing all across the board. Some of the best Mexican I ve ever had. And despite having like 4 margaritas each  don t worry  we re smart enough to Lyft when there s booze involved  the tab was significantly less expensive than we thought it would be. It was a wonderful  wonderful experience and we couldn t stop telling people about Licha s if they hadn t been there. If you re going to Austin  go here. It s incredible.
Licha's Cantina,135,What a great find. Not in the touristy section of town. Extremely authentic and fantastic food. Atmosphere was one of a kind. Great staff too.
Licha's Cantina,136,The Quick  Deliciius Mexican food that s not fancy nor pretencious. The unlimited chips and salsa are so addictive. Big covered outdoor area  and a few vegetarian options that are super tasty. The queso dip is legendary. Enjoy 
Licha's Cantina,137,I love this restaurant  I think it s charming and vibrant and cozy and homey. I mean... it s a house turned restaurant. Great front patio that kind of has a neighborhood block party vibe  everyone seems comfortable and jovial and familiar.    We sat inside and were brought chips and salsa -- a creamy green salsa and a red  both were delicious and spicy. The menu is almost all gluten free which is exciting and a testament to the authenticity of the cuisine -- this isn t Tex-Mex. I don t even think they have flour tortillas. I ordered the Tinga de Pollo sopecito  corn masa cups with black beans   which was filled with chipotle-orange braised chicken  crema fresca  napa cabbage  queso fresco  and crispy chicken skins -- soooooooo good  I also had a bite of the Aguacate sopecito which was just guacamole  crema fresca  queso fresco  and parmesan. The guacamole is insanely good. The texture is so silky smooth and light  like it s whipped. All of the food was beautiful and colorful and fresh  and the prices are so affordable considering how delicious and gorgeous your plate is.   They have a great cocktail list. Our uber driver on the way warned us to only have one margarita because they re strong. I stuck with a salty dog  I m not big on tequila but if you are  this place is for you.... the tequila list is nuts . I tasted my friend s marg and it was definitely potent    Our waitress was extremely cool and laid back and answered all of our questions happily. We never lacked drinks or chips or salsa  and she was constantly bussing our table  which we needed because it s a small space and we had a ton of food dishes glasses .   Loved everything -- food  service  prices  vibe. I would absolutely love to come back 
Licha's Cantina,138,This rustic  dimly-lit local favorite came recommended to me from a frequent eater because of its nice atmosphere.  It s a rainy day  and I walked right in early afternoon when normally there s a line and an hour wait I m told.  I sat inside the front room with the small orifice view of the busy kitchen action.  While using the decorated restroom and washing my hands in the common area  a glass of water in a mason jar was waiting for me next to the cloth napkin. The tortilla chips are very thick  and the red and green salsa are slightly more spicy and savory than what you would get at the average Mexican restaurant.  The recipes are from Mexico City.   My waiter wanted to help me find an appetizing dish  and I ordered the Verdura corn taco and it came with a pico and salad to taste.  The dish came on a small cast-iron skillet cooked just right was so delicious and dairy-free.  The tortillas held up very nicely.  It was very filling and I took the remains home in an aluminum container.  I so much enjoyed and appreciated the experience.  Enjoy 
Licha's Cantina,139,This place had been on my bookmark list for awhile  so I was happy to finally try it out when a friend suggested it to celebrate his recent promotion.  It is an intimate little eastside bungalow that could definitely use an upgraded AC as it seemed like it was hotter inside than out  no wonder we couldn t score a seat on the patio  . So our first order was for a cold drink. We both started out with their Mula and that hit the spot.  Per the norm for Mexican-style restaurants  chips and salsa were brought to the table and we added on the guac. Both were pretty solid  but since my body physically rejects spicy  I could only tolerate their mildest version of salsa in very small  controlled portions. Their guac was decent and is what I had more of.    We ordered and shared the Mol  con pollo  Quesadilla  and Pibil. The mol  was solid  not the best I ve had in Austin  but they know what they re doing. The quesadilla and pibil were solid as well  though I think of the three the only one I might order again was the pibil. The flavor was exceptional    I ordered a Paloma and my friend had a margarita. My Paloma was ok  but I wish I could have actually tasted the exotico reposado tequila that was supposed to be in it. My friend said their marg was also on the weak side.  We ordered the tres leches for dessert and it was stellar. It s hard to find a place that gets the texture to soggy ratio right and they do here. We also got what I called a  Chingaso Bueno - it was a chilled drink made on the spot by the bartender that combined tequila and espresso with creme de cacao and grand marnier. It was amazing and the perfect end to the meal.  So why the 3-stars  While our waitress was very nice and as attentive as she could be  it looked like she had quite a few tables   I docked a star because when my charge came back on my credit card it was  3 higher than my receipt. Turns out  7 tip on a  35 check was not good enough because my charge came through as  45. I got the issue resolved w my credit card company  but I definitely do not appreciate a place  or server  if it was her  that alters a charge after the fact. This is why I keep my receipts until a charge posts because I have found an alarming number of businesses seem to do this. And while  3 might seem negligible  it is indicative of underlying dishonesty and very off-putting for me personally. That being said  not sure if I would be back for that reason alone.
Licha's Cantina,140,The food here is incredibly flavorful and the drinks are amazing. They have such a great Happy Hour pricing that it s a must-go if you re looking for a bite after work. The staff is super kind and professional as well. Absolutely love their salsa and tuetano huarache. They have an awesome tequila mezcal selection if you re a fan.
Licha's Cantina,141,Food would have been great if the service wasn t so bad. The workers seemed rushed  mind you  we were the only ones eating  and seemed to enjoy ignoring us while looking at their phones when we were sitting for 10 minutes waiting to be served again. I actually had to get up from my table to go to the group of 3 that we re chilling at a table in clear sigh of ours  so we could get service. This is somewhere where we would have gone back because of the food  easily  but the young adults working just ruined it to where we never want to go back. The manager didn t even seem fazed that I was so upset. Just a  sorry  and NEXT  kind of attitude. Clearly management and customer service is a priority here.  After reading reviews  I m seeing that the main  gentleman  I had a problem with  was Emmanuel  Every bad description about a male server matches him. Like one person said. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS. Make sure he isn t even sitting across the room from you so he isn t looking at you. Pretty sure this is a family run business though  so good luck trying to get this joke of a waiter fired.  Note  I ve never posted a bad review about any terrible service I ve experienced because I feel like it s a waste of time. This is the first because it was that bad.
Licha's Cantina,142,Love this date spot. Another gem that makes the East Side unique. I went here on a weekend night and although it was packed out the door  the atmosphere and accommodating staff made the wait doesn t seem long at all.   The food was on point and very flavorful. Be prepare to be stuffed after leaving here.   Pro-tip  there s a bar out back and they sell PITCHERS  so feel free to grab a drink and chill.
Licha's Cantina,143,The food was absolutely amazing and the service was really quick  We were told an hour wait but got sat within 10 min and everything was amazing from the environment to the efficient service to the food. Def recommend this cute lil gem 
Licha's Cantina,144,Our party of three had a different experience than many reviewers --we thought the drinks were pretty good  not outstanding but definitely unique and that the food was very good  also unique and flavorful.  We had a great front yard patio experience dining on beef tacos  the guac and tongue sopecitas and the duck mole.  We liked each dish  found the ingredients fresh and the taste full of flavor .  As others have noted  the complimentary Chips and red and green salsas very nice.  We also had the watermelon marguerita and a ginger version of a Moscow mule.  We were just ok with those drinks.  The atmosphere and vibe is east Austin hipster chill.  So comments about slow service   It is just part of that scene.  We found street parking no problem.  We loved it and will be back   In a place with loads of Mexican restaurants  it s hard to find really good Mexican and this spot did it for us 
Licha's Cantina,145,My clan of out-of-towners we re delighted by the comfortable ambience and happening location. Wonderful non standard drinks and food 
Licha's Cantina,146,Went here for happy hour and felt the value was great  I had a really interesting flower quesidilla with a regular margarita for only 10 dollars total. The ambiance was cute  we sat on the porch . Enjoyed the uniqueness of the menu instead of the standard nachos I ve seen too many time. I enjoyed the multiple options for vegetarians available at the happy hour prices 
Licha's Cantina,147,WOW - hands down the best Tex-Mex food ever. I love the interior and has a cute patio outside as well. Definitely has its own unique style. I must say  they have THE BEST queso ever   Must order forsure.
Licha's Cantina,148,Great food. I tried the suadero tacos and I enjoyed it. They re very flexible with the reservations  and they text you when your table is available.  For a first timer that s a 5star place.
Licha's Cantina,149,Unlike 10 years ago  there are now a good number of restaurants in Austin that serve authentic interior Mexican food. This is one of those.   What sets Licha s apart  is that everything on the menu is delicious. We had sopes  huaraches  tacos  queso - and a few drinks. Well  more than a few.  But we had a sober designated driver .  Everything was delicious. The Tinga was amazing. The tacos al pastor were not prepared in the traditional way  but they were great anyway.   If you like Mexican food - and hey  who doesn t- you need to stop by Lichas and try everything.
Licha's Cantina,150,We visited on a Saturday and requested to sit outside on their tree-lit front patio porch.  It was about an hour wait  and we said no big deal we d visit the bar next door.  The hostess suggested their back bar and patio and I m glad she did   The hour wait flew by  we sat in the back in communal seating  and ordered a margarita  spicy margarita  and Paloma drink unsweetened - they were all delicious     The guacamole we ordered wasn t my favorite  but when it came time to be seated  everything we had for dinner was served by a knowledgable and friendly waitstaff and tasted AMAZING.  You gave to try the esquite  so good  and then the steak tampiqueno and cochinita pibil were delicious.  We will definitely be back   Great place to enjoy dinner  drinks  or drinks with apps.
Licha's Cantina,151,Fresh and punch Mexican flavours  with stellar cocktails and a doting staff.   We ate here yesterday  and I just tucked into my leftovers  man  they were incredible and it was even better fresh   Coming to the south from Scotland  as a vegetarian  I wasn t quite sure what to expect but this wonderful menu had so much for me to choose from I was bowled over.   Putting the tortillas to my mouth  the smell of the floor  mixed with cheese and mushrooms was unbelievable.
Licha's Cantina,152,This place is absolutely amazing  They have the best jalape o margarita I have ever had in my entire life   Their Chilaquiles are to die for  and I also would recommend the Queso Fundido 
Licha's Cantina,153,This is as authentic as you can get it in ATX.  Gosh  I m so lucky to have Yelp   co-workers who know all the great spots to grab a bite. This cute restaurant is on East 6th in a house. It s so adorable I can t get over it     My better half took me for a lunch date on a Saturday and it was perfect. It wasn t too busy or too quiet. There s seating inside and outside. The weather was nice  but we sat inside because I hate flies or any other bugs.  The first thing I ordered was a cocktail of course. I ordered the Lupita  watermelon infused tequila  agave  lime  jalape o  ah yes. It wasn t too sweet and I like that. The jalape o gave it a good kick.  Food-wise we started off with a Mahi Mahi ceviche. It was bomb. Def recommend.  For the main meals I ordered the Cochinita Pibil Sope  which is achiote braised pork  pickled red onion  avocado pico  and queso fresco. MY GOODNESS that s a mouthful. Literally. I did not expect it to be as much food as it was. It was definitely shareable after an app and drinks.  I can t wait to return. This is my new favorite place next to Sanchos in SA.
Licha's Cantina,154,Licha s is one of my favorite restaurants in Austin. The food and drinks are both high quality and the staff is accommodating. I ate here last week with my dad and had a couple cocktails. We shared the chile relleno and the red snapper  can t remember what this is called on the menu . Both were sooo good  I highly recommend both dishes  To drink I had the classic margarita and then the Lupita - it s watermelon infused tequila with jalape o - so freaking tasty   
Licha's Cantina,155,One word FIRE      For real the food is delicious  I will be returning   I would recommend this place if your in the Austin area go there you will not be disappointed.
Licha's Cantina,156,I was sad that we only came here for drinks because this place is ADORABLE. Beautiful views sitting outside with string lights and cute decor everywhere. The inside is quite nice too. Chips and salsa were very delicious  and the drinks are great too. An excellent find on the east side  and I will for sure be back for food next time   UPDATE  had the sopecitas- be sure to mix and match- and they were SO MOUTHWATERINGLY DELICIOUS. Great flavors in the chicken one and the lengua  my favorite and recommended by the waitress . The texture of the beef tongue was amazing  and I basically licked my plate clean. Perfect portion for dinner also or great to share with another person in addition to your entree. The house margarita is good too  but I recommend the watermelon jalape o margarita. I tried my friend s  and it was delicious  Not too spicy and not too sweet. I m in love with Licha s 
Licha's Cantina,157,The MOLE CON POLLO was incredible and the mole Sauce is one of the best I ve tasted. Great spot in Austin 
Licha's Cantina,158,Unbelievable find      This is definitely NOT Tex-Mex.   To us it is in an area we had yet to discover. It s on E. 6th Street but on the other side of I-35. We found it after visiting the Texas State cemetery. So glad we did.   It s located in a residential neighborhood in what I presume used to be a house. We sat in the bar area. Very cozy place with candles burning and a Spanish decor. Like your Grandmas kitchen if she was a Catholic Hispanic Abuela.   I had fish and shrimp tacos with giant hunks of Mahi Mahi and gulf shrimp. The grilled jalape o was perfect to add the heat. Grilled onions were a hit as well. My wife had the enchiladas. Not your typical rolled enchilada. These were almost deconstructed and stacked lake a lasagna. However it was presented they were amazing    Great selection of Mexican beers and Tequilas. Bartenders and staff were awesome. No doubt we will be back.
Licha's Cantina,159,Awful   Worst  Over-hyped restaurant I ve been to.  Doesn t even rate a star.
Licha's Cantina,160,i fell in love with this place  the vibe  atmosphere  culture was just OUTSTANDING  the food is so tasty i can literally remember every single bite. i will MOST DEFINITELY come back here at anytime any day  YUMMMMMMMMMMMMYYY
Licha's Cantina,161,Best Mexican restaurant in Austin. We ve been 3 times since moving and have always had an incredible experience - great atmosphere on Friday and Saturday nights.
Licha's Cantina,162,This place is loud. We waited an hour and a half before we were seated. Once we got our food it was not well seasoned. The chips were salty after you ate a couple. Save yourself time and don t bother.  The tacos are not your traditional tacos. And not to mention I was not able to get chicken tacos. Waiter was not the friendliest.
Licha's Cantina,163,I REALLY enjoyed my experience here last night. We arrived at about 630 on a Saturday night and were immediately seated on the back patio.   The outdoors and inside the little house are all decorated very warm and homey  a little Mexican folk  and it s absolutely to die for. So. Much. Charm.   We were immediately delivered some waters and some complementary chips with these delicious sauces. The red one is almost creamy  slightly sweet  some kinda pepper sauce. The green is a little spicier  both insanely delicious. I can typically barely dig in the chips and salsa basket when dining out but here I couldn t contain myself.   I ordered the Lupita which was a watermelon infused tequila and it was divine. The chile salt rim set it off. Fire   not the spicy kind . My husband had a Mezcal SideCar as well as a Paloma and a Michelada with Negro Modelo. The drinks are on the pricier side   10-12 for a cocktail   but they re delicious so I won t hate em for that. Plus I m gettin my money s worth in that free red salsa   I ordered the Sopecitos Aguacate- two little corn masa cups with black beans  three cheeses and guacamole. They. Were. Insane. Literally the most amazing thing I ve had in a while. I ll be dreaming of these. My friend ordered the same thing but the pork variety and while they were delicious  the pork left a little too much oil on her corn masa cups so mine ended up being a better choice. My husband got some steak tacos and they were delicious. The meat was awesomely fatty and kinda melted in your mouth.   Service was casual and friendly  not overly quick  but steady and consistent and made me happy to be there. My husband and I paid about  80 after a  12 tip for 4 drinks and 2 plates. The drink prices are the only reason this doesn t get a million stars.   Keep up the good work Lichas. I ll be back
Licha's Cantina,164,The place is very charming and warm.  Initially I  was a little take back because it looked like someone house.  We sat in the cover side yard with dirt floor. It had a laid back vibe.  We came for lunch so it was quiet.   The guacamole was great. Taco soft and fresh. Pork was a little dry. Beef was good. Champiqueso was great  The portions were big.
Licha's Cantina,165,Top notch place. Food A   Service A   Ambiance A    The food is not your typical Mexican that you can get everywhere  it has very unique and authentic interior MX food. I was blown away by the variety and the flavors. While I did try a boring carnitas dish  my friends all had unique items that I was overly impressed with. I knew I d be drinking later so I didn t want to be too adventurous  so I definitely will need to go back to enjoy the other menu items.  The portions are huge  so it wasn t the best choice before heading downtown  as I would have loved to take half home to enjoy later. You could definitely share if you d like. The prices are a bit high  but well worth it for the portion size.  The ambiance is great with some outside seating in front  cute interior and a bar garden out back. The idea is to wait out back until your table is ready  but it was way crowded so they accommodated me. They have beer buckets and great cocktails so it s a great spot to have a pre dinner drink and unwind before sitting down and over eating chips and salsa.  The owner goes above and beyond to take care of clients. I believe his dedication and true connections with his guests are what will make this place succeed in the long term. It s already busy all the time  but I can only see it continue to grow in popularity. The hostesses were also truly a delight  and very helpful and accommodating.   Thank you so much for my experience Friday night  I will forever be an evangelist for your restaurant 
Licha's Cantina,166,Lesson learned  order what you like.  The chorizoqueso is what I know I would like and it was delicious. Served in a hot skillet and tortillas - we ate every bite. I don t normally like beef tongue and this assured me. I m sure it s delicious for everyone else. Margaritas were wonderful - all of them. I would come here again to try more dishes.
Licha's Cantina,167,Great staff. Clean bathrooms. Amazing drinks...especially the jalapeno watermelon margarita. Delicious food. Enjoyable patio. Ceviche was only thing not impressed with...too sweet like pineapple salsa was saturating fish.
Licha's Cantina,168,Drinks were very weak. When I told the manager  the bartender and manager when off. I do not recommend this place. Many better places here in Austin.
Licha's Cantina,169,Everything we ordered was delicious    Must try  Ceviche  Legua  beef tongue tacos  Barbacoa de chivo  Braised goat  Enmoladas de Pato  Duck mole    Chips  amp  salsa were the bomb  3 dishes plus the ceviche was more than enough food for 5 people   I can t wait to go back to Atx to try more dishes 
Licha's Cantina,170,One of my favorite places in Austin  My boyfriend and I live down the street and come here all the time. Fantastic spicy Palomas. We always order the chorizo queso fundido  the quesadilla  tocinada  and carnitas gorditas. All amazing  The ceviche is really good too  Even their salsa they give you at the beginning when you sit down is some of the best I ve ever had.  Super cute patio and service is exceptional too  They ve always done their best to fit us in even when we come at 8pm on a Friday without reservations. One time they got my number wrong when we were on the waitlist and they couldn t get a hold of me on the phone so the manager came looking for us to tell us our table was ready   She literally found us at the bar at Latchkey and let us know which she obviously didn t have to do at all  but that s the kind of friendly service this place has.   Highly recommend this place to everyone 
Licha's Cantina,171,I was extremely disappointed with Licha s Cantina after all the raving reviews that I had read about it on yelp. The wait was an hour on a Friday evening which seemed reasonable to our group especially since they have an outdoor bar with free chips and salsa. We ordered 5 margarita-ish cocktails and they were alright  nothing too special just decent cocktails that you would expect at a regular bar  the Lupita was our favorite. The salsa was ordinary  you get better salsa at half decent Mexican restaurants. After an hours wait we were finally seated. The service was terrible  we had to wait for about 20 mins after sitting at our table to get water.  We ordered a variety of food options some referred by our server   but none of the dishes were outstanding. The beef tongue tacos were probably the only dish that was good.  The ambiance and the open kitchen were the only good things about this place . They have nice art and a cosy outdoor space which is nice to hang out on a Friday evening. I would not recommend this place for food but it s a nice place to hang out for quick drinks before dinner on a weekend
Licha's Cantina,172,Get the choriqueso - a skillet of melted cheese and chorizo topped with pico and guac. Served with corn tortillas. Delicious   And great watermelon margaritas    Went on a Saturday night - wait was only 30-45 minutes and well worth it.
Licha's Cantina,173,Charming Eastside restaurant with lots of outdoor seating  authentic Mexican food  and a great happy hour   Happy Hour is Tuesday through Friday 4-7pm.  And everything on the happy hour menu is five bucks.  Including their awesome drinks - I got the Bonita  honey ginger rum  horchata  and a spicy cinnamon rim  and a ton of food options   The have a lot of vegetarian options - and they re marked on the menu   There were so many things I wanted  but I ended up trying the Flor de Jamaica quesadilla  because hibiscus flower in savory food was something new for me   It was very good   Next time I want to try nopal salad  the mushroom huarache  the nopal tlacoyo  and all of their veggie appetizers     Great food  great drinks  great happy hour  adorable setting.  Great place to grab a bite or have drinks on the Eastside 
Licha's Cantina,174,Unfortunately  this was a very bad experience and could ve been much worse.  We went out on a group function.  The first indication that we noticed was that the waiter seemed like he didn t want to be working.  From the time we sat down this waiter seemed annoyed. Anytime one our group members ordered anything  he would role his eyes.  Second  after I ordered a drink from the bar the waiter brought my drink to another table.  After the person drank from the glass he brought it over to me to have.  My co-worker pointed out what he had done.  Needless to say I returned that beverage.  Lastly  was that after ordering sopes  the item I found in my meal was shocking.  I was so lucky that it missed my teeth and didn t go down my esophagus.
Licha's Cantina,175,So this place has happy hour everyday from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.  Pretty killer as I m not often in Austin during the week days.  I had a couple of reasonably priced Palomas - nice alternatives to margaritas  not as hangover-y for me.  Must be that therapeutic grapefruit juice  right    Gluten-free foodies  Licha s has got you covered  because you know - corn   A couple of dining companions of mine had the octopus dish  which not going to lie  made me a little cringe-y because yo  octopuses are wicked smart.  Don t act like you haven t received the YouTube video FWDs from your mom  octopuses are probably more intelligent than your dogs  or child  I m just saying  .  The husband remarked that although he s not typically a fan of octopus  it was the most delicious octopus he s ever had.  So yay for that   Vegans  good news   The verdura tacos are vegan and they are freaking delicious   I know the concoction of sweet potatoes  mushroom  corn  watercress  and Napa cabbage probably isn t something seemingly to swoon over but as far as competently seasoned and sauteed veggies go - they were boss.  I actually felt compelled to save my meager leftovers because I knew I would regret discarding any serviceable taco deliciousness for later consumption.    We sat outside in front  at the oversized table and service was consistent and lovely.  The restroom is interesting  one of those single toilet closet-like set-ups with a co-ed sink and mirror area.  I assume this restaurant was formerly a residence   Anyway I m pretty fond of it in its converted state  try it out y all.
Licha's Cantina,176,Just go. My absolute favorite restaurant in Austin. Every dish I had was out of control amazing. Staff was awesome  music was fantastic  just... go.
Licha's Cantina,177,I d give 6 stars if I could. I ve been wanting to come here for over a year but it s always so busy  a good sign . Sat outside on the humble but cozy patio  great ambience for a date night. The operations were adapted well for COVID  felt safe going out to eat there. I m sure all the cocktails are great  but I recommend the Anejo Manhattan. The food though was absolutely delicious and will keep me coming back. One of my fave spots in Austin  and close enough to the East side bars to have a nightcap.
Licha's Cantina,178,First restaurant in Austin  and soooo worth the 14 hour drive. Authentic Mexican food  not Tex mex  so expect some things that might be a little unfamiliar. The atmosphere is super cute too- a little house with Mexican decor and a nice patio area. We had the gorditas con chiccarron which were delicious but needs the cilantro and onion garnish to truly be flavorful. We also had the carnitas and bacon quesadillas which were delicious and full of flavor. Service was a tad slow but not terrible.
Licha's Cantina,179,I came here on a Tuesday night and it was an hr wait. It went by fast  but just be mindful. While waiting we all had the watermelon margarita and it was fantastic. It was hot out so it goes down smooth.  The vibes at this place are great also.  The food was hit and miss  but the drinks make up for the food.
Licha's Cantina,180,This is an awesome new Mexican restaurant with great service  food  and drinks  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas to start as well as the choriqueso. The margarita pitcher was a great decision--it ended up being between two and three drinks for each of us  4 . Choriqueso was delicious as well. Also enjoyed the chips and two salsas  green and red  which were always refilled promptly. I ordered the Carnitas de Puerco--yummy and very filling  For such a trendy restaurant  portions were quite good considering the price. Service was great and I enjoyed sitting outside in the covered tent. No wait for four on a Wednesday night around 7ish.
Licha's Cantina,181,I LOVE Lichas  On a nice sunny day their patio is so lovely. Great cocktails  we had several including this straight up hibiscus creation straight out of sex and the city  Significant other got pork tacos and I got a fish. I thought the guac could have used some lime and more salt  I just squeezed the lime out of one of our drinks. Problem solved  Lichas is super cute  highly recommend checking it out 
Licha's Cantina,182,Came here for a bachelorette party last night - of course with the location it was jam packed. However  I ll start with the fact that I showed up for my reservation at 7 30 - and we had to wait 20 more minutes before the table was even set up.  The drinks were great - I recommend the Bonita if you re looking for a boozy horchata    The food did not disappoint  but the portions are HUGE. You can split easily    The food and our waiter made up for the chaos and the wait. I recommend stopping in if you re craving  some good  and gluten free  Mexican food 
Licha's Cantina,183,Sometimes when you re just sitting there  you look around in amazement and can t figure out for the life of you how you got somewhere. That s what I was thinking when I was sitting outside of Licha s at 6 00pm with the temperature well beyond 100 degrees. Then I realized that with my own personal fan  cool cabana  frosty drink  no humidity and having a wonderful time made me do it. I m thinking frosty drinks and wonderful time often get me into those situations.   We came here early knowing that it would be busy and popular. Right on both counts. The house that they work out of can fit a LOT of people into it  but it was jam backed and outside looked more intimate and fun. If you could get away from the heat. They had fans blasting each table and the shade with unusually low humidity just cried out to us. The drink menu just shouted out to us. I ordered an off-menu mojito which was just the ticket. Then I changed up to the Tlalpan and found my new lifetime friend. The menu said   ca a brava rum  mint  pineapple  agave  lemon  lime  topped with a splash of soda.  I called it a pineapply mojito.  I have no idea what type of music was on the speakers  but it was just rocking away. I would be streaming it right now if I could put a name to it.  We started with the staple of chips and salsa. I m not sure I would call it a salsa as it was more pureed. There was a red color and a green color. I think they were messing with my 12 year old brain. Green should have been stop and red go. The green was tasteless until I was fully committed. Then my tongue exploded in a thermonuclear reaction. The red was a bit tomato y and sweet. I stuck to it.   For an appetize we tried the choriqueso. That was just about the coolest appetizer I ve ever had at a cantina. It came in a little square cast iron griddle. It was a pile of melted cheese in just that perfect melted texture with salty  cheesy kick. It went on the small tortillas. If you were good a getting the cheese  you will get a great dollop of chorizo and guacamole. It made for perhaps 6 little tacos between us and a lot of hand stabbing with forks as we tried to out eat each other.  For the main meal I had the cochinita pibil. There was a small clay pot of pulled pork. It was savory  but not over the top flavor. The pickled onions were a unique complement. Didn t think I would like it  but I did. It advertised that it was spicy. I don t know where that came from  mine was pleasantly mild. I made my own little tacos with the wonderful homemade tortillas. Finally  the standard refried black bean puree was actually a treat. MUCH better than I was expecting because it looked just like everywhere else. But it tasted even better   There s a reason that this place is popular  great food  awesome staff  and a unique experience. This is the reason that Austin is a mecca of food  fun  and music. Now if I only knew what that music was called 
Licha's Cantina,184,Came to Austin for a little get away and while looking for a place to eat we found this place and I m so glad we came. Sopesitos and Tacos al pastor were really delicious . Definitely visiting again next tome we come to Austin   
Licha's Cantina,185,Wasn t too busy on a Thursday night. We were seated immediately but it was quite full inside. This place is one of those houses converted into a restaurant kind of environment. Service was great and friendly.  Drinks were not anything too special. I tried the Paloma because I love me some grapefruit. Unfortunately  you could not even taste there was grapefruit in it even though there s literally grapefruit and grapefruit soda.  Where the drinks lack is where the food makes up for it. The Enmoladas De Pato was amazing. Ugh  couldn t get over how good the duck was. Overall  this place is a bit pricier than I anticipated but nonetheless a solid choice on 6th street 
Licha's Cantina,186,I dig this place  I ve probably driven by 100 times without noticing it was there  but it has definitely caught my attention now. We were hoping for a spot on the great outdoor patio  yard on an unseasonably warm January afternoon  but the inside was actually really cool. As much as I love a good queso and sizzling plate of fajitas  the interior Mexican cuisine was a refreshing and delicious break from your typical Austin Tex-Mex.   I went for happy hour  which has a great variety of  5 items  including plenty of tasty drinks and delicious food. As a fan of horchata  the only thing that can make it better is to mix in a healthy dose of booze. That s exactly what they do with the Bonita and serve it with a spicy cinnamon rim. I actually wasn t a huge fan of the spicy cinnamon  but the rest of the drink was good. The food items I tried were all great  with my personal favorites being the mole con pollo huarache  flatbread made with corn   the tinga de pollo sopecito  think like an extra thick tostada  and tocinada quesadilla  we all know quesadillas... .Also  the red salsa they serve with the chips was really good and had a  smoky flavor that kinda reminded me of bacon     .
Licha's Cantina,187,Fresh and delicious. While it looks tiny from the street it has a large covered backyard. Happy hour is the best time to go  with certain meals and drinks on special. When your food comes out you may think the portions are small  but I left comfortably full. The salsa selections were on point and unique to the restaurant. I would definitely visit again if I m in Austin.
Licha's Cantina,188,This is a really great date spot even if it is a bit close to the highway. Great ambiance. Guac is on point. Every taco I ve ever gotten here has been amazing. And their bean sauce is next level. EAT HERE.
Licha's Cantina,189,We were really excited to try this restaurant  but it s too expensive for what they have to offer  The choriqueso is superb. The pastor is good  but the suadero does nos taste like real Mexican street tacos 
Licha's Cantina,190,Came here for a nice dinner craving some authentic Mexican food and heard this was a good spot to check out. The entire restaurant is super cute and cozy - it s literally a house transformed into a cantina. When we arrived on a Friday night for dinner around 8pm the entire restaurant was packed. We were immediately seated  however in a seating area on the outside side of the house. There must not have been tables available but we would ve happily waited for an inside table  as it was December and the outside patio was freezing. Unfortunately there were no heaters or heat lamps and it made the dinner experience quite uncomfortable as we were sitting out in the cold.   We were pretty hungry so we ordered the fish Ceviche and Choriqueso as appetizers as well as the Alambre de Pescado Y Camaron tacos and the Carnitas Gorditas as entrees. The food was delicious and we especially loved the Choriqueso. I would highly recommend ordering this dish  and I typically am not even a fan of queso. The fish and shrimp tacos were also a favorite  especially since they came out piping hot on a skillet and were nicely seasoned and packed with flavor. We were slightly disappointed by the ceviche as it was not what we expected - instead of the lime marinade I am used to  it came in a black spice and citrus marinade which was interesting. Not bad but definitely different.   Overall  very much enjoyed our experience and loved the food  but what was a good night could ve been a great night had we been seated inside where it was warm instead of outside in the cold.
Licha's Cantina,191,What a lovely and charming place to dine on the Eastside  Heather F. and I met here for happy hour and I was happy with the drinks  food and atmosphere. While the online menu does not list it they serve wine on the drink menu and there is food on the happy hour menu.  During happy hour they offer a selection of cocktails and food items  some are smaller portions off the regular menu  for  5. Notably on the menu they highlight some vegetarian options. I ordered a glass of malbec  the flor de Jamaica quesadillas  happy hour portion is 2 pieces  and we shared the champinon huaraches  corn flat breat . The quesadilla had ample gooey cheese and the blue corn tortilla was a bit chewy. The highlight was the delicious flatbread full of mushrooms  freshly graded queso asadero  with a light drizzle of crema and served with a spicy peanut sauce.  The quality of the food was excellent and the happy hour cannot be beat.
Licha's Cantina,192,My absolute favorite in Austin for Mexican food which I m not even a huge fan of  Lots of people seem to flock towards Matt s and I used to be one of them but after discovering Licha s there s only one Mexican restaurant for me   This place has everything  Super authentic  always buzzing and lively with fun and friendly people  Great wine pours  free chips and salsa and just the cutest decor and most positive vibes  The food was delicious we got the hibiscus flower quesadilla if u love quesadillas like me than it s a must  Was quite a small portions so suggest u get it as an appetizer and share it   Please please come and experience this magical place 
Licha's Cantina,193,Out of the Mexican restaurants in Austin  this is one of the ones you should go to for a full sit down style. The tacos are extremely good and it comes in a small pan with saut ed vegetables soaked in sauce along with the meet. Very good. The drinks were also very good and they definitely give you a good pour of alcohol in your cocktail  The only item we were not huge fans of  were the chips. They were a bit stale. However  the salsa was absolutely tasty.  The ambiance is a lot of fun  it is always busy and you definitely need to make reservations if you can  especially on brunch Saturday   and the service is very good. Will definitely be coming back here again.   Dogs are also allowed in the front patio as well as the back patio  just not the small area within the restaurant .
Licha's Cantina,194,Licha s Cantina is an A-OK spot on the East Side. They have a great outdoor area  a fairly good happy hour  and a friendly staff. It s a good place to grab a bite if you re in the area  but I wouldn t make a trip out of visiting.   I have had almost all the food on their happy hour menu  this includes tacos  quesadillas and basically every alcoholic choice. Nothing has ever blown me away. The presentation is beautiful  like almost everything Licha s does  but the taste isn t anything to write home about. I m pretty sure Happy Hour last until 6PM and includes  2 tacos and  5 quesadillas - not bad.   My biggest gripe is the lack of AC at all. They have fans going inside  but on a hot Austin day  they do almost nothing. Come in the  fall  and sit outdoors  that s the best way to enjoy Licha s.
Licha's Cantina,195,For all the hype  there are a million better places to go. It all started with the salsa at the beginning. Both were so spicy you couldn t even enjoy them. I understand one spicy salsa  but two that were both unenjoyable seems excessive. The drinks were weak and devoid of flavor. We tried three different drinks  and all just tasted like their respective alcohol over ice topped with water. In additional  anything that wasn t the overly spicy salsa was so bland. I had a covid scare because I couldn t taste my chicken tinga. Turns out it was just bland cooking and was not limited to the chicken tinga  every main dish at our table suffered the same lack of flavor. To top it off  the service was mediocre at best. Sauces were forgotten several times  incorrect drink orders were delivered and the steak on one dish was severely undercooked. It couldn t even be cut it was so raw. It looked more like tartar than steak on the taco shell. I really went in wanting to love this place  but it is a classic tourist trap.
Licha's Cantina,196,El Pastor Tacos  ay dios mio  This cozy east side restaurant has the best margaritas and tacos in town. Serving up authentic traditional Mexican with an east side Austin vibe.
Licha's Cantina,197,This place was surprisingly delicious. The portions were a perfect size. The only down side was that they had no a c so it is very hot and I would recommend to go at night. Margs were good 
Licha's Cantina,198,WOW   Had friends in town for ACL and I got a recommendation for Licha s.   Food was amazing   We went in mid afternoon so just some drinks and split a few entrees.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  They had tons of options  including plenty of plant based ones for the vegan in our group.    Have to say the service kind of sucked  otherwise would give a 5 star.  They weren t busy when we got there  but waited a long time for drink orders and then food orders.  Once we got the orders in things moved pretty quickly.   If you are looking for tex mex or your standard fare  go elsewhere.  If you are looking for something authentic and full of flavor  check this place out   Just bring your patience.
Licha's Cantina,199,BEST MEXICAN FOOD IVE EVER HAD      Every thing I ordered was amazing I drinks appetizers entree and desert AMAZING I ve been looking for authentic Mexican food and this is it  Love it can t wait to visit Austin again   
Licha's Cantina,200,Great experience over Labor Fay Weekend   Bottom line is each dish we tried was amazing   Scallops  vegan queso  carnitas tacos  red snapper and chicken mole were all superb.  We will be back soon 
Licha's Cantina,201,Best HH in East Austin   Great drinks and food for  5  cute patio  and fun atmosphere. Don t miss it  
Licha's Cantina,202,This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences we ve had in a long time. I ordered the chile relleno. There was an option to add various proteins  and I chose beef  thinking that the beef would be added to the dish. It was a side   Who would order a  handful of horribly overcooked  and by that  I mean actual pieces of char in your mouth  chopped up pieces of some mystery meat   The kitchen had failed to remove the seeds from the pepper so consequently each and every bite was filled with a horrible texture and was picante beyond reason. My husband ordered the steak tampiquena. Mole sauce was good  but the dish was ruined by the lumps of charcoal trying to impersonate steak. No sides come with the  platos  and after a 15  gratuity and a  6 delivery  plus service charges the charge for this was  66.00. They either hate folks who order take out or we got the kitchen on an epic failure night.
Licha's Cantina,203,The restaurant is set up inside an old house so it creates a crazy cool ambiance. We sat outside and was seated on the front porch. It was fun to get great service and also have a homey feel of sitting on a houses porch. I had the WATERMELON Margarits 2 of them   Highly recommend. One of us got the gorditas which is a sandwich type taco filled with juicy pork and cheese. I got the quesidlla with bacon in it and was SO good. They make their own tortillas there so that adds to the texture. Lastly one of us got the steak build your tacos. Which the meat was so flavorful and yummy  The salsas are interesting because they aren t chunking ...more of a sauce but one had a smokey Chipotle flavor and the other had Verde vibe. Would def go back here  Waiter was speedy and nice. And they whole staff worked as a team from seating us  giving us chips   bussing our tables and getting us our food 
Licha's Cantina,204,We loved this place. The queso with mushrooms was awesome. The watermelon margaritas were great. The chips and two types of creamy salsas they put out were awesome.
Licha's Cantina,205,Sadly I found this Mexican spot to be below average. Al pastor Tacos came out burnt black and tough. Queso chorizo came out just warm so the cheese wasn t pulling apart or as melty as it should be. The cochinita pibil sandwich was average but I was confused by the choice to soak the bread in salsa and cover the top of the bread in crema  it made it difficult to eat. Horchata was above average not overly sweet or gritty. Paloma was not well balanced
Licha's Cantina,206,Fun date night on a Saturday. Street parking was not a problem. We arrived during a busy time  but our wait was fairly short  20-30 min .  We sat at the bar in the meantime and enjoyed a couple of drinks.  I had the Lupita and it was delicious  So delicious  I ordered another 2 while I was there.     The chips  homemade  and salsa were fresh and tasty. We had the Al Pastor and the Alambre tacos. Both very tasty and each were served on a personal skillet paired with fresh corn tortillas and pico de gallo. Sooo good   I definitely recommend this place and look forward to returning for a good happy hour 
Licha's Cantina,207,Had a group dinner here 7 6 18.  Several people in our group ordered cocktails  but no one ordered a second for two reasons  1. no one liked their cocktail enough to want to order another one  they were all pretty watery and no one said their cocktail was great  2. our server was MIA from our table for a good 30 minutes and we didn t have the opportunity to order anything else  I wanted to order a beer  at least .  I get that we were a large group on a busy Friday night  but  whenever our server did make it to our table it was fly-by style and you really had to be on it to catch her attention  I actually had to wave my hands in the air  in desperation .  Most of the dishes served were by bus people that couldn t take any food or drink orders.  Although my friend and I ordered before the folks at the end of our table  the appetizers arrived except ours and when we finally got a hold of our server to ask where our appetizers were she said she  didn t hear us order guacamole   even though she nodded her head when I ordered it and that our other appetizer  the esquite  was  on the way   I think she completely forgot both  and it would behoove her to write down orders rather than relying on her memory .  Finally our appetizers arrived  45 minutes after we ordered them and after our main courses were served. Comically  really  at this point  the guacamole came without any chips...and it took another 15 minutes to flag down a bus person to bring us chips. I requested from the bus person that  finally  brought the guacamole long after we even wanted it to remove it from the bill  but it was still on the bill.  Because of our party size 20  gratuity was automatically included and this is my only restaurant experience  and I dine out frequently  in which I considered arguing it.  I cannot fairly comment on the appetizers since I only had a spoonful of each.  My main entree  the cochinita pibil  was a generous portion and very tasty  the reason this review is 2-stars vs. 1-star .  Although I never had the opportunity to order a second drink  thankfully the bus staff is excellent at refilling the water glasses.
Licha's Cantina,208,Lichas is an awesome hidden gem in my opinion  I am new to Austin and I am a sucker for a good chill vibe. I tried the Tinga De Pollo Orange and chipotle braised chicken. A great dish to share  The inside is nice for a date night or you can just kick back in their homey front yard patio atmosphere. Plenty of shade. Candy was very kind and a great waitress. I shall return   Spicymagarita
Licha's Cantina,209,They have some classics that brought back great memories . The music   the food  the drinks - they were all great  
Licha's Cantina,210,I wished i woulda took pictures but once I saw what I ordered  sorry forgot what it was and dont see it in he menu pics  those worries went away. Very unique flavor that I havent experienced before with Mexican food.  Chips and salsa were also really good  the Verde had a really nice spice to it
Licha's Cantina,211,Licha s is legendary Mexican food in Austin from my point of view. I don t know how we didn t wait in line  last time I tried to go the wait was over an hour so go on predictably off times--like a random Wednesday for dinner. The service was great. Licha s team was friendly and attentive.   I had the beef tacos that  I m told  everyone mistakes for pork. They were divine  A friend of mine ordered the burger  a newish item . It was massive but I had a bit and it was delicious. The ceviche appetizer wasn t my favorite but it was good quality. I highly recommend Licha s to anyone living in or visiting Austin. It is a must do especially if you re on the east side.
Licha's Cantina,212,Wow. This place was unbelievable. Classic 6th. My wife and family shared a margarita pitcher with some quest to start and it was amazing salty goodness. My wife and I then had a Gordita with carnitas in it. Was probably the best Gordita I ve ever had  I would for sure recommend this place.
Licha's Cantina,213,I discovered this place during COVID. Our server Emanuel. He was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Such great service  amazing food  and delicious atmosphere. 10 10 would recommend Emanuel as a server. Perfect experience. Thank you SO much 
Licha's Cantina,214,Awesome spot with great food drinks service  Can t wait to go back to have some spicy margaritas  
Licha's Cantina,215,TERRIBLE service from server Emmanuel. AVOID HIM AT ALL COST  Walked up to the table and only said  how can I help you   I asked if something had cheese and his response was  if it doesn t say it  then no. I m not sure what everything has in it.  How is that helpful   Also he Didnt check on us once when we got the food. We Had to grab someone else to get our check. He dropped it off and walked away without a single word.  Meanwhile  while all of this was happening  I could LITERALLY see him in the kitchen corner on his phone. Licha s used to be one of our favorite restaurants  but this might have been one of the worse service I ve ever had....we were really hoping we could get this rectified  we even expressed our dissatisfaction and was hoping we could get it resolved with a manager  but none showed up.  Will be posting this about our food Instagram account as well.
Licha's Cantina,216,First time here  totally impressed  The vibe was most Awesome  Excellent Service  Phenomenal Fare  From the moment we walked in we felt welcome  The owner  Daniel Brooks stopped by  amp  thanked us for coming into his establishment. Our server  Candy continued to stop by our table  amp  check on everything. The flavors  presentation  amp  level of service makes this quaint restaurant a must for someone who appreciates Authentic Mexican cuisine  Jim Palladino  CWO3 US Navy Retired
Licha's Cantina,217,Your biggest regret when dining at Licha s will be that you didn t go sooner...  Unfashionably late to the party  we made Licha s our destination for a double-birthday celebration and froggied that menu. Licha s Cantina is by far the best Mexican food I ve ever had in Austin. Unanimously  after sharing and devouring everything we ordered  almost   the squad acknowledged that everything on the menu popped. Don t let that distract you from the fact that the portions and plating were legendary-status.  While the whole squad agreed that the entire meal was fire  we have to talk about the lengua sopacitos and huachinango tikin xic in particular  since both were both mind-blowing. Every beef tongue filet in our starter had perfect texture  and the red snapper entree was delectable. Blackened with finesse  the latter s rich natural flavors mingled with a variety of citrusy and starchy flavors without ever distracting from tha sensational oo-mami of this oh-snappah  Licha s chef has mastered getting the most out of every ingredient  so you ll only ever want any bite to end so you can experience another one all over again.  Otherwise  presentation for both of these dishes was colorful and eye-catching  and the service was excellent. Licha s Cantina is without a doubt  an Austin dining destination.  Get your flavin up  not your cravin up
Licha's Cantina,218,Music is way too loud.table of four and we had a very difficult time talking. Food     The chips and salsa  green excellent  Red excellent. Chips are the cheapest store bought chips. Like eating cardboard. Just average food. Food should have flavor and the tacos pastor were just okay. Very overpriced for the quality of the food. Pretensious hipster overpriced Austin food  pass on this place  Wait staff was confused and slow.  Way better restaurants other places
Licha's Cantina,219,Magical Mexican and you expect to see Robert Rodriguez come around the corner. Greats tacos. Delish margaritas.
Licha's Cantina,220,This place is fabulous  Reminds me of having supper in my very own backyard in my hometown. Great happy hour. Sat up on the back porch overlooking the front yard seating and had a beautiful experience.  The H H cocktails were on point. Especially for  5. The food was great as well. Too many things to list  Definitely recommend and will bring friends.
Licha's Cantina,221,Came to this place with high hopes on the food after reading all the reviews... I m originally from Houston  amp  so far found that restaurants rated  best in Austin  are nothing short of basic  amp  bland. This place doesn t seem to know what seasoning is  amp  their waiters could use a real attitude check as well. Went through hell trying to find parking just to be served lackluster food. Was celebrating my mom s bday  amp  was very disappointed in our overall experience. They also charged extra for water  tortillas  amp  cream  meats were dry  amp  needed some type of sauce to go with   amp  ended up paying about  60 for this sh t. We were better off going to Chili s or torchy s tacos. Pretty sure all these good reviews were from drunk people on 6th. Don t waste your money 
Licha's Cantina,222,First time visit for Sunday brunch.  I am not much of a bruncher but when Sunday starts off with a killer margarita all bets are off.  No trouble getting a table outside but we waited 15 minutes for a porch table so the precious pooch was not in the dirt. In the meantime I went inside to the groovy bar and ordered a couple drinks. Btw they are really into some nice mezcals.  Once seated and starving we tore into a choriqueso with a double wide Tecate and pomegranate tequila liqueur mimosa. Homemade corn tortillas were quite tasty with the queso.  For mains we opted for Cochinita Pibil Benedict and the goat dish. Both were quite savory and tasty. The dog thought so also.  We were all good.   The service was always great and friendly. The prices might seem a little higher than expected but when you taste the food you will know it is not ordinary.
Licha's Cantina,223,Our server was rude.  Checking on a table meant quickly walking by and not asking if we needed another drink.  Food was delivered to the table except for one of my friends and he had to wait another 5 minutes to get his food.  Food was ok  but salsa was horrible.  I won t go back.
Licha's Cantina,224,Food and service have always been absolutely exceptional. Selections are creative and just spectacular. One of our new favorites in town  
Licha's Cantina,225,This 5-star review is mainly for the bar  and bartenders at Licha s Cantina.  I LOVE this bar  and it s currently my favorite in town.  I stumbled in to this place a few months back with three very good friends  and we snagged the sweet corner spot at the bar.  We all ordered tequila or mezcal drinks.  I chose the spicy watermelon margarita.  Since watermelon is not currently in season you won t be able to order that one for now.  I recommend the regular spicy margarita in the meantime.  It s divine   I won t go in to food too much  but it s very good.  However the atmosphere and the drinks are the very most important part about this restaurant.  I did really love the ceviche though   I will definitely start branching out because it looks like there are some great dishes.  Back to the bar  my favorite part   There are two bartenders that I am guessing work there every Saturday  and I think they re both the best ever.  One is a tall  good looking blonde man  and the other is a lovely and good looking brunette woman.  These two make the party happen.  They are very funny  very nice  and they make cocktail masterpieces   Great peeps these two.  Great peeps.  I love Licha s.  I wanna have my birthday here this year  and possibly every year to be honest.  Until then  I will continue to frequent my favorite bar  with my favorite bartenders  and I might even order some ceviche.
Licha's Cantina,226,Spent a long weekend with friends in Austin and this was our first stop after 18 hours on the road. It was definitely the right decision.   Fantastic Mexican food and drinks. I had tacos al pastor washed down with Modelo Especial. Maybe some of the best al pastor I ve had. Most of the time  the ambiance of a restaurant is incidental to my enjoyment  but I loved the cozy feel  excellent music  and decor.   Not sure when I ll be back in Austin  but I already know my first stop.
Licha's Cantina,227,We came here for lunch. It s a house looking establishment on 6th street with a really cool interior.  My hubs and I had an appetizer that was very delicious and than ordered a  pizza like  dish to split that was also excellent. We could ve been fine with the appetizer because we were full but wanted to try something else because the first dish was so good. Really good food and a fun vibe. Highly recommend   It would be fun to come with a group and share plates.
Licha's Cantina,228,Came after a storm and staff were quick to clean up outside tables and accommodate guests. If you get there and there s a wait  go to the bar our back. Great atmosphere and they ll make you a delicious drink. Food was great as was the service. First visit  all four plates from our table were great.
Licha's Cantina,229,This was hands-down the best mexican food I ve ever had. A bit of a revelation  really.   I m so used to seeing tacos with tiny little cubes of meat  unrendered fat  etc. Here  tacos come with a delicious platter of meat that lets you see it how it  should  be--the tacos al pastor come with nice sized pieces of perfectly cooked pork  and fresh yummy pineapple. And the lengua tacos -- now I know how lengua should be cooked. Crispy on the outside  tender on the inside. The enmoladas de pato are next level. Mole plus duck is a perfect combination. And the tres leches...  Before I arrived  I complained about having it the same dish at another restaurant that was too dry. Here  the cake comes surrounded in a ramekin of sweetened condensed milk.   The drinks are great  too. Go here 
Licha's Cantina,230,Of all the meals I ate in my long weekend in Austin  this was my favorite.  My parents  my boyfriend  and a friend came here for dinner and were so hungry to think straight.  Our server very patiently walked us through the menu and gave us several recommendations  to the point we trusted whatever he said to order - and I have to say  he really knew what he was talking about   I wish I remembered all that we ate but we ordered quite a bit and everything was delicious and we were all so happy with the food.  Between the food  the margaritas were FLOWING in the best possible way  and it was honestly one of the best meals out and experiences I ve had in a while.  This place was so fantastic  great decor  great food  amazing waitstaff  incredible margaritas  this was a perfect night out.
Licha's Cantina,231,Brunch Review  I love Licha s Cantina. I love the house  I love the food drinks  and the people. I came for brunch and got the Chicken Tinga Quesadilla and the ceviche. The quesadilla was delicious  and hit the spot. When my ceviche came out though I was pretty disappointed. The price and quantity was not worth  15. I don t recommend this item on the menu. Drinks were great  like always. I had the Hibiscus Ginger Mimosa and it was very refreshing. Overall  I still like Licha s and I think you should try it out 
Licha's Cantina,232,Went here tonight for the first time. The atmosphere is really cool. We sat outside on the porch when all of the lights were lit. Chips and salsa is served right away and the two salsas both had really good flavor.   We got two cocktails  Lupita  seasonal  and a classic one that I can t find on their online menu but was spicy and had tequila  grapefruit  and a few other things. I would recommend both  if only I could remember the name of the second one     We also got the ceviche botana and a taco special with beef. I was less of a fan of the ceviche  it was sweeter than I typically like. I will get something else the next time I m here. My so got the tacos and he was over the moon. So I think I may need to go with tacos next time 
Licha's Cantina,233,So here I am entering Texas Autobahn  TXHwy 130  on the southern section through IH10   trying to reach a certain destination at a certain time to be at a certain place    Not going to happen    its under construction    seriously    puts a damper on my plans no way of  Goin  a million miles an hour headed out to where the down boys go    Austin   after checking in my hotel  reached E. 6th street and its jumping   seems happy hour is in full swing everywhere   parking seems to be a nightmare   but somehow someone up stairs is looking out for me   Licha s Cantina   just a couple of parking spot ahead  an open spot with a Guardian Angel standing right outside     You can have my parking ticket   its good till 9 05pm    Wonderful    Reach the gates and I see it busy  parties outside either waiting or on their way out  Idk   make our way through the crowd up the stairs  could not read the steps    porch  Welcome sign  pass the threshold  then it hits me   mumble  I m at one of my aunts house in Mexico    put together one section at a time  nothing matches  pictures on the wall  Its humble   and that what counts    Ma tre D   nicely greeted and friendly    One hour and thirty minutes   okay  so put us on the list  had planed to go somewhere else  that was going to change  so informed we could wait outside or by the bar  which was packed  happy hour   or also in the back was a porch with a bar    porch and back and bar  sounds good   make our way to the back and as in the front busy and crowded  what seemed to be college kids and maybe bridal showers  girls all in different wigs  interesting    so we sardine ourselves into two open spots by the bar   Time to play  Loteria  as we did in my aunts house   reason for me saying that  the cocktail drinks had that sound to them  we started with El Vampiro  this one I liked spicy     La Paloma  I could taste the grapefruit pop    then  La Mula  yes the ginger taste to it    La Bonita  rice milk  Horchata    smooth creamy very good    and ended with Margaritas    Great Bartender    very friendly and easy going   by now are pager went off and are table was ready   good thing  cuase the drinks were strong   was to early to call it a night   Make our way to our table for two   under the watchful eyes of Cantinflas and Blue Demon and El Santo     coincidence   that s another story    Waitress very friendly and attentive to all our needs    so we get the chips and salsa    red and green  the red very good    Starter  Choriqueso    Very delicious    Main Course Sopecitos de Lengua  very good also  but did need more salt   Enmoladas de Pato  very delicious and the mole very thick  I really liked this dish      So in end  wonderful start to a long night  had to get moving cause other thing to do and see    will be back   hopefully in less of a hurry    
Licha's Cantina,234,We had dinner here late last night with two beverages. She had the Huaraches Champinion  like Mexican pizza   that was 5 5  fantastico  I had the Sopecito and it was little dry on the chicken  though tasty 4 5.  The service was very attentive  and pleasant. We d recommend visiting this friendly atmosphere. Tip  the salsa is really spicy.
Licha's Cantina,235,While in Austin  I must say that it s  difficult selecting one Mexican joint among the seemingly endless cantinas  tamale houses  food trucks  Mexican cafes  etc etc. We settled on this place because it had strong reviews on Yelp and the menu looked especially creative. We were not disappointed    It s located in a charming little house. We were greeted by a very personable and knowledgable staff. Our server was especially friendly and offered great suggestions for cocktails. The menu is indeed creative and incredibly enticing. I ordered the braised mole duck. It was outstanding  The mole was on-point  the duck was perfectly braised  and the dish contained the perfect accompaniment of side items  from pico to guacamole to wedged citrus. All together  it was awesome. The cocktails are excellent too.   If you re looking for inventive  delicious Mexican fare with excellent service  this place is worth checking out.   Highly recommended 
Licha's Cantina,236,Loved this place  Cute ambiance  their salsas were delicious and I always say you know if the food is going to taste good based on the salsa lol. I ordered their happy hour cochinita pibil sopes. Yum  Also  I m from LA so I m picky about my micheladas but mine was perfect   Also my check was only  12   Amazing. I highly recommend you check this place out.
Licha's Cantina,237,Fantastic food - great service and an excellent fun interior.  The tacos and enchiladas were really authentic
Licha's Cantina,238,We come here for great happy hour drinks and authentic Mexican food. Lingua  bone marrow to die for. The food is amazing. The salsa they bring is perfect mix of spicy and sweet and Smokey so dip them together.
Licha's Cantina,239,What a fun experience  We had a couple of the Paloma margaritas  delicious   the mushroom huarache was sooo good  This is such a fun place with excellent food  Their happy hour is great 
Licha's Cantina,240,Best Mexican I ve ever had  Literally- the best. Will be dreaming of the carnitas and masa for days. Authentic  delicious food served by a great staff in a wonderful setting. Can t wait to come back. Very impressed  
Licha's Cantina,241,After so many bad meals and or service  in Austin this was a breath of fresh air. The menu is very unique with a wide variety of interior Mexican dishes. The wait for a table was long but well worth it.  Our server was well versed and attentive. They also have a variety of unique cocktails. The huarahes were tender and the wide use of nopalitos in the meals was a great touch  My wife and I will definitely be back. Next time  cabrito 
Licha's Cantina,242,Oh my god  the ceviche is to die for  Loved this adorable eclectic place  close in  great margaritas  delicious food and attentive wait staff and management. Can t say enough good things.
Licha's Cantina,243,Great  AUTHENTIC  Mexican food. Its all made fresh. Ive been looking for a good Mexican restaurant here in Austin and this is definitely made my top 3 list.   AMAZING micheladas  make sure to try them 
Licha's Cantina,244,The green salsa is the bomb  So good. Service was great. We sat at the bar. I liked the food. It was different. It had a nice twist to it. This place was very busy when we got there  but cleared out as the night went on. The only thing was weird was the tequila shot I had was very bad tasting to me and I didn t drink it. I told them I didn t care for it which is why I wasn t drinking it. Then  one of the guys behind the bar drank it. I guess it kinda weirded me out that someone drank the rest of a shot that I took but maybe he just didn t want the alcohol to go to waste.
Licha's Cantina,245,Mediocre food  too pricey for lunch. And not a family friendly place. The place is old and dark inside  and outside the tent is cold and  dirt  floor.  Not impressed despite all the.good reviews on yelp.
Licha's Cantina,246,Highly recommended.  Been here a number of times  always a pleasure.  Drinks are expertly made  food has love in it.  Romantic atmosphere and location is in the heart of east austin nightlife.
Licha's Cantina,247,Great choice of beer and cocktails. Red AND green salsa are the bomb.  Great atmosphere  sit at the bar and watch the bartenders work and the cooks work on that pastor taco.
Licha's Cantina,248,My boyfriend and I visited Licha s for the first time ever this week. We went on Saturday night so the wait time was 1.5 hours  which we didn t mind. We ordered a Margarita and a Paloma at the bar that s located in the back - they were terrible  this is why I can t give 5 stars .   We contemplated leaving but decided to stick around considering we d already been waiting for 30 minutes. We also decided to stick around because we were enjoying the atmosphere of the restaurant and the Cumbias were on point.   Luckily we ended up snagging two seats at the front bar  I think that s the only bar of the two that serves food . We first ordered two more drinks - the Lupita and the Fresa and they were AMAZING. The two bartenders working that night were super friendly and very attentive. We ended up ordering the Ceviche  Enchiladas and the Cochinita Pibil. Everything was delicious  especially the Enchiladas Potosina.   At the end of the night  we were very happy with our decision to stick around. The venue was hot and doesn t appear to have AC  but that wasn t a problem for us because everything else was pretty much great. We ll definitely have to go back soon and will be telling our friends about Licha s.
Licha's Cantina,249,Seriously good  authentic  reasonably-priced Mexican food in a super cute atmosphere  What more could you want   The vibe of this place is laid back fun - we were there on a Friday night and they had a mariachi band playing on the patio. Definitely recommend Licha s  Hands down some of the best Mexican food in the city.
Licha's Cantina,250,Happy Hour prices are good  but food and drinks are average. I ordered a margarita which didn t have enough salt on the rim and wasn t mixed properly  resulting in me taking a huge sip of tequila on first taste. I ordered the Calabazitas  squash  Quesadillas and it was flavorless...literally a hunk of cheese  6 pieces of squash  and tomatoes   in a tortilla. Won t come back again 
Licha's Cantina,251,Our dinner at Licha s Cantina was just okay. We arrived on a Saturday night and parked on the street a little down from the restaurant. Street parking in this part of Sixth Street is  2 for two hours  which is a darn good deal. But at that time of the night the area felt a little seedy. Not too terrible  just so that we made sure our car was locked before we left it alone.   The restaurant itself is adorable  in a little old house with lots of cheery music pouring out and plenty of people on the patio and eating in the tent on the side of the house. We asked for a table inside since it was starting to get chilly at that point  and they sat us in the back directly under a speaker  so we had trouble hearing each other even though we were near one another. Chips and salsa were complimentary  which was lovely  and while the salsa was a little too spicy for my taste  my boyfriend loved it. To start out  we ordered the guacamole  and this was the first disappointment. The menu said the guacamole was  6  so I assumed we would get a healthy portion. Instead  we were given two very small scoops in a tiny little dish  sprinkled with pumpkin seeds and cheese. It was barely enough for the both of us.   For our entrees  I ordered the vegetarian tacos and my boyfriend ordered the lengua tacos. Both entrees were just all right. The tacos are served fajita style  with the filling coming to you in a cast iron pan and the tortillas wrapped in foil and served on the side  so you have to build the taco yourself. The vegetarian taco filling was sweet potatoes  mushrooms  corn  cabbage and pumpkin seeds. Very unique  but tough to get the big chunks of sweet potato into the tiny tortillas. The lengua tacos were okay  very fatty but definitely flavorful. If you re a cow tongue fan  you will probably enjoy them.   Overall  we left feeling a little greasy and dissatisfied. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things.
Licha's Cantina,252,Overall good experience here. It was worth the 30 minute wait  The location is adorable and the patio is the perfect location to enjoy your meal. Beautiful decor inside and outside on the patio.   The food was really good. Complimentary salsa  spicy and mild  and chips. I ordered the alambre tacos  wagyu skirt steak  BACON  queso  onions  and peppers . The bacon added flavor to the tacos. You do have to put your tacos together and 2 corn tortillas is not enough  but you can order more  I also recommend the horchata aqua fresca.   Knocked off one star for small food portions. Honestly I expected a little more food for what I paid   .   16 for 2-3 tacos      Service was outstanding. I will be back next time I m in Austin 
Licha's Cantina,253,Real  authentic Mexican food in Texas. It s such a treat.   The Mole Poblano is one of the best I ever had in any restaurant. Try it with the duck. It s huge serving but every bite is mouth watering.   Great selection of wine  beer and first class cocktails are served at the bar.   It s in a small  old cottage and has a real intimate family feel. Early spring nights out on the porch are dreamy.   We ll keep coming back for more 
Licha's Cantina,254,Licha s Cantina is super cute    We were in town for a long weekend and were looking for some Mexican food.   We came for happy hour on Thursday evening and ordered the Calabazitas and the Mole Con Pollo. Both were very good. The chicken tinga on the mole dish was excellent and I loved the flavor of the mole. The crema on the Calabazitas was excellent. We also ordered happy hour margaritas that were the perfect sizes and very good. We loved the fresh salsas and chips and the guacamole was great.   We will be back for sure 
Licha's Cantina,255,I really wanted to love this place as it s such a quirky old home with interesting art scattered about  but I was seated in an area that the floor was so soft and old I really thought I would fall through the floor. We started with margaritas which we enjoyed as you could taste the tequila and they were not too sweet. We had the vegetarian queso with mushrooms and served with yummy tortillas. It was wonderful. But the entrees were not good or flavorful. Weird blue mesa stuffed with black beans which was as tough as shoe leather  one with a cactus salad and one with shrimp. The cactus salad was meh and the shrimp while cooked perfectly was on a weird way too sweet mole sauce. Also  service was so so slow.
Licha's Cantina,256,I came here for dinner when I was in Austin. First off  this place was super crowded so there was definitely a wait. My friends and I ordered a few spicy margs and sat on the patio for a bit until a table was ready for us.   Luckily  the patio was huge so there was plenty of seating outside. The menu was much more authentic which was nice. I ordered the cochinita pibil tlacoyos and it was delicious. The masa was slightly crispy on the outside and definitely soft in the middle. The filling was delicious. The braised pork was tender and so flavorful. The pickled onions  avocado salsa  and cheese definitely lightened up the dish a bit.   Overall  this place was good. I d definitely come back when I m in town 
Licha's Cantina,257,I hate to write this review because it seemed so promising  but I left so incredibly disappointed.   We arrived at 6pm on a random Thursday  so I didn t expect there to be a wait whatsoever... I was incorrect. There was a 25 minute wait when we arrived  so we took a buzzer and sat at the bar for a drink. I ordered the watermelon margarita and my husband had the regular house margarita. He liked his  mine was just okay. I should ve listened to my gut instinct when the chips and salsa came.. the chips had the texture and taste of store bought. The red sauce was mild with not much flavor  and the green sauce was spicy  but again  not much flavor. Still  we persevered on...  After about 45 minutes I mention that it seems like it s been a bit longer than what they told us  but we keep waiting. Finally  a hostess comes up to us and says our table is ready and apologized that our buzzer battery must ve died. So the table had been ready  we just didn t know about it and nobody mentioned it until much after the fact.   We were seated in the dining area and immediately noticed how hot and stagnant the air was.. it was much hotter than the bar area. I mentioned to the waiter that came to ask if we wanted a cocktail about the heat  but he said the fans weren t working.. it would ve taken much more than fans to be honest. It felt like the AC wasn t working.  Being that it was our first time here  and first time to a legit Mexican restaurant instead of tex-mex  we didn t know what much of the items were. My husband decided to get the Alambre tacos  which he enjoyed  they gave a ton of meat despite it looking like very little.  I ordered the Campote appetizer as an entree  as I wasn t starving  and asked the waiter how big the dish was  indicating I had never ordered it before . Our waiter was extremely unhelpful and didn t really give our table much attention. He never asked if we had questions over the menu or tried to explain anything to us. The campote looked like what would be maybe a savory sweet potato dish  but alas  it was cloyingly sweet.. almost like a dessert. It tasted good  it just was not at all what I would ve expected for an appetizer or entree. I left very disappointed unfortunately and would not return. Between the sheer heat of being inside this small building  to the service not being on point  it s not worth the wait or money.
Licha's Cantina,258,I finally was able to try this place out and I was very happy with everything. I love the vibe it carried  the cocktails and their food is tasty  I only tried their chicken tinga sopecitos  regardless they were good  
Licha's Cantina,259,Cool  amp  eclectic restaurant with great food   I ve passed by this place numerous times and it always seems busy. I was in the area recently and was able to try it out. I have to say  I can see why this place is so popular.  The food was very tasty and was pretty different from traditional Mexican cuisine you re probably used to seeing and eating. I had the Chorizo  amp  Papa Pambazo. If you like gorditas  papas  and chorizo  then you re going to like this dish. I ve never had or even heard of. Pambazo before but I took a chance on it and I m glad I did. I would definitely get this dish again.  For those of you looking for Mollejas and Tacos de Lengua....you re in luck  They serve both here. I m looking forward to trying both for sure   As for the restaurant itself...the inside is cozy and intimate. Kinda feels like eating in a relative s dining room. Good relaxing environment. The outside has a bit of a  fiesta  vibe. Music is turned up a bit  waiters dancing  people slamming down drinks. To me this restaurant has the best of both worlds  cozy inside and party-like outside.   Good place for drinks  a bite for lunch  or to grab dinner before bar hopping.
Licha's Cantina,260,My friend dragged me here and warned me that the food was just OK. She was not lying. I don t really know why people come here. The food is mediocre and the drinks are the same. When we first ordered our water our non-waiter slammed our drinks down and kind of chunked our chips on the table. I guess I should ve known from that point that was going to be a warning sign. I got the Mula which was bland and my friend said the same about hers. The food was lukewarm. So many better places in Austin.
Licha's Cantina,261,Great menu options to choose from along with great taste  My husband doesn t particularly like Mexican food  but he will eat it  and he thoroughly enjoyed this place  We will return on another visit
Licha's Cantina,262,Anniversary dinner  Found this place on yelp and was eager to try. Great authentic local experience   Loved the atmosphere -indoor outdoor options. Although it s very hot. If the heat bothers you go later in the evening when the suns setting.   Friendly quick service. Seemed like you couldn t go wrong ordering. I kept watching dishes come out and I wanted to everything. Fresh gauc is a must.   My only upset note is since I m pregnant I was unable to try a margarita    I m a lover of margaritas and they looked amazing. If you give this place a try please let me know how delicious they are. Sigh.  They do not take reservations and they are a popular spot so expect a pretty hefty wait time.
Licha's Cantina,263,My tummy hurts  The service here was great  Our waitress was very consistent in making sure that we were taken care of.   We got a bunch of stuff from the bar for happy hour as well as a couple entrees.  I honestly think this place is a hit or miss. My friends were very happy about all the food. As for me  it was too crazy. I couldn t even tell if some of the food I had was Mexican food. A lot of the things tasted... Interesting  but it was worth trying.   It can get pretty pricy if you order a lot of stuff here  so make sure you know what you want 
Licha's Cantina,264,Very rude  The only thing good about this place was the food  which is sad because as much as I would love to go back I would not want to experience such rude behavior again.   I went during happy hour and I was very happy with the prices and the choices available.  I ordered the mole con pollo which is this medium sized dish on a corn patty and it was amazing. The table also ordered a margertia pitcher and a bucket of beers  which I though was on the pricey side for happy hour but they where on point  Super tasty and the margarita served up to 6 people  mediumish cups    They have really great music  outside seating with seating in the back and nice lighting.   Ok the bad stuff and why I gave them 2 stars. I went with a party of 6 and we arrived at separate times I told the waitress we would wait to order until the party arrived  however I don t know if she was really forgetful or what but she came back every 5 mins asking if we where ready to order what we wanted  etc  etc. And when the party did come she hurried over and did the same thing we all said no  GEEZ CHILL OUT WOMEN   we just wanted to chill and drink and order whenever  but clearly this waitress was on a schedule and wanted us in and out on her time.   So after the whole are you ready are you ready  and are you done  are you done  we finally decided to get the check. I did tell you we came on happy hour right  well apparently this waitress forgot that fact and charged us for regular priced items and when we told her she said no you didn t order that and added well you ate it   I could not believe my day I was having with this rude person and on top of that another waitress had to chime in and add your stretching the truth. REALLY  Not only that she couldn t even split our check  she had us do the math and circle  draw arrows and write names for who s order went with who s card. I could not believe any of this was happening to me.  As I left the waitress yelled have a good day  thanks for coming  come back again    I will definitely not be coming back again.
Licha's Cantina,265,Summary    I travel to Austin frequently for work.  In every city that I travel to regularly  I ve been trying to establish a go-to taco and tequila joint.  This is my Austin go-to.  Ease of Entry  I ve never had to wait  luckily.  That may be because I ve only been here by myself and have sat at the bar.  Atmosphere  In an authentic Mexican joint  you can t get any better than this.  Cute front porch and outdoor seating.  Awesome authentic interior with many well-thought touches that you have to take the time to notice and appreciate.  Beautiful back patio.  Service  I ve had the same bartender every time I ve been there.  I m not sure what his name is  but he kind of looks like Dax Shepherd...can t be too many of them that work there.  Each time  I have been promptly offered complimentary chips and salsa  2 types of salsa mind you .  The first time I was there  he offered a drink on the house and most recently he squeezed my last drink in for the happy hour prices  even though it was a few minutes past.  It s the little things like these instances that help differentiate between establishments.  The way that I was treated each time that I have come to Licha s leaves me with no desire to try any other Mexican place in Austin.     Food  The most recent time I ate  I got the Alambre tacos.  I was pleasantly surprised by the way you are served these tacos.  They are served in a skillet  where you create your own tacos with the tortillas that are kept in a warmer.  In other words  they are served fajita-style.  I tried the Alambre and it was delicious and filling.    Drink  I have tried every tequila and mezcal cocktail on the menu. Everyone of them is delicious.  My recomendation is to ask for a Spicy Margarita.  I think it s a buck or two more  but well worth it.  I also love the fact that they serve  La Mula  which is a mezcal version of the moscow mule - and they come in great cups.  This is my favorite drink to make at home  and I ve never seen these served in a bar before.   They also have an amazing selection of mezcals and tequilas if your a feeling up to trying some things.   Value  The  5 drinks at happy hour doesn t get much better anywhere in the country and probably the best value in Austin.
Licha's Cantina,266,I came here with 7 other people  bachelor s party  so we were all pretty hungover   and this place was our saving grace. Such a special Tex-Mex place on East 6th  It s an old house that s been re-purposed to serve brilliant food to a bunch of hungry peeps. The servers are all really nice  and the food is delectable. I highly recommend the ceviche and shrimp tacos   
Licha's Cantina,267,We loved this place for brunch  The service was excellent our waitress was amazing.  Food took a little long but we went for Sunday brunch and showed up at 130.  They closed at 3 and they stayed open for lots of people to finish serving and I never felt rushed. The service topped it for me. The food  was bizarre. It s SO good I had the chicken quesadillas with eggs on top and I was in heaven. I m not big on Mexican brunch food but this combined the cuisine and time of day really well  I posted pics of what my friends got and all was just beautiful and there were zero food complaints. The watermelon margarita basically made my week  although I will say don t have more than 2
Licha's Cantina,268,When a place has a no reservations policy  it s usually really good. Licha s proves this point  The place is super cool  its an old house that s been converted to a restaurant.  The drinks were awesome  The food was AMAZING  This was not the basic Mexican place. There were some unexpected dishes that were really good. It has a very cool Austin vibe  that makes it not agonizing to wait for your table. I am coming back here frequently 
Licha's Cantina,269,this place was really cute. had a nice authentic austin hipster vibe. good prices and drinks. reason why i give it 4 is because they could have done a little better with the food. like topping it off with sauce or something.
Licha's Cantina,270,GREAT happy hour  From 3-7pm daily  Licha s offers a heavily discounted happy hour with various drinks and small plates for  5 each.  The complimentary chips were accompanied by two unique  good salsas. Both were creamy  one red and one green  both delicious.  I ordered the Margarita  and when I vocalized that I would like a spicy salt rim they also offered to crush jalapenos in it. Now that s some service after my own heart   We ordered 3 plates to share amongst 2 ladies which was plenty  GRINGA QUESADILLA - came with two good-sized pieces and a side of guacamole and grilled pineapple  with green and white sauce drizzled on top. There wasn t much spice to it  but dipping it in the salsas that came with the chips added a lot of flavor. The pastor meat was very tender and the pineapple was a nice touch.  CHAMPINON HUARACHE  flatbread  - highly recommend this  the combination of cheeses was good  and I loved the variation of the corn  almost sope-like  flatbread as an alternative to a normal tostada shell. It resembled a lot like a pizza.  CAMOTE - unexpected from a Mexican-type restaurant  and extremely good. Not sure what sauce was drizzled on it but it was light and good  and the sweet potatoes were cooked nice and soft. Goat cheese   pumpkin seeds were delicious touch.  We sat outside and because it is winter  the patio was covered and there were heaters. It happened to actually be a really nice night out but we were thankful for these and it still didn t ruin the patio ambience. Service was good although our busser did not know much about the menu and did not seem to care to help us figure it out  but our waitress more than made up for it.  Happy hour  sit on the patio  order the margarita and request jalapenos in it. You won t be disappointed.
Licha's Cantina,271,Been to this restaurant twice this year. Went for birthday dinner with mother. Food is always amazing  very authentic and flavorful. Amazing drinks as well. I typically get the watermelon infused jalape o margarita  With a chili rim  So good    The wait is long even on a Thursday night at 6 30.. I believe we waited 45 mins. Great service  so I d say it s worth the wait   
Licha's Cantina,272,I was recommended by a local to visit Licha s Cantina. I ordered the Enchiladas  replaced the pork with chicken  and ordered a side of rice  which was way too much . If you order the Enchilada  stick to just that order  I could have shared with another person. It was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this place. Love the feel. I felt like I was walking into my long lost Mexican abuela s antique house - the lit velones on my way up the stairs  loves 
Licha's Cantina,273,Have eaten here so many times  and enjoyed it every time   First off  they have great guacamole. It tastes great on everything that they have. I also love their salads. I have enjoyed the cochinita pinup which is so savory and delicious. The pork is really tender  and I especially loved it when it was with the sopecito. Recently  I have had the al pastor tacos and the alambre tacos. The meat for both were so tender  and I love the sweetness of the fresh pineapple with the pork in the pastor. The pork was also so crispy and crunchy  while still being so tender. Their margaritas are also really great  A great neighborhood spot to visit with friends 
Licha's Cantina,274,Awesome place  Great customer service  also great food  amp  drinks    Happy hour from 4pm-6pm
Licha's Cantina,275,One of our favorite restaurants to go to on the east side - great authentic mexican food  friendly service and they have a great happy hour too 
Licha's Cantina,276,Good for happy hour  5 dollar margs and with you two sopaetas  sorry on the spelling- they are basically English muffins with meat on top  they were good and filling. Cute outdoor seating.
Licha's Cantina,277,I m pretty obsessed with this place - from the adorable table decorations  to the fabulous outdoor patio  to the yummy drinks  to the location  to their savory authentic Mexican dishes  to their remarkable HH menu.   What I recommend   --Their HH - their menu is filled with delicious dishes   signature cocktails for  5 from 4-7P.  --Love sweet potatoes  Get the Camonte  - sweet potato  goat cheese  pumpkin seeds  amp  a yummy glaze.  -Their version of a Moscow Mule - only theirs has a spicy rim  amp  made with Mezcal.  --Their quesadilla - any of them   I think this place is just great  amp  I personally think it s a wonderful place for a large party or for a quaint date night.
Licha's Cantina,278,Menu said Nega Modelo was  5 but got charged  7. Appetizers are  15. This place is good example of gentrification gone wild.
Licha's Cantina,279,4.5 STARS         This was quite a fine from YELP  in Austin  Texas. This is not your traditional taco  burritos  re fried bean Mexican food.     We were early  like B4 they were open  early   so we sitting at one of the tables on the front porch  amp  the server came out early offered us water then later Margaritas.      The menu features many options cooked in clay pots    we had the roasted mushroom  amp  cheese which was OUTTA SITE   amp  served with warm pita wedges.   Also a sweet potato dish with pumpkin seeds and a creamy sauce. Very different but good. It was served cool  which surprised me. I ordered the dang thing and Must have overlooked that  it was good  a large portion  might have been better suited towards the end of the meal. We had a quesadilla like thing  Epozda   Also quite good with the blue corn tortillas  amp  Mexican herbs alongside Guacamole  amp  chips.     I am a dessert girl and the Flan was TOP NOTCH as was the cappuccino.      I must give a shout out to our servers he was extremely knowledgable about the menu  explained everything  didn t seem irrated as we were trying to avoid meat dishes do to Lent. JUST EXCELLENT  I wish I could remember her name  DAMN 
Licha's Cantina,280,This place was really cute  Mexico City plates vibes  lots of outdoor seating as well as inside seating for such a small place. Really enjoyed how every busboy was on the lookout to clear tables  bring your food  etc. the staff was great  Also loved how chips and salsa were already on the table once we sat down. The chips were great  Thin and crispy. Drinks were good too. Definitely recommend this place if you re looking for a little swanky place to eat.
Licha's Cantina,281,Yum yum yum     We waited an hour to be seated here  but wandered over to Wright Bros. Brew  amp  Brew to imbibe while we waited   but it was worth it.  Toasty chips and two sauces to munch on while we ordered traditional homemade Mexican food.    I had a skillet with tangerine chicken and my husband got a steak skillet thing.  He asked for bacon on the side  but they did end up putting some of it in his meal.  The decor of the restaurant is very cool and the bar was impressive.  It s a bit expensive but I would love to try it again 
Licha's Cantina,282,Went here for brunch. ACL going on in Austin  so it was loud and busy and actually quite annoying to try to get a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. Once seated the food was very good.
Licha's Cantina,283,Cool kitchen on East 6th.  We parked on the street for free after making one lap around the block.  The hostess meets you as soon as you walk through the front gate.  The seating was mostly outdoors and we sat in the back patio after walking through the retrofitted house.    The lighting outside was great and made you feel like you were eating in someone s backyard.    The waiter was nice  but not overly helpful considering the food here is a very different type of authentic Mexican.    They brought out chips and two types of salsa.  One was a traditional green sauce  which was spicy and creamy.  The other was a citrus tomato flavored salsa.  Both were excellent.    I ordered the Maria Huraches which was a corn based flatbread topped with chimichurri  queso asafetida  pico de gallo  and queso fresco.  Very tasty and looked like something you would get as street food in Mexico City.    Also got the esquite which was a warm grilled corn bowl with queso fresco and lime.    Great spot for a nice meal with friends.
Licha's Cantina,284,I don t give many 5-star reviews but this place was absolutely delicious.   The design is very cute with a lot of outdoor seating. A great place for a full meal or to just to have drinks. Most of the items on their menu seem like they can double as individual plates or plates to share.   I got one of the quesadillas there on a blue corn tortilla. If you have seen some of my other reviews  you know I order quesadillas quite often and this one was quite special. Their food is very clean and not greasy.   The service was also spot on  the waiter checked on us just enough  and always kept water glasses full.   I would return time and time again  I am excited to try more of their menu.
Licha's Cantina,285,Ask for Chase. The Seinfeld of bartenders.   Comedians in Cantinas getting Cocktails.
Licha's Cantina,286,Love me some Licha s. Whether you are sitting in the backyard patio on wooden stools  admiring the artwork and sipping their smoky  mezcal based  5  La Mula  or in the candlelit interiors enjoying some chips  salsa  and spread of menu items  you are in for a fantastic evening.  I came for the first time shortly after they opened and a large group of us sat out in the front yard area at a long table. It s great for groups but there is plenty of more intimate seating indoors. I tried the Camote on my first visit. HIGHLY recommend it  A sweet potato stuffed with goat cheese  pepitas  a delectable sauce and garnished with cilantro- it s fresh  spicy  innovative  and seemingly healthy. My friends split some of their platos  which are generous and evidently delicious given the lack of leftovers. Plus  they have unique combinations such as quail or duck.  I ve also tried the Champinon Huaraches  which is a corn flat bread topped with earthy mushrooms  peanut sauce  and oozing with cheese. It s a delicious mix of flavors  ingredients  and textures and unlike what you will find many places. Finish your evening off with their house margarita or paloma  only  5 during HH  and you ve got it made.   Tasty. Authentic. Affordable. An Austin stand-out.
Licha's Cantina,287,Always one of my favorites  This place is really good interior Mexican food  I LOVE their tacos  You can t go wrong with any of them  and I always have leftovers.  Margaritas are nice and strong  and the salsas are delicious  Great spot to bring people visiting  or for a tasty lunch or dinner.
Licha's Cantina,288,Amazing cocktails and service. Highly recommend. The mezcal martini and the Bonita were both fantastic cocktails. Chips and salsa were A  as well.
Licha's Cantina,289,HAPPY HOUR REVIEW   4 00 p.m. to 7 00 p.m.   I met two friends here and until my friend suggested it  I didn t know this restaurant was there   It s a home converted into a restaurant.  The parking is a bit difficult because you have to find a street spot.  Walking up and seeing the lights and the outdoor seating in front is almost magical.  It really has a magical vibe to it.  The hostess greeted me as soon as I walked in and the staff was welcoming and smiling.  I opted for us to sit inside because it was chilly.  The restaurant is not very big at all and boasts a small bar to one side.  They have a good amount of  5.00 cocktails and  5.00 plates to choose from at happy hour.  I opted for their traditional margarita on the rocks with salt.  It was perfect and I really liked that it was made with Tequila Silver.  The flat bread type dish that I ordered  I can t remember the name  was covered in a generous portion of meat  cheeses  etc.  I loved how cheesy it was and it was spicy.  The type of spicy that catches up with you more and more after every bite.  It does help you drink your margarita a bit faster so  I can t complain.  The bathrooms were interesting because they were super small and the sink to wash your hands is located in the hallway.  This is a good spot to stay a while  grab your friends  share some plates and drink some margaritas 
Licha's Cantina,290,Amazing  Great atmosphere  great food  great service. Miguel was the waiter of me and 8 of my friends. He let us in on his favorite food  amp  drinks. We even split the check and he took care of that gladly. The food got out so quick and was delicious. True  genuine cuisine. Enjoy this place 
Licha's Cantina,291,Where are the jalapeno watermelon margaritas       Well  turns out their seasonal and this was the main reason I came here. I read in a few places of how great this margarita is and I did not get a chance to try it.. boo.. But I did try their Jalapeno Lime margarita. To be honest it could have used more jalapeno. Putting a slice of jalapeno in a margarita does not really add anything. The jalapeno needs to be infused into either the tequila or the lime juice.   Regardless  I do like this place. Casual atmosphere and welcoming service. I didn t try anything to eat other then their complimentary chips and salsa. Loved their green salsa that was served. I could have eaten that all day. very addictive.
Licha's Cantina,292,Came here for happy hour on a Friday evening with some friends. After looking over the HH drink menu  we had to try it. I got one margarita  try it with a chile rim instead of salt   and the Bonita which is an alcoholic horchata  cinnamon rice milk . My guy friend got 2 rounds of their mexican mule. All drinks were strong and delicious   For food  we got street corn for the table and it was SO YUMMY. Reminded me of the street corn I would get in Mexico. Flavorful and filling.  The only weird thing is that eventually  we stopped being checked on. We would see our waitress and she was wonderful and attentive but after our 2nd round of drinks she stopped coming by and didn t offer another round...it was kind of odd.  Overall  yummy food and strong tasty drinks 
Licha's Cantina,293,Stopped in here yesterday while in the area for a snack. All in all  it was a solid stop with a couple of spicy margaritas and shared guacamole and Esquite. The green salsa was my favorite of the ones they brought to the table. We had to ask for chip refills a couple of times and our second drink was a little slow to come to the table. This is an authentic spot and wouldn t mind returning for more than a snack in the future if I were in the area.
Licha's Cantina,294,Love this place  Food is so good  drinks are perfect  I d add more drinks to the menu  has mariachi so made it nicer. We had to wait around 30 min but were at the patio enjoying some drinks
Licha's Cantina,295,When I walked up to Licha s I remember coming to a house party at this very spot back in the 90s. Everything around it is gentrified but I m happy that the proprietors have kept the house in tact and turned it into a great Mexican restaurant. It looks tiny on the inside but it s really more cozy and there is a huge backyard patio for more space. Staff and service were top notch as were the drinks. We ordered the Mole and the Alambre plate along with a side of Licha s guacamole. I am a Mole snob. I order Mole where ever it is offered and compare it to my abuelita s. Licha s was a perfect combination of chiles  cumin seeds  peanuts  and chocolate poured over a pan fried chicken breast. The plate came with grilled calabazas and white rice. The alambre was a taste explosion of grilled beef and veggies served with corn tortillas. Licha s has much more to offer. It s not Tex-Mex but more traditional interior Mexican food that everyone should try.
Licha's Cantina,296,This was my first time at Licha s cantina and it was a great experience. We went for happy hour and were told there would be a wait. After about 2 minutes they called us and we were seated -  We had happy hour drinks that were cheap and delicious  not to mention strong. We ordered a quesadilla  huarache  and a sopecito. Everything was gluten free and really tasty. The server was great and the inside of the restaurant is super unique and cool We will definitely be back again.
Licha's Cantina,297,Holy KAAAAPPOOOWWW  Batman  I loved the hell out of this place     Papi Tino s should be embarrassed  The service was stellar  The food was amazing  as were the drinks. We sampled the escargot  the ceviche  the al pastor tacos. All were wonderful and decently priced.  We also tried the Watermelon Jalape o Rita and their version of the Moscow Mule made with Mescal instead. BAM  BOOM  POW  Loved them....hard   The waitstaff was excellent      She suggested the way they should arrive for palate maximization. For real  She was correct    I would highly recommend the back patio for extra SHAZAAAMMM 
Licha's Cantina,298,Food was brilliant. I had a few house margaritas and the pork mango tacos.  This place is an must in Austin area. Take an uber Lyft or walk to this place   Stacy was our waitress and she was beyond friendly  knowledgeable  inviting.    DO NOT LET THE EXTERIOR FOOL YOU  This is a fresh and vibrant place to eat.   Owner Chef came out to welcome us and take care of any dietary issues.  The food is influenced from Mexico City  where the chef is from   the menu is full of flavorful bits that will leave you pleasantly full.
Licha's Cantina,299,Delicious. Went to dine in but place was a little too crowded for comfort so got the food to go. Glad we did  was amazing.
Licha's Cantina,300,This place is amazing. Cool old west kinda bar with an inviting patio. I had a Paloma to drink tequila  grapefruit  lime  very tasty  not too sweet. My entree was the best tho--potato and chorizo enchilada with guacamole. Yummmmmeeee  is portions. Hubby had a pork belly corn masa thing  also wonderful. You get lots of chips here too and wonderful smoky salsa  Go 
Licha's Cantina,301,Okay food  poor experience.   We were recommended to Lichas by a coworker who couldn t stop raving about them so we finally made it over for dinner. Such a cool  but very small  atmosphere in an old house. The back yard has a covered patio with a bar and a large table to wait at.   We tried the margaritas and while they were good  they weren t anything special. Small and weak for  11 ea.   Our buzzer went off and we headed to the hostess for our seats. We were seated right on the edge of a common walkway to the kitchen  with no doors  just across from where the chips and salsa are filled with lots of hustle and bustle all around us. Basically a service area. There was a large party at the table next to us and the guy at the end of their table was basically sitting at ours. The bench seat was high and the table was low. I m 6 2 and I felt like a sardine. The room was stuffy and heat was radiating from the kitchen just over my shoulder. We couldn t even hold a conversation.   We asked 2 different people if we could move to an open table in another room and were told simply  no. Sorry.  We asked our server and she said  if you want another table you re going to have to wait.  I could see an open table. I understand that restaurants have a certain order in how they seat people but this was just unfriendly. Sure didn t feel welcome.   I had the duck plate and she had the salad. While the duck was tender and the dishes were presented nicely  both lacked flavor. The only taste mine had was the sweetness of the mole but that s about it. Didn t finish it.   When asked if my wife wanted dessert  the answer was a defeated  no. I just want to get out of here.  We agreed.   I had been so excited to try Lichas for the last few weeks and now that I ve been  I don t think I ll be back based on just the customer service experience alone. The food didn t make it much better. In the car ride home she told me again how disappointed she was we went here and that it felt like a waste of money.   Lichas  in hospitality  your initial impression sets the tone for your guests experience. You really failed on this one. I d like to chalk this up as a one-time experience but I probably won t be giving them another chance.
Licha's Cantina,302,Highlights of this meal    Drinks  despite the  8 price tag on a cocktail  and the appetizers  despite the lack of seasoning on the guacamole.  Literally seemed like mashed avocado with a couple pumpkin seeds and a dash of queso fresco. Thankfully I love avocados so it was doable.   OTHERWISE   Licha s is in a cute little house that looks like your Abuela s  but there s Saint candles everywhere  Frida Kahlo on the wall  basically every little piece of what hipsters interpret Mexican culture as  but the food that came of Abuela s Cocina ended up tasting like it came from Memaw Claire s kitchen instead.   The food overall was flavorless. My parter s duck was overcooked  and was basically just bland duck meat smothered in mole that was only half good. Also the Concha Burger was not at all as exciting as it could ve been. It was full of meat and really nothing but that  no variety of texture because the only other ingredients to the burger was shredded lettuce and guacamole  and once again  wasn t seasoned well enough either. This restaurant lacks flair and spice  and they cover it up by making the place look more  Mexican .  Well  artwork on the walls and blaring tejano music can t fix your regular ass hipster food. Not going back.
Licha's Cantina,303,What a fun and funky place - and the food is fantastic. Definitely order their ceviche. It s the best I ve ever had. The guac is fresh and fantastic. We tried their  flatbread  on a masa crust and Pollo con Mole. The mole sauce is some of the best I ve ever had. Great service 
Licha's Cantina,304,I joined up with some friends here for Happy Hour one evening and you could tell this was a family run place.  And I mean that in the good Austin way.    The servers were kind  they checked on us frequently  talked with us  had fun with our group  some servers even knew Spanish and spoke Spanish back and forth with people in our group and the went right on speaking English to other members of our group.  Everyone felt included and taken care of.  It was incredibly relaxing and the drinks were excellent.  I have to come back and try the food 
Licha's Cantina,305,Fucking disgusting       I got food poising for two days from this place         I wish I could give this place zero stars      I should have known when the food was cold or the fly in my drink that was a sign.....  Not to mention the owner kept flirting w me  How unprofessional       I told him I had a boyfriend and he insisted on asking for my number and told me to bring my gfs around to make the bar  look good.   Disgusting pig  
Licha's Cantina,306,I ve been to this place before super cute and chill. I ordered the ceviche I was not the biggest fan I love ceviche but this was chewy and didn t taste fresh. I had two bites and I just couldn t eat it anymore.
Licha's Cantina,307,Outstanding service. From the manager to each and every person  we felt at home in this jewel in East Austin. The food was also outstanding- the smoked salmon is highly recommended. Fun  casual environment.
Licha's Cantina,308,I absolutely loved Licha s Cantina.  Need I say more   Okay  I ll say more.  We started out with an order of Tinga De Pollo and Cochinita Pibil Sopecitos.  We also grabbed a Guacamole order.  Oh My.  All were absolutely fantastic.  We had several margaritas with it and just called it a day with that as a light meal with wonderful drinks.   Then we came back.    The next day once our other couple joined up  we took them and went into the entree side of the menu.  They ordered assorted tacos and platos but I ventured out to the Huachinango Tikin Xic which is crazy spanish for OMG amazing Red Snapper YumYum.  If not everyone at your table it wanting to be adventurous with the menu  be the star of the table and order this wonderful dish.  Next time in Austin I ll swing back in for sure 
Licha's Cantina,309,Big fan of Lichas. I do what I can to send people that way when looking for Austin recs. The menu is creative and refreshing  and especially shines in an ocean of tex-mex.   Service is on point. My goal is to try everything on their menu  drinks included .
Licha's Cantina,310,Amazing queso fondido and margaritas  Felt safe sitting outside and great service. You so t be disappointed.
Licha's Cantina,311,The hostess was so rude to us  I wanted to leave immediately after putting our name down. She basically said  no but maybe  and  one hour to 1.5 hour wait  and rolled her eyes when we put our name down. I was livid  but we were meeting friends there and my boyfriend didn t want to change plans.  We get a drink outside while we wait - there are THREE open tables outside. They do not get filled for 30-45 minutes  and people only get seated there after I ask the hostess why we re waiting next to three open tables. Honestly  I think I reminded her that they existed.  Food and drinks were nothing special. You can find way better Mexican in Austin  although the location and atmosphere are nice.
Licha's Cantina,312,Super busy at 8pm on a week night. Instead of a 45 minute wait for a table  I found a seat at the bar. I couldn t decide between the tacos or gorditos and the bartender said she would order gorditos over tacos anytime. She was right  The masa tortillas were nice and crisp  loaded with carnitas  comes 2 in an order for  12.99. Perfect portion.
Licha's Cantina,313,I don t do many restraunt reviews but this Licha s Cantina I went to on Saturday night was everything. We waited maybe 30min for a table. The was actually fun because how lively the atmosphere is. I don t do salsa and normally take salting every chip but I never had to ask for a salt shaker cuz the homemade chips were the most perfect ones. Comparable to Pappasitos. Then the mole came out and I went to heaven and it s for sure my new go to Mexican.
Licha's Cantina,314,It was delicious   My husband had a gordita de carnitas and it was amazing  We both agree that it s the best Mexican food we have tried so far in Austin.  We are from Mexico so we know when something taste like the real thing  The portions are perfect. Costumer service was really good as well. We will definitely come back. Nice place to sit outside as well.
Licha's Cantina,315,Queso is so good  We came for Valentine s Day and didn t even have to wait  Awesome food and service  
Licha's Cantina,316,The food is delicious and the happy hour specials are amazing--but be forewarned that this place is very crowded. We showed up at 5 30 on a Friday and it was an hour wait for a table of 2. There just isn t much seating aside from the backyard area  which was closed for a private party. We expected it to be less crowded since it was relatively early  but I think that s exactly when everyone comes because of the great HH deals  which end at 6. There s no room to wait inside  so you have to wait outside  which is unideal in the heat. But  again--really great food  amp  tasty drinks  so I understand why it s so popular. Also  a lot of gluten free options that are clearly stated on the menu.
Licha's Cantina,317,I looveee the HH here  There s so many choices and it s such a great value. The most memorable thing I ate was the bone marrow hurache. Crispy  rich  and super filling. You really can t go wrong with anything on the HH menu though  especially since it s all  5 each.
Licha's Cantina,318,Love me some Licha s.    My first visit I was looking over the menu and a busser overheard me say  everything sounds great .  To which he replied  Get the burger  it ll change your life .   I chuckled thinking he was joking. Is there even a burger on the menue  We were at a Mexican place  why would I get a burger  Then I found it  Black angus hamburger patty cooked medium  tocinada  queso asadero  lettuce  guacamole  pico de gallo on a Concha bun  served with spicy potatoes.  Arguably the best burger I ve had in Austin.  It was excellent. Ceviche appetizer was great as well.   Licha s also has my favorite spicy margarita in town.   This is one of those go to spots I take out-of-towners to who want to experience a truly unique and great Austin restaurant.
Licha's Cantina,319,I m from San Antonio and this place feels like home. I love the homey feel of the restaurant and I m obsessed with the al pastor quesadilla. Can t wait to go back 
Licha's Cantina,320,I came out to East Austin to hit up some Happy Hours with Mark. This was a second stop. The first place we went to was so mediocre. When we walked in I was already excited. It s a small space but so cute and lots of details. We took a seat at the bar and looked over the menu.   We decided to come to this place because of the comments and reviews on Yelp. We were excited to start off with the Watermelon Jalapeno Margarita. We also ordered the Pastor Quesadilla. I loved that the tortilla was a little crunchy. THe pork was so flavorful. They also brought out some Chips with two types of salsa. The margarita was so refreshing with a little kick. I loved it  It went by quickly. For our second beverage we got the La Mula  Mezcal  Lime  Ginger Beer and Jugo Maggie . This was like a Moscow Mule but with Mezcal. This was so cold and refreshing. It was served in a cute metal mug.   Bartender was really nice. The seats at the bar started to get uncomfortable so as soon as we were satisfied with our food and beverage we were out. I took a trip the the ladies room before we left and I thought it was so cute  It was like a dimly lit outhouse but of course really clean and it had nice decorations. The sink is on the outside which is a community sink.   I just loved the way this place looked. It s converted house with so much character. There s outdoor seating which will be super handy and nice once we get cooler weather.
Licha's Cantina,321,We went to Licha s Cantina tonight  Friday   after having it recommended by a few people.  The restaurant was lively  busier than expected  and there was a 45 minute wait. Usually that means 20-30 minutes. But it ended up being 45  maybe 50 minutes. While waiting we got drinks. The margarita was just bad-- it tasted grungy. I ve made better cocktails in a 5 gallon water cooler with ingredients from CVS  in a state where they sell liquor in grocery stores . The Mezcal cocktail  la mula   was good  had nice balances going on. Normally we prefer tequila to Mezcal.  Once we were seated  our server s  worked to get out our chips and order  they seemed attentive. The watermelon tequila cocktail and the house tequila  I sipped on  were both great. The Choriqueso was pretty good  but the chorizo itself was meh. It was bland  and there wasn t much  just a patch near the center of the serving dish. Chorizo in Austin never  except once  has the normal light spice and flavor of a good chorizo like we re used to in CA and AZ.   Our food came out next  and with the initial wait and busy-ness of the place  we had our two hour parking expiring soon. In all of the recommendations from friends  the wait time or duration had never been mentioned. I don t think the service once we were seated was slow  but almost half our parking went to waiting for a table. At that point  I saw another guest who had arrived a few minutes after us talking to the manager about how they had not been seated yet-- they must have been waiting for 1.5 hours by then.   The food though. I got the lengua tacos and she got the Mole con pollo. The lengua looked more like pork belly  as it was thicker pieces and I couldn t see taste buds or tongue ridges anywhere. I tasted it and it had the nice feel and base flavor of lengua. The overall flavor wasn t what I was used to  but different can be fine. I enjoyed it overall-- their take on lengua was different  but appeased my craving for at least the night. She got what looked like a little odd pizza. The mole was spread thin over a tortilla with some chicken bits spread on top. Normally  we re used to a chicken breast smothered in mole. However  this dish had by her estimate less than half a breast of chicken on it and the mole had partially soaked into the base tortilla  rendering it un-scoopable. She didn t like her meal.   Overall  there was some good  some bad  and mostly shades of average. I think the service once we were seated helps get the rating to be a 3. We were not impressed with the food and didn t have an experience that warrants coming back or recommending it. But we didn t regret trying.
Licha's Cantina,322,Had a delicious brunch at Licha s   Saw the Yelp reviews and thought I d give it a try.  It s slightly off the beaten path  but well worth the trip.  Had the cochinita pibil quesadilla.  The made on premisses purple corn tortilla was perfect - a little bit thick with great texture  I know  al dente  is usually used for pasta  but it works here .  The cochinita pibil was juicy  porky heaven and everything else on it just made Mexican harmony in my mouth   Now to drink  I had the cafe de olla which was coffee with Mexican spices.  Soooooooo gooooooooood  even on a super hot  humid day   The reviews were right  this place is a little treasure.
Licha's Cantina,323,My friend and I were driving around Austin and wanted to find a good place to eat so we stumbled across this restaurant. At first we thought we were lost because from the outside it looks kind of deserted and sketchy. We were about to leave but eventually decided to stay and give it a try. I m glad we did because this place exceeded my expectations  food wise    We ordered queso with chorizo for an appetizer that came with hand made tortillas  He ordered sopes and some tacos and I ordered a quesadilla  We ended up spending  70  including drinks    It s a nice little place to go and relax with friends while having a cocktail  The food was pretty authentic and the atmosphere was social. The only reason why I gave this place a 3 and not a 4 was because there was no A C  Like we live in Texas and it was a good 100 degrees outside and there was no air conditioner inside. I was sweating and so was my friend. We couldn t finish our food comfortably because we were trying to get the heck out of there    Pretty much food was great   Atmosphere was okay   No A C is not acceptable 
Licha's Cantina,324,I found a gem at Licha s  The happy hour is a great deal with delicious  authentic Mexican food. I couldn t believe the quality for the price. The huaraches  quesadillas and sopecitas de lengua were the best I ve had in Austin so far. The margarita was perfect and refreshing. Get there right at 4 00 because it gets packed fast 
Licha's Cantina,325,Sat on porch for dinner one early evening  Had a blast - lovely setting and delish  cocktails ritas... mezcal
Licha's Cantina,326,Shortfall  the tortillas were on a frozen food level  and definitely ruined the tacos  queso fondito and meal overall. I mean they re shockingly low quality. If Licha s fixed this  I would be excited to return.   Beyond that  the food was surprisingly wonderful. Try the queso fondito  and the mole con pollo  basically fajita style tacos  - they come with abundant portion sizes and go great w ordering a side of beans.   Service  Extremely rude waitstaff  don t expect attention  plan on asking for things more than twice. Even when my friend told us the check was  68  the waitress rudely mumbled  69. Unnecessary  unprofessional and uncomfortable.
Licha's Cantina,327,I m giving lichas 5 stars because the food was amazing  Their house salsa is to die for. And their guacamole was divine  I had their al pastor tacos  amp  I absolutely loved all the flavors  They have Home made corn tortillas  YUMMM  only thing I didn t care for was their margaritas. But I also am picky when it comes to my margs so I m not faulting them on this. The food is everything  Must eat here if you visit Austin  
Licha's Cantina,328,This was a random pick from on a Saturday after a fun run. My friends and I were exhausted and hungry and wanted Mexican food and margaritas. The establishment is a little house  nice vibe and atmosphere. Staff was all very nice. Wait was about 45 minutes but well worth it  Food was delicious  I ordered a watermelon margarita and honestly didn t care for it. But that doesn t matter  I will return a million times for the food.
Licha's Cantina,329,The atmosphere here feels like my nonexistent Mexican grandmother s imaginary backyard.  I m not Mexican  and don t have any grandparents  so I ve concocted a really in-depth fantasy about this place...  It s a cute bungalow with some seriously amazing patio seating. It s always hustling and bustling in the best way.  The food here is pretty delicious. The servers are always really friendly and will explain what some of the menu items are  but you could probably order just about anything and it would be incredible. We especially loved the soprecitas - flavorful  decently sized  with the perfect texture. The chips and salsas are also amazing  Also  the watermelon jalape o margarita is insane. It s not too spicy  but is mostly just melt-your-face delicious.   The happy hour prices are really something special here. This place is definitely worth a visit 
Licha's Cantina,330,Went for my bday with a party of 11 ppl. First let me just say that the drinks  Lupita  and  Paloma  were good and the Sopecitos  with shrimp  were so delicious  But the biggest turn off was the service. Our waiter Daniel was in a rush the entire time and was simply rude and made all our guests uncomfortable  though the food was good I don t know if I ll be coming back.
Licha's Cantina,331,Lichas great place to come visit during this epidemic all tables are spaced out. Everyone at the restaurant tested for COVID 19 yesterday. Emanuel was a great person that helped us out didn t our visit. Thank you.
Licha's Cantina,332,Me and my boyfriend are visiting from Seattle and since  there is no good Mexican food there  we wanted to pick a good place- OMG did we ever.  The reviews for Licha s were great- which is why we picked it  and the experience was true to the reviews. We were definitely mpressed by the food and ambiance. The menu is filled with so many amazing things  that the truth is we ordered- AND AITE a ton of different things   yes  we didn t box anything... because it was too good  and we literally rolled out of there .  Everything was heavenly.  One of my favorite foods is sopitas  but not everyone makes the masa well.... Licha s does  we ordered two different flatbreads- which were both excellent and the ingredients are inventive and fresh.  You HAVE to order the camote- sweet potatoes in a sweet glaze  goat cheese and pumpkin seeds.  We went during happy hour and sat out in their cute patio  which was lovely- and I had the Bonita- which was orchata with rum- how can you go wrong    - it was a mini desert   The tres leches was also great.  Next time I am in Austin I will definitely eat hear 
Licha's Cantina,333,I strolled in for Sunday brunch on my way out of town. They had just opened and were relatively quiet  which was nice. I grabbed a seat at the bar and had a cup of coffee as I waited for my meal. The coffee was good  but I do wish they had soy or almond milk to offer. The food was delicious and spicy  just the way I like it    The bartender was friendly and seemed like a genuinely cool  happy guy  The vibe of the restaurant was casually trendy and laid back. It s a little off the beaten path but well worth the visit. I would visit again on my next trip to Austin.
Licha's Cantina,334,Great place takes one back to traditional Mexican atmosphere  food was great had a variety of food items that I have never tried before 
Licha's Cantina,335,Ho-leee-cow  The happy hour here is awesome  I don t know if it s because I m from out of town or if I come from a city that has terrible happy hours but I was definitely impressed with this place. We couldn t believe that everything was  5 bucks. It felt like we had struck gold or something. So we ordered a ridiculous amount of food and drinks -- to like  you know  get our money s worth. The food was good  and I thought the quesadilla s were on point. The drinks were great too. They had this horchata cocktail that was a big hit at our table. We actually didn t have anything here that we didn t like so that s a good sign      Basically  GO TO THE HAPPY HOUR  3-7pm.
Licha's Cantina,336,Normally I shy away from trying a new restaurant in the first week  much less the first 48 hours  but I took a chance on Licha s and was pleasantly surprised. They have already worked through some of the normal opening kinks like training issues  inconsistent food and a smooth running seating system.   We started with the Lengua plate from the appetizer menu and it was the best dish of the night. The tongue was perfectly cooked and still a little crispy and topped with razor thin pieces of escabeche and avocado salsa. To share we ordered the De Pato tacos  Bacalao a La Veracruzana and Carne Deshebrada Con Chile Cascabel. All three dishes were solid but could use a little bit of work as the kitchen gets more comfortable in the coming weeks.   The duck was well cooked but was lacking in the flavor department. The tortillas were great and with the crispy skin and orange and some of their fantastic salsa  they came together nicely. The vera cruz style cod was my second favorite dish and the flavor was spot on with the capers and tomato sauce combining perfectly. The fish itself tasted slightly over done and borderline tough. The brisket was my least favorite as it had a stringy pot roast quality that threw off the whole dish.   Again  with small tweaks  all of these could be great and I am sure it is something they will work out with a little feedback. Our server  Lauren  was still be shadowed by a trainer but she had already mastered the menu and its complex pronunciations. The support staff was also great about clearing plates quickly and refilling water glasses in real time.   That said  there were two problems that have to be worked out asap in my opinion. As folks will remember with Papi Tino in that location beforehand  space is limited. While I understand with limited real estate you have to make it an intimate setting  they have got to get some bigger tables. We had four people and when three of our plates arrived at once we had no where to put them and ended up holding our drinks while we ate.   Finally  given that the cultural focus of the menu appears to be interior Mexican  I was  taken aback to get a Michelada made with Zing Zang mix  On my next visit  and there will be one because overall this was a solid experience and I can see a tremendous amount of potential here  I hope to find a nice ice-cold homemade Michelada there to greet me 
Licha's Cantina,337,Took Yelp s suggestion and tried this Mexican restaurant  amp  so happy we did.   My mom and I walked in and we were told there was an hour wait. Not a problem at all because the back patio is adorable and has a bar where you can chill and order chips and salsa while you wait. Give us a margarita and chips and we are golden. The bartender was super friendly and gave us recommendations.   About 45 min later our name was called and we got a table. We were having such a hard time deciding on what food to get because everything looked so good  We decided to get the veggie tacos and a veggie flatbread. the flatbread wasn t my favorite but the tacos were delicious - would definitely come back 
Licha's Cantina,338,Awesome happy hour  great atmosphere  friendly staff. We had the sopecitos and calabacitas quesadilla- both were delish  The margaritas were even better though 
Licha's Cantina,339,In short  sub-par Mexican food at a higher than average price. They won t split checks. With so many Mexican restaurants in town  do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.   Details  This is a great example of a sad austin trend. Restaurants that will not split checks. A customer is willing to pay for your food and services but you won t accommodate them by making it easy for them to pay you  Poor choice by management. ALSO  came in to brunch and ordered the chivo goat plate  on the menu for  15. Got my check and it was listed  for  22  The lady at the host stand said it was because they were changing the prices and she hadn t put new menus in yet. Pretty sure that s false advertising. After two incorrectly revised checks they did fix it. Wouldn t have paid  22 for it anyways. Not sure it was even worth the  15.
Licha's Cantina,340,Hell yes. Great food  great drinks  great bartenders. 5 stars  can t wait to go back.
Licha's Cantina,341,Wish I could give 6 stars  the BEST mexican food i ve ever tasted and amazing service. Salsa was 10 10 as well.
Licha's Cantina,342,We got shut out of a show at SXSW  don t get me started  and needed something to boost our spirits  like spirits  strong ones  and stumbled upon this wonderful little spot around 9 00 one night. Our timing was perfect in that they had a table open on the deck  which overlooked the bustle of E 6th  had a nice breeze. Lights wrapped around the large tree in the front yard gave it a nice ambiance and to top it all off they had an awesome 90s hip hop mix going  RIP Phife Dawg  and the whole experience turned our night around.  From the moment we sat down to the moment I called much later to see if they had my debit card  whoops    the staff was just delightful. They didn t have my card  but it was well after closing time and the guy who I talked to really tried to find it and at the end said  really hope you still enjoyed your time here  or something to that affect  which I thought was very nice for some reason  maybe just because he had every right to be hanging up pronto and getting out the door.  ANYhow  we had some really great cocktails  the waygu tacos which were also delicious and some guac and chips. It wasn t the single best meal we ate in Austin  but it was probably one of the dining experiences I ll remember most fondly from our 5 days  just because of the staff  atmosphere and that soundtrack. If I lived locally  I d be here all the time. Thanks Licha s crew for turning our frown upside down 
Licha's Cantina,343,Great queso dip... not sure what they call it but it was fantastic. Thought after that the food was going to be good. I got the most expensive steak on the menu.... it was horrible. They are trying too hard with the sauce they put on it and it was gross. Couldn t even eat it. So I traded my friend who got some kind of skillet. His was overcooked. Had high hopes for it but it was very disappointing.
Licha's Cantina,344,Probably some of the best Mexican food I ve ever had and I m a native Texan.    They don t serve your standard enchilada plate with side of rice and beans.  The tacos came with the meat cooked in a personal sized cast iron skillet and a stack of small shareable tortilla shells.  Enough food to share.  Really can t describe how good these are.  The happy hour deal on quesadillas were  5 for the best quesadillas I ve ever had.  The  5 happy hour margaritas were insanely good and packed a punch so one was more than enough.  The street corn was great  too.  They had more pricey entre options  one with octopus  so they have an interesting menu   but the tacos and quesadillas were delicious.  The only negative is the converted house is small so we had to sit out on the patio.  It was hotter than blazes since it is July and we went around 5-6pm.  It was so hot we asked for pitchers of water which was supplied.  But  we trooped through and had a great meal.  This decidedly non-Tex Mex style Mexican food needs to be experienced at least once  though.
Licha's Cantina,345,BEST Food EVER      I was researching online to find a place that offered GF  amp  Vegetarian Options.  The Reviews on Licha s were ALL Amazing   The minute I drove up  I KNEW I d made the Right Choice   The Decor is Eclectic  Colorful  amp  Fun... Extremely Warm  amp  Inviting... Right up my Alley     The Staff are ALL Very Friendly  and Warm... Like they ve known you Forever  Daniel Brooks comes out to introduce Himself  welcoming You   Welcome  My House is Your House   It doesn t get any More Inviting than THAT     Everyone there is SO Accommodating   They offered MANY GF  amp  Vegetarian Choices.  Artistic Presentation  with a Swirl of Flavor Explosions  in each Relished Bite... Awww  The Wafting Blend of the Aromatic Spices   In Deepest Gratitude... This is My New Austin Go-To Restaurant... It Will Be The First Place  I will BE taking ALL of My Out of Town Guests... to Have the  Licha s Experience      They Too  Will BE Very Grateful   
Licha's Cantina,346,Good margarita and extensive menu. Very different from some Mexican I have had before  but tasty  Really enjoyed the chorizo queso 
Licha's Cantina,347,The vibe here is always so relaxed but buzzing. Licha s is definitely in a happening spot here in Austin. I love the outdoor areas as well as the cocktails. You have to have a La Mula    This place is very close to my heart and I would recommend visitors and locals alike to come experience this wonderful place. The food is always great. My husband and I have had almost all of the items on the menu at least once and had never experienced a bad bite    Great for bigger parties as well since you can rent out the back area. We had our rehearsal dinner here and loved it.  For great food  drinks  service  and experience  visit Licha s.
Licha's Cantina,348,Went to Lichas cantina  for happy hour--great drinks and food choices at reasonable prices. 2 drinks pp and 2 hearty appetizers for two and entire bill was  30  Patio dining was lively and service was attentive.
Licha's Cantina,349,Great gluten free menu  I wish all restaurants did this    At first I had a hard time maneuvering the menu. It was hard to know what the meat veggie corn ratios were from the menu descriptions and many of the ingredient combinations were not for me. I don t like too many overpowering sauces or pickled things. At first I wanted the duck enchilada looking dish but I really am picky about mole sauce. I don t like the overly chocolate smokey flavor.  Our waiter was very kind and let me taste it before ordering and yep the mole sauce was too rich for me. My dining partner liked it and ate the rest of the dipping sauce. As a waiter was delivering food by my table that appealed to me  I stalked it. Both of those plates looked good so it was between the gorditas and ticoynes. I went with the ticoynes with pork but no pickled onions substitute regular onions and yep it was so delicious I ate the whole thing. Also they let me order half order of the salad with cactus dressing for half the cost. The salad was tremendously good and my dining partner loved his burger. I tasted it yep the burger rocked and all the toppings of the burger were magic. The red sauce they serve with chips was delicious. Not too spicy and very different than traditional salsa. You just have to try it.   So even though I am picky as hell the service here helped me have a heavenly meal. I shall return and try the hurrache or tacos next. Thanks Licha for being so kind to me.
Licha's Cantina,350,This Mexican place seemed promising to try out for dinner in our new neighborhood  always busy and a good vibe. The food while not terrible   doesn t really have much going for it and seem uninspired. Guacamole is flat  no lime  no cilantro   just mashed avocado. Chips are out of bag  salsa is like hot sauce. Fish   shrimp tacos didn t have much flavor. Salad is tossed together like an after thought. Waste of money and time.
Licha's Cantina,351,I was impressed by the ambiance  service  and drinks. Food was half good and half bad.  We sat in the back yard  which was super quaint with string lights. Only downside was the our table  set for four  had a weird bench on one side that was super narrow and made for an uncomfortable seating situation. I m a normal sized girl and my butt was sore halfway through dinner so I can t imagine how awkward it would be to sit through the meal on that tiny bench if I had more junk in the trunk....na mean   We started off with the house specialty margaritas for only  4 -- definitely a steal. As a shared appetizer we got the Choriqueso which was similar to a queso flameado with a shot of tequila on top. Super delicious and not too heavy split amongst 4 people. It s served with a thick  dense tortilla similar in consistency to pita bread. Absolutely delicious  I ll be going back just to have that.  For our main course a friend and I shared the De Pato tacos and the Lengua sopecitos. Let me start with the positive  the lengua sopecitos were to DIE for  If you re like me and had never had beef tongue... do it  It was super tender and the escabeche was made from cauliflower which was a nice crunchy texture to compliment the meat. Must  MUST order the lengua. However  the de pato  roasted duck  tacos were super disappointing. For whatever reason  the duck tasted super gamey and honestly tasted like what wet dog smells like. Rough  I know. On the bright side  our waiter told us that it s possible to get the lengua in taco form so I ll definitely be trying that next time   A third friend ordered the Pambazo  torta  essentially  and although I don t remember exactly what kind she ordered  I remember it being good. Spicy  the bread is soaked in salsa  yum   and huge  she only finished half .   All in all  I recommend Licha s  I m super curious about the other items on the menu so I ll be coming back.
Licha's Cantina,352,My boyfriend had mentioned he had a sandwich here that he liked. I was a little skeptical of the place  but oh my god. I thought my boyfriend was going to pass out from how happy he was with his food. I got the pork quesadilla with 3 different types of pork in it  but the real star of the show was the guacamole. It was FANTASTIC. The service was good as well. We just got beers so no report on the cocktails.  We are going back tonight and I m pretty sure I ll be expected to carry the conversation as he chews and makes happy noises the whole meal.
Licha's Cantina,353,After being disappointed by the Mexican food in Austin  I was ecstatic to find Licha s. The Mexican food is reminiscent of the authentic food of Mexico City. I have been here 3 times now and have not been disappointed by anything. My absolute favorite is the duck enchiladas. The Duck is really flavorful  not at all fatty and the enchiladas are very generous. The drinks  guacamole  presentation and service have all been outstanding. Definitely my favorite Austin restaurant 
Licha's Cantina,354,BEST mexican food in Austin texas  great music  great margaritas  its worth always the wait  Also they have latin music on always and I love it 
Licha's Cantina,355,Amazing tacos and ambiance   The service was really good too. Would love to come back here.
Licha's Cantina,356,By mistake they gave my food to someone else  so I wait forever to get my first course. The problem was the way the employees handled it. The bar supervisor  a middle age white roman with black hair wearing those weird glasses  was even making fun of me and my situation. She really made me feel that I wasn t welcome.   She might have some race issues  I don t care. That s her problem.   I will never visit this place again and of course I don t recommend it to anyone.
Licha's Cantina,357,This is one of our favorite places in Austin.  We recommended it to our son and his family who were visiting from CA.  He texted me from there   You killed it   They loved everything about it.
Licha's Cantina,358,Outrageously delicious  We ve had the beef ribs  sopes  the melted cheese mushroom dish. Micheladas. All fantastic.
Licha's Cantina,359,Try the salsa soaked sandwich  I recommend eating half  sharing half  and getting a second dish to split. The flavor are strong so you ll enjoy a taste of something else with it    Drinks  Their fresh squeezed cocktails are exceptional and taste like nothing I have ever had. Very thoughtful presentation too.  Dessert  I went against the tres leches recommendation and got the choco pot de creme. Ridiculously good. Chocolatey  chili powder maybe  Finger lickin good.  Will definitely be back   
Licha's Cantina,360,My friend and I loved Licha s Cantina  The Gorditas are absolutely delicious  We ordered the Margarita and the Vampino to drink and the Vampino was definitely our favorite. The staff is amazing and they really make sure you are taken care of 
Licha's Cantina,361,Last night tried three different taco plates ALAMBRE Steak  bacon  queso asadero  onions  amp  peppers DE PATO Roasted duck  green onions  orange LENGUA Beef tongue  onions  escabeche  All good but the Lengua was AweSOM - melt in your mouth kind of AweSOM
Licha's Cantina,362,Nice atmosphere and cute cantina on East side. I can t review the drinks as I arrived late and only had water but the food was just fine  not great. The guacamole was standard  3 stars  and the  tacos alambre seemed more greasy and salty than flavorful. I don t know if it was an off night on a later Wed evening. My main course was the huachinango tikin xic  rubbed red snapper  and the fish was well seasoned  but I picked out a bunch of fish bones while eating  which was took away from the experience for me.    It s a place I d try again if someone suggested it and maybe order something different and get the margaritas  but not one i could recommend based on what I ordered.
Licha's Cantina,363,Amazing Mexican food  incredible hospitality and service. The waiter even let us taste the mole sauce before we ordered an entree  
Licha's Cantina,364,Hands down best trendy Restaurant on the East Side on 35. Tortillas remind me of my grandmothers home made corn tortillas. Tampique a with mole and their salsa they bring to the table hands down amazing. If I could have ordered everything on the menu I would. Def I will try more next time.
Licha's Cantina,365,nope. Fun atmosphere  patio and music  but the food not so much. It s always packed and wait is usually long. For the price  I was expecting more. It is one of those places where the amount of cheese on the dishes tries to compensate for the lack of flavor. The guacamole was too creamy and blah.
Licha's Cantina,366,This place is a treat. The bartenders treat you well. The chocolate cake is rich and amazing. The red snapper is my favorite. No matter what you order you will not be disappointed.
Licha's Cantina,367,5 stars for the patio     5 stars for the Swiss chard salad with nopales. It s the perfect lunch salad.   4 stars for the guac portion and other food.   Great location  great drinks  good food.
Licha's Cantina,368,Pretty terrible chips were the first red flag. This place is decent  but pricey with bad service.
Licha's Cantina,369,Found this place on Yelp   my friend and I definitely wanted to make the trek to eat here because we loved what we saw.  Overall  we had a solid experience at Licha s - one that I will remember and will share with others when they ask for Austin recommendations. I m a HUGE fan of Mexican food and have pretty high standards for the Mexican restaurants I frequent  and this one definitely made the cut   We started with the breakfast margaritas  great choice  Comes with an amazing masala spiced-rim . Our dishes tasted fantastic as well - great sauces and Mexican flavors. Not truly authentic-feeling  but still completely delicious. The place itself is very cute as well - has a bit of a  cottage  feel. It s located in somewhat of a random place  but that adds to the charm because you feel like you ve stumbled upon an Austin gem.  TIP  Check out the happy hour - looks like they have some awesome deals.
Licha's Cantina,370,This place is cute as all get-out   They have wonderful mixed drinks  terrific salsa and nice portion-sizes.  I was a little worried when I placed my order because it was about 12 bucks for what was categorized as a salad.  But when I got it I was amazed   It was huge and so fresh     Our server was great and sounded truly thrilled when we gave him feedback saying we d definitely come again.   I m not sure of his name but he had a kickass afro  
Licha's Cantina,371,My absolute favorite Mexican joint in town. Chips and salsas are really flavorful. Variety and eclectic mix on Menu is always a plus. My go to dish here in town is the Steak Tampiqueno here. It s unbelievably delicious. Must have   Other than the food  the vibe is really cool here. Everyone is laid back  music is solid  and people are friendly.
Licha's Cantina,372,I recently visited Licha s cantinas for Brunch and I have to say that I had a very pleasant experience. From service to food  to ambience and price  I would recommend it to everybody. I ordered Pastel Azteca...muy muy bueno 
Licha's Cantina,373,We came for my mother s birthday and didn t know what to expect. Sat indoors  entering the door it did smell kind of like cat pee sour mop.. but we stayed  Everyone ordered a variety of tacos. AMAZING  The flavor and presentation was great  Also enjoyed a pitcher of the spicy jalape o margaritas  A nice spice  Shots of the house tequila were great  Better quality tequila than you d get at a random bar.
Licha's Cantina,374,Hadn t been here yet-- how    But it didn t disappoint  Fun  lively Mexican decor on the inside staff was super friendly as well. Very quaint little spot easy to miss when walking by. There was a long wait on a Thursday night but the food came out so quick  We ordered the quesadillas which tasted super fresh added plus they add hibiscus flowers in them   Can t wait to try other items on the menu 
Licha's Cantina,375,All I can say is wow  That was totally unexpected in every way  Mexican restaurants can really go either way that Licha s hit out of the park in every way. We were there with a large group for Sunday brunch and were served a family style meal. The Chilaquiles were the best I ever had and there was also some sort of breakfast casserole that might have been the best thing I ate in Austin all weekend  The drink menu was dynamite. Whatever the tequila watermelon drink was  it was so great that I had three of them. The patio seating was stylish and comfortable. Awesome experience  Would come back every time I go to Austin 
Licha's Cantina,376,Great hipster vybez   fun drinks and unique food  My first time ever and now im a fan of the place. A must to go in austin  
Licha's Cantina,377,Not good Mexican fare by any stretch of the imagination. If you want to feed your face with a cheep  quick meal during their happy hour  knock yourself out. Otherwise  don t bother.
Licha's Cantina,378,This is one of my favorite places to eat in Austin  Their food is unique and their margaritas are delicious  Licha s is a must 
Licha's Cantina,379,The service was great  people were very attentive and nice. The environment was relaxing  cute  and fun. The only major downfall was the food  which is one of the main reasons I wanted to go. It might have just been the dish I ordered  but it was just a bit disappointing. I got the chilaquiles with chicken tinga  and it was pretty tasteless and had a mushy texture. I think for the prices they had on their menu I just expected the food to be better quality. I would definitively go back for some drinks and appetizers  because they do have a great patio but I wouldn t recommend it for anyone wanting an amazing meal.  It s one of those places that I was really excited to try  to enjoy some real authentic Mexican food  but overall it was over-priced  average tasting food in an environment that was nice but trying a little too hard.
Licha's Cantina,380,Sunday brunch is awesome   Champiqueso is a must. Incredible drinks. Try the Angel for something different. Delicious.
Licha's Cantina,381,Best Mexican food and staff I ve ever had. I ve managed restaurants for almost 20 years. This place is amazing and exactly what I would want if I owned my own place. You ever go to Austin stop here for dinner or you will never know. If you live in Austin and never been here. Be ashamed and move.     Staff very friendly. Food is by far the best I have ever had. I ve eaten at 100 different Mexican restaurants. Will go back to Austin just to eat here.
Licha's Cantina,382,Ok  had to come and change my review because I came here for dinner with friends yesterday and tried completely different things and felt it was way better than my last visit  Was it because I came on a Tuesday at like 8 30 PM and the kitchen wasn t so slammed  Not sure..it WAS busy though. On a Tuesday at 8 30 PM the wait was still 25-30 minutes. Undeterred we ordered drinks at the main bar. I tried a bit of my friend s drink  which was La Mula. The Mezcal based cocktail wasn t too strong and just a great hint of smokiness.   Sat outside in the front area of the house so the place felt more vibey than sitting in the back tented part with the bad fluorescent lighting.  My friend made a point that on the outside it looks like it s going to be a more casual place  which it is..but the prices are more mid-level almost fine dining prices. I guess another reviewer called it  hole-in-the-wall chic   which is really perfect description. I don t think any of the specials were less than  20 with the exception of the burger they had on there. But I really do appreciate the non-traditional fare sometimes you just get tired of red or green sauce enchiladas and regular tacos so this coupled with a good vibe is fun to go to now and again.   Another A  for their music choices.
Licha's Cantina,383,Hands down the best drinks and meal in Austin  This place is worth the wait  Get a drink and chill outside while you wait on your table  I will definitely be back 
Licha's Cantina,384,Real authentic Mexican food. Food is so well prepared and flavorful. Every time I come I love it more. Bar is also great     Ps. This is coming from a Mexican.
Licha's Cantina,385,I m ready to come back to Licha s when I m in Austin again. I wish there were one in Houston    but then I d come here all the time and gain 27572lbs  -D  The food is legit. Our party of six arrived to Licha s Saturday afternoon around 3pm and sat outside in the front. The salsas and chips to start are 5 5. The green salsa has a nice spicy kick and the red is smoky. We ordered some guac  and were pleasantly surprised by their touch of pepitas and queso fresco - 5 5. I ordered the gorditas de pulpo  octopus   and they were incredibly tasty. I wanted more   Among our party  the following were ordered  gorditas de carnitas  I think  There were two options and they got the other   huarache de mole con pollo  huarache campechano  and tacos al pastor. Everyone throughly enjoyed their food. It started to rain about halfway through our dining experience  but we were quickly escorted to the inside back patio area  and I m quite glad we did or else I would ve missed the cooking operation they have going on. You can see them making the tortillas gorditas by hand and whatnot. AWESOME 
Licha's Cantina,386,We discovered this wonderful gem in a funky little east side house after getting ourselves  removed  from Takoba  not for being obnoxious  just for having too many friends gathered at the bar to celebrate a birthday. There were already 20 of us and more to follow  and Takoba  which I love  already had 3 big parties booked  it was Friday  after all   so a couple of us harrumphed around the corner and voila  Licha s had a big  whitewashed picnic table in front  and the amiable hostess said   Sure  we can accommodate ya  Let us get it set up    The skies had opened up earlier  and the only caveat was that if it started raining  well  we d get wet. We didn t care  and it didn t rain  and the table was set birthday-party perfect.    What we got was excellent service and amazing food  and there ended up being at least 30 of us. Plenty of room out front  and our server did a great job. I had the deliciously interesting Chile Relleno con Quinoa  and added steak to it  just because  this girl gots to have her meat nyuk nyuk .  It was fantastic. I d never experienced quinoa in a relleno.  The chile itsownself was perfectly spicy  me likes spicy   stuffed and baked to perfection with a really great mix of chipotle sauce  black beans and the magical quinoa.  Getting the food out was also handled very well  it seems the whole staff pitched in and served our big group  all at the same time  no one had to wait for nothin .   Everyone raved about their dishes  and when it came time to pay  our server  Sophia   did her very best to separate tabs just the way everyone wanted  which can be a huge pain in the arse  I know   and no one had to wait too long to pay out.   A bonus   the wonderfully divey Rio Rita bar is just next door  so of course one can pop in for a nightcap there. That s another review.   All in all  I highly recommend Licha s Cantina  and can t wait to take the hubby there to  check it out and try some more offerings.
Licha's Cantina,387,I really enjoyed Licha s Cantina. They serve two kinds of salsa  each with a unique taste  one with a spicy kick. The place had a fun  laid-back atmosphere. We shared the chamorro de cerdo adobado  pork shank  and it was top notch.
Licha's Cantina,388,Great spot for a casual atmosphere yet incredibly crafted dinner. Our server attended to us frequently  recommended quality dishes  and maintained a friendly demeanor. My only hesitation would be that if you re very hungry  Licha s may not be the place  portions run slightly smaller than what I m used to in a Mexican spot. Overall  great service  authentic food  and a casual atmosphere with an upscale feel. Works well for dates 
Licha's Cantina,389,Yum  yum and some more yum. Licha s is amazing  From their choriqueso to their sopecitos  everything hits the spot. One of the best restaurants in austin. Go for happy hour to get a great deal with  5 cocktails and select menu items.
Licha's Cantina,390,We just yelped for nearby margs and expected a texmex joint. Pleasantly surprised that this cozy house instead served more authentic Mexico City style cuisine. We arrived early in the evening and were sat right away  but the place seemed to fill up fast so reservations may be a good idea. Though pricier than most Austin restaurants  the food was great. Service was a bit slow  but other than that it was somewhere we would come back to.
Licha's Cantina,391,Omg.. the food is amazing  Every time I come here I love it more and more  The service is great and I love the ambiance .. my fave are the aguacate sopecitos
Licha's Cantina,392,The food is delicious and the atmosphere is amazing but the drinks were weak. The bartender at the back bar doesn t know how to count his pour. Makes the weakest drink around. Not even a full ounce of tequila made it in our  11 margarita. Thanks buddy.
Licha's Cantina,393,We are visiting Austin and ate there last night on recommendation of a friend. It was by FAR the best and most authentic Mexican dinner we ve ever eaten. The ceviche was like none I ve ever had  with wonderful spices and the charred snapper main course with the cactus side dish was mouth watering. All 4 of us ordered something different and all 4 were equally pleased. Great food  great atmosphere  and great service. Our waiter Miguel was very knowledgeable about the cuisine and very attentive. I rarely take time to do restaurant reviews  so that s how much I love this place. Try it out 
Licha's Cantina,394,This is currently my favorite place for drinks and eats on the east side.   I have spent a lot of time all over Mexico and the food here has unique attributes like blue corn tortillas.  The margaritas were perfect - not too sweet  not too sour - wih fresh lime juice. You can even order a pitcher there for a reasonable price. Overall  the prices were perfect and they have a solid happy hour where all the appetizers are  5 each.  I can t remember the discount on the drinks during happy hour because I got a little....yeah   happy  so whoops    The best part overall at Licha s is the actual building and backyard  We all felt like we were in the comfort of a south Austin bungalow with a fun crowd and comfortable tables seating. To me  this place felt much less  east side  than the other places I have experienced. The staff was all super friendly and helpful.  I can t wait to go back 
Licha's Cantina,395,This is one of my favorite spots in Austin. Super cute  great atmosphere and location. Most importantly  food is delicious. A must is you are gluten free.
Licha's Cantina,396,A friend and I were walking by this place to head somewhere else when my nose caught the amazing smell of Mexican food. Being Hispanic and from South texas I am quite picky about my Mexican food but we decided to take a chance and stop and eat here. I had the sopes de pollo and my friend had a pork and beef plate on a tiny skillet with home made corn tortillas. Everything was amazing. Tortillas were amazing. We definitely cut our plates in half to share with each other. Amazing flavor in everything we ate. The sopes I had are an appetizer I think but I had it as a meal and omg  amazing flavor and taste  They really don t skimp on the filling either. It was so filling I couldn t even finish it. I will definitely go back. And the staff was extremely friendly.
Licha's Cantina,397,I was really excited to try this place  but with all of the great tex-mex to be had in Austin I don t think we d choose Licha s cantina again.  Maybe it s because I m not a huge mezcal fan  but I found the drinks to be small  meh tasting  and overpriced... which is also what is say about the food. Service was ok and the place itself has a little charm to it  but not enough to bring me back.  My wife did have a chicken mole dish that she liked  just is on the expensive side for what I d classify as casual Mexican food.
Licha's Cantina,398,The food did not taste good at all    After reading these reviews me and my husband were really excited to come and enjoy good food  however the food is very average    The Resturant is really cute though  and the music is really good   
Licha's Cantina,399,The food is tasty  but hard to remember when you re so annoyed about the check. Never come here if you expect to split a check different ways. Even in the age of Venmo  it s still not always easy to figure out what people owe. Their system can accommodate multiple cards  you just have to do the awful math to figure out who owes what  and yet somehow the group is always short because math is hard. Happy to actually review this place if they can update their POS to be more group friendly.
Licha's Cantina,400,This cute Mexican restaurant has some of the best gluten free Mexican food  The menu items may sound a bit funky but the flavors are amazing. They also have pitcher margaritas so you can t go wrong here 
Licha's Cantina,401,Fun lively atmosphere  Watched the World Cup here and it was a blast. Great tacos also. Overall great experience
Licha's Cantina,402,I had the molletes with skirt steak and queso flameado fundido and both were soooooo good. We also got the fried bananas. Highly recommend. Their portions are huge  though  so I recommend sharing. Because of the chips and salsa and appetizer  I was barely able to have two bites of my food. Huge  huge portions. Yummy drinks too 
Licha's Cantina,403,This place has been on my radar for months now and I finally came for their happy hour with a friend visiting Austin. We sat inside because there was a wait for outside. The atmosphere decor is ok. The drinks were pretty good. We tried their margarita and el naranjo  mestizo mezcal  combier  kings ginger  orange bitters . Their orange salsa is quite citrusy and was great. The green one had some nice kick to it. Their sopecitos  black bean layered corn cups  were excellent. We tried the lengua one and the conchinita pibil one. Both were really tasty. The lengua was  nice and meaty while the conchinita pibil was just as delicious.  Aside from the pretty slow  our waiter   semi-disinterested  our host  service   the biggest drawback or disappointment was in their ceviche. For  15 the portion was pretty good  but after the first few bites I felt the quality was pretty sub-par. Without the sauce on top I could taste more of the fish and it tasted a bit fishy.  I would definitely come back here  I just wouldn t get the ceviche and sitting outside would be more ideal if they have room or a short wait. The rest of the menu looks real tasty and judging by the sopecitos I bet most of it is pretty good. Their happy hour is great too.
Licha's Cantina,404,For sure one of the best restaurants in Austin  happy hour  food  amp  drinks  are awesome  
Licha's Cantina,405,Cute little cantina  unique and tasty tacos. Good salsas  Had the Cochinita Pibil tlacoyos  tasty. On a homemade blue corn masa tortilla. My friends ordered the Al Pastor and Alambre tacos  best items on the menu  Definitely recommend these items for first timers  delish  No comment on the cocktails  mainly tequila and I am not a tequila drinker . Service was super friendly  but was a little slow at times.
Licha's Cantina,406,I don t eat spicy food  so I rarely eat Mexican food. However I love the food of Licha s Cantina  If you don t like spicy food but you like Mexican food this place is a good alternative
Licha's Cantina,407,This place is too good for it s own good.  Affordable  absolutely decadent  yet not too heavy.  Delicious drinks. Great atmosphere.  Great staff...  I almost don t want to review this place because I want to keep it as down low as possible so I can eat there all the time without a crowd....   
Licha's Cantina,408,A friend took us on a long walk from his apartment to a random restaurant that  has good tacos . Needless to say  I would slap my mama for another order of their tacos because it took every morsel of humility to not roll up in a ball and cry of sweet happiness after each bite.   Our server  Sophia  was real cool and made sure we had everything we needed to be transported by a tastebud portal of deliciousness to a mystical land of Mexican delicacies that can only be experienced firsthand.   Please go and eat there I beg you.
Licha's Cantina,409,Hands down the best Mexican food I ve ever had... And I ve had a lot of Mexican food.   We started off with the melted Queso appetizer. It was so good. Definitely not the healthiest choice but worth the calories in flavor.   My finance ordered the Leunga Tacos. It was our first time trying beef tongue  so I was a bit hesitant  but the meat was incredible juicy. The tacos were delicious    The margaritas were small  but man were they strong. Just one and I was feeling great  They were fresh and flavorful  a common theme among everything we ordered . Then I tried La Mule  a Mexican take on the Moscow Mule  which is one of my favorite drinks. There was a weird flavor to this drink that reminded me of cough syrup. Not sure if it was the liquor or something else  but it made me wish that I had gotten a 2nd margarita instead. However the spices around the rim were amazing and the best part of the drink. Id love to figure out what they are.  Hands down my favorite part of the meal was my dinner-- the Perscado con Papas Bravas. Grouper filet  sweet potatoes and chorizo. Extremely fresh and flavorful    My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I will dream about this meal until the next time I m in Austin.   The vibe was hip with fun outdoor seating  great music  candles lit throughout. Overall it had a homey  relaxed feel that was perfect for a fun date night. Great waitstaff who recommended our fabulous dishes  I always ask my waiter what their favorite meal on the menu is... Best trick when trying a new spot   I would recommend Licha s Catina to all my friends and family in Austin. Thank you for treating us to a phenomenal experience 
Licha's Cantina,410,Great place   Interesting food  fun environment   good wait staff.  If eat here daily if I lived nearby.
Licha's Cantina,411,My friends and I were in Austin for the weekend and wanted some kind of Tex-Mex Mexican food. We found Licha s on yelp and arrived around 7. They told us it would be an hour wait but there s a bar in the back with lots of seating  so we got drinks. Be careful if you don t like spicy drinks--which I do not. The food was unlike any food I ve had before. We were seated in what felt like less than an hour. The menu is mostly Spanish and we definitely had to pull our phones out  but we all ended up really enjoying our food. The mole was particularly excellent.
Licha's Cantina,412,Great concept  great location and love the idea  but honestly wound up being a whole bunch of meh. Bartender and hostess were super-nice and margaritas were strong  but just so-so. Salsa was really the only thing that had real flavor  so wound up adding it to everything from the guacamole to the cochinitas  tacos  quesadillas...you get the idea. Service wasn t awful  but was very mediocre and I got the sense it was more about hipster posing than customer service. It was just a little disappointing after seeing the stellar reviews but I decided to write one because if you re a foodie like I am  you re going to leave with a bit of a shrug and  meh  and feel misguided by the 5-star reviews. Nothing horrible  but certainly not worst another visit.
Licha's Cantina,413,Made me sick. I m sorry but I m just now recovering and this is the for sure place that screwed me up. Will never go here again.
Licha's Cantina,414,I am from San Diego and this is the best Mexican food I ve had since moving to ATX. Do yourself a favor and come here. We had  Watermelon jalape o margarita  YUM      Perfect drink  Refreshing and delish   Regular margarita  Way strong  how I like it  but SOO GOOD   Barbacoa de chiva       the goat dish  Loved  Full of flavor    Yum  Guac  standard  but never disappoints  Wagyu beef tacos  Perfect  Beef and bacon and jalape os   What is not to love    I will definitely come back when I have my Mexican food cravings  Thank you     
Licha's Cantina,415,Came here for Sunday brunch and the food was awesome for all 5 people. I can t wait to try more.  Waitress and staff were A 
Licha's Cantina,416,I always have the best time at Licha s. Definitely one of my go-to spots in Austin  I always feel like I m dining with my friends here. I love the ambience  Last time we went our waiter with the mohawk was SO friendly and was also a blast to take shots with      We had the Pozole  which I think was on special. It was so great I could have had two bowls  If  you get the chance to visit in nice weather  try and get a table out front and spend the day people watching on the east side.
Licha's Cantina,417,My boyfriend and I chose this as our anniversary dinner spot  and I could not have enjoyed it more  First of all  you get free chips which is always a win in my book. They come with delicious mango and avocado salsas  which could have been a meal in themselves. I should have said  no  when asked if I wanted a refill  but I could not resist. When the food came  my eyes lit up. I had gotten the Conchinita Pibil  which I have never had before  and I was blown away by how flavorful it was  Food wise everything was amazing.  It was a Tuesday night and there was about a 30 minute wait  but this is only because there was a very large party ahead of us. The host made sure to keep us posted on wait time and was very accommodating  The only thing I would have changed was that when I asked for a to-go box  the waiter took my plate to box it up for me  not realizing that I am a major cheapo and so I wanted to throw a bunch of chips and arrange it a certain way  OCD a little bit . I still ate it  don t get me wrong  I realize they are doing that as a way to provide better service  but sometimes I just want to do it myself     I will definitely be going back here and have already suggested this place to about 10 people since I ve gone last week.
Licha's Cantina,418,Dear yelp    In my recent outing to Austin  Texas  I read upon this Mexican restaurant with very positive reviews. My expectation for this establishment was overwhelmingly positive. However  during my hour wait for a table of two  I witnessed the hostess giving all costumers an inconsistent amount of wait time. When I was finally seated  I ordered their most expensive entree- the presentation was scattered and unappetizing  the plate was crowded. The plate featured food that was not listed on the menu. The steak was flavorful  but about 40  muscle. The sides were a disaster- the quesadilla had a dark thick chocolate sauce on top of it  which looked alarmingly similar to the refried beans . Their refried beans were lightly garnished with cottage cheese which was not listed on the menu. Their coleslaw was overly drenched  although flavorful. It almost seemed as though they wanted to empty their kitchen onto my plate. This restaurant attempts to mix savory and sweet multiple times throughout one dish. After expressing disappointment in the quesadilla  rice was given at no extra cost. Overall  the meal was very unsatisfactory  but the environment was pleasant  friendly and relaxing. It seems  at best  as a good social bar.
Licha's Cantina,419,I went to Licha a few weeks ago after reading glowing reviews.   The ambiance is low key and a little divey. The inviting looking bench seating is extremely uncomfortable - the height  width and ergonomics of that bench does just not lend itself to a nice dinner. I asked to be relocated to a table with chairs instead.  We ordered a variety of drinks at our table. Uniformly  all drinks felt unimaginative and a little blah. We asked for fresh lime on the side and squeezed them into our glasses  which helped a little. The cocktails were lacking that brightness you feel from freshly squeezed fruit.  The chips and salsa were decent. They didn t blow my mind away  which made me sad  because isn t that the signature of Mexican dining  The little prelude that sings to you of the things to come  And so it was.   We tried an item each from the happy hour food menu  and found them to be underwhelming too. Meat was higher on grease than we liked  and low on flavor.  At the end of our meal  we adjourned to their backyard to finish our drinks  I ordered a shot of tequila extra for my second drink. That pepped it up a bit  but it still needed fresh lime  . The backyard is a nice  open space  but lacks the warmth of the interior.  In all  I came away disappointed from my happy hour experience here.
Licha's Cantina,420,We ve been here twice now with the first time being spectacular and the second time leaving things to be desired... perhaps I built it up in my head too much the second time around.    We went for the 5  Happy Hour which is a fantastic deal.  The first go around we ordered 4 drinks total - the Paloma  Margarita  Vampiro and La Mula.  The Paloma and Margarita were very similar and about what I expect around Austin.  La Mula was a Mezcal take on a Moscow Mula which I really enjoyed  the lady not so much  and the Vampiro was similar to a Bloody Mary only very spicy.  At the time I wasn t in the mood  however the lady really enjoyed it.  We ordered drinks both times were in and I highly recommend any of them  especially at happy hour prices.   Looking through the happy hour food items  we ended up on the Mole Con Pollo Hauraches  Tocinada Quesadilla  Camote Verduras.  Starting out with the Camote  three balls of goat cheese  some greens  and 4 slices of sweet potato laying on a sweet  milk   based sauce.  This was fantastic and way better then I anticipated.  Unfortunately the next trip we didn t have the 4 slices of sweet potato but a pile of cubed sweet potato.  As far as taste goes it was probably the same  however presentation was far lacking this time which reduced my enjoyment.    Next up was the Tocinada... the first round I felt it was way to meat heavy for me.  Perhaps it was the mood I was in  or the fact that it was 5 15  we had a show at 7 00 .  Second round it was great   Little bit thinner  so perhaps they reduced the amount of meat inside.  This is covered with an avocado sauce that is awesome and compliments the dish perfectly.   Last was the Mole Con Pollo - This was fantastic the first time we came.  Tons of chicken covered in a mole sauce with cheese on top.  I haven t had a lot of mole  so perhaps it was that contributing to my extreme enjoyment of this dish... however round two it wasn t nearly as great as I had remembered.    To summarize   Great happy hour  great drinks  great food the first time  still good the second.  We will definitely be back.  Perhaps the kitchen was having an off night  or the food wasn t exactly what I was looking for at the time our second round.
Licha's Cantina,421,Great place with a lot of character.  We sat in a large group in the covered back patio.  We had great service but beware  it is loud out there if there are a lot of people.  I had one of the specials for dinner -- it was pork inside a masa pocket of some sort.  The taste was EXCELLENT but it came out only luke warm.  Had it come out hot  I think this would have been a 5 star rating.  As a group  we had their melted queso thingie and guac.  Both were VERY good.  I had a couple of classic margaritas that were very good as well.
Licha's Cantina,422,My partner and I flew in from San Diego and we re extremely excited to try Tex-Mex cuisine in Austin and this place absolutely delivered. It was so hot so we weren t all that hungry but the snacks we did try  Esquite and Huaraches  were delicious  We also smacked on the house chips and salsas and those were honestly my favorite part about that place. Definitely recommend  
Licha's Cantina,423,Love the vibe  location  quirkiness  etc. Green salsa was DELISH and the chips were good and crispy. I loved my spot sitting on the front porch of the house. It s SXSW so I ve come to expect crappy service  but it was beyond slow. It was just little things that added up to make it a non 5 star experience... asked for Chile only rim on my marg and it comes out half salt half Chile  my fianc  s steak was brought out so rare it was blue in spots  my tacos were just okay... and for the price everything should have been stellar. I wouldn t recommend to someone new  but I also would come back again and perhaps try something different.
Licha's Cantina,424,I don t post reviews like this so take it lightly. The bald bartender with stupid tatoos on his skull was such a ____ after I watched him pour four margaritas and he put in mostly lime juice in the fourth. He yelled at me and told me I was wrong. He did poured it out and started another. I ve been here before a couple of times for drinks and their  10 margaritas aren t worth the little tequila. I know no bartender wants to hear about not putting enough alcohol in their drinks but he could have handled it in such a different way.
Licha's Cantina,425,This is my new favorite restaurant  Most authentic I ve ever had. Their Mole is the amazing..... Duck enchiladas and al pastors tacos with Mole  this place is a must try. I m sure I will be a weekly customer  
Licha's Cantina,426,I love everything about Licha s. I ve been for brunch  happy hour  dinner  amp  New Year s   amp  each time is excellent. The food is creative  amp  consistent   amp  the staff is always fun  amp  helpful yet not intrusive. I once told the manager how much I appreciated them  amp  he said   Follow me . He took me to the bar  amp  bought me a shot of tequila. Now that s customer service 
Licha's Cantina,427,My husband and I were craving Chilaquiles after returning from a trip to Mexico City. Our waitresses said the owner is from Mexico City so we got really excited about the dish. It was DELICIOUS  It was better than what I had in Mexico City. We just had mimosas for drinks which tasted like a typical mimosa. Their chips and salsa are really good. The red sauce was the best  and they refilled our chip basket twice and gave us a bigger bowl of red sauce. Great service  Can t wait to return to try some more of the menu and drinks 
Licha's Cantina,428,One of my favorite spots in Austin. The margaritas are great  the bartenders are fun and entertaining and the food is fantastic. Very laid-back atmosphere.
Licha's Cantina,429,Looking for an authentic honest to goodness Mexican nitty gritty place and this is it  When you walk in you feel like you have come home. Would have love to sit outside if it was warmer but sitting inside you get the full experience. The chips and salsa set the bar for just how amazing his place is. One is a spicy verde and the other a more traditionally tasting salsa. We had to try the cocktails so I had a margarita and my husband had a play on Bloody Mary. Best of the best in Austin  Our lunches were so tasty and cooked perfectly I would have licked my plate if it wouldn t have freaked out the customers beside us. Don t think about it...just go for lunch and then back for dinner 
Licha's Cantina,430,Awesome happy hour  really good food and drinks  good atmosphere. Really nice spot to catch up with friends.  The service can be hit or miss though. Also  they say they don t split checks so if you come with a group of friends  you ll have to write down your name and what you had on the back of the receipt for them to split it up. Really annoying  especially since places that charge way less for food and drinks split checks without question.
Licha's Cantina,431,I m from the border  so I am very  very choosy and admittedly snobby with Mexican food. But Licha s. Licha s has won my heart  eternally.   Not only is this place adorable -- Mexican decor everywhere  real intimate outdoor seating with cute candles on each table  great indoor seating  all just so cozy -- but the service is always amazing and their happy hour is INCREDIBLE.  5 menu. Need I say more  My go to is the sopecitos.
Licha's Cantina,432,Atmosphere is awesome  I could sit on the front porch and sip margaritas all night   Super fun place  the staff was really nice and new the menu well.  The chicken tacos were unique and really tasty.  They had a decent amount of vegetarian options and overall prices were good.  The margaritas were great and end of the night coffee was great.   A 
Licha's Cantina,433,Great margs  great food  really authentic IMO   great atmosphere 
Licha's Cantina,434,We went there after an art show just to give it a shot and the food was great especially for the price.
Licha's Cantina,435,I went to Lichas for my first time a few days ago and went again yesterday  9 16 17 . The food was the BOMB  I had the alambre and al pastor tacos. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants some GOOD Mexican food.
Licha's Cantina,436,The food here was good. That being said  the service here on a Saturday night was terrible. I had made a reservation for 10 people the Thursday prior. Before arriving to the restaurant  I had called to confirm that I was arriving with a group of 10 for a reservation at 9pm and they assured me to come on over.   Once we arrived  the hostess tells me  without an apology  that she does not see a reservation under my name. There happened to be another party under the same name  but at a different time  and I guess they must of confused us. I understand that mistakes happen  but a sincere apology  or an apology at all  would of been appreciated. She told us there would be about a 25 minute wait until they had a table ready for us. Over an hour later  without anyone notifying us   we had still not been seated and at this point  it was past 10 30pm. It would have been nice if they were just honest and said they would not be able to seat us and we could of just gone elsewhere to eat instead of standing around for more than 90 mins.   Once we were seated  the server was very pleasant. The food was also good  but not my favorite. I ordered the huitlacoche quesadillas but they had way too much cheese   amp  that is coming from someone who loves cheese  and barely any actual filling. I did however really like the salsa sauce they provided with the chips. It was spicy and jam packed with flavor and ended up complementing the quesadilla. They did offer a good variety of vegetarian options and were also accommodating for my vegan dairy-free friends.
Licha's Cantina,437,Patio was perfect  Service...perfect. Food...perfect. Seriously wouldn t have changed a thing. Had the pibil entree and hubby had duck tacos. We clean plate clubbed it 
Licha's Cantina,438,LICHA s  AWESOME   Mostly everything is gluten free. SAY WHAT  YES. It s amazing.   We went for happy hour and got a bunch of apps and drinks. The Jalapeno Watermelon Margarita is DELICIOUS. And so is all of the food. Even if I wasn t gluten free  I d be here ALL the time.   The corn cakes  pizza kind of things and everything in between are absolutely fabulous. The waitress was awesome and friendly  and the manager offered to buy us our next round because they needed our table for a big group coming in. Can t beat that   I will definitely be frequenting here 
Licha's Cantina,439,One of my all time favorites is Mole... I make it myself from time to time... this dish is arduos and exquisite    The mole here at Lichas is one of the best moles I have ever had...   The next best thing is their Tuetano Sope    Seriously... it does not get better than this  
Licha's Cantina,440,FYI - Read the menu. It is not a Tex-Mex restaurant   This is traditional Mexican cuisine. Very different.   CONS- no AC  only fans. Not what we were used to flavor wise.   PROS- super cute interior exterior. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Drinks were phenomenal   
Licha's Cantina,441,Was in Austin for a few days over Super Bowl weekend. Licha s was just about a half mile down the road from our AirBnB and it looked interesting so the next night we gave it a try. It was really phenomenal. I had Tacos Alambre and quite honestly I m still thinking about them 2 weeks later. SO good. I wasn t even that hungry going in because I had had a big lunch  but I couldn t stop eating. Intro chips and salsa were excellent  drinks and ambience were good  service was fine  etc. But those tacos were really insanely good. Gf was quite pleased with her dish as well.
Licha's Cantina,442,It s been muchos anos since I was blown away by a Mexican restaurant  but Licha s has done it.    Every time I ve been in has been a great experience.  First visit  I had the Cochinita Pibil  A bowl of flavorful  tender pork  with thick little triangles of homemade tortillas on the side. For  15  and not even the full meal version  I could hardly finish it all.  Dessert time brought on the divine Tres Leches cake. A different style than the spongy cake I m accustomed to  it s more...biscuit-y  Denser. Decadent. Delicious.  Second time  I brought an out of town guest and she was duly impressed. I had the Al Pastor tacos and my companion had the Ceviche. Both were fantastic. And yes  again I had the Tres Leches  and again I devoured it Homer Simpson style.  Third visit I just had the chips and awesome sweet   spicy salsas while drinking  with more out of town guests.  Could this be my new spot to take non-locals to   Which brings me to the real reason I keep coming back..   The margaritas.  BEST MARGARITAS I VE HAD IN YEARS. I m totally addicted. Yes  I ve tried the other cocktails at Licha s  and while also tasty  I keep going back to the gold standard of Mexican drinks. They only use 3 ingredients  including Espolon tequila.  Simple. Sweet  amp  sour perfectly balanced.  I have to give mad props to the owner  Daniel Brooks. He is always there  and working just as hard or harder than the staff around him  who are also great. He remembered my name after meeting me once  and his dedication to the success of his restaurant shows.  Go there  but not when I m there  because I don t like waiting for tables.
Licha's Cantina,443,This place is wonderful  There was a long wait on a Friday so we hung outside at the back bar and drank margaritas. I got the watermelon jalape o and it was so great  It was truly watermelon and not too sweet with added sugars. For my meal I got the vegetarian tacos with sweet potatoes and pumpkin seeds. They have great healthy tex mex options as well. Highly recommend 
Licha's Cantina,444,Lichas oh Lichas  please never change  I m not the yellow cheese with mystery-ground-beef crunchy-taco type of girl  so it can be quite frustrating to try to find quality  tasty  authentic Mexican food in Austin. Licha s delivers in quality  flavor  price  atmosphere...it is delicious and so much fun  I am obsessed with their huaraches. Thank you Licha s  Please PLEASE keep up the good work 
Licha's Cantina,445,I had my birthday here yesterday  amp  they were SO accommodating  For being a small restaurant that doesn t take reservations  they were very nice to seat  amp  serve a party of 15 turned 20 and did so with genuine smiles.  I gave them a heads up a few days prior that we were coming if the rain held  and it did   And it was such a blast sitting at the huge table outside under the tree    We went for happy hour  amp  mostly ordered the small plates  amp  drinks from the HH menu. Everything was very delicious  bursting with bright  smoky  toasty  tangy  spicy  savory  amp  occasionally sweet flavors. The food is done just right. Our server ruled  amp  even tho he was probably a bit stressed  he hid it well  amp  looked like he might ve been enjoying himself  too    I definitely recommend this place on account of their food quality  yummy mezcal cocktails  location  and service    Thank you for starting the last of my 20 s bdays off to a lovely start  
Licha's Cantina,446,Came here tonight in a large group  9 of us  and they refused to split the check. After doing all of the math ourselves  we were greeted by the owner with a sort of accusatory demeanor. After trying to tip properly and pay what we owed  the owner refused to take the time to accommodate our confusion and told us just to leave. I feel like our integrity was questioned which I honestly do not appreciate. The food was fine  the service was not worth my time. Do yourself a favor and find a Mexican establishment elsewhere.
Licha's Cantina,447,Definitely my favorite brunch stop in Austin. Amazing drinks  great service  and fantastic food.
Licha's Cantina,448,The atmosphere at this place is just as amazing as the food. Had the red snapped  enough for two people to share. Great hang out spot  as it s an old house converted to a restaurant  make sure to check out the back patio 
Licha's Cantina,449,Wow  I hate waiting and this place is totally worth the wait. Best Mexican food I ve had outside Mexico City. Don t forget to try the ceviche and the snapper. Both are out of this world 
Licha's Cantina,450,Absolutely to die for.  The food was incredible and the house is adorable.  Incredibly strong drinks  delicious margarita.
Licha's Cantina,451,The air-conditioning didn t work and it was drippy hot  the service was poor and slow and the only information given on any food or drink was that it was all  amazingly delicious and top-notch  top-shelf   no descriptors  no help in understanding the menu or food. Almost everything came on a cake  which I thought might be a nice been or rice baee but instead it was like one week old inedible hard  compressed bread.  130 later the four of us left unsatisfied and still hungry.
Licha's Cantina,452,I loved this place  It was a half hour wait at 8 PM on a Tuesday  but I ordered a recommended Cantarito from the bar and enjoyed it outside in their patio area. The wait time went by quickly to say the least  Once seated  we ordered their guac and ceviche - MUST ORDER BOTH   My mouth is watering thinking about it the morning after. Our server Louis was wonderful and his recommendation for the Al Pastor was delicious. This is a must see place in Austin and will definitely want to come back one day.
Licha's Cantina,453,Wow had to stand in line before they opened.   The margaritas were good but not enough   small glasses.   Green salsa delicious.   Queso fundido good but not enough chorizo.   Beef was delicious.   Shining star in Austin   
Licha's Cantina,454,Quirky and charming place in East Austin. Took Yelp s suggestion for the watermelon and jalape o margarita  amp  it did not disappoint  and I loved that touch of mango on the ceviche. Will definitely come back 
Licha's Cantina,455,Review based only on Happy Hour  Best happy hour in town.  5 paloma with an amazing  5 blue corn hibiscus quesadilla and  5 bowl of esquites   I was happy dancing during my whole meal  Service was perfect and the ambiance was fun.
Licha's Cantina,456,Where do I start  For one  it is a very affected  hipster place with too much attitude. But shrouded in  authentic  Mexican ambiance  which apparently means lots of flies  minimal air conditioning  and a structure that appears to be 3 seconds from collapsing.  The food was  at best  average. I can only assume the flies were in agreement. I attempted to order food outside  and was told they didn t serve food outside  although I looked around and saw 4 tables eating food. I then went inside to the bar to order food and was told I had to eat it at the bar. Come again  I can t take the food 10 steps away to our table  Whatever. Then the manager decided to do me a favor and allow me to partake in mediocre food. The only thing is can say is   LICHA CANTINA  GET OVER YOURSELF.
Licha's Cantina,457,Licha s has incredible food  great drinks and friendly service.  Many traditional dishes done with spice and flavor to perfection. Great outdoor seating as well 
Licha's Cantina,458,Heard about this place from a friend and we were pleasantly surprised on how amazing the food was. From the time we were greeted at the door to leaving  the experience was incredible. We all got tacos of various kinds and could not say a bad thing about it. Very authentic with a twist and it was so good  The staff was very accommodating 
Licha's Cantina,459,Been wantin  to check this place out for a while  went on a Saturday night around 7 30  it was pretty packed but we were able to be sat down immediately inside of the cozy renovated house the restaurant is set in.  Got a cocktail  can t remember the name but it had grapefruit in it. Was good but boy I m such a lightweight  the tequila  which didn t even have a strong flavor  really hit me. My dining companion had a margarita  but they complained it had too much ice in it  they are a REAL stickler when it comes to margaritas mind you.  First of all  THEIR TORTILLA CHIPS ARE SO ADDICTING. They are so light and crispy you can t stop eating them  they do turn into crumbles at the bottom on the basket  but I was still munching on those. I was also starving when I came here. You get two different kinds of salsa  both tasty  but they were in small little containers  if you are the type of person you needs a lot of salsa for your chip consumption you might have to ask for more. We didn t.  We got the ceviche as an appetizer  fish tasted really fresh  could have used a little more lime citrusyness to balance out the sweetness from the mango though.  There were other things I wanted to try so badly  they do have many other little dishes that would be good to share as an appetizer  or instead of getting a bigger entree meal  just get a bunch of smaller things and share them. We just stuck with the ceviche.  I got the sandwich with the pibil. The waitress warned me it was a big sandwich and was also super-spicy but that did not phase me. It was a decent sized sandwich  and once I was about halfway through it  I did start to feel the heat  but I m used to really spicy foods so I ate the whole thing. It was very tasty but my mouth was burning after it all  not in a really unpleasant way  but if you aren t that big on spicy foods this might be too much for you. my dining companion got the tlacoyo with pibil which they enjoyed.  for dessert we got the tres leches cake. However it was not your typical  presentation  of a tres leches cake. It was a cube of cake in a cup filled with the sweet milk. So the flavors of a tres leches cake were there  but part of me would have preferred the classic  wedge of cake. The sweetness of it did help cool down my mouth though.  I d probably have to come back here a couple more times to try out everything on the menu  it all looked pretty good 
Licha's Cantina,460,Legit tex-mex on East 6th.  Good service.  Tall cold Tecate. No complaints.
Licha's Cantina,461,This place was great  Their  5 happy hour menu is delicious and has great portions. They have a spicy margarita which is tasty. The environment is laid back and friendly. The waitress was very nice and helped us with our questions about the dishes and what to order.
Licha's Cantina,462,3.5 stars  drinks didn t seem worth  10...not that strong and not that amazing. However  Free chips and salsa was nice and the service was good. The menu sounded pretty good as well but we didn t try anything other than guac. Nice outdoor seating as well.
Licha's Cantina,463,Licha s is outstanding  I can t think of a better place in Austin for Mexican food with the possible exception of Fonda San Miguel. The enmoladas de pato  i.e. roasted duck covered in mole  is out of this world and surprisingly affordable. WIN 
Licha's Cantina,464,Best happy hour ever... but don t tell anyone  I love their hh quesadillas and sopes. The house Rita is great. The paloma is great. The watermelon and jalapeno margarita was my favorite  I haven t been for anything other than happy hour  so I can t review the rest of the menu  but I plan on going back
Licha's Cantina,465,Yum      First of all if you re gluten free  you need to go here because um  you can eat everything   Well at least almost everything. Not the beer     Jalapeno watermelon margarita - refreshing  tasty  spicy and not too strong   Sopecitos - the chicken and pork were both tasty but the pork was SOO good.  TUETANO Huarache - YUM  FLOR DE JAMAICA Quesadilla - Oh so good  Who knew hibiscus flowers were good to eat     Sweet potato salad - A little odd but I liked it. The two people I was with were not so sure      The ceviche is made with grouper so it s pretty fishy  just fyi.   I want to try so much more   Our waitress was very nice and had lots of suggestions.
Licha's Cantina,466,We tried this place on the advice of our bartender at the Hotel Van Zandt. I would describe the atmosphere as  hole-in-the-wall chic  - lots of hip  young  tattooed staff in an old house.  I had the Steak Tampique o. The flavor was OK  but the meat was very fatty. The refried black beans were excellent. My experience was tainted by the fact that I either got food poisoning or a raging stomach virus the night I ate here. As one of my colleagues had the exact same meal  I m pretty sure it was a virus. However  thinking of that meal elicits a visceral reaction.
Licha's Cantina,467,Ahhhhhhmazing   I m mad I didn t find this little gem sooner  Our group went on a busy Tuesday  night and the wait staff  bar tender  and owner were wonderful about taking care of everyone   No one seemed rushed  always willing to take time and explain menu items or the back story of how this amazing food came to be.  Another extremely important perk   They understand gluten free   I have celiac and can t have gluten anywhere near me  which can make dining out difficult.  Every member of Licha s Cantina assured me I was in good hands and they were right   I was able to order almost anything off the menu  minus the sandwiches  and didn t have any problems.  Delicious  gluten free  wonderful service.  I can t wait to go back 
Licha's Cantina,468,The wait was really long and the food was just ok. Didn t satisfy our craving for Mexican food.
Licha's Cantina,469,Food was really good. Solid 4 stars on food. Service was slow and no offer from the waiter to split the check. On a  300 check on a Wednesday that s a poor enough experience that this will be a one and done for me.
Licha's Cantina,470,Great authentic Mexican food  Staff was really friendly and very accommodating for a large group of friends including those arriving late
Licha's Cantina,471,This place is great  Love at first bite. I live a few blocks away and walked over for dinner. So happy to have a yummy place like this in my neighborhood    Highlights   - Salsa  Green is amazing creamy and spicy. Red is sweet and mild heat. Both are delicious  - Sopes  I ordered the chicken ones to share as an app. They were very fresh and very flavorful  - Tacos  I ordered the al pastor and my boyfriend order some that were steak  bacon  and peppers. We both loved our dishes. The taco meat is served in a cute mini skillet and every thing came out piping hot. Lastly  the corn tortillas are freaking amazing. I feel like most restaurants treat corn tortillas like they re the red headed step-child. Here they put a lot of TLC in to making them and it comes out in the taste. -Service  The service here was fantastic  We always had full waters  our chips and salsa were never empty  and our waiter was very helpful and attentive.
Licha's Cantina,472,I am so happy  I finally found a Mexican place in Austin I can take friends and be proud     My friend and I sat on the patio and were excited to find it was still happy hour -- til SEVEN  which for an old lady like me means I show up for dinner and it s still happy hour -- yay for being unfashionable   We had a cocktail to start and they were magnificent.  I got something complicated because I was curious -- this idiotic way of ordering is my fatal flaw and usually leads me to be the queen of food envy.  Here at Licha s  my  oh I have to try this  drink was GOOD   Really good   Huge kudos to the bar staff for making fancy cocktails with exotic ingredients that actually taste wunderbar.  OK onto the food.  My friend and I decided to play it simple and go with tacos.  I love crazy food  she likes it simple  but we loved both the pork and the beef.  High quality meat and great flavors and they were purty.  Can t go wrong.  The chocolate pot au creme looked like it came from a little bakery in it s little plastic cup. -- I was not sure if it really did or they were being cutesy.  I had a bite and quit caring because IT WAS GOOD.  The only negative was the esquite  it was sweet and no where near fatty enough.  I want it to taste like it came off a truck at a street fair 10 years ago before they had fancy food trucks  maybe the restaurant was going for a different consumer then me  ha   I see another reviewer said they used sweet corn  maybe that is part of the problem but it needs more fat  hello mayo    more spice and less sweet.  The service was super friendly and welcoming -- like you wonder if they think you are someone else  that kind of sincere welcoming.  I m on my way back this week and my mouth is already watering 
Licha's Cantina,473,Two words to describe this place.........F cking Delicious.   Daniel.......keep doing what you re doing.   Now every time I see a Saint Candle.....my mouth starts to water.
Licha's Cantina,474,Let me start off by saying the food here rocks. The flavors are amazing and the atmosphere  should  be awesome. That is  if the waiter didn t come over mid-meal and take away the sun umbrella I had just moved myself  from the other side of our table  to give us some shade  leaving us baking in the sun. I asked WTF and he said  this other table is more exposed in the sun than you guys are . Seriously  So move their table if they have a problem. Don t interrupt our fantastic meal by making us bake in the sun when we ve been here for nearly an hour and are mid-meal. We asked for an umbrella back and were told they were out. Every single other table has an umbrella besides ours now. Wow  really disappointed the waiter ruined our entire experience at a place that should be 4  stars based on food and  normal  ambiance.
Licha's Cantina,475,Food is ok. Drinks are ok. Nice little spot and comfortable atmosphere. Not sure I will be returning but I m glad I went at least once.
Licha's Cantina,476,Ambiance was great but the food not . Gorditas was terribly bad .  My husband Vegan food was okay .Service was very bad.
Licha's Cantina,477,I came here for a birthday brunch over the weekend and was pretty disappointed with the service. They do not seem to care much about their customers.   I had called before we arrived to see if they took reservations  and was told they do not. Because we had 9 people  we arrived right as they opened at 11am to get seated quickly. We were the first people into the restaurant.  We asked if we could sit inside  as it was hot outside   and they told us that there was no room for 9 people inside. I understand it is a small place  but we were literally the only people in the restaurant at that point. They informed us they only had 2 large tables outside to accommodate 9 people  and to pick one. Both were pretty exposed to the sun  and once again  it was a hot day. We chose one  and within 15 minutes everyone was sweating and half the table was in the direct sun. If you re going to demand that larger parties sit outside  at least have adequate shade at each table.  On top of that  the service was very slow. It took us 15 minutes to get our waters out  and over 10 minutes each time to just get a mimosa  which were extremely weak  by the way . The servers would also come back to the table and take drink orders and other requests from some people  but completely neglect other. The waiters showed no sense of urgency and were unfriendly.  The food itself was pretty good  but unfortunately due to the service and bad accommodations with the seating  everyone was ready to go. It really put a damper on the birthday event. I don t have a desire to return anytime soon.
Licha's Cantina,478,Three Takeaways    1  Once you go you will like it...and want to go back for lunch...but they aren t open    2  I ve been about three times now  it is a unique combination to find good mexican food that is affordable on the price point  And the drinks are delicious.  3  Eat more beef tongue. Your stomach will thank you later.
Licha's Cantina,479,We walked by on our way to somewhere else   but decided to circle back. My fiance and I are very glad we did  Brunch on the patio was lovely  and the food was delicious. The mimosas were great - perfect mix of champagne and juice  not too much juice  .
Licha's Cantina,480,This is easily one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants I ve been to. Their margaritas were made with fresh ingredients and they definitely didn t skimp on the alcohol. I had the aguacate sopesitos and my boyfriend had the cochinita pibil pambazo. They were both delicious  The service and atmosphere were great. We had an hour wait and it was for sure worth it. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for great Mexican food 
Licha's Cantina,481,One of my favorite happy hours in Austin. Amazing food and drinks for the price  in a cute setting to boot. Good stuff.
Licha's Cantina,482,Great place on one of my last stops for sxsw . Had bands playing in both front and back   food was highly recommended and even though menu was limited and they were busy was very impressed . Bartenders were great with handling the volume of customers . The little one with glasses and the guy with those huge shiny plugs were a great team  Definitely will be back when we visit Austin again thanks for the great time lichas  
Licha's Cantina,483,So yeah  another painful hipster  impression  of a legit Mexican experience. Pretentious  combative staff  poor service and average food - oh and lots and lots of flies everywhere. Nice work kids - back to the drawing board.
Licha's Cantina,484,Yaaaaaaas. This place is delicious.  I can t pronounce half the stuff and could barely even tell you what most of it is  but there s homemade corn tortillas and cakes and bowls and they are topped with a unique blend of meats  cheeses  spices  and all other manner of tastiness. I ve literally tried almost everything on the menu at this point and cannot say enough good things. I ve been going on a lot of dates lately  and I feel like I m always dragging a guy over there. You re welcome  Licha s  for all the extra business.  The service has been great and knowledgeable  the chips are local  the salsas are yummy  the espresso is good  they have decaf    and the desserts are good as well  not made there but still local .
Licha's Cantina,485,Found this place online... LOVED iT  The food was amazing  especially the Carne Deshevrada con chile cascabel   so was the service  If you go between 4-7 there  it s happy hour even on Saturday.
Licha's Cantina,486,I have been here quite a few times for happy hour and every time I love everything I get. The food is delicious and the drinks are great too. HH prices are awesome with a whole menu of food and drinks for  5   Can t beat that  Service is always friendly and helpful too. Couldn t ask for a better place to hang out with friends and enjoy a beautiful Austin day.
Licha's Cantina,487,Unique and great Latin American cuisine. We had Huaraches champi ons and some out of this world appetizer dip. Service is slow and the table settings are cheapo but the dishes are excellent and different in a town where cheese enchiladas are so common.
Licha's Cantina,488,Sat at the bar and had a phenomenal meal with great service. We had excellent horchatas to drink - one with a shot of espresso the other plain. The bartender said they make it fresh there.  Recommend the ceviche and queso with grilled mushrooms. Everything was homemade and fresh.
Licha's Cantina,489,No doubt one or the best happy hours in East Austin. Bartenders are friendly and drinks are cheap and strong. Love how their menu prominently features mezcal  including one of the happy hour choices .   I dig the atmosphere. Doesn t get much more Austin than this place.   While I m not doggin  on traditional Tex-Mex fare  oogles of melty cheese  lots of fried stuff   Licha s delicious and fresh fare leans more toward  interior  Mexican cuisine with succulent duck and unique takes on vegetarian dishes.   Be sure to not miss the much larger seating area in the back -- which is where you ll want to sit if you re with a large group.
Licha's Cantina,490,Try everything      Wow this is crazy good. Good food  drinks  and killer service. Winning combo.
Licha's Cantina,491,Best margaritas in Austin. Their food is so good  try the gorditas or flatbreads . Expect a wait  but it s typically not as long as they say it will be and you can grab a drink st the bar and sit outside in the front or back.
Licha's Cantina,492,First time in the city and so glad I stayed in East Austin because I was close to this place. The happy hour is awesome   5 cocktails  delicious  and  5 appetizers  heaven . The vibe of the place is very laid back and I loved the back area. Reminded me of a vacation in Mexico. I ll definitely be back next time I m in town 
Licha's Cantina,493,This is probably one of my favorite Mexican food places in Austin. Plus many gluten free options for those us with that annoying issue. And of course you have to have a margarita or two 
Licha's Cantina,494,Nice atmosphere but the good  that I had  was absolutely awful. The guacamole was so bland I didn t even bother finishing it which rarely happens with guac. I ordered the brisket salad - my God was this gross. The salad looked and tasted like it was prepared the week before. The brisket was the worst I have ever had and the salad was so soggy it was in a pool of liquid. Really terrible experience.
Licha's Cantina,495,Very quiet  romantic spot sitting in their patio sipping crafty cocktails and inhaling the amazing chips and homemade salsas. We have made this our go to dinner spot  or weekend happy hour destination. Service was spot on with Amy tonight  Try the duck plate smothered in mole  
Licha's Cantina,496,Excellent. Loved the place  the service and the food. Drinks were not as good as everything else but were still okay.
Licha's Cantina,497,Terrific Happy Hour Prices.  Great Food and an awesome eclectic crowd.   I had the Paloma margarita...super tasty.  The queso with chorizo was awesome and the tacos with beef and bacon was fabulous    It s hard to find if you aren t watching for it  but the food  drinks and service were terrific 
Licha's Cantina,498,Like so many others  I love this place. It s got a great atmosphere  and the food is excellent all around. We ve had so many wonderful dishes here  I couldn t name them all. Their major problem is that you sometimes have to wait forever for a table and they don t take reservations. Go on an off-night and forget about the weekends  unless you arrive before six p.m.
Licha's Cantina,499,After having moved away from Austin 14 years ago  I have returned for only two days on a business trip to find this place way bigger  but still much the same. I found a great AirBnB place to stay in East Austin that is only two blocks from Licha s. So I walked there for dinner after seeing Licha s reviews on Yelp.   Upon entering I was greeted by a relaxing atmosphere with local folks gathering with friends. I took a seat at the bar and asked the friendly bartender for the most popular drink. I was served a tasty watermelon jalapeno margarita.   After finishing the drink and tasty chips with two salsas I asked the bartender to please order me two of Licha s food offerings I can t get anywhere else. I was soon greeted by outstanding Lengua Sopacitos and a Huitlacoche Queasadilla. They were both incredibly tasting and unique. Both had a tasty mix of meats and veggies prepared in a way I am not at all used to but loved.   To cap off my meal  I ordered an incredible 7 Machas Mezcal drink. It may now be my favorite drink of all time.   By the way  I arrived at 6 45PM which meant everything but my final drink was happy hour prices 
Licha's Cantina,500,Really good food. Tacos come with the filling in a skillet  with huge portions and fresh homemade  tortillas. Reasonably priced with great service and an amazing patio. Austin at it s finest 
Velvet Taco,1,I ll start this by saying that the tacos are as close to a traditional taco as a sandwich is to a hotdog. Sure  they have the same basic form and include some of the same ingredients  but that s where the similarities end.  That being said  it absolutely works  These are some of the best taco shaped meals I ve ever had  and are legitimately delicious. So far I haven t had a bad one  though I definitely have my favorites.  If you re in the area  absolutely give them a shot.
Velvet Taco,2,Velvet Taco has some pretty good eats  but the overall richness of some of the dishes are a bit intense and you wonder if there is a way for them to ease up on the spice and heaviness.   This review was for a to-go order that placed at the establishment and then took back to my hotel. Everything was packed well and tasted fresh. I had the queso which was just so heavy it was rather difficult to consume. I think the flavor was fine  but they need to ease up on the salt. Same for the taco I had. It tasted fine  but I couldn t even finish one taco because it was just so overwhelming.  If you are looking for over the top  decadent food  I think Velvet Taco delivers in that department  but it s so rich and oily that I have a few bites then I m ready to throw the towel in.
Velvet Taco,3,Austin is well know for tacos and with endless combinations  it s amazing to be creative. Velvet taco has awesome flavors  strong  pungent  and defined flavors. One of the best flavored tacos in town but sometimes you have to compare the price vs value vs size of the tacos. The Kobe taco has an amazing burger flavor  burger patty chopped  lettuce  tomatoes  thin pickles  and a great 1000 island sauce. Nice burger taco.   The salmon was fresh  grilled flakey meat with nice crunchy vegetable toppings. Mixed with the corn tortilla  nice salmon taco but it did lack a little bit of flavor biting into the taco. The salmon I would say needs a more crispy exterior and more seasoning.   Flavors 10 10 Value 6 10 Price ugh 4 10  For 2 tacos   17 is really steep I get the value and the higher quality of food but I ate each taco in 3 bites and I m still hungry. It s petite sized interior stuffed tacos but it just needs more food inside  more vegetables  more meat  more everything for me look at both the Kobe beef and Salmon tacos for  17.
Velvet Taco,4,There are yummy tacos at Velvet Taco   A large group of us stopped in and got almost one of everything- my favorites were the mexi-cali shrimp taco  plump shrimp seasoned perfectly   the fish and chips taco  and the chips and queso  perfectly spicy for me .  We also got a slice of the velvet cake to go. Delicious   Definitely worth a stop when you re shopping at The Domain.
Velvet Taco,5,Tacos are okay. Good flavors. Dirty tables everywhere. Tacos are way overpriced.  Chick   Spicy Tikka Chicken - 3 5  WTF   Gumbo - 3 5  Tacos are mostly filler  rice and tortilla. Very little protein. The gumbo taco was tasty but had two tiny shrimp and a few pieces of sausage. All for about  7 a taco with taxes and tip. Same with the Tikka chicken  all rice and two tiny chicken tenders. The tables have food and junk all over them. Doesn t look like anyone cleans the front of the house.
Velvet Taco,6,One of my top favorite taco places  I frequent Velvet Taco several times a month. Everything I ve tried here has been incredible. My go-to menu items lately have been the Chicken Tikka taco and the tater tot app dish with the fried egg. Omg - mouthwatering goodness
Velvet Taco,7,First  thank you Jacob for helping this first timer  Everything was dynamite  I went for three different pink tacos  love the innuendo btw .  The Mexi Cal Shrimp taco was the first to go down. Nice heat  creamy and the corn salsa was perfect. Th micro greens and cilantro added a nice lil crunch.   The Korean Fried Rice was second to bat. The marinated onions really popped  the jalape o added a great bite and hit of heat . The meat and rice mixed together nicely with the toppings. Next time I was dit into this one first so the sauce doesn t mess with the integrity of the tortilla.  Last but not least  I saved it because I love Indian flavors... drum  roll... Tikka chicken. The sauce was perfectly spicy and the chicken had a great breading the crunch. The basil and cream sauce on top added a subtle flavor that left the spot light for the tikka.   Well done folks.
Velvet Taco,8,As a Latina  Mexican  I love tacos. I love exploring the different twists that cooks have with tacos. My sister found this taco place at the Domain. At first glance  I thought the place looked chill  good atmosphere. Pretty loud. I ordered their WTF taco  which is their weekly taco that s featured on the menu.   TBH  disappointed. The tacos lacked flavor. It was just missing the  it  factor for me. Also  the price was pretty steep.  18 for two tacos. INSANE.  I would personally never suggest this place. I see the hype with it but for the price  customer service  or lack thereof  and taste  I would not come back.
Velvet Taco,9,Velvet Taco has easily become one of my go-to places for creative  fun  and consistently good tacos  Are they your traditional   authentic  Mexican-style tacos  No  But no one comes here expecting that. They have a wide variety of innovative  fun tacos  including a weekly taco feature  WTF  that is a special  one-week only taco  This week s was a Hawaiian Poke taco  and being a huge fan of poke bowls and sushi  I had to get it.  My absolute go-to taco that I always include in my order is their fan-favorite Tikka Chicken taco. I switch up my order based on what I m in the mood for  you honestly can t go wrong with any taco   but the Tikka one is a must.  The margaritas are also tasty  And their signature dessert  red velvet cake  is so good. It s just cake  but theirs is incredibly moist and comes with a drizzled sauce. Chips and queso is also a hit   I love everything on the menu  their loyalty rewards program  and it s a perfect week night  or weekend  dinner spot for a casual  laidback vibe with awesome food. They re also open super late which is nice  And there s a little something for everyone on their menu.
Velvet Taco,10,This place is the best. If you can t find a taco you like on this menu then you re the problem. So many options and everything is good. Don t sleep on the tater tot s with an egg on top  that s one of my favorite things. They re loaded to the max as well are the tacos. It s a small spot so you may sit at the other end of someone s table. It s awesome and everyone is always friendly inside there. You can also see other people s tacos that way.
Velvet Taco,11,Is it just me or everyone is experiencing this    From past 2.5 years I have been in Austin and pretty regular at Velvet Taco at Domain. The cake s quality is getting worse every time I am getting it. And look at the quantity of the sweet sauce they gave  it s almost like they should stop giving - it won t even cover my whole cake even if I drizzle over. And yes the melted icing - they have given me as is. I tried calling them  nobody picked up. I miss good velvet cake with enough sauce to go over full cake. Please send some help
Velvet Taco,12,I m finally a fan of tacos   Prior to traveling to Texas whenever my husband suggested tacos  I d be like  meh  not interested.  Then I reluctantly take a  business  trip to Austin and I m eating tacos every meal of every day.  Breakfast tacos  who knew that was a thing  . Torchy s tacos for lunch  Velvet Tacos for dinner   Their Beer battered cauliflower tacos and fish tacos were out of this world.  Like where have these tacos been all my life   Not in Hawaii or NYC or anywhere in Asia.  I still wouldn t ever move to Texas  not a chance   but next time I have to visit this hot sweaty state  I m definitely coming back here for tacos  and street corn  
Velvet Taco,13,Oh my - the tacos here are sublime.  I had a trio  mexi-cali shrimp  flank steak  and rotisserie chicken   and loved the flavor combos.  They are not authentic tacos by far - but they are delicious and there was some thought really put into the flavor profiles.
Velvet Taco,14,Honestly not the best tacos I ve had in Austin  and there are far better options.  That being said  I think it s about what you would expect from a taco place in The Domain.  For context  the best tacos I ve had in Austin are from taco trucks on the side of the road  this experience was just ok.  The positive I d say is that there are very unique taco options.  The best one I had was the Chicken and Waffles taco  but the rest were just alright  and they didn t have the pork for the Korean Fried Rice taco so they had to substitute it for other meat.  Also  it may have just been the time of day  but it was extremely hot inside and there were no fans on the inside  just outside.  I think it d be a good idea to run the A C in the summer especially when there are families with children or people that bring their dogs inside.  Even the barbecue places I ve been to in Austin during the summer keep their inside temperature much lower during the day  despite having a smoker that I am sure creates quite a bit of heat.
Velvet Taco,15,Convenient especially if you re shopping at the Domain or if you need a late night snack.   What I loved about this place was that it was a quirky ambiance and they had tacos from all around the world. Each taco is double the size of a taco from a food truck and can be shared between two people. Get the chicken tikka taco  it was my favorite   Every item has fresh ingredients  but the authenticity of the flavor and spices aren t  quite there of the cuisine each taco is trying to copy - which is why I gave this restaurant four stars.
Velvet Taco,16,Quirky and eclectic tacos. It s not a traditional Taco joint. They re a little more upscale and try to mix different cuisines in each taco. They pull it off. Mostly.   Queso and chips are outstanding   Chicken Tikka is crazy good. Delicious Indian flavors in a tasty taco.   Carne Asad was okay but lacking enough meat. It was a pretty skimpy taco.   Fish and Chips taco was the same. Lacking a big piece of fish. Two bites and you re left with an empty tortilla.   That was the only knock on this place. The portions in the tortilla were quite small.   Chicken and waffles was tasty.   Service was friendly.
Velvet Taco,17,Looong line on a Saturday for lunch... But it was worth it  I can t believe how good the margs are. I m usually pretty picky. They are up there with my favorite in Austin  The food was fresh and yummy. I will definitely be back 
Velvet Taco,18,Velvet Taco does all the tacos and does them very well. The menu is full of a plethora of creative and unique taco selections. I loved the Buffalo chicken and grilled steak tacos but wanted to try so many more. The queso is also spot on. Counter service is quick and convenient. I will absolutely be back as I feel the strong desire to try every single taco on the menu during my lifetime. Much love to Velvet Taco. Thanks for bringing some taco joy to the Domain.
Velvet Taco,19,Stopped by Domain on our trip to Austin and had to check out the famous velvet taco. We tried the Kobe beef taco and the chicken and waffle taco. Both were excellent  The Kobe beef one was like a high quality cheeseburger wrapped in a soft tortilla. The red velvet cake and the drinks also looked really tempting and we ll be back to try them on our next trip here 
Velvet Taco,20,I have not experienced taco greatness until coming here  They have a lot of really inventive tacos that really hit  and I especially appreciate all the vegetarian options. The fried tofu is amazing  even if you eat meat   statement verified by boyfriend who eats meat  as is the mexi cali shrimp. Buffalo chicken is amazing. Queso is also great and a good portion. Apparently the margs are also good. Definitely come back if you re in the austin area.
Velvet Taco,21,We had a great lunch  comfortable atmosphere   Good price for the amazing quality of food   Tacos are very full of delicious topping of your choice    Ranch water. Spot on  Ice cold beer. Great friendly service And the elote is so good  
Velvet Taco,22,When I first saw Velvet Taco  my initial thought was...  Oh great. Another sub-par taco fusion. Here we go again   However  the line was long  which is usually a good sign  so we decided to give it a try.   My family came with me and we loved EVERY. TACO. The chicken  amp  waffle and paneer were our favorites  Excited to go back and try more   The queso and chips was good but beware - it s small 
Velvet Taco,23,I pride myself on knowing a good taco when I see  and taste  one. I also love the recent explosion of fusion-inspired menus mixing flavors  styles and cultures into creative and delicious combinations.   Velvet tacos does an exceptional job bringing flavors from across the globe into a folded piece of corn or flour    From Korean fried rice topped with chutney and jalape o slices  to chicken tikka masala with a creamy reita-inspired sauce... I couldn t get enough. So I tried more.   The chicken and waffle taco has a slightly sweet maple syrup flavor and the  taco shell  is a light and airy waffle. So creative    I think my favorite was the angus... in a flour cheese tortilla that had just the right crispness... the angus was cooked to perfection  just a hint of pink in the middle of the larger chunks . So good    My only complaint is that there were too many options for me to try them all  If I m ever in Austin again  I ll definitely be back    Someone in my party had the Elote and chips and those were delicious as well.   Come before the lunch rush as the line goes out the door 
Velvet Taco,24,I flew from Cali to Austin to visit my friends for a weekend and the first place they brought me to was Velvet Taco. These tacos are definitely not your typical taco  These tacos are much bigger and the types of tacos they have show that they re trying to do flavors from around the world.   For starters I got the red coconut curry queso and the frozen margarita. The queso was not too salty  I don t see how the thai basil really added much to the queso besides color contrast. I also couldn t really taste any coconut curry flavor notes  just primarily the cheesy queso. The frozen margarite hit just the spot on that hot  sunny day.  For the tacos  I had the spicy chicken tikka and slow-roasted angus brisket taco. These were such interesting flavor combos for both tacos  and both surprised me in how they tasted    I want to come back next time to eventually try all their signature tacos 
Velvet Taco,25,Can we first talk about how functional their takeout boxes are   Wish every taco place did this   Taste is 5 5. Try the beer battered cauliflower  green Chile pork and chicken tikka tacos. The flavors blended really well. They had rice in the tacos. I ve not really tried that combination but boy  did it the flavors blend so well  They WILL NOT DISAPPOINT. The jalape o queso was amazing  The panned tikka was a 3 5. The elote corn queso felt a little too buttery.
Velvet Taco,26,If you re looking for traditional Mexican tacos  this is not your spot. They describe themselves as  a funky taco spot creating international flavors.  Their tacos are certainly inventive  inspired by flavors that you wouldn t find in a typical taco joint  such as a spicy tikka chicken taco  a Korean fried rice taco  or a Buffalo chicken taco. Their menu is split up by the type of protein  they have beef  chicken  pork  fish  and veggie options. I ve tried their green chile pork taco  which comes with tomatillo corn stewed pork  avocado  mayo crema  queso fresco  pickled fresnos  cilantro rice  salsa verde  and cilantro  on a corn tortilla. I ve also had their grilled flank steak taco  which comes with portobello  queso blanco  grilled red onion  and oregano on a corn tortilla. I thought these tacos were good  but not great. I can think of better and more affordable taco spots in Austin. All in all  it s a solid spot to grab food in the Domain  especially for those who want to try inventive tacos  as long as you go in knowing you re paying Domain prices and you won t be getting the best tacos in Austin.
Velvet Taco,27,TLDR  Really good food  but rather inconvenient for what you re getting.  Came here with a decently large group for lunch last week. Understandably  there are going to be issues with any lunch rush  but there are some things to note regardless. Parking was an annoying issue  taking 5-10 minutes for each group to find spots  and none being convenient. Also  there were no open tables inside  so weather should be taken into account. Neither of these things I can really blame Velvet Taco for. My one real complaint is that all of our food was served together  which ended up taking a decent amount of time to shuffle everything around so everyone could get what they ordered. I get they are trying to push food out as fast as possible  but this was really inconvenient.   Now on to the food. I got the Cuban Pig and the tater tots and egg. The Cuban pig was a bit of a let down. I expected a taco form of a cubano  but the flavors were all wrong. It wasn t  bad  in and of itself  but tasted nothing like what I was expecting. The tater tots were amazing though  and more than made up for the lackluster taco. If you come here  definitely get the tater tots. Overall  would never come here with a group again  but not a bad spot for a lunch bite. overall  3 5.
Velvet Taco,28,Good was good and the quantity was pretty good too.  The indoor tabletops were a bit grimy - outside seating area ambiance was a lot better.
Velvet Taco,29,Took all the veggie tacos. I liked all of them. The wife didn t dig it much. It definitely is pretty crowded but the service is very fast.  It is more a fast food place than a full fledged dinner place unless you order 3-4 per person. That is why they price by one taco each.
Velvet Taco,30,My favorite taco place in TEXAS. I have tried several taco places and none have come close to velvet tacos. If you are looking for traditional tacos - look else where. Here you will find amazing fusion tacos that will fill your mouth with flavors.  We ordered the chicken tikka taco  shrimp and grits taco  nashville hot chicken taco  yes they allow you to mix and match protein and their sauce   falafel taco  beer battered cauliflower taco  nashville hot tofu taco. Honestly we loved them all but the chicken taco was next level delicious. We stopped byt several times during our trip to Austin since we craved their Chicken tikka taco. It is the best and so authentic the chicken tikka masala with the basmati rice is so flavorful. We also ordered their red velvet cake which is heavenly and tastes so fresh. What we loved about Velvet tacos - they have a huge variety of tacos for our vegetarian friends as well. They do have hot sauces around but honestly the sauce on the taco itself is so delicious  you dont need anything to elevate the flavors.  This place is huge with ample indoor and outdoor seating. This place can get pretty crowded at any hour but the line moves fast. Highly recommend trying out Velvet taco while visiting Texas. I so wish they open up a place in Seattle.
Velvet Taco,31,I ve been here two times and I think some people would say it s overpriced but I think the tacos are pretty good and pretty value. I ordered the Tikka Chicken taco and the Korean fried Rice taco. I really enjoyed the tikka chicken  it wasn t too spicy but still had a kick curry flavor that was really good. The Korean Fried Rice taco also had a pretty special flavor  I liked the pickled onions -- kind of unexpected but added a well needed sweetness to this taco. Total for 2 tacos was  11.  I would definitely recommend and will probably come back 
Velvet Taco,32,A great place with tons of unique tacos. I ordered the chicken  amp  waffles and Korean fried rice. I didn t particularly enjoy the chicken  amp  waffles one but I think it was because I wasn t a fan of the sweet from the maple syrup paired with the savoriness of the rest of the taco. I would ve also preferred a regular flour tortilla as opposed to the waffle tortilla. Now the Korean fried rice was on another level. The pork was so tender and so flavorful  I was really sad when I took my last bite and the taco was gone.  Velvet is on the pricer side for tacos  but it is in a really trendy area of the Domain   they have interesting and unique spins on tacos.
Velvet Taco,33,6 stars please  Just omg...  Ask no questions. Go. Order. Eat. Repeat.   11 30pm on a Saturday after Rose Bar just across the way... I ordered the chicken and waffle  fried paneer and spicy tikka fish tacos. Thought I would just taste a small bite of each so as not to go to sleep on a full stomach  gives me weird and long dreams   avoid heart burn and do the responsible thing for my hips. After the first bite  I fully embraced the idea of having crazy  uninterpretable dreams  popping Pepcid for a few days and undoing all the hard work from my 5 30am classes and intermittent fasting. These little pieces of heaven on earth were worth every single bite. You only live once and these crunchy  gravy topped angels should without a doubt be a part of your story.   Thank me later 
Velvet Taco,34,When you hear Austin you may immediately think of live music  BBQ or bats... but who knew this college town had a hidden gem selling stuffed tortillas     What the locals call taco s   tah - koh-s   is quite the treat for a lunch option on a Friday afternoon.  The variety of taco fillings is almost as diverse as the beverage station featuring a number of flavored cokes  teas and water.  They are quite brazen in their marketing  promoting WTF at every opportunity  which didn t sit well with our groups religious appetite for the swears.  That and the in store people flow are the only thing that held this delicious meal from a 5 star review.    I would recommend Velvet Taco for lunch with a group but would not for a youth group gathering or date.
Velvet Taco,35,Nice little place right on the corner. Liked the flavours and ambience. Definitely worth a visit 
Velvet Taco,36,Absolutely love this place. Number 3  and number 17 or my regular go to s.  Family makes me drop in whenever we are near.  The staff rocks here 
Velvet Taco,37,Maybe a 2.9 star.  I tried all the vegetarian taco.. paneer  cauliflower  tofu.  The sauces are great  but couldn t differentiate the main cheese protein tofu.  I saw the falafel. Small pieces wrapped in lettuce.  It was a 3 average but the inaccurate wait time dropped it a bit.  I ordered online since the line was long. And the actual order came 15-25 minutes after estimated time.  May not worth coming on a busy weekend... Or trying again.
Velvet Taco,38,I wish I had a picture of our tacos  They were absolutely delicious    We had the Spicy Tika  Green Chile Pork  Grilled Flank Steak  and their weekly special  steak and chorizo  and they were all amazing   The only one that didn t shine as much as the others was the Grilled Flank Steak. It was still good  but I would consider that as just a  run of the mill standard  steak taco. Not saying that it is bad by any means  just the other three had a huge  WOW  factor that just really took the tastebuds by storm  IMO     I am ready to go back and try others    10 10 - it was quite hot humid in the building  however they have a lovely patio with fans and it is in a great location to catch a breeze   You won t be disappointed you tried it 
Velvet Taco,39,I lived in the domain for about 6 months during the beginning of the pandemic. Velvet Taco got me through most days  While taking my dog on a walk I d stop in a grab an elote. One evening my spouse and I decided to try a frozen margarita and man were we feeling great  I highly recommend the fried paneer  One time they even gave me a free slice of red velvet cake. They drizzle it with caramel sauce and as I am writing this I am drooling lol. I crave their cake all the time  They are open late which is nice.
Velvet Taco,40,Normally has delish food  lots of close great parking  and great service. Normal a great choice for taco Tuesday solo or with a group. Great if you want to dine inside or sit outside. Dog friendly  especially outside .   Got here at 7 40 pm on 8 7 21. Parking was plentiful in the red garage and surrounding areas. My order was taken at 7 44pm.   I ordered red curry coconut queso  middle piece red velvet cake   15 grilled salmon taco medium rare  and a frozen margarita with salt.   The queso was half the amount I have been served previously at this location and at the downtown location. When I inquired about it  josh rudely let me know that this is the appropriate measurement of queso. Today s queso was lumpy and chunky with a burntish taste. The chips were also super greasy. Normally the queso has been a creamy texture consistency.  I did not receive the middle piece red velvet cake. Instead I got  an end piece  placed upside down in the to go box. The icing ended up stuck on one side of the box since it was upside down.    The salmon taco was very well done  cold  hard and tasted reheated.   The margarita did not have salt as requested.   When I asked for to go containers  an employee was dismissive and walked away. I did not get her name but she had pink highlights in her hair. Fortunately josh got me what I needed.   When I asked another employee about the specific names of who had served us  josh came out shortly after and wished us a great night.   The pros  Ample parking  prompt service  today the tables were wiped clean both inside and outside at this location.  I have them a 3 5 because this is the second time in a row that I have received rude customer service at this location. It is also the second time I have gotten cold  hard  salmon.    I have also received great customer service several times at this location in the past. So  customer service is hit or miss at this location.   The downtown location has consistent great customer service  fresh salmon  fresh soft cake  and consistent on portions and full servings. The only downside with the downtown location is parking.
Velvet Taco,41,We loved the elote and nacho appetizer  glad we tried it because the queso wasn t ready and in the process we discovered something different. The tacos and red velvet cake were just okay though. We tried two of the shrimp tacos of which the Mex-Cali was delicious while the Shrimp and grits was just okay  we regretted getting two of that one. The salmon taco was delicious while the paneer one wasn t great especially with that huge tomato in the middle. The red velvet cake was okay with the caramel sauce but the frosting didn t taste like the usual red velvet cream cheese frosting at all.
Velvet Taco,42,Who doesn t love tacos  Velvet is on the pricier side for tacos but I d say they are also pretty big. Their ingredients are very good and I like to stick to the basics.   I ve tried some of their more fancy unique tacos in the past and didn t find them that good so am a big fan of sticking to what you know with them. Also takes them a little longer to cook than your average taco place. I d say a 15 min wait from when you order so just a heads up.
Velvet Taco,43,Tried their takeout tonight. I had the beer-battered cauliflower taco and the Buffalo chicken taco. Both were very tasty. I would have liked a little more filling in the cauliflower taco-I am allergic to avocado and pepitas and so asked for those to be left off  so I guess that s why it looked a little slim. But the flavors were great  We also ordered elotes with chips and those were also fantastic  My husband enjoyed his tacos  too  slow-roasted angus brisket taco and a rotisserie chicken tacos . We ll definitely go back and try others. I want to try a margarita on the patio - it looks cute 
Velvet Taco,44,Best tacos i ve ever had   I wish they had something like this in LA.    Came on an anniversary trip with my boyfriend and we stopped by at the Domain and tried these tacos. Best decision we ve ever made.   We ordered 5 tacos  spicy tikka chicken  buffalo chicken  chicken and waffle  korean fried rice  fish and chips   elote corn  and a frozen kiss ass margarita.   The food was delicious  Each taco had its own unique flavor and tasted amazing. The chicken and waffle had to be my favorite. so definitely recommend trying that one when you go  The frozen margarita was so refreshing  especially on a humid day. They weren t stingy with the alcohol either  so definitely worth it for the price   Will definitely be back here next time I visit Austin   
Velvet Taco,45,I m not used to these types of tacos. Is this considered Tex-Mex tacos  I ve tried tacos like these a couple of times in texas and I guess they are just not something I m into.   We ordered six tacos and dessert and this is my personal thoughts on each    Buffalo taco  I was really excited for this but ended up only having one bite. The buffalo chicken was great but the blue cheese and sauce tasted like throw up to me. It s an acquired taste I guess  and I think it would have been perfect with just the chicken and hot sauce.   Rotisserie chicken taco  great  I d order again  Chicken and waffle  interesting twist  I dig   Korean fried rice  interesting concoction  not bad  Grilled flank steak  my fav. No crazy surprises   Slow roasted angus brisket  this sounded so good but it had a really weird after-taste or after smell of armpit. I couldn t take more than one bite. I have no clue what ingredients could make that after taste but i couldn t handle it   Red velvet cake  the best thing we had from here. Not too sweet  it was perfect.   Overall  if you stick to the safe options  the food is a solid 3.5 stars  especially if you get the cake. But if you experiment with some tacos that you re just not into  you might not be satisfied with your meal  but the cake makes up for it.
Velvet Taco,46,The food and drinks were amazing   you only need two margaritas   anything more will have you sleeping lol .
Velvet Taco,47,Super yummy tacos  Located in a hip area surrounded by unique restaurants and shops. We got here on a Sunday am around 11ish and made it just in time before the crowds. They have a nice covered patio dining area with plenty of large fans to help keep you cool.  Ordered a few tacos- brisket  picnic chicken  green chili pork .... Sooo deelish  They re a decent size and each bite is flavorful. Easy to eat a couple of them. I ll have to come back here next time I m in the area 
Velvet Taco,48,Fantastic    Just landed in Austin and a friend recommended this place.  I had a special taco of the week   el pastor or something  and the Shrimp .  Both where amazing.  If I lived here I would come back ALL the time 
Velvet Taco,49,We are so blessed to have the most amazing Tacos here in the Austin area. Just when I think I found THE BEST taco place  there s another one to one up and take it to another level. My new all time fav now is Velvet Taco.  Get your napkins ready. Time to chow down on these delicious messy tacos   What I ordered  Elote  gluten free  and  vegan  corn. This side is a bit on the heavy side with lots of queso but that s what makes it sauncy and flavorful. Ingredients are - corn with queso listo  Valentina  crema  queso fresco  lime.  Falafel Taco  It s spicy  tangy  crispy and super tasty  If you like falafel  you ll especially love this - tahini crema  arugula  tomato  pickled fresnos  avocado  pickled red onion  pea tendrils  lettuce wrap. Healthy AND delicious.   Chicken  amp  waffles   If you had only one choice  it HAS to be this. It s really  really good  It s got a hint of sweetness  the waffle is amazing and unique  The chicken is lightly battered and not too deep fried. A very little hint of it tanginess. Delicious til the very last bite  I d say this is their signature dish for sure. - crisp tenders  peppered bacon  peppercorn gravy  green apple slaw  maple syrup  red chile aioli  chives  waffle tortilla  Grilled Salmon  The salmon is cooked to perfection and the ingredients all work well together to bring it a creamy and balanced flavor. Definitely recommend as well  - napa slaw  citrus lime crema  pickled fresnos  roasted corn pico  avocado crema  micro cilantro  corn tortilla  Being a regular here at The Domain  I frequently see Velvet Taco and always intrigued but haven t tried because the long line is always a turn off. I decided to go here in early afternoon on a weekday and there was virtually no line at all.
Velvet Taco,50,Super disappointed. The last time we ate here it was amazing  This time not one tortilla was even warm and their chicken and waffle taco was nothing like it used to be. Sad we wasted a meal while we were out of town here
Velvet Taco,51,I was so anticipating eating these tacos from the descriptions.  I got  1.Rotisserie  2.Cuban   3.chicken and Waffle.    a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2F4.Red amp s bd3d838d7e182724ad4183b5b94e0d5bfcae42282e378f97c6760980597a9547  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  4.Red  a  Velvet cake 1.   Chicken was mushy.  Not a lot of flavor.  Ate half of it.  2.   Pork tasted like it should have been thrown away last week.  Very bad  old yucky flavor.  Didn t eat it.   3.  Loved this one.  Nice combo of savory and sweet.   4.  Cake was old.  Not much flavor.  Basically tasted like oil with sugar.    Won t be going back  UPDATE  Thanks to Phil at VT  my family and I went back to see if our original experience was anomalous.   I m happy to say that my expectations were met this visit.  Our original order was replicated  plus chicken tikka  and I m happy to say everything was delicious.  Not sure what happened before  just a bad day maybe  but I will be going back.  Thank you to Phil and JoJo for giving us this opportunity.
Velvet Taco,52,Best tacos ever  Loved the various veggie options  Best ambience and the food came in very quick 
Velvet Taco,53,came here twice. Anytime I visit Austin this is one of my go to places. The queso it s really good and the brisket taco was my favorite  I tried this recommendation from a friend chicken tikka taco and it was really good as well.
Velvet Taco,54,During our 48 hour trip to Austin  we went to Velvet Taco twice  once for lunch and one late night. The food is incredible  The tacos are outstanding but my favorite thing was the street corn with chips. Absolutely delicious  Their ranch waters are a must  as well 
Velvet Taco,55,Delicious tacos. These aren t Mexican style street tacos. They put all kinds of things into their tortillas and call them tacos. Most of them work very well. I really liked the spicy tikka taco. I would recommend this place if you are looking for some unique flavors in taco form. My only complaint is that the place wasn t  very clean. There wasn t a clean table available  and I had to wipe my own down. The fountain drink area was also a mess. This wasn t during a rush either  I arrived to town in the middle of the afternoon and walked over from my hotel. There were maybe 4-5 other customers inside and on the patio when I got there and no line.
Velvet Taco,56,I didn t do any research before coming here so I didn t know what to expect. The area is bustling and charming IMO  stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch.   When you walk in  you order in a line. There is a pretty wide variety on the menu and prices are about 4-5  per taco  mid range. I saw the  8 Korean taco was new and it sounded delicious per the description on the sign. I liked that the menu was easy to read and each taco had ingredients listed. This Made for an easy ordering experience which was quick and simple. Korean isn t usually a taco I d order but I went for it. Also got a large hazy ipa and Mexican coke. Order came to  20.   We found a seat outside on the covered patio  and it only Took about 5 mins to get our food. The staff was masked and the place was clean inside  but the only open tables outside were dirty leaving us to clean them ourselves. Not a huge deal  but be prepared for a very casual environment.    Y all. The Korean taco was BOMB. I had to remove the jalape os   but this was a beautifully crafted taco.  The flavor was vibrant and new  juicy and fresh.  I ended up making a total mess of it but it was so delicious. The only thing wrong with this taco was that I didn t get two lol   we ended up splitting the red velvet cake which was also FIRE. I d recommend splitting because it s kinda heavy. The icing was light and creamy while the cake was rich and moist. A total win for red velvet lovers.   I plan to take some friends back to this spot. There are so many tacos I need to try  A great experience at velvet taco. 5 5 recommend.
Velvet Taco,57,Definitely a great spot  quick and delicious     The elote corn dip was spot on    The tacos I d tank from shrimp and grits  chicken and waffles and then fish and chips.  The shrimp had a great blacken flavor And then mixed with a grit nugget and sauce   Chicken and waffles has too many flavors to describe but the gravy  bacon and waffle tortilla put this one over the top  
Velvet Taco,58,ocho gracias to Wilson for being a fantastic help to me  I was having a tough day and my man Wilson really came through and lifted me up  I loved speaking with him. I m not even a huge fan of the food  but I will be back for Wilson. Mantente fresco  Wilson 
Velvet Taco,59,Pretty solid tacos. I d say three is a very filling meal. Two would make you full but leaving you wanting more. They are very unique flavors and definitely did not skimp on the spice. I do think Torchy s is better if you re looking for an Americanized taco but this isn t too bad.
Velvet Taco,60,Friendly staff  tasty tacos  and a funky atmosphere make it  no wonder Velvet Taco has taken Texas by storm   This is of the only late night places in the Domain  but they re delicious all the time. Always love to stop by for a coke and some queso during my lunch meetings. Keep up the incredible work y all   
Velvet Taco,61,If I had to use one word to describe Velvet Taco  it d be  unique.  Velvet is located in the heart of the Domain and offers unusual tacos... buffalo chicken  chicken and waffle  and bacon burger to name a few. But that adds to the excitement   I ordered two tacos  buffalo chicken and picnic chicken  pictured   which was plenty filling for a lunch. Each taco cost around  4 and were served in under 5 minutes. The tacos were definitely top tier  and I d return to try their other options.   As for seating  there were a few tables inside along with bar-like seating where you could watch the food being made. The patio seemed nice but it s not well covered- we came on a rainy day and sitting outside was definitely off limits.  On the downside  we waited quite a while to order despite there being a short line. Velvet Taco also doesn t offer many alcoholic beverages  just their house margarita  frozen or on the rocks  and a few canned beers in a cooler by the register. This would be a great spot to come AFTER drinking.   Overall  I d return to Velvet  Definitely a twist on  tacos  but great nonetheless.
Velvet Taco,62,Always love their tacos  unique  delicious. They had my food quickly and I m on my way  Jacob was super helpful and friendly.
Velvet Taco,63,The food was delicious   Great concept.  Loved the area.  Will definitely return  amp  send my friends your way.
Velvet Taco,64,I ve been a Torchys fan for years.  I always order the taco of the month because it is usually unique and original.  This restaurant basically has a full menu of Torchy tacos of the month style culinary inventions.  First visit I tried Tikka Masala taco and pork egg roll taco.  They were amazing.  Knocking off a star because 1  Need a better process for telling customers their order is ready.  It s very loud and hard to tell if your name was called.  Buzzers would help.  2  No utensils. 3  No way to order chips and salsa.  4  Appears to be very understaffed leading to a large group of 10  people trying to get help but only one person to do it who is busy lining the Togo orders up.
Velvet Taco,65,If you re in the Domain  Velvet Taco is something you must try  even if it s 2 AM and you re stumbling out of Rooftop 77 .  5 taco is expensive so if you re looking to save money I recommend getting the queso blanco with your meal. It ll easily fill you up as much as 2 or 3 tacos would and is quite delicious. Be warned  it is a little spicy.   I ve been several times and have never had a bad taco. My favorites are the beer battered cauliflower and the waffle chicken. I m typically picky when it comes to vegetables and slaw  but here I always enjoy both.   If you come during a busy time be prepared to wait in line awhile  I ve seen it out the door and partly down the block at midnight. It s worth it.
Velvet Taco,66,A solid place to go for fusion tacos  Customer service has been friendly and their margaritas are on point. It s so much fun to sit on the patio and people watch in the evenings. The queso is pretty good too  The line can be long at times during peak times and there is plenty of parking in nearby garage.
Velvet Taco,67,Amazing food right in heart of downtown on rose ave. Parking is hard to find so be prepared . A must try if you in downtown austin. Fried paneer and falafel.. love it
Velvet Taco,68,I used to love Velvet Taco  but the quality has really tanked over the past few years. Their tortillas are not as good  and honestly it just tastes like overpriced mush.
Velvet Taco,69,Highlights  Elote  Paneer tikka taco   It was spring break and there was a big line for this place. We wanted to try the tacos here after seeing their reviews. We tried all vegetarian tacos and Paneer tikka taco is the best of all. If you like lettuce wraps then falafel taco is your pick but I am not a fan of it coz its dry. Elote is also a must try  
Velvet Taco,70,I consider myself a bit of a taco aficionado  and I made it my mission to find the best tacos in Austin Texas and this by far has to be one of the better ones  I highly recommend the number two  rotisserie chicken  and the number 10  Kobe beef . Both were uniquely different and both very delicious.
Velvet Taco,71,These tacos are small and the pictures are deceiving when it comes to the size. I would say if you order from here  plan to buy a minimum of 2 tacos per person  but err on the side of caution with 3. They taste really good  but for the price  I think they are too small. The taco size to price ratio is way off. Definitely worth a try though 
Velvet Taco,72,I was expecting more from this place I guess. The first time I attempted to go  it was overrun with soccer fans and it was so loud and chaotic my friend and I decided to go elsewhere.   The next time we tried it I ordered two vegetarian tacos. One was so greasy and messy to eat  my friend genuinely seemed worried for me. Ha   We both decided the tacos were OK  nothing special. I d go back if I was at the Domain  hungry and most other places were closed.
Velvet Taco,73,So yummy    The tacos are super creative but you can pretty much add or remove anything you like. The Cuban is my go to - pro tip if you get to go - wrap it in some foil and pop in the oven for 10 mins or so   I also really liked the WTF weekly tacos - winner winner chicken dinner and chicken Caesar salad where my favorite. Oh and if you like adult beverages the margaritas are the best value and quality in the area.
Velvet Taco,74,Easily my new favorite taco place in town    We tried their  Mexi-Cali shrimp taco  which was simply scrumptious bursting with flavor. The slow roasted angus brisket tacos were enjoyed by the three of us a close favorite. Don t miss the grilled salmon as it is also a spicy taco you won t want to miss.  We happened to stop by on an Austin FC game day. There were lots of people grabbing a bite on their way to the game - give yourself a little extra time as it took about 30 minutes to get our food. Fortunately  we passed the time enjoying a Big Ass Margarita 
Velvet Taco,75,I love this place  I ve been plenty of times and it always hits the spot. The margaritas are so good. My favorite tacos that I ve tried are the fish  amp  chips  brisket  and Korean fried rice. The outside seating is great for people watching. And the red velvet cake is phenom. Did I mention they re opened til 3AM on weekends  A great place to get quality food  amp  late night eats in the Domain 
Velvet Taco,76,Plenty of tacos to choose from. I like that they allow substitutions. I have tried all the vegetarian tacos and they were good. There is lettuce in place of tortilla in Falafel taco  which was something new to me and I was a little disappointed. But the falafel made it up for it. The service is fast and there are plenty of tables. The tacos are on a little pricey side for the quantity. But it is in the domain area so it is understandable. There is hardly any parking next to the restaurant but there are a lot of free parking lots in the domain area which are at walkable distance.   Sauce is very important for me in any taco. And I do not like any of their taco sauce. The sauce just feels like a thicker variation of Tabasco. They can definitely improve on that.
Velvet Taco,77,Best shrimp tacos in Austin  Seth Odom is too legit to quit he was so nice and recommended all kinds of good tacos. The margarita and ranch water with Topo Chico is delicious. Come by and Seth will take care of you
Velvet Taco,78,WOW  While staying in the Domain  we stopped by to indulge in the best tacos in Austin   Everybody was so friendly and all were following the current Covid safety guidelines  The food was absolute amazing  very filling... oh that that s not your average TopoChico you see in my pic  it s  RANCH WATER    Soooo good  a must try 
Velvet Taco,79,A tika chicken taco with basmati rice and fresh Thai basil and mexi grilled shrimp taco with corn salsa  both a taste adventure in the best way. Very fresh ingredients make for a tasty lunch on a shaded patio. I tried Austin s local blood orange cider which was a nice complement. Normally I don t enjoy ciders but the blood orange makes it so good. I can t wait to try other tacos as they have one in Chicago too. This place is worth a stop.
Velvet Taco,80,This location in the domain is nestled right across the street from all the bars. It is fast  delicious  and convenient. Since the last time I ve been here they now have a taco of the week which I tried the chicken Cesar taco that week and it was pretty tasty. My other fav is usually the Korean fried rice taco. It has the right balance of sweet  heat  crunchy elements. I like several others off the menu and the best thing about the tacos are they don t leave me feeling heavy or bloated. It s summer time so if you need a quick bite  a patio or indoor a c to get a break from the heat  it really hits all the needs. They also do have several alcohol options  fountain drinks  bottled and sparkling water and free water from the fountain drink option. They now have an option to order ahead from scanning a QR code and w reward system. It s a well known stop during rotation of being in the domain  have yet to be disappointed
Velvet Taco,81,Velvet Taco was really good  Did not know what to expect but the tacos were all really good  unique. The queso was also great  The food came out quickly too.
Velvet Taco,82,excellent foood  very flavorful  and good quality. this is not your traditional taco place  it is tacos with a twist and i love thier take on tacos. the service is very friendly and the host even came to our seat twice to check if the food was OK. if you are vegetarian you must try their tofu and paneer tacos...they are just amazing. oh and the place is very reasonably priced 
Velvet Taco,83,Tacos are my everything  besides donuts .  And I love love love the veggie options here  They don t just throw some veggies in a tortilla.  They have hot crispy tofu as a base in one... so good  And another one  my favorite  has beer battered cauliflower.  They are all so good.  The service is always really great too.
Velvet Taco,84,I had heard so much about velvet taco and I was super excited to try it out. Seems like a lot of other people made that same decision as me because it was very active within the restaurant. Enough so that it was a little tricky to get a seat. However  we were able to quickly order from their menu which had more than enough choices  I wanted to try everything  The tacos took a bit to come out  but it was understandable considering how busy they were  and you can see into the kitchen and watch the cooks  so we weren t sitting there bored. The tacos came out in little holders that were super convenient to eat from  and the tacos themselves were pretty decent. I wish portion sizes were a bit bigger but it was still worth. I highly recommend getting the elote style corn  even if you re just there for tacos 
Velvet Taco,85,Always have a great time at Velvet Taco. Great service every time  despite it being located in a hectic spot  especially on weekend nights.   Emily was helpful in her service  Thanks team.
Velvet Taco,86,These tacos were original and tasty  Their margaritas were delicious on a hot day with great patio sitting area  Our favorites were the Korean fried rice taco and not pictured chicken tikka  Worth the stop 
Velvet Taco,87,Finally came in since there wasn t a line out the door for once on the weekend. There s some crazy combinations of tacos  but that got me excited. Tortillas at least taste good and were heated up. Margarita was great  they also have some beers on tap. Baja shrimp was just ok but the Korean fried rice taco was really good. Shrimp and grits was ok  but the Cuban was a bit too greasy. Pretty big size so makes up for the price.
Velvet Taco,88,Decided to stop in for a quick lunch because I was craving tacos and it was close to my hotel. I was greeted almost immediately by Seth. He was super friendly and helpful with my decisions. The variety of taco combinations is pretty epic. I had the Cuban and Spicy Tikka Chicken. Both were fantastic. I will definitely eat here again next time I m in Austin.
Velvet Taco,89,Hands down the best taco joint in Austin  It s a meal wrapped up in a soft fluffy taco packed with ridiculous flavor  We loved it so much and almost went back on the same day for dinner. Thanks  Velvet Taco Team 
Velvet Taco,90,Now my son has been raving about this place for months. He just recently moved here in the area at the beginning of the year  and has been posting pictures of some fantastic looking meals... and the majority of them have been a variety of tacos. Needless to say  hitting up the Domain was a must   First off  extremely cool atmosphere and collections of stores. Awesome weekend spot for sure. It seems the Velvet Taco is located in a prime spot. Now for the food... and what a selection. We came in with a group of 7  and I believe each of us ordered something different. I had the Brisket Taco and the Chicken Taco with Bleu Cheese and Buffalo sauce  Buffalo Chicken . Both of these were so so dang good  Seriously  with the flour tortillas  garnishes of cilantro... man o man... salivating now just thinking about it again. Two tacos will easily satisfy your hunger  but just in case... I would suggest trying out their Elote  Mexican Corn . Dang that is some good corn   Our table had the Chicken and Waffles  Brisket  Blackened Shrimp  and Korean Fried Rice. I strongly recommend the Buffalo Chicken and the Brisket Tacos... everyone who had them absolutely loved them. One last thing... ya gotta try the Queso. One of the best I ve had for sure. I am most definitely coming back to this place   Thank you for the experience and Happy Eats  
Velvet Taco,91,FROZEN.  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FMARGARITA.IS amp s e3fe836466f8265276a9966cacb4a1176e07bbb18173a1cc5c0c445baef001d8  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  MARGARITA.IS  a .A.MUST....HOLY HELL   Seriously  you only need one  but I won t judge you if you have two. What saved me from a spinning head was the fact that we munched on the buffalo chicken  chicken  amp  waffle  fish n  chips  and mexi-cali shrimp tacos. Yum  yum  While dining  I kept glancing at the red velvet cake and trust me  I am not the biggest fan of rv cake as it s just chocolate cake with red food coloring  however  as I was throwing back tacos  I couldn t help noticing the thick slices of cake topped with THICK layers of cream cheese  so  naturally  I caved...blame it on the marg and I tell you  I was thoroughly impressed with how moist it was  So  do yourself a favor  don t put your mind through the stress  just grab a slice to go....totally worth it.
Velvet Taco,92,Velvet taco best taco spot hands down nobody can compare to the unique taco combinations but unfortunately I m mad they change the hot Nashville tofu taco recipe if it s not broke don t fix it  bringitback
Velvet Taco,93,Great selection of tacos  though a bit pricey for such small tacos. One is definitely not enough to satisfy your hunger.
Velvet Taco,94,Very yummy. Exceeded my expectations for a grab  amp  go spot the food had good flavor. Food came out quickly. We started with queso for the table. Needed a little bit of salt but still good. I got the Nashville hot tofu because it came highly recommended. You get A LOT of tofu. It could ve been crispier but it was still good and I d get it again. The mexi-Cali is a newer item. Very fresh tasting since it has a lot of veggies on it  shrimp was well seasoned. 2 tacos was plenty. I ll definitely be back.
Velvet Taco,95,I was shopping in the Domain and I felt Velvet Taco beckoning me so I though what the hey  I d been to a different one once and it was a little fast-foodie but not that bad   I walk in and there was no one at the register but the kitchen guys seemed smiling and welcoming and kinda pointed at the further register.  I ordered two veggie tacos  the tikka masala and the felafel.  I sat at the counter which was dirty but someone came to wipe it down.  The tacos themselves were a little weak for the price  the tikka could ve had more to it  and the felafel was a lettuce wrap with little tiny felafels just placed on top  I was kinda not really blown away  though the staff seemed friendly..even the spork they gave me when I asked if there was a fork was kind of a joke  
Velvet Taco,96,After a couple drinks at the wonder bar  VELVET TACO HITS THE SPOT  Above  amp  beyond customer service  amp  the best tacos you can get 
Velvet Taco,97,Food is BOMB  but the wait is LONG.   5 stars for food. 1 star for service.  12 people working and only one person taking orders with a line to the door  Move the line. Takes 30 mins just to get your order taken. Hopefully someone opens more food places in the area.  I pass by daily and they never fix the time it takes JUST TO PLACE THE ORDER.
Velvet Taco,98,My review isn t gonna be any different from the million other reviews people must leave for velvet tacos. No 1 bruh. But Torchys brushfire is kinda close. Buuuuut chicken tikka is amazeballs 
Velvet Taco,99,Really cool little place right in the middle of Rock Rose. I ve tried several of their tacos  but the brisket one is my go-to. Got to love the cheese encrusted tortilla and that spicy sauce  The crispy tots with egg is really good and an interesting take on loaded tots. And of course  the red velvet cake is a must. Staff is very friendly and best part is they are open really late. Only reason not 5 stars is that it s so small that it fills up really fast and the line goes out the door. If they had more space it would be perfect
Velvet Taco,100,This is a good spot with taco options that are a bit different than normal offerings with things like tofu and salmon in the menu. It was pretty busy so it took awhile to get our food and we were a bit confused by the menu  but overall a great casual taco place. And the margaritas were delicious 
Velvet Taco,101,This place was suggest by my brother who used to live in the area so we checked it out Sunday night while in town. Had a variety of tacos to choose from. I decided to get Korean fried rice one which was pretty good to be honest. That place gets pretty busy as well. I also got the small margarita frozen and it was strong and good just how I like. My dad had got the red velvet cake which was kind of thick but it was good as well. Have to check it out again around my way.
Velvet Taco,102,The food is great but to have 11 staff members working and only one register open with a line of people out the door does not seem efficient. Obviously a management oversight that needs to be addressed.  Update  The other reviews about the queso are true. They will only fill the queso half way so it s like you aren t even getting what you paid for.
Velvet Taco,103,velvet doesn t disappoint  and this time i got the Nashville hot tofu  vegetarian  and the shredded pork tacos. The hot tofu was soft on the inside with a bit of texture and the sauce worked really well with it as well. shredded pork came in a hibiscus corn tortilla and was stuffed with meat and veggies  and i recommend trying it with some of their hot sauce 
Velvet Taco,104,The place is good however it takes forever to get the order placed since they only have one person on cashier and also gives drinks  the line is unnecessary long. Also their menu can be easier to read just right to the point.  FYI they don t do breakfast tacos  egg bacon etc  which is super strange for a taco place. I def wish tourchy tacos was near..
Velvet Taco,105,I LOVE THESE TACOS.  Samantha is the best employee  I would recommend this place to anyone 
Velvet Taco,106,Chicken Tikka Taco 10 10 Cuban Pig 8 10 Grilled Flank Steak 6.5 10  Overall fire tacos
Velvet Taco,107,Overall good tacos  a nice place to grab a quick lunch and feel full. Good menu  we got the vegetarian taco  rotisserie chicken  Buffalo chicken  chicken and waffle  and Kobe bacon burger.   By far the best was the chicken and waffle  rotisserie chicken and vegetarian falafel.
Velvet Taco,108,Can t believe took me so long to write a review. I don t even know how often we came to Velvet Taco. We live super close to the domain therefore we are here  all the time .  It can get pretty busy during peak time  long line and long wait for food. But it s worth the wait. Definitely recommend you to at least experience what flavorful tacos can be    You ll be amazed 
Velvet Taco,109,Very delicious and a creative place  The setting was nice and the food was quick and unique. They have a very contemporary twist on tacos and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the chicken and waffles and I was delighted by the generous portion of chicken that was provided. And I had some green Chile pork and the pork was cooked very tender and flavorful. Chips and queso are rather expensive though for what they re worth  but tacos are worth it.
Velvet Taco,110,Best margaritas in town    My favorite tacos are the Nashville hot  chicken taco  the beer batter cauliflower  and the chicken and waffles.
Velvet Taco,111,The tacos here really are too notch. So is the street corn in a bowl. We love the house margaritas on the rocks. Not just a crappy mix margarita. It s legit and super smooth. Nice and clean interior. Great patio area. If we re in The Domain it s our go to drop in for a quick and delicious meal 
Velvet Taco,112,Pretty good  Unique tacos. I tried the Tater Tots topped with an egg and cheese  Chicken and Waffles taco  Shrimp and Grits taco. Tots were my favorite  as I expected. I liked the Chicken and Waffles taco because it was a combo of savory and sweet. The Shrimp and Grits Taco was a  wild card  outside of my usual preferences  and I wasn t crazy about it  but if it does sound like your thing  go for it  Sometimes cheese topped tots get mushy  but these stayed crispy. I ll be back for the tots  and maybe some of the other tacos in their  brunch  category.
Velvet Taco,113,Solid late night taco spot. Mexi Shrimp tacos  tasty with a spicy kick. Alex was also very solid to us. Stumble over after partying at the Domain 
Velvet Taco,114,Love this place. Have taken anyone who visits me here and they have also enjoyed it. They make specialty tacos that I had never had before. You can get fish  shrimp  pork  beef  chicken . Perfect for everyone
Velvet Taco,115,Ordered Spicy chicken tikka  Mexi cali shrimp and Rotisserie tacos.. loved the food and ambiance of this place..
Velvet Taco,116,I just love tacos and glad I was able to finally come to this place. Been always wanting to come here. My son been here and my daughter been here and both love it. Now it s my turn.   You walk-in and the taco menu is on the wall. They have chicken  pork  beef  fish  and veggies. Order and they will call your name to pickup your tacos.   We ordered the chicken picnic  angus brisket  Korean pork  and the fish and chips. I really liked the Korean Pork. Shredded pork with a nice kick to it. Really good. The fish and chips was  good too. Loved the fried fish with cabbage. The angus  beef was very good too with a nice kick. Not too spicy and good. Got a bite of the picnic chicken and it was okay. White meat chicken which I thought was a little dry but good. My wife enjoyed the picnic.   These tacos are pretty big. They are not street tacos but a good three tacos filled me up.   Nice place with both indoor and outdoor seating. They get your tacos out really fast. Just a really casual laid back type of place. The woman who took our order was very nice and friendly.   So order lots of tacos  relax  and enjoy. We did and will be back for sure.
Velvet Taco,117,It really depends who s cooking.   I ve had great tacos here. Fresh tasty and well done but I ve also had some very mediocre tacos.   The choices are interesting and are novel compared to other taco places but nothing to write home about.
Velvet Taco,118,I love this place   I was a little skeptical when I first looked out their menu  but was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  Hands down favorite taco of the night was the chicken and waffles taco. I could eat one of those everyday.  Perfect combination of savory and sweet.  I was not a fan of the curry queso  but all in all  this was a good experience.  This place does stay super busy and it is hard to find a seat  so off times is the best time to go.  I will be back for that chicken and waffle taco.
Velvet Taco,119,Not really my cup of tea but I can see how others would be into this- if you re a Torchys person for example  Some of the concoctions work  some not so much. It s just a mixed bag. The tots were the best things there haha would definitely go back for the tots. Not for the extra sugary margs or kobe burger taco  this was the worst one of all that we tried .
Velvet Taco,120,Unusually chic-ish food in a trendy place. The restaurant probably gets hosed down at the end of the day  but the unusual tacos were a nice divergence from ordinary taco joints. I just learned it is a chain  so it will be easier to go again.
Velvet Taco,121,This is not your average taco spot. Come here with an open mind and your going to enjoy anything on the menu. Velvet taco reimagines what a taco can be from some of your favorite dishes. Tikka chicken taco  perfectly spiced. Flank steak had a great steak flavor to it. Fish and chips lived up to the name. Can t wait to try more
Velvet Taco,122,I love this place  The Picnic Chicken is the best  I always take my friends here when they are in town. They also give a nice military discount   
Velvet Taco,123,Took my order wrong.. and gave me wrong food on top of that with no apology and got an attitude in return.. after taking the money and tips  Cashier Isaiah
Velvet Taco,124,Recently Visited the Velvet taco.  They have quite a selection of tacos. I had the chicken and waffles tacos. They were amazing. The staff is also super friendly  Amanda is a top notch employee   She provided a great recommendation and was one of the nicest employees I ve ever encountered. She is a keeper 
Velvet Taco,125,Dined here recently and had the Korean Fried Rice Taco and the Chicken and Waffles taco. The korean fried rice taco lacked a little flavor. I think the Mayo or aioli that was on it over powered and muted all the other flavors as all I tasted was Mayo. The chicken and waffles taco was overstuffed and delicious. The waffle batter taco shell had the perfect hint of cinnamon. This was definitely my favorite of the two if you couldn t figure that out. I also had a few bites of the queen blanco. It was a little too runny for my liking and did not stick to the chip at all. I would definitely return to try again. The menu seems fun and had a lot of options.
Velvet Taco,126,Im in awe  Have you ever had a food coma  No  Be prepared when you come here. Bring yourself a driver and don t plan on doing anything afterwards. I m a big dude and 2 tacos took me out lol. I was in shock and awe  Love this place and WILL BE BACK 
Velvet Taco,127,This place came highly recommended by my son.  I let him order for me. He had the pork belly taco and loved it.  He ordered me the brisket taco  and we both had the eliote  Mexican street corn .  It was all very good.
Velvet Taco,128,Mother of God  that was incredible. The buffalo chicken taco with blue cheese    ChefsKiss. The chicken Tikka Taco  Cheesus Crust  it was done right.  Come here.
Velvet Taco,129,Only good thing about this place is the location. Wifey didn t like their tacos and I didn t like their queso.
Velvet Taco,130,Unbelievable tacos  Honestly I don t know why this place doesn t have 5 stars.  Skip the chips and queso  save room for the tacos  They re not traditional street tacos  they re larger  and two could easily fill a normal adult female but if you re super hungry get 3. Plus how can you decide   They re so many options  which I think is great. So delicious  I got a tikka chicken   12 beef  Korean pork...all three so delicious. My favorite was the Korean pork and tikka chicken. The beef was not uncommon to other swanky tacos places.  And the margaritas are super yummy  frozen not rocks. Definitely will give you a nice buzz.      Enjoy   I can t wait to return to this place.   Oh get there before you re starving  the line is long  at dinner time .
Velvet Taco,131,The tacos here are really good and filling  good value for the size. Great flavor  environment  service was kind and fast. I d recommend trying any of the flavors they have  will definitely be back.
Velvet Taco,132,I ve heard many great things about this place and was glad to find out it s all true. I let the cashier know it was my first time and he was super patient and friendly with me. He explained the menu  pointed out some recommendations and how big the tacos were. Not overpriced but not cheap. The tacos were delicious  I m already wanting to come back and try some more. The interior design of the place also had a very cool modern vibe to it. I ll definitely be coming back to try more 
Velvet Taco,133,I don t understand the hype the only reason I won t give a one star is the people are awesome. Now to the food the tortillas were cold. The salsa they have is subpar at best. The price for all this I don t believe to be worth it. The margarita itself was not kickass. Sad to say but I m not a fan.
Velvet Taco,134,Yoooooo this place is straight fire    The creativity of the tacos is dope  the flavors are what make this place special. All of them are amazing  but are the ones I had. The chicken and waffle taco is by far my favorite. The crispy chicken mixed with the soft waffle shell is great. And the combo of chipotle sauce and honey on the chicken is spectacular. Next would probably be the Cubano. The shredded pork was tender and had great flavor. The addition of horseradish was a nice touch too.  The Kobe burger tasted just a taco version of a hamburger  need I say more  It was damn good. The Tikka masala taco isn t bad at all. I loved it. It s just last out of these which is saying a lot because all of these are incredible.  This place is a must. Whether you are going for lunch or at 2am from being drunk  it s perfect.
Velvet Taco,135,Cool place. Definitely check it out.  Some things to consider   Unique dishes that you won t get anywhere else.  And they re tasty and flavorful.   The open space is airy and has cool design. The washroom is open too and that s neat and there s neat stuff on the wall.   The food is very salty  break your tongue and stomach salty. I d rather rely on other flavors and not hurt my heart.   Expensive  I got 2 tacos  queso  tots. That s a  12 meal that cost  22.   No recycling  while drinks are served in plastic cups and glass bottles  there s no place to recycle them. Shame on you if they go in the trash.   Would I go back again  Maybe once more. There are enough unique items that I d like to try some more. But  the first time wasn t exciting enough for me to have the same things again.
Velvet Taco,136,Amazing tikka tacos. This is just an amazing place with good house beer  queso and tacos
Velvet Taco,137,I like your food and I have ate some of your foods and I kinda like it because I did not like it that much so I kinda your food I taste it and I like it haha just kidding I not like my food it is half good half bad.
Velvet Taco,138,Love their spicy Tika Chicken tacos   They never disappoint  The domain location is never overcrowded and the outdoor seating is recommended for people watching.
Velvet Taco,139,Great place to fuel up on your domain outing.   Favorites include - Fish and Chips taco  chicken tikka taco and the tator tots.   Quick service  always freshly prepared. Definitely worth going back to again and again.
Velvet Taco,140,Went there yesterday with my daughter for lunch  We both enjoyed the tacos specially the grilled steak.  I wasn t a fan of the chicken tacos. Very good tacos and good service.
Velvet Taco,141,Atmosphere is fun. The outside patio is wonderful on a good weather  81 on the day we visited . The elote  queso blanco  brisket taco and green pork taco were delicious. Our favorite was the brisket taco. The margaritas were delicious and the perfect strength. We would definitely come back again.
Velvet Taco,142,so let s taco bout velvet taco... one of my favorite taco places   This place never disappoints  So much creativity. Of course it isn t traditional tacos but I love the variety and they have something for just about anyone. And for someone like me  Just about one of everything. Not only is it a great food spot  but once quarantine lifts and things are back to normal it s the best place to go after a late night at the bars for food. Not to mention they serve margs and beer   I got the breakfast brisket and egg  Salmon  and slow roasted brisket with crispy cheese tortilla front row  front to back  then back row in the photos we ve got the flank steak  burger taco  Korean pork  two Cuban pigs  and the rotisserie chicken.  My personal favorites were the portobello flank steak  burger  salmon  and the breakfast taco but good lord they are all delicious.
Velvet Taco,143,If you are looking flavor this is the place. Make sure to try the red velvet cake. It s the best I ve ever had.
Velvet Taco,144,Wow  First night visiting Austin and I m so happy the trip started out here at Velvet Taco  I don t normally eat much tacos so this was such a treat. Their flavors and quality are top notch. I can t tell whether they re better or equal to Torchy s Tacos. Are they enemies  Friends  Frienemies  They re both great  The service was also super fabulous. Such a wonderful place to grab some extraordinary tacos in the area  Would love to try other flavors next time.
Velvet Taco,145,Definitely not the most  authentic  taco joint in Texas  but I still love this place for its creative and flavorful offerings. The portions are good  I d get 1-3 for one person  and the drinks are awesome. They re also open super late  so it s the perfect late-night snack after a night out as well
Velvet Taco,146,They were all great. Didn t expect them to be so filling could barely finish one but I just had to try them all
Velvet Taco,147,This spot was fire  Firstly  location is everything. In the center of the the domain  we were able to shop around and then stumble upon this taco joint.  Truly some of the best tacos I ve had  ever  I got their  17 which is a new addition to the menu. A California fish taco  They re margarita was tasty and it comes in two sizes so you can chose your buzz level accordingly. The atmosphere was great  From the customers to the staff  everyone was rockin out and having a blast   I will for sure be back soon 
Velvet Taco,148,Still making my way through the entire menu. Today I ordered the     15 Grilled Salmon  This comes with  Grilled salmon  avocado crema  house shred  lime crema  roasted corn pico  pickled fresnos  and micro cilantro on a hibiscus corn tortilla.  I opted for the lettuce wrap instead of the tortilla and subtracted the corn pico  I m trying to watch my carb intake .    This may in fact be my favorite taco here.  The ingredients are so fresh and clean tasting. That salmon is absolutely amazing  perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I like the avocado crema as it pairs perfectly with the salmon.  I definitely recommend this one.
Velvet Taco,149,The flavors are really good. I think it s a little pricey for what you get.  5.25 for a small portion of chips and brisket. I also ordered the  10 Kobe bacon burger  which was really good but it was small and cost  6.85. The food is really tasty but if you are hungry  things could get expensive pretty quickly.
Velvet Taco,150,Best tacos ever  I honestly think these are the best tacos I ve ever had- such different flavors and so many choices. Even if you don t typically like red velvet cake  get the red velvet cake anyway. I usually don t like red velvet but this cake was unlike anything else I ve ever had- SO good 
Velvet Taco,151,I wanted have some of great taco while I visited at Austin and I found this place by Yelp and I looked at good reviews. I decided gave a shot but it totally disappointed experience with this place. We ordered bunch of taco for two person. Spent  75 for taco  yeah I know it s crazy but we were so hungry. Ordered fish taco  shrimp taco  steak taco  korean bbq taco  spicy chicken taco  beef taco.   Korean bbq style taco was great and I could only recommend you this. But if you don t mind too salty  everything is good for your taste but it was super duper salty and I never eaten like salty tacos elsewhere before. Steak was soft and tasted amazing because it was Texas as you know.   This place was great interior and we sats outdoor seating area and it nice with great music from other places. I wish there s good tasted as I expected if then I would like to go back there again but I didn t.
Velvet Taco,152,I ordered three tacos and a beer at the walk up bar. I ordered the buffalo taco  the chicken tikka taco  and the brisket taco. I want to preface this by usually I am a goto chicken person when it comes to tacos  however the brisket taco was BY FAR the best taco I had. The buffalo was easily the worst. I do want to state that none were  bad  but the brisket is the only one that blew me away.  It was also a  1 that they had a few beers on draft at a quick service restaurant. The pint house electric jellyfish is a great ipa 
Velvet Taco,153,Great service and great food  I work valet outside Friday and Saturday nights and they re always making sure we re being taken care of. Shout out Matt
Velvet Taco,154,Currently  Dining In is available. Limited seating both indoors and outdoors.   I always make it a point to bring new and out-of-town friends to this place  Although it s definitely not a traditional taco place  their creativity is uniquely delicious   Honestly it s hard to describe because none of their tacos are like anything I ve had anywhere else. Not even sure I would classify them as tacos other than they are served in a tortilla... lol but yet I come back time and time again  If you re not sure what to order  you ve got to try the Crisp Tots and Eggs. It s covered with cheese and well that s all you need to know  it s amazing 
Velvet Taco,155,First time having Velvet Taco  and it did not disappoint  The spicy tikka chicken and beer battered cauliflower were amazing  My Fiance had two different beef tacos  and he said they were soo good   So much flavor  The queso and chips were on point  I 10 10 recommend   
Velvet Taco,156,I think I originally planned to give this place 4 stars but the fact that I woke up this morning thinking about them and wanting to try all the other tacos made me concede and give 5 stars . I would like to think of this as a fusion spot that just puts everything into a taco. The Tikka Masala taco is amazing with enough heat to make you sweat a little and one of the best things I have had in awhile. I also got the Cuban taco and is exactly that  just a perfect Cuban sandwich in a taco shell.
Velvet Taco,157,These tacos are shockingly good - I have to admit when my wife wanted to come here  inwardly I was rolling my eyes cause their tacos feel like some kinda mad scientist just threw a bunch of heavy hitting flavors together. And while  it still feels like that  I have to admit  these flavors somehow work and produce a sum much greater than their parts. I also have to admit  many of these tacos are very well thought out and creative. So kudos to Velvet Taco for something new and unexpected. It was my taco crawl winner from among 5 taco places we visited this past week.  We split three tacos between 2 of us and they were plenty. The tacos are very large and 2 tacos is definitely enough for dinner. We got a cuban pig was the most flavorful taco of them all and was one that I didn t think would rank that high at first blush - its a mountain of pork and some pickles. But the pork on pork action compliments each other well without being overwhelming and each pork product brings something to the party - whether that s salty  smoky  fatty  sweet  etc. I love me a good cuban sandwich and its genius to mesh this into taco form.  Second place is the fish and chips taco  a tex mex spin off a british classic that s quite fun. It s like eating one of those stuffed sandwiches with the fries inside  though you don t notice the shoestring fries that much. Curry mayo provides some aromatic punch to cut the grease. The fry on the fish would make any british pub proud. It s Britain in a taco.  The last one we got was the chicken and waffle taco  which has a pretty ingenius waffle shell. Syrup  fried chicken  and gravy make this a soul food classic  though I wish the waffle shell was a bit more crisp. But i liked that it interplayed the salty sweet feel. And it was definitely fun to eat and a brunch item to enjoy.  Don t sleep on the queso here either - I tried the queso blanco which is pretty straight forward white american cheese bliss with just enough acidity and heat to taper the fat. I like the touch of blue corn chips for the color and presentation too.  If you re looking for a taco adventure  this is the place for you.
Velvet Taco,158,Ate at the one downtown and thought they were the best tacos I ve ever had. Others in my group did not feel the same but as they rated it  3-4 but for we delicious. The pork taco with the Chile verde sauce   the third option of the 3 pork options. Wowowowowo.    Margs good too      Casual place with good value fresh ingredients and an I ll bet back soon factor.   Cheers
Velvet Taco,159,Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon  it was fairly busy but we were able to put in our order after waiting a few minutes and had no issue grabbing seats outside.   The menu here has an awesome selection of super creative tacos across all sorts of cuisines. I can definitely see myself coming back here multiple times as a lot of them stood out as things I d want to try.   They have a rotating taco of the week so I decided to try that and I went for the steak and eggs taco. The taco of the week was a shrimp jambalaya. the fried shrimp tasted great  the spicy mayo felt a little out of place but it went really well on the shrimp. The steak and eggs taco was okay  the steak felt a little too chewy and didn t have a ton of flavor  the eggs also didn t taste too fresh. The hollandaise sauce was the saving grace on that taco.   My friend had the other two breakfast tacos  the chicken and waffle looked especially interesting with the waffle shell.   Overall  I think it s a great spot to check out given the wide variety of options available  but no guarantees they ll all be hits.
Velvet Taco,160,Delicious queso  delicious tacos   delicious red velvet cake  strong margaritas . Convenient location and delicious food every time.
Velvet Taco,161,Velvet taco is the gold standard for fusion tacos  I got their paneer taco this time and it tasted amazing as always. The paneer was fresh and soft while the sauces danced in my mouth  Highly recommend Velvet tacos 
Velvet Taco,162,It is Great for a late night bite or something quick and easy. Lists of menu options to try something new every time. Doesn t disappoint 
Velvet Taco,163,I was served by Griffin. He was so polite and accommodating to our requests. Amazing energy   Thanks
Velvet Taco,164,Have been to other locations in past. Food is always good with a different take on tacos. I only gave 3 stars for this location for several reasons. First the tortillas were not homemade as they are in other locations. Cheap  thin tortillas with my chicken falling out all over my hands. Second  this location was dirty. Tables sticky  bird poop all over the outdoor tables  chairs and deck. Lastly the restrooms were in terrible condition. I asked cashier to bag my food up and I went and ate in my car.
Velvet Taco,165,Very yummy. Cool atmosphere.   Cuban pork  delicious. Spicy mustard added nice flavor. Pulled pork was tender and delicious. Pickles added nice crunch. Highly recommend.   chicken and waffle  chicken was tender and good. Waffle taco shell was tasty and fun. Only complaint was that the slaw was a little sweet for my liking but if you like sweet slaw it s a hit   beer battered cauliflower  perfect for a vegetarian. Very flavorful  more than expected. Particularly liked the beer batter.  fish and chips  curry mustard was an unexpected delight. Shoestring potatoes made for a nice  chip .   green chili pork  wasn t as flavorful as had hoped and was a little cold so just generally didn t enjoy quite as much.   Overall  would definitely recommend.
Velvet Taco,166,Cool spot at the Domain with interesting selection of tacos but very tasty  We ordered four different tacos as this was our first time here  the buffalo chicken taco  chicken tikka  the brisket taco  and one with pulled pork. I have to say in order of most favorite to least favorite it was the brisket  pulled pork  chicken tikka  and then the buffalo chicken. I feel like the brisket and pulled pork tacos had more ingredients and were more filling.   We also tried the curry queso which was delicious    The margaritas were good also  but a little on the very sweet side.  One thing I did wish from the tacos was that the temperature was more hot  instead of room temperature.   I will definitely be coming back to try different tacos as well as some of my favorites from my first visit 
Velvet Taco,167,Great tasting tacos  Plenty of options for all different tastes your family likes. Good for a quick meal inside then out without breaking the bank account. Great customer service.
Velvet Taco,168,Stopped by this place for a post-party dessert craving. We had heard so much about their red velvet cake  which is decent for what you get during those unearthly hours. The tacos looked delicious and I definitely want to go back for those
Velvet Taco,169,I know they re called Velvet Taco  but I m a sucker for tots. I was a bit worried because it includes goat cheese  but fortunately it didn t overpower the dish. Despite all the ingredients that could make the soggy  the tots maintained their crispiness the whole time I was eating them. The egg comes sunny side up  but I d probably ordered it as over easy next time.   If you re looking for authentic tacos  look elsewhere as most of their tacos are fusion tacos. I wouldn t necessarily go out of my way to come here  but if you re already at the Domain  they re worth checking out. They re open late which is perfect after a night of drinking.
Velvet Taco,170,A decent taco place in the Domain.   My friend and I wanted a place we could drop in for a quick bite but of course as picky foodies we had to be careful with where we landed. So we went walking through the Domain and let our nose decide for us.   The smells wafting out of this place drew our attention and our feet as we ordered a  Breakfast  Steak and Eggs   Shrimp  Tikka and a Buffalo taco. I ordered a cup of Mexican Street corn too.  I couldn t help myself.   Right off the bat  the place is charming and the ambiance is banging. Lamentably  it wasn t the evening and we were on a tight schedule  otherwise we would have stayed for more.     _   _   The Tikka Taco was good but I wasn t a big fan of the rice they had added to the taco. I could tell there was a flavor there but it was too light to tell what it was.    _   _   The Buffalo taco was a fried chicken tender with buffalo hot wing sauce.        The Steak and Egg taco was amazing. The flavors of the crispy potatoes  steak and an egg play off of each other beautifully. The crispy potatoes and the egg add a beautiful contrast of textures that make you want to ask for another.    _    Finally  the shrimp taco was  meh. Lamentably  the shrimp were well done. Dry. Like dried up anchovies  and over salted.        The elote  corn  was delicious. I would have asked for another cup but as I mentioned  we were on a tight schedule.   But I would like to encourage these taco chefs to add a little more to their tortillas. Stop just warming up the tortilla. Please  please add a little char on them. Try this - warm the tortilla up like you usually do and then place them on the metal holder like you usually do but then  just before you add the ingredients  use a hand-held torch and kiss the surface of the tortillas with the flame to give them some color and then....and only then add the ingredients. Love us enough to add a kiss of fire to the tortillas.
Velvet Taco,171,Delicious and such creative tacos    So grateful for delivery options that made this a must have while I m at work  
Velvet Taco,172,Not much to be said that others have not said  perfectly good taco option  although there are many to choose from in this town so hard to pick among all the different options. I do like some of them are unique menu choices  they don t always work out quite like you d expect  but they re still fun to try.
Velvet Taco,173,The menu is a bit overwhelming. The rotisserie chicken taco is nothing special - tastes exactly like rotisserie chicken just stuffed in a corn tortillas which cracked down the middle on first bite. The chicken and waffles taco was unique and tasty. Probably better ordered as a dessert taco - eat it last as it s a bit sweet. Prob would order that one again.
Velvet Taco,174,This is one of the places where the fusion of different cuisines gelled so well. I was amazed by the attention given to each and every detail in the taco fillings.  As an Indian  I can certainly assure everyone that they have done justice to the paneer taco. The raita  spiced yogurt  topped over fried paneer is better than what is served in a sizable chunk of Indian restaurants in US. The paneer is lightly fried so that it remains soft from inside  while being crispy on the outside.  The Nashville hot tofu taco  despite its red hot appearance  has just the right amount of spice  which is complemented by the sourness of the pickles. Vegans should try this taco to get a sense of why nashville fried chicken is so popular.  Will try their meat tacos next time.
Velvet Taco,175,Very good tacos  I got the shrimp and the burger minus the sauce. Great patio  nice staff. Only downsides were they re a bit pricey   12 for two tacos  and I ve had another time where they messed up our takeout.
Velvet Taco,176,This place is must try for taco lovers. They have so many variety- vegeterian options are limited but they are definitely awesome. I tried a vegetarian taco and corn last time. Ambient is also great plus they have got plenty to seats to sit.  One taco with side is enough if you are moderate hungry.
Velvet Taco,177,I didn t know what to expect from Velvet Taco until I saw the menu. Now  if you are a die hard Tex-Mex fan  then this place is NOT for you. They take the meaning of  funky tacos  to a whole new level.  The Spicy Tikka Chicken taco had a Indian flavor to it with rice in the actual taco  talk about unique on a whole new level. Our favorite taco was the Buffalo Chicken taco  with that stinky bleu cheese. The Ahi Poke taco is keto friendly and comes on a lettuce wrap  tasted super fresh to me. Steak  amp  Eggs..well let s just say the eggs were not scrambled and came out as a form of taco shell. The Red Curry Coconut Queso was AMAZING. Literally curry flavored queso. Never tasted a queso like it before. The only thing I did not care for was the cake. A bit dry and the frosting was deathly sweet.  Overall we both really enjoyed this place and will definitely come back to try other tacos on the menu. You have to go come here with an open mind  because Velvet Taco is definitely exploring the edge of multi-cultural boundaries and liberating tacos to a whole new level.
Velvet Taco,178,Delicious specialty Tacos  Had the Cuban   tikka   falafel   chicken and waffle   picnic. All great tacos and the best part was the chips and Queso
Velvet Taco,179,I always order online to go so not sure about dining in. However I ve always had a delightful experience with readiness and food quality flavor. I really recommend the cauliflower taco and the chicken tikka masala one so good 
Velvet Taco,180,Great vibe  good margaritas  good tacos. I appreciate places like this  I give it four stars because the tacos were good but the flavor could have been a little better. The outdoor seating is the place to be with good weather  Dog friendly patio which I LOVE   Can t wait to come back and get some chips and queso 
Velvet Taco,181,Delicious unique tacos. I loved the Mexican Cali Shrimp taco with its spicy flavor combination. We also had the frozen Margarita 1 2 gallon delivered and it was perfect.
Velvet Taco,182,Great taco place. I have the shrimp  chicken and pork tacos . All excellent. I also got the hot sauce to pour over the top. Excellent flavors. Highly recommended.
Velvet Taco,183,Want to try fusion tacos    This is the place. My go to place for late night taco cravings. Must try the chicken tikka   chilli pork and panner tacos
Velvet Taco,184,A good taco place with a nice variety of flavors tastes to choose from. If I were local  I d like to try everything on the menu.   Here s what I ordered   18 Chicken and Waffle taco which had a nice combo of sweet and savory flavors. The coleslaw in it was a nice surprise.    12 Angus brisket - has a spicy corn salsa on top that s well balanced with the salty brisket     5 Paneer taco was my favorite of the three I ordered. I didn t even notice the tofu was tofu. I haven t had a taco like this before and I highly recommend it if you re feeling up for something new.
Velvet Taco,185,I might become obsessed with Velvet Taco    Particularly since I can order it through Lunch Drop at work . I appreciate the fancy ingredients and the specialized types of tortillas and sauces.  The Annatto Shredded Pork is one of my favorite tacos  with grilled pineapple bits  pickled onions and queso fresca  and avocado crema sauce is so tasty.  Love the hibiscus corn tortilla   The Rotisserie Chicken taco is a good staple  chock full of tender white chicken meat  and topped with a zesty poblano salsa and plentiful  corn pico .  The red curry coconut queso is so good it s ridiculous  and queso is usually something I skip at other tex-mex places.
Velvet Taco,186,Food was really good  loved the loaded tater tots with an egg on top  Really good margaritas too  they definitely give you a buzz. Not just your basic tacos lots of interesting twists.
Velvet Taco,187,This place was great  A little pricy - but that s ATX for you  but otherwise great  Love the ambience. The tacos were spectacular. My husband and I were shopping in the Domain and stopped in on a hungry whim. I was a little disappointed to discover it was a fusion taco place BUT they were delicious  We got the chicken tikka  Buffalo chicken  beer battered cauliflower  and pulled pork tacos. They were all good but my favorite was the tikka chicken and my husband liked the pulled pork. Definitely a must try if you re in Austin 
Velvet Taco,188,I use to love coming to this place but lately I feel like the freshness of the food has really gone down. Before everything was fresh to order and came nice and hot but now my food is always lukewarm or just plain cold    I love the street corn but hate that it s lukewarm every time I get it. I use to think the tacos were so good here but I feel like they put less effort into making them.   Not a fan of the seating here still  very cold and the seats are so uncomfortable.   I m not sure if they just have their days but the past few times I ve gone I ve left unsatisfied. Maybe I ll visit in a couple of months and see if they have improved but we ll see.
Velvet Taco,189,First visit to Texas- tacos with the shrimp were different.  The shrimp was cooked really well.
Velvet Taco,190,Overhyped to the max. Always slow  always too spicy no matter what you order. Don t know what the hype is about
Velvet Taco,191,Such an amazing experience. The corn in a bowl is epic - a must have item to start out. Then they have awesome drinks too with alcohol that are fun and tasty. All the tacos are unique and delicious - recommend getting a platter of a bunch to try. They even have a full menu of vegetarian options that are all yummy - the paneer was our favorite. Overall one of our favorite taco places we ve tried and we will be coming back many times to come 
Velvet Taco,192,I had a wonderful visit to the Domain Velvet Taco location. Amanda offered great service and advice regarding the menu. I will definitely be back 
Velvet Taco,193,Love the Mexi-Cali shrimp taco. The flavors were good  and it was a little spicy. I also had the special Paella taco  which was mediocre. I like Taco Deli and Veracruz much more  but I wouldn t mind coming back. It s worth 3.5 stars  not quite at 4-star level.
Velvet Taco,194,Came here after work for some food and was blown away by Emily and her customer service. While working her butt off to get orders out she was also ensuring that every Customer left with a smile 
Velvet Taco,195,There was a long line but it went pretty quick. Friendly service. We both loved our tacos and the elote dip was the bomb 
Velvet Taco,196,Decent  but I wouldn t say I m a fan. I don t know how to describe this genre of tacos. If I had to use one word to describe them  I d say  leaky . They will fill you up and have pretty good flavor  but I think this place overcomplicates something that should be simple. Way too much sauce on everything.   Then again  this place is categorized as American  new  on Yelp  so I m not surprised with what I got. I felt nice and bloated an hour after eating here  so it lived up to the category. I ll stick to my go-to taco spots that are well outside the domain where I have to know a little Spanish to get the good stuff.
Velvet Taco,197,Potentially the best taco place I ve ever been. So many unique tacos. Highly recommend
Velvet Taco,198,Just in town for a visit  unsure of what to get just knew I wanted someThing with some spice  and Emily did a great job explaining to me which tacos were in fact spicy and which would be ideal for me  10 out of 10 would definitely dine again 
Velvet Taco,199,Hey Guys   I ve been visiting this Velvet Taco in Domain for many years  It s always been great food  consistent quality and awesome customer service     While Covid turned our world upside down  for more than a year now  the restaurant industry took the biggest hit.   I ve found some comfort in Velvet Tacos   Thank God they have remained opened  giving us a break from cooking at home  I ve been mostly ordering for take out. Very well packed tacos  Such a treat    I usually order the Paneer Tikka  Chicken Tikka  Nashville  Waffle  amp  Chicken and my favorite is Fish n chips     Always delicious      The staff are really nice. They wear masks at all times. They keep the sitting area clean.  Very courteous and professional staff     Very quick service too   Spread the good cheer at Velvet Tacos  say Hello  to Drew  if you see him  He s Very kind staff member 
Velvet Taco,200,We came here on a Monday afternoon and it was packed.   We ordered   Nashville got tofu taco  delish Fried paneer taco  good Falafel taco  not good  falafel themselves are very bland and not worth it Elote corn  good   Out of the 3 vegetarian tacos  only 2 are worthwhile even amongst our group. Make sure to get a hold of the spicy sauces    Parking  there are a few parking garages
Velvet Taco,201,Good tacos  long wait. Used the app option and still waited 22 minuted for one taco on a Wednesday evening.
Velvet Taco,202,Tried 7 different tacos and they were all very unique. Felt like a pot luck of sorts. Korean  bbq  seafood  Jewish  Indian  Mexican. Love that they try new flavors each week and are constantly testing new recipes. My favorite was the brisket  My least favorite was the salmon  although it wasn t bad  it just didn t have the right balance and I couldn t taste the salmon much . Margaritas were tasty  preferred it on the rocks . Will definitely be back to try more.
Velvet Taco,203,A great place to grab some quick bites of yummy  tacos with a wonderful twist and very flavorful.  The have a nice seating inside  picnic tables and raised tables  as well as a great patio outside. Even the restroom and hand washing area is quiet different.. Make sure to take a visit    Wouldn t have imagined an Indian version of the taco as the paneer taco here Only complaint they are too oily and while I am trying to have my taco and making sure things stay inside my tortilla the oil keeps dripping all around  . They have perfect combination of spice and zest with all their versions. Service is great . On average takes about 8-12 min till your order is ready depends on how busy they are .. but the line goes by surprisingly fast   One thing I couldn t help but mention is the staff  I haven t seen them rest even for 10 seconds  they re constantly working and consistently serve amazing food. They make all the tortilla fresh right there   That s amazing and definitely the freshly baked Red -velvet Cake.. YUMM  Great spot for super late night food.. Love that they are open till 4 00 am on weekends ..
Velvet Taco,204,We got 4 tacos  Spicy tikka chicken  Korean pork  angus beef  and Cuban pig.   My favorite by far was the spicy tikka chicken. Although it s not quite like the authentic Indian tikka but the flavors and textures made it my favorite.   My second favorite is the Korean pork taco. Again  not quite authentic Korean and It didn t have the true kimchi flavors but it was still really good with all the different flavors.   My least favorite was Cuban pig. I m not sure why it was called that because it didn t remind me of a Cuban sandwich.   Angus beef was damn good too. The beef had excellent flavors.   I would definitely come back here for the unique tacos.  We also got margaritas but the margs were way too sweet for my taste.
Velvet Taco,205,Personally disappointed as I thought this taco shop was a bit overrated  but then again I have eaten ATX tacos for over 20 years. The domain location had a great upscale yet trendy environment  with great interior decor and ample seating. I went at lunchtime and there was a line  however the orders were taken very quickly.   I got the Cuban Pig and Annatto Shredded Pork. While they were great  I wouldn t say either were that memorable and heavily sided on the Tex side of the Tex-mex. Your tacos will come in a cute divider  and makes for aesthetic photos due to the color and ingredients variety.   There are a good number of Vegetarian and GF options  so this place is great if you have diet restrictions. I m curious about the brunch tacos  as they are served in a waffle which definitely adds more of a unique flair to the taco than traditionally seen. Might give them another try next time.
Velvet Taco,206,There s so many great taco places in Austin but Velvet Taco still ranks in my top favorites because of their large menu and unique ingredients. We ordered the cuban pig  angus brisket  which we were told by a lady in line that it was the best taco   shredded pork  shrimp and grits  and bacon and egg breakfast taco  served all day   . The pepper jack cheese grits and tater tots in the breakfast taco were incredible - I would just order those by itself if that was an option. However  the shredded pork was a little too spicy for me  and the meat was cold by the time we got it. You can t forget the velvet cake at the end too - it was really moist with a touch of caramel sauce.
Velvet Taco,207,SO FLAVORFUL  The food here is DELICIOUS  but it was expensive. I would consider it overpriced  but I don t regret it. I m a huge fan of tacos and would consider myself well versed in the austin area.   I personally would not go back because of the price to quality ratio. However  I enjoyed the atmosphere as it is very lively there. In comparison to the rest of the domain area for food  I would recommend Velvet Taco for a good meal and a good experience.
Velvet Taco,208,Convenient locations with unique options. Not cheap but not crazy expensive either. It is generally busy so expect to wait a little while for your food.   Chicken Tikka Taco is very good as long as you like that flavor profile.  Bacon Burger Taco is also very good but I would suggest getting the sauce and pickles on the side  they make it far too sweet.  Curry Queso is a must try. Not a super strong curry flavor but just enough to make it unique.   You can definitely get away with two tacos or a taco and chips and queso in my opinion   They also have amazing looking desserts that I must try soon 
Velvet Taco,209,Awesome tacos  Management cares about their customers and the staff was friendly. Palomas are delcious 
Velvet Taco,210,I have already been here at least five times and I ve gotten something different each time. Now  as a taco place  it is really good because they have a great selection and variety in flavor combinations and representations from different cuisine backgrounds  like cuban pork  tikka masala  fresh tuna  cooked salmon  shrimp and grits  and korean pork  and the breakfast tacos are among my favorite as well  particularly the chicken and waffles  It certainly isn t Mexican  so don t expect to find cheese and beans  olives  or shredded lettuce and cotija  but for what it is  it s very good  and well worth the experience.  The tacos are a bit pricey for some of them   5.50  and others around  3.95   which isn t bad but a bit more than some places  likely due to the location. It s also a nice place so you re paying for that as well.  Of the few places I ve had tacos so far in Austin  again  they re not Mex or Tex Mex  but more like hipster-Mex     and darn tasty and better than Torchys  still worth the trip  imho.
Velvet Taco,211,Great tacos.  Great tasting food.  Loved the atmosphere.  Really adorable.  The Red Velvet Cake is to die 4.  Go and enjoy a great experience.
Velvet Taco,212,My colleagues and I were in town for work and had dinner here one night.  The restaurant is an area with lots of other restaurants  bars and shops.  Looks like a fun area that I would love to explore.  They have lots of fun tacos.  You order at the counter and they call you name when ready.  I had the following    14 Shrimp and grits - creole mayo  blackened shrimp  crispy pepper jack cheese grits  charred tomato-poblano salsa  micro cilantro  corn tortilla   8 Annatto shredded pork - avocado crema  house shred  grilled pineapple  pickled onion  queso fresco  cilantro  hibiscus corn tortilla  Crisp tots  amp  local egg  I held the egg  - herbed goat cheese  smoked cheddar  avocado crema  chili butter  bacon  My two tacos were delicious.  Loved the grits flavor.  The shrimp was nicely grilled.  The pork taco was great too.  Loved the toppings on it.  And you can t go wrong with crispy deep fried tots.  Loved the cheese on top.  They have beer and wine by the can or on tap.  Lots of other fun food too.  Definitely a fun place I would love to visit again.
Velvet Taco,213,I was very disappointed and would not recommend it. We order 3 tacos  rotisserie chicken was bland  one taco was described on the menu as having avocado none of the tacos we got had avocado and one taco was mostly salsa  very very little pieces of chicken.
Velvet Taco,214,The tacos are good  but never seem to hit the spot  maybe better tortillas would do the trick. We got the tots today and they were delicious  however the queso was awful. Over all I like the atmosphere and the food.
Velvet Taco,215,My mind was blown here. I didn t think you could create such unique tacos... AND have them taste amazing. Case in point  my tacos  haha. I ordered a spicy tikka chicken taco  which was pretty spicy actually  I d say 7 10   but the rice balanced it out very well  and the shrimp and grits taco  which tasted JUST like shrimp and grits. I would have ordered more but those two alone were very filling. Combine great tacos with a chill  friendly ambiance  and I honestly can t wait to come across this place again during my future travels.
Velvet Taco,216,I love this place  Very tasty tacos... Clean and nice place  Fresh tuna   fresh salad ... Thank for good service  I recommend for everyone 
Velvet Taco,217,Always great tacos. My favorite is the Buffalo chicken and Picnic taco. Easy and convenient spot to eat if you re out on rock rose.
Velvet Taco,218,Velvet Taco is definitely one of my go-to taco places in Austin  The tacos never disappoint  and the customer service is awesome.   I visited this past weekend  and I was feeling something different from my usual order  so I asked the cashier for recommendations. Analicia  the cashier  was patient and kind with me  even though there was a long line behind me. She recommended the beer-battered cauliflower taco   6.5   and I FELL IN LOVE  Thanks to Analicia  I have found my new favorite 
Velvet Taco,219,Visiting from Utah and stumbled on this place. I m so glad we did. The service was above and beyond  and the food is just ridiculously amazing we had a few different tacos and 2 sides. The elote is seriously addicting. We will be going back before we go home. Edit  we went back  and it was still amazing. Had the  9 Korean and red velvet cake. It s the closest thing to food perfection I can think of.
Velvet Taco,220,Creative creations  the queso was very good  the overall meals were ok i wouldn t go back.    Where the food was good the staff was lacking  ordered prepped wrong after a 26min wait  a 2nd order for chips and Queso took 24 mins  but after asked for it we realized they just cleared the order vs making it.
Velvet Taco,221,Simple.   Tacos.   Aaaawesome menu    Such a pleasurable food experience. Freshly made     Dope combinations  HELLO SHRIMP N GRITS TACO     Margaritaaa    Corn cup.  Cake     Psht.  Get a non-Domain location PLEEEASEE  
Velvet Taco,222,Its pretty good  overhyped though. If you want the whole experience go to the one in the domain
Velvet Taco,223,Parking  plenty of free parking around the area  Ambiance service  order food  give your name  amp  they will call it when food is ready  The unisex bathrooms are amazing   Super stylish. The decor throughout the place is really nice   Food  got the three vegetarian tacos  4   5   6.  Holy cow  So good  Although  the tofu and the paneer one   4 5  were AMAZING    Will def be back  Rec for all vegetarians out there.
Velvet Taco,224,Just not authentic at all. Tacos aren t bad but the flavors won t surprise you or make you want to come back for seconds. If you are hungry and need a place to escape the rain  you could come here but if you want a real Tex-Mex authentic taco experience  there are literally dozens of other places I would try before coming here
Velvet Taco,225,Ordered the three tacos - chicken tikka taco  which was really hot and I didn t really enjoy the taste as much   paneer taco  my favorite of the three we ordered  and the fish taco  which was really tasty as well . It took a while for our order to come through  good 15 mins  and we had to check on our order twice just to be sure we didn t miss them calling. Not sure if the delay was only for our order or this is the usual wait time. Taking out a star for the wait and the not so interesting chicken tikka taco.
Velvet Taco,226,Velvet Tacos is a fun  upscale taco restaurant with reasonable prices.  They have some very unique tacos including Nashville tofu  chicken Tikka and paneer.  They offer about 3 taco choices in every category  seafood  chicken  veg  pork  beef  and brunch   so everyone s happy .  We went as a group of 8 and tried a variety of tacos - it was a big hit with everyone.  I had a side of street corn  yum  and choose the indian-fusion paneer taco and the ahi taco  served in a lettuce wrap   and enjoyed both.    Decor is cute  especially the wash area which you will definitely visit since taco eating is a messy business   There s indoor and outdoor seating.  Orders are placed upfront and they call your name when your order is ready.
Velvet Taco,227,Velvet Taco is no joke   It serves the best ingredients in simple yet different ways. the flavors are mixed well and the staff is good at what they do. This is a must stop for me when I am in the area  
Velvet Taco,228,What a cool place    Love the menu...short  amp  sweet   I had the BBQ Hamburger Taco. It was so delicious. Meat was cooked perfect and very most.  Austin took our order at the counter. I order a margarita on the rocks in which he was the bartender too. A different away of serving than I m used to. He did a great job    Love the decor in this place...lots of colorful art to enjoy   I love the set up of the wash area being outside of restrooms   Talk with Ms Liz the manager  she was very cool and nice. Next time I will order more than one taco. Definitely a winner   
Velvet Taco,229,2nd visit not as great as the first. Food was incredible but service was not. They were out of cake and only serving small margaritas  don t know why.   I had the weekly feature Mary s little lamb and ahi tuna. Both were incredibly tasty and well balanced.   Hubby had the shrimp and grits and fish and chips. The shrimp and grits was awesome. The fish and chips not so much as it was cold.   They remade it for us so we appreciated that. The 2nd was on point.   Line was long so it seems that business is steady. Also  open to 4 am on weekends for a late night treat.   Definitely casual and yummy.   Worth the try bar none.
Velvet Taco,230,This place is tacos on steroids.    We had the beef brisket which was outstanding as was the chicken taco of the week.  The fish and chips taco was a misfire in comparison.   So get that beef taco and enjoy your life 
Velvet Taco,231,I was in the area for business and had heard a lot about Torchy s  but ended up coming here because it was way more convenient and had awesome reviews.  Overall I was really happy with my experience  Service was really friendly  ordering was easy and quick.  I ordered the crispy tots  and then THREE tacos  way  way  way too much food  but I digress   chicken tikka  flank steak  and brisket.  The tots were awesome  though I don t LOVE a sunny side egg  I d prefer fully cooked whites   they were still sooo good   I ended up just eating the insides of the tacos for the most part...my favorite one was the flank steak  but all 3 were awesome   They also had a delicious IPA on draft which I enjoyed on a hot night    Overall  I d definitely recommend Velvet Taco to someone that was in the area.
Velvet Taco,232,Holy moly y all    I had been here once before and had a taco super fast wasn t really blown away so I didn t post about it    But I went back and holy freaking moly    I had a chicken and waffle taco which I have never of thought to taste before. It blew me out of the water . I also ordered a steak skirt taco with a hibiscus tortilla very  tasty. But by no means was it the chicken and waffle taco ha I m in love .   Place is clean service is great .  And it s in prime location for snacking when shopping at the domain also price point is totally affordable  
Velvet Taco,233,If you are in the Domain area and are looking for some tacos  this is the place to go    The atmosphere is busy and lively. The place was hopping at 2pm on a Friday when we went. Thankfully  we were able to find a table just as someone was leaving. We went with our 7 month old and were able to maneuver his stroller around  even though it was busy.   We tried  The Rotisserie Chicken - chicken  white queso  roast corn pico  cilantro  smoke poblano salsa - This was BOMB.   The Cuban Pig - gruyere cheese  pulled pork  ham  bacon  grain mustard and pickles. This was also delicious.   The Fish N  Chips - beer battered cod  curry mayo  malted French fries  and pea tendrils. This was my husband s favorite. He said it was amazing.   Slow Roasted Angus Brisket - brisket  red chili mayo  avocado relish  white queso and cilantro. Again  amazing.   This place gives Torchy s a run for its money. It s like Torchy s in that if you re looking for authentic Mexican food  don t come here. If you like a fresh twist on tacos  this is the place to go. It is pricey  but it s very hipster and very  Austin.  We will absolutely be bringing out of town visitors here.
Velvet Taco,234,Amazing food and great customer service. Nashville Tofu is a bomb. Paneer tikka is so flavorful  definitely recommended
Velvet Taco,235,I came hungry  I left happy.   My boss took us all out to lunch and suggested Mexican.    Why are we driving 15 minutes up to the domain   We asked.    Watch.  He said. Cryptically.   Upon arrival you realize you re in a classy taco shop. Upscale modern hipster deco and unisex bathrooms with a lounge hand washing area.   The tacos arrive in special inverted triangular taco holders. I opted for the poke  raw fish   and shredded pork tacos.   The lewd banter of my table instantly stopped when our food arrived. It was top notch taco time - and  watch  indeed. That s why we passed 40 taco shops to get to this one.   The shredded pork taco was so saucy I needed a paper towel underneath it. I got it as a lettuce wrap. The meat was soft and succulent. It was the perfect blend of fat and spice  juicy and crisp.   The poke was maybe under flavored but left room for the very fresh fish to be appreciated in its subtle way.   I should have ordered more than two tacos  though this would likely fill a normal appetite. For an active man 180 pounds  4 tacos would be just right.   If I can brave the consumer driven mobs at the Domain  I will definitely be back 
Velvet Taco,236,As a taco restaurant  this store is very fancy. And food is very delicious  all my friends are thinking this maybe the best taco restaurant at Austin  Highly recommend Nashville Spicy hot tofu   if you order and eat at the restaurant  cuz the best tasty of this hot tofu is when is just come on the table with high temperature.  If you order it as a food delivery  the not recommend this tofu  cuz it s very oily when it get cold
Velvet Taco,237,This is not your typical taco joint. They have fusion tacos here. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. Towards the end  it started tasting more salty. I also tried the tiki chicken and that one is pretty spicy. The ahi poke one is really refreshing and comes with lettuce as a tortilla. I was very surprised that it was good. Overall a unique place with unique foods. I loved the bathrooms here. It s so quirky 
Velvet Taco,238,been here more times than i can count. Love all their different Tacos  highly recommend.
Velvet Taco,239,Wow  Never knew some of these combinations would be so delicious     I d recommend anyone in Austin to stop by here
Velvet Taco,240,Egg on tots was hard and burned not runny. My Korean pork taco was overdone. My son s rotisserie chicken taco was really good according to him.   Really a 3.5. I m willing to try again though.
Velvet Taco,241,Went in here after walking around searching for places that were open after 9 30pm  close to 10pm.  Walked in and immediately was greeted by a friendly face. The lady asked who I was getting food for. I said my husband. She went and recommended some of the beef tacos to me and I ordered them for my husband.  Service at that late hour was still pretty decent and fast. Two taco orders came out nice and hot and good quality for around  4 a taco. Husband said it was okay tacos.   Will definitely come back and try some myself  
Velvet Taco,242,We came by and it was still during lent so we ordered all the vegetarian options. I had the ahi poke taco - very hard to eat with the lettuce coating. I wish It was a bowl style to be honest. The fried paneer was to die for   it was my favorite with the tomato chutney. They also mistakenly gave me the mediterran one with the falafel. it was good but again the lettuce one is hard to eat My husband had the cod fish and chips one said it tasted like air. no flavor. But enjoyed the fried paneer also.   we will be bk. although Saturday night might be the hardest since it was PACKED. Took almost 45 min for our order to be ready  get the side corn bc it will be what holds you over till the food gets there.
Velvet Taco,243,This place is amazing  The workers are always so friendly especially Austin  Austin is awesome  such a hard worker and always makes sure my husband and I are taken care of. Thank you for always being a bright light at this place  We definitely appreciate you 
Velvet Taco,244,This Place Is Absolutely Amazing  The Food  The Service  The Atmosphere.. It Is All Stellar   Everyone Here Is Great  Especially Austin  He Is Definitely Going In The Right Direction And Is Making Something Of Himself As I Type This  GOD Bless Them And GOD Bless You   
Velvet Taco,245,Emily is the best   She helped me understand the vegetarian menu and what I will like 10 10 recommend
Velvet Taco,246,We ordered all vegetarian options and they were very good. My personal favorite is falafel in lettuce wrap. My partner likes tofu one.
Velvet Taco,247,Velvet Taco at the Domain has an interesting and original menu filled with novelty tacos that should make you salivate. Unfortunately  the final product is just OK.   While being yuppie isn t a crime  the tacos look better than they taste. Served in a very cool  and expensive too  according to an employee  taco tray  the tacos look spotless. Unfortunately  the tortilla was bland and the sauces were not memorable. The protein  in this case crispy tofu and falafel patties  was the only tasty part of the taco.  Where s spice  Where s the kick  Where s the soul of this taco   I kept wondering as I ate. I never could locate them.  The chips and queso were also slightly sub-par  especially compared to other local Tex-Mex chains like Torchy s and Chuy s. The chips were thin and tasted like corn-flavored paper  and the queso was also disappointing.  Perhaps their tacos are targeted at a more bland  subdued palate    That being said  Velvet Taco has a really nice patio and the staff is very friendly and helpful. And the velvet cake was nice. At least there s that.
Velvet Taco,248,I was so excited to finally have the opportunity to go to Velvet Taco  everyone I know raved about it. But I was so saddened as it was just lacking in everything. Since we had a late brunch  I wasn t starving  so I ordered one chicken tikka taco  which is a specialty and what everyone I know loves. We also got elote and one margarita to share.  We ordered and got ourselves a table on the outside patio. A few min later  our order was ready and we brought it to our table. The first thing I noticed was that the waxy type paper had liquid on it  but I couldn t figure it out. Anyways  I take one bite anddd....undercooked rice and oil dripping down.  I ate the taco but it was so underwhelming. The elote was good  which I noticed it was a thing in TX.
Velvet Taco,249,Chicken tikka  made with crispy tofu  delicious and a good kick   chicken and waffle taco   my husband s  he said it was delicious  and the WTF special  coconut breaded chicken with mango chutney   carrots and micro greens  husband said it was hella good    .  The girl at the front counter looked like she was on Thorazine and was not a friendly or enthusiastic front of house person.
Velvet Taco,250,In my recent adventure of Austin  Texas I visited an area I use to frequent which is called The Domain. The Domain is a elevated square plaza mall type of atmosphere. Outdoor retail shops and restaurants galore. However it s expanded greatly and I came across this gem upon crusading around bars on a Thursday evening.   Initially my review was going very south quickly due to my order being given to another table of drunk people. When I brought it to attention it seemed to be an inconvenience even though I was blankly not at fault.   The worst part is the party I was with decided to wait until everyone had food  which put them out of eating for another 20 minutes. Late at night there s cause for confusion  I get it  especially seeing how most people at 11 30pm in this are are inebriated. However  just because the crowd is relaxed - doesn t mean you get to skip on service or hospitality.   That being said  the manager did appear to finally step in and do the right thing. Where he seemed annoyed and put off by the ordeal - after I had voiced my concern and asked about his name for follow up - he then came over to my table and apologize - then offered my money back for the  food . Yes I had a beer too.   Luckily for this guy the food is tremendously amazing. I had the tots which came with a mess of things on top and an Ahi taco which was absolutely clean and fresh    Food is A     Hospitality and speed of service could use some work.  Especially since you re in a high transit area - don t take advantage of that    I d definitely return but not before trying a few more favorites in the area.
Velvet Taco,251,I was born  amp  raised 2hrs from the Mexican border. I know what great tacos taste like. These are just ok.  Some flavors are close to perfection... i.e. Grilled Flank Steak was SO close--but it was mostly salt-savory with no sweet-or-tang to balance it out. Others were good but with an almost muted taste. And while I m all for unexpected ingredient combinations for a surprise factor  some of the combos were not well accepted by me palatte... or my stomach.  Note to the chef s ... keep trying those interest combos... and maybe some well-matched spices... and the tacos will be so much more fulfilling   My favorite part of this restaurant  The bathroom. Seriously  it s worth going to just for the bathroom... it s the same regardless of your gender  so no one will be left out of the experience.
Velvet Taco,252,My boyfriend and I ordered the  Rotisserie Chicken taco Buffalo Chicken taco Fish n Chips taco Bacon and Eggs taco   General consensus for this place is just meh okay. The tortillas were breaking and there s so much  juice  from the meat that made it soggy. Flavor wise of everything just also just meh and kind of bland for how much stuff they list. Overall it s not worth the wait or time but if you re already here and they re no line then go for it. There s for sure another spot that s well known and much better IMO.
Velvet Taco,253,Velvet Taco and it s staff are fabulous  I took 16 girls to Velvet Taco in the Domain for my daughters 13th birthday and had the best experience  Devin and Phillip were phenomenal and made sure we had everything we needed and made things go smoothly  That s no easy thing with 16 girls  I can t say enough great things about the people and of course food at Velvet Taco   
Velvet Taco,254,This little taco place does a lot of bussiness. The prices are a little high but the flavors are great. This place is located in the Rock Rose area of the Domain and they seem to fit right in. They offer counter service and many communal tables. If your afraid of anything spicy be sure to ask if about it at the counter.  Don t just assume that it won t be......  I never got around to having the red velvet cake. I will have to try it on our next trip. I enjoyed this place. The menu is unique  the food is good and it has a fun energy  about it.
Velvet Taco,255,Literally my favorite taco place. Sooo many options for vegetarians  There s usually packed but still get your food out in max 10 minutes. Absolutely must try the red velvet cake 
Velvet Taco,256,Occasion   Dinner with friends before a networking event  OMG Tacos   This place makes me wish I was a competitive eater so I could eat at least one of every one they have.  I would be SO happy if I could eat all 20  varieties of taco. And some elote.  And a piece of cake.  But I could only power through 3 of them -  I had the Fried Paneer  Ahi Poke  and Steak N Egg.  They were all delicious so I can t even really pick a favorite.  I guess the Paneer  because it was the most unique.  My friend also got a piece of red velvet cake and was kind enough to share so I can vouch for the cake too.  Another thing I liked about this place is that they have the coolest bathroom area.  The doors are a collection of old doors from all different places  and there s a communal sink that takes up the entire middle of the room.  Loved it   Would I recommend return   Hell yes   I will probably eat there again tonight and just get different tacos.
Velvet Taco,257,Velvet Taco is a very attractive spot  the atmosphere draws you in and the tacos all have a unique look. If you re looking for a  Instagram  worthy spot then this is it.   The majority of the staff is very nice  however the last time I visited they had my order wrong and I let them know. The lady who was calling orders seemed very irritated and non apologetic about the mix up. Not cool  when it comes to customer service.   The food some days is really great  some days it s just okay. I like to try different tacos when I visit  however I will order stuff I ve had in the past which again sometimes it s great the first time and not so great the second time around. The queso is always a hit as well as the tots.   This is a great spot for after hours quick treat. The plus is that the prices aren t too bad.
Velvet Taco,258,Delicious Tacos  2 tacos was a good amount of food and a good price  but I think if I go back I ll make sure I m very hungry so I can get 3 tacos for more variety. I m usually not a huge fan of fusion restaurants  but Velvet Tacos really nailed the various cuisines and also put a nice twist on hwo they made them into a taco. For example  the chicken and waffles taco actually had a pressed waffle as the shell.
Velvet Taco,259,Tacos were some of the worst I ve ever had  the tortillas were like grease rags. The veggies were overall gross with the cilantro having a weird taste and the onions super undercooked  and a huge slab of mushroom. The margaritas were sour and the queso was just kind of lackluster. I truly came into this restaurant open-minded to try a twist on my favorite food but was disappointed. The only thing I can say is the food came out within 10 minutes  but it was disappointingly already cold.
Velvet Taco,260,Finally got the chance to try this place. I would say it s definitely a keeper in my book for the Rock Rose area  there are definite misses on food in this area and this place is not one of them.   Woohoo for good tacos in the domain  It s a fast casual order at the counter and they call your number and you grab your tacos. There are so many options that I only was able to try two of the options this first go around. I got the  2 Rotisserie Chicken and  12 Angus Brisket. The chicken was definitely the best of the two  the tortilla on the other one was too crispy it broke when you ate it so then everything went everywhere  Not saying the chicken ones content didn t end up going everywhere too. Maybe it you had plates or something it would be better to save your contents  but it was good I didn t let it go to waste. The crisp tots were good as well  definitely a large side and worth sharing.   The only down side for me was the red velvet cake  odd since it s in the name  it was dry dry dry and not very flavorful nor sweet without the sauce. I was not a fan one bit of the cake  which is unfortunate since I love dessert  but lucky for me there is a cupcake joint in the same area that knows Red Velvet.   I d come back for tacos and the corn next time. Can t wait to give all the tacos a try. No cake though  save yourself the money on the cake and get another taco or side instead.  Parking is a super pain though  since well it s the Domain you have the parking garage options but good luck there. Plan accordingly for time to look for parking and to walk over here. The service I would say is so so but there is little interaction with people since it s fast casual  just have to place your order with someone. The girl who rang me up wasn t very helpful on selecting tacos or friendly but hey whatever I was there for the food not her friendship.
Velvet Taco,261,Finally  a taco spot in the Domain  and it s awesome   Velvet Taco started in Texas and fits in perfect with the fun and vibrant atmosphere of Rock Rose.  I can t wait until the outdoor covered patio is finished.  This spot is good breakfast - dinner.  Just walk up to the counter  give your order  and find a seat and wait for your name to be called.   What sets them apart   They make everything from scratch.  They slow roast their own chicken and corn  and make their own tortillas.  Some of their tacos even have different types of tortillas that best compliment the flavor of that style of taco.  The corn tortilla here is one of the best that I have had in Austin.  By now  I have had several of their tacos.  It s hard to pick a favorite as they are all good.  My top three favorite tacos are  12  the rotisserie chicken taco  and the ahi tuna  although very messy  .  I love that the ahi tuna taco is served in a lettuce wrap. They also lettuce wrap their falafel taco.    Besides their tacos  the gourmet tots are a meal by themselves.  They are NOT to be missed. It requires a spoon fork to eat them   Served with an egg on top  the first thing you want to do is crack the yolk  and mix everything all up.  That way every bite is full of yummy cheesy  egg  bacon  and tot goodness.    The frozen margaritas are boozy and made with fresh fruit and sorbet.  They are delicious   One of the better frozen margaritas I have had.  They also have some beer on tap  even a selection from Pinthouse   You can also get Infinite Monkey Theorem wine cider in the can  and other canned beer options.  For non-alcoholic options they have real sugar fountain sodas  and three unsweetened iced teas to choose from.  I love that they have free soda water  and you can add in fresh sliced lime or lemon wedges.  The price is also on point. Quality at an affordable cost. There is a reason this is one of my new favorite spots.    Next up to try  Their backdoor chicken to go.  Just reserve it in advance and pick it up later.  A meal in a bag.  One whole rotisserie chicken with sides.
Velvet Taco,262,Came to check this place out for Taco Tuesday and felt this was mediocre. Out of all the other tacos places I ve tried  Tacodeli and Torchy s  I felt their tacos were complex with all the ingredients they added to their tacos. Don t get me wrong  their tacos are tasty but over saturated with sauces and ingredients.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken that was alright. The chicken tikka masala taco was tasty but the Indian tikka flavors was not coming through  I got more of a spicy tart flavor from the taco. The chicken had a nice crispy texture which had a nice contrast from the soft tortilla shell and rice.   The  elote  was delicious  it s pretty much the Velvet Taco take on the Mexican corn in a cup with the the mixture of mayo  Parmesan and lime    I was tempted to try the red velvet cake as I was eyeing it at the cashier counter but strayed away. I will come back for it next time 
Velvet Taco,263,Have recently ordered through Uber Eats  amp  SO good    Spicy Tikka Chicken  amp  Grilled Flank Steak
Velvet Taco,264,Tacos are very good   my favorite is Cauliflower tacos and Nashville Tofu. Red velvet cake is amazing. The only drawback is sometimes the order takes a lot of time. However  I still recommend this place for its amazing tacos.
Velvet Taco,265,Having moved from Dallas and not visited Velvet Taco yet  I was highly anticipating going to the new location that was opening in The Domain. When they finally opened  I didn t miss a beat and visited the very next week.   The rotisserie chicken taco was absolute bliss. It was tender  mixed with sweet corn and other veggies  and lightly spiced. However  the roasted angus brisket was flavorful but way too oily for my liking.   After finishing my meal  I went along my merry way and headed home  but felt violently sick on the way back. As much as it pains me to give the two star review   because I really was rooting for this place  I felt I had to because I had a less than pleasant experience after the fact. I hope that others have a much better experience   5 10 would  probably not  recommend this place to others.
Velvet Taco,266,This is a cool new taco spot that offers crazy  unique tacos. I love Indian food so tried the spicy chicken tikka taco and was very impressed  Nice hint of spice  full of flavor  Highly recommend 
Velvet Taco,267,I ve come here a few times while staying nearby. First time I picked up tacos to-go  picnic chicken and fish n chips  and was not super impressed. But the most recent time I came I got the buffalo chicken and  Korean pork taco along with a margarita and it was much better   There are definitely better traditional tacos but for interesting and delicious combinations Velvet Taco is a great place. Also their margarita is surprisingly strong.   I wouldn t come out of my way to go here  but if you re in the domain and craving a taco or a margarita it s a fantastic choice.
Velvet Taco,268,So. Many. Tacos  I love that there s such a variety of flavors on the menu from tikka masala to ah  poke to shrimp n grits. I opted for the  4 and  6 without the sauces. The  4 had a great buffalo sauce flavor and the tofu was crispy. The  6 had a yummy falafel and was served in lettuce instead of in a tortilla. It was a bit messy as a result but still really good    I ve been eyeing the red velvet cake since the first time I went there and this time my friend got it so I finally was able to try a bite   It was a huge slice and very tasty. Also it just occurred to me that maybe this is why velvet is in the name 
Velvet Taco,269,Velvet Taco has deservingly branched into Austin  Very unique tacos and we re not talking about Taco Deli or Torchy s unique. We re talking chicken and waffle taco  Falafels  Banh Mi  Pull Pork BBQ  Fried Paneer  Poke Bowls  Fried Tofu or Tikka Masala inside a taco unique. I do praise this place but the only thing is that is SO HEAVY. Everything they make is to make you extremely full and extremely sluggish later. Open late so definitely satisfying to the bar goers. I do recommend to try at least once and come perhaps one or twice a year for the health s sake.  The Fried Paneer Taco is the vegetarian best seller. It is cornstarch  or tempera fried  so it has an extra thick but light and fresh outer fried coating and a melty cube of cheese in the center topped with a white creamy ranch like sauce. Spicy oil from the fry seeping on the sides and dripping down from the taco. For refreshment  sweet pickled red onion tops it with cilantro.  Still way too heavy for me though . Also had Elote corn with bacon  ok  enough for me  and then Loaded Fried Tator Tots with cheese and bacon  well  I guess I ll try one spoo  ugh...   Unlike Houston or Dallas locations  the wait is minimal and not detouring me somewhere else instead. This location also seems to have fresher ingredients and time is taken in making the tacos. Probably since they are not working over their capacity all the time like the other busier locations.
Velvet Taco,270,Tasty tacos  but a bit pricey especially given their size. I m a big eater so I need at least 3 tacos to feel satiated - haha.  I love the variety  and when it comes to presentation  you probably won t find a prettier taco. I just need a bit more substance at 1 am after a night of drinking  - 
Velvet Taco,271,I don t do reviews very often but my experience at Velvet Taco in the Domain was superb.  It was my birthday and first visit to this place.  The tacos were EXTREMELY tasty -- can t decide if the spicy chicken tikka or the slow roasted angus brisket tacos were my favorite. Didn t have one person not like their tacos.  Great queso too.  In addition to the excellent tasting tacos  the service was second to none.  Michael made me and my party of 11 others feel right at home and well taken care of.  I would give 6 stars on a scale of 5 if I could.    Highly recommend.
Velvet Taco,272,Tacos with a twist  Had so many flavor combos it was hard to choose. I wanted to try them all maybe mini taco sampler would be a fun idea for restaurant. Oh well  it just means I have to eat and repeat.  Had curry coconut cheese nachos with blue corn tortilla chips. Interesting but didn t have a huge flavor variation from regular nachos. They were tasty.  Also had pork taco meat was good. Would have wanted more veges. Great value  great experience for this order at counter restaurant And soda fountain had cane sugar variations like mango and lime.  Tacos and drinks without guilt
Velvet Taco,273,My FAVORITE taco joint. I am head over heels for the side of tots with the egg and aioli. The burger taco is always a must for me because it has so much flavor  and any of the chicken tacos to complement  They have definitely added lots of new things to the menu  and they re all unique and  sound delicious. The elote is a definite MUST. If you haven t tried it  definitely give the red velvet cake a shot.  I do like the Austin location  as I usually go to the Deep Ellum Dallas location  because it s spacious with lots of seating 
Velvet Taco,274,This is the worst tacos place I ve been to. The manager was so rude. The cashier took our order and then the manager came to us  in a bossy way  to tell us that he can t make separate order for each one in our party   we will make one order and you have to figure out who orders what  that was his response. Well  you should have told us that before taking 5 ppl order and not after the fact. Such a shitty place  I ll never go back
Velvet Taco,275,Seemed like a cool joint so walked in with not much of an exception. Gotta give them credit for the way they have customized the Taco. Tried the Angus Beef Taco which was brilliant  the Red Velvet cake was pretty good too. Would go there again for their fusion Taco s if I m around the Austin area 
Velvet Taco,276,Service was good  staff efficient  amp  friendly. Was really excited about the vegetarian taco options  however as far as taste it was just ok for me. Not bad but not anything great.
Velvet Taco,277,Yesterday wasn t my first time at Velvet Taco  in fact I frequent Velvet Taco cause the food is SO good and there are so many vegetarian friendly options. However yesterday s service at the register was surprisingly bad  which was disheartening. I brought my family members in for their first time and they were treated horribly. If you re going to have someone work the register  please ensure it s someone friendly and someone who won t belittle you if you ask  between these two  which would you recommend      Food gets 5 stars  But service yesterday gets 1 star.
Velvet Taco,278,I really wanted to love this place. I m from Dallas and never went to the one there. I got the elote corn  tikka chicken taco and grilled flank steak taco. I was surprised the tacos lacked flavor  I love spicy food but there wasn t much spice to it. I tried the 2 sauces which are bottled but they were really spicy. One was like a traditional hot sauce and the other tasted like a habanero hot sauce. I did use some on my tacos. The corn was on point. Had a good amount of cheese and hot sauce. Wish I finished it but I was saving room for the tacos. I m not sure I will be back. But definitely give it a try if you are in Rock Rose. The chicken tikka pieces were huge and the chicken was cold  which was disappointing. There was also a lot of rice in the taco. The grilled steak was fine  big pieces again but the charred onions were flavorful.
Velvet Taco,279,This was my first stop after flying into Austin for vacation and let me just say I was NOT disappointed. Went for the Ahi poke and shrimp and grits tacos. Obviously two very different choices but both unique and fantastic in their own way.  The ahi poke was different from what I expected in that it came on lettuce instead of a traditional taco shell-- but honestly I was pretty thrilled since it made for a healthier option  and essentially tasted like a poke bowl. Yum   The shrimp and grits was probably the more interesting of the two. Good sized shrimp along with grits and some spices  absolutely delicious  would recommend.
Velvet Taco,280,Damn  That s a damn good fancy taco    I  m in love with the fish and chips taco for real. Flakey battered fish  slaw  fries and a curry mayo sauce all rolled into a perfect taco.   The sauce is sooo good - but DAMN  that curry smell will stick to ya. I get mine with the sauce on the side so I don t smell like a Calcutta whorehouse all day    At  6 dollars though.... not a bargain.
Velvet Taco,281,Oh. My. Gosh. Velvet Taco  A strange name  wonderful concept  and amazing food.. if I lived in Austin  this would undoubtedly be my go-to spot for kooky street tacos   We came here simply because it s name stood out on the list of nearby restaurants  and it had pretty awesome reviews -it definitely surpassed the hype  and ended up being my favorite non-bbq spot I ate at while visiting this city    in fact  we liked it so much we kept coming back even though we had plenty of other options to choose from    In toto  I got to try what felt like almost their entire menu  and I m not sure which was my favorite - to name a few  the Chicken and Waffles was a wonderful balance of sweet and savory  the Fish n Chips had perfectly crisped fish with an unexpected curry mayo  the Brisket didn t disappoint given Austin s love of bbq  the Shrimp and Grits was amazing  hadn t really been a fan of grits before this trip  but after this taco  I m looking at recipes   the Chicken Tikka wasn t too spicy and I liked that there was rice to soak up the sauce  and the Flank Steak had wonderful flavor  and portobello mushrooms     If I had to choose  I d probably say the Chicken and Waffles were my favorite  but I m obsessed with anything that pairs these together  and another dining partner said she d get the Chicken Tikka again if she could.. aka you really can t go wrong with anything on the menu     Save room for the sides and dessert tho -their Tater Tots were insane  I was full but still managed to eat half   and the Elote Corn was creamy  cheesy perfection. Plus  their name refers to their Red Velvet Cake  which is served as a massive slice with extra glaze drizzled all over.. I m drooling just writing this    I liked that the tacos are generously sized  so you can order as many as you re feeling hungry for.. you ll probably end up wanting to try them all tho  so come hungry    service is fast and friendly  just make sure you find a spot to sit since they definitely get crowded quickly 
Velvet Taco,282,Great place for a quick taco bite. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable for a quick lunch bite. I ordered the paneer taco which was good. Not the best taco in town but decent for an occasional visit if one is in the area.
Velvet Taco,283,A run for Torchy s money   Working in the Domain sure has it s perks. Walked over to Velvet Taco to grab some lunch. The staff was incredibly friendly  they weren t super busy and we took it to go within 15 minutes. The restaurant was sparkling clean and it has a fun ambiance that makes me want to go back for a margarita on the patio.  So the food...I ordered a  12 which is the Slow Roasted Angus Brisket. It was delicious. I have to say the meat didn t have a ton of flavor on its own  but it was tender. The toppings were what brought it all together  especially the red chile mayo. I also added some of their hot sauce and was not at all disappointed  It packed some heat and wasn t overly vinegary.   My favorite part of all was the queso blanco that I ordered instead of the queso on the menu. I would say it was probably some of the best queso I ve had. It was simple  topped with some onion strings and a bay leaf. The chips are blue corn  lightly salted and not at all greasy. Best of all  they withstand deep dippin in the queso   Seriously...get this. Have this.   I can t wait to go back and try more of their tacos. They aren t trying to be a Torchy s replacement so don t go in there with all your Torchy s loyalty on your sleeve  they are totally doing their own thing  and from what I ve seen  they re doing it well.
Velvet Taco,284,The food is great location amazing. I just can t give it a 5 because when it is late the wait time is INSANE. Understood that they are open till 2 for the drinker s. Just wish it was a bit faster. Other then that one thing  this place is EVERYTHING
Velvet Taco,285,We are obsessed with the red velvet cake here  but it has gone downhill BAD lately...this is what we got tonight....it s like a 1 4 of what they used to give and 1 8th of the sauce. Disappointing from a place that we used to love and support...
Velvet Taco,286,Cold food and crap service. Im still waiting on someone to contact me about a refund.
Velvet Taco,287,Had a hankering for late-night tacos during the week in Austin and the options were somewhat limited after 9pm on a Wednesday. Enter Velvet Taco  open late and an adventurous menu that has a little something for everyone.  Want traditional tastes  They ve got that  Low country shrimp and grits taco  They ve got that too  Fried chicken taco wrapped in a thin waffle shell with butter and syrup    Yes  they ve got that as well. Red Velvet cake for dessert  Check and mate.  All of your taco dreams come true in this fast casual taqueria. Dine outside with a marg and enjoy the people watching from the fan cooled patio.
Velvet Taco,288,Update 8 31 18 This place has outstanding service  After leaving my initial review  I was contacted by the owner Mike who invited me to come back to give Velvet Taco another try. The manager on duty took care of us  and we had an amazing experience. I got to have my new favorite taco - the hamburger taco and it was delicious. My wife loved it so much she got one of her own. Queso was great just like last time and they even gave us free drinks on the house. Thanks again for everything and we ll definitely be coming back   Coconut queso was great and the enjoyable part. Tacos so so. I got the flank steak which had two small pieces of meat and 3 giant mushroom pieces. Wasn t that flavorful. Also got shrimp and grits taco which tasted like a bucket of sea water- the fried grit balls were yummy but sea water taste was too strong. My fianc  didn t like that the tortillas were raw and not heated  and the corn in her taco was cold. Maybe we got the wrong tacos.
Velvet Taco,289,Whether you re trying to have a delicious taco for lunch or you need some good drunk food after a night out on Rockrose with your friends  this is your place  
Velvet Taco,290,Velvet Taco exceeded my expectations   I always pass by this place whenever I go to Tarka right next door  amazing restaurant as well  and decided to finally check it out one Saturday morning. They open at 10am which is exactly when I got there. The menu is easy to read and I love how the tacos are separated by the proteins. More places need to do this  I ordered the buffalo chicken and spicy tikka chicken tacos  and the red curry coconut queso. The order took a while to come out but when it did everything looked so  so appetizing. Both tacos were very good and each had a unique flavor. The queso was also one of a kind-- never had anything like it  but it was great   Two tacos and a side of queso ran me a little less than  15. Not a bad price especially if you decide to share. Definitely stop by 
Velvet Taco,291,Velvet Taco takes your favorite food dishes from every ethnicity and makes them into an awesome taco. Ex  Chicken tikka ... into a taco   chicken and waffles ... into a taco BBQ Brisket ...into a taco.  Plus like a dozen other things. Etc etc.   These were some of the best tacos I ever had. They were big too  and I m a pudgy ass dude. Indoor Outdoor seating. Clean plus they have beer on tap. Amazing experience.
Velvet Taco,292,Our first time trying out Velvet Taco. We arrived at 11 30 am for lunch on a weekday.  After ordering  they take your name and call it out when your order s ready for pick up. You can choose corn or flour tortillas. We beat the lunch rush because our food came out within 10 minutes. There were plenty of open seats at 11 30 am however  later ALL of the seats were taken and some parties had to sit outside on the patio and it was 65 F.   I had the shrimp and grits taco. Blackened shrimp were well-seasoned and cooked perfectly but I did not like the spicy tex-mex salsa  charred tomato salsa  that comes on top of it. I would suggest Velvet Taco add a different sauce instead - or next time I would order this taco and request a different sauce. Also  there was hardly any jack cheese grits in the taco. I liked the elote corn however there was too much of the cream sauce. Torchy s street corn is better. My friend had the flank steak taco and didn t like the oregano in it. Still  I will eventually try their other menu items.
Velvet Taco,293,While entertaining visiting business clients  a colleague recommended Velvet Taco as a good spot for upscale  Texas tacos. Could she ever had been wrong. This restaurant is more for college student friend gatherings families with kids type place. We felt out of place wearing suits and dresses. Further  the food was slightly lackluster. While extravagant in description and picture  our tacos were mediocre. We spent well over  75 for 8 tacos  3 slices of red velvet cake and drinks. Just wished the food was more flavorful and better quality. Honesty I think Torchy Tacos are WAAAY better   I definitely will be back when only WITH FRIENDS on a weekend to enjoy a margarita while talking  amp  laughing on their fabulous outside benches. Great for people watching and taking in The Domain   ...just not a good spot for business-type guests.
Velvet Taco,294,Saturday night there was along line but  we got our food quickly. Friendly staff and the food was good.  The spicy tika Taco is delicious  yes it is a spicy but not fire spicy.
Velvet Taco,295,So... we purchased Torchy s and Velvet Taco at the same time in the name of science.  We ordered so many tacos from this place  and I think it goes a long way saying that none of them were terribly memorable.   Because of that I will have to summarize my experience by saying it was a great attempt at combining flavors into super cool different ideas. But at the price point I really was not a huge fan of this place.   Queso was okay  I didn t like the consistency but I did like the flavor. And the chips that came with it were horrible. Soggy  I don t know if that is the right word they definitely were not crispy.   THE VERDICT  I am not sure who wins in the battle. They both are doing something new and inventive but not delivering at a respectable price point for the quality. However... the red velvet cake was delightful with a little lechera. I am glad I went  because now I know I don t have to ever again.
Velvet Taco,296,Probably the best tacos I ve ever had. Every bite was pleasurable. The margaritas are strong and the bathrooms are super clean. I m impressed.
Velvet Taco,297,We love Velvet Taco. Our favorites are the Fish and Chips and Picnic Chicken. Their taco of the month is always worth a try too. Their service is usually good too. The four star rating is for the derogatory comment the cashier made about the amount of food we ordered.
Velvet Taco,298,I have loved velvet taco but I hadn t tried to Austin location  so came for the first time today  Gorgeous interior  plenty of seating  clean  nice staff  and overall I just had a great experience. I got the backdoor chicken and it is so delicious and worth the price. It s  20 for a full on rotisserie chicken with two sides of elite  corn salsa  and 6 tortillas   I normally like getting the individual tacos but this wa so delicious. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and I love the elite corn on the side. Definitely coming back again for this 
Velvet Taco,299,A Texas Taco staple  and it s even better since it s located in The Domain  They have some of the most unique taco options I ve ever seen  chicken Tikka masala  fish and chips  falafel  pulled pork with amazing pickled onions  and brunch tacos all day   Try all of the tacos  you won t be disappointed  The tacos are pretty large too - I usually get 2 and I m good.  There are flour  corn  and lettuce tortillas available  and they can accommodate gluten and dairy allergies.  Service is always quick. Prices range from around  3.50- 5 per taco  but it s worth it.  There s plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available. Street parking and parking garage available.   Bonus  They re open super late 
Velvet Taco,300,These were the best tacos I ve ever had  they were an entire meal in a tortilla  I had the chicken and waffle taco and the apple slaw went perfectly with it  My fianc  had the chicken tika masala and it was like we went to an authentic indian restaurant  We will definitely be going back 
Velvet Taco,301,The Queso is to die for        I always get an order of it with warm chips and it will make your day
Velvet Taco,302,Love this place and am grateful they close late since I work a late job. Their margaritas are a little stronger than expected though  so be aware before ordering.  Also a little more pricey for what you get. That s the only reason why I gave them 4 stars.
Velvet Taco,303,Had the rotisserie chicken tacos  the chicken was in big chunks and extremely dry. They do not heat up the corn tortillas so they crumbled immediately  did not make it to first bite. I ate my  taco  with the wooden spork. With the amount of taco places intown I would not go back. The side of Mexican corn in a cup was good.
Velvet Taco,304,My son and I were looking somewhere to stop in for lunch at the Domain  so we decided to try this place.  The guys taking our order suggested two tacos   the  12  brisket  and the  18  chicken and waffle   so I ordered both of them.  We sat outside on this beautiful day and watched people walk by  many of them with dogs.  The food took a little longer than I d like  but when it did come out  I was very happy.  Both tacos were delicious and full of fresh ingredient flavor.  My son also had two tacos  and he loved them.  To get out of an experience like this for  26 made it even better.  I don t really like going to the Domain for any occasion  but next time I m there  I ll probably be back to Velvet Taco.
Velvet Taco,305,Food is inconsistent and online ordering and phone orders get turned off randomly to prevent any excess ordering. Should be better prepared.
Velvet Taco,306,Amaaaaaaaaazing Tacos.... always and every time   Devin The manager is very helpful and friendly. The staff is great the food is always amazing. Truly enjoy coming here  
Velvet Taco,307,I m not sure how they are able to make the tofu taco taste like chicken  that is a talent.  Shrimp and grits taco are fire. I really like the tacos I just wish they were a bit cheaper. This is one of my favorite taco spots in Austin
Velvet Taco,308,Really liked this place  It was the only place in the Domain on a Saturday night without an insane wait.   I got two tacos - the falafel and a chicken one - I really liked both of them and that you can make your taco a bit healthier with a lettuce wrap     Super reasonably priced and the patio is lovely if the weather is nice out 
Velvet Taco,309,Great location. I was just walking around and checking out the shopping in the area  felt a little hungry  stopped in for the first time to grab some tacos. Walked right up to the counter  placed my order  sat outside and waited for them to call my name. Plenty of seating inside  but I like sitting outside and people watch. Because it s made to order and fresh  the wait time is a slower  we re talking quality  so it s worth the wait. And to be honest  it s not a long wait. Tacos had a great spicy taste to them which I loved. Not bland at all. I would go back again
Velvet Taco,310,I love there shrimp and grits tacos      Those are by far the best tacos I have had     If your reading this you need to go and get a shrimp and grits taco. And a slice of red velvet cake as well. Tell them I referred you    
Velvet Taco,311,Ordering at Velvet Taco can really make or break your experience here.  Moreso than other  5 taco joints  since Velvet Taco doesn t rely on slathering everything in delicious molten cheese. Choose wisely.  Thus far the spicy chicken tikka and annatto shredded pork are clear favorites. Things fall off pretty rapidly from there. The  fish n chips  is just okay  while the falafel taco is an absolute disaster  the lettuce wrap falls apart and the innards want to shoot out the second you apply any pressure to the sides of the  taco.    We ve been twice and each time the service has been surprisingly quick  but I think Velvet Taco suffers from stiff competition  both within Rock Rose and from Austin s notoriously strong taco game.
Velvet Taco,312,We waited over a hour for our food and didn t get no apology or anything. We were the last ones out of the restaurant and not even the last ones to order. Honestly it was wack asf because I love velvet but the service was absolutely horrible. Y all need to get your ish together. I understand mess ups but when you don t even acknowledge it and act like nothing happened is when I have a problem.
Velvet Taco,313,Are you kidding me    This was my thought when I bit into my order. I can t believe I didn t know what flavor was   So.... This place does tacos of various varieties  duh  and it s really swanky but urban chic...industrial tables with paper towel rolls instead of napkins. I had a chicken taco with toppings from heaven and the gods. Wait... I think it was probably pico  elote add cheese but same thing..lol  At first I thought  5 for one taco was crazy.... I d pay  6.  WINNER   
Velvet Taco,314,Very creative and original tacos   Weird as Austin   I come here with my wife and teenage children and we all love it. It is hard to tell which taco is our favorite because there are several   8 Annato Shredded Pork   11 Grilled Flank Steak   12 Slow Roasted Angus Beef are some we love. The queso and the corn are really good. The velvet cake is yummy too. Big enough to share   The best thing is that it opens late  
Velvet Taco,315,So sad  This place used to be soo good with homade tortillas  They have no resorted to store bought tortillas. Also a lot of flies at the bar  they need some kind of fly trap.  I had the rotisserie chicken and fish tacos   they were both dry. Not sure what s going on here but they used to be sooooo good  Bring back the damn purple homemade tortilla  And obviously need new staff to cook food properly. Won t be back
Velvet Taco,316,Go for the tacos stay for the velvet cake. If you like fish tacos this is definitely your place. You would probably get full with two tacos. They have a homemade velvet cake which is out of this world. The outdoor sitting area is also very nice.
Velvet Taco,317,Chicken Tikka taco is the best if you wanna be cultured   The rest are pretty good but not amazing. The elote  corn  is A MUST 
Velvet Taco,318,Ridiculous.  Fancy tacos do not necessary. Just want a  2.00 carbs adada w celantro and nacho 
Velvet Taco,319,The food tasted just okay. Taco combinations were interesting  but they tasted a little plain  or overpowered by one flavor. The tacos were also kind of small for their price. All six of us ordered two each. I felt comfortable  but wasn t full. I recommend ordering at least three if you re here for a meal.  The Fish n  Chips - Fish was bland. It had too much mustard  as it was all I tasted. Flour tortilla was little hard  Cuban Pig - It tasted good  but the pork was dry. Tortilla was little hard.  Annatto Shredded Pork - It was visually appealing. The hibiscus corn tortilla was pretty  but I didn t like the flavor of it - it tasted sour. Pork was dry and bland.  Crisp Tots and Local Egg - The tots were perfectly crispy  but its pairings were strange and the egg on top made it hard to eat.
Velvet Taco,320,Had some issues with the flavors but Devin was amazing and helped make things right.  The gal at the register is a rock star 
Velvet Taco,321,Velvet Taco is a favorite of mine when I stay in The Domain. It s very popular  so I try to go in the off hours to avoid the long line. They are open really late so they are the perfect place to go when I have the late-night munchies. They have an incredible variety of tacos and the sides are great. My favorite is the esquites  Mexican style corn. I have always found the service at the counter to be friendly and knowledgeable.
Velvet Taco,322,Loved hanging out at the domain and tried this taco place and omg their tacos were better than I expected for a place that looks so commercialized to be. This place sells Margarita s and they are pretty strong. Red velvet is a must try. Wonderful area to get some shopping done and try some tacos.
Velvet Taco,323,My favorite taco lives here  Velvet taco is such a hit in the Fort Worth  Dallas area  so it s awesome to have a location in Austin. We traded them a torchy for a velvet. The buffalo chicken taco is covered in that special tangy red hot sauce. I normally am not a fan of blue cheese  but it works well in this taco  as it s not overly overpowering. The tacos are small for the price  but they are loaded up and pretty to look at.  The venue is one of the larger places to eat near rock rose. They also have a beautiful back patio filled with plants. The restroom area is actually really cool to look at. They are all gender neutral  and the sink area has great smelling soap. The line tends to be long  but moves quickly.  Tacos are the best  and there are so many genres to tacos  Velvet taco has the galmorous  Hollywood kind.
Velvet Taco,324,Late night hipster taco fix  Does the job  lots of curry influences in their tacos which is kind of weird. Service was phenomenal and their bathrooms are very cool. Loved the outdoor seating to people watch at 2am when the drunk people stumble out of the bars...they re open til 4am now.
Velvet Taco,325,Best spicy chicken tacos ever  I tried their falafel as well but thought it was a bit too bland for my liking. Fun interiors and great food. Highly recommend.
Velvet Taco,326,Everything we ordered was fantastic--the queso  all the different tacos and the margaritas. It was all so delicious   We ll be back soon 
Velvet Taco,327,Loved the tacos  I ended up getting the three vegetarian options that they have and the falafel one was my top pick. If you re in Austin  you must try this.
Velvet Taco,328,Love the salmon and the green chili pork. Such great combinations of flavor on both  plus they are gluten free. One of my favorite taco stops in Austin.
Velvet Taco,329,Slow roasted angus brisket and chicken and waffles 12 and 18  to die for. This is such an underrated joint I wish my friends had recommended to me. I stumbled upon it by accident when all my friends left Austin and I was left alone to travel. It s a bit up north  about a 30 min ride from downtown Austin  but it s worth the trek. The chicken and waffles were well made and not too sweet  and the slaw had lightened the overall taco so it didn t feel too heavy. The slow roasted angus brisket was so tender in the taco. Wah I can t wait to go back down the road. This was probably my favorite meal  more so than Gus  Terry Black  Gourdough s  Salt Lick  Scotty s BBQ...ahaha  you get the point. Fusion done so well here  Def a business I can see expanding and lasting in a competitive environment like LA.
Velvet Taco,330,Velvet Taco is a really unique experience  They serve specialty tacos with different sides  elote  tater tots  queso  red velvet cake .   Atmosphere  5 5 - the restaurant was spacious but packed  Nonetheless the vibes were really bright and vivid  which is probably expected for a Saturday night during Labor Day weekend. We had a great time chatting with the buzz around the restaurant.   Service  5 5 - you order at the front and wait for your name to get called  nothing special.  Food  3 5 - so this is obviously where the stars fall. We got a fair amount of tacos and they tasted interesting but it wasn t an amazing experience. The Cuban Pig is definitely a pass  but the brisket was notably good. I ve definitely had a better specialty taco elsewhere. The elote was good  but a little too salty for my taste. Queso was alright  pretty unique but nothing to go crazy over. The red velvet cake was good but  just a normal cake you can find at any drugstore bakery.   Overall  it was a mediocre experience. If the atmosphere wasn t as great as it was  we would have had a less-than-good experience here. It s a good place to try out  since we only had three of the many taco choices 
Velvet Taco,331,The  3.5  tacos NEVER disappoint    And today I tried the chicken  amp  waffles one and it was pretty decent. And this location has good service.  I would always recommend velvet taco  This location is definitely is up to par 
Velvet Taco,332,I kept hearing about this place and was finally able to check it out. I looked online at the menu and noticed they didn t have prices. I see why prices weren t listed because they are a little steep. You will pay  4 for one taco. Their tacos are average size  but different kinds of tacos are available. They serve a  7.00 margarita that is good and strong. This place is popular  therefore a line will form  but customer service is efficient and friendly. Plenty of inside outside seating is available.
Velvet Taco,333,Always happy with my order.    We come here for the red curry queso but stay for the tacos.
Velvet Taco,334,It is the fanciest Taco place I have ever been to. The ambience  the decor of this place and the atmosphere in the night was great. You order at the counter and they call your name when the food is ready.   There are 3 different taco options for vegetarians. 4. Nashville Hot Tofu 5. Fried Paneer 6. Falafel   I ordered  4 and  5 along with corn elote which I highly recommend. The Nashville hot tofu was the highlight for me. Fried paneer was interesting but a bit on the oily side.   My wife really enjoyed her Ahi Poke taco which had a generous serving of Ahi. There are a couple of different hot sauces in the counter to spice up your taco should you choose to.   Food came out in decent time and the staff were very friendly. Overall  a great place in Domain to enjoy some great food.
Velvet Taco,335,Let s taco bout it  Living here close to the domain as well as working in it of course I had to come try Velvet Taco  because who doesn t love tacos  Definitely a place with different kinds of tacos you commonly wouldn t be able to find else where  however the price leaves me hesitant from coming more often.   Overall the tacos are really good  you ll get interesting combos like a thai chicken style taco  burger  rotisserie chicken  all notable very good. Just though the price you pay for one small taco you could easily get 2-3 at other similar taco joints. The sizes themselves are about average size  but if you come during lunch expect to buy 2 maybe 3 if you re hungry  that can easily lead up to be around a  15 lunch.   There service also can be pretty slow  granted I have gone only during lunch times  don t expect to get food for around 30 minutes  a tad slow for my tastes for tacos.  Staff though is friendly and supposedly their velvet cake and tots are really good.
Velvet Taco,336,I don t know why this place has so many stars. I was not a fan because I was looking for authentic tacos but instead got this. They basically put another meal into the taco. I ordered the burger taco  buffalo chicken taco  and omelette taco. They put half a burger patty with cheese into the taco- that was my taco. Maybe I misunderstood...not sure. The omelette taco was like having omelette breakfast but with the extra taco outside. It s about 5 bucks for a taco so it isn t like cheap either.   The tots are good- highly recommend  Just don t get the tacos...
Velvet Taco,337,When non Austinites ask me what they absolutely need to try if they re in Austin for a couple of days  I always say tacos  but tbh I ve always felt pretty guilty that I couldn t make up my mind on what specific place. But after trying Velvet Taco for the first time the other day  I think this may just be that spot.   Collectively  we ordered the Texas Akaushi Bacon Burger  Cuban Pig  Slow-roasted Angus Brisket  Korean Pork  and shared a Red Curry Coconut Queso. The best ones were definitely the Slow-roasted Angus Brisket and the Korean Pork  and the Queso was a nice compliment. Candidly speaking  I ve had better tacos elsewhere in Austin  but the environment at Velvet Taco is the most accurate representation of Austin in one place. The servers are super friendly  the people eating in the restaurant are having a great time  there s dogs everywhere... it s just a really nice place to be and enjoy a good meal. Highly recommend.
Velvet Taco,338,Yay   Velvet taco in Austin  because  where is the Domain anyway   Is that a real place 
Velvet Taco,339,Just stopped in after getting a hat at Dick s. Was a little hesitant about the prices  but damn  that cuban pork taco was worth every penny. It has like three kinds of meat and filled us up. Don t hesitate 
Velvet Taco,340,I had the  18 Chicken and Waffle  and  12 Slow-roasted angus brisket. Both were delicious  but the chicken and waffle was tastier. I like the thin waffle as a replacement for tortilla. This taco is in its own category. The angus brisket was decent  but it wasn t as tasty as Torchy  The Democrat.
Velvet Taco,341,I ve heard so many good things about this restaurant.  So when the opportunity arose  I had to try it.  Came Thursday night after arriving in Austin.  I ordered the hamburger and brisket tacos... HAMBURGER was my Favorite... brisket was good as well. My cousin ordered the shrimp and grits one because I was too chicken to order ... was not ready to live on the wild side with that one... but to my surprise it was REALLY good too  so when I do go back... I will definitely order this one for myself.  It was plentiful and satisfying.  Not a long wait to order  and our food was prompt and fresh... will definitely go back to try other stuff on the menu.
Velvet Taco,342,My absolute favorite place to eat in the world. And that s saying something because I travel a lot. No matter where I am in the world  I always crave the unique flavors of Velvet Taco   The staff  the food  and the atmosphere are all amazing  You have to try the Tikka Chicken taco 
Velvet Taco,343,Beautiful restaurant  ok food.  It s such a pretty place  Spacious with ample seating indoors  amp  outside. Bathroom is a neat shared space with tons of quirky art. The service was great. The cashier went over popular and new items  amp  I decided on the popular angus brisket  amp  the new ahi poke. The presentation is nothing to rave about  I was a little disappointed with the looks. There s a lot of potential flavor wise. The angus brisket taco is definitely the most popular for very good reason. It s a solid choice. The ahi poke wasn t much of a flavor experience. Overall a good experience. I went with a friend who got the angus brisket  amp  spicy tikka chicken  amp  we both felt our 2nd choices were not as great as the angus brisket taco. Seems like the menu is hit or miss.
Velvet Taco,344,This place has a very nice atmosphere. I enjoyed it very much with the other people that I went with. They have an open kitchen area  so you know they re confident in their abilities. The food is reasonably priced in my opinion for the amount and the quality of the food. Everything I had was delicious. The restrooms are all unisex as well to help promote inclusivity to everyone in the community. Hands down a great place to eat at.
Velvet Taco,345,I LOVE their tacos but I went to the restroom and basically got pee all over my pants. I would have given a better review but the bathrooms need work especially what happened to my pants on a date night. HOW EMBARRASSING  Food is good but the restroom needs work 
Velvet Taco,346,What a treat  Came here for lunch and was impressed with all the different flavors they can put into a taco   Order at the counter  and have your name called when it s ready. I had the  10 burger taco  which had a lot of flavorful beef and crispy pieces of bacon.  And the  21 brisket breakfast  with tender brisket enveloped in egg and surrounded by fresh salsa. The food was very tasty and 2 tacos was just the right amount for me.  We also got the corn elote  which I highly recommend. Very light fresh flavors are a good starter to the tacos. My other half had the  12 brisket taco  which was my fav. The avocado and the sauce are a really nice cool compliment to the meatiness of the brisket.  Staff are nice and the outdoor area is perfect to sit and people watch.
Velvet Taco,347,This my new favorite taco joint in the town. For a while I tracked down authentic Mexican tacos  thinking that American tacos are just silly and not so good  but Velvet taco changed my mind.  Fusion tacos are good  Favorites include chicken tikka masala  fish and chips and burger taco.
Velvet Taco,348,Based out of Dallas but finally here in austin  It is definitely flavorful and not your authentic taco. Great spin on different flavors. We got the chicken tikka taco which was fantastic. The blanco queso was also very good. I love their blue corn chips. Convenient and fun location. They offer outdoor seating with your pups.
Velvet Taco,349,I was so excited to try Velvet Taco  and I was let down.  I ordered the buffalo chicken taco and curry queso. The chicken in the taco was not crisp  the meat was very chewy and the entire taco was greasy. After two bites I got a bite of cartilage and gave up on finishing the taco.  I love curry and I love queso  but I did not like them together. For as exciting as the combo sounded the queso seemed really bland. The curry flavor tasted similar to Amy s frozen meals.  Sigh  sorry Velvet Taco not a win for me.
Velvet Taco,350,We came here craving tacos and that s exactly what we got  Delicious tacos served in a nice little taco carrier. I think I won the  I can eat the most  contest with that Red Curry Coconut Queso. Sweet baby jesus it was so freakin  good    They do not serve alcohol currently so go for the food as it is freshly prepared and yummy.  EDIT ALERT  They DO have alcohol to accompany your tacos  Check out the frozen margaritas and local craft beers 
Velvet Taco,351,I arrived at Velvet taco around noon on a weekday. There was quite a line to order  but it moved fairly quickly. You can browse through the menu while you wait in line. I played it safe with it being my first time  but they have a lot of unique tacos on the menu and the next time I go  I d like to try different options. I ended up ordering two rotisserie chicken tacos  which sounds plain  but they were anything but. Each taco came piled with pico and the chicken was mixed with queso blanco and topped with charred tomato salsa and corn. I could truly distinguish a lot of different flavors in each taco. You can eat inside or outside on their covered patio. The only downside to outside is that it was sometimes difficult to hear the name they were calling over their system. Looking forward to returning and trying different options.
Velvet Taco,352,Let me start with this  the food is great and fairly priced   3-6 for these large  tasty  creative tacos seems super reasonable   but the register service needs improvement. Andrew  the manager  is awesome  but I ll get back to that.  My husband and I are new to Austin and have never been to a Velvet Taco before  and since my parents were visiting  we decided to try it out. When we first walked in  there was a girl at the register. She didn t say anything to us  so we walked up and said  hi   and she responded   I can t take your thing  I don t have my number   and walked away. We wait a couple minutes before realizing that apparently  that particular register was closed  and people had started going around us to the other one. We eventually step up to the other register with a different associate who is taking phone orders  I m guessing this is just part of their standard operating procedures but it seemed odd that the only person taking orders in person was also handling all phone orders . She did not acknowledge us until she got off the phone  when she said  name   So we gave our last name.  Last initial   So we told her our first and last name.  What do you want   She proceeds to take our order while leaned over on one arm  seemingly very bored  not making any eye contact or engaging in any way. My mother has a meat allergy and was told  oh you can t really get anything here then.  Which was false. Luckily  Andrew delivered our food and told us to find him should we need anything. My mom spoke with him regarding her allergy and he had two specialty tacos created for her that she loved  for no charge. He made up for the entire experience  and we will definitely be back. I just hope the front line staff improves in professionalism  knowledge  and general niceness.
Velvet Taco,353,Awesome vibe  clean and friendly staff. Good food and different. Has both  outdoor sitting and indoor. Since they open very late  its a good spot to hangout after a drink or two friend friends Price for a taco can be a bit pricey though.  The spicey chicken tiki is amazing and the hibiscus tortilla is unique 
Velvet Taco,354,Came here last night and it was seriously amazeeeee. I got the bacon burger taco   nashville hot tofu taco and they were SOOOOO dank. Such incredible tacos. We also got the tots with the egg on it and some chips and queso and it was seriously all so delish. I know there s tons of taco places in Austin  most of which I love  but this one has totally different tacos that are worth trying. The only reason for star deduction was that the tofu taco was maddddd greasy  still delicious  but dripping oil . The design of the place itself is really neat too  super sleek and modern which I dig. For sure check it out if you re in the domain  _ 
Velvet Taco,355,Such a fun spot serving up some delicious  fast and fresh tacos    Located in The Domain  this casual spot is open super late serving hot tacos. They also offer margaritas. I had several tacos and all were fantastic  My favorite was the fish taco.   The red velvet cake is amazing     It comes with the best ever caramel sauce. It s really not needed with the already moist cake that s topped with perfectly sweet cream cheese  Not a fan of sweet icing  this was just sweet enough and complimented the cake perfectly . This was sooo good I went back to order several slices to take back home.   The atmosphere is super relaxed and laid back during the week. I went back on the weekend and it was super packed with all the young people returning from a night of partying with a few really drunk people. Besides that I enjoyed the cool outdoor patio  the complimentary sauces  the awesome Austin weather. Can t wait to go back 
Velvet Taco,356,I know this place has become really popular  but I find it a little overrated. I ve had the buffalo chicken taco  the cuban pig taco  the spicy chicken tikka taco  the falafel taco  and the fried paneer taco. It s more of a novelty taco place to me than a satisfying one. You can basically get an meal unrelated to a taco...in a tortilla. I find it to be more of that than a fusion restaurant  which confused and disappointed me. If you are looking for a traditional taco place  there are cheaper and better tasting options  this wouldn t be what you are looking for   and if you are looking for a fusion place  you could find more interesting places than here in my opinion. Of the ones I tried  I liked the falafel and cuban pig tacos best.   I will say the location is convenient for Domain frequenters  and the setup of the actual restaurant is nice. The food itself did not impress me  especially for the price it is sold at. There are tons of taco places I like better.
Velvet Taco,357,Open late.  Great variety of tacos    Quite a bit of seating for a small place.   Very busy every time I ve gone.   Not a quick in and out.    Will be back.
Velvet Taco,358,I do not get the hype   No one compares to Torchy s  though  -   I had 2 of the vegetarian tacos  The Nashville hot tofu and the Falafel...The tofu one was pretty good but really greasy and the falafel one was not very good at all - in taste and consistency.  My boyfriend had 2 chicken tacos  The Buffalo chicken and the Picnic chicken which he did not really care for.  The location and patio is top-notch but the food is just OK.
Velvet Taco,359,I was excited to try this new chain as an alternative to Torchy s  because while Torchy s is delish it can get tiring. My experience was pretty okay. Unfortunately  they got my order wrong by giving me two tacos I did not order and initially forgot my beer  which seemed kind of small   so that was a strike  though to be fair we were too hungry to return the tacos and they were decent anyway. Also  inside seating was very small  so we ended up having to sit outside in the Texas heat. Patio seating is nice  but considering the weather here is sweltering most of the year I think they should have invested in more indoor seating.  The tacos themselves were solid. I loved the variety of options and the unique flavor combinations. The queso was really unique and flavorful  but it was SO drippy that I ended up making a mess all over the table and some even dribbled onto my dress. The flavor was worth it though--red curry and coconut go surprisingly well with cheese  who knew --but unfortunately the tortilla chips were SO salted we could only eat about half of them.  Overall  I hope my next experience is a bit better  but it s a pretty good lunch spot if you re in the area. I loved the tacos. If they can tweak a few details and get my order right next time  I m sure they ll earn back a star.
Velvet Taco,360,Best tacos I ve ever had in my life  From the freshness to the the uniqueness I lived everything.   Decided to go with the flank steak taco and the shrimp and grits taco.  The warm tortilla shells were great on both which made eating that much better. The steak was cooked perfectly. The addition of portobello and queso was great  The shrimp and grits was different. I love shrimp and grits but wasn t sure about it on a taco. I m more than happy I went with it. Grits cooked and seasoned  perfectly and just enough shrimp to enjoy.   Definitely can t wait to try it again and would suggest anyone looking to try it out to give it a go 
Velvet Taco,361,I kept saying that Rock Rose was missing a taco shop  and then one appeared   Hooray     First of all - the curry queso.  It sounds weird  it is amazing.  While I liked the rest of my food it was the best thing I ate.  Nom. Nom. Nom.  They have some pretty creative tacos  so we each tried two.  I got the buffalo chicken and the rotisserie chicken with corn  my husband got a fish and chips taco and the cuban pig.  They were all pretty good but not KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF.  Solid  but it won t replace the Tacodeli fish taco off my list as my fave.    I do have to get back there because I really want to go down their full list and try them all.  I feel like I m going to find a winner there.  And because it s across the street from work.  And that queso.
Velvet Taco,362,Velvet Taco was so good that I actually came back the next day just to eat it again  I ordered the 3.5 picnic taco and it was just unreal. The flavor was incredible. But what really swept me off of my feet was the elote  It was SO good. And even better when you eat it with chips   Overall I would say that Velvet Taco is very reasonably priced  especially when you compare it to everywhere else in Austin . And if you re feeling a little wild you should absolutely take home a piece of their red velvet cake 
Velvet Taco,363,Not a fan following the reasons  1. Music was so loud that it was difficult to have a conversation. 2. Outside patio had ample seating but no fans  so it got hot. 3. Pricey--two tacos for  8 with no sides. 4. They served tacos in metal taco stands  but the juice from them drips out. 5. Three bathrooms  all unisex.
Velvet Taco,364,Omgosh Omgosh  order the elotes Grilled Corn   and Shrimp and Grits tacos  Yay   Their bathrooms are gender neutral. All the tacos are good  Make sure to add sauce.
Velvet Taco,365,I really wanted to dislike this place  but it was just too darn cool. My first thought was why bring another taco franchise to Austin  but my second thought was this Velvet Taco is pretty perfect for Rock Rose.  And if you ve never been to a Torchy s or Tacodeli before  you might think these guys invented the hipster taco. But if you re a native Austinite - which means you ve lived here over a month now - there s really nothing on the menu that ll surprise you. Okay  maybe the red velvet cake  which I didn t try. But they also have booze  they re open until midnight  and when they finish the patio  it s going to be that much cooler.   Just to order something  I got the all-day bacon  amp  egg thing and a vegetarian  Nashville Hot Tofu.  For a total of  7.85 it wasn t bad at all  if maybe a little short of being really good - if the tofu had been less spicy  it could actually have been more tasty. And remember  there are just under a zillion other places in Austin for tacos too. But if you re casually strolling the Domain in beautiful weather  and besieged by a sudden walking taco urge or whatever  it can be real easy to slip in here and become a fan o  Velvet. Yep  the Domain just gets bigger  amp  better.
Velvet Taco,366,I have to admit  I really didn t want to like this place. I was already a hater before I even walked in. In a city full of tacos  why would we need another taco place  The answer is simple. You can NEVER have enough tacos   On a recent visit back to Austin  my cousin wanted tacos  and I kid you not  I ate at Torchy s  Taco Deli  and Velvet Taco all in the same damn week  I was skeptical about this place  but after giving it a shot I can say that I was wrong.  On this visit  I had two others with me and we each ordered two tacos each so a variety of six tacos.   -Rotisserie chicken  pretty tasty with the queso and the corn pico. -Spicy Tikka chicken  I didn t get to try this as I gave up fried food for lent but the others said it was delicious and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. -Texas Akaushi bacon burger  surprisingly really good  Patty was perfectly cooked and the bacon had a great crunch and the sauce pulled it all together. -Slow roasted angus brisket  Delicious  Love the layer of grilled cheese on the outside of the taco  -Ahi poke  Also surprisingly good and different and loved that it was wrapped in lettuce.  -Fish n chips  I also didn t get to try this one but heard it was great.   It s hard to compare this to the many taco joints in Austin  but I would say it s the most similar to Torchy s. Would I go back  Definitely  Don t be a hater like me and give it a try 
Velvet Taco,367,Decent spot to to come to for tacos  you can definitely get better tacos but this a decent spot. First time here and wasn t blown away but it wasn t that bad.  Price point is a little high for tacos but they do make some pretty interesting combinations  I got the falafel taco  and two different chicken ones  one was tikka masala . The wife got the poke one and the fried tofu taco.  The falafel taco was a disappointment to be honest  the falafel was eh and overall wouldn t get it again  the two chicken ones were really good I would definitely get those again very flavorful and the chicken was moist.  The wife said the poke was good and definitely worth getting the tofu one was just too greasy for her and I could see the grease drip out of it so probably would have to pass on that one. Location is nice since it s in the Domain  plenty of seating  nice chill place to be at.    Overall decent would I come back sure if I am around and not willing to go to another spot. Are there better taco spots out there  Definitely  I would not come here with the anticipation of being blown away but it s not terrible either.
Velvet Taco,368,What a wonderful new place to visit Free parking Clean and happy employees Omg good  Cheap I had the corn which is a side dish  s p I c y but good I had the number two taco  OMG  please sneak me in a few times a week to have another Group of 12 of us  music was too loud hard to talk  but the tacos are sooo good you almost forgive theme One gal pal ordered tater tots and   sweet  it comes with an EGG on top  Scramble me up and bring me back    
Velvet Taco,369,Food is always good  the WTF chicharron Taco is the Best one yet   Hopefully it will be placed on daily menu
Velvet Taco,370,While I was in Austin my friends were raving about this place. So after a night out of drinking this place was the next stop. Crowds filled this place on a Friday night after the surrounding bars closed.   This isn t your average taco spot. They make things a little more...interesting. I had the Fried Paneer tofu taco. The flavors were really mixed well and it had a nice kick to it.  Don t come here if you re expecting regular tacos  only come here if you re looking for a  spin  on a taco. I enjoyed it
Velvet Taco,371,Hands down my favorite place to get tacos in Austin  Service is great and the food is even better. Very cool atmosphere too. I love introducing friends and family to this place.
Velvet Taco,372,If you are looking for tacos ... this is the place. tasty and flavorful down to the very last bite  Service was excellent not to mention the energy was so inviting. My husband made it a point to thank the manager  mike  for such a great experience and although he was clearly very busy  he took the time to chat a bit with us even convincing us to try their signature velvet cake. if mikes manager sees this post please acknowledge what a great job he does  The cake was mouth watering   this place is definitely a HIT  If your in the area you must try           A      
Velvet Taco,373,This place is amazing  Torchys tacos vibes with the late night  3am   vibe    Perfect location as you leave the bar and wall across to grab a late night munchie meal.  A lot of drunk people   but if you re not too drunk  its entertaining to watch Lots of police so security has this place on lock . Safe and taste good.   Hands up 
Velvet Taco,374,Really interesting tacos  think Indian Japanese Thai flavours  not tex mex  in an extremely fast paced environment- no matter how efficient  be prepared to wait after a late night- and some fantastic service. As in  they make a mistake  you tell them  they give you what you asked for in a minute. Fried paneer  fish n chips on flour  rotisserie chicken  flank steak on corn were all delicious and unique. Get a cup of elote and another one to go- it s like crack
Velvet Taco,375,We ordered the fried egg with tots  spicy tikka chicken taco  and red velvet cake - one word to describe them would be  flavorful . The tots were crispy and complemented the cheese bits  bacon  runny yoke from the egg  and their sauce. I personally thought the flavor was a little too overwhelming after a few bites  but a great side to share nonetheless    Spicy tikka chicken had a good spicy kick with about 3 chicken slices with rice inside the taco. Red velvet cake was amazing. Super MOIST and not too sweet and a great dessert or snack if you choose to just stop by and grab.   The environment has a great vibe and open kitchen where you can view fresh tacos being made. We didn t have to wait long when we went during Sunday lunch. The staff there were all friendly 
Velvet Taco,376,My boyfriend and I ended up at Velvet Taco on the Friday night of Memorial Day weekend. It is a super cute place. They have about a dozen different tacos on the menu  a few sides  and red velvet cake. Sounds super odd but it really works. We shared the Red Curry Coconut Queso. It was great. Very strong coconut and red curry flavors which is not something you re expecting in queso. I went with the Texas Akaushi bacon burger taco and the Annatto shredded pork taco. All the flavors were great. The boyfriend went with the Annatto shredded pork taco and the Picnic Chicken taco. We got a piece of the red velvet cake to go because I knew I d be too full to eat it with the meal. I ended up eating it the next day. Can I just tell you the tacos were good but forget it  Go for the cake  It s moist and delicious. Not usually a red velvet fan but this was beyond. Don t miss it 
Velvet Taco,377,Woww Best Fusion Tacos ever eaten Tasted great Spicy chicken taxo Buffalo taco n tots We liekd the concept of their dining and the interiors Very customer friendly and fast service  Best thing is its open late until midnight
Velvet Taco,378,I m doing a complete 180 not only for the great customer service  but for the taste of the tacos I received.  I was offered a free meal to try this place out again .   12 Slow roasted angus brisket. This might be the best taco I ve ever had. I m going to say that it is  and this taco alone deserves 5 stars.  Encrusted tortilla  means a tortilla with cheese baked on it  Like Jersey Mike s Cheddar Rosemary Bread . All of the ingredients blended together into something amazing. Queso is very polarizing for me  but the queso on this taco was delicious. Absolutely fantastic.  I also got the nashville hot chicken taco of the month  which is the chicken version of  4  which I think is something you can do any day of the year . The chicken was flavorful and well I didn t find it spicy at all  that s just me  I ve had carolina reaper peppers  THAT is spicy  . Without the ranch sauce  this taco was solid. I d give this taco a 4 5.  They have craft sodas  which are always a plus for me. The mango soda was fantastic and tasted much better than it did when it was new  not sure why  but the mango soda didn t stand out when this place opened . Portions are small for the price is the only downside. That and the dry shredded pork from my first review.   I m glad I gave this place another shot.
Velvet Taco,379,Fairly new restaurant on Rock Rose  So I gave it a try with my boyfriend for a weekend dinner.  You order food at the front  and the worker will call up your name when your food is ready. Utensils and drinks are self-serve. Food came out pretty quickly. I think it took about 5 minutes.  We ordered chips and queso for an appetizer. I can tell the chips were freshly made  and they were not oily at all. Queso was super good  As of tacos  I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken and the Grilled Flank Steak. The grilled flank steak was pretty good  but I wished they put more cilantro in it. I didn t like the rotisserie chicken at all. Whatever went in that taco did not make a good combination. My boyfriend ordered the Spicy Tikka Chicken which was absolutely amazing  I really loved the sauce.  One thing I like about this restaurant is the bathroom. The layout is quite unique. There are six unisex bathrooms  and a large sink that everyone uses outside of those bathrooms.  All in all  it was a 4 stars experience. Some improvement is needed in the food  ex. Rotisserie Chicken . But other than that  this is a pretty nice casual place to eat 
Velvet Taco,380,Very elegant presented tacos. Clean presentation but also tasty  A great take on making tacos more hip. I will definitely return to try more things on the menu.
Velvet Taco,381,Definitely not your average taco joint. The menu has a variety of everything-but-traditional tacos  so if fusion is not your thing you may want to skip. They are a little heavy handed on the spices  which is why I only gave 3 stars. I had the red curry spiced queso  which in my opinion tasted like they added raw curry powder to it  so it had a harsh flavor  but still decent. I LOVE spice by the way  I really enjoyed the Indian inspired taco I had  the fish taco and the red velvet cake. It is amazing  Ooey-gooey  sweet  decadent and satisfying   They serve beer  so great way to slam some cheap beers before checking out the rest of the domain.
Velvet Taco,382,The ratings for this restaurant are deceiving. We came here late at night with the assumption that these tacos were going to be good due to the high ratings. To our disappointment  these tacos were not our cup of tea. We probably ordered 10 tacos in total and we probably only ate 3. The tacos were dry and it was just not good. I was going to give it 1 star but the tots were decent. If I was to go back  which I won t be   I would probably just get the tots with the egg. I would not recommend this place if you re looking for good tacos.
Velvet Taco,383,I ll just say it right out  after the first time I went here I couldn t stop thinking about it. This makes a regular appearance in my sleeping and waking thoughts. And anytime I frequent the domain I ll make a quick stop in.  Our group tried 9 different tacos and here s the consensus  SO YUMMY  But don t order the pork or beef ones - they are surprisingly super bland. We  Loved so much the tikka chicken  picnic chicken  waffle chicken  monte Cristo  buffalo chicken is good if you re into that flavor  I m not  but the rest of my group was.
Velvet Taco,384,Probably my favorite tacos in Austin.  They re not your typical taqueria style tacos. Velvet Tacos reminds me of Torchy s a little bit - it s specialty and experimental tacos. Velvet Tacos seems to use higher quality ingredients and the food just tastes better overall though.
Velvet Taco,385,I really love this place. It s Mexican tacos with an American   Caribbean twist. I enjoyed the Cuban taco and the rotisserie chicken taco. The ingredients were fresh and over all the tacos were flavorful 
Velvet Taco,386,So I ve written about this place before but I had to reiterate how great of an experience it is to eat here. The tacos were served to me like a work of art and the queso was OUTSTANDING. I ve had velvet before in Houston  but there s something special about this location. Keep rocking it y all....
Velvet Taco,387,We had a late lunch here on a Friday and loved it  Service was great and everyone was friendly. This may be one of my new favorite spots to eat on Rock Rose. I was pleasantly surprised by how amazingly delicious the tacos were - so fresh and flavorful  I thought all of the tacos were unique and they clearly make everything in house. The blue corn tortilla chips were delicious  as well as all the tortillas for the tacos. We loved every single taco we ordered especially the rotisserie chicken and my husband loved the chicken and waffles taco. The tacos were made so perfectly and I think the display on the trays is so great to keep them from getting super messy. These may just be our favorite tacos in Austin 
Velvet Taco,388,What a cute and creative taco concept  I was just shopping at the domain during the last day of my business trip and discovered this super cool  kinda fast casual taco spot. The menu was challenging because the tacos are so unique and they all sound good. I ultimately ordered the shrimp and grits taco  paneer taco  and the buffalo chicken. The shrimp and grits won 1st place and I wish it could have been a full meal  The others were okay but  I would try new options if I get the chance to return.  They let me sample their margarita and it was the perfect addition to top off the meal. The staff are very pleasant and helpful so ask for their advice if its your first time. Hopefully I ll find another velvet taco one day soon 
Velvet Taco,389,LOVE LOVE LOVE.  This place is a fancier version of Torchys Tacos. The margaritas are strong so watch out    The queso is delish  amp  remember you can ask for more chips because the ratio of chips to queso is off. I personally enjoy the Rotisserie chicken tacos but I get a flour tortilla instead of corn. Great place. Great atmosphere. Great Taste. Highly recommend
Velvet Taco,390,Came here for dinner on Saturday night and there wasn t much of a line at 8 thankfully  I got the chicken tikka taco  which I ve heard people rave about. It took us 30 minutes to get our food  and we were getting pretty impatient. But the food was definitely worth the wait. The flavors of my taco were amazing  I definitely recommend it for newcomers to velvet taco. I didn t get to try it this time but I ve heard the red velvet cake is amazing as well  I will be back to try this for dessert next time.
Velvet Taco,391,Great late night snack after you are drinking at the bars in the Domain. I like the rotisserie chicken taco the best. They are normally fast and open late. Coconut queso is very interesting too. I recommend.
Velvet Taco,392,First time eating here at Velvet Taco. Michael greeted us at the register and offered suggestions and personal favorites of his from the menu.  We ordered 4 tacos.. spicy tikka chicken  picnic chicken  and two slow roasted angus tacos. We also ordered a side of Elote  think Mexican street corn . We mentioned wanting to try their red curry coconut queso and crisp tots with an egg on top  but figured it may be too much food.   Well  Michael went above and beyond to make our first visit absolutely fantastic. When he brought out our food  he also showed up with the queso AND the tots with the fried egg    When I say my inner fat kid was screaming from the sheer excitement of getting to try all of these amazing things  I am 1000  serious lol  Y all... Every. Single. Thing we ate was better than amazing  The tikka chicken taco was pretty spicy and full of flavor  picnic chicken taco sooo freaking good  angus tacos were perfectly cooked  and the sides of corn  tots  and queso were wayyyyy better than we anticipated.   But  that s not all..... when we were about halfway through with our meal our new friend Michael came by the table and set down a large slice of red velvet cake. He then explained that they serve it drizzled with cajeta  which I LOVE . This cake  with the cajeta  was the cherry on top of our visit.   We literally have zero complaints from our visit and we both agreed that we ve never experienced such an amazing amount of customer service before      if you ve ever been to a chick-fil-a that s saying a lot  because they re known for their value of customer service .   We thank Michael and the staff at Velvet Taco for our fantastic friendly experience. We left full and happy after eating amazing food. If you are ever in the area I highly recommend trying this place out 
Velvet Taco,393,I enjoyed the variety and the speed. Don t go here for mexican food. Go here for tacos of weird origins. I ve now been there twice and only moved to Austin a month ago  because it was just worth trying again. It s the type of place where everyone will find something they want to try. I could probably eat 5 of the tacos  but that would be a  25 meal   . The rotating taco creation is cool. I don t remember if there is a make your own option  but if not I think that would be a cool thing. Maybe just to bring back old rotating options when you have a craving 
Velvet Taco,394,Can t go wrong with this spot. Stumble upon this gem after a late night of bar hopping and have been going back ever since.
Velvet Taco,395,The food was great and the service was even better  It was my first time visiting here and Analicia the cashier was super helpful and put me on some good food  Def coming back
Velvet Taco,396,I just wanted to thank Analicia for taking my order she was very helpful because I am a bit picky on my order of tacos but she was so patient with me and by the way I love her attitude. I will be back.
Velvet Taco,397,I live across the street.   It was not Taco Tuesday  however  if anyone tells you that you need to wait for Taco Tuesday - dissassociate with them. You don t need that kind of negativity in your life.  On a sunny day it s fantastic to sit outside and people watch as you eat uncommon varieties of tacos. The tacos for the most part are very good. Especially if you are rich. Why  Because the price is substantially higher than traditional places.   Their tots were good  their elote was precut  because you know  the cob can be considered a lethal weapon   the cake was okay and we tried more than half the menu.   Are you hungry  rich  or drunk  and want tacos  This is the place for you.
Velvet Taco,398,Insane variety of specialty tacos. Meat  seafood  even...vegan.     tikka masala  fried chicken  spices  and rice make such a good taco - always my top choice  little bit of a kick with this one though   grilled flank steak  pretty good since i love steak but not crazy about big pieces of mushroom   cuban pulled pork  when i want to indulge  juicy  amp  flavorful   they got a cool open hand washing situation set up so you don t have to touch anything before you get back to your table to eat  which a germaphobe like me truly appreciates   they have additional sauces if you re interested   staff is so nice and makes me miss people in austin  - wait will be longer as they are specialty tacos so plan ahead
Velvet Taco,399,Pretty yummy tacos   We ate the angus beef  FAV   Cuban pig  rotisserie chicken and tikki Marsala which all were pretty yummy  Go try it 
Velvet Taco,400,This place was so delicious  Definitely going back  The variety and combinations they offer are so good  Exceeded my expectations  
Velvet Taco,401,10 10 would recommend. I got the shrimp and grits taco which was delicious and the elotes is to die for  Also red velvet cake just completes the meal  and the sauce on top is amazing. The outdoor patio is nice an covered  overall one of the best places to eat at the domain 
Velvet Taco,402,Hallelujah Velvet Taco is in Austin    I ve been to the Houston location a handful of times and had always wished it would make it s way to Austin and now it s finally here  Once you ve had a few tacos here  or really just one  you ll see why I was so happy.   One of the things that I like about this place  besides its fantastic tacos  is the grungy decor that matches the mood- what you don t like to be grungy when you eat tacos  Come on  embrace that teenage angst  What I also appreciate is how clean it is. It s definitely better lit  and better kept than the Houston location. Only con  the design team set-up in the front causes a lot of bottle-necking when you first walk in.   My family and I came in on a Friday night around 8PM and found it fairly empty. Not sure if that s the way it normally is  considering how popular it seems to already be  or if it was just an off night.   The people working there are incredibly friendly and even kept their patience with a few customers ahead of us who asked a bunch of questions. It seems as though they have a few too many workers though  considering quite a few of the staff seemed to be standing around. But that certainly didn t effect the experience  so not really a complaint  just an observation.  I ordered the fish and chips taco  tikka masala  and my family ordered the loaded tater tots to share. One of the things that will stick out to you the most on this menu is just how creative everything is. This is not your typical taco place and any taco you get here you will probably not find anywhere else. My personal favorite is the tikka masala because it has just the right amount of spice and the rice is a really nice touch. The fish and chips probably comes up right after that considering how great the chips tasted with the rest of the taco. The tater tots were great too  but it was probably a little too much for me.   With such a creative menu  you ve got lots of options to choose from  and enough to come back and try the rest- although I probably enjoy my favorites a little too much to deviate.
Velvet Taco,403,Velvet Tacos is really great. I will say the seating can be difficult because they are always busy when we stop in. I always get the Buffalo Chicken Taco  amp  a Chicken and Waffles Taco  my favorite . I also really like the red curry queso.
Velvet Taco,404,If you live in North Austin and don t eat at the Velvet Taco  then f  k you.   I wish I wasn t just here for work. If I lived in Austin  I would be here all the time  trying every taco. I had the Slow Roasted Angus Brisket and the Spicy Chicken Tikka. Each was INCREDIBLE. I m glad I asked the cashier about the brisket taco  she said it was her favorite and she obviously has amazing taste. First of all  the meat was flavorful and the perfect  fall apart  tender deliciousness you would hope for. The toppings  avocado  corn  micro cilantro  pico were fresh and flavorful. Whatever the sauce was  uhhhh YES. Good amount of kick in this taco  but not to the point of being distracting. The tortilla with the encrusted cheese.... DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. GET THIS TACO.   The chicken tikka was also incredible  but after eating the encrusted tortilla of the brisket taco and experiencing all its flavorful incredibleness  it does kind of pale in comparison. The tikka sauce was delicious and a tad spicy. Definitely an authentic flavor and something I really enjoyed in the taco form.   Not only is the food incredible  but the staff is super cool. If you haven t eaten here yet  do yourself a favor  and get your a   over here.   Stepping off my soapbox now.  But really  you should eat here  
Velvet Taco,405,Shout out to Sergio and Andrew for the amazing customer service  Shout out to the chef for the best tacos on the planet 
Velvet Taco,406,3.5 stars  At first I thought their name references the Austin velvet rut or something more suggestive but it s actually because they serve velvet cake. I didn t try the velvet cake but a friend who bakes as a hobby says it s just alright.  I literally only had their tikka marsala tacos and returned to order it day after day for a phase. It s so satisfying  filling and some might say spicy. The chicken is breaded so it s more of a breaded tikka marsala.  Their house hot sauce is pretty good but I wish they had various levels although Torchy s doesn t...I don t understand it but whatever. They all have just one universal hot sauce. You either can t handle it  can handle it  or want more to handle. It s very similar to Valentina but more dark red in color and maybe a bit more spicy than Valentina but it has that very basic vinegary palate that dominates the heat.  The grits in their shrimp and grits tacos is also more of a fried texture and not like softer grits texture most are accustomed to.   They have frozen margaritas which are on point.   They re not better than Torchy s imo but similar   close enough to be in the same league.
Velvet Taco,407,Really good tacos    Grilled Salmon  spicy chicken and fish  amp  chips are delicious... Veggie tacos are ok... We have tried the Paneer and falafel... Overall one of my favorite places for tacos...
Velvet Taco,408,I usually don t do fusion tacos but was pleasantly surprised  for the most part. We ordered   Red curry coconut queso. It was way too runny and there were chunks of cheese in it. Did we get a bad order  I dunno  but if we didn t  definitely pass on it.  21. Barbacoa brisket frittata. This was a miss  in my opinion. I didn t like the barbacoa at all--not a whole lot of taste. The frittata was used for the shell. Interesting concept.  7. Cuban pig. Pulled pork  ham  AND bacon    How can you go wrong with that   5. Fried paneer. Decent vegetarian option  I was pretty ambivalent towards it.  17. Ahi poke. I liked it but my wife didn t. Tasted like a standard ahi poke bowl without the rice.  11. Grilled flank steak. This was my favorite. The portobello was a perfect complement.  2. Rotisserie chicken. Going in  I didn t think I d like it but it was surprisingly good. Chicken was juicy and tender.
Velvet Taco,409,DELICIOUS  YUMMY  CREATIVE    I ordered 2 tacos  falafel  amp  tikka chicken. Throughly enjoyed the tikka chicken but not so much the falafel. The overall taco was good but the falafel itself needs help. We also had the tots which I recommend to anyone. It s SUPER yummy  Margaritas were also good   Love when you can get good food  amp  a bomb margarita without totally breaking the bank.  A moderate amount of seating inside. I wish the patio was open when we visited. Would ve been nice. Hopefully they open it up soon.
Velvet Taco,410,Velvet Taco is literally one of my favorite places in Dallas. And when I saw that there was a Velvet Taco in my friends neighborhood. It was a must stop during my visit to Austin. Like it was non-negotiable   Thankfully Velvet Taco is open late on Saturdays because we definitely were hungry after a late night out. My favorite is the corn. Omg     Literally amazing  it s elote corn and seriously I could eat just that all the time. It is so flavorful. And for being so late  I was surprised it wasn t crazy busy. Which was ok for me because I was hungry.   We got the tots  corn  rotisserie chicken Taco  spicy tikka chicken  and the falafel tacos. Sooooo good. I really enjoy Velvet Tacos with each bite. It s seriously my favorite. And seriously  I think I love it so much because of the corn. But honestly  I ve never been disappointed in anything I ve gotten here. So it s definitely a must try  I would recommend Velvet Tacos to anyone. Can you please open up a location in Denver  I mean it would be dangerous but I would eat here pretty often.
Velvet Taco,411,LOVED this spot. Went to the one in Chicago and absolutely loved it  so obviously had to try it in ATX    We get the chicken tikka tacos but sub the chicken for the paneer bits since I m vegetarian. Literally incredible. Everything tastes fresh and so flavorful.  A must try is the corn    It s really flavorful and crunchy. We also got the queso and chips - very tasty as well.   This place is a must try if you come to austin. There are lots of options available and not that expensive either       absolutely loved it.
Velvet Taco,412,Tacos were decent. Chips and queso were the highlight of the meal. It s not Torchy s...know that going in. I wanted to like it  but it didn t impress me and the service wasn t the best. The entire staff was busy in conversations with one another. Wouldn t return. Just not for me.
Velvet Taco,413,Man this place is late night NECTAR of tha GODS   Chicken and waffles taco...served in a waffle tortilla    Are you kidding me    Soooo good   This place has good  quality ingredients and the service is pretty fast.  It isn t cheap but the food is good.  I will definitely be back 
Velvet Taco,414,Last stop  Velvet Tacos. Nothing better than a spicy tikka chicken or a fish n  chips taco after a night of drinking in the Domain. The shop has seating indoors and outdoors  all with a comfortable view for drunk people to people watch other drunk people stumble in and out.
Velvet Taco,415,Velvet Taco better than Torchy s     Can t believe I said that   I feel kinda guilty.  Cuter  seems a bit more  authentic original   more efficient line  taco production  menu organization and taco readiness.  Good tacos.  Will return   Oh - and a hand washing trough 
Velvet Taco,416,I went to Velvet Taco twice during my 4 day stay in Austin. Loved it   Both the times  I got all 3 veg taco varieties. Hygiene  decor  wait time and staff- all very good. You can order online during busy hours when the line is long. I recommend this place.
Velvet Taco,417,Omfg yes all day long strong cant go wrong food for dong  Great food made by MegaKarenz
Velvet Taco,418,So glad Velvet Taco has come to Austin  Not only are the tacos cheap  they are filling. One taco plus an order of the elotes fills me up the right amount. While I really like the fried paneer taco and the spicy tikka chicken taco  I am in love with the fried green tomato taco that they served for a limited time. My only complaint is that I wish they had a larger variety of sauces but that s me being picky. Cheap tacos  great side items and fast service sums up this place. Do check it out 
Velvet Taco,419,I got the Falafel and the Fried Paneer Taco... Overall  the tacos tasted pretty good  If you are looking for a twist on the traditional Texan Tacos this is your place. But if you are looking for a TexMex tacos I would recommend an actual TexMex Food Truck.  The Falafel Taco was the better of the two perfectly cooked and blended well with the sauces The Fried Paneer Taco was a little off since the crema sauce overpowered the taco.   I would definitely go again for a quick bite though
Velvet Taco,420,First time and loved it. Service was 100  I ordered a taco that I didn t care for and without question it was replaced. Try the red velvet cake  it was phenomenally good.
Velvet Taco,421,The interior looks great. The kitchen is open so you can see the folks making your taco.   Tried the chicken tikka taco. It s a little spicy. Not much to it. Some rice and a fried chicken tender with tikka masala sauce. It was ok.   Pass on the margarita. It s too sweet and not boozy enough. They have a few beers on draft.   If only this place was more of a bar. It would be nice hang out place. The patio would be a great spot to sip some beers.   Not really impressed with the one taco I tried. It s more of a eat quickly and leave type of spot.
Velvet Taco,422,I can t believe that I ve never tried Velvet Taco considering how much time I spend at the Domain. I got the rotisserie chicken taco and it was delicious   Wish I could ve tried more  but was in a hurry. They do have a gluten free menu  which is always a plus for me. Cute and good atmosphere  There are fans on the patio for those hot Austin days. Will be back 
Velvet Taco,423,Wow  the food is amazing. It is always worth the wait if the line is long. This is a weekly meal for me.
Velvet Taco,424,Disappointed with the food and service.  Food was soggy and over spiced compared to other locations.   Dining area was dirty and messy needed to be clean. Not  my favorite Velvet Taco experience.
Velvet Taco,425,Um  I have high standards for my tacos and I m not going to lie  this place well exceeded them. We got a nice mix   12  cheese melted into the tortilla  yes please     6  and  3. Now  I have lived in the Middle East so I know what good falafel is and let me tell you  so does Velvet Taco. So much nom.  3   delicious. But  12 was heavenly. The queso is creamy with a kick and exactly what it should be. And craft sodas are the perfect pairing. In conclusion  Yes Yes Yes
Velvet Taco,426,Best tacos ever  We were searching for some bomb tacos and found them at Velvet Taco Austin  We went back every day while we were in The Domain area. Reasonable price for the tacos as they are all loaded with pure goodness. A couple friends met us and we got them addicted as well. They have so many different varieties  not just mexican style street tacos  which was a plus.  My favorites were the fish and chips  spicy tikka chicken  and the burger tacos  They are all individually crafted on the spot and you can remove items to make the perfect taco.  We tried all of them except the veggie options and even tried their breakfast selection. Not a bad thing to say about any of them   The option to order draft beer with them made the experience even better  Wish they had a franchise in the Boston area as we are lacking in the street taco department.
Velvet Taco,427,I m not the first to say this place lives up to the hype.  They have delicious  creative concepts for tacos  and I ve never tried one I didn t like. The fish and chips taco  for example  sounds pretty weird  but they did it right.  No matter which taco you get  you have to get the queso. It s as unique as everything else at Velvet but it s probably my favorite queso in Texas.
Velvet Taco,428,I love the selection and creativity of the menu items  so hard to choose. I ve never had a bad taco from here I highly suggest the buffalo cauliflower. I also have a picnic table one which was good. Wish I could try all the menu items  this place always seems to be busy.
Velvet Taco,429,This was my first time in Austin and we were looking for some good tacos that weren t in the crowded downtown area. Velvet Taco is in a cute shopping area called the domain filled with bars  shopping  gyms  and other restaurants.   When you walk into Velvet Taco  you are able to look at menus while waiting in line to order. They have a good variety from chicken to pork to breakfast. They also serve sides like elote and a version of loaded tots  I did not get the tots but they looked amazing . You also have the option of drinks right before you reach the counter  which range from margaritas to beers to cream sodas.   I got the rotisserie chicken taco   2  and a side of elote. They were both excellent and were made very quickly. The taco had this salsa in it which was excellent. The elote was way spicier than I had expected but still really good.   Overall  Velvet Taco was great  I would definitely come back to try some of the other tacos and sides  and margaritas  
Velvet Taco,430,I got the chicken and waffles and it was delicious. It was put together well and not made all sloppy like. The chicken and waffle taco definitely exceeded my expectations. This place has reasonable prices as well.
Velvet Taco,431,Best tacos I have ever had  We ordered the Cuban pig  Annatto shredded pork  Kobe bacon burger  grilled salmon and Ahi poke  my personal favorite  all delicious  fresh and did I mention delicious  This place is awesome and the food is deliciously incredible  Do yourself a favor and  visit this restaurant  I had the pleasure of visiting the one in Dallas and the one in Austin  So  what are you waiting for  Get here and order some delicious tacos   you are not going to regret it  
Velvet Taco,432,Delicious fish taco alert  Uniquely well done in my experience. Deep fried golden filet with fresh greens and a tangy mustard sauce. A bit pricey but certainly worth revisiting. When dining in the Domain that tends to be a given.   The most interesting surprise here was the curry queso with pickled onions and fresh basil leaves. The flavor defies any simple description but it does have a moderate bit of heat that takes a minute to creep up.   Also worth mentioning is the hygiene station. They have an alcove with two unisex restrooms facing each other from opposite sides of the room. Between them stands an industrial style vanity with six separate hand washing sinks. Each sink has a mirror above it with its own soap dispenser. Thus multiple people can wash up without having to occupy a restroom. Never seen this elsewhere but it s a brilliant concept.   The menu holds a curious variety of intriguing options so I m predicting future visits with other fellow taco-fetishists.
Velvet Taco,433,This place gives me life.Thankful they stay open late. Put this on your bucket list. Food is creatively satisfying. I missed out on the margarita but it looked delicious and put my husband to sleep  so I hope that s a sign the alcohol content isn t weak  Can t wait to go back.
Velvet Taco,434,This place was amazing  I had never been to Velvet Taco  but I had heard so much about it. The place is aesthetically  pleasing and huge  There is indoor and outdoor seating  so we didn t have to wait at all. The spicy tikka chicken taco was my favorite. It has white rice so it s kind of like eating spicy butter chicken with rice in a roti  I didn t think it was all that spicy but I still enjoyed it  The beef brisket taco was good as well  I wasn t crazy about it but I still enjoyed it. THEY HAVE MEXICAN COKE PEOPLE. I definitely guzzled that down the second they opened it for me. The tater tots were meh  very standard I wouldn t get them again. The seating was really cute outside but they only gripe I have is that there are birds EVERYWHERE. They fly super close to your food and are constantly picking up the food on the floor. It s a little gross and unappetizing  I m only a fan of birds in the sky or on my plate  not flying around my head like vultures. If you have a Velvet Taco near you  check them out 
Velvet Taco,435,This place has become one of my favorite places to go. They may not be traditional Tex Mex tacos  but they are very unique. The Chicken Tikka and Korean Pork are my current favorite. The frozen margarita is also really good 
Velvet Taco,436,Being from the DFW area  I was super excited that Velvet Taco was finally expanding to the Austin area. That being said  I only wished the food lived up to the hype. I ordered the 3 most popular tacos  rotisserie chicken  bbq brisket  and chicken tikka masala   and was mildly disappointed. For the price  I expected slightly more in terms of portion and flavor. Each taco was average to me  but the chicken tikka masala was the most interesting. The fusion of the Indian flavors in a taco actually worked quite well. Adding some of the bbq they had on the other two tacos made it taste a little better. I was really disappointed with the sides of tots though. I wished they were more crispy  and had some more sauce on it. The egg was a nice touch  but it didn t really add anything to the flavor.   Great environment as expected for the hipster taco joint  I would mind coming back to grab a bite to eat after a night of drinking.
Velvet Taco,437,Great place for a quick bite. The staff is super nice and there is outdoor seating. The tacos don t knock your socks off by any means but they get the job done and also are a decent portion. The margaritas are tasty but they only offer frozen  so be prepared. Beer is also available
Velvet Taco,438,Very creative approach to Austin s favorite food.  We came for a Saturday brunch at around noon and the restaurant was busy  but not packed.  Usually  I would avoid Domain at all costs  but I was truly curious about this place and was not disappointed.   I had a brisket taco and a Monte Cristo from the breakfast menu.  Both were excellent with unexpected flavor combinations and beautiful presentation. Monte Cristo was especially impressive with cheese  ham  honey  jam  and fresh strawberries in it. The brisket taco shell was  infused  with melted cheese. Something I have not seen before.  Typically I am a big fan of adding salsas to my tacos  but Velvet tacos do not need any sauces. They are perfect the way they are created and it seemed like salsas would only distract from this balanced and tasty experience.   The only not-so-perfect thing was a coffee situation. They only had one relatively small pot which got empty right when I was going to fill my cup. It took good 20 minutes to make more.  They also offer several brunchy drinks like mimosas and beers. They have an outside seating overlooking Rock Rose street.  I plan to come back and try some other flavors as it was really hard to choose just two. Pretty much anything on the menu sounds delicious. And it probably is...   
Velvet Taco,439,This place was very quick and convenient to us as business travelers but also to what seemed to be lots of business folks in the area.  I ordered the special for the day which was a curry chicken with greens and white sauce.  It was good going down  but I quickly had food poisoning and it came back up.  Kinda ruined my first day in Austin for work.  However  i can see under better circumstances  this would be a decent place for a work lunch.
Velvet Taco,440,I randomly ran into this taco place with my friends . After seeing the menu I was excited to give this place a try . The chicken and waffle taco is to die for no games . I also have a burger taco which was also great . Service was amazing . New favorite spot
Velvet Taco,441,2 stars for the ahi tuna poke tacos.   The tuna is not fresh. It was defrosted and still wet from the ice melting. It was barely flavored.  The wad of salty kelp at the bottom was fine but still oozing liquid which was both overpowering and messy.   The lettuce was nice and crispy but again  not dry and slightly damp.  The sliced jalape os were a nice touch.  The ahi tuna tacos were not fresh  very wet  and lacked flavor.  HIGHLY suggest they start marinating the ahi tuna.   Also I need to stop getting sushi grade fish outside of California.
Velvet Taco,442,I got all three veggie tacos. The Nashville hot tofu tacos were the best in my opinion. The spice rub was really spicy and pretty delicious  Wasn t as blown away with the falafel or the paneer tikka taco. The paneer taco has a hint of Indian flavors. Wasn t the best tasting taco I ve had. The falafel came in a lettuce leaf instead of a tortilla - which was cool but it ended up tasking like a hand held salad. The actual falafel fritters were ok  The white queso was plain tasting. Tasted kind of like melted velveeta....
Velvet Taco,443,I always get the Cuban Pig and the Shrimp and Grits. Such a great place to eat for any occasion. Whether you re here for lunch  dinner  or after a weekend out in the Domain  these tacos are a sure way to satisfy your cravings.
Velvet Taco,444,Fantastic  Super fast and delicious. This was our first time visiting Velvet Taco and it was worth the wait.
Velvet Taco,445,Last Tuesday we wanted tacos and have recently been their with our dogs and some friends. We loved the nacho cheese the 1st time and came back the second time for some tacos  The staff was super nice and totally helpful  Kudos to the grill guy for wearing a mask on that grill the whole time  You guys were amazing 
Velvet Taco,446,Don t really have anything negative to say about this place. Best non traditional tacos I ve tried. Nashville Hot Tofu and Slow Roasted Angus Brisket are my favorites.   4 Nashville Hot Tofu - Fantastic vegetarian option. Lots of flavor. Buttermilk ranch goes so well with the spiciness.   12 Slow Roasted Angus Brisket - You have to try this one. So satisfying.   3 Spicy Tikka Chicken is also really good if you like chicken tikka.  Hassle free online ordering and the fact that this place stays open later than any other food place in the Domain makes it my favorite place in the area.
Velvet Taco,447,Not bad tacos.. I m not sure if it s because I went at 3am in the morning but they couldn t make my taco right 3 times.
Velvet Taco,448,We came here for breakfast.  Tater tots in a breakfast taco   Seriously    I should have gone to a hole in the wall taco joint like Juan in a Million.  If you re going to open up a taco chain here  you d better bring your A-game  and this isn t it.  We were not impressed.  They really need to offer up breakfast options for people who hate eggs.  Not everyone wants eggs for breakfast.  Also  It was a crime that there was hardly any bacon in my breakfast taco.   Micro greens  were just tiny bits of some fancy sprout thing.    Stop churching up a simple breakfast taco 
Velvet Taco,449,The namesake is so weird as are the tacos but they re so damn good  I had the elote  shrimp and grits taco  fried paneer taco and the spicy tikka chicken taco  all of which were AMAZING  The flavors were all powerful and distinct which I loved  They weren t very spicy so I had to add hot sauce which set everything off  I can t wait to eat here again 
Velvet Taco,450,Love love love these tacos.  These are our eternal favorites.  Must try spicy paneer. Their tikka sauce is my husband s favorite   Plus it s open really late on weekdays and weekends.
Velvet Taco,451,I am an old velvet taco customer and miss it when I m staying in California. But what I liked about this particular location was that I ordered online and did pickup for the first time and the system said my order would be ready in 13 minutes only   When I went to go pick it up  the restaurant was very full and I was happy that they had my order ready and right. They gave me extra toppings on my elote  corn  as requested.   Parking was hard to find as this is located in a big outdoor shopping complex. The complex looked new with high end shops and was very busy on a Friday night. Parking spots are outside the different shops.
Velvet Taco,452,Velvet is as good as it gets. Open late. The  4 for vegetarians is the best tofu taco I ve ever had. Vegans can order the  4 without ranch. The kitchen and staff is very willing to accommodate to any modifications you request to your order.
Velvet Taco,453,Deelish  Velvet Taco is a awesome gem found in The Domain. Plenty of choices served up gourmet style. I don t eat meat but seafood ok and VT has options.
Velvet Taco,454,The staff at this Velvet Taco adds to an overall awesome experience - especially Sergio  I used to be an avid visitor of Velvet Taco up in Dallas  and I wasn t sure if this location would live up to the delicious memories I have... Turns out  it surpassed my Dallas experience  due to the bright outdoor atmosphere  music  and very friendly staff. Will be back ASAP for the  3.5 Picnic Chicken 
Velvet Taco,455,This place has a very casual atmosphere  amp  I liked that they have both indoor  amp  outdoor seating. When you walk in  you get in line to place your order  amp  then they call you over the mic to pick up your order. The girl that took my order was friendly and answered my questions about the menu with a smile. There is no wait staff  so you clean up after yourself  think Chipotle . I liked that they had unique taco choices  amp  a variety of beverages to choose from  to include alcohol . My choice was the featured taco of the day which cost just under  5. It was a pulled pork taco with hatch chilis  amp  fig salad  yes  fig salad . I m glad I chose this taco. It was excellent  The hatch chilis were fresh  not canned   amp  the fig salad balanced out the flavors  especially since there was a spicy sauce at the bottom. As sides  I ordered the elote cup  amp  tater tots  these are topped off with cheese  hatch chili sauce   amp  a fried egg . The elote is a bit spicy as well. Unfortunately  it was too much food for me  but I did try all three  amp  no complaints on the food at all  I sat outside  which was nice  amp  if you re a people watcher  great place to sit.
Velvet Taco,456,I ve heard mixed things about this place  but I really enjoyed my experience here. I got the spicy tikka chicken and the fish n chips with some red coconut curry queso cause I was feeling adventurous. I was surprised to find that the spicy tikka chicken had He right flavor and it was actually spicy  I m not sure if the rice was really necessary in the taco  but the tack had good flavor. The fish n  chips taco was also good with a properly fried piece of fish and an interesting curry mustard sauce on top. However I didn t have any fries in my taco and the rest was just some bland cabbage. The queso was my favorite  It had the Thai flavors without being too overwhelming. If you re at the Domain and you want to eat something casual and not spend too much  this is a good fusion place to try.
Velvet Taco,457,Fast service  very clean. Delicious tacos. The rotisserie chicken taco was delicious  amp  the BBQ jalape o sausage taco was amazing as well. My husband  amp  I debated as to which was better and we determined that they were both  1 in their category. Now let s talk about that divine queso  amp  blue chips  a must have delight.  I will be back for sure 
Velvet Taco,458,Some of these tacos are a little pricey in my opinion because you only get one for that price. But man are they packed with FLAVOR   We ordered the buffalo chicken  Nashville  paneer  fish and chips tacos. The fish and chips tacos are just perfect  The Nashville was really delicious except there was a lot of oil. The paneer taco was not too impressive. And the Buffalo chicken taco was pretty fresh.  I would definitely eat here again.  I did do take out so that could also be why I wasn t too impressed with one of the tacos. Their service is really good for take out. When you order multiple tacos  they number your tacos and so it corresponds to your bill so you know which taco is which.   Overall  I would definitely recommend.
Velvet Taco,459,I m writing this 1 star review based off the quantity and the price. I ordered chips and queso with my TINY cheese quesadilla as dine in. The chips come in a bag which makes it a little awkward for the table to eat. I paid about 12  for a baby quesadilla queso and a drink. The chips seem store bought. The queso was flavorful after I took out the insanely strong pickled onions out. This is a taco joint that doesn t serve beans and rice idk how that works. I was originally informed the quesadilla is small due to being a kids item but wow they weren t kidding  I would skip this place and go to a tea Mexican food restaurant which is half the price for way better quality food  I recommend chapla Mexican food restaurant around the corner 
Velvet Taco,460,Pros  delicious picnic taco  yummy salsa - has a Thai flavor to it which is perfect  the tots were the best - soooo delicious with the bacon and egg added  quick to order  reasonable prices  easily located in the domain  Cons  the tacos were a little hard to eat without spilling a lot  not enough indoor seating that is low enough for a high chair
Velvet Taco,461,Absolutely ridiculous. I ve never had a taco that bad in my entire life. Brought it back to the guy who was calling the order who said  oh yeah that s how it s supposed to be.
Velvet Taco,462,I am an Austin native and I have come here probably about 50 times. The food comes out quickly and is very good. I love the variety of options it is very vegetarian friendly. The tacos are small about the size of your palm unless you re Dwayne The Rock Johnson. I would order 3 even if you aren t a heavy eater. The prices are okay about  3-5 a taco. I always get the buffalo chicken taco and the fried tofu one and I switch up the third.
Velvet Taco,463,Excellent food  every single time. Buffalo chicken taco is my favorite  but angus brisket is a close second. Tots are great too.
Velvet Taco,464,Ordered a  2 and  12 at 12 33 got them at 12 57. Kitchen staff didn t appear to be in a hurry. The manager  who I presume to be  was texting on her phone.   The tacos were good but I won t be back. I don t have time for this during lunch.
Velvet Taco,465,I always get the  picnic   and it s actually the only one i ve had but their queso is very yummy. Delicious food  Fun environment  and for a boujee domain restaurant  it s pretty cheap 
Velvet Taco,466,Let me start by saying I am or was a huge fan   ate them frequently and used to recommend them. The Houston location was always spot on. Unfortunately the Austin location keeps disappointing me. The last time the fried chicken was too hard to the point where I couldn t eat it. This time the taco was extremely greasy. Oil dripping from both sides  sad to say I did not enjoy it.
Velvet Taco,467,Velvet Taco is all gimmick and no flavor.  We had a shredded pork taco  bacon and eggs taco  and chicken and waffles taco. The tortillas on each were over-engineered and lifeless. Just give me a corn tortilla   Pork taco  The pork was dry and under-salted. The overriding flavor was vinegar from the slaw.  Chicken and waffles taco  The chicken had hope and the gravy wasn t bad  but the waffle tortilla added nothing  and the green apple slaw was far too acidic and just didn t work.  Bacon  amp  eggs taco  My boyfriend ordered this one so I can t review it  but he says it was  confused  gimmicky  and not worth it   There are dozens of better taco joints in Austin. This is not one worth spending your money on.
Velvet Taco,468,Velvet  One of my go to spots post Rock Rose ha- this place is so great for being open till 4 am on the weekends  Really helps after a night out  or for your late night cravings. They have a variety of tacos to choose from.. my favorites being the chicken or paneer tikka masala  fried . Super good  The Shrimp n Grits one is great too. Of course  I always order the Coren Elote and a slice of their Red Velvet cake   Taco portions are pretty good.. I usually order two for a good meal.
Velvet Taco,469, update.   I did try substituting some of the meat tacos with avocado. I hate to say this  but it was so ordinary that I fell asleep halfway through my meal. It seems pointless to just visit this location for the falafel tacos now. I ll stick to Tacodeli until these guys up their veggie taco game.
Velvet Taco,470,Stopped in for a quick bite. It was a hot day so I tried the ahi poke taco and it was PERFECT with lettuce instead of tortilla. The poke was fresh and the seaweed was seasoned well. It was the right balance of protein and greens. Wish I ordered TWO
Velvet Taco,471,I wanted to try out velvet tacos on a Sunday afternoon. I ordered tacos online and went to the restaurant for pickup. The interior was modern and trendy. They were busy in the afternoon but the line moved quickly. Our instant favorite was spicy tikka chicken as it was very flavorful. But the picnic chicken and fish and chips both lacked flavor. Their food is okay but nothing to rave about.
Velvet Taco,472,Tacos  these were awesome  We ordered 4 different ones and they were all great   Kids menu  tasted good  but size was much smaller than expected. We ordered chicken strips and quesadillas. The chicken strips were good  but the portion sizes were much smaller than normal.
Velvet Taco,473,Best tacos ever. Totally loved spicy chicken taco and fish tacos. Vegetarians don t feel left out  as they have their very yummy paneer taco   yummmmmm . Would totally recommend for casual dinner nights.
Velvet Taco,474,The location  scenery and ambiance is great. However  we went to the Velvet Taco for their unique items and while they are original they are lacking in flavor. We ordered four tacos  2 hamburger tacos  flank steak and monte cristo  with an order of tater tots. All of this with two drinks came to the total of  32. That is a pricey meal for tacos. I was expecting to be wowed. The plating is fun but the taste was lacking. There really wasn t much flavor. The best thing we both thought was the tater tots. Seriously  who goes to a taco joint for tacos. The thing it has going for them is being located in the Domain where there are lots of young people drinking. It s not likely we will be back. Just not enough bang for my buck.
Velvet Taco,475,Seriously legit breaded spicy tofu  pickled veggies  cabbage slaw. My mauf broke so good. I had a bite of the red velvet cake. Glorious. I only wish they had more indoor seating.
Velvet Taco,476,Love love this place    I keep going back  My favorites are definitely the buffalo chicken taco and spicy tofu taco  It s so consistent every time whether it s dine in or takeout or delivery  They are so friendly and the tacos do not disappoint  So fulfilling   definitely one of my favorite taco places 
Velvet Taco,477,Unfortunately I gotta update this review. Recent visit to VT. 2-tacos  2-beverages  23.76. One of the weekly special tacos TLT- thanksgiving leftover taco. A  11  didn t even finish it. Blah  one Thirty Goat and a margarita. Has me wishing I d just spent that money on groceries and made several tacos.....the most accurate thing I can say about VT- they are consistently inconsistent. No plans to return.
Velvet Taco,478,Never disappoints. Great food  great service  great  ambience. Yummy velvet carrort cake
Velvet Taco,479,We decided to head on over to Velvet Taco for a late night bite to eat last night. We aren t locals and quickly learned all about the Saturday night happenings. We were a bit disappointed when there was only one girl taking orders when there was a line nearly out the door. Finally after waiting in line for about 6 minutes  a second cashier came along to help speed up the line. Way too many drunk people trying to get food at that time of the night. We were thankful there was good security and a quick food prep time. Could have used an extra cop at the front to help with the drunks ordering food. We were in and out just about as fast as we could. Tacos were delicious  buffalo chicken is a favorite . The people working there were extremely kind and patient with all that was going on. I m sure during the day is a much different experience.
Velvet Taco,480,I ve been here a couple times since it s open late and the area is very  turnt  as the youngsters might describe it.  Food  I ordered the chicken tikka and shrimp n grits along with tater tots. Being brown I was underwhelmed by the chicken tikka - I m not sure why the chicken is fried and the sauce is good but it s not chicken tikka. Also the rice was a carb overload for the taco. The grilled shrimp with fried cheesy grits were DELICIOUS   The unusual combination in a taco form just worked so perfectly. Only downside was the giant pieces of half cooked tomato inside - not a fan. The tater tots were pretty bad. I was really excited to try them because the pictures with the fried egg on top looked so good but was disappointed. I don t know why but it was very bland. No one in our party of 8 was willing to finish it for me.  For dessert  I had to try the famous red velvet cake. I thought it was a rip off at first but then I tried it with the dulce de leche and oh my gosh it was heaven. Th cake was extremely moist and there was a generous heap of cream cheese frosting on top. Normally I don t like sweet frosting but it was just perfect.  Service  The food took way too long. They forgot to make my order so by the time I got my food  everyone else was done eating - so that was not fun. Also the seating inside is a mess. I was not a fan of the tiny chairs - the awkward height difference among the seats was weird. There was no one to clean the tables so we had to do it ourselves.   Atmosphere  Very hipster  very austin. Definitely Insta worthy. I LOVED the art and paintings inside. The most unique aspect was the hand washing station outside the bathroom. It s so cool. You ll have to see for yourself.  Price  It s pretty expensive considering you get one taco per order. Not budget friendly for sure. But you are paying for the location and ambiance. I d rather opt for a corner street taco shop if you re more interested in eating good tacos.
Velvet Taco,481,Falafel taco was something new and well worth it. Will look forward to eating here again soon only in the state for a few days .
Velvet Taco,482,The margaritas are good and the tacos are tasty. My favorites is the shrimp and grits. I like the vibe and setup. If it s not too hot  it s fun to sit outside on the patio and people watch. The tacos are small according to my husband but a good size for me. I could eat one taco with a margarita or two tacos with no drink.
Velvet Taco,483,Cuban pork taco was very delicious.  I also had the red velvet cake.  That was delicious too.
Velvet Taco,484,Food was okay. Annatto Shredded pork taco was not my favorte but luckily we also got the giant chicken box  It came with a whole chicken  duh   two elotes  pico  and 6 flour tortillas. Definitely worth the price   So much food  we were stuffed after.
Velvet Taco,485,Happy to find some very original tacos on the menu at Velvet  different from what s on offer at Austin s many other wonderful taco trucks and restaurants.    I really liked the poke taco featuring with marinated  raw  Hawaiian-style ahi poke tuna on a fresh  crunchy lettuce leaf. Not wanting to be too healthy  I also tried the brisket taco that was oozing with chili mayo.   Not all the tacos were worthy of five stars. My brisket taco was too wet  with the liquid soaking through my tortilla. A friend tried the Texas something burger taco  and reported that it was boring and dry.  I also found the music too loud and frantic on the patio. Maybe I m getting old  But turn it down a notch please  I want to be able to hear my friends talk.   Overall  a decent option in the Domain  especially for a cheap er  lunch.
Velvet Taco,486,If you are in the Domain area please don t miss this place.  Tacos American-Mexican style so delicious and their elite is so  awesome and tasty. You should try it. After a great night  you should visit this place.
Velvet Taco,487,This cool little spot is located on Rock Rose in the Domain  which is the up and coming high class area of Austin. Atmosphere was great  and it s a order at the door kind of place where you pay before you get your meal - no servers.   I got my food pretty quickly and it was so yum  I had the elote corn side  fish and chips taco  and the annatto shredded pork taco. My favorite was the fish and chips taco and my least favorite was the pork taco. The pork taco was good  but it was a little too sweet for my taste. The elote corn was served in a cup and definitely had all the typical flavors you find in a traditional elote.   The only thing I didn t like about this place was that seating is mostly along bars and high tables in the middle where you have to sit next to strangers. I guess it s great if you don t mind  but I prefer to have my own table even though this isn t a traditional restaurant.   All in all  good food and cool environment 
Velvet Taco,488,So delicious  tons of flavor. The place is cute  especially the bathroom area  and tacos instagram-perfect. I got  2 Rotisserie Chicken  3 Picnic Chicken and  14 Shrimp and Grits...ALL THE THEM WERE DELICIOUS. Plus elotes in a cup  just as good as Torchy s. This place is one of my new favorite taco places in Austin.
Velvet Taco,489,My partner and I are transplants from the west coast and absolutely ADORE tacos. When we saw this place on a shopping outing we figured we d give it a go.  The exterior interior were pleasant. The ambiance was nice. But those were pretty much the only redeeming qualities.  Although the descriptions on the menu were alluring  the taste of the tacos we got were the polar opposite.  My partner got the Rotisserie Chicken  Buffalo  Shrimp Grits   amp  Falafel tacos. I got the Tofu tacos in the Veg section. Both of us were exceptionally displeased with the lack of flavor between all but the Rotisserie Chicken. Furthermore  the Tofu was inundated with oil   amp  we felt that all of the tacos were slightly off  whether it be a lack of consistency in flavor pairings or missing a certain element.
Velvet Taco,490,Usually love this place but found a long ass hair in my taco tonight.  So disappointing    So disgusting..like wyf velvet.
Velvet Taco,491,The tacos were delicious.   Service is a little slow so give yourself a little extra time.   Cleanliness 4 5 Service 3 5  Food 4 5  Location 5 5
Velvet Taco,492,I m a simple man. I see tacos  I give 5 stars. Since I m under the character minimum  here s some filler text.
Velvet Taco,493,It never fails that every time I go here to order chips and queso only  because it s so good tbh  my order is delayed. I went there twice just ordered that and at least 6 other people got their tacos before me. What gives  If that could just not be a thing I could really like this place.
Velvet Taco,494,Really wanted to like this place.   Chicken tikki taco or Ahi Poke taco    Sounds awesome    But they weren t.....   the Tikki was drenched in sauce on the worst tasting tortilla  are they store-bought  . The Poke didn t have the tortilla issue as it was wrapped in lettuce.  Took one bite - and the damned thing exploded   Juices started squirting out of everywhere.  At least it got a good laugh out of my son   Then there are those tater tots.  Heaven    Come with an awesome miniature spork.  Would go back for them - enough calories for a full meal.
Velvet Taco,495,Favorite spot to go to in Austin for delicious upgraded tacos. Look forward to the day they come to San Antonio. I love that you can get a lettuce wrap option for any of their tacos.
Velvet Taco,496,I tried the chicken Tikka taco and it was pretty good  Didn t think it would be this good. I had to order another one.
Velvet Taco,497,Very much liked buffalo and chicken tikka tacos Margarita was soo bad  Probably the worst margarita I ve tasted so far
Velvet Taco,498,Being from California  I am not a fan of  Tex-Mex  however  I am in love with Velvet Taco  I m always offended when people suggest Torchys. Velvet Taco never lets me down  Angus Brisket and the Elote are my go to but honestly  everything I ve tried has been phenomenal. Oh and don t forget the hot sauce. It s a win  A little pricey for tacos but well worth it 
Velvet Taco,499,Please see this. Past 2 visits have been really bad. Please do not change the recipe. Or I don t know if it s a new crew during the day. We come here every week for more than a year now.  Last visit  paneer batter was too salty and oil was not hot enough so it just soaked in oil. The corn was not fresh and too gooey. This visit  paneer had no batter and had burnt solid. It was the worst.   Both these times we came around noon on a weekend. None of the regular folks were there. Please tell me this is not a crew change and the restaurant is doomed. You are my favorite restaurant in Texas  please fix this. The one star is only so that you see this. Will change it back to five star soon after the next visit  if it s back to normal.
Velvet Taco,500,I was not much of a taco person but Velvet taco is an exception. Amazing concept and delicious tacos    I tried spicy chicken taco made of chicken tenders dipped with tikka sauce  basmati rice and topped with basil leaves. In sides I tried Elote corn  corn kernels mixed with creamy queso  tastes best with a little squeeze of lime.   Velvet taco will always be my choice if I crave for tacos.
Bennu Coffee,1,Stopped by hear while walking around the area for the Austin studio tour  definitely look into that  . It was a chilly day so stopping in for a coffee sounded like a great idea  and it was   They have a lot of fairly unique options  especially for their mochas. I was tempted  but felt autumnal so got a pumpkin spice latte. This  however  tasted pretty differently from other PSLs  in a good way. It tasted much more like a pumpkin pie. I just wish they were closer so I could go back and try more of their coffees   The cafe itself is also a great place to work study  with ample seating and outlet access  and not too loud  even though it was pretty full .
Bennu Coffee,2,I was running around all day and needed a snack so I stopped into bennu and grabbed a prepackaged caprese sandwich and...I just can t. For  8 and some change  10 with a tip this is what I got...  Com on Bennu   do better  And before you go blaming the company you may have purchased them from  I don t know if you make them in house or not  remember you willingly carry their goods  or not so goods in this case .  Are you really ok charging   8  for some stale ass bread  with a tiny smudge of pesto  one thinly slice of mozzarella and a sprinkle of sun dried tomatoes  Sincerely asking.
Bennu Coffee,3,Back again to pick up my ATX Coffee Crawl Passport  check out  theatxcoffeecrawl on instagram for more info   and get a little work done today   Tried something new this time and got the Don Quixote  iced  no whip  -  5.95  1 tip. This is another one of their signature mochas made with Azteca D Oro spiced chocolate and Mexican spiced powder  available hot or iced. Despite being a mocha  this drink is not overwhelmingly sweet  nor bitter  and the chocolate is really nicely balanced notes of vanilla  almond and cinnamon.   As a side note  it is really nice to see the place pretty full this visit and seemingly getting back in the groove of pre-covid operations  Well done Bennu
Bennu Coffee,4,Loved this place  Opens super late so that s a plus. Hot chocolate was the bomb  and their mochas as well
Bennu Coffee,5,Love that this coffee shop is open 24 7. They have a few specialty mochas and the service is fast. I also love that they serve food late at night. They have pre-made sandwiches  cold pasta  pastries  vegan cupcakes  and a whole list of Hoboken Pie. I ordered a dirty chai latte with soy milk which was very good and a slice of the vegan pizza. Pretty tasty and it even had vegan cheese on it.  This spot is very convenient when you re up all night studying or working. The place gets pretty crowded but slowly dies down after 12am.
Bennu Coffee,6,Woke up early and this is one of the only places open before 7 AM  so right there it starts off well as far as I m concerned.  Just ordered a couple black coffee. overall good tasting coffee  not too weak but also not too strong.   Will definitely be back especially if I m up and moving early 
Bennu Coffee,7,Delicious coffee in Austin  TX  This is a great place to go if you re looking for a new study spot or just passing through town.  If you like sweet drinks I would try one of the gourmet mochas. My usual order is the Great Gatsby  which is  a lavish twist of white and dark chocolate sauces topped with home-made whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  It is rich  chocolatey  and so tasty. In my opinion  it definitely sweet but still holds onto that underlying coffee flavor. I also really like the Pride and Prejudice.  Another plus is that Bennu is open 24 hours  so it s ready any time you are.
Bennu Coffee,8,If you re looking for a cafe to do work  this is a great one. There s dim lighting  outlet cords hanging from the ceiling  plenty of seating  and the coffee is great  I also loved the large servings.  The only thing that really bothered my was the music from the speakers. I hated it actually. It can be quite annoying  so I recommend taking noise cancelling headphones. The music is techy and loud.  The cafe also serves sandwiches  pizzas  tamales  and pastries 
Bennu Coffee,9,The best coffee shop I ve found in Austin  Lots of outlets  lots of comfy seating  delicious coffee  amp  food  friendly workers  good music -- it s just perfect. There s even a printer inside you can use. The hours are really convenient too. The crowd fluctuates but it s usually not too crowded. Great place to study 
Bennu Coffee,10,Awesome cafe  diverse selection of drinks and treats  for after a late night where you want an early morning pick-me-up.   The vegan peanut butter cup  black bean pickled cactus and potato taco  and the Scarlet Letter  a spicy dark hot chocolate  were a blessing of bits of goodness that woke me right up.  The atmosphere is also great  a quieter cafe with a lot of people working  so this is a great place to spend a few hours hunkered down and snacking refueling throughout.
Bennu Coffee,11,Alas... this one we just couldn t get into. Maybe it s just us but our cappuccino was so bitter. In like an unredeeming  unforgivable sorta way. Cardinal sin in a serious coffee city.
Bennu Coffee,12,The iced matcha latte with almond milk was decent but not the best I ve had. They only offered it in 16 oz size.   The service was friendly and nice. However  the cashier did ask very loudly if I wanted to tip which gave me a lot of pressure.   I was not the biggest fan of the interior design. It was dark and gloomy. They did have an outdoor seating  but their staff members did frequently take cigarettes smoke breaks outside.   They offered free wifi  but they gave me a code for it that would only last 3 hours for 1 device only. The code was different for each person.
Bennu Coffee,13,Bennu on early Sunday morning for coffee. Spiced Chili  Mocha. One of the best I have ever tried.  They have a full mocha menu to work your way through.  Jazz playing from a local Austin group.  Nice sound and relaxing.  Bennu is an ancient Egyptian deity linked with the Sun  creation  and rebirth. He may have been the original inspiration for the Phoenix legends that developed in Greek mythology.  My impromptu folding of an origami Phoenix.
Bennu Coffee,14,I ve been to the south congress location but I definitely prefer this one  Parking is sooo easy much easier than youd expect. It s very quiet and cozy inside so you can definitely get a lot of studying done here. Coffee was delicious   will be coming back soon this will probably be my new go to studying spot
Bennu Coffee,15,Left a review of this place  acknowledging the racist staff  approx 5mos ago   and how ironically appropriate that those finding it funny are of the very light skin tone... This place is STILL horrible and will be until it adjusts attitudes and staff.
Bennu Coffee,16,This review has nothing to do with the food. It is with the service. I have notice it quite a while that some staff  staff are very negligent or just purely racist. Who ever is the guy and girl currently serving at 3 18 pm on 8 25 2022 need some extensive customer service training. The owner can contact me for more details. Thank you
Bennu Coffee,17,If you are looking for a late coffee or hot chocolate this is the place I would recommend. It is a 24hr coffee shop located in the MLK Jr. Blvd in Austin  TX. I stopped by while taking pictures of murals around Austin and was ready to drive back an hour to my hotel.   It has a bar area beside the tables.
Bennu Coffee,18,It s a decent coffee shop  get your Americano for around  3 or Cappuccino for around  4. Same price you d expect anywhere in town.  The vibe was very gloomy. It reminded me of the coffee shop in the show  Friends.  Plenty of early morning crowds getting take out to wake themselves and usually a few of the tables taken up by people trying to get work done.  My americano was nothing special  but that s what an americano is. My fiance ordered and iced coffee which she said was fine. Given the convenience and proximity to my house  i ll probably be back  but i m sure there s better coffee in Austin.
Bennu Coffee,19,My friend and I were checking out the  You re my Butter Half  mural and spotted this coffee shop right across the street - we were so delighted to find out that it happened to serve delicious coffee    I ordered the Don Quixote  which was a spiced chocolate mocha with whipped cream and Mexican spice powder. It was creamy and decadent  just the right amount of sweet in my opinion  and I got to order it with oat milk too  They offer soy  almond  coconut  and oat milk as non-dairy alternatives  which is great for any of us lactose sensitive folks.     My friend got the Great Gatsby and I got to try a bit of it  and it tasted amazing too. It was a mocha drink with white and dark chocolate sauces. Super yummy   They have COVID protocols in place right now and this location happened to have an outdoor patio area to sit too. Very cute spot with string lights overhead   Highly recommend this place for its mocha drinks. If you like sweet and creamy coffee  this is the place to go  It also looks to be open 24 7  which is awesome for those who are looking for coffee at any time of day.
Bennu Coffee,20,Best coffee I ve had so far  I love the themes they have for their coffees. My absolute favorites are Don Quixote and The Raven. Must try if you re in the area 
Bennu Coffee,21,HUGE COCKROACH crawled up on my leg while I was studying... I was horrified. This happened 9 25. Will be the last time I study here. Staff  please invest in an exterminator pest control.
Bennu Coffee,22,Open early   Great coffee.  Good tacos.  What more could you want   They actually have a lot of other things.  Pastries.  Free WiFi.  Ample outlets and setting.  Lunch.  But a 6am I m looking for espresso and tacos.
Bennu Coffee,23,A very spacious coffee shop that s a perfect place for working studying  It s dark and cozy and pretty quiet most of the time. I d recommend trying their specialty mochas  which are all book themed. I tried their Oliver Twist mocha  which was strong and not too sweet.
Bennu Coffee,24,Bennu is one of my favorite places to study off campus  The interior is cozy and the coffee is strong. I love that they have a variety of gourmet mochas named after pieces of literature. My go-to mocha is the Pride and Prejudice  which also happens to be one of my favorite classics- aka why I was drawn to ordering it in the first place.
Bennu Coffee,25,I decided to try this place on a whim. I ordered the Great Gatsby mocha which has dark and white chocolate sauces and drizzled with chocolate shavings. It went down so smooth. It was the perfect pick-me-up for these rainy days. I definitely will be back.
Bennu Coffee,26,I would say that Bennu isn t my preferred place for coffee  but I think that s a personal preference. I found the coffee to be mediocre with the indoor being crowded and outside being dim.
Bennu Coffee,27,This Bennu location was the gateway to all 2 month long Bennu streak. This was the first Bennu that I have ever been to and it has just gradually turned into my go-to spot  especially when testing season begins.   My go-to drink is the Iced Bennu with less ice and whip cream on top. I typically recommend this to friends that likes drinks more on the sweeter side but still needs a caffeine hit if they need to stay awake.  And surprisingly  Bennu s pizza is pretty freaking good too  something that I did not expect from a coffee shop. If you want more of a savory flavor  the Gamboa is sooooo good. If you re looking for more of a sweet flavor  then the Torres is the way to go     Tip  Don t take the drink to-go because the glass cups are larger  And get less ice if you want more of the drink itself.    Goes for both locations    Pros  - It s 24 hours  with lots of tables.  - It doesn t break your bank. Most of the drinks and food are a pretty good size. - Nice coffee shop vibes. A really great place to get some work done or to stay awake at night. - They have a printer  If you need to print last minute.  - In comparison to the other location  the music is more cafe-vibes.   Cons  - If you come during finals week or any busy times  seating can be really hard to find but people are really nice about sharing  - The wifi can either be really slow or really spotty. So if you really need your laptop to get work done  come with a hotspot as a backup. - This location is a lot dimmer than the other location and parking can fill up really quickly so you may have to park across the street.   Overall  a great place to study and hang out with good drinks and food.
Bennu Coffee,28,Bennu is an east Austin mainstay for great coffee in an eclectic  relaxed atmosphere. This location is  open 24 7  so I spent countless all-nighters here in college in their cozy interior and on their patio studying and hanging out with friends. On a recent trip to Austin  we visited on a Saturday morning mans were pleasantly surprised to see that not much has changed. I ordered an iced americano and she had the classic iced bennu  and we shared a delicious croissant. We enjoyed our breakfast on their nice patio  which is great for people watching. Bennu is a must for morning  or even late night  coffee and a great place to hang-out in the area.
Bennu Coffee,29,I always tip well. They ask you directly here at transaction  Would you like to tip   You tell them how much. It s counter service. I said yes. Usually love this place but the dry bagel  took a look at it and threw it out. Sad Danny. Oh guess growing up on NYC bagels and a block of cream cheese ON the bagel has me depressed in this insufferable heat.
Bennu Coffee,30,One of the FEW cafes in Austin providing comfortable seating. So many places have horrible seating intentionally so you don t stick around long  such poor customer service . I always recommend Bennu to friends and support them often mainly in appreciation of the seating alone.  Big bonus points for good coffee and cool staff  Never change 
Bennu Coffee,31,The best coffee that there is in Austin   If you ever are craving an iced coffee I highly recommend the iced bennu.
Bennu Coffee,32,There was no parking in the lot so I left my blinkers on and ran inside grabbing a tea to go. Not only was I accosted but someone in line  but the cashier was incredibly rude and disgruntled. Then she added water to my drinks to water them down. I ll take my business elsewhere 
Bennu Coffee,33,This place is super cozy  Lots of outlets and good lemonade. The wifi is only for 3 hours which is kinda annoying but still super nice for a cozy study sesh.
Bennu Coffee,34,The iced bennu and iced blennu are both incredibly good. Bennu is much sweeter so if you re the type to barely put any sugar into your daily coffee BUT still want something sweet  I d go with the blennu.   Outdoor seating  a good amount of open seats  Indoor seating  a good amount of seats spaced out    Can order and pick up your drinks easily.   Parking  private lot
Bennu Coffee,35,Barista gave a very sarcastic  wow  thank you   after I opted for no tip. They don t even make their own food  just serve other hot spots in the area. Isn t a coffee shop in East Austin supposed to have some sort of  positive vibe  to go along w  it s  6 cup 
Bennu Coffee,36,It is a great spot with good parking. I got the scarlet letter and don quixote. Can recommend the scarlet letter for its rich blend of flavors that hits all the notes that dark chocolate and spice fans love. Atmosphere is good. AC is at the right temperature. Good spot for students to study at.
Bennu Coffee,37,This is a really nice coffee shop near campus. The lighting is quite subtle and the layout is organized. They recently shifted everything around so that there s more tables to fit more people studying or chilling here. The music isn t obnoxious like a lot of places I ve been to before  the staff are nice  and it s a good place to study at   Speaking to the refreshments  Bennu iced coffee is a go to  It s affordable at  4 and tastes great  coming in a nice tall glass. Definitely something to try for that long night ahead.   Also  the pizza is TASTY MAN. I m usually skeptical of food served at coffee shops but I gave this a go after a friend s rec and dang does it taste nice. Vegan has quite a lot on it and comes at a price of  3.75 per slice  which is quite reasonable. Definitely also worth a try 
Bennu Coffee,38,Great coffee shop  They do not mind answering questions we had about the items. The pineapple smoothie I had tasted like Dole Whip and the iced mocha my friend had said it was delicious. Clean area and free wifi  welcoming environment in general.
Bennu Coffee,39,Another excellent coffee option in my new neighborhood. Ordered online and wasn t able to add stevia or almond milk  but I arrived and the smart barista had waited to make my coffee to make sure it was piping hot and I was able to customize it how I liked. Friendly staff and excellent coffee at an affordable price. I ll be back once it cools down since it s a bit of a walk from my place. Can t wait.
Bennu Coffee,40,I went over to this place over weekend hoping some great coffee and productive hours of study. Ended up getting itchy skin home on legs. Terribly hurting skin and sore throat. I have never ever experienced such skin itching this was for the first time after sitting straight 2  hours. I thought it might be some allergy or something. Ended up going the next day there as well. My skin on legs even worst now. This place is extremely unhygienic and non sanitary. I doubt anything here is clean. As much as I love coffee I hate this place for having zero cleaning. They should really consider cleaning this place.
Bennu Coffee,41,Great coffee  but a terrible ordering system. I always end up feeling unwelcome. On 3 different visits I ve ended up waiting over 20min for a single drink while people who just pulled up get theirs right away. I don t even think ordering online is worth it when it s a struggle every time. And then the staff tends to get huffy as if their systems technical issue is my fault. I m just trying to prepay for my drink and keep contact low and suddenly my order is a problem. I can find other shops where I feel more welcome  and it s too bad because those steamed milk teas are delicious.
Bennu Coffee,42,Friendly service and drinks more than sufficed. Interior was comfortable and welcoming. Loved the baristas t-shirt .
Bennu Coffee,43,My new favorite coffee place  if I ever visit Austin again. They delivered a PERFECT triple 16oz  hot  latte. I m trying to train myself to say  hot  before they have to ask  and every place asks since this is Texas and they seem quite incredulous that I want a hot drink  but I m used to it now.   We didn t get to enjoy the full Bennu experience since it was outdoor ordering due to COVID  but a perfect latte is really all I need and am grateful I got that. We will be back tomorrow on our way out of town and I am counting the hours 
Bennu Coffee,44,Coffee lovers rejoice   In the midst of the current water-pocalypse in Austin  Bennu is still serving delicious coffee  I came here with a friend to study since a lot of the coffee shops  including starbucks   were not serving drinks due to the water boil notice. Luckily  upon entering  I was happy to see that they had plenty of water jugs lined up. I ordered the Pride and Prejudice and it was pretty tasty. The whole shop has a really cozy vibe  and they aren t gimmicky like some other coffee places. The noise level here was also decent  making it a good place to study. The only weird thing about this place is their playlist - it was a weird mixture of country and pop
Bennu Coffee,45,Bennu Coffee is one of the few coffee shops in north East Austin. It s competitive advantage- it stays open late and serves real food  It s a large cafe with tons of seating  free wifi  and food options. I ordered a latte and two slices of pizza. Both were really good.  If you need a chill place to unplug  go here 
Bennu Coffee,46,I wrote this song about an experience at Bennu Coffee  the East side s best coffee nook.  Here s the link  a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.youtube.com 2Fwatch 3Fv 3Dksg_8gFslpA amp s 08c9bdb194d9506320d31d50e788a46337c5a632d93abd8151b3dfc4b003c96b  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  youtube.com watch v ksg_   a  Cheers Reginald  Doctor  Sandpaper
Bennu Coffee,47,The Iced Bennu is literally like crack to me  LOL. It s super smooth  a little caramelly  perfectly sweet   amp  a LITTLE reminiscent of Vietnamese Iced Coffee. It gave me so much energy so it was a mistake drinking it at 6pm  haha.   The inside was a little dark but there were still lots of people studying there. They have plenty of outlets hanging from the ceiling which I thought was pretty cool.
Bennu Coffee,48,In comparison to the other location this one feels a bit more packed and has dinner lighting  but I still love this place. You can see the myriads if college students working hard  or hardly working  here. They have so much variety of chairs and tables and seating so you can pick what is best for you  I myself am a study-with-my-back-to-the-wall kinda person . This would be a good place to group study or cram as the best part is that it is open 24 hrs     I tried the hibiscus tea here and it wasn t really my favorite.. but I regret not getting one of their speciality drinks because those sounded delish. You can definitely camp out here for a while and the environment is the ample amount of quietness loudness for maximum productivity.
Bennu Coffee,49,Best spot for coffee on the east side  I miss going into study and work  They have such friendly staff and the coffee is so good. My favorite has to be the Don Quixote but you can t go wrong with whatever you get  hot or cold
Bennu Coffee,50,I came here for believe it or not a slice of pizza. They get the pizza from Hoboken Pie. I had just landed after getting off a late flight and had a craving and didn t want to go downtown.   I gave 4 starts for the place  ambience  service...3 stars for the pizza. The pizza was reheated pizza done in a toaster oven. It was good because at 2 am my options were severely limited the taste was decent nothing to come back for. I didn t have any coffee  because it was already late.   There s plenty of seating  there s WiFi  there s a printer  this a great spot for meetings. This is great if you re looking for something different than Starbucks with a distinct Austin flare to it.  I definitely would come back here to try the coffee offerings.
Bennu Coffee,51,I like Bennu mostly for the amount of seating and the fact that it s 24 hours. Coffee s good but not super strong. A lot of the reviews mention unfriendly employees  but I ve actually experienced the opposite  and I come here most weeks.
Bennu Coffee,52,They ve recently implemented a system where you can only use the wifi for 3hrs with each purchase. I always buy several items when i begin my work  but having to keep track of time and purchase every 3hrs becomes tedious...
Bennu Coffee,53,Great coffee. Option of sitting indoor or outdoor. Fair price. Private parking lot. Excellent atmosphere to study  read a book or just anything that involves some concentration. Checks all the boxes     Will be back here again and again 
Bennu Coffee,54,Bennu is like the holy grounds for local college students  but I m not too impressed.   Came here evening time and ordered a hibiscus iced tea and espresso vegan cupcake. Both were tasty  but not out of this world. I do appreciate how Bennu offers plenty of drink and treat options though. For the drink and cupcake  I paid around  6-7.   Like always  Bennu was pretty crowded so you definitely have to scout for a seat  The interior is a mish-mash of different tables and chairs  but the lighting is kind of dark. Parking can be a hassle since 1  Bennu is always busy and 2  you re limited to a few parking spots and street parking.   Overall  it s an typical coffee shop - nothing stands out to me.
Bennu Coffee,55,Such a fun and quirky little spot that s close enough to downtown without the traffic and woes Austin is known for. There is so much space at this spot that you can definitely find a spot to work out of or study. They have very strong wifi and strong coffee  most importantly . You can even grab a small breakfast bite like tacos and bagels. The seats and chairs are all mismatches so that definitely made it fun and kinda challenged you to find one that speaks to you. Althought I grabbed my coffee in a to-go cup as I could only hang out for like twenty minutes  I m certain I ll be back when I go up to ATX again.
Bennu Coffee,56,I love this place. 24hrs  Although it s a coffee shop that college students frequent to socialize and study  I ve found myself comfortable here every time I ve came. There is a lot of seating inside and out  but this place stays packed so things can get cozy. It s not for people who are looking for quiet  or who can t zone out into headphones. But speaking of music  I love how the music changes based on what barista is working. The coffee is good. Sometimes I bring my own and just read or do work. I m a regular at this place and I don t see that changing anytime soon  The only con I would say is that parking is really limited. There s a small lot and street parking  but if you go during peak study hours  it may take you a while to find a spot.
Bennu Coffee,57,Really loved the oatmilk iced latte  Love the outdoor patio area as well. They had a lot of really interesting flavors and some seemingly really sugary choices  but something for everyone  My friend got the matcha latte and liked it too.
Bennu Coffee,58,I like coming to Bennu because of its hours but never really have a good experience here. Parking is almost always an issue because the lot is so small  all the tables are almost always full  and it almost always takes more than 30 minutes to get my drink. I ve had them mess up my order before and once they forgot I placed an order till I showed them my receipt. While I get that it s crowded  they should be better about keeping track of things like that. When they do give me my drinks  I enjoy getting the Moby Dick as well as the Scarlet Letter. Their whipped cream is really good    Not every desk is close to an outlet so if your laptop can t hold a charge  that might be an issue. The internet is also spotty. Sometimes I go and everything is fine  sometimes I have faulty connection and sometimes it s just not working. The last two times I went  it wasn t working  which is why I quit going. All in all  I recommend coming here for your late night study sessions or if you want to leave your house for a bit.
Bennu Coffee,59,THIS PLACE IS AWESOME   First of all  they are open 24 7. That s a plus when it comes to finals.   Second  they have affordable coffee that taste so good   I love how their mocha drinks are named after popular books. For example  Pride and Prejudice  Moby Dick  Scarlet Letter.  Even just their regular house brewed coffee taste great   My top two drinks I order is the regular hot latte and regular ice coffee with hazel nut syrup    Third  the interior design and atmosphere is perfect for a chill hangout  casual date or just to go study. There are a bunch of tables and seats. However  every time I got there it s always packed so you kind of have to fight for your seat.  If you smoke or just love nature they have outdoor seatings too with cute lights hanging outside.   Overall I love this place and definitely recommend 
Bennu Coffee,60,I just got a great cappuccino here. Great warm inside during a rainy day. Needs a bit fresh air though. Full of college students. Silent  good place to study.
Bennu Coffee,61,Great iced cappuccino  definitely recommend it here  Ambiance is kind of weird and staff was rude  but if you want a quick drink to go it s fine.   I ve had their lattes which are ok but the iced cappuccino is delicious 
Bennu Coffee,62,I ve come here a million times to study when I was in school. That s basically what it is  at least the one on MLK  it s a place for students to study. If you re not doing that or at least doing something on a laptop or reading a book  you re gonna feel out of place. You don t come here to chat with someone on a first date or something like that.   The food is good. I like the pizza but it s too bad they don t have vegan pizza. However they do have cactus tamales sometimes which is really good. One point I want to make though is that any food you get will be snack size and it will be about  5 and up. So order food if you want a bite. If you want to fill yourself up expect to spend at least  20. However the pastries are like  3 I think and the cookies are pretty big so you can get filled up if you just eat desserts.   I also want to comment on the WiFi. Absolutely don t come here if you need a steady connection. The WiFi is god awful. I ve been here four years and it s been awful the entire time. Luckily for me I don t really care because I always have my WiFi hotspot so I d recommend to use that if possible.   A really good drink to try here is really anything off the mocha list. Pride and prejudice  they re all good. It s probably the only place in town with so many different styles of mocha.
Bennu Coffee,63,It may not be the fanciest coffee shop out there  bit hey  it has great coffee and that s really what I mostly need  The iced tea is also fairly standard and their breakfast tacos are hugee. The breakfast tacos were about 1.5x the size of the ones I ve had before.   At first  I thought the mismatch of all the chairs was a bit strange but they were cozy  so I m not going to  harp on that. Service was friendly  too. Would come back if I m in the area.
Bennu Coffee,64,Bennu is a 24-hour coffee shop located close to UT  which is convenient for students. In terms of a study atmosphere  it s good but not great. They have pretty ample seating  although it can get very crowded at peak times   lots of outlets  and decent wifi. However  the lighting is pretty dim  and the music can be hit or miss  I was there recently on a Saturday morning and they were blasting country music that even my earplugs couldn t block out .   I do like their coffee drinks a lot. I usually get their regular latte which is pretty good. Occasionally I ll treat myself with one of their specialty mochas - my favorite so far has been the Don Quixote. Their staff is generally pretty friendly  although some are more friendly than others. Getting a spot in their parking lot can be challenging but there s plenty of places to street park nearby.   All in all  a decent study spot with good coffee 
Bennu Coffee,65,This place is pretty chill honestly. It gets really loud pretty late at night at this spot but it still gets the job done especially when you need to have some really tasty s mores. My biggest complaint with this place is it seems that they are understaffed because plates rarely get taken up and it causes the place to look pretty dirty. This reasons are what is keeping me from giving it that perfect 5 star rating. Overall  I had a really good experience and will return in the future.
Bennu Coffee,66,First discovered their pecan cold brew via Gourmand s and love the flavor profile. I didn t realize Bennu had its own brick and mortar until walking in the area and having a hankering for coffee and ending up here because another place was closed. Their walk up window is perfect with the current situation  especially because I have a dog  so it s so nice to not have to tie him up to go in to order and or collect my coffee. You can order ahead of time or straight from the window. All precautions are taken and while it may be a longer wait in between each order  it s nice to see everyone  customers and the biz  following all the social distancing rules. I ve been mostly sticking to the pecan cold brew  Larry   but the last time I went  I got a Blennu which is half their iced bennu and half cold brew. I don t exactly what an iced bennu is but it does have dairy in it and I m assuming some vanilla...the cold brew cuts the sweetness just so  I didn t need to add anything to it  If you like it on the sweeter side  just get the Iced Bennu 
Bennu Coffee,67,Must go to coffee place. We were visiting from out of town and I wish there was one of these in Phoenix  A great vibe  the employees were very nice and helpful. It was a wonderful stop for a small breakfast and coffee during our Texas road trip 
Bennu Coffee,68,I had a meeting down the street and stoped by this morning on a whim. I ordered an ice coffee which was wonderfully delicious. It was busy and there was a minor error on my transaction. When I notified management it was handled immediately. The staff went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. I was incredibly impressed with the companies professionalism  customer satisfaction and service.   I m truly grateful they genuinely care for their clients. I came back later that evening. The ambiance was relaxing and the music was fun and upbeat.   This is an Austin gem and I love supporting my local coffee houses. This one is definitely on the top of my list. BTW  my bestie orders some pastries and she absolutely loved them.  I ll be back with friends and highly recommend you stop by. It s also open 24 7 .
Bennu Coffee,69,I completely recommend Moby Dick with Soy milk and also the Great Gatsby with Soy milk  The pizza is also a good lunch dinner option   I was also amazed at how they accommodate to the students with plenty of outlets hanging from the ceiling and many tables for big study groups 
Bennu Coffee,70,Came here once again with my friend and unfortunately the quality of our drinks hasn t increased since the last time. I got the iced latte with oat milk and my friend got the Oliver Twist. The flavor of the coffee was quite lacking and bland. I shan t be recommending Benny to my friends.
Bennu Coffee,71,Iced coffee was alright  but everything else is right up my alley. Open 24 hours  Yes please.   I wish I had time to find a spot  set up shop  and get some work done but I had to leave. This place is really huge and plenty of seating. It has that nice and busy but quiet vibe. That feeling everyone else is serious about getting work done so that motivates you to be super productive. The majority of the seating are large round tables  so expect someone to join you if you have a free seat.  For such a large place  the parking is limited. Expect to possibly park off the streets near the residential.
Bennu Coffee,72,Cute coffeeshop that serves good coffee and some food options  including slices of Hoboken Pie - even their vegetarian and vegan pies     Best thing about Bennu  It s open 24 7.   Worst  Soooooo crowded. I went for a cup of coffee at 11pm on a WEDNESDAY.  During the summer  so it can t have been students studying for finals   And yet it was PACKED. No tables  no parking.
Bennu Coffee,73,My favorite coffee shop  great drinks  great pastries  great baristas. Especially like that all the baristas seem to enjoy their job  amp  working here  Best coffee shop in Austin. Try their Bennu  or their Blennu if you don t enjoy extra sweet drinks . So yummmy.
Bennu Coffee,74,Super cute local coffee shop  specializing in gourmet mochas  I came in on a Saturday morning to get caffeinated and was amazed by how many people were already situated at the tables. Seemed like an awesome place to study at and I loved the artwork on the walls - most of which were created by local artists. I ordered the Pride  amp  Prejudice  the first item on their menu. It s simple and a perfect blend of chocolate powder and home-made whipped cream. However  there s plenty of other options for you to choose from  whether you like dark  milk  or white chocolate in your mocha.  The best part  It s located across from the  You re My Butter Half  mural at the United Way of Greater Austin. Perfect photo op from out of towners like me   
Bennu Coffee,75,One of the best study places that I ve ever been to and I would definitely be back  The coffee is priced well and tastes great  the sandwiches was tasty as well but what I liked most was the ambience of the place it s a different feel like that  old school library  homely  feel  Perfect for out of the house study vybe   Love love LOVE it 
Bennu Coffee,76,I am from California but have been visit Austin several times a year for the past 6 years. In these visits  I prioritized trying all of the local coffee shops that I didn t have back home and for a long time Epoch was my favorite. I now see all the reviews that compare Epoch with Bennu and I see why... both are the cozy  mismatched  24 hour hipster shops perfect for studying and hanging out with friends. But Bennu has something that Epoch does not which is friendly baristas  I m tired of the apathetic employees at Epoch who blast their terrible music on the AUX cord for the whole shop to listen to. Bennu is relaxing and the baristas are pleasant. And MY GOD  The Raven mocha is so good  Beware of very limited parking though.
Bennu Coffee,77,Came in because I was in search of a 24 7 coffee haven that would keep me awake prior to my ungodly early flight out of AUS.  Bennu was exactly what I was looking for...unpretentious little near eastside coffee nook where the seating was plenty  the espresso was strong  and there were enough computer outlets for everyone and anyone to plug-in and charge to their heart s content   The very friendly barista did a great job of giving me what I needed at 2 30am...without judgement. My teabagged dirty Mate was just what I was needing after downing 3 beers earlier and the orange choc chip took the edge off of pulling a literal  all nighter .   I loved that there is an eclectic hodge podge of seating options  from barstools  to an array of office chairs  to hightop tables  to couches that look like engorged beanbags of comfy quicksand  and the people to match. I honestly think this place is the best overall demographic representation of the city of Austin I have ever seen encompassed in a single space    The wifi is free  there is a one purchase minimum  but c mon  you seriously gonna freeload in a place that has the equivalent of 101 flavored latte options  .  Should I ever endeavor on another early morning flight where painstaking awakeness trumps trying to squeeze in a two-hour power nap  this will be my go to    So happy I discovered this lil gem 
Bennu Coffee,78,I love pride and prejudice so naturally I had to get the pride and prejudice mocha. Coincidentally I d brought Emma to read. I don t usually get mochas  I prefer lattes  but it was really good  I would personally prefer more coffee flavor and less overwhelming chocolate but it was a mocha  after all. The barista gave me the option of whipped cream on top.  It is a bit dimmer than I like  but maybe because I was reading. I guess it would be okay if you re working on a laptop. There was plenty of seating and outlets. There are tables and also couches.   It was relatively empty when I went because school was out by then. I would come back to either study or meet up with friends.
Bennu Coffee,79,This is one of my favorite coffee shop to study at  It usually gets really crowded in the evening but you can always somehow find seats  if you re okay with sharing table  They have great selection of mocha - whether you love milk  white  or dark chocolate. My personal favorite is the Scarlet Letter  If you get hungry  they also have pastries  sandwiches  and pizza. My favorite is the Gamboa pizza. It s super good especially on a day of late night studying.  Suggestion   -If you re coming here to study  it usually gets crowded around 7PM so parking is hard to find but you can find street parking in the neighborhood across from the coffee shop.  Local Finds   -Right across the street from the coffee shop is also the famous  You re My Butter Half  mural of Austin  Look no further this is where it is located   
Bennu Coffee,80,This place came in clutch when finding a coffee house on the fly. I kept seeing pics and suggestions about the Iced Bennu  and it did not disappoint. I m pretty sure I could ve drank 2 of those. It really hit the nail on the head with the light sweetness  not to overbearing  but smooth tasting coffee with a punch.
Bennu Coffee,81,Wow. Amazing location  amazing service. Love the refills option.   The high chairs are my fave.
Bennu Coffee,82,I come to Bennu semi regularly because it s a great spot to get some work done close to my house.  This cafe is usually super crowded. It s full of UT students and remote workers reading or typing away on their laptops.   The traditional espresso based coffees  cappuccinos  macchiatos  aren t great  which is why I m only giving three stars. Coffee is important in a cafe  But Bennu serves an impressive range of hot and cold speciality coffees  sweet  sugary concoctions that are sure to give you an energy boost.   The food here is better than other study cafes in the neighborhood. Pizza from East side pies is available by the slice  along with big and tasty tacos from TacoMex  sandwiches and pastries.
Bennu Coffee,83,Such a great place to study. can be pretty loud because of coffee machines and due to the plethora of people that are usually there. It s a tad crowded and the outlets are super loose but I love this place. Parking is a pain and if you get unlucky someone may park behind your car  but I asked the barista to make an announcement and he so kindly helped me. Drinks are good too 
Bennu Coffee,84,I ve been here a few times now as per the suggestion of others and haven t seen much improvement  parking is hairy  every single time the staff is rude  there isn t a place to sit because so many students are camped out  and my latte is burnt. If you re looking for a quiet place to work or have a meeting with some decently made coffee  this unfortunately isn t it 
Bennu Coffee,85,Great coffee shop with lots of Austin flavor. The baristas were really friendly. This is a great spot to chill and grab a cup of Joe.
Bennu Coffee,86,I just went to the highland location this morning  it was amazing  The manager and staff are so kind and super friendly  I ordered the pull apart muffin and one of the mochas that was suggested when I asked what the best drink is  I am so excited to watch this coffee shop grow  and I am looking forward to the many visits I will be coming back to you in the future 
Bennu Coffee,87,No one in a really cool place like this is here to listen to modern hip hop about clubbing and fucking. Intelligent people are here to meet  focus  or work. We re not on dirty 6th.
Bennu Coffee,88,So this place is on MLK across from united way building. Which is where I was headed but needed a caff pick up. So I stopped here. First impression  which door so I go in. I m In and wow this place is well decorated from first glance. Someone took time in this. Then I get to the counter and ask  what s good. I gave a suggestion  she suggested as well and we met in the middle. I paid. Wait  I didn t even say what size I wanted. Confused. 60 seconds later I have my Bennu ice coffee. Mostly ice but no worries  it s hot out. I go get a straw and lid placed neatly in an armoire.  Then I look for a seat as a lady ask who s cell phone is this. So the ppl here are honest. The music I must say is very calming and pro 90 s. Love it. Kinda slow and sad tho but I like it. They have this coin vault atm  no ide whyyyyyy  I find a seat and notice not one chair or table matches. Hah Then my seat literally has an extension cord hanging behind my head. What the heck  lol. Then I notice the menu painted on a mirror. This place is getting weird. I quickly sip my drink  yum and head out. Glad I stopped.
Bennu Coffee,89,I got an Iced Vanilla Latte here and it was tasty  It wasn t as creamy as some other places I ve been too  and the espresso is stronger  I can literally feel myself getting caffeinated . There s also a LOT of tables  which is a plus for study spaces  but even though this place is 24 hours  the shop isn t well lit so it s pretty dark after sunset. There wasn t much of a coffee shop vibe either. I d come again during the day to study and try some more of the coffees.
Bennu Coffee,90,Been here a few times in the past few months and everything about it is mediocre. The staff is always hit or miss on friendliness. Very convenient in the fact that it is open 24 hours so if you aren t super into coffee then it s not a bad choice for a go to spot. Lots and lots of options  I don t know that I have ever seen a coffee shops with so many options whether food  coffee drinks  non coffee drinks  etc. Definitely unique but can be a bit overwhelming for sure. Did a coffee tour around Austin a few months back with some friends and gave them a 5 10 rating after trying a latte  capp  cortado  and a shot. Not super clean and don t count on the printer working because it s usually out of order even though it is a great concept. If you are in at night count on their being at least a couple homeless people in the shop. Parking is free which is nice but I personally have witnessed a couple of accidents due to the size of the lot.
Bennu Coffee,91,Fairly nice sized coffee shop in east austin.  This is my 2nd ever coffee shop to visit here  but the best thus far.  The interior is pretty welcoming and has many tables  chairs and couches to choose from.  Electrical drop cords hang from the ceiling so you don t have to sit along the walls to power your devices.  I chose the iced coconut mocha raven and a cinnamon roll to snack on while I was waiting for the Franklin s line to shorten.  This was a perfect start to the day.  I d come back again if I was ever in the area.
Bennu Coffee,92,Q  Uhhhh  how much could I love this place   A  Enough that half of Austin does  too. It s 8 30PM  and this place almost looks like a night club on Saturday. Except there is room to navigate between seats and tables.  1. Famous for  4-5 mochas. Get one. I m crying that I can t finish the other half  but I ll never be able to sleep if I do      trashy first world problem.  2. Street parking abundant. 3. Tons of communal work spaces  work counters  and individual squashy seats. 4. 24 7 for all of your late night study needs.  Low key and perfect for the Austin repertoire.
Bennu Coffee,93,This locally owned business is open 24 7- Best part. The flavor s are amazing. My favorite drink is their latte  the espresso is rich with some nice flavor as well.I love their coffee better than Starbucks   They have maintained their quality unlike these big chain businesses.I usually stop by here in the mornings  on the way to my work to pick up my to-go.Any time of the day-night you drop in and they are busy.   The cafe also serves up some decent food fare though i haven t tried any ever   they have a nice selection of flavors for your coffee or Tea and other cafe treats as well. The ambiance is very casual  very comfortable and Yes of course Free WiFi    They have both inside and outside sitting and a great private parking lot.
Bennu Coffee,94,I was very impressed with this coffee shop. Very friendly staff  creative menu  beautiful space. They had a lot of food options and seating areas. I saw a lot of students studying or others doing work on their laptops. The outdoor area was spacious and well decorated. I ordered the Pride  amp  Prejudice with Almond Milk  and my husband got a Cold Brew. They are open 24 7  Definitely give it a try  or swing by to get some work done. Very awesome establishment 
Bennu Coffee,95,Quirky and cool coffee shop   Think mismatched tables and chairs. And cord extensions hanging from the ceiling.  We tried the Bennu iced coffee on a whim  and let me tell ya  it was so good  It s a sweet pecan-flavored iced coffee.  You can t distinctly taste pecans though.. It s similar to hazelnut iced coffee.  I like how they use  soft ice  instead of normal ice cubes  and the small size was at least a Starbucks s grande.  I think it s awesome that they re opened 24 7  I m envious and hope coffee shops in Dallas do the same  Extra plus  The infamous  You re my butter half  wall art sign is just across the street 
Bennu Coffee,96,Heard a lot about Bennu and was told this was the place to go on my hunt for good coffee in Austin.  Went in mid afternoon on a Saturday.  Short line but most of the tables were full.  While I waited heard the barista making some snide remarks about people and their coffee order  attitude  etc.  Almost turned around and left.  I 100  get dealing with the public sucks and am all for good humor  sarcasm  and wit.  Might be saying she went a little too far..  Finally my turn and was a bit apprehensive that I would say do something to turn the wrath on me.    Ordered the Iced Bennu which was worth every sugary calorie in it.  Also ordered a piece of banana bread which was great.  Found a place to sit and watched the show as people.   Great coffee.  Great atmosphere.  Will I be back   Pretty sure the answer is yes.  Will just mind my P s and Q s if I do so that I don t get called out.
Bennu Coffee,97,Sooooooo Good   Open 24 hrs with the FRIENDLIEST staff and pretty good coffee   Definitely a go to study space  so it can be crowded  especially late at night. They also have pizza and specialty mochas  
Bennu Coffee,98,There is a reason this place is often packed.  Excellent coffee  very friendly baristas  great selection of baked goods from local bakers  e.g. Russell s  Cap City Bakery  vegan   and others   and lots of space to spread out.  I had a fantastic cold brew and a pumpkin muffin.  Looking forward to going back with a good book sometime and logging a few hours there.  Decent amount of parking  too.
Bennu Coffee,99,GREAT story about Bennu- once I was working late on a programming homework and I ordered  the Raven   specialty drink with dark chocolate I think   the caffeine wave hit so hard that my eyes felt like they were coming out of my head. I was able to finish my assignment no problem. Don t get me wrong it was delicious and I would order it again. Best selection of specialty drinks in Austin. Their italian soda is pretty good if you like sweet.  Great study  work atmosphere. Lots of office chairs as seating and outlets. The lights are dim most of the time so it stays dark. music selection is pretty good  food is eh
Bennu Coffee,100,literally such a nice place to study. Nate deserves a raise asap. Such a gr8 barista and person 13 out of 10   
Bennu Coffee,101,Bennu Coffee was not on my radar until I stopped by the  You re My Butter Half  Mural for a photo op with the hubs and saw it across the street. I m a local  but I bet this place gets tons of tourist foot traffic simply from being near that mural.  This is my type of coffee shop  in terms of atmosphere. I love the local art on the walls as well as the mismatched and worn tables and chairs--it gives the place a bohemian vibe. I d rather have well-worn  cozy chairs at a coffeeshop than ultra-modern furniture made of some sort of expensive teakwood and industrial-style metal that hurts my butt after 15 minutes. The place is pleasantly more spacious on the inside than it looks on the outside  which is great because so many coffeehouses these days are cramped. I saw lots of folks on their laptops.  Coffeewise  I will have to come back and try their coffee black or maybe order a simple latte to determine how much I like it. This place specializes in mochas  they have 7 different types    so I felt like that s what I needed to order. I ordered the Raven  their most popular drink  since I m a dark chocolate junkie. However  I forgot that I can t handle the sweetness of mochas like I used to  and I couldn t finish it. I recommend the mochas only if you have a serious sweet tooth. That said  I thought it was super clever that all their mochas have literary names  e.g.  Pride  amp  Prejudice  Don Quixote  Great Gatsby  etc.  I want to come back and try the French press  a cappuccino  or chai.
Bennu Coffee,102,This location is the original and never ever disappoints  Try the Don Quixote off their mocha menu. Bennu serves a warm smile and friendly convo at no charge with every cup. Thanks  dudes 
Bennu Coffee,103,Bennu Coffee serves up some delicious coffee and pastries  as well as having plenty of study sitting space for the social and college studying life  Iced coffee is always my favorite  and this place does it right  better than Starbucks for sure .  I like how this place is relatively close to campus  even though I live in West Campus   and it s  24 7  for all you night owl s out there... . The atmosphere is nice and homey  which helps to create a calm atmosphere for studying and socializing.   Now  I know a main concern about places like these is a lovely necessity called  power plugs . I can definitely say that there is plenty to go around to plug in all your electronic needs. They have cords you can pull from the ceiling  in the walls  extension cords and other accessible power plugs overall. So  you never have to worry about not having enough for your friends and family
Bennu Coffee,104,Homey feels with tasteful art  snacks and of course   coffee.   I ll come here usually only when I need to study and get out of the house. It s great because here  there is the furniture and feels of home but without the distractions.   The last time I was here was 4 25 17. It was hot outside. So of course I ordered the Iced Bennu- with easy ice. I usually order all of my drinks easy ice so that it dilutes the drink less over time. There is a great balance of sweetness and coffee.   The reason why this isn t a five star for me is because I don t get the feeling that it is AMAZING. It s close but not there yet.
Bennu Coffee,105,Very very slow wifi. Decent regular coffee. Good atmosphere for putting your nose in a book.
Bennu Coffee,106,I visited this establishment at around 8 00pm on a Sunday night  and it was packed with students studying. Though it was packed the ambiance inside it pretty quite around this time. My study group and I had to resort to going outside on the patio  and it was very nice  Keep in mind smoking is allowed outside on the patio.  I ordered the Pride and Prejudice  hot. If you like sweet drinks I definitely recommend this one    Overall great place  would visit again. Maybe on a day less packed.
Bennu Coffee,107,Atmosphere  5 stars with plenty of outlets hanging from the ceiling Blue Hawaiian iced tea  5 stars Cookie  1 star  dry and flavorless-- double chocolate chocolate chip  Friendliness  5 for the male cashier and barista  1 for the blond female barista  rude when announcing drinks and taking orders .   Nice location for meeting people and plenty of seats  though packed the entire time we were there . Not my first choice but also Not a bad one.
Bennu Coffee,108,I love the ambiance of this place. The prices can t be beat    It s only 1.25 for a bagel and large coffees are  2. The WiFi is free and the also have outdoor seating.
Bennu Coffee,109,We came here late at night because it was one of the only places open  but it ended up being such a good choice. The barista was friendly  and the coffee ended up being so good. I got the great gatsby  highly recommend   and my friend got the Raven. Both had a good coffee taste and extremely smooth  delicious  The barista also informed us that the whipped cream is made in house  definitely a plus. Life really is too short to drink bad coffee     Definitely coming back for seconds.
Bennu Coffee,110,Very good mochas  Got the Pride and Prejudice with ice and it s by far the best mocha I ve ever had. Not a huge fan of mochas but since it s a house speciality  I guess I had to try it. And indeed  no regrets. Favorite part was when I drank all the liquid and all that was left was ice lathered in creamy homemade whip cream. The ice was like the sonic so that was exciting. They also had an alright selection of snacks so if one gets hungry  there are options. Also  the staff is friendly and turnover rate is quick.   The atmosphere of the place is more of a studying place. Lots of college students busy with school work. Plugs are everywhere. Dim lights. There s some conversations in the background but not too much of a distraction. Music is soft. If you need a coffee place around campus to study at  I highly recommend this place. However  seems to be a popular place so you might have a difficultly finding a seat at first. We had to share a table then moved to the counter. Oh  seats are the comfiest.
Bennu Coffee,111,Visiting Austin Texas from Reno Nevada and was very impressed with bennu coffee  Everyone told me to try breakfast tacos while in Texas  and bennu had some good ones  I also enjoyed my  Oliver twist  coffee. Delicious and a good vibe.
Bennu Coffee,112,Bennu Coffee- where do I begin  Bennu is a godsend to the students of UT. Not only does Bennu offer an extensive selection of delicious mocha flavors  but the size of the mochas are very generous. Everything that I have tried on the menu has been more than satisfactory.  Aside from the never-disappointing coffee  Bennu has the atmosphere of your weird great aunt s sitting room- meaning  it s mysteriously cozy and adept with power outlets for an extended study visit with your laptop. Stay for an hour or all night  Bennu is open and giving great service 24 hours a day.
Bennu Coffee,113,Meh. Baristas were too busy joking around to get my order right  coffee wasn t great  honestly a weird environment. Plenty of other good places in the area.
Bennu Coffee,114,Headed to Starbucks  Re-route and do yourself a solid. 3 locations. But. THIS. NEW. Place. IS. A-mazing  Spacious. Safe. LONG Hours. And then there is THE COFFEE. All the Bennu s specialty coffees ROCK. Iced is my personal fave. Mochas my second. Pastries  Pizza--yes Pizza --yummies are all locally sourced. And they deliver  I use it. It is safe  contactless  and I got Gallons of my favorite for when I don t feel like masking up. You may not know it  but Bennu has a long history in the coffee biz  from Mojos  to Epoch  to Chameleon Cold Brew. As an original Ruta Mayan  I know coffee. This is Austin coffee par excellence  bar none. Bennu is this coffee lovers go to. Shop local.
Bennu Coffee,115,Stopped by for a drink and a snack before heading out to explore around East Austin. This was a solid coffee shop and seems like it would be really good for studying working as there are lots of outlets available  even a printer   and plenty of space to spread out and work. I had an iced green tea and a slice of pizza and my boyfriend had a redeye coffee. Overall a decent place to get fueled for adventures but I m giving it 4 stars because it probably has the least exciting atmosphere of anywhere I went in Austin.
Bennu Coffee,116,The coffee here is amazing  My friends and I stopped by after taking multiple pictures at the  You re my Butter Half  mural across the street. The place is big and spacious in addition to the great coffee choices. The staff took interest that we were in town for a bachelorette party and gave our bride-to-be a free iced coffee bennu as a congratulatory gift  The female cashier was really friendly  sweet  and patient as we bombarded her with questions on the different options. Overall  I would recommend this place for those who want a quick treat and great iced coffee.
Bennu Coffee,117,I have been enjoying this company for 3 years now  The iced Bennu is my favorite coffee in Austin  the owners are amazing humans and the baristas are always friendly and helpful  I like that they use local businesses to sell food products  5 stars 
Bennu Coffee,118,Such a staple  Seriously they are open 24 7  Wh would write a bad review. It is so convenient for everyone and students. I love the coffee and love coming in to study and do work.
Bennu Coffee,119,This is the place to go if you are looking for a place to do long hour studying work. It s definitely an ideal study spot for college students.  Bennu is opened 24 7  has a lot of outlets and tables  and even offers printing service.  There is a variety of food and drinks you can choose from the menu. I heard mochas are great here. I tried out a slice of pepperoni pizza  and it was delicious    Parking lot is pretty huge compared to other East Austin coffeeshops.   I didn t really like how the ceilings are low and the place overall is dark. Also  the place doesn t seem that tidy and clean. A dead fly from the ceiling just fell on my plate - it was really gross. The floor seems to be pretty dirty as well.  Other than the cleanliness  Bennu is an ideal place for long hour studying work. Don t forget to check out the infamous You re My Butter Half wall across the street 
Bennu Coffee,120,Great mochas  You can t go wrong with the Pride and Prejudice. The vibe is cool but if you really need reliable wi-fi this might not fit the bill since the WiFi is slow spotty. If you have a hot spot or are not WiFi reliant then awesome study spot 
Bennu Coffee,121,First time to Bennu Coffee...I enjoy the atmosphere of this coffee shop as it was comfy  chilled  quiet and welcoming. Plenty of seating availableeI had heard great things about the migas breakfast taco  but unfortunately they were out of it by 9am. I ended up ordering a latte  the bacon egg and cheese breakfast taco and a gluten free banana walnut muffin. The latte was of good value in my opinion  good taste and generous size .  I was a bit disappointed in the breakfast taco as it was really greasy.. I would return to study  but probably not to eat again.
Bennu Coffee,122,The place is a good coffee place to study  but they left themselves a tip from me when I didn t sign the total. That s just plain rude and unethical. I am not coming back here ever again  what a shame.
Bennu Coffee,123,This is a great and reliable cafe. With 24-7 hours  it s always open  which is easy. Also  the space is large with lots of seating and comfortable chairs. The WiFi works well and they have a large drink menu with lots of options if you re dairy free or have any allergies. They also have some prepackaged food options. Very casual  artsy vibe  I am a big fan 
Bennu Coffee,124,I ve never had a problem at other locations  but the employees at this location are so rude. I asked for an iced coffee and it took them 15 minutes to bring it out. Due to Covid  they only let you go inside if you have purchased something  and it was raining outside. I told them I was simply waiting on my purchase and just wanted to check the interior out  but they wouldn t let me go in.. making me wait in the cold and rain. To make matters worse  after I waited for so long they got my order wrong. And when I tried telling them that I asked for a iced drink  not hot  they were giving me dirty looks and just grabbed the drink hastily and went back inside  no apology or anything. The iced drink was hastily brought out a minute later  and it was evident that they didn t make it properly. Super disappointed because I ve been a long term customer of bennu s  but the hostility I was met with at this location makes me not want to go back ever.
Bennu Coffee,125,Today s first visit to the MLK location was on a Saturday afternoon  amp  certainly tea time was definitely in order before jumping into an oasis of children at the nearby Thinkery.  Weather definitely called for a nice hot drink.  Parking is pretty tight  so compact car parking preferably.  Plenty of bicycle parking though.  I ordered a London Fog  hubby ordered the house Bennu dark roast  and my son ordered the Arnold Palmer.  The Palmer was pretty tart so I wouldn t recommend it unless you prefer it that way.  My London Fog was good   tea leaves were a loose leaf variety. Husband said coffee was strong but not bitter which I suppose is a PASS in our book. It s labyrinth-like inside  dimly lit corners  and a fully packed cafe with students plugged in to extension cords hanging down from the ceiling. It s walk-up  amp  order style of service  very much the same as a Starbucks operation. Some snacks  pastry  or cookies
Bennu Coffee,126,Beggars can t be choosers.   I used to hate Bennu... a lot.   I m not a fan of their house blend - I can t quite put my finger on it but it s like a sour  burnt  interesting taste and hadn t been a fan of a lot of their drinks. When I went to UT  I would come here to do some last minute cramming so really  I took what I could. It was always crammed with other students that were trying to do the same so the atmosphere  menu  and space just wasn t one that I loved at all.   HOWEVER  I decided to give it another shot this past weekend. Originally  I was looking for a 24 7 print shop for some lease information that I had to finalize  with only 6 days left between my current lease expiring and that one starting   and Bennu totally came to my rescue. They have a printer service where you send your request to an email address  link your PayPal account and can pay to print. Out of all places  I would have never imagined that the one place I loathed in college would be the one that came to my rescue. While I waited for my printing documents to be able to scan in  for all those who aren t aware CamScanner is a perfect resource for taking pictures of documents - turning them into PDF documents - and emailing them out  I ordered a vanilla cortado and it was actually REALLY good and much cheaper than any other I ve had in town. To top it off  the young lady behind the counter was playing some upbeat African music which really made me feel right at home  as my family is from East Africa and it s rare to hear establishments play the music  and I ended up staying a bit longer to slowly sip on my drink and people watch for a bit. This place has totally turned it around for me and is a perfect example of why I should be open to giving establishments another chance. I d say this was a solid 9 10 experience 
Bennu Coffee,127,5 stars for the atmosphere. It is what you d expect  a dimly lit  cozy location full of power outlets and old  comfy couches. Local Austin bands play on the speakers  and there s a well-lit bar if you d rather a brighter atmosphere.  2 stars for the cappuccino. It was like milked coffee with a dollop of foam on top--far from the micro-foam smoothness  iconic of a good cappuccino. Admittedly  most of my recent cappuccinos in Austin have been like this  I m not sure if it s a trend now to steam the milk hard at the top and spoon the overdone milk bubbles over as a finisher  but I hope it dies.  5 stars for the breve latte. This contrasted so much with the cappuccino. I d recommend this if you re looking for a good micro-foam.
Bennu Coffee,128,Great little location to get your study mode on. Of course it being 24 7 is what makes this the place to go. The only issue is that it fills up very quickly and gets pretty crowded. Parking is also very limited. But hey if you manage to find a spot  you re all good. They have a nice selection of pastries as well as sandwiches and pizza.  They have vegan options as well   As far as drinks go  I usually get the Don Quixote or regular hot chocolate with a warm muffin.
Bennu Coffee,129,I placed in order with door dash and then I was told by the dasher that they couldn t order because it was for me and not him  and then I ordered through favor and got the same answer. Money is money. I can t get the order myself which is why I ordered to be delivered.
Bennu Coffee,130,open 24 7  wow  Staff was very friendly and helpful- I ordered a cappucino and a migas taco and it was a solid way to start my day. I didn t get the flavored mochas or anything  but they sounded delicious  Free wifi and charging stations made this place seem like a default coffeeshop for the area. would recommend for a charge-up of java or your phone
Bennu Coffee,131,The coffee at Bennu is just ok. Honestly other than their  specialty  mochas I would give the coffee a 2 star rating. The mochas have some nice creativity and unique flavors that balance out the mediocre coffee.  The main thing that brings Bennu up  however  is the environment and setup of the space. This is a place for college students to study. You walk in any time of day and you are immediately reminded of this. They have tried to cram as many seats in as possible while still not feeling completely overcrowded  it does feel crowded most nights I go but not horific . They keep the temperature a little too cool - probably keeps the coffee flowing and also helps people concentrate not sleep at 3 am. It really is one of the better places around Austin for a extremely late night study working session. Also note  they have power outlets all over   But do be weary  the seats are beat up with abuse and are not preemptively replaced. Not that they are unsafe  but they are old and not super comfortable.  The parking lot is kinda a mess  which is typical for Austin  but the neighborhoods in the area have quite a bit of parking and are generally filled with students so generally reasonably safe to walk from your car even late at night.  Last plus is that they serve food that is brought in from places including pizza slices that they will heat up. There are some decent baked goodies  including vegan and gluten free options.  Overall Bennu is a great place to study or work  and I can stomach a mocha while I am working. Unfortunately  the outdated seating and coffee quality in general kinda brings the place down.
Bennu Coffee,132,Bennu is my favorite place to relax and study. Been coming here since I was a student and still come often. I can t say much about the food or drinks  I only ever get the Texas gold tea when I come here  but I love this place because of the atmosphere. It s open during the late nights and although it gets crowded it s still my number one favorite cafe in Austin. I ve had many late night conversations and  memories here and hope this place stays for a long time.
Bennu Coffee,133,Bennu is a perfect place to hunker down and get some work done at any time of day or night. The coffee is hands down some of the best in town. It s strong  smooth  and flavorful. There s ample seating and lots of outlets. It s cool  calm  and dark inside.  The snacks food are pretty decent too. Sometimes on the weekend during the school year it can get absolutely packed with UT students  and it might be hard to find a seat. Sometimes the baristas are friendly  and sometimes they re short  however  the quick service and high quality brews remain constant.
Bennu Coffee,134,Love this place  been coming for a few years now. Great coffee shop to grab a seat and get some work done. I m a cold drink person so there are always great cold brew options  today I m having the Pecan Larry. It s ace. Wish I found it sooner.
Bennu Coffee,135,Great coffee  great midnight baristas  great music they hand select like their beans  great vibe 24 hours a day.  Buy a  50 gift card and save them 30 cents on your  3 credit card transaction.  Drink and reload.
Bennu Coffee,136,When I walked in I thought  yes   This place has exactly the vibe I love in a coffee shop.   I ordered an Italian cappuccino  a great drink to test a barista s skills . The first signs were good  the barista did NOT ask what size  I became more optimistic. After pulling the shots the barista filled my cup about halfway with steamed milk then stopped and using a spoon scooped out a couple of giant golf ball sized spoons of foam and plopped it on top. NO. Why    OK  give it a chance I though. Check the taste... Unfortunately the espresso was extremely bitter. Very disappointing.   Management  Get that espresso machine dialed in so it s not so bitter. Hire a good top notch barista that can train everyone. You ve got a great spot and great equipment  but you need someone with skills. Good espresso should be smooth and wonderful.
Bennu Coffee,137,Good wifi  Pretty quiet and great for studying or working. Tables are a little haphazardly placed  some awkward maneuvering is needed sometimes to get by.  I got the Scarlet Letter which was nicely spiced  and my favorite part was that it wasn t blazing hot so I could start drinking it after less than a minute. Cajun turkey sandwich was basically turkey with jalapenos and a little bit of sauce  but I was hungry and it hit the spot. I also like how they toasted it.
Bennu Coffee,138,Love this place  When I m in this part of town I always make sure to stop by. The baristas are consistently kind and super quick with getting my coffee ready. The seating arrangement is funky and cute-- and I m always able to find a comfy spot to study.   The only downside for me is the parking. Depending on when you go  you may have a hard time finding a spot.  Thanks for keeping me efficiently caffeinated Bennu 
Bennu Coffee,139,I was in the area  and decided to Yelp the nearest cafe I could find to do some studying. After perusing search results  Bennu Coffee caught my eye due to the pictures of the inside- mood lighting  beautiful art and many nooks. However  my number one reason for writing this review  are the two baristas that provided memorable service  humorous banter  and great vibes. Not to mention a much needed piping hot espresso to drink on this rainy day in Austin. Be sure to stop in on Tuesday nights so these guys can show you a good time and a rich coffee selection. 10 10 recommend 
Bennu Coffee,140,My favorite place to study in Austin  TX  They are open 24 7 so it s the perfect spot for late night cram sessions. Other coffee shops start giving you  the look  when you overstay your welcome but everyone that comes to Bennu is there to get work done  so no judgement here  I do wish the music levels were a little lower considering most people are trying to concentrate but a small price to pay for a place with consistent customer service. Come early to snag a spot  it gets pretty busy around 8pm 
Bennu Coffee,141,Decent coffee . Lots of seating   One of my go to places.  Love that it s 24hrs.  They keep the AC too low like many coffee shops.  I have to keep a change of clothing in my car.  I m freezing in the shop but sweating as soon as I walk outside 
Bennu Coffee,142,Love this place   I ordered the Iced Bennu and it is sooo good. I didn t have any issues with parking and I can about 9am on a Saturday morning. This place is really great for studying or meeting up. Also the  Butter Half  mural is across the street so I had to check that out as well after meeting up with a friend. Great service  great drinks and great price.  Not too expensive unlike a lot of other places I ve tried. Plus it s local  I ll be back for my next caffeine fix here. The iced Bennu is strong and the large is a decent size as well. It s pre made the night before like a cold brew so it s all caffeine.
Bennu Coffee,143,Great coffee shop that s open 24 7. It can get pretty crowded but there s indoor and outdoor seating. They have great drinks and also some snacks for sandwiches. They have rotating art for sale that s pretty cool. The staff is friendly and helpful and will customize a drink however you want it
Bennu Coffee,144,To me  this is the best coffee in the city for one reason   The meerkat. Just order it  put a tiny bit of sugar in it  and coffee will never be the same. They take their cold-brew coffee and steam it with any milk you want. It takes away all of the acidity that the regular brew has  and what you are left with is the smoothest  tastiest cup of coffee you have ever had. The atmosphere in the joint is crazy. All walks of life. All types of personalities and people.  Its a microcosm of Austin. I have fun every time I go AND its open 24 hrs.
Bennu Coffee,145,Good drinks with creative names. I have mixed feeling about this place. I m not a fan of this mismatched tables and chairs and I know a lot of my friends complain about this too. Sometimes the table will be high and the chair would be super low so you re basically typing with your hands in front of your face. It seems like they just went to garage sales or a thrift store and bought a bunch of tables and chairs and a few couches and randomly placed  it in the building. It also has a dirty feel to it but I m sure it s just because the tables and chairs are old. It s dark and a little cluttered but it does have a certain charm to it.   It s 24 hours which is nice  Sometimes it s hard to find a table but it s a great feeling when you do. If you ever need a break  definitely check out the  you re my butter half  wall across the street 
Bennu Coffee,146,The coffee at Bennu is nothing spectacular. I would never try their regular coffee - it is pretty awful. I do like their spin on their Mochas for the flavors  but even those are never that great.   Their baked goods and food offerings get a subpar rating for quality and freshness  The staff can also be a bit dry and unfriendly at times - watch out for a couple of the divas that work there.   I feel the reason for the high rating on Yelp is mostly because it is open 24 7  which is a big plus for college students.   I am not fond of their mix and match furniture. It is old  quirky and pretty beat up with no indication that it will be replaced anytime soon.  If you are seeking a place to sit comfortably as you drink you coffee - it won t be here.  Parking quickly become a disaster. Very limited parking and locating a parking spot on the street can also become a challenge on some days.
Bennu Coffee,147,Good bean. Great atmosphere. From out of town and servers put up with our blank stares and still helped.
Bennu Coffee,148,Good coffee place. Their Arnold Palmer is good and their caprice sandwich is good too. I love how low key and simple it is compared to Starbucks. I love the oddly mismatched chairs it makes it  The only thing not a fan of for this or the one on Congress is the parking...and maybe the need for some more outlets. This one on MLK has awesome outlets from the ceiling  That s genius   So I say come here for nice place for great coffee and other treats
Bennu Coffee,149,Great vibe  interesting decor  very good coffee  comfy furniture  and quiet. All-around solid experience.
Bennu Coffee,150,Good coffee   very comfortable to work. Good prices   also snacks and tacos are available when your working and can t take a break to eat . All around a great environment with really good internet speeds and plenty of power plugs for phones and laptops.
Bennu Coffee,151,While the food and atmosphere is great  Bennie is constantly crowded at all times of the day. As a student who wants to study  it makes the getting started to study part much harder than it already is. That being said  their food is great  their coffee strong and their employees  fantastic. It s a definitely a place I would wanna return to.
Bennu Coffee,152,Love this place. Great place to get work done  a lot of outlets to work with  coffee is good. Customer service is fantastic as well.  Only knock on it is that the internet can run really slow  I mean it can be slow to the point that checking an email can take up to 5-10 minutes. Cough up an extra  100 month to get that speed up 
Bennu Coffee,153,There s only so much work you can get done at home when you share an  office  with a furry  cuddly distraction. Sometimes you have to get away and cut the proverbial leash. With Bennu in my corner  and around the corner  I have a full-time office away from home  but still close to home.   The 24 7 aspect of Bennu lures in the tired grad students and undergrads of the UT campus nearby  but since there is tons of seating and plenty of indoor and outdoor space  it never feels too crowded. This place is not for the uptight  minimalistic  or claustrophobic  because the interior is decorated in Austin-chic. Cluttered  dark  vintage and charming.   They have good coffee  too. I always get the house  but they also have a dark roast. Coffee isn t the only thing they serve up though  they also sell pizza from Hoboken  Bagels  sandwiches  and tacos in the morning. Once they even created a Topo Chico mocktail as an ode to the late  Prince.   Whether you work from home  or have to do homework  Bennu is the right place to go. Grab an office chair  a cup of coffee  and werk  werk  werk  werk  werk.   P.S - to the barista who plays 90s country music  I enjoy every minute up until one of your coworkers inevitably shuts it off 
Bennu Coffee,154,Mediocre Coffee Shop  Study Space From Hell  Seriously it was so dark and there were no spots to sit and the wifi was slow and the shitty pop music there gave me a headache. I get the appeal for students... but like... I don t think I ll ever be that desperate
Bennu Coffee,155,I ve been a regular customer at this location for about 2 years already and it s usually my go-too mainly for the 24hr service they provide which as a university student is holy Grail.   Great study place  plenty of outlets  plenty of beverage choices. I m a barista as well and I highly appreciate when other baristas take the time to make the beverage according to standard of the recipe which makes a hugeeee difference. I love love loveeeeeeee coming to bennu when two certain individuals work their shift because they make absolutely delicious drinks with the same consistency everytime. I m too shy to show my appreciation for those two or ask for names so I couldn t tell you but they re both male one has a deep voice and the other usually works the graveyard shift  he s super nice  amp  friendly .   The reason I can t give this place 5 stars is minor but I still felt it needed to be in the review. My favorite drink is a from the mocha menu so it gets extra things such as toppings and syrup. A drink from the mocha menu is typically  5 including tax and optional tip due to the extra ingredients and it s upsetting with the lack of consistency of making sure the drink is made with all ingredients is crucial to a paying customer of a  5 drink. Unless I order when my two preferred baristas are working  the barista I order from will always forget or deny something included in the recipe. Many many times I ve received my beverage with just whip or ice that fills the whole cup.   Please don t think this is an unessesary review because of missing syrup  amp  too much ice but if the drink is  5 please just make sure that all baristas re-train or don t deny something that is missing in my beverage that I paid for especially since it says on their menu exactly what s included.   Again  the negatives are really minor and based on personal experiences but you should definitely try some iced espresso drinks from the mocha menu 
Bennu Coffee,156,I ve been here several times to pull an infamous allnighter before an exam...lol. But every single time  their coffee is super   You must try their mochas  my favorites are Don Quixote and Oliver Twist  If not  their coffee selection is perfect  amp  always tastes so good and definitely gives you a surge of energy. I opt for a simple cappuccino with a pump of hazelnut and it s perfect for me.  They serve pizza with unique flavors and so far I ve loved them. Haven t ventured to the desserts yet but I know that they are amazing from reading other review on here.   Only reason I docked a star is because it s not easy to find a seat  amp  can get super busy loud really fast  not their fault  though  tbh . If you ask nicely  they can turn the music down for you 
Bennu Coffee,157,This is pretty much the exact conversation I have every time I go to Bennu    Putting my cup on the counter   Let s fill this with original.   That ll be sixty-two cents for the refill.   It s actually not a refill. It s my cup.   Thanks for being honest.  1.62    Twenty minutes later  putting my cup along with a dollar on the counter   This time it is a refill.   Don t worry about the sixty-two cents.   Thanks. Let s fill up the tip jar.   Bennu is 24 7  it s usually crowded  and sometimes parking  amp  seating can be inconvenient. But if decent coffee and hanging out late night at an Austin icon were easy  everyone would be doing it. They aren t. Some are. We should.
Bennu Coffee,158,The cranberry scone was good  a bit dry. The latte was delicious- had a great head on it  very rich. The cold brew with coconut milk was fantastic. The migas taco was tasty but salsa would have helped. Independent neighborhood shop. Lots of students with computers. Avg age approximately 22.
Bennu Coffee,159,We had an early drive and so came to this coffee shop since it was one of the few places that were open at 6am. I had an americano while my friends had the milk-based coffees. We all thought that the coffee tasted weak. Guess it s a good place to be at if you need coffee at an odd hour  or just looking for a place to chill with WiFi. Otherwise  you re better off getting a cuppa elsewhere.
Bennu Coffee,160,Back in the day  there was Mojos.  Then Mojos died  Long Live Mojos.  Then there was Epoch.  And Epoch is fine  but every college student and their slacker significant other is there.  And now there s Bennu.  I had to have lunch in the area  so I popped by Bennu - I knew it was  somehow  associated with Mojos  which is always a plus in my book.  Other reviews are right - lots of outlets  lots of comfy couches  and - of course - other seating if you don t want a couch.  I had an cold brew coffee  and evidently they package and sell it under the  Chameleon  brand  which is also pretty spiffy.  Basically  it s exactly what I want when I m working in a coffeeshoppe - someplace low key with tasty drinks and people who leave me alone.  To the people for whom it matters  it has a 30.07 sign.  Oh  also a plus - they were selling the  Bananas Foster Wallace   which was some kind of dessert.  But I m an Infinite Jest nerd  and a DFW fan in general  so brownie points for the literary geek shoutout.
Bennu Coffee,161,Update  I ve been going to Bennu since they opened way back when  and all of my original review below remains true. I can also say without a doubt that while the entire staff is excellent  Neil  Fred  and River are among the best baristas I ve ever had the pleasure to have behind any counter anywhere when I m indulging my caffeine addiction.        Original Review        Check it out   Great drinks  a cool space  friendly baristas  imagine that    and open 24 7.  You re going to love Bennu  my friends.  LOVE IT   Be sure to give their signature mochas a try.  The Raven and the Don Quixote rawk  and  though I ve yet to try the other five  I m sure they re good too.  This one is a definite winner  founded by folks with ties to other well-loved Austin coffee joints  dearly departed Mojos and ultra cool Epoch  to be specific  who know their stuff.  There s good food on the menu  Pizza from Hoboken  breakfast tacos from Tochy s  baked goods from Russell s  to help soak up all that caffeine  too.  Get out of that chain gang and into Bennu.  After all  this is Austin you re living in  not Dallas or Houston.
Bennu Coffee,162,This is hands down the BEST coffee shop in Austin  I literally come here every day and every day my life is better for it. The staff is a dream team of baristas who care so much for what they do you can taste it. Nucky kills it with the menu and Charlie and Neil provide soles galore and the beat music for all hours of the day  creating a perfect ambiance to go with the eclectic stylings of the interior. Not a single chair is the same and the art that fluctuates is equally engaging.   I LOVE this place with all my heart.
Bennu Coffee,163,meant to write this a week ago  but was debating if I wanted to or not cause I really felt embarrassed. coffee is great  yum. variety is just perfect. 4 and a half stars for that. however  I will be finding a different coffee shop the next time im in town. I was almost stared down by the people here and just felt unwelcomed. had a mask on  didn t have toilet paper hanging from my jeans  etc.
Bennu Coffee,164,This place is the closest coffee place to my daughter s new middle school. I ordered an ice latter and it was pretty decent. It s not as good as the place I normally frequent for coffee  but it s much better than Starbucks.   I could get used to going here whenever I have to drop off my daughter to her middle school.
Bennu Coffee,165,This is such a great spot -24 7- for iced coffee  hot chocolate  internet  pizza  tacos  sweets  and respectfully communing with fellow students or professionals. I also feel very at home in this kind of scene  cafe meets retro dive  AND Bennu supports local artists  they rotate the wall displays regularly showcasing various artists works.  This is the ONLY place in town with this much heart  
Bennu Coffee,166,I come here for the herbal teas  as I drink zero caffeine  and the vegan cookies they get from Happy Vegan Baker. The studying atmosphere is great  and they have outlets at most tables to plug in laptops. I really appreciate that there is a separate room that has a complete studying atmosphere that s pretty quiet  compared to the rest of the coffeehouse that is full of talking people.   The teas are great  I ve gotten the hibiscus one  and the Oblong tea lately  both great  and the chocolate chip vegan gluten free cookie tastes like cake- in a cookie. I love that. If you don t have a car  the 803 bus will stop two blocks away. Great atmosphere  good options for veggies  very hipster yet cozy  and cheap to get there. What more do you need  Strongly recommend. They gave me a punch card and I am planning to go back to keep adding stars to it 
Bennu Coffee,167,Great chai latte and a great atmosphere. The baristas were pretty rude. I loved the place and the drinks but probably won t be back because of the rude customer service.
Bennu Coffee,168,Quick stop here to meet up with someone and had the house coffee.  I didn t have time to enjoy it but it was good in my opinion and reasonably priced.
Bennu Coffee,169,When I think of Bennu  I imagine the hipster best friend of your sister who is utterly reliable but a tad zany. She is utterly reliable for advice 24 7 as are the hours of this coffee shop  but wonderfully random and chaotic  which is the decorations and furnishings.   Bennu has ample space with numerous tables and a multitude of outlets  hanging from the ceiling and coming out of the walls. The lighting can be dark if you are not seated directly beneath one of the dim light fixtures.  Coffee is moderately priced with numerous offerings. The french press is a great deal if you order the larger pot and drink it insidiously throughout your long hours of studying. The iced bennu is one of my favorites. It has a great hazelnut flavor and is pretty sweet. I love that they use pulverized mini ice instead of large blocks in their iced coffee. Just adds something to the experience. The latte is pretty typical and safe to order if you are unsure. If you are trying to save  order the affordable americano.   They also offer a variety of sweets and pastries catered by different restaurants. The carrot cake is very decadent and quite tasty.   Parking can stink if you don t arrive in time to nab one of the front offerings. However there are many roadsides you can choose from to test out your parallel skills.
Bennu Coffee,170,Without hesitation  I have no problem driving from San Antonio to Austin just to study at Bennu Coffee...that is how much I love this coffee shop.    The idea that this coffee shop is open 24 hours massively appeals to me.  I have an abnormal sleep schedule  and having a coffee shop accessible when I want it is amazing to me.  Two downsides  parking and seating.  These two things are the reasons why they didn t get five stars from me.  Parking is very limited and the entrance is steep  causing me to always scratch the bottom of my bumper.  If you go during peak hours  there will be zero seats.   Other than these two items  their prices for their drinks and food are cheap.    If there is one thing that will make San Antonio better  a 24 7 coffee shop is a MUST.  I can t wait until I visit Bennu again.
Bennu Coffee,171,I LOVE THIS COFFE SHOP. 24 7 anytime i need a caffeine pick me up this is my go to place. Good prices better flavor AWSOME new artwork but where they really shine is the staff. I would like to take this opportunity to compliment their overnight weekend girl. Ari is hands down the coolest Barista i have ever met. Every time I have asked her to surprise me with a drink she never fails to impress. Her friendly smile is outright infectious.
Bennu Coffee,172,Great coffee shop. Every time I ve been in here it s been very busy no matter the time of day so a downside is definitely that there is often no seats or tables available but usually one opens up after a few minutes. They are open 24 7 which is so convenient. The crowd is often college kids. Despite being crowded Bennu is usually quiet so it is a great place to work. They also have many outlets hanging around for you to charge up at. Their lattes are wonderful and staff is friendly.
Bennu Coffee,173,I was trying to get south so that I can make a meeting. There was so much traffic that I knew I wouldn t make it... so a quick google later  I found this place. There s a small parking lot. I was lucky enough to snag a spot in the front    I saw a peek of their patio area and it looks really nice  it has a lot of shade. However I was in a rush so I had to get in  buy myself a drink and find a spot   On the door entrance  there is a sign that there is a one drink minimum. Makes me a little sad that they had to post this up b c I bet people some and just hang out and not support the business.....  So  I have a caffeine sensitivity so drinking coffee teas after noon for me is bad bad bad. Good thing thing they have a selection of non - coffee drinks also  I did ask about the Iced Bennu and it s coffee with condensed milk  what I got from the explanation  and it sounds like something I would LOVE. Just not right then. I selected the Lime  amp  Punishment  What a name  Topochico with limeade       I added cherry flavoring to it. It was yum    Also saw signs for pizza... and smelled it but I did not partake. The music selection was not horrible. There was noise but it was still okay for me to work study without any headphones.   The atmosphere is very trendy hipster but I didn t feel out-of-place.    It was still a friendly-ish spot and I think the baristas made that happen. I didn t realized they were 24 hrs    I can t wait until the next time I m stuck in traffic around that area so I can make a detour.    Maybe I will try out the pizza also. It smells so good when they made it for others.
Bennu Coffee,174,Great vibe. Chill music. Good volume. Not too loud. Great variety of sandwiches  pizza and cupcakes  Forget about it. Points for lots of vegan options. Their 24 hour brew is solid and the seating is pretty fucking comfortable. I could stay here all day.
Bennu Coffee,175,This is the best coffee house I have ever been to in Austin. It would have gotten 5 stars had they put a time limit on hogging tables in the establishment. The coffee and food is fantastic and the iced bennu to die for  but its quite annoying when you cant ever do anything but get your coffee to go because college students will hog one large table per person for hours on end. Forcing no other patrons to ever be able to sit down and enjoy the ambiance. Might want to put a time cap on that Bennu  otherwise you totally rock  
Bennu Coffee,176,The scarlet letter is my fav  Chocolate and chili powder...mmmmmm  Great selection of local  de caffeinated teas for non-coffee drinkers.  We love to come here to study
Bennu Coffee,177,I ve been here twice  both times I made very reasonable requests to the staff and both times was treated like a nuisance. I once specifically asked the barista making my drink to make my drink kid s temperature  but it was still too hot for me. I then asked them to give me some ice cubes since they didn t follow my original request  but they denied my request and instead put whole milk into my drink. Mind you  my drink was made with oat milk because I am lactose intolerant  rendering my drink unconsumable. I will not be returning to this specific location of Bennu simply because of the staff s intolerance of their customer s needs.
Bennu Coffee,178,I m a big fan of coffee and tea. We were in Austin for F1 and it just happened to fall on a weekend where we had hurricane like weather the entire time that we were there. Bennu Coffee was located across the street from a mural that I had wanted to see during our stay and we decided to get some drinks to keep warm in the cold. Bennu Coffee is one of the bigger cafes I ve seen in a long time. It is outlets paradise making it an ideal place for students to get some work done. I had initially intended on ordering tea but once I saw that they had a specialty mocha menu named after famous pieces of literature  I had to order one of them.   We ordered the Pride and Prejudice  Blend of Sweet Chocolate Powder and Sauce topped with home-made whipped cream and dusted with chocolate powder  and a Sweet Chai Latte  sweet vs spicy . Now I m not a fan of Chai and this was no exception. I found the chai flavor a bit too overwhelming. If this was their sweet version  I can t imagine how intense their spicy version is. To be fair  my boyfriend said he liked it and he s a pretty avid drinker of chai lattes.  I was really hoping to enjoy my mocha but it fell short for me as well. I could barely taste the coffee because of the overwhelming chocolate flavor. I understand that it was a mocha that I ordered but that shouldn t mean that you drown the coffee flavor out entirely. It was a bit of a disappointment for me since it cost me over  4 and I barely drank half of it.   The barista was very friendly and answered any questions we had about the drinks we ordered. I really wanted to love this cafe because I m all about supporting local businesses but their coffee just didn t do it for me. Think I ll pass  2 5
Bennu Coffee,179,This is my favorite coffee shop to study in  I used to go here occasionally back when they had more cushioned couches and more of a standard  coffee shop feel . I was pleasantly surprised when I went back to see that they took all the comforts out to set up tables and plugs scattered about  which makes for a very nice place to go solely for study groups. Not recommended for people looking to simple socialize  as the place takes on the vibe of a literary at times.  The coffee and people here are both really nice.
Bennu Coffee,180,I ve had The Raven iced and hot. Prefer Iced for that one  get a bit more for your money.   Their traditional chais are delicious   Ambiance is quiet  laid back. Great study place.  Gluten free options limited  but lemon poppy seed cake is great 
Bennu Coffee,181,The ambiance of the room is great  as well as the taste of the coffee. However this place needs some serious guest service and sanitary training. Every single barista here with the exception of one guy was either rude  slow  or unpleasant to deal with. Two of the girls behind the counter did not wash their hands after touching their hair faces and eating. The girl who was eating the taco behind the counter snapped at me for not having cash to pay for a refill  they have a  2 tab minimum   even after I suggested I could put my friends  coffee on my card and pay for the refill then  or just not get the refill at all. Despite a very long line  one barista was very slow to move around  one continued stocking a pastry case while staring at customers  and the other ate a taco right behind the counter. This left one young man to run around trying to get everything together by himself. He was exceptionally nice  apologized for the wait  and was the best part of my visit. I will likely not be back unless I hear the staffing and cleanliness issues are addressed.
Bennu Coffee,182,A star off because the Baristas here spend a lot of time talking badly about each other and their customers - which can be kind of funny  but unprofessional. Beyond that  Bennu is my go to open-late  ridiculously cozy  higher quality food  study friendly coffee shop. Anyone at UT will likely find people they know when they come here.
Bennu Coffee,183,At first sip  I loved Bennu. But then I returned a second and third time and the love faded. Maybe I ve changed. Maybe you ve changed. Maybe you re just the same and I m seeing you as you always were  as I didn t see you the first time.  Pros -Good coffee -Comfy seating  Cons -People abuse the wifi by watching Netflix here. -The lighting is almost too dark to read in many places. -It s usually crowded on weekends  limiting the seating options.   Perhaps we can still be friends 
Bennu Coffee,184,An Austin classic  open 24 7  with friendly service and a wide variety of food and beverage offerings. My location  East side  MLK  offers tacos from Taco-Mex  the best local taco stand  and pizza from East Side Pies  delicious local pizzeria . However  all food including pastries is available in limited quantities  so get it before it s gone  Bennu is the kind of place you can stay at all night cramming for an exam  finishing a last-minute work project  or  if you re like me  sit outside smoking and writing  catching some sun and sipping on a robust americano served in a craft mug  people watching and enjoying a nice day out. Inside  the environment is focused and organic  no two chairs are alike  some of the tables may be a touch wobbly  but Bennu s aesthetic is original and inviting. Check it out 
Bennu Coffee,185,I have had the coffee here a few times. Staff is friendly and it is a good place to get some work done or just hangout.
Bennu Coffee,186,At the beginning of my study session everything was great. Then they started with their loud music. Coffee houses generally are where places people come to study and drink coffee. How can you study when the music is loud enough where if you are wearing noise canceling headphones you can still hear the loud music. It s very distracting and not a good thing. This was my first experience and will be my last at this coffee house.
Bennu Coffee,187,I ve only been here a few times  but my fiancee held a study group in this coffee shop and the staff are nothing short of amazingly kind. Great iced coffee  plenty of options  plenty of plugs for laptops  plenty of comfy seating for studying napping.
Bennu Coffee,188,The coffee was so delicious and affordable. I loved the atmosphere so much more than the one I visited the day before. Felt more homey and relaxed. Loved it 
Bennu Coffee,189,As much as I love love love Bennu  I have to be honest  the coffee here is pretty mediocre.  If you re looking for a place to sit and chill for a few hours at weird hours in the night this is definitely the place to go.  The ambience here is what makes me think of this place when I m not in Austin and what makes me want to come back here at 1am on a Saturday when I just want to chill.  As long as they aren t blasting Britney Spears at 2am this place seems to always be filled with people and is a great place to get work done.  the lighting on the inside and the outdoor patio is dimly lit but there is still plenty of light to get your work done. There s plenty of seating inside for groups or to just work alone.  This place is non pretentious and not intimidating at all which is probably why I love it so much. the baristas are great-friendly and charismatic and always seem to help you with more than what you are asking for. If I went to UT or a neighboring school I would no doubt be in here all day.
Bennu Coffee,190,ily Bennu So many good late night talks here with friends w  coffee and the Hoboken za is a       
Bennu Coffee,191,I live in San Antonio and came here for breakfast early morning one weekend when I was staying in Austin  and OMG. I still dream to this day of the blueberry cream cheese danish that I had  along with my latte. Next time I m in Austin I m making it a point to swing by   Also  that danish has left me disappointed with every other coffee joint I visits. This place was the bomb
Bennu Coffee,192,Bennu is my go-to coffee shop. My favorite things about it are the hours  open 24 hours   the chill and relaxed vibe  and the friendly staff. The drinks are very fairly priced. My go-to is an iced coffee  cheap refills    sometimes with a pastry. Breakfast tacos  pizza  and pastries are all delicious. Great spot to get work done  meet a friend  etc.
Bennu Coffee,193,One of my favorite coffee shops in Austin. I like Mozart s for socializing  Spiderhouse for drinks  La Tazza Fresca for summer studying and Bennu for after hours   They have solid coffee and a wonderful staff.
Bennu Coffee,194,I ll keep it short- not so sweet.  Just about any coffee shop that is open 24 7 has only the one perk. - convenience.  Props for having local Vegan treats aka junk food. Ain t mad at cha. I m starting to question whether the first place I should scope out are the bathrooms- then decide If I consume a product from the establishment.  Firstly- my own personal jackazzery option- any coffee shop that only has  syrups  to add flavor to your brew- a total waste of time. And basically tells you their commitment to  let s go with an overly exaggerated -  excellence   Mind you- I d not still be sitting here keeping my dear friend company had I first thought    go check out the porta- john that s been sitting on the side of the road for days  eeewwww.  The extent to my visit. One house coffee. Which later had me stomach in a nightmarish uproar. sour on sour on revolting pain. Neva ever again.  I think you need a penicillin shot- after just considering to walk in that door.   Cute mugs..I do like a place that uses all completely random- eclectic drink vessels.   They don t take a name. They simply call out what you ordered.  Release the hounds for everyone who ordered a... Amusing little signs around the place. I did not tap. I wouldn t want to disturb the parasitic pastries behind the protective layer of filth- you call glass.    I d rather not sit in the alley a dump truck frequents for trash in a mug  solicitors  all the free  that being a variable word- free  internet  amp  electricity for any one moment in a 7 day period.
Bennu Coffee,195,Supper quiet.  No joke  seriously quiet. Lost of space  and most importantly it was warm   Not freezing like most coffee places.  Coffee was great too 
Bennu Coffee,196,Came here for the first time and really enjoyed my visit  The parking lot was completely full  but I managed to find parking along the small road adjacent to the coffee shop  parallel but not metered parking    Bennu has both outside and inside seating  and when I visited  around 4pm   there were a lot of people. I really like that there is a big seating area with all types of chair-table placements. even with all of the people already there  I was able to easily find a place to sit.   Two things that I like about Bennu is that there are plenty of outlets and music without lyrics. The lighting is pretty dim  but areas next to Windows should bear enough light for those who prefer brighter areas.    Their iced mochas were delicious but slightly expensive in my opinion   4  . I tried The Raven and Oliver Twist mochas  which were both so good  I also tried their cheese Danish  which was not that fresh  but I m assuming it was because we came in middle of the day. Although not warm and fresh  I was satisfied. It was a good snack  especially paired with the ice mocha.  I was really relaxed and had a great time here  I ll definitely be back for more drinks and perhaps to study 
Bennu Coffee,197,The baristas are friendly and helpful. They truly love their craft and it s evident in their delicious brews  LOVE this funky place  
Bennu Coffee,198,Try their vegan pizza   As a 24-hour coffee shop  it can be crowded as lot of students come for studying especially in the evening. I do love the vibe of the coffee shop and friendly baristas. They have gluten free desserts and I was surprised when I tasted their vegan pizza  it was delicious.
Bennu Coffee,199,The coffee is consistently good. My daughter loves getting hot chocolate  that they don t make too hot for little mouths  and pretending she is drinking coffee with me. They are always super nice and even if the line is long  they keep things moving so you don t have to wait too long.
Bennu Coffee,200,If only they had more parking spaces  this place would be rated much higher. I ve been here a couple of times  and the problem is that if you drive here  the parking is so limited so it usually forces me to go to other places.  This place does have great coffee. It also has a good selection of desserts  actual food  etc. It can sometimes get loud  but it s usually okay. They have a good number of spots where you aren t cozying up with others. Good place to study  unless you can t work well when it s dim inside. Love that it s open at all hours.
Bennu Coffee,201,Bennu reached out to me to fix the problem. I m really happy with the customer service and will continue to be a customer 
Bennu Coffee,202,On the rare occasions I can find parking here  when ISN T parking an issue in Austin though   I love cozying up at one of the large and comfy tables to work for a few hours and get out of the house. The intimate  cozy vibe  and prominent outlets   make it easy to work or study from this cafe.  Otherwise  the 15 minute parking spots are usually unoccupied and great to stop by for a quick coffee or flavored drink on the go. For the most part their sugary specialty drinks are tasty and fun--love the themed mochas and seasonal specials  The customer service is touch and go but usually the person at the register is friendly and kind. My main problem when ordering has been attention to detail  I ve definitely asked for almond milk and received dairy milk in lattes a few times  and friendliness from the baristas themselves.   Overall I always go back and it s a neighborhood favorite for a quick stop or a few hours away from my home office 
Bennu Coffee,203,I ve been recently doing a job located a block away from Bennu Coffee so I go there everyday for my coffee.  I m a avid coffee drinker and consider myself a expert when it comes to coffee.  Bennu Coffee is if not the best coffee shop in Austin it s in my top two. Right with Spider House.  Not only is the coffee good but the staff are ALWAYS upbeat and friendly. Even at 5 00 a m when I come in sometimes.   Excellent coffee shop       Only  mustard  would be the parking can get congested. But this is Austin.  All the good spots have parking issues. Ha  
Bennu Coffee,204,the customer service here is ass. they pressure you to tip even though there s no reason to. the charge more for no ice in a cold drink. the quality of the drink is mediocre. going to call the manager later
Bennu Coffee,205,I m not a fan of Bennu. There s never a place to park or a place to sit. I always go back to give it another try  and it s always a miss. Every time I ve gone  the baristas weren t the friendliest people. You don t have to hold a full on conversation with me  but it d be nice to have my politeness reciprocated. The music is also very distracting here. I always find it difficult to focus on my work or get studying done.
Bennu Coffee,206,They always forget to make my order and refund they make you feel unwelcome Same people that morning shift
Bennu Coffee,207,Bennu is a 24hr coffee shop. Dim lighting. Old eclectic furniture - variety of chairs  couches  bar stools. Chill  relaxed vibe. Friendly service. Standard hot cold coffee options available along with specialty drinks. Vegan and gluten-free pastries.  Great iced coffee - small  16 oz.  for  2.75 with the option for refills. Uses crushed ice. If you order for here  they put it in a glass. Took my refill to-go.   Great atmosphere. Good quality for fair prices. Definitely would return for my coffee fix.
Bennu Coffee,208,Great staff and drinks  fun place to go study late at night. Can be a little dark and sometimes not able to get a table late at night. Overall  would recommend
Bennu Coffee,209,Love this place  It s down the street from where I live so I frequent this location. The service is always friendly and their drinks are always so good. You can tell they are handcrafted and take care in making them. It can get very crowded when school is in session because UT is really close.
Bennu Coffee,210,This is my go to coffee shop in Austin  Not only is it 24 hours which is awesome for students but they have amazing drinks  I ve tried the Pride and Prejudice  Oliver Twist  and Great Gatsby and they re all sooo good. You can t go wrong with anything you order from here. They also have tons of electrical outlets which is a plus  I love not having to search for outlets when I m busy working. Definitely a must try. Also  they re located right across the street from the You re My Butter Half mural   
Bennu Coffee,211,Bennu is a good place to get work done. There are lots of tables  chairs  and outlets. Like a lot of other local coffee shops  they do require a 1 drink purchase minimum.   I had no problems with the barista. Service was friendly and prompt.  As far as coffee goes  it s not incredibly impressive. I got a house brew with heavy cream. It was very very strong  nothing out of the ordinary for a coffee shop.   I will say that around finals  early-mid December  early-mid May  this place is PACKED with studying students. Definitely not a fault of the establishment itself  but just something to remember 
Bennu Coffee,212,One my favorite late night study spots in Austin.  There are a lot of people working late into the night at the same time an easy way to escape the boredom on campus locations.
Bennu Coffee,213,This place is definitely my favorite coffee shop so far  Everything I ve had here has been delicious and the service is outstanding  The seating is comfortable and the atmosphere nice. I have no complaints whatsoever.
Bennu Coffee,214,Came here at 7am on a weekend. Servers were very friendly and helpful with tips for kid friendly activities in the neighborhood. Comfortable and laid back decor and chill music. Coffee  cake and tacos tasty. Place feels like a Starbucks might if it were actually a community meeting place.
Bennu Coffee,215,I love this place  The coffee is so yummy and I love their unique creations  I also love the chill atmosphere and the baristas.
Bennu Coffee,216,Bennu is great  It s a dark atmosphere with lots of electric outlets for students and freelancers. Mostly  though  I go because the baristas are super nice and create a friendly atmosphere.   This morning Ami was taking orders and knuckles was making them. Knuckles said  do you want full caffeine  Oh  I want decaf  I said. Ya  you don t drink much caffeine  so I thought I d ask. Then I noticed that she anticipated the orders of everyone else in line.   The other barista that really seems to affect the tone of the place is charlie. And then there s the woman with the super cool glasses that told me to go to gene optical. ...just trying to spread the kudos... there is no bennu barista I don t like. Y all are awesome     litsa
Bennu Coffee,217,This review is a long time coming. Plus tons of stars for being the most creative coffee shop in austin  having commmmfy sofas and tons of outlets and seating spots. I wrote 3 plays here  wasted tons of time in between east side meetings or came early in the morning when no where else was open.   Only con- Sometimes it gets a bit too noisy   its usually super peaceful  so when this happens its a bit jarring.  Also they have the best french press decaf coffee- incredibly delicious  So when they are out of it  nothing else will suffice.
Bennu Coffee,218,Stopped by here after visiting the  You re my butter half  mural. Very quiet and studious coffee shop with tons of UT Austin students   outlets. Solid hot cocoa.     2 minimum on credit cards
Bennu Coffee,219,Coffee food  The coffee is REALLY delicious. I like the dirty chai. They have breakfast  tacos that are up to par with other breakfast tacos in Austin.   Environment  I enjoy the environment here. It is quiet and really great for studying so long as you are on a computer. Not really a place for large groups that are chatty or for young children. There are hanging plugs throughout the shop so you can plug in your computers and electronics. It s not ideal for studying from a textbook or reading in general unless you are sitting near a window or at a couch with a lamp.t is pretty dark inside. The music varies  but tends to be upbeat jazzy during the day. I like how quiet it is.
Bennu Coffee,220,Between Bennu   Epoch for 24 hr coffee houses  Bennu wins. They have more seating and variety. BUT if I can t get seating at the bar  I don t come here. The majority of their mismatched furniture just isn t comfy in my op.  Coffee   food is REALLY well priced - once stayed here for 8 straight hours  had 4 different house coffee refills and a sandwich and my bill at the end was only  11. Their house roasts can be a little bitter  but they make a mean iced chai and have a great selection of teas.   I know a few people who have never been to Bennu mistake it for a coffee shop you can also socialize it  so let me clarify - na. You come here to hunker down and get to work. Environment is mostly students from the surrounding UT area.   Baristas are relatively friendly and will remember you which is always nice. Music is terrible though - TERRIBLE - so don t forget your headphones.
Bennu Coffee,221,3-stars means A-OK  2-stars means Meh. I ve experienced better. I had both of these thoughts  but the standard in Austin is unusually high and has spoiled me. If the only other options were Starbucks or Dunkin  that being the case where I grew up  Bennu would be my top choice  but I consistently choose Thunderbird over them  which I love-hate at 3.5-4 stars  so this rating feels mean but right.   Pros Drinks Badass baristas Collaboration with local restaurants and food companies  Community board outside the bathrooms Bike parking  Cons Density of seating Dimness  Open 24 hours  -because- Cleanliness and zombies
Bennu Coffee,222,Feeling sort of punny today - sorry if this review is a latte to handle.  The BIEN-nu     Their Bennu Coffee Mocha Menu is perfect for those nights where you need a cocktail of sugar  amp  caffeine to keep you running. They re wonderfully decadent and the flavors are super...novel. Turn down the white  amp  dark chocolate sugar explosion of the Great Gatsby  You...Scott to be kidding me. The Oliver Twist  You better have some Great Expectations for this caramel  amp  chocolate medley of deliciousness.  amp  I am not Dicken s  around with you.    It s open 24 hours. Perfect for those around-the-clock study sessions or those pre-exam grinds  if you enjoy being surrounded  literally  surrounded  because this place gets packed  by panic and desperation and sweat and the impending doom of approaching deadlines - but hey  that s how some people roll.    The location is big  with plenty of tables and chairs and couches and stools and large tables and small tables and counters and outlets and plugs. Plenty of people sitting in them and working on them and using them  too  but like I said  it s a great place for those who need to be surrounded by productive people to be productive.  The Ben-NO-NO     Mostly atmosphere complaints  but  in my world  this means the universe  HA   too crowded  bad music   amp  too dark. True story  I remember reading my textbook  probably with my iPhone flashlight  and then jamming out to Avril Lavigne and then I was like  wait a second  stop it Avril  I m trying to study and you re making it Complicated  actually  it was Sk8r Boi . If you re doing work solely on your computer and you ve got your headphones in - basically  if you are a computer science major  working with...java  -  you ll be solid. But if you re going to read a textbook or take notes  you ll be blind and also maybe a little unsettled by the music.    It s not very clean and the furniture looks like it just won a really difficult fight - it s sort of like studying in your grandma s attic  which is cool  I guess. Actually  I appreciate the mismatched  old  worn-out furniture  attic look - I just don t particularly like studying in it. Also  I don t like how some of the extension cords hang from the ceiling - I know this can t really be helped since so much space to cover and so many people  but it just bothers me  especially when so many cords are dangling so close to my being.  Anyway  this isn t my choice study spot unless I really  really  really have to get down to business and get myself to feel a sense of panic  Which I guess is often.  Honestly  I probably should have gone tonight...   TL DR For those people who communicate in metaphors  Bennu is that unpleasant and sort of depressing person in class you talk to only when you need something. I don t really know how to end this review  so I will just mocha-up another bad pun.
Bennu Coffee,223,Cozy coffee shop  a great place to knock out some work. For breakfast you can get a taco or choose from some pastries. The coffee is affordable and can be taken Togo or in a glass mug to enjoy there.
Bennu Coffee,224,I ve spent many hours here over the years drinking coffee  eating cookies and sandwiches and working on whatever. Barista Aems and I tinkered with different Italian iced sodas earlier. Creamy blackberry with whipped cream and chocolate syrup was nice  but our prototype creamy watermelon with whipped cream and honey was pretty neat. It reminded me of. . . your lips and tongue and taste buds are thinking it s  like  a butter pecan milkshake or whatever  but then washing over and underneath and around and down your throat is this watermelon surprise. Next time we re thinking about cayenne and cucumber -- or I am  at least -- but also intriguing is maybe Irish cream or toffee nut with cinnamon powder. Anyway  definitely a fun way to punctuate the boring work of tonight.
Bennu Coffee,225,So I was driving around the east side looking for a cup of Joe. Not only did I find this place  but met Ari who was the most welcoming  kindest   and  funniest barista I ve ever met. Y all need more people like her  oh and the coffee was great too   
Bennu Coffee,226,Amazing location  vibe  and selection of beverages and bakery items  I d been meaning to come here while I was working within walking distance of the shop  but only made it here recently - loved the customer service  all the baristas were super friendly and clearly had close relationships with their regulars   I ve ordered their chai tea latte  daily dark roast coffee  and cinnamon raisin bagel w  cream cheese  all of which were delicious  Have yet to try their specialty drinks  Pride  amp  Prejudice  Don Quixote  etc.   but I d be happy with the drinks I ve already ordered from them. My friends also liked their breakfast tacos  vanilla lattes  and Italian sodas.  Plenty of space  amp  definitely a quieter  work-geared coffee shop w  lots of chargers hanging from the ceiling to ensure everyone has access to at least 1-3 chargers  which I really appreciated   Music is also a great mix  but generally very mellow and a perfect volume for working  or popping in your own headphones w o external music interfering with your jams  - will definitely become a regular here when I m in town 
Bennu Coffee,227,If you want to be served coffee by grungy pseudo hipsters with negative vibes  who treat your presence at the counter as an inconvenience come here in the morning on Sunday    Would give the place 5 stars for atmosphere and great gluten free baked goods if the baristas weren t hungover  self-absorbed  punks. 
Bennu Coffee,228,Love their espresso  I usually get an Americano and it s always good. The staff is friendly and welcoming. And it s 24 hours which is perfect and ensures I can get coffee before an early morning shift 
Bennu Coffee,229,One of my favorite places to work  especially with it being 24 7. Being right down the university  however only accessible by car   it is conveniently located to get away from the mass of students. I very much so enjoy the Iced Bennu here  being a fan of hazelnut. The ice is also soft and can be enjoyed as a crunch as you sip. The big downside for me was the wifi though  which is understandable consider the amount of client  but wifi is generally essential for most work or studying nowadays. I would really wish for better connectivity  either by upgrading tiers for speed  hosting a secondary wifi or limiting high traffic users.
Bennu Coffee,230,I love this coffee shop  The Great Gatsby mocha with handmade whipped cream - delicious 
Bennu Coffee,231,Bennu is my favorite coffee shop by far in Austin.  They re house coffee is great  as well as their more specialized drinks.  The baristas are fun and always down to chat  and don t forget to try the harvest bread  or any of the food they sell.  Delicious and great atmosphere 
Bennu Coffee,232,What Bennu coffee is good for  their  4 -  5 mochas.  What Bennu coffee is not good for  late night black coffee.   Bennu s is a 24-hour coffee shop close to UT campus. Because of that  it s always packed with people on nights you happen to want to study most. Parking is a pain to deal with on nights days like this--you can find parking in the neighborhood  but even then  it can be a little difficult.   Lighting is super dim  the ambiance is quite nice  and decorum is really hipster-ish  that s the best way for me to describe it . If you want to study  there are usually tons of outlets and tons of seats  albeit kind of low and a little uncomfortable for studying here and there . Wi-fi is a little jank--it goes on and off  and you usually know when it s about to shut off on you because everything gets SUPER slow....  The service is super friendly  The baristas are great to deal with  which is saying something because many baristas at other coffee shops can be pretty aloof and rude. I ve never had a bad experience with service before.   Their mochas are relatively sweet  but not too sweet that I can t drink it. They re good hot and cold and worth every penny     If I go for just a cup of iced coffee or hot coffee during the day  it s pretty decent. Not amazing or bad--just pretty subpar. TBH  an iced vanilla latte is way better than a hot vanilla latte. Having it hot tasted like drinking hot  super sweet vanilla milk. With a hint of coffee. Blegh  too much sugar for me.  On another note  I can t say the same for late night coffee. When I study at 2 in the morning  I like a good cup of hot coffee to keep me going  so I usually buy a large coffee mug and keep the tab open. However  my late night experiences have always given me not-so-hot coffee that tastes like it s almost watered down  like you ve literally just extracted the last bits of the day s coffee . It never really keeps me up awake nor does it taste that good.   All in all  Bennu s has some pretty mediocre coffee. I think it s great because it s open so late  the problem mainly lies in getting coffee to keep me awake and finding a spot to study   and the mochas are good.   However  if I m going solely for a good cup of coffee  I wouldn t choose Bennu as my first pick.
Bennu Coffee,233,I ve been here to study because it is a nice escape to be off campus. The coffee is surprisingly very good  however  the place is rather crowded so if you plan on studying here  you should come early to claim a good spot.
Bennu Coffee,234,The coffee is excellent and I suppose that s where you have to start.  However  the reason I love this place is because of the people.  I moved to the neighborhood about a month ago and I m on a first name basis with almost all of the staff and morning regulars.  It s like Cheers but with coffee.    If you want to support good people operating a good business in the community than this is the place you should frequent.  If you want to get to know your neighbors  then stop by.  I certainly appreciate Bennu.  Peace and love  ALWAYS. - B
Bennu Coffee,235,I am something of a coffee connoisseur  and I ve been all over Austin in search of the best coffee experience. Time and again  I come back to Bennu. It is my go-to coffee shop.  What to love  great food options  nice atmosphere  lots of outlets for working  but also great for sitting and chatting. Lots of friendly staff.  But  Knuckles is the best goddamn barista in Austin. She gives great advice on what to try  and makes brilliant concoctions of her own. Highly recommended.
Bennu Coffee,236,Downsides to this place are faulty wifi and loud music. They are always blasting distracting music  sometimes screamo  and it doesn t make sense why they would play it that loud if everyone is here to study and focus    When it s busy  my wifi almost never works and if it does  it s incredibly slow.  Other than that  I enjoy the coffee and appreciate the outlet availability. It s usually very busy  but you can t really avoid that being a coffee shop near campus.
Bennu Coffee,237,Great cup of java. Low on the parking spaces. This place is packed. Very Centralized. Free WiFi. Outside seating.
Bennu Coffee,238,East Austin is rapidly becoming a land of opportunity and adventure for me.  Dropped into Bennu coffee for some free wifi and a snack.  Walking in the open  friendly space was a revelation.    Vibrant art on the walls  mismatched furniture  laptops up everywhere and some hoboken pie on tap.  I grabbed a slice  thinnest slice of pizza ever -- in a foldable good way   a lime and punishment with cherry flavoring and got to working. Wireless only dropped once  guy behind the counter was totally sweet and folks just kind of worked and kept to themselves.  This is a great coffee shop  bigger than most and more interesting than most. Just as a note  that bottle of white parmesan looking stuff is sugar  don t make the same mistake I did  and bring your headphones  because the music is coffee shop terrible.
Bennu Coffee,239,I had some time to burn waiting on my daughter to take a test. I m not familiar with the area so I googled and found this place to hang out nearby. It is so inviting  there s friendly faces  plenty of seating  and the hot chai...AMAZING  Definitely recommend.
Bennu Coffee,240,Five star for opening 24 hours. Three stars for the mediocre drinks. I give it four on average. The cafe itself is chic  but the beverages though  failed our expectations. One of us ordered a hot chocolate and when it was served  it was almost cold. I ordered a Gatsby mocha and it tasted like just sugar and nothing else.
Bennu Coffee,241,What a nice little gem I ran into by accident.  And here I thought Epoch was the only 24 hour coffee place open.  Hells no   I wish I had found this place sooner  but I guess  they say  it s better late than never     My friend Mr. Imbiss told me about Bennu  how it s hopping on the weekends and some weeknights.  The parking lot fills up and it sustains.  The weather was so pleasant on this Sunday evening and I wanted a pick-me-up w  some free wi-fi  so what better place than Bennu     It s really clean here - that s awesome.  And plenty of seating to choose from  the couches are clean and well kept.  Some nice deco art on the walls  plenty of outlets  and I just love the soft roller chairs with wheels   A big bonus for me - comfy seating.    I got the Mocha Frappe with half the chocolate syrup  don t like it too sweet  and that totally hit the spot.  I had to try the chocolate chip banana nut muffin for  2.50 which rocked as well.  The customer service was quick and very courteous.    My new late night coffee hangout fo-sho   I dig the ambiance  I dig the Mocha frapp  I dig the plethora of soft chairs w  wheels  and I dig the cleanliness 
Bennu Coffee,242,I m giving this place one star because the environment is terrible. I have never felt welcome here the employees have never been friendly and the coffee is mediocre in taste and price. Not worth it. Go literally anywhere else
Bennu Coffee,243,This place is a jewel  Very easy to concentrate and work here  or meet with friends  or have a private lesson. Very low key  great personnel  nice ambience. Coffee is not the best in town  but its decent  has got a great variety and all the rest of the advantages cover for it.
Bennu Coffee,244,I spent a morning here working from a laptop and it was pretty great. There are plenty of outlets  I easily found a seat  everyone there is friendly  and the vegan snacks were tasty. It was nice to have options for nutritious fare.  The only thing I could have enjoyed more was the coffee itself. My cappuccino was a little weak and generally lackluster.  I ll still be back 
Bennu Coffee,245,I stopped by bennu bc it was 6am and i needed to head out for a drive back to houston. my airbnb was closeby so it was perfect. i really didnt want gas station coffee and im happy this place could hook it up  6am and there were already 6  people inside - working and eating. i didnt have a good chance to look but they had a good handful of vegan treats from local bakeries like cookies and peanut butter cake. i got a coffee and a tea for the friend. it was cheap and a lifesaver for the drive. cool spot 
Bennu Coffee,246,This space is good for studying  because everyone is studying and that encourages you to study too  There is also an abundance of outlets   However  it s often packed  Lighting is really dim  and the seats can be too low for the tables depending where you re sitting. Another thing that I ve noticed is the music they play. Sometimes they play louder music and it can be hard to focus. Like there were people screeching in the music. I ve never heard such music before.  The pricing isn t too bad. Try the iced Bennu  It s pretty sweet  smooth  and super strong  Love it.
Bennu Coffee,247,The mochas - so  so delicious. The Scarlet Letter is the best one I ve had so far. The people there are friendly and there is plenty of seating. The sandwiches were pretty good too. There s a parking lot and street parking.
Bennu Coffee,248,I basically live in this place during semester  so I really have to love it. Good thing the coffee is good or I would be screwed  The Purple People Eater is a fucking godsend is you are looking for iced mate that actually tastes good and I m a huge fan of the french presses and straight up espresso. If you was something a little sweeter  go for the Serenity  I don t think it s on the menu  but it s basically a dirty chia with white chocolate in it. And it s named after the greatest ship of all time. What more could you ask for  I d get it based on the name alone. ... I m not sure what that says about me.  Shout out to Knucky who is just flat-out one of the most kick ass baristas ever  and Charley who is just awesome and always beyond pleasant to interact with. I am absolutely terrible because I am totally forgetting the name of my other favorite barista.... She just chopped her hair off into the asymmetrical pixie and wears the black rim glasses  I also know she really like juniper.... Anyways she is also awesome for the interaction and coffee and stuff. You people are amazing and humor deal with me pre-coffee. Thank you
Bennu Coffee,249,Bennu is awesome  but only if you can find somewhere to sit. I ve been a few times and always feel Hunger Games-esque when trying to find a decent spot. And picking the right chair is like Russian roulette - you either get the great cushioned seats at a table  or you sink into the awkward couches into coffeshop oblivion. Aside from the seating issue  the coffee and tea here is pretty good. For me  the best part is the Hoboken Pie pizza that they sell  make sure to try the Vegan slice . I alway go to study  and the atmosphere is generally chill. Most of the baristas I ve had were cool  too. The whole  open 24 hours  thing is also a big selling point for me. Now if they could just get rid of the weird mix of super dim super harsh lighting and turn down the weird indie screamo music...
Bennu Coffee,250,I only had the Raven  but it was really good  The staff was nice. It s a laid back atmosphere. I enjoyed that they didn t play  traditional  coffee bar music. It was more of a rock and roll feel  rather than just overly calm   relaxing  music. Usually the relaxing style just makes it boring to sit and have a coffee. I would definitely go back  Next time I will try the food and see if it deserves a full 5 star rating. Give them a try if you re in the area  
Bennu Coffee,251,LOVE this place and the concept. While in Austin this was my go to place for coffee. Their bananna bread  lemon poppy seed and harvest bread were yummy.
Bennu Coffee,252,Aems and Nadia show that teamwork is the way to run a business. I really appreciate that the baristas seem to be allowed a lot of creative freedom  because it shows in their work  The coconut milk latte I had was fantastic  great espresso and I love that they have coconut milk.   As always  excellent tunes    The only con is the creepy sign about a cash prize for the highest reviewed barista. I d prefer it if all the baristas were equally compensated 
Bennu Coffee,253,This is the place to go when you have a long night of studying. The decor just feels like a hodgepodge of random desks and chairs they ve found  which isn t a big deal. The draw of the coffee shop is being 24 7  but as I watch the sun rise in the morning  I ve noticed it s still a great place for coffee for the  grown ups  on the way to work. I only drink the drip coffee here  which is very consistent in taste and a decent price for brewed coffee. I m not much of a coffee connoisseur  but I do think it s pretty good coffee. I think it s a dark roast that s not too acidic  which is how I like it. Beware of the slow internet when it s crowded and the sometimes loud music playing.
Bennu Coffee,254,I feel like there are a dozen reasons to like Bennu  but I still have my guard up and he will have to do a few things to woo me. The internet is slow  which is a bummer because one of the main reasons why I go to coffee shops is to get work done. I know a lot of people love the atmosphere  but I m not a huge fan. All I see are laptop cords strung everywhere waiting to trip me.  I haven t had great experiences with the baristas yet. Maybe I haven t gone at the right times but the ones I ve encountered are a little aloof at best  and just not friendly like I expect most baristas to be. As a former barista myself  I have pretty high expectations.  Drink-wise  I ve had a watered down iced chai and an iced Don Quixote  basically a spicy mocha  and both were...underwhelming. And watered down. Maybe their hot drinks are better  I don t know.  Haven t tried any of the food or bakery items so can t comment on that.   Of course the 24-hour concept is great and the location is ideal for night owl college students  but knowing that it s going to be a challenge to find a seat after 8pm makes me hesitant to even go.   I will probably have to give it another chance  and hopefully my feelings for Bennu will grow on my next visit. But hey  I do like the chalk board in the bathroom.
Bennu Coffee,255,Nice place. Full of students. Open late with lots of coffee options. Baristas are fun and quirky. If I was younger I would come here more often because of the vibe and clean location with quality coffee options.
Bennu Coffee,256,I have a love hate relationship with Bennu. I love their mochas a whole lot  but the primary reason why I frequent there is because it s open all day  every day. Read  ideal hours for someone who procrastinates far too much. Therefore  going there generally meant I was pulling an all-nighter  so you can imagine how rough those nights were.  Their mochas are totally solid  The Raven  amp  Pride and Prejudice are some of my favorite coffee drinks ever   and the baristas are  in general  pleasant and nice. There is some pretty tasty food  particularly the Hoboken Pie pizzas. The furniture is all mismatched and worn-in  and extension cords hang from the ceilings  so there should be plenty of outlets for power users.  The music they play can be up in the air  though - sometimes they play classic 90s  other times alternative rock  other times... eclectic  music that I can t really describe  so it really depends on who is making the drinks that shift. I always listen to my own music when I work  though  so it never really bothered me that much.  Parking isn t too bad because you can just park on one of the side streets and walk over  but during peak hours  after dinner  really   finding a spot to sit at can be a massive hassle. Some of the seats are less than comfortable  too  so just keep that in mind when you decide to just settle for somewhere to sit. Wifi is consistent  but it periodically kicks you off if you ve been on for a while - no problem  just sign back on  and you re good to go.  For me  Bennu holds a special place in my heart because I ve spent a lot of time there  for better or worse . It can get crazy in there  but with great drinks and a good vibe to work in  it s definitely quintessential Austin.
Bennu Coffee,257,I love that this place is open when you need it to be. I got their rose tea. It was way too bland for me. But I tried my friends peach mango tea and it was really good. She did add like 80 pumps of the syrup though hahaaaa. But ya it s a cute place with nice outdoor seating. The wall mural thing across the street is a plus-- so cute 
Bennu Coffee,258,Great coffee shop  Tried one of their signature drinks- the Pride and Prejudice iced mocha and was not disappointed  Great cup of coffee. Good atmosphere to get some studying in as well.
Bennu Coffee,259,I like it here for the excellent coffee  wifi  and plenty of space to spread out and work. There is outdoor and indoor seating  and the hours are perfect for night owls such as myself.
Bennu Coffee,260,Great 24hr coffee shop   Great deserts  drinks  and friendly baristas. The pizza is good as well. I would recommend the Mexican hot chocolate. Wish the parking was a little larger because I the evening it s PACKED    But they can t help they are just that good a popular.
Bennu Coffee,261,Really wanted to like this spot given it s open 24 hours...but too many cons. Pros  the coffee is decent  the location is central and the noise level is relatively low. Otherwise - parking isn t the easiest  I had to skip coming here a few times because I couldn t find a spot. The middle portion of the coffee shop is a cluttered mess of tables and chairs that you have to seriously maneuver around to get to and from your seat. This is also one of the least clean coffee shops I ve ever been to  especially in that middle area of cluttered chairs and tables. That coupled with the dim lighting...and you really want to think twice before dropping something on the floor. I will say that I never had a problem with the internet and outlets were generally accessible. Maybe it s best to try one of its sister locations...or go to another spot all together.
Bennu Coffee,262,You strain your iced coffee through a crate  That s absolutely disgusting  amp  unsanitary. Wouldn t visit this place again.
Bennu Coffee,263,Aw  Bennu.  You re my boo.  Let s dance.
Bennu Coffee,264,The single best study spot in Austin. I made a Yelp account just for this. This place is the reason I made honor roll. Super delicious food  snacks and drinks  order a Don Quixote   staff are SO nice  the music and art are awesome  and there are big tables  fast free wifi and a million outlets.
Bennu Coffee,265,If you re coming here  amp  thinking of using the wi-fi  don t. It s absolutely terrible. The coffee will run you about  4 per cup. The environment is nice but it s usually pretty packed and they have a relatively small parking lot for the amount of space inside. The staff is nice and there s usually music playing but it s not too loud. The 3 stars are mainly for the lack of space and the poor wifi.
Bennu Coffee,266,Really  I gave a bad review. That was a long time ago. All is forgiven as time passes by. Everything is all well. Coffee and food is great. The fact you are open 24 hours is a plus.
Bennu Coffee,267,Easy-listening music. Cool vibe. Quality drinks. Great place to study and hang out.  Quintessentially  everything Austin is here at Bennu Coffee. Quirky paintings adorn the walls of this delicately  relaxed coffee shop.  Witty writings accompany each patron as they use the restroom.  Folk music plays in the background as customers study  talk amongst each other  and simply drink coffee.  If you want to go to a place that is charming  I would recommend Bennu Coffee.   Try the chai tea or The Great Gatsby. You won t regret it.
Bennu Coffee,268,Great hours  ambience  and location.  Terrible parking  annoying music  sometimes painful service.  It s one of my go-to places after hours or early in the morning when I need to get stuff done though.  Look out for the wifi refresh periods.  Usually every 4-6 hrs  the wifi network will require you to click through the logo page again.  This is painful when dealing with large files and serious work.  Sometimes the music is eclectically ridiculous.  Not everyone needs heavy metal at 3AM   I wish the baristas wouldn t spend so much time making small talk with the attractive customers...some of us have to close out our tabs and get going in a hurry.  Decent food drink options.  I wish they d sell energy drinks though 
Bennu Coffee,269,I LOVE THIS PLACE...  ...and I will 100  update this review when they fix this hilariously bad wifi.   Wifi drops every few minutes  takes minutes to reconnect Wifi is slow  but hey  no worries there Wifi is insecure      It makes me sad that I ve had to LEAVE Bennu and go to another cafe on some days so that I can work uninterrupted online. Such a bummer.   Love the art Love the coffee Love the staff Love 24-hour   Bennu Staff  reply if this gets fixed  I promise to give you 5-stars. The wifi is a deal breaker though.
Bennu Coffee,270,Hands down the best Cappuccino I have had so far in Austin  great service as well 
Bennu Coffee,271,Very nice ambience. Great place to study at night ... If you can find a chair. Delicious coffee.
Bennu Coffee,272,Got me the Pride  amp  Prejudice mocha and enjoyed it with a homemade chocolate chip cookie. Nice vibe  chill and cozy with some throw back pop hits playing in the back ground. The barista knows her 90s R amp B hits as she serves each expresso inspiration.
Bennu Coffee,273,Great choice coffee   They had a seasonal pumpkin coffee that was incredible.  So good that I came back the next day for more   Usually coffee shops put too much syrup sweetner but this was perfect   Enjoy 
Bennu Coffee,274,This coffee shop has anything you could really want. There s ample space inside  a fairly large parking lot and lots of good food and drink options. Admittedly  I haven t had more than a cup of coffee here  but their pizza and tacos always look great.  I really like how relaxed and at home I feel when I m sitting for hours here. Wireless is pretty good and the waitstaff is really friendly. Just remember to bring cash  because  like most places  there is a  5 minimum. Oh and if I was a college student  I d be all over this  open 24 hour  business.
Bennu Coffee,275,Love the atmosphere and the coffee is great  I love the Raven . I d definitely recommend it to a friend.
Bennu Coffee,276,Our organization put on a conference for  100 people this past weekend.  We were very happy with Bennu s coffee catering service.  Aime  the catering director  was very helpful and gracious  even with last minute time adjustments. The coffee was delivered on time with the full coffee bar set up.  Everyone thought the coffee was delicious. I even overheard some attendees say  I can t believe they have Bennu Coffee here    It was great to support a local vendor and have the attendees appreciate that. The price was reasonable and competitive 
Bennu Coffee,277,I have LOVED Bennu for many years.  Not sure what happened this morning at the MLK location.  A barista with curly hair and green overalls.  Condescending AF.  Yes  I know that there is a city-wide boil ban.  Yes  I understand the boiling it for 3 minutes.   I live in the city  too.   Just because I ask about the espresso machine being  down  doesn t mean that I m attacking you or Bennu.  I was honestly curious about whether the machines get the water hot enough...  I was just making conversation.  And  give me a second to process your approved drink menu.  She was so rude.  I ve never been talked to like that by someone who works at a Bennu location.  SO disappointing.
Bennu Coffee,278,This my second time at this great coffee shop and I love it. I ordered the raspberry tea  great if you want something like after eating or before going home. Today I ordered cappuccino  that was really good with migas tacos and for lunch turkey sandwich with pesto  yummy. The ambience is soft lighting and intimate   great comfortable chairs enticing to relaxation   reading or working peacefully.  The staff are super nice. Thanks to Charlie and all that help me   I am handicapped  . This cafe is a winner  
Bennu Coffee,279,Can get kinda crowded  again  a bit of a student laptop overload  but there is lots of seating options. And there is something for everyone. And they re open 24 7  Thank you. If I lived closer I d be here more often.
Bennu Coffee,280,Very good . This might be the only hangout in Austin with enough electrical outlets to serve ALL of its customers electronic and computing needs. It can be a little thick with hipsters but they are fairly easy to ignore. Bennu is not an Austin original but you would never know it. I am taken back to the drag of the 70s and 80s. The atmosphere reminds me of the coffee shops and study lounges of old Austin. Way before the arrival of ATX.  VERY COOL but please don t go there. I want it all to myself.
Bennu Coffee,281,Cluttered and feels... dirty  Maybe dirty isn t the right word. But the mix of random tables  chairs  and overly-used couches doesn t make an enjoyable study environment for me. Plus  the various power strips hanging from the ceiling and disorganized look of the furniture arrangement is a turn-off for me. The place is also very dark  which makes it hard for me to stay awake during the late hours. The one pro is that it s 24 hours  but it s always packed at night.
Bennu Coffee,282,My first experience was borderline terrible  but it had a LOT of potential to give it another chance  AND  give it 4 stars.  First off  the barista was a total bitch. She acted like we were wasting her time  the longer we took to order for THREE people. No mercy for the first-timers with a selection of 8 different coffees that I d never heard of. Extremely rude to us  and treated us like we couldn t hear. On top of that  both french presses she made us didn t strain the coffee properly  giving us cups full of coffee grounds. That will be the last time we order a french press there.   On the flip side  this place is gorgeous  Very spacious  well-lit  comfy chairs with nice big round tables for you and your friends  along with some couches. Outlets hang down from the ceiling so you can plug in your laptops. The had good pastries too 
Bennu Coffee,283,Solid 24 7 coffee shop with lots of menu options. I highly recommend their Iced Bennu. Only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it is hard to find seating at times. On top of that  I was once approached twice by the barista basically rushing me to order something or leave. I ve been going to Bennu for 3 years  I know I have to order a drink. Very rude guy.
Bennu Coffee,284,Picked a bad day to come  too many people. It s literally back to back. I couldn t really find a comfortable place to sit for a long enough to put an all nighter.
Bennu Coffee,285,The coffee shop is usually a good place to study but if you see the barista who is young with short black hair beware. She has a real attitude. She insists on playing her loud music  which is odd indie music with screeching and is completely distracting . You can look around and see all the people studying put their headphones in when she starts blasting it to try and block it out and keep focusing. We asked politely for her to turn it down but listening to her music is more important to her than the customers so she essentially said no. Ended up having to leave and will choose other more considerate coffee shops in the future.  For the managers she started her shift around 12-1 this Sunday please give her a talking to.
Bennu Coffee,286,I love Bennu. Can we just talk about how amazing their ice is   It totally transforms my whole iced coffee experience and when I go anywhere else  I wish they would do the same thing  I love the inside - so many places to sit and enjoy your time  study or whatever you need to. Staff is usually always friendly  and it s like a little community of great people. Parking is sometimes a pain - but it s Austin. 24 7 coffee is really just the greatest idea around.   
Bennu Coffee,287,The honey creme latte is now on my list of obsessions. It is not too sweet with a bit of honey. My bank account is now in trouble.
Bennu Coffee,288,Bennu was a highlight of my Austin trip in terms of Coffee Shops Experiences  It was the first place we went to as soon as we settled into our AirBnB and it was really close. I was looking around Yelp and saw  oooh a 24 hour coffee shop   Let s go  And it ended up being the most awesome coffee shop of Austin that I got to try. It is located right next to UT Austin so it was full of lively college students. There is local art on the walls. They were packed and there was nowhere to sit down so we didn t get to spend too much time there. The barista at the front was really nice  easy to talk to  and fun to interact with. They have a whole menu of mochas based off of classic novels. I still ended up sticking to an  Iced Bennu  which tasted strong  but subtle. It was the perfect coffee for me. But they had awesome mochas like  Pride and Prejudice  which I would definitely try if I came back here. It seems like a great study spot too. Only potential downfall could be the small parking lot  but I don t live here so maybe the locals just know where to park to get around that issue.
Bennu Coffee,289,I love this place so much  It still feels like old Austin. The staff are authentically nice and helpful. They accommodate folks trying to work by providing loads of outlets. They play great music at a well-calibrated level.
Bennu Coffee,290,This is my new favorite spot  the coffee and food are both affordable and delicious  I work late  2-3am  and this place is always open and clean. I ve been here a few times now and plan on more visits. The barista  I think she said her name was Ari  was absolutely wonderful  she was extremely knowledgeable  fast and very personable with everyone  saying hello  greeting everyone with a smile and conversation. I ve had several specialty drinks both hot and cold and each one was better than the last. I honestly can t say enough good things about this place and Ari. I ll recommend Bennu Coffee and Ari to anyone who asks  And I ll be back in soon 
Bennu Coffee,291,You want great coffee  Go to Bennu s You want iced coffee  Get the Iced Bennu You want a mocha  Try their specialties You want a seat to study  Be prepared to wait  If you want to study  it might be hard to find a seat  or at least a good one to settle down and study for that test. Parking may be difficult  but street parking is available  just have to walk a little. But both the parking and finding a seat issue is a testament to Bennu s popularity  so no true qualms here   My favorite is the Iced Bennu  which is cold-brewed and very sweet  but strong. It actually got me into cold-brewing  which produces 67  less acid than traditional hot brewing.  Bennu s is the place to go to try their gourmet mocha. And I think it s creative that they name them based on various famous literature  Moby Dick for white chocolate or The Raven for dark chocolate or Don Quixote for Mexican spiced chocolate spices.
Bennu Coffee,292,This place is awesome. Personable staff  great prices  and they have great suggestions when you re in the mood to sway from your usual order. There are lots of outlets and they are 24 hrs. I try to tip them well and keep the baristas happy because  after all  they seem to give me what no other coffee place offers and at a better price. I also love that they serve my large coffee in a  beer mug. Makes me feel like I m indulging in a nice bock rather than just slaying algebraic expressions into the wee hours of the night
Bennu Coffee,293,It s a nice place with tons of seating. However most of it is taken and I had to squeeze in somewhere.  I like how they are open 24 hours. It reminds me of grad school and pulling all nighters.  It s fairly clean and the drink came out quickly.  Decent music and the ambient noise is not ridiculously loud.  I must be getting old though. all these college kids look like they re in high school.
Bennu Coffee,294,When we arrived at Bennu we asked for a coffee and the barista told us that she was cleaning the espresso machine and it should be ready in 45 minutes. We waited for the espresso machine to be cleaned. 45 minutes later she told us it was clean. We didn t order immediately so she came back and rudely told us   if you don t purchase anything in 15 minutes you will have to leave . I said okay and she walked away. Six minutes later a cop came into the coffee shop and kicked us out. POOR SERVICE  
Bennu Coffee,295,I LOVE BENNU   This place is great. The only complaint I have is with parking. This place gets so packed when it s closed to midterms or finals. I mean  that s to be expected when the place is so down to earth and is opened 24-7  There are comfy coaches and chairs everywhere. They also have tables of all sizes that will accommodate to your party size. There is also outside seating in case you can t find any inside. I ve never been able to find indoor seating  so I ve always ordered and sat outside. There are outlets EVERYWHERE. Inside and out. The place is pretty quiet so if you were going there to hang out with some friends  I would recommend sitting outside.  As for the coffee  I absolutely love the raven. It s a dark chocolate mocha that s heavenly. I ve gone here so many times that I can basically vouch that any of their mochas would be a good choice. The Pride and Prejudice was pretty good. Really sweet and chocolatey  but not too sweet. The Moby Dick is a definite for white chocolate lovers.  I personally cannot get enough of the raven. It s sweet  but also has a slightly bitter taste to it because of the dark chocolate.
Bennu Coffee,296,Great coffee shop  good for studying  meeting  or socializing. Spacious interior  plenty of outlets hanging from the ceiling  a variety of seating options from large tables to counters and 2-toppers. The iced coffee was pretty good  but not as strong as I like it. Yummy breakfast tacos and decent prices.   At 10am on a Wednesday  parking wasn t an issue. A line about 10 deep formed after we arrived  mid-morning rush  . No problem finding a table for our group of 4.
Bennu Coffee,297,This coffee spot is amazing  Best vegan chicken salad I ve had ever. And I had a delicious Italian soda- coconut and banana. Can t wait to go back again 
Bennu Coffee,298,Oh  Bennu  where do I begin   When I first arrived in Austin 10 months ago  I bounced from coffee shop to coffee shop  looking for the perfect place to call my productive home away from procrastinating home.   Where was the perfect blend of decent coffee not too hard on the budget  open at convenient hours with reliable wifi and nary a worry regarding the availability of outlets   Where would I find the balance between cozy coffee shop ambiance with a pleasurable mix of interesting conversations to overhear  music that helps me focus  but not so much hustle and bustle that I cannot get anything done   Bennu  it was you. It was you all along.   There is constantly changing local art on the walls  you have fantastically friendly staff  and a variety of seating options both inside and out. The chalkboards in the women s bathroom stalls never cease to have some entertaining quotes written up on them. Your option to keep a tab open with my credit card makes my life oh-so-convenient  and your recent decision to bring the minimum down to  2 from  5 is a miracle.  Even when the parking lot is full  which it often is  there is always street parking within one or two blocks - Poquito St serves me well.   You are open 24 hours a day  which allows me to take advantage of the days where I really get into the zone and power through a 15 hour work day well into the early hours of the morning without needing to pack up and take it home till I m well and ready. You have enough food options that I can snack my way through said work day without having to leave to grab a bite.  Thank you Bennu  for being the coffee shop I need.
Bennu Coffee,299,Where do I even begin   Bennu has been and most likely will remain my favorite coffee shop for many years.  As a pre-med student who is always studying and in dire need of a 24-hour coffee shop  Bennu is a dream come true. The ambience  baristas  coffee  and food are all amazing. While it can get really busy during the weekends  I have come to realize that certain time periods will have more tables available to study or have a social gathering. During the summer  I was here pretty much everyday and I noticed that 5-6 PM was an ideal time to come if I was hoping to find an empty table.  As for their drinks  I normally get one of their signature mochas or their Iced Bennu. The Iced Bennu has a caramel flair to it  which I find very delectable. Surprisingly  Bennu also has some pretty decent food. They have a wide variety of pizzas to choose from and also some delicious and healthy sandwiches.  One other thing I love about Bennu is their temperature. Most coffee shops I go to are always freezing and as a person who prefers the heat  Bennu is perfect. I feel as if it s never cold  but not too hot. It s simply perfect.
Bennu Coffee,300,Menu is legit. Had a Hoboken Pie which was great I had never had it before. Vegan slice was pretty good  The drink I ended up getting was great. Really tart and yummy. I can t quiet remember the name but it was made with Topo Chico  limeade and they added in a blackberry flavor. Would definitely recommend 
Bennu Coffee,301,I only come here as a last option when I need to get work done late at night as it is one of the few 24 hour coffee shops in town. Pros  almond milk available  outlets everywhere  some outdoor seating Cons  they have THE WORST MUSIC EVER and they blast it at all hours of the day and night. Since the only people that come here are people with laptops and work to get done  I really wish that they would forego on the awful and weird music especially late at night. Most people have their own earphones in anyways so I suppose it s just to keep the baristas up at night. Never will I sit at a table next to one of those speakers. Earplugs did little to help. I ve also come in on multiple occasions when all the seats are full with people stuDying and have had to take my coffee to-go.  I would say only come here with work if you can work in a loud atmosphere and need people doing work around you.
Bennu Coffee,302,The barista was extremely rude to me because I accidentally grabbed the wrong drink and embarrassed me in front of the whole shop worst experience of my life and never going back the coffee is not worth feeling like shit
Bennu Coffee,303,Here s a great coffee shop with a great staff.  I went early morning on Christmas... like 2 30am to do some work and it was not shockingly the emptiest that it had ever been when I was there.  The service was awesome... just like it always is.  The thing about this place is that it defeats the stereotypes of  hipster service   where you expect things to lackadaisically happen... here... there is prompt service regardless the crowdedness or time of day.    The food selection is what you would expect from a coffee shop... lots of pastries and wraps... and the coffee and espresso selection never disappoint.  In sum  I have never had a bad experience here.  This is my go-to spot for work when I m in the area.  If you haven t been there... you should stop in.  You won t be disappointed.
Bennu Coffee,304,So as other have mentioned this place has tons of outlets and ample seating. If nothing else was right  they could coast on the pure number of plugs alone. I mean they have extension cords hanging from the freaking ceiling  it s basically their business plan. The coffee was fine and the snacks are sourced from good places. I am only going 4 stars because the coffee wasn t amazing and honestly it s a little dark dirty for my taste. Don t think I m actually saying its gross  it s a coffee shop  it is what it is. This is definitely a 5 star place for some people  just not for me.
Bennu Coffee,305,Favorite place to study work on weekend mornings. They have outlets hanging from the ceiling above most tables inside so you don t have to worry about laptop dying. Great coffee and competent baristas. They have a LOT of seating inside - it gets full mid-day so you might have to share seating but everyone is friendly so just ask. Have had many productive days spent here.
Bennu Coffee,306,Loved the atmosphere. I ordered the pride and prejudice  iced mocha and it was really tasty. My hubs ordered straight black coffee on ice and he liked his too. Next time were in the area. We ll have to stop by again.
Bennu Coffee,307,I had their iced chai tea twice and both times were too bland. Their salad pastas is okay.
Bennu Coffee,308,Open 24 7  great music played at the perfect volume  dim lighting  comfortable seating  good drinks  and friendly staff. Needless to say I love this place.
Bennu Coffee,309,Open 24 hours  I thought it would be a dive when I heard that  but it s big and very modern. They display art for sale  have nice seating  and offer pizza  sandwiches  and coffee. My friend got their pizza and it looked amazing while I chose a matcha latte.   Everyone had their Macbooks out. If I was in college or actually lived in town  I would be here doing work all the time.
Bennu Coffee,310,This place is great to get work done with tons of seating and even a large round table for a group of 5ish  Each time I ve been there s been a decent amount of people so bring headphones if you plan on coming to do work.  Tons of outlets available.  Iced Bennu is sooooo good on a hot day but do not drink before going to see your bae  gives you gnarly coffee breath  BUT IT S SO GOOD.
Bennu Coffee,311,Bennu is like Emilio Estevez s character from The Breakfast Club  it s a winner.   And like Molly Ringwald s character  Bennu has got it all. Tons of seating  tons of outlets  great food and great drinks. They have pizza that s tasty  sandwiches from Fricano s  pastries and so on. Their drinks rock  too. They have an awesome selection of tea  and the coffee s tasty.  But like Judd Nelson s character  it s also the coolest. It s easy to feel comfortable here  and the atmosphere really lends itself to getting work done  which I appreciate.   Bennu says  Eat my shorts   to any of you who don t agree.
Bennu Coffee,312,Bennu is undoubtedly my favorite coffee spot in all of existence.   This is one of the many small independent coffee shops dotted across Austin  and frankly we need more of these places outside of Austin . It s full of cozy couches  tables  and even long desk-like tables for hanging  chilling  and of course studying. Whenever I needed to pull a string of all-nighters to finish my college papers and theses  this was the perfect place to go. The Wi-Fi is free  the ambiance is great  and it s open 24 hours    And the menu is wonderful. I can appreciate the delicious cold and hot coffee options as well as their clever  literary names. There is also an assortment of foods including Torchy s breakfast tacos for anyone who wants more than coffee too. I especially love the moderate and affordable prices  which are perfect for the studious customer who plans to spend all night there. I recommend the Moby Dick for the newcomer  or perhaps a Charles Dickens.   The only downside to Bennu is that it s probably TOO popular. If it s near semester finals for college students  don t expect to find a place to bunker down until after 1am. If you go any earlier than that expect the tiny parking lot to be as full as Bennu itself. But I can t fault my rating of Bennu for something like that  can I  Of course not.   So in the end I would recommend Bennu to anyone looking for a cozy place to spend long bouts of time studying  hanging out  or just existing. The coffee is tasty  the ambiance the epitome of independent Austin  and the prices easy on almost every wallet. I only wish there was a Bennu in the Dallas area  or any non-Austin area I happen to find myself .
Bennu Coffee,313,So delicious  chill vibe. wish they had better parking though. Thats my only complaint.
Bennu Coffee,314,This place has a great ambiance and is an optimal study spot. I ve been coming here for some time  and I usually leave a tip for my order  however  one time where I did not-- one of the female cashiers throws a passive-aggressive fit calling my lack of tip  an interesting choice . So save yourself the headache  and make sure you tip the  brunette who usually wears her hair in a ponytail  because she is definitely expecting it. Aside from this one unexpected incident  I love this place and would definitely recommend it.
Bennu Coffee,315,The campus 24 hour spot doesn t have as much appeal as some of the other all night joints due to the uncovered patio  the often aloof baristas management  and the high number of high school kids. Adequate coffee  without the atmosphere and ambiance to make up for it.  3 10 would consider again
Bennu Coffee,316,Ice coffee  carrot cake and the queen of late night coffee Ms. Ari. I think she just might be the perfect hostess and barista. Thanks for your ear.
Bennu Coffee,317,PLEASE stop playing your terrible music -- love the set up but can t ever concentrate because of it and I m definitely not the only person who feels this way.
Bennu Coffee,318,Yet another solid place for getting work done. Though the wifi gets slow when busy with students. Specialty is mocha. I tried Pride and Prejudice. Pretty good.
Bennu Coffee,319,Lost a star because he guy behind the counter  with the beard on the late shift  shows his crack when he reaches down to get ice
Bennu Coffee,320,Outlets outlets outlets    Sometimes I have a hard time with coffee shops because of their lack of outlets  but have no fear  This place literally has outlets dangling from the ceilings  which is such a genius idea   Reminds me of a short bit on Portlandia  It is a bit crowded  but I think it s a great place to study or do work.   They have large tables  small tables  long tables  and short tables.  They have large couches  small couches  plush couches  and chairs.   Good Atmosphere. Great Music. Good Tacos and sandwiches.   I would live here if I could.
Bennu Coffee,321,I ve been to Bennu thousands of times and never had an issue until today. Don t get me wrong  I would give this place five stars based off of the coffee and atmosphere alone  but the barista who took my order was extremely rude and unprofessional. After watching me press  no tip  while completing my payment  the barista immediately followed up with  just for future reference  we make everything from scratch and we all share the tips.  Like umm okay  Did I really just get called out and shamed for not tipping  Sure  baristas appreciate tips but I didn t think that simply taking my order deserved a tip. My friend also received the same exact response after not tipping on her drink either. The barista then shamed my other friend for not ordering anything and said there was a  one drink per person policy   which I have never heard of before  especially since it was 4pm on a Friday afternoon and there was plenty of space available and 2 3 of us had ordered something. In conclusion  for future reference  be prepared to hear this same response if you choose not to tip the barista for doing a lackluster job. Personally  I will not be returning to this location ever again.
Bennu Coffee,322,A great place to get work studying done. There are plenty of outlets and numerous tables. The environment is not too loud. My only complaints is that there is not much lighting  so if you don t find a table with a light above it  it may be hard to work. In terms of drinks  I ordered the  The Raven   which is a dark chocolate mocha. It was pretty good but wish it was a little less sweet.
Bennu Coffee,323,I visit Bennu about once a week as it is next door to my work. They have a bugger selection of drinks than most places  and everything I ve tried so far has been delicious.  My favorites are the Moby Dick  when you want something sweet   the chai  when you want something spicy   and the house coffee  for when you want to just make it through the day . The baristas are always joking around and conversing with customers and are friendly  diverse  and helpful. Seriously don t know how I d make it through the work week without them--thanks   PRO TIP though  avoid the couches.
Bennu Coffee,324,How many broken chairs can someone fit into a coffee shop  I m not sure because I lost count at Bennu. Seriously almost injured myself there. Came here to study  but it was so loud even my ear plugs didn t work.  Just wasn t an overall good experience  and I definitely won t make the drive out there again.
Bennu Coffee,325,Ari is probably the nicest  most talented  most well versed barista in all of central Texas. Her customer service is only out matched by her amazing ability to whip up the most amazing iced mocha you ve ever tasted.
Bennu Coffee,326,Oh Bennu. You will always have a special place in my heart  I ve been coming to this place for four years and it s one of the things I ll miss when I leave Austin.   Lots of plugs everywhere   good amount of seating  AMAZING staff  an entire menu for mochas  clean bathrooms and a great atmosphere. Only things that suck is just how packed it gets every week night and that it can be hard to find parking. It doesn t stop me from going back at least once a week though.
Bennu Coffee,327,Love the place. Being open 24 7 is AWESOME I love this part the most. My only complaint is the god awful slow wifi.. this should really be addressed. Otherwise  yeah love this spot
Bennu Coffee,328,This is a big coffeeshop with lots of seating and outlet plugs. The only terrible thing about Bennu is how dim it is. I was studying there one night and I literally could not see my keyboard because it was so dark. The coffee here is okay  I always get the iced bennu because its iced and sweet. The chairs are very comfy and they have all different kinds of chairs and couches and tables for you to work at. It s usually quiet here which is nice. Parking sucks because there aren t that many spaces and the parking lot is very small so its hard to maneuver your car around there.
Bennu Coffee,329,Quiet local coffee hideout  try the iced Bennu it s like a Vietnamese coffee  so yummy  Had a slice of carrot cake that was gluten free and it had amazing flavor  I enjoyed working out on the patio and not having to sign in to use the wifi  Go check this place out the next time you need a pick me up or a quiet place to work.
Bennu Coffee,330,Was studying quietly when the worker came up while I was on the phone and basically yelled at me  there s not outside food. There s a sign on the door you can read. Take it out to the car.  Very rudely. I d understand if she asked nicely  but if you can t respect your customers  you don t deserve any business. Don t go there unless you wanna be watched like a hawk because it was another customer who walked around and told her. I was excited about this place  but my boyfriend and I had a very ugly experience. Won t be back again.
Bennu Coffee,331,I really  really love this place. Their coffee is delicious and I ve yet to be let down by anything in the pastry case. I also have to give major shout outs to the sweet baristas that always seem to keep smiling faces  even at 3 am when faced with a grumpy crowd of stressed out college students like myself. Ya ll rock 
Bennu Coffee,332,Cute coffee shop with character. Good place for a nice cup of coffee with fellow students and professionals. Nice tunes 
Bennu Coffee,333,Love this place. Iced coffee  amazing.  1 refills  amazing.  24 hours  amazing. Super sweet staff too  in my experience. Always helpful and not snobby.  I showed up one night and bought a bag of chips and a cookie  cause I needed a place to study. They didn t judge me. Good on them.
Bennu Coffee,334,This is a really chill coffee shop. Almost everybody that goes here is coming to study so it has a very calm and quiet ambience. The drinks here are well priced  somewhere around the price of starbucks - maybe a little cheaper.   The only bad points that I ve experienced is that this place gets very busy and very packed on weeknights. Sometimes it s a struggle to find a table  but everybody is willing to share. The wifi slows down to a snail when it gets really packed here  which is a good thing if you re trying to stay on task but a real negative when you have to download a file for school or send an email.  All around a great place to visit and to go get some work done.
Bennu Coffee,335,This is literally my favorite coffee shop in Austin. Great atmosphere for studying and everything I have gotten has been simply delicious. I go here so often it is absurd.
Bennu Coffee,336,Funky place  but great coffee. When I was there it was super busy  but still served quickly. There was a great many people there  and despite all the seating  it was hard to find a place to sit. The price of popularity I guess  Will return for more though.
Bennu Coffee,337,If monkey nest  Epoch  and Mozart s were all destroyed in a freak accident- this place would become my coffee shop home.   Better than Starbucks but not better than most.   Maybe it s because I m a Republican or just not cool enough to get this place. . .  I got an iced pride  amp  predjudice- good  but not out of this world great.  The banana chocolate chip muffins were pretty tasty-  I would totally get another one of those if I ever came back.  Parking here is a bitch.  And I seriously think someone s goal here was to never have more than one of the same type of chair.  Very hipster of you whoever did this. . . snaps 
Bennu Coffee,338,I used to frequent Bennu all the time because it was convenient  they are open 24 7  and they used to serve up a delicious carrot cake  which is not available lately .    During my many visits I did try both their coffee  amp  non-coffee drinks including the Don Quixote  Strawberry Lime and Punishment  Americano  Cappucinos  amp  Lattes. I have not had a consistently good drink there. It s always been  hit or miss . The service is almost always great  which is why they are receiving this many stars from me. The baristas are friendly  but their drinks are average.   PROS  Open 24 7  friendly service  bike rack  sells food  pizza slices  bagels  more   snacks  even gluten-free cookies  offers WI-FI to patrons  art on the walls  clean restroom  lots of outlets  patio seating  albeit uncomfy with tiny tables  amp  hard chairs  is available   CONS  Music is awful  and usually loud and invasive  can t block it out with headphones   crowded  poor parking  food is neither tasty nor satisfying  small portions   Chairs and seating accommodations aren t comfortable  Lighting is too dim.   BOTTOM LINE  Definitely not a place I d recommend to a coffee connoisseur. There is much better espresso to be had in town. Definitely not a place I d recommend to people who plan to spend more than 30 minutes there. Bennu does NOT provide a comfortable working meeting environment. It s often loud and crowded and the chairs  amp  tables  amp  poor lighting just don t offer much comfort.
Bennu Coffee,339,Great coffee  great atmosphere but awful service.   I m sure if you re a local and everyone knows you  it might be different but it seemed like in this place everyone gets treated with an intentional casual indifference.
Bennu Coffee,340,This place has the worst food in ATX  period. I went there late one night with my gf because it was the only 24 hour joint nearby. We got a couple of wraps and their  vegan mac n cheese...  even though the food was prepackaged  it took at least 15 min for us to get all of it  and the girl seemed really bothered to do it.   The wraps were cold and bland. In fact  they were nearly frozen in the center. The vegan mac n cheese was basically microwave noodles coated in nutritional yeast... they didn t taste good and it all seemed really lazy.   When we attempted to but our own dishes before leaving  we couldn t because the dish been was completely full and swarming with flies  so we just left our dishes on the counter next to it.   I can t remember how much everything cost us  but I remember it wasn t cheap. We haven t gone back and I doubt we ever will.
Bennu Coffee,341,16 oz coffee tasted good and was  2.16 with tax. Staff was friendly and I liked the ambiance in Bennu. Seems like a good place to study or read or even go with a small group.
Bennu Coffee,342,Great place to enjoy a good quality drink along with peaceful environment. Cool thing is its 24 hours. Perfect place to get away and study. If your a student you must go here  
Bennu Coffee,343,Great vanilla lattes  awesome atmosphere  only complaint is the wifi is a little slow spotty at times  and parking is hard to find at times as well. Staff is really cool  if you ve never been they ll help you decide what to get if you just tell them what you like  Plenty of outlets  which is very nice  I ve never had trouble finding a seat  You have options  table  bar or couch  Overall  really chill coffee house 
Bennu Coffee,344,The coffee is fantasic. I highly recommend the Scarlet Letter. They have several milk options available too  if you re lactose intolerant or just watching your calories. There s plenty of seating and the chairs are an eclectic mix of styles  so you can always find a comfortable seat. The food is pretty good too  I have had their gluten free cupcake and a truffle. Both were very good.
Bennu Coffee,345,Been to several Austin coffee shops. Most are ok atmosphere  coffee leaves a lot to be desired. Tried houndstooth  metici  monkey  cherrywood  WiFi always down   Epoch  and who knows what others. I ve had great coffee  wilfordshire estate Jamaican blue mtn  which by many is the best beans in the works. No bite  very smooth  no after taste  etc  unfortunately cost is  52 lb  is USA. The coffee here is avg at best  with houndstooth a whopping 2 out of 10 . Here at Bennu its good  7.5 of 10  and lots of room to maneuver  ... excuse new sir  please remove your groin from my arm  I m trying to use my laptop...   The staff is avg friendliness  if you speak to them  they will respond .  Bottom line  come here for a good cup of Joe  don t come here to meet to folks. Just sayin.
Bennu Coffee,346,Open 24 7  so many outlets  a lot of chairs tables - this is the perfect place to work
Bennu Coffee,347,Amazing coffee  relaxing atmosphere  cool  friendly staff  Vegan  vegetarian and gluten-free options  amp  open 24 7. Who could ask for more  Don t miss out 
Bennu Coffee,348,I love coming to Bennu Coffee on Saturday mornings. I am greeted by the sleepy faces of Amy and Nuckie and we have a pleasant chat while they get my order.  There is a good selection of pastries. The coffee is great. It is a comfortable space. What more could you want
Bennu Coffee,349,They have outlets EVERYWHERE and wifi that is strong   I also really  liked their coffee and the staff. I could have easily stayed longer but I had a lunch date.  I can see myself studying or working out of the space. I wonder if it would be weird if I moved closer. I d be a regular 
Bennu Coffee,350,I lost the count of how many times I came here since I moved here. Seriously. I m an avid cafe lover and always on prowl to check out different cafes to kick back and relax but Bennu is the only one of few cafes that kept me coming back over and over again.   Bennu opens 24 hours and has a great selection of coffee  beverages  and food. Their muffins are to die for especially banana chocolate chip one.  Fabulous place for studying  scoring free wi-fi  people watching  group meetings  or just to kick back and relax like I do.   PROS  1  Free wifi. 2  Great coffee and a god-sent mini-bar with all basic necessities for coffee. 3  Community board  posters  flyers  business cards. It s neat to see the rise of local community. 4  Toilet paper. I know this is strange but 90  of other places I went to somehow always ran out of toilet paper. Makes sense if you drink a lot of coffee in one sitting. Anyway  Bennu has plenty.  CONS   I don t see them as a con but other people might do .  1  BUSY ALL THE TIME. It s not that bad but it s so popular that it is always crowded -  great for people who enjoy people watching like me. Gotta be ready to share a table with others   2   PARKING. Many people may find parking a hassle but it s not so bad once when you find a side-street to park and stretch your legs while walking because you re probably going to want to stay for a long time at Bennu.   Deafies  the review for Deaf people. The light is great and bright at nighttime  which is easy on our eyes and easier to see other people signing. Bennu has menus on the counter so you just point at whatever you want to order and don t have to write down anything or take out a phone to type. The servers are friendly and willing to gesture with you instead of speaking loud at you.
Bennu Coffee,351,10 10 why go to epoch this place is so much better and the employees are all so nice  I feel so much more comfortable here. Inside chairs are nice and the outside patio feels very open. Ps try getting your flavored coffee beverage of choice with one of the floral flavors like rose or lavender
Bennu Coffee,352,I don t think I can ever move just because this coffee shop is so close to my house and it s my absolute favorite    Just moments ago I walked in and they were playing  total eclipse of the heart  and I felt obligated to sing along to it while I waited in line. Apparently my enthusiasm was enough to earn myself a free drink from one of the lovely workers here    so sad to hear that people get upset by the music here  Petty 
Bennu Coffee,353,Great  consistent coffee.  Laid-back but friendly staff.  Lots of different seating set-ups  couches  comfy chairs  bar-top  table and chairs  inside or outside .  Lots of outlets and task lighting.   Lots of great art on the walls.  Cute and clean bathroom.  Great community bulletin board.  Diverse crowd. Clean and comfortable.  Open 24 hours.  If I was going to open a coffee shop  I d ask myself   how could it be more like Bennu     Yes the parking lot is usually full but that s just because they re doing so well  it s not like the parking lot is too small  so I can t fault them for that.  There s plenty of street parking in the area.
Bennu Coffee,354,This place is pretty great.  They have really yummy mochas and it s super cool cozy inside.  There s a lot of seating which is also nice.  The baristas are really nice and helpful.  They have lots of yummy things to eat at pretty reasonable prices.  I have spent many a successful day studying at this location when I was in college  and would also recommend it as a place to hang out.  Unfortunately  parking is an issue.  Also  I would say their coffee is mediocre at best.  If you re going in for a beverage  I would stick to a tea or flavored coffee drink  unless you re just drinking the coffee to stay awake.
Bennu Coffee,355,How awesome was my organic coffee with coconut milk       i didn t want it to end. On my way out of Austin  I stopped by for coffee  they happened to be close to where I was staying. Loved the friendly greet as soon as I walked in    The person behind the counter was very patient with me as my brother and I decided on snacks in addition to the coffee  and she also explained the coffee options. So I give them all the stars possible for service  patience  and a delicious coffee .... Seriously  at most coffee places  you can t really tell the difference but whatever this blend was  was amazing.
Bennu Coffee,356,Comfy back couch  Ordering coffee or tea from this place makes me feel like I m in an episode of Portlandia. Loose leaf tea is put into a teabag which is steeped in a ceramic mug. The only way this could be more green is if the teabag was reusable 
Bennu Coffee,357,Good place for great coffee and to unwind  relax and read....best coffee I ve tried so far 
Bennu Coffee,358,I went here on the Fourth of July and thought it wouldn t be busy  but it definitely was  At first all of the tables and people overwhelmed me but everyone was quiet and working on their own stuff  and I was able to grab a seat. It ended up being nice and had the community vibe that is so great about Austin. I ordered an iced almond milk latte and it was good  not the best I ve ever had but this place deserves 4 stars because of the atmosphere 
Bennu Coffee,359,I ve only had the drip coffee  but it s always been tasty and well priced. I tend to do a lot of work in coffee shops and the atmosphere is nice  relaxing  but also productivity-inducing. Also very spacious with lots of tables and chairs  so I ve never had issues finding a table. The only thing is the parking lot is a little small  though I ve always been able to get a spot eventually. Highly recommended 
Bennu Coffee,360,Small snack sandwich selection and the coffee is good. Most people who go there are working on their laptops or studying  so if you don t plan to do the same then you may feel out of place. It s a hip little hangout to do work and has a bit of outdoor seating available as well.
Bennu Coffee,361,I ll try to keep this impartial  but I really don t like this place.  Honestly  though  a lot of my reasons are a matter of taste  so you may find it to be a 5-star establishment for your tastes.  It s one of the few 24-hour coffee shops in town  which is a huge plus.  But honestly  that s the ONLY reason I go.  Because I work nights  I quickly run out of places to go on my  weekend afternoons  at 3 AM.  The only reason I ever go to Bennu is when I m desperate for a change of pace and set the bar really low.  The hipster vibe is part of why I hate it  but that s entirely subjective.  You might love it for the very same reasons I hate it  so I m trying to be helpful here.  It s definitely a hipster place  and to their credit  their very large  ragtag collection of beat-up old couches are quite comfortable... though  at a glance  you wonder what kinds of bodily fluids might be embedded deep within.  Surprisingly  it is ALWAYS busy here.  I mean  even at odd hours of the night.  It s like a beatnik study hall for insomniacs.  At any given hour  there are guaranteed to be lots of people studying here  which makes me wonder why they play their music so loud all the time.  Isn t that counter-intuitive to their reputation as a UT study hall   Outlets galore   This place has more power outlets per capita than any other place I ve seen in town.  They have power strips dangling from the ceiling between every table.  It s convenient  but MAN this place is an eyesore.  I guess that s actually why some people like the place  though.  They like garish furniture  avant-garde art on the walls  obtrusive music over the speakers  and cables inexplicably hanging from the ceiling everywhere.  That is what you can expect.  I ve been here many times  and the service is hit-or-miss.  Sometimes  rarely  the barista is fairly warm  but most of the time they ve been downright cold.  Rude  even.  That  paired with the surly UT students and insufferable hipsters  and you have an atmosphere where the hostility is palpable.  I do not enjoy going here  but being a night person  I run out of options pretty quickly.  All this writing  and I still haven t actually reviewed the coffee or food.  Well  the coffee is so-so.  Certainly nothing there to complain about  but nothing particularly memorable  either.    If the ambiance sounds like your thing  go for it.  Sometimes  though  you just need a place to get work done at 3 AM  and this is one of your few options.  It s certainly a unique establishment  and lends itself to the  Austin experience   but I can t recommend a place simply to be able to say that you went.  This is a great place for hipsters and overworked students  but not so good for anyone else.
Bennu Coffee,362,I don t buy into the notion that it s cute for an establishment s furniture to be ergonomically perverse. A misfit between seat and table height proportions can only lead to a terrible experience for people who buy their coffee right to sit and read. You re trying to be comfortable  and the furnishings seem to have been installed with an intent to discomfit the clientele. The power outlet thing that Bennu   Epoch do sucks - one plug fits well  but the other two come loose at any jostling  leading to computer shutdowns and power drainage and just annoyances as clients try to fix the plug problems in this cutesy  non-aggressive way.  Food sucks overall  especially the carrot cake. Frosting is like a cream cheese cake on its own - way too much  sandwiches are bland and annoyingly priced for portions  pizza s alright  I guess  if you like warmed-up pizza slices to go with your acidic drinks  which if you do  means you have no taste. The only way to compensate is to feed yourself  but then the owners gripe at you if you bring in food  but not if you bring in alcohol  but then they don t explain the distinction. Wat. Vegan cupcake things are nice  but crumble apart at first fork  that s a cornmeal snack for you.  Good music tastes overall  especially the guy who torments you with noise rap and rock. I don t think these virgin collegiates should be comfortable in a coffee shop.  Nice art stuff. Nobody cares about it  but it s good to look at sometimes.  Babes everywhere.  Oh yeah  the iced coffee is spot on  and the baristas are a talented  experimental lot. Ask Bill for his take on the Bulletproof bullshit going on now.  I miss the crackheads accosting everyone. Did they die 
Bennu Coffee,363,Good vibe here. The seats suck though  and during summer is uncomfortably hot. I usually end up having to leave after about an hour or two of being here due to sweating so much.   The staff is great  they are always asking how things are going and genuinely seem to care. I m a skeptic of believing that people are nice for no reason and assumed that it was for tips only  but after coming here off and on for almost a year I believe they are nice for the sake of being nice.  The coffee is affordable  and the food is pretty tasty. Pizza   sandwiches   wraps   muffins   tacos   pastries   etc. The pizza is hit or miss  but usually pretty tasty. I like getting the Oliver Twist. If you are like me  and have no clue about different types of coffee  the staff is great for giving suggestions. They also have teas that are not on the menu. Just look on the counter when you head up to order. Also  refills are available on some coffees and teas for a small charge.   It s 24 hours. This alone makes the place 4 stars. I really  really  love coming here late at night. I am having to try hard and not drawbridge. Internally I m screaming  stay away      Cons   sorta  You are charged a fee if you do not purchase the min  5 for debit credit cards. Not really a con to me  but some might be annoyed.  Seating - Not many people are moving here. If you get here early enough  you should be good. Please remember to share tables. Nothing is more irritating than seeing the one guy taking up a table meant for 5 people.  Smoking - I am not a fan of sitting outside because people like to smoke there. It s outside  and well I ll get over it  but you may not. Fair warning.  Parking - I usually just walk here  but the lot is pretty small. It s also good indicator of how full the place is going to be. If every spot is taken  then go somewhere else  it s full.  I m not listing Pros because A. I m lazy and B. everything besides the Cons is pretty on point and worthy of being a Pro.
Bennu Coffee,364,Perfect place to study with your laptops  since there are so many tables and outlets. There was a lack of light at some corners tho  so be aware of that. Food and drinks are also good and decent priced. My friends got stuff from their mocha menus and absolutely loved it. My hazelnut latte was nice too. Bonus  the  You re my butter half  wall is right across from the cafe.
Bennu Coffee,365,For what it is this is a great place to go to. Don t expect too much. People smoke right outside the front door and I hate that. If they stop that obnoxious practice I ll give them 5 stars.
Bennu Coffee,366,Bennu is just down the street from us and it has quickly become our neighborhood go-to in the coffee department. They make the most delicious almond milk latte around  and the friendly faces behind the counter are always a delight to see. It doesn t take long at all for Nucky to know your name  and you know you re a real regular when you get a nickname  We love this place.
Bennu Coffee,367,I like that Bennu is 24-hour  Austin needs more places that are open for late night study sessions    but honestly I don t come here very often because the wifi is the WORST. It is terribly slow and you often can t even connect for minutes at a time. Also  the baristas can be a bit brusque  especially to people who don t really know what s going on or where things are. Like I get that it s busy for finals  but smile.
Bennu Coffee,368,Thrilled this place in in my hood. Though it s quaint and quiet  I have yet to stop and hang out  instead have abused Bennu for take out.  They have a great selection of drinks and goodies  especially if you have special dietary needs   and support local businesses. Everything I ve tried is top notch  but they earn a 5 stars simply for the fact their Americano comes with crema on top. Never seen that before  Awesome.  Bonus points for being open 24 hours  even recently on a  holiday  . Yes   Only downside is that there are more spots inside than there is for parking outside  but I think that speaks positively about what s going on inside 
Bennu Coffee,369,I normally love this place  I have never had bad service until today. Some girl  who wasn t even taking our order  came up and started talking crap to me and my husband. When I started to defend my husband she clearly started having serious attitude.  I honestly couldn t  believe her audacity  She was unmistakably trying to be rude  I normally love this place but if I have to be treated like crap I might as well go to Starbucks.
Bennu Coffee,370,Doesn t even deserve a star. I only added a star because it made me in order to write a review .. this place sucks   Lady was super rude . Unnecessarily rude . . I understand the power was out  amp  she was probably a little frustrated   but my god .. I ve never in my entire life have came across such a rude person . It s just coffee   not really that serious .  Rude rude rude   acted like I cutt the cord to the entire building . . Jezzzzus .
Bennu Coffee,371,Great coffee and great staff  This my favorite coffee shop in Austin    Knuckie is awesome and always takes good care of us.
Bennu Coffee,372,Food  prices  and atmosphere are fantastic.  However  the staff there is beyond intolerable and ruins the entire experience.
Bennu Coffee,373,Gonna be hard to beat  I just took the barista s 1st suggestion  just said I wanted it cold and caffeinated  he nailed it. Happy I just moved near by  Oh  and I think it s a 24 hour Op  so.. too bad I m not in college anymore.. Iced Blennu where it s at..
Bennu Coffee,374,Bennu  how do I love thee  Let me count the ways....  1  Pull-down electrical outlets so easy to operate they don t make me feel like I was held back three times in middle school  I m looking at you  Epoch. Honestly  can  anyone  successfully operate those things  .  2  Delicious coffee - particularly the french press variety  which comes in two sizes. Get the kind from Ethiopia that starts with a  Y   yerbachev  Yorbachov  Post-Soviet President Gorbachev  I can never remember how to pronounce it correctly. WARNING  Don t drink this blend on an empty stomach. It is extremely strong.  3  Open 24 hours  Hooray   4  A wide variety of delightful  read  not stale  pastries.  5  Friendly staff.  6  Cute patio.  7  Comfortable couches.  8  Music here is almost always good. Relaxing and unintrusive.  Striking a happy medium between Epoch and Flightpath  Bennu is equally good for studying  hanging out  or flying solo with a good book or three. Parking can be challenging  but if the lot is full  there s usually a spot on the side street.
Bennu Coffee,375,Rah  The power  the pure power  Mwwwahaha   I m talking about outlets  people  which Bennu has plenty of. Plus their internets is super fast  which is kind of awesome when you use it as much as most Yelpers do.  The service was super fast and super friendly. The space is utilitarian without appearing so. That means  it functions super well as a study space  coffee shop  Internet cafe  Woah  the 1990 s are calling and they want their phrase back   without looking like a sparse  unwelcoming and brutal space. Instead the space is warm and inviting and seating is vintage and plentiful.  They seem to have the same selection most coffee shops have of local pastries and brownies by local companies. My only complaint   CONVERSATION  ANYONE    You would think by the silence that has befallen the room that our society is populated by mutes who s faces glow as they gaze into little screens. Anyways  this place needs a little more life during the day. Too much studying and too little fun makes Jack a boring boy.
Bennu Coffee,376,This place does a pretty solid job of delivering on what it presents itself as  a quiet  relaxing place to get some studying or work done. The music is at a comfortable volume  maybe just a hair loud  but really not bad. During my experience the crowd volume was pretty reasonable too  I think the set up of the shop sort of implies that it isn t a place for social gatherings. This is much appreciated for people working and studying.  The main drawbacks during my initial experience was an inconsistency with pricing. The menu indicated refills were at a lower price  though when I tried to get a decaf coffee refilled the barista charged me at full price. I asked her if I couldn t get the refill price and she said no without any further explanation.  Additionally the staff members when I first got there  I was there for a couple of hours  were a little off putting  but a very friendly staff member came on towards the end of when I was there and was much kinder. Hard to know which is the standard  but I appreciated the effort the second barista put in.   They also have a solid array of food and bakery items that complement their beverages quite well. They have options for many diets  and the social consciousness is great to see.  Overall a solid experience  I ll probably go back but another place could certainly earn my business.
Bennu Coffee,377,Beautifully bizarre and spacious coffee shop with playful people  funky music and a sizzling vibe.  So versatile yet so consistent.    Best. Coffee. Ever.   A SEXY MOTHER FUCKER BENNU IS .... the library you only wish you had when you were in school.  You know  that library where you do it on the chairs  on the couches  on the bookshelves  on the books  on the magazines  on the shelves  on the tables and even on the floor.  And here  you will want to do it on the counters  on the dishes  against the tall clock  against the windows  in the flowers outside and definitely all up in those coffee beans.    Just wait until you see what I mean - you will be lickying your latte all over this place.  P.S.  I am not even going to say anything about all the cords hanging from the ceiling that do not look like they should  just  be used as outlets.
Bennu Coffee,378,I told Kelly  it s like a study bomb went off in here   and before we answer the question about whether or not it s copacetic to quote yourself  let s talk about Bennu. When this place opened a few months ago there rained sheets of prose on this new east side stopover  home to the scholastic and brown bean-friendly set  and now  honeymoon in the rear view  they ve settled comfortably into what it seems they ve meant to become  namely  a semi-sprawling collection of sitting areas  framed by fare from local eateries and alive on a Sunday chill music bed.   If you drop in  note that you ll need more than a little luck to find parking if you catch these guys during popular hours  but a little hike never hurt anyone. Well  at least  nothing that an extra shot of caffeine  or in my case  an Italian soda  natch  and some good company won t fix.
Bennu Coffee,379,Bennu is by far the best coffee shop in central austin  It has Lots of OUTLETS  SEATING and incredible local ARTWORK  The Iced Bennu is a MUST if you go for the first time. Kristen is one of the coolest and most professional barista s there  She is very knowledgable on the selection and helps you make a choice on a drink if you are not sure. It feel likes home and there is a wide variety of music that gets pretty catchy overtime. And it is open 24 7  Enough said. Go NOW   I ve been going here for a bout 6-7years now 
Bennu Coffee,380,I absolutely LOVE this place and everything about it   The new changes they recently made  the new art on the walls are beautiful  The coffee is the best  the baristas are super friendly which compliment their awesome personalities 
Bennu Coffee,381,This is my 100th review.  I ve been trying to figure out which place I should review for my 100th.   I wanted to make it special  you know  I mean  all the other 99 places I ve reviewed were special in their own way. Some places I still am in touch with  but some have sort of fallen off. That s just the way  I guess. You grow and you move on.  But this is number 100. Like I said  I wanted to review a place that really means something to me. Like maybe the first place I went to when I moved to Austin  or somewhere I used to work. I thought and I thought.  Then I woke up one morning and realized I was putting too much pressure on the whole thing. Maybe I should just go out and get drunk and just review the first place that seems half-way decent. Just get it over with  and wake up in the morning ready to go on numero 101. I mean  it s just a number  right   But along came Bennu.   Number 100.  Nice coffeeshop. We ve hung out a few times this week already. I think it s pretty cool  and I haven t thought about another coffeeshop since my first time here. It s not perfect  but you know what   I ll wake up tomorrow and crank out 101  102 and 103 with no regrets at all.
Bennu Coffee,382,Hi  my name is Don and I m a recovering yelpaholic.  Hi Don.  So I haven t yelped to the point of intoxication in about 6 months.  Now I m more of a social yelper.  I might check the site once a week when I m looking for something.  All of that is to say that I don t really know what s going on with new places.  So today when i was looking for a coffee shop  I was surprised to find one about which I d never heard with 20  reviews.  And here I am.  Honestly  my first impression is that I love this place.  Great food options  for a shop without its own kitchen   cool space  vibe  and abundant couch and comfortable seating  remembering S amp M chairs at 2nd Medici .    And the iced Bennu is my new favorite iced coffee drink.  Delicious like Beyonce in the 3rd Austin Powers.  I m sure this place gets crowded during the semester or after 5 and weekends... but its awesome at 2 30 on a Wednesday.  This is my new favorite place to work... well done Bennu.
Bennu Coffee,383,Bennu Coffee put me to sleep.  But in a good way.  Earlier in the evening  I invited a friend to The Highball.  I had a GREAT TIME dancing and sweating and acting all sober-crazy.  My friend  however  was having one of those  I m just not feeling like dancing to Vanilla Ice and Proclaimers  kind of nights.  Initially  I thought   How could she do this to me   I mean  i even took a nap so I could dance until the break of dawn and everything.     But  I decided to be empathetic.  To be honest  I can remember times when I have gone out dancing only to change my mind after an hour or so.  I guess my biggest concern was how I going to bring down my sweat-fest high so I could go to sleep.  After throwing around some ideas  I remembered reading on Yelp that Bennu Coffee is a 24 hour venue.  We decided to check it out.  Walking into Bennu  I immediately noticed it s popularity with students and brainiacs.  Most customers were seated in front of a laptop positioned next to stacks of books and notedbooks  THANK GOD THAT S NOT ME .  I don t know if Bennu is a good place to meet people  or even if it attracts the people I d want to meet  I mean gee-whiz   Books and laptops on a Saturday at 1am during Christmas break   but shhhh  I did enjoy secretly making fun of one young man speaking intellectual-gibberish by the front door.  And  I started to feel sleepy when I heard his voice.  Once inside  I ordered a tea and an Italian soda and my friend and I made our way to the only vacant seats  a sofa and cozy chair at the back of the room.  Bennu was cozy and warm and I appreciated that my seat was soooooooooooooooooooo far from a front door that I did not have to put up with bursts of cold air and drafts.  I drank my Italian soda  and then my hot tea  and then finished my friend s tea  and felt myself getting very sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepy.  One hour later  I could barely make it off the couch for the long journey back to the front door and back to my friend s car for the drive home.  Fortunately  I made it home and snuggled into bed.  So Bennu - I like you.
Bennu Coffee,384,Had I written this review an hour ago  I would ve given Bennu a four star rating for the boring indie rock soundtrack  Modest Mouse  Little Wings  same diff   but since the baristas played Jorge Ben s  Africa Brasil  in its entirety followed up by Fela Kuti s  Opposite People Sorrow Tears and Blood  this place deserves a full on 5 stars.  Mediocre bad music is a total dealbreaker.  And how often do you get to hear Fela Kuti casually played in public    Oh yeah  and the drinks are good.  I enjoyed the iced chai and I look forward to trying their summer special limeade topo chico flavor of choice.  I m definitely coming back here to work.  Love the comfy mismatched furniture  free wifi  and electrical outlets galore.
Bennu Coffee,385,So glad I found this place  I came here by chance to study with fellow philosophy classmates and found my new study place. Open 24 hours  serves coffee and food  and has free wi-fi What more could I really ask for   The people here are always really friendly and I love supporting local places. Cool vibe  great place to study or event get some joe with a few friends.
Bennu Coffee,386,When it s 2 14 am and you have half a paper written  or less   ruts in your hair from finger-combing stress  and you re out of Wifi and or coffee  Bennu is your best friend. It s probably your best friend anyway because of their bar tab style payment system and signature mochas  a bit pricey  but the spiced ones are good   but it s good to know that you ll always have it even if you re poor and death-white from lack of sleep.   Bennu has one of the most comfortable atmospheres for studying that I ve encountered  only made better by their 24 hour business days. Multiple sockets hang from the ceiling so you don t have to use that awkward  sorry I...yeah I just...sorry  yeah  socket  line as you crawl over 3 people to reach the wall. And there are a variety of seating options  from armchairs to wooden chairs  library-style tables to small squares.  The coffee is good  the people are friendly  and the atmosphere is comfortable. I m not sure what else a good study space needs  except maybe food. Oh wait--it has that too.
Bennu Coffee,387,Bennu is a 24-hour coffee shop in East Austin with an amazing atmosphere and awesome baristas. This is my go-to study spot  However  It s a little loud if you re seeking a quiet place to read or work. Cynthia and Ames are friendly baristas and quick to recommend a drink or offer up witty banter    This place is a gem in a trendy up and coming neighborhood and worth checking out 
Bennu Coffee,388,I really had high hopes  but I think I m going to be forced to find greener pastures.  They chanrged for refills on the ice tea   0.75 for each refill   which I just found kinda ridiculous.    Also  I feel like they need to decide whether they are running a coffee shop for an after-school program for children.  This afternoon while I was there  there where 3 small neighborhood girls hanging out for several hours  during the course of which I had to listen to their school-age girls  disagreement  watch them run back and forth across the shop  and even LITERALLY turn cartwheels in the middle of the shop.  I mean  seriously  Cartwheels   I would have left earlier had I not been there working with a friend of mine that I don t get to see that often. Maybe I just need to visit Bennu after their bedtimes....  Update  Man  I had a bagel with cream cheese and lox here at about 2 PM.  When  I got home at about 5 45 PM  I got insanely  vomit-us ly sick about 10-15 times   it was AWFUL. And I never get sick.  That bagel was the only thing I had to eat today  I am so  so sorry to say this about a local spot but I just can t think I can go back.   I have no idea what happened  but whatever it was - I don t want it to happen again        
Bennu Coffee,389,Now Austin  this is the place to get the tea latte in town  I moved to Austin like a year ago and this was the first cafe I visited. The service was friendly and helpful. It s a good place to study or have a long rich conversation with your friend  especially because it s 24 hours. Everyone s really nice  but I gotta shout out to Xy because they re the one I interact with the most. They re such a hardworker but keeps their cool in the busiest times  while making one mean Texas Gold latte. Bennu s worth your trip and tip  come for a nice cup of tea 
Bennu Coffee,390,Espresso  damn good   Wi-fi  good  Outlets  very good -- most places along the walls have them  and they ve got extensions dropped from the ceiling for the interior tables -- that s consideration   Seating  very good -- they ve definitely made the most of their space  eclectic array of tables  chairs  and couches  Cafe  fairly spartan decor  with some paintings  better lighting would help  Baristi  they know how to pull a shot   Notes  decent sized parking lot  though it can get packed quickly  but street parking is fairly plentiful
Bennu Coffee,391,One of the four tetrarchs from EPOCH broke off from that place and founded BENNU  and he took the best of that place with him.  Bennu  Egyptian for  phoenix   has consistently good coffee drinks--not as good as Italy yet--but very good for Austin.  It also has  1  Music that s not so loud that it takes the enamel off your teeth   2  No vagrants trying to sit with you at your table  especially if you re a woman   3  No cigarette smoke bleeding into the interior of the coffee shop   4  Plenty of electrical outlets in an open  spacious place  with new  comfortable seating everywhere  and everything is clean  including the bathrooms--very unusual for an Austin coffee shop   5  Good fresh food from local purveyors  AND  6  Mostly a friendly and professional waitstaff WHO KNOW HOW TO MAKE COFFEE DRINKS  with no one baring his teeth at you if he thinks you don t tip enough  or prodding you to leave  even if you re a regular  if you haven t bought anything for 30 minutes  unlike Epoch.  I noticed that Epoch shut down Christmas Eve this year because no customers were there.  it s clear that they have driven much of their business away  and that now the people who have been disappointed with the coffee  food  and service at Epoch have gone over to Bennu for a better experience.  Bennu even smells better than Epoch   The only downside is that Bennu is really starting to fill up.  It s not so bad if you get there late like after midnight.  Fantastic place to read study  which is what I use it for  and the social scene here is evolving.
Bennu Coffee,392,Okay  so I really love just about everything about Bennu. I love the mocha list  I only ever order mochas so it s beautiful . I LOVE the Don Quixote. Favorite mocha of all time  I swear to god. The staff is lovely  the coffee tea bar is extensive  amp  well-managed and the environment is also lovely.   The only issue with Bennu is that everybody knows how awesome it is and therefore there is never any parking. you can park along the street the leads up to it  but since they re building have built new condos and houses along the street it s a bit more complicated  now.
Bennu Coffee,393,I love Bennu because it is a great place to study and have good coffee. I really like their chai which is much better than at other coffee places I ve tried. The Bennu coffee its really good too. The cakes are delicious  The staff is friendly and helpful. The only reason why I m giving it 4 stars  is because they don t have a lot to eat and considering their costumers stay long and I mean very long  there should be more menu items. So just know that if you get hungry you might need to go get food elsewhere and come back to your study session.
Bennu Coffee,394,A number of reviews have commented that this place reminds them of Epoch.  There s a reason for that.  The guy who runs the place  Steve Williams  used to be a part owner of Epoch.  He and the other Epoch owners were all connected to the late great Mojo s.  He was bought out by the other owners and set up his own place.  The circumstances around that buyout vary depending on who you talk to  but consensus is the parting was less than amicable.    At any rate  some of the details of the two places are similar.  For instance  both places used the same carpenter  so the counters look similar. Both are 24 hours.  Both have free wifi and pizza.  Bennu has the advantage of being newer and cleaner than Epoch.  It has a neat mocha menu - I particularly like the one with chile in it.  It has a nice set of board games along the wall  and I ve played a few rounds of Monopoly with friends.  It may even have better coffee.  Epoch however  has all of my friends and the old Mojo s crowd  so to me that seals the deal.  It has a laid-back atmosphere and people talk to each other.  Bennu is more upscale  but it makes it a little less warm.  And I don t go to coffee shops for the coffee  I go for the company.  But whatever may have gone down in the parting of ways  I wish Steve luck with his new place.  I might stop in for another chile mocha and a round of Monopoly sometime.
Bennu Coffee,395,24 Hour coffee shop   GREATNESS for any college student.   The drinks  the food  the sweets  the staff  and the atmosphere are all great here. I usually get the Iced Bennu and a treat  banana bread is bomb . For those nights where I know I m going to stay a bit longer  I ll grab a slice of Hoboken pizza or Fricano s yummy sandwiches. Sometimes  there will be some questionable loud music playing that I wish my earplugs could drown out. But that s only sometimes...other then that  Bennu  in my opinion  is better than Epoch. Just my opinion.   Go to the restroom  you might get a few laughs in reading the walls before your doomed test or paper in eight hours.
Bennu Coffee,396,Austin is jam-packed with coffee shops  including Spider House  La Tazza Fresca  Austin Java  Dominican Joe s  Mozart s  Jo s  Ruta Maya  Progress  Lava Java  JP s Java  Thunderbird  Epoch  Flightpath  Kick Butt Coffee  and the list goes on.  Each of those coffee shops hold a special  caffeinated place in my heart  however  the new kid in town just won me over.  Enter Bennu Coffee.   I m in a list-making mood  so here s the rundown of why I m now getting my coffee kicks at Bennu   1.  open 24 hours  7 days a week  2.  power hookups are everywhere   no need to pack a surge protector 3.  an insane number of seating options  couch  swivel  stool  elegant leather chair 4.  food offerings from salads to wraps to decadent slices of chocolate cake 5.  the women s bathroom comes complete with a framed chalkboard for those who need to express themselves beyond the usual  1 and 2. 6.  a LIST of mocha drinks--dessert in a mug  7.  bright  happy lighting for those of us who still deal with turning pages 8.  music that s easy on the ears and just eclectic enough  we re talking everything from latin beats to classical  9.  small outdoor seating area for those days when the pup tags along 10.  a coffee shop that makes it easy to linger for long hours any time of the day or night  Reasons for -1 star... -   5 credit card minimum  -  If you go there and bring a friend and said friend does not order a food drink right away... watch out   Bennu asks that everyone orders something  and they are a little too anal about the timing of that order.  Egh. -  They are a business  so I can t help but see their point.  It s all in the approach...
Bennu Coffee,397,For us non-coffee drinkers  we have developed an acute focus on what it is about a coffee shop that keeps us coming back.  You know  when it s not the actual coffee.  It generally amounts to some combination of a relaxed atmosphere with ample seating  tolerable music  and good place to work while having a coffee alternative.  Well  Bennu has got those bases covered pretty well.  Breaking Epoch s stronghold on the mid-Austin 24-hour market  Bennu is similar  but with a few nuanced differences that can make all the difference in the world.  The building itself is much more open than Epoch  which fringes on  cramped  while Bennu is more  cozy .  Generally  there is plenty of seating for the students and hipsters that serve as its most frequent clientele.  The menu is diverse enough  offering your standard coffees  teas  and baked goods.  Bennu also serves up Hoboken Pie pizza and Torchy s Tacos in the morning  assuring that you could actually sit there an entire day if you wanted to.  A few bits of charm also sneak out  like the charismatic baristas and the always entertaining chalkboard in the bathroom.  Still  like Epoch  the word is out on Bennu.  It s beginning to get more and more crowded  meaning you ll have to get there a bit earlier to camp out a study work spot.  In time  it may go the way of Epoch and become more of a social spot than a place to actually get some work done.  For now  at least  it strikes a good balance.
Bennu Coffee,398,I really  love  Bennu.   It feels like a library. It s spacious  giving everyone the freedom they need to do whatever it is they are camping there to do. The tables are all sizes - small to large. Many of the chairs are on wheels. The design of the room fully supports coffee shop camping - alone  with friends or with coworkers.  Plenty of power outlets.   The mocha menu  - it s what makes Bennu different from all the others. Hot or cold  these mochas are delicious. My favorite is the Don Quixote  amazing.   The real grandfather clock is the bonus add which sent me into a swoon  and keeps me coming back week after week.   Compliments to the designers of the space and of the menu  Job well done.
Bennu Coffee,399,Was Bennu named after the protagonist in this 1982 tv series   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fen.wikipedia.org 2Fwiki 2FThe_Phoenix_ 25281982_TV_series 2529 amp s c40f0e93f9828209e394ba4057f712c6054a265dbe7435e5cf03818923616f2c  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  en.wikipedia.org wiki Th   a  Yeah  that s also the guy who played Khan s son in Wrath of Khan.  I dunno.  bueno     satellite radio    many seats   many outlets   N-speed wifi    cool art   cool students   24 7   massive d.i.y. graffitti chalkboard in men s restroom  malo   -  raven  extra-dark chocolate mocha disappointingly average to bleh - hard lighting bad for writing implements in many of the many seats - barista says if manager sees you with  outside food drink  you will be thrown out - even if you have clearly purchased something from their establishment in plain sight  and even if you can t eat anything they have there due to your craptastic food intolerances.  -  5 credit card minimum  or .50 cent surcharge.  These guys should really be able to pull off a 5 star  but I want to give em 3.5 stars due to the ridiculous attitude of the  absolutely zero outside consumables  policy and bleh coffee beverage. But 24 7-ness and the n-wifi are bonus points for Bennu. We ll see how comfy they are when it s 100  degrees out  tho.
Bennu Coffee,400,I came here because this is one of the few 24 hour study places near campus. It s always super packed late at night  especially during UT s midterms.  Abundance of outlets. Really nice for studying if you can get a spot.  Coffee is decent  but again...I don t really know anything about coffee. They also sell Fricano s sandwiches and other little snackies.   My main reasons why I don t come back here too often  usually too crowded  most of the seats are awkwardly too low for the tables  and the lighting is really dim. Maybe staying home to study might be more comfortable   
Bennu Coffee,401,So I have only just discovered this place  but already I m a fan. I just moved to the North East Austin area  and was looking for a local coffee shop open 24 hours with free wifi and now I am hooked.  I instantly loved this place upon parking and entering. It has big open windows and a cool interior. It is a large open room with a variety of different seating such as  sofas and traditional kitchen tables. There is special lighting specifically for studying mixed with a home like environment with wall lamps. There is also an outside area. The atmosphere is comfortable  quiet and inviting.   I ordered a big mug of tea and it was only  2. They also allow you to open tabs  which is awesome for me since I stayed there awhile working. They have a large variety of coffee  tea  food etc to pick from.   I will definitely be back 
Bennu Coffee,402,I ve figured out the real reason why this place is awful  awesome    people are going to hit on you. If you want a new date  come here. They will pick you up.  I talked to some dude about this  If you look like you aren t studying hard  just wait 15 minutes.
Bennu Coffee,403,Come early to avoid the crowds. I d advise eating a solid meal before coming  but they do have snacks for the idle stomach  Pizza slices are Hoboken staples  and the Curry Chicken sandwich was good too  If you opt for the pasta  you d better like yours VERY al dente. Carrot cake is very good  but will satisfy your sweet tooth for a week. Coffee is good and cheap     I have discovered studying. And it is smooth. Smooth like the satellite radio jazz. Cozy like the corner with the hanging lamps. Solid like the two seaters by the window that everyone wants. Sweet like the whipped cream. Powerful like the zillions of outlets. I have discovered studying  and it is Bennu.
Bennu Coffee,404,I can study at Bennu for hours. Sometimes I question where the furniture has been  but garage sale theme has grown on me over the years of coming here. I ve never really had trouble getting a table here  but I tend to come early in the day and stay for a good while. The atmosphere is pleasant and friendly but can be a little too hipster for me sometimes. Free WiFi  and plenty of space inside.  One can never go wrong with their chai  whether it s dirty or regular  iced or hot  I can also vouch for some of their gourmet mochas including the Pride  amp  Prejudice and The Great Gatsby  if you re feeling indulgent. I don t typically get food here save for the occasional slice of pepperoni  nothing special but certainly satisfies my craving   though today my friend got a chocolate chip banana muffin for our group to share--it was pretty good so maybe I will visit the pastry section next time 
Bennu Coffee,405,Wow  I am disappointed with my experience here.  I walked up to the counter and waited several minutes to be acknowledged.  When the lady came up to greet me I ordered a breakfast taco to which she said we don t have that taco.  She was rude about it.  I proceeded to order a vanilla latte  and asked for 2  milk. She said vanilla latte with skim milk  I inquired about the 2  milk. She told me we don t have 2   but I can do a mix of whole and skim.  The breakfast taco was mediocre at best and the latte had weird art work.   All this said  I will not be returning to this coffee place.
Bennu Coffee,406,College students best friend. Long have I searched for a 24 7 coffee shop. Looks like my Starbucks gold card is going to collect some dust.   A cozy atmosphere is achieved through local paintings scattered across the walls  an assortment of comfy chairs lining every table  mugs and white bowl cups protecting the warmth of your coffee  and smooth music in the background.  The people are friendly. Outlets galore. Pizza and sandwiches are tasty  Big fan of the coffee. The intriguing names and cheap price keep you coming. My first cup was a  Pride and Prejudice.    Came here to try and be productive  and productive I became.
Bennu Coffee,407,Very nice coffee house in an area that needs more coffee houses.  The interior of this coffee house is one of the  nicest I ve been in - soothing greens and browns  low painted pressed-tin ceilings  tables  chairs and sofas all spread out a comfy distance from one another.  This is the place to come if you want a little elbow room and a gentle  relaxing color scheme with your coffee.  Lots of plugs everywhere. No loud music  at least not at 9pm last Saturday  so you can have a quiet conversation or listen to your iPod in peace.   Cappucinos are very well made - both hot and iced versions are very good.  I was particularly impressed with the chocolate chocolate chip cookie I bought.  It looked crunchy but was in fact wonderfully chewy and  fragrant with chocolatey goodness.  It takes a lot for me to specifically call out the chocolatey-ness of a cookie  so take it from me  this one was GOOD.  Flightpath is still my fav since it is in my  hood  but when I feel like branching out a bit  Bennu will be on the list.
Bennu Coffee,408,What      A coffee shop open 24 hours      One that doesn t require me to suffer annoying drunks  piles of pancakes  and blindingly bright lights   Wheeeeee        I work night shift  and I m a college student.  I also love me a good cup o  joe  so when I read about Bennu I knew I wanted to give it a try.  2 15 on Wednesday morning I show up and there are half a dozen people lounging in the comfortable cafe.  There is an odd  yet quite practical  assortment of chairs and tables in the cafe  as well as a few easy chairs and couches.  There are plenty of electrical outlets for the ubiquitous college student needing to plug in his dying laptop.  Okay  it looks good.  Now the real question  how is the coffee   I m a bit of a self-proclaimed coffee snob.  The stuff they serve at Starbuck s is not cappuccino  it s a cafe con leche.  12 ounce drink with 9 - 10oz of milk is not a cappuccino   A cappuccino has equal ratios of espresso  steamed milk  and milk foam.  Here at Bennu they got it right   I didn t have to ask for a cappuccino mug  either.  The Barista saw my book bag and served it properly instead of a little paper cup.  I was able to sit for hours and study.  Thank you.  Even though you are 20 miles from my house  you are only a few miles from work. I ll be back for more.
Bennu Coffee,409,Best 24 hour coffee shop in Austin. Hands down. This is a coffee shop done right  but it seems like a lot of people feel the same way. This makes it almost impossible to get a place to sit  inside  during the afternoons evenings since the student crowd tends to camp. This is the only reason I d give it 4 stars otherwise a 5 star place.  The Good  - Great coffee and espresso drinks  - Open 24 hours - Free Wifi - Spacious - Lots of seating  but look below at why this still isn t great sometimes  - Outlets near most seats - Serves veggie vegan friendly foods along - Uses environmentally friendly cups supplies  The Bad  - A bit too popular - Wifi tends to be slow during peak times with so many people using it - Furniture mis-mash. Some seats are pretty uncomfortable and some tables are wobbly. - Outdoors seating isn t great. Also beware of mosquitoes during the spring summer. - Does not accept American Express  The Ugly  - Students camping tables far exceeding their needs  1 student taking a 4 top or 5 top for themselves . Good luck getting a seat during mid-terms finals week. - Parking lot is usually full. Best bet is to try the street parking along Poquito St..  It s a great place to hold group meetings or just work from since it s generally quiet er  than other coffee shops  i.e. Starbucks .
Bennu Coffee,410,Austin is known for great coffee shops  and this one is the best of the best.    Whoa -- bold claim there  right   But I m serious.  Step inside to my 5-star review  fellow yelpers...  The good stuff   You expect certain things out of any coffee shop to be competitive.  The coffee was strong and tasty  try the iced coffee -- it s creamy  has little pellet ice  and some kind of almondy   vanilly flavor that made me sad to see the bottom of my glass after I drank it all .  The prices were good.  They re open all night and have free Wi-fi.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  The floors and bathrooms were clean.  The better stuff   You walk in and the place is enormous.  Huge  inviting couches.  Big workstations with clever hanging power-plugs at the tables.      They bring in fresh pastries  breakfast tacos  pizza  and other foods from local restaurants.  The place was obviously designed to be inviting  and to spend long hours there.    The best   Bennus has a unique character and energy -- art on the walls  groups of people engaged in thoughtful conversation  eclectic decorations and background music.  Very Austin.  I definitely recommend a visit -- I m a fan.
Bennu Coffee,411,I love this place. I ve been going every morning before work for the last six months. I love the staff there  it s cliche but they really do make you feel like family. Super real  down to earth baristas and damn fine coffee.  Big ups to Joe for making sure I always have cream in my coffee   But really  big ups to everyone on staff there Y all make the morning better 
Bennu Coffee,412,To your left  you have the hipster getting a juice and a vegan baked good to recover from last night s one PBR too many. To your right  you have the biker  who just got back from a 50 mile run to and from San Marcos   drinking a quadruple shot with a banana. Me  I was just there to study for my GRE.  You walk in here  and it is just stuffed with people. I do get a little claustrophobic in coffee shops  but I guess I made an exception on a Saturday morning.  There is a variety of seating for everyone looking to get their buzz  24 hours a day. The location is perfect for college students  Austinites  and athletes. On MLK  in close proximity to 35  Yes  please.  The offerings are fairly standard  caffeinated beverages  locally baked goods  and various juices. Best  Multiple outlets for those electricity-draining laptops.  Bennu is a go-to for everyone  so for convenience sake  I cannot just recommend ANOTHER Bennu-ite. But... for Yelp sake  Bennu is indeed a solid place to grab a cup of joe.
Bennu Coffee,413,Coffee and food are great and the prices are very reasonable.  The staff is very friendly  outgoing  amp  helpful.  I like the idea of the place being 24 hours and for those that don t have transportation  they are located right on the bus line.  If you have a laptop  they have plenty of outlets.  Many comfy couchs and chairs.  Parking is very limited in their private lot - there is parking on the street.  Music is a little loud in there and this place is a very busy place.  I like the fact they have handicap spaces for limited mobility.
Bennu Coffee,414,Bennu is a great coffee house for people who might like Epoch but are looking for  say  friendliness and a place to get work done. Epoch has slowly become more of place to be seen and to see your friends - Bennu is still a place where you can plop down with a book or a laptop and achieve something.   I ve noticed in recent months that more and more people are coming  which means that it s likely to become more of a social scene in the near future  but whilst we nerds have our hold on it  let s evaluate their worth  shall we    Pros  -The people who work here are friendly and fun. The comparisons to Epoch are probably tired at this point  but if we re still having fun with it  I d say that Bennu s staff is still happy to be alive  and they want you to be happy  too. -The bathrooms are exceptionally clean. Bonus points for a chalkboard  with chalk supplied  for all of your toilet-inspired witty-philiosophical opuses.  -The coffee is good. Some coffee houses tend to forget this key ingredient. The other drinks are good  too  if you re not into coffee all that much.  -They have good  though occasionally overpriced  food items  and they all seem to be local products  which should give you the happy-hipster-warm- amp -fuzzies.  -The seating is comfy.  -The atmosphere is friendly and the clientele more diverse than some other places that I ll stop naming.  ahem   Cons  -Lack of plugs in the middle of the room. I hardly ever see people sitting in the middle of the room with laptops unless they re Apples  so be  warned. Bring an extension cord during busy times.   -Frequently run out of parking spaces. Again  if you come during a peak hour  this will be a problem. But if you re close enough to bike  you re fine.  -Sometimes understaffed. For the most part  one person behind the counter is plenty  but sometimes during their more high-traffic hours  one person is not going to cut it. They seem to be trying to fix this  though.   Unquantifiable bonuses  -The last three times I have been there I have unwittingly witnessed things that later end up in the Missed Connections section of CL. So  y know  they ve got that going for them. -Every time I use the restroom here I giggle at the offerings on the chalkboard.
Bennu Coffee,415,Absolutely love it here. It s a great place to study and the coffee and iced tea is amazing. Definitely coming back every chance i get. The only downside is that everyone loves it here so much that you have to snag a table quickly if you can. If thats the worst thing about this place then it must be great.  I would recommend my friends to come but i don t want it to get more crowded haha
Bennu Coffee,416,I love coffee and all the fine secret things Knucky does to my coffee in the morning. I go at least twice a week and every time its perfection  Love the atmosphere and love working their. I get so much done  Cheers  
Bennu Coffee,417,I went here to get homework done and I was sitting there minding my own business. I had a Starbucks cup with me  so two coworkers come up to me and say I need to throw it away or leave. I told them I just bought it and wasn t going to waste coffee. They told me to leave and drink it outside then come back without it. I eventually was forced to purchase something in order to stay inside. Gave me a very bad impression  if they were nice to me I wouldn t be upset. But they were completely rude and condescending towards me because I had a Starbucks cup with me..
Bennu Coffee,418,The fact that they pulled their name from Egyptian Mythology is a plus for the geek in me. The fact that they have great French Press coffee is a huge plus   I ve been coming here since they ve opened. It amazes me that our fair city has a lack of 24 hour coffee shops. I used to go to Epoch  but lately feel like I m not cool enough to go there  unless I invest in some skinny pants or cut offs.  1. Tony in skinny pants is a no go...trust me on this. This is for YOUR benefit. 2. Cut offs and or capri pants on men. This should never happen.  ...back to Bennu. It s been great seeing them gain popularity. The amount of power cords  the number of tables  and the much more laid back atmosphere make it a great study destination. The baristas are always cool. Get there before or after peak times...you ll be glad you did. This place can fill up in minutes.
Bennu Coffee,419,One of my favorite coffee shops  actually probably in America - and I ve been to a lot of them  for various work reasons and just for a cup and a book. Deep menu  plus pizza and tacos. I m going to make mention of the beautiful Ari  one of the late night baristas. She s one of the swellest  nicest people I know. Bees knees  that one.
Bennu Coffee,420,I decided to give Bennu a try after riding past it on my bike one day after getting tacos. I m always on the lookout for a good coffee shop in which to park my ass  and today  this was the one.   My immediate reaction upon walking in was  wait  I didn t just walk into a furniture store  did I   The walls are painted a seafoam green  and there are tables with rolling chairs around them  as well as office-style desk chairs along one open wall. Though I was sort of put off by the lack of ambience  I still decided to get a drink. I m  funemployed  right now  having just moved to Austin 3 weeks ago  and am therefore on a  fudget   or a  fun budget  for those of you who are lucky enough not to be familar with the term. I got an iced drip coffee  and it wasn t horribly expensive   2.50 . There is an extensive mocha menu that I would like to try eventually. The service was fast  and the baristas were very nice and polite.   Though the decor had put me off in the beginning  does this make me a snob    I was able to select a very comfy couch  of which there are plenty  and all look brand-spankin -new . My coffee  DELICIOUS. I m not an expert  but it wasn t bitter at all. The music that was playing was reggae  and it was being played at an appropriate level.   This coffee shop is just getting on its feet  and I m excited to see how it grows and changes. Great location for us east-siders  and I heard that there will be a bike rack in place soon. The wi-fi is fast and there are tons of outlets.  This would also be a great coffee shop to have a group study session at  as there are tons of large tables to spread your books on. I ve also noticed some people having business meetings  probably because it s not  funky  and has a higher class  more  professional  vibe.
Bennu Coffee,421,Very slow internet connection and always understaffed - one person working behind the counter. There are not a lot of options for plugging in your computer if you re in the middle of the room - my friend brought her own power strip extension cord and others were asking to plug into it since they were also out of luck otherwise.  Their behavior towards my friend and the previous yelper  Jennifer G  probably solidifies my decision to go elsewhere. Refusing to serve someone who has their phone on because of a rule that is nowhere to be read....that s very bad in my book.
Bennu Coffee,422,Bennu Coffee offers good coffee in a very comfortable atmosphere. This is a great place for students to study.  But first  the coffee. Bennu uses good fair trade beans. The specialty here appears to be the wide selection of mochas. You cannot go wrong by selecting any one of their mochas. Just choose what sounds good to you.  Next  the food. Bennu serves baked goods  salads and sandwiches from local Austin suppliers including Torchy s Tacos  Russell s Bakery  Fricano s Deli  The Green Cart  and Hoboken Pies. The food is great and  if you get the munchies or want to seek out lunch during your study time  you don t have to leave. What s better than that   Second  the atmosphere. There are plenty of comfortable sofas  chairs  and tables to allow you to spread out and get comfortable. The tables have enough room for books and food coffee. The wifi is free and they have ceiling plugs  It s a pretty good setup. Check out the CLEAN bathrooms.  Third  the hours and location. Bennu is a 24-hour coffee lounge. I LOVE this. Not everyone ends their day and heads off to bed at 10pm. As far as parking goes  the lot is a bit rough and can fill up during busy times.  Finally  the ethics behind the business. Bennu is very community-oriented and they  seek to be a comfortable neighborhood coffee bar. They participate in local recycling and composting and support local charities. It s wonderful that Bennu is local  local  local.  Bennu is one of Austin s best neighborhood coffee bars lounges. With their knowledgeable staff  good coffee  tasty food  comfortable atmosphere  and clean bathrooms  there is no reason you should not visit at least once.
Bennu Coffee,423,I truly love this place  but I have to speak up and say something about a hygiene issue. In both locations  as I go to both several times a week  one of the baristas steps out to smoke a cigarette and comes back in and starts preparing drinks  without washing their hands. I understand that Austin is laid back  but this is almost an everyday occurrence in both locations. Please have your employees practice better hygiene  as you are serving food with your bare hands.
Bennu Coffee,424,I spend a majority of my time on the east side  specifically at Chicon and MLK  where friends of mine who enjoy videogaming live. Bennu is a perfectly good option if hearing a muffled Grizzly Bear album and the frequent female   Oh my god  you re studying here too    is prefered over a muffled Halo splatter and  FIVE MINUTES REMAIN   through your Walgreen s earplugs.  As drinks go  the special of the day was the most visible option  thus making a double espresso shot with milk and a flavor for  3.25 my order. The libation was poured  then  like the fleeting effects of a whippet it was gone  and I didn t really remember it.   Moral of the story  Perhaps it s worth  3.25 to get away from another Team BR. Or maybe you should just bike your ass to the library.
Bennu Coffee,425,Ask just about any graduate student in Austin where s he wrote the bulk of hir s dissertation  and s he will probably name one or two local coffeeshops. For me  it s Bennu  for myriad reasons.   The coffee  including the signature lattes  although I don t get those very often  is delicious  the food is mostly not disgusting  I suspect the pumpkin muffins from Russell s are preventing me from fitting into most of my clothes  also  I will never  ever understand the appeal of the Green Cart sandwiches  but that s another review . I like their creative non-coffee drinks  this summer s Lime and Punishment limeade  the fall s Honaker apple cider   and -- realizing that this is a totally stupid thing to include in a review -- their perfectly snowy crushed ice. Crushed ice is the only way to enjoy iced beverages  and I can t imagine an iced coffee without it.   Mostly  I love the reading-room feel of Bennu. Lots of shops in town have really crappy  uncomfortable seating  which communicates an unwelcoming vibe. I can t think of an uncomfortable spot at Bennu  and I like that they acknowledge and have created a space where people can feel welcome to spend an afternoon working there.  Although I really hope that campers make it a point to spend a few bucks or more every couple of hours.  The friendly and accommodating staff are just the icing on the cake.  My one complaint is the parking  but short of building a garage  there s not much they can do about that.
Bennu Coffee,426,This place is a haven for people getting work done. It would be a hard 5 5  but it is popular and it can be hard to find a table. That being said  I can usually find a table. I usually keep it simple with an iced coffee  but they have Hoboken Pizza in there which usually looks pretty good.   Definitely worth checking out.
Bennu Coffee,427,plenty of chargers. decent coffee. decent bathrooms. open 24 hours. the food  which is outsourced locally  is good. not too loud. they play some different kinds of music. I use soundhound quite a bit   needs more parking  a bathroom makeover would be good  some new furniture would be good.
Bennu Coffee,428,This is one of my favorite spots in Austin. It s not super close to my house but it s two blocks from my daughters  preschool. So after I drop them off I drive three blocks  order my soy latte and gluten-free  vegan muffin  plop down at the bar and study. It s my morning ritual of Monday s  Wednesday  and Fridays where I advocate for myself.   Bennu has become a special place for me because it reminds me of the days when I worked in a coffee shop. There isn t anything about this place that I dislike. It supports local artists  they don t use an automatic espresso machine  they make a huge effort to minimize waste  the music selection is  almost  always good  except that one time they were playing Mariah Carey  but I ll let that one lapse of judgement slide.   I ve been to dozens of coffee shops in Austin and Bennu is definitely my favorite thus far.
Bennu Coffee,429,There are three 24-hour coffee shops near me  Strange Brew  Epoch and Bennu   and Bennu is my favorite. They absolutely have the best coffee out of those three  and much better variety in food. I ll admit  I m kind of boring when it comes to coffee shops  I usually just drink simple black coffee  but unfortunately that leaves a lot of room for people to screw it up  but then again Bennu has never let me down. Bennu also has fantastic espresso and pretty good chai tea lattes.  The only problem with this place is parking  it s really pretty rough. I usually just ride the bus over to avoid that mess. Also  during finals week  you should absolutely avoid the place  I made the mistake of trying to go to study and it was so loud and packed in there. No matter how busy it is  though  I ve always been able to find a place to sit outside  but be warned  there are only a couple of tables that re covered  so sitting outside is obviously pretty hit or miss  plus it was cold as balls during finals week this year .  Another thing to note is that if you plan to just stop by and get a coffee  you ll need to have cash. They have a  5 minimum on credit cards which is a little irritating  but I do understand that it makes more sense for them as a business. It s never been a problem for me if I go chill there  I just set up a tab and get a few refills.
Bennu Coffee,430,Chill place. I love the setup  vibe  music  and people that occupy it.  What I don t like is the weak wifi and bad coffee.  Slow wifi means less productivity. Please fix 
Bennu Coffee,431,When you can t sleep and you feel like something is wrong with you... pass by this place with the lights still on at 2am and now it s like you ve joined some elite club or something  Even at its full capacity it s so quiet in here you can still hear yourself think  out loud  lol
Bennu Coffee,432,Pluses  Cute barista with a purple hat  great food selection  plug ins everywhere  open 24 hours  Minuses  refills are not free like they are at Dominican Joes  often extremely crowded.   I like the fact that no matter where I sit I can find a plug in and the staff is generally really nice. At one point I went in 3 or 4 days in a row and the staff acted like they had never seen me before. I used to work in a coffee shop and if someone came in more than once I would make more of an effort to treat them a bit better and maybe chat with them. This is not the case at Bennu and my only complaint.  P.S. I wrote  what s the name of the cute barista   on the chalkboard in the bathroom. Always fun to write on bathroom walls.
Bennu Coffee,433,I ve only been here twice but will definitely return.  However  I should note that you ll likely need to skip this place during prime time  probably 4-9 pm  while school is in session as its hard to sit down anywhere  this is a student destination for UT and students frequently fill the place.  I can t fault the owners obviously as effort has clearly been made by the staff to expand as much as possible  but its an issue.  This review was based on a visit while school is out in late December and I was very pleased.  Good internet  ok food  and the mochas we had   Wow.  Recommended  I ve had many variations on the  spicy  mocha formula and nowhere has come close to Bennu.  If you are a chocolate   espresso fan  come here.
Bennu Coffee,434,This is a place to study  and study only. It s super duper quiet inside  and everybody is super duper focused. The last few times here  I was not one of those people as I chatted away  quietly  with a friend. Bwahaha   Bennu is simply a cozy coffeehouse full of outlets and full of students. The drinks are good most of the time  though my last chai latte was super off  and the baristas are friendly. The furniture is varied  but never uncomfortable. So  if you re needing a place to concentrate  or to motivate you to concentrate  this is the place.
Bennu Coffee,435,I really enjoy this place.  When I first went here I honestly wasn t a big fan  I had been going to another local place that I preferred  and Bennu did seem a bit more pretentious.    However  all the people who work here are really awesome  super friendly  and I quickly changed my mind about that.  In the mornings I bring my son and they really enjoy him and let him play with a couple of random toys they have on the counter.    Also  I went recently and realized I had forgotten my wallet right when I walked to the counter  and they didn t even blink before offering to make me my coffee on the house.    Plus  the coffee is awesome  and their iced coffee  necessary summer beverage  is one of best in town.    Only issue is often  is it  ultra packed and you can t even find a place to sit  although I can t blame them for that since there is a ton of seating there  and they can t turn people away obviously.   Mostly students studying  which sucks b c they sit there forever in their study groups.  Also can t blame them  I was in their shoes  once as well.    I don t give 5 start reviews  nothing is perfect  ever  but this place gets 4 stars easily.
Bennu Coffee,436,One of my favorite coffee shops in Austin      Bennu is great because it has lots of outlets  lots of chairs and comfy couches  as well as tables to study at. It s close to campus and Open 24 hours    They have an amazing assortment of mocha s and teas  and even have a small menu with things to eat if you get hungry   I love coming here to study  or play games with friends. The atmosphere is perfect 
Bennu Coffee,437,First of all  all of those who are saying that they can actually study in this LOUD place might be slightly deaf or have selective hearing. If I had been trying to get some studying done when I went  it would have been the last thing I could ve gotten done. There s never any parking spots available  nor is there a table  much less a chair available. College students on laptops in every square inch of this place. There were even some tables with just one college kid taking up the entire four top. My friend and I had to go sit on a brick wall outside because all the tables were taken of course. We had actually bought coffee  unlike many of the students there who only came with their homework and laptops and friends  didn t see too much coffee or food around me . They were probably too hopped up on adderall to even need any coffee. Such a lame experience for a PAYING customer. This place is awesome  they have wonderful coffee and ambiance  but the hoards of college kids and no parking kind of ruins it.
Bennu Coffee,438,I m on the juice.  I get an Large Iced Bennu whenever I come.  It s like crack.  If you want spicy crack  which sometimes I do  you get the Scarlet Letter.  It involved dark chocolate and cayenne pepper.  Mmmhhmmm.  You can t argue with the 24 7 hours and the ability to park on site.  There is also free wi-fi and full of people working and studying who are courteous towards others doing the same.  I like to sit outside with my dog when it s inhabitable weather  but they are a lot of smokers who hang at Bennu.    My only two complaints are  1 they have tables outside that have consistent smokers and the last thing I want before I ve had my coffee in the morning is to walk through a cloud of smoke when I go in the side door.   2 If you end up in line behind two or more people and you have somewhere to be  it is a problem.  I brave the first issue all the time to get my crack.  The second issue is a deal breaker  but the only one who misses out is me and my colleagues who get me without caffeine on that particular morning.
Bennu Coffee,439,This place saved my sanity when my internet service suddenly died and could not be resurrected for several weeks. It s close to UT campus  has tons of outlets and comfy chairs  serves lots of yummy snacks for those late-night study sessions  and has very reasonably priced  and delicious  drinks. My personal favorite is the Iced Bennu  which is kind of like a Vietnamese coffee. They also have free water and three wi-fi networks.  Cons.. the internet is pretty slow when the place is packed  which is pretty often   and the small parking lot fills up fast too  but you can usually find street parking.  If you re looking for a good place to get some studying done or meet up some friends  I would definitely recommend Bennu. Just don t expect YouTube to load very fast.
Bennu Coffee,440,If I had gone today to study  I would have been very sad and probably not given a very good review update.  However  since I was here just for the coffee  it was wonderful  I got the Iced Bennu today  which I had never gotten before. It was surprisingly strong  yet extremely sweet and refreshing. I mark good coffee based on how strong and smooth the coffee is  and the Iced Bennu was completely on point.  And for only  3.25  I might have to spend more time at Bennu.  Recommendation  if you are planning on studying there  get there EARLY and go with someone who can watch your stuff.
Bennu Coffee,441,Great affordable menu and great atmosphere. I came here after a friend s recommendation and fell in love. My only wish was that it was closer to where I live. But I m willing to drive here and that says a lot because I hate driving.  My only peeve was having to wait five or so minutes to order. I thought the employee was in the back. No. She was having a personal conversation and didn t apologize for having me wait. Maybe I m picky but I think service like that can keep some people from returning. I m pretty forgiving in this case so I ll be back.  If you like to hang out at coffee shops this one offers lots of seating with access to lots of outlets and decent parking.
Bennu Coffee,442,I think I ve found my new study spot. They have a lot of variety as far as drinks go  and I ended up going for a second iced caramel latte. The seating is plentiful  with tables  chairs  couches  and some bar seating too  They did themselves a favor by having so many accessible outlets too.   It s the hipster coffee shop Portlandia warned you about  only the atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly.
Bennu Coffee,443,I am updating this review to say that this place has been overrun by undergrads.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing  but it makes it close to impossible to ever find a seat and to get any work done. I was there last night--11pm on a Saturday--and had trouble finding a place to sit      . This is either great for their business  and kudos if they re making money   or bad for it  squatters leaching wifi . I also had to endure listening to someone go on and on and on about creating a fake relationship with someone on Facebook and how FUNNY it was that people thought it was SERIOUS and OMG SHE IS NOT ENGAGED especially not to a GIRL because that would be GROSS. Seriously  she told the same damn story to THREE different people  And loudly  at that  I wanted to vomit...on her.  So  yes. Sad but true  Bennu is no longer the haven it once was. They have crammed every corner full of tables and chairs that it is difficult to navigate  especially when full  read  always . There are now power strips hanging from the ceiling  which makes things really convenient  but GOD is it ugly. There is usually only one or two baristas working  so a lot of the time you might have to wait for a drink.   That being said  the people that work there are really great. I ve had nothing but pleasant experiences  which says a lot  because there are a ton of snooty coffee slingers in this town. I especially like John in his Phillies hat  who is always friendly while being efficient. That man should get a raise  I also can t say enough about having a 24 hour coffee shop in my neighborhood.   Unfortunately  though  I am spending less and less time in my neighborhood shop  because it appears as though people are flocking from all over to snag a table. I can t blame them  but it certainly has knocked Bennu pretty far down on my list of places to get caffeinated and get work done.  Sigh.
Bennu Coffee,444,Two words  A MIE. Or one word if you re in a hurry  AMIE     The best god dang dingdangity flimflamity shimshamity barista in all THE EAST side . Go for Amie s expert coffee stylings  stay for the chill n spill  the beans  to a friend  everybody is your friend at Bennu.
Bennu Coffee,445,My friends and I visited town for Austin City Limits. The first morning in Austin  we discovered Bennu and made it our official morning drink   breakfast stop. We were there five mornings in a row  sometimes in the afternoon  too  for a fix.   Although it was clear from day one that we were simply not cool enough to frequent this uber-hip hangout  we stuck around anyway - the drinks were amazing  the food was delicious  the atmosphere was casual   chill and the staff was ridiculously friendly and enthusiastic. It s clear from the parking lot overflow that this is one darn good coffee shop.  This would honestly be a five-star review if we had skipped out on the visit we made on our way out of town. Exhausted and melancholy to be headed home  we stumbled in to order our last coffee from Bennu. On the way in  we even commented on how sad it was that it was our last pit stop.  Then  I was pretty much publicly shamed for ordering an iced mocha - eye rolling  dirty look  head shaking and angry muttering all included. I m not sure if I committed some major coffee indiscretion or if she was just having a bad day  but the barista was overtly rude to me and subsequently our entire group. She actually made my husband flustered as he attempted to order a muffin.   This was shockingly brazen rudeness for someone I was about to pay for an overpriced caffeine buzz.  To his credit  the man making the coffee was  per every other experience we had  absolutely friendly. However  I cannot get over this. I have never been treated like that at a business.   Unfortunately  this one horrific experience has completely soured my perception of Bennu. I can usually overlook poor service when purchasing a legit product  but I cannot handle blatant meanness. I most certainly would not return or recommend it to anyone in the future.   Find somewhere else where your coffee comes without a side of ridicule and harshness.
Bennu Coffee,446,Nice  chill environment.  Plenty of tables and chairs for you to study chat read do whatever it is you need to do.  I could bring my book or laptop and spend my whole day here.  Their baristas are pretty friendly too  and also super chill .  I like the vanilla latte here.
Bennu Coffee,447,I ve loved Bennu from the first time I visited  it quickly became my favorite coffee shop in Austin. Ample seating  great music  friendly baristas  and most importantly  enough outlets to accommodate lots of writers students artists.  In terms of food and drink  Bennu has some of the best options around. Sandwiches and wraps from Green Cart  veggie and pasta salads  pastries  and pizza from Hoboken Pie. The one thing I have noticed is that they are usually out of vegetarian pies  but maybe that is because I rarely show up before 9 p.m. But no matter  I can always find veggie food to eat whenever I am there. They have a fantastic tea selection  and their specialty mocha drinks are fantastic. I also like that it s April and I m still able to purchase hot cider. Delicious   The only drawback to Bennu is that parking spots can be difficult to find. But once you are inside  the experience is great.
Bennu Coffee,448,- 24 7    - GOOD coffee  including a selection of different  large specialty mochas - Healthy wraps  ok sandwiches and sides  a good-looking turtle cheesecake - Free WiFi - Clean bathrooms - Arty East Side crowd mixed with a few academic types. Make sure you are in the mood to be approached by interesting people while studying  - Varied music -- whatever the staff is feeling at the time -- played at a medium volume  plus a fair bit of neighbors talking  just a little loud for me to get real studying done  but it s fine when you re just hanging out  - Lots of mismatched tables and old couches - Plugs hanging and on walls to plug into - It can get busy during the academic year. The situation in the parking lot usually reflects the availability of tables inside.  I go here mainly for the great hours    It s like the 24 hour fitness of coffee shops  except independent and neater .
Bennu Coffee,449,Need some proof that the nerds have won   Come here.  They serve coffee in beer steins  hang power outlets from the ceiling for the plugged-in  and the eclectic seating avoids the uncomfortable results that many here have cited in Epoch.  The counter staff retain basic standards of friendliness and efficiency while projecting the kind of hipster cool that probably warned people away from the free Strokes show and gave them the skinny on the unpublicized show at the bar on East 6th.  Bennu is chill  it s clean  and it s relaxing  at least until the triple espresso kicks in.  Minus one star for not having lox on Sunday morning.
Bennu Coffee,450,OK Bennu Coffee... what is up with you charging me four different prices for the EXACT same thing every time I come here   I was charged  2.25   2.75   3.25  and  3.75 for the SAME Cafe au Lait   I was toally fine with the  2.25 but NOT with the  3.75. Most expensive cafe au lait I have ever paid for.   If it depends on the bartender  then the best bartender is the older guy  the worst is the younger guy.
Bennu Coffee,451,Don t get a taco here  stick to coffee. This place is probably great for students who need to study  but not so much for breakfast. Taco was soggy since they are brought in from elsewhere. Average coffee too.
Bennu Coffee,452,When I walked into Bennu s  my mouth dropped in awe due to the number of people that was there. Every corner  space of couch  and anywhere there was a place to prop up your laptop  there was someone there. I felt like I walked into a sweat shop  except they are all studying. I was surprised people were not hanging upside down holding tightly onto their computers.  Though I m not surprise  as this location is so near the University  this place looks like it s consistently hopping.   I came and got a cup of tea  was recommended the Strawberry Peach black tea. It was tasty  I ll give them that. I really like that they make their coffee from scratch from when the customer s order it.   I think that was my issue with this place also. There was 4 people in line  me in the back  and it took me 15 minutes just to pay.  I had them hold my card in case I wanted to get more tea .   It just seemed like a place with 68 people occupying the coffee shop  yes I had that much time standing in line  that they would have more than one person tending the drinks. He was the only person I saw working there.   Maybe the experience was circumstantial  but everything just felt dragged out and took forever. Three stars for their drinks and atmosphere.
Bennu Coffee,453,I read about Bennu on Yelp and have driven by it a few times since it s around my hood and finally decided to check it out - in a big way.  I posted an event there through one of my social groups and we had a great turnout of over 15 people.  I apologize to all the folks who were trying to study and what not on a Friday night but I don t think that we were too obnoxious.  The barista was awesome and whipped out the drinks as fast as he could - bless his heart   The coffee was great. One person in our group had 3 separate coffee concoctions because she enjoyed them so much  Moby Dick  Pride and Prejudice and something else  but everyone seemed to be enjoying their beverage of choice.  I personally had the Iced Chai with soy milk and it was very refreshing.  Some Hoboken Pie was ordered and devoured as well.  The atmosphere is nice and there is lots of seating and they have these cool chairs that roll around.  I definitely would recommend this place to my friends - especially the studious ones - and I am thinking about having my knitting gals meet me here as well.  There is a decent amount of parking as well.  This is a great time to check them out as well since the crowds seem to have thinned out.
Bennu Coffee,454,#NAME?
Bennu Coffee,455,I think I have found my next top favorite place to study.  This place is huge with large round tables all over the room and plenty of plugs for your laptop.  There is also a very cozy coffee bar nook right when you walk in.  In this nook  lined with halogen bulbs  you have direct light beaming down on your papers or laptop.   CERTAINLY will keep you awake    The lighting here is very nice.  Bright but not creepily white like a library would be.  To top it off  vegans  you have more than 6 different options from wraps to sandwiches and pizzas or pastas and salads.  Eat away   No worries  carnivores  your regular coffee shop items of the above are also available with plenty of meat.  I will be back  
Bennu Coffee,456,Cozy. Work got done. Chai was good. I approve.  Unfortunately  Bennu has become a victim of it s popularity. I hate it when there are no non-awkward seats left in a library coffee shop-type place  so you re doomed to a sad night of trying to make sure the person across from you doesn t think you re looking at him over your laptop. Next time  I ll probably just ask to sit with someone who s hogging a table.
Bennu Coffee,457,I love Bennu  One of my favorite spots when I was studying at UT. 99  of the people here are studying as well. A lot of people I know don t like how cramped it feels and how packed it always is  but I don t mind at all. Once you get in the study zone  Bennu is the best. There are several times that I ve spent the whole day studying here so I ve tried dozens of drinks and I ve never had one I didn t like. I ve had their pizza slices and their sandwiches and both are pretty good. Parking is a little difficult  so you may have to settle for street parking.
Bennu Coffee,458,I will admit  I can easily feel claustrophobic in public places  however  no matter how full Bennu may get  the table set-up and atmosphere is inviting and warm. They have plenty of outlets for computers  great coffee at low prices and really helpful staff. I will admit I am not a coffee expert by any means  but when I told this to the guy behind the bar  I was explained the processes used to make each drink and helped to pick an amazing latte that I will continue to come back for. They have a wide assortment of iced and hot drinks so if you don t want to take a big risk on  fancy  coffee drinks  opt for one of their famous mochas...the Pride and Predjudice is great    I m a college student so any place that I can sit  study  listen to a wide assortment of awesome music and feel comfortable is great  Props to you Bennu and keep up the good work   Edit  I almost forgot the assortment of food is great  Pizza  sandwiches  salads  desserts  and cookies...mmmm... Plus  they offer some gluten-free options  I have an allergy so this is a double plus 
Bennu Coffee,459,Good Coffee drinks. Crowded seating areas.  I like Bennu because they have a powdered chocolate option instead of the standard chocolate  sauce  that most places use for Mochas.   I order the  Pride and Prejudice  mocha  with only powdered chocolate. So I m not sure if that makes it just a Pride or just a Prejudice  but either way I call it tasty.    they have a big list of different mocha drinks.
Bennu Coffee,460,The seating in here drives me nuts  but the baristas are cool and friendly  the music is good  and sometimes wonderfully ridiculous   and they have a decent selection of food. The baristas have great recommendations on drinks  and the iced coffee is amazing.   Also  there are a million outlets  and a million dogs outside.
Bennu Coffee,461,Love  love  love their specialty coffees.  Had the Pride and Prejudice last time.  Will return to try them all.  Job searching is easy here since there is no fighting for electrical outlets  cords are extended from the ceiling   it s not too quiet and not too loud  and a comfortable set up.  Plenty of tables  chairs  and couches.  I didn t have cash last time  and hadn t been in a while so forgot I needed cash  but the guy was cool.  Told me he normally lets it go once for people but to have cash next time.  Noted.  Not that I m afraid he ll recognize me or anything  but I received the point.  I like that the place is 24 hours.  That came in handy when I procrastinated during projects while getting my last degree  and then needed 8 hours after midnight to get something done by a deadline.  Oh  and I think the chalkboard wall bathrooms are cool.
Bennu Coffee,462,My new favorite neighborhood spot  Coffee is great  I haven t  eaten there yet  but I ve been impressed with the selection  and I love that they have mismatched armchairs  couches  and tables.  Reliable wifi and outlets at nearly every sitting station are also a huge plus.
Bennu Coffee,463,mediocre at best ....coffee is the same its study hall for yuppies wont be going back....
Bennu Coffee,464,Stopped in for some coffee and a couple hours worth of work. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in by the sheer number of tables  work nooks  and sofas  This place is a great size  yet still feels warm and cozy. There are plugs hanging from the ceiling near pretty much every table  so there s no shortage of outlets for your laptop or cell phone. The coffee - I got the house blend - not much to speak of. Decent  but not the best I ve ever had. I d love to try one of their espresso drinks though  and their chai    It s open 24 hours  and it s NOT jam packed  at least right now  like Epoch always is. Why wasn t this open when i was a student    
Bennu Coffee,465,Bennu makes me happy.  Top spot to study work in ATX.  I love how they have a plug system through the ceiling- so even tables far from a wall still have computer juice.  A couple tips notes   Parking is scarce so you ll prob have to park down the street. They have a  5 minimum for credit cards. It can get really busy during the school year  so be prepared to share tables   24 hours   
Bennu Coffee,466,Okay so I decided to revisit Bennu and was pleasantly surprised to find that most of the things I complained about in my last review no longer hold true.   The music is fine  not always my favorite ever and sometimes it s a touch too loud  but overall it s adequate. The baristas lately have been WAY friendlier than the ones I encountered in the past  and I have been hitting up Bennu a few times a week so the friendliness isn t a fluke. Hooray   The coffee drinks themselves still aren t my favorite in town  but honestly I come here because I need a place to study when it s absurdly late  not when I m craving a perfect shot of espresso. But they re adequate  so it s all good. And the tea and food are tasty.  The pros from my earlier review still stand  clean bathrooms  the chalk disappeared though  what s up with that          lots of outlets  AND OPEN 24 HOURS.  Bennu  you have been forgiven. I hope we can maintain our relationship at least as long as I m still a miserable overworked student.
Bennu Coffee,467,In the spirit of trying something new  I finally made it over to Bennu last night.  Usually I ll go to Epoch on Friday nights  even though experience has shown me that it s not always such a good idea if one wants to get work done.  But why are we trying to get work done on a Friday night anyway     Based on a friend s recommendation  I ordered the Scarlet Letter mocha.  It was everything I hoped it would be.  Coffee  chocolate  and chili  with some cool whipped cream on top to contrast the hot drink.  Later  I came back and ordered what I thought was chocolate cake.  While eating it  my boyfriend decided  chocolate mass  was a better description.  Chocolate mass in a good way  of course.  Aside from the menu  I didn t care for the atmosphere.  I can understand why other people like it.  The place is quieter than Epoch  as well as cleaner and less crowded.  The staff is more attentive and the food selection is better.  But when it comes down to it  I think Epoch has a more natural feel.  Bennu  in contrast  feels contrived.  From the strategically  rugged  couches to the picture-framed chalkboards placed in the bathroom to prevent graffiti on the walls From the complete set of board games with boxes made to look like leather bound books to the pg-rated art on the walls.  Unfortunately Bennu exemplifies the kind of gentrification I have come to expect from the eastside.  And that s really kind of a shame  because were it not for the atmosphere  everything would be perfect.
Bennu Coffee,468,Love this place.  I recommend the Moby Dick for sweet coffee lovers.  It s fantastic they re open 24hrs as well  I loved that when I used to work nights.  Only complaint is the furniture is pretty worn and outdated but I guess it fits the Austin  cool  vibe 
Bennu Coffee,469,Alright so I actually give them a 3.5...   soo..this place has turned into the PCL due to the fact that is it 24 hours. i m not saying this is bad it just sucks sometimes because its always packed with nowhere to sit. but they did recently install more outlets which hang from the ceiling which is cool i guess.. as far as food goes i recommend you get an iced bennu with a warmed up pumpkin muffin and your day will be made 
Bennu Coffee,470,So I consider myself a bit of a food snob. Went to culinary school blah blah worked in restaurants blah blah. Enough about me and on to Bennu. I love this place and what they are doing. They opened up a 24hr shop on the East side to serve the East side. They don t market themselves to any one crowd. All are welcome. The service is friendly and for having only been open two weeks they really have their act together. Great coffee  friendly service  open 24 7  and no over the top prices. Whats not to love    As of now the crowd is mixed and I hope it stays that way.
Bennu Coffee,471,Bennu has pretty good coffee in a great working atmosphere. If you ve got to crank something out for work or school  and libraries aren t your thing  Bennu to the rescue. I also like to gl there to read.   It s often crowded  so it s not always easy to find.a seat. Many of the patrons are there to stay a while  too.   Overall  great quiet coffeeshop. And 24 hours too 
Bennu Coffee,472,I m a freelancer  so I m always trolling for good places to work when I get tired of the house. Bennu just jumped to the top of my list.   I was a little worried that I wouldn t find a seat when I pulled into the nearly full parking lot  but this place is loaded with seating  including couches  which I love . The decor would fall short for trendoid hipsters  but they have plenty of other places to go. The friendly barista  or baristo  he was a he  recommended an iced mate latte  since I was clearly lost in my deliberations at the counter  and it was super tasty and reasonably priced. Music was good and interesting but not off-putting. Also free wi-fi and outlets everywhere you look for laptoppers. Food is from local vendors  so not made on-site but still good.  Some of the cookies were gluten-free  for those with dietary restrictions who are normally tortured by the sweets displays at cafes.   Lots of seating  lots of outlets  friendly service  and yummy food  amp  bevs--this place hits the mark.
Bennu Coffee,473,We just moved to this side of town and Bennu has quickly become our go-to  Perfect place to walk to and hang with our pup on the outdoor patio or to swing in and grab a cold brew and taco on the way to work  Plenty of parking  seating indoor and out and even when there s a line  it moves quick. Last but definitely least  the staff is such a high point -- always friendly  prompt but still open to conversation and making rad recommendations  Thanks  Bennu  
Bennu Coffee,474,I always instantly like a place that is open 24 hours a day  even IHOP. That being said  this place is better than IHOP.  The menu is eerily similar to that of epoch  but there aren t a zillion people swarming the place  yet  that is. My iced tea was good  tasted just like tea. Prices were good  about average  nothing too spectacularly cheap  but nothing expensive either. There is just something about the way the place is decorated that makes me less comfortable than at epoch  the art was a little too imposing  the way the tables were set up made me feel kinda weird  like everyone was watching me. But it s possible I just chose the wrong table  I m definitely going to go back and give it another try  good place to go when epoch is too crowded to get a seat.
Bennu Coffee,475,Continuing my search for a good place to study...  On a beautiful day my friend and I decided to try out Bennu Coffee east of I-35.  It took us about 15 minutes to get there from campus because of all the traffic lights.  We found the parking lot to be completely full  so we just parked on a side street with no problem  and still walking distance from Bennu.  Outside there is a stone laid patio with 10 or 11 square patio tables for four.  What I LOVED was that there was a set of four outlets for almost every table outside and free WiFi   There are no umbrellas  but you can find some shade by hiding behind some of the palms bushes they have to one side.   I have been in search of a place outside from campus libraries and my apartment where I can hear myself think and not be tempted to people watch. So Bennu has achieved 1 2.  There really was only a couple of girls that were there for chats  everyone else had their heads down working on reading something - people watching habit avoided   On the other hand  the music was too loud for my taste  never mind the kind of music IE.  that s not funny  -- what  I heard one woman talking on the phone about how much she loved this place  and proceeded to hang up the phone and put on her noise reduction headphones   No wonder she loves this place she doesn t have to listen to anything  Note to self  invest in noise reduction headphones.  They have pretty good smoothies of different flavors of decent size for  4.25  slightly overpriced I would say  but what cafe isn t  The girls next to me had a couple of different muffins and iced coffees that looked delicious as well.  Unfortunately  my search for the perfect study spot will continue  but I might come back to hang out here with some friends for a slightly different scene.
Bennu Coffee,476,This place has always been a pretty good place to chill  read   amp  study. Unfortunately there is no where to sit usually. You have to get there at midnight to find a spot. The rest of the time it s just packed.
Bennu Coffee,477,Part of me wants to trash this place just so nobody goes here.  Yes  it is that good  if that makes any sense at all.  My sister first dragged me to this place  bc of all the great yelp reviews -- in my head  I was thinking   24-hour coffee joint   since I have yet to really meet a 24-hour-anything that has agreed with me.  But this.totally.does.    Tiny patio off to the side  which is fab for little coffee chats -- otherwise  inside  you re definitely having to use your inside voice because  everybody  is studying here.  So  I suppose if you re looking for that sort of space  definitely come here   But even though I ve long been out of school  I heart this place and go back as often as I can -- huge  awesome  coffee mugs of their gourmet mochas  give me a Raven or Great Gatsby in a NY minute   and for  such  a decent price  it is ridiculous.  Although  erm  Benuu  please don t raise your prices  D  And I second the review of the A  Hoboken slice -- surprise   Seriously decent food  and pizza  no less   at a coffee shop is a little unheard of in my book -- Hmm  maybe I ll have to hit this place in the uber-near future...
Bennu Coffee,478,I really like this coffee shop.  The interior is comfy and eclectic with lots of outlets. The baristas have been extremely friendly every time I go. And you gotta love that it s open 24 hours.   Pizza by the slice - yum   Iced  bennu - yummy deliciousness   I wish there were an actual patio and more parking. But the vibe is cool  the music is pleasant without being intrusive  and fellow customers are nice.  Will definitely be back 
Bennu Coffee,479,Oh how I love Bennu  The Scarlet Letter makes my heart smile. And I just adore their staff  too. At first I felt like I was cheating on Epoch when I would venture across town for my little treat  but eventually I just moved into the neighbourhood so that I could justify my delicious affair... proximity.   Sadly I ve now moved back into the North Loop area  amp  don t get over to Bennu very often. I miss my spicy coffee. But  I do still love Epoch. I love them both... in different ways. Maybe I can learn to juggle them equally.
Bennu Coffee,480,Cool place and environment to work in  but the music sucks at night and is too damn loud. Someone needs to visit Europe -- they have it right there at just about every cafe you go to. They all just play the top Spotify stations.
Bennu Coffee,481,Love the addition of a 24 hour coffee shop to the east side ....obviously so do lots of other people  since it s packed every time I ve been.  The coffee s good and they have an extensive Mocha menu for those late night sweet cravings.  Bennu carries lots of local food and their pastries are from Russell s  which makes them fabulous and made with only the best ingredients.  Hopefully the newness will wear off and there will be a few open seats from time to time.  Lots of plugs for laptops  cozy chairs and tables  quiet atmosphere.   Only draw-back other than the popularity is the temperature...it s been pretty hot in there each time I have been in.
Bennu Coffee,482,24 hour coffee...in my neighborhood      I waited what seemed like forever for this place to open and it did not disappoint     I cannot comment on the whole children thing though because I don t hang out in coffee shops so I haven t noticed.  I would imagine that would sorta be a downer though but it is a neighborhood business and neighborhood business  tend to like to stay in business long after you graduate from college  move when your lease is up  or what have you....they are in business for them..not just for you.  I didn t notice if they had a smoking porch  i d be more inclined to stay longer if I could smoke while drinking coffee....coffee and smoking is a perfect marriage.   Besos and keep up the good job   P.S. to the person who got sick  food poisoning take at least 18-24 hours before you feel the effects of it.  your body was probably in shock from not eating for 24hours and then you fed it crap.  how many coffees expresso s did you drink that day   maybe a vodka on your lunch break   think about the way you spent your day before you trash a business.
Bennu Coffee,483,Crazy and quirky this place is great. Not too loud  friendly staff and lots of outlets. You can spread out  host a meeting and get to work. Their coffee is fun and quirky just like them. Solid breakfast tacos too.
Bennu Coffee,484,The BEST little hole-in-the-way  coffee spot in Austin. This place is the bomb  The coffee is amazing  the staff are super dope  and it s open 24hrs  I recommend the Iced Soy Raven....it s the shiz-nit.
Bennu Coffee,485,I headed out to find a nice coffee shop to study for my summer class  which is ironically titled Motivation but I can t manage to study for.  From the outside  this place looks a little iffy.  I ordered a regular coffee and was pleasantly surprised to get a yummy  strong cup in a cute cup complete with saucer.    I plopped down on a comfy leather couch close to the counter.  The night I was in  there was a trainee on and I got to hear a lot of cool tidbits about the history of certain drinks such as the origins of a Cafe Americano and how Barcelona espresso is different from others  etc.  These guys really know what they re talking about   I also got to see all of the concoctions coming out and hear all of their original names  as well as catch wafts of the food.  My only complaint is that the lights seemed a little too bright and exposing than I expected from the cozy environment.  But even the bathroom here is quaint with an antique vanity and rocks in the sink  so I ll be back 
Bennu Coffee,486,Finally went to Bennu today  after hearing much about it. Indeed  it was packed  surprising for a Saturday afternoon. I had an iced coffee and a slice of their self-titled pizza from Hoboken  the Bennu  in case that was ambiguous .  Twas delicious pizza and good coffee. I sat at the counter and read and eavesdropped on the baristas. They were funny  and sang along to the Lauryn Hill that was bumpin  in the place.   I really liked it. It was sunny and had a nice ambiance. I will certainly come back  though my studying days are over... sigh 
Bennu Coffee,487,This little East Side gem is definitely worth checking out. It s very spacious both inside and on the patio  and there s plenty of table space and power outlets  making it a great place to get work done.  And since they re open 24 7  it doesn t matter what your work schedule is.  My first visit here wasn t as good as it could have been because my coffee was a bit burned.  But everybody messes up occasionally  so I ll give them the benefit of the doubt.  I ll definitely be back here  and as long as the coffee is better next time  this place will probably supplant my current coffee work venue  the Hideout Coffeehouse on Congress.
Bennu Coffee,488,dank ass cold brew form God or some shit. Make me feel like acting my heart out bro. I m not here to study or none of that shiz. I m here to grab some brew son and get back to Hollywood.  blessedcoldbrew
Bennu Coffee,489,Drove by this spot I pass all the time on my home to the east side. Whoa  What the    A 24 hour coffee shop on the east side  Who would have thunk it    Hot choco is delish according to my man who got it. My gunpowder hot tea  Yummy   Now if only I could get Zhi tea over here my world would be perfect 
Bennu Coffee,490,I like this place a lot.   My coffeeshop has always been Epoch but I think I will definitely be coming here now.  PROS  1. Tons of outlets 2. Better seating than Epoch  aka no sinking couches  3. Good lighting  so you dont have to read in the dark 4. Non-distracting music  but still good music  CONS  1. The internet kept cutting out  but I suppose that s what happens when you first open and are trying to figure things out 2. Not as many places to sit as Epoch  but still plenty of places  I also wrote about it on my blog and posted some pictures if you re curious    a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Flesmerles.blogspot.com 2F2009 2F04 2Fbennu-is-new-epoch.html amp s c282186d216c0debecee3281703c92c7e345ba2e22e72065825b790271cbff04  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  lesmerles.blogspot.com 2   a 
Bennu Coffee,491,I visited this place for the first time just last week  despite living only a few blocks from here.  The atmosphere is great  and its very spacious - the layout reminds me of Epoch Coffee.    They have a good supply of snacks  and the coffee was good  although I m no coffee connoisseur.  Its a great place to bring a laptop  there is plenty of power outlets.
Bennu Coffee,492,Trying this new joint out right now as I write this.  I love that it s so spacious with lots of natural light from the large  open windows.  Nice hardwood floors and homey  but not dirty feel.  Honestly  I can t say their coffee is significantly better than my other java haunts  but I do love that they re open 24 hours for insomniacs like myself   Also  their food fare appears to all be outsourced like most other coffee shops in Austin  so nothing special there for me.  They do have a pretty wide assortment of mochas which I hope to try next time.  There s about a dozen of them and they all sound super yummy.  I had a short  double Americano which I always use as my benchmark to compare coffee shops.  Theirs is average  but the pleasant ambiance makes up for that.   
Bennu Coffee,493,I don t think I ve ever came to Bennu and have it be empty. There always seems to be a crowd  whether its a weekday or not  or whether it s the summer or the school year. The place has that  Austin-y  hole-in-the-wall  in the best way possible  feel that is somehow both gloomy and comfortable. This coffee shop is packed to the gills with tables and couches and has 2 counters to sit at.  However  I m conflicted on how I feel about this place as there are both major good and bad things about this place.  The Good  I can usually find seating when I come here  parking is another thing altogether . However  just a word of warning  if you want to find seating 95  of the time at Bennu you can t be scared of sharing tables with complete strangers. The specialty drinks they have here are pretty good  i.e. the Moby Dick . There are wall jacks everywhere  and the wifi is decently fast  I can stream music or stream youtube videos without too much trouble . A BIG PLUS is that it s open 24 7. Out of all the coffee shops I go to I think this is my favorite place to go by myself on late night stints as the lighting and atmosphere make me feel like I disappear into the background and am unseen by others.  The Bad  The music. I like a wide range of music genres and also have a high tolerance for background noise. However  the type of music  and the loudness of it here is a bit annoying. It s nothing that a pair of earbuds or headphones can t fix  but it has bothered me on more than one occasion as there are times when I prefer  quiet when concentrating. It s not like every song sucks  but there are definitely songs mixed in that are terrible for studying or chill conversation and detract from the environment. Next  I m not a huge fan of their Lime Punishment drink or the Iced Bennu. Both came off watered down  and I ve had the iced bennu more than once hoping it was just a bad day . With better drinks on their menu  it s just not worth the money to go after these 2 drinks for me.  If I could I would give it 3.5 stars. But yelp forces me to choose  Darn you yelp   shakes fist   and I decided to give it 4-stars because i believe the good outweighs the bad. Just bring headphones or stay away from the speakers when you come here and you ll be fine.
Bennu Coffee,494,The atmosphere at Bennu is very relaxing and laid back  making it a fantastic place to chat with one or two people. It is a very popular spot to study or work because of the good wi-fi. Since it is well-liked  seating may be an issue unless you are down with sharing space with strangers - and let s face it - you should be if you live in Austin. I have never been here during the actual peak hours  though. It is great for hanging out late at night or on Sundays  since it s open all the time. The coffee is good and the service is always friendly and great. Plus who can resist those creative names for the coffee    Their furniture needs something of an update  though  as the couches have most of the springs taken out of them and are therefore prone to eating people alive... Just making it a point that poor drunk folks who think that coffee will help them sober up will definitely not be able to manage getting off  or should I say out of  their couch in a dignified fashion. Add strapless tops and minis to this mix and I am sure any attempts to rise from the couch would deserve a Tosh.0 mention. Don t worry - you can STILL get vintage furniture that isn t this old and worn. Plenty of that exists in Austin  and on Austin s Craigslist .
Bennu Coffee,495,I ve been here three times now  and the experience has been consistent. Drip Coffee-- good. cheap. French Press Coffee-- excellent. Breakfast Tacos-- delicious. expensive.  Bathrooms-- very tidy pretty. Lighting Seating-- abundant. Music-- quiet. Staff-- friendly. one guy recommends a coffee he thinks you ll like.  The seating is more comfortable than Epoch  and the place is cleaner. However  I think Bennu is lacking some of the personality of other places. All of these can be attributed to the fact that this place is pretty new.  Oh  and they do Twitter deals  if you re into that  which is kind of cool.
Bennu Coffee,496,If you had told me that there was a cool  open 24-hours coffee shop right by MLK  amp  Chicon  I wouldn t believe it. That is  until I saw it for myself just today.  Bennu Coffee must be pretty new  but they re already making connections with the community. I don t know the backstory behind this place  but they already have baked goods from Russell s  breakfast tacos from Torchy s  and pizza from Hoboken Pie.  What struck me after a few minutes was that the place really reminded me of Epoch. Well  the music didn t  I don t think any coffee shop has a soundtrack like Epoch s   but on top of being a 24-hour coffee shop with pizza slices  the barista there I swear I ve seen working at Epoch not too long ago. Maybe I ve been taking in too much espresso lately  hooray Americanos   but Bennu could be an eastside Epoch if the tables and seating weren t so neat and organized  unlike Epoch s beat-up couches.
Bennu Coffee,497,Open 24 hours  Great Atmosphere  Nice people  Good vibe   Could have a wider drink selection but me likey 
Bennu Coffee,498,I am always on the search for the perfect coffee shop to get work done in and had been into Bennu before but just to grab a quick iced coffee. Their drinks are ok  not the best but not the worst. The barista who took my order was extremely rude. I asked what her favorite thing to eat was and she told me to  look in the case  where all of their sandwich options are. Charming  It s very crowded which is usually the sign of a great coffee shop but like I said the drinks are not the best. Agree with other reviewers on the music too  it is truly awful.
Bennu Coffee,499,If you can get near the place  Bennu Coffee is so awesome. Everyone that works here is really cool and friendly. The coffee is delicious and the space is set up to make it easy to set up camp and work.   It s totally that great neighborhood coffee shop you wish you lived around the corner from so you could visit it more often. Heck  I watched several people walk over from the nearby neighborhood.  Either way  you can t go wrong with Bennu. Oh  Their Iced Bennu is seriously tasty.
Bennu Coffee,500,The staff at Bennu Coffee are awesome. Everything from greeting me with a smile or mindless small talk. I would recommend spending your time working or visiting at this coffee shop when on the east side.
ATX Cocina,1,Everything was delicious and surprisingly. Had no idea how much food we ordered  but all was very good. We got Brussel sprouts  salmon  quesadillas  street corn  sopes  guacamole  and ceviche. Def recommend the street corn and ceviche  but everything was great.  The ambiance is very hip. Love the table settings and fun takes on food.
ATX Cocina,2,This was my first visit to ATX Cocina and I thought it was pretty good. Be careful  you can easily fill up on all the delicious appetizers. Guacamole was good  queso fundido was excellent and my friend states the brussels sprouts were good as well. A lot of options on the menu but unless you re well versed in Spanish  you might have to look up a lot of the options  Fortunately our waitress was very nice about explaining what everything was. Most of us got the machete because we were pretty full from eating the apps. It was a  flatbread  of sorts made of masa and filled with beef short rib  cheese etc and folded over like a taco. The portion was pretty large for what we were expecting  I didn t get the chance to order the esquites but I definitely will the next time we re there. At the end we finished with the Helado which was horchata ice cream garnished with caramel popcorn    Almost forgot to mention drinks  La Cura was delicious and an interesting combination that I ve never had before with a kick of habanero.  3 from the cost of the cocktail is donated to the Lone Start Paralysis Foundation  The margaritas were excellent too.   The only thing that was a bummer about this place is that it s so noisy. It was a Wednesday evening and wasn t overly packed but we felt like we had to shout to one another over the noise. We also stood at the hostess stand for a long time even though we had a reservation. They said they were going to check to see if the table was ready and didn t come back for 15 minutes  By then a big line formed out the door and those behind us asked us if we had even been helped. ha   I just think if you re going to spend this kind of money  the customer service should definitely be on par.
ATX Cocina,3,I ve been to a ATX Cocina a handful of times  this time we came for my best friends birthday. We had a table of 8. The service was really great. They brought out dessert for her at the end with the candle in it which was very sweet. And everything we had to eat was very good  the only thing I still can t wrap my head around is how expensive this menu is. Like I said the food is really good  but it doesn t mean that your entr e at a Mexican restaurant should be 40  dollars. I would like to come back pretty often  but can t afford to spend that much money every single meal. I have my receipt attached so you can see what we spent. For 8 of us to split it came out to over  80 girl. We did family style too so not everyone got their own entree.   Pros  tasty food  amp  drink  good service   Cons  overpriced
ATX Cocina,4,It s one of the best upscale Mexican restaurants in Austin. ATX Cocina is a MUST if you are in town  I had an incredible experience  and I can t wait to go back when I am in town.  I ve noticed the tables are a perfect for large groups  dining experience. So it would be a perfect place to celebrate birthdays with friends or just have a big family dinner. Great service and ambience  not to mention the cool open kitchen.   All the dishes that we ordered were very flavourful and perfectly balanced  not to mention beautifully presented. I loved their vegetarian and gluten-free options   The drinks were amazing as well  especially my margaritas     Highly recommend making reservations. This place is always crowded  yes even on weekdays  but if you are just passing by Austin or forgot to make a reservation  the wait is WORTH it 
ATX Cocina,5,This review is based on the happy hour menu. The the guacamole was decent and we re served with fried tortilla chips. The chicken taco was dry and underwhelming. The salmon fish taco was good  it was fatty  juicy and had nice angle hair pickled cabbage.  The margaritas were okay it tasted like a typical margarita you would get at an all inclusive resort.
ATX Cocina,6,ATX Cocina is a hit all around - food  drinks  service  ambiance - it has it all   The place is decorated with neutrals and soft tones that make it feel high class. For our private party they had a table for us tucked away behind a curtain in a private room. Since we had a large group we did a pre-fix 3 course meal that was delicious    Highlights include  - expertly dressed Caesar salad with amazing parm crisps  did you know it originated in Mexico    - the spicy marg was very good  get the large - Carne Asada  the steak was cooked perfectly with a delicious mole sauce - Big Glory Bay Salmon  my FAVORITE of the night  I honestly don t think I ve ever had a salmon so big that was cooked so perfectly. It was not overcooked in the slightest. The caramelized rice and macha-ponzu sauce that went with it took the dish over the top. If you are trying to decide what to get  you cannot go wrong with this entree.   Would 100  recommend this place  Excited to return and try the crudo.
ATX Cocina,7,Make reservations can be much better if you do it 3 days ahead  and HH on Friday is not very crowded  but the time slots could be out 2 days before. Happy hour has 3 items  margaritas  tacos  chips and guacamole. The in house chips and guacamole is decent  and I recommend the fish tacos. The sopes are pretty flavorful. Overall the food is fine but nothing too special.
ATX Cocina,8,Atx Cocina is one of those restaurants I ve heard a lot about  but never had the chance to try.... Until now    I was SOOO excited  I knew I had to order an appetizer. I started with the cocina guacamole along with a drink. I wanted a play on a pi a colada  and that s exactly what I got  without all the sugar     The guacamole was clearly fresh and was beautifully presented. Super tasty and a great start to the meal.   For dinner  I ordered the carne asada and brussel sprouts as a side. Now  the cane asada was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. The seasoning of the brussel sprouts was AMAZING.... BUT... it isn t whole brussel sprouts it s just the leaves. I wish this was more clear on the menu because it wasn t filling even though it tastes great.   Finally  I ordered the empanadas  I ordered them as an appetizer but they forgot to give it to us until it was mentioned. They whipped them up really quickly though . I thought they had great flavor  but I don t know that I d get them again. I don t know if the corn was too thick or if it had a bit too much grease.   I definitely want to come back and try a few more things on the menu because everything was truly amazing.   The waitstaff was nice and responsive  the restaurant has a great layout and vibe. I would highly recommend trying it 
ATX Cocina,9,Richard was outstanding. he knows his menu  he knows his food.  Most importantly he knows hospitality.  Beyond authentic. Mexico Haite cuisine that will tantalize your taste buds.  We will definitely be keeping this exquisite restaurant on our favorites.
ATX Cocina,10,Modern Mexican done right  We came for Happy Hour just drinks and some appetizers and ended up staying longer than expected. The drink are definitely once of a kinda hand crafted and definitely delicious but my rating is for the food. I know Mexican good and everyone tasted homemade. We had the guacamole  fish tacos on happy hour and the pulpo and chorizo tostadas and they were amazing  It s not your moms kitchen but it s authentic and homemade from scratch and modern    However the star of the night with the back bartender Angel who was super attentive and provided amazing service and attention to detail    Definitely coming back on mg next Austin trip 
ATX Cocina,11,My group had such a fun time at ATX Cocina  Our waitress was so kind and brought us salads on the house when the kitchen was a bit backed up. Not to mention the Caesar salad is absolutely amazing  We all loved our food and drinks and the overall atmosphere at ATX Cocina. I highly reccommens the roasted chicken and the fish tacos to eat  and the spicy marg to drink  We will be back 
ATX Cocina,12,Oh my gosh this place is incredible  I didn t have a reservation but if you are patient you ll be able to get a bar seat. The bar seat atmosphere is amazing and you really feel like you re at a community table not a bar. The drinks and food are out of this world.  Drinks  the Paloma was delicious  The Coco Loco is out of this world  an elevated pina colada  Food  must order the Guacamole and salsa   I wanted the El Jefe but it s more of a family style meal. The carne asada  medium rare  is absolutely out of the world. You just have to order it  The molotes were also so good with a little hot kick from the sauce. This is a spot you have to go to if you re in Austin
ATX Cocina,13,Fantastic food with good ambiance  I was hesitant about how good the food could be to justify the high prices but I came away thoroughly impressed. Some must get items  octopus and chorizo  halibut  salmon  Brussel sprouts. Portions are large and definitely meant to be shared.   Really great place to bring out if towners or work dinners.
ATX Cocina,14,Good food.. awesome drinks and great ambiance.. Totally recommend the place.. a bit on the pricer side
ATX Cocina,15,Austin food scene is incredible and ATX Cocina does not disappoint when it comes to authentic style Mexican cuisine. The overall cuisine reminded me of restaurants in Mexico city and Oaxaca.   We dines as a party of four and had great oysters that rotate daily in the restaurant  shared guacamole  papas  potatoes  and esquites  street corn  appetizers  octopus tostada  several fish crudo and mushroom masa and duck main course.   All dishes were very innovative  yet somehow they felt authentic as well. Oysters were incredibly fresh so was fish crudo. Potatoes and corn are very flavorful with generous amount of spice.  Tips   Parking is tough  however garage is right around the corner. This is downtown  so beware of traffic. Restaurant has a wonderful patio  which is great when weather is good. It is quieter than indoor dining option.
ATX Cocina,16,I ve heard a lot of buzz about ATX Cocina and now I understand why. Their food is so fresh and everything I ate had a balanced variety of flavors.   I met a friend on a Tuesday evening for happy hour and was surprised that by the time we left  around 7 30  how busy the restaurant was for a weekday  Many people were dressed up like they were hitting the town after dinner.  I prefer the fish tacos  2 tacos  off of the happy hour menu and the guacamole. I really enjoyed both. The fish tacos had a sauce that really made them stand out.   The only reason I took off a star was due to their service. Our server was kind and attentive  but they got our order wrong the first time and it took about 15 minutes for them to stop by our table and realize we hadn t gotten the right order yet and then another 15 minutes for it to arrive. This was in additional to the time we already waited for our food before we realized it was incorrect. They apologized  but that was it in terms of making it better. I ve heard good things about their service  so I m hoping this was a one off scenario.   Don t want to forget mentioning their margaritas. Get them on the rocks. You won t be disappointed.
ATX Cocina,17,Came into atx Cocina last weekend  and I am still dreaming about the phenomenal meal I experienced here. We came during a bachelorette party  with 14 of us in the group. The reservation was made well in advance  and we were able to sit at a massive table that had plenty of room for all of us. Because of the size of our group  we had a prix fixe family style meal. And let me tell you  this was honestly one of the best meals I ve ever had.   There was so much food on the table  we were unable to finish every single dish that came out to the table. Some of my favorites was the Cesar salad  the salmon  and the nachos.   The Cesar salad was out of the world. I don t even usually love Cesar salads  but there was something about this one that was so fresh and insanely good  The nachos were an appetizer that came out  and it was served more tostada style. And was more of an elevated nacho  with fresh sauces and vegetables on top. The salmon was truly one of the best salmons I ve ever had. It was perfectly cooked  and came over a bed of crispy rice. Every single thing on the menu blew me away  but those three dishes were my favorite. For dessert  the flan was exceptional. I wouldn t even consider myself a flan fan  but here it was something I d highly recommend ordering.   I m already excited to come back to atx cocina  to order some of my favorites as well as others off the menu. Because the food here as well as the drinks  are phenomenal.
ATX Cocina,18,Had my birthday party here  party of 10. The family style meal sharing was perfect and so delicious. Drinks impeccable. Ambience was nice. Service was incredible. Thank you for a wonderful evening.
ATX Cocina,19,How do I describe ATX Cocina  modern Austin Mexican is the best I can come up with. Walk in and its modern focus more on the younger people. Not really for kids. It has an open kitchen with small rooms and glass separating tables and rooms in a modern somewhat ambiance.   We started out with the Cocina Guacamole. Everything is always bigger in Texas. The chips were huge and the guacamole was really good with a little kick to it. Also  had the Sopes which are small little bite sized with pork and beans. Very good. Very tasty. Really enjoyed it but you only get 3.   For dinner  I got the Pollo Asada. Chicken we cooked really good. Not dry at all and juicy. Really like them giving small street sized corn tortillas with the chicken. Really good. As a side we got the Brussel Sprouts. Seemed like they where fried Brussel Sprouts leaves. Really good. Really tasty. Enjoyed it all.   My wife got the Bay of Fundy Salmon. Huge piece. Very week cooked. Very tasty and my wife really enjoyed it.   My son got the carne Asada. Very good. He loves it and he s pretty picky. So he enjoyed it. Very good and got a bite. So he was very happy. Loved it all.   So overall  great meal. The place is a little loud but fun. Relaxing with really good Austin modern Mexican food. Our server was really good and took care of us. Even kept our water glasses full. Friendly too. So we enjoyed it. Great food and great environment for an enjoyable meal. We enjoyed it and always looking forward to coming back. Enjoy
ATX Cocina,20,11 10 Rating from me  Man... I went with my wife for our last dinner in Austin and it did NOT DISAPPOINT  Sheesh  they re killing it there in terms of food and service  Absolutely perfect experience.. I d hands down recommend it to anyone who s looking for a place to eat good modern elevated Mexican food.  We had the Hamachi  Guacamole  served with homemade corn tortilla chips   Sopes masas  Brussel sprouts and the braised short ribs. I m not even lying when I tell you EVERYTHING was so delicious  Jeez  the braised short ribs were to die for  Shoutout to our waitress  Allie  who recommended it to us. She was the highlight of our night as well  from beginning to end... endlessly serving us a fine dining experience in the hot summer night in Austin. She told us some customers even get angry when they run out of the short ribs   Which I understand why now that I ve tried it . It s super tender  moist  amp  delish. You def gotta try it. My personal favorite was the hamachi  but my wife didn t try it because she doesn t like sashimi. Everything is super balanced in terms of salt  fat  acid  and heat  which points to the superb culinary knowledge of the head chef owner of the restaurant who developed such smart flavor  amp  texture combinations .  Overall a solid 5 5 from me. I d definitely come back when I visit Austin again 
ATX Cocina,21,A spacious and welcoming place that would be great for a date night or classy dinner. One of my favorites dishes was the tostadas de at n. It had melt-in-your-mouth tuna with a creamy avocado salsa on top of a perfectly crunchy tortilla. Another favorite was the molotes. The outer pastry shell was soft and the chicken tinga filling had just the right amount of kick.  I also tried the esquites  which was creamy  slightly sweet  and very addicting. I wasn t too big of a fan of the queso fundido. The cheese seemed to have congealed while also simultaneously being watery. The corn tortillas that came with the dish were great though  slightly thicker with a great chew.
ATX Cocina,22,ATX Cocina has really great modern Mexican food but while the space is large  they have crammed in so many tables that walking anywhere is a tight squeeze. We ended up at a partial booth next to the bar section and waiters had to ask multiple times for customers to scoot in so they could walk in the aisle. The tables are also only spaced a little over a foot apart so there is not much privacy and I could overhear the conversations on either side.   The food here was good but I didn t think any of the flavors were anything outstanding. My favorite dish was the Tostadas de At n. The sauces were amazing and it s probably the best tuna tostada that I ve tried. The texture of the queso fundido was a little off putting. The cheese was congealed and the pickled chile formed a watery layer on top.
ATX Cocina,23,ATX Cocina was such a fun and delicious experience  The wait staff is friendly  the ambiance is beautiful  and the food is unique and delicious. The prices are a bit high  but if you re looking for a place that s upscale without being too stuck up for a special occasion  this is a great spot 
ATX Cocina,24,The Tesla Uber ride over to the establishment  on the main exchange  that car traverse all hours of the day  felt yuppie. But when in Rome  they use Teslas  not chariots.   Don t be intimated by being made to feel you are entering into an office building  it is a rouse to keep the flippant gastronomiqe at bay. My advise  embrace the decor.   You are immediately greeted by warm staff and confirmation of your reservation. It is worth making one--it s that popular.   The Telsa drivers only statement as we got out was  and it is my only recommendation  because it s is what I only want when I return  was   ...try the Caesar salad   I don t know what shocked me more the explosion of flavors  familiar and different  or the fact I was educated that it is a Mexican thing  not Italian.
ATX Cocina,25,I was here this past week invited by my co-worker and didn t know what to expect.  Parking nearby is only  5 after 5pm on a weekday.  Once you enter the restaurant it has a modern very clean look to the decor not a typical Mexican restaurant.  Once I sat down I order the Margarita De La Casa from the recommendation of my co-worker and it did not disappoint  The house Tequila Lunazul Blanco was a very high quality tequila with so much flavor  One of the best Tequila I have had in Austin  Even though we only ordered Apps and not entrees I was surprised by the flavor and delicious creative dishes which was a definitely memorable experience that I would love to come back to try their entrees  The service was great and our waiter was very knowledgeable.  I m looking forward to coming back again 
ATX Cocina,26,Food is excellent. Service was spectacular. It was very busy on a Tuesday night. The octopus was delicious.
ATX Cocina,27,Really enjoyed their happy hour specials  We got there right when they opened for an early dinner and they gave us the option of bar seating or outdoor. We were feeling the inside so sat at the bar.   Modern Mexican really is the vibe of this place  as everything is chic looking. Service was quick and good. They have some pretty reasonably priced food on their menu and some more expensive  fine-dining like items as well. The happy hour was very reasonable though and was about  30 per person for 2 margaritas and 2 tacos.  The chips and guacamole were good and salty. The portion size was way more generous than I was expecting. Chips were large and salty.   The tacos were cooked and flavored very well. My only minor complaint would be that you have to either commit to ordering 2 of the chicken or 2 of the fish and you can t try one of each. I found that to be sort of odd so  my boyfriend and I just ordered 1 plate of each and switched them so we could both try.   Regardless the food was very good and I would definitely go back to explore more of their menu.
ATX Cocina,28, 1 favorite restaurant in austin.  The vibe is great  upbeat  authentic and in a great location. The service can be slow at times  but the staff always has a great attitude and are very accommodating. The food is 9 10  very flavorful  portion size is perfect  ingredients are fresh and I m ALWAYS blown away by the short rib.  I ve had the rib-eye a few times which is good  but the cut is never consistent.. Love this place  Definitely will be coming back for awhile 
ATX Cocina,29, qu  deliciosa fue esta comida  We went here one Friday night whilst visiting Austin. Food was gourmet Mexican and it was paired with delicious cocktails  the Paloma was different than I m used to  but good    Service was very attentive  If we are in Austin again we d return 
ATX Cocina,30,I arrived around 5 30 on a Friday without a reservation and the hostess was able to provide us a table if we were done by 7 30PM. The place is beautiful. Happy hour is on specific sections  we were seated in the dining room so we weren t able to order any of the happy hour items. My one drink was potent and delicious. I got the coco loco with don julio blanco  coconut cream pineapple orange and nutmeg. My date got the ATX which the server described as the boozier house margarita. Our servers were attentive and since it was our first time  Summer spent the time going through the menu. I was drooling and appreciated the insight on the portions. We got 3 appetizers and an entr e and were so full. I wish I ordered less so I could ve had dessert. The machete is definitely worth a try  especially with the short rib. I was in love with all the various flavors of the sauces used. I love branzino so we ordered that and it came with broken black garlic vinaigrette  green molcajete salsa  pow pow. Amazing. I can t wait to find an occasion to come back. What I also appreciated was that the back of the menu listed all the folks who make the restaurant function including the dishwashers. That s really purposeful acknowledgement.
ATX Cocina,31,Wow  Yummmmmmmmm   Can t say enough about how delicious this place was   We got so much food  Everything was great  but my favorite was the creamed corn.. it was almost like Mac and cheese. The shishito peppers were also up there on my list. The guac was great and had some kick.. the Avocados could ve been mashed up a bit more for my taste  but still the flavor was there. We got the tomahawk and shared it w the table and it did not disappoint  We will be coming back 
ATX Cocina,32,Came here for a Friday night and all I can say was the place was chaotic... hostesses were unnecessarily uppity and weren t seating guests  despite many visibly open tables... maybe trying to add some hype to the already overcrowded bar   The queso was the best thing we ate... octopus shrimp dish  not pictured  fell flat for us.   Would come back here with a group for margs and shared apps which was definitely more the weekend vibe than a date night
ATX Cocina,33,The food here is incredible   Didn t really know what to expect but it was beyond good  Highly recommend the Hamachi Crudo and Esquites  Service is a bit tough but understandably so given how busy they are. But still would go back anytime with how good the food was  The drinks are also pretty good 
ATX Cocina,34,Mexican  Hardly    The tacos of the day were fried fish tacos with cheese  Everyone knows fish  amp  cheese don t go together. Gross. And how hard is it to make a delicious taco  I ordered the nachos which WERE NOT NACHOS but a tostada. Come on guys  The guacamole came after our mains although it was ordered with our drinks. The salmon was raw. Took way too long to get our drinks. This is not Mexican food. Maybe some sort of attempt at  upscale  Mexican    The Brussels Sprouts were weird... leaves not the actual heads. The tortillas were cold. And all of it over priced.  Good news is the manager comp d the salmon and gave us free guacamole after our meal was finished...
ATX Cocina,35,Delicious food and margaritas. Highly recommend the corn and chicken dishes. The atmosphere was great around the bar.
ATX Cocina,36,Delicious place so happy we came here before we left back to cali  the food the decor was amazing the staff was amazing.
ATX Cocina,37,Trendy  modern location specializing in Mexican fare and tasty cocktails.  If you ve ever driven on Ceasar Chavez at night  you ve inevitably driven by this location and noticed the modern and sleek look of it from the outside. Wanting to see what this place was all about  I ended up giving this place a try by making a reservation for a Friday evening.   One of the first things most people remark about this place is how modern and clean the aesthetic of the interior is. If you don t have a reservation for this place  especially on the weekend  you can expect to wait a very long time as this tends to be on everyone s list of favorite Mexican restaurants in downtown.  The cocktails here are all very good and generally you can t go wrong with any of them. That is  unless you cannot handle spice--in which case  stay away from the spicy margaritas   Almost everything I ve had here has been super tasty  but I must add that if you are not sensitive to diary and like cheese  you MUST try the queso fundido. It s a deliciously melty and savory combination of flavors.  Prices are what you d expect for more high end Mexican fare and while not cheap  I would argue are not bad when you consider the quality of the food you can expect. Be mindful of a potentially troublesome downtown parking situation and get here early to be sure you don t miss your reservation time.
ATX Cocina,38,Thought ATX Cocina was fabulous and and is a must if you re in Austin.  Went for drinks and an app before plans later in the night. The service was friendly  food and drinks were next level and the atmosphere was beautiful.
ATX Cocina,39,All around great experience. This place has great early evening light and the dining area has clean  stylish decor. Atmosphere-check. The service was perfection. The hostess greeted us promptly and took us to our table in the bar area because we had come in for the last hour of happy hour. Our waiter  Richard was informative  attentive  without being annoying or overbearing   clear  well-spoken  and prompt. Service- check. The food was delicious. We ordered the  guacamole  house margaritas  tacos of the day  and brussel sprouts. All flavorful and yummy. Food-check. Cleanliness is also an important factor in my ratings. The place felt clean  and the ladies room was well attended. So cleanliness- check. The verdict  I recommend this place wholeheartedly. Enjoy 
ATX Cocina,40,Came by here for a late lunch  early dinner since our other gastropub location was closed. Was recommended this place by a friend so we had to give this place a try. Came in without a reservation but luckily was able to get a table immediately outside. If you prefer to eat indoors  I recommend making a reservation as it was about a 1.5-2 hour wait for indoor seating. Their outdoor area was nice. Shaded by a huge tree. The only thing that killed us was the humidity.  We shared small appetizers since we weren t too hungry. Shared an order of chips and guac which I have to say  was the best guac I ve ever had. Their presentation was nice. The guac was so fresh and flavorful. Their chips weren t like your typical shaped. Rather looks like they shaved a corn vertically and fried it. The chip was crisp and crunchy. My significant other and I shared a machete taco which were long shaped taco with short rib. I ordered their dirty horchata which was strong but good. I m not a big fan of bourbon but due to the strong alcohol  you don t really taste the horchata flavor at all. Could use more cinnamon or milk add to the flavor more. Definitely enjoyed our experience here and hope to try this place again next time when our stomach is more prepared since we weren t too hungry this visit.
ATX Cocina,41,We had an amazing dinner last night  Sabrina was amazing and went above and beyond. I have a lot of food allergies and appreciated how great they were about them. They even went through the menu and marked what I could and couldn t have. Everything we ordered was delicious  carne asada  el rey   guacamole  pulpo y chorizo and queso fundido. We highly recommend and will definitely be back soon 
ATX Cocina,42,They advertise as Tex Mex but I would say elevated Mexican food. Either way it was good. Everything is made to share which is nice. We got one thing from every section of the menu.  The chips and guacamole were a highlight. The guacamole was so smooth and delicious.  The steak was tender and buttery.  Some of the other items were on the spicy side but still really good.
ATX Cocina,43,My friend RAVES about this place  so it had been on my must-try list for a while. I came on a Thursday right when they opened and already  the restaurant was full of people. We easily got a seat at the bar  but you would definitely need a reservation for table service.  They changed their happy hour deals    I saw so many reviews about it  so I was super excited. Come to find out their new happy hour menu has only 3 items  a marg  daily taco special  and guac.  From the normal menu  we got the Sopes and the Queso Fundido. Get the sopes   They are small but full of flavor. I would pass on the Queso fundido. It was all cheese with the smallest amount of short-rib in it. Also wish they added more chiles to ours.  Overall great atmosphere. Parking situation is absolutely horrible unless you park in a garage or do valet  so if I really want to go again I might just uber.
ATX Cocina,44,Beautiful interior and amazing wooden ceiling at ATX Cocina. The drinks were tasty and so was the ahi tuna appetizer we got. We had reservations in a Friday but still had to wait a half an hour for our table to be ready. Luckily  we were able to grab drinks at the bar. I was a little underwhelmed by most of the food we got as it was super heavy and often with a decent bit of oil and cheese and salt.  Definitely not many healthy options when even the Brussels sprouts  corn  and salad were heavy of the cheese and salty.  I wish there was some fresher  lighter options at ATX Cocina since this meal made me feel sick.  If you can handle heavy food  I recommend this place for a date night or girls night especially for cocktails.
ATX Cocina,45,Loved our couples night visit for dinner  The drinks were awesome-I got the one with mezcal and it was perfect. They were very accommodating to both vegan and vegetarian diets. The vegan flatbread they made for me was perfect. Even the chips they brought out to start were delicious  Very fun  lively  and modern ambience too. Highly recommend 
ATX Cocina,46,The food at this place was amazing. Tasted so great. The only reason it s not 5 stars is that it is quite pricey and packed in the inside almost to the extent of feeling crowded. Drinks are great and unconventional as well  good service.
ATX Cocina,47,Salad was massive the nacho thing was great the tuna was really good but had too many sesame seeds the octopus was also dope the way they did the chorizo with it was different almost like beans   
ATX Cocina,48,Of all of the modern Mexican restaurants in ATX  Cocina reins supreme. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I think ATX cocina deserves its own applause  but for those who have been to Cosme in NYC I would say ATX Cocina is on the same level  albeit everything is Oaxacan. I have never had a cocktail or dish here that I did not love.  Of all of the tasty things on the menu  I would say the Brussels sprouts are a must.
ATX Cocina,49,FOODIES  This restaurant is a must  Fantastic food and beverages. A gastronomic experience. The beets with burrata prepared the palate. Queso was topped with an imaginative chimichurri-like blend of flavors and served with small corn tortillas. Duck dish with mole was moist  outstanding  and filling  with enough duck to share or offer tastings. The short ribs for 2 was delicious  meat was falling off the bone. The mayo based sauce was not needed as the pickled carrots gave it a great counterpoint. Try the flan. It was enough for 3. The carajillo was good with the flan. My favorite drink was the Mi A-Mora  flavorful  thick  with a smokey goodness. Mark was our waiter  highly attentive and a cheerful attitude. Can t ask for more  I highly recommend this restaurant. Multiple drinks  dinner  and dessert for 3 adults   325 not including tip. Well worth it. Five stars .
ATX Cocina,50,Look  it s wasn t bad but it wasn t good. The happy hour chicken tacos were really dry and had no flavor  for my white chicken eaters  don t order this. The shishitos peppers are amazing. The Fondue was also an honorable mention. But prob won t come back. If I do it would be for the cocktails only.
ATX Cocina,51,This was a Deloitte-held dinner for some team members across Texas  amp  from up north to meet up. Overall  the entire experience was hands-down one of the most entertaining and pleasant dining experiences I ve had.  Unfortunately I cannot remember our waiters name but he was also an entomologist and so aside from providing extremely colorful descriptions of the menu items  he also taught us about some common bugs eggs which was really cool.   The food was beautiful and tasted delicious  and the drinks were fantastic. The only issue I had was parking  but it works out because after leaving  I realized there was a parking garage attached to the strip of restaurants as well as scooters to get you around to your car very easily.   10 10 recommend
ATX Cocina,52,So if you are visiting or living here  we   out of towers  highly recommend this place to everyone. We from SF visited our family in Austin  and we re so proud of them for choosing this place.  There are many reasons top three  ask for Richard  omg he will go out of his way to help you  explain to you  suggest you  and passionately listen to you. Since we went the first time so  of course  we had questions and concerns  but Richard kept smiling behind his mask and helped us to choose excellently.  2nd season this place is open till 11 pm on the weekend  and if you are on a short trip  you will love to catch up  eat and talk with your loved ones.  The third reason is their menu which sounds like Taco  Nachos  or carne asada  but once you order  you will learn  the taste is beyond your expectations. Can you believe the chef makes even the hot sauce with his Personal recipe  The restaurant interior was upbeat and fun. They do have an outdoor setting  but it was covered  so they might as well sit inside. Also  we came  with reservations  after 9 30  so it was comfortable inside. So  in the end  like to say  highly recommended  and if I visit Austin  Texas  I would love to go back and explore the menu. Richard  thank you again.
ATX Cocina,53,ATX Cocina is the type of place you take your out-of-town friends so that they can be impressed by the seemingly hip atmosphere and elevated cuisine that is  as ATX Cocina describes it   Modern Mexican.  And there s nothing wrong with that  I like ATX Cocina for this very purpose.  But when I m hungry and want a delicious meal  and one that I am perhaps even willing to spend a little extra on   ATX Cocina will never come to mind. In my opinion  this is definitely a place you go to for the experience rather than the food. There s are dozens of better Mexican restaurants that I feel more compelled to revisit time and time again
ATX Cocina,54,Service was amazing and the food I got the sopes and ribeye was sooooo delicious    The Paloma drink so good  
ATX Cocina,55,Some good some bad  but overall 3 stars.   Highlights   hamachi appetizer  guacamole  carne asada  salmon  carrot side order  friendliness  atx margarita  coco loco cocktail  value.   Lowlights   too loud  forgot 2 of our orders  corn side  papas side  masas  were told these were tacos but they are not.   The highlights were good enough to get to 3 stars and get us back at some point in the future  but the lowlights were pretty bad.  For a place this expensive everything should be amazing.
ATX Cocina,56,Location is a bit hard to beat just because it s RIGHT near the lake and can walk pretty much anywhere. I got the tastados and they were pretty decent  could ve been better and could have been worse. My food was sub par but the atmosphere was cool. My family got carne asada  which was by far the best thing I tried at the table....it was amazing   brussel sprouts  and salmon. Overall  I think it was a bit too extreme in the menu options  lots of extravagant things that I probably wouldn t put together . But that is the draw for most people  They have a lot of different items of quality.
ATX Cocina,57,If you re looking for a really upscale Mexican experience try this place. Sleek  modern and young is how I would describe the vibe. The bar was full so we put our name on the wait list and got lucky when a table opened up. The drinks are expensive but amazing. I had a gin based drink called OH-MG  It was ok  but a little sweet. My friend had one of the tequila drinks that was two different colors and it was quite refreshing. Sopas and Molitas were filling and plated beautifully. Our server also recommended a cheese tortilla appetizer which was velvety smooth  warm and tasty. Our server was attentive and amazing. He patiently explained the complicated menu  checked on us often and kept the drinks flowing. If you re looking for a different sophisticated dining experience check this place out 
ATX Cocina,58,Visited ATX Cocina with a party of 7 for a bachelorette party this weekend and had an absolutely incredible experience   Atmosphere is amazing. Modern  open  and bright  this place was lively on a Thursday evening. Absolutely loved the open kitchen - they even have high top tables where you can watch them cook which I d love to try sometime  Luckily we were seated inside...hadn t realized how hot Austin would be in June but the patio did look super cute for a cooler month.  Despite having a reservation  we did have about a fifteen minute wait for our table given the busy evening. But the hostess and bartender made it an enjoyable wait by settling us in at the bar for a delicious  and impressively quickly made  round of cocktails.  The staff truly makes this a five start experience. Our waitress  Summer  was super friendly  attentive  and professional. She kept our bride feeling celebrated  provided excellent recommendations  and kept our drinks full  I even saw another waitress come relieve her of a tray she was holding while standing at our table to make it easier for her to assist use. Now that s teamwork   The food was out of this world. The menu consists of upscale Mexican influenced cuisine served family style. We ordered and all tried a bit of everything - you really can t go wrong with this menu.  We started with several of the tapas - we loved the nachos  guacamole  queso  and burrata. The entrees and sides and family style and several of the meats need to cook for close to an hr. Our waitress smartly recommended we order them while enjoying the tapas which made for a relaxed paced experience. For entrees  we enjoyed the chicken  short rib  and carne asada. While everything was delicious  the short rib was just one of the best short ribs I ve ever had and I highly recommend. The Brussels and patatas were delicious sides.  All in all  I had high expectations for atx cocina but they absolutely exceeded them  I highly recommend this restaurant for large and small groups  date nights  and special occasions. I can t wait to return on my next trip to Austin 
ATX Cocina,59,the food was amazing but the server was better   JAMES JAMES JAMES   you Truly made my birthday night.. I appreciate you making me feel special and brining a nice little glass of champagne. I shall be coming back.
ATX Cocina,60,Stopped in here for a quick beverage and bite with a friend. We sat at the bar and ordered goodness knows what but all the drinks ordered were at the recommendation of our lovely bartender Andy. He also made sure to get our food orders in before they closed which ended up as guacamole and sopes. Both were delicious and our friendly neighbor also let us try his broccolini and fish which I can recommend. Lovely ambiance and great service  go here it s delicious.
ATX Cocina,61,Order the tostadas de at n and sopes. You won t regret it   They also have a great happy hour for yummy guacamole  margs and tacos. Love love love this place.
ATX Cocina,62,Stopped by for dinner after seeing a show at the Long Center. We ordered the huarache and the short rib for 2.   The huarache was good  but overly salty. I loved all the flavors and textures but they just needed to dial back on the salt content.   The star of the show was definitely the short rib -- super tender and flavorful  I loved that it came with pickled carrots for a different texture too. I loved the blue corn tortillas and made little tacos out of the short rib and carrots.   We had Dimitri as our server and he was so friendly and knew the menu well.  I d definitely come back to try the other dishes 
ATX Cocina,63,Stopped by last Sunday with a girlfriend and had a wonderful time at ATX Cocina  Such a cool vibe and the interior was absolutely beautiful.  We started off with the huarache and the sopes  both were delicious but I d have to say the sopes we re a tad better. You can t beat the cochinita  For our entree we just shared the chorizo and octopus which we both agreed was our favorite dish of the night  Had austin not had so many amazing food destinations we would have ordered more  I d definitely return to taste the rest of the menu as everything sounded great 
ATX Cocina,64,I m glad we had a reservation as they are a very busy restaurant  We went for my birthday dinner and they did not disappoint  The server was very helpful in explaining the menu and was spot on with sizes and proportions which we appreciated as we did a bunch of smaller plates for the table. The food was AMAZING with such a unique spin on each dish. The drinks were tasty too  No complaints other than it is a very loud restaurant.
ATX Cocina,65,Just OK. I have been in Austin 26 years. I wanted to love  but did not. Good bar and appetizers
ATX Cocina,66,Phenomenal  Best meal that I ve had in a long time. Salmon was so delicious  fresh and moist. Pork tomahawk and short ribs were also super delicious. Guacamole was excellent. The flan was to die for. The service matched the excellence of the food  I ve eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world including Central in Lima. ATX was one of my top five restaurants of all time. Thank you  
ATX Cocina,67,This place was awesome  We came here for dinner without making a reservation. I learned that they fill up fast and it is best to make a reservation  especially with covid precautions in place. Luckily the friendly host was able to find us a table. We had an amazing waiter who was very friendly and efficient. He told us all about the menu and even made some recommendations. Our food was perfection  We will definitely be back. I can t say enough good things about this place.
ATX Cocina,68,The food service was fabulous. After each service  different individuals spoke with us about what was the dish... Steak was tender and dessert  flan  was yummy . Thank you Logan ... try to get him as your wait-person   
ATX Cocina,69,The food was amazing  the service was outstanding and drinks were so quenching. A must go to while in Austin. The atmosphere and vibe on point for sure. We had a big flight delay and forced us to be late for our reservation but we called the restaurant and they were so accommodating.
ATX Cocina,70,The place is really nice  We sat outside on a beautiful starry night. The tall trees and the lights make it very cozy  Their kitchen is GLUTEN FREE    How awesome is that   We some margs  the guacamole and I ordered the pulpo. OMG - best octopus that I have ever had. It was charred to perfection. This is a must try 
ATX Cocina,71,This morning  I woke up to news a MAN in a YELLOW SHIRT on a BIKE is suspected of having shot to death some guy at Republic Square.  You know  the yoga park right outside the federal courthouse where SFC holds farmer s markets.  Just everyday bidness in downtown Austin.  So I decided to go two blocks south of that for some grub today  why not   This place has somehow gotten worse.  Chef s cooks still have no idea how to balance heat and just coat every piece of protein in heat  except the el jefe stuff .  On top of that  the menu needs serious wording help  no one cares if your huirache or sopa or whatever has BEANS on it if it s going to be drenched in undisclosed peppers.   The guac is okay.  Fried redfish for 80 bucks or whatever is still lmao.  This is the going rate for a bland  greasy ruin of a very fishy sort of fish.  El jefe is pretty good  can t lie.    This place had a good thing going with this baby corn take on elote and then they scrapped it.  Bring it back.  This place has morphed into a pretty hopping happy hour.  Lots of beautiful people flock in to swarm the bar.  Some are even friendly   Service lacks on basically every front except  broadly speaking  the host stand.  Waiters might be too busy  generously speaking.  Come if your friend is paying at the bar  stay home otherwise.
ATX Cocina,72,My absolute favorite restaurant in Austin. The vibe  the food  the portions  the service always delivers  Also bonus points for the best Paloma on the planet  Because the portions are so generous  the value is great  that said  be careful not to over order.
ATX Cocina,73,Looking for upscale Mexican food with an aesthetic atmosphere  ATX Cocina is the place to go.  We started with the cocina guacamole and queso fundido.  The queso fundido is hot  melty cheese that pairs perfectly with warm tortillas.  Next we tried the fish tacos and they were probably one of the best I have ever had.  All of these paired perfectly with their spicy margaritas.  This is def. a spot you want to add to your list 
ATX Cocina,74,Amazing   High end Mexican food.  Just love it   Atmosphere  drinks and food and delicious.
ATX Cocina,75,Excellent food.  My company had a group dinner and I enjoyed the food.  I d definitely eat here again when I visit Austin.
ATX Cocina,76,Very creative dishes  large portions  friendly service. Recommend you share the appetisers and main courses so you get to taste a good variety of the exquisite cuisine
ATX Cocina,77,Good quality  but it does have a high price point.  Would return on an expense account  but will some of the high end steakhouses would be preferred  as the prices are about the same for a lot more food.
ATX Cocina,78,Whenever you find a great place like this you have to go ahead a spread the word. This is guys  probably the best mexican  traditional  incredible food i ve had in Texas. Please do not hesitate and get here. You ll never regret it
ATX Cocina,79,Great for large parties    We sat outside in the patio and it was perfect weather. They do make you have a minimum but honestly the food was so good that it is worth it  The chips and guacamole and verde salsa were an incredible start. Who knew guacamole could be that good  We then had a delicious  refreshing Caesar Salad. And then the table had Short Rib  Chili Roasted Chicken  Verduras  carrots and brussel sprouts  and Flan to finish. The group was raving over the short rib and said it is a MUST order. The carrots were was incredible and had a great sauce. I would skip the Brussel sprouts. For drinks  we enjoyed the Paloma and the espresso martini  made with tequila . Our server  Amber  was an absolutely doll and was so accommodating  We really enjoyed having her as our server  Th only thing we weren t impressed with was that it took a long time for us to get drinks.
ATX Cocina,80,This place was great  The restaurant is very well decorated and has a great ambiance. We came here during happy hour and got the signature margarita. Highly recommend as they were delicious  We also got the guac and chips and they were so good. I definitely want to come back to try entrees  Make sure to get a reservation as this spot will fill up very quickly.
ATX Cocina,81,Amazing food and great service. Dinner only  reservations only  book a few days in advance. During the pandemic  they ve done a great job of masking employees  installing barriers  and spacing tables.  The food is fantastic. Everything was seasoned and prepared perfectly. The highlights of the night were the Hamachi  Brussels Sprouts  and the Horchata Ice Cream. The texture and flavors of the dishes were nice and refreshing. The savory dishes all had a nice balance of salty  sweet  and sour. OMG  so good. Will definitely be back.
ATX Cocina,82,The food  wonderful and magnificent    Gregory was our waiter and he was the perfect host for our Mother s Day outing. Made us feel special throughout the whole meal. 10 10 will come back
ATX Cocina,83,JOHN       The best server we ever had in our life. Loved this experience all night. John made it so special
ATX Cocina,84,Had dinner on a Thursday night at ATX Cocina. Beautiful restaurant with plenty of patio seating that was very well spaces out. The interior was also beautifully decorated - we walked through this on our way outdoors. The service there was excellent as well.   Drinks  I went with their House Margarita - the ATX. Very delicious and a good choice for sitting outside where it was a warm night.  Food  Their food is meant to be shared  but you can also get some of their larger plates as main courses. I was there with one other person and we shared the guacamole  has jalepenos in it  so it had a little extra kick  and the brussel sprouts  very delicious . I then ordered the sopes for myself which were basically three round potato cakes with meat and salsa topped on them. I would recommend these for a group of two or three. I really could only eat about 1.5 of them after I had some of the guac and the brussel sprouts because they are pretty big. My friend got the salmon which I tried a bit of and was very tasty.   Really fun atmosphere  plenty of outdoor seating  and tasty food and drinks right downtown Austin  Note they do have valet parking in the evenings as well. There is also a parking garage right next to it though  so no free parking nearby  but you should be able to find some parking if you drive.
ATX Cocina,85,Really enjoyed my meal. We sat outside under the covered thing and it was extremely loud but nice to be outside. Indoors is cool as well but I didn t feel safe with COVID. The chicken was extremely juicy and well flavored. The corn tortillas that come with it were also really good and a nice addition.
ATX Cocina,86,Always a good time and meal at Atx cocina. Loud  see and be seen spot with active bar scene. Upscale or elevated mexican influenced food. Queso fundido is excellent combo of cheese  serranos  and beef served with excellent soft  blue corn tortillas with great chew texture. Tuna tostada is okay but ive had much better at other spots...the tuna piece is too large for the tostada chips  would be better diced up  and not enough citrus. The sopes are good not great. The shells are thick chewy and the meat a little dry. The machete tacos were a standout. Think elevated jack in the box tacos with meat and cheese wrapped in tortilla and crisped in the fryer or griddle. Not gourmet but excellent nonetheless. The Caesar salad was a huge portion for sharing with 3 or 4 easily. Lettuce and bowl were super chilled which was awesome in very good tangy citrusy dressing albeit slightly overdressed. The broccolini is again a large portion with all kinds of cheeses and bits of yummy things on top can be easily shared with a table. The bone marrow with lamb looked good again served with blue tortillas but i didnt try it. The salmon is a huge pi3ce but sauce was a little too pungently vinegary tonight.  Would be good to order a few things and share them family style here. Lots of good food for around  40 pp before drinks and tip. Service was a nice team effort between waitress  food delivery peeps  and other helpers.
ATX Cocina,87,Definitely one of my favourite places in Austin for dinner and happy hour as well. Upscale yet relaxed  they have an outdoor patio and ample seating.   Now food - starters and HH menu are smaller portions but cooked to perfection. Their main courses are sized well and are delicious. Good cocktail selection and the bar seating has a great vibe to it 
ATX Cocina,88,The food here was mostly good. We had the street corn  nachos  papas  mushroom flatbread  and guac. The service experience was quirky. We were expected to order everything at once and were told items would be brought out  to flow better . However  all 5 items arrived within 5 minutes of each other. This made for an uncomfortable dinner on a already small table for 2. The other issue with ordering all at once is that you don t get to try a few items and reorder what you like best since you already ordered a bunch of different items. When we brought this to our server s attention  we were met with some excuses but no apologies or real solutions were provided. Overall  we were excited to try this restaurant for the first time but were let down.
ATX Cocina,89,Absolutely awesome. The food  the service and the speed of everything was absolutely great  will definitely become a staple for our next Austin visit.
ATX Cocina,90,One of my go-to spots when working in Austin which is pretty frequent.  Happy Hour is fantastic.  I can grab a nosh and a drink for a reasonable price.  But most important for me is how engaging the staff is at the bar.  I eat alone a lot in my travels and it is really nice to have people to talk to.  Being an older person  trendy places can be intimidating.  But I feel welcome here and that is really a big deal for me. One of my favorite spots in Austin 
ATX Cocina,91,Consistently one of the best dinner spots in town. They are ALWAYS busy  but they always deliver.   We had a late reservation  9 15  on a Friday night. We ordered the Caesar salad  hamachi  burrata  and queso fundido to start. The hamachi was a 12 10. We were licking the bowl . The salad was bomb  as per usual  but I could have lived without the fundido. Nitrate was delish too  duhh.   Next courses were the Brussels and the Carne Asada. I think Brussels sprouts are overrated...so don t ask my opinion  but the meat was wonderful. Melt in your mouth and perfectly cooked. Then came the roasted carrots and salmon. The carrots were a 12 10. The salmon came out almost completely raw throughout so we sent it back  but our waitress Sierra took it off the bill and had a new one sent out quickly.   Everyone s cocktails were wonderful. Can t wait to visit again. Thanks Sierra for a wonderful dinner and experience 
ATX Cocina,92,Recently visited Austin and had dinner at ATX Cocina. The interior decor is very tasteful and fun  a beautiful restaurant. Service was great  our waiter was friendly  attentive and knowledgable. The star of the show was most definitely the food - AMAZING. We had several dishes and every single thing I tasted was delicious. The steak  carne asada  was easily one of the favorites at the table  highly recommend everyone to order. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner 
ATX Cocina,93,Big fan of this place all the way around. Service was great. Food was outstanding. Drinks were tasty. I honestly cannot think of anything that was an issue while we were dining here. We made a reservation a few weeks out  so you know it s a busy place. Definitely suggest going that route. We ordered the guacamole and the queso fundido as appetizers. Entrees we re the shrimp  carne asada  and the nachos - with sides of the potatoes and brussels. Again  everything tasted great and great size to share around the table. Will be back 
ATX Cocina,94,Just incredible  All shareable  we thought this would be expensive  but was actually very reasonable. Can t wait to go back.
ATX Cocina,95,Amazing  Would highly recommend getting the corn dish   guac together so you have chips for both  The ceviche style dishes were incredible and the drinks were on point. Special shot out to our waiter  he was great 
ATX Cocina,96,This is not your typical Mexican food. It s definitely high end and worth every penny food. We started out with the sopes. They were delicious. Then my husband had the tostada atuna and I had the salmon. The tuna portion was small but that was what my husband wanted. Very tasty but small tostadas. My salmon was delicious and had a crispy skin and salad greens and an amazing sauce. I was hoping to have a dessert but we were both too full. I would recommend this place and be sure to make advance reservations.
ATX Cocina,97,No matter the outside temp bring a sweater--It s so cool in here. Not because of the temperature--it s the vibe--duh. The servers rival Santa s bag as he departs the North Pole. Pretty full....of themselves. But put all that aside. Food is amazing and comes out super quick. Service impeccable. Definitely come  Ole  
ATX Cocina,98,I am going to be honest and up front.  I did not actually go to this restaurant.  I live in Ohio and this restaurant is in Austin texas.  My two kids were visiting their older sister who lives there so I sponsored their dinner one night since their mother and I couldn t join.  I called ATX Cocina and Phil answered and made all the arrangements.  4 ice cold Coronas were waiting for my kids and their guest and the appetizers came out right afterwards.  Queso  guacamole and Caesar salad arranged by individual romaine lettuce leaves.  They ordered their own main dishes with the house margaritas.  Then three delicious desserts came automatically at the end.    I didn t eat anything but my kids RAVED about the service and quality of the food.    I am just so grateful and amazed by the level of service.  Thanks so much to ATX.  I can t wait to get down to Austin so I can try this out in person   
ATX Cocina,99,Delicious food and amazing service  One of the best restaurants in Austin for sure.   We had the guacamole  ceviche  short rib  fish fajitas  and elote.
ATX Cocina,100,Yum yum yum. Favorite Mexican spot thus far in austin  Chicken tacos  queso fundido  margs aren t bad either. Check out HH for sure 
ATX Cocina,101,Omg where do I start   everything was well seasoned . Staff was great  the ambiance of this place was gorgeous. I do have to say hands down the best darn Paloma I have had. Will definitely be back  hopefully sooner than later  
ATX Cocina,102,Limited menu  over priced food that lacks flavor. Staff are over whelmed. Could house better management and a menu upgrade
ATX Cocina,103,This is definitely a great place to recommend to friends visiting. Great food with a great vibe. Slightly upscale pricing for Mexican food but the food and drinks are worth it  
ATX Cocina,104,This place was pretty fun. Food was quite good.   Food  Queso fundido with tortillas - delicious  Guacamole - decent  Hamachi - delicious sauce  Burrata - good
ATX Cocina,105,I do realize I have a very unpopular opinion. Everyone else seems to rave about this place. I brought my wife here for a little birthday dinner date and neither of us could understand the  very small  menu. No photos to help us with what we would be ordering. We both just took a shot in the dark and ordered something we thought we might like. She got the salmon which was undercooked and VERY spicy. I ordered the carne asada  which was good  but you get a TON of meat and a small side of broccolini. Very meat-heavy dish. My wife was still hungry since she couldn t finish her dish  so we ordered dessert. We got the flan which was delicious  so that s a plus. Overall I d just never come here again. I wish I would ve had the experience everyone else raves about.
ATX Cocina,106,OMG  I visited this place during my trip to Austin-let me tell you it is the best food I ve had in a loongg while  It was so good I end up going twice in a 1 week 
ATX Cocina,107,Upscale Mexican with a fantastic tapas partners. Modern and all you d expect from a metro downtown place including the relatively higher pricetag  but we ordered Palomas and sides and dined till we were stuffed for  40 each  so really not bad  As a bonus  the customer service was the best I ve had at a restaurant in this town. Their sopas took a while  they are handmade on demand  and the staff was so nice that the manager brought them out himself and apologized for the wait  and took  20 off our bill. They definitely get 5 stars from this satisfied customer. I d be back for any nice dinner. Get the corn  my TOP choice  so original   brussel sprouts  and guac.
ATX Cocina,108,We hosted my parents  50th anniversary party in the Green Room at ATX Cocina and it was PERFECT.  I coordinated all the arrangements long distance and Sabrina was super responsive and helpful setting things up. The decor is lavish  the food exquisitely made and delicious and the service  impeccable. Logan  who served us  was so patient and accommodating of our many requests.  The chef even made an off-menu item for one of our guests with special needs. Overall  we couldn t have asked for a better experience to commemorate an event that was so important for us.  Our 20 guests were all over the moon and can t stop talking about the food and libations. The exquisite cocktails alone are a reason we will be recommending this restaurant to everyone we know   Highly  highly recommend ATX Cocina for hosting fabulous gatherings 
ATX Cocina,109,Delicious and flavorful food  favorite dish is the Chuleta with the pineapple salsa   simple but well executed cocktails  solid service. This is my go-to nicer place to go with guests from out-of-town. Also great for gluten-free options.
ATX Cocina,110,Excellent food served in a beautiful restaurant with a gorgeous and huge outdoor patio.  Great experience and place to take out of town guests.
ATX Cocina,111,Booked a reservation for my mom s birthday a week in advance. Yelp said they were open on the day we were planning on going. I tried to call the restaurant to let them know we would be running 5 min. late  come to find they were closed....on a Friday...no one answered the phone. Really frustrating since we made these plans for her and Open Table let us make reservations for that day. Won t be trying them again.
ATX Cocina,112,ATX Cocina is a great name for this downtown spot that encompasses austin laid back cool vibes with amazing food that puts it over the top. We had a party of 4 and had some great filling apps - Sopas  Nacho and Ceviche that are some of the best around... drinks were just as delicious.   The only thing stopping this 5 star review is the tall hostess at check in didn t acknowledge our presence for 3 minutes starting down at her screen and was very short with us.  All in all great spot and will likely be back.
ATX Cocina,113,yum loved the margarita. The service was great and drinks were good. For sure will be back for food. perfect place to meet up with friends.
ATX Cocina,114,I came here for my friends birthday dinner and the interior of the restaurant was very nice. The outside also seems to have a lovely atmosphere. I ordered the huarache and thought the textures and taste mixed well together. Service was okay but slow  the place stays busy even after closing time.
ATX Cocina,115,First time to Austin daughter just got engaged 30th birthday read great reviews  had an 8 30 reservation drinks were ordered next the food orders were put in after that total chaos after that server was in a panic  things we ordered not available so we changed orders All of the sudden so sorry electrical issues restaurant is closing in less than and hour we ll see what food we can get out to you random food was brought out  that we didn t order our bill was wrong we were issued a BULLSHIT  50 courtesy credit this was may 28th
ATX Cocina,116,Amazing place with a great energy. We went on a weeknight for ally husband s office party  and it was very very busy.  Even though the food was  pre-ordered for us. All the food from appetizers to dessert was amazing.
ATX Cocina,117,Firstly.  YOU GUYS NEED TO BE IN SAN JOSE     On first business trip in 15 months  was excited to sit inside a restaurant  stand at a bar  talk to random strangers etc. They could ve served me a lightly sauteed Dr Marten boot and I d probably have been satisfied after our lengthy imprisonment in the People s Republic of California    First up was guacamole and chips  these alone were off the hook  I have no idea what the hell they did to them to make them so awesome  just the right combinations of freshness  salt and lime. The dishes were all of the small plate variety  all of them were awesome  but the chicken tinga on a flat taco was amazeballs. Great crowd  even on a Tuesday night  awesome staff. Both thumbs up But to finish out DTSJ Cocina  Even sounds better  doyouknowthewaytosanjose
ATX Cocina,118,Not only was the food incredible but the staff was even more amazing. My husband and I had our last meal together here before being deployed for a year. After informing our amazing waitress of this she had a manager send us over champagne dessert and a heartfelt message which was so touching. It was very sincere. Lovely food  great people and the vibes were awesome. We will definitely be back. Thank you 
ATX Cocina,119,Great experience here  Loved our server. He was very attentive and always came to the table at the perfect timing. The food was excellent. We got happy house margaritas  guacamole  tuna tostados and the queso fundido  and something else we are too quick to take a picture. Would absolutely go back 
ATX Cocina,120,I have lived in Austin for 6 years now and by far the best dining experience I ve had. Food was amazing and service was even better. For a party of 10  Gregory still maintained the highest level of service  patience  and friendliness anyone could ask for. If a sixth star was an option  we d choose that. Thanks ATX COCINA AND GREGORY 
ATX Cocina,121,In 2019 this was one of our favorite places in Austin. The food was outstanding  Then we came back in 2021 and were severely disappointed. We ordered almost everything on the appetizer menu and also a few main dishes and just were not impressed with the new menu. The previous menu was light years better. I didn t take photos of the newer items for reference. But I can tell you that they just didn t have the same delicious flavor. Three of us in our party who used to love ATX all agreed that sadly  the new menu just isn t as good as the one in 2019.
ATX Cocina,122,Great service  great food.  I d hit Happy Hour for the margarita--the best I ve had in Austin.  We sampled sooo much...guac  tacos  crab tostada  Hamachi  and the Carne Guisada.  The carne Guisada and tacos stood out.  The wine list was good too.  It was just my wife and I  but we were impressed last night.
ATX Cocina,123,I love this place  The food is amazing and so are the drinks  My go to is the spicy margarita.  We ve been there several times now and have been pleased every time   There dishes are shareable. My favorites are the short rib and carne asada. Make a reservation or know that you ll be waiting at least 30 minutes or more for a table.  5 5 food 5 5 service
ATX Cocina,124,A friend recommended this place for dinner. I went for my birthday celebration and it has easily become my favorite spot  Absolutely incredible.   We had almost everything on the menu and it doesn t disappoint. It s out of this world    I highly recommend this place  Also  the jalape o margarita is absolutely my favorite drink. Second   is the expresso martini. Just Go  It s incredible
ATX Cocina,125,Fabulous food and service. We had an event with various foods served family style. Clients loved every bite. If I lived in Austin I would be a regular 
ATX Cocina,126,My family and I went to ATX Cocina last night and unfortunately we were very disappointed. The reviews and ambiance looked outstanding but  the food was far from that. My brother ordered the chicken dish that the offer as an entr e and it took 45 minutes for it to come out. When we confronted the manger she was not apologetic at all instead she had an egotistical response.
ATX Cocina,127,One of my favorite meals during our trip was here at ATX Cocina. Had high hopes based on the pictures of the exquisite interior and beautiful food  but the actual dining experience exceeded expectations.  The restaurant is gorgeous and elegant  with different subsections of seating  ie the bar lounge area  main dining area  and high tops. Unfortunately didn t get seated in the most optimal area  but luckily our experience improved once the food started coming out.   Ordered an array of falafel tacos  lengua quesadillas  other tapas  and the special black cod. Seriously were blown away by all the flavors and textures and the impressive homemade masa tortillas. The black cod came with a side of those tortillas  encouraging us to create our own fish tacos  which were some of the best I ve ever had.  Would definitely be back for another meal here if we lived in Austin. Highly recommend.
ATX Cocina,128,Went here for a bite and some drinks recently.  Their margaritas are great   We shared the burrata and guacamole and both were fantastic.  For my meal I had the huarache.  HIGHLY recommend this as a meal if sharing appetizers  it s on the appetizer list .  Thankful our server steered me this way   Really great service the server was really knowledgeable and helpful with suggestions.
ATX Cocina,129,We were extremely disappointed.   My friend has been there before and said it was good but this was my first time there.    The food was absolutely awful and the flavor was all wrong.    The best thing we had was the guacamole.  The braised short ribs were uneditable  my friend said there must be new owners because it has gone down.    The manager was very nice though and offered to take off the ribs since we only had a few bites.
ATX Cocina,130,We happened to run into this place by coincidence and I m so glad we did   The food is so different but delicious. We had the carne asada  queso   and a side of the potatoes  which were topped with god knows what but they were fire   The flavors were so unique and balanced so well    amp  Ofcourse a delicious margarita. W tajin on the rim. One of my fav places in Austin now 
ATX Cocina,131,Very good food. The salmon is my favorite  but the best parts of this menu are the small dishes. The corn  nacho  and octopus are all fantastic. The machete is also great. Definitely recommend.
ATX Cocina,132,Love this place  Beautiful design  fun vibe and delicious and beautifully crafted good.
ATX Cocina,133,First dinner in Austin and wanted Mexican. My friends brought me to this fancy Mexican restaurant spot and it s not the cheapest place in town but oh my is it good. The octopus by far was the best thing we had. The food is very different from typical Mexican food served in the states but very similar to the Mexican food I ve had in Mexico. The duck meatballs is probably not something you will ever find in Mexico but they were also very good. The drinks were perfect and I would defiantly say craft cocktails. The restaurant is beautiful and well designed.
ATX Cocina,134,Great food and atmosphere. We took the recommendation from the waiter and it did not disappoint 
ATX Cocina,135,The taste of the food was incredible  watching the wait staff use their fingers to pick the fruit for their customers drinks disgusting  No gloves or tongs were used. The waitress never asked me how I wanted my steak cooked   this is a fundamental when a customer orders a steak.  The time was 915pm but they said they ran out of Diet Coke   was no one bothered to change the gas or syrup 
ATX Cocina,136,Outstanding menu  service  food. The chipotle carrots and Brussels were both outstanding as was our carne asada. Loved the restaurant interior as well. Try this restaurant for sure.
ATX Cocina,137,This place is not closed and the food is absolutely amazing    I ordered the carne asada with a side of brussel sprouts and the best ever  Seriously  the taste is out of this world. We sat in the back bar and Andy the bartender was incredible. We ordered the ATX Margarita and the best on the menu for margaritas. Andy made us feel like family and we will definitely be back. 5 stars for sure    
ATX Cocina,138,This review is pre-shutdown. I really enjoyed my visit to ATX Cocina and I also never had to urge to return. I enjoyed the lively loud NYC LA weekday night vibe but I also was turned off my the deep-fried vegetarian everything. Don t get me wrong  it was really flavorful but I m too old for a whole meal of deep-fried things now. I do appreciate the 100  gluten-free kitchen. And the cocktails were right on    So for the vibe - I recommend it strongly if that s the scene you re hoping for - I do once in a while. For the vegetarian food options  not so much. When you do plan your visit  expect to smile politely or test your lip-reading skills because audible conversation is near impossible here.
ATX Cocina,139,GREAT cocktails  yummy food  and chic  vibrant ambiance.   Due to the current pandemic  the menu has limited options as well the menu is all online which is great. The food was fantastic  flavorful  and fresh. Unfortunately are service was very very slow and sitting on the patio it didn t seem as if the tables were spread far enough apart to abide by social distancing guidelines. Someone was seated at the table next to us.   As others have stated GET THE SOPES  of the dishes we ordered this was 100  my favorite. The guac was amazing to a bit spicy but still very yummy. I ll definitely be back.
ATX Cocina,140,Some of the best tacos me and my wife have ever had  We tried the daily special tacos of chicken and fish and every bite was amazing  Can t wait to come back 
ATX Cocina,141,We were here for a bachelorette party this weekend. We made the reservation long in advance and split a few apps  small plates  and entrees for the table. We arrived at 8 15PM  the time of our reservation  and we ordered drinks and dinner promptly. Dinner didn t arrive until 10 30PM. We ate in ten minutes and left. INSANE. For ten girls we only got a few entrees and things to split  it wasn t as if we were each waiting on our own carne asada plate. For the price  the service was poor quality and experience not enjoyable. The bride was even scolded for having a vape pen  nicotine only  sitting on the table. She was told she would be thrown out if seen using it. BAD customer service.
ATX Cocina,142,We tried this spot around the summer time  and we absolutely loved it. The drinks and food were amazing  My boyfriend is a vegetarian and it s really hard to sometimes find options for him.   Unfortunately they have changed their menu recently  and we personally enjoyed their old menu more. So for this reason we won t be coming back until the menu changes. They took their tacos off the menu  So sad
ATX Cocina,143,What a great find in a great location downtown Austin.  Came for an early dinner  6pm  to find a cool place already filled with beautiful people eating beautiful food... clearly I was out of my league    Taylor H. was an amazing server making me feel welcomed  I was dining alone  and offered great recommendations.  Started with the empanadas  which were delicious  order from the happy hour menu and save six bucks   followed by the short rib - nice portion   tender   nice heat   great flavor. The pumpkin seed semifredo was awesome   Rarely give 5 stars  but they are deserved better.  Definitely a return visit required 
ATX Cocina,144,I have been here twice. For my gluten-intolerant friends  you can eat anything  The first time I came with one friend  and it was amazing. The service was great. The second time  I went with 6 people. On a Monday. It was SO FREAKING LOUD WE COULD NOT HEAR THE PERSON SITTING ACROSS FROM US. And trying to hear the waiter with a mask on  was just impossible. They need to focus more on the experience of the guest and less on the aesthetic. The food also on our second go-round was well done  but basic.
ATX Cocina,145,Everything was flavorful and unique. Portions all meant to be shared and super filling. The margs were also very strong.
ATX Cocina,146,Went here for a work dinner while visiting Austin  from San Diego . The food was incredible and the service was great. Super cool atmosphere and excellent margaritas. Definitely worth checking out 
ATX Cocina,147,Taylor was our server and she was really great in every respect.  The food was so tasty and beautifully presented. The cocktails were delicious.  Really appreciated having our special occasion. Acknowledged with proseco  dessert and a hand signed birthday wishes card. It s these things that make a restaurants a standout.  All in all - a great dining experience.
ATX Cocina,148,ATX Cocina... where do I begin  Everything about the dinner service was fantastic. Our waiter carried us through the menu and made sure we made the right choices to satisfy our expectations. Instead of letting us order a massive tomahawk  he warned us it might be too big to eat after everything else we ve ordered.. most waiters would take your money and run in this situation. On top of the great service  all of our food was so delicious  The whole red snapper was cooked to perfection and just like our waiter said it would  the taste transported us to Mexico. I d give more stars if I could.. ATX cocina is the best Mexican fine dining in Austin 
ATX Cocina,149,Excellent service. Food is incredible. Hamachi with the shoestring potatoes was delicious. Great location and the cocktails are very good. Can t go wrong. I wish was hungry enough to order some steak but perhaps next time.
ATX Cocina,150,ATX Cocina may have the best margarita in all of ATX and it s included in their daily happy hour. Their regular marg is excellent  but if you want something a little more strong and unique  order the Rita Real marg. It may change your life.  The food is great as well especially their tacos  empanadas  and their chips and guacamole  the chips are long thin chips with sesame seeds on top .  The service is impeccable and the space gorgeous. If you get their right when they open  go to the bar in the very back for a more personal experience.
ATX Cocina,151, 85 pork chop  I ve had better.   15 sugary margarita with barely any tequila  Yea I m good.   40 salmon filet  Not bad  but have had better  Spending nearly  400  on your bday for 4 people and not getting a complimentary desert from the waiter  Lol won t be returning.  If you like overpriced American food with zero substance masqueraded as Mexican food  this may be your spot.
ATX Cocina,152,Good service good food. We really enjoyed the guacamole and salmon entree. However the tuna appetizer was fishy and had to be sent back. Everything else wonderful 
ATX Cocina,153,I celebrated my birthday here last year and the food was exquisite. After coming back during Covid  the menu has changed drastically and I m afraid not for the best. The food was extremely spicy and the restaurant floor was filthy.   However  I can t say it enough but the service is always immaculate. They really do have great servers but there is just too much going on with the food.  I will say the only reason I rated this place 2 stars is because of the service and hostess experience. I had made a reservation and we still waited over 30 mins for them to clean a table in the far back. They didn t care that we had to wait and never checked on us  I understand it s covid and not all tables are being used but we were seated in the worst section and it was still dirty.
ATX Cocina,154,My family visited Austin in October and had a wonderful experience. By far  our favorite experience and restaurant were ATX Cocina.    As a family  we were riding scooters  trying to find a restaurant all over Austin. We looked at Google reviews and were trying to choose the best restaurant for all of us. We went to four different restaurants  and either they were closed  although it was posted  they were open  or not appropriate for our son.   Then we came across ATX Cocina after the fourth restaurant letting us down.  I called to ensure they were open and would seat us.  The lady who answered the phone said  we will make it work. They were packed.  She set us up by the chef cooking and asked if this would work.  We did not mind because we were hungry and tired.     To us  this was the best seat in town. We hit the goldmine   Taylor  an amazing lady who was the waitress  walked up and was extremely helpful and friendly.  She recommended wines and dishes.  Chef John heard us and asked if we were open to trying new things. YES  YES  The appetizers he made were off the charts....even our son tried the sushi.    We stayed for several hours.  When we were leaving  we thanked Taylor and John for the most phenomenal experience.  I started asking Taylor about Austin and how she got here  etc. She shared her story and mentioned her birthday. WE HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY   The cherry on top.  Thank you  ATX Cocina  for the best restaurant experience.  You all deserve recognition not only for the food  service  and friendly team 
ATX Cocina,155,After opening for a week and then shutting down for a few weeks during these difficult times ATX Cocina is BACK  Honestly anyone who has been here and tried their food knows how flipping good it is. Like it is for all restaurants  quality is definitely important and it can be hard to meet those standards with takeout. However  I am happy to report that the quality at ATX has not gone down one bit    We ordered via phone  you can also order online . Please note that word of ATX reopening has spread quickly so you will most likely have to reserve a time a day or two in advanced. When we went to pick the order up  they had a cute little bar out front where you tell them your name for the order. We waited about 10-15 minutes which was completely fine because they had complimentary margaritas available    More of a sample now but I will take it   We got the sopes  elote  and the barbacoa short rib  see pic . The sopes are probably one of my favorite things in Austin tbh. So packed with flavor  from the crisp yet soft shell to the super tender pulled pork with a touch of sweetness from the pickled onions and a kick from the jalapenos. Just get them  The elote typically comes off the cob  but that was the only  inconvenience.  Still so yummy and I wish we would have ordered five more. For the barbacoa short rib  these also came with I believe 5 fresh corn tortillas  and we filled each of those babies up as much as we could. This meal did not disappoint at all    Side note  The chile roasted chicken is some of the best chicken I have had in my life. We wanted that in place of the barbacoa  but they didn t have it the first day they opened back up. It should be back now though  I highly recommend it   Tip  These plates are intended to be shared  Get a more of the small plates and then maybe one entree to share so you can try a lot of different things 
ATX Cocina,156,Fine place.  Trendy atmosphere.  Every food item was a salt bomb  other than the guacamole  which was fresh and excellent . Won t go back.
ATX Cocina,157,We called and made a reservation about 45 minutes before arriving.  When we got there they told us our table was booked for about an hour and fifteen minutes after we sat.  They basically told us we d need to be finished and ready to give up our table when the other party came.  I ve never been told this at any restaurant and I wish they d told me that on the phone when I called.   I might have gone to another place. That said the good was really good  service was attentive and the dishes came out spaced well.  I d come back but just wish they were a little more up front when you call in.
ATX Cocina,158,Absolutely amazing    We took clients here for dinner and everyone loved their meals. We all got a bunch of shared plates  and nobody left hungry. Every single item had a ton of robust flavors  and was absolutely delicious. We left no food untouched.  The shrimp and octopus were my favorites 
ATX Cocina,159,Still actually in the restaurant. Everything was delicious except the esquites which were  meh.  The restaurant is beautiful but freezing. Everyone has their coat on. Our server and our bartender were both very nice.
ATX Cocina,160,This places has some of the best happy hour drinks and small bites  The tacos come in a set of two and definitely are jam packed with meat.  Very fast service and waitress was very knowledgeable about menu items.  Ceviche was definitely a hit  helpful hint ask for a few chips so you can have that crunch factor
ATX Cocina,161,Everyone from the hostess to the waitress and even the manager were SO RUDE   I didn t even get to try anything because they treated us  2 ladies  so bad  which we decided to leave   NEVER AGAIN  The resturant is not all about the food and ATX Cocina is truly having a terrible manner.
ATX Cocina,162,Great food - omg get the SOPES  Highly recommend    Great service - forgot the gentlemen s name but he was a younger white male with glasses who actually spoke Spanish  A couple of us are vegetarians so he ensured we were covered and made alterations to our order - that s service    Beautiful restaurant- visiting from out of town  was looming for an upscale classy but casual place for a girls night out dinner. Perfect spot  Also a good date spot too    Would recommend and visit again 
ATX Cocina,163,This was our first meal in Austin and wow did we start it off right  We started with small plates  then moved into the heavy hitters on the menu. Our first small plate was the crab tostada  which was specifically recommended to us by our server. The tomatillo salsa and cherry tomatoes added a bright acidity  which complemented the sweetness of the crab. It was a great appetizer because although it was light on your tummy  it was heavy on the flavor.  Our second small plate was the Campechana  which was basically a ceviche with shrimp  octopus  and salsa roja. It was similar to the crab tostada in its brightness and freshness  but the salsa roja gave it more of a smokiness and spicy after-burn.  We then finished off our meal with the patos locos tacos  crazy duck tacos . They were again specifically recommended to us by our server and he didn t steer us wrong either time. The duck was tender  juicy  and the salsa verde cut right through the gamy richness. Every bite kept you coming back for more. If you re looking for upscale Mexican food in Austin  I would definitely recommend checking out ATX Cocina.
ATX Cocina,164,This was our favorite meal in Austin - this place is a must if you re looking for a great dinner spot with a laid back but trendy atmosphere.   We started off with apps including hamachi  empanadas  burrata and guacamole. The empanadas were amazing  They had a smoke flavor and were definitely unique as compared to other traditional empanadas. We even ordered more afterward. Burrata was on point as well. This was followed up with a delicious Caesar salad  the dressing was lemony and not a traditional creamy caesar  with Parmesan crisps on top. Highly recommend and it s huge  Finally we ordered a 38oz bone-in ribeye sliced to share. It was topped with chili butter. Out of this world. We shared the potatoes bravas as a side. These are really spicy but so yummy and huge.  Greg was our server and was probably the most friendly person I ve ever met. He was dealing with 8 women which can be overwhelming but he did a fantastic job  Thanks Greg.   Do yourself a favor and go to this place 
ATX Cocina,165,Everything is so good here.  The Caesar salad  papas  carrots  short rib  bass  and the sopes  AND FLAN  You have to get the flan.  I ve been a handful of times and the services has been top notch.
ATX Cocina,166,This is one of my favorite date night spots  The food is amazing and the staff is great 
ATX Cocina,167,I am sad about this 3 star post as I have only heard great things about this restaurant. Maybe we ordered the wrong things or it was an off night for our server.  The famous queso was pooling with orange grease from the chorizo  I guess you have to expect that from chorizo honestly   and it s not really queso it s melted real cheese so it s stringy and needed to but cut and it was hard to pick up and serve  . You have to cut and chop it  up avoiding the oil and spoon into a corn tortilla which were warm and yummy. It was different and not really my thing or my 2 girlfriends thing. I think the grease was little off putting.   The 2 crudos ordered as entrees were overall good but one my girlfriends had the hamachi skin still on her pieces she did not like  that at all. Her comment is if they are suppose to remove that  Then she had ordered a wine and it never came till a second reminder when we were almost done with the dinner.   My Caesar salad was huge  Enough to share with all 3 of us. Evenly coated  with dressing and the baby romaines were perfect bite -sized . Loved that.   I would definitely like to  come back to try the short rib or one of the other dishes and give it another chance when I have not had a late lunch .
ATX Cocina,168,Had date night here. The atmosphere was awesome  A very lovely take on authentic modern Mexican food  Definitely will be coming back 
ATX Cocina,169,We enjoyed our visit to this restaurant.  The food is unique and great for sharing. We sat at the bar  and the gentlemen behind the bar were amazing  quick on their feet  and friendly. The only one negative is how sound carries in this restaurant. It s definitely loud and festive  Be prepared  
ATX Cocina,170,Awesome vibe  food and drinks. Everything you need to have a good time with a group of friends 
ATX Cocina,171,What you re lookin  at  Barbacoa beef short-rib  jalape o-chayote escabeche  cashews  and verduras  brussel sprouts  verde chorizo  green mole    This place was bomb and I had a ton of different dishes here but these two were hands down my favorite. The short rib melted in your mouth and was just so so so good  tender  flavorful and the jalape os gave it a kick every now and then. This is an absolute must get if you come here. Also the brussel sprouts  normally I m not a big fan of them but these were the leafs of the sprouts and were crunchy like a chip  I was surprised by this dish the most  another must if your come here.
ATX Cocina,172,Was amazing  Food and service were perfect. The sopes  which were recommended by our server Sierra  great   were so so good but I loved everything we had. So happy to have a gluten free kitchen - thank you  
ATX Cocina,173,This is the definition of  just fine . Food was all mediocre. Queso fundido had no meat in it. The single nacho gimmick on one giant tortilla just doesn t work. The tortilla was overdone but I will say that the chicken topping was good. Brussels sprouts can hardly be called that because it was only Brussels sprout leaves. No actual vegetable. but the worst part was the service. Three bartenders for a MAX 18 seat bar and we felt ignored. No one asked how our food was so we didn t get to tell them it was only  fine . Will not return.
ATX Cocina,174,Fun place to enjoy downtown Austin  The menu offers a variety to accommodate any dietary needs  The food is very flavorful and they have a nice Sri k menu
ATX Cocina,175,Wow  We picked a perfect place to celebrate my best friend s engagement. First of all  I would definitely recommend making a reservation. It was packed  even on a Monday  Extremely cute decor and layout. Lots of different seating options  which I always think is cool. We started off with ATX margaritas  which our waiter recommended. They were absolutely delicious  Then we had the lump crab tostada  the guacamole  and the smashed fingerling potatoes with chile aioli.  All of the above were insanely amazing. Our waiter was attentive and helpful and our three appetizers really really just blew me away. For our main dish  we split the carne asada tacos and I was a little disappointed with how fatty the meat was  but it was still good  We especially loved the green salsa that it came with.  Definitely check this place out  We will be back for suuuure 
ATX Cocina,176,This was a really good happy hour  We had all the food and drink offerings plus the Hamachi crudo. I really enjoyed it all. For me  it was a bit too spicy and the crudo was lacking a bit of salt but my boyfriend loved it all. I was not a fan of the special HH drink  Paloma and House marg were good . The patio was chill and we were sat quickly. The inside looked super inviting. Downside was normal downtown traffic and parking...what s new   
ATX Cocina,177,Food was crave-worthy  Outdoor patio is dreamy  100  gluten free menu is priceless for a celiac 
ATX Cocina,178,Man I should have came here forever ago. I ve been missing out. They have a great happy hour from 4 30-6 30. I suggest coming here around 5 on a Friday before it gets packed. I love their drinks and food. We ended up staying past happy hour and ordering from there. Their wild caught salmon was cooked perfectly. Service was top notch. Vibe is pretty cool. Parking can be a bit of a pain though. I will be back here again 
ATX Cocina,179,Willis  the manager  is extremely unqualified to manage a restaurant. Zero people skills doesn t know how to talk to people. As an owner of 3 businesses I know the importance of taking care of people. That was my first and last time there.
ATX Cocina,180,Wow What a great time. We had the Acapulco ceviche  goat tacos Delicious     And we couldn t end the night without the seven lenguas tequila shots. I m very pleased with the way they serve your meal. When they take your meal to your table they repeat what you re having. It was a great experience. I m glad we came here to try the food.   I m wondering what their lunch menu looks like we re coming back 
ATX Cocina,181,Delicious cocktails  amazing food  the sea bass and oysters were particularly delicious  outstanding service and great ambiance. Definitely going to recommend to anyone looking for good eats in Austin.
ATX Cocina,182,Again  this restaurant never disappoints  The service is impeccable and the food was amazing. I would recommend reserving a table ahead of time because it tends to fill up quickly. I liked the Cangrejo ceviche out of all the other ceviches I have tried  A thing I tend to not like is a very watery and soupy ceviche. The Cangrejo is creamy and I loved the large chunks of crab meat in it  Definitely a must-have. As for the main  we listened to our waiter and ordered the fried cod  off-menu . We made our own fried fish tacos and it was delicious. Although the food and drinks are expensive  it is definitely worth it 
ATX Cocina,183,I ve been wanting to try this place because I ve heard only good things. I went with two other friends and ordered 2 main dishes  2 happy hour menus  1 raw dish  and 1 side dish  and 1 appetizer portion dish. We were afraid it might be too much but actually turned out to be perfect.   We started off with empanada and they were amazing. I liked all the dishes but my absolute favorite was the queso cheese dish. It was so good I wanted to have all to myself. Next fav was the corn  and I also liked the short rib. There were plenty seats available for friday night  although I made reservations through OpenTable just to make sure.   Overall very pleased and will def go back
ATX Cocina,184,What a disappointing experience and this ain t my first time here.  We sat at the bar waited 1 hr 20 min for our food and we finally got fed up and told the bartender that we didn t want to wait any longer.  He was just like oh I m sorry and actually charged us for our drinks and appetizer.  Didn t call a manager over to try to make it right or anything. Never checked on our food and didn t seem to even be aware that we had been waiting that long.  Completely unacceptable.  We are pretty understanding people but we just want to know what is going on. After tonight  we will never come back.  If management reads this  you need better trained staff. This is not our first negative experience here.
ATX Cocina,185,Celebrated a lovely birthday dinner with the bestie. Dined family style including brussel sprouts salad  tuna tartare  duck meatballs  masa cakes and key lime pie. Delish across the board. 13 10 would recommend for any occasion.
ATX Cocina,186,Ah-mazing. Came in for dinner with my family  high standards  this bunch  and everyone was blown away by the fresh ingredients and incredible flavors. We had a reservation for 845 and the place was still packed that late  We were seated promptly  however  and our friendly waiter took the time to explain the menu and call out his favorites. Also  the restaurant is gluten free   To start  we had the empanadas and some sort of spicy shrimp and avocado ceviche  campechana . The empanadas were warm and filled with ooey gooey delicious cheese. But the ceviche...ohhh lordy  that ceviche. Unbelievable  spicy  fresh  authentic-tasting. It was a show stopper.  Next  we tried the duck carnitas which were cooked to perfection and served with corn tortillas. delicious. We then tried the short rib  which again  was cooked to absolute perfection. Lean mean and a decent portion for sharing. For sides  just get the brussel sprouts and prepare to fight over seconds  P  Can t say enough about how delicious this place is and we can t wait to go back and try more off the menu 
ATX Cocina,187,We had a lovely intimate pre-dinner with my sister here for her birthday. I spotted this place during my last trip to Austin and bookmarked it for the future. So when we saw they have a happy hour for a couple hours after they open at 4 30 pm  we decided it was a great time to stop by. At 4 40 pm 4 or 5 tables were taken already. It was chilly outside and we were a little surprised how cold it was inside as well - the hostess said it will get warmer once more bodies are seated in the room. Though not comforting at that moment  she was actually right - by 5 15 pm the place was full and buzzing.   We had a couple cocktails - as recommended by our waitress - and were very pleased. One was Salma Hayek  and the other also named after an actress - they both were really good and all ingredients are listed on the menu. We loved the burrata with heirloom tomatoes - first for the gorgeous presentation  and second for the taste. Even though burrata is Italian  the chef gave it a successful Mexican twist  and the green salsa was particularly refreshing.   I d say the last 15 minutes of our one hour visit  we were frequented by our waitress a little too often - but I get it  they needed the tables as the dinner crowd was coming in. We continued on to the True Food Kitchen for our dinner  but I will definitely be back to try more. They have a lovely patio outside  that looked perfect for warm summer nights.
ATX Cocina,188,Great food     We have tried most of the dishes and never disappoints. Wish we had this in Houston. Best guacamole in town 
ATX Cocina,189,Fantastic food  great ambiance. Highly recommend the queso fundido  amp  carne asada... both had a great mix of flavor and spice.
ATX Cocina,190,Went here tonight for dinner and waited an hour and a half for our food until we told our server to just bring us the bill.  We sat at the bar and the bartender never even acknowledged that things were running slow or apologized. He brought us our bill with nothing comped nor brought a manager over to apologize.  I ve been in the service industry before and totally understand sometimes shit happens... but to not even be acknowledged or apologetic was very disappointing.  Will not be returning.
ATX Cocina,191,Wow  I have heard several foodie friends say ATX Cocina is the best new restaurant they have tried this year and now I can see why. From gorgeous open space  exceptional wine list  enticing cocktails  and perfectly executed cuisine..this new restaurant is a must try.   I stopped in during happy hour and indulged in ros    3 off glasses of wine during hh  and the queso fundido   9 hh . The sizzling thick gooey fundido served with house made blue corn tortilla is pure bliss. I sampled my friends cocktails and they were wonderful. We also tried a couple of the crudos which are pricey but completely worth it  The flavors compliment each other beautifully.  Perfect for date night  girls night out and intimate gathering.
ATX Cocina,192,We dined at ATX Cocina many times before COVID-19.  Since COVID  we have used their Meals  amp  Margs on the Go curbside service about four times.  Each time the service has been terrific and the food very well suited for take home.  The portions are very large.  Our orders for two people usually serve six meals.  They have done an exceptional job of rationalizing their menu to the environment--what will travel well  what do people want right now  what works for the limited staff.  We have had the guacamole  they serve different chips now   caesar salad  campechana  ceviche   the half chili roasted chicken  all of the different tacos--fish  barbacoa  pork  elotes  escabeche  vegetables  and gelato de canela  cinnamon ice cream .  All of the food was prepared with that ATX Cocina unique flavor and style and with care.  We hope you guys are doing ok   Happy to support you while you keep downtown ATX fed. Thank you for figuring out a curbside version of your great concept   We love it.
ATX Cocina,193, 400 for 5 people. 4 of us ordered a  margarita   15 each  that were really small. I ordered  king prawn  that ended up being three very small shrimp lying in cream sauce next to three very large shrimp heads. That s it - no rice or anything and it was about 3 tablespoons of cream sauce. I understand the rent is high in downtown Austin and I am always willing to pay and tip over and above but this was a complete rip off and we won t be back.
ATX Cocina,194,Our group sat outside in the spacious and quiet patio and had one of the best meals of the year  The queso fundido was luscious as were the pork tomahawk pibil  braised short ribs and roasted chicken. The Cesar salad was bright and tangy and one of the best I ve ever had along with the hamachi to start.  Service was quick and courteous and the enormous watermelon drink reminded me of spring break in Cancun. This is absolutely one of my favorites now.
ATX Cocina,195,Wow. Best meal I ve ever had  I can t recommend this place enough. Not only was the food fantastic but the server  manager  and atmosphere were as well  I highly recommend ATX COCINA 
ATX Cocina,196,4.5. Stunning space with such a large dining area  2 bars and a gorgeous very large back deck   We went for happy hour  4 30-6 30p daily  and enjoyed  3 off wine and beer and  4 off select plates   Be sure to get the guacamole and ask for extra crispy tortillas because you ll need them  The guac portion is huge  It s also the best guac I ve had - the herbs in it set it apart from others you ve enjoyed.   The queso fundido is a must  There is chorizo inside and it s oh so good    Try the papusas  The bean and cheese combo is perfect and it oozes out at every bite.   I was very impressed with the wine selection. They have tons of mezcal if you re into that. My friend ordered a margarita without agave and it was on point    All in all  a wonderful experience  The dining area was packed when we left around 7pm.  Be sure to sit out back if the weather is nice. Their patio is really quite the cozy spot 
ATX Cocina,197,Gregory the waiter did a fantastic job. We were celebrating a wedding and a baby and he went above and beyond to make the experience a great one. The food was amazing and the drinks were a little too good. This place is expensive but worth the money.
ATX Cocina,198,Before dining at this particular restaurant we had very high hopes. Unfortunately it wasn t as good as we hoped it would be ... the drinks were lacking and my whiskey sour was pretty much just sour really really sour. The was good and fair portions but when our 52 oz ribeye came out it was very undercooked. We had late reservations so maybe that had something to do with it. I d like to give it another try maybe trying an earlier reservation. Till next time 
ATX Cocina,199,Make a reservation  Great spot to hit up in downtown Austin. Very hip and modern with a selective menu  so they focus on the quality of the foods being prepared. Instead of chips and salsa  they give corn tortillas with an assortment of different dips in order of spice level. The green one was my favorite  with fresh avocado and a hint of spice. We ordered the fundido to start  then the carne asada and smashed papas bravas to split  and it was definitely enough for 2 people. The fundido was HOT and FRESH  still sizzling in the iron cask and was oozing with cheesy goodness. The carne asada was amazing. Perfectly cooked and not chewy like most steaks in restaurants. We made a good choice with the papas bravas  but the Brussel sprouts looked amazing as well. the papas were seasoned to perfection and had an aioli type sauce on it. Everything went splendidly together.
ATX Cocina,200,Great ambience. Great service. Perfectly prepared food and presented with delicate taste. Portions not too small or too big. I felt so satisfied with each dish  from the variety to the freshness to the perfectly prepared presentations. I will definitely be back many times. Oh drinks were good too  And the dessert.
ATX Cocina,201,I love the food  seating and service.  Parking is terrible because it s located in downtown Austin.  They typically have valet parking but have gotten rid of that service since COVID.  Masks are required to get in and walk around at least in June 2020.  They also cut their menu in half and changed the offerings.   Pre COVID my favorite dish was the sea bass served whole on a banana leaf.  They don t have it on the menu anymore.  I ordered the mahi-mahi with a cilantro sauce on lemon wrapped in banana leaf.  It was served with a tomato sauce with green olives and basil rice.  The fish was moist and tasty.  Combined well with sauce.  We also got the octopus and shrimp  guacamole and green salsa tapas.  I could have had the octopus dish as my dinner.  It was my favorite dish tonight.  Everything is gluten free.  Their chips were outstanding   Great place for large groups  date night or business dinner.  I highly recommend this place.  You can t go wrong with anything you order.
ATX Cocina,202,Solid GF experience. Beautiful setting especially with that 6pm flow coming in. Started with the GYT  really exquisite looking and although wasn t my favourite  i  m sure it s perfect for those who enjoy sweeter cocktails. Scallops and quesadilla  these blue corn tortillas are to die for  were both fantastic  as was the octopus. Barbacoa  you must order side tortillas - they come in 4s  was melt in your mouth brilliant. Charred broccoli was the perfect accompaniment  seriously the most delicious broccoli dish you can imagine. Too full for dessert  opted for a barside margarita instead. Super smooth lunazul blanco tequila and just a hint of sweet with the tart. Andy is a gem. Naturally wish the big bosses  amp  head chefs were Mexican  but hopefully the second tier managers are. Still  can t dock points from those who just get it right
ATX Cocina,203,The food here is amazing. We had the nachos to start and I had carne asada as the main course. I highly recommend trying their horchata ice cream for dessert too.
ATX Cocina,204,Good food except clearly unsanitary. Had a hair in my fish taco    was hoping for a better experience 
ATX Cocina,205,I ve never experienced  Modern Mexican  but after halfway doing so  I d compliment their vast tequila selection  people watching  beautiful decor  and grand architectural. Aesthetically a sight to see  well executed down to the smallest details. Bravo.   This review is based on Happy Hour  great chicken tacos and house margarita  so taking into consideration the server s time limitation explaining the menu  I left only less as confused I when I arrived. Salsa trio was unexpectedly a favorite  very flavorful. Nothing else was a stand out.   I d recommend visiting for dinner  with time is available to learn about the food and culture behind it.
ATX Cocina,206,One of the BEST restaurants in the city. I had high expectations and the food absolutely exceeded them. We ordered Guacamole  Atun  Patatas Bravas and 30oz of the  El Jefe  steak. It was absolutely worth it. The entire meal was spiced to perfection  clearly made from the best ingredients and definitely thoughtfully presented. I would highly recommend making the splurge for the El Jefe- worth the hype.   While the food was amazing  we were also praising the staff who took such good care of each customer. The restaurant was packed  but the waitstaff and servers did not show any sign of being overwhelmed. They took the time to explain dishes  make recommendations and take care of each table. I never had to remind the staff for anything I asked for. At the end of our meal  our waiter gave us a card that read  congrats   because we mentioned that my fianc  s new job is the reason we just moved to Austin  Needless to say  both of us were speechless when we opened the card to see so many signatures and wishes written out from the restaurant. Overall  our date night had become an unbelievable experience and we aren t sure how we could top this    We can t wait to go back 
ATX Cocina,207,We were in town for the weekend  amp  stopped by for dinner... the guac  amp  chips were fresh tasty... the carne asada  short ribs  fries   amp  brussel sprouts were beyond delicious  JAMES was our server and he was AMAZING  He was knowledgeable about menu items  energetic   amp  made dietary accommodations for our group  Excellent customer service  amp  food here   
ATX Cocina,208,Yes yes yes. This is where I take my friends when the visit from out of town. Make reservations and make sure to come with an empty stomach.
ATX Cocina,209,Because I m Mexican and I reside in Austin. People often asked me what s my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin.   ATX Cocina  it s not just the best it s authentic gourmet Mexican food.  Service is always friendly and knowledgeable of their plates. Menu is always fun  Since they keep adding new items  seasonal and so on.  Here are some pictures of my last date with my wife at ATX Cocina.
ATX Cocina,210,We have been to this restaurant twice when visiting Austin and this restaurant is an excellent choice  Food is amazing and offers good variety. Drinks are a good match for the food and there is a velvet good selection of tequila and mezcal. Atmosphere is happy and comfortable and the service was really attentive and excellent.
ATX Cocina,211,Love love Atx Cocina   One of my favorite spots to go for date night. The duck is by far the best. Love how everything is gluten free and fresh. Highly recommend   
ATX Cocina,212,I usually love this place  one of my favorite spots as an Austin local. But I will absolutely NEVER RETURN. This was the most absurd restaurant experience I ve ever had. We had reservations and didn t get seated for AN HOUR. It is absolutely ridiculous  the hostesses did not care at all. If they re busy  your reservation will mean absolutely nothing. I like to have grace with restaurants but this was the most absurd experience. I like this place but the customer service makes it not worth it at all. Go elsewhere if you want to have a good experience  
ATX Cocina,213,Oh my flipping gawd. The broccoli was to DIE for. Michelle  the hostess  and Matt  our server  were great  I wouldn t change a thing about the food  even the salad was sexy  This place is like a step above Loro. I d highly recommend coming here with 4 people to try everything 
ATX Cocina,214,Definitely a fan of ATX Cocina and I would love to go back  The atmosphere  the food  the service  the list of positives is long so here s my experience.  I met up with a few girlfriends after a loooonnnngggg day of work. To my delight  we were there right before the happy hour cut-off and we each enjoyed a couple of cocktails before ordering our meal.   Once happy hour ended  we ordered the guac and queso fundido to share for an appetizer. Due to the prices  we decided to share our entrees  the carne asada and duck carnitas  along with sides of corn and potatoes. The guac tasted so fresh and flavorful  luckily it came in a huge bowl the size of half of our table  The queso fundido is served with warm tortillas and I think that could have been my entire meal. So creamy  cheesy  and delectable. For the entrees  I did not get to try the carne  so I take it was delicious since my friends finished it no problem  My other friend and I shared the duck carnitas and they were very flavorful and so tender that they fell apart when we barely touched it with our fork. The sides were also nothing short of fantastic and full of flavor   With all our rounds of ordering  drinks  and just talking  we spent about 2-3 hours there and never felt rushed. It was a great atmosphere and very crowded  even on a Wednesday night. I would say the only drawback is the price. Even on happy hour  the cocktails were  7- 9 and then all the entrees are priced over  20. I think it s a really nice place  but be prepared to spend when you have a night out here 
ATX Cocina,215,This was hands down the best meal our group had in Austin this year for SXSW.  Still a few more days  amp  meals left to go but I just know there won t be another restaurant that comes close  also really wondering if we should come here again while we re in town but reservations are so hard to get  .    To start we got the queso fundido and the guacamole - both were delicious but honestly the queso was spectacular.  Super cheesy but not heavy and oh so salty and delicious.  We also got the hamachi and the atun crudo which were also super amazing.  The atun was so good that I almost ordered another one just for myself   We also got the sope which was probably the highlight of all the appetizers  so hard to pick a winner  .  The dough was just so soft yet crunchy yet doughy at the same time and the pork belly was melt in your mouth soft.  For entrees we shared the barbacoa  the carne asada  and the chili roasted chicken.  We also got all 3 sides  the corn  brussel sprouts  and the smashed paps bravas .  Aside from the brussel sprouts  which were good but I like my brussel sprouts whole and not just the leaves   everything was absolutely amazing   If I had to pick a favorite it would have to be the barbacoa but we enjoyed everything and at any other restaurant any of the other dishes would ve been the star.  For dessert we ended getting all 3 - the flan  the chocolate cake  and the pumpkin seed mousse.  All 3 were amazing   The pumpkin seed mousse was incredibly interesting and surprisingly delicious.  We did end up getting 2 more orders of the flan just because it was so good   Lastly  as amazing as our food was  it was the service that took our experience to the next level.  Our waitress was absolutely amazing   I m so upset I forgot her name but she had amazing earrings and was so patient and friendly with us throughout all 3 hours of our dinner.  Also  our hamachi was delayed  we didn t even notice  and someone came over to apologize that there was a mess up in the kitchen and that it would be brought over soon.  Not even kidding  I m trying to figure out when I can come back to Austin so I can come back to ATX Cocina again.  Thank you for an amazing meal 
ATX Cocina,216,I m really not sure why this place only has 4 stars on Yelp. I loved this place.  Highly recommend the food and drinks here.
ATX Cocina,217,Great cocktails. Try the desert rose. Chic decor. Great waitress who was helpful in making selections.  The food was excellent  the crudo was definitely fresh. Really enjoyed the duck carnitas. Leave dessert. But good place to impress with.
ATX Cocina,218,The wait was worth it we sat at the bar and was greeted by a cool bartender named Madison. The food was also really good.
ATX Cocina,219,Super delicious meal  We had guac  very fresh  not too limey   carne asada  cooked perfectly  great flavor   octopus and chorizo dish  flavors and textures were spot on   and grilled broccolini  fresh  huge portion . The drinks were creative and really good. Probably my best meal in Austin. Our server was super friendly. We ate outside on the back patio  which was beautiful 
ATX Cocina,220,We went to ATX Cocina to celebrate our 20th anniversary. What a great choice. The night started with a champagne toast that our server brought along with a HAND SIGNED CARD from much of the staff wishing us well.   Chef Kevin Taylor is doing some amazing work there pumping out amazing fare. We enjoyed fresh guacamole  the salsa sampler with heirloom corn tortillas  and a ceviche like crudo. Then we were blown away by the octopus and shrimp dishes. Flan and a flourless chocolate cake dish rounded out the meal.   The staff really make this place extra special. From the aforementioned card and champagne  to the attentive service and wonderful suggestions from Richard  our server   to a visit from Matt Creekmore GM  to the fact that when I asked where the restroom was the lady I asked didn t point and direct  she said  let me take you over there .   What a great night to celebrate a major milestone in my life along with my wife. We aren t social media people so no pics of the meal. Just a great memory   Thanks ATX Cocina crew.
ATX Cocina,221,Ask for Dementris he treated us great and was so knowledgeable about the menu. GREAT FOOD AND PEOPLE
ATX Cocina,222,Delicious  high quality food. Amazing cocktails. Great out door seating. Friendly and attentive staff 
ATX Cocina,223,This place doesn t even deserve one star... They have a menu printed on both sides  but exactly 5 food items and the rest is liquor. The food isn t even anything special despite being incredibly expensive. These people are trying to reinvent Mexican food but in the most expensive way possible and not even with quality or taste. Don t bother visiting 
ATX Cocina,224,ATX Cocina mixes my two favorite types of restaurant  upscale and Mexican. Came for dinner and enjoyed the ambiance here. Trendy yet comfortable environment.   To start  I got two appetizers  the Heirloom Corn Tortillas  amp  Salsa Tasting and the Guacamole. The salsa tasting was great as it came with 4 different types of flavors such as bean with a sausage aftertaste  salsa verde  one that tastes like chorizo  amp  potato but it s really just a peanut base  the last one was my favorite which was a yellow habanero carrot sauce. As far as the Guacamole - it s as good as you d expect. For my entree  I got the Chili Roasted Chicken. It came with a white mole with bacon. I love this plate  In fact  all the food here is full of flavor and uses authentic ingredients from Mexico.   I received good service and was pretty satisfied with my experience. They are a little pricey  but it s worth it. Will be back again 
ATX Cocina,225,Came on a Friday around 6 30 with no reservations  party of 4. We were told it would be an hour and a half wait so we walked over and sat down at No28 around the corner and had a bottle of wine and an appetizer. Perfect timing we headed over after an hour and were seated.   The interior is lovely  it s very trendy. Prices are high for the portions of dishes but the flavor of each dish truly was great.   After seeing the prices of everything and we had already spent a lot of money that evening prior to arriving here we ordered one of the cheaper bottles of wine. You could tell it immediately annoyed the waiter. His demeanor changed  like he got stuck with a table of peasants. Then we ordered a bunch of apps to share. The guacamole  the snapper crudo  the beet salad  the corn and the Brussels sprouts. We ordered those 5 dishes along with the wine and he asked  so  no protein   Like buddy  back up  raw fish and vegetables are protein and how does he know we aren t a table of vegetarians  pescatarians anyway   We politely said that s what we will start off with for now.   He came by to ask if we wanted another bottle of wine or more food but we declined simply because we were over him.   The snapper crudo and the beet  salad  were beyond tasty and I d come back just for those 2 things  And the red blend wine was fantastic. Just hope I don t get Jared as my waiter again. I can t stand places or people that come off as pretentious.
ATX Cocina,226,If you go -- ask to be seated in James  section   He is our absolute favorite waiter at ATX - incredibly knowledgeable about all of their fresh  and super tasty  tequilas  quick on his feet  funny  attentive  and just an all-around great guy.  He never ceases to be the best part about this restaurant.  Vegetarians DELIGHT   There are more options on the menu for us than you might think-- they ve gone above and beyond to share veggie switches with me to make the SOPA vegetarian as well as a number of other items.    Local Tip  Go to the Happy Hour- killer prices on plates and it s really easy to get a seat at the bar 
ATX Cocina,227,The food was so delicious  and our server Summer was very nice and helpful as we decided what to order.  Highly recommend the caesar salad and the shrimp tacos  Great service great night 
ATX Cocina,228,We went there based on a recommendation from friends.  The menu is awesome.  Lots of well prepared   unique Mexican fusion influenced items.  The drinks were good as was the waitstaff service. I have one complaint however  which is why I only gave 3 stars.   They do not time the preparation of their orders to come out at the same time.  We ordered 3 entrees  one of us was served in a reasonable amount of time.  The second plate came 5 minutes later. The third came after another 10 minutes.    This is something a good restaurant should never do    We alerted to the manager  thinking this was an exception.  Although concerned that we were disappointed  he acknowledged that this was their policy  they just bring out the plates as they become ready without regard to timing.
ATX Cocina,229,Just gotta say this is one of the best places in town. It s got a great vibe and although I always sit at the bar the entire restaurant has a beautiful interior. Their house margarita is perfect and the food is always spot on.
ATX Cocina,230,The WORST management i have EVER experienced. I have been waiting for over 2 HOURS for a simple nacho appetizer.... DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. If i could give negative stars i would.
ATX Cocina,231, Dined  there 10 16. Terrible service. Clueless staff. My overpriced hangar steak came out 20 minutes AFTER my party had already finished their meals. So  I uncomfortably ate alone.  No apology. Nothing to help make up for the kitchen  staff and management s ineptitude. Ridiculous excuses about it being Saturday night. You re in the restaurant business  right  I ve dined there several times in the past two years. The menu and service keep deteriorating. I will never go back and will tell everyone I know what a joke that once awesome restaurant has become.
ATX Cocina,232,Good  not great. Food is overpriced and didn t wow me. The service was mediocre.   Our waiter acted like he was annoyed with us the whole time. We asked questions about the menu that he did not know how to answer. He also didn t write anything down  which is my pet peeve  and of course never brought one of the things we ordered.   The food was good  nothing too memorable. I strongly prefer Suerte if you want excellent Mexican food at this price point.   The best thing we ordered were definitely the empanadas. They were crunchy on the outside and filled with creamy beans on the inside. Great appetizer to share. Guac needed salt and lime. Esquites were good  not too unique. Queso fundido was good. Can t say much about the tacos since our waiter never brought them. Tres leches cake was dry and bland. My Paloma was good but I asked them to make it spicy and they didn t.   My advice to this restaurant is to focus less on how things will appear on Instagram and focus more on giving diners great food and service.
ATX Cocina,233,Wonderful outdoor dining  We got the amazing summer time Hamachi  Machete  and Sopes  The hamachi was amazing 
ATX Cocina,234,WOW  I had an amazing experience at ATX Cocina. I was with a group of over 50 people and the service was friendly  knowledgeable  and just amazing. Everything I ate was delicious  Favorites include the brussel sprouts  chicken  and corn flan.   Beware that most dishes are very spicy  even the chopped salad  but if you just pick out the peppers they become mild.   The entire menu is gluten free and they catered perfectly to vegans and those with nut allergies.   If you are looking to get some upscale  modern  and healthy mexican food while downtown this is the place to go. Thanks ATX 
ATX Cocina,235,Very cool atmosphere that works for a business meal or date night. Best to go with a group as most of the items are meant to share. Everything we ordered was great.
ATX Cocina,236,I would give it 10 stars if I could. The atmosphere was cute and light. The food..... unbelievable. We ordered nearly all small plates and vegetables and could have eaten forever. I recommend trying a little bit of everything.
ATX Cocina,237,My friends and I were looking for a place to eat after a music fest and ATX COCINA came up on Yelp. Decided why not and dropped in for a late dinner around 9pm without a reservation.  The place was PACKED   Was pleasantly surprised to be seated promptly without a wait. Our server was excellent and made sure to explain the menu as it was our first time there. She was really attentive and our meal was also amazing.  We started with the empanadas  YUM   fundido  meh  and patatas bravas  who doesn t love fried potatoes   but the meat is where this place shines. We got both the short rib and lamb and they were TO DIE FOR. I m still dreaming about that yogurt sauce with the lamb as I m writing this review.   Really cool vibes in here and definitely a great establishment for a fancy date night. Just be prepared to spend     so maybe not the best choice for that first tinder date   .   Would definitely recommend and I want to go back and try everything else on the menu    I hear happy hour is great  
ATX Cocina,238,food is great  service not so much.  we were literally asked to leave in 120 sec after ordeing our 3rd drink  amp  payed over  200 for our tab.  quite disappointing.
ATX Cocina,239,ATX Cocina makes dinner for a large group a breeze  We had around 20 people in the party and sat at a long table in a semi private room that was reserved beforehand. Interior decor is beautiful and classy. The staff was very friendly and accommodating the entire night  and let us take our time. We ordered 4-6 sides for the whole table in addition to everyone getting their own entrees or sharing entrees  and it was more than enough food for everyone. We also ordered a couple appetizer dishes to snack on before the main course. The food was so good and flavorful  You can tell it is higher end cuisine but they still give you a good amount of food to keep you satisfied. Well worth the money for the experience and perfect for celebrating a special event 
ATX Cocina,240,As a Mexican from California I m always weary of overpriced Mexican food but this place was so good. Flavors we fresh and amazing. Totally worth the price tag  The carne asada  sopes  Brussels sprouts  esquites and sopes were so good.  We had the ATX and Paloma for drinks and those were also amazing.
ATX Cocina,241,I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the food offerings. Everything was delightfully yummy  oxtail quesadillas  hamachi crudos  shrimp  and swordfish. Honestly  I thought the hamachi crudos might just be another common dish being served at a popular restaurant when my girlfriend ordered it  but I was very surprised how refreshing and zesty it tasted. The taste wasn t overpowering. The seats were very comfortable and the whole restaurant and ambiance was to my liking  spacious. I liked our server a lot  her name was Bridget. She was polite and attentive. I would make another trip back here for sure.
ATX Cocina,242,First time coming here  awful service by Phil our waiter. Disappeared  was not attentive  and was not very nice. Will have to reconsider this place.
ATX Cocina,243,Great food in a fun atmosphere   I highly recommend the bone-in Ribeye. Excellent Ceasar 
ATX Cocina,244,Me and my partner went to dinner on a Friday evening. It was rather loud and hard to hear conversation. The drinks were good  had the house margarita. I enjoyed the guac. The fundido not so much. It was so thick it was hard to spread on the tortillas and in the end felt like eating very dense greasy cheese. The carne asada I also wasn t a fan of. It was grissly and fatty so much so cutting it with the knife was a challenge. My partner had the beef short rib which was excellent. For dessert we had some chocolate topped with vanilla ice cream and cinnamon leche which was also yummy. The cost for the two of was almost  200. It s an interesting place the food hit or miss.
ATX Cocina,245,I am an Eagles fan so of course I had to come to a restaurant owned by Nick Foles.  As fate would have it  right after he was MVP of the Super Bowl  I was passing through Austin.     The review says 4 but its really a 4.5    The food is delicious but as typical of many trendy places you get small dishes for big bucks.    The chefs are very nice and engage you if you re sitting at the chef bar.   Place was quite crowded on the weekend with over a two hour wait.  I guess thats the price of being a hip spot.     Its a little too  trendy  for me but I am sure the regulars love it. I am a big craft beer drinker and was pleased with the selection.   I had the Tostadas with Lobster.  They were delicious  but a little small for the price.  My friend wouldnt stop raving about the Brussel Sprouts.   I tried a couple and he was right  they were insanely good.  Who knew the vegetable we hated as kids could be so awesome.    Definitely a place worth checking out once.
ATX Cocina,246,I live in your fricking building. But I don t go very often because you just wear me out. It starts at the front desk. Your pretty little things are so damn arrogant and self absorbed they make me want to puke. Tonight she spent 10 minutes telling us all the places we COULDNT sit. We came for Happy Hour. So NO  we did not have a reservation. Finally she said you can sit outside but you ll have to be done and gone because we have a reservation. For that table. That exact damn table. At 6 30. Seriously    Guys your food ain t that good to put up with the attitude and all the bullshit. And you don t need to explain every twisted ingredient in the dish.   Maybe your chef likes that idea  but it s BORING.   If you want to see what great service  great food  great ambiance looks like...stop in at Comedor. That s where I ll be.   A little further walk than ATX but worth it.
ATX Cocina,247,I didn t even want to give this one star but I will because the guacamole was solid. Went for happy hour   had the rudest bartender I think I ve ever encountered in my life. PLUS the margaritas are not even made fresh    Decided to voice my unpleasant experience to the manager  who was just as I accommodating and unfriendly. Front desk lady was also incredibly dismissive. I wouldn t come back here if you paid me
ATX Cocina,248,I really advise looking at the menu ahead of going  I guess I wasn t ready to not know anything on the menu and ended up getting tacos off the happy hour which ended up being really good  the margs were alright too but nothing that special. good food  a little too pricey and random of meals for me but not bad.
ATX Cocina,249,They are the worst owners managers  of a restaurant we have ever seen and we are from the Dallas Fort Worth area where restaurants are good   Absolutely embarrassing for them and we were actually going back for a third time this week . Our waiter last night was half ass. However  he seemed to have personal problems and we excused that.  We were five minutes late showing up tonight and they were completely rude to us and refused our service. Are you kidding me   They flipped us off as we walked out.  Wow   So not professional.  Don t support the assholes that manage and own this place.  Not professional Whatsoever    They didn t even care what money we had already spent this week.  Terrible    Please don t support  
ATX Cocina,250,Touchdown   Every dish we had there made us roll our eyes back and scream  YES    luckily for other diners  we did it inside our heads  .  Was in the Austin area looking for some good Mexican food. Yelped a down home downtown taqueria but it was closed. Came across ATX Cocina and saw that it was highly rated. Sure it looked  and turned out to be  very chi-chi and was about about 4 times more expensive than where we d planned on going but ya know it s amazing that as your hunger gets bigger and bigger your economic planning skills get smaller and smaller. So we stopped in for what happily turned out to be one of the most delicious meals we ve had in a long time.  Started with an amazing Margarita made with 2 complementary tequilas  N.B. not  complimentary tequilas     2 different kinds of lime juice and the perfect amount of agave. Not too sweet. Not too sour. Expertly mixed and just right.  Next was one of the best guacamoles either of us has ever had. Who knew you could put something as unusual as a touch of tarragon in the most traditional looking dish  serve it up with wonderful house-made and generously seeded mega corn  chips  and produce a spectacular version of an avocado that s been elevated to heavenly status.  The beet pibil and lump crab tostada that served as introductions to our shared main course simply rocked our socks off. Both were so fresh and bright. And while layered with some complexity  the presentations honored the individual ingredients and weren t overblown. But the hit of the night were the patos locos tacos. Hands down the best duck tacos we ve ever had  anywhere  anytime.  So you folks are lucky. You live in Austin and can visit whenever you want. Us  We can t wait to get back this spring to indulge ourselves again.   So sign me  David  me muero por verte  M.  P.S. Why start out the review with  Touchdown   .  Cause the place is owned by Nick Foles  dad and talk about scorin  bigtime 
ATX Cocina,251,After the  30 minute wait  turned into an hour  the drinks were nice and cold  just wish it wasn t the same for the food.  40 salmon came out lukewarm  even after sending back to the kitchen. Crab tostada was completely cold. Didn t realize I was ordering ceviche.  Would not recommend - if you want better food and service  go to Torchy s right around the corner.
ATX Cocina,252,Very expensive. Completely worth it.   If you would ve told me my most expensive meal of 2017  and probably of 2018  would be Mexican food  I would have laughed. But here we are  a mortgage payment later  and you know what  I regret nothing.  ATX Cocina is bright and airy  with a towering  vaulted ceiling made of light  beautiful wood. It frames one of two bars  behind which some excellent bar staff ply their trade. We arrived during prime time  just before 8pm on a Friday  and the place was jumpin. I couldn t help but notice the patrons were...older. Likely because that s the only demographic that can actually afford to get here. I suspect we were the only folks under 40 there.  Please please please don t let that dissuade you though  the food  the drinks  the service are all superlative. We started with drinks   sampling the several of the mezcal cocktails. If you love mezcal  this place is your jam  as their collection is extensive. The details get a bit fuzzy  but I remember the group consensus was that the very first cocktail on the menu was our favorite.  Given our reservation  we were seated quickly  getting whisked away from the bar with barely enough time to finish our first drink. We dove immediately into the appetizers  oxtail quesadillas  guacamole and queso fundido. The guacamole was exceptional  it might be the best I ve ever had. The queso was great  not mind blowing  but I would absolutely order the oxtail quesadillas again. If there s one complaint I had the entire night  it s that the chips were much too thin to stand up to the guac and kept breaking. I ended up eating it with a spoon  like a heathen.    Flash forward several rounds of drinks later and we were onto the main courses. I had the chili roasted chicken  while the wife had the pork chicarron and was raving about it from the very first bite. I mistakenly thought the white mole would be a chocolate based sauce  but I ordered it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to find it typically uses peanuts and almonds as a base. It complimented the chicken wonderfully   I ll admit  our bill was sky-high owing mostly to excessive drinking  I m sure you can eat here reasonably and do your drinking elsewhere  but if you re a mezcal fiend  it might prove difficult to resist.
ATX Cocina,253,First timer but certainly not the last.  Started out with raw oysters and graduated to an amazing lamb dish.  Service was great  The vibe was fun and the food on point.  The next time I m in town I will certainly return.
ATX Cocina,254,We were hooked on ATX Cocina while visiting this past weekend  Their patio was open for happy hour which we enjoyed two days in a row. The guacamole and chips were especially delicious  We came back again  yes a third time  for dinner inside and had a wonderful time. There was a significant wait due to their limited seating and a storm that forced everyone outside on the patio inside. The staff handled the situation really well and were very accommodating to their waiting guests. They took our food orders ahead of time and even served drinks. They also enforced wearing masks while we waited    Our server named Summer was a delight as was the rest of the staff. We felt very taken care of  safe  and were well fed during each of our visits 
ATX Cocina,255,We got the chef s table for a birthday dinner which came with a preset menu--made everything easy and delicious  Drinks were flowing and service was great. We got the chips  guac  salsa  Caesar salad  I normally don t like carrots or corn tortillas but loved them here. Would come back to try   la carte.
ATX Cocina,256,The space itself is absolutely beautiful  I couldn t stop looking at the incredible ceilings and the lovely bar turning out some fantastic margaritas as well as an enormous tiki inspired punch bow drink served in a halve watermelon  Good selection of mezcal as well.  The service was great  friendly bar service while we waited to be seated and our server was also attentive and had a lot of great suggestions for first timers at the restaurant.  The fundido was an excellent appetizer as was the hamachi crudo  very light  fresh and acidic to balance out the queso  After that our group shared a variety of tacos  all were great. Our server also informed us that their menu is 100  Gluten free. Which is great for your annoying friends that won t stop talking about their gluten allergy...   Overall this is a great space turning out some delicious upscale Mexican fare and great drinks. Located downtown  it can be a bit annoying to find parking. Best to Uber. Will definitely be coming back.
ATX Cocina,257,Eat the cheese   Fundido forever.  We had three orders for four people.  Eat more cheese.   Oh and brussel sprouts.  You must have two orders of brussel sprouts for every fundido. The way they complement each other is ridiculous.   And whatever you do. Mix and match. I got the brosino and I put the fundido on top.  Added some brussel sprouts and BOOM.  I ate like the true King that I am.   Eat here.  Order fundido. And brussel sprouts. And be happy 
ATX Cocina,258,Their new menu is overpriced and mediocre. Drinks are still good  expensive but that s what ya get downtown. No more tacos on the menu. It s turned into a classic try hard Austin restaurant. I miss the old ATX cocina.
ATX Cocina,259,My girlfriends and are I flew in to Austin for my 60th birthday and we had made reservations for 4 people at 7 30 which when we arrived were not available. They wouldn t make it right no matter what we said. We walked 3 blocks to a restaurant called Fixe that heard our story and got us in right away. We are grateful for them and will NEVER recommend ATX to anyone. They treated us as if they didn t care about our business  very poor customer service  so disappointed
ATX Cocina,260,This may be the WORST experience of customer service I have ever had. From reservation issues to kindness and prompt help  this place was horrific. If you are promised a table  do not believe them. They blamed a TWO top on me when we clearly had FOUR people...then tried to act like they were doing us a favor by getting us in an hour and a half later. The male host was a complete jerk and the female manager was condescending and unhelpful. Never again.
ATX Cocina,261,LOVED this place. I went while on a business trip  and this was the best place we ate by far. Despite having to wait 20 minutes past our reservation time for our table  I still give this place 5 stars because the food and service were both amazing.  I sampled the esquites  hamachi  and a fish dish. All were so delicious and flavorful  but light too. There were many other things I wanted to try  and I d to come back again and again with out of town guests if I lived in Austin 
ATX Cocina,262,I had the guacamole   Hands down the best guacamole since sliced bread in austin   Also the margaritas here will knock your socks off.  Other than that it s a busy restaurant lots of people think New York dining jam packed with good food lots of hippidy people . Overall fine dinning establishment. They have valet
ATX Cocina,263,Love this place so much. Sopecitos is my fave thing to get Can y all please open for brunch 
ATX Cocina,264,Love the interiors of this restaurant. Great drinks and the guacamole and short rib was delightful  Their homemade corn tortillas were some of the best I ve ever had. Unique drinks  The tortilla chips are so good and unlike anything else I ve ever had. Highly recommend 
ATX Cocina,265,The worst service. Food is good but about the worst experience I ve had at a restaurant in a long time. Waitstaff are not interested in delivering a high level of service. Bartenders and hostess were great. Recommend going somewhere else next time you re dining out in Austin.
ATX Cocina,266,Atmosphere was okay outside  inside much better. Food was good but not outstanding. Drinks are what you d expect.
ATX Cocina,267,Damn.   Other than the food  the ambiance  the location  the bar  the physical space  and the service  there s no good reason to come here. An out of town visitor  this place was recommended ... and for good reason. Well done  all y all.   Everything was tasty  queso fundido was awesome the lamb shank was delightful  and my buddy s grilled prawns all killed it. I m not sure how the rest of it all is  but I d guess awesome  as well.
ATX Cocina,268,What a reopening  super smooth and just as vibrant as ever. Smaller menu for now  appetisers  tacos enchiladas and 5 mains  and must order out front despite mostly normal table service. Guac and tomatillo salsa were beautiful  blue corn quesadilla was the best I ve ever had  campechana was generous with the octopus and citrus  also served w chips   fish tacos were unreal-flaky and crispy and sublime w a squeeze of lime  short rib on elote was 10 10. Such thoughtful dishes - quality ingredients while staying true to native Mexican flavours. Great service throughout. And order ice cream   The Abuelita pecan was to die for
ATX Cocina,269,This restaurant is 5 stars all the way  From the food to the servers and staff  We love this place.  My husband and I came here for his 30th birthday because it s his favorite.  We ordered the Supe  Quesadilla  Brussels  Plato s Tacos and the Carne Guisada.  Food was amazing 
ATX Cocina,270,Andres  More like an An-gel. ATX Cocina s best employee fasho. Thank you for your service.  essentialemployeeandfriend
ATX Cocina,271,I came in tonight for dinner and everything was amazing. My dishes two favorite dishes of ghe night where the short rib and brussel sprouts.   Even though Bridget was not are starring server she took over and did an amazing job. She was friendly  out going  and very personable. If you eat there I would highly recommend her as youe server.
ATX Cocina,272,The decore is gorgeous  however  serene  and modern...  Brandon was a dream of a waiter....  Gluten Free Kitchen         Not that you would ever ever know it- but it is   But... the food is truly amazing the absolute best I have had in Austin for a long time   Light Caesar salad with delicious cheese crisps  oxtail quesadilla wirh homemade tortillas  swordfish wirh microgreens and salsa verde  chicken mole with an out of this world pur ed but sauce  three out of this world salsas with the tortillas  a corn pudding soup with blue corn cinnamon sugar crisps  and a decadent chocolate  flan  with a cream sauce I wish I could buy in bulk   Do not pass up the opportunity to eat here- fresh  unique  and every bite utterly delicious combined with gracious service makes for an amazing experience 
ATX Cocina,273,Wow. Everything we had was unique and delicious. Super creative  fresh  non-GMO ingredients. We had the sopes which may have been the best we had ever had. The esquites was definitely great and traditional. The El Jefe was excellent. I little undercooked for the firm medium we asked for but the rub and spices were very good. The duck confit tacos were wonderful. The queso fundido WAS the best we ve ever had. The Chile Roasted chicken in white mole was great. First time I ve ever had white mole. The Caesar salad was very good with toasted parmesan cheese.
ATX Cocina,274,Maybe the best restaurant in Austin...  This place is beautiful    I love the build out  the feel  the location    This is real Mexican  read  Do NOT come here for TexMex     The food is oh so fresh  beautiful  thoughtful and that hamachi crudo is a total masterpiece   Also  had the crab tostada  butter corn  mixed lettuce ceasar  and barbacoa short rib  which was very rich  I recommend sharing .    Everything was on pointe   The staff is attentive and professional.  The bar is gorgeous.  The drinks were perfection.  If you re not cheap  eat here  
ATX Cocina,275,An amazing restaurant with awesome elevated and modern Mexican food. It s one of those places where you can go for a date with your wife and get back home after having a nice hearty meal along with a great time. The food portions are perfect and it tastes absolutely delicious. The service at the restaurant is super friendly and ambience is very lively. A must-go for any date night 
ATX Cocina,276,Unfortunately was overly stuffed with bbq when trying this place but the ambiance is perfect. Drinks were perfectly made  amp  the queso fundido was the best I ve had. PERFECT balance and not too greasy. Wish I had more room to try the Carne Asada. Until next time
ATX Cocina,277,It s interesting to read the reviews. There s a few negative reviews and as you read them  and hopefully ownership is   there is a common theme in the complaints...  The food is exceptional. Well done  packed with flavor  always fresh etc. So to the chefs and ownership for coming up with and consistently putting out the goods - 5 Stars  If it wasn t for our several trips to this restaurant and consistently getting excellent food  I would ve gone lower with the star rating.  SO    What s the common theme in the negative reviews  You ll see it after reading 4 or 5 of the lower starred ones. The customer service     Whomever is doing the hiring needs to be fired themselves. Your staff  from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter we had  just suck  it almost seems like you have to have a stick up your ahem  to work there. Wow  just wow. Kids remember  you re there to serve your customers. Where do you get off thinking we are so lucky to have the opportunity to support your business  You re wrong  And it s because of your snobby better than thou attitude that no matter how amazing your chef and food is  I will push myself and those in my circle to not return.   As an employee you need to think about the hand that feeds you. I understand it matters not to you whether Larry and Guy make an extra penny or not  but they know how expensive the rent is for such a prime location. They can t afford to consistently lose customers  not because of the culinary excellence but because of your prude  rude  stuck up attitude.  So bite your little tongue  count to ten  and smile regardless of your attitude problem  otherwise find another industry because this ones not for you.  Ownership  call in the Bob s and clean this place up quickly before you regret it  Hopefully this is the road flare you need before it s too late because in this business  I m certain you know  you don t get many bites at the apple. Do some secret shopping  study up. While the food is incredible you got some rotten grapes throughout 
ATX Cocina,278,We love ATX Cocina. We went for the first time in December 2017 for our 1st anniversary and it was delightful. We had delicious food  too notch service and even got a card signed by the whole staff. We went back a number of months later when family visited and again had a great meal. Definitely recommend reservations  Tonight I met my husband on a Friday evening for happy hour. HH is only in the bar lounge or patio but it s too hot to be outside. He arrived just before 5pm and got a table but it was 100  full when I arrived just after 5pm--bar and lounge tables. The happy hour menu is very affordable with a bunch of options. We left more than full and have awesome service. Everything we ate and drank was perfection. We especially like the empanadas which had beans and cheese. Absolutely we will be back   
ATX Cocina,279,Wow. The food and service here were top notch.  Started with guacamole which was the best I d ever tasted.  Small sliced jalape os on top gave it a nice kick.   And I don t know what those chips were but they were fantastic.  Short rib was one of my favorite meals of all time.   I m not a huge margarita guy but the Spicy margarita was great.    Service was top notch too   All around great experience.  I ll be back next time I m in Austin.
ATX Cocina,280,All the food is GF and it s Outstanding     Service was top notch too   This place is definitely worth a visit 
ATX Cocina,281,Andres  six letters  two syllables  number one in my heart. Give this man a bonus AND a raise.
ATX Cocina,282,First time in Austin and my friends and I made a reservation.  We were very excited to eat here from past reviews and word of mouth.  Upon arrival  we were walked through the restaurant to the back patio.  It was extremely hot outside and we asked if we could be seated inside.  We were informed that our reservation was for outside   we were unaware of this  and could not find anything on our reservation that supported this.  The chairs outside were also very uncomfortable  Iron chairs with large slots in the seat .  For any woman wearing a shorter dress  it does not work well and I needed to request a large amount of napkins to sit on.    Have to say the food was really amazing though  Love the warm corn tortillas that came with the salsa sampler.  We could not stop eating them  Everything we had was delicious  but outdoor seating in Austin needs to be made a more comfortable experience.
ATX Cocina,283,Every dish and appetizer exceeded expectation. Plan to share plates family style to enjoy a bite of everything  Octopus  pic attached  and short ribs were especially memorable. House margarita was not too sweet...as I like it 
ATX Cocina,284,Owner is completely disrespectful. Came over to our table shaming us for not wanting to wear a mask instead of coming at us in a mature manner with understanding that not all of us believe a piece of cloth with protect us from a virus that is only 32nm in diameter.
ATX Cocina,285,Great food and the bartenders are on point. The atmosphere is clean and a live with tons of energy. I would highly recommend this place for a fabulous night out for Mexican.
ATX Cocina,286,Went for dinner with my colleagues and really enjoyed this new spot. The decor is light wood and clean lines and still very warm and comfortable. We ate just near the kitchen  which is open and adds to the environment. It can get a bit crowded trying to navigate your way out or to the restroom  but it s a good sign that people are going.   Overall the food is fresh and delicious. Smaller servings and perfect for sharing among the table. The guacamole comes with only a few  chips  but they re very crunchy and it s quite good. The salsa tasting also comes with just a few tortillas so I recommend cutting them up and asking for more right away  unless you want to add it to your entrees. When you get to the entrees  they are all solid  we had the chicken  lamb and giant shrimp . The side of brusselsprouts are a MUST  We ended up with three orders since we couldn t get enough.   I don t remember the name  but the fudge like dessert served with ice cream was too rich to enjoy more than two small bites. We didn t end up finishing those. Opt for the corn meal churros instead - really good    The drinks are also great. I really enjoyed the Fistful of Dynamite. At the end of the day it s a jalape o margarita. But a bit more refined.   Service was attentive. We had two assigned to our table. Had to flag them down a few times but I d expect that with a big group like ours.
ATX Cocina,287,I absolutely love this place. There s nothing not worth it on the menu  You ll be very pleased with food and drinks 
ATX Cocina,288,ATX Cocina has a busy and energetic atmosphere. The place is loud. We showed up later on a Friday night and waited about 25 minutes for a table  as we did not have a reservation. Service was on point.  Food is Meh...They are trying to deliver an upscale Mexican experience  but it just seems they are trying to hard. I would recommend regular chips and salsa  rather than the Salsa taster  and corn tortillas.. the tortillas are not for dipping and it does not seem to make sense. The Salsas were tasty however. We also had the Queso Fundido and this again was just OK  it could have had more caramelization in my opinion. it seemed under cooked. We also sampled the Brussels sprouts which were dry and not very interesting.  Drinks were stout  and we enjoyed them.. but overall  its just OK  especially considering the  .
ATX Cocina,289,I moved to Austin 2 months ago  and the dinner I had at ATX Cocina was the best meal I ve had so far.  Try the salmon  it was the best salmon I have ever had.  Also  Clayton was an absolute pleasure of a server for us. I will definitely be coming back here  and requesting that he be my server again.
ATX Cocina,290,I ve been here twice now and it didn t disappoint. The food is different than your typical Mexican restaurant  not Tex Mex . Lots of different flavors and unique combinations. I m a fan of the duck carnitas tacos  queso flameado  burrata  corn  and borracho snapper. The carne asada is also a top pick. Their tequila and mezcal menu gets three thumbs up and I tried one of their margaritas the last time I was there and it was damn good. The atmosphere is nice and I m glad they have  8 valet because the parking situation is my only complaint. The garage around the corner can get pricey   20 . It s a bit pricey but definitely worth it.
ATX Cocina,291,We LOVED ATX  We were lucky to get in at the bar  because this place is jumping for dinner. We let our super friendly waiter choose his favorites for us and the whole meal was amazing  We had the guacamole and sope  my favorite thing of the whole meal  for starters  the hamachi  2nd favorite  and cangrejo next  the short rib and rib eye for entree  and the sorbet and chocolate cake for dessert. This was perfect for fourGreat service  amazing food-we will be back 
ATX Cocina,292,One of my new favorite places ever with the best of everything. Drinks and food are phenomenal and the vibe is gorg.
ATX Cocina,293,I m going to start off by giving my review disclaimer. I review on category levels. Fast food  sit down  fine dining  etc. This review will reflect that.  With that out of the way  I wasn t super impressed by this restaurant. Those at my table raved a bit about one or two items  and overall it was a decent experience  but for the price  no   35  entr es . The place was quite hoppin   which really meant  it had a general crowd level of volume  and with the open modern design  made conversations difficult.  The Ceviche was alright  the tuna was bettet in my opinion. The ceaser salad was quite excellent  but  was drenched in dressing.   The order was slow  the entrees didn t arrive at the same time  the servers spilled water on the refills  a food sensitivity was missed on a dish  it was corrected  but it was missed  I blame the sound levels .   I ordered a  dos   lamb dish. There wasn t enough of it  unfortunately. I figured  dos  meant there would be enough food... The lamb came in pieces. Maybe that s a more modern way to serve it  I suspect it is so the rare lamb won t drip blood. Anyhow  my knife was dull  but fortunately I still had a knife from one of the apetizers.    The food really was decent  the apetizers were really the shining item on the menu. Especially the empanadas. But when the first thing you get is the high point.   The desserts were good. The flan wasnt anything special. I didnt there was a chocolate desert and a pumpkin  pistachios  Desert. The chocolate was the clear winner at the table. The flan the loser. I liked the green one with strawberry sauce. It was pretty tasty. The chocolate was good  but I ve made better myself. It was what the others at the table raved about though.   The men s restroom was small. It bothered me  so I m adding that. It didn t affect the review  but wanted to mention it.   In summary  if I ordered from the menu again.. I d get the tuna  the empanadas  maybe the caeser salad  and the pumpkin strawberry desert.
ATX Cocina,294,Love this place   Great food and ambiance Margaritas   the fish  guacamole are amongst the one I recommend it.
ATX Cocina,295,What we ordered   For the kids  Empanadas  Smoked refried beans  queso mixto and took out the guajillo salsa so it was kids non-spicy friendly   11.00  These look like rocks  they are not your traditional fried empanadas. They are more like a wrap burrito in the shape of balls. So it is appealing for kids     Lengua Quesadilla   the Jalape os come on the side  This is served in 3 tortillas with cow tongue served on top of marinated cabbage and Huancaina Sauce  Most common ingredients  Mild pepper  olive oil  garlic  queso fresco or ricotta cheese  heavy cream . The cheese was queso mixto.   Esquite  Sweet butter poached corn  queso fresco  lime and cilantro  Asked for the aioli to be on the side .  Adults ordered   Tacos arabes  Lamb  recado rojo  rajas  and garbanzo Puree  basically hummus . The tortillas are served on the side and were super soft and tasted amazing    18.00   I added the marinated cabbage from the lengua quesadillas to this dish and it was a great compliment. This dish was on the smaller side-but its a great one.  Lamb al Carbon  Lamb porterhouse  charro beans and lemon yogurt.  Chef recommends  to do medium rare  This is a large dish. You will not be disappointed . Amazing flavors all around.  38.00  Carne Asada  Citrus Marinated Rib roll  Peanut Macha  verde rojo  and queso frito. This is also a large dish and flavors are on point. Amazing choice.  38.00  This was a perfect Texan twist to regular Mexican  cuisine  modern  classy and tasty. I would definitely  come back 
ATX Cocina,296,Delicious drink menu. Very creative and splendid. Friday afternoons are very busy as it s a very popular location.  You must try the Lorenzo or Garcia.  Main dishes are interior Mexican cuisine. Delicious and well prepared.  I would give this restaurant 5 stars but prices are extremely high. Otherwise a great restaurant and bar. Can t wait for weather to warm up to enjoy the outdoor area.
ATX Cocina,297,ATX Cocina is upscale Mexican greatness  So hard to find good ethnic and ethnic-inspired cuisine in Austin but this place is batting 1000. Food is delicious and the drinks are well balanced. Staff are courteous and knowledgeable. Happy hour is where it s at for like half off drinks  amp  apps. Definitely coming back 
ATX Cocina,298,Living in California  I can eat Mexican food seven days a week.  When a local suggested this upscale restaurant  it certainly did not disappoint.   All of it was delicious but start with the Queso dip.  Amazing flavors.  You won t regret it.
ATX Cocina,299,All the food that I have tried here has been outstanding and very fresh  short ribs  tuna  hamachi  branzino and the Caesar salad. OMG  one of the best Caesar salads I have ever eaten. The dressing has the perfect kick of anchovy and lemon. I could eat it everyday  The service is very professional and pretty great  however  there can be an unevenness to it  timing of courses  a bit slow on drink refills   not enough to discourage a visit but a bit of improvement in this area wouldn t be amiss. Bottom line  go here  try as many things as possible and share 
ATX Cocina,300,Sat outside.   They have expanded the patio.  Menu has changed since I was here last.  Still love the Caesar salad here.  Short rib. All delicious.  A perfect margarita.  This neighborhood fave doesn t disappoint.
ATX Cocina,301,I usually can t stand gluten free  and this place changed all my minds on that. My hungry mind  my craving mind  my healthy mind.   All the food was so delicious. I m so excited to eat here  and not feel guilty about any of it  again tonight.     LOVE  Sopas Barracho Snapper  SO DELICIOUS  Queso Fundido  skillet queso  OMG one of the best I ve had in Austin.  I only ate those three and I loved each of them
ATX Cocina,302,Fantastic spot  The food was delicious  amp  they were very accommodating with food allergies substitutions. For main dishes we got the salmon and campechana with the charred broccolini and brussel sprouts on the side. Every plate was delicious - you cannot go wrong. The ATX margarita was really good  it is the house margarita with an extra floater on top. We sat outside and loved the vibe atmosphere of the restaurant. Definitely plan on going back 
ATX Cocina,303,I ate at ATX Cocina last week for a business lunch and myself  my colleagues and my client had an amazing experience. Logan  our waiter  provided amazing service  the food was great and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant was fun and inviting. Definitely will be back for other work events and with my family.   Thanks for a very enjoyable experience.
ATX Cocina,304,Good food  drinks and apps. Pretty setting and we were put in a confined little area so we could hear our entire party. I ordered the skirt steak with fried cheese and the steak was way too raw  and I eat my stuff red   I had to send it back which was no problem. I m on the keto diet and they had a lot of options for me. I ll be back when I m in town again 
ATX Cocina,305,As a restaurant  serving quality  tasty food is a must and ATX Cocina serves up some awesome dishes...  But when it comes to SERVICE  this place flat out sucks.  Waiting an hour for a table you had a reservation for is insulting of my time and energy. It s your job  it s called hospitality and you re failing.  Figure. It. Out
ATX Cocina,306,I had a reservation made weeks in advance for a Saturday night.  I got a call at 2pm the day of the reservation telling me I was booked outside and due to rain they were closing their patio and therefore canceling my reservation.  There was no information on open table or on their site saying this could happen.  They gave a weak apology and now we are scrambling to find another reservation.  Very unprofessional.
ATX Cocina,307,Just a great all around meal.  Even at 9pm on a Friday night the place was crowded and happening.  We got a seat pretty easily at the bar though and went off on our meal journey.  Salsa tasting a must with the tortilla as dipping instruments which is a nice upgrade among traditional crunchy tortilla chips.  Hot sauce has good kick and the bean varieties smoky and nice.  We had the falafel taco appetizer to share and then chicken  duck tacos  and corn for entree dinner.  Falafel taco was exceptional.  Again the fresh corn tortilla and a full piece of hummus in a unique hibiscus sauce.  This was a great opener and really introduces you to the ingenuity of the Mexican fusion of all menu items.  The corn was cooked great and peeled off the cob exceptionally  but in the end pretty basic side dish with not much cheese or other seasoning.  The duck tacos were just a great roasted duck  presented well and filling. Again more corn tortilla and just a good dish for about  30 that s well worth it.  The chicken was almost a bbq roasted and quite large  especially after all the appetizers.  Would order again for sure everything on the menu.  Drinks were priced around 12 for wine and  14 for cocktails.  Beer list pretty small but they have IPA on draft and about 6 on draft in total.   Really enjoyed my meal at ATX Cocina.  Get a reservation and come here for their daily Happy Hour to get some salsa and margarita  or come for a fun dinner out with a big group.   Either way  this place is high on my Austin list so far.
ATX Cocina,308,Amazingly great food- fabulous mixed drinks and fun environment in this new restaurant  Beautiful upscale decor  friendly and exceptionally well trained staff.  Thrilled this new gem of a restaurant has valet parking. The trout  beef short ribs  grilled shrimp and Caesar  salad are spectacular in the style of their modern Mexican cuisine. RUN TO ATX Cocina but make reservations. It s a hot spot not to be missed    
ATX Cocina,309,Excellent Happy Hour  We ve been here twice for happy hour before a show  and even though the HH menu is small  every item we ve had has been really delicious. They re appetizer small plate sized  but two per person has been perfect for each of us.  We ve had table service and bar service and the staff has been great in both settings. The ambiance is pleasant and the noise level is just right so you can actually hear each other talking.
ATX Cocina,310,This is about as 4-stars as it gets. It s a great place for a bite downtown if you don t mind the crowd    I dined here with 3 of my friends on a busy Friday night. We were able to snag a last-minute reservation at 7 30PM which I consider a mandatory step in order to eat here during prime hours. The place was packed from wall to wall and it s pretty impressive that the waiters were able to slide through the bushels of hungry diners waiting for their table.   We were seated after a 15-minute wait past our reservation time. This was fine  because you can t control when your table will be clear. We were able to grab a drink at the bar  so the wait seemed easy.   Our food was great  but the reviews are right - the crab app was the best  By the time we reached our main course  the lamb and the ribs  we were stuffed. It s a great place to family style    If you want to dine amongst the most beautiful people in Austin  eat some solid food  for a price   and feel satified when you leave  ATX Cocina is for you 
ATX Cocina,311,I have ordered to go probably 20 times in the last year. All orders  particularly the short rib  were close to a 5 for quality. The only reason this overall rating is 4 is because of a recent change to the short rib prep. It s now billed as an order for two with an almost doubling in price. Unfortunately the new short rib is only an order for two if your partner enjoys sharing 75 percent fat. This version    with tortillas and a spicy salad  doesn t come close to the prior short rib version that was tastier and meatier and likely could have served two. The sides   carrots  broccoli  sprouts and corn fritas  are all still outstanding but it would be nice if they brought back the even better corn and potato sides.
ATX Cocina,312,The food and ambiance at this spot are awesome  This place is beautifully decorated and the food and drinks are delicious. This is a great place to see and be seen on a date night  girls nights  or just a fun evening out. We loved the barbacoa and the empanadas the most. Would have awarded 5 stars based on food and ambiance  but knocked it down to 3 based on the issue explained below.  Our group of 4 went here for happy hour on a Friday night. The dinner menu we were provided clearly states that happy hour runs until 6 30 and that during happy hour you get  3 off each cocktail  beer  or wine ordered.  During happy hour our group of 4 ordered 2 rounds of drinks. All the drinks were great. We ordered other drinks as the night went on. When we were brought our bill we noticed the  3 per drink discount  for the drinks ordered during happy hour  hadn t been reflected on the bill. We brought this to our waiter s attention and he told us this was because we weren t sitting in the bar and happy hour was only valid in the bar area. This isn t stated on the menu  and the happy hour promotion is advertised on the dinner menu we were given so we asked to speak to a manager. The manager essentially blew us off by telling us people get confused about this all the time but their website states the  3 promotion is valid only in the bar. We thought this was ridiculous  they handed us a menu with a promotion and then don t honor it because their website states the promotion isn t good  Then why have the promotion printed on the menu you hand customers     Our group of 4 spent  300 on dinner and we just wanted hen to honor what the menu stated and give us our  24 off  4 people   2 rounds    3.00 . They refused to honor it  so we left super annoyed.   The food and drinks were still great  but I think management needs to remove the incorrect wording from their menu and work on being more friendly to good paying customers like us.
ATX Cocina,313,While the food at ATX Cocina is well worth it  we found the service to warrant a poor review and will definitely make us think twice in returning to the restaurant. Our server was quite rude when we asked questions about the menu  even poking fun of some of the items we ordered. After our food arrived we never saw him again until I had to ask multiple servers and finally the host to find him  after 30 minutes of waiting for our check he finally arrived and acted incredibly annoyed that we would even want it. For the price point  I would recommend Suerte or pretty much any other restaurant in Austin  at  70 person the service should be MUCH better than what we received.    I sent a message directly to the restaurant in hopes they would try to apologize for our experience  they have not reached out.
ATX Cocina,314,I would give this place 4.5.  Ambience was way too loud.  Sat at the table next to the kitchen which was cool but the table width is not conducive to visiting with friends. Now on to the good   1. Pork tomahawk was amazing.  Get this 2. Duck carnitas were great 3.  Great sauces all around - be prepared for some heat on all the food  Service was great as well.  Would go back here to try more of the food.
ATX Cocina,315,So this is the second time we have been burned by these guys. Had a reservation tonight.  Arrived. They are closed for cleaning. I m sure this means this restaurant has a positive employee. Could you just do the right thing and cancel our reservation ahead of time before we drive down here  and why wouldn t you answer the phone   Lazy. Do not recommend
ATX Cocina,316,Laaaaame...food is okay to say the least.  My license was expired for less than a month. I have a busy schedule and haven t had the time to get it renewed. I had other form of identification but the waiter didn t care to see it. Got pulled over on the way to Austin and the cop didn t even care my license was expired. Gave me a ticket and went on about his day. Don t understand why the waiter felt the place would be shut down if he didn t get me a drink. I m 26 years old. Booooooo. My friend asked for mushrooms on the side and they were still in her entree. Anaphylactic shock ready to go. Roasted potatoes are as dry as can be.
ATX Cocina,317,This place deserves a great rating. They do it right. I loved their appetizers  I enjoyed sipping my drinks  and the flavor of everything was outstanding. Another nice thing is we showed up at a busy time with no reservation and they got us a seat anyways. Very cool vibe overall and I would love to come back.
ATX Cocina,318,Food was overpriced for what it is.  No one at the table enjoyed the food.  Service was ok but not great.  For a place at this price point you either need remarkable food or service but when both are subpar then why be there   Extremely loud when packed.  Couldn t hear each other talk. Valet parking is  10.  I doubt we will be back.
ATX Cocina,319,There are SO many hit and miss restaurants downtown. This upscale taco-bar puts it s money where your mouth is. Delicious creations like lamb  duck and pork in hot and steamy corn tortillas that keep coming until you say so.  The sides are just as exciting as the entrees.
ATX Cocina,320,First time in Austin  first meal in Austin..  Pros  Nice ambience Good guacamole  Good fresh soft tortillas  Solid chicken soft taco   5 for 2 on happy hour  Super tender short ribs with great flavor  Good service with knowledgeable friendly servers  Cons  No complimentary chips and salsa  gotta buy it    Sub par chips at best  was expecting much better Some of our food was overly spicy  needs balance  Middle of the road  Cocktails were ok  not great  need to be mixed better
ATX Cocina,321,If there is a restaurant to avoid in Austin  this would be the one  AVOID this place   An incredibly disappointing experience with rude and unprofessional staff  I have never been to a restaurant where 2 managers  Matt and a female  working on Friday 6 4 is unable to properly explain  admit and diffuse a situation. Why were they hired     to manage this place. Our entire table was appalled at their responses. They did not care and basically said   so what if your food still isn t here after 2 hours of waiting  When we asked the server  she was clueless and then said  I m sorry but I m not allowed to speak with the kitchen   rEALLY  then who is     when we asked why we had sat and ordered since 8pm and our food have not arrived and it was 10pm by the time someone even came by to ask how we were doing not even an appetizer has arrived. As managers if you see that the kitchen is running behind  maybe best to approached the group and let them know. Perhaps offer bread  or chips so your patrons aren t starving. We looked at every other table that did get their food and have left the restaurant even though they came in after us. Such as terrible experience  most of all the customer service was incredibly aggravating  sub par and just felt like they were being racist against us. I had to let the hotel know to never send anyone else there.  these managers and staff should be fired.
ATX Cocina,322,This place has a very comfortable atmosphere and good food. The service is also quite good.  I have to give this place 3 stars  however  for a few reasons. The restaurant doesn t serve rice - I asked for a side of rice and was very disappointed that the server told me they didn t have any. Regardless of the haute cuisine it serves  rice is a Mexican staple. It also was disappointing to see  huancaina sauce  not identified as Peruvian. I presume most non Latin Americans would think huancaina is Mexican. It s not  it s Peruvian  the word itself has Quechua origin . Please indicate as such.
ATX Cocina,323,Food is great but they are soooo snobby about their food. We waited so long to get the food and when it finally got there  the waiter described each dish for so long I almost just started eating while he was talking. I know that s the point of this place so I proceeded with caution. The drinks are great but the bar is impossible to get to when you want more drinks. Super crowded and very slow service. Everything is gluten free which is a plus  but I can t really say I ll come back here because I don t want my dinner to be a 3 hour experience   
ATX Cocina,324,I have mixed feelings about this place.  The ambiance and decor is beautiful at this restaurant.  I went in for Happy Hour and had a tamal as well as some tacos.  The food was very delicious and flavorful.  The service was lacking  though.  It took our server some time to get our drinks to us and the restaurant was closing for a private event so we felt rushed during our visit.  You might want to give this Happy Hour a try because the food was really good  but I don t think I will be back.
ATX Cocina,325,They don t normally do Sunday Brunch  and now I see why. My family and I came in for their special  Mother s Day Brunch  service and each of us ordered the Huevos Rancheros  a special that day . Each plate literally came out with just two eggs sunny side up and an extremely soupy ranchero sauce on top. That s it. Nothing else.... no tortilla  avocado  cheese. Nothing. I brought it up with our server and it sounds like the chef completely forgot how to construct the dish... he left out several items. But we d already started eating our eggs  so it was too late to really fix our meals.   The manager did us a solid and didn t charge us for our  eggs   thank goodness. Wouldn t have been ok getting charged their price points for such a lackluster meal. We just got charged for one appetizer  one glass of champagne  and one mimosa... which still came out to  49. I tipped the server  20 because they didn t make us pay for the other dishes... so still ended up spending close to  70 and left still starving.   It was super disappointing because this was supposed to be a special treat for my mom on Mother s Day. Probably won t be coming back anytime soon... but will say the server and manager were extremely nice when handling the issue. I really want this restaurant to succeed  but the kitchen s got some work to do before they should consider opening for a true brunch service in the future.
ATX Cocina,326,Prices are a bit pretentious. We ordered the whole branzino as our main which was  48. It wasn t like we ordered Chilean sea bass and to make matters worse  the fish was over cooked. We enjoyed the rest of our food  but not blown away enough to return for those prices.
ATX Cocina,327,HAPPY HOUR REVIEW   I ve been hearing a lot of things about this place and I ve been itching to try it out. We came here on HH because we heard that the prices were a little high for what you get. I was really impressed with their happy hour items. I wish there were  more options but what they did have was really delicious. Margaritas were on point and the food on the  happy hour was very tasty. We tried the Tamal  my favorite  it was a tamale but I m sure there was some sort of fish in it that made it taste sooooo goood  The carnitas tacos were also very tender and filling. The margaritas were really strong and satisfying. I was very impressed with everything that I tried and I can t wait to come back and try some more items on their menu. I give it a  thumbs up  
ATX Cocina,328,We love ATX  but just found out we can not bring our own bottles of wine to a B-Day Celebration. They do not have a corkage fee or allow you to bring a preferred bottle of wine. What kind of a  backwards thinking is that. In many years of dining out at some of the best  amp  a few of the worst restaurants in the world we have never heard of such nonsense. We would have never booked the reservation if we had known this. Live and learn I suppose. Sometimes we forget this is Austin TX. At least their margaritas are good.
ATX Cocina,329,Love my visit to ATX   First off  the atmosphere was amazing. Very well decorated. Hip and trendy    To start  we had their salsa trio. While I am sure most op for the queso fundido  do not overlook the salsa app  It had refrained beans  delicious salsa verde  a nut salsa mixture  and something for all your daring spicy fancy  It was not at all heavy and the corn tortilla were a perfect combo.   For dinner I paired a few small plates. Both the sope and crab tostada. For being an app  don t let the sope confuse you  It was a huge serving  def worth splitting. The tostada was delicious   Served cold but still full of flavor.   To drink I had the Paloma. Would suggest trying something else. Very sweet  I couldn t finish it. I should have asked for better recommendations here  Other than that I loved every minute of our meal and would return the second I get back to Austin 
ATX Cocina,330,Service was good  and the Cesar and gauc were excellent. Drinks were overpriced for what they were. I had the desert rose and it tasted like a plant.  Other than that  the restaurant is incredibly loud so it s not ideal for groups or a date. Entrees weren t enough food for the price.
ATX Cocina,331,All out amazing experience here  Food was soo good and the happy hour menu is great. You could definitely eat really good off of the happy hour menu with  5 bites and it would fill you up. Drink specials were great too  
ATX Cocina,332,I love it here   The staff is awesome. Erin is one of the best servers I have had ever had the pleasure of taking care of me. He notices the smallest little details which go a very long way  For me it s the little details that count. Summer is also wonderful she has a big energy and a fun vibe.  The food is outstanding   The salmon there is one of the best pieces of fish I ever had the pleasure of eating. The meat quality is superb as well. They are also incredibly accommodating so if you have any allergies or preferences they make it easy to make alterations. It s super fun place to hang out and be in. I am a big fan of tequila and the list they have is exceptional. It s a must try  Great experience from start to finish.
ATX Cocina,333,Buckle up. This is a long one.  Wowza  First five star Austin review in a loooooooooong time. This place isn t flawless  but it is pretty damn amazing. A bunch of our friends kept telling us how good ATX Cocina was  but we figured it was another one of those overhyped and overpriced restaurants that never ends up being worth the money. But we bit the bullet last night since we had a show to go to nearby. There are small nitpicks about everything  read below   but at the end of the day  we can t even believe how much we enjoyed ourselves.   We made a reservation over a week ago  but the hostess tried sitting us on the patio. UM NO  it s almost 100 degrees out  so we ended up being rerouted to the bar  which was full of loud and annoying  We Think We re In LA  people  but it was tolerable. The decor is nice  but you could see paint chipping off furniture  which isn t classy.   Since it was happy hour  we started with a paloma and some mezcal cocktail  both great --we always appreciate when a place has legitimate happy hour deals and items  Loro could really take note here      We ordered way too much food  and a lot of it got taken home. Breakdown  --Heirloom corn tortillas  amp  salsa tasting  Amazing. All the salsas were unique  delicious  and not too spicy. Loved that they all had different textures. The homemade corn tortillas were delicious  but we have to admit that we didn t love them as accoutrements and would have preferred the chipped version. --Sope  Probably our favorite dish of the night. Incredibly unique and bursting with flavors. --HH Chicken tinga tacos  Very good  but nothing super special when you re in a taco mecca city.  --Borracho snapper  Our least favorite dish. With all the heavy descriptors and rambling about ingredients  more on this later   there was no mention of orange slices anywhere  and there they were on the dish. We hate fruit with fish  and for  19  we were pretty pissed to find them there. --Mixed lettuce  caesar   Our new favorite salad in Austin  reminiscent of the glorious wedge salad that we had at Turkey and the Wolf in NOLA. Worth every penny of  14. --Verduras  These were good brussel sprouts.  12 good  No. Why is your side dish  12   --Pepita mousse with pomegranate sorbet dessert  Oh Austin  you re so cute with your semifreddo confusion again. Just because you make a mousse and serve it cold does not make it a semifreddo. Why is this so hard   It  was  delicious. Creamy  crunchy  cold  sweet  salty  perfect.  Our waitress was good  and was on top of it most of the night  our only complaint is that the dessert took forever to come out  which made no sense. Also  we didn t need her and the droppers to go over every single ingredient again EVERY time. Redundant. There was also a weird situation where a manager-type guy was climbing over seats opening all the windows behind us freaking out about rain coming for the people on the patio  rain which never came . It was just odd behavior.  Before we get completely lost in the weeds here  we want to emphasize how much we liked this place and how wonderful of a meal we had. A nice family ended up getting sat next to us  struck up a conversation  and we all had a pleasant time chatting before we headed out. Austin is cool that way.   4.5 stars  rounded up. We will definitely be back.
ATX Cocina,334,ATX was my favorite Austin spot pre Covid.  I ordered a couple of to-go orders during lockdown  and it was average at best.  I was recently at ATX the past Monday  10-5   and it was so horrible that I could not eat my food.  First off  we were seated on the patio in front of a large fan that was blowing hard.  I asked if the fan could be turned off because it was less than 70 degrees outside  and they told me no.  I could not believe that they refused to turn the fan off  so I got up to leave.  Another server came by and turned the fan off  so I stayed.  I ordered guacamole and shrimp campechana.  The guacamole did not seem fresh and seemed like it was made with paste.  The campechana was nothing like it was before.  The seafood was not fresh  and there was not very much seafood in there.  Also  there was some sort of brown sauce that was used that was not used before.  Campechana should taste citrusy  which this was not.  I took three bites  and could not eat it.  I also did not eat it for fear of getting sick.  The small amount of seafood in there seemed old.  My friend ordered the carne guisada.  The meat was not of good quality nor was it cooked properly.  It was tough and chewy.  Carne guisada should be tender.  They took the campechana off of the bill  but my friend paid for the guisada and guac.  I asked if there was a new chef  and they said no.  I m assuming they re cutting corners on the quality of food to turn a profit.  Needless to say  they just cut a client instead.  I left there starving and went elsewhere to eat.
ATX Cocina,335,FANTASTIC   Took my out of town guests last night and I can tell you it was pretty much perfect.  Food was AMAZING  our server Sarah was the BEST - had GREAT recommendations so friendly - Open Table messed up my reservation and the person that called to confirm was able to fix them even on a busy Saturday night.   Thank you for a great night we will be back
ATX Cocina,336,Great atmosphere and the food was INCREDIBLE.  Everyone loved what they ordered.  The bavette steak was very tender and cooked perfectly.  The short rib was fantastic and was plenty big enough for 2 people to share.  I highly recommend 
ATX Cocina,337,Honestly the best place I ve been to by far. I came here for a business trip and on our last day here a friend recommended this place to us. Erin  our bartender and host made some amazing recommendations and they were all delicious. I had the Peque o Lorenzo cocktail and was very smoky and fresh. We also ordered the empanadas  sopes and their guacamole. The salsas we topped them off with were very good and my favorite was the Salsa Matcha. Thank you Erin for your amazing hospitality and great recommendations as we enjoyed our 1st experience here thank you you.
ATX Cocina,338,Sooooo had high hopes for this place. Drinks are great  guac is amazinggggg. The salsa sampler tastes like bbq sauce. Recommend coming here for drinks and guac..head to your nearest Mexican food truck for the rest of your meal. Btw we mentioned that we didn t like the food to our sever and she just smiled and shrugged her shoulders..so much for customer service..
ATX Cocina,339,The place is beautifully designed  but the food does not warrant the price tag. My wife had the carne asada at  32 ... her words were   the meat is a regular cut of meat  nothing exceptional  and it definitely didn t seem like it was marinated.  She noted that the sauce they used on the plate was the same as in the chips dip appetizer.   I had the short rib. It was tender  and I liked it overall .. but at  34 there was definitely nothing I couldn t have had at 1 2 or 1 3 of the price just about anywhere in Austin.   To be clear .. I realize it s downtown  I realize it s a nice experience  and I realize it s new. But these are tourists-who-don t-know-better prices for food that was average to good. It s all good ATX-COCINA ... I m just hoping you ground yourself sooner than later.   p.s. just count on valet parking to be  8 because at that location .. there is literally no parking.
ATX Cocina,340,Ordered several different small plates and entrees... everything was truly amazing. Carne asada was awesome. Definitely will be going back.
ATX Cocina,341,The girls at the bar were unprofessional  Chatting  checking their phone  and annoyingly casual. Its just not what you want when your paying  40 a plate. Nice girls  just immature and shouldn t be working at this kind of establishment.   The only other complaint is with the oysters. Too much tomato and onion. It overpowered the flavor of the oyster itself.   Otherwise  food was excellent. Just overpriced for the quality of the staff.
ATX Cocina,342,We had been to ATX at least 4X  always with stellar food. Then in Nov we took a biz associate from Dallas there and did not have a good meal at all.  I let the management know  and they went out of their way to make our return visit very special - this restaurant is serious about customer service.  The food tonight was absolutely perfect  the service spot on.  The crudo.  Lord.  This is the way that restaurants should handle the occasional bad night - which they all have - A 
ATX Cocina,343,ATX Cocina might be my favorite restaurant in Austin. It certainly isn t the cheapest  but so worth it. Given its prime location  ATX is the perfect option for a happy hour cocktail before dinner or amazing spot for dinner  I haven t had a bad dish yet . I always try to take friends family here when they are in town.  Sope is incredible  esquites are very tasty  empanadas are amazing as well  but bean-based  in case you re not a big beans fan 
ATX Cocina,344,I don t usually give out 3 stars. Went here with a group of 5 when they opened at 4 30. I thought they were closed because I couldn t open the door  turns out it was just a really heavy door . I was really irked because the host saw us struggling with the door and just smirked and didn t try to help us out. Got a really snooty vibe. Later  we saw the host opening the door for other people...so not sure what the deal was. Once inside  we were told it was open seating so we found a spot in the corner. Overall  the waiter was nice enough but we were a little annoyed because it just felt like he was rushing us through when we were trying to order and ask questions. He didn t write anything down so he missed a couple things. I m just disappointed because although the food was good  though not sure if it was worth the price point   the service and atmosphere were not welcoming or friendly.  Food  Guacamole was ok. Duck tacos were good especially the green salsa that comes with it. Taquitos and Chicarron  sp   were ok but not worth  9. Margarita Drinks were great.
ATX Cocina,345,These are the types of reviews I most enjoy writing. I had the pleasure of having my first meal in Austin at ATX Cocina. What stood out to me was not only the absolutely delicious food  but the unparalleled service. I had the privilege of having Erin as my waiter  and he was so knowledgable about the cuisine and offered recommendations that were not automated  rather tailored to my specified interests and diet restrictions. If you find yourself in Austin  I would highly recommend going to this restaurant and making an effort to request Erin as your server.
ATX Cocina,346,My partner and I were very excited to try this restaurant but it was such a huge disappointment.  The food was very good but the service was shameful.  The waiter rushed us through ordering and eating our meal.  We finished drinks and what should have been a three course meal in about an hour.  Our reservation was at 8 15 on a Sunday night.  We ordered a couple of small plates along with drinks.  Then he pressured us into choosing an entree at the same time as ordering our small plates because  the meats would take an hour to prepare.  We hadn t even eaten half of our second small plate when our main course and side were dumped alongside the plate we were sharing.  It felt like he was  trying to cram food down our throats and get us out.  Of course we weren t finishing eating our dinner when he came to clear the plates.  At that point my stomach just hurt.  After we agreed we were finished  he picked up our partially eaten dinner plate and started to walk away with it....NOT even asking us if we wanted to take anything home.  I had to ask him to box it up.  It was very obvious that he was trying to get us out of there as quickly as possible.  The absolute worst service.  I have had much better service in diners.
ATX Cocina,347,Beet Pibil- if you like beets this is a must  if you even think you like beets  you should try this.  Great presentation. No spice alert here.  Salsa Tasting - ummm even the mild was too much for me.  Verduras Brussel Sprouts  liked it so much we got 2 orders  Guacamole  esquites  poached corn    Crab Tostada  all good and SPICY.  Lamb Adobo was very good  but was considered spicy.  If you can just pick off some of the meat   it s delicious.  Chile Roasted Chicken- we asked to have this toned down and they did  but then they served it on a sauced bed that was super spicy.  This is a very unusual Mexican restaurant.  Totally modern concept.  I cannot tolerate must spice beyond salt  so I was hesitant to try anything.  It s really a restaurant where you can go from zero to 100 miles an hour in spice taste.  The rest of our group loved everything we had  as did the rest of the crowded and popping restaurant around us.  We were very lucky and got a corner booth near the window with a great view of the kitchen.  The place is relatively loud  but you can still hear.  Our server was pleasant and the overall dinner and drinks were good. For our group of 5 with drinks the meal w  tax came out to over  200.  Per person that is not bad. I recommend you make a reservation even on a week night and let them know where you would like to sit.
ATX Cocina,348,Unfortunately I can t rate ATX Cocina higher since we had an OK meal but when we tried to pay with a travelers check only  after  signing the travelers check payable to ATX  did a manager inform us that they didn t accept travelers checks...would have been good to know as the sever had given us his pen and provided the info to sign the check over to ATX .   Anyway  the manager basically said it was our loss and we were out 100   talk about A TERRIBLE customer experience...  Won t be back until they get their act together     _   _  
ATX Cocina,349,We had happy hour appetizers and drinks. It s an interesting spin on the Mexican staples. Delicious food. We had tamal and guacamole. Margaritas for drinks.
ATX Cocina,350,Amazing. From the drinks. To the service. Has to be the best guacamole and THE best pork chop we have ever had. The entree is big enough to share  which allows you to try other things. Our neighbor said that the Caesar salad was the best  and her husband didn t usually like Caesar salads. The burrata was superb. Will be back. Highly recommend.
ATX Cocina,351,Let s be clear  this is not run of the mill lame Tex Mex. This is high end refined eating Mexican style. ATX is a happening hip restaurant. The drinks and bar scene are great.  Check out the Paloma during happy hour. Their margarita is solid and they have a surprisingly good wine list. As for the food  try the guacamole and salsa sampler. Their salsas are fantastic. For dinner we had the short ribs and the shrimp dish. Skip the shrimp and order two of the short ribs. To die for. The street corn is a great side dish. Make sure to make a reservation.
ATX Cocina,352,Absolutely love this place  This might be one of our new favorite spots in Austin...  - Food is delicious  creative and totally doable when on a paleo diet - Service has been great every time - A little noisy-- highly recommend the patio  This place is at the top of our recommendation list 
ATX Cocina,353,I love it when a place lives up to the newly-opened hype. ATX cocina knocked it out the park for us last night. It s beautifully designed  I love an interesting ceiling    well laid or laid out and lit - and is an EXCELLENT people watching spot  Spectacularly good margaritas  which is HIGH praise in Austin   - great service from Katie - the intro cevice  fundido and sopas were all magic. I was so full by the mains that I didn t actually manage much of the Chicken with white Mole or delicious smelling lamb but instead guarded the side of Brussels fiercely from over enthusiastic tasters - Too many siblings growing up does not make for a good adult sharer...  I am not a gluten avoider - I usually resent gluten free choices but nothing here made me feel even remotely like it was missing or being substituted. 8 enthusiastic thumbs up from our  very contentedly full  four top. Easy 5 
ATX Cocina,354,I ve avoided this place because I just thought it was another expensive Mexican food place. Went last night and it was incredible. Nothing Tex-Mex about it. Really really good service team  great atmosphere and the food was really good. We had the Hamachi Crudo  guacamole  prime rib  pork chops  giant shrimp  chicken with white mol   and some other stuff. Dynamite. Will return for sure. A welcome addition to the upscale downtown dining scene.
ATX Cocina,355,While the food is fabulous...the pretentiousness of a certain male  bartenders is off the charts. If you offer me and my girlfriend a tequila shot we assume you are comping it   especially when you don t ask which one we would like or tell us the price  Not mention when we asked if you were joining  you said yes and then proceeded to hide while you took the shot or tell us we were paying for it. We were charged  48 for there shots  As two out of work women we would never have done those shots as they were so far out of out budget. To us it was a scam to get our money  we will never be back and worn all unaccompanied women to be careful...  So disappointed...  UPDATE  When e restaurant corrects a service problem and reached out with management at ATXCocina did with me I fell it is only fair I update my review. Managements response and reaching out  as well as another staff member reaching out  shows true professionalism  courtesy  understanding of the service business and care for their customers. Given this and the quality of their food they now deserve 5 stars.
ATX Cocina,356,Unable to review the food since we were racially profiled and not allowed in. Hilarious    With the arrival of ATX Cocina  Austin has officially become Dallas.   Me  well how long is the wait for two   Hostess  We re at maximum capacity.  Me  Really  for how long   Hostess  Indefinitely.  Never made eye contact  waved us to the door. Host  or waiter guy walks us to the door and gestures to usher us out.   Well  see you never  Have fun shuttering  your  Mexican  food restaurant soon.
ATX Cocina,357,For context  a party of 7 went on a Saturday and we sat on the patio.   The drinks are good. We mostly had the kate Del Castillo- an interpretation of a Moscow mule. Happy daily  including weekends is great     The food  most of the crudo  - also very tasty and refreshing.   The service - underwhelming but I am hoping this is just opening pains and transition. We ordered a queso fundido at the beginning of the night and we were short on tortillas for each person. Ask for more tortillas- should be an easy request  Throughout the night  no dice. They kept telling us   it s coming  they re going to be right out...  and they even teased us with a  we are going to bring out a new queso since it s been so long...  and nothing. We asked for our checks and there is no mention of the queso.   It s unfortunate  because we knew another who had no trouble getting what they needed. The food and drinks are good  the staff is super nice but they fell short on actual delivery.
ATX Cocina,358,Don t go and don t bother making reservations if you re an African American family. The hostess will automatically put you outside on the patio in the hot July sun in spite of your specific reservations inside and in spite of them having several open tables inside to accommodate us at 5 45pm for our 6pm reservations.   We were never asked if we preferred inside or outside. Since we refused to sit outside we were seated at the community table with strangers.   We did not penalize the waitress and gave her a generous tip  30   in spite of how we were treated at the front door. So much for a nice intimate family dinner out. It doesn t matter how good  or average  your overpriced food is.   It s people  places and things like this that kill a city s reputation.
ATX Cocina,359,Everything was amazing. Truly so amazing. Drinks were great  guacamole appetizer and fundido  We kept ordering guacamole throughout our meal. The carne asada was amazing. Service was great. Just an excellent experience with wonderful food
ATX Cocina,360,Had a nice relatively early  530  dinner here last night with 3 others. We ordered quite a bit of food and cocktails.   Here s what I liked  style interior  beautiful   guac with homemade blue corn chips  Mezcal pineapple cocktail  had 2     the pork pibil tomahawk  WOW   and the service  tho it got a little slow as the place started filling up .    What I didn t like   Salsa trio was underwhelming  my swordfish was tasty but overcooked by 1 min making is a little graining instead of juicy moist.  Lastly  I do not need to see all the great HH stuff prices on all the menus without explaining HH is ONLY AVAILABLE AT THE BAR   It s the 3rd restaurant in Austin where I ve seen this. I don t get it... I don t understand why HH can t be available regardless of where I sit like at June s  But if it s only available at the bar  COOL  then just print that on the menu too  for pete s sake 
ATX Cocina,361,Ordered the borracho  drunk  snapper which was beautiful  delicate   amp a delicious. I also tried the tuna and beef tartare  both of which were super fresh and beautiful presented.   My only complaint was that my friend s dish was served to her with a long hair on top. We informed the manager who replaced the dish  however he did not offer to comp her meal. I thought that was a huge letdown.
ATX Cocina,362,Perfect place to get a drink before seeing a concert at Moody Theater. The atmosphere and decor was incredible and so were the appetizers. Excellent service.
ATX Cocina,363,On the pricier side  but the food is pretty good  For dinner we ordered guacamole  brussel sprouts  and the chili roasted chicken. Chicken was a bit dry  but overall the flavor profiles were really nice. Would recommend to others 
ATX Cocina,364,The decor is kinda showpiece which is nice and noticeable.   Curb appeal  matters.  Found this on  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FEater.com amp s 6b7910e6176ff9166277ef50a29af7da7b3dc698a133787bbaca8190e3495784  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  Eater.com  a  and wanted to take a group of out of town visitors for a nice dinner - group of 8.    The food was so beautiful and delicious that I couldn t stop to take pictures for my Yelp review - we were too busy passing the food around and table and enjoying the experience.  We felt like we were having Thanksgiving.  Lighting and noise level was all perfect for convo and bonding.  We ordered pretty much one of everything.  The Brussels sprouts and queso were the stand outs for me but the meat eaters  I m a much of the time vegetarian  raved about the meaty items.  I d suggest to go with a group so you can try as many items as possible 
ATX Cocina,365,Absolutely amazing. Top five one of the best meals I ve ever had. From start to finish absolutely amazing. Sat at the bar with Sarah and Caitlin  they re amazing  and recommended the  pequeno Lorenzo  cocktail  without knowing my names Lorenzo  it was perfectly crafted. We proceeded to order the ENTIRE happy hour menu. Everything was sensational  especially the pork tacos and the queso fondito. I m in love  if I lived in Austin I would eat here regularly. It was so good we re staying for dinner
ATX Cocina,366,Well  that was delicious. I m sure I appeared cheap. Ah well. I ordered I wanted. Two happy hour Paloma cocktails. Deliciously grapefruity. Happy hour chicken tacos. Good  but a little dry. Happy hour pork tacos. Moist and delicious. Main menu salsa tasting.  33.56 total. Worth at least twice that.
ATX Cocina,367,So yummy. Shared about 12 plates everything was solid. Favorites were the beef tartar  hamachi  tomahawk  pork belly  chicken  short rib  Brussels  corn  and striper.
ATX Cocina,368,Food is very good. Service not so great. After being lectured twice about not being able to reorder from the bar menu at our table and the fact the kitchen was strictly gluten free I think I m done there.
ATX Cocina,369,Some of the most inventive and best Mexican I have had in awhile. Try the Brussels sprouts  ATX margarita  make it a spicy  and the short rib. Amazing.
ATX Cocina,370,My dinner with my wife and kids here tonight was nothing short of outstanding. First night on my first visit to Austin couldn t have been better thanks to ATX. I could go on and on but if you are reading this review right now just close the Yelp app and make a reservAtion at this establishment - you ll thank me.
ATX Cocina,371,Loved everything we had... The snapper ceviche  the oxtail quesadillas  and the duck tacos-- all fab  Great cocktails too  and the atmosphere was lively 
ATX Cocina,372,Complements to Kevin  the chef  and his team     Hands down the best dining experience I ve had in Austin in 20 years. This is not fast food  it s gourmet dining  so bring good friends and enjoy a few ATX margaritas  The food and atmosphere are amazing and I promise it s nothing like you have had in Austin before   Keep keeping it weird  unique and favors from out of this world 
ATX Cocina,373,Made a quick reservation for a busy time on open table. Was seated as soon as I arrived. From then on  it was magic.   The Paloma grapefruit cocktail was incredible. Perfect flavors. Talented mixologist. I could seriously drink these all day.   The flight of salsas was everything. Such complex flavors  very much worth  5.   I had the shrimp taco. The flavors were nice. Worked really well together. A little bit of effort to remove the tails and head  but the heirloom tomatoes were juicy and perfect.  I also ordered a side of chorizo Brussels sprouts. My two favorite things were married beautifully. Seriously. Loved this dish.   Everything was plated well. The decor is lovely. The people who rated this place low stars were hangry because this place was great.
ATX Cocina,374,Great happy hour. Friendly staff  tasty margs and abundant outdoor seating. Celebrated our anniversary and staff acknowledged with a very nice card and flutes of champagne. Only thing missing was espresso for my caffeine addiction. Will visit again 
ATX Cocina,375,This place is great  the customer service and food is delicious I can t found a better place that this one for my first time in Austin.
ATX Cocina,376,WoW - Fantastic. I was happily greeted by Daniel Sweeten who took the time to show myself and my date around the new restaurant. Beautiful decor  SPOTLESS kitchen  food was fantastic  portions enormous  flavor was great  price is not unreasonable for what you get. The shrimp were literally as thick as my wrists  right from the gulf.  I honestly always try to find something wrong with every place I eat at  just for the sake of that s  my job . And I tried - I really tried. Nothing but perfection.  Wait staff is extremely educated and clearly passionate about their food and their service. I cannot wait to go back and HIGHLY recommend trying something new  a bit different  a little challenging for the pallet. Well worth your time and effort all around.  Thank you again Mr. Sweeten for taking the time we needed  with us 
ATX Cocina,377,Trendy place  got there and they said it would be an hour  an hour later I asked them what s up and the wait was then an hour and 17 minutes.  My buddy Tbone talked to the manager and they seated us a little faster though.  Menu is confusing food below average.  Staff not great in general.  Don t go here unless you have Tbone with you.
ATX Cocina,378,ATX Cocina rises to the top-tier of our list of favorite restaurants in Austin. We came for an anniversary dinner and the service was amazing from the moment we walked in the door. Our waiter  Willis was knowledgeable about the menu and offered up his favorites. His recommendations didn t disappoint. The evening started off with complimentary champagne for our anniversary and followed with another wonderful surprise. This restaurant knows how to deliver to make for an exceptional experience. The food was delicious from start to finish. The sope was flavorful and amazing  I highly recommend getting this as a starter. We also had the guacamole  cangrejo  crab  and the barbacoa beef short rib. This is elevated dining and each dish was well prepared. The margaritas here are also noteworthy. Thank you to the staff at ATX Cocina for delivering on a fantastic dinner.
ATX Cocina,379,Came here with my parents  from Japan   The restaurant is beautiful inside  It s a pretty large restaurant with attive wait staff. We ordered the salsa sampler and also guacamole. The salsa was amazing and guacamole was good  they give you a huge portion of guacamole   The chips are really good they make in-house I believe  I got a top shelf margarita on the rocks and I was disappointed. My second drink I got the Mezcal cocktail and it was freaking amazing  We ordered 2 different ceviches and both was pretty good.. It s a little on the pricey side  But I definitely will come back again 
ATX Cocina,380,3 stars for the margaritas and the wonderful customer service. BUT it s very unfortunate that one of the best items on the menu was discontinued. The tamale  Even the waiter and his partner suggested that many customers complain that that particular item was removed. Why remove an item that was popular   Hope to return back and have the return of the famous tamale 
ATX Cocina,381,Came here last night for the first time. The food was delicious and the customer service was outstanding. We ordered the Hamachi and ended up receiving the campechana. When we told them it s not what we ordered they let us keep it on the house and then got us the right dish  I ended up liking the campechana better so it was a happy accident. Then we ordered the Brussel sprouts and the chicken with White mole. It was taking a while and we realized that we were about to miss our movie. The manager  who had been checking in on us  took both dishes off the bill but offered to wrap it up so we could pick it up after the movie. They were closed by the time the movie was done but still let us come by for the food. Very thoughtful and even cold both dishes were excellent  Highly recommended this place. The design  vibe and drinks were also awesome 
ATX Cocina,382,In the land of so many fantastic and creative chef driven restaurants ATX Cocina is one of the best. One of the best atmospheres of any restaurant I have been to  and the food was amazing. It is not your typical Tex Mex  but rather a more authentic Mexican food I am not sure if it highlights a particular region or not . We had a group of four  ordered family style and ordered the Sope  Unlike anything I have ever had but amazing   guac  cangrejo  borracho snapper  incredible   tacos arabes  carne asada  and the barbacoa short rib. Everything was fantastic.
ATX Cocina,383,This place gets 2 stars because the food was really good.  I would give it negative stars if I could for service.  In fairness  it was mother s day and they usually aren t open during brunch hours.  Our reservation was at 2pm  so on the tail end of the brunch.  They had a limited  fixed price menu..you pick appetizer  4 choices   entree  4-5 choices  and dessert  3 choices .  The food we ordered was excellent.  However  our total time there was 2.5 hours...for three courses.  The service was painfully slow and unorganized.  We waited about 40 minutes for dessert only to be told they ran out.  They scraped together some fruit for us.  I think at the point that they realized they had no dessert to offer should have just comped us a couple of drinks and let us go....not hold us there for 40 minutes with the promise that  dessert was coming  only to bring us a couple of melon slices.  We ve been to ATX Cocina on several other occasions with good experiences but I don t think we can go back after that debacle.
ATX Cocina,384,Our waitress and food were great  The hostess  Taylor  however  was not friendly over the phone or while we were waiting to be seated. Understandably it is a challenging time to be in the restaurant business  but as the face of the restaurant - the host hostess should make every effort to make patrons feel welcome. We did not feel welcome at all at ATX Cocina.
ATX Cocina,385,Was very excited to finally go to this neighborhood eatery. The outdoor patio is lovely as is the interior. That s the only positive thing I can say. The hostess service is non-existent. I had a reservation for 5 30 and the patio was practically empty. When I asked for a better table away from the swinging door it became a project. I was told  those tables have 6 00 reservations ...not specially reserved  mind you  and they were tables of 4 as was mine.  The hostess finally relented. While sitting there someone else asked for a table change and it appeared to not a problem at all. The server was equally disappointing. She paid hardly any attention...we couldn t even get a basket of chips WITHOUT also ordering guacamole  we weren t even given the option. The food was greasy and over-salted  not to mention overpriced for what it was. We were rushed and ignored.  Would I go again    NEVER  and I most certainly not recommend.
ATX Cocina,386,Was able to celebrate a milestone birthday with a few close friends at this wonderful restaurant.   They have a great outdoor patio area under a huge tree which is awesome in these covid times.   The food was delicious  the drinks too good  and the service amazing.   Highly recommend   
ATX Cocina,387,I love this place. It is a little expensive but if you re trying to ball out it is the right choice  Their homemade tortillas are divine  We ended up super balling out and got the el hefe to split between 3 people for dinner and it was incredible. cooked perfectly. The salsa tasting was equally as incredible 
ATX Cocina,388,In 35 years of eating  this place is in my Top 3   As soon as I knew we were traveling to Austin I made a reservation because I m a big believer in one of the owners so I knew it would exceed expectations.  Service  The reservation was for 6 people and two of the folks joining us were in high chairs.  The table was in an appropriate section for children and the high chairs were ready when we arrived.  Our waiter  Logan  I believe  was absolutely top rank   He was very attentive to all 6 of us and very energetic.  Loved the creativity for the kids cups. Logan and I chatted a bit and he offered to introduce me to Kevin  Chef Partner .  It was obvious right away that Kevin is one of a kind  must be where he was raised  and it was great that he took a few minutes to  chat with us with a packed restaurant on a Friday night.  Food  Logan dared us to try some new things and I m glad he did.  Kevin and his team are on top of things   Try the prawns.  Absolutely one of the best experiences all around 
ATX Cocina,389,Visiting Austin from San Diego  so you can imagine my Mexican food standards are snobbish lol. This place was AMAZING     Our server was Enrique  he made our visit here-- and delightful experience. He took the time to ask us our preferences so as to help us choose the best foods we wanted. But also wasn t overstepping  we are kinda inquisitive and he definitely catered to this very well. All the things he recommend did not disappoint. My friend and I are until our tummies hurt. So if you are in town  and you are like food  eat here 
ATX Cocina,390,Hamachi is amazing. The toasted crisp that comes with guacamole also was sort of addicting. Then my next faves are the Brussels sprouts and the corn. I tried the chicken  pork pibil  tostadas  and shrimp -- they were good but didn t blow me away. Dessert was also okay they only had 2 and none of them was overly sweet which is a problem for me LOL.   Decor was on point -- I was amazed at how many custom made furniture and just pretty much custom made everything they had    I d still recommend this place because truthfully things tasted great overall  not out of this world but hey sometimes that s okay  and I like this much better than Fonda San Miguel.
ATX Cocina,391,Had a wonderful time there tonight. The food and drinks were amazing  great atmosphere  and excellent service. My new favorite spot. Get the lamb tacos  you won t be disappointed.
ATX Cocina,392,With a pretty street price point  the  drinks and appetizers  mindset makes ATX Cocina your perfect early evening destination.   There are a million and one Mexican restaurants to choose from in Austin. I ll start by saying this  ATX Cocina should be your number one. I m the kind of girl  due to food allergies  who checks the menu before I dine at any restaurant. The beauty of ATX Cocina is that I didn t have to - naturally their entire menu is gluten free  They source their masa from Mexico  giving it that real deal authentic flavor. Already a win in my book. The atmosphere gets a 5 5 in itself. The ambiance  design and the service  Amelio is easily the sweetest  most genuine server I have had the pleasure of meeting  were impeccable. I usually don t use strong words to describe service  but seriously - they were extremely busy this evening  yet I felt as if Amelio went out of his way to make sure my guest and I were doing great. You could tell the staff was well educated on where their food came from  the details of each dish  and what food paired well with what.   That being said  we let Amelio pick our dishes -- The ATX Margaritas to start. Holy strong  But so fresh. Exactly what a margarita on the rocks should be. Followed by the compechana crude  a mix of octopus  shrimp and salsa roja. Let me tell ya  I cannot handle spice for the life of me BUT the cold avocado in this dish masked the bite that comes first. Amelio suggested the sopes with pibil  bean puree and a jabenero salsa along with verdures for my guest who is vegetarian  crispy brussels . THE SOPES  Ohhh the sopes  So soft  tender and flavorful. I hardly dabble with red meat  but this was 110  worth it.  Would I dine here again  Surely. Would I recommend this to my celiac friends  Again and again. Not even a scant possibility of cross-contamination  a celiacs dream restaurant   Should you request Amelio as your server  YES    The options are endless. I cannot wait to bring my fellow GF friends here to try out the rest of their amazing menu items 
ATX Cocina,393,Excellent food and ambiance. The lamb was amazing  portions are really big  even the side dishes . Definitely recommend ordering a skinny margarita.
ATX Cocina,394,Really was looking forward to checking this place out however I didn t get a chance due to being told there were no tables available for the next 2 hours DESPITE the restaurant appearing to be half empty. Honestly me and my buddy felt discriminated against.
ATX Cocina,395,The house marg with  some jalape os is world class  I split a chicken plate with someone and wow.. amazing definitely coming back 
ATX Cocina,396,Avoid. Food  amp  Cocktails are pretty good. Service is horrific.   Would you like still or sparkling water     Sparkling  please    She refills and refills - then then the bill eventually comes. More spent on water than cocktails- wow  Perhaps mention it  We informed the hostess. Her response  uhhhhh okay  - please  train your staff. I don t care about the money  it s the principle of the matter.   Bottom line  good drinks  cute atmosphere  pathetic service staff.
ATX Cocina,397,I ve eaten here 3 times now and had a fantastic experience each time. I recommend going with a group and indulging in the menu  family style  so you can try a variety of things.   The burrata is light fresh and delicious. The pork chop is excellent  and the drinks are great. The menu is modern and the flavors are bold    Highly recommend 
ATX Cocina,398,My coworker claims that ATX Cocina is the one place he would recommend non-local Austinites to try if they were only in town for a day. As you would imagine  my friendship with him highly depended on whether or not ATX Cocina really lives up to the expectations.  First off  right when you walk in  you immediately get hit with Harry Potter Dining Room vibes. Lots of movement  lots of chatter  and lots of aesthetic chaos. We fortunately got seated outside  but even then  we had to slightly yell just to hear each other - so definitely not the most romantic dinner atmosphere. As appetizers  we got the Sope  Queso  and Verduras. Personally for me  the Verduras was the highlight of the night. The Sope was pretty good and unique  but the Queso was the reason why I docked off a star. Admittedly  I m not a huge fan of cheese to begin with  but I usually do like a good queso as an appetizer. However  the queso here was so legit that the cheese started to harden as we worked on it  to the point where none of us could finish it. If you really wanted to try the queso  I would definitely recommend getting it with a bigger group of people because you get tired of it very easily as you re literally just eating a huge block of cheese. As for our entree  we got the Carne Asada which was pretty freaking good. The beef was super tender and super flavorful  definitely recommend.   Overall  I had a solid experience at ATX Cocina  and I can safely say that I am still friends with my coworker. The queso docked off a star for me  but I m sure everything else there tastes really good. Don t forget to get the Verduras - best brussel sprouts you ll ever have in your life.
ATX Cocina,399,Came in for Friday lunch and sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and made good recommendations from the menu. We had the herby guacamole  tuna crudo  and the beet salad. I could literally eat that tuna crudo everyday  So light and flavorful. I enjoyed the beet salad but felt there was way more cheese than beets. Overall  great experience 
ATX Cocina,400,My absolute favorite restaurant in Austin. A gluten free heaven of god sent Mexican food.
ATX Cocina,401,This place was awesome  Our friends that recently moved to Austin were dying to try this place and it did not disappoint. We started with the queso fundido and chips with salsa. I loved the warm corn tortillas and also the large chips they served with both. As for the main course  the food was amazing. I had the barbacoa beef short rib which melted in my mouth it was so tender. The guys both had the duck tacos and my friend had the jumbo lump crab tostada. We shared a bowl of the Mexican street corn which was also fantastic. If I ever make it back to Austin I will definitely be eating here. Highly recommend.
ATX Cocina,402,The food  the Drinks and the service were phenomenal  One of the best restaurants I have ever been too. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting in the area 
ATX Cocina,403,Had dinner here last night for the first time and the experience was great  Our waitress  Monique  was lovely and her customer service was spectacular  The environment of the restaurant was beautiful  the food was amazing  and I ll definitely be back  Order the Queso  amp  Brussel sprouts for an appetizer  Unreal.
ATX Cocina,404,First time here  had a reservation for 7 30- had to wait a bit which was fine  the guacamole came out quickly which was great because we were starving. The food came out like an hour after ordering it but it was superb. I would try this place again but not on a Saturday night.
ATX Cocina,405,Great food  mostly shared items  were creative and tasty. Very youthful  20 and 30-somethings should try a Friday night    we ended up eating at the bar because we could tell it was going to take longer than we were told.   Specialty drinks are great and wonderful bartenders. Go for the bar but then stay for the food.
ATX Cocina,406,What an experience    The restaurant was inviting from the time we entered the door.  Table layout and lighting is perfect.  The staff is very friendly.  We sat on the spacious patio under a big oak tree.  It was awesome.  The food was spectacular    We will be going back.   Visiting from Allen  TX.
ATX Cocina,407,My husband and I walked in without a reservation  there was nothing available until 10pm  but we were I invited to sit at the bar. It was super busy  however Morgan  bartender  managed to take great care of us  He made great and delicious drinks for us  We ordered the queso fundido and that was great as well 
ATX Cocina,408,My boyfriend and I visited ATX Cocina for the first time 2 days ago and I still can t shut up about how delicious the food was. I am literally eating my leftovers right now and  I have died and gone to heaven    To rank what I loved the most...it would go in this order   1. Esquites  the buttered corn  2. Chili roasted chicken 3. Barbacoa beef short-rib 4. Guacamole  5. Burrata with heirloom tomato      the margarita was yummy too  If you enjoy new and delicious food you will not be disappointed 
ATX Cocina,409,So--the food here is amazing. But the service SUCKED.  Our waiter dropped a bottle of tonic on me and barely apologized.  He was pretty non-present the whole time--I could not locate him on the wait floor.  I specifically asked for a margarita with no sweetener--it was the sweetest marg I have had in a long time.  All of our entrees didn t come out together--a sin in this price range.  He forgot an order of brussel sprouts.  Never asked if we wanted more drinks--not once and then he kept doing this dumb   thumbs up  weak.  It s really loud in here too--so if you are over 25 and are dining with friends  you might want to chose another restaurant.  Or come super early. Again  food was pretty amazing--the guac and the crudo were spectacular  the mole chicken was also great. So was the ceasar salad.  But really  they should do a little more training of their staff.  I guess since this place is full and these servers are probably making bank  they don t really care to be great.  But I won t be back because there s restaurants with great service in this cityI ll go to those.
ATX Cocina,410,We were in Austin on vacation. ATX was recommended by a local bartender. We went for happy hour and definitely would not go back  The food and drinks were average. The bartenders were some of the rudest individuals I have encountered  and by the was not busy at all   Not the impression of Austin I expected 
ATX Cocina,411,Food and service were both amazing and I can t wait to go back  The short ribs and corn were by far my favorite  
ATX Cocina,412,In a sea of up and coming Austin restaurants ATX Cocina has some serious buzz.  The location is decent  the space is massive and the concept is appealing.  When I make an initial visit to a trendy new spot I examine the menu for two key things.  1  Is the menu innovative and constantly evolving    2  If the menu doesn t change  are there main stay items that I would keep me coming back    Visit 1- Table of 5 with clients.  Decent food to share  refreshing cocktails and an acceptable wine menu.  Good service but nothing to write home about.   Visit 2- Table of 5 with long time friends.  More focused on the company of our group.  Again the food was decent but the same options as before.  This go around I made the observation that the flavors were not as exciting as before.  Service spotty at best.  F1 weekend  more or less expected Visit 3- Bar service for 2.  How many lame dates can actually sit at one bar   Or perhaps this is the new after work pick up restaurant.  Crappy overpriced cocktail   food arrived room temperature  had to request tortillas that were expected to come with  and service was absolute shit.   So  we ve established that neither of my first two rules seem to apply.  Compounded by the average wait staff and high price tag and I simply scratch my head in wonder as to what the appeal is.   I rarely give a restaurant three shots to wow me but I clearly got suckered here.  I wanted to love this place but sad to say  three strikes and you re out.  Onward and upward....
ATX Cocina,413,All around great evening  On our first visit  our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us pick out an amazing meal. We weren t too up on tequila types  but he helped us pick out a few to try. The guacamole was the BEST  must get for an app. We got the chicken  duck  and shrimp which was shared at the table. Huge amount of food  nobody left hungry. I would call ahead to get a reservation but it is a must try in Austin 
ATX Cocina,414,Great food  great service  fantastic atmosphere  absolutely gorgeous building   everything you want for a night out.
ATX Cocina,415,Everything was amazing  Definitely get the guacamole and order off the tequila menu  atx margarita was good add spice. We had the short rib it fell apart perfectly and also all the crudo was great. Interiors to the nines. Great service.
ATX Cocina,416,A fun dinner. I was there for the second time  this time with my wife and son. The Fundido was luscious  as usual  with fresh tortillas to scoop up the aromatic cheese. We followed that with the Hamachi Collar which was cooked to perfection. We did not leave a morsel on the bones. The Caesar salad was a delightful surprise with just the right amount of creaminess and lemon to balance the dish. My Chile Roasted Chicken was brined and coated beautifully and finally roasted to perfection. I am a dark meat fan but the breast meat was so moist and flavorful that I ate every bite. Again  a fun evening with great food in a new go-to restaurant.
ATX Cocina,417,Went for lunch on a Friday  only open on firsays for lunch  while in town and loved the food. It s crazy  but the salad was the biggest hit at the table   Everything was so delicious. We were sites in the outdoor patio which was very quiet with nobody there. The front room is really nice though. Would have preferred that.
ATX Cocina,418,The menu is hard to understand. What s the point of having Spanish in the title and the description  The description is supposed to be in English so everyone  even foreigners  can understand it.  The beef rib eye and tomahawk pork are ordered by the ounce but the minimum is 36 oz. Why not list 36oz  88 on the menu   They gave us sample salsa with tortillas  but when we asked for more tortillas they brought more tortillas and took away the salsas...  The bus boy is sweeping the floor under the tables next to us right now as we wait for our food.  The ribeye was delivered to us and right when I finished taking pictures they came back and said it was delivered to the wrong table  they dropped it off to the table across from us and although I didn t touch it  The other customers accused me of touching the food and wanted another steak.  an honest mistake  can t fault the server for it   The watermelon Agua Fresca juice drank is fantastic and tastes great  but the paper straws are so shitty they fall apart after 2 sips forcing you to put your mouth on the rim of the glass like a peasant.   We told the waiter we have some lactose intolerant guests in our party but the Brussel sprouts came with some cheese on top.  The 36oz ribeye steaks were soooooooo good  We got medium rare  the only right way  and split the steak. It was definitely worth the price   If I could do it all over again I would only order the 36oz ribeye steak to share with my gf and 2 glasses of the watermelon Agua Fresca. That s about  100 before tax and tip.
ATX Cocina,419,One of the best Mexican restaurants out there  and I have tried Mexican restaurants all over the world. All the dishes were flavorful.  The Michelada was just the right way to start. Followed by the beet salad  Cesar salad  easy on the salt   papas bravas  better than Barcelona although spicy   esquite corn  Brussels sprouts and short ribs  unbelievably delicious .   Must try in Texas 
ATX Cocina,420,Had the best time ever here at ATX Cocina  I highly recommend to anyone in town  Come here and request Greg  such a friendly and knowledgeable server  
ATX Cocina,421,Great food  fast service  but the staff was absolutely the most pretentious staff I have ever experienced. The hostess had a major attitude and even when we made a reservation she did not seat us for 20 minutes. She practically rolled her eyes when we told her we had one child  17 months old . Our waiter was fast  but rude. When we asked  what are your best dishes on the menu   he said  what I just read you a second ago....  which were the specials. I mean come on  Have some patience. All in all  the food was delicious  seating was slow WITH a reservation  waiters were fast  but extremely sassy and rude. Really disappointed. Michale Hsu did an amazing job designing the place and the chef is doing a fabulous job but the staff is absolutely ruining it.
ATX Cocina,422,I had the pleasure of getting a reservation on a Tuesday night upon my arrival to Austin. My cousin Hannah Moody recommended this amazing restaurant. The food was incredible  some of the best dishes I have ever tasted. The brussel sprouts. The octopus. The lengua quesadilla. The ATX margarita. Killer. Simply delicious. 10 out of 10. Last but not least  our server Katie was a true professional. She made the experience memorable. Thank you  Katie.
ATX Cocina,423,The food was fantastic.  The service was the worst I ve had in a long time.  I was embarrassed to recommend this restaurant to my co workers.
ATX Cocina,424,Wow  I ve been wanting to go to this restaurant for several months and I finally made it  It was one of the best meals I ve ever had  I highly highly recommend trying it out. Everything was wonderful - the service  the atmosphere  the pace of the dishes coming out and of course the food   I will absolutely be back and bring my friends 
ATX Cocina,425,Four of us went here on a Tuesday night at 7 15pm and had a great experience. It could be a completely different story on a busy weekend though.  Anyways  here s our story   We arrived about 20 minutes early because traffic was not the nightmare we were anticipating and we scored a parking meter right across the street. I love free parking on weekday nights   I did see that you could valet on San Antonio St. right next to the entrance if you needed to. We walked in and the decor is just beautiful. There is a huge circular bar right at the entrance that is first come first serve. It was completely packed  you can eat there  and I m assuming it was the leftover Happy Hour crowd. The restaurant  however  was not very packed at all and the hostess offered to seat us early. The seating is a mixed combination of booths that could fit about 6-8 people and surrounding tables. As is currently popular in most Austin restaurants these days  they had the half booth half chairs arrangement along the perimeter. Normally I HATE this  because I feel like I m eating at someone else s table or that they are listening to my conversation  but the tables were just far enough apart that it felt okay.  Our waitress came by and was really friendly. We just had beer and wine  so no cocktails--but they did sound very interesting. After all the drinks were delivered  it did take a bit of time  for a Tuesday  for her to come back so we could order food  but she returned and we started off with the guacamole and queso fundido. The guac was fantastic. It was a large portion and perfect for 4 people who enjoy their guac. It comes with these long cracker chips  one for each person  that are homemade and deliciously seasoned. We did need a second order of chips for us to finish the guacamole. One chip per person was not enough. We each had two. We could have gone without the queso. It was probably the least favorite of the night. It s not smooth and creamy like your typical chips and queso. It s basically a small hot skillet of melted cheese  texture of mozzarella  and comes with tiny corn tortillas--we needed to order more of these as well because was it was delivered with 2 and we had 4 people. It was very greasy and messy. For the little that was delivered none of us really wanted to finish it.  On to the entrees...they were stellar  Absolutely fantastic and a decent sized portion. They were so rich that only one of us was able to finish. The rest of us took ours home. I had the chili roasted chicken and it was delicious--one of the best chicken dishes I ve ever eaten--seriously   My husband normally doesn t order chicken if there are other meat options but liked mine so much that he d consider ordering it if we return. He ordered the lamb adobo which he thoroughly enjoyed  he was the only one who finished . Our friends ordered the duck carnitas and barbacoa beef short-rib which they were very happy with. We skipped on dessert because none of them sounded very tempting...some sort of panna cotta  a churro type thing and I can t remember the other one. I m sure they were great given the fact that the rest of the food was so good but we passed.  Overall  it was a fantastic meal and very refreshing to not eat at another trendy  small plate tapas style  restaurant that becomes so expensive because you want to try everything or you re still hungry. We all left full and happy. We were very surprised when the bill came. We thought it would be much higher given the amount and quality of the food but we also didn t order a ton of cocktails. We ended up at a little under  100 per couple for 4 entrees  2 appetizers  and 5 drinks  3 wines  2 beers .  We love trying new restaurants in Austin  but there s only a few that we really ever want to go back to. A lot of our meals  while good  aren t super memorable but ATX Cocina is a standout.
ATX Cocina,426,I ve been here twice. Once for happy hour and once for dinner. Would recommend happy hour as a decent deal good food  but not dinner  the price is just incredibly steep for what you get   The decor ambiance is probably the best thing about the restaurant. Modern  but light filled and comfortable with lots of different rooms. The clientele has an older Westlake vibe  but I guess that is expected based on the price point.   I ve had the ATX margarita  margarita de la casa and the paloma. I ve had a lot of margaritas in my life and these were just ok. Really all were a little sweet for me and just not strong either. Really a little too steep in the price for what you get. Happy hour it is a decent deal deal--I think it is  3 off.   The appetizers small plates were generally pretty good and worth it on happy hour. The sope  empanada and tacos were very good. The fundido I felt was too small and not as flavorful as you would expect especially since it includes chorizo and toreados. The guacamole I also thought was just ok--it is hard to mess up a good avocado  and I was not blown away for  12. The salsas were just ok--the habanero was supposed to be a  9  out of  10  on heat and I guess that is the case for Westlake people and tourists  but for anyone else probably a  4 . It also included a smoked refried bean dip  that just seemed pretentious and I love refried beans. The waiters were also stingy with the corn tortillas and corn chips for the guacamole. The corn tortillas were good  but any decent taqueria in San Antonio has better handmade corn tortillas.  For the main dishes the barbacoa short rib was excellent and very flavorful. However  the artic char was just not good--the fish seemed old and was a little undercooked. For  32 it was just not worth it. Also  by 7 30 on a Saturday they were already out of the pescado a la talla. The brussel sprouts were great  but I m not sure they are worth  12--for reference on the menu online they are listed as  8 and in the short time the restaurant has been open  the price has increased to  12.  Bottom line  good for happy hour and people watching.
ATX Cocina,427,Good food. Small portions for the price. Their guacamole and chips are out of this world  though.
ATX Cocina,428,We came here during SXSW because our Uber driver recommended it. The food and service was phenomenal. The spare ribs are some of the best that I ve ever had and the brussel sprouts were to die for. I d strongly recommend this place.
ATX Cocina,429,This is probably the best Mexican food I ve ever had. Best in Texas for sure. Do not go there for crispy tacos  tostadas or queso. If this is what you look for in Mexican food you re not eating real Mexican food and this place isn t for you. If you want excellent high end chef prepared Mexican food then this is it. Try the hamachi  duck  lamb.
ATX Cocina,430,Enjoyed an unexpected family style meal with friends here recently.  We were unsure what to get so we ordered about 5 different dishes and we all shared some of each.  Food and service were good and the patio was nice with heaters.
ATX Cocina,431,The food is decent  but I wouldn t come back. We were seated 20 minutes past our reservation and dinner took over 2 hours because the kitchen was backed up. It is definitely not worth the prices they are charging. I much prefer Suerte in East Austin.
ATX Cocina,432,Hands down favorite restaurant in Austin  It s become a tradition to eat her on Christmas Eve that we look forward to every year  Protip  order all the veggie sides and share an entre  you ll be glad you did  That corn is to die for 
ATX Cocina,433,I expected more of this place  horrible service   I waited 15 minutes for a drink each time I ordered one . I had to start ordering 2 drinks at a time since the waiter would take forever to bring anything out  from drinks to additional things we ordered everything took forever to be brought to the table . How long does it take to make a drink or grab a beer from the cooler    Ridiculous . Will not be going back.
ATX Cocina,434,Extremely accommodating with our dogs on the patio  great service  and amazing drinks and food 
ATX Cocina,435,Very unique  untraditional flavors presented within traditional entrees made this a great dining experience. The place was packed on a Wednesday night but was able to sit at a two top and our server was beyond exceptional  A food allergy was mentioned and our server spoke to the chef and came back with a host of available options and alternatives. From past experience at some places  food allergies aren t taken seriously and even after being told certain items were OK - we found out later  that wasn t true. This was not the case and all suggested items were as advertised. We had the quest fundido  crazy good guac  with basil and tarragon   and house made chips  duck tacos and crab tostada. Also  a housemade pomegranate popsicle and candle for my birthday.  Lastly  glad to see Dessert Door Sotol on the beverage menu. We ll be back 
ATX Cocina,436,Came here for a birthday dinner and it surpassed all my expectations  Food was incredible- the duck dish was my favorite. Incredible service  gorgeous interior and fun atmosphere. Will absolutely be back 
ATX Cocina,437,The food is definitely on point  although a little overpriced  in my opinion. Our table had delicious guacamole  duck taco  street corn  brussel sprouts  shrimp entree  with large shrimp    and chicharron.  The margaritas were also very tasty  although we were sitting on the other side of the wall from the bar and they don t honor happy hour prices unless you re sitting at the bar  which was full.  It s a beautifully designed space with very friendly staff. I can see why this place is very trendy 
ATX Cocina,438,OK - First off I get that Austin has turned into the equivalent of a really bad-tasting smoothie comprised of cultures from San Francisco  Chicago  and Dallas.  I ve been here long enough to witness the obliteration of true Austin ethos.  If you want to witness this complete cluster chuck in motion  then run don t walk  from your laughably expensive downtown condo   and join the party at ATX Cocina.  Some group of investors dropped a  hitload of money on this place and it shows.  It s very  contemporary urban   lots of custom detail in the furnishings  bar  and certainly architecture.  The commercial kitchen equipment also appears top-notch  so good for them on that part of the score sheet.  Oddly  the staff s shirts look more suited for an Outback Steakhouse than an uber-upscale  modern Mexican  restaurant.  Kind of a blue denim   Oh well  more of a subjective observation there.  Back to the bad social culture smoothie... I suppose you could generously say that this place has interesting people watching.  Or you could say that this place is ground zero for the wannabee transients who could never really call  insert any city north of Dallas  home.  If you travel as I do  you run across places like ATX Cocina in almost every growing city.  Houston has many such as Steak 48.  What I m driving at here is that a restaurant shouldn t resemble a theme park in terms of it s patrons.  It s almost comical to watch the smorgasbord of tourists and transplants come through.  The place gets crowded and people at the bar can easily invade your space too.  The service was painfully slow.  We ordered happy hour shrimp tacos at 4 30 because the full menu isn t available until 5 pm.  The tacos arrived at 4 55 and had TWO shrimp on them each.  At a happy hour price of  10 bucks  most folks would expect better.  They tasted fine but certainly nothing extraordinary.  We were hungry by now and took the suggestion of our bartender to order the pork chop  pibil   after discussing a number of options.  This is about a  40 plate  which is high even under the best of circumstances.  But fine  we went for it and again 30 minutes later I m asking anyone in an Outback shirt if they can please go check on our order.  Out comes a huge bone-in pork chop with lots of superfluous  green sprouts on top.  It was already sliced and almost raw in the middle.  We did a good job of pretending   Mmmm  did you taste the cooked edge   .  The seasoning on the chop was very good but damn if I m eating under-cooked pork.  I sent it back for more heat and it returned 10 minutes later dry and tough.  The drinks we had at the bar were very good but ridiculously over-priced for happy hour.  Again  another malignant symptom of the cancer that infested downtown Austin.  In conclusion  if you are new to town  feel lost socially  don t really have an understanding of fine cuisine but justify it by paying inflated prices  this is the place for you.  Welcome to Austin 
ATX Cocina,439,Flew in  from Detroit with six other friends and it s my first time in Texas. I ve been on a spicy margarita kick. I ve order a few since arriving and I didn t take three drinks of them. If it weren t for this place I may have never found what I was looking for. We re coming back for dinner for a buddy s bday. Thanks for highly satisfying my crave. SARAH is the bartender to see
ATX Cocina,440,Excellent  excellent  excellent. Heard this place was great and was not disappointed. The guacamole  hamachi  short rib  and pequeno lorenzo are must tries. We also had stellar service. I will definitely be back 
ATX Cocina,441,Ambience and decor are out of sight  delicious dishes ... just slightly overpriced and ginormous portions 
ATX Cocina,442,The space is gorgeous  the acoustics are horrible.  You will be shouting at your dining companions if you want to have a conversation. The AC was having trouble keeping the space cool  there was actually a box fan positioned next to our table.  The House Margarita and Paloma cocktails were  meh  quality- 12 a drink  and not buzzworthy.  We ordered the  12 guacamole  because we wanted to know what  12 guacamole tasted like.  It was good  the avocados were perfectly ripe and there was a nice hit of lime and serrano. Came with two enormous chips  but could have used more.  It was a very large portion  too much for just two people  maybe they can offer a smaller portion for less      We also had the shrimp sopas  which were our favorite thing. The sweetness of the corn worked really well.  Also had the crab tostada.  The base was another of the enormous chips  and the crab and tomato were quite rich and tasty  but we bit into 3 separate whole black peppercorns while eating.  I m down with fresh pepper  but whole peppercorns really blow one s palate.  A couple days later and my food memory is peppercorn  lime  serrano.  So we had 4 drinks and 3 appetizers total  and our check was  98 before tax and tip. I m not averse to big dining bills  but I want to feel like the money goes for the food  not the interior design.  On the plus side  the staff was very friendly and our server did a great job.   ATX Cocina is very much a  scene  kind of place-it felt more Miami Beach than Austin.  I m sure they ll do fine with all the cool young things coming in to see and be seen  but I don t think I ll be back.
ATX Cocina,443,Great location  gorgeous interior  good service.  The drinks and food were fabulous... with one exception.  The restaurant does a  modern interpretation  of chips  served w  guacamole  which is delish  and an awesome tomatillo salsa  and we did not love this.  Special non-GMO corn from Mexico seems to be a signature for the restaurant  but the corn tortillas served with salsas as a starter were just Ok  not great  in my opinion.  And I wasn t a fan of the modern interpretation of chips  some were too crunchy  some tasted quite bland  which was off-putting .  By contrast  the chips that we had at Takoba yesterday  crunchy  fresh  traditional corn chips  were awesome.  ATX Cocina is a good spot though... the fish tacos were amazing and margaritas   yum 
ATX Cocina,444,I m not normally a fan of upscale Mexican food  but I LOVE every other restaurant by these owners  so I had to try it.  And I am so glad I did.  The space is gorgeous  clean and contemporary while somehow not being obnoxiously loud.  We were able to have a quiet conversation in a packed restaurant on a Saturday night.  And we didn t feel like we were right on top of our neighbors.  The service was great.  Attentive without hovering.  But the important part is the food.  The food is fabulous.  We tried the house margs  which were very good.  The Queso fundido was some of the best I ve had.  And those tortillas   They are out of this world    We next had the drunken snapper which was fresh and flavorful and beautiful to behold.  And for our entree we had the short rib  again with those tortillas.  Everything was fabulous.  The price is a little high for the portion size  but I d be willing to pay it again and look forward to trying more of the menu.
ATX Cocina,445,This place is simply awesome     The food is great   The happy hour prices are every reasonable. However if I wanted to complain about anything it would be the waiters  they are very pretentious   
ATX Cocina,446,There are several places in Austin to have excellent Mexican food and we didn t feel this was one of them. The question fundido was too thick  the crab tostadas had so much spice to it that you couldn t taste the crab at all and the burrata with tomatoes didn t provide enough tomatoes to go with the cheese. The drinks were ok  but for the price there are several other places in town that are better and more conducive to conversation.
ATX Cocina,447,Food is great  close to home  really nicely designed space.  Only gets a 3 because one can barely hear themselves.  An acoustical nightmare
ATX Cocina,448,Came here last Sunday night with a friend. The space is very posh and inviting. Friendly staff and the bartender made me a great watermelon marg  I honestly want to give the place 4-5 stars  but the proportions relative to price were very disappointing. One order of small tacos was  15 and one crab tostada was  19. My friend I was entertaining left still hungry. I think this place can gain repeat customers become competitive in this market if prices come down. I have friends that live in the condos above that have commented on the price point as well.
ATX Cocina,449,Food 4.5 stars Service 2.5 stars  Food  tortillas  salsas  guac  queso  entrees  etc.  were great.   Drinks were good.   Service kitchen was slow  uninformed  and confused.    Had a large party and got to sample most of the menu but it took more than 3 hours from start finish to do so with plenty of inattentive staff in blue jean shirts working.  Restaurant vibe was not  ATX  but rather SF  NY  or some other large urban center with wealthy  attractive hipsters professionals in modern setting.  Can see why that make some love it and some hate it.    If you want some good high-end modern  Mexican Tex Mex  you will love it.  Food was better than La Condesa.  if you want value  service  speed  or an  Austin  place  probably not for you.
ATX Cocina,450,If you haven t eaten at ATX Cocina yet you need to go as soon as you are able to get a reservation. Weather you order the lamb shank  short ribs or the duck fajitas you will savor every bite. The hamachi crudo is probably the best dish I ve ever eaten.
ATX Cocina,451,The food and ambience at ATC Cocina is simply wonderful. First the service. The hostess was friendly  the bartender was incredibly warm and engages and our server was superb. The food was a surprise and simply delightful. I would highly recommend ATX and will be back in the near future  Thanks for a wonderful evening 
ATX Cocina,452,The food was good here and ambiance was excellent. The dishes were little overpriced but worth the place and atmoshphere. We tried fish crudo appetizers  guacamole  plato s tacos brussels sprout and they were all great.
ATX Cocina,453,I can say  this is a great Happy Hour place  to hang out with good company but coming here for dinner  I will take off one star because the menu selection is not that attractive.  I will come back for Happy Hour but not for dinner.  We have too many place In ATX for dinner competition.
ATX Cocina,454,We were hoping to find another regular dinner or happy hour spot since we live close by. The food was average  and the prices were too high for the offerings  the service was subpar  and the entire experience just felt like they thought much too much of themselves. We might try again after they ve settled in but for now  we won t be their guinea pigs.
ATX Cocina,455,This place is amazing  We tried several things on the menu... duck carnitas  grilled octopus  hamachi  All very flavorful  Their house margaritas we awesome too  We will be back 
ATX Cocina,456,Great food. If you feel it s a bit expensive  Don t. You get quality food  especially when comparing to surrounding restaurants. Happy hour is awesome with more economical prices. The only quibble is the pretentious atmosphere.
ATX Cocina,457,We had a great meal  the cesar salad is the best I ve had our server Ronnie was great  highly recommend
ATX Cocina,458,Excellent    Delish crudo dishes - think the best ceviche ever but more with a sashimi angle and the lamb and beef ribs were absolutely delish  I had the best tequila ever there and have to go back because I can t remember the name...thanks to our waitress Katie s  recommendation  who by the way was absolutely fabulous    The food did take a little long but the atmosphere and drinks were fun so hardly noticed.  Highly recommend and can t wait to return 
ATX Cocina,459,Very good Mexican restaurant. Excellent Margaritas. The vibe and decor are very cool. My biggest complaint would be the heat level on some of the dishes. I like spicy food  but one dish in particular was way too hot and it should not have been  according to the waitress . It was a crab kind of dip that was served cold.. Very flavorful  but far too spicy. Also did not care for the Tortilla chips. They are homemade  but I would prefer more traditional chips. The guacamole was only average. The beef short rib entree was very good  I would definitely go back and try some different dishes.
ATX Cocina,460,One of the best meals that I have had.  The service and ambience were amazing.  Every single course and drink we had was phenomenal.  Definitely have at least one type of crudo  we had the snapper followed by the burrata where the passilla verde tied the entire dish together with the smokiness of the mezcal.  Last but not least the chili roasted chicken with the white mole with a side order of the esquires  you have to order this  could not be surpassed.  I m only here for a few days  but I am definitely going back.
ATX Cocina,461,Great food service and ambiance  We got the The server was very nice and informative 
ATX Cocina,462,I ve been twice. Fist experience was wonderful. Great service and food. Cochinita pibil had good flavor and salsa sampler was awesome. Second visit was not similar. They said they re were no tables so sat at bar.  Tables were open entire time til we left  Still had good service at the bar at least. The tinga did not taste like tinga. Cochinita pibil flavor was off and very greasy.  Salsa sampler was not the same and lacking.  was hoping for another central Mexican restaurant in Austin. Not sure if chefs changed but this was difference of a few months.
ATX Cocina,463,Very big fan of this place  it feels like it has taken the place of La Codesa as the interesting  upscale restaurant of choice in Austin  especially as La Condesa seems to have lost something . White Mole Chicken is awesome  sashimi and apps are also excellent. Very good cocktails as well.
ATX Cocina,464,Excellent hang out with a modern twist on Mexican   Latin infusion cuisine. Appetizers entrees and drinks are top notch. Great ambiance as well. It was a welcome surprise after the disappointing dinner y Sway from night before. This is now a fav in Austin.
ATX Cocina,465,Wow is really all I can say. I am speechless  in a good way  about the whole dining experience. The waitstaff were friendly and super helpful about the menu. Everything in the restaurant is gluten free which is amazing for those in your life that have gluten allergies. If you want an upscale Mexican cuisine experience this is the place to go. The guacamole and beef tartare were so fresh. I had the lamb with such amazing spices. I just wanted to stay there and eat everything off the menu. This is a must go to when visiting Austin 
ATX Cocina,466,Awesome scene  First and foremost  portion size was pretty good. I was with 3 other guys and we re all above average size and have a huge appetite. We order the chicken that was for two  a steak and two appetizers and we were stuffed  Anyways  when you walk in you re instantly excited to sit down and read the menu. Their margaritas were full of flavor  the salsa was perfect and the food was amazing  Our waitress Jamie was great  She is very professional  polite  came over to the table the perfect amount of times  and had a beautiful smile  Would recommend this place and if you re a fan of tuna I d recommend the tuna taco  
ATX Cocina,467,I have completely fallen in love with this place everything I have tried is delicious. I recommend this place to everybody you will not be disappointed
ATX Cocina,468,Just okay.. Wasn t blown away by the food. Disappointed by the small portions that were overpriced.
ATX Cocina,469,Brand new spot with absolutely gorgeous interior. It s my new fav spot for upscale Mexican food. I highly recommend ordering the tuna tostada and the little Larry cocktail  which is a smokey change from a typical margarita. This place is a bit expensive  but great for a special occasion.
ATX Cocina,470,top 5 in austin. amazing drinks. amazing food. highly recommend the carne asada  atun  halibut if they have it  and empanadas. corn is also amazing. haven t had a flavor i didn t like. service is meh but youll be extremely satisfied with everything else.
ATX Cocina,471,We stumbled into this place at 4 45 pm on a Saturday not knowing what to expect. We sat at the bar and were pleasantly surprised that they had happy hour. I had the spicy house margarita which was the best I ve had. The guacamole was delicious. The tortilla chips are not traditional. Modern spin on the tortilla chips  but still delicious. We didn t love the salsa tasting  only one of the salsa was good  and it was served with soft blue tortillas instead of the chips which would have been easier for scooping and eating the salsa with. The Caesar salad  not on the happy hour menu  was so  so good. And the chicken Tinga tacos were perfect. All with a lovely view. We will be back when I m Austin  
ATX Cocina,472,Very good place  I love the atmosphere of this place  One of us had the fish  The employees are really nice at ATX Cocina 
ATX Cocina,473,If the food wasn t so good I would not have given this place even two stars. Let me start with the food - delicious  Interesting  unique and flavorful. That said I didnt go out to dinner alone. I went with friends to enjoy a nice relaxing evening out  and share time  discussion  opinions with people I enjoy. There were only four of us and we could not hear a word said from across the table. The acoustics in this room were clearly intentionally poor making conversation virtually impossible.The waiter took great pains and effort in describing  some highlights of the menu but we heard nothing. He also was soooo pretentious and overbearing in his unnecessarily long and detailed explanation that we were actually happy we couldn t hear it anyway. All in all the evening was not relaxing it was uncomfortable and oh yeah.... expensive.
ATX Cocina,474,Yum  Such good food here. Loved the corn and the steak. Nice place to bring the parents to pay for a meal   Just opened so needs to work out some kinks in their staffing and service but  overall really great stuff  Can t wait to come back and try that watermelon drink
ATX Cocina,475,From beginning to end  this was one of the best meals I have ever had.  The sopa  which was especially prepared vegetarian for me  was an extraordinary combination of sweet  earthy and tangy.  I don t think I have ever tried anything quite like it before.  Great service  too.
ATX Cocina,476,Great atmosphere  Guacamole  tuna tostada and carne Asada were amazing  Definitely my go to place for Mexican food when I visit Austin  Cheers to Chef KT 
ATX Cocina,477,Combination of excellent service and amazing food made for an amazing evening.  We had a party of eleven and everyone tried something different and everything was so good.  But the two must orders in my opinion are the Pork Tomahawk and the brussel sprouts  Both were simply the best   We will definitely be coming back to this place..
ATX Cocina,478,awesome night recently while sitting at the bar.  Didn t want to wait for a table but there s lots of room and great sitting in the bar. Ordered a phenomenal margarita  Caesar salad  large enough for 2 and prawns. Friends had beers and chicken  short ribs. Everyone reported 5 stars.
ATX Cocina,479,Worth the splurge - everything was delicious  including the Brussel Sprouts and the Beets  . Waiter was very helpful managing the timing of food and how much to order for our group of 6 since we were sharing dishes.
ATX Cocina,480,Delicious food  well educated staff and great cocktails   I had the pleasure of dining here their opening night and my friend and I were wowed- we had great service  thank you Brandon  and were immediately left speechless at the design of the concept and his knowledge of the menu and ingredients.  The experience was memorable and relaxed  as if this restaurant has been open for years and it was only their opening night   If you are visiting or like myself have lived here in austin several years  this is something you need to experience asap 
ATX Cocina,481,Britney took care of us the other night and I must say the service was phenomenal probably the best I ve ever had in the city  her personality was second to none and her energy level was so great she gave up such good positive vibrations. Not to mention she is quite beautiful. The food was amazing and the restaurant itself is beautiful  we enjoyed every bit of it and would love to come back again to see Britney and enjoy the delicious cuisine at ATX Cocina
ATX Cocina,482,Good quality food  unique menu items. Not many options for Vegetarian though. Only starters and salad. at-least couple of Entree options would have made our Dinner date worth the evening.
ATX Cocina,483,First time here and definitely we will come back food AMAZING.. drinks AMAZING.. restaurant SUPER CLEAN .. bartenders VERY FRIENDLY.. what else you can ask came and try it you won t regret it   
ATX Cocina,484,Food and drinks were good and interesting.  Music was hideous  I dont want to eat dinner to AC DC
ATX Cocina,485,Truly excellent food with an entirely gluten free kitchen.  Decor and atmosphere is great  giving the restaurant a refined  fun feel. Our party was very pleased overall  but felt that the service wasn t on par with the kitchen.
ATX Cocina,486,My friends and I have now eaten at this restaurant four times and all 4 nights  it was exceptional. The cocktails are delicious  the margaritas taste like the authentic ones I have when in Mexico. The food is delicious and just keeps us coming back. Taylor  has been our server the last two or three times we visited and she couldn t be more attentive and friendly. Love this restaurant and even in the Austin summer heat  this cuisine and it s preparation  blow our minds and taste buds 
ATX Cocina,487,Stopped by for a small birthday dinner. They have happy hour from 4 30-6 30 for drinks and some menu items. The waiter was super nice and made sure we had everything we needed throughout dinner. I would recommend getting the queso fondido and guacamole. And for dinner we ordered the  el Jefe  and pork dinner. Make sure you are ready share. So amazing and sooo much food. Overall I had a great dinner  and I will definitely stop by again.
ATX Cocina,488,Fresh  flavorful Tex Mex  I was invited to this restaurant for a business dinner and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. For appetizers we had the pork sopas. I heard the pork was marinated for 12 hours and it shows. For the entree the beef was my favorite. It was tender and well cooked you could eat it with a spoon. Last  but certainly not least  the guacamole is a must. Our group loved the little chuncha of avocado and the thin slices of jalape os.  The service we received was equally excellent. I have a food allergy and they took great care of me. Our waitress Reagan was the best I ve had in a long time. She was so attentive and proactive.   When you re in Austin  I highly recommend it.
ATX Cocina,489,The food here is aMAZing   The flavors are fresh and leave you with such a clean palate. Their version of the pink Cadillac margarita is DELICIOUS    Inside scoop - the off menu tacos are a tour de force. Fresh all the way through. Not to be missed    The guac is fresh and their chips are non traditional and delicious. They bring in fresh produce from Mexico so this place is the real deal.  The staff are so warm and friendly and inviting. Made us feel right at home. Attentive but in no way hovering. We re here for a conference for 4 days and we will likely revisit here before we head home.
ATX Cocina,490,AMAZING food and service. Highly recommend the shrimp or the chicken. House margaritas are great as well.
ATX Cocina,491,Excellent   Sorely needed high end dining.  You can get dressed up to come here - modern beautiful space.  The short rib  Caesar salad  mole chicken and brussel sprouts were noteworthy.  A lot of the food had a  kick  - very impressed at the quality.  This is going to be downtown s new hot spot - more of this please  
ATX Cocina,492,We came here for happy hour a few weeks ago and were blown away by the atmosphere  quality of drinks and delicious food. The service at that time was sub-par  but we figured it was because it was around the dinner service had opened.   We made reservations to return for my husbands 41st birthday tonight. The service was terrible and so was the food. I couldn t even finish my meal. The ceaser salad has so much lemon on it that I will probably have heart burn for days. The definite thing is that I will be having nightmares over a great dinner gone bad.
ATX Cocina,493,I thought this place was great. We came here before a show at Moody on  accidentally  National Margarita Day 2018. Sat down right away at the bar. We had the house margaritas. Drinks were great. For food  we ordered the heirloom corn tortillas  amp  salsa tasting. Great deal for  5. Shared the carne asada. Waiter was attentive despite large crowd. Flavors were surprisingly complex. Overall experience was great   
ATX Cocina,494,I wanted to love this place because who doesn t love upscale Mexican  but I was underwhelmed. The margaritas were average  the guacamole was average  my fish was over cooked  and the service was poor.  Needless to say it was not the upscale experience I had hoped for .  The highlight for me was the trio of salsas and that was it. The interior is beautiful  so I would only suggest to go for a beer and a salsa snack. Otherwise I would say spend your money elsewhere.
ATX Cocina,495,Gotta try their spicy margarita  it s wonderful    Their food and service is always great.... love this place  
ATX Cocina,496,This is by far at the top of my list of best restaurants in Austin.  Interesting and delicious food without prevention.  The seafood options are just as good as the meat   Great drink menu too.  Highly recommend for a nice dinner out   Great for groups as plates are shareable.
ATX Cocina,497,The drinks are wonderful  fun atmosphere  but loud  food is good  although a little pricey.  The downside was a reservation that wasn t honored for over 30 minutes and then we were seated in the bar area.  Hostess kept telling us to get a drink at the bar while we waited and we felt the right thing to do would have been to provide a drink or something on the house.
ATX Cocina,498,What a lovely restaurant with fantastic service and uniquely delicious food  amp  drinks   I would highly recommend this new and beautifully created restaurant with a warm  yet open atmosphere.  So well done on all fronts.  SPECIAL THANKS to Brandon  Reagan  and Tim for making my birthday with my loving friends  one of the most memorable  filled with laughter and pleasure to the senses    Note  Be sure to do valet on the Southbound side of San Antonio street for easy access 
ATX Cocina,499,They are trying way too hard. Not enough gluten for Mexican food. No flour tortillas  no gluten   no chips with  6 salsa. Food was alright but ended up being  300 for 5 people  everyone splitting an entree  as well as 6 drinks at  14 each. The green salsa was good everything else was meh. A thin flank steak  carne asada  was 40  with no sides on the plate. I would say conservatively that prices here are 4X more than the food and drink are worth. Will not be back.
ATX Cocina,500,Great outdoor patio. Nice indoor decor. Server was nice but not attentive  failed to be around for last call at HH  hence the star deduction . Food was really fresh and authentic. The guacamole was outstanding. We did the HH tacos  chicken and pork. Two per order. Great   The drinks we re amazing. Christmas in a jar and the margaritas are a reason to come back.
Hula Hut,1,Enthusiastic and attentive service and great food. Chicken quesadilla and shrimp enchiladas were delish     Only four stars because the place  especially bathrooms  could use some maintenance and a good clean.
Hula Hut,2,Quite literally  rats in the kitchen.   As we were eating my bf noticed a rat scurrying. We informed the waiter and someone came to smack down the rodent with a broom in attempt to get it to run out of the side door but it bolted into the kitchen instead. Another waiter mentioned how exterminators were just there not long ago.
Hula Hut,3,This place has great atmosphere and location. Parking can be a bit of a hassle but I ve never had issues. Food is good but not great. Drinks are about average price for Austin. But let s be real you come here for the water front patio vibes which it knocks out the park.   Photos  Patio bar on the water.  Wife with a skinny Marg.
Hula Hut,4,I always enjoying bringing my family here when they come to town. Great location by the water. The salsa is spicy and delicious with a tropical spin and only topped by the amazing jalape o ranch. Pay the 75  and order it   Although the chips and dips are satisfying enough  the veggie tubular taco and veggie enchiladas are great. For the first time we ordered dessert  a key lime pie with an almond coconut crust. Oh the crust...I just want to have a plate of that  They do not skimp on the portion size. After having our entr es  the three of us struggled to finish the piece of pie. We left stuffed  like always. And we have leftovers for today.   
Hula Hut,5,We went here this afternoon after not going here in 10 years and it was worth the trip. We live in southwest Austin and just normally don t go to that are.  Only a few people were at hula hut do we were seated quickly and waited on and had the platter of ribs  chicken soft tacos  nachos  fried potatoes  salad  queso  guacamole  chicken tacos and fried potatoes. Everything is tasty warm and good flavor. The platter had a sample of everything.  If you haven t been it is right on the lake and a great experience
Hula Hut,6,It s almost silly for me to even post a review because this place is a Austin landmark. Seated right on Lake Austin this very busy always crowded restaurant has a great view. It  was as hot as a tin roof outside so we sat inside but when it s cool the outside is a great place to enjoy the food and views. Because it s busy the wait staff can be running crazy so order extra chips when they drop the first basket off at the table.  Same with the drinks of applicable . Hawaiian flare to TrxMex  Whoever thought of this is genius and  deserves some kind award.  The fajitas with shrimp and pineapple  yes please   Wait staff a little busy but got the job done and the margarita s were yum. Do t let the crowds scare you away. It goes fast and enjoy a cold beverage while you wait. Take a selfie with the big  ol fish in the water. Have fun 
Hula Hut,7,Enjoyed a nice lunch outside on their patio. Complimentary chips and salsa were served.   Convenient QR code on each table to view the menu.  I opted to try out their Fried Fish Taco plate and it came out delicious  The fish was perfectly cooked  it also came with a side of rice and beans which I enjoyed as well.  Our server was very attentive  the overall environment was very nice. I would definitely come back 
Hula Hut,8,Cute atmosphere  decent drinks  and acceptable service.. but the food can be a little hit or miss.  They have updated the menu to identify vegetarian items  which is very helpful. Even though their online FAQ says the queso is not veg  they have changed that  so that s excellent news. They do give free chips and salsa  and the salsa is pretty good  so there is that. They also have added a jalape o ranch like chuy s. And there are great happy hour deals.  I like sitting outside on the tiki bar over the water. It is a cute place for occasional meetups or to take out of town guests. Don t come expecting a culinary delight  but you will still have a good time.
Hula Hut,9,Hula Hut is an Austin legend and deservedly so. Situated on the shore overlooking Lake Austin  It s my favorite outdoor location for a drink or a meal. The laid-back atmosphere is agreeable and the folks here do not take themselves too seriously. The menu is self-described as  Mexican food with a surfer twist  and that s pretty accurate  with apps and entrees well-suited for a drinking establishment. I love that I can get a burger cooked the way I want  medium rare  without a lecture. Relaxing with a cocktail and enjoying the waterside breezes are unexpected but appreciated pleasures for a newcomer to central Texas. Recommended.
Hula Hut,10,It is clear that people come for the views and not the service. The menus and and table were filthy. We were not given menus right away and had to wait a while for silverware.  The food is okay. My husband liked the crispy fish taco and I enjoyed my grilled fish taco. The refried beans were fantastic  Some of the best I have tasted. My daughter did not like the Caesar salad  which was not a Caesar salad at all  but thought the quesadilla was okay.  Food was okay but it was clear that they are very understaffed and overwhelmed.
Hula Hut,11,Hula Hut- if you haven t been here on Lake Austin  I don t know where you ve been. Here and neighboring Mozart s Coffee are iconic spots in Austin. Got the shrimp chile relleno and I d get it again. The queso is tasty too. No margs this time but next time.
Hula Hut,12,The food is not the best  unfortunately I enjoy the area and how you can see a little bit of the lake but overall basic. The food is not good  very bland and the self service chip bar on the patio made me a little uneasy since lots of folks are not constantly washing their hands and uphold good hygiene practices. Since the ambiance was what I like to come for this prolly will be another spot I just go to and have drinks but no food.
Hula Hut,13,Worth checking out this place for the view of the lake and the Hawaiian chill ambiance  especially during sunsets.   Food-wise  the restaurant is average. The best item on their menu is the stuffed avocado and the guacamole. The stuffed avocado is very unique because it is fried on the outside and stuffed with creamy flavorful chicken on the inside. The restaurant also gives you complimentary chips and spicy tasty salsa. I recommend ordering their guacamole  it is chunky  flavorful  and has mango salsa in it.   The restaurant staff is super friendly  but just know that it is always packed  service is not fast  not the cleanest of places  and waiting for tables can be long as 15-30 minutes  especially in the evenings.
Hula Hut,14,Dropped by yesterday to celebrate my husband s birthday  while the vibes were great we had to wait around 45 minutes to get a table  Didn t think it d take so long on a Monday evening so beware of that before visiting and no they don t take reservations in advance. However we could hang around the restaurant while we waited since it s pretty big and they ve got a huge outdoor space on the water  AMAZING sunset views. I loved the location and will be returning just for that    They give you complimentary tortilla chips and salsa  we ordered some queso and inhaled it all before taking any great pictures  The fish sandwich we got was also delicious  we got blackened fish and next time I d try it fried. The white sauce ranch that came with the fries was absolutely addicting.  Service was quite slow  but our server was nice and kept our dietary restrictions in mind.
Hula Hut,15,Decided to check this out for dinner while in town for a business trip. Upon arrival you get chips and salsa which had a decent kick. We were told after sitting down waiting on menus that there was a QR code that they covered with The chip basket.  I had the Diamond head noodle salad. It came with the sauce on the side which was good. I wasn t a fan of the grilled shrimp which was cold from the moment I got it. Expected that to be warm for being grilled. My husband had the Hawaiian fajitas which was different. However it was good. Great sauce.  The server was nice but it was hard to get his attention. We had to flag him down basically every time we needed something. Glad that the checking out process went well thanks to the mobile check out.
Hula Hut,16,Today we had lunch at Hula But. It was good. We opted to sit outside and watch the boats coming and going. There was a nice wind which made eating outside tolerable. We saw some turtles and fish. Our service was good and so was the food. My husband and I shared their roasted chicken pipeline enchilada. The picture I m uploading is half the plate as they were kind enough to split them for us. We still had leftovers  if you can believe that. They give you salsa and chips  for starters. Their salsa was spicy but good. They were busy today. We had a 30-minute wait.
Hula Hut,17,Let me start by saying this place is way over rated. The food not that great had a beachy vibe that serves tex mex. Look I m gonna be honest I expected this place to be way better than what it was. The food was mediocre at best.  But the main reason why I m giving this place a 2 star is the service. One of the worst I have ever had. Our host was alright friendly but just seemed overwhelmed. So the being genuine was out. We finally got sat after about a 35 minute wait. Then we get this server who... ohhh boy... was so high sprung and did not care at all. Our party was enjoying themselves laughing and he came up twice asking ate you Donna order drinks. When our party finally said yes he asked what drinks we gave him the order he asked for ID and walked away with them. He did not come back with our ID for about 5 minutes in the meantime we saw him walking around taking other tables there orders. He comes back to our table gives us back the ID with no drinks. What... makes no sense.  He then asked my wife for her ID as she was not at the table when this happened and she presents her military ID Badge. He attempts to take this as well. Thats when when got a bit upset letting him know  that can not be taken with you. He said he had to take it a run it in there system. Have you never seen a military ID  I asked. No care or consideration just  its just an ID and I need to take it to my manager. I ve seen plenty of them . I m thinking obviously not. He cones back with a big attitude and asked if there is tension at the table and refuses to serve us. Gets another server.  That s when the mood changed and our new server was attentive helpfull and suggested there signature drinks and had good customer service overall.  My suggestion don t go here when they are busy and be aware of the server. Some just don t care and I feel your just another table that s it.
Hula Hut,18,One of my favorite places to go when in in Austin..feels like your in Hawaii on the water..the views are spectacular...nothing more relaxing than sipping margaritas in the sun on the water just a few minutes from town. It s our very first stop when in town.  The margaritas are awesome.  The food also awesome.  No distracting tvs every where...my very favorite appetizer on the menu are the shrimp flautas.  Shrimp  cheese  jalape os wrapped in a wonton and fried..served with an amazing sauce. You can t find these anywhere they are so good. We visit at least 3 times when in town.  The staff are always great and welcoming.  You definitely won t be disappointed...can t be stressed when you come here. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.
Hula Hut,19,I had the best lunch hour at this location. Out server olive gave us great service. She was quick and had our check ready for us to go  with our time crunch at lunch hour. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a lunch spot nearby with beautiful views of the water.
Hula Hut,20,If I could give Hula Hut a 10-star review  I would. This is easily our new favorite spot in Austin. It overlooks Lake Austin and the view is gorgeous. I especially loved the Hawaiian island vibe aesthetic. My husband  10-year-old son and I enjoyed the atmosphere  food and service. Our server  Ian  was phenomenal and incredibly friendly. Try their Hawaiian fajita or chicken chile relleno. We ll definitely be back 
Hula Hut,21,Food ok  heavy on cheese and jalape os on the nachos  salsa was excellent. The view of the lake and boats makes the experience 
Hula Hut,22,Ok haven t been in many years and am pleasantly surprised by how good the food is. The scenery is obviously very nice being on the lake and seeing all the fish turtles birds. The shaded patio has plenty of fans to beat the heat. Wait times can be long but I recently I went for July 4 and was seated immediately. Further  they have a chips and fresh salsa bar to ruin your appetite while you wait. The portion sizes are HUGE. I really like the shrimp enchiladas and found the shrimp to be cooked nicely. Very cheesy dish. Service is friendly. Their mixed drinks are pretty tasty and strong. Obviously not a healthy meal but really good and great place to come with a group 
Hula Hut,23,Had an awesome time at hula hut on the water. All staff were friendly and the ambiance was exquisite. I definitely recommend stopping by for a casual lunch or dinner out. We sat outside even though it was certainly hot but the pier seating area had shade  fans and an accompanying breeze. We went for drinks and appetizers but the food around us looked good as well  I feel that I should also mention that this place is massive  We went around lunch time so it was definitely below 50  occupancy but there was so much room  I d guess you could go at dinner rush and there would still be seats available without having to wait a long time 
Hula Hut,24,Idk it s really giving Carribean Tex-mex Red Robin. Everything was kind of dirty and rundown  food wasn t great  but it did have good view if you sat outside.
Hula Hut,25,We decided to come here for the pi a colada  we got back from our honeymoon and my husband was really craving one. They had the best suggestions for them in Austin. Parking is a little difficult  but luckily we found a spot on the street. They do have valet as well in the area  not sure how much it is though. I love that this is off of the water  perfect summer spot to cool down. We definitely want to eat here in the future  but just the location and ambience of it all was enough to give it a five star. We can t wait to come back and grab a couple more drinks  and some food 
Hula Hut,26,The servers were really nice. I had the chicken Chile relleno and it was pretty good. I reallyed enjoyed the mango salsa that was on top. The complimentary chips and salsa were nice. That salsa was a bit spicy  so might be too spicy for other people. The portion was big enough for me to have leftovers. Their regular drinks like soda and water were pretty large. Both of my friends enjoyed their meals and had leftovers.
Hula Hut,27,Best food  environment  and service in Austin   10 10 recommend for any locals or tourists. Love this place 
Hula Hut,28,Heard great reviews of this place. Location wise this has one of the best views of the river. Parking though can be a pain if it s packed  which it was for me when I came on a Friday afternoon   Along that same thread  I didn t actually sit in the restaurant because it was so packed. So I ended up ordering something to go and sitting at one of the tables outside the restaurant that was overlooking the water.  Food was great though  would love to try the tacos next time  when it s not so busy 
Hula Hut,29,We liked the chips and queso  not the salsa which is self-served outside. We liked the platter which serves like four.  We like the pina colada and cucumber mule. The one who parks the cars did not know how to drive manua  Parking is small but theres parking across the street.
Hula Hut,30,5 stars means the place was extraordinary.  4 stars means it was pretty good.  3 means it s about average.  Which is why I m leaving the 3 stars. The stuffed avocado was decent  but the place feels a little dirty. I sat on the patio one Sunday afternoon and it felt like the bar top hadn t been wiped down in days and the bar itself looked disheveled.   If you can look past the cleanliness  then this place is pretty unique and definitely has a Hawaiian-ish vibe.
Hula Hut,31,Oooh So good  First time here  while visiting family  and I highly recommend   The service was amazing. And the food was delicious. Our server made sure to let us know that if we needed to move in case it rain  she would have an area available. And when it did  she was very helpful. She gave quick service. We got plenty of leftovers too  10 10 would visit again 
Hula Hut,32,We went for an early lunch. Found a parking place. Amazing service and food.   I can t wait to go back again. This is the place I take out of town folk. Great menu. On lake Austin near downtown.
Hula Hut,33,Service was pretty slow and overall seemed unsanitary out on the pier bar. Something that really grabbed my attention is when I saw two employees standing up against the bar.  One passed another a baggy containing a white substance    Employees vaping while serving and customers grabbing their own limes off of the bar top.  10 10 don t recommend  will never be back 
Hula Hut,34,Hula Hut offers indoor  deck  and covered outdoor dining. With all the seats they offer  you would think they would have a better handle on organization  however  it s a bit of a rodeo.... NOTE  deck dining does NOT require a wait list  it s first come  first serve. All other dining options  you must either book inside or out at the hostess stands.  amp  what the other seating is next to Hula Hut  someone please educate me because I m just as confused with that one...  Service  not the fastest  which wasn t a surprise. Food  just as much of a disappointment. Hula Hut claims themselves as  Mexican Food with a Hawaiian Twist   but honestly this was more Tex-Mex... and that s being polite.   We ordered the BBQ Baby Back Ribs  the Chicken Flautas  and the Guacamole Salad. The Baby Back Ribs were overly salty  the Flautas too fried  and the Guacamole underwhelming.
Hula Hut,35,A delightful Austin classic that isn t just for tourists  you know. Follow my lead  Order the Hawaiian fajitas for one  but have them substitute a half rack of baby back ribs for the protein. Throw some plum sauce on those bad boys and sail away. Solid mai tais. Ian is a great server  request him if you can.
Hula Hut,36,Hula Hut was the place you brought your visiting relatives to back in my college days  circa 1999-2003. You see  we weren t the foodie town we are today and so I could take my Mexican-born parents to see the water  experience the Austin my bartender money could afford and not be ashamed of the enchiladas on the menu.  A lot has changed for many of us in Austin over the years but it seems not much has with Hula Hut.   The location is still prime  the staff still really nice and attentive  doing the best they can  as we all are.  But I just can t get over the fact that  in a town with so much kitchen talent and all the culinary creativity  this is what they trot out.  The food wasn t bad  it was...ok  at best. It was weird that I got black beans when I asked for charro beans  and was told that was an option  but  I digress. I wasn t disappointed because  oddly enough  this is what I expected.  I still recommend this place because there s a cool experience to be had  eating on the water  seeing the lights of the houses none of us will ever be able to afford. The margaritas were always good and  with the right friends  you can still have a fun time.  I just wish they d up their food game. Bring in a young chef with fresh ideas and let them go wild.   We re all pulling for you  Hula Hut 
Hula Hut,37,It s on the lake and the food is good... the dusty Hawaiian decor  Aloha Y all once was alive at this restaurant. The host sent us to the back host because we wanted to sit outside. It was a 30 minute wait  no wait inside. The front host and back host should be in communication so they are able to seat more effectively. The server was horribly oversat and the crowd was growing. We did get our food with an air conditioned view of the lake and it was good. The kawakini appetizer is awesome- get the queso too. The salsa is raw and amazing- chips are good get salt. The chicken quesadillas were good and kids chicken fingers with fries worked out fine for my little one. They need more servers  communication  and the aloha back in the people.
Hula Hut,38,Came for a drink in the afternoon.  We sat on the back patio hut at the bar.  Coco was our bar tender and she was awesome     I had a margarita that was yummy  but they were out of jalape o stuffed olives which was a bummer.  Definitely a fun place to hang.  The food all looks great that was coming out  but we had already eaten lunch....
Hula Hut,39,My friend had been raving about this place for months and she finally took me there for lunch last week. This is one of my new favorite  not so hidden because there s always a wait  gems of Austin and did not disappoint    Atmosphere  first  it was way larger than it looks from the outside. They have both indoor and outdoor seating but recommend sitting outdoors so you can have an unobstructed view of Lake Austin and daydream about one day owning a boat.   Food  We shared the queso  which was incredible  but for me the show stopper was the table chips  They were warm  thin and crispy - not too heavy but held up when dipped in salsa or cheese. We each got a different quesadilla  chicken pictured here  and it was melt in your mouth delicious. The tortillas were fresh and soft and featured the perfect chicken to cheese ratio.   Drinks  My friend drove so I got a margarita with an add-shot and with the heat outside  was surprisingly strong. They have great happy hour deals  we will definitely be going back to catch them another time soon.
Hula Hut,40,I was not anticipating this restaurant would feel so alive  kind of like a fiesta.  Apparently  reservations are the way to go here  especially when planning on sitting out on the patio. We waited briefly by the large outdoor bar  enjoyed a few drinks while taking in the view  although it was busy  it was not overwhelming.    Although I would have preferred to sit outside for dinner  we were offered a table inside and took it. The staff seemed to be very on top of their game and tenacious at promoting a timeline for dinner  but dining with family we haven t seen for several years seemed to have slowed their roll a bit  our server adapted very well to the change.  The food was very good  nothing really stood out on the excessively large menu  but I found it comparable to other tex mex restaurants.  They have a great location  Cheers  
Hula Hut,41,We enjoyed Sunday brunch here while in Austin.  2 mimosas and a beautiful view from the outside bar. Fajitas were yummy and you can refill your own chips. Wait is long if you want a table but bar was perfect.
Hula Hut,42,I went here for the first time despite growing up in Austin and was very pleasantly surprised  I assumed it was always really busy since it is touristy but my friend and I went to lunch on a Sunday and there was plenty of outdoor open seating in the back of the hut. It was really nice under the hut with ceiling fans despite it being 100 degrees outside  We had a great time dining by the water  which is so pretty  and the food was quick to arrive. My friend got a  tubular taco  and I got a quesadilla. The service was only alright but that is what you expect from a chill local establishment like this. The prices are also really good- it was less than  30 for the two of us. Don t let the wait times scare you away from this place because there is so much open seating in the back if you are ok with being outside  I will definitely return.
Hula Hut,43,Ordered curbside pickup  got our orders wrong  carelessly dumped everything in  not warm
Hula Hut,44,This place was really good  The views were great  and the food was delicious  Highly recommend the jalape o ranch and the queso with beef and guacamole 
Hula Hut,45,We recently visited this sweet place for dinner  Wished the weather was warmer when we visited but now we know where to go when it warms up . Fast service and our waiter was awesome quick to get ya drinks and chips and salsa  Food came out quick and was yummy  
Hula Hut,46,Good   quick  large portions of food that are decently priced. We had exceptional service. Will be back
Hula Hut,47,I don t give 5s often  but for a chill ambiance and great   flavorful food THIS is the place to go. They do a great job with their island vibe  you forget where you are  The waitress was well attentive to our needs. I love that they brought out chips and salsa as we waited for our food. The salsa is spicy  They brought our dog water as well as my table. The specialty cocktail pineapple cherry drink was amazing  The portions were HUEGE and so filling.   The BBQ sandwich could have had more BBQ sauce and it was hard to eat like a practical sandwich.
Hula Hut,48,Hula Hut has a nice tropical vacation vibe with a great view. The bartender was not busy  yet still not attentive. I asked to see a menu and she pointed to a scan on the bar and walked off   photo attached . It was not easy to get her attention to order which seemed odd when the bar was not busy. The salad arrived quickly and the server who brought the food was polite. There were no utensils ready and she flagged down the bartender to get utensils. The salad was average and the service from the bartender was below average  but I do recommend Hula Hut mainly for the tropical atmosphere.
Hula Hut,49,Overall a solid tourist spot with a great view. No Hula s but a few Huts. Sat at one of the 4 bars and would go back to try the others. On the way to the bathroom you get a nice view of some employees with great homemade tortilla making skills. Can get pretty crowded but recommend a drive through Terrytown afterwards. Emma Stone lives there 
Hula Hut,50,Come here for the scenery  not the food. The drinks are actually pretty good too. The food is average Mexican food  great for day drinking with friends to share some nachos or quesadillas. Staff was very friendly. Pro Tip   get there around mid day when they open the deck seating  around the bar  and that is first come  first serve. We didn t wait at all. Our food came out very quickly. The queso was fantastic.  We got the stuffed avocado appetizer because it looked unique. It was pretty good  worth the try. I ordered plain old chicken quesadillas and they were nothing special but good. Another note  they are currently not serving the fish bowl Hu-La-La drink for 2. I ordered 2 of the halves and the drink was very good and refreshing.
Hula Hut,51,I came for dinner with my family on a Sunday and we had a great time  It was fairly busy but we were only quoted 30 minutes for a wait and were able to pass that by getting a table in the open seating area anyway. Chips and salsa are self-serve in the open seating area  I m not sure if this applies to the whole restaurant or not  but you can go back as many times as you want which is nice. I ordered the quesadillas and they were solid  The portion sizes are big so I went home with basically an entire meal still but I m not complaining. Overall  the service was good but not necessarily the quickest. My biggest complaint was the spider family living in the umbrella over our table. We noticed them once it got later in the evening and while they technically didn t do anything  I felt uneasy knowing there were 10  spiders hanging above my head while I ate.   COVID Precautions  Some employees wore masks but they didn t seem to be required. Social distancing was minimal.
Hula Hut,52,This place was alright. Just to be upfront I was gonna 3 star it but the staff was great so an extra star for service. Hey it counts  So 3 stars for .... the food of course. It was alright. Nothing special. A bit on the pricier side given the type of establishment  they have a good variety of things on the menu and I did steal bites off my groups plates to get a feel of it. Everything was just OK.  The atmosphere itself is pretty nice. Kitschy interior with it s own charm. Nice location  when it s not cold definitely would be great to sit outside. If you re in the area and hungry it s not a bad place to park yourself.
Hula Hut,53,Never been treated so badly. The  manager  was awful and so rude. Wish this place was better.  I can t believe this guy is trusted to run a restaurant. Disputable.
Hula Hut,54,This restaurant in my opinion isn t the best in the world. I think this restaurant was strictly intended to be a scenic view and a drink special restaurant. The food isn t disgusting it just isn t a five-star. I think this place doesn t deserve a five star but doesn t deserve a three star because I knew going in the food wasn t going to wow me. As long as you know that going in this place is 100  a four-star because of the drinks the view and the service 
Hula Hut,55,My sister absolutely loves this place  but I think the food is just mediocre. The views  however  are stellar  and I will come back time and time again just to sit and eat chips and enjoy the beautiful lake and lovely ambience  We shared the hawaiian fajitas  which were just fine  too sweet  and too chewy of meat for my taste   and I had a very average pina colada. They seemed quite understaffed  and our server kept forgetting about us  lol   but he did apologize profusely and give us a free drink because of it  so that was nice. The bathrooms were also very dirty  which I only hope was due to being understaffed 
Hula Hut,56,I ordered through Uber Eats some items and one item was Chili con Queso. When I received the order  there were no chips with the Queso. I complained to Uber Eats and they said that since it didn t specifically say that it came with chips that I was SOL. I am never ordering Hula Hut or Uber Eats again just because this was just such a no-brainer. I will return their cup of Queso when I have time this weekend. Obviously they need it more than me since they have chips and I don t.
Hula Hut,57,Amazing service  food  and views  Our server Hannah was amazing. Very accommodating  informative. The atmosphere was great. Very Hawaii tropical vibe.  Can t wait to go back.
Hula Hut,58,Came here on a Sunday around 1 30pm and luckily it was not crowded. The parking is challenging but they had a valet for  7 so we paid and didn t bother with driving all around to find a spot. FYI there is a lot across the street and the walk up isn t bad. The complimentary chips and salsa was amazing  The food was good as well. The steak options are good so I would strongly advise you order anything with steak in it. The views on the river were really nice and we took pictures after lunch. We got lucky with a nice day with awesome weather.
Hula Hut,59,Food was great  location and atmosphere was great. Drinks were alrighty and restaurant is pricey. But all in all everybody was satisfied with the taste of their food. It was a great view good location. We would definitely return there again
Hula Hut,60,Why did we come to Hula Hut and a RAT just fell from the ceiling on somebody table I definitely had to exit  not my post  just sharing 
Hula Hut,61,All I really know to say is absolutely delicious the pork tacos are to die for. Please go visit you won t regret it.
Hula Hut,62,Haven t been here in six years- it was so refreshing to go back and feel the old austin vibes. Queso  fish tacos and key lime pie were amazing  and Matty and Ian were incredibly servers- you don t get servers like them often. Can t wait to go back.
Hula Hut,63,I rarely write reviews but this place needs this one. - My hubby and I have been looking forward to try this place for a while so we were very disappointed with how horrible the service  and food  was. My salad came with no dressing  and lettuce was gross and wilted and the fries were cold and soggy. Our server Demian disappeared for a good 30 40 min and when he finally came back  his excuse was he was stocking cups  we were so over the whole experience we just paid and left. The entire staff was horrible  really rude hosts and busters as well. A Busser actually slammed a door on my husband while he was carrying our 8 month old. I will not be recommending this place or ever come back again
Hula Hut,64,Went for lunch yesterday with my family.  It feels like the place needs a thorough cleaning - it just felt dirty.  Our lemonades tasted like dishwater lemonade.. the food was  fine   but was absolutely nothing special.  We probably wouldn t go back  not just because of the experience we had  but the health scores... and that picture of the rat...   I mean  I know this is TX and the bar is low  but this is really bad...
Hula Hut,65,Hula Hut is a place that you come for the environment and to hang with friends. Do not come here during the weekend  just a tourist trap. However pretty fun to sit on their patio on the water for lunch during a weekday.   You come here for the fun atmosphere. Not the food. Chips are terrible. My blackened fish burger was not bad. And the flan for dessert was good. Service was good. Checked on multiple times during our meal  food came out in 10 minutes.
Hula Hut,66,MADDY   I was visiting a friend in Austin and other friends suggested we visited hula hut. I m so glad we did  MADDY was our wonderful server and he filled us in on all the happy hour specials.  1 off margs during happy hour. Whoop whoop  This place has such laid back all are welcome vibes and was such a phenomenal way to kick off my visit. The food was good  the margs were even better and the vibes and service were A  
Hula Hut,67,Really awesome spot in Austin. The vibe is great and the views are incredible  The service is also great  Which makes this three star review even more difficult. The food was simply  ok.  Nothing special  a little over cooked  and a bit overpriced. I wish I could say better things about the cuisine but I cannot. I WOULD be willing to go back though for a second try due to the incredibly kind staff and beautiful location.
Hula Hut,68,Fun  casual restaurant by the lake for families and to take visitors from out of town  Portion sizes are huge and lots of variety on the menu. Service was very quick as well  Mozart s coffee roaster s is in the same area and is a great place to go after for dessert. Ordered the shrimp and vegetarian enchiladas  had plenty for leftovers. Will be coming back here again 
Hula Hut,69,Food wasn t great  service took forever  place was clean for the most part. You re basically going for the view honestly.
Hula Hut,70,My family stopped by Hula Hut for a drink. It s a great location on the water with nice views across the lake.   I gave the restaurant 2 stars because our waiter was friendly and I liked the location.   For the ladies bathroom  I would have to give it negative stars.   The smell was so bad  I tried to hold my breath. Imagine the smell of a busy concert porta potty  at the end of a very hot day  then multiply that times two.   It was soooo bad I ran out without washing my hands  and I m a person that takes pride in washing my hands.  Before leaving this  I did a quick search of Hula Hut s reviews and found the word  bathroom  came up 25 times. Most of what I read was about the lack of cleanliness and the smell.  I agree with other reviewers--ya ll can do better. You ve got a great location--please listen to what your patrons are saying.
Hula Hut,71,The best thing about this place is the view and the booze. The menu seems cool but it all tastes like microwaved watered down Tex mex. The best thing on the menu are the baby back ribs. Your safest options are anything that comes from the grill like a burger or a sandwich. Everything else is underwhelming. The food isn t work the wait but the view and drinks are a vibe.
Hula Hut,72,I m a tourist and a local recommended this place as his favorite restaurant and it did not disappoint. This place embodies the quirkiness of Austin  complimented by a beautiful view and tasty food. It s family and dog friendly. I do recommend you get here by 6 for dinner because after that it seemed to get packed. And wear sunscreen    But seriously  come check out this waterfront view.
Hula Hut,73,5 5 Service 4.5 Fish Tacos  grilled mahi was indeed fresh  I was skeptical  3.5 Steak tubular taco  flavor was good  but beef had odd mushy texture Creamy jalapeno tasted of a stale oil and seemed like ranch dressing blended with jalapenos
Hula Hut,74,I m optimistic about this place... so not sure how they train the host but walking into the restaurant the host was like a deer in headlights the welcome was not warm we basically had to say hi to her first.. we were seated handed off the menu and that s it .. no can I get y all some water .. or server will be right with you just really unseasoned her name starts with an A and ends with an A. So thankfully our server Spencer seasoned it up for me loved his vibe and his attitude real down to earth he suggested a few things that were actually delicious and I normally don t go with other peoples suggestions but I just decided to try it  I order a fish sandwich which was per Spencer s suggestion and it was  however my sister ordered fish tacos and lost her appetite due to hair being in her food.. yuck  kitchen staff need hair nets maybe...  anyways the drinks were good Spencer recommended a margarita that s not on the menu and was  I d definitely consider coming back and try it out again they have a nice selection on the menu and other items I d be willing to try
Hula Hut,75,I forget how special this place is in Austin.  You really do feel like you are on an island somewhere. We sat near the window inside and got the view while inside with the ac.  It s really hot in Austin especially in the summer but we totally could have gone outside to sit.  There were fans and while we are waiting it was cool near the water.  We got there before they opened.  I downed that they had started a waitlist because we were the first ones there but we weren t the first ones to be seated because they asked us to wait outside and others walked in right when they opened and got seated.  It was the first time taking my mom here for lunch and we wanted her to have a good time since she loves being near the water.   I ordered a margarita and my sister ordered a Mai tai.  She said it was a little on the sweet side. They were happy to exchange it for something else. She got the strawberry coconut mojito and it was delicious.   We got my mom the macadamia crusted magi magi fish dish.  It was perfect.  If you are looking for a healthier dish this would be it.  We ordered one fillet and it was plenty for her. My sister and I shared a half order of fajitas.  Didn t get a picture because we devoured it before I could get one. Love the cheese that it came with. The big shredded cheesy cheese for the win.   For dessert we had the fried ice cream.  I am not sure if it was suppose to be crunchy on the outside but it wasn t. Super soggy and soft shell that covered the ice cream.  The side slices of crispy chips I think they are sopapillas were hot and crispy just the way I would imagine fried ice cream would be.  I was little disappointed with the outside shell of this ice cream bc it was soft.  We peeled it off and didn t even eat them. Other than that our server  Naz  was super sweet  Very friendly and all smiles.
Hula Hut,76,The Tortilla soup hit the spot on a cold gray day and the service was outstanding.  Cudos to Kolton our server And Joey the manager. Kolton was efficient  friendly  attentive and made the customer experience fabulous. Thanks Hula Hut  Of course we will be back.
Hula Hut,77,We have never had a bad meal here. Today was a challenge for staff as a customer who consumed more alcohol than they should have had an incident at the outside bar. Staff cleaned up the area quickly. Please drink responsibly.
Hula Hut,78,Super cute place by the water  they have parking near the place and also up the hill or valet  I believe it s  7 . We parked across the street. Wait time was one hour but we said either outside or inside and waited only 15 min or so. We were seated upstairs outside  that s where you want to be    The view was amazing   It was hot but had a nice breeze. I got a Mexican mule to drink  a little spicy kick to it pretty good . I got the chicken Hawaiian fajitas had portion  it came with red peppers  onions and pineapple. Their freshly made tortillas were good  chicken was good  one piece was over cooked but the rest was fine  Fun place  
Hula Hut,79,aiden wynn is an amazing host  awesome staff   my friend fell into the water and Aiden jumped into the water and saved her while she was drowning it was the most heroic thing I ve ever witnessed from an employee.
Hula Hut,80,Cute restaurant on the water. Super busy and crowded  friendly service  we were seated pretty quick  sooner then we were told. Food was great  the nachos were actually amazing  one of the best nachos I ve head in a while. Their drinks are very good too  refreshing and not too sweet. I tried the stuffed avocado and it was just okay  a little too much avocado to chicken ratio  a little bland  wouldn t get again. The Thai bbq fajita  steak  was BOMB   The steak was super tender  very well seasoned  we got a side of rice and beans as it does not come with the 1 2 order but they were not necessary  also kind of bland. Overall would recommend the place if ever in the area. Just for the nice view 
Hula Hut,81,I haven t lived in Austin for years but I fondly remember this place as one of my all time favorite restaurants in Texas. This restaurant has a laid back and relaxed vibe. Island themed but serve Mexican Polynesian infusion. Repeat after me   Hu-La-La . This is my drink of choice every time I come here. I ve been trying to get the recipe for years  It is vacation in a cup. Get the fish bowl size and drink it by yourself for a good time. Some of my favorite meals are the Ribs Appetizer  Queso Compuesto  Salmon Dinner  and Blackened Salmon Tacos to name a few. I ve never had anything bad here nor have I ever had a bad time. Make a detour out of the city for this spot. You won t regret it 
Hula Hut,82,To be honest I was expecting an overpriced  subpar food experience here given their reputation and location  but I ve been pleasantly surprised in my two visits here. It s hard to find a table that doesn t have a spectacular view  and it s been much less crowded than one would expect given the crowd Mozart s attracts.   Their drink menu is huge and mostly reasonably priced. Their specialty is margaritas but if that s not your thing there are plenty of traditional and unusual options to fit whatever you re looking for.  Food wise I loved the chicken Thai bbq fajitas. The bbq sauce has a great balance of a spice and mild sweetness. My favorite was the Thai peanut sauce  it has just the right amount of rich flavor and goes really well on the charbroiled chicken.  Covid wise they re handling things pretty reasonably  all the employees seem to be doing what s necessary to give patrons a safe experience. Some of the tables on the inner portion of their deck are a bit close for my comfort level  but on the less crowded out part of the deck I ve found it to be pretty easy to space out  particularly since it s open seating.
Hula Hut,83,What a fun funky vibe at Hula Hut- great way to bring people in. Lots of outdoor seating with nice views of the  lake  and the dam. Service super attentive. We didn t get drinks do can t comment on those but the food was pretty good  nothing fantastic but still above average. The food being ok was the reason this doesn t get five stars- but like anyone knows when you ve got the view the food is normally secondary. Definitely worth a visit
Hula Hut,84,We went in the rain  Wait to 30 mins   Food was good  girls loved the burgers   Drinks were on point  Still fun atmosphere   Highly recommended
Hula Hut,85,One of the coolest places just because it s sits on the water.  Dress code is pretty much anything and you will find people in shorts and bikinis. Chips you get yourself.  Boats pull up and stick abs come in for food.  Parking is difficult but need to be patient.  Wait time was told 1.5 hours at 7 30pm but for called within an hour. Got the bar in the meantime and enjoyed people watching and a beautiful sunset on the water. Was already buzzed by the time we ordered food but one of the best times I ve had recently.  Lots of outdoor seating on the deck or inside if you re not an outdoor petson. But who in Austin isn t an outdoor person  
Hula Hut,86,The view is the big draw with this restaurant. Trying to park is INSANE. You ll be walking blocks and blocks on a weekend. Food is average. Drinks are average. Wait times are long. View is incredible.  Worth it  Nope  not for me.
Hula Hut,87,We had an extremely rude and  snobby bartender outside named Jenn  Who obviously was in a very very bad mood and should never have came into work  totally ruined our evening  for a group of 7 traveling 45 minutes across the lake and we decided to leave because we did not want to give Hula Hut our business.  Will never come back 
Hula Hut,88,I didn t get the concept and the Polynesian Mexican Mashup did not make for a great taste. Pass
Hula Hut,89,The food here was okay  nothing to really rave about. I wish my sandwich had more vegetables  the coleslaw seemed kinda dead under the fish. It was okay though  I think the main hype about this place is that it s located on the river. Really pretty views and the restaurant is decorated to give you island vibes.
Hula Hut,90,Food was mediocre  but the view was pretty nice. Would recommend just for the experience. It s in a cute area along the lake with a few other restaurants. Con  the mixed drinks a friend and I got tasted like they had absolutely no alcohol 
Hula Hut,91,I think Hula Hut is one of those places where the food isn t out of this world extraordinary  but the views make it all worth it. I was surprised to see how many other people had the same idea to visit on a Tuesday night  not much social distance wise on the interior with almost all the tables occupied . I was happy with how quickly we were able to get seated. I ordered the Shrimp Enchiladas. For the food alone  I d give a 4 5 as it was pretty delicious and the portion size very good. The chips and salsa we got when seated were a bit spicy  and I love spice   but definitely fresh and homemade. Overall  this is a pretty decent place to get TexMex  especially for the location and the views that can come with your meal.
Hula Hut,92,Ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fried avocado tacos.  Both were amazing.  We received excellent service  food arrived in a snap and was fresh and flavorful.  Glad I chose a visit here during my first trip to Austin 
Hula Hut,93,I have never been to this restaurant but I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the views are also really nice considering it sits right on the lake.  This is a great spot to go with friends or family they offer a selection of Tex-Mex all the way to your every day American burger.  Currently they are outside seating only so plan on the weather when you arrive there exterior seating is completely covered so you don t have to worry about getting rained on.  Also know that this is an Austin hotspot so if you come with a large party just anticipate on waiting for a good hour to get in this is pretty standard for most places especially with the shortage at most restaurants in this new economy I would recommend this to anybody any day of the week if it wasn t so far away I d be here on a regular basis  The only reason why they didn t get five stars was because I felt their drinks were a little bit small and overpriced for what you got but they still have great taste and flavor 
Hula Hut,94,Hula Hut is probably a 4 5 for their food but a 10 10 for the view    The amazing view you get by the lake makes this a place you neeeed to come to    On a Sunday night we had about a 40 min wait for a table  and the restaurant was pretty packed. There were a few vegetarian options which could be made vegan by taking out the dairy. I got the fried avocado tacos substituting the jalape o crema with plum sauce and it was SO GOOD  
Hula Hut,95,Waited over 2 hours. They had plenty of tables inside but not enough workers  on a Saturday . Took us another 20 mins to be served water and utensils and for the worker to take our order. Took another 30 minutes for the food to come and it was below mediocre. Overpriced food for the quality   Cute outdoor patio dining area but we ll never be back
Hula Hut,96,Everything was extremely salty. I felt so gross after eating it. I downed probably at least 5 cups of water afterwards. Chicken enchilada was completely filled with cheese--they should name it cheese enchilada instead. Highly disappointed by the quality  taste  and value of the food. I would recommend Chuy s over this joke any day. If you re going for the view  you d be better off getting something at Mozart s.
Hula Hut,97,Amazing vibe of this restaurant.  The location is really nice which makes this place apple of the pie. It is popular for its Mexican cuisine. The staff was great at the deck and was helpful. We ordered fried avocado tacos   enchiladas and mango tacos. All of them were on spot. The flavors were good  for a Tex-mex palette.  It is usually crowded on weekends so the earlier you go the better.
Hula Hut,98,I like Hula Hut. Really  it s okay exactly deserving of its 3.5 stars  but since I can t give half stars I round up. The service is always solid  and I love getting to eat on the water. That alone is worth the price of the food and drinks  in my opinion. Now  for the food and drinks portion of the evening  if you keep to fair simple orders  queso  nachos  etc  then you ll be happy with the food  but I don t think either the recipes or the cooks are necessarily top notch. The drinks  though  are fun and taste good so in the end I keep coming back and drinking and ordering simple appetizers  which I d recommend others do the same.
Hula Hut,99,I love going to Hula Hut and enjoy bringing my friends here who are visiting from out of town  The views are beautiful and it s a great place to hang out    The food and drinks are decent  I had the stuffed avocado and a margarita  which I would recommend. The salsa though is not good at all. I don t even bother eating it when I go.
Hula Hut,100,Come here for the view  stop somewhere else for food service... Hula Hut had been recommended to us and we decided to stop by on a Monday at sunset. The food was decent  good  nothing too spectacular but not bad  and the view was STUNNING. The hosts were pretty unfriendly  but seemed really young untrained in hosting  generally. We waited thirty minutes for our table  but didn t mind at all because we explored the dock and view. Once we got seated... our server Austin took 15 minutes to get to our table and greet us with just water... which would have been totally okay if he was busy  but we outright saw him texting. His trainee  Millie  was so sweet and greeted us when she realized we hadn t been yet. We got the texas nachos and chicken fajitas  as well as a margarita. All pretty good  but the service was just terrible and although he was nice  we had to physically stop him to order  pay  etc. So yeah... recommend checking out the view and getting dinner afterwards  somewhere else 
Hula Hut,101,Had the Hu La La drink and the Chicken Chile Relleno dinner plate.  Drink was good although my husband had the Blue Hawaii and that was outstanding   The Chicken Chile Relleno was really good.  We also had the Fried Ice Cream for dessert  which was really good  the carmel and sugar dusted crispas was so good 
Hula Hut,102,Great food  great drinks  great vibes     It s impossible to anything other than a great time when you re sitting atop Lake Austin with a bombie drink in hand    It also helps that the team members are consistently friendly and accommodating
Hula Hut,103,This was in my list of to-visit restaurants for a long time. Went on a Tuesday evening for friends anniversary. There was no wait time and we were seated in the open restaurant next to the water. The ambience was pretty good. Our waitress was pretty good and gave good suggestions for all the vegetarians in the group. We ordered stuffed avocado  veg tubular taco and veg tub enchilada.. stuffed avocado with chicken was the best of the lot. The vegetarian entrees were bland. Too much cheese. 3 stars only for the ambience and service. Food was just okay.
Hula Hut,104,no one was there to guide us . waiter was staring at us how much tip we pay  that was really uncomfortable.
Hula Hut,105,Nice marine themed decor  in a lovely spot on the water  but the food is mediocre. The place bills itself as Hawaiian  but in fact it s typical TexMex. Adding a piece of pineapple to a dish doesn t make it Hawaiian... it s just TexMex with pineapple... I wish the food there was really good  because the location and decor are lovely.
Hula Hut,106,We love Hula Hut  This is a great place to grab a bite to eat and have a cold drink  It also has a great view of the lake.
Hula Hut,107,Whole experience was very underwhelming. All of our 5 meals came out cold and had to wait awhile just for 1 soda. We got the Huli Huli Luau Platter and the ribs were charred and cold  like they left it on the grill for 5 hours put it on ice and served it to us. Bartender was snappy with us  gave us attitude when we wanted a drink and everything was just dirty  from the bathrooms to the silverware and tables. Saw a dirty plate sitting on the side of the bar  where drinks are being made and being served  when we sat down and was still there when we left. This place has so much potential  it s a beautiful restaurant  has a nice atmosphere  food was good even though it was stone cold but it s operated so poorly. Don t think we d come back.
Hula Hut,108,If you come here   the chips and salsa are help yourself  and the coconut shrimp is an absolute must. If you don t know what to order for a drink  trust Sam s judgement   
Hula Hut,109,Food was good but Austin  our server  was better  Really enjoyed his service and he really made the night great.
Hula Hut,110,The food is whatever  but you can t beat sitting out on a dock over the water  especially in an inland city. If you sit inside and complain about the food  you re missing the point
Hula Hut,111,Cool place we found on the water. Not a lot of parking though. Service was ok as it took awhile but food was good when it finally came out. A little more pricey for the dishes as for the drinks. Almost  10 a drink and adds up quick. Overall great fun experience and hope to come back. Next time down in Austin as alittle far to stop in often but hope to make it back next time off of work. Give it a try
Hula Hut,112,The Shrimp Chili Relleno is not your traditional take on the dish  but was really good. However  the Macadamia Crusted Mahi-mahi was not good at all. It was overcooked  very fishy  and served over bland blanched spinach. The highlight of our meal was the fresh salsa and the house made tortillas. We also enjoyed our drinks.  Service was good and the atmosphere was a lot of fun. I like the self serve chips and salsa idea.
Hula Hut,113,Sorry.. tooo touristy and busy for me. I should have known better.  Food was average for a busy Friday night.  Self service chips and Salsa was kinda fun while waiting 45 minutes on the outside deck.  Food wasn t worth an IG pic. No view at table for outside service.
Hula Hut,114,The good   I love the seating on the pier. One half has open seating with the breeze coming through  the other half has tinted plastic which still allow you to view the river  without feeling the heat or becoming a baked potato. Speaking of food  we had nachos  a green Chile enchilada  queso  and finished with a slice of key lime pie.   All of the food was delicious  but the key lime pie I wasn t ready for... the pie crust is an almond toasted coconut crust with a filling texture between that of a tres leches cake and pudding. Quite literally the best dessert from a restaurant ever.   The bad  Joking  this was a fantastic experience and we will definitely visit again.
Hula Hut,115,Has been forever since I have eaten here  Totally forgot how delicious it is   Coconut shrimp app was amazing  The chicken and guacamole tubular was mouth watering and the cheese enchiladas were the best   Can t wait to go back soon
Hula Hut,116,Austen was my server and explained the recent changes the restaurant has had since I ve been here three years ago. The biggest change is the quality of the food - it was fantastic 
Hula Hut,117,I tried the Mexonisian shrimp flautas and the grilled chile rubbed salmon tacos. They were great and quite reasonably priced for the location of this restaurant 
Hula Hut,118,Great ambiance good food service could be better but all in all not bad  Definitely recommend    The quesadilla was by far my favorite
Hula Hut,119,Amazing place and service. The shrimp tubular taco  Hawaiian chicken  chicken quesadillas are all amazing. Their salad is great too  would of ordered it as a meal. Maybe next time. Great place for dinner with great views.
Hula Hut,120,This restaurant was full of highs and unfortunately had a few lows too.   Highs   Beautiful location  On the water with outdoor seating.  Great prices for drinks.  Good food-I has the beef fajita enchilada and thought it was decent.  Our server was super friendly and was very kind to my grandma when she couldn t hear him.  We magically got a parking spot right out front.  Lows   Outdoor seating is first come first serve. While there were empty tables outside  we opted to stay indoors because the available table was being hit by the sun.  There are a lot of grackles lingering on the patio-not much you can due about this-though I wasn t interested in getting pooped on   The menu I was handed was literally falling apart.  The bathroom stunk like they were having a sewage problem. It also needed a fresh remodel-a chunk of the floor was missing in the first stall.   Bottom line  I would go back  though it wouldn t be the first place I go next time I m in Austin.
Hula Hut,121,Perfect ahi tuna and shrimp tacos. It was also a treat to have such delicious frozen mango margarita 
Hula Hut,122,Came with some friends from MN and it was our first stop in Austin. We attempted to enjoy their patio but the wind was more than we could handle so we opted to so we opted to sit inside.   Unlimited chips and salsa was so fresh. You could really taste the tomatoes  onions  and peppers. Lots off flavorful spice  which I appreciated  but could catch you off guard if you re not used to it.   Montego Bay shrimp tacos were amazing  honestly  everything was   the sauce reminded me of cucumber sauce used on gyros and really sealed the deal.   The drinks were good  though I wouldn t have minded if they were a bit stronger. We stayed from lunch to HH and kept the drinks flowing.   Our waiter was great and shared lots of great tips about places to check in while in town.
Hula Hut,123,TLDR  Average Tex Mex food with a fusion touch.  Highly overrated restaurant - probably due to its location on the lake. In close proximity to many good places  this restaurant has a real advantage with its location but the food  hygiene and the menu does not do justice to it. I intend to give this place another chance once COVID situation changes. Hope they change my mind on my initial impression.
Hula Hut,124,We ve been going to the Hula Hut ever since it opened. Always a good time and good food.
Hula Hut,125,Maddy is the best server  The shrimp enchiladas are to die for.... The Texas mule is a must 
Hula Hut,126,What s better than this gorgeous view with amazing food  We really enjoyed the tacos 
Hula Hut,127,we had a very nice lunch and cold beers. It was a hot Saturday afternoon and the place was very busy. The staff were helpful and patient  and we were served promptly. I had the fried avocado taco  something I had never heard of. It was delish 
Hula Hut,128,Traveled to Austin today on a whim and you know it s a good place when they re busy at 2 30 on. Wednesday  Hubs and I always check out Mexican food wherever we go and this is definitely a place to come back to. They have daily happy hour specials and an outdoor seating area with a gorgeous view of Lake Travis  The chicken flautas are the best I ve ever had of any place  The chicken is tender and juicy and omg their jalape o ranch with the guajilo sauce is delicious  The chicken fajitas were a good portion size for one and the shiner version is tasty too  You can tell everything is freshly made- check them out if you re in the area 
Hula Hut,129,Our waitress  Shelly was the absolute best    She was so nice and understanding of our likes
Hula Hut,130,Horrible experience  Was told an hour wait for first available. After 90 minutes we asked about our table. Was told it would be cleaned off. Waited another 20 and then was seated at a different DIRTY table. Sat there for 20 minutes with no one acknowledging us    Go somewhere else   Anywhere else   
Hula Hut,131,This place was.... okay. The salsa and queso both tasted and looked watered down. Not impressive. The coconut shrimp and fajita tubular taco were both pretty good. I ordered two Blue Hawaii drinks. The first one was perfect. Second one looked and tasted totally different. Lacking consistency. The place is great for views of the lake.
Hula Hut,132,We saw this restaurant from a duck tour and had to go back. My wife and daughter shared the Hawaiian fajitas which were amazing and I had the pipeline shrimp enchiladas. Portions were big and food exceeded expectations for Mexican Hawaiian fusion.
Hula Hut,133,Waited 145 minutes to try this spot...  amp  I will say got dang it  it was WORTH IT    Super organized staff. Fast service. Beautiful view    Amazing FOOODDDD    I will definitely be going again  But maybe in the day time next time
Hula Hut,134,The service was awesome. Great place to hang out with friends. Our waitress made it enjoyable
Hula Hut,135,It was my wife and I first time here. We didn t know the main section was reservation only. But the Bar was open. Phillip the bartender recommended everything we ate. Everything from the chips and salsa to the fonda queso  to our main courses was amazing. By far the best Mexican food we have had in Austin in the 6 years we have lived here.  Thank you Phillip for all of your recommendations. We will for sure be back and have already recommended friends and family.
Hula Hut,136,A favorite spot for my cousins that live nearby. Unassuming - tex mex Polynesian  I like the concept  choose a seat outside and grab your own chips and salsa  unlimited. It was pretty warm for me  but the views were great  The salsa is pretty good and has a kick   We started with the fried avocado that was filled with chicken  cheese  and lots of other goodness. It was pretty good  but a bite was good enough for me.  There were so many options  but I decided on the weekend special which was a taco salad with steak. The ingredients were a bit limited inside  but it was pretty tasty.  3 stars as the service was really spotty  I think we had a new waiter  and he rarely came by.
Hula Hut,137,Maybe go during the week  when it s not busy  and maybe only for drinks and apps. We went on a Saturday and while we waited for our table we had a good experience on the deck. We should have stayed there.  Once we were called inside there was confusion about where we were to be seated. We stood in the middle of the dining room for nearly 10 minutes just waiting until we were finally seated. But then  it took nearly 30 minutes to have anyone at all come to our table. No water  no drinks. We only had chips because the bar is self serve and we got our own. Several tables around us were seated after us and already had food. After requesting a manager  our server showed up about 5 minutes later. She told us she was new  which we can empathize with but then proceeded to tell us the table we were at wasn t usually a 4 top and our food may not get delivered correctly. Um  not our problem. They seated us there...   The manager delivered a queso  on the house  which in my opinion was a lacking response to the cluster we had experienced. Our food was adequate but not worth the hour   we wasted just waiting. We won t be back.
Hula Hut,138,Food is pretty good  but service isn t the best.  It s definitely pretty here  More of a tourist spot  but the waitress we had when going was terrible. She took over 20 mins to even take our order and never gave us silverware napkins when it came. She never checked up on us throughout our meal and had to ask the other waiters for assistance. She only came back when it was time for the bill.   Overall a pretty okay experience  just hope you get a decent waiter.
Hula Hut,139,Delivered me a cocktail with a fly clearly at the bottom under all the ice and garnish then proceeded to tell me that because I m outside that just happens. The bartender and server should have absolutely caught this before it hit the table.
Hula Hut,140,Visited Austin while breaking for Thanksgiving. This was a suggested place to try. A great scenic view of the lake  and mountain.  The jalapeno sauce was delicious.  The mango margarita was tasty.  I totally got full of the chips and salsa. The salsa was so good  I could have forgone dinner.  If you are near  visit this place.
Hula Hut,141,I moved here in 1991. My first job was at Lakeview Cafe across the street on Lake Austin Blvd. where Hula Hut is now. I still live in Austin and have watched that area develop. I ve eaten at HH multiple times. The last time was 6 years ago  even though I live less than 2 miles away . We decided to try it again tonight and it will be the last time ever  Terrible food  terrible service. Staff that can t even answer basic questions like  what wine do you have  any beers on tap   Chips that are crushed. All around a HUGE disappointment   
Hula Hut,142,Thus was suggested by our tour guide. It s right off of a dock  great to watch the sunset. The service was great.  I loved our waitress Taylor. The food was even better. Must come back
Hula Hut,143,I ve gone to Hula Hut several times over the past few years. It s one of my go-to places to take friends when they re visiting the city for the first time. The atmosphere is incredibly lively and inviting with great food as well. I am very content with their chips and frozen margaritas. The only down side is there is always a very long wait since it is located in a great location long the lake with easy parking. I ve recommend calling ahead if possible. The estimated wait time is typically off a bit too.
Hula Hut,144,Reminds me of Hawaii  Love the fun decor and that it s right on the lake. There s a good food selection of fajitas  tacos  enchiladas  burgers  appetizers and other entrees like ribs and Chile rellenos. Lots of seating options available  indoor and outdoor.   We waited a half hour for Sunday lunch and food was surprisingly quick to arrive after ordering. I got the shrimp Chile relleno  which came with rice and beans. It was decent but nothing that I would crave again soon. If I come back I want to check out the fajitas.   Think it would be a fun spot for cocktails and appetizers  but for really delicious food I would recommend going elsewhere.   I ve seen several reviews of bad service. We loved our server - he was friendly and though busy still checked in with us and the hostess was super friendly.
Hula Hut,145,Very cute spot and the food was great  My husband and I found this place while on vacation. They have a great deck pier area on the water with seating  along with bars outside too. I ordered the shrimp tubular taco  stuffed avocado  and their house marg - all super good  We sat at the bar and service was a little inconsistent - I got a dirty looking glass with a bunch of dirt debris in it so I asked for another and they gladly swapped it out. Drinks were pretty strong though   Definitely would return.
Hula Hut,146,This place was fantastic  we came here to watch the sunset on the lake and have a couple drinks. The place was packed  but with a friendly smile and a question  we were able to double up at a table... The service was as mediocre at best  and was really slow... the five stars came from the setting sun and the conversation at the table... The food was very good and the prices are reasonable. I will definitely be back
Hula Hut,147,It is what it is. Drinks  bar food  and lake view. We got good service and enjoyed the bar food and several margaritas.   Texas Nachos fits the name. Chips the size of your head fully loaded.
Hula Hut,148,I go to the Hut often. Love their coconut shrimp and ritas. Can t beat the view. Their enchiladas and tacos are pretty tasty. Love their spicy salsa and chips.
Hula Hut,149,Hawaiian Tex mex... didn t know I needed it till I had it now I can t go back  them fajitas are like gods gift to the world... imma be honest that s all I had here. Yes I get the same thing every time but its like sex in a tortilla. Who doesn t want that
Hula Hut,150,This place is one of my all time favorites. The location is perfect  right by the lake. The cocktails are decent.  What I really like is their stuffed avocado. This shredded chicken wrapped in a avocado and deep fried. Just like how they do it in Hawaii  Texas     We also got the coconut shrimp and cocktails  but the star of the show was stuffed avocado.   Great date spot 
Hula Hut,151,The good is always good  But tonight  our server  MADDIE was the best    He was attentive  helpful and very kind and personable   In this time of Covid complicated service and servers  Maddie brought his A-game. Best experience since the whole Covid mess started  Thanks for great food and an even better experience   
Hula Hut,152,I was going to give this place a chance even after reading some of the lower reviews because I figured we cant go wrong considering it  at least  has beautiful views to show our guest from out of town.   I m glad we took our chances because everything was so delicious  fresh  amp  full of flavor. The portions were great and the plates all looked great when placed on the table. The drinks were all tasty and looked pretty as well. They have daily specials even during the weekend which is nice. There is seating inside and out and there are tiki umbrellas and other covered seating outside all with great views. There are so many things to look at in the restaurant and they have a tiny souvenir shop with shirts  amp  other small souvenirs as well. Our server was working with a seriously injured knee but she didn t let that affect her sweet personality and great work with keeping up on our drinks and anything else we may have needed. I see that as exemplary    Items we had   Queso Compuesto  eaten with chips and it has yummy chunks of meat.  Fried stuffed avocado with chicken inside    Chicken flautas    6 small ones    Shrimp Enchiladas    1 huge one 4 regulars   Shrimp Chile Rellenos    2 huge peppers   -The person that chose this plate is known for cleaning off other people s plates lol and he couldn t finish off the second relleno. -the 2nd one was taken for leftovers and was just as good warmed up-  They had a mimosa special  amp  a coronita michelada special for  3. The mimosa was just right and my hubby loved the michelada. Others from our group ordered the fish bowl which was tasty also  amp  not too sweet which tends to ruin a drink.   Overall  we had a great experience. There s free parking across the street and the wait wasn t bad. My only negative was that I noticed they weren t cleaning off tables quickly. I seen near the bar area that tables were left there dirty for quite a while. That never looks good. Other than that  everything was great. I definitely recommend this spot.
Hula Hut,153,The positive-beautiful views of Lake Austin and the food was decent.  The cons-the bartenders and staff were really rude to my family  the place is chaotic  order food there  drinks here  no service there  etc   and no one wears masks in this Covid breeding petrie dish.   When you finish eating  there is no information about bussing your own tables and the trash cans are overflowing...so  most of the outdoor tables were filthy and there were no facilities to throw away your own trash or paper towels to wipe our own tables.   It seems to be a badly managed restaurant with a lot of potential to improve.
Hula Hut,154,They have a great atmosphere being right next to the water  lots of bright colors with their indoor and outdoor seating and the food was plenteous. The food was alright  just regular mexican food that you could get anywhere. The drinks were kind of expensive but I should have seen that coming. Parking is a pain in the butt but I think I would come back if I wanted a change of scenery that wasn t like the other downtown areas.
Hula Hut,155,I ve been here a couple times before and this is actually my second time enjoying a birthday dinner here  this time with my girlfriends family. We arrived here right before sunset and got a table for 6 pretty quickly. We were seated in a great spot allow allowing us to look our over the lake at the hills.   For dinner I had some shrimp enchiladas that were absolutely fantastic and very filling. I really like that the waitress was honest about food portions and helped me in making the right decision.   The food came out relatively quickly and everyone was happy with their orders. There was pretty good weather  not too hot  and the mosquitos didn t bother too much. Everything was good  but the birthday dessert wasn t all that good.   Pretty great place for some food on the lake and the vibe is really nice. Authentic Austin kind of place.
Hula Hut,156,Terrible service from the get go...  Food was horrible...  Nothing like seeing an employee blow snot rockets in the sink while you re in the bathroom.   Yeah  I won t be back
Hula Hut,157,This is a fun little hang out by the water  Such a festive atmosphere for all types. Family  friends  kids  adults and whoever else   Definitely digging the atmosphere  Views are fantastic depending on where you sit.    Margaritas are delicious. Can t lie about them. In the wise words of Samuel Jackson as played by Monsieur Chappelle   IT LL GET YA DRUNK    They are strong no doubt  but delicious   Food is what you d expect if you crossed Tex mex with Polynesian food. Not bad. Won t complain about the Tubular taco aka extra long burrito   Salsa wasn t my favorite but when you re two Don s in who cares   Service is great and everyone is super friendly    Overall I think this is an extremely fun place with something for everyone  I certainly foresee coming back and having a great time 
Hula Hut,158,The staff ruined our experience here. Not only does it take over 40 minutes to find a table in the self seating area  but it also takes an additional 20 minutes for a waiter to come clean it. Overall  terrible service  terrible wait time  and average food.
Hula Hut,159,It was our first time to experience Hula Hut and we had a very unfortunate time. Not because of the food  but the server by the name Lex  girl wearing rainbow striped shirt and black shorts with tattoos--we were there on September 2nd  was so so awful. It felt like such an inconvenience to even be there. I ve been a server all my life and I will admit  my expectations are high- but this was no other level I have experienced before. Me and my friends felt so uncomfortable to the point where it was cringy just to ask for the tab. She would just walk by us and never check in on us  ever.    Our drinks were all watered down  as if they had been sitting finished at the bar for awhile before she brought them to us. Anything we tried to order  we had to specifically ask her to stop  because she never came by to check on us. She also tried to take food our away when we were clearly still eating  which normally wouldn t be so offensive except that every single interaction we had with her was uncomfortable.   We wanted to get a second drink and I had to pull her aside and say I d like another drink. After she took it  she started to walk away before anyone else could order. When the rest of us ordered second drinks  she even  is that all  Are you sure   As if it was inappropriate for us all to want a second drink. IT WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE.   Just  bad. I hate it when a potentially fun  good place gets ruined by bad service. So bad that this is my first Yelp review ever. I CREATED a profile just so I could write a review. Yikes.
Hula Hut,160,Great ambiance  amp  great margaritas. I was pleasantly surprised that every margarita was great  sometimes margaritas can be a little off. Not here. Jay was a great server and we loved her. I enjoyed the the atmosphere and the chips and salsa were good  So were the shrimp tacos and the beef fajitas
Hula Hut,161,The worst experience with the wait staff and hostess. Rude  I could go on and on  but you would have to have been there to experience the rudeness of this staff  Unbelievable  The waitress argued with us  was unstable  unprepared and just unprofessional. I am not one to treat wait staff horribly or be disrespectful to them  I am more on the other side. I go out of my way to help them as much as possible. It is a hard job.  But this waitress  was rude with comments and actions. I could not believe the behavior for her. Another waitress made comments concerning an issue also and the host.  I have never been so disrespected at a restaurant before. We came here for a special occasion and it was ruined by your wait staff.  I went to speak with a manager concerning this behavior and asked to be moved. He said she felt like everyone was coming at her and I told him his waitress was overwhelmed long before I said anything to her. I told him she was totally unprofessional and we were customers. She was fanning herself in front of us with her hand  slamming our food and drinks down. Yelling at us.  They tried to squeeze us in to a sardine can to eat and drink and there was no comfort at this small table for 7 people. When we asked to move to another table  she wanted us to tab out with her. I asked her why  We were just moving to another table  give the ticket to another person. She completely became unglued.   I will never be back.
Hula Hut,162, cracks knuckles  the fact of the matter is  I only fire this thing up for reviews that I feel to be exceptionally noteworthy and deserving of mention. Today  at this conveniently-placed local favorite  my sweet  unwitting  girlfriend ordered the Hawaiian fajitas. Upon receiving the fajitas  we noticed her spread came complete with one  1  whole cockroach laid gently on his back. He was delicately covered in shredded cheese up to his shoulders  leaving plenty of breathing room near his mandibles. With his antennas erect  we asked that he be removed from the table. The restaurant obliged and brought back our replacement accoutrements  cockroach free  and pictured below. They made an offhand joke that the replacement was more thoroughly inspected  and called it even by comping the fajitas. I m now suicidal.
Hula Hut,163,Great spot with views of the lake. They got extra busy for Sunday Funday and our server  Daemien did a great job considering how many tables he had. Our biggest gripe was ordering drinks that cost extra because they come in fun pineapple glasses  but they didn t have enough to serve to the people ordering. The stuffed avocado is great  as well as the Hawaiian style fajitas and BBQ pork sandwich. Highly recommend for chill patio drinking on a sunny afternoon.
Hula Hut,164,George Jeorge was the worst waiter ever. Denied myself a beer when I am 6 days from turning 24. Loser alert
Hula Hut,165,Great atmosphere  good food  slightly pricey but you pay for the experience  Overall no complaints except there is usually a long wait but nothing they could do about that 
Hula Hut,166,Great location. Need a reservation to get a decent seat and time. If you go to the bar and wait a few minutes  full service tables right on the water open up pretty quickly.  Food is good  not great but the location is loverly.
Hula Hut,167,Stopped in around 6 30pm on a Sunday.   Long wait times  90  mins. However  The tables outside on the deck are first come first served.   Went outside to scavenge for a table  and in the meantime wanted to order drinks.   We waited at the bar for too long  lol  and didn t get served. We felt pretty dumb just standing there. Bartender told us to wait on the other end of the bar after about 10 minutes. We got there  and he continued to disregard us for several more minutes.   Luckily  a family left from their table and we were close enough to swoop in and sit  There are several parties waiting around for tables so plan accordingly lol.   When we sat down  one of the workers was so rude to us  Had an attitude for no reason. I wish I knew his name to warn y all    He was wearing a green staff shirt and had yoda ears on.   When our table was cleaned  Steve greeted us and thank GOD he was our server  He was wonderful. Kind  helpful  and entertaining    They were sadly out of a few different drink options  like their version of pina coladas and a couple other signature cocktails. We ended up settling for margaritas which were good but nothing extraordinary.   Chips and salsa are tasty. The queso is pretty good too    I ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi which was very tasty. Definitely recommend this dish. The salad it came with was very under dressed.   Boyfriend got the steak torpedo taco. Steak was cooked very well. Rice and beans were average. I thought the dish overall was nothing spectacular.   All in all  we might come back  on a weekday  mostly for the view and experience  and fingers crossed Steve can serve us.   If you re ever there  ask for Steve   You won t regret it.
Hula Hut,168,Service is terrible  It s not even busy every server has an attitude not doing anything ignored me when I said excuse me and hides in the back . So sad because such a good place
Hula Hut,169,Best tasting key lime pie great tasting shrimp enchiladas nice waterfront ambiance  and our waiter Jackson was beyond awesome   Very polite and attentive to our needs.
Hula Hut,170,Went here for the view and was prepared for just okay tex mex.  Ordered margaritas - after drinking them  it became clear that one of the glasses had DRIED BIRD POOP stuck to the inside. Maybe it was dried sour cream with black bits   Either way it was incredibly disgusting and only visible after drinking half of it.   So so gross. It would have been super obvious when they were making the drink - why not just use another glass  Waitress whisked it away and we couldn t take a picture  but I m never coming back here.
Hula Hut,171,This is my go-to place in Central Austin. Tex-Mex with a twist. The margaritas are always yummy and my favorite dish is chile rellenos.  The backside of the restaurant is built out over lake Austin so it is a very unique feature. The breeze gently flows across as it comes up from Lady Bird Lake. This is a great spot for a date night or a TGIF happy hour 
Hula Hut,172,The food was amazing  but the bartender ruined the whole experience. When my family asked for food and drinks  he turned around and ignored them. Than we gut a table  but it was full of dirty plates from the previous guests. I took dirty plates to the bar  to clean the table and bartender barked at me  saying it s a bar  not a cleaning station. That left a bad taste in the mouth and definitely ruined the experience. If the bartender is unable to handle stress or whatever he was going through  he should not serve people. The drinks were bad and we had to ask for the Ingridients that came with the drink. Overall the service was horrible 
Hula Hut,173,Manoli is the best server. We ate at Hula Hut two evenings while in town and we fortunate enough to sit in Manoli s section both visits.  Five stars from us 
Hula Hut,174,I m getting into yelping things now adays and i can tell you that when it comes to food i am ALL in. My only issue is being being allergic to dairy but not gonna lie the device is trash. they forget about you. we sat waiting for a check for 35 minutes because of a  shift change  cool i understand people need breaks but maybe don t forget about your customers and never ask how they are or how they are doing. Food was alright for what it is but i d hardly consider it hawaiian because it s actually just mexican food but the decor is hawaiian vibes. Anyways i won t be coming back but give it a whirl yourself and make your own choice.
Hula Hut,175,If you are looking for a great view of Lake Austin and a nice cocktail  definitely check out Hula Hut  I came on a Thursday evening and luckily found seating in the bar patio right on the water. It was still happy hour when we got there so my boyfriend and I shared the hula-la fishbowl drink for  8. It was really delicious and refreshing on a hot evening  When you sit at the bar you have to get your own chips and salsa  but they are complimentary so it s awesome    I ordered the chicken and guacamole tubular taco  their version of a burrito . It came with rice and refried beans. Everything tasted really good and was piping hot. The portion was huge and I had enough leftover for another meal. My boyfriend got the pork burrito and it was really juicy and flavorful. Overall  the food was good    I gave Hula Hut 4 stars because the service in the bar area was kinda slow  but understandable  and the food was good  but nothing spectacular. I will definitely come back and want to try more items on their menu. This is a great location to bring visitors  Dont forget to check out their souvenir shop before you leave 
Hula Hut,176,Wanted to check this place out during my last visit in Austin. The drinks always look so good    We went during the week so it wasn t crowded at all and service was fast. We had a very friendly waiter. We wanted to sit outside on the patio area to see the view of the lake.   The scenery was really nice. Palm trees  huts  Hawaiian ambiance all around. We went during Happy Hour which is m-f 3 30-6 30. We were offered chips and salsa and ordered a Mai-tai and Haleakalada. We also ordered a side of queso. Our waitress mentioned that water and straws are only offered when asked due to the water shortage and sitting upon the lake.   The drinks were really good in my opinion. We didn t order food but it was definitely Tex Mex that they mostly serve. Being outside there were a lot of flies and birds on the deck. It also smelled a bit with the water system or drainage that was in the area. Over all it s a cool spot to check out for the views and experience. I would go again for the drinks.
Hula Hut,177,5 stars for the views and ambiance. Food is ok. Mahi Mahi was great. -1 star for the service  we had to wait and ask twice for almost everything. -1 star for cleanliness   bathroom was nasty and in need of remodel. Puddles  of unknown liquid on the floors  broken locks  no paper towels  trash can overfilled 
Hula Hut,178,I went to eat with a friend here  and we both had quesadillas  she had chicken  and I had shrimp. She enjoyed her meal  as did I. My favorite part of the shrimp quesadilla is the mango-pineapple salsa that comes with it. The meal was filling  and the sides were good. My only reason for marking it as a four is that the quesadilla did seem a little soggy  the flavor did make up for that  though. I m still willing to try another meal from them despite this.
Hula Hut,179,Our waitress Melissa made our lunch perfect     The food and atmosphere are both great -but her service and personality were the best  
Hula Hut,180,The wait was 45 minutes outside and 40 minutes inside  but there s a pier bar in the back is walk up service. Charlie was great. Awesome view.
Hula Hut,181,Savannah took great care of us. She knew our names and treated us like family  easy to do  my dad s name is Savannah . Savannah and the overall restaurant were one of the finest dining experiences I ve ever...experienced.
Hula Hut,182,Beautiful location. Friendly staff. Cold beer.  Unfortunately  when I walked inside I first asked them if they had Wi-Fi. Needed to work while I ate.  Yes .  Went outside  ordered  got the chips  salsa  and cold beer. Asked for the Wi-Fi password   we don t have Wi-Fi .  Luckily the apologetic bartender was able to stop my order.  Salsa had a good fresh flavor. Bartender service was spot on. Will come back with friends to try the food. Looked great.
Hula Hut,183,We got there during shift change so we had to wait nearly 15 minutes for service  but once Austin started serving us he turned our experience around and gave us a great experience  10 10 server
Hula Hut,184,The food was good but the service was better. Austin was phenomenal. Great service  energy and attentiveness. Truly made the experience 
Hula Hut,185,What a great spot on the water  This was the first restaurant I came to on my trip to ATX and the food drinks were great. I got the noodle salad with shrimp and it was delicious  Great atmosphere and friendly staff.
Hula Hut,186,Love Hula Hut. The decor alone is awesome but the food is very good too. Chips  salsa  and queso very good. Salsa does have some heat. I had the bbq grilled tacos from the happy hour menu..one would have been filling for me...they were so good. My hubby had the grilled steak nachos and my daughter the chicken tubular taco. She kept saying how fresh everything tasted in hers. Can t wait to get back into town to eat here again.
Hula Hut,187,it happened again. shelly was the rudest waitress i ve ever had for the second time.    gave us a fake apology and berated us even more for not caring about our friends when we asked to split the appetizer
Hula Hut,188,Months old spider webs in the chandelier of the group table shows a serious ongoing neglect in basic cleaning and maintenance. Absolutely unacceptable. There were webs on every single arm of the chandelier and the growth of the spider webs reflect serious neglect in basic cleaning practices.
Hula Hut,189,It s amazing to me that this place doesn t have an overall better rating. Not only does Hula Hut have great food  but sitting out by the lake in Austin is always so special. I m a big fan of this place. They have really good fish tacos  their chips are amazing  and you get endless bowls of them. I always leave here so full. The fried avocado is also really good but may be a little too much for me. The staff is always friendly. We ve never had a bad experience. We come here with friends all the time. Good place to celebrate  good drinks  fun atmosphere. Definitely recommend.
Hula Hut,190,Our experience at Hula Hut was great  We had Jack as our waiter and even though it was his second night serving he was hospitable  polite  and kind. Our drinks and food were great and the service was perfect  We will come back again for sure  Eating on lake Austin with a view was awesome too 
Hula Hut,191,Bella is the best host and Togo persons ever  She is so pretty  talented  intelligent  and perfect in every way    She has the best fits and the coolest big platform boots I always make sure to tip her atleast 50  and so should you  We ll miss you Bella  Queen of Hula Hut 
Hula Hut,192,Shelley was our server tonight and SHE IS THE BEST  She took such good care of us and made conversation the whole time. I had so much fun    Thank you for everything   
Hula Hut,193,My favorite place to go in Any season. Best nachos  delicious margaritas and Mexican martinis. Just the best place of you go to Austin.
Hula Hut,194,My all time favorite place   The view is amazing and my server  Molly  was so sweet and friendly. She is by far my favorite server there. 11 10 would recommend this restaurant to anyone in town.
Hula Hut,195,I loved the surrounding and the view. We sat outside and had the most magnificent view to the beautiful sunset over the lake. Not as far as the food is concerned I was a little confused from the beginning. Why was I being off with Mexicany type of food in a Hawaiian themed and named restaurant. I think they had one Hawaiian sounding dish. However  notwithstanding the fact that I was expecting Hawaiian food  I was served with fairly decent Mexican food. I m not so sure that it was the best Mexican food around but it was OK. This is not a restaurant I would seek out for the food but more for where it is situated and the view and the fact that I can sit outside and have a few cocktails and enjoy  great company. The food is good but not amazing
Hula Hut,196,First timer  Arrived and was seated immediately  great . Our waiter Nazarene H didn t address us until 30 mins after being seated and we had to ask another waiter to direct him to us.  He took our drink order  water and coffee only . Gave us the coffee  no sugar. 20 mins goes by and he still hasn t come back  so we asked another waiter for a fresh cup of coffee and sugar. Another 20 mins pass and Nazarene comes to take our food order. We waited another 45 mins  watched later families come in  order food  eat  pay and leave before we got ours. The food was good  but it wasn t worth waiting that long for it  tacos and enchiladas . My tuna was overcooked  but I refused to send it back because I didn t want to wait another 40 mins for my food. I want to give this place another try because I enjoyed the view  the prices were amazing  but the service has to be better   but I definitely don t want Nazarene to serve us again.
Hula Hut,197,Salsa and chips are great   Staff is always nice and prompt.  Fresh homemade tortillas and great fish tacos.
Hula Hut,198,I ve been eating at Hula Hut for about 16 years now. Sadly they have changed their chicken guac tubular taco.... Except they failed to update the menu description. Yesterday was the 2nd or 3rd time I ve ordered it and there was no guac avocado to be found. I even asked and the waiter checked with the kitchen. They said oh there s one scoop in there somewhere. I can most definitely confirm there was not. Just a warning... Don t expect any cheese nor guac anymore on this dish... It was my favorite... Now just ehhh  ok.
Hula Hut,199,Hubby was having a birthday and we are new to Texas  so we decided to give Hula Hut a try   It didn t disappoint.  The service  drinks and food are great  We tried the famous avocado appetizer and Hula bowl drink to begin our experience.  The tacos are amazing  It s the best salsa and Mexican food we ve had since arriving to Texas  That says a lot because we are critics of this genre of food since we come from a state where this was too-shelf. The vibe is fun  lively and great for celebrating  We will be back and enjoy the outdoor bar and seating.
Hula Hut,200,Second time coming here while visiting Austin  we LOVE this place  Definitely a touristy spot with great food and drinks.... not to mention the location is amazing next to the water  I highly recommend if you are visiting.   Experience  Very casual and laid back. We brought our 2 year old daughter with us and stayed til about 9pm on a Saturday night and there were plenty or kids there too. Love how this place is next door to live music and a great dessert cafeb
Hula Hut,201,The food was ok but the staff are not helpful and they are actually rude at times. There s now excuse to have the waiter come over your shoulder and stare at the screen to see how much tip you re giving him. It s unprofessional and rude. And they were not helpful either. No one helped us find a seat and then I had to go find some staff to come clean the table and help us. Overall not recommended.
Hula Hut,202,Tired of Mexican food  How about Tex-Mex with a twist of Hawaiian  If it sounds like a weird combination to you  it s okay. You re in Austin  where keepin  it weird is what local businesses around here go for.   Hula Hut has been an Austin favorite for as long as I can remember. Beautiful views should you choose to sit out back and over the water. Look down and you ll see Karp fish swimming below that are nearly 3 feet long  Great food and prompt service. My colleagues and I went for lunch on a Friday afternoon and it wasn t too busy. Although I hear Friday nights get pretty packed especially during the summer months. Folks who live along the water take their boats to the restaurant and park at their dock. Perfect spot to catch a happy hour 
Hula Hut,203,Rarely do I take the time to write a bad review. However this place definitely asked for it. The moment my cousin and I walked in  the hostess looked at us with disdain. My cousin who is an Austin native hyped Hula hut up to me on the way  as I ve visited many times and love to explore new restaurants and scenery. I travel the world for work and this was the last experience I d expect to get here in Austin. My cousin asked if we could sit inside but close to the windows and was immediately told no because the tables by the windows were too big and we needed to basically have 4 people to sit at a table for 4. There were a few 4 tops and a big 6 top table that were empty. She instead told us we could sit outside where there are heat lamps or inside but not where we wanted. We decided to just go outside  already feeling unwanted there  we were hesitant but didn t want to let that get us down. As we walked through the restaurant to the outside portion there were plenty of of table for 4 close to the windows with only 2 patrons. I felt like at that point it was more of a personal issue she had about us. I would like not to say what I really felt. We go into the outside seating area and are greeted and sat. The waiter Luke showed up pretty quickly and was nice. He came back after a bit and took our drink and appetizers. Our apps come out and then we order dinner  dinner comes out not too long after and we still hadn t received our drinks  he asked if there was anything he could get us and we asked for our drinks. I used to work in the industry so I understand things  happen but it wasn t super busy today. He goes and I assume puts our drinks in. I finish my meal and wait a bit longer then he brings out our drinks. Doesn t apologize  doesn t say a word just sets them down and walks away. Finally we had to flag him down to close out  now I don t want anything for free or ask for much but I would have thought he d at least offer to discount or just apologize for the situation  but nothing. Paid full price for a very unsatisfying experience. I would never want to go back or suggest this place to anyone. Whenever I decide to write a review it s usually good because I feel like It s so much easier for people to write negative things than bad so I always try to just avoid that and write the good things but today I couldn t let this go. As we were walking out we could see that those 4 top tables were filled with only 2 people per table and they were Caucasian. I left feeling really hurt and upset that I had to see and even think that way when it s something I felt immediately upon the first encounter with the hostess. Unfortunate the bad outweighed the good  the food was actually really good and so was the margarita.
Hula Hut,204,My sister was so excited to come here  and judging by the 2 hour wait we we quoted  so is everyone else. It only took an hour and a half to get seated though. We were there at night  so didn t get to see the water views. We sat in the  outside  section  which was enclosed and heated for the first half of our visit  but then got cold. The best part of the experience was the service - our waitress was very good. I ordered the fajitas and they were kind of cold although I was told not to touch the  hot  plate. Lots of chicken fajita meat on the plate though  more than I ve ever seen anywhere else. Everyone I was with said their food was fine  and we were a party of 6. I ordered a Cabernet and it came in a plastic cup and was not good- don t order wine here. I took a bunch of pictures of all the Christmas lights.
Hula Hut,205,Austin institution. Great drinks and tubular tacos. My favorite queso in town. Service is spotty though. Expect to wait.
Hula Hut,206,Touristy spot with a rockin  view. You can sit outside under the covered patio  long wait  or sit in the outside bar area  with tiki huts  where you seat yourself. You could also be boring and sit inside.   We sat out at the bar area. The salsa is serve yourself which is automatically a deduction of one star. It s just gross and unsanitary. The salsa didn t even have a cover on it.   To start we ordered queso. The queso was watery and nothing special. My boyfriend and I both ordered chille rellenos. I got the shrimp and he had the chicken. Honestly it was just average but it wasn t bad. I liked the touch of the mango salsa on top.   Come here for the view and the drinks. Don t stay for the food.
Hula Hut,207,We went here after a boat day for a few drinks and apps. We sat under a huge tiki hut on the water at the bar and it was really laid back and enjoyable stop.   I had a lower calorie margarita but it was a little sweet for my liking and tasted like a lot of sour mix. They took it off the check as they could tell I didn t enjoy it since I only had one sip  and took it off without me having to say anything to them which was great customer service.  We shared the guacamole appetizer and stuffed avocado. The guac was nothing to write home about but the stuffed avocado was AMAZING and so unique. It s a deep fried avocado stuffed with cheese and shredded chicken and surrounded by some delicious sauces. Get this - don t think twice.   This is a perfect spot for a casual meal on the water.
Hula Hut,208,Our sever Maddy was the BEST   Made sure to take care of us as quickly as he could and he has the best attitude. Giving it 5 stars because of him 
Hula Hut,209,Our server MADDY was amazing  Very energetic and fun which is perfect for this atmosphere. Very busy  so snagging a table is tough and drinks take just a second  but they are fun and taste wonderful 
Hula Hut,210,Always loved this place ...wished it had more a la carte items..but over all its all good and simply delicious.
Hula Hut,211,Start off by saying this was one of the most polite staffs I ve ever met  They re all young  probably college students  but they create a very welcoming environment. We went during happy hour and the drinks were cheap and pretty good. The food however was extremely mediocre for the most part. With the exception of the complimentary pico  spicy but really good  and the guacamole I wouldn t really recommend anything else. The queso was just ok  the shrimp wontons I wouldn t recommend  nor would I recommend the chicken flautas  overcooked and dry . The coconut shrimp are ok at best. My lady ordered the salmon tacos and she said they were tasty. I had small bite  and the salmon was cooked very well  I wouldn t expect it from a place like that. If you re looking for a place to get some drinks  a nice view and just some small appetizers then this is your place. Again I loved the staff.
Hula Hut,212,Get an enchilada  Those are the best here and the rest is just ok. I got the shrimp enchiladas and my friend got the chicken. The chicken was a bit dry and the shrimp was cooked ok. Their mango cream cheese quesadillas are pretty good if you like that sort of thing.  Like I said the food is just ok and their drinks are just ok  too. What is good here  The view is amazing. You sit right on the water and the outside patio really makes you feel like you re on vacation somewhere  This alone is worth coming here. Make sure you get yourself on the waiting list because most days there will be one - especially on the weekend   There is very little parking available in the front of the building but you can find parking across the street in their huge parking lot. It s a bit of a pain if you have kids  since it s up on a hill  so I would recommend dropping them off first. There is also very little handicap parking so beware.  Complimentary chips and salsa. Their salsa is not too spicy and has pineapple in it so it s refreshing and a little sweet 
Hula Hut,213,Food was adequate  service was decent  establishment dirty as hell. They need to buy some brooms and sweep. Chips and crushed food and silverware all over the floor.
Hula Hut,214,The only reason I m giving two stars is for the waiter  before you order any alcohol mixed drink make sure they actually put alcohol in it  16 people in our party and I m pretty sure not one drop of alcohol was in any of the drinks we ordered. The food was better then expected and our waiter was great
Hula Hut,215,Staff was decent. Food was good. I didn t enjoy the cleanliness of restaurant. Great location.
Hula Hut,216,Best fajitas I have ever had. Period. And big shout out Smatty  SP   For excellent service. We ll be back.
Hula Hut,217,This was a standard restuarant serving primarily tex-mex food and some Hawaiian themed options. What s really convenient is the location. The wait can be pretty long on the weekend during the Christmas light show but it wasn t as long as they originally told us it would be. They had good margaritas and I really enjoyed the pi a colada. The portions are very filling- I had the half portion of combo fajitas  steak  amp  shrimp . I wasn t impressed with the shrimp but it got the job done  the flour tortillas are good but SUPER filling . My friend asked for a vegan menu and sometime later they brought out a gluten-free menu... in the end after bringing it to their attention they said they lost the one vegan menu they had but said they can work to make accommodations to most things on the menu.
Hula Hut,218,The view is decent and it is a friendly environment for a party of probably 6 or so and may be worth coming to. The food however is just okay and nothing to be shocked about and have food definitely better than it at plenty of places.
Hula Hut,219,The food here is consistently reasonable but nothing particularly extraordinary. We had a group of 5  3 adults and 2 kids.  The kids and everybody enjoyed their meals which were served promptly. The only snafu of the evening was I ordered half a rack of ribs and a side salad along with ranch dressing. When the meals were served I got my half rack and the dressing but no salad.  This salad was served in a small bowl the size of something you would put an individual serving of coleslaw in.  I was nearly done with my half rack of ribs before the salad came I think that was an extraordinary long time for a very small item.  Other than the salad issue the food was fine they allowed us to linger a bit to chat since I had not seen this family for a year.  I m sure it would have been much more enjoyable had the temperature been 20  warmer and we could have sat outside.
Hula Hut,220,Food is great  but customer service is terrible    They are short staffed which I understand  but that doesn t mean that staff should be rude or that cleanliness is non existent.   The bar staff could care less about their job and were very condescending to every single customer. Even asking for utensils or a to go box we were told they didn t have any.  There is a waiting area outside their entrance with tables and chairs. People were waiting there and had decided to order food to go so they could eat there because there s no waitstaff in that area. Which is fine but there is no where to throw away the food. So people just leave it there for the birds and squirrels to eat. When we asked the hostess to have someone clean the table  she said    we don t have a busboy out there . What    You mean to tell me they can t have someone clean that area  There are food  glasses  alcohol  etc everywhere. That is unacceptable      Do yourself a favor and order your food to go.
Hula Hut,221,This Austin favorite is officially finally dead. I wouldn t eat here again if they paid me. Filthy unbussed tables  floors covered In gum  drink spills  food and mystery schmuck from god knows what.   The restaurant was packed above and beyond its max occupancy. Several tables were unoccupied piled sky high with dirty dishes  drinks and filth. A female walking about with the attitude of I hate my life and most of all I hate you.   Food is subpar compared to decades dining experiences here.  This place isn t a dive  this place is ready to fail their next inspection.   Last time I went here I waited for a waiter 30 mins then when I flagged one down and asked if I could have our waiter visit us sometimes I was given a look that made me think the waiter s face was going to melt off.  Today s Waiter didn t clean our table  sprayed us with detergent  her nasty rag just spread the food remains from the previous party all over the table. When I asked her to give me the rag and finished what she couldn t start  she rolled her eyes at me openly and turned around and left without taking our order.  This restaurant needs to be closed. It s over for Hula Hut  it is finally dead.   Oh btw COVID didn t originate from a wet market it came out of hula hut in quite sure of i
Hula Hut,222,We actually ate at the restaurant and we felt very COVID safe.  Wait staff and hostess were all in masks  but still cheerful  and tables and guests were properly spaced.  This is our first dinner out since March  as we were so pleased with how good we felt.    And FOOD WAS EXCELLENT.  From the salsa and chips on the table to the variety of food our table ordered  everything was delicious and fresh tasting.
Hula Hut,223,We had a party of 20 come in for a friends birthday. Everything was great  The food  the atmosphere and especially the service. Jackson took great care of us  He kept it very professional and had a sense of humor at the same time. He was knowledgeable of the menu and supplied great suggestions. Thank you guys for a good time 
Hula Hut,224,Jackson was the most amazing server. He served my last minute party of 20 flawlessly.
Hula Hut,225,Service was good but food is horrible. It seems rushed and thrown together. The drinks were decent but it s safe to say I don t think I will be back.
Hula Hut,226,I m giving this place 5 stars based on the fact that every aspect of my experience was positive. Everything from the service  food and scenery was amazing.   First off  having a nice lunch or dinner on this dock overlooking the lake and taking in the summer day is so nice. They are accommodating to COVID regulations and understandings. The service was so sweet and made sure we always had everything we needed.   I asked the server for recommendations and he didn t bs us just gave honest opinions and I ended up really enjoying the Mahi salad I got  highly recommend if you want a hefty salad . Even though our waiter was running around  busy and burnin up in the heat he was always coming back to us and I find that to be one of the most important experiences while dining out.   Will definitely be returning 
Hula Hut,227,Mediocre food and service. Great views. If you want to just eat and socialize and don t care if the food is good  this is an acceptable spot. If food quality is your priority  pick somewhere else. They are also not the cleanest restaurant.
Hula Hut,228,Phillip started us out and was so great and personable. Then it was shift change so Weston finished up with food and more drinks. Both servers were attentive and great. We had a long wait but it was Mother s Day  so to be expected. Otherwise  service was great  food was great  and we had a wonderful visit. Thanks to Phillip  Weston  and Hula Hut   
Hula Hut,229,This is one of the most classic Austin restaurants to take visitors to  It has a great view of Lake Austin a great coffee house next door  The food is delicious for being Tex mex  but it isn t my first pick. They do give good portion sizes for the price you pay   Our server  Ashley  was so great  She was extremely patient with us as it took over half an hour to make a decision on what we wanted to order  and she was easy to talk to    I m always down to go to Hula Hut mainly for the experience  atmosphere  vibe.   I got the chicken and guacamole tubular tacos because my server recommended it and I would definitely get it again 
Hula Hut,230,If you re looking for good frozen drinks while being on the water  then this is the go-to spot. The frozen margs  creamy jalape o sauce with chips   amp  chicken flautas are my favorite things on the menu. Can t go wrong with those. During COVID  they now serve frozen margs to-go   Perfect for any lake day. They have boat side service if you park at their dock  great  amp  convenient.
Hula Hut,231,This is a great outdoorsy place  dog friendly and with a beautiful view of the lake. Brian was my server and he was awesome. The food is delicious and the drinks even more amazing.
Hula Hut,232,I love Emily  She is the kindest server ever. And of course Hula Hut is amazing and the view was fantastic and the food was great. But I really do want to give a shout out to Emily specifically because she was so professional and kind 
Hula Hut,233,We decided to eat here before grabbing a coffee from next door.    The place has a very laid back feel  which made for a care free lunch. You also have a great view.   We didn t know what to order so I ordered the stuffed avocado as suggested by our waitress.  It was very good with lots of flavor. It is listed on the snack side of the menu  but is large enough to make a meal of it. The hatch green chili sauce tasted amazing with the avocado.   My hubby ordered the nachos with beef. They also tasted good  but be warned they charge extra for sour cream and guacamole. I understand that the charge is on the menu  but wished the waitress would of pointed it out when we ordered  I feel like most places include it with the charge of the nachos.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.   If you are in the area on a nice sunny day  check this place out.
Hula Hut,234,First time here. This is a good tex-mex restaurant that is affordable and offers a great view. The inside was decorated for the holidays. Plenty of seating is available inside and outside. The  outside  balcony   seating area was closed. However  they have an  enclosed  with plastic curtains outside section available. I still was cold because the curtains were torn allowing a breeze to come through.  Customer service was good and my food came out fast. I ordered my favorite a chicken quesadilla and a pink lemonade. The lemonade was on point. The quesadilla comes with onions and I was informed they pre-make them in the morning so I couldn t order without onions. My food was good  but spicy because of the onions. I can t wait to return in the summer to enjoy the outside area on the lake 
Hula Hut,235,Had the best baby shower at Hula Hut. Thank you to Shelly who recommended such a private and covid safe area. We rented the palapa to host our baby shower. The day of the event our server was Monica. She was such a delight and worked great with all the guests. The food was wonderful and I was told the drinks  can t enjoy at the moment  were fresh and packed a punch. The managers Desirae and Ed went above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly. Thank you so much to Hula Hut for the perfect experience.  Looking forward to planning many more parties there.
Hula Hut,236,I ve came here before and the food was amazing . Today  I didn t have the same experience. Waiter was nice but over worked . Food was was savour-less and to be quiet honest I couldn t change anything to my liking . Came all the way from Houston and truly  I wasn t impressed like the first time. PS- Im pregnant so  the tampon wasn t mine lol .
Hula Hut,237,This place was much better than I thought it would be    The atmosphere is obviously really hip. Always enjoy being by the water. Food was super good. Queso was yummy. Chimichanga was awesome. Dessert..... cookie w ice cream and key lime are so good
Hula Hut,238,The food was okay. Not the worst  but not the best. The salmon tasted burnt but the fish tacos are okay. I would not say that the food was entirely worth  60. The waitress forgot silverware and napkins and took 5 minutes to return to our table. The decor and atmosphere of this restaurant was pretty nice and visually appealing. I would say that if you enjoy themed restaurants and tacos  give it a try.
Hula Hut,239,Melissa is an amazing server who can put up with the worst humor ever and we love her. Food is great  drinks are better  view is unmatched in Austin. If you love turtles  amp  good vibes... this is your spot 
Hula Hut,240,Visiting Austin from Pittsburgh and my friend took me to Hula Hut for lunch. Our server Jack was fantastic   Jack gave great drink and food recommendations was so polite and courteous  he even gave us ideas for sights to see while in town. I got the chicken and guacamole tubular tango and it was delicious. Not only was it huge but it  had a lot of chicken in it. We both got Hula Brews  frozen margaritas with a mini Corona s and mango toppers.
Hula Hut,241,Be transported in to Florida and day drink the woes away. This review is purely about the killer patio and bomb drinks. Can t speak to the food. The view  Unmatched. The drinks  I got two drinks  The Lake Austin lemonade with the deep Eddy s lemon added. BOY IT WAS TASTY. Tastes exactly like a pink Starburst. Also tried the 1 2 hula-la-la. It tastes like the punch you make with the gang when you re at the lake..in a good way  Double plus it s served in the cutest pineapple cup  Parking is limited  that s the only downside.
Hula Hut,242,The food was a bit bland- I tried the chicken enchilada and the Hula Hut Hawaiian style burger so perhaps I just ordered the wrong food to get a decent idea of how the food is. The fries are definitely more flavorful than the burger- I guess due to lack of seasoning in the burger patty. Portion size was large  but not to the point where it was overwhelming.The queso  chips n  salsa were pretty great though- the salsa had a nice kick to it.  I guess they were pretty responsive to the feedback about the queso being watery because it turn out fine for my group.    The view from the patio was great and the staff were all very sweet.
Hula Hut,243,I liked the food but tables and utensils were too old. Both taco and fajitas tasted good
Hula Hut,244,Doesn t look like much when you walk past but definitely worth the try. We are in town from Dallas  TX for the Lonestar Classic Volleyball Tournament and I surprised my daughter. She loved it and was so excited   It was a beautiful sunny afternoon we ate on the patio by the water... HEAVEN in our book   She ordered the half rack of ribs and devoured them   I got the pork tacos  amp  the Texas Tini  YUM    Definitely worth a try  go see for yourself  
Hula Hut,245,Food was delicious   Emma has a wonderful personality   She took great care of us   If you re lucky Emma will be your server   
Hula Hut,246,When people talk about outdoor oasis in Austin  its the Oasis  BUT  this is truly the gem of the area as all around winner for outdoor patio  Enter the Hula Hut  which on any given night is JAMMIN  Worry not  the place is huge and has so much room to accommodate  your wait will never be that long  and nothing a drink at the bar cant fix  Make sure to stop inside and put your name in  then head to one of the outside bars. We liked our view and bartender so much we decided to just stay at the bar and were more than welcome to eat there as well.   We started out with drinks  and boy that menu was huge. The bartender gave suggestions and they were on point. We sampled several different drinks each and they were all great. There is self serve chips and salsa on the deck  and we started with the stuffed avocado appetizer. Can I say that again  STUFFED AVOCADO  take note of this  as this might be my favorite food ever. The outside was lightly breaded and deep fried however the avocado was still cool and refreshing. It was stuffed with the perfect tender chicken along with cheese. It was so good we considered ordering 2 more as the meal too. Curiosity got the best of me thought and I wanted to sample other things. My meal was the chicken chile rellenos which was amazing. My friend had the burrito which she enjoyed too.  Great service  great drinks  great view of the lake  what more could you ask for       Also  not overpriced 
Hula Hut,247,Maddy is the best server  Great and fun location. An Austin experience for sure  The jalape o ranch dip is a must.
Hula Hut,248,the worst place to work    the gm manager doesn t even speak to you about your own job    ghosted for days. never work or eat here its disgusting.
Hula Hut,249,Unique blend of Tex-mex and Polynesian food with a great view. Great happy hour specials and the flautas are on point. Heads up  if you get a marg and order it Tini style it means it s served martini style. Don t go and sit at the bar on a busy day. Might be confused if you re ever going to be served or not.
Hula Hut,250,I think  I don t know for sure  this is owned by Chuy s   Self-serve chips and salsa bar  beautiful outdoor river views  plenty of seating - if you search the first-come bar seating areas first.  I will admit the drinks were a little too watered and sugary for me and I tried their house drinks vs a beer. Next time I ll stick with beer.  The food is unique yet felt a little mass-produced or rushed. It was good but certainly not a farm to table joint or mama s home recipe style place.  You come here for the vibe. You stay for the vibe. Yes  they have food and drinks.  Parking can be rough  you should valet or expect to walk 500 miles to get to the place. A nice idea is to drop off your friends  they get a table  while you park.
Hula Hut,251,My wife and I came here tonight for a evening dinner. Jack was our waiter. We asked him if you questions about the menu and he said it was his second day so we decided to just order some food and roll the dice.  Jack was very attentive and made sure that we had a great experience and he was very knowledgeable about the things that he had already experience and tried.  Yeah our margaritas to us quickly which is my absolute favorite thing especially after a long week of work.  We were able to get a great spot on the dock patio which overlooked Lady Austin.  We ordered the Mexinesism and shrimp flautas and they were the best thing ever. Highly recommend Hula hut and make sure if you go there you ask for the new waiter Jack because he s the man with the plan 
Hula Hut,252,The Hula Hut is a fun little Tex-Mex Hawaiian restaurant that sits on the lake. It reminds me a lot of the California chain restaurant Islands. Here s my take   FOOD  As I mentioned above  the food is like a fusion of Tex Mex and Hawaiian island style food. They have a variety of options on their menu ranging from tacos and quesadillas to pupu platters and fish plates. We were a large group and ordered a range of things  stuffed avocados  two pupu platters  tacos  quesadillas  and nachos. The stuffed avocados were the most noteworthy food item during our meal  the rest of it wasn t. It was pretty standard Tex-Mex Hawaiian fare  not much to write home about.   AMBIANCE  Hula Hut is situated on a lake  and they have both indoor and outdoor seating. They definitely went all out with the Hawaiian theme in the restaurant and outdoor seating area as well. Hula Hut tends to accumulate a bit of a wait on the weekends. We went on a Friday and were told it was an hour wait  so we sat outside  hung out on the attached dock. Our table was actually ready much faster than that  so we were happy about that  It s nice to sit outdoors and watch the sunset over the lake. Service was great and they also use the Toast system that I ve been seeing popping up at restaurants  so we were able to pay right at the table rather than wait for the check.   ALSO WORTH NOTING  This isn t really close to downtown Austin or the more popular places to stay in Austin  6th St  Congress . We had to drive about 15 minutes outside the city to get there. There s a valet parking option but there s also a lot across the street from the restaurant that s free parking.  Overall  we had a fine experience at Hula Hut. No major complaints. Perhaps it s just not my overall restaurant vibe that I care for. However  I don t think it s necessarily worth trekking outside of Austin for  especially if you re visiting for a short period of time.
Hula Hut,253,This place has one of the best views.  The food and drinks are honestly not that great but who cares with this amazing VIEW  
Hula Hut,254,Horrible experience. Bad food. Bad service. Don t go here. Our server was a piece of garbage with attitude. Except for janelle who was so sweet and accommodating. She was great.
Hula Hut,255,I recently visited Hula Hut for the first time while visiting my cousin in Austin. We were able to find a table outside in the  first come  first served  area with a great view of the lake. For those who are sitting in this area  you are to get your own chips and salsa from a shared station on the dock. I was apprehensive about this setup for sanitary reasons -- anyone can just walk up and grab chips and salsa  not to mention the salsa container was just sitting out only halfway covered with a broken lid  and thus I decided to pass on the salsa.   Our waiter  Josh  was very nice and accommodating. At his recommendation  I ordered the fish tacos and requested to sub the refried beans for a side salad. My order was wrong when it came out  they gave me beans instead of a salad   but Josh promptly came over  genuinely apologized and quickly brought me a salad. This was my first time having FRIED fish tacos and they were amazing    The rice  unfortunately  was extremely dry and the salad was tasteless.   Other cons were the swarm of birds  which  fair enough  is to be expected on the lake  and swarm of yellow jackets  which made it hard to enjoy my food and the view. And lastly  the restaurant looked like it could use a cleaning  inside and out. The fish tacos were redeeming  however  I likely will not visit Hula Hut again.
Hula Hut,256,My experience today a Wednesday 4pm during sxsw was seriously so great. We sat on the patio  the weather was gorgeous     Order queso and creamy jalape o - no brainer. My friend ordered 3 pork street tacos. I ve given up meat for the last few months but he said I had to eat one and they looked realllllyyy good. We were drinking so I thought it was a smart thing to do. I wasn t sure if it was my lack of meat consumption lately but no  my friend confirmed  and he s Mexican so you know it s legit  they were out of this world great. Like what   So tender and juicy and flavorful  I m now eating meat again and I ll be going back Friday - for real the music line up is on point  Do yourself a favor and get the street tacos on the happy hour menu. So. Damn. Good.   I was going for all the calories today and had the pins colada  it too was really good  not overly sweet and sugary  Great food  drinks  sunshine and a view  Way to go Hula hut 
Hula Hut,257,Tex mex at its finest. The view and atmosphere were great. We came during peak hours  Sunday lunch hour  so we weren t surprised to wait for an hour. We enjoyed sitting outside to watch the view and take some family pictures. We had such a large family  25  that I think our waitress managed pretty well. She was attentive and helpful. I got the weekender and really enjoyed it 
Hula Hut,258,Pretty average food I would say. The interior and venue are absolutely amazing  Its wonderfully decorated and the seating outside is absolutely gorgeous. You definitely come here for the ambiance and view.  The food is a bit americanized and you can tell with all the oil and cheese they use  heavily processed and you feel a bit sick after eating it . It s not to the point of where it s completely unpalatable  but it s not the best. We had one of the pu pu plates and the tubular tacos  the portions are quite large so thats good but the taste left something to be desired. Honestly they could just go easier on the oil and cheese and I think it would be fine.
Hula Hut,259,We had the Hawaiian combo fajitas and the food was great  Perfectly marinated  my 2 star rating comes from the atmosphere. It was SO hot in there that me and my boyfriend were sweating bad  mind we were both in shorts and t shirt because it is a hot Texas day. We mentioned it to our server and she agreed and said that at least it was not as hot as it is outside inside the restaurant.  My poor boyfriend ended up throwing up his meal in the parking lot because of how hot he was. We are both active people and usually don t have an issue with hot temperatures  but not good for in a restaurant eating hot food.
Hula Hut,260,Perfect date night spot. Nice views outside on the patio and bartenders were very friendly and had good recommendations on what food to order
Hula Hut,261,I had the pineapple grilled chicken plate and a happy hour mango margarita. The flavor in the chicken was amazing  My margarita was strong and very tasty. Loved our view of the lake and the happy hour deals were really nice  Will definitely be coming back again
Hula Hut,262,Wow this place could be so much better. We came here on a Sunday with friends from out of town. We wanted to grab a bite by the water and enjoy the weather.  We knew there would be a wait and happily spent 45 minutes enjoying the breeze and waiting for our seats.  Unfortunately our experience was all downhill once we got into the restaurant.   We were walked out on to the patio over the water. The stench upon waking out over the water was horrible. The servers had a station in this area where they kept the chips and drinks. It was far from clean or appetizing.   Once seated  our server was nice but never around. It took about 30 minutes to get our beverages. The tables did not feel clean.   We were then informed that there was an issue in the kitchen and food orders would be delayed.   We hung out for another hour and finally got our food which was pretty average.  The menu did have Vegan options which was nice.  Overall  this restaurant could be sooo much better. The location is the only thing that would bring you here. I wish they would work on the overall cleanliness  service and food preparation. It is popular already but could be so much more.
Hula Hut,263,Hula Hut is right on the water  which makes it the perfect place to grab a bite in Austin. The ambiance is very chill  with most people stopping in still in their swimsuits from their water adventures. We opted to sit inside since there was a wait for a table outside by the water.   Because this place is so open and airy  there are quite a lot of flies. So much so that we had to ask to be moved to another table further away from the window and doors. After making the switch  the rest of our meal went relatively smoothly.   You get started with a basket of chips and side of salsa. I ordered the shrimp enchilada. It was SO good  Very cheesy  warm  and the perfect accompanying sides  rice and black beans . I tried they coconut strawberry mojito  but could have done without it. The coconut overpowered the strawberry and I couldn t even taste any mint. I wouldn t order it again  but it did make for a pretty picture for yelp    If I could give half stars  I would rate this place a 3.5  but since I can t I ll round up to a 4. I would definitely come back and maybe wait for a table outside the next time around.
Hula Hut,264,Came for drinks on Sunday about 8 30 to 9 00 pm after Christmas light show at Mozart s.  The place was not packed  but most of the empty tables throughout the restaurant were full of dirty dishes.  Very noticeable. We sat in the back by the bar  found one to two empty tables with the rest about 9 or so tables full of dirty dishes.  The servers seemed to have an interest in carrying on personal conversations with one another rather than attending to their responsibilities.  Very disappointing and not expected.
Hula Hut,265,My husband and I came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. My husband had been here before and said the view was beautiful and the food was good. We decided to sit in the outside covered area. It was deary all day but still was a nice view.   I ordered the surfer salad  Our fresh three lettuce salad blend mixed with carrots  purple cabbage  tomatoes  cucumbers  sliced avocados  mixed cheese  amp  bacon. This tropical salad is topped with your choice of fresh grilled or fried mahi mahi fingers. Balsamic vinaigrette and jalape no ranch served on the side. I got the salad with grilled Mahi mahi  no cheese  and no ranch. The salad was quite large and good but nothing that made it stood out.   My husband ordered the Fajita Beef Pipeline Enchilada  Grilled fajita steak and Monterey Jack  amp  cheddar cheeses rolled in fresh corn tortillas and topped in Guajillo Sauce  served with rice  amp  refried beans. He said it was good but liked the chicken enchilada better the other time before.   While here I did try their austin tini  An Austinite favorite uniting local spirits. Z Silver Tequila and Paula s Texas Orange with handmade sweet n  sour. The drink was tasty and quite strong. I would highly recommend and would order it again.  The service was super fast and our waiter was on top of things. So overall the drinks and the view was amazing.
Hula Hut,266,My date and I loved our visit to Hula Hut. Our server Lizzie was amazing   our food was delicious.   Lizzie was cheerful and attentive.
Hula Hut,267,Kylie was absolutely great   The experience was so wonderful   This place is definitely a vibe  
Hula Hut,268,Instant transport to Hawaii- restaurant atmosphere has Hawaiian vibes through its menu and decorating.   Guac   queso- really good and can t go wrong with either item  Crispy shrimp tacos- delicious  The cilantro lime sauce gives the shrimp a great flavor   Salad- added shrimp which was a bit too spicy but very tasty with the salad ingredients
Hula Hut,269,Just brought some friends from out of town here to lunch and it was great   Service was attentive  food came out quickly and was very good   Surfer salad with mahi mahi  fajitas  and salmon dinner.  Great Austin institution is still going strong 
Hula Hut,270,It was our first time to experience Hula Hut and we had a very unfortunate time. Not because of the food  but the servicer by the name Lex  girl wearing rainbow striped shirt and black shorts with tattoos--we were there on September 2nd  was so so awful. It felt like such an inconvenience to even be there. I ve been a server all my life and I will admit  my expectations are high- but this was no other level I have experienced before. Me and my friends felt so uncomfortable to the point where it was cringy just to ask for the tab.    Our drinks were all watered down  as if they had been sitting finished at the bar for awhile before she brought them to us. Anything we tried to order  we had to specifically ask her to stop  because she never came by to check on us. She also tried to take our away when we were clearly still eating  which normally wouldn t be so offensive except that every single interaction we had with her was uncomfortable.   We wanted to get a second drink and I had to pull her aside and say I d like another drink. After she took it  she started to walk away before anyone else could order. When we ordered second drinks  she even  is that all  Are you sure   IT WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE.   Just  bad. I hate it when a potentially fun  good place gets ruined by bad service.
Hula Hut,271,You don t go to Hula Hut for the food or cleanliness  you go for the view. During our last trip to Hula Hut  we found dead cockroaches and dead crickets underneath our table. If the tables have that  I could only imagine what the kitchen looks like
Hula Hut,272,Bartender is a complete ass. He should spend more time counting his shots and less time being a douche.
Hula Hut,273,Came in because I ve always heard good things about hula hut. It was okay  not great  definitely a tourist staple. The best thing about the place is the location right on the water.   They felt understaffed for a Sunday afternoon. Margaritas took 30  minutes to get to our table  they apparently only had 1 bar tender.   We asked to sit outside but then we were really just on the back patio with all of the windows down. The place was a complete mess  there were at least 4 tables  more convenient to the water and sun  that hadn t been bussed  and were not cleared the entirety of while we sat there.   They can definitely accommodate a lot of people in this place. The food was decent  but nothing to brag home about. I would do yourself a favor and grab texmex somewhere else.
Hula Hut,274,Location is everything and Hula Hut has it. Plus the Polynesian or Hawaiian vibe makes for a fun night. We had a fun family night out here with friends.
Hula Hut,275,Pro  Friendly prompt service  Near the water  Cute-ish hula theme   Con Food tastes pre cooked and reheated The flautas was barely crispy  The salsa tasted like dish soap
Hula Hut,276,The margaritas and shrimp quesadilla are amazing. Really fun spot to get a drink by the water on a summer day.
Hula Hut,277,To put it short  this is a typical Tex Mex place with a view of the lake. Other than that  food was average but I do think the self serving chips and salsa is a great idea.   They day we went  the bar area was severely understaff and you can tell from our servers face and attitude that was not having a great day. He basically want us out quick.  Decent food  nice view  but not so great service. It s worth a visit but I wouldn t be a repeat customer.
Hula Hut,278,I waited for one hour to get a table  when they served me the salmon i ordered it was raw  i asked them to take it back and it came back even more raw. and honestly the customer service was quite terrible. would NOT recommend.
Hula Hut,279,A Beautiful day in ATX makes for a great time to head down to Hula Hut for good food with a great view  Here are a few tips   Parking  Don t waste your time trying to find a spot right in front  park across the street and take a very short walk in. Hostess  Don t always trust their quoted wait time. She said 45min. and it was about 10min. before we were seated.  Glad we stuck around.  Service  Mediocre  nothing special at all. Food  Large portions and tasty  Order apps then see if room for more  Price  Above average for the food and service  but worth it for the view and vibe.
Hula Hut,280,The worst carne asada  fajitas  I have ever had  by far. Cool atmosphere  great location  pretty good drinks  out of rum by 5 00    garbage food.
Hula Hut,281,I went here with one of my girlfriends for a nice dinner next to the water. The view here is very lovely. At night they string up lights while during the day it s peaceful with ducks and fish. Unfortunately did not like the food here. Everything tasted bland we nibbled on the platter app. But couldn t really eat anything. All in all the food wasn t exciting. We sat outside under a large umbrella which had massive webs and a huge spider. We moved seats in order to get away from the spiders but they seemed to be under every umbrella. The service was slow.
Hula Hut,282,Decent portion on the food...we enjoyed cool Weather on the patio. The ducks are quacking in the water while we eat. The food was so so but the eating on the water makes up for it...self serve chip bar outside.
Hula Hut,283,The service was bad because our waiter avoided us a couple of times when I asked for napkins and other things. I had high hopes for this place  but it is expensive for the quality of the food. My best friend found a hair in her food and my friends food was really cold. I will not be coming back to this place.
Hula Hut,284,Sat at the bar outside  which has beautiful views  but  wow were the drinks watered down. So bad. We got chips and queso  which was pretty good  but complete waste of money on the drinks. Won t be back  I used to love this place back in college but it s pretty awful.
Hula Hut,285,The place is super amazing I love the scenery and the vibes going on.  My party of two was seated immediately and social distancing and mask precautions were followed well.  I ordered the Montego Bay Shrimp Tacos and I added avocado and grilled pineapples...one word AMAZING   The taste was immaculate and the serving size was more than enough. I will definitely be revisiting this place again.
Hula Hut,286,My favorite place in Austin. The lake is beautiful. The food and drinks are amazing. The prices are affordable. My favorite place to eat when i come home to Austin
Hula Hut,287,Food and ambiance were amazing. Brian was the best server. And his enthusiasm for the tres leaches cake made me order it and now I m obsessed. Thank you 
Hula Hut,288,Hula Hut is the place you go to for the scenery and mixed drinks. It s a great spot to catch the sunset and om cooler days you can sit inside and still have a decent view of the lake. Often times the wait can kick up when boaters park and come inside to dine. The last time I went I got food poisoning so I have nixxed the Stuffed Avocado option from my list and opted for shrimp tacos this time. They were delish and I didn t get sick. But my friend asked for coconut shrimp tacos and was told she could only get them on prepared skewers. When they arrived it was literally 4 plain shrimps on skewers - no sides  no veggies on the stick. Is that the best yall can do   Overall it s an ok spot but definitely not stellar in dining options  kinda pricey for what ATX offers in similar entrees  but you really pay for the atmosphere.
Hula Hut,289,Food was fast but employee with long beached hair met in bathroom cut me off for stall and forcefully insisted that I as a customer to put my paper towels on top of trash can by door. Once I exited she verbally assaulted me. Cursed me all the way to my vehicle.
Hula Hut,290,Great service  even in the midst of the pandemic. Received awesome service from Melissa  Food was delicious  amp  restaurant took precautions keeping everyone s safety in mind.
Hula Hut,291,Never heard of this place until this past Saturday.  The atmosphere is vibrant.  The view is amazing right off lake austin.  People boating and fishing.  Views of nature and houses on the hill that I can t afford lol.  Food was amazing too.  I got the lovely stuffed avocado.  Yummy   My waiter was amazing also I forgot his name tho.  I think it was Daniel or Jeremiah.  Sorry I was drinking lol.  Only reason I didn t give this 5 stars is because their wheelchair access is like I-35  behind the 8-ball.  My friend is handicap and the place could be more accessible for ppl like her most definitely.  Besides that our time was great.
Hula Hut,292,What I said last time. Hahaha no really my review three years ago made me laugh because it s pretty much how I feel today. And I ve been back a few times since my last review.   That shrimp enchilada man. I ll always come back when I m in Tejas and always get that forearm size enchilada. I love Hula Hut.
Hula Hut,293,One of my favorite settings in Austin. Right on the lake and has a vacation feel. Frozen margarita is really good and it s self serve chips and salsa. The salsas seem really fresh.  Got the shrimp quesadilla and it was pretty good with quick service.
Hula Hut,294,This is a chill spot to eat and have a few drinks. Food is pretty good drinks are great ambiance is the best. Gotta love sipping a. Cocktail with a. Beautiful lake view. Highly recommend   
Hula Hut,295,Great service. Try the pepper ranch dip thing  its good. Meet this really great waitress in training  will be coming back. Thank you Lizzie - Your Minnesotans
Hula Hut,296,Tried this place again for a company outing and still stand by my judgement at a solid four stars. The location being off the lake is phenomenal and really makes this place a winner. I just wish the tex-mex style food here was comparable to a place like Chuy s
Hula Hut,297,Great experience. The wife loved it. Tried the Hawaiian fajitas and it was phenomenal.
Hula Hut,298,I used to love this place  It was truly Gone downhill. The food was absolutely horrible and the drinks were too. Chips were very stale
Hula Hut,299,Normally I would have nothing bad to say about hula hut Very good food and nice people  but today I walked in and was informed the power was out  which was completely fine we understood. We were having a giggle with the hostess about the power being out while we were approached by this short mean mustache man who then proceeded to tell us in a mean and aggressive tone that the power was out. We had let him know that we have been informed and we we re just on our way out and we re asking when the power would be back on he said  don t know  he then shooed us out as if we were robbing the place and then kicked the door stand up and slammed the door in our face and we heard the door lock. I hope you see this mustache man and fix your attitude.
Hula Hut,300,The 3 is really giving them to much credit. Food was okay  the water view really was the highlight. But our waiter Jason served and took ppls order who sat down after us  it wasn t busy at all  We waited about 15 Mins before we had to ask another server if he was still our waiter and then he came back to take our order. So  the atmosphere was cool but I was definitely disappointed in the waiter.
Hula Hut,301,I LOVED this place  The seating was a bit confusing - most of it is first come first and serve seat yourself  but there is an upper section that has a host and you have to be seated  they don t take reservations . The queso was pretty good and so were the drinks we got  margaritas and the special hula hut drink. Beautiful views  right on the water  and I loved the decor and tiki vibes. Absolutely going back.
Hula Hut,302,Every year we celebrate my best friend s birthday at Hula Huts and this year was no different  except for a few things.... I was recently diagnosed with Celiac s so now I look for gluten free menu options and honestly this is the main reason for my low review. Out of all the incredible and delicious options that Hula Hut offers  there are only TWO gluten free entrees and they both are missing a part of the meal. With the burger  there is no gluten free bun offer and with the salmon  you do not get to order the rice. There are some salad options  one appetizer  and one dessert that are also safe but the fact that there are only two incomplete entree options is appalling. It s almost 2019 and I find this not only shameful but also absolutely ridiculous that more options are not available. Especially when half of the menu options come on corn tortilla and still aren t gluten free    In addition to all of this  after waiting 40 minutes to be seated  which is fine because I do understand that Saturday night is a busy time  the table we were taken to had very obviously never been cleaned. There were pieces of chips  quite a lot of rice  melted cheese  and bits of straw wrappers strewn about. Disgusting.   The food has always been excellent  but it is so incredibly frustrating to me that my meal options are so limited. Hula Hut typically celebrates birthdays but despite informing them we were celebrating a birthday  no effort was made by our server to in any way celebrate with us even though there were very obviously presents and cards. Not even a simple  Happy Birthday     After coming here several times a year for almost 7 years now  it seems to me like the quality of experience has gone down significantly. The food is still good but no efforts have been made to improve anything as dietary restrictions have become better researched and foods fitting those health requirements have become more readily available. Multiple employees also seemed lackluster and without any enthusiasm  which also being in the service industry  I find disheartening. All in all  coming here was a bit of a let down this year. Hopefully they ll be able to turn things around because they really did have a great thing going.
Hula Hut,303,The food was not good. The service was questionable. Won t be going back. The two stars is for the water view.
Hula Hut,304,This was my second visit to Hula Hut  albeit the first visit occurred 2 1 2 years ago. We waited for a couple minutes to be seated outside  which was no problem at all. When we were finally seated it took approx. 15 minutes to be served waters and brought a drink menu. It was not busy like a usual Saturday  either. The menus were beaten  worn down  and looked like they could use a good cleaning. I did not think the cleanliness nor  shabby aesthetic  were on par with the price of the food or location. I think it is time Hula Hut did some renovation - such as the seating.   Now for the good stuff   We ordered chicken and cheese enchiladas and both enjoyed pi a coladas. All of the food was divine and the salsa was great too. I don t mind paying a higher price for food when it s delicious.   Thank you to our server  Savannah  who was very  professional and made sure our order was perfect.   Long story short  food was great but the cleanliness and need of renovations counteracts that.
Hula Hut,305,Amazing  after being sat and a 15 minute wait  we asked the hostess if there was a wait person  the hostess  brought us chips and salsa and said she would let the wait person know we were there. In another 10 minutes we asked a server for assistance  they nicely said they didn t wait on customers and said they would let our wait person know   Another 10 minutes we enjoyed the chips and salsa and never having a drink offered we decided to go to a real restaurant   What was interesting is that other tables arrived  received drinks and food and we never had anyone wait on us   One of those days   We won t be back or recommend Hula Hut 
Hula Hut,306,two thumbs down   way down   service is sooo bad its comical we had our name on the list...waiter told us we were lucky to get a table in their empty estab...they made us get our own chips n salsa...get our own water...refill our own waters...no joke...get our own silverware...order after an hour was wrong...2 mngrs later they told us to to the hot plates back to the kitchen...we asked for our 15. bar tab to leave w the food untouched...we were too disgusted to eat it wout throwin up...       they wouldnt let us leave for an hour hopin wed barf down the beans n cheeze... never again...once shame on em...twice shame on me... tc n god bless
Hula Hut,307,We visited Hula Hut last evening.  We were seated quickly.  Our waiter did everything he could to make out visit great   The view was great and as nightfall approach is was exceptional.  Unfortunately the food was substandard.  I ordered a shrimp and spinach tubular taco.  The shrimp were hard and had been cooked hours before. My date ordered pulled pork tacos.   These were so spicy that they were inedible.  The waiter brought us some pineapple to cut the spices  obviously something he s had to so in the past. The salsa served with our chips was fermenting.  We decided not to risk eating it.  What happened Hula Hut   Your food use to be good    
Hula Hut,308,I went here for a birthday party that was planned a few weeks in advance. We get there and it is a beautiful scenery and beautiful decorations but it is a group of us because we were having a birthday brunch. The waitresses tell us we cannot move tables after being on the phone with someone at the restaurant 4 times saying they allow that. The manager came to hash out the situation and I can say he got a little frustrated with us but maybe that was just the way he talks to his customers on a day to day basis. He offered a free margarita but didn t solve our situation. The food looked good and all in person and on the menu but when you tasted it  it was not the best. We ordered lots of food and the only thing that was good were the mango poblano quesadillas. I will not go back for the food but if you want to go have drinks with friends and enjoy the lake view definitely recommend.Coconut Shrimp
Hula Hut,309,Great location right one the water. The atmosphere is a huge vibe. The food is also a great price for what you get. If you re looking to have a blast from your childhood the from the past the Lake Austin lemonade tastes just like the Patrick Star push popsicle. But I do warn you beware of the grackles they are all over the place. These are no ordinary grackles either they are fat  very fat and look like they could eat you before you even knew what was happening. Beware but great food and atmosphere.
Hula Hut,310,Unique and eclectic are the only words that come to mind when describing the Hula Hut. An interesting combo of Tex-Mex and Hawaiian food.   I have a severe allergy to tomatoes. Let the server know that right away  so if I order something that has tomatoes they can steer me away.   We ordered queso  which came with tomatoes. At our servers suggestion ordered a different -tomato free- queso but as it hit the table she remembered it did have them after all. Our first entree hit the table then she told us the sauce has tomatoes in it. Luckily I didn t eat any of these.   We searched the menu for a different entree and landed on the Hawaiian Fajitas. It was different but had a good flavor.   When it came time for the check our server asked if it was separate checks. My wife and I got s good laugh out of that...
Hula Hut,311,Have been coming here for 15 years-ish. It s just a great place to chill out and look at the gorgeous Lake Austin. You ve got to try the North Shore Veggie Fajitas. Absolutely amazing. The veggies are so fresh  the seasoning is perfect. Come at a weird time or on a cloudy or cool day to avoid that parking lot mess. I m here on a Thursday afternoon just enjoying life.
Hula Hut,312,Service is great  food is great. The cleanliness could be better but it is a busy inside and outside seating restaurant. The restroom was clean.  The parking is a bit of the struggle but the staff is really timely and pleasant. Thanks for a great visit.
Hula Hut,313,Drinks were good. Dinner was alright. Service was ok. We sat at the table for like 10-15 min before anyone came to introduce themselves as our waiter and that s only bc I asked. When we got our meal the waiter came back to our table once the whole time to ask if we were ok.
Hula Hut,314,Came since our friends recommended this place  Such a cool place and Karin was such a good waitress   Opulent recommend enough 
Hula Hut,315,I always come here for the Hawaiian style chicken sandwich or hamburgers. AMAZZZINNNNGGG  and it fills you up   Also love the option to eat outside on the water  very relaxing and fun.  The prices are decent too  AND THEY ASKED IF WE WANTED STRAWS  they were not forced on us.
Hula Hut,316,I avoided this place because naturally  I assume all places on the water are trash. Today  I was pleasantly surprised when we stopped in for lunch.   Lunch crowd was tolerable  got seated immediately  server was a total sweetheart. She had a cool Yoda tattoo and thankfully  wasn t creeped out when my 5 year old touched it.   She suggested shrimp enchiladas and they were on point. All of our food was solid.   I don t think I d attempt a Friday night here  but for a Monday lunch  it was perfect.
Hula Hut,317,Solid 2  s here.  The biggest thing going for this place is their location.    They were either out of what we wanted OR wouldn t make adjustments to a menu item so we could enjoy the food. Like leaving off the BBQ sauce  HOW is that difficult   Not helpful at all  ...AND this is all IF you can get someone s attention to finally be seated. THEN  don t expect for your drinks to be refilled the entire time.
Hula Hut,318,DON T COME HERE Wrote this as I ate here bc it s terrible. It s incredibly dirty and I think the management must be gone...  I know it s not the server s fault bc it s just super busy and they can only do so much. But be prepared for the volume  bad management  no  piss poor management.  Won t be back. Get better everyrthing at another touristy place  like Chuy s.
Hula Hut,319,Good food  great view and service.  It was a hot day and the beer went down easy and the enchilada was really good. The decor is a little kitschy and has great views of the lake 
Hula Hut,320,My husband and I went to Hula Hut recently and we were served on by Shelly  She was AMAZING  So professional yet so funny and super sweet  I had the shrimp  flautas they were phenomenal  Come on- shrimp  cream cheese  bacon   jalape o wrapped in a wonton wrapper... YUMMMMMM    Can t wait to go back  I dream of those flautas 
Hula Hut,321,Right off the lake  is the perfect place to anchor with your boat and refuel on awesome drinks and delicious foods. The decor is. Lot of fun  Texas bbq meets river fishin  and margaritaville combined. The food is off the charts good. They have a chips and salsa bar which you can help yourself to as much as you want. Their queso is to die for so I never skip on it when I go. I ve tried many dishes here and always come back to the same conclusion  their shrimp enchiladas are in my opinion by far the best thing on the menu. I always end up grabbing leftovers from Whoever goes with me and doesn t finish them. Portion sizes are big so great for sharing  unless you are like me and absolutely need your own stuff   guilty I said it. Last time i got their puppy platter which is big and has a little bit of everything including bbq ribs which were deliciously flavorful and fall off the bone but way too spicy for me so I couldn t have more than one. Go with friends have a few drinks  get a full belly  before heading back out on the lake  and let me know if you agree with me. If you re  laking  in Austin you should make it a point to try and stop by.
Hula Hut,322,Used to live down the street and would go once a week to hula hut. I gave it five stars and love this spot. Only con is I don t always think the food is prepared fresh because they can t do some modifications that should be easy.
Hula Hut,323,Great views and drinks. Food is fine although not a huge fan of the watery salsa just sitting out. The wait and inefficient service may be a deal breaker. Not sure if they re just understaffed.   Expect filthy tables and bar tops  at least 1.5 hours wait on a sunny weekend and hostesses who would rather be anywhere else because of the customers they have to deal with. Their uncovered patio seating is first come first serve unlike other parts of the place  which seems inefficient if there are so many people waiting for tables... why not take those tables back and seat people like you would inside the restaurant or on the covered patio 
Hula Hut,324,I love the hula hut the food is always good  No matter what you choose on the menu  you re gonna love it  the scenery is beautiful You almost feel like you re on a Hawaiian islands They have a great happy hour Anywhere from  4 margaritas to nachos even vegetarian 
Hula Hut,325,I enjoy this place on the water. I like eating outside either at the bar or the covered area. They have good drinks and I like the coconut shrimp appetizer. This place can get super busy  parking isn t the greatest here either. Service can be slow at times. But it s a great place to come to on a beautiful mild day and to get drinks and appetizers.
Hula Hut,326,The location and vibes turn this place into a great spot on the water. Their drinks are also fruity  amp  exotic for those who like island-flaired sips. The food is a hit or miss  we ve been about four times over the course of the last three months and it s either bland and boring or decently good. It s a Hawaiian twist on the popular Tex-mex found throughout the area. This makes for an interesting take on some of the food  but a bit more flavor and spice would up this place a star.
Hula Hut,327,This place is awesome year after year    Jamie  the waitress came in and saved the day from another waitress  lack of care and concern.  The bartender  Sam  was crazy busy and provided EXCELLENT SERVICE. AS ALWAYS THE FOOD WAS PERFE T
Hula Hut,328,The hut never disappoints. Food was amazing Service was great Drinks were bomb  Dessert was a plus I come to Hula Hut every trip to Austin. It is consistently delish. I will be back next time
Hula Hut,329,The Hula  Hut. Generously supplied Arise Austin Medical Center with delicious hot soup  amp  chips   amp  salsa. They placed it in my car  amp  would not even let me tip them. Thankyou for your kindness  amp  generousity  you filled some tired healthcare workers belly s . Very Grateful staff of Arise Austin Medical Center    Wonderful after a cold  icey storm
Hula Hut,330,The food was amazing with a great view  Molly  our waitress  was amazing and worked very hard. Wonderful customer service and so sweet  thank you  
Hula Hut,331,This place stands out in the ever expanding Tex Mex restaurant scene in Austin is all because of its LOCATION. The patio is specially something to sought for  right on Colorado river giving the patron beautiful and starky view of the surrounding marina and waterfront. Thought it can get humid there but it still worth trying. Finding parking is another hurdle in that location. Food is overrated but the drinks are well balanced..Best time to visit would be around sunset.
Hula Hut,332,I have heard about this place many times in the last 5 years we have lived in Austin. We just never made the time to try it out. Last night  we may not have gone wince it only has 3.5 stars. But it has more stars than the only other place to eat at Oyster Landing so this is where we went.  I m not going to bother telling about the ambiance or anything because its talked about in virtually every other review. What I will talked about is the food and service.  The place absolutely packed when we went  inside and out. We were lucky enough to grab the last outdoor table. As it turns out  we got really good service for how busy the place was. It wasn t out of this world but it was decent service.  The menu is relatively simple. It s TexMex with a twist. Hawaiian. Pretty cool  actually. The chips are great  they are made there and are the thin kind  which we all loved . The salsa definitely isn t out of a can. It tastes good and has a nice bite.  The food came out faster than we expected  which was nice. My wife and I were planning to share one of their Pu Pu Platters. Can t remember the name  they only have two and it s not the fish one. A LOT of food. It could serve 4 people.  It has taquitos  mediocre   ribs  awesome  loved the sauce   nachos  yum    potatoes  also good  a small salad and a number of sauces dressings including a darn good queso. The entire platter was really good. I was really surprised by the ribs. They weren t quite fall off the bone but great flavor and I would happily buy that barbecue sauce  I m very picky about my sauces .  My dad had a cheese enchilada. Aside from being stupidly huge  it s super full of cheese. It doesn t have the traditional mole sauce  which I hate  but had a more tomato based one. That s the only thing I might do differently  just not to my taste.  Oh  and my wife and I have at least one more meal from the platter sitting in our fridge.  All in all  great place. I really look forward to going back  We were all very pleased. Well  except my dad who was complaining he had eaten way too much.
Hula Hut,333,I went here with a work group of about 10. We sat on the outside  covered patio - I can see it being a little less fun if it was super hot  but during this odd 2018 spring season  it was nice out. We tried the Stuffed Avocado appetizer - very yummy   And big. I ordered the mahi  one-filet  dinner - it was not dried out and yummy. I enjoyed it  as well as the side salad. I didn t care for the steamed spinach the mahi is served on  but I rarely care for spinach in general. Fun place.
Hula Hut,334,I had some of the best service ever with my server Shelly. She was quick to my table  always made sure to check in on me and kept my refills flowing. Also Hula Hut has some of the best key lime pie.
Hula Hut,335,my favorite restaurant when i visit austin  the view is amazing  staff is really friendly and food is better 
Hula Hut,336,This spot has always been a favorite of ours on past favorite having lived in Austin. It s right on Lake Austin offering great views  drinks  and eats.  This time we were shocked  Bobby was our waiter outside on the patio. At first all was good  until we ordered a second round. We ordered Don Julio margaritas and clearly the second round was low grade tequila. We requested replacement drinks thats when it went downhill fast    Bobby got super defensive  blamed it on us say that he drinks many margaritas and swore they were the same. Then we requested the bill  he gave us pushback about printing a receipt. With everything going on  I got distracted and left my credit card. After calling the restaurant twice to have the hostess check lost and found with no luck. Called and cancelled my card and of course there was multiple charges  one being the correct bill amount. Gotta love that Texas hospitality   Won t be returning.
Hula Hut,337,Love coming to this place. The view is beautiful the food is super good  the staff is always friendly and I enjoy the atmosphere. So far I have never been disappointed in my order.
Hula Hut,338, Sexism Gender-based discrimination and subpar food.  We started our visit at the bar to wait for a table. We were a party of 4 and told we had to wait 80 minutes. Knowing that  we stayed in the bar area and went directly to the bar to get drinks. My friend  female  went first and was ignored by the  male  bartender for some time. He would serve all the men coming up but ignore her until she asked him whether women were invisible. When we joined her and her husband  I went to the same spot and bartender and experienced the same kind of sexism  He would allow men to skip the line and order even after I told him that they were skipping the line. He would not even look at me or acknowledge me. It happen twice until my husband joined me and  oh wonder  I was able to place my order. Needless to say  that the bartender didn t even say  thank you  let alone an apologies. We then found a table in the bar area and only after 30 minutes waiting for the actual table  we got a notification that our table was ready. We canceled that one since we were happy with the table we got outside at the bar. The only reason I m giving 2 stars and not just one is because of the waitress that served us. She was absolutely amazing  Patient  attentive  efficient  and super friendly. We were 2 vegetarians and 2 vegans and so she listened carefully and advised us with honesty and knowledge about what we could oder. She mentioned that the Fajitas could be made vegan  however  because of the skillets  there would be the chance of meat residue. We were okay taking the chance. To our shock  there was not just  residue  there were huge chunks of beef in our food  especially the mushrooms. Our waitress was very apologetic and went above and beyond to make it right to us. She is the only reason we enjoyed our stay there and also the only reason we would give this place a second chance. I hope that the gender-based discrimination from the bartender was a one-time thing only  otherwise  I would recommend the management to train their staff better and take actions to correct the illegal practice of discrimination.
Hula Hut,339,The view is amazing and the drinks are great  but that s about it. There s always a long wait which is understandable  but the hosts are rude. The food isn t anything exciting and service is mediocre at best. I mainly go to see the view and get a tiki drink.
Hula Hut,340,Only took two bites of my Mango Poblano Quesadilla and I still had to pay for the plate. It was the worst quesadilla I ve ever had. The waiter said it was cream cheese but it only tasted like sour cream and mango  NO  MELTED CHEESE  I thought it was a quesadilla not a sour cream taco. It was gross   I informed the waiter   but it was still on my bill. The only food I enjoyed was the tortilla chips with salsa  very good  along the Queso Compuesto  cheese dip . My sister had chicken Flautas  she wasn t impressed  the platter didn t even come with guacamole as it should be automatically with the plate.  She had to pay 3.50 extra for a side of guacamole  which was only lightly smashed avocado with no spices herbs  and my friend had a Veggie Tubular Taco  she said it was okay. Nothing Mexican in these Tex-Mex dishes.
Hula Hut,341,First experience was just plain ol bad. Decided to give it a second try they sat us down asked us what we wanted to drink and if we wanted chips  amp  salsa when we wanted to place the order the restaurant had closed the kitchen due to the kitchen being flooded from the drainage we asked how long it would be and decided not to stay and they charged us for fountain drinks we never received
Hula Hut,342,This spot has one of the best lake views in Austin. The service is not bad  considering it s Covid era. I deducted two stars since we did not get cutlery for a while after repeatedly asking for it. The first time we asked  it was not our own server  and we saw the person we asked leisurely doing other things rather than get us cutlery. We had to go and ask our own server for the cutlery  and the food was almost cold by the time we got it. Additionally  the lights under our umbrella were out and there were spiders along the canopy.  However  the food was great and there were a lot of vegetarian and vegan choices. Their drinks are also innovative. I would go back on another day to see if the service can be better
Hula Hut,343,Not sure why we don t have a review of Hula Hut yet since we ve been many times. This place is as delightful as it is tacky and we can t help but like it.  We took a friend from out of town here on Friday for happy hour  and we all had some  decent  margaritas. Queso is blah  guacamole is pitiful  the fajitas are worryingly chewy  and the kiddo s quesadilla was run-of-the-mill. Service started strong  but then faltered as the patio started filling up. But that s how it goes with these places--service food is terrible  but the views are stellar. It was hot out  but not unbearably so  and we had a good time sitting at a table right by the water. Hula Hut is our kind of kitsch  and we ll always be back at least once a year. 3.5 stars  rounding up.
Hula Hut,344,What has happened to Hula Hut   Hula Hut was a sister restaurant to Chuy s.  Both restaurants were known for having that quirky Austin vibe and decent food.  Hula Hut had the additional advantage of being located on Lake Austin  so it was a place that you could take out-of-town visitors for lunch to give them a taste of Austin s weirdness.  After going to Hula Hut for 20  years  I have been really disappointed by the last couple of times that I have been there.  About a month ago  we went to Hula Hut for lunch and after sitting at our table for 20 minutes  we had to literally hunt down our waiter to ask for service.  Today  we thought we would give it another chance.  The wait  for a table  on a Friday afternoon  was 30 minutes.  There was an area behind the host station that had seating but of the 8 booths and two tables in this area  5 of the booths and both of the tables were covered in leftover dishes and drinks.  No sign of a busboy.  The host said to go ahead and sit down and someone would come by to clean up.  After sitting at a booth for 20 minutes and no sign of a busboy  I removed the dirty dishes and dirty glasses from the table myself and piled them on the large collection of dirty dishes on another table.  The waitperson came by about 10 minutes later  this was 30 minutes after we sat down  and we asked if she could wipe the table.  She produced a spray bottle that she sprayed on the table  and all over us at the same time  and wiped the part of the table nearest to her.  We offered to help thinking that she was having trouble reaching the rest of the table.  She rolled her eyes.  She then gave us menus that had dried food and old salsa stains all over them.   At this point  after sitting at a dirty table for 30 minutes  looking out at piles of dirty dishes at the surrounding booths and tables  never getting our drink order taken and then getting attitude from the waitress  we decided that we had had enough.    We left.  Before I posted this review  I read some of the other recent reviews  including a review from someone who says that their waiter threatened to assault them     and speaking to the manager didn t warrant any apology or provide any hope that things were going to change.     There s something wrong at this restaurant.  The Chuys and Hula Hut chains were always known for being fun  having good waitstaff and good management.  This is a restaurant with a management and staffing problem.  I wouldn t recommend going there until they resolve the problem.
Hula Hut,345,An amazing restaurant on Lake Austin. With seating inside  outside with Hula or Tike Huts. Enjoyed our lunch. We ordered the chicken and guacamole tubular taco  their version of a burrito . It came with rice and refried beans. Everything tasted really good and was piping hot. The portion was huge and I had enough left over for another meal. My boyfriend got the pork burrito and it was really juicy and flavorful. The service was excellent. The food was good and the drinks were on time. Overall  the food and services were good.
Hula Hut,346,I tried the tubular taco   steak  and it was super good  Also their complementary chips amp  salsa were so delicious  We sat outside at night and the lights made it so nice and the ambiance next to the water made it really peaceful. My only complaint is it can be a little pricey but the view makes it worth it. Also my server was very intimidating and stoic that it made me a little nervous to ask for anything. Other than that  everything was great 
Hula Hut,347,Our server  Melissa  was fabulous   We had a large party and she was so attentive and patient   Make sure you request her when you go  
Hula Hut,348,Was nervous about finding outside seating but at 6 15 on a Friday evening  was able to sit in self seating outside immediately  Our server was just the sweetest   book worm     lady who was probably one of the most enthusiastic and attentive servers I had ever had. Absolutely loved her  wish I would have gotten her name  Cute little Hawaiian almost pin up dress on  she was fantastic.   Do yourself a favor and get there for happy hour  I believe 3 30-6 30   and order some  4 chicken flautas  Wow  SO GOOD  And like 5 or 6 to the order and they were large  so a perfect appetizer. The fajitas were fantastic  and the frozen strawberry margarita was lovely. Combined with the view and the overall laid back demeanor  this has got to be one of the best little Austin spots I ve been to 
Hula Hut,349,This is definitely a business that is subsisting.on reputation and location. I had heard great things about this place for years  so after a day on the lake house encouraged my friends to try it out.  Service was mostly non existent. We cam back for our table and the group in front of us was told that despite making the reservation inside  rather than walk them to their table the hostess pointed them to the door. We were treated slightly better when the hostess found out our table was inside. She took us to a table that was still dirty  with food all over the floor underneath .  Our waiter was nice enough  but not very charismatic. He asked if we needed drinks  and we told him we d probably get beers  but we d need a minute. We ended up ordering them with our food. Our food had been delivered  by the time he came back and said  I didn t forget your beers  we were just out.  Trying to be kind  we responded that it was okay  really we were tired from the day and whatever was cheapest would be fine. He came back as we were finishing the meal with Coor s  spoiler alert they were  5 . We then had to wait 20 minutes after he took the plates  and flag him down  for the check.  The three meals that we had were all bland. Bad enough that I apologized to me friends for the recommendation.  Long story short this is Austin  great food and service is everywhere  just not here .
Hula Hut,350,Well  really bad experience  Friday night July 24th. Other friends and I had dinner in a corner table closed to the kitchen   In the middle of our dinner  cockroaches started coming  Some of our girl friend started screaming  We killed couple of them until one starting walking on our food  Management never came to our table to said anything at all  Shelby was our server and did not take care the problem neither   We moved to another table but did not finish our food   Very disappointed about it   We will never come back to a place like this  
Hula Hut,351,Its a nice view  I didn t have much of an appetite but I ate quesadilla chicken it was okay. The wait was about an hour.
Hula Hut,352,Food was delicious and the waiter was great. The place lacks cleanliness and some basic maintenance. Bathrooms were subpar. If that doesn t bother you then try it. It s a great location on the water.
Hula Hut,353,Gave Hulu Hut a try based on a recommendation. If the weather is nice  eat outside over the water. There was a nice breeze. The Hawaiian touch to this Tex-Mex food was actually pretty good. I had the Hawaiian BBQ Pork sandwich. The chunks of pineapple were a nice touch.  Our waitress Taylor was very pleasant and helpful. She kept the nachos coming while we waited for our meal. This place is definitely worth checking out. I m so glad we did.
Hula Hut,354,Hula hut is a Hawaiian twist on Chuys. The food is very similar with a pineapple slapped onto a quesadilla. The food is pretty good. I have not tried the drinks because I come here on my lunch break. The view is amazing  They also have a boat dock so it s very acceptable for you to walk in with a bathing suit cover on. It is a little pricy for the quality but the view makes it worth it
Hula Hut,355,You come to Hula Hut for the view and the vibes. The food is pretty mediocre but if you come for Happy Hour  there s complimentary chips and salsa for you to snack on while you booze out on the outdoor bar and stare at pretty water while holding hands with your Tinder date. LOL   Their fried avocado dish  i forgot the exact name but apparently it s award winning or something  is pretty legit though.
Hula Hut,356,Nice location. Really good service and food. Front desk needs some help on how to recognize customers when they walk in the door vs. being ignored and walking away. Picking up of finished plates in a timely manner needs attention as well. Love the view.
Hula Hut,357,Great water front views and fun energy. The Hula Hut is just as fun today as it was 5 or even 10 years ago. Yeah it has a touristy feel to it  but that s part of the charm. The food is good  prices a little higher  than the food should command but  you are paying for the view.   I had a cheese burger and a Margarita.  Both were great. Service was fast both from the wait staff and the kitchen.  Clearly the management team here is keeping things running on all eight cylinders.
Hula Hut,358,My wife and I were traveling from Corpus Christi back to our home in Fort Worth. We haven t done much in the Austin area  so we thought we would stop in somewhere to get some chow. We initially were going to choose any old normal restaurant  then I had this  fresh revelation  to seek out a restaurant on the river for the view. I pulled up Yelp and found Hula Hut.   The parking is a trip. I realize the restaurant cannot help this situation  just realize it might take you some time to park and walk to the location. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating areas. We went out back over the water. Very glad we did.  We got to watch various birds  turtles  and fish. The view is outstanding. I got a kick out of the dam right next to the restaurant. We watched as people skied nearby and took in the sights. We even had a grackle  pesky black bird  that would nearly fight us for the tortilla chips  I kid you not.   The wait staff was perfect and gave us plenty of time and space as we requested. He shared a couple of his favorite menu items with us and we took him up on his recommendations. We are glad we did as they have a rather crazy expanded menu.  The salsa has a nice little kick to it. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised as most salsas are a bit boring to us. Not here. It was just right. The thick chips were really enjoyable and were not greasy.  We ordered a cup of queso and the Kawaikini Stuffed Avocado as appetizers. The queso was excellent and we will order it again.   The avocado is stuffed with roasted chicken  green onions  cilantro  Monterey Jack cheese  and green chiles. It is rolled in Panko crumbs and green Chile spices and lightly fried. It is served on a bed of hatch green Chile and queso blanco sauces.  excellent.  My wife and I devoured the avocado like we hadn t eaten on two weeks. It is nearly a meal in and of itself.  We shared a main dish  the Shrimp Chile Rellenos. Two fresh Anaheim peppers stuffed with shrimp  Monterey Jack cheese  green chiles  onions  cilantro  red bell peppers  and roasted corn. It is lightly breaded and served on a bed of queso blanco sauce  topped with mango pineapple salsa. Comes with a side of refried beans and rice.   Every bit of it was delicious  just tasty as could be. The contrasting flavors of Mexican spices  cheeses  and the occasional sweet mango bite worked together really well. Every few bites there was a strong jalape o kick. The crispy and soft textures held up nicely. The rice was normal Mexican rice. The refried beans were a huge pleasant surprise. They tasted home made with some pork in them. We have eaten a lot of refried beans across Texas and these were up there with the best of the best. Really good main dish  highly recommended.  My wife has a bit of a disorder. She has to purchase about every tie-dye shirts she sees. Hula Hut has a fun crazy tie-dyed t-shirt and we had to make a stop at the gift shop to get her a shirt.  I was the designated driver and my wife was the designated drinker. She decided to drink tea. A Long Island Tea  that is. She said it was one of the best she has ever tasted. They threw in a few flavors not typically present in a Long Island Tea and she said it worked really well.  We will be back. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here.
Hula Hut,359,I ve always loved hula hut. Yesterday. Man that was a different story. The air conditioner seemed to be broken    fine. Things happen. Our table looked like it had not been cleaned and there was chips and all sorts of stuff still under our table when we were seated. The bathroom trash was overflowing. My friend and I sat down at the same time and both  said that hula hut looked like it just needed a deeeeep cleaning. Come on. Y all can do better. Just looked gross inside. Hot and dirty 
Hula Hut,360,Quarantine never felt so good  Shelly was AMAZING  So knowledgeable and kind.. Beck was wonderful and friendly  The view was beautiful   the social distancing and the cleanliness was ON POINT  We thoroughly enjoyed our evening  So thankful for these 2 wonderful employees  Very few team members anywhere care about how happy you are.. they BOTH were awesome   beck  shelly  quarantine  hulahut  skinnymargs  lakelife
Hula Hut,361,This is one of the best values in Austin - pretty good Tex mex  great views  and reasonable prices. I love to come here at 11  before the crowds and always get the fish tacos.  Drinks are good too 
Hula Hut,362,Horrible service  gross drinks  bland food. We came here a few weeks ago as a last resort  finally got seated after waiting 2 hours  our waiter refused to serve us alcohol because the bartenders cut us off  that was news to us considering we each had 2 drinks at the bar. Manager was a complete jerk to us and could stand to take a lesson in customer service.   Not that this is a loss for me  but I will never be back here.
Hula Hut,363,So good with great atmosphere. It has the flavor of Chuy s with the greatest dining pier in Austin. Love it every time we go. Great drinks  great food. Love the shrimp quesadilla and the various tubular tacos. So good. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service has been a little bit lacking the last few times but this shouldn t stop you from going and enjoying the tasty eats and ambiance of this great establishment.
Hula Hut,364,The food is great here. The atmosphere even better. I just wish they would have better communication. My orders are always time sensitive  and almost always late.
Hula Hut,365,So  I have to say that overall this place is pretty good for my first time trying it but since I ve lived in Austin it s all seemed to be more of a tourist destination which I ll admit kept my family from going. Personally I m not big on having to wait too long before being seated at a restaurant but since my fianc  and I were meeting a friend it was fine. I d say my biggest complaint would be that there isn t really that many places to wait inside unless you want to go wait at the bar. But let s be honest it s Texas and it s the summer of 100  degree weather so no one wants to wait outside. It took about 35 min on a Tuesday around 7 pm to get a table for 3 which on a Tuesday seems kinda crazy as we are more used to low key places. Non the less we got our table  placed our orders and talked til the food arrived. I ordered a Hawaiian Style Burger  my fianc  ordered the Hawaiian BBQ Pork Sandwich And our friend ordered the Kawaikini  Stuffed Avocado  we also had Chile con quest and Jalape o ranch dip. All in all the food was awesome and the portions are very nicely sized. The service was great as well as the atmosphere. I d go again
Hula Hut,366,If it weren t the view  I would say this was a total pass. But sitting on the patio at sunset and looking over the water  you can t help but fall in love with the scenery. But on to the rest of the experience - first of all  service was insanely slow. Our waitress was super friendly which I ll give her credit for  but didn t seem to have any sense of urgency. Since the patio was open seating  our table was still full of leftover food and empty glasses when we grabbed it. It took about 10-15 minutes to get this cleared off  by which point another table had opened up which was better for our group size. We decided to move over to this new table and had to wait another 5 minutes to get this one cleared up. It didn t take too long to put in an order for our drinks and food  although we had asked for the chicken flautas and shrimp flautus were brought out instead. Not a big deal  we like shrimp so we decided to keep our order. In particular  the stuffed avocado was AMAZING. I only wish there was more of it to go around. I would say the apps were the best part of our meal. Our mains were meh - not horrible but nothing noteworthy. And bear in mind that they give you Texas servings here  which either means you leave in a complete food coma or have a lot of leftover food. Overall  this place would still have been a solid 4 stars except for the last part of the service we experienced. It probably took us another 45 minutes after we were done eating to flag down our waitress to pay our bill. They use a mobile card reader here and after your payment is processed  it asks you if you want your receipt via email  text  or print. Since this was a business expense  I decided to choose the option to print. Nothing printed out and that s when the waitress told me that only the  email  or  text  option worked. Well  that would have been nice to know and not after the fact. She said she would go in to print the receipt and bring it out  but after having waited the better part of an hour for her to come around for us to even pay  I didn t have any patience left to wait more so we ended up leaving. And what I found amusing is that unlike other restaurants where they give you tip recommendations between 15 -20   this place started at 18  and went up to 25 . There was no way I was paying a 25  tip for average food and subaverage service.   Once again though  the view saved the day and I would come back to enjoy that alone.
Hula Hut,367,This little hula hut is a real winner. Right on the water  The stuffed avocado  is on point   The Palouma is a flop. Tequila. Yes. Grapefruit. Yes. Mixed together no thanks.   Just what the Dr. ordered.
Hula Hut,368,Lizzie best waitress ever   Hands down took care of our table like a champ. Keep up the good work
Hula Hut,369,Amazing service  our waitress lizzie was awesome and very attentive 10 10 coming back again
Hula Hut,370,lizzie is the best waitress ever. very attentive  we had party of 5 and two unexpect guests. she went above and beyond to meet our needs hands down wonderful young lady.
Hula Hut,371, Giving this place four stars because of the great service I received   Hula Hut is a cute little place with a great view. I feel like the main focus of this place is on the decor and ambience and not so much the food. That being said  this place has an awesome tropical vibe and large windows so you can admire the beautiful scenery outside.The food here is mostly your average tex-mex food  although they do give large portions which is a plus. I had ordered the shrimp tacos  which were pretty tasty. At first  I was given the wrong order but my server  I think his name was Chris   was quick to make sure that I received the correct order as soon as possible. He provided excellent service throughout the whole night and always made sure we had everything we needed.  There is a bit of a wait here due to it being in a popular location  however the wait time estimate that they gave me was actually longer than the actual time I had to wait. You can also head over to Medici to relax for a bit while you re waiting which makes time go by faster 
Hula Hut,372,Want to thank Melissa for her great service. Ordered the veggies enchiladas and the food was great. I recommend it.
Hula Hut,373,I ve lived in Austin for more than a decade now and this is one of my favorite places to take out-of-towners if only for those Polynesian fajitas. Damn  those Polynesian fajitas are the perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I always order for 2  even just for me  so I have some for lunch the following day 
Hula Hut,374,This restaurant has gone downhill not only the food is not as good as it used to be but it s filthy dirty.
Hula Hut,375,I have lived in Austin for 5 years now  and i avoided coming here because of the other reviews  and fear of the tourist-trap type feeling. The food was OK  a little over priced IMO  but it s a nice spot to sit on the water  and enjoy a group of friends  and some drinks. We were fairly grossed out though because all of menus had clearly been wiped by dirty dish towels  and they were covered in food  and smelled like old dish water  so we had to ask for new ones. I would go back again for HH perhaps  and maybe just stick with appetizers next time  The parking situation is quite intense  so be prepared to drive around  or park farther away and walk though 
Hula Hut,376,My waitress was Franny and she was the best. Such good service and a friendly face. The atmosphere was unmatched. I can t get over how great of a waitress franny was  made my night.
Hula Hut,377,This spot has significantly devalued the food. It was terrible. It was my third visit and this last time was absolutely unacceptable. The lemonade tasted like our poison. I have never tasted a lemonade so bad in my life. I cannot even give it a 1 2 star for that lemonade. There were five of us and all of took a drink at the same time and had the same reaction. One was my 3 yrnold son. Smh even he knew it tasted funny. Tried sprite next and it tasted like carbonated well water. The chicken quesadilla was extremely dry with little cheese. The chicken enchilada same fry fry dry chicken inside with a small amount of cheese. Basically a dry warm tortilla with plain dry shredded chicken. The chips and Wiesel was the only edible item. I will never give it another chance. Not even sure what the concept is. A Mexican restaurant with a Hawaiian decor and Carribean Brittany speaks music playing. Lol
Hula Hut,378,Went here despite the bad reviews because it was on the water. After waiting me and my family were seated at the only table that did not have shade. We were told it would be another 30 minutes to switch to a table where we wouldn t be baking in the sun.  We tried waiting in a shaded area by the bar but we were then told we had to wait at the table in the sun because of social distancing. Hostess was rude as well.
Hula Hut,379,This is the best Polynesian TeX mex food I have tasted. The coconut shrimp is so good and not too sweet it s just right. The palm tree hugger nachos are delicious especially the beef ones and the chicken is just as good. The chicken tortilla soup is so inviting on a crisp cool evening. The staff is friendly and the place is inviting with a wonderful atmosphere. You could meet here with friends and eat drink and be merry 
Hula Hut,380,food is always good. this is our third time here and the drinks always are a disappointment. we always want to get a pina colada but it seems like the machine is always not working  for a tropical place you woukd think that the machince would always be working. highly disappointed with the drinks we did order  they seemed to barley have any alcohol to begin with.
Hula Hut,381,I planned a little trip to Texas for my 30th Birthday that included apartment hunting while in Austin. I started in Dallas  then Austin  and finishing in Houston. I had done research where I wanted to go for my 30th Birthday and I was set on Hula Hut. I just wanted Tex Mex  I love Mexican and Tex Mex  and I wanted to be on the water. My mom and I spent the whole day looking for apartments for myself and lucky me I found a place   We headed there for a late dinner. We got there maybe around 8Pm. The hostess told us it would be 45 minutes for a table  we were starving  or go onto the patio and find something so we decided with the latter. We found a table on the railing by the water  just what I wanted for my Birthday  in like 5 minutes.  The reviews are right...the service is SLOW  But  the place was full. I m in the service industry so I get it. I just took my time and we decided on appetizers and I narrowed my dinner down to two things. It was just my drink that made my head spin. But I figured it s my Birthday  so I ll have 2 or 3 drinks. Our waiter was a sweetheart. He answered my question. Got our drink and appetizer order. Weird thing...he told me he s super busy  to write down our order  and find him and give it to him. Weird  right  But whatever. I wanted one Chicken Chile Relleno and one Shrimp one and he said anything for the Birthday Girl.  Our drinks were okay. I don t like sweet drinks. I m more of a Whiskey Rocks girl. We got the Chicken Stuffed Fried Avocado. It...was...DELICIOUS. I totally would get that again. I loved my Chile Relleno s. It was high quality and the shrimp in mine were of abundance and big.  I was just sad with service. I really wanted to drink. Not get tanked lol. But I wanted one or two more and our waiter and no one ever came to ask if I wanted anything else so I was a little bummed. Also  getting the check was painstaking. I was stuffed and sooo tired and to track him down to get the check took over 30 minutes. Other than that  BEAUTIFUL atmosphere and yummy food. Will definitely be coming back a lot more when I move to Austin 
Hula Hut,382,This review is strictly based on the terrible service I received yesterday. I frequently come to hula hut and they have a great happy hour that I enjoy going to every now and then. Yesterday my family and I arrived around 3 45pm to enjoy some happy hour specials and the nice weather. We sat on the covered deck then ordered some happy hour drinks from our waitress who was telling us all about the happy hour specials.    Over 25 minutes later our drinks arrive. Our waitress apologized saying there were no clean glasses and that s why it took so long. That s fine  I get that things happen as I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years. Our two happy hour snacks and queso came out a little while after our drinks and everything tasted great like usual. We had completely finished our food and drinks and our waitress never came back by to ask if we d like another drink. Finally she comes by and tells us she s super busy and her sections inside so if we could close out with her that d be great.    At this point we were just ready to leave so we paid for everything on one tab. She tells us it s over  60 and we questioned her if that was the happy hour prices  she said yes it s  60  so we paid and asked for a paper receipt and she never returned. Luckily their system texted our receipt to us and we noticed nothing we ordered was charged as a happy hour price. So then we try to get a manager to come see us. Over ten minutes later he comes by and says it s an easy fix and leaves. Another 15 minutes goes by and our original waitress comes back saying it s been fixed and she thought it was Saturday  even though she was the one telling us about the happy hour specials to begin with.    The manager never came back by or apologized and honestly was not very customer service oriented. Our tab went from  60 to  35 as what it should have been. It took us over 2 hours here because of the terribly slow service and customer service. I understand it s sxsw but everyone else around us seemed to have way better service than us. If the waitresses section is inside  her outside table needs to be transferred to someone outside who can handle it. Hula Hut is great and I ve never had bad service here before yesterday. But always make sure you check your receipt in the end especially at happy hour.
Hula Hut,383,Loved this place. It has great food  great ambiance  and great service. I ordered the slow cooked pork tacos and they were super amazing. I came here visiting and  I m glad I tried it.
Hula Hut,384,I will say the service at hula hut was very good but the food was very disappointing. I would visit for the view and drinks . However I would not come here to eat dinner again. You can usually tell the quality of food by the taste of the salsa served and that assessment was on point as even the salsa was watery. Good luck
Hula Hut,385,Perhaps the worst service I ve had in a while.   I was told a 30 minute wait. When I checked back at the 40 minute mark I was told they were busy. Really  I didn t notice. I just wanted an update. No commitment. Finally seated almost an hour after signing up for a table.   Waited outside. Surly waitress gave me a dirty look every time I walked by  guess it was my bad for asking for a table to be bussed.  Free chips and salsa out  dirty look from a different server when I asked about that. Tried to order drinks and a third waitress yelled at me for where I was standing.   They get an extra star because the drinks were decent.
Hula Hut,386,The drinks and atmosphere couldn t have been better. We really enjoyed the nachos and Austin Tini s. Really well made drinks. The food came out fast and was really good. Our server was top notch and the best we have had here after multiple visits. Thank you Manoli  
Hula Hut,387,Awful management ownership who give zero respect to employees. There was never temperatures taken  they were not following regulations  and they claimed the positive test was a false-positive in order to avoid closing. This place has never been clean  sewage is consistently backed up and flowing into the kitchen and a there is a lengthy history with rodents. Employees were kept in the dark as well as customers and they are deleting comments on this post so I m leaving this here  stay safe out there 
Hula Hut,388,The food was good  but the service was sorely lacking. First we were seated at a table that hadn t even been wiped down. We had to ask for someone to clean it. We had to ask for silverware and napkins. We had to ask for plates when our food arrived. We had ordered two appetizers that we were splitting. Common sense would be to bring plates. Each time we did ask for something it took several minutes before our server returned with the item. And then people were just simply not friendly. Very disappointed. I really wanted to like this place. The food was really good and the location on the water is great. But it didn t make up for the poor service.
Hula Hut,389,I love this place but the service I had was awful yesterday from a bartender working outside. She told us that getting a pi a colada would require having to go inside to get it. Then five minutes later she said they just ran out. As we sat outside drinking margs which we really didn t want as we came for Pi a colada s we caught sight of another server coming out with a Pina coladas. Our new server said the lady had lied to us so she did not have to walk in to get them.
Hula Hut,390,Hula hut was hyped up by two separate lyft drivers.  I wasn t really impressed though  Veg options are quite scarce. The queso isn t as good as torchys but the salsa was pretty good  I got the avocado salad which was lettuce in mixed up with guacamole  The place has good views of the water but it s pretty campy and the food isn t even that great
Hula Hut,391,We arrived with a large group  11  so I understand waiting for a little while an area is being set up. However  our wait for a table was over a hour.  We initially sat in the patio area  but a really rude and abrasive waiter said we could not sit there because it was  full Service  not even taking the time to see if we had anything to order or wanted to eat.  The drinks were nice while we waited in the makeshift seating area outside.  Still not sure why the wait was as long as it was because when we were finally seated  we all noticed the restaurant was minimally full   assuming for the social distancing rule  .  Our group was split up between 2 tables  the waitress addresses the food and drink needs of the first table  but our table only put in drink orders.  The manager   guy in light blue shirt  brought out our waters....... and that was pretty much it.  The service was subpar  no one at our second table ordered food be sauce the wait to get in be seated and served ruined our appetites.  Other than the view and the strawberry and coconut mojito  it wasn t worth it. I won t be visiting this establishment again.
Hula Hut,392,That fact that my family had to wait in the heat for 1hr 30mins then an additional 20 mins is ridiculous I paid for valet parking to not even eat at the restaurant  service is horrible. Never again
Hula Hut,393,Dinner with friends and we had a great time. Good food and Erin  our server  was awesome.  She was fun  personable  and on it. We didn t really have to ask for anything because she had already covered it.   Most of the table ordered one of her suggested meals and everyone was really pleased with the food.   The atmosphere is fun and inviting. The view is spectacular. A nice casual dining experience where you can laugh and have a good time with friends.
Hula Hut,394,Awesome place to meet some friends and have some drinks and food and more drinks. Great view of Lake Austin. Plenty of seating inside and in an enclosed patio  plus an outdoor deck. February and the sun was shining  What a beautiful day to be outside. I m sure it gets pretty crowded in the spring. The service was excellent. The food was good and the drinks were on time. Plenty of parking across the street if you need it. We Ubered everywhere that day and it was a good thing 
Hula Hut,395,Jackson was an incredible waiter and made every aspect of our trip enjoyable  We were killing time before the light show next door and we were seated  served and greatly accounted for during our visit. Drinks are solid and the vibe is to die for 
Hula Hut,396,Thank you Tiffany for going all out for our family of four  We brought our Texas native children back home after living in Colorado for the past 16 years. Hula Hut is one of our fondest memories and we are so glad we came back to celebrate an amazing milestone for our family. Thanks to Tiffany for helping us celebrate in nostalgic style.
Hula Hut,397,Great service and food came very fast. The scenery is amazing especially at dinner time. You get to sit by the lake with beautiful lighting and feel the breeze. Our food tasted great so compliments to the chef  . The crowd was mostly young outdoors didn t get a chance to go indoors and see what it s all about. Our waiter could have been a little more friendly... didn t catch his name  other than that when in Austin definitely check this place out.
Hula Hut,398,Love manoli he is the best ever give him one million dollars and all of the free meals forever
Hula Hut,399,If I could give zero stars I would. It s a Saturday night and you are under staffed big times the bathrooms are filthy and the hosts are clueless and just making up wait times a party of 6 is 30 min and a part of 15 is 2 hrs. WTF   The service  waiter waitress  were awesome. The food timing was the worst ever. One part of our part got their food and finished it before the rest of the part got their food. All was order at the same time. We ordered queso apps and then once it can and it was delish  we ordered more. Well... it came when we were boxing up our dinners  Food arrived and we didn t have silverware and waited 5-10 min for silverware and food got colds   Food arrived in waves. Fajitas came without tortillas or side items.   Management needs a training course on service levels. Our server was awesome and she did all she could do for the crap overall service 
Hula Hut,400,I finally got to try this iconic local Austin eatery.  The parking is a bear.  I have never enjoyed finding parking for the Lake Austin eateries. Hulu hut has a spacious indoor and outdoor eating area.  The patio is covered and heated for the cooler winter months  and has a phenomenal view.  The decor is Aloha tropical fun.  It transports you to an island getaway.  The menu is VAST     There is definitely something for someone. I am always cautious of such vast menus - quality vs. quantity. They do have a gluten free menu upon request. My group definitely challenged the menu.  Amongst us we ordered a rib plate  ahi tuna open faced tacos  guac salad  and steak fajita. The portions are LARGE. Each plate seemed to be shareable between 2 people. We took home alot of food.  Surprisingly  everything was OK.  The highlight was definitely the fajitas.  The ahi tuna wasn t bad.  You could tell it had been frozen for a bit  and not fresh.  The ribs were also OK.  The guac wasn t the greatest  the best part was the pineapple salsa.  The price for the food was low for what you get.  The drinks were good and low priced for Austin.  The staff was friendly  and the service perfect.  We enjoyed our time here  and would definitely come back if in the area.  It s a great spot to take people from out of town for the great patio dining.
Hula Hut,401,Over priced tasteless food. Service sucks too  waiters with attitude. Wouldn t recommend this place.
Hula Hut,402,Similar to Abel s next door the food here is very subpar. The staff were amazing  kind and helpful. I will say  however  their chips and queso was so delicious. I got the chicken quesadilla and it was so dry I only ate two slices and gave the rest away. My friends said it was good once you drenched it in the poblano ranch dressing. Another friend of mine ordered the beef fajitas and said the meat was very tough.  I think these waterfront restaurants are really just good for having a few drinks with a beautiful view. Other than that  don t waste your money.
Hula Hut,403,Oh my gosh it s so great to be back in the hula hut. We had a fantastic evening weather was perfect service was unbelievable. Our waitress Molly really took care of us. We are going to explain the menu talk to that potential allergy issues. Overall fantastic. Can t wait to come back
Hula Hut,404,Came for lunch on Friday and ordered the special. It s a fish sandwich with fries. I m giving this place two stars because the food came out mediocre and there were barely any fries... I also asked the waitress if I could swap the fries with a salad and she then proceeds to place an order for both the sandwich and a salad. Why would a normal person want two orders of food for lunch.. she didn t understand what I was saying when I was explaining  it to her either  wouldn t recommend coming here.
Hula Hut,405,SK Norman may be the greatest waitress I ve ever had. I trust her with my life...  I really enjoyed her because my dads name is also Savannah  as well as my sons. The only displeasure had with this establishment was when Spencer dropped off the wrong drinks and smelled very pungently -- like Spanish mackerel that had been sitting in the sun. SK should write a book.
Hula Hut,406,Hula Hut has one of the best house margaritas I ve had in years  The food was good and great portions. They lost a star only because it seems a little run down looks wise  but the beach theme in general isn t meant to be top of the line. Love being on the water and would come back 
Hula Hut,407,Molly has been the BEST waitress I ve ever had. She is kind  funny  affable  and attentive. The food was INCREDIBLE  but honestly I would come back just to see Molly  amp  their other incredible waiters. Must go to if visiting  
Hula Hut,408,I ve been here a couple times and this last time was pretty disappointed in my shrimp and mango quesadilla. It was soggy due to the mango and wasn t up to the standards I ve had here before. I do love the location being right on the water. the service is always good and staff always friendly. Will have to try it again and order something else before I make up my mind.
Hula Hut,409,As good as it gets  This restaurant is right on the water and the outside decks span the entire restaurant. The place was packed and we still got our food within a reasonable amount of time.  Let me start by saying that the chips and salsa are both homemade. They are absolutely fabulous and the salsa really has a kick  plus a little bit of sweetness which I think is from pineapple.    They make their own tortillas  And they re fabulous.   My bf has the Steak Tubular Taco. This is no taco  It s a massive burrito with steak  mushrooms  peppers  and two kinds of cheese. It all blends perfectly for a taste that s incredible. The retried beans and rice are great as well.   I had the salad combo with the Seasar  how they spell it  and chicken tacquitos. The salad is not a traditional Caesar  it has corn  almonds and tortilla strips that add great flavor. It s not the usual dressing as well  but quite good. The chicken tacquitos were good  not overly fried.   Speaking of fried  they have a fried ice cream that s supposed to be amazing. I ll be back for that 
Hula Hut,410,A good friend of mine introduced me to Hula Hut on a trip to Austin a couple of years back  and I ve been  paying it forward  ever since  taking people I m traveling with out for  Mexonesian  when in Austin - and they always love it.   There s just something very cool about this place - it s great to be on the water  the staff is very friendly and attentive  and the drinks are potent. If you re sitting inside  the decor will take you back to Hawaii in a good  retro-sort of way.   The chips and salsa hit the table almost immediately  and you can tell just by looking that there s someone in the back of the house chopping up tomato after tomato to make this very fresh  tasty salsa. Our server made sure we had a continuous supply of chips... and drinks  too  the Cazatini being our cocktail of choice this time around.  The food is consistently good  with the folks I was there with this time around giving thumbs-up all the way around. The Texas Nachos are individually assembled  onto huge tortillas  and they ll make  em spicy for you  if you re like me and like a little bit of heat.  One of my friends had the tortilla soup  and I swear that the bowl was the size of a small soup toureen - very hearty  full of chicken and very tasty. For me  it was the roasted chicken pipeline enchilada  very flavorful and with just the right amount of queso blanco on it to compliment the filling.  Big plus for corn tortillas instead of flour ones     Even as the evenings start to get cool in Austin  this is a great place to hang out with some friends at a table out on the deck  don t worry  they have heaters   grab some drinks  and enjoy a little bit of Hawaii in Texas.
Hula Hut,411,The food here is amazing  The views right on the water are amazing but honestly the best part is the service. Karin is amazing  amp  she made the morning much  much better with her recommendations and bubbly spirit  I would come back for the food  but 100 times over to see Karin 
Hula Hut,412,Hula Hut is similar to the Tex-Mex favorite Chuy s  but has a Hawaiian flair.   The seating is quite easy as the waitlist is all digital. You give the hostess your phone number and can   The bar area where we waited was ok. Put table was not wiped down and I had to wipe it down myself  after waiting for 10 minutes . The bar was poorly stocked and I did not receive a Hawaiian cup with my drink order as expected. In addition  the salsa bar did not have any salsa bowls for 25 minutes before being restocked.   The food was as expected and tasted great. We ordered cheese and shrimp enchiladas. I was glad that their bar served White Claw.
Hula Hut,413,A unique  if kitschy  place with a great view and vibe    Right on Lake Austin  I recommend sitting outdoors and getting to appreciate the amazing view    As a  Tiki-Mex  restaurant  the food is fun - the vegetarian options include  tree hugger nachos   mango-poblano chile quesadillas  salads  a veggie burger  veggie fajitas  and veggie enchiladas and  tubular taco.     Pretty great cockails  too     Plenty of parking when you account for the lot across the street     This place is a ton of fun   The food isn t amazing  but it s a great experience 
Hula Hut,414,Our server Shelly  amp  Shana were so amazing  They made our first experience coming here so worth it  Thanks to them  my family  amp  myself will be coming back often 
Hula Hut,415,I went to hula hut on Monday night and had a great experience. It was busy but my food came out quickly and well prepared. My water was refilled several times by my kind sever Savannah  amp  I enjoyed the lake vibe. Would go again   
Hula Hut,416,Jen in the bar was amazing   We come here when in town and best service in years   Food is amazing    And great views
Hula Hut,417,Delicious food.... the Polynesian twist makes for a completely different taste.  Beautiful view.  First time here  and not disappointed.
Hula Hut,418,This place sucks     They told us it would be a 10 minute wait and 45 minutes later we were still not seated. When I talked to the manager he asked me what he wanted him to do     Really    I had 2 handicapped people waiting in the heat and they just didnt give a shxx..I am visiting from California and will never go here when I move here.
Hula Hut,419,We came to this place in 2006 while visiting Austin and we had great memories so we came back many years later. Very disappointed. Service is bad  fish tacos has a very smal piece os tasteless frozen  mahi . I ordered corn tortilla and god flour .. but the worse of all.. the kitchen where the food is prepared is so dirty that i had to gt a picture on my way out. The bathrooms are so filthy that you cant event get in. Im giving 2 stars b
Hula Hut,420,Food is decent  at best. Old and pretty dirty inside.  Best part is definitely the patio over the lake and the awesome views. I d rather go to Abel s next door. Same view and actually good food
Hula Hut,421,There are tons of restaurants in Austin but Hula Hut is a must every time we are visiting.  Their Chicken Guacamole Tubular Taco is the best      Located right on Lake Austin makes this a perfect place to eat drink and enjoy the lake.  You can sit on theirpier and take it all in.  Just watch out a bird might try to steal a chip or even a sugar packet.  Hulu Hut always delivers amazing food and a great experience.  Straight from the airport to Hula Hut.
Hula Hut,422,Been here several times and it is one of my favorite places in Austin. Great food and atmosphere.
Hula Hut,423,Loved the atmosphere  My kids enjoyed watching the turtles and ducklings swim by  And the food was delicious. Thank you for the wonderful time and exceptional service 
Hula Hut,424,Lex was the best  She made our lunch so fun and was so nice and friendly  We love this place 
Hula Hut,425,Great food and incredible drinks. The service by Lex was phenomenal. Lakeside views are very nice and fun seeing boats coming in and out of the docks.
Hula Hut,426,Ate here on a very crowded Sunday afternoon.  Our waitress Lex went above and beyond on her service for us.  She was super   Margs were yum too 
Hula Hut,427,Unfortunately this was not a great first impression. Have never been here before  first thing I walked in to was a young girl staring at me for about 10 seconds without saying anything. No one was in front of me. After she looked me up and down  she asked if I was with the man with the dog and I was. She rudely and with no emotion told me there were no dogs allowed. I totally understand and I am not offended at all. But maybe have someone who doesn t have an attitude should be your person helping and greeting people at the front door rather than a young girl who would rather be anywhere but at work. First impressions are key  so i probably won t return. Really unfortunate considering it was a top place I have been wanting to try. Ended up next door and it was awesome.
Hula Hut,428,It s all about the view and the vibe    This is a great place to be when it isn t that crowded and the weather is nice. Sam was awesome in helping us out. Sit outside    The food is mediocre. Had the fish tacos. With every bite you say  not bad  not great   and It s better at  fill in the blank  It s not really something you crave  rather something you order in order to pass the time with good people and a wonderful view coupled with drinks.   Lotsa Austin with a dash of Aloha   Shoots
Hula Hut,429,I loved spending a few hours drinking frozen margaritas on their covered patio. The fried avocado and tubular tacos are good and you can t beat the great view especially if there s nice breeze. The place is doing well operating as safely as possible during COVID-19.  Keep up the good work 
Hula Hut,430,I think the best part of this place is the view on the pier. I think we got lucky with one of the last tables on a Easter Sunday.   Overall  the food isn t super delicious but the place and look is the wow factor. So if you want a fun atmosphere  bring anyone to hang out here.   Service is good  parking can be a little tough when it s busy  you might have to park farther...
Hula Hut,431,Yummy food and fun atmosphere  I had the fried avocado tacos  and they were delicious.
Hula Hut,432,Maddy was the best   So attentive and great recommendations  Great service and a beautiful location.  Thank you Maddy 
Hula Hut,433,Love love love the exterior ambiance  Sitting by the water having some chips and salsa is the best   And having the option to self serve refill is great. Overall the food is middle of the road.   However  the place itself is a little rundown. It could use some sprucing up. Don t expect for it to be done by the day time workers though. We came one time during lunch and most of the staff were on their phones or playing games with each other the entire time we were there. All the while there was food on the floor  dirty tables etc. They should really have been using that time to scrub.  Shows that the management must only be focused on serving customers and not maintaining the restaurant.   I would give it a 2-3 star due to the lack of maintenance of the restaurant but the location bumps it up to a 4. Plus  we haven t ever really had bad service. It s good to fair most times.
Hula Hut,434,Certainly a spot meant for tourists  but not disappointing.  The salsa on the table was pretty awesome  the service friendly  if a bit slow   and the tacos a-ok.
Hula Hut,435,Burger was dry and definitely not worth  10  service wasn t great. Please retrain your servers  and not have them all sitting in a booth chatting it up instead of helping guests. Never got a refill of water  or even ketchup for the dry burger. Will not be coming here again.
Hula Hut,436,Awesome view great menu  staff was helpful and friendly. The food tasted delicious and the price was reasonable. I will definitely recommend and I will come back again
Hula Hut,437,Everything about our experience was just poor.  The service was non existent. Our food must have sat in the window for some time to be that dried out. The drinks nothing special. Not to even mention how dirty the bathroom was it looked like a out house. Then again the entire restaurant was covered in dirty plates rags. They will be failing the next health inspection.
Hula Hut,438,Very disappointed in the food here the only thing was beautiful here is the scenery waitress waiter they are OK but the food was sucky I will give it a star and that is only for waiter because he had so that poor guy
Hula Hut,439,YUM  If you are looking for an awesome place to eat on the water  look no further  Hula hut is so fun and delicious  A true Austin gem  The large portions  wide variety of food and tropical drinks will keep everyone in the party happy  Great for large groups and also family friendly. I highly recommend the chicken pipeline enchilada - I always get the half order because the portion is so large. The queso and creamy jalape o is also delicious   The wait is totally worth it  
Hula Hut,440,If you like a good vibe this is your place. If you like good food and good service... this is NOT your place. Outside deck was jam packed during COVID times. Waiter kept forgetting what we ordered... seemed a bit antsy. I do understand times are hard right now and he could have been on the 12th hour of his second job.   Chips and queso... chips good  queso watery garbage.   Once we got the food  pork burrito  amp  veggie enchiladas  it was A-1 garbage. Food literally came out in less than 10 minutes after we ordered. Not a good sign in my book. Didn t finish and did not take it to-go.
Hula Hut,441,2 star for Food   3star for the decor and the place  we tried quesadillas and fried avocado  quesadillas was just below ok and fried avocado was nice on outside but chicken was dry n bland  but my son liked the kids shrimp basket  and nice fries   
Hula Hut,442,It s tradition to visit this place with my Austin friends when I pass through. I had the pleasure of taking my Step Daughter to this place while we were visiting and she loved the gorgeous view. The food and staff are also amazing. Highly recommend this place. Just make sure to get there early as it s very popular.
Hula Hut,443,Rude host. We drove 1.5 hours to eat here. Checked in and our wait was 30 minutes. Never got a call or text so we went to ask the host and all we got was attitude. Told us it would be 1.5 hours to get seated again. As we were standing there  another group came in with the same number of people as us  and she told them the wait was 20 minutes. How rude. This is the only time this has happened. Don t like to write bad reviews but this wasn t cool  
Hula Hut,444,Hula Hut is an easy  very casual Mexican food joint on the water  although we went in the winter .  It has your usual selection  but all meals were high quality and delicious. This place is very kid friendly and the Hawaiian and  hut  theme give it a fun vibe.   Highly recommend coming for a light-hearted  yummy meal.
Hula Hut,445,Hadn t been to The Hula Hut in years  We had SUCH A FUN TIME  There was about 8 of us  amp  my family can be a little much- but our server Damian was AWESOME  Was able to handle all of us talking at the same time  amp  Keto food requests and all  Go visit the Hut  amp  ask for Damian 
Hula Hut,446,Relaxed atmosphere  bright colors  friendly service  You ll be right on the water with their expansive outdoor patio  amp  boat docks. You can even opt for Boat-side delivery    The only drawback is the terrible smelling restrooms...bleh 
Hula Hut,447,I haven t been here in a long time  but I do remember it was a great place. Well its not so great anymore  service is slow and this place is down right filthy   I mean disgusting. Even the waiters  and waitresses looked like they jumped out of bed and came straight to work as is.  I am  not sure if they even wipe down the tables  after a party leaves. The view is amazing and food is still good  but everything is dirty   I will not be returning back to this place.
Hula Hut,448,If you like fried and cheesy foods  you might like Hula Hut better than I did. It s a fun and well-decorated restaurant  and a great location by the water. However  it s usually pretty busy and we had about a 30-60 min wait for dinner  and in my opinion  the food and service were not really worth it    We got the stuffed avocado and veggie tubular taco  and the avocado was deep-fried and not very flavorful. Similar to the taco  the veggies were not flavorful at all but smothered in cheese. The ambiance and location are unique  but I don t know if I would really recommend this as a must-visit place in Austin...
Hula Hut,449,The restaurant has nice setting. On the lake  nice view. However today both sets of silverware were dirty. The menus were filthy. The waiter acted as if he didn t want to be there. The food was average. Used to be one of my favorite stops. But not worth going out of my way to eat there anymore. So with that I ll give it 2 stars for scenery.
Hula Hut,450,The first impression of Hula Hut was very bad. The restaurant itself is very beautiful  the space by the lake makes me smile. Kinda reminds me of the Midwest.   The hostess did not know what shellfish was. When I asked about how they treat allergies - the hostess did not know what shellfish was and said that they re shouldn t be any outside. I ended up talking to the manger - Ashley - who was very understanding and seemed to take care of the issue. Thank you Ashley    I did  sadly  have nothing to eat here but thoroughly enjoyed the frozen mixed margarita. It was a beautiful thing to have in the 70 plus degree weather.   After talking to our wonderful waitress  the manger and my friends opinion of her own food and adult beverage  I would recommend 
Hula Hut,451,I ve been to hula hut several times and have always had a good experience.  My wife and I really enjoy the patio area that sits right out on the water  it s a great atmosphere on a nice sunny day.  The quality of food has been consistent and good. I have particularly enjoyed the macadamia crusted mahi  chopped salad with grilled shrimp. The shrimp were large and tasted like they were fresh off the grill. For appetizers  the chicken flautas and the queso are really good and the chicken flautas paired with the queso is even better   The process of paying your bill is a little strange  I don t like the change. They recently changed to an all electronic payment system  the servers don t bring you a check  instead they carry a handheld device that you use to pay your bill.  It s just kinda wierd that the server is there hovering over you when you are reviewing your bill and deciding on how much to tip.
Hula Hut,452,This place is not organized   We were told we can have a drink at certain bar counter. We stood in line for 30 min to get a drink.  When it was our turn someone claims he is a manger decided to close that counter and we have to move to another bar counter and stand again in line.  When we explained the situation he started to shout at us saying this counter is to serve seated people  It was not our fault that we got directed by the reservation lady to stand in this line to get drinks. And all people in front of us were served  The manger was rude and loud  The bar tender also was rude and loud.  And they blamed the girl at the reservation and no apology for us  We actually felt discriminated against us.  Do not go back
Hula Hut,453,This was our first time here and we had an amazing experience  Starting off  there was only a 10 minute wait for a table  they text you once your table is ready. Our server was very attentive and they have electronic systems that send everything directly to the bar kitchen which insures fast service. Our food came out very quickly and was delicious  Beautiful views  Great drinks  5 star restaurant. Happy hour was priced well.
Hula Hut,454,Waited today at an outdoor table. One waitress for about 8-10 tables. However she didn t care about anyone. Ignored almost everyone. We sat for 15 minutes and she never came to take a drink much less food order. Have heard other bad reviews. Won t waste our time again.
Hula Hut,455,I love sitting in the bar area at the end of the pier.  Whenever I do  I make sure to chum the water with handfulls of tortilla chips.  When you do this  huge fish appear from the deep to eat the chips  and I immensely enjoy watching them gulp them down.  I know there are signs now-a-days there telling me not to do this  but I ignore those signs.  No one here has ever scolded me for feeding the fish with tortilla chips  but the time I showed up here with my fishing pole and some live bait  they immediately informed me that fishing was not allowed inside the restaurant and made me store my fishing gear in my car before returning.    I also love pi a coladas.  In Austin  a decent pi a colada is hard to come by.  But you can usually get a fairly good pi a colada at Hula Hut.  Sometimes I forget to tell them not to put shaved coconut in my pi a colada - I hate shaved coconut.  I know that s crazy - after all  pi a colada is a coconut drink.  I love the taste and flavor of coconut  I just can t stand actual coconut meat.  I think it s the texture I don t like.  In any case  leave the solid coconut shit out of my pi a colada       I ve been a Hula Hut patron going on for twenty-someodd years now.  After all this time being a frequenter here  this is what I can say   Sometimes the service rocks  sometimes it doesn t.  The majority of the time the food is great  but every once in a while it isn t.  On most occasions the pi a colada is delicious  but occasionally it tastes like a 7-11 Slurpee with nasty coconut meat sprinkled in it.
Hula Hut,456,Wouldn t recommend. The place was not busy but the service was very slow. Also  right now it s patio seating only and I saw a cockroach come up through the deck in broad daylight.. so probably needs some pest control and additional cleaning for their patio area.   Food was good though  m
Hula Hut,457,This is by far the worse customer service me and my family received by far. Not only did they make us wait  95  minutes  when we approach the counter at minute 85  they told us we still had 10 minutes to go. I suggested can they split my party in two tables  because there was several tables open  they said they couldn t do that because there was people who was also waiting  who arrived after us . They were rude  and basically said we  still had 10 more minutes to go  and they couldn t seat us at different sections  because of the waiters  -quite frankly this place customer service sucks and we didn t even get to seat down. Wouldn t recommend EVER... Btw I wouldn t even give them a star  but I can t post w o giving at least one
Hula Hut,458,Horrible experience I think this place is not a family friendly was terrible service because I was speaking Spanish I was innore.
Hula Hut,459,Highly recommended for people who enjoy the dinner or drinks with a nice view. We were lucky to get a high table close to the bar  otherwise the wait maybe 30 mins. Food are nice  lots of drinks to choose  price is surprisingly reasonable  Would come back again.
Hula Hut,460,First and foremost  5 stars for the view and cheeky over-the-top decor  if you have friends or family visiting it s worth it to take them here for those things alone.  As far as food and service goes  no thank you.  When we arrived there was a significant enough wait time  but the hostess said we could snag any open spots at the bar or around the bar. So we scooped up a table that just opened up. Unfortunately  I didn t realize that it was under one of their gigantic speakers that blasts music as loud as the decor. When our flighty waitress finally popped over to us I had to ask her to wipe down the table since we sat down right after people had left and no one had come by to clean it. My bf stuck his elbow in guacamole  not off to a good start.  I asked her nicely and in a I m-not-trying-to-be-an-asshole-customer kind of way if maybe they could turn down the music a bit  it had gotten incredibly loud at that point and we couldn t hear each other speak. She had the bartender turn it down a smidge and looked over at me  I motioned to her if they could turn it down just a little more and they simply shut it off. I told her I wasn t trying to be difficult and that they didn t need to turn it off completely  but she seemed over it and that was clearly how our customer-waitress relationship was going to be.  I ordered a mixed swirl margarita and my bf ordered a plain house margarita  my margarita came in the world s smallest container and his in a regular sized cup. Almost  7 for this drink that was literally  I kid you not  in one of those tiny plastic cups that you snag at the water dispenser when you are waiting to get your oil changed. We had different length straws because my cup was so small  I tried looking around to see what others had for drinks to see if this was some sort of lame joke.  Then the food. I ordered the shrimp quesadilla which was cold and soggy  it wasn t crispy and melty like quesadillas are supposed to be  it fell apart whenever I picked it up because it hadn t been cooked for long enough. My bf said the slow-roasted pork tacos were dry  bland  and underwhelming.  I really wanted to like this place  You want to enjoy yourself here with the great view and fun decor  but the food and service were just bad. I felt the staff couldn t  be bothered  with my requests and I was afraid to say anything about my poor quality food thereafter. Not how you want your customers to feel.
Hula Hut,461,The food was alright but this place was a absolute zoo on a weekend. It took a good while to even have our table bussed before we could order. It s was a little too hectic for me and the quality of the food wasn t tolerable for the crazy busy of the place.
Hula Hut,462,While the food was decent  I specifically told our waiter that I absolutely could not have any bell peppers. Well...2 bites into my food  I find bell peppers  My husband immediately told the waiter  while I m drinking large amounts of water. The waiter stood a minute and said  well  you didn t say it was an allergy  . Then another waitperson grudgingly brought me a new order and basically tossed new silverware at my place. NO ONE ever even asked if I was ok. Won t be going back.
Hula Hut,463,I know a lot of people don t find Hula Hut to be as good or amazing as I do  but I will always be a fan  unless everything just goes downhill . Many people speak about the great views of the water  whether you sit indoors or out  but I always just think about their chips and salsa  especially now that I no longer stay in Austin.   The chips are so light and thin  it almost feels like it evaporates as soon as you chew it. But they always come out fresh and warm and is paired well with their pico salsa  that could be described as a bit watery . I wish they would add jalapenos or some type of spice to make another pico since I enjoy spicy foods but it s still really flavorful. Despite the texture  I enjoy it because I can dunk my chips in there and when I feel like it  I order a side of jalapeno ranch to also go with it.   My go-to are the tubular tacos whether it is the chicken   guacamole one or the steak corn taco. I personally have not tried the shrimp one but many have put up the photo and stated it was decent. Their plates are always hot so the refried beans and rice that s on it comes out extra hot  and that s how I always prefer my food.   I would recommend this place if you re a fan of Chuy s Trudy s as I feel the food is better. The menu isn t the full  Texmex  experience as it s a different fusion somewhat  but I think it s definitely a place worth trying especially if you re also trying to drink some margs.
Hula Hut,464,Lex said she was a brand new waitress  but I couldn t tell bc she killed it tonight  Great food and great service  I ll be back 
Hula Hut,465,We ate at the fantastic restaurant on the lake  I was a little reserved when our server came to us in yoda ears  but he was super professional  went on to introduce himself  Manoli . He suggested some fantastic entrees   tubular chicken guac tacos and thai bar-b-q fajitttas. Fantastic I might add  Cuisine was amazing  but this guy  Manoli   was far beyond that. If anyone should choose to dine here  I highly recommend  Manoli and this stellar place 
Hula Hut,466,The 3.5 star rating here is pretty accurate. The food here is completely hit or miss  but the drinks  location  and service makes up for it. Great spot to hang out  but not the place to go if you want a great meal  but I will get into that in a moment.  Hula Hut is located right on the river. Location  location  location  and as far as location goes  it s definitely one of the best settings I could ask for. They have a bar that is literally over the water  Need I say more  Our bartender was very great and offered some great drink suggestions as well  all of which were tasty and pretty strong   To start  we ordered the Kawaikin Stuffed Avocado  which was stuffed with roasted chicken  green onions  cilantro  monterey jack cheese and green chiles. One word describes this dish  yum  Who doesn t love a good fried dish  I m seriously asking  but I will show you a liar  Served on a bed of hatch green chile and queso blanco sauces  I strongly recommend this dish for all my Yeeps   The Huli Huli Luau Platter was a great way to go. In my opinion  any kind of platter is a smart choice for a first time visiting a restaurant so you can try a little bit of everything. It comes with a lot  so I am going to break it down based on the item. The half rack of B.B.Q Baby Back Ribs was probably the highlight of the plate. I have had better  but they were still sweet and delicious  The Texas nachos was literally a fried tortilla with cheese  grilled chicken  and jalapenos. A nice item to munch on  but I only had one. The papas asadas with chile con queso was absolutely delicious  as was the chopped salad which was a great palette cleanser  Love it  On the other hand  the chicken flautas were forgettable  dipping them in queso helps . The tacos as a single item were alright  but the guacamole they provided was basically mashed avocados and tomatoes  nothing else. Boring   I will give them credit for the value. The platter is big enough to share with 3 people  or 2 gluttons like myself   and I feel the value was worth it. The food is very hit or miss here  but the drinks were good and the location is absolutely perfect   Random note  the name is a total misnomer  When I hear  Hula Hut   I expect Hawaiian food  not TexMex... why  
Hula Hut,467,Hula Hut is probably one of my favorite - if not most favorite - restaurants in Austin.   I m a creature of habit. When I find something I like  I stick with it. And I LOVE the Chicken  amp  Guacamole Tubular taco. I get it every time.   These last 3 birthdays I ve gone here to celebrate. They give you a fun birthday dessert to top off your special day as well.   They re owned by Chuy s and while I love Chuy s Jalapeno Ranch dip  I do not recommend it here. They use too much ranch.   I always get the Pina Colada even though it really never seems like there is any alcohol in it. The skinny ritas are also very tasty.   It gets really hot out on the deck so be prepared to sweat or sit inside.
Hula Hut,468,Kitschy decor  fun location  especially if you get a seat outside or over the river.  Parking was CRAZY. Locals  I m sure  know to anticipate this and that it s just par for the course on a Friday night at this spot  but as a visitor  I couldn t believe the traffic and parking situation when we got there.  The wait was even crazier. They don t take reservations and there were several groups of 10 and 15 people ahead of our group of two on the waitlist. I think we were told 45 min when we checked in. We ended up waiting at least 20 min longer than that.  All that for really just okay food in the end. Nothing too exciting. It kind of seemed like well-prepared versions of food we could have gotten at Chili s.  Definitely not what we were hoping for after all the time spent parking and waiting at the restaurant.   Service was great  especially for such a busy night. And  again  location on the river was cool  we were lucky to have been seated in the section that extends out over the water.  Fun experience  but not worth the parking hassle and long wait on a busy night.
Hula Hut,469,The best part about this place is the environment. The view is great and it feels like you re in Hawaii. However  the food was just average. I had veggie enchiladas and they were honestly nothing special. There wasn t great flavor. Also  our waitress didn t seem to be very interested in serving us. She seemed to just rush by us most of the time. Which I assumed was because she must ve been busy  but she told us that the night was much slower than usual. So  overall  not impressed but it was nice to try out.
Hula Hut,470,Last night  after a long day of driving to Houston and back  my boyfriend and I decided to relax outside and grab dinner at Hula Hut. For a Wednesday night at 8 30pm it was surprisingly busy. When we arrived we were told that it would be about a 35 minute wait  which was fine because that just gave us the excuse to wander down to Mozart s and look at the swans and the ducks while we waited.   Our server  Tyler  was great. Even though the place was a madhouse and he was incredibly busy  he was extremely attentive  made sure that we were happy with everything  and even gave my boyfriend a few suggestions while looking at the menu. So  yeah  thank you  Tyler    We decided on the combo beef and chicken Hawaiian Fajitas  which I mostly wanted because I love that Polynesian plum sauce and the grilled pineapple rings that they put on there. The tortillas were warm  the sides were good  and it all came out hot and ready in less than 10 minutes. The only issue we had was that we stuffed ourselves and had to waddle back to the car... but that was our fault. Great view and good food. Two thumbs up 
Hula Hut,471,I thought this restaurant served hawaiian food  but no. It s mexican stuff. Yummy.    We ordered drinks first. They were huge  Texas sized.   My daughter devoured ribs. I loved the nachos with guac and sour cream. Laurie s chicken tortilla soup was just right.   We all plowed through the queso and chips.   Cool setting by the lake. Great server.
Hula Hut,472,Cool Hawaii in Austin feel complete with throw back Hawaiiana and old school Honolulu Star newspaper clippings.. agree that this is basically Chuys with a view and Hawaiian twist . Definitely worth a visit .
Hula Hut,473,Melissa was an absolutely amazing server    She took care of us and brought us everything we could ask for. Would definitely return just to have her wait on us 
Hula Hut,474,Love this place so much we went 2 nights in a row  Good Mexican with a little island mixed in. Really Austinesque atmosphere. Fun place  nice staff and excellent salsa. The chicken  amp  cheese enchilada was great. Next night I had the stuffed avocado. It was pretty good but the enchilada was better. Nice view of lake and great ambience
Hula Hut,475,This was my first time here. I had the steak fajitas. They were pretty good  and the service was fine. The chips were not fresh when we got them. This place has a lot of seating.
Hula Hut,476,I feel like Hula Hut is hit or miss ... All the time. Sometimes I go here and have a good experience and then the next time it s horrible. I went here a few months back with my parents when they were in town. It was the middle of the afternoon on like a Monday or Tuesday and we just wanted to sit by the water and drink. Our drinks were great and service was good. Really no major complaints. My next visit I went in the evening during the week also and had a very different experience. We sat outside again and ordered food ... It took forever for us to be able to order anything. I actually saw guests getting up to get their own chips and salsa. I ordered queso ... It never came. Needed a spoon for a kid after the plate finally arrived and it never came. Had to ask a different worker... Finally we got one. It s just crazy that this place is hit or miss all the time. I have been here probably 10 times in the past 5 years.   With all that said ... Their food is usually decent and more consistent than the service. I have had some disappointments there but nothing like the service. I like the atmosphere and so do a lot of other people  which is why I find myself here a couple times a year. Eh..
Hula Hut,477,We go here when family comes to visit because they love the water. I love the location and the view. They rate a 4 for their beauty. I wish the food was on par with the view.   The food always leaves me wanting more flavor. I ve tried several things here  both pupu platters and all they contain  which is a lot.  Huli Huli Luau Platter A half rack of B.B.Q Baby Back Ribs  four Texas Nachos with grilled chicken  two B.B.Q. Chicken Flautas  Hula Hut Chopped Salad  papas asadas  amp  chile con queso.  Polynesian Pescado Platter Two Coconut Shrimp  two Mexonesian Shrimp Flautas  two Grilled Fresh Fish Tacos  Grilled Fresh Salmon  Hula Hut Chopped Salad  amp  papas asadas.   My favorite thing are the ribs. My second favorite is the pork burrito  which has roasted pork  black beans  Monterey Jack cheese  green chiles  amp  roasted corn  in flour tortilla. They cover it with Hatch Green Chile and Queso Blanco Sauces with rice.   The location is a good reason to come here though. Watching the boats dock and people fishing while sipping a beverage and eating some Hatch green chili salsa isn t a bad way to spend a day.
Hula Hut,478,Great location on the water. We usually meet family here and sit in the big booth by the water. This place packs out so get here early or expect to wait. Our waiter did a good job. We were served chips and salsa right away.  We like the green chili do we order a side with the chips. It s great.  I would like if the salsa was a little different. It s like veggies sitting in water. But the chips are thin and great.   We first started with drinks. The mimosa I had was good. Can t beat  3 for one on Sunday. Also got a Blue Hawaii. Is was good. We started with the queso compuesto. It was really good. It s queso with beef fajita meat guac and pico. Then we ordered the pu pu platter the Polynesian pescado platter. It has 2 coconut shrimp  2 mexonesian shrimp flautas fried wonton stuffed w shrimp bacon jalape os  and cheese. Served with a plum sauce . This was really good. Sauce was a little watered down though. It also comes with 2 fish tacos  they were ok. Nothing great   grilled salmon hula hut chopped salad and papas asadas. Luv the chopped salad. The vinaigrette is awesome on the salad. We will return because the family has a great time here.
Hula Hut,479,Told the wait is an hour  after we drove 40 minutes to eat here they have an  unexpected shutdown  and tell us we have to leave after we have been waiting 30 minutes. No explanation either  wouldn t recommend. Waste of time take your money elsewhere....
Hula Hut,480,Margs are overrated and it s always busy but it s a cool spot. The fried Avocado is legit    
Hula Hut,481,I was so excited to have dinner at Hula Hut because I heard about it from a friend. The view was beautiful and the food started off good until the first roach crawled out from our booth onto a friends shoulder. We finally caught it and killed it and then another crawled across 3 peoples dinner plates. Then another ran across the back of the booth. No exaggeration needed  we were shocked  I have worked in the restaurant business so I understand the importance and the issues with pest control. It can be controlled with regular maintenance  The biggest disappointment was that even though the server was aware of the issues a manager never came to our table to apologize and check on us. The bill was not taken care of  We were told that is was discounted but my husband and I still paid  60 for the two of us. I don t think it was discounted. This was unacceptable and very disappointing  Rule of thumb in the restaurant business  if there is a roach  the meal is on the house and the manager needs to address the table.
Hula Hut,482,This was an email I sent to hula hut after our experience and it bounced back using the email on their own website. They re gonna lose a loyal customer.   Hi - I wanted to email you about a dining experience we had last night at your Austin location.  We took our family for our daughter s 21st birthday dinner last night to your Austin location.  We had a below average experience.   We were seated quickly which was a plus  there were nine of us .  We chose to sit outside because our daughter likes that environment.  We waited about ten minutes for our server to come to the table and while he was very nice  our service was really  really slow the entire night.  It also wasn t busy when we were there. We had a total bill of  166.26 and the food was mediocre.  I ordered the shrimp enchilada and there were exactly four tiny shrimp inside.  For a  12 plate and my previous experiences with hula hut  I m really used to better quality and service. We waited for water refills and drinks for a very long time.    We wanted our daughter to enjoy her birthday so we didn t make a stink at the time.    When we finished our meal  and my husband asked for the check  it took 20 minutes for our server to bring it. Then when my husband asked about where his card was  the server said he d already brought it back when he hadn t.    Overall  while we love the environment and fun atmosphere of Hula Hut - we are not planning to come back for food that we consider to be mediocre for what it s priced at and very slow  lackluster service.  Thank you  Deleted contact info 
Hula Hut,483,BEN is an excellent employee for hula hut  Our service was top notch    thank you so much 
Hula Hut,484,When I think back to my trip to Austin last July  this is one of the highlights of my trip. The atmosphere is fantastic.  It was really crowded when we went  and I felt like we would have to wait a long time for a table  but it was about 15 minutes.   It seriously reminds me of an island retreat inside here  especially from inside with the view of the water. Quite literally with all the greenery  I feel like I am on the water on a bay somewhere in Southeast Asia or something.  Just gorgeous.   The servers were fantastic. My drink was strong and delicious at the same time.  The food was delicious.  I just loved everything about this place. If it wasn t so hot  I would have liked to have eaten outside.
Hula Hut,485,Just ask first how long it will take to be seated. They don t offer that up front if they are busy.  We was told 20mins and it was so much less than that before we was seated.  Most happy about the view but it can get a bit crowded and tight.  Haven t got the food yet so we will see. Yippie
Hula Hut,486,This place has a nice dining atmosphere  Suggested it to a friend and she told me  I feel like I m on vacation . Usually pretty crowded but the wait isn t bad.  They send you text messages when seats are available so you can walk around while waiting  But basically   Food- pretty good but not memorable. I like their shrim taco    Service- first time I went it was pretty good. Second time it was not that good but probably also because they were more busy.  Atmosphere- Great   Overall I would still take a friend there for the scenery 
Hula Hut,487,Great place to eat and dine in a Hawaiian themed restaurant. Ate over the water  staff was really friendly and nice. Que-so was great  alcoholic beverages were very affordable as well as entrees. Nice view on the outside patio and a lot of scenic places around to take awesome memory pictures. I had the Hula Hut Burger  started getting full after two bites  it was great  little fries came with meal but overall it was a really good burger with white cheddar and added bacon to it. I was in Heaven.
Hula Hut,488,Visited on Memorial Day holiday  great atmosphere and awesome waiting experience with a system to text when your table is available.   I ve visited in the past and had the shrimp tubular tacos  also the fried avocado stuffed with chicken and cheese is absolutely amazing.  The drinks are great  Awesome local bloody marys and they offer frozen ritas with optional corona floaters.   However  this particular visit was not so appetizing. I ordered the beef fajita enchilada  awesome presentation. I was disgusted on the first fork of the enchilada  a long hair was intertwined into my cheese. You know when hairnets are optional in the kitchen the health department of Austin should really check into this.  Great atmosphere  great drinks  hairy food.
Hula Hut,489,Our server Elijah literally tried to fight my friends and I. He was being extremely rude and condescending pretty much the entire time. At one point  he passive aggressively mentioned that he was in a hurry  even though he was hanging out with his other co workers  in between serving literally one other table. We decided that we didn t want to tip somebody that rude. The food was pretty good  but it doesn t make up for the fact that Elijah confronted us as we were leaving  fists clenched and asking my friend   are you scared . The only reason that nobody is in jail right now is because his other co workers had to hold him back. After leaving  we called the restaurant and spoke to the manager  who didn t really seem interested in the fact that one of his employees tried to fight my friends and I.   PS. I don t know what yelps language policy is  but when I told him to relax he said  Suck a fat co  .  So yeah  that was.... an interesting thing to say
Hula Hut,490,Visited Austin with my girlfriend a few weeks back and looked for fish tacos with outside seating on Yelp. This was the winner     We came in on a weekend with lots of rain in the forecast but thankfully this local  hut  style restaurant had ample seating  all dependent on what you are looking for   We opted for an outdoor seating--and was great  Chips and salsa were given as we got settled in. Me and my girlfriend opted for a salad with the fish  So delish and exactly what we were looking for.  We also ordered their famous hula hut fish bowl  which we were warned was good for two--they were not kidding  as I was definitely feeling it with the help of my girlfriend   Always got lucky with their small parking area  which was shared with two other restaurants cafe  but their is additional Parking on the street and I also saw a sign for parking up the hill--across the restaurant area.   I m going to come back here when I return to Austin   
Hula Hut,491,Uh oh  everyone  Looks like Hula Hut is not only avoiding COVID-19 safety measures  they re hiding in-house infection from the staff  Keep up the great work  guys  It s good to see that you care so deeply about a city that kept you afloat for years.
Hula Hut,492,Food is okay. Priced appropriately for location. Parking is a pain. Hipsters abound and yet it s still a good place to meet up for drinks.
Hula Hut,493,The ambiance takes this place from 3 to 4 stars for me. The outdoor seating hovers out over lake Austin and there are multiple bars outside which help if there is a wait. Tonight we were told a 45 minute wait to sit outside  but it was only about 15 - which was nice. Service was good and the food is in mass quantity - the portions are solid  They even gave a great complimentary dessert for my wife s birthday.
Hula Hut,494,The food is amazing and so is the atmosphere  Melissa was such a great server. She brought my dog and she quickly brought her some water when we got our drinks. We love Hula Hut so much and will be back soon 
Hula Hut,495,The location was great. The food was okay. The wait time was over an hour. Our waitress was nice too.
Hula Hut,496,It was pretty mehh.. to be fair though  we did come on a dreary afternoon in the winter. I m sure this place is a bevy of action and fun during the warmer months.   The decor feels like a total Texas gulf coast beach house owned by jimmy buffet and magnum p.i. and it has a genuine charm that only a mother could love. That being said  I loved it  It was just cheeky and tacky enough to make you want more. I m even told that the giant fish outside the dock used to be a moveable  working animatronic that worked by feeding it quarters.   Decor aside  we had a queso app that was really rad  giant chunks of meat and guac on top made it very thick. Only issue was we were served the bottom of the barrel chips  all very tiny  flimsy  definitely not great for scooping. The table besides us was all employees  they were grabbing basket after basket of chips while we were nibbling on our morsel chips. We were eventually given a better basket after our server noticed the discrepancy in size  so all was well. We also split the salmon tacos. They weren t anything to write home about but the desired effect was reached in filling us up for a late lunch. I m looking forward to coming back and updating this post with a more roaring review and sampling everything that they have to offer.
Hula Hut,497,I give 1 Star for the scenery and the patio. Other than that the service is horrible. The servers watched my husband clean our table and grab our own chips. Not worth it 
Hula Hut,498,Great location and view. The bar area waiter was rude  moody- terrible-looked angry the entire time we were there. Refused to let us order food or drinks from bar seating area because our first order was from the bartender  you have to go back to the bar.  Food and the incredible views got you two stars.   That waiter should be fired- plenty of people would love opportunity to work there.   He worked outdoor bar on 20 May until close- awful.
Hula Hut,499,How is this place getting good reviews    I have been there three times and had crappy service and even WORSE food each time. I figured over a span of 4 years I would have one good experience but NO   I swore I would never go back after the last bad experience but the place was chosen by relatives.  I ordered macadamia crusted mahi mahi. We had 6 other people including kids and everyone received their meals within a  speedy  30 minutes. Mine didn t come with everyone else s but someone else s chicken did. After 3 different people asked me what I ordered  mine came after everyone finished their meals and lo and behold when I had finally given up and we were going to ask for the check  two slimy soggy fish replicas without a hint of crusted macadamia arrived COLD to my table.  I don t care WHO wants me to go here when they come to town... NEVER again    Our whole table agreed and said the food was terrible  except the kids. They will eat anything  
Hula Hut,500,my lord this shit was unequivocally fuckin bussin. 100 10 carlo miraflore was amazing and attentive. my mans deserves employee of the year.
